Futures and forward trading is speculative, involves substantial risk and is not suitable for all investors. While adding managed futures to a diversified portfolio has the potential to decrease volatility and enhance returns and to profit in rising or falling markets, there is no guarantee that managed futures products will achieve these goals or that managed futures will outperform any other asset class during any particular time.

Heisrelativelyhappywithwhathesees: USstocks,whichmakeupthe vastmajorityofhisassets,havedoubledsincethelowsofMarch2009. However,economicandpoliticalrisks suchastheEuropeandebtcrisiscontinuetocauseconcern,andhewantstoprotecthisgains. Spencer’s friend Victor tells him about the VIX, an index of market volatility that tends to go up when the market goes down. Victor points out that while Spencer can’t trade the VIX directly, he can trade VXX, an exchange-tradednote(ETN)thatislinkedtotheVIX.Thefollowingday,SpencerbuysenoughVXXtoputhis mindatease. Hetruststhat,ifstocksfall,VXXwillprovidesomeprotection. Besides,theVIXlevelseemslow enough(23.4,afterpeakingabove80duringthe2008financialcrisis)thatSpencerfiguresthere’snotmuch downside. Six months later, Spencer sits by the pool and reviews his portfolio. He finds that his US stock investments have risen by about 6%. He notes that the VIX level is 19.6, a 16% drop. But he is surprised to find that his VXX investment is down 54%. Furthermore, he discovers that when the S&P 500 hit a rocky patch from mid-Marchtoearly-June(fallingnearly10%),VXXwasessentiallyflateventhoughtheVIXroseby74%. Confused,Spencersearchestheinternetfor“VXX.\"HereadsthatVXXactuallytracksnottheVIXitself,but“a constantone-monthrollinglongpositioninfirstandsecondmonthVIXfuturescontracts.”1Furtherexploration leads Spencer to numerous references to “contango” and the dangers of “roll yield.” Realizing that he does notunderstandwhattheseconceptsmeanandhowtheyaffecthisreturns, hedecidestocloseouthisVXX position. Why did Spencer’s VXX investment behave so differently than the VIX? As Spencer discovered in his online search, many ETNs actually reflect an underlying investment in futures instruments. Indeed, the first panel of Exhibit 1 shows that VXX returns closely track VIX futures returns. While Spencer’s VIX experience represents an extreme example of thefutures-spotperformancedivergence,manyinvestorshaveexperiencedsimilardisappointment(see,forexample,the secondpanelofExhibit1)2. Soperhapstherelevantquestionis: whydothesefuturespositionsbehavedifferentlythan theirequivalentspotindexorspotinstrument? Over short periods of time, spot and futures returns tend to track each other closely. For example, the one-day price changeofthemostactiveVIXfuturescontractwilltypicallyhavethesamesignandsimilarmagnitudetothepricechange oftheVIXspotindex. However, overlongerholdingperiodsthereturnscandiffersignificantly, asSpencerexperienced. This futures-spot divergence is known as the futures “roll yield,” which we define as the difference in return between a futurescontractanditsunderlyingasset.3 The impact of roll yield can be quite significant, in some cases being similar in magnitude to the entire gain or loss an investor experiences on the futures position. However, in spite of the importance of roll yield in futures markets (and associated investments), there is a significant lack of clarity on the issue. Misconceptions persist regarding roll yield’s origin, measurement, impact and relationship to other concepts such as carry trading and trend following. One of the most pervasive misconceptions is that roll yield represents a realized gain or loss generated on the day of the contract roll,asalonginvestorsellstheexpiringcontractandbuysthenewactivecontract(orashortinvestortakestheopposite steps).

Indeed,thecumulativeprofitofanequivalent-sharepositioninthemostactiveS&Pfuturescontract(orangeline) linesupquitecloselywiththeS&Ppseudo-futuresprofit. What Does Any of This Have To Do With Roll Yield? We have shown that the futures return reflects the P&L of an investment in the underlying, accounting for additional benefitsandcosts,andthatthiswilltypicallydifferfromthespotreturn,particularlyoverlongperiodsoftime. Conceptually, wecandecomposethefuturesreturnas FuturesReturn= SpotReturn+ExcessBenefitorCostofOwningtheUnderlyingAsset (1) Hereandinthediscussiontofollow,weuse“return”tomeanthechangeinthevalueofaninstrumentorindexbetween twopointsintime,withoutdividingbytheinitialvalue.

In our S&P 500 example, the roll yield reflects the dividend payments in excess of financing costs. Exhibit 3 providesmoredetailonthebenefitsandcostsrelevanttoselectedassetclasses.

Thecumulativerollyield(lightblue)isalsoshown. While this example is fairly intuitive, there are several complicating factors. Primarily, unlike the pseudo-futures contract in our S&P example, a real futures contract has an embedded expiration date. Consequently, periodic unwinding and re-establishing(or“rolling”)ofpositionsisrequiredtomaintainexposuretotheunderlyingmarket. The P&L implications of the roll event tend to be a source of confusion.

On March 8, 2013, a long-only investor in S&P, whom we will call Lois, decides she wants exposure to the S&P 500, and goes long one contract11 of the March 2013 e-Mini (symbol: ESH3) at the closing price of 1549.50.12 At this time, ESH3 is designated as the “front” contract since it is closest to its expiry of March 15, 2013.

FORINVESTMENTPROFESSIONALUSEONLY PASTPERFORMANCEISNOTINDICATIVEOFFUTURERESULTS 15 This paper was intended to serve as an introduction to the concept of roll yield. We have demonstrated that roll yield is directlyrelatedto: 1. Thedifferencebetweenspotandfuturesreturns 2. Thenetbenefitorcostofowningtheunderlyingassetbeyondmovesinthespotpriceitself 3. Thefuturestermstructure Wehavealsoshownthatthedecompositionofthefuturesreturnintospotreturnandrollyieldprovidesinsightsintothe behavioroffuturespricesthathaveimplicationsforbothcarrystrategiesandtrendfollowingstrategies. Sincethesetypes of strategies are quite pervasive in the managed futures industry, fund managers and investors should have a strong workingknowledgeoftheseconcepts. At Campbell, many of these ideas are used in the ongoing development of new Trend Following strategies. They also serve as the foundation for some of the strategies included in Campbell PRISM, a quantitative trading program which utilizesasuiteofnon-trendbasedalphastrategiestoexploitstructuralmarketopportunities.

Thecumulativerolladjustmenttendstohavestrongtrendbehavior(sincethefuturestermstructuretendsto besimilarfromonerolldatetothenext). Conceptually, the return due to the impact of backwardation/contango is represented by the sum of the basis and the rolladjustment. Usingthesameargumentsasbefore, wecanseethatoverthelongterm, thebasiscontributionwillbe negligible, so the roll adjustment can serve as a proxy for the impact of the term structure on futures returns. However, the true impact of backwardation/contango can only be captured by considering the basis as well. Furthermore, unless thespotpricehasastrongdrift,thecumulativerolladjustmentwillbethedominantfactordrivingthefuturesreturn.
