Larsen, and Paul Whelan Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, no. 917 February 2020; revised August 2022 JEL classification: G13, G14, G15 Abstract This paper documents that U.S. equity returns are large and positive during the opening hours of European markets. These returns are pervasive, economically large, and highly statistically significant. Consistent with models of inventory risk, we demonstrate a strong relationship with order imbalances at the close of the preceding U.S. trading day. Rationalizing unconditionally positive “overnight drift” returns, we uncover an asymmetric reaction to demand shocks: market selloffs generate robust positive overnight reversals, while reversals following market rallies are much more modest. We argue that demand shock asymmetry can arise in inventory management models with time-varying dealer risk bearing capacity. Key words: overnight returns, immediacy, volatility risk, inventory risk _________________ Boyarchenko: Federal Reserve Bank of New York (email: nina.boyarchenko@ny.frb.org).

    "text": "Since the advent of electronic trading in the late 1990’s, U.S. S&P 500 index futures have traded close to 24 hours a day. In this paper, we document that, despite the 24 hour nature of the market, returns do not accrue linearly around the clock. In fact, the largest positive returns are between 2:00 and 3:00 - the opening of European markets in U.S. Eastern Time terms (ET) - averaging 3.7% on an annualized basis (1.48 basis points per day). We dub these positive average returns the ‘overnight drift’ and argue that the pattern is most likely driven by the overnight resolution of order imbalances arising from the end of the preceding U.S. trading day. We begin by dissecting trading during the U.S. overnight session and introduce a number of tests which demonstrate that returns during the 2:00 – 3:00 window are special in both economic and statistical terms. First, inspired by the data mining literature, we conduct a bootstrap exercise to estimate the distribution of test statistics of average hourly returns. Considering the distribution of point and t-statistic estimates for all hours we find a clear bi-modal distribution, with the 2:00 – 3:00 return corresponding to the higher mode. Strikingly, when comparing the distribution for all hours with the overnight drift hour, we see that the lower 2.5% interval for overnight drift return point estimates lies above the pooled 97.5% interval. Likewise, the lower 2.5% interval for the distribution of t-statistics lies above the pooled 97.5% interval. Second, accounting for multiple testing concerns, we consider Bonferroni and Benjamini-Yekutieli adjusted critical values and show that the only hour which remains consistently significant in full sample and subsamples is 2:00 – 3:00. Next,followingthefundalphaliterature,westudythepersistenceofovernightdriftreturns: they are positive in 20 out of 23 years since 1998 and statistically significant in 17 of these. In contrast, for example, opening hour returns between 9:00 – 10:00 are on average large and negative but only during recessionary periods (2000-2003, 2007-2008 & 2009) and flat otherwise. Furthermore, we show that the 2:00 – 3:00 return is statistically significant on every day of the week, and in 9 out of 12 months of the year, while returns during other periods of the day enter sporadically. The theoretical market microstructure literature offers two broad types of potential explanations fortheovernightdriftpattern: thepresenceofdifferentiallyinformedtradersinthemarket, generat- ing asymmetric information, and inventory (risk) management by market makers. For asymmetric information alone to explain the overnight drift, (1) news revelation to informed traders would need to systematically occur between the U.S. market close and the European market open and (2) the information revealed overnight would need to be positive on average.

    "text": "dard information releases, such as macroeconomic, monetary policy and earnings announcements, do not explain the overnight drift, suggesting that asymmetric information alone is an implausible explanation for the overnight drift. Studying potential explanations, we argue that unconditionally positive returns around the opening of European markets are consistent with predictions from models of inventory management anddemandforimmediacy, suchasGrossmanandMiller(1988)(GM).TheframeworkofGMshows that risk-averse market makers profit by providing liquidity to investors with asynchronous trading demands, generating mean reversion in prices as market makers absorb shocks to their inventories.1 To understand how inventory management concerns can lead to the overnight drift, suppose there is selling pressure during the day, translating into an overall negative order imbalance by the end of regular trading hours. Market makers become net buyers, bearing inventory risk until they are able to sell to new market participants arriving overnight; however, they demand compensation for this in terms of positive expected returns. A natural question that arises is why do price reversals not occur earlier upon the opening of overnight markets? The answer is that, even though overnight volumes have grown steadily over our sample period, the close of regular trading at 16:15 marks the only time of the day when volumes jump discontinuously down. Even in recent years volumes during Asian open hours remain substantially below volumes at the U.S. close: between 2009 – 2020 trading volumes in regular Asian hours (18:00 – 2:00) were 50 to 100 times lower than volumes during U.S. trading hours. Indeed, recasting the trading day in volume time, where each period has a fixed number of contracts traded, returns increase linearly in signed volume until around 60,000 contracts, corresponding to the average number of contracts traded by 3:00.2 In other words, it takes market makers roughly 60,000 contracts to offset end-of-day order imbalances as of the previous day, with this re-balancing occurring earlier during the night as trading increases during Asian market hours. Conditioning on end-of-day order imbalances, we show the relationship between signed volume and returns in volume-time is approximately linear but asymmetric; thus, re-cast in volume time, demand shock asymmetry is a more general feature of the data observable throughout Asian and European hours. We study in greater detail predictions from GM-type models which state that returns for pro- 1The CME does not designate ‘specialist’ market makers in e-mini futures. Instead, effective market makers are any participants willing to post limit orders on both sides of the order book and hence supplying liquidity (immediacy) to other traders in the market. 2As pointed out by Easley, de Prado, and O’Hara (2012), in the high-frequency world, trade time, as captured by volume, is a more relevant metric than clock time and models of immediacy and inventory risk, such as Grossman and Miller (1988), are implicitly set in volume time as it is assumed that a fixed number of trades occur in each period. 2",

    "text": "viding immediacy should be higher when order imbalances are larger or uncertainty is higher. In order to exploit as much data as possible and to account for a time-trend in volumes, our main proxy for order imbalance is defined as relative signed volume, computed as signed volume over gross volume, and denoted RSV .3 On average, close-to-close RSV is negative consistent with the t t idea that the futures market is traded as a hedging instrument for the underlying. close Sorting our full sample based on closing RSV , sampled between 15:15 – 16:15, we show that t order imbalances at U.S. close are followed by overnight price reversals as predicted by inventory models and that price reversals following market sell-offs are much stronger than following market rallies. Moreover, pricereversalsareaccompaniedbycontemporaneoustradingflowsintheexpected direction.4 We also study the additional intuitive prediction that market makers should not require a liquidity premium for holding zero inventory, and therefore order imbalances close to zero should have little price impact. Consistent with this idea, when closing imbalances are approximately zero, we find reversal returns which are economically small and statistically indistinguishable from zero. Next, we study the relationship between overnight returns and uncertainty. In double sorts close on RSV and the end-of-day level of VIX, we show that, conditional on the level of the VIX, t average overnight returns are higher following days with greater negative end-of-day order imbal- ance. Conversely, conditional on the size of negative end-of-day order imbalance, average overnight returns are higher following days with greater end-of-day levels of the VIX. That is, consistent with the predictions of models of immediacy, price reversals are larger following days with larger end-of-day order imbalances and even more so if the large order imbalances coincide with periods of elevated uncertainty. Double sorts on order imbalances and uncertainty also reveal that the distribution of the VIX is similar across positive and negative order imbalance days, suggesting that the asymmetry in price reversals is unlikely driven by a correlation between order imbalances and the level of asset return variance. Instead, we speculate that this asymmetry is related to market maker time-varying risk-bearing capacity.

    "text": "GM model, we show that demand shock asymmetry arises when dealers face value-at-risk (VaR) constraints as in Danıelsson, Shin, and Zigrand (2004) and Adrian and Shin (2010, 2014a). In the data, negative end-of-day imbalances are associated with positive changes in return variance.5 Positive shocks to volatility increase the likelihood that dealer constraints bind, magnifying their ef- fective risk aversion during sell-offs and increasing required compensation for providing immediacy. During market rallies the opposite intuition holds.6 Weconfirmourinventoryriskconjecturemoreformallybyestimatinghighfrequencypredictabil- ity regressions of returns on end-of-day order imbalance, and find statistically and economically significant loadings on the hours when London and Frankfurt financial markets open. Thus, high frequency returns become predictable as market makers transact with new participants arriving overnight, trading away order imbalances remaining from the previous U.S. trading day. Exploiting high frequency predictability regressions further, we conduct a natural experiment to test the rela- tionship between the overnight price reversals and the arrival of overnight traders. In particular, we exploit the fact that while the U.S. observes daylight savings time (DST), Japan does not, so that, as seen from the perspective of a U.S. trader, the timing of Japanese market opening changes exoge- nously from 19:00 in winter to 20:00 in summer.7 Indeed, accounting for DST, return predictability around Tokyo open shifts forward by one hour when moving from winter to summer time, so that exogenous variation in the time of arrival of liquidity traders leads to predictable variation in the returns earned overnight. Expanding the natural experiment to also include the 3 weeks of the year when the DST is asynchronous between the U.S. and Europe, we again find that the overnight return predictability shifts to the 4:00 – 5:00 hour (the first hour of regular trading in London and Frankfurt when the U.S. – Europe time difference is 4 hours). We conclude by studying a set of trading strategies that exploit overnight price reversals. Pre- transaction costs, a trading strategy that goes long the S&P500 futures between 2:00 and 3:00earns a Sharpe ratio of 1.1 and accounting for bid-ask spreads this reduces to −0.5. Extending the trading interval to the sub-period between 1:30 – 3:30 increases the pre-transaction cost Sharpe ratio to 1.3 but with an associated post-transaction Sharpe ratio equal to 0.3. This is exactly what is predicted by models of inventory risk: market makers position their limit order books to incentivize trades 5This is the so called ‘leverage effect’ which is the well studied empirical fact that equity volatility tends to rise when returns are negative, and fall when returns are positive (see, for example, Black, 1976). 6Alternatively, if the permitted VaR is given as a fraction of equity, rather than as a dollar amount, the VaR constraint becomestighterwhenmarketmakerequitydeclines.

Finally, we note that although the documented high frequency return patterns of this paper are not easily profitable, the persistent presence of the overnight drift suggests that the intraday timing of portfolio adjustments should be an important consideration for asset managers and institutional investors. Indeed, market developments suggest that arbitrageurs are trying to capitalize on the patterns identified in this paper, with NightShares launching two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in June 2022, targeted specifically at earning the overnight drift, citing financing costs and end-of-day order imbalances as driving forces behind the pattern.8 Related Literature: In the time-series, existing studies have documented that equities earn a substantial proportion of their returns during the overnight period compared to the regular U.S. trading-hours (for example, Cliff, Cooper, and Gulen, 2008 or Kelly and Clark, 2011). In work subsequent to ours, Bondarenko and Muravyev (2020) replicate our finding that the lion’s share of CTC equity futures returns are earned around the opening hours of European markets. In the cross-section, Heston, Korajczyk, and Sadka (2010) study high frequency periodicity in firm level returns documenting persistent intraday return reversals, which the authors argue arise because investors have predictable demand for immediacy at certain points within the day. Lou, Polk, and Skouras (2017) document firm level reversal patterns between intraday and overnight returns: overnight (intraday) returns predict subsequent overnight (intraday) returns positively, while overnight (intraday) returns predict subsequent intraday (overnight) returns negatively. The authors link this pattern to a ‘tug of war’ between retail investors trading at the beginning of the day and institutional investors who trade at the end of the day. Bogousslavsky (2018), on the other hand, studies institutional constraints and a cross-section of intraday pricing anomalies. Finally, we motivate our empirical design from a literature that studies demand for immediacy and inventory risk (Grossman and Miller, 1988; Vayanos, 2001; Brunnermeier and Pedersen, 2009; RostekandWeretka,2015).

    "text": "I. Data Our primary focus is data on intraday trades and quotes for S&P 500 futures contracts traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The initial S&P 500 futures contract was introduced by the CME in 1982, trading both by open outcry and electronically during U.S. regular trading hours concurrently with the cash market.10 This ‘big’ futures contract (henceforth SP) was originally quoted with a multiplier of $500 per unit of underlying, so that if the index trades, for example, at $500, the value of the SP contract is $250,000. As the index level rose over time, the SP contract became expensive to trade at this multiplier and the contract multiplier was cut to $250 times the index on November 3, 1997.11 In September 1993, the SP contract began trading electronically outside regular hours via the CME GLOBEX electronic trading platform. The S&P 500 e-mini futures contract (henceforth ES) was introduced on September 9, 1997 and is quoted at fifty times the index, i.e. one-fifth of the big SP contract. The ‘e’ in e-mini is for electronic as trading takes place only on the CME GLOBEX platform which facilitates global trade for (almost) 24-hours a day, 5-days a week. The two futures contracts have quarterly expiries on the third Thursday in March, June, September and December. The most traded contract is almost always the front contract (the contract closest to expiry). Only when the front contract is close to expiry is the back contract (the contract second closest to expiry) more traded. This is because market participants roll their positions in advance of the expiry. We always use the most traded contract. Exact trading times on CME platforms have changed over time but today trades are executed continuously from Sunday (18:00) – Friday (17:00), with a daily maintenance as of 2020 between 17:00 and 18:00.12 Our primary data source exploits tick-by-tick data on trades and quotes for the ES contract fromRefinitivDatascopeSelect, whichwecomplementwithdataobtaineddirectlyfromtheCME.13 The trades dataset includes the trade price, trade size and trade time. The quotes dataset includes quote price, quote size and quote time, with the first five levels of the order book available at all 10Regular trading hours are defined by the open outcry or pit session which trades between 9:30-16:15 11The minimum tick size was also cut to 0.25. See Karagozoglu, Martell, and Wang (2003) for a discussion on how this change affected market liquidity and volatility. 12Between November 1994 and December 2012 the trading week began on Sunday at 18:30 and closed on Friday at 16:15. The trading day (other than Sundays) ran from 18:00 one day to 17:30 the following day with maintenance break between 16:15 – 16:30. From December 2012 to December 2015 trading began half an hour earlier on Sundays (18:00) and closed one hour later Fridays (17:15 ET). There was also a maintenance break from 23:00 to 00:00 on Tuesday through Friday from October 1998 to September 2003. 13Refinitiv Datascope Select was formerly known as Thomson Reuters Tick History. 6",

We convert the UT timestamps to U.S. Eastern Time (ET), and define the intraday (ID) and overnight (ON) trading sessions relative to the opening hours of the U.S. cash equity market. We identify the direction of trades by comparing the trade price to the most recent quoted prices of the top level in the limit order book: buy (sell) orders trade at the best available ask (bid) price. Our sample period with 24 hour trading starts in January 1998 and ends in December 2020.14 Market depth for the first 5 levels of the order book is available since 2009. Panel (a) of figure 1 displays within-the-month average daily trading volume for the SP and ES contracts where the ES is further split by volumes within ON and ID trading sessions. We measure volume as the total number of contracts traded in the most liquid contract, multiplying the volume for the SP contract by 5 (10 prior to 1998) to make its volume comparable to the ES. The figure shows that, since the advent of electronic trading, volume in the SP has trended down over time. Instead, the trading volume in the ES (plotted in red for ON and blue for ID) was growing in the run up to the 2008 financial crisis, and thereafter stabilized at around 1-2 million contracts traded per day. Turning to panel (b), we see that, while the annual volume traded ON as a percentage of overall volume was small and constant at around 2% until the years 2002, it increased somewhat linearly to around 15% in 2010 and remained flat until 2018. In 2018, with the level of the index above 2000, using the index multiplier of 50, this implies $15 billion traded daily during the overnight session. We also note that in the final years of our sample (2019 & 2020) the share of overnight trading in the ES has again increased and stands at around 20% of total volumes.

Returns around the clock This section studies intraday returns computed from the most liquid e-mini contract, which is almost always the front month contract, except in expiration months when contracts are rolled. Returns are computed from mid quotes of best bid-offers.

    "text": "A. Main result The n-th log return on day t is defined as rN = p −p (1) t,n t,n t,n−1 N N for n = 1,...,N, where p denotes the log price at time n/N on day t and N is the number t,n N of return observations throughout the day. n = 0 and n = N corresponds to 18:00 when a new trading day begins as defined by the CME. We work interchangeably with hourly returns (N = 24), 15-minute returns (N = 96), 5-minute returns (N = 288), and 1-minute returns (N = 1440).15 The grey bars in figure 2 display hour-by-hour log returns and the black line depicts cumulative 5-minutelogreturns, averagedacrossalldaysinoursample. Estimatesareannualized inpercentage points and show that ON returns are positive, on average, between the hours of 00:00 and 4:00. Thirty minutes prior to the opening of the cash market at 9:30 equity returns are initially large and negative and become smaller in magnitude but remain persistently negative until 12:00. We dub negative return realizations between 9:00 – 10:00 ‘opening hour’ returns. The ID period is then characterized by a flat return profile until 15:00, which is followed by a sequence of positive returns that turn strongly negative after the maintenance break. This overnight return pattern is surprising. The red line in figure 2 plots the cumulative average return profile one would expect if information arrived continuously and returns accrued linearly, which contrasts starkly to the realised return profile displayed in back. On average, the CTC log return is 5.9%, which is close to the average yearly log return on the S&P 500 index cash (excluding dividends).16 More than half of this return is generated during the ON session: from 16:15 to 9:30 equity returns averaged 3.6% p.a. More striking than this, the return earned during the 2:00 to 3:00 hour averaged 3.7% p.a. We dub this return sequence the ‘overnight drift’ (OD). Figure 3 displays a more granular view of returns around the OD. Here, we see a persistent sequence of positive returns, which are clearly visible in almost every interval between 1:00 and 4:00, showing that the positive average return between 2:00 and 3:00 is not driven by within-the-hour outliers but instead represents a continuous drift over this interval of the overnight trading session. What is special about this hour? Table II collects opening and closing times for 14 global 15Our last observation on Fridays is at 18:00. Our first observation on Sunday is at 18:01.

As U.S. regular trading hours on GLOBEX close, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Singapore and then China open between 18:00 and 21:30. Day trading in these venues closes between 2:00 and 3:00, at which point Dubai, Russia, London and Europe open. Thus, the OD coincides with the opening of regular trading on Euronext, Eurex, and the Frankfurt Deutsche B¨orse, as well as pre-market trading on the London Stock Exchange, all occurring at 2:00. This observation highlights the geographical nature of 24-hour trading and provides a first clue towards a potential explanation. (cid:104) (cid:105) Insert figure 2 and 3 here B.

Table I reports estimates for µ and t-statistics computed from HAC robust standard errors. We also report p-values adjusted for multiple testing, medians, standard deviations, skewness and kurtosis estimates. Consider first panel (a) of table I which collects ON return statistics. Average returns for the hours {24-01, 01-02, 02-03} are equal to {0.46, 0.43, 1.5} basis points per hour per day (bps) with corresponding t-statistics equal to {2.8, 2.8, 7.1}, respectively. Due to the minimum tick size, median returns computed from quotes are often zero during the night. However, even the median quote return for the OD hour is large and positive equal to 0.64 bps.17 Consider now panel (b) of table I which collects ID return statistics. The opening hour return is strongly negative, equal to -1.2 bps with a t-statistic of 2.6, and the 17:00 – 18:00 return is equal to -0.43 bps with a t-statistic of -3.6. The remaining ID returns are flat and statistically indistinguishable from zero. Within the 24 sub-periods of the day, there is reasonably large variation in average returns across hourly windows. Indeed, while the hours {24-01, 01-02, 02-03} are striking in both economic and statistical terms, there are other windows which are statistically significant at the 10% level over the full sample. This is to be expected since we are simultaneously testing more than one null hypothesis, and it is well known that an appropriate significance level such as α = 0.05 is not valid due to an inflated probability of committing a type I error.

    "text": "nature of our analysis in two ways. First, we conduct a bootstrap exercise partitioning the day into 24 hourly sub-periods as in table I. Distributions of test statistics are calculated using a block bootstrap (BS) sampling 10,000 times, with the optimal block length chosen following Patton, Politis, and White (2009). Panel (a) of figure 4 plots the distribution of all hourly returns pooled together while panel (b) plots the distribution of returns during 2:00 – 3:00. Dotted blue lines mark 95% confidence intervals. Black dotted lines represent median estimates for specific hours. Each histogram is normalized such that it represents a probability density function estimate, i.e., the sum of the bar areas is equal to 1. In terms of economic magnitudes the OD return lies well above the upper 97.5% interval. More striking, comparing panel (a) to panel (b), the lower 2.5% BS interval for the distribution of OD estimates lies above the pooled 97.5% interval. Panel (c) repeats this exercise but plotting the distribution of all hourly pooled t-statistics while panel (c) plots the distribution of t-statistics for the OD hour. The conclusion here is the same: the statistical significance of the OD returns is extreme compared to all other hours. Moreover, panels (a) and (c) are clearly bi-model, which is due to unusually large returns realised between 2:00 – 3:00. Making this point clear, panels (e) and (f) compute the equivalent test statistics to panels (a) and (c) after removing 2:00 – 3:00. In these plots the second mode disappears further highlighting the unusual nature of the OD hour. (cid:104) (cid:105) Insert table I and figure 4 here Second, we account for multiple testing by using the Bonferroni (BF) correction to control the family-wise error (FWER) and the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) procedure to control for the false discovery rate (FDR).18 Accounting for the multiple testing problem, we find that only the OD hour and the 17:00 – 18:00 hour are significant, and this holds for both BF and BY methods.19 More specifically, using the BF correction the significance level is adjusted to α/m where m = 24 hours is the number of tests. At the 5% level, the BF adjusted significance level is 0.05/24 = 0.0021 and it is 0.01/24 = 0.00042 at the 1% level. With a p-value of 1.1 · 10−12, the OD hour is extremely statistically significant. The BY method is a ‘step up’ procedure that computes null specific thresholds starting from the least significant hypothesis and working up until significant 18TheFWERistheprobabilityofmakingoneormoretypeIerrors.

The BY thresholds are reported in table A.4 (OA) at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels and shows that the OD hour is the only significant return hour at the 1% level. In summary, the evidence presented so far demonstrates that 2:00 – 3:00 is a special hour of the day, in both economic and statistical terms, and very far from what one should expect to see just by luck. C. Subsample Analysis and Persistence In addition to concerns related to multiple testing one could also be suspicious that the “outper- formance” of OD returns compared to other hours were sample specific or a result of data-mining. A first simple test to address this concern splits the sample in two and recomputes figure 2 which is displayed in figure 5. Panel (a) considers the sample period January 1998 – December 2010 and in panel (b) the sample period is January 2011 – December 2020. One observes that the overall pattern of 24 hour returns across subsamples is quite different. On the one hand, in the first sample opening hour returns are large, negative and significant after accounting for multiple testing using a BF adjustment (blue highlighted bars) but are slightly positive and insignificant in the second sample period. On the other hand, returns between 17:00 – 18:00 are insignificant in the first sample period but become significant in the second sample period. However, both samples share the common characteristic that OD returns are large, positive, and significant at the 5%.20 (cid:104) (cid:105) Insert figure 5 here Second, a common approach used in the fund management literature to distinguish skill (out- performance) from luck is to study persistence in funds α (see, e.g., Fama and French, 2021). Analogously, figure 6 displays the cumulative log returns to a $1 initial investment that trades var- ious sub-periods of the day. Panel (a) considers long positions in the hours {24-01, 01-02, 02-03} and panel (b) considers the cumulative returns that go short the opening and 17:00 – 18:00 hours of the day. A passive CTC investment in e-mini futures (not shown) bears well known business cycle risk, as evidenced by large negative returns in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial crisis, and more recently during the early stages of the COVID pandemic.21 By contrast, a $1 investment that holds e-mini futures for only one hour during the OD period would have returned 20Subsample statistics are reported in the OA. 21A $1 investment in e-mini futures CTC would have returned $3.8 by December 2020. 11",

The OD is slightly negative in the recessionary years of 2002 and 2008, and again in 2019. The bottom panels report (1−p) values from t-tests against the null of zero. Panel (e) shows that, at the 10% level, the OD is significant in 17 out of 23 years. Splitting the sample year-by-year highlights the statistical and economic consistency of 2:00 – 3:00 returns compared to 12:00 – 1:00 or 1:00 – 2:00 returns. Indeed, while the two hours that precede the regular opening hours in London are mostly positive, they are much smaller economically and are rarely significant at conventional levels. Moreover, section B in the OA studies these findings along a number of different dimensions and demonstrates that positive statistically significant average returns during 2:00 – 3:00 are a systematic feature or the data, present on all days of the week and 9 out 12 months of the year. While observing significant positive or negative return hours is certainly interesting, developing a unified explanation for all hours of the day is beyond the scope of this paper. Instead, we will focus on the overnight return patterns straddling the opening of European markets, paying special attention attention to 2:00 – 3:00, which in economic and statistical terms is the salient hour of the day; thus allowing us to test theory driven hypotheses consistently over the entire sample.

    "text": "In the section, we study a potential explanation for the overnight return patterns documented above. To help frame the discussion of the confluence of factors that can explain an asymmetric overnight drift, it is helpful to start from the frictionless benchmark in, for example, Glosten and Milgrom (1985). Glosten and Milgrom (1985) consider the bid and ask price setting problem of a risk-neutral, zero-profit (competitive) market specialist (market maker) and show that, in the absence of any frictions, such as inventory costs and asymmetric information, the bid price equals the ask price and the expected return earned by the market maker is indeed 0. Phenomena like the overnight drift – that is, high frequency price reversals with a non-zero unconditional mean – must thus arise when one or more of the assumptions in the frictionless Glosten and Milgrom (1985) benchmark case are violated. The first strand of the market microstructure literature relaxes the assumption of no asymmetric information (see e.g. Menkveld, 2016, for an overview). Glosten and Milgrom (1985) show that, when risk-neutral, competitive market makers face informed traders, the optimal bid-ask spread is not zero, and increases in the amount of information present in the market. Thus, for the overnight drift to arise as a result of asymmetric information, news revelation to informed traders has to systematically occur between the U.S. market close and the European market open – so that marketmakerssetalowerbidatU.S.marketcloseandahigheraskatEuropeanmarketopens–and the information revealed overnight has to be positive on average. In the Appendix, we show that the overnight drift cannot be explained by standard information releases, including macroeconomic, monetary policy and earnings announcements, suggesting that overnight information revelation is an unlikely source of the overnight drift. The second strand of literature focuses on the impact of market maker inventories (see e.g. Stoll, 1978;AmihudandMendelson,1980;HoandStoll,1981,1983;MildensteinandSchleef,1983;O’Hara and Oldfield, 1986; Grossman and Miller, 1988; Shen and Starr, 2002) and the costs of maintaining those inventories. This literature finds that, even in the absence of financing constraints on the part of the market makers, market makers that either face non-linear costs (Amihud and Mendelson, 1980; Shen and Starr, 2002) or that are risk-averse (O’Hara and Oldfield, 1986) set bid-ask spreads in a way that reflects their inventory positions. In such models, the setting of the bid and the ask prices depend on both contemporaneous demand and supply and on the future expected value of the 13",

    "text": "security. Price reversals can thus arise in models of inventory (risk) management due to variation in either order imbalances over time or in expectations of future value of the security (information revelation). Finally, most recently, the market microstructure literature has studied the link between funding liquidity – that is, how constrained market makers are in funding their inventories – and market liquidity provision. Gromb and Vayanos (2002); Weill (2007); Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2005); Attari, Mello, and Ruckes (2005); Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009) feature models in which capital-constrained market makers (or market makers with costly capital) undersupply market liq- uidity, leadingtotime-variationinmarketreturnsduetoorderimbalances, fundamentalinformation revelation and market maker capital constraints. Given the implausibility of information revela- tion alone as the source of the overnight drift, in this Section, we focus on the implications of the inventory risk-management based models for market microstructure. More concretely, consider the following stylized example. News is announced during the U.S. in- traday trading session that results in selling pressure at market close. Orders transact at the best available bids and, consequently, execute at successively lower prices down the order book. As the sell-off unfolds, prices drop below fundamental values because risk-averse market makers bear in- ventory risk. Market makers are compensated for bearing that risk through high expected returns, earned when they offload their excess inventory to new customers arriving overnight. Grossman and Miller (1988) (GM) provides a framework that models such ‘liquidity events’ through the supply and demand for immediacy. In GM, buyers and sellers arrive at different points in the trading day, which generates transient imbalances between buy and sell volumes. Market makersofferimmediacytoincomingtradersbyabsorbingorderimbalancesandsubsequentlytrading them away. In our context, compensation for bearing inventory risk (a liquidity premium) is earned through expected returns for offloading positions to new customers arriving overnight, i.e., prices drop from S to S as the market sells off intraday and rebounds from S to S as trading begins 0 1 1 2 in overseas timezones.

In the following, we study our proposed explanation by testing these predictions. A. End-of-day Volumes To motivate an inventory management explanation, consider figure 8 which displays intraday and overnight trading volume patterns. To account for an increasing trend in trade over time, for each daywecomputethevolumeinevery5minuteintervalweightedbytheaveragevolumethatoccurred in a 5 minute interval on that day. A number above ‘1’ means there is more volume during a given 5 minute interval compared to the daily average and vice-versa for a number below ‘1’. Panel (a) shows that most trade occurs around the opening and close of the U.S. cash market. Panel (b) zooms in on the overnight session revealing three U-shaped patterns: between 18:00 and 2:00 (Asia), between 2:00 and 3:00 (European opening), and between 3:00 and 8:30 which coincides with scheduled U.S. macro announcements. Quantifying intraday magnitudes in the recent sample, panels (c) plots average volumes for all hours of the day during 2020. With the index level at 3000 (late May & early June) closing volume in the 5 minute interval 16:10 - 16:15 averaged 85000×50×3000 ∼ 13 billion USD. By comparison, panel (d) zooms in on the overnight hours showing that volumes are an order of magnitude smaller. Cumulative volumes in the 8 hour period between 18:00 and 3:00 total 13500 × 50 × 3000 ∼ 2 billion USD so that, even in 2020, overnight trading represents a small fraction of the volume in the 5-minute interval preceding the maintenance break. Thekeytake-awayfromfigure8isthatthereisaneconomicallylargedownwardjumpinintraday volume at U.S. close and that overnight trading activity is between 50 to 100 times lower compared to the U.S. trading hours. From an inventory management perspective this makes order imbalances at close particularly risky since the extreme trading volumes leading up to U.S. close at 16.15 can generate large inventory imbalances. Such imbalances cannot be immediately traded away when the overnight session starts at 18:00 because the overnight trading activity is much lower. Moreover, even in recent years, order imbalances can last most of the overnight period and cannot be resolved until European trading begins. (cid:2) (cid:3) Insert figure 8 here 15",

    "text": "B. Volume Time In the previous section, we showed that returns earned during the OD hour account for the bulk of total overnight returns and argued that this pattern is inconsistent with returns accruing linearly over time. Instead, the high returns earned during the OD hour is in line with the basic idea of GM-style models, which imply that, conditional on an order imbalance, prices revert as new participants arrive and market makers offload their inventories. In clock-time, the speed of mean reversion depends on the volume of new participants because market makers cannot manage inven- tory imbalances when trading activity is low. Conversely, when trading activity is high, markets markers can offload quickly. In this context, a natural alternative to clock time is to measure time elapsed in terms of the trading volume as first proposed by Mandelbrot and Taylor (1967).24 Specifically, we consider volume time, which advances one increment for every contract traded and thus equals cumulative trading volume. Volume time is a type of activity time, like tick time, advancing slowly when few contracts are traded (Asian hours) and quickly when many contracts are traded (U.S. hours). By definition, trade activity is constant in volume time and we therefore expect order imbalances to revert linearly to zero in volume time. Thus, we also expect price reversals induced by inventory management to be linear when measured in volume time. From the perspective of inventory risk models, the empirical measure of order imbalance would be net inventory held by market makers. As these are not observable, we proxy for them from signed volume defined as SVi = #buy orders−#sell orders, (3) t where # of orders is defined as the number of contracts, t is the day, and i is the period during the day. Note that SVi is measured in dollar units consistent with equation 2, and the sample period t is 2007–2020 since total volume was relatively stationary during this period (see figure 1). Table A.7 of the OA shows the intraday properties of SVi while panels (a) and (b) of figure A.6 show the t distribution and time series of SVi at U.S. close. t Figure9displayscumulativelogreturns(computedfromVWAPS)andcumulativesignedvolume close in both clock time and volume time, sorted by SV , which is the signed volume measured in the t 24Mandelbrot and Taylor (1967) argue that price changes follow a Pareto distribution in clock time but are normally distributed in volume time.

Panel (a) and (c) are in clock time and we clearly see that price reversals are strongest at the opening of Asian (19:00 and 20:00) and European markets (2:00 and 3:00 ET) when volume jumps up, and that returns quickly flatten off after the initial hours of European trade. Panel (b) and (d) are in volume time. Following negative (positive) closing order imbalances, both signed volume and returns increase (decrease) essentially monotonically. Following market sell-offs, most of the overnight return is earned by the point 60,000 contracts are traded, or in other words, around the time when European markets open. Corresponding positive closing order imbalances generate a smaller price impact than negative closing order imbalances, even if order flow is quite symmetric following positive versus negative end-of-day imbalances. Thus, viewed from the perspective of volume time, we observe an almost linear but asymmetric demand shock response throughout Asian and European hours. (cid:2) (cid:3) Insert figure 9 here C. Economic Magnitudes Next, we evaluate the quantitative plausibility of an inventory risk hypothesis. From the data, we can observe three of the four terms that enter equation 2: the expected overnight returns E[R |F ], the end-of-day dollar order imbalance, and the (conditional) return variance. The final ON 1 component – the risk-bearing capacity of the market is harder to observe directly. Instead, we note (cid:16)Risk Bearing(cid:17) that the risk bearing capacity can be expressed as = N+1 where N is the number Capacity ARA of market makers providing immediacy and ARA is absolute risk aversion common across market makers. Recall further that the coefficient of relative risk aversion (RRA) is approximately the ARA multiplied by wealth, which allows us to re-cast equation 2 as a prediction for the RRA of the market makers in this market E[R |F ] ON 1 RRA = ×Wealth (4) Dollar Order Return × Imbalance Variance where Wealth denotes total capital of the market makers, (N +1)×Wealth , that is allocated to i supporting equity market trades.

Figure A.9 in the OA shows the time-series of equity VaR varies between 50 and 750 billion USD between 2000.Q1 and 2020.Q4, peaking in the financial crisis and rising again during the COVID-19 crisis.

For mortgage backed security arbitrageurs Malkhozov, Mueller, Vedolin, and Venter (2016) peform a similar calculation coming up with an estimate of 88. Our ‘back-of-the-envelope’ calculation suggests that, not only is an inventory risk explanation plausible from a qualitative perspective, but also from a quantitative one.27 25At the end of 2020, the five largest dealer banks were Bank of America, Citibank, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley.

End-of-day Order Imbalance We now study in more detail the prediction of GM-type models which states that returns for providing immediacy should be higher when order imbalances are larger. In order to exploit as much data as possible, and following much of the empirical literature, our main proxy for order imbalance in the remaining is relative signed volume, measured as signed volume over total volume SVi RSVi = t ∈ [−1,1], (6) t TVi t where TVi = #buy orders+#sell orders accounts for the increasing trend in total trading volume t over the sample 1998–2020.28 Table III reports summary statistics for hourly RSV . On average, close-to-close RSV is equal t t to −2.4% and is highly volatile. Negative CTC RSV ’s are consistent with the idea that the futures t market is traded as a hedging instrument for the underlying. However, while RSV ’s are negative t during the day, they are largely positive between 1:00 – 4:00. During the OD hour, average RSV t is 2.4% with a t-statistic of 6.7, mirroring the unconditional positive returns during this hour. In the following, we use the last hour preceding the maintenance (15:15 – 16:15) to measure closing order imbalance, which we denote RSVclose.29 t (cid:2) (cid:3) Insert table III here Figure10sortsalltradingdaysintogroupsbasedonclosingimbalances.

    "text": "Using RSVclose as a sorting variable the conditional return pattern resembles a step function t centered around zero. Figure A.7 in the OA shows that, when sorting on SVclose, the conditional t return pattern in monotonic, albeit with an asymmetric slope. More importantly, in both cases, negative closing imbalances generate statistically significant positive overnight returns. (cid:2) (cid:3) Insert figure 10 here Equation 2 contains an additional intuitive prediction that order imbalances close to zero should have little price impact. Indeed, market makers should not require liquidity premium for holding close zero inventory. Panel (d) examines this prediction by zooming in on OD returns based on RSV t straddling zero. Consistent with an inventory channel, when closing imbalances are approximately zero we find reversal returns which are economically small and statistically indistinguishable from zero. E. Volatility risk The second prediction of equation 2 is that expected overnight returns are increasing in the return variance of the risky asset. This is because risk-averse market makers demand a higher premium for holding larger price risk. To allow for differential effects on volatility due to demand shock asymmetry, we split the sample into positive and negative closing order imbalance days and then construct double sorts – based on terciles of RSV and volatility – within each sub-sample. Panel a close (panel b) of table IV reports double sorts conditional on negative (positive) RSV days. Double t close sorted return averages are reported based on terciles of RSV and the closing level of the VIX t close sampled at 16:15 each day.31 Within each set, we also report average RSV and VIX levels t (A1,A2,B1,B2). Double sorted OD return averages are reported (A3,B3) along with high minus low differences and p-values testing the difference against zero. We first note that the distribution of EOD VIX appears quite symmetric conditional on positive close versus negative RSV days. Thus, it is unlikely that asymmetric price impact is due to a t correlation between order imbalance and the level of asset return variance.32 Considering panel (a) close (positive RSV ) there is really no clear pattern is 3×3 sorted OD return averages.

(ii) Conditional on the level of the RSV , moving from low to high RSV t t states, the OD return averages are also increasing. The only exception is in high VIX states where close the impact of RSV is large but flat. Moreover, the high-minus-low return spreads are in the t anticipated direction and statistically significant in 5 out of 6 cases. Thus, as predicted by GM-style models, price reversals are larger following days with large end-of-day order imbalances and even more so if the large order imbalances coincide with periods of heightened uncertainty. (cid:2) (cid:3) Insert table IV here F. Demand Shock Asymmetry Consistentwiththeliteratureondownwardslopingdemandcurvesandimperfectliquidityprovision, we have shown that demand shocks have a temporary price impact that reverts over time. However, we have also shown a strong asymmetry in price impact in response to positive versus negative demand shocks. This asymmetry generates a positive unconditional overnight return which in clock time is concentrated in the hour from 2:00 – 3:00 (the OD). In Section III.B we then showed that re-cast in volume time, that demand shock asymmetry is a more general feature of the data observable throughout Asian and European hours. To the best of our knowledge, such an asymmetry is novel to the literature. Now, recall from 2 that the conditional expected return to providing immediacy is the product of three terms: the end-of-day order imbalance, conditional variance of returns, and the inverse of the risk-bearing capacity of the market makers. Table IV shows that the first two terms are unlikely to contribute to the asymmetric response to positive and negative demand shocks: the distribution of demand shocks around ‘0’ is roughly symmetric and the distribution of the VIX conditional on the sign of the demand shock is roughly similar. Instead, the asymmetric response to positive and negative demand shocks may be driven by contemporaneous changes in the risk-bearing capacity of the market makers. This may arise through two different channels. First, since there are no designated market makers for e-mini contracts, there is no obligation on the part of institutions that normally act as market makers to continue doing so in the face of large sell-offs. That is, during large sell-offs, institutions that act as market makers may choose to exit the market, reducing the total risk-bearing capacity of the market maker segment. 21",

    "text": "Second, those market makers that choose to remain during large sell-offs may reduce their individual risk limits in response to deteriorating market conditions. Section A.3 in the OA outlines how increases in volatility, which accompany market sell-offs, may translate into higher effective risk aversion when market makers face value-at-risk (VaR) constraints. Increases in volatility tighten the VaR constraint for market makers, translating into higher effective risk aversion. Conversely decreases in volatility do not translate into lower effective risk aversion once the VaR constraint is no longer binding. Thus, an asymmetry in the pass through of positive versus negative volatility shocks can generate an asymmetry in return reversals following demand shocks. Third, market makers may face an asymmetry in funding costs as in Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009) who argue that decreases in risk-bearing capacity arise when market liquidity and funding liquidity interact in flight-to-quality episodes, with capital required for trading evaporating when marketreturnsarenegative. Indeed,duringprolongedperiodsofmarketsell-offs, theCMEincreases the required initial margins for futures positions. Each of these mechanisms may contribute to time-variation in effective risk aversion; we leave further investigation of return reversal asymmetry for future research. IV.

A 1-standard deviation (6.55%) close decrease in RSV (a sell-off) induces a 6.55% · −17.49 = 1.15 basis point increase in returns t−1 between 2:00 – 3:00. We also observe a statistically significant negative relationship between 20:00 – 21:00, corresponding to the opening of Japanese (TSE) and Australian (ASX) markets. In panel (b) of Table V, we verify that order imbalance in the last hour of the U.S. trading day is the appropriate proxy for dealer inventory imbalances. We include order imbalances measured in the final three hours of the trading day (13:15–14:15, 14:15 – 15:15, and 15:15 – 16:15) as separate regressors in a multivariate extension to equation 7. Given the high levels of trading activity during U.S. open hours, we expect order imbalances from earlier in the day to have been traded away prior to the end of the trading day and thus have no impact on overnight returns. This is indeed what is suggested by the estimates in Table V. For example, focusing on the 2:00 – 3:00 interval, the point estimates monotonically decline the earlier in the day the order imbalance is measured and are insignificant beyond 14:15. (cid:2) (cid:3) Insert table V here B. Falsification Test Microstructuretheorypredictsalinkbetweenorderimbalanceandreturns,bothcontemporaneously and at lagged intervals. In inventory management models, high-frequency predictability arises as market makers adjust their quotes to resolve imbalances. The more liquid a market is, the shorter the period of predictability will be because market makers can quickly trade imbalances away. In illiquid markets such as corporate bonds predictability can last several days. Microstructure theory also predicts negative autocorrelation in returns due to a host market frictions and, indeed we do observe negatively autocorrelated returns for the e-mini but the generally large liquidity of the market implies autocorrelation coefficients only are significant for, at most, 30 minutes.33 However, the closing of U.S. trading hours is a special point in the trading day because volume is extremely high relative to the subsequent trading hours. Our proposed explanation relies on a special relationship between closing order imbalance and returns around European open. Table VI provides a ‘falsification’ test for this claim.

Daylight savings tests The results so far highlight that large negative order imbalances at the end of the U.S. trading are subsequently resolved during the overnight trading session, as new customers arrive into the market. The 24-hour nature of the e-mini market allows us to provide additional evidence on this explanation by conducting a novel test that exploits exogenous variation, from the perspective of U.S.-based market makers, in the arrival time of Asia-based clients. Specifically, we exploit the fact that while both U.S. and Europe observe daylight savings time (DST), Japan does not. From the perspective of U.S.-based market makers, clients based in Japan arrive at 19:00 during U.S. winter months (DST off) and at 20:00 during U.S. summer months (DST on). Thus, DST changes represents exogenous variation in the arrival time of Japan-based clients. Figure 11 shows that, during the second half of our sample (January 2007 – December 2020), when the trading volume during Asian opening hours is non-negligible, there is a spike in e-mini trading volume at 21:00 when DST is not active (red line) which is exactly at the opening of the Tokyo stock exchange (TSE). When DST is active, the increase in volume occurs instead at 20:00, which again corresponds to the opening of TSE in the U.S. summer. Notice, also, a secondary spike in trading volume at 22:30 when the TSE re-opens after its lunch break during U.S. winter months and at 23:30 when the TSE re-opens after the lunch break during the U.S. summer months.34 (cid:2) (cid:3) Insert figure 11 here We now test more formally whether changes in the arrival time of Asia-based clients translates into a change in the timing of overnight returns.

The sample period is 1998.1 – 2020.12. Consistent with the hypothesis that DST creates exogenous variation in the arrival time of Asia- based clients, we see that the effect of RSV moves forward by one hour when the U.S. goes from winter to summer time. To see this, consider first U.S. winter time where the DST dummy equals 0. Here, Australia opens at 18:00, TSE opens at 19:00, and Singapore opens at 20:00 (also, Shanghai opens at 20:15 and Hong Kong opens at 20:30). As expected, the effect of RSV negative in hours with market openings where new agents arrive. specifically, βSRV = {−9.34;−13.46;−6.70} for the n hours 18:00 – 19:00, 19 – 20:00 and 20:00 – 21:00.

We can likewise exploit the fact that DST is observed both in Europe and the U.S. The standard time difference between New York and London is five hours but throughout our sample period the U.S. and Europe have switched to DST at different times, typically 1 week apart. Panel (b) of table VIII reports estimates of hourly overnight returns between 24:00 – 5:00 regressed on closing signed volume and a time difference dummy: rH = µ +βRSVRSVclose+βDIFF1 +βRSV×DIFFRSV ×1 +ε n = 1,...,12, t,n n n t−1 n DIFF,t n t−1,close DIFF,t t,n where the dummy variable takes on a value of ‘0’ when the time difference between London and New York is 5 hours and a value of ‘1’ when the time difference is 4 hours. We find that the predictability of RSV disappear in the hour 2:00 – 3:00 on days where the U.S. - EU time difference only is four hours. Predictability due to an overnight return reversal shifts by two hours to 4:00 – 5:00, which is the first hour of regular trading in London and Frankfurt when the U.S. - EU time difference is 4 hours. We note that there are less than 300 trading days here; thus, the point estimate is not well measured. However, the main takeaway of the European daylight savings test remains: when the U.S. and Europe are out of their usual 5 hour time-difference synchronization, consistent with idea 35Australia does not switch to winter (summer) time at exactly the samedate where theU.S. switchesto summer (winter) time. Therefore, seen from a U.S. perspective, Australia opens at 19:00 for short periods during the spring and fall. 26",

Trading overnight reversals We conclude the paper by considering a set of trading strategies designed to exploit overnight price reversals, with and without transaction costs, and in doing so implicitly study how market makers set liquidity premiums in response to inventory shocks. The trading strategies we consider are stylized examples that expose an investor to holding the ES contract for a sub-period of each trading day compared to passively holding the ES contract. Returns on trading day j earned on a strategy that goes long the ES contract in the sub-period [t ,t ] are computed as 1 2 P −P RL = j,t2 j,t1, (10) j,[t1,t2] P j,t1 where P denotes price of the ES contract. The analogous short position earns RS = −RL. Mid quotes are used to compute returns excluding transaction costs. Transaction costs are incorporated from bid-ask quotes in Refinitiv data and returns are computed from quotes as Pbid −Pask Pask −Pbid RL = j,t2 j,t1 , RS = −1× j,t2 j,t1. (11) j,[t1,t2] Pask j,[t1,t2] Pbid j,t1 j,t1 We consider the following strategies: • long CTC: t =16:15 → t = 16:15; • long OD: t = 2:00 → t = 3:00; 1 2 1 2 • long CTO: t = 16:15 → t = 9:30; • long OD+: t = 1:30 → t = 3:30 1 2 1 2 • long OTC: t = 9:30 → t = 16:15; 1 2 We also consider a conditional trading strategy that ‘buys-the-dip’, denoted BtD, which holds the e-mini during the OD+ period but only on trading days following a negative order flow at market close (RSVclose < 0).

    "text": "Table IX (a) reports summary statistics of the trading strategies when transaction costs are excluded. Holding the ES contract continuously (the CTC strategy) since 2004.1 has yielded an average yearly return of 8.9% with a Sharpe ratio of 0.42.36 The beta is equal to 1 by definition as we use the CTC return as a proxy for the market return. CTO and OTC returns contributed an approximately equal proportion to the total return earned by a passive investor holding the index: On an annualized basis, CTO returns averaged 4.6% and OTC returns averaged 4.2%. A dissection of this magnitude is not particularly surprising in itself. However, it is surprising that OD return component is comparable in size to the CTO and OTC returns, equal to 3.8% on average. The OD strategy has a Sharpe ratio of 1.1, which outperforms the market Sharpe ratio, and arises from a combination of high excess returns and low volatility during the overnight drift period. The best performing strategy is the conditional versions of OD+ which holds the e-mini on ∼ 50% of trading days. Returns from trading the BtD strategy are considerable larger than OD+ returns, which we interpret as additional evidence in support of the inventory risk prediction that past RSV should predict subsequently higher expected returns, as new agents arrive to market and liquidity suppliers offload their long positions. In addition to larger returns, the BtD strategy return variance is significantly lower and thereby the Sharpe ratio higher. Specifically, RSVclose < 0 has a Sharpe t−1 ratio of 1.8 compared to 1.3 of OD+37. Table IX (b) reports summary statistics post transaction costs. Returns on all simple strategies are significantly lower and only the OD+ strategy has a positive Sharpe ratio. However, the BtD strategy remains highly profitable (Sharpe ratio of 1.1) because it only pays the bid-ask spread on half the trading days when returns are higher. This is exactly what we would expect from an inventory management perspective. Market makers earn the bid-ask spread, buying at the bid on negative closing RSV days and selling at the ask during the overnight trading session. In general, market makers position their limit order books to incentivize trades that bring their inventory closer to their targets, making a contrarian trade – where a client would earn the bid-ask spread – less profitable. It is important to highlight that small yet persistent intraday return seasonalities can have large low frequency effects. To illustrate this point, figure 12 depicts the cumulative returns of the CTC, OD,OD+ and BtD strategies for a one dollar investment in January 2004.

Remarkably, the BtD strategy has positive returns during the financial crises even though the strategy never shorts the market. Panel (a) displays returns for a hypothetical investor who trades without costs. Trading the OD (OD+), a one dollar initial investment in 2004 generated a portfolio value of $1.9 ($2.8) in December 2020. Panel (b) of figure 12 displays cumulative returns including transaction costs. The CTC return remains unchanged as it is a passive strategy (we only have to roll the contract at a quarterly basis and pay for the spread between the initial buy in 2004 and final sell in 2020). With transaction costs, the OD is not profitable in practice. However, the BtD strategy earns large positive returns, generating a portfolio value of $1.9 and while it does not beat a passive position in the market, it has a significantly higher Sharpe ratio and does not experience large losses related to the business cycle. (cid:104) (cid:105) Insert table IX and figure 12 here VI. Conclusion In this paper, we study returns to holding U.S. equity futures around the clock and document a large positive drift in returns accruing during the opening hours of European market regular trading hours. We argue that the large positive drift in returns is consistent with standard theories of demand for immediacy and the associated liquidity provision by risk-averse market makers. Consistent with such theories, we show that overnight returns have a strong relationship with (U.S.) end-of-day order imbalances, and that the relationship is asymmetric: while large negative order imbalances at the end of the U.S. trading day are followed by large return reversals overnight, the response to large positive end-of-day order imbalances is muted. This asymmetry in return reversals following negative and positive order imbalance days is what generates the unconditionally positive returns around European opening times. We conjecture that the asymmetry in return reversals arise due to time-varying risk bearing capacity of market makers in this market, which decreases during periods of large market sell-offs. Finally, we show that the demand for immediacy hypothesis is not only qualitatively consistent with the return and order flow patterns in the data but also provides a quantitatively-plausible explanation for the overnight drift. 29",

The Sharpe ratios uses the 4 week U.S. Treasury bill as the risk-free rate. Betas are computed using the CTC return as the market return. Returns excluding transaction cost are computed from mid quotes and returns including transaction costs are computed from the best bid and ask prices quotes. The sample period is 2004.1 — 2020.12.

Section A.2 reports robustness tests related to our market making explanation. This section repeats our main inventory risk tests with an alternative measure of order imbalance.

Supplementary Results: Overnight Drift A. Relationship to existing overnight literature Figure A.1 displays cumulative close-to-close (CTC) log returns on S&P 500 futures: $1 invested at the beginning of 1983 becomes $27 dollars by the end of 2020, translating into an annual log return of 8.65%. Decomposing into intraday versus overnight components open-to-close (OTC) log returns averaged 5.12% while close-to-open (CTO) log returns averaged 3.53% This figure updates the findings of Cliff, Cooper, and Gulen (2008) and Kelly and Clark (2011) who both document that equities earn a substantial proportion of their returns during the overnight period. Overnight return patterns are also well discussed in the financial press.38. We note here that earning a substantial overnight returns is not, in itself, that surprising. Given the length of the overnight period one would even expect the overnight period to earn the largest return if information flowed continuous as in a Black-Scholes economy. What is surprising, is that the overnight versus intraday return dissection only becomes noticeable after the advent of overnight electronic markets. Indeed, the red and blue lines track each other quite closely until after the introduction of GLOBEX and shortly before the introduction of the e-mini contract. These dates are marked by vertical dotted lines. Our discovery of an overnight drift in U.S. equities during the opening of European markets and our explanation based on demand for immediacy are closely related to this long standing puzzle.

Figure A.10 reports three pieces of suggestive evidence as to why the OP occurs only on Thursdays and Fridays: Firstly, we observe more U.S. macro announcements released at 8:30 on Thursdays and Fridays. Generally, we experience large positive returns leading up to announcements, as has been documented in the literature (Savor and Wilson (2013)). We conjecture that (short-lived) price- reversals following the macro announcements partly explain the negative opening returns. Secondly, we do not observe many FOMC announcements on Thursdays and Fridays and we also know that returns typically are positive in the hours leading up to FOMC announcements which subsequently donotrevertLuccaandMoench(2015). Thirdly, weobservemostnegativeearningsannouncements days are Thursdays and Fridays.

Supplementary Results: Section III & IV of paper Sections III and IV conducted a number of tests of the relationship between the overnight drift and trading imbalances as predicted by by inventory risk models along the lines of Grossman and Miller. In these sections, we primarily measured end-of-day (EOD) order imbalances in terms of RSV and the sample period was 1998–2020. In this part of the OA we present counterparts to the results of the main body but using SV instead. We use the sample period 2007–2020 since total volumes were relatively stationary over this period, see figure A.6.39 Using the SV measure in the early sample period would be problematic since volumes has increased by more than a factor 1000 since the early 2000’s; thus, an order imbalance of 1000 contracts would be massive in 1998 when the e-mini had just started trading but it would be small in 2020. Table A.7 reports summary statistics for hourly SV . On average, close-to-close SV is equal to t t -2,217 contracts (t-stat = -3.27), is highly volatile, and negatively skewed. Indeed, the median SV t is actually positive.

During the OD hour, SV is equal to 124 contracts with a t t-statistic of 4.23, mirroring the unconditional positive returns during this hour. Panel (c) zoom in on the signed volume during the closing hour of U.S. trading. In the following, we use the last hour preceding the maintenance to measure closing order imbalances. Thus, SVclose denotes the order t imbalance based on all trades sampled during the hour 15:15 – 16:15.

Price reversals following market rallies are much more modest thus we have uncovered a strong demand asymmetry between long and short inventory positions. Consistent with the prediction of GM that higher price uncertainty close should command a higher liquidity premium, table A.8 reports double sorts on SV and EOD t VIX and shows that the OD returns are amplified in states of higher ex-ante volatility but only following market sell-offs. Finally, table A.9 confirms high frequency return predictability arising close at the opening of European financial markets via projections onto SV . t (cid:2) (cid:3) Insert figure A.6, figure A.7, table A.8 and table A.9 here From inventory models we know that order flow predicts returns. However, the more liquid a market is, the shorter the period of predictability should be because liquidity providers can quickly trade imbalances away. In illiquid markets, such as corporate bonds, you can observe predictability over days. For the e-mini, negatively autocorrelated return predictability usually only lasts a couple of minutes. For example, figure A.8 displays 5 minute predictability regressions of returns on lagged signed volume for lags out to one hour. Only the first 5-minute lag is significantly negative. The bottom panel shows this pattern shows up in returns at the same frequency. What makes predictability by the order imbalance at the closing of U.S. trading hours special, is that the volumes transacted are much larger than those traded in the subsequent hours. Therefore, a market maker providing immediacy in this market is faced with a (potentially) large order imbalance at the end of the day that will take a long(er) time to trade away overnight, creating a longer-horizon return predictability overnight. Indeed, this is precisely the fundamental assumption of Grossman- Miller style models: market makers have to absorb excess order flow in the near term in the hope of new traders arriving at some point in the future.

This is because qID = I = −qON. Relaxing this assumption one can 0 0 solve for the case qID = I = −∆qON. The case of ∆ > 1 implies a large overnight demand while 0 0 the case ∆ < 1 implies a small overnight demand. It is straightforward to solve this model and we find that lower overnight demand will increase the magnitude of return reversals but the speed of mean reversion (between t = 0 and t = 3) is slower. Thus, lower overnight demand implies that overnight return reversals are not completed until later in the overnight session. We now turn to the potential relationship between dealer risk bearing capacity and return variance. Keeping fixed the number of dealers, we can endogenize dealer risk aversion by incorpo- rating a value-at-risk (VaR) constraint into the market maker’s problem, as is done, for example, in Danıelsson, Shin, and Zigrand (2004); Adrian and Shin (2010, 2014a) and the subsequent literature.

For a given level of the permitted t value-at-risk and permitted probability p¯, increases in volatility tighten the value-at-risk constraint, raising the effective risk aversion of value-at-risk constrained market makers. Similarly, if the permitted value-at-risk is given as a fraction of equity – so that VaR = φWMMi – rather than as a 1 dollar amount, the value-at-risk constraint is tighter when market maker equity declines. The framework above suggests that value-at-risk may serve as a reasonable proxy for market maker capital commitments to the trade. Value-at-risk is a measure of economic capital, that is, the capital required to absorb losses in excess of expected loss due to current risks. As noted in, for example, the BCBS white paper on “Range of practices and issues in economic capital frameworks”:40 Economic capital was originally developed by banks as a tool for capital allocation and performance assessment. In other words, banks use notions of economic capital to determine the composition of the asset side of their balance sheets, both from the perspective of the relative size of different lines of business as well as from the perspective of allocating to business units within each line of business. We thus view that using a measure of economic capital as being appropriate in the context of evaluating marketmakerriskbearingcapacity.

Conversations that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York conducted with major market participants following the implementation of post-crisis banking regulation suggest that large finan- cial institutions allow different business lines to make day-to-day allocation decisions independently, as long as the overall economic capital allocated to that business line (and, indeed, business unit) is not exhausted. Thus, for example, the equity futures “desk” makes day-to-day trading decisions in- dependent of the Treasury desk. We thus view using equity VaR as balancing the desired definition of what constitutes a market maker in the market against the feasibility of granularity available in the data. Acknowledging that our calculation is by its nature an approximation, we note that, even if the true economic capital allocated to the e-mini futures market is 10 times higher, our relative risk aversion estimate is comfortably within the range previously estimated in the literature. Completing the derivation, the modified market clear condition in equation A.16 becomes (cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19) µ−S µ−S 1 1 +N = I (A.32) ασ2 (α+λ )σ2 t t t from which the equilibrium EOD price is now given by (cid:18) α2 +αλ (cid:19) S = µ−Iσ2 t (A.33) 1 t N(α+λ )+α t from which we identify the modified risk bearing capacity as N(α+λ )+α t RBC = (A.34) t α2 +αλ t Then from ∂RBC 1 N t = − − (A.35) ∂α (α+λ)2 α2 ∂RBC 1 t = − (A.36) ∂λ (α+λ)2 we see the sensitivity of RBC w.r.t risk aversion is strictly larger (in magnitude) compared to the t non-constrained case, adjusted by a term that is the sensitivity of RBC w.r.t the probability of the constraint binding.

    "text": "A.4. Alternative Explanations In this subsection we link CRSP, Computstat and IBES datasets for S&P 500 firms to build in- traday and overnight earnings surprises, and consider international macro announcements from Bloomberg, and central bank announcements sourced from Bloomberg and central bank websites. We also exploit tick-by-tick trades and quotes on VIX futures (VX) sourced from Refinitiv and complemented with data from CBOE. A. Volatility Risk Figure A.11 (a) depicts average realized intraday volatility (squared log returns) from 1998.1– 2020.12 sampled at a 1-minute frequency. The intraday volatility displays the well-known U-shaped pattern for Asian, European and US trading hours where volatility is high at the beginning and at the end of each trading period Andersen, Bondarenko, Kyle, and Obizhaeva (2018). Across trading periods, the level of volatility is lowest during Asian trading hours and highest during US trading hours, relative to the average trading volume across the 3 periods. Comparing average levels for each session, we find that US hours volatility is more than twice as large as Asian hours volatility and therefore considerably larger than estimates of return volatility using close-to-close prices. The large spike in volatility at 8:30 is caused by the spike in volume observed just after US macro announcements. Figure A.11(b) plots time series of the realized volatility for each of the three trading periods. The volatility is always lowest during Asian hours and highest during US hours but the difference has diminished over time as trading volume in the overnight session has picked up. The 3 time series are highly positively correlated, indicating that volatility increases on the same days for all three trading periods. More importantly, we do not observe an obvious link between realised quantities of risk and returns. [Insert figure A.11 here] B. Overnight Liquidity To measure liquidity risk we construct hourly estimates of 1) Kyle (1985) lambda (based on returns sampled at the 1-min frequency), 2) the Amihud price impact measure and 3) the bid-ask spread. Figure A.12 depicts the average intraday patterns of these measures as well as their time series for the Asian, European and U.S. trading hours. As expected, intraday illiquidity is lowest during U.S. trading hours where the trading activity is highest and illiquidity is highest during Asian hours when the trading activity is at its lowest. The bid-ask spread is very close to the minimum tick size (0.25 index points) at all times during the trading day. All liquidity measures experience large changes throughout the sample period. Most notably, the overnight illiquidity (Asian and European hours) has decreased strongly as overnight trading activity has picked up, and today is much closer to the illiquidity level in regular U.S. trading hours. Secondly, the illiquidity increases during times of crises, as one would expect. Considering all three measures, we do not observe intraday patterns which could rationalize the OD returns with theories of liquidity risk. We see average intraday bid-ask spreads are almost always trading at the minimum tick size, equal to 0.25 index points. The spread is only significantly higher after 16.30 when trading resumes after the maintenance break and volumes are close to zero (see figure 8). The jumps in the bid-ask spread at 8:30 and 10:00 corresponds to the U.S. macro announcements which are released at these times. 9",

Figure A.14 shows the intraday depth averaged across all days in the 2009.1- 2020.12 sample. Here we observe that, at each level, the depth of the bid is equal to the depth of the ask. We also note there are three depth regimes differentiated by Asia, European and U.S. trading hours. Depth is flat in Asian hours and rises throughout European hours. At U.S. open, depth increases steeply, remains relatively flat during the regular U.S. hours and then spikes at U.S. close before dropping in the overnight market. However, we also see that the overnight market remains highly liquid. For example, until 2.00 at the top level (L1) there are, on average, 100 contracts available, which in dollar terms with the S&P level at 2000 is equal to $10 million at the bid or ask. Considering all levels, L1 - L5 depth rises to $80 million. Indeed, a highly liquid overnight market is consistent with the large overnight volumes traded in this market, which as noted in the introduction, have averaged in excess of $15 billion daily. (cid:2) (cid:3) Insert figures A.12 and A.14 here C. Overnight News We now consider if overnight news released after the U.S. cash market close are not immediately incorporated into prices during Asian hours but instead accumulate and are resolved at European open when trading volumes increase. Indeed, a large fraction of U.S. corporate earnings announce- ments are released after U.S. market close. Furthermore, Asian and European macro or central bank information released during the U.S. overnight session may signal news about U.S. growth prospects. Explanations for the overnight drift along these lines are related to a literature that shows conditional risk premia are higher on days prior to and on days of macroeconomic announce- ments.42 We study this conjecture by examining hour-by-hour returns conditional on U.S. earnings announcements., and U.S., Japanese or European macro- and central bank announcements. C.1. Earnings Announcements Wetestiffirm-specificannouncementspredictintradayreturns. Previousliterature(seee.g.Bernard and Thomas, 1989; Sadka, 2006, and the subsequent literature) has documented a positive (nega- tive) drift in stock prices of individual firms following a positive (negative) earnings announcement surprise. The earnings data is obtained from I/B/E/S and Compustat. Following Hirshleifer, Lim, and Teoh (2009), for each firm i and on day t we define the earnings surprise as A −F i,t i,t− ES = , i,t P i,t− where A is the actual earnings per share (EPS) as reported by the firm, F is the most recent median forecast of the EPS and P is the stock price of the firm at the end of the quarter. As I/B/E/S updates the professional forecasters’ expectations on a monthly basis, the shock is the difference between the actual earnings and forecasters expected earnings approximately 1 month prior to the announcement date. Scaling the shock A−F by the stock price implies that firm shocks are equally 42In the context of stock returns, Savor and Wilson (2014) show that equity risk premia are consistently larger on U.S. inflation, GDP and non-farm announcements days. Lucca and Moench (2015), on the other hand, document a drift in the U.S. stock market which precedes FOMC announcements. 10",

This is because the effect of announcements published early in the day should be incorporated into the price on that day, while announcements that occur after CTO hours could affect returns in these hours. Table A.13 reports the average returns for day t+1 after sorting on ES . We sort all trading days into 5 groups based on ES . In t t group 1, ES < 0. For group 2-4, ES is positive and increasing by group. Group 5 is for days where t t ES is zero, i.e. not a single firm announced their earnings prior to these days (this was ∼ 46% t of all trading days. The table contains a number of interesting findings. First, we see a strong monotonic positive relation between earnings shocks and CTC returns across groups. Second, no news days have the highest CTC return, equal to 4.57 % p.a, with a t-statistic of 1.86, and in this sense “no news is good news”. Third, negative shocks are not incorporated into the price until the U.S. market opens, while positive shocks are incorporated immediately during the CTO period. However, most importantly for the focus of this paper, we do not detect a post close information effect: the OD is not driven by earnings announcements as it is positive and significantly different from zero for all 5 set of days. [Insert figure A.15 and table A.13 here] C.2. Macro and Central Banks From Bloomberg’s Economic Calendar we collect dates and times for • U.S.: Non-farm Payrolls; CPI Ex Food and Energy; GDP QoQ. • EU: Unemployment Rate; PPI MoM; Industrial Production SA MoM. • U.K.: Jobless Claims Change; CPI Ex Food and Energy; QoQ. • Japan: Jobless Rate; PPI MoM; Industrial Production MoM. Announcement times are generally close to 8:30 ET in the U.S., 2:00 ET in the Eurozone, 4:30 ET in the U.K, and 19:50 ET in Japan. For central banks, we collect announcement dates and times from the websites of the following central banks: (i) FOMC; (ii) the ECB; (iii) the BoE; (iv) the BoJ. FOMC target rate announce- ments are released at or very close to 14:15 ET. ECB target announcements are at 6:45 ET, followed by a press conference at 7:30 ET. BoE announcement days often coincide with ECB days and the announcements are at 7:00 ET. Finally, BoJ announcements do not occur at a regular time but target rate decisions are generally announced between 22.00 and 1.00 ET. Our sample period is January 1998 to December 2020. We test the effect of announcements on hourly subinterval returns in a regression framework with dummy variables which take a ‘1’ on days with an announcement and ‘0’ otherwise. More specifically, the dummy takes a value of 1 if the announcement occurs within the current calendar 43EPS is earnings per share outstanding, implying that EPS/P is earnings per market cap. 44We also test specifications of ESS&P500 where firms are value weighted and result are similar. t 11",

The intercept during the OD hour (2:00–3:00) is estimated to be 1.52 bps with a t-statistic of 5.98, i.e. the drift is present on non-announcement days and thus not driven by macro announcements. Furthermore, none of the announcement dummies are statistically different from the non-announcement days in this hour. The U.K. macro dummy is economically large and significant negative at the 10% level at 3:00 (which is 8:00 in London). More generally, we fail to detect an announcement effect in any of the overnight hours. U.S. announcements occur at 8:30 and indeed we see a large positive return of 3.22 bps with a t-statistics of 2.29. Panel (b) of table A.14 reports estimates for central bank announcements. Again, the intercept is unaffected at 2:00-3:00 and we obtain an estimate of 1.40 bps with a t-statistic of 6.52. The BoE dummy is economically large and marginally significantly positive between 4:00 - 5:00 consistent with central bank announcement premium. The FOMC dummy is large but insignificant. [Insert table A.14 here] Summarizing, we fail to detect a relationship between the overnight drift and (i) earnings an- nouncements that are released after the close of the cash market, during Asian hours, or (ii) overnight news from Asian or European central bank or macro announcements; thus, it is unlikely that the overnight drift is driven by risk compensation related to announcement premia. C.3. Resolution of Uncertainty The results directly above suggest that the overnight drift is unlikely to be related to an information effect. Recent literature (see e.g. Ai and Bansal (2018) for the theoretical argument and Hu, Pan, Wang, and Zhu (2019) for suggestive empirical evidence), however, has argued that resolution uncertainty, as measured by changes in the VIX, ahead of macroeconomic announcements could explainthe pre-announcementdrift ofLuccaand Moench(2015). Morerecently, inworksubsequent to ours, Bondarenko and Muravyev (2020) postulate uncertainty resolution at the open of European markets as a possible explanation for the central empirical result of our paper (figure 2). To investigate this hypothesis, we consider changes in volatility by computing intraday and overnight VIX futures (VX) returns. Indeed, investors wanting to manage volatility risks around the clock can now trade VIX futures (VX) contracts in all time zones. VX futures are open nearly 23 hours a day, 5 days a week, trading electronically on the CBOE futures exchange. VX is closed daily from 16:15 to 16:30 and from 17:00 to 18:00 ET. On Sundays, they start at 6:00 ET. VX futures trade with a dollar value of $1000× the level of the VIX Index. Regular expirations are on the Wednesday 30 days before the corresponding S&P 500 option expiration. Due to holidays the option expiration date may be irregular and settle on the preceding Tuesday. VX futures contracts trade with monthly expirations and we consider a position that trades the front month contract and rolls into the next-to-delivery contract on the Monday preceding expiration Wednesdays and thus avoiding settlement returns. Panel (a) of figure A.16 displays the average cumulative 5-minute log returns for the front month VX contract. The intraday VX returns are relatively flat during the U.S. hours. At the 12",

AttheopeningofEuropeanmarketsVX returns are negative, equal to 50% p.a between 2:00 and 4:00 Panel (a) of table A.15 reports average overnight hourly VX returns, measured in basis points, which are highly statistically significant around European open. Focusing on VX returns at European open, one can easily rationalize a contemporaneous neg- ative co-movement with ES returns (absent a resolution of uncertainty conjecture) in terms of the ‘leverage effect’, which is the well known empirical fact that equity volatility tends to fall (rise) when equity returns are positive (negative). A common explanation for this phenomenon is due to Black (1976) and Christie (1982) who argue that companies become mechanically more leveraged as equity prices decline relative value of their debt and, as a result, their equity values become more volatile as in Merton (1974). Panel (b) of figure A.16 demonstrates the leverage effect in in- traday data by computing the intraday 1-minute correlations between ES and VX futures returns (rES ×rVX) for intervals where we observe quote updates and averaging these over all days in our t t sample. During both overnight and intraday periods the correlation is close to -80% which demon- strates that economic interpretations of resolution of uncertainty based on a contemporaneous VIX relationship is limited: “correlation does not imply causation”. [Insert figure A.16 here] More interesting, is the question of whether end-of-day order imbalances in one futures contract predict overnight returns in the other contract. Table A.15 answers this question by estimating two sets of high frequency predictability regressions. Panel (a) reports multivariate regressions with e-mini returns on the left and EOD ES and VX order imbalances on the right hand side ES rH = µ +βESSVES SVclose +βVXSVVX SVclose +ϵ , for n = 1,...,12, t,n n n t−1 n t−1 t,n while panel (b) replaces the left hand sides with VX returns VX rH = µ +βVXSVVX SVclose +βESSVES SVclose +ϵ , for n = 1,...,12. t,n n n t−1 n t−1 t,n Summarizing the table, while ES imbalances at U.S. close predict subsequent overnight returns in both the ES and the VX contracts, VX imbalances only predict overnight VX returns. Overnight ES returns between 2:00 and 3:00 are forecastable by closing ES order imbalance after controlling for VX order imbalances. VX returns, on the other hand, are predicted by ES order imbalances between 2:00 and 3:00 and then subsequently we observe some marginally significant predictability by VX order imbalances between 4:00 and 6:00, albeit with positive and negative signs. Thus, while ES and VX returns are contemporaneously mechanically linked through the lever- age effect, overnight returns in both markets are predicted by end-of-day imbalances in the ES, making the resolution of uncertainty hypothesis an unlikely explanation for the overnight drift.

Benjamini–Yekutieli Thresholds The table provides Benjamini–Yekutieli (BY) corrected significance levels (thresholds) for the null hypotheses of the S&P 500 e-mini futures average hourly log returns being zero. The BY procedure is a method to handle multiple testing problems. Specifically, it aims to control the false discovery rate which is the expected ratio of the number of type I errors to the total number of rejections of the null. The BY method is a ‘step up’ procedure that computes null specific thresholds starting from the least significant hypothesis and working up until significant alternative hypotheses are detected. This implies that ever test has a unique threshold (see Harvey, Liu, and Saretto (2020) for a recent survey of multiple testing procedures in the context of financial economic applications).
