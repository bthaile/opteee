    "text": "S&P VIX Futures Indices Index Objective The S&P VIX® Futures Index Series measures the performance of holding long and/or short positions in VIX1 futures contracts, as defined below. The S&P VIX Futures Index Series is comprised of the following indices: • S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index, S&P 500 VIX 2M Futures Index, S&P 500 VIX 3M Futures Index, and S&P 500 VIX 4M Futures Index. The indices measure the return from a rolling long position in two VIX futures contracts with adjacent maturities. Each index rolls daily throughout each month from the shorter-term VIX futures contract into the longer-term VIX futures contract. Please refer to Table 1 in Index Construction & Maintenance. • S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index (0930-1600 ET) (USD) ER. This index follows the same methodology as the S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures Index ER, with the exception of real- time calculation hours. For real-time calculation, the index follows the U.S. equity trading schedule, opening at 9:30am ET. The official final closing index levels will be the same as the S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures Index ER. • S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures Index and S&P 500 VIX 6M Futures Index. The indices measure the return from a rolling long position in four VIX futures contracts with adjacent maturities. Each index rolls daily throughout each month from the shortest-term contract into the longest-term contract while maintaining positions in the other two contracts. • S&P 500 VIX Futures Term-Structure Index. The index measures the return from taking a 100% long position in the S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures Index, and a 50% short position in the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. The weights of long and short positions are rebalanced daily. • S&P 500 VIX Front Month Futures Index. The index measures the return from a long position in the first VIX futures contract. In the three trading days prior to the futures expiration day, the index rolls to the second month contract, with 1/3 of the index being rolled each day. S&P 500 Dynamic VIX Futures Indices Index Objective The S&P 500 Dynamic VIX Futures Index series dynamically allocates between the short-term and mid- term VIX futures indices excess return to provide a cost efficient exposure to forward implied volatility. The following indices are included in the series: • S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index Excess Return • S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures Index Excess Return The S&P 500 Dynamic VIX Futures Index monitors the steepness of the implied volatility curve to provide information about future expectations of market volatility and the expected roll cost of VIX futures investments. The index dynamically allocates among positions across the VIX futures curve—to mitigate the roll yield linked to forward implied volatility. The allocations are evaluated daily, though changes in allocation may occur less frequently. 1 The VIX® methodology is the property of Cboe Options Exchange (Cboe).

    "text": "S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll Indices Index Objective The S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll Index holds positions in the first through fifth expirations of VIX futures contracts with the relative weights determined from the levels of VIX and a 15 day moving average of VIX. • S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll Index ER • S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll Index TR The S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll Index dynamically switches between a short-term VIX futures portfolio and a mid-term VIX futures portfolio in order to model a cost efficient exposure to volatility in the broad equity market. The short-term VIX futures portfolio is represented by the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. The mid-term VIX futures portfolio models a daily rolling position in the third, fourth and fifth month VIX futures contracts. The allocations are evaluated daily, though changes in allocation may occur less frequently.

    "text": "For all the indices except for the S&P 500 VIX Front Month Futures Index, the Roll Period starts after the close on the Tuesday prior to the monthly Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) VIX Futures Settlement Date (the Wednesday falling 30 calendar days before the S&P 500 option expiration for the following month) and runs through the Tuesday prior to the subsequent month’s Cboe VIX Futures Settlement Date. Thus, the indices are rolling on a continual basis. On the business date after the current Roll Period ends the following Roll Period begins. In calculating the Excess Return of each of the indices, the Contract Roll Weights (CRW ) of each of the i,t contracts in the index, on a given day, t, are determined as follows: S&P 500 VIX Short-Term / 2M / 3M / 4M Futures Index Short-Term Futures Index dr CRW =100* m,t dt dt −dr CRW =100* n,t dt where: dt = The total number of business days in the current Roll Period beginning with, and including, the starting Cboe VIX Futures Settlement Date and ending with, but excluding, the following Cboe VIX Futures Settlement Date. The number of business days stays constant in cases of a new holiday introduced intra-month or an unscheduled market closure. dr = The total number of business days within a Roll Period beginning with, and including, the following business day and ending with, but excluding, the following Cboe VIX Futures Settlement Date. The number of business days includes a new holiday introduced intra-month up to the business day proceeding such a holiday. After the close on the Tuesday, corresponding to the start of the Roll Period, all of the weight is allocated to the shorter-term (i.e., mth month) contract. Then on each subsequent business day a fraction of the mth month VIX futures holding is sold and an equal notional amount of the longer-term (nth month) VIX futures is bought. The fraction, or quantity, is proportional to the number of mth month VIX futures contracts as of the previous index roll day, and inversely proportional to the length of the current Roll Period. In this way the initial position in the mth month contract is progressively moved to the nth month one over the course of the month, until the following Roll Period starts when the old nth month VIX futures contract becomes the new mth month VIX futures contract and gets sold every day afterward as the process begins again. In addition to the transactions described above, the percentage dollar weight of each index component is calculated daily to ensure that the change in total dollar weight for the index is only due to the price change of each contract and not due to using a different weight for a contract trading at a higher price.

Short-term volatility, represented by the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index Excess Return 2. Mid-term volatility, represented by the S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures Index Excess Return Allocations On any business day, t, the S&P 500 Dynamic VIX Futures Index allocates between the short-term and mid-term volatility based on of the implied volatility term structure variable (IVTS). While the allocations are reviewed daily, they may change on a less frequent basis. The target allocations to the short-term volatility (TS) and the mid-term volatility (TM) are determined by the implied volatility term structure (IVTS) and implied volatility trend (IVT) as follows: Implied Volatility Term Target Short-Term Volatility Target Mid-Term Volatility Structure Allocation Allocation (IVTS ) (TS ) (TM ) t−1 t t Less than 90% -0.30 0.70 90% ≤ IVTS < 100% -0.20 0.80 t-1 100% ≤ IVTS < 105% 0 1.00 t-1 105% ≤ IVTS ≤ 115% 0.25 0.75 t-1 More than 115% 0.50 0.50 The S&P 500 Dynamic VIX Futures Index limits the size of changes to its daily allocation rebalancing.

S&P Dow Jones Indices: S&P VIX Futures Indices Methodology 10 S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll Indices The S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll Index dynamically switches between two long portfolios of VIX futures: 1. Short-term portfolio, represented by the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index 2. Mid-term portfolio, illustrated below Short-Term Portfolio The short-term portfolio assumes a long position in the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index, which models a rolling long position in the first and second month VIX futures contracts. It rolls continuously throughout each month from the first month VIX futures contract into the second month VIX futures contract. On any business day, the excess return of the short-term portfolio is calculated as illustrated in the S&P 500 VIX Futures Index Methodology document. Mid-Term Portfolio The mid-term portfolio assumes a rolling long position in the third, fourth and fifth month VIX futures contracts. It rolls continuously throughout each month from the third month contract into the fifth month contract, while maintaining positions in the fourth month contracts. On any business day, t, the excess return of the mid-term portfolio (MidER) is calculated as follows: t ( ) MidER = MidER  1+CDR (1) t t−1 t where: MidER = The Excess Return of the Mid-Term Portfolio on the preceding business day, defined t-1 as any date on which the index is calculated.

    "text": "The Roll Period starts after the close on the Tuesday prior to the monthly Cboe VIX Futures Settlement Date (the Wednesday falling 30 calendar days before the S&P 500 option expiration for the following month) and runs through the Tuesday prior to the subsequent month’s Cboe VIX Futures Settlement Date. Thus, the mid-term portfolio is rolling on a continual basis. On the business date after the current Roll Period ends the following Roll Period will begin. In calculating the Excess Return of the mid-term portfolio, the Contract Roll Weights (CRW ) of each of i,t the contracts in the portfolio, on a given day, t, are determined as follows: dr CRW =50%* 3,t dt CRW =50% 4,t dt −dr CRW =50%* 5,t dt where: dt = The total number of business days in the current Roll Period beginning with, and including, the starting Cboe VIX Futures Settlement Date and ending with, but excluding, the following Cboe VIX Futures Settlement Date. The number of business days stays constant in cases of a new holiday introduced intra-month or an unscheduled market closure. dr =The total number of business days within a Roll Period beginning with, and including, the following business day and ending with, but excluding, the following Cboe VIX Futures Settlement Date. The number of business days includes a new holiday introduced intra-month up to the business day preceding such a holiday. After the close on the Tuesday, corresponding to the start of the Roll Period, an equal weight is allocated to the third and fourth month contracts. Then on each subsequent business day a fraction of the third month VIX futures holding is sold and an equal notional amount of the fifth month VIX futures is bought. The fraction, or quantity, is proportional to the number of third month VIX futures contracts as of the previous index roll day, and inversely proportional to the length of the current Roll Period. In this way the initial position in the third month contract is progressively moved to the fifth month contract over the course of the month, until the following Roll Period start when the old fourth month VIX futures contract becomes the new third month VIX futures contract and gets sold every day afterwards as the process begins again. In addition to the transactions described above, the weight of each index component is also adjusted every day to ensure that the change in total dollar exposure for the index is only due to the price change of each contract and not due to using a different weight for a contract trading at a higher price. For the purpose of the historical mid-term portfolio calculations, when the ith future was not listed on day t, the closing price on the previous day, t-1, was used.

    "text": "Announcements of the daily index values are made after the market close each day. Holiday Schedule The indices are calculated daily from 7:00 PM (day prior) to 4:00 PM New York Time, excluding holidays and weekends. A complete holiday schedule for the year is available at www.spglobal.com/spdji. Rebalancing The Index Committee may change the date of a given rebalancing for reasons including market holidays occurring on or around the scheduled rebalancing date. Any such change will be announced with proper advance notice where possible. Unexpected Exchange Closures and New Holidays In situations where an exchange is forced to close early due to unforeseen events, such as computer or electric power failures, weather conditions or other events, S&P Dow Jones Indices calculates the value of the index based on the most recent prior closing futures price published by the Cboe Futures Exchange and the roll for that day is carried to the next Cboe business day as described in the Contract Rebalancing section. If an exchange fails to open due to unforeseen circumstances, S&P Dow Jones Indices may determine not to publish the index for that day. The daily roll percentage is determined on the day when the index is fully rolled from the first month contract to the second month contract and stays constant throughout the month. If the index is not calculated or published due to unforeseen circumstances during the month, the unrolled potion for that day is carried to the next Cboe business day. It does not change the daily roll percentage on the remaining days of the month. In situations where an exchange introduces a holiday during the month of the index calculation the index is not be published and the roll for that day is carried to the next Cboe business day as described in the Contract Rebalancing section.

S&P Dow Jones Indices: S&P VIX Futures Indices Methodology 22 Appendix III Historical Assumptions Prior to April 2008, not all consecutive first to seventh month VIX futures were listed. For the purpose of the historical S&P 500 VIX Futures Index series calculations, the following assumptions have been made in interpolating VIX futures contract prices from near-by listed contracts. When the ith future was not listed, but i th+1 and i th-1 futures were listed, the following interpolation has been assumed: BDays(T −T ) DCRP 2 =DCRP 2 + i i−1 (DCRP 2 −DCRP 2) i,t i−1,t BDays(T −T ) i+1,t i−1,t i+1 i−1 When ith and i th+1 futures were not listed, but i th+2 and i th-1 futures were listed, the following interpolation has been assumed: BDays(T −T ) DCRP 2 =DCRP 2 + i i−1 (DCRP 2 −DCRP 2) i,t i−1,t BDays(T −T ) i+2,t i−1,t i+2 i−1 When i th, i th+1 and i th+2 futures were not listed, the following extrapolation has been assumed: BDays(T −T ) DCRP 2 =DCRP 2 + i i−1 (DCRP 2 −DCRP 2) i,t i−1,t BDays(T −T ) i−1,t i−2,t i−1 i−2 where: T = Last Trade Day of the ith VIX Futures contract i BDays = Number of Business days between VIX Futures Last Trade Days S&P Dow Jones Indices: S&P VIX Futures Indices Methodology 23",

    "text": "Performance Disclosure/Back-Tested Data Where applicable, S&P Dow Jones Indices and its index-related affiliates (“S&P DJI”) defines various dates to assist our clients in providing transparency. The First Value Date is the first day for which there is a calculated value (either live or back-tested) for a given index. The Base Date is the date at which the index is set to a fixed value for calculation purposes. The Launch Date designates the date when the values of an index are first considered live: index values provided for any date or time period prior to the index’s Launch Date are considered back-tested. S&P DJI defines the Launch Date as the date by which the values of an index are known to have been released to the public, for example via the company’s public website or its data feed to external parties. For Dow Jones-branded indices introduced prior to May 31, 2013, the Launch Date (which prior to May 31, 2013, was termed “Date of introduction”) is set at a date upon which no further changes were permitted to be made to the index methodology, but that may have been prior to the Index’s public release date. Please refer to the methodology for the Index for more details about the index, including the manner in which it is rebalanced, the timing of such rebalancing, criteria for additions and deletions, as well as all index calculations. Information presented prior to an index’s launch date is hypothetical back-tested performance, not actual performance, and is based on the index methodology in effect on the launch date. However, when creating back-tested history for periods of market anomalies or other periods that do not reflect the general current market environment, index methodology rules may be relaxed to capture a large enough universe of securities to simulate the target market the index is designed to measure or strategy the index is designed to capture. For example, market capitalization and liquidity thresholds may be reduced. In addition, forks have not been factored into the back-test data with respect to the S&P Cryptocurrency Indices. For the S&P Cryptocurrency Top 5 & 10 Equal Weight Indices, the custody element of the methodology was not considered; the back-test history is based on the index constituents that meet the custody element as of the Launch Date. Back-tested performance reflects application of an index methodology and selection of index constituents with the benefit of hindsight and knowledge of factors that may have positively affected its performance, cannot account for all financial risk that may affect results and may be considered to reflect survivor/look ahead bias. Actual returns may differ significantly from, and be lower than, back-tested returns. Past performance is not an indication or guarantee of future results. Typically, when S&P DJI creates back-tested index data, S&P DJI uses actual historical constituent-level data (e.g., historical price, market capitalization, and corporate action data) in its calculations. As ESG investing is still in early stages of development, certain datapoints used to calculate certain ESG indices may not be available for the entire desired period of back-tested history. The same data availability issue could be true for other indices as well. In cases when actual data is not available for all relevant historical periods, S&P DJI may employ a process of using “Backward Data Assumption” (or pulling back) of ESG data for the calculation of back-tested historical performance. “Backward Data Assumption” is a process that applies the earliest actual live data point available for an index constituent company to all prior historical instances in the index performance. For example, Backward Data Assumption inherently assumes that companies currently not involved in a specific business activity (also known as “product involvement”) were never involved historically and similarly also assumes that companies currently involved in a specific business activity were involved historically too. The Backward Data Assumption allows the hypothetical back-test to be extended over more historical years than would be feasible using only actual data. For more information on “Backward Data Assumption” please refer to the FAQ. The methodology and factsheets of any index that employs backward assumption in the back-tested history will explicitly state so. The methodology will include an Appendix with a table setting forth the specific S&P Dow Jones Indices: S&P VIX Futures Indices Methodology 24",

    "text": "data points and relevant time period for which backward projected data was used. Index returns shown do not represent the results of actual trading of investable assets/securities. S&P DJI maintains the index and calculates the index levels and performance shown or discussed but does not manage any assets. Index returns do not reflect payment of any sales charges or fees an investor may pay to purchase the securities underlying the Index or investment funds that are intended to track the performance of the Index. The imposition of these fees and charges would cause actual and back-tested performance of the securities/fund to be lower than the Index performance shown. As a simple example, if an index returned 10% on a US $100,000 investment for a 12-month period (or US $10,000) and an actual asset-based fee of 1.5% was imposed at the end of the period on the investment plus accrued interest (or US $1,650), the net return would be 8.35% (or US $8,350) for the year. Over a three-year period, an annual 1.5% fee taken at year end with an assumed 10% return per year would result in a cumulative gross return of 33.10%, a total fee of US $5,375, and a cumulative net return of 27.2% (or US $27,200).
