Abstract: We examine the role of the media in influencing retail investor trade and stock price reactions to news during the “quiet period” of limited firm disclosure after an initial public offering (IPO). In its efforts to protect investors, the SEC restricts communications made by firms and analysts during this time period. However, the media is not subject to the same restrictions. We find that more media coverage during this period is associated with more purchases by retail investors and that such purchases are attention-driven, rather than information-based. We also find that retail investor purchases are negatively associated with stock returns at the firm’s first earnings announcement post-IPO. These post-IPO results are stronger than the results for the same firms one year later and for firms following seasoned equity offerings (SEOs), suggesting that the IPO quiet period exacerbates the relation between news coverage and retail trade. Together, our results suggest that post-IPO media coverage leads to worse investing outcomes for retail investors. Thus, while the SEC’s concern regarding information outside of the prospectus influencing investment appears justified, the inability of the SEC to control all information sources related to an offering potentially limits the usefulness of the SEC’s quiet period restrictions.

    "text": "As part of its mission of protecting investors and maintaining efficient markets, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that the IPO prospectus be the primary source of information related to a new security offering. By restricting firms from separately disseminating additional information, the SEC seeks to prevent unequal access to information and to reduce the likelihood that investors are influenced by promotional disclosures. However, while the SEC can restrict a firm’s communications, the media operates outside the purview of SEC control. How the media influences retail investor trading following an IPO is unclear. Prior literature finds that the media enhances a firm’s information environment by disseminating information more broadly (see, e.g., Bushee et al. 2010, Engelberg and Parsons 2011, Blankespoor et al. 2018). Thus, the media can potentially help retail investors by providing information on companies with limited operating histories and a limited ability to communicate after the IPO. Alternatively, media coverage could potentially hurt retail investors in exactly the ways the SEC seeks to prevent by encouraging investors to purchase newly issued securities based on incomplete information, without fully considering the balanced and comprehensive information of the prospectus. We investigate whether the media facilitates or impairs the SEC’s mission of protecting investors by examining how media coverage relates to retail investor trade and stock price reactions to news in the period immediately following a firm’s IPO. The SEC enforces a variety of restrictions on what a company and related parties, such as underwriters, can communicate to the public in the “quiet period” around an IPO. Following an IPO, securities regulations and agreements with underwriters effectively restrict firms in the communications they can make for 25 days following the offering. Security analysts are also restricted by FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) rules from issuing research 1",

    "text": "reports during this time.1 The goal of these restrictions is to make the statutory prospectus the primary source of information regarding the issue and to ensure that all investors have access to essentially the same information. We examine the role of the media in the quiet period using a sample of 982 IPOs between 2007 and 2016. We follow Blankespoor et al. (2018) and use intraday TAQ data to identify retail investor trades using the Boehmer et al. (2016) method, which classifies trades with a TAQ exchange code of “D” and prices with just above a round penny as retail sales and those with prices just below a round penny as retail purchases. This approach is preferable to using small trade sizes (e.g., less than $5,000) to identify retail trades given the increasing tendency of sophisticated investors to split up trades (Cready, Kumas, and Subasi 2014). However, we use large trade sizes (greater than $50,000) as a benchmark to assess whether retail investors are reacting differently than sophisticated investors during the quiet period. We measure media coverage using RavenPack, which allows us to classify articles based on sentiment (positive vs. negative) and information content (novel news vs. dissemination). First, we test whether media coverage is associated with retail investor trades in post-IPO firms during the quiet period. Given that retail traders are unlikely to receive an initial allocation in the IPO, any effect of media coverage is likely to trigger retail purchases as opposed to sales (e.g. Lee 1992). Consistent with this, we find that media coverage is positively associated with retail investor purchases. We propose two potential channels for this result: an “information effect” (i.e., media coverage provides valuable new information to retail investors) and an 1 The length of the “quiet period” related to analyst reports has changed over time. Since September 25, 2015, affiliated analysts must wait at least 10 days to distribute research reports. Prior to this date, the quiet period was 40 days for analysts whose firm acted as a manager in the offering, and 25 days for other affiliated analysts. The JOBS Act eliminates any restrictions on research reports for emerging growth companies (EGC’s). However, due to the prospectus delivery requirements, as later discussed, analysts typically wait at least 25 days. 2",

    "text": "“attention effect” (i.e., media coverage stimulates retail investor trading irrespective of the news in the article; see, e.g., Barber and Odean 2008). While the attention effect predicts any visibility prompts retail purchasing, the information effect predicts only positive sentiment news increases retail demand for shares. Consistent with an attention effect, we find that both positive and negative sentiment news is significantly associated with retail investor purchases immediately after the IPO. Thus, rather than providing useful information to retail traders during the quiet period, the media appears to function as an attention-grabbing mechanism that triggers greater retail purchases regardless of the nature of the news. Next, we examine how retail trade relates to abnormal stock returns at a firm’s first earnings announcement post-IPO. If retail investor purchases in advance of the initial earnings announcement reflect attention-driven trade, this coordinated retail trade could exert upward pressure on prices (Barber and Odean 2008, Da et al. 2011), which must then reverse at some future information event, such as an earnings announcement. Consistent with this interpretation, we find a negative association between retail purchases and stock returns at the first earnings announcement. Further, we find that this relation is strongest when media coverage is high. Taken together, the evidence suggests that media coverage of a firm drives retail investor buying, which in turn pushes up the price of the stock. At the earnings announcement, additional information related to firm performance is revealed and the stock price adjusts to reflect fundamental value. While this interpretation of our findings requires some friction preventing more efficient prices, these frictions likely exist in the IPO setting in the form of price support from the underwriter and higher costs associated with short-selling (e.g. Aggarwal 2000; Geczy et al. 2002). 3",

    "text": "Finally, we examine whether the effect of media coverage on retail trade is stronger during the IPO quiet period than during other time windows. First, we compare each firm’s post- IPO period to the same period one year later. We find that the associations between news coverage and retail trade are significantly weaker one year later than they were during the quiet period. Moreover, the association between retail trade and earnings announcement returns is effectively zero at the earnings announcement one year subsequent to the IPO. Next, we compare our IPO sample to a sample of firms undergoing a seasoned equity offering (SEO). Again, we find the association between news coverage and retail trade is weaker and that no significant association exists between retail trade and earnings announcement returns. Thus, the results suggest that the post-IPO quiet period exacerbates the associations between news coverage and retail trade, consistent with media coverage assuming a more prominent role during the quiet period due to the lack of alternative information sources. This attention-driven trade appears to be particularly detrimental to retail traders during this time window due to lower price efficiency. Our results indicate that media coverage of an IPO firm can result in worse investing outcomes for retail traders. This finding supports the SEC’s concern regarding issuers inappropriately promoting securities or otherwise “conditioning the market.” However, it is important to highlight that we study the effect of the media, which is outside the control of the SEC, not the effect of firm disclosure. Thus, we cannot conclude that the SEC restricting disclosure post-IPO has the effect of protecting investors. It is possible if these restrictions were loosened, firms could make disclosures that would offset the effects of media coverage during this period. Alternatively, additional disclosure by firms could simply result in additional attention-driven trade. 4",

    "text": "By offering insights into how retail traders react to increased media coverage in the post- IPO setting, we contribute to the larger accounting literature by furthering our understanding of the costs and benefits of securities regulation. While an expansive literature focuses on the benefits of more transparent firm disclosures, other work documents that high compliance costs discourage some firms from accessing capital markets (e.g. Bushee and Leuz 2005, Engel et al. 2007, Leuz et al. 2008). Our findings contribute to this literature by documenting another cost associated with allowing unfettered information production: attention-driven retail trade that on average associates negatively with future returns. While this is not a cost borne by the firm, it is a cost from the perspective of a regulator whose mission includes investor protection. 2. Institutional Background The SEC has a three-part mission of protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation. To this end, the SEC requires most securities sold in the United States to be registered, with firms disclosing information related to their business and financial position prior to offering a security for sale and on an ongoing basis thereafter.2 These regulations establish a minimum level of information that firms must make available to all investors. By reducing the gap between informed and uninformed traders, regulation can protect otherwise uninformed traders and increase investor participation—or decrease the cost of participation—in financial markets (e.g. Healy and Palepu, 2001). While the SEC sets minimum disclosure thresholds to protect investors and maintain fair markets, the SEC also limits disclosure in certain situations to achieve these same goals. In particular, around a firm’s IPO, the SEC limits a firm’s communications with market 2 The SEC provides a variety of exemptions from registration for small issues and issues to sophisticated investors: https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/qasbsec.htm#noreg. 5",

These restrictions seek to ensure that all investors have access to the same information. In the IPO setting, the SEC has established that the prospectus should be the primary source of information related to an offering. In this way, the SEC provides investors with a common, regulated source of information. By restricting firms from separately disseminating additional information, the SEC seeks to prevent unequal access to information and to reduce the likelihood that investors are influenced by material that is more promotional in nature.3 Restrictions on firm communications begin when the firm decides to undergo an IPO (see Figure 1 for a timeline). As some uncertainty may exist regarding the exactness of this date, the SEC offers safe harbor for certain communications made more than 30 days prior to filing a registration statement (Rule 163A). Once the registration statement is filed, the firm can make written offers to sell securities only through a conforming prospectus.4 This time period, which ends when the registration statement is declared effective, is sometimes referred to as the “waiting period.” Note an “offer” to sell securities is very broadly defined as “every attempt or offer to dispose of, or solicitation of an offer to buy, a security or interest in a security, for value”.5 Written offers are also somewhat broadly defined, as most electronic communications, including radio and TV, are interpreted as “written.” These restrictions effectively limit firms from making additional disclosure outside of the regulatory prospectus. 3 However, the SEC specifically provides safe harbor in the 2005 Securities Offering Reform for firms to continue releasing factual business information. 4 Post-JOBS Act, ECGs are allowed to have oral and written communications with qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited investors in order to gauge their interest in purchasing securities either prior to or after filing a registration statement (e.g. “testing the waters”). However, the ability to communicate with smaller investors was unchanged. 5 https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/77b 6",

    "text": "While these restrictions lapse for firms once the offering is complete, underwriters have an obligation to deliver a current prospectus with all shares for 25 days following the offering, even in conjunction with secondary market sales (the “prospectus delivery window” or “post- effective period”).6 Firms therefore refrain from (and underwriting agreements restrict) the disclosure of information that would cause the prospectus to be misleading or incomplete during this 25-day window following the IPO. If a firm does make a disclosure which compels the firm to update the prospectus, this material will be subject to liability under Section 12(a)(2) [a liability for negligence],7 as opposed to the lesser liability under the higher standard of Rule 10b- 5 [a liability for fraud].8 A desire to avoid this greater liability further suppresses disclosure. Together, these regulations effectively restrict firm disclosure for 25 calendar days following an IPO. The goal of these restrictions is to make the statutory prospectus the primary source of information regarding the issue. Thus, all investors should have access to essentially the same information. The SEC has somewhat liberalized these rules with the 2005 Securities Offering Reform.9 In particular, firms can now use a “free writing prospectus” after filing a registration statement to release information that would have previously constituted an illegal prospectus. For example, in 2004, Salesforce.com had its IPO delayed when its CEO granted an interview for an article appearing in the New York Times. Post-reform, this type of interview and coverage would be allowed given the article or its contents were included in a free-writing prospectus.10 In 6 https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/230.174 7 https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/77l 8 https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/240.10b-5 9 Shroff et al.

    "text": "practice, free-writing prospectuses are rarely used post-IPO. This is likely because the free- writing prospectus creates a higher-level of liability under Section 12(a)(2). Quiet period regulations also limit the ability of security analysts to provide information about the firm. Overseen by the SEC, FINRA establishes rules governing the quiet period as it relates to analyst research reports. In 2002, FINRA passed a rule that an analyst whose firm acted as a manager or co-manager in an offering had to wait 40 days before issuing a research report.11 Later, this rule was amended to state that, in addition, affiliated analysts whose firm did not act as a manager or co-manager still must wait 25 days after the IPO to issue a research report.12 In practice, a de facto 25 day quiet period already existed for all analysts because of the 25-day prospectus delivery window, as previously discussed. As part of the JOBS Act in 2012, the analyst report quiet period was eliminated for emerging growth companies (EGCs). Since September 25, 2015, the post-IPO quiet period for all other firms was reduced to 10 days per FINRA rule 2241.13 However, due to the prospectus delivery requirements, the effective quiet period is likely to remain at 25 days for all IPOs. 3. Hypothesis Development Prior literature examines the role of visibility in explaining a firm’s returns. Merton (1987) presents a model in which investors can only include securities they know about in their individual portfolios. Consistent with the predictions of this model, Lehavy and Sloan (2008) find that changes in the number of institutional owners explain stock returns.

    "text": "stocks of which they are aware, other work suggests that investors – and retail investors in particular – will behave in a more heuristic manner. Barber and Odean (2008) propose a model in which investors are more likely to purchase than sell attention-grabbing stocks, which results in greater losses associated with uninformed trade. Bushee and Friedman (2016) present a model in which some investors are more influenced by non-informative signals, and the degree of this influence depends on the relative quality of available informative signals. This suggests non- informative, attention-grabbing events may be particularly impactful in the IPO setting, given the firm’s less developed information environment. While a firm may attempt to mitigate effects of a less developed information environment through voluntary disclosure (e.g. Barth et al. 2017), the quiet period limits a firm’s ability to disclose in the period immediately following the IPO. Prior work finds that, due to the SEC’s quiet period restrictions on firm and analyst communication, any additional disclosure can have a significant impact on trading and stock prices. For example, Liu, Sherman, and Zhang (2014) find that pre-IPO media coverage is important enough to an IPO firm’s information environment that it is significantly related to the firm’s long-term value, liquidity, analyst coverage, and institutional ownership. Cedergren (2017) examines firm communication around the quiet period expiration, and finds that the stock returns reflect greater firm-specific information (as measured by stock return synchronicity) after the quiet period expires, especially for firms that increase firm-initiated press releases after quiet period expiration.14 Thus, by providing additional information outside of the SEC’s control, the media could serve as an important source of information during the quiet period. 14 Prior work also examines how blockholders and institutional investors exploit this information asymmetry around IPOs. Chemmanur, Hu, and Huang (2010) find that institutional investors possess significant private information as their sales of allocations in the first year predict longer-run performance. Boehmer, Boehmer, and Fishe (2006) find that institutional investors receive larger allocations than retail investors in firms with better long-run performance, and that institutional investor flipping of shares in the immediate aftermarket predicts future returns. 9",

    "text": "Prior work finds that the media plays a key role in shaping a firm's information environment. Greater dissemination of information through media coverage is associated with a reduction in information asymmetry and an increase in activity by small traders (e.g., Bushee, et al. 2010, Engelberg and Parsons 2011, Blankespoor, et al. 2018). Media coverage also improves price efficiency with respect to specific information releases, such as cash flow numbers, management guidance, insider trading disclosures, and analyst opinions (Drake, Guest, and Twedt 2014; Rees, Sharp, and Twedt 2015; Twedt 2016; and Rogers, Skinner, and Zechman 2016). Thus, media coverage has the potential to improve a firm’s information environment and price efficiency in the post-IPO period. We are specifically interested in how media coverage affects retail investor trading during the IPO quiet period. Prior literature generally finds that retail investors underperform the market when they engage in active trading. Barber and Odean (2000) use proprietary data from a discount brokerage to show that households with more frequent portfolio turnover underperform the market to a greater extent. Using the same data, Barber and Odean (2008) find greater retail investor purchases in stocks that attract more attention; i.e., firms with greater media coverage, extreme one-day price movements, etc. Also using this data, Taylor (2010) finds that individual investor participation increases around earnings announcements, but that these individual investor trades experience significant losses (that are bigger than losses for non-earnings announcement trades). Taking a somewhat different approach, Da, Engelberg, and Gao (2011) measure retail investor attention using Google search volume and find that higher search volumes are associated with a short-term price run up followed by longer-term reversal. More relevant to our setting, they also find that search volume is associated with a stronger pattern of IPO underpricing, followed by longer-term underperformance. 10",

    "text": "Based on this prior work, we first predict that greater media coverage will be associated with greater retail trading during the quiet period. Media coverage provides additional information during the quiet period and additional visibility for the newly-public firm, both of which should increase the likelihood of retail investor trade. Further, in the post-IPO setting, we predict that the greater media coverage will not affect retail buying and selling equally, but will primarily affect retail purchases. Immediately post-IPO, retail traders are unlikely to own shares to sell, and thus media coverage only has the potential to affect purchasing decisions, as these investors are unlikely to take short positions (Barber and Odean 2008). We also predict the effect of media coverage on retail trading will be most pronounced in the period immediately following the IPO and will diminish thereafter. As previously discussed, quiet period restrictions limit information releases, making any media coverage more salient. As the quiet period restrictions lapse and information sources closer to the firm (i.e., management and analysts) become available, the media likely contributes less information as a percentage of the total information available for a firm. Further, after the publicity and visibility provided by the IPO, additional media coverage likely brings the firm to the attention of fewer investors for the first time, generating relatively less trade. Next, we examine whether retail traders react to media coverage because of the information content of the news (the “information hypothesis”) or because the news brings a stock to their attention that was not previously in their decision set (the “attention hypothesis”). We test these competing hypotheses by testing how the relation between media coverage and retail investor trade varies with the sentiment of the news. Under the information hypothesis, positive news stories are most likely to trigger purchasing, while negative news stories reduce retail demand for a stock. However, under the attention hypothesis, both positive and negative 11",

    "text": "news stories prompt retail buying because attention-driven trade does not respond to the content of the news article, but rather to the visibility the news article gives to the firm (Lee 1992, Barber and Odean 2008). Finally, we test hypotheses for how post-IPO retail trade relates to abnormal returns at the firm’s first earnings announcement. First, it is possible retail traders anticipate and trade on news that will be revealed at the earnings announcement. In this case, retail trade occurring after the IPO but prior to the first earnings announcement would be positively associated with returns at the earnings announcement. A positive association between trade and returns would also be consistent with retail traders utilizing momentum strategies, or having a preference for riskier securities (e.g. Bushee and Goodman 2007). Alternatively, if retail trade reflects uninformed, attention-driven trade, all media coverage would result in coordinated retail purchasing, putting upward pressure on a firm’s stock price (Da et al. 2011). In this scenario, we would expect to observe a negative association between retail trade post-IPO and future returns at the first earnings announcement. This negative association between retail trade and subsequent returns requires some degree of market frictions to prevent prices from correcting prior to the earnings announcement. Consistent with the presence of such frictions, prior literature documents that coordinated trade by retail investors can move prices (Barber and Odean 2008). This effect may be particularly salient in the period immediately after the IPO, as the lead underwriter typically discourages parties who received an initial allocation from “flipping,” or immediate selling of shares when demand is weak (Aggarwal 2000) and short-selling costs may be high (Geczy et al. 2002). 12",

    "text": "We gather our sample from the intersection of several databases. We collect information on IPOs from SDC Platinum, financial information from Compustat, earnings announcement dates from IBES, market data from CRSP and TAQ, and news articles from RavenPack. Our sample begins in 2007, which is when RavenPack’s Web Edition begins coverage. We exclude IPOs with offer prices below $5.00 and IPOs for banks (SIC codes 602X and 603X). We also require that the security issuance has a share code of 11 or 12 in CRSP, which excludes ADRs, unit offers, closed-end funds, and REITs. From CRSP and TAQ, we require coverage of the security for 126 trading-days following the IPO date. We require that RavenPack coverage of a firm begins by the date of the firm’s IPO. We take the earnings announcement date from IBES, adjusting to the next trading date if the announcement time occurs after trading hours. In cases where the IBES earnings announcement date disagrees with the date from Compustat, we hand collect the date from firms’ press releases. Together, these restrictions result in a sample of 982 IPOs during the 2007 to 2016 period. Panel A of Table 1 shows the number of IPOs by year in our sample period. The highest number of IPOs was in 2014 (about 21 percent of our sample), while there were very few IPOs after the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 (two and four percent of our sample, respectively). Several IPOs from 2016 are omitted due to the firms not yet being listed on CRSP. Other than these years, IPOs are fairly evenly distributed (8-16 percent per year). We use this sample of IPOs to test the relation between retail trades and media coverage in two ways. We perform some analyses at the firm-level, aggregating our measures of trading activity and media coverage from the IPO date to the first post-IPO earnings announcement. This 13",

    "text": "analysis involves one observation per firm and yields a sample size of 982. Additionally, we conduct within-firm analyses using daily levels of retail trade and media coverage in a specification with firm fixed-effects. This specification directly controls for time-invariant firm attributes, such as the level of visibility a firm has going into its IPO. This analysis uses a sample of 124,714 firm-day observations from the IPO date (day 0) to 126 trading days after the IPO. We look at the period within 126 trading days of the IPO to obtain a balanced panel for the within-firm analysis. The maximum possible number of days between the IPO and the first earnings announcement is 180 calendar days: a 90-day quarter plus a 90-day filing deadline for a 10-K of a non-accelerated filer. Thus, we include a half-year, or 126 trading days, for each firm. By contrast, the firm-level measures reflect the number of days between the IPO and first earnings announcement, which varies across firms. Figure 2 gives the timing of each firm’s first earnings announcement following the IPO. Only eight percent of earnings announcements occur prior the end of the 25-day quiet period, and 33 percent occur within 40 calendar days of the IPO. Figure 3 shows the timing of the quarter-end associated with these earnings announcements. For 52 percent of the sample, the quarter ended prior to the IPO, with 86 firms (nine percent of the sample) having quarter ends within five days following the IPO. Overall, there do not appear to be distinct patterns of firms timing their IPO relative to their quarter end. 4.2. Trade Measures We construct our measure of retail trades from TAQ data. While prior literature has used trade size to identify retail trading (e.g., trades less than $5,000 are assumed to be retail-initiated trades; Lee and Radhakrishna 2000; Barber, Odean, and Zhu 2009), the prevalence of algorithmic trading and the splitting of orders by institutional investors renders trade size a less 14",

    "text": "reliable measure (Cready, Kumas, and Subasi 2014). Therefore, we follow Boehmer, Jones, and Zhang (2016) to identify retail trade. This method exploits the fact that retail trades tend to be executed in a specific way. In particular, most retail trades do not take place on registered exchanges. Instead, a broker (e.g. Charles Schwab) often fills retail trades internally from its own inventory, or sends the trade to a wholesaler (e.g. Citadel). When this occurs, the trade shows up in TAQ with an exchange code of “D”. Further, when trades are filled in this way, the broker or wholesaler will often give a small amount of price improvement (a fraction of a cent) over the existing best bid or offer. Thus, purchase orders are filled just below a full cent and sales orders are filled just above a whole cent. In contrast, orders on exchanges must have full cent prices, per Regulation NMS. Regulation NMS also requires limit orders to be priced in round pennies. Thus, following Boehmer et al. (2016), we classify trades with TAQ exchange code of “D” and prices with just above a round penny (fraction of a cent between zero and 0.4, exclusive) as retail sales and those with prices just below a round penny (fraction of a cent between 0.6 and one, exclusive) as retail purchases. Within a given trading day, we define the variable Net Retail as the sum of shares classified as retail purchases less the sum of shares classified as retail sales, scaled by the total of number of shares traded that day. We then multiply by 100 to express the number as a percentage. In our firm-level analysis, we sum all retail purchases and subtract all retail sales from the IPO date up until the earnings announcement, and then divide by the total share volume during this time frame. We then partition retail trading activity into deciles based on this measure and divide by 10, so Net Retail takes values from 0.1 to 1, in increments of 0.1. Higher values of this variable reflect greater retail purchases. 15",

    "text": "We contrast retail trades to large trades in order to provide a benchmark for sophisticated investor trading, which we assume will be more informationally-efficient. We measure large trades as trades greater than or equal to $50,000. While some institutional investors split trades into smaller orders, making us unsure whether small orders reflect retail trade, large trades should only reflect institutional investor activity. We sign large trades using the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm. Similar to Net Retail, we calculated Net Large as large purchases less large sales, as a percentage of total trades. 4.3. Media Coverage Measures We construct our measures of news releases from the RavenPack Full Edition database, which includes the union of RavenPack’s Dow Jones, Web, and PR Editions. We require that RavenPack assigns the story a relevance of 100, indicating that the firm was featured prominently in the news story. We also exclude several news classifications to reduce the number of news stories that have limited visibility or information content. Specifically, we exclude stories where the RavenPack assigned category equals “earnings”, “revenue”, or “conference-participant” (the first two categories typically relate to firms announcing the date of an upcoming earnings announcement, and the third relates to announcements of participation in upcoming conferences); RavenPack type contains “IPO” or “public-offering” (stories announcing the completion of the offering) or equals “trading” (trading halts and resumptions); or RavenPack group equals “insider trading”, “order-imbalances”, or “investor-relations” (the last typically being stories about upcoming conference calls or institutions reporting holdings). Finally, we exclude firm press releases and articles related to analyst ratings as these represent firm-initiated and analyst-initiated news. We separately control for this firm- and analyst- initiated news in our analyses. 16",

    "text": "We construct three measures capturing different dimensions of news coverage: All News, Novel News, and Dissemination. All News is the count of all news stories on a given day. News events occurring after trading hours are adjusted to the next trading day. For the firm-level analysis, we sum all news stories from the IPO up until the earnings announcement, and then divide by the number of days in this time period. The logarithm of this sum plus one is used in the analysis. Novel News is calculated in a similar way, except that we only include the first article by the RavenPack news story identifier. Thus, while All News is intended to capture the total volume of news, Novel News is meant to capture to frequency of news generating events. Finally, we calculate the variable Dissemination as the count of All News divided by Novel News. In cases where Novel News is zero, Dissemination is not defined. Thus, analyses including Dissemination only consider instances where at least one news story exists. The Dissemination measure controls for the amount of news generated and focuses on the media’s role in disseminating information. Panel B of Table 1 shows the number of articles by media outlet in our sample. About 25% of the articles are from the two largest newswires: Dow Jones and Reuters. No other outlet accounts for more than 5% of the sample. 4.4. Other Variables and Controls We include a variety of other measures to control for other sources of variation in firm visibility and attractiveness to retail traders. Firm PR is the number of firm-initiated press releases and Analyst is the number of articles reporting analyst ratings. These variables control for alternative sources of news during the period. EA Lag is the number of calendar days between a firm’s IPO and its first earnings announcement. Earnings announcements that occur outside the previously discussed quiet periods (that is, after 25 or 40 calendar days) are likely to 17",

The variable ln(MVE) is the logarithm of the firm’s market value of equity, measured at the close of the offering date. Larger firms tend to have richer information environments. BTM captures the ratio of book-value of equity from the first quarter-end post IPO to the market value of equity on the close of the offer. There is some evidence that retail traders prefer high book-to-market stocks (Barber and Odean 2000). The variable ln(Sales) is the logarithm of one plus the sum of sales over the four quarters prior to the IPO and is an alternative proxy for size. We also include controls for visibility and for “hot” IPO markets. Day 1 Return is the return from the offer price to the close price for the IPO. Firms with large opening day returns likely generate more visibility. We control for pre-IPO visibility using Pre-IPO News, defined as the number articles on a firm in the window beginning 30 trading-days prior to the IPO and ending on the day prior to the IPO. We apply the same filters to articles as when constructing the All News variable. We also include Industry Return, defined as the return in a firm’s Fama- French 48 industry in the 12 months preceding the IPO, and a Tech Firm indicator variable using the classification of technology firms given in Loughran and Ritter (2004).15 Finally, we define EA CAR, which we use as a dependent variable in several analyses, as the cumulative market- adjusted return over the three-day window centered on the first earnings announcement a firm makes following their IPO, expressed as a percentage. 15 Our sample period does not contain any truly “hot” IPO markets from a historical perspective, but does contain a few calendar quarters that would be considered “cold.” We partitioned the sample using average first-day returns and number of IPOs to create an in-sample measure of hot and cold IPO markets. We did not find any significant differences in results across these partitions, suggesting that our results are not driven by hot or cold IPO markets. 18",

    "text": "Table 2 presents summary statistics for these variables. Panel A gives summary statistics for variables measured at the firm-level. Most of these variables are measured at a single point in time within our sample. For example, we only measure MVE once for each firm in our sample, at the IPO date. As previously discussed, the trading and news related variables in Panel A reflect their values when measured over the time period beginning at the IPO and ending prior to the firm’s first earnings announcement. The positive mean and median values of Net Retail indicate that retail investors tend to be net purchasers during the post-IPO period, consistent with their smaller participation in the initial IPO allocation. In contrast, sophisticated investors tend to receive larger initial allocations and be net sellers after the IPO, as seen in the negative mean and median values of Net Large. The mean number of media articles is 0.89 per day in the post-IPO period, with an average dissemination of 5.19 articles per novel news article. Panel B gives summary statistics for the trading and news related variables at the firm- day level for the window [0, +126]. Firm-level variables are excluded from Panel B since these variables will be subsumed by firm fixed-effects in the analyses at the firm-day level. Net Retail measured on a daily basis has a negative mean and zero median, suggesting that retail investors have some large net sales days over the longer window. Similar to Panel A, mean media coverage is 0.71 articles per day, with each novel news story being disseminated about three times during the day. In the firm-day analyses, we use indicators for All News and Novel News being greater than zero. While the indicator for All News is set to one in all cases where Novel News is equal to one, the Novel News indicator may equal zero in cases where the All News indicator equals one. This is because follow-up articles relating to a given novel news event may be published over the course of several days. 19",

    "text": "Before discussing our main results, we first offer evidence of the efficacy of the IPO quiet period, as our hypotheses assume these restrictions alter firms’ disclosure behaviors (see Cedergren 2017). Panel A of Table 3 reports the frequency of firm press releases (Firm PR) and news articles (All News) in different time windows following the IPO that mirror the quiet periods shown in Figure 1. In the [0,24] window following the IPO, firms issue 0.018 press releases per day on average (excluding press releases that fall into the excluded categories listed in section 4.4). The frequency of firm press releases increases by 33 percent to 0.024 per day in the [25, 39] window. The frequency again increases to 0.027 per day in the [40+] window. Both of these increases are statistically significant relative to the frequency in the [0, 24] day window. By comparison, firms are the subject of 1.272 news articles per day in the [0.24] window, with this frequency significantly declining in the later time windows.16 Panels B of Table 3 reports trading volume over the three time windows, measured as total volume as a percentage of shares outstanding, comparing days with news releases to those days without. Trading volume in the [0, 24] window is not significantly different on days the firm issues a press releases relative to days when the firm does not. Press releases issued more than 24 days following the offering, however, are associated with significantly higher volume. Panel C gives similar information for return variance, where daily return variance is measured using intraday returns.17 Return variance is not significantly higher on days the firm issues a 16 Firm PR is also diffused over the [0, 24] day window, with 16 percent of firm press releases coming within five days of the IPO (i.e. in the first 20 percent of the time window). All News is relatively more clustered near the IPO, with 68 percent of the articles in the [0, 24] day window coming within five days of the IPO. 17 We divide each trading day into 25-minute intervals using 25 different starting points (e.g. version 1 starts with a return from 9:45am to 10:10am, version 2 starts with a return from 9:46am to 10:11am, and so on).

Overall, these findings suggest that the few press releases firms do issue in the 24 days following the offering influence traders to a limited degree, consistent with quiet period restrictions preventing firms from releasing consequential information during this time. In contrast, news articles are associated with significantly greater volume and return volatility in the 24 days following the offering, and this increase tends be greater than the increases in later time windows. This suggests investors find news articles particularly relevant in the days immediately following the offering, perhaps because of the dearth of information available from the firm. 5.2. Media Coverage and Retail Investor Trades We first test the relation between media coverage and retail investor trade within-firm, regressing daily levels of net trades on daily news articles. Table 4 presents the results of these regressions. In this table, Net Retail is calculated for each firm-trading day and the media coverage indicator variables are based on the presence of news articles on the same day. All firm-level controls are subsumed by firm fixed-effects. This regression includes all dates within 126 trading days of the IPO. The positive and significant coefficient on I(All News) in the first column indicates firms experience more retail purchases on the specific days they receive news coverage. In contrast, the coefficient on I(All News) is insignificant when the dependent variable is replaced with Net Large. We find a similar pattern for the other two media coverage measures. The coefficients on both I(Novel News) and Dissemination are positive and significant when Net Retail is the average of the variances calculated from each starting point, multiplied by 100, as our measure of return variance (see Zhang et al. 2005, p. 1396). Both volume and return variance are winsorized at the one percent level. 21",

The coefficient on I(Novel News) is not significantly different from zero when Net Large is the dependent variable and the coefficient on Dissemination is negative when Net Large is the dependent variable. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that media coverage in the post-IPO period will influence retail purchases. The positive coefficient on Dissemination suggests that it is not only the occurrence of news events that drives retail trade, but also the dissemination of news articles related to these underlying events that influences retail purchases. Our failure to find a positive association between media coverage and net large purchases suggests that these results are not driven by some omitted economic event during the post-IPO window that would lead all investors to buy the stock, but rather by retail investors reacting to media coverage in a different manner than more sophisticated investors. Table 5 presents cross-sectional regressions of trade on media coverage. In this table, both measures of trade and media coverage are aggregated at the firm-level from the IPO date to the first post-IPO earnings announcement. The results of Table 5 yield similar inferences to those from Table 4. In all specifications where Net Retail is the dependent variable, the coefficients on the media coverage measures are positive and significant. Again, net large purchases do not exhibit the same sensitivity to news coverage during the post-IPO period. Thus, media coverage has a significant effect on retail investor trades, and this effect does not appear to be driven by news that would trigger a similar response in sophisticated investors. 5.3. Association between Media Coverage and Trade by Time Period and by News Sentiment Panel A of Table 6 repeats the analysis of Table 4, but allows the association between the media coverage and trade variables to vary depending on how many calendar days have passed since the IPO. The different time windows represent the quiet period cutoffs discussed in section 2 and illustrated in Figure 1. The baseline time window is for dates within 25 days of the IPO. 22",

    "text": "The variable News Measure takes the value of either I(All News), I(Novel News), or Dissemination, as indicated by the column headings. In the first column, the coefficient on News Measure gives the association between I(All News) and retail trading during the [0, 24] day window. Consistent with the results in Table 4, this coefficient is significantly positive, indicating that news articles on days just after the IPO (i.e., within the 25-day post-IPO quiet period) are positively associated with retail purchases. The significantly negative coefficients on both I(All News)*Day[25,39] and I(All News)*Day[40+] reflect a weaker association between news articles and retail trade once the restrictions on firm and analyst communication lapse. Untabled tests reveal no significant association between I(All News) and Net Retail in these later time periods. In contrast to these results, when Net Large is the dependent variable, the coefficient on I(All News) is significantly negative, as shown in column 2. Further, this negative association attenuates in latter time periods, as indicated by the positive and significant coefficients on I(All News)*Day[25,39] and I(All News)*Day[40+] in this column. Untabled tests show that I(All News) is not significantly associated with Net Large in these later periods. One interpretation of this finding is that, while large trade is not associated with news in general, these traders do provide liquidity for media-driven retail trade in the period immediately following the IPO. The results using I(Novel News) or Dissemination as the measure of media coverage give similar results. The third column in Panel A of Table 6 shows a significantly positive association between I(Novel News) and Net Retail, and the fourth column shows a negative association between I(Novel News) and Net Large. Again, both of these effects attenuate in later periods. The last two columns of Panel A show that Dissemination is also positively associated with Net Retail and negatively associated with Net Large during the period within 24 days of the IPO. 23",

In sum, the evidence in Tables 4 through 6 suggests that media coverage plays a significant role in influencing retail purchases following a firm’s IPO. As discussed in section 3, these findings could reflect an attention effect (i.e., media coverage makes retail traders aware of the stocks, leading to attention-driven purchases) or an information effect (i.e., media coverage makes retail traders better informed, thereby reducing adverse selection concerns and encouraging them to trade). To better differentiate between the attention and information hypotheses, we split the media coverage variable into two components based on the sentiment of the underlying news. Each variable’s positive and negative component is constructed using news events that RavenPack classifies as having positive or negative sentiment, respectively. As outlined in Section 3, if the attention story holds, the sentiment of the news is unlikely to matter, with both positive and negative news stories generating retail purchases. If the information story holds, then the direction of net retail trade should differ based on the sentiment of the article. Panel B of Table 6 gives the results of this analysis. The results are consistent with the attention hypothesis. The first column in Panel B shows that both the positive and negative components of I(All News) are positively associated with Net Retail in the period immediately after the IPO. The interactions of the positive component with Day[25,39] and Day[40+] show the association of positive news with retail trade significantly weakens in the later time period. The interactions with the negative component of I(All News) show that the association of negative news with retail trade flips sign in the later periods; however the overall effect is not significantly different from zero.. Overall, the presence of news appears to drive retail 24",

The second column of Panel B in Table 6 shows that both the positive and negative components of ln(All News) are negatively associated with Net Large. This finding could again be interpreted as evidence that large traders provide liquidity to attention-driven retail traders in the time period immediately following the IPO. There is less evidence that these associations change over time; although the interaction of the positive component with Day[40+] is significantly positive. The remaining columns of Panel B show the results of similar analyses using the novel news and dissemination based measures. The results using I(Novel News) as the news measure are similar, with both the positive and negative components of this variable exhibiting positive associations with Net Retail; although the coefficient on negative news is not significant (p-value = 0.110). Again, these associations significantly weaken in later time windows. The results with Dissemination as the news measure are weaker, with only the positive component having a significant association with retail trade. Table 7 provides this analysis at the firm-level. While the coefficient on the positive component of each of the three media coverage measures is positive and significant when Net Retail is the dependent variable, the negative component is only significantly positive for ln(All Negative). In all three cases where Net Retail is the dependent variable, however, the positive and negative components are not statistically different from each other. Thus, we fail to find evidence that investors react to positive and negative news differently, inconsistent with the information hypothesis.

    "text": "negative sentiment news prompts purchasing by retail investors, consistent with an attention effect. At the firm level, there is no relation between Net Large and any of the media coverage variables based on sentiment. Overall, the results from Table 6 and Table 7 suggest that the association between retail trading and media coverage does not depend on the sentiment of the news in the period immediately following the IPO. Consistent with the attention hypothesis, these results suggest that post-IPO media coverage, regardless of sentiment, brings a firm into a retail investor’s decision set, making it more likely the investor will purchase the stock. 5.4. Retail Trade and Earnings Announcement Returns Table 8 presents an analysis of the relation between retail trade preceding a firm’s first post-IPO earnings announcement and the abnormal returns during the announcement. A positive association would suggest that retail traders are able to trade in the direction of future earnings news during the post-IPO period, consistent with retail investors making informed trades. Alternatively, a negative association would suggest uninformed, attention-driven trade, consistent with the results in Tables 6 and 7. In Panel A of Table 8, the dependent variable is EA CAR, which is the market-adjusted three-day abnormal return centered on the earnings announcement date. Column 1 presents the results for Net Retail investor trade. The negative coefficient on Trade Measure in this column indicates that greater net retail purchases prior to the earnings announcement are associated with lower abnormal returns at the earnings announcement date. When Net Large is used as the Trade Measure in column 2, the coefficient on Trade Measure is insignificant, suggesting no association between pre-IPO sophisticated investor trading and earnings announcement returns. 26",

    "text": "These findings are consistent with attention-driven retail trading driving the price up in advance of the earnings announcement, leading to a reversal when earnings are announced. An alternative explanation for the findings in Panel A is that retail investor trades incorporate future earnings information into the pre-earnings announcement price. If earnings news is on average positive, this effect would result in a lower return reaction at the earnings announcement date. We investigate this possibility in Panels B and C of Table 8. Panel B shows the results with the absolute value of EA CAR as the dependent variable. The coefficient on Trade Measure in the Net Retail regression is positive and significant, indicating that pre- announcement net retail trade is associated with larger absolute abnormal returns at the earnings announcement. This finding is inconsistent with retail traders incorporating information into price in advance of the earnings announcement, which would have resulted in a smaller absolute return reaction at the announcement date. Panel C shows the relation between the trading measures and abnormal returns at the earnings announcement by the sign of returns. The results show that the associations in Panel A are driven by earnings announcements with negative returns. That is, greater retail purchases are not associated with a muted response to positive earnings news, but with a stronger negative response to negative earnings news. Overall, this evidence is most consistent with the interpretation that retail investor buying in the quiet period drives up price, which then reverses at the first earnings announcement after the IPO. In Table 9, we examine how the presence of media coverage moderates the relation between retail trade and returns at the earnings announcement. In this specification, the dependent variable is EA CAR and we include both trading and media coverage variables, as well as their interaction, as independent variables. We find a negative and significant coefficient on the interaction of Net Retail and ln(All News), indicating that the association between net retail 27",

    "text": "trade and earnings announcement returns becomes more negative with more pre-earnings announcement news articles. This finding further supports the attention hypothesis, with retail investor purchasing exerting upward pressure on price only when media coverage focuses attention on the firm, thus coordinating retail investor purchasing behavior. 5.5. Comparison of IPO and non-IPO Time Periods The evidence thus far suggests media coverage is associated with more purchases by retail investors, and that retail investor purchases are negatively associated with stock returns at the firm’s first earnings announcement post-IPO. Potentially, these associations could exist at any point in a firm’s life cycle. The SEC’s motivation for restricting firm communication during the quiet period stems from concerns that investors will be more easily influenced by disclosures from newly public companies, as these firms have less verifiable information available in the form of historical financial information. Further, the market for the firm’s shares may be less developed, and restrictions on trade (such as the underwriter prohibiting share-flipping, or difficulty in short-selling) may decrease price efficiency. Thus, while attention-driven trade may be present among retail investors at any point in time, these investors may be particularly vulnerable to attention-grabbing events just after the IPO, and this trade is more likely to occur at prices not supported by fundamentals. In the following, we test the extent to which the associations we document are confined to the post-IPO period. In Table 10, we compare some of our primary results to those attained using the same sample of firms one year later. Panel A compares the post-IPO news-and-trade associations from Table 5 to a similar period one year later. For the next year, we measure the news and trading 28",

    "text": "variables over the 30 trading days prior to the earnings announcement.18 We define the indicator variable Year[t+1] to equal one when the observation comes from the next year, and zero when the observation is from the post-IPO period. We then interact Year[t+1] with our news variables and all controls. Thus, the coefficients on ln(All News), ln(Novel News), and Dissemination represent the post-IPO period. The coefficients on the interactions reflect the differential effect one year later. The results in Panel A of Table 10 show that the coefficients on ln(All News), ln(Novel News), and Dissemination are the same as those from Table 5. However, for both ln(All News) and ln(Novel News), the associations between news releases and retail trading are significantly smaller prior to the next year’s earnings announcement. The coefficient on Dissemination is also negative, but not statistically significant when Net Retail is the dependent variable. Panel B of Table 10 performs a similar analysis, comparing the Table 8 associations between trade and the earnings announcement returns for the first post-IPO earnings announcement and the earnings announcement one year later. The interaction of Year[t+1] with Net Retail shows that the association between Net Retail and EA CAR at the next year’s earnings announcement is not statistically different from the association at the first earnings announcement post-IPO. However, this is likely due to the large standard error around the coefficient on Net Retail at the Year[t+1] earnings announcement. Adding the coefficients on the main effect and interaction of Net Retail with Year[t+1] shows the coefficient on Net Retail is −0.61 during this time window, with a standard error of 1.61 (p-value of 0.703). 18 Several firms are dropped from this sample, as they are no longer publicly traded firms at this point (e.g. they were acquired). 29",

    "text": "While Table 10 compares trade during the post-IPO window to a later time window for the same set of firms, Table 11 compares trade in the post-IPO period to the period following a seasoned equity offering (SEO) for a different sample of firms. We gather all SEOs from SDC during our sample period of 2007 to 2016, subject to the same restrictions as our IPO sample (i.e exclude SIC codes 602X and 603X and offer prices below $5.00; require that the security issuance has a share code of 11 or 12 in CRSP). Similar to the IPO sample, we calculate our news and trading measures over the period from the SEO to the first earnings announcement following the SEO. We define the indicator variable of SEO to equal one for observations from the SEO sample. We interact SEO with all the independent variables in our regressions to investigate how the associations vary between newly public firms and more mature firms who are offering equity. Panel A of Table 11 shows how the associations between media coverage and trade vary among the IPO firms and the SEO firms. Again, the coefficients on ln(All News), ln(Novel News), and Dissemination reflect the immediate post-IPO period and are the same as those from Table 5. The interactions reflect the differential effect in the SEO sample. Similar to Table 10, we find some evidence that the association between media coverage and retail trade is strongest in the post-IPO period. While the coefficient on SEO*ln(All News) is not statistically significant, the coefficient on SEO*ln(Novel News) is significantly negative, suggesting media coverage is less associated with retail purchasing post-SEO than post-IPO. Panel B of Table 11 compares the associations between trade and earnings announcement returns between the IPO and SEO samples. Again, the negative coefficient on Trade Measure in the Net Retail column shows that retail purchases in advance of the first earnings announcement post-IPO predict more negative returns at this earnings announcement (the same result as Table 30",

    "text": "8, panel A). The significantly positive coefficient on SEO*Trade Measure in the Net Retail column indicates this association is significantly weaker for the first earnings announcement post-SEO. Similar to panel B of Table 10, adding the coefficients on the main effect and interaction of Net Retail with SEO reveals the coefficient on Net Retail of 0.39 is not significantly different from zero (p-value of 0.635) during the post-SEO window. Overall, these results suggest that the associations between news and retail trade, and between retail trade and returns, are significantly weaker or do not exist one year after the IPO or post-SEO. This is consistent with investors being particularly sensitive to media coverage post- IPO due to the firms’ relatively undeveloped information environments, and the market for the firms’ shares being less efficient, allowing for attention-driven trade to move prices. 5.6. RavenPack News Topics Next, we provide some descriptive evidence on the nature of the news covered by the media during the quiet period. RavenPack codes each article by news topic. We group the news topics into five categories: Capital Markets, Financial, Operations, Event, and Governance. One drawback to the RavenPack coding is that they assign only one topic per article. Thus, if RavenPack systematically favors one type (e.g., Capital Markets) over another type (e.g. Operations) when they are in the same article, then we will get a biased measure of the content using their coding scheme. For example, Appendix B shows an article for Ultragenx that appeared on Yahoo! Finance 13 days after the firm’s IPO. While the article focuses on the results of a patient trial, the article is classified as Capital Markets, presumably because of the stock price effects mentioned in the headline and first paragraph of the article. Table 12, Panel A shows the number of articles by news topic. Overall, the Capital Markets topic is most prevalent in our sample (28.7%), followed by Financial (22.5%) and 31",

    "text": "Operations (20.0%). The remaining columns divide the articles into the quiet period (Day[0,24]) and the subsequent period (Day[25+]). Almost 70% of the articles during the quiet period are coded as Capital Markets, whereas only 16% are coded as such after the quiet period. There are two possible explanations for this difference. First, managers may restrict their disclosure of financial and operational news during the quiet period, which results in most of the news articles covering capital market movements. Second, there may be a greater focus on stock prices in the immediately post-IPO period, which results in stock price movements being discussed in most articles about the company. In Panels B and C of Table 12, we report our firm-day and firm-level analysis, respectively, replacing All News with variables for each of the five categories of article topic. In column (1) of both panels, we find that Capital Markets articles are the only topic significantly associated with Net Retail. This result suggests that news articles that mention stock prices have the largest association with retail purchasing. One possibility is that such articles are proxying for stock price movements during the period, and such price movements are triggering retail trade. In column (2) of both panels, we include controls for the price movements. In Panel B, we control for market-adjusted abnormal returns on the day of the article (AbRet) and on the prior day (Lag AbRet), whereas in Panel C, we control for the cumulative abnormal returns from the IPO date to the earnings announcement (Pre-EA CAR). We find that both AbRet and Pre-EA CAR are significantly related to Net Retail, consistent with an association between retail purchasing and price movements. However, the inclusion of these controls does not affect the significance of the Capital Markets news article variables. Thus, media articles mentioning stock price movements are associated with higher retail trade even after controlling for the price movements themselves. 32",

    "text": "In contrast to the retail trade results, large trades are negatively associated with Capital Markets news articles. Purchasing by large traders is also negatively associated with articles related to Operations. Thus, these presumably more sophisticated traders do not respond to the news releases in the same way as retail traders, consistent with our earlier results. Again, this result is consistent with the large traders taking the other side of the trade when retail investors purchase shares in response to these news events. 5.7. Intraday Analysis The results in the prior section suggest the possibility of reverse causality; i.e., heavy retail purchases during a day leads to stock price changes, that in turn attract greater media coverage. To address this possibility, we perform an intra-day analysis that more precisely measures the relative timing of news articles and retail trade. We construct our Net Retail measure using all trades in the 6.5 hour trading window (e.g. the length of a full trading day) immediately following and immediately preceding a news article. We use only non-overlapping windows to ensure that a pre-article window will never overlap with a post-article window. We include indicators for a trading window representing a pre-article trading window (Pre) or post-article trading window (Post). The omitted category is trading days that do not overlap with a pre- or post-article window. The exclusion of overlapping trading windows reduces the sample size in this analysis compared to our main analyses. The first column of Table 13 shows the results for the full 126 trading days following the IPO. The coefficients on the Post and Pre indicator variables are both positive and significant, indicating that there is increased retail purchasing activity both preceding and following news articles. The second column shows that, during the quiet period of Day[0,24], Post is significantly positive, while Pre is not significant. This results suggests that retail purchasing is 33",

    "text": "significantly higher in the period following news articles, but that retail purchasing does not increase prior to the article. This finding helps dismiss the reverse causality argument by showing that news articles tend not to react to retail purchasing in the quiet period; instead, higher retail purchasing follows the news articles. The remaining columns show the results for Day[25,39] and Day[40+], when alternative information sources (e.g., the firm and its analysts) become more prevalent. We find that Post is not significant in these windows, whereas Pre is now positive and significant. Thus, when firm or analyst disclosures are more likely to precede news articles, we see higher retail purchasing before the news articles, suggesting that retail traders are reacting to the original disclosure by the firm or analyst, rather than the subsequent news articles. Overall, this test suggests that retail investors are reacting to the media in the period immediately following the IPO, when alternative information sources are not available, but then are reacting prior to news articles when the firm and analyst are less constrained in releasing information. 6. Conclusion In this paper, we examine the association between media coverage and retail trade immediately following a firm’s IPO. We find that greater media coverage is associated with greater retail investor purchases. This effect is strongest immediately after a firm’s IPO and weakens in later periods. Consistent with media coverage generating attention-driven retail investor trade, we find that the association between media coverage and retail investor purchases does not depend on the sentiment of the media coverage. 34",

This finding is consistent with coordinated attention-driven trade pushing up prices, which then revert at the firm’s earnings announcement. Our findings suggest that the SEC’s concern that information outside the prospectus may unduly influence retail traders’ investment decisions is well founded. However, given our results are driven by media coverage, which is outside the realm of SEC control, one should not interpret our findings as indicating the SEC’s post-IPO quiet period restrictions achieve their goal of investor protection. It is possible that allowing firms to make additional disclosures during this time period would offset the media’s influence by offering an alternative viewpoint, or clarifying points of contention. However, our findings do support the concept that additional information disclosure can come with a cost when the objective includes investor protection. 35",

Data from a case study of an advanced multi-system MPS 7 patient (12 years old) with respiratory insufficiency, who is being treated with rhGUS will be presented. The preliminary data suggests that rhGUS helps in reducing lysosomal storage (based on reduced excretion of urinary glycosaminoglycans), as well as the size of the enlarged liver and spleen. Plus, an improvement in pulmonary function was noted. Additionally, no infusion-related side effects were found during the first 14 weeks of treatment. We remind investors that in Dec 2013, Ultragenyx had initiated an open-label phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of rhGUS (administered every alternate week through intravenous infusion) in five MPS 7 patients aged between 5 and 30 years. Interim data from the phase I/II study is expected this year. The initial primary analysis phase of 12 weeks will be followed by dose-exploration and long-term extension. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (:FDA) has granted an emergency Investigational New Drug (eIND) for rhGUS. MPS 7 represents an underserved market with no approved therapies being available. Ultragenyx is a biopharmaceutical company. Other biopharma stocks that are worth considering include Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN), Emergent BioSolutions, Inc. (EBS) and Actelion Ltd. (ALIOF). All three sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). 41",
