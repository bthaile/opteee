Earnings announcements can trigger extreme price reactions in stocks but some theoretical models suggest that anticipated price jumps should not carry a skew premium. We use the realized returns to delta-neutral risk reversals option spread positions as a proxy for the skew premiums. We find skew premiums are economically and statistically significant around earnings announcements. In particular, for firms with negative option-implied skewness, negative skew premiums double on earnings announcements. For firms with positive option-implied skewness, positive skew premiums increase about 23 percent. These results hold conditional on variance risk premiums, are associated with order imbalances in puts to calls, and are related to both systematic and idiosyncratic risks. Finally, we find that some firm reporting characteristics explain the cross-section of earnings announcements skew premiums.

Finally, we find that some firm reporting characteristics explain the cross-section of earnings announcements skew premiums. JEL Codes: G13, M40 Keywords: Earnings announcements; Information; Options; Skew; Volatility Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496 In this study, we examine skew premiums in equity option prices around earnings announcements (EAs). Numerous studies examine equity returns around earnings announcement dates (EADs) and conclude that both expected and realized returns are elevated during these periods (Ball and Kothari, 1991; Cohen et al., 2007; Savor and Wilson, 2016). These abnormal returns are generally interpreted as compensation to investors for bearing undiversifiable disclosure risk related to the information released around the earnings announcement. Other studies focus on the returns to equity options around EAs (e.g., Barth and So, 2014; Dubinsky et al., 2019) as investors are exposed to changes in future equity volatilities, in addition to changes in equity prices, around the earnings announcement (e.g., Neururer et al., 2016). This research documents significant premiums in straddle1 positions around EAs, indicative of risks related to unidirectional price movements and also to changes in volatilities that may be triggered by the information released during the earnings announcement (Dubinsky et al., 2019). We extend this literature by focusing on an alternative risk that investors bear with the earnings information release: skew risk.2 Our focus on skew risk derives from evidence in prior studies finding asymmetric equity price reactions to earnings releases; in particular, prior literature suggests that negative stock returns are more pronounced, on average, compared to positive reactions on EADs (e.g., McNichols, 1988; Acharya et al., 2011; Smith, 2021). These documented return asymmetries around EADs may also result in differential pricing of insurance contracts designed to protect against such asymmetries in the market reactions to earnings announcements. In other words, skew risk may be uniquely priced in the options market on EADs. 1 A long (short) straddle position is the simultaneous buying (selling) of an at-the-money put and call. 2 Other studies have noted that OTM puts in equity index options tend to have large pricing premiums (e.g., Broadie et al., 2007). Kozhan et al. (2013) also find significant skew premiums in S&P500 options. 1 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "However, some asset pricing models do not predict the presence of premiums tied specifically to skewness, and in addition, related empirical studies on index options do not detect a unique skewness premium in the prices of such contracts. For example, Piazzesi (2000) and Dubinsky et al. (2019) suggest that because investors may anticipate the jumps in stock prices around earnings announcements, there is no impact on the relative prices of out-of-the- money (OTM) options. These models do not predict a skew risk premium tied to insurance contracts surrounding the EA. In addition, studies examining index options note that skew premiums are insignificant when controlling for concurrent variance risk premiums (e.g., Kozhan et al., 2013). Thus, it is possible that skew risk around EADs may be subsumed by related volatility premiums. In summary, it is not clear, on an ex-ante basis, whether skew risk is priced around EADs and if skew premiums are orthogonal to other studied option-related premiums. Consequently, in this study, we explore whether skew premiums exist in option contracts around EADs and whether such premiums are distinct from the previously documented variance risk premiums around EADs.3 We estimate the returns to delta-neutral risk reversals (DNRRs) around EADs (Bali and Murray, 2013) to proxy for skew premiums around EADs. The position is intended to capture the differences between risk-neutral (i.e., option-implied) and realized skewness and we thus view the returns to the DNRR position as equivalent to analyzing the skew premiums in equity options around EADs.4 We construct a large data set of DNRR returns around EADs and a corresponding placebo set of DNRRs returns on non-EADs. We find weak evidence that the returns to DNRRs 3 In particular, we construct the position to be initially insensitive to both equity price movements (delta) and equity volatility changes (gamma).3 The position however carries some risk because, even though it is initially delta and gamma neutral, DNRRs generate large profits (or losses) when equity price changes are extreme. For example, if the stock price were to drop (rise) significantly the position would generate a large gain (loss). Conversely, if the stock price were to decrease (increase) by a more modest amount, the DNRR would fall (rise) in value. 4 Our definition of a DNRR is similar to that of the ‘PUTCALL’ position of Bali and Murray (2013). 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "are negative around non-EADs, indicating the relative absence of a negative skew premium in stock options surrounding periods when firm-specific information releases are not anticipated. In contrast, we find strong evidence that the average return to the DNRRs is negative around EADs and the average return to DNRRs is significantly different on EADs relative to non- EADs. This indicates that investors, on average, pay a premium to remove negative skew risk around EADs. Furthermore, we examine whether the above-documented skew premiums around EADs exist even after controlling for variance risk premiums around EADs.5 Prior literature fails to find the presence of skew premiums in index options conditional on corresponding variance risk premiums. We find that skew premiums in individual company equity options around EADs are present, even after controlling for the previously documented variance risk premiums around EADs. Thus, while prior literature documents an increase in variance risk premiums of individual companies before EAs, our results suggest that skew risk is priced separately on these information release dates. We next separately examine observations that have negative versus positive implied skewness. Descriptively, and similar to prior studies (e.g., Duan and Wei, 2009), we find that firms with negative implied skewness (i.e., OTM put implied volatilities [IVs] exceed OTM call IVs) are typically larger, older, and have higher systematic risk relative to idiosyncratic risk. It is thus likely that hedging demands in the equity option market for these two categories of firms are substantially different. Indeed, for the observations with negative implied skewness, we find the negative return to the DNRR strategy to be about twice as large on EAD dates compared to non-EADs, and the absolute size of the DNRR return to be comparable to the average stock returns on EADs. Consequently, the results suggest that, for firms with negative IV skews, there is a large premium to hedging the negative skew risk on EADs. 5 We follow Dubinsky et al. (2019) and use the returns from straddle positions around EADs to capture the variance risk premium around these dates. 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "Conversely, when we examine observations that have positive implied skew, we find that the average DNRR position earns a large positive return. For the positive IV skew non- EAD observations, we estimate an average three trading day return of 72 basis points to the DNRR position. For these observations, investors actually earn a positive return for holding negative skew protection. However, the position is exposed to significant risk to the upside, and thus investors bear considerable upside jump risk when holding the DNRR. This may also explain why the average return to the position is so high: when there is an excess demand for calls generating a positive option-implied skew, market makers may charge relatively large premiums on OTM calls as compensation for taking the other side of the position. Importantly, we find that the return to the DNRR position is significantly higher on EADs relative to non- EADs for observations with positive implied skew. Thus, trading against the implied skew is more profitable on EADs and suggests that conditional on the sign of the implied skew, traders are compensated for bearing skew risk on the scheduled information release dates. Further tests reveal that the relative open interest and the relative trading volume in puts and calls are also predictive of the returns to skew trading around EAs. We find, for example, that a one-standard deviation increase in the log put-to-call open interest ratio is associated with a 9 bps drop in the return to the DNRR over the EAD period. Our results suggest that the relative returns to the DNRRs are due to supply-demand pressures on the put versus call wing. We next examine whether skew premiums vary conditional on a company’s exposure to systematic versus idiosyncratic risks. We find evidence that the source of the variance risk does not influence the returns to trading skew around EADs. Instead, our results point to firms with higher total return variance having higher skew premiums on information release dates. For example, and in comparison to variance risk premiums (e.g., Barth and So, 2014), we find that EAD skew premiums are negatively related firm size. Conditional on the sign of the IV skew, larger firms have smaller EA skew premiums. In other words, the returns to traders 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "betting against the IV skew are higher for smaller firms. In addition, we find evidence that the returns to betting against skew are higher for firms with higher total variance risk, but we do not find evidence that the ratio of systematic to idiosyncratic variance explains explain the cross-section of DNRR returns on EADs. Finally, we examine whether firms’ reporting attributes further impact the existence of and size of the skew premiums around EAs. We find evidence that EA saliency6, our proxy for investor attention as to the specific earnings announcement, is negatively associated with the DNRR returns. Thus, as reporting saliency increases, there appears to be a higher demand for protection against downside asymmetric price reactions to EAs. We also find that the returns to trading against skew are exacerbated (weakened) for firms that report later in the calendar quarter (consistently meet earnings expectations). However, unlike reporting saliency, the effects of report timing and reporting consistency are subsumed by option-implied variance and option-implied skew in our regression models. This study makes several contributions. First, and as far as we are aware, this is the first study to examine the presence of skew premiums in individual equity options around EADs.7 In particular, we find that skew premiums around earnings announcements are, on average elevated around EADs, indicative of heightened and asymmetric disclosure risks related to the earnings announcement. Importantly, we further show that the previously documented variance risk premiums around EAs do not subsume the skewness premiums documented in this study, suggesting that skew premiums are separately priced on EADs. Our findings may be of interest to researchers that attempt to use option prices to infer higher moment ex-ante EA return statistics from option prices (e.g., Smith, 2021). 6 We construct earnings announcement saliency as the inverse of the number of firms that report earnings on a specific date. 7 For example, Culp et al. (2018) examine premiums in implied-credit spreads. However, their study does not isolate the effect of EA on the premiums. 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "Asymmetric Stock Returns and Information Releases Stock market index returns display negative skewness indicating the presence of negative returns with greater probability than suggested by a symmetric distribution. This effect is both found in conditional and unconditional returns (e.g., Harvey and Siddique, 1999). In addition, index OTM put options typically have much higher IVs relative to OTM call options suggesting a high negative risk-neutral skew. In contrast, individual stocks have more positively skewed returns distributions relative to market indices (Albuquerque, 2012). Similar patterns are found in the equity option market; risk-neutral distributions for stocks are generally more positively skewed relative to the index options (Bakshi et al., 2003). However, when examining EAD returns, several authors have noted that stock returns are more negatively skewed when compared to non-EAD returns. As Smith (2021) notes, a valuation signal that is more informative when it reveals negative rather than positive news causes returns to exhibit negative return skewness. McNichols (1988) suggests that, on average, more bad news is disclosed in the mandatory reports and managers may be more likely to release good news ahead of EAs. Likewise, Miller (2002) finds firms are more likely to provide voluntary information when earnings performance is strong helping generate negatively skewed returns on EADs (also see Kothari et al., 2009). McNichols (1988) also finds that the effect is not due to small firms. Instead, she finds that the asymmetric effect of EAs on stock returns is stronger for large and medium-sized firms. Similarly, Acharya et al. (2011) suggest firms will tend to release good news in periods where there are no other public signals. However, when signals are required, firms will tend to release, on average, bad information. This again creates asymmetries in returns around information releases. There are other explanations for more negatively skewed equity returns around EADs (compared to non-EADs). One possibility is that earnings reports contain ambiguous 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "information. If the precision of information contained in the EA is unknown then, according to the model of Epstein and Schneider (2008), investors will react more strongly to negative news relative to positive news. Investors, when confronted with ambiguous news, will treat bad news as if it has high precision. For good news, investors will treat the news as imprecise. This creates asymmetric reactions to information based on the sign of the news and leads to asymmetric return distributions. Williams (2015) presents evidence of this effect: stock returns appear more asymmetric in periods where ambiguity is likely higher. Finally, Veronesi (1999) shows that in a Bayesian model with risk-averse investors, stock prices respond more to bad news in good times and vice versa thus creating asymmetries in stock returns. Earnings Announcements and Risk Premiums EAs impose significant risk on investors and the release of the earnings information can cause large price revisions in equity values (i.e., jumps in asset prices). Indeed, numerous studies in accounting and finance establish that EAs convey valuation-relevant news about the announcing firm and, before the release of the report, implied volatilities tend to rise in the equity option market (e.g., Neururer et al., 2016). EAs may also convey news about overall market and economic conditions, imposing undiversifiable announcement risk on investors (Savor and Wilson, 2016). Thus, investors may demand extra compensation for bearing risk across the announcement period. Moreover, EAs may also impose additional idiosyncratic risks if investors do not hold well-diversified portfolios. The first study to document that, on average, stock prices increase around their EADs is Beaver (1968). Subsequently, several other studies have documented this same basic fact including Chari et al. (1988) and Ball and Kothari (1991). These studies find the EA premium is not explained by factors such as firm size, book-to-market ratios, and return momentum. The results collectively suggest that investors are compensated for bearing risk across the announcement period. Later studies have also examined risk premiums in the options market 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "around EADs. Barth and So (2014) and Dubinsky et al. (2019) both examine the returns to volatility trading around earnings announcement periods. Dubinsky et al. (2019) find that the average IV for their sample is 8.2% while the actual realized announcement date volatility is only 7.4% suggesting that there is a large volatility premium in the options market around EADs. Our study is related to all these prior papers as we examine the returns to securities around EADs. However, our main question of interest in this paper is the presence of skewness and its corresponding pricing around EAs. Our proxy for skewness is the DNRR; we construct the DNRRs to be explicitly hedged against small movements in both expected volatility and stock price movements and, thus, the position is not initially exposed to the risks already explored in prior studies. Instead, the position is exposed to rare but large negative or positive stock price movements, and consequently, our results also speak to the premium embedded in equity options to hedge and trade skew risk. Delta-Neutral Risk Reversals and Skew Risk Premiums The two options spread positions that we investigate in this paper are risk reversals and straddles. First, a straddle involves the purchase or sale of both a put and call option at the same time with the same expiration date with the same strike price. The strike price chosen will typically be close to the current stock or forward price. Thus, because the put option will have roughly the opposite negative delta of the call option’s positive delta, the position will be insensitive to the direction of the changes in the stock price. Instead, because the position is long (short) both the call and the put, an investor is initially indifferent to the actual direction of the stock price but, instead, profits if the stock moves aggressively (does not move) in either direction. Consequently, traders consider straddle positions to be bets or hedges on stock volatility. The returns to straddles are thus a proxy for variance risk premiums in equity options (Barth and So, 2014; Dubinsky et al., 2019). 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "A risk reversal, on the other hand, is the purchase of an OTM put and the sale of an OTM call with the same expiration. This combination will result in a large directional (delta) position that an investor can hedge with a long position in the stock. Note that if the purchase and sale quantities are done in the correct amounts in the option and equity markets, the DNRR is initially insensitive to small movements for both stock price and volatility. Stated differently, the position is initially hedged against both stock and volatility risk. However, the DNRR will profit if the stock price jumps down but will lose value if the stock price moves down slowly. Similar calculations show the position will gain (lose) value if the stock price move is up and small (large). In this way, and contrasted to the straddle position, the DNRR is not subject to volatility risk but, instead, skew risk.8 Generally speaking, if risk-neutral (i.e., option-implied) skewness is more negative (positive) compared to realized stock return skewness then, on average, the DNRR position will generate negative (positive) returns (Bali and Murray, 2013). The main empirical question that we analyze in this paper is whether skew risk is priced on EADs in the equity options market.9 While results from prior literature indicate that investors are likely to pay a premium for purchasing skewness protection around EADs, there are three main reasons to suspect that the returns to DNRRs around EADs are not lower when compared to other dates. First, option-implied skewness is theoretically connected to true return skewness (Bakshi et al., 2003). For example, even if put prices are elevated compared to call prices around EADs, the incremental premium may simply compensate investors for the extra realized negative skewness that is generated ex-post. Stated differently, the increase in option- 8 The selling of an OTM put and the purchase of an OTM call is related to the cubic contract of Bakshi et al. (2003) which is itself related to risk-neutral return skewness. Note that other studies use different methods to investigate the returns to variance and skewness in the option market (e.g., Kozhan et al., 2013; Yuehao et al., 2019). However, these methods are inappropriate for this study because their strategy returns can only be measured over longer (e.g., monthly) periods. Instead, in this paper, we need to calculate the returns to the positions at relatively high frequencies. 9 We also measure skew risk during periods that do not contain an earnings announcement – we use this analysis as a placebo test, to obtain further assurance of the uniqueness of EAs in the pricing of skew risk. 9 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "implied skewness may be matched by actual return skewness and, consequently, the realized returns to the DNRRs may not be significantly different around EADs compared to non-EADs. Bakshi et al. (2003) also suggests that only co-skewness between equity and the market should be priced.10 Furthermore, theory does not necessarily suggest that anticipated information releases require a skew premium. For example, Dubinsky et al. (2019) assumes the following equity and variance process under risk-neutral dynamics (ℚ):11 In the above, S is the stock price, V is the variance, the dWs are Brownian motions, and the Brownian motions are allowed to be correlated. In addition, the risk-neutral jump intensity is λ , Z Q ~N(μQ, σQ 2 ), and EQ eZj y j y y ℚ � � ( ) � �� � � � = 1. The above model allows for event-specific price jumps (i.e., the price movements due to the EA release). Dubinsky et al. (2019) assumes that the EA jump size is normal under the risk-neutral dynamics: Q Here, σ is the EA-specific jump volatility as implied by the options market. From this j specification, the EA variance risk premium is be defined as the risk-neutral variance relative to the expected variance under a read-world measure. In other words, the EA variance risk premium is the spread between the option-model volatility and expected volatility on the EA 10 Thus, in our tests, we may not find large skewness premiums across our sample and, instead, we may have to condition the observations to other factors to observe skew premiums. 11 Their model builds on the model of Piazzesi (2000). 10 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "date. However, because the EAD price jump is deterministic, the EAD associated jump parameters do not influence the slope of the IV skew. The relative prices of OTM puts and calls are unaffected by the deterministic jump and, thus, there may not be a significant premium to the skew trades on EADs. Unanticipated price jumps, on the other hand, can generate a skew risk premium in equity options. Finally, we note that, unlike stock indices, many stocks have positive implied skewness (e.g., Gkionis et al., 2021). This indicates that investors anticipate larger positive returns relative to negative stock returns for a subset of stocks. For the EA, investors may have different expectations and hedging demands for stocks with positive implied skew. It is thus possible that our analysis will not detect unconditional skew premiums, but such skew premiums may be present for subsets of stocks conditional on the sign of the implied skew. We thus believe that the question of whether a skew premium is priced and elevated in equity option prices before EADs is an empirical issue. Prior literature has investigated the factors that influence IV skews. Examples include Dennis and Mayhew (2002), Duan and Wei (2009), and Friesen et al. (2012). However, except for Bali and Murray (2013), to our knowledge, prior studies have not investigated the returns to the option skew positions in equity options. This is especially true when the analysis is focused on the EA period.12 Furthermore, factors can influence the prices of options even if they do not explain the returns to options.13 While the factors help to describe the shape of and level of IV skews in individual stocks, it is possible that, empirically, they will not be associated with the cross-section of average returns to the option strategies. Stated differently, other studies have examined the factors associated 12 Diavatopoulos et al. (2012) examine if changes in implied skewness and kurtosis helps predict the returns to equity and options around EADs. However, the authors only examine raw option returns. It is thus difficult to determine if there is a premium for holding skew risk around EADs separate from directional (delta) or variance risk. Other studies have examined if risk-neutral skewness has predictive power for stock returns and standardized unexpected earnings (e.g., Borochin et al., 2020). 13 For example, while analyst earnings dispersion is a strong conditional predictor of IVs, dispersion does not appear to predict the cross-section of straddle returns around EADs (Dubinsky et al., 2019). 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

We select the options with the nearest expiration date relative to the EAD between ten and forty calendar days inclusive. Next, we select a put and a call that have absolute deltas between 0.40 and 0.10 (i.e., OTM options). If multiple options meet these criteria, we choose a put and a call with an absolute delta nearest to 0.25. For some of our tests, we also control for the returns to at-the-money (ATM) straddles. We select calls and puts that have absolute deltas between 0.40 and 0.60 for the straddles using the same expiration date as the OTM options. Again, if multiple puts or calls meet this definition, we select those with the absolute deltas nearest to 0.50. We then record the option prices (the mean of their bid and offer prices) for (-1, +1) trading days around the EA.15 Next, for the DNRR, we set the position size of the put at one, sell the amount of calls that results in the position having zero gamma, and hedge the residual delta with stock. For the straddle, we buy one ATM put and call. We then calculate the profit or loss for each position and scale the raw profits of the strategies by the capital required to initiate the position to generate a return. We define RR_RET (STRADDLE_RET) as the return to the DNRR (straddle) position. We also define STOCK_RET as the natural log return of the stock over the three trading day period. See Appendix 1 for variable definition details and Appendix 2 for a calculation example. 14 In more technical terms, our paper examines the differences between the Q-distribution (option market implied distributions of returns) and the P-distribution (actual return distributions) around earnings announcements.

    "text": "For later analyses, we create the following variables. We first define LOG_IMPSKEW as the natural log of the OTM put IV divided by the OTM call IV for the two contracts used for the DNRR. Thus, LOG_IMPSKEW represents the relative IV between the OTM put and call wings and it is a proxy for implied skewness. We anticipate a positive relationship between LOG_IMPSKEW and RR_RET because LOG_IMPSKEW should proxy for any demand imbalances between downside and upside protection. Investors should be also compensated for selling negative skew protection for firms with higher implied negative skews. However, there are two reasons to believe LOG_IMPSKEW may not correlate highly with observed DNRRs, especially on EADs. Again, option-implied skewness (i.e., IV skew) is, in theory, connected to future realized skew (e.g., Bakshi et al., 2003). Thus, a greater difference in OTM put and call IVs may represent situations where greater negative price jumps are ultimately realized, offsetting the differences in the relative prices of the options. Moreover, the theory of anticipated price jumps (e.g., Dubinsky et al., 2019) suggests that options do not price skew risk on EADs. The LOG_IMPSKEW variable may thus capture the risk for unanticipated jumps that could occur outside the EA period. We also define LOG_IMPVOL as the natural log of the ATM IV at trading day -1.16 We define the ATM IV as the mean of the IV of the call and put used to construct the ATM straddle. Although we construct the DNRRs to have neutral gamma, there still may be a skew premium for firms with greater uncertainty. We thus expect firms with higher total forward- looking variances to have lower DNRR returns around the EADs. We also define LOG_PC_OI as the log of the open interest in puts to calls at trading day t - 1. Thus, LOG_PC_OI measures the relative position imbalance in puts relative to calls preceding the EAD and, thus, we expect LOG_PC_OI will be negatively related to DNRR returns around EADs. To control for macro- 16 We use the natural log of IVs and the VIX to make the modelling of variances versus volatilities irrelevant in our linear models (He et al., 2019). 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "level uncertainty, we define LOG_VIX as the log of the VIX (i.e., the CBOE volatility index). In addition, because the times to expiration for the options used for this study are not constant across the observations, we define LOG_EXPTIME as the log number of days between the option opening trade date and the option expiration date. We also use the following variables to investigate if DNRR returns around EADs are related to systematic versus idiosyncratic risk. First, we define the variable MRKCAP set to the firm’s market capitalization at the end of the prior quarter. We also define BETA as the CAPM beta for the firm using the prior 91 calendar days of returns. For the calculation, we define the market as the CRSP value-weighted index. Next, we define TOTALVAR as the total historical return variance of the firm over the prior 91 calendar days. We then define SYSVAR and IDIOVAR as the following: SYSVAR = [BETA2 x INDEXVAR] it it t IDIOVAR = TOTALVAR – SYSVAR it it it In the above, INDEXVAR is the variance of the index returns (the CRSP value-weighted index) over the prior 91 calendar days. Thus, SYSVAR is the stock’s level of historical systematic variance and IDIOVAR is the historical idiosyncratic variance over the prior quarter. Similar to Duan and Wei (2009), we also define SIVARRATIO as the ratio of SYSVAR to IDIOVAR. Thus, SIVARRATIO is a measure of the stock’s systematic risk relative to the amount of idiosyncratic risk. Finally, because the variables have high skew, we take the natural logs of MRKCAP, SYSVAR, IDIOVAR, and TOTALVAR to create LOG_MRKCAP, LOG_SYSVAR, LOG_IDIOVAR, and LOG_TOTALVAR respectively. Unless noted, we winsorize continuous independent variables at the 1st and 99th percentiles, standardize continuous independent variables to have zero mean and unit variance, define quarter fixed effects using the EAD, define industries by two-digit SIC codes, cluster standard errors both at the firm and quarter dimensions, and estimate regressions using (robust) 14 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

We multiply all regressions coefficients by 100 to improve readability. SAMPLE CONSTRUCTION AND SUMMARY STATISTICS Our sample consists of the intersection of companies/quarters with identifiable EADs and sufficient data to calculate the options-related variables, over the 1996-2017 period.18 Panel A of Table 1 tabulates our sample selection process. We start with 364,024 quarterly earnings announcements from 1996-2017 having at least one analyst EPS forecast. We then remove observations with insufficient option or stock data around the EAD, zero put or call open interest, missing SIC codes, market capitalization, book-to-market, or return-on-equity. Our main sample consists of 54,716 observations. Panel B of Table 1 shows the sample construction for the tests that involve our placebo control sample. We employ the same selection rules used to construct the main dataset above; we open the DNRR, straddles, and stock positions 11 trading days before the EAD and close these positions two days later (9 trading days before the EAD). We choose this measurement period because the sample should generally be free of scheduled information disclosures over these days.19 Table 2 displays the summary statistics for the EAD observations in Panel A and the non-EAD observations in Panel B. Focusing on the medians and robust means, we see that the average values for RR_RET and STRADDLE_RET are negative in Panel A indicating skew and variance risk premiums before EAs. The average value for LOG_IMPSKEW is negative in both Panels A and B, consistent with Conrad et al. (2013), indicating that OTM put IVs typically 17 We do not use MM-regression except for some robustness tests. This is because MM-regression cannot handle the large amounts of fixed effects we use in later tests. 18 We select the earnings announcements for the years 1996 – 2017 because, at the time of our data download, this was the period covered by the OptionMetrics database. 19 Due to not having enough historical return data, the number of observations for the EAD (non-EAD) sample drops to 54,784 (49,294) when using our historical risk variables (e.g., BETA). 15 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

In addition, we find that for individual stocks, the open interest for calls typically exceeds the open interest puts (i.e., negative mean and median values for LOG_PC_OI). When examining the values across the two panels, we note that the medians and robust means for RR_RET and STRADDLE_RET are lower for the EAD observations relative to the non-EAD observations. The lower average straddle return is consistent with prior literature that suggests that variance risk premiums are elevated before EAs (e.g., Barth and So, 2014; Dubinsky et al., 2019). In addition, the lower average DNRR return is consistent with an elevated negative skew premium on EADs. Furthermore, untabulated bootstrap tests confirm that EA stock returns are more negatively skewed relative to non-EAD stock returns.20 We finally note that IMPVOL values are higher on EADs compared to non-EADs. This is again consistent with prior literature that suggests that IVs tend to rise before EAs (e.g., Neururer et al., 2016). In Table 3, we split the combined EA and non-EAD samples based on if an observation has negative versus positive implied skewness (i.e., LOG_IMPSKEW). The first major difference between the samples is the average return to the DNRR strategy. For the negative implied skew observations, the median return is -8 bps but, for the positive implied skew observations, the median return is 59 bps. This second value appears very large for a three trading day return. However, it is likely difficult for a trader to capture this premium. Because the DNRR is long puts and short calls with a partial stock hedge, the position is exposed to infinite upside jump risk and the amount of capital that must be held against the position is likely substantial. Thus, the large return in the positive implied skew subsample is likely 20 EAD stock returns are more negatively skewed than non-EAD returns when also scaling the returns by the ATM straddle IVs.

In contrast, if a trader attempted to trade against skew when the option-implied skew is negative, the trader’s position would include short puts, long calls, and short stock. In this case, the position’s risk is capped by the fact the stock cannot go below zero. When examining the stock returns and straddle returns across the two subsamples, we do not find strong evidence that the average returns are different. Instead, we do find strong evidence that observations with positive implied skew have significantly higher IVs. Firms with negative IV skew also tend to be larger. The median market capitalization for the negative (positive) implied skew subsample is $3.1 billion ($1.4 billion). Furthermore, and perhaps not surprisingly, firms with negative implied skew average significantly higher put-to-call open interest values compared to positive implied skew observations. We also note that negative implied skew firms tend to have higher BETA values compared to positive implied skew firms. We see that this is due to the negative skew observations having higher systematic variance values (LOG_SYSVAR) but lower idiosyncratic and total variance values (LOG_IDIOVAR and LOG_TOTALVAR respectively). Finally, and consistent with Duan and Wei (2009), we find that negative implied skew observations have significantly higher levels of systematic to idiosyncratic return variance (SIVARRATIO).

In addition, if F-tests suggest that the sum of the EA and intercept coefficients are significant, then this would provide evidence that skew premiums are significant on EADs. Table 4, Panel A displays the regression results when using all observations without fixed effects. Column (1) shows the M-regression results with no controls. The estimated coefficient for EA is significant and positive at traditional levels (coef. = -0.072; t-stat = 5.49). This provides evidence that skew premiums are elevated on EADs relative to non-EADs. On average, investors that attempt to hedge downside risk with a long DNRR position will suffer greater losses around the EA compared to dates when investors do not anticipate scheduled firm-level news releases. In contrast, the coefficient for the intercept is negative but not significant at traditional levels suggesting that non-EAD skew premiums are not distinguishable from zero. Furthermore, an F-test shows that the sum of the EA and intercept coefficients are statistically different from zero suggesting that skew premiums for individual stocks are significant before EAs.

However, we continue to estimate a negative and significant coefficient for EA (t-stat = 4.59) and the F-test continues to suggest that skew premiums are significant on EADs. Thus, and unlike the results of Kozhan et al. (2013), we find that skew premiums are present in the equity market around EADs even after accounting for variance risk premiums. In columns (3) and (4) of Panel A, we re-estimate our models using MM-regression. MM-regression helps to control for outliers in the independent variables as well and for outliers in the dependent variable. However, the resulting regression results are generally consistent with the results of columns (1) and (2). We again find evidence that skew premiums are significant on EADs and skew premiums are elevated on EADs relative to non-EADs. The changes between the two sets of regressions results are small. For example, in column (3), we find some evidence that skew premiums are significant even on non-EADs and, in column (4), we do not estimate a significant coefficient for the interaction EA x STRADDLE_RET. We include fixed effects in our regression models in Panel B of Table 4. We note that we do not include the intercept term in our models because the fixed effects subsume the intercept. In columns (1) and (2), we add quarter fixed effects to control for temporal variation in the relationships. The results are similar to those estimated in Panel A of Table 4; the coefficient on EA suggests that the returns to the DNRRs are lower on EADs and this result holds when also controlling for the straddle returns. We also add industry fixed effects defined by two-digit SIC codes in columns (3) and (4). Again, the estimated coefficients are generally unchanged by the industry controls and, thus, industry effects do not explain our results.

    "text": "idiosyncratic variance ratio tend to have positive implied skew. In addition, implied skews are likely impacted by the relative supply-demand imbalances on the put versus call wings. Thus, it is likely that the compensation to traders that provide downside risk protection to firms with negative implied skewness is likely different compared to those that provide the same protection to firms with positive implied skewness. In Table 5, we use the negative option-implied skew observations. In column (1), we only use the intercept and the indicator variable EA in our regression model. In contrast to the results in Table 4, but consistent with Table 3, we find strong evidence that DNRR returns are negative when only using negative implied skew observations. Based on the estimated intercept coefficient, the average DNRR loses 8.7 basis points over the non-EAD three-day trading period. This provides evidence negative skew premiums are present for firms that investors expect to display negative skewness. However, and consistent with Table 4, the coefficient for EA is negative and significant (t-stat = 8.45). Combined with the intercept coefficient, the estimated coefficient for EA suggests that DNRRs suffer an average loss of 19 bps around EADs and the negative skew premium is roughly double around EADs compared to non-EADs. Thus, ignoring transaction costs, traders that provide negative skew protection on firms with negative implied skew, and this compensation increases around scheduled information release dates. In column (2), we add STRADDLE_RET and the interaction EA x STRADDLE_RET to our regression model. We estimate a positive coefficient for STRADDLE_RET suggesting that negative skew premiums are related to variance risk premiums. However, the inclusion of the straddle return variables does not alter the basic findings of column (1). We instead continue to estimate significant and negative coefficients for both the intercept and EA. Thus, even after controlling for variance risk premiums, we continue to find evidence that negative skew premiums are significant and that the premiums are elevated on EADs.

The estimated coefficient for EA is unaffected by the inclusion of the additional controls. We next address the issue of delta neutrality. In other words, one potential issue with the prior results is that the delta hedges employed may not result in positions that are empirically delta neutral because the Black and Scholes (1973) delta values may not provide a stock hedge that removes the correlation between the DNRR returns and stock returns. This could be due to the Black-Scholes model not explicitly incorporating the anticipated EAD price jumps and expected IV changes around EADs along with other issues such as the Black- Scholes model not incorporating stochastic volatility and non-EAD price jumps (Heston, 1993; Duffie et al., 2000). To test this, we add the variables STOCK_RET and EA x STOCK_RET as additional independent variables. In column (4) of Table 5, we find the resulting coefficient for STOCK_RET is positive and significant. This suggests that the delta hedge generated by the Black-Scholes model is too strong and the resulting DNRR returns are strongly related to the actual underlying return on both EADs and non-EADs. However, we note that the inclusion of the stock returns variables does not alter the size or the significance of the coefficient on EA. Instead, we continue to estimate a positive coefficient for EA (t-stat = 8.41) suggesting that stock returns and variance risk premiums do not account for the increase in EAD negative skew premiums when examining observations with negative implied skew.21 Finally, in column (5), we add the option-implied risk measures to the regressions (LOG_IMPSKEW and LOG_IMPVOL) along with their interactions with EA. We find several relationships of note. First, we estimate a positive coefficient for LOG_IMPSKEW. This suggests that the return to the DNRR falls as the implied skew becomes more negative. In 21 An alternative modeling choice is to not control for the stock return as an independent variable but, instead, alter the amount of the stock hedge. We find that using 90% of the original stock hedge helps to eliminate the correlation between the DNRR and stock returns. However, the regression results for Tables 5 and 6 are qualitatively unchanged by adjusting the amount of the stock hedge. 21 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "addition, we estimate a significant and positive coefficient for the interaction EA x LOG_IMPSKEW. This indicates that the returns to the DNRR are more sensitive to the level of the implied skew on EADs compared to non-EADs for observations that have negative implied skew. This again provides evidence that negative skew premiums are higher on EADs for stocks with negative implied skewness. We also estimate negative and significant coefficients for LOG_IMPVOL and the interaction EA x LOG_IMPVOL. This suggests that negative skew premiums are higher for firms with higher total risk and this relationship is elevated on EADs even though the DNRR position is constructed to be gamma neutral. Finally, we continue to estimate a negative and significant coefficient for EA. Thus, even with the inclusion of the additional controls, we still find the average return to the DNRR position is lower on EADs relative to non-EADs when examining negative implied skew observations. We next analyze the positive implied skew observations. Table 6 displays the results. Consistent with Table 3, we estimate a large positive intercept coefficient (t-stat = 18.73) for these observations. The estimated coefficient suggests that over the average three trading day period, the DNRR position earns 72 basis points. Again, this point estimate seems very large. However, and previously discussed, it is likely difficult for traders to capture this premium. We also estimate a positive and significant coefficient for EA (t-stat = 4.30). This suggests that the average return to holding the DNRR on EADs is higher when compared to non-EADs. We add the straddle return controls in column (2). We estimate a negative coefficient for STRADDLE_RET indicating the DNRR and straddle returns are negatively related in the positive implied skew subsample. In contrast, we estimate a positive coefficient for the interaction EA x STRADDLE_RET. Combined with the coefficient on STRADDLE_RET, the result suggests the return to straddles and DNRR are not related on EADs for the positive implied skew subsample.

Finally, in column (5), we again add the option-implied risk measures along with their interactions with EA. We again estimate a positive coefficient for LOG_IMPSKEW suggesting the DNRR returns are positively related to the slope of the IV skew. However, in comparison to the results for the negative IV skew observations, we do not estimate a significant coefficient on EA x LOG_IMPSKEW. However, and similar to the results of Table 5, we estimate a positive and significant coefficient for LOG_IMPVOL and EA x LOG_IMPVOL. This suggests that the DNRR returns are higher for high variance stocks and this relationship is stronger on EADs when examining the positive option-implied skew observations. Combined, the results of Tables 4 and 5 indicate some interesting new facts. First, traders profit, on average, by betting against the IV skew. When the IV skew is negative (positive) the average return to the DNRR position is negative (positive). In addition, the returns to betting against the IV skew increase on the EADs. In other words, negative (positive) skew premiums are elevated for firms that have negative (positive) implied skew on EADs. These results do not appear to be subsumed by concurrent variance risk premiums and stock returns. Finally, our results suggest that the returns to trading against the IV skew are higher for high variance stocks and this relationship is stronger on EADs. Trading Volume and Open Interest As an additional test, we investigate how the relative trading volume and open interest in puts versus calls affect the returns to the DNRRs around EAs. The results of the prior section suggest supply-demand imbalances affect the returns to the DNRRs. However, the option- implied statistics (skew and variance) are, potentially, mechanically linked to the DNRR returns. This may be because we calculate the option-implied skew and variance values from option prices and the returns to the DNRR and straddle positions depend on these same prices. 23 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "Thus, we re-estimate our results when using LOG_PC_OI as a dependent variable. Again, LOG_PC_OI is the log ratio of the open interest of puts to calls one trading day before the EAD. We also define LOG_PC_VLM as the log ratio of the number of put-to-call contracts traded over the prior quarter. While we cannot determine if the put or call positions were opened by a buy or sell order, we suspect that excess open interest or trading in the put wing relative to the call wing is indicative of excess demand for downside protection which, in turn, should lead to lower DNRR returns. For these tests, we use the EAD subsample and display the results in Table 7. In columns (1) and (2), we use both the negative and positive IV skew observations. In column (1) we estimate a strong negative coefficient for LOG_PC_OI (t-stat = 11.89). The estimated coefficient suggests that a one standard deviation increase in the log ratio of put-to- call open interest is associated with roughly a 9 bps drop in the DNRR returns. Thus, for EADs, a higher put-to-call open interest ratio is indicative of excess downside protection demand leading to larger negative skew premiums around EAs. We generate similar results in column (2) when using the put-to-call trading ratio. We estimate a strong negative coefficient for LOG_PC_VLM (t-stat = 12.36) that indicates that a high put-to-call trading ratio in the periods before the EA is predictive of low DNRR returns. In columns (3) and (4), we use the negative option-implied skew observations. The results are similar to those in columns (1) and (2): higher put-to-call open interest or trading volume is associated with lower EAD DNRR returns. Finally, in columns (5) and (6), we limit the sample to the positive implied skew observations. The results are similar to the other regressions. While we estimate lower t-statistics compared to those in columns (3) and (4), we note the estimated coefficients are similar in size. In short, the results in this section confirm that the returns to skew trading are intimately tied to investors’ relative demand for downside and upside protection. 24 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "Systematic and Idiosyncratic Risk We next test if systematic versus idiosyncratic risk proxies help to explain the cross- section of skew risk premiums on EADs. Firms with higher systematic risk impose more market-related risk on investors with their disclosures because their information is more relevant to the updating of other firms’ values and their information provides more information about the overall economy. Thus, as Barth and So (2014) argue, option-implied risks should be heightened for firms with greater systematic risk. Barth and So (2014) indeed show that variance risk premiums are higher for bellwether firms around their EADs. However, prior literature also shows heightened option risk premiums for firms with higher idiosyncratic risk (e.g., Cao and Han, 2013). One explanation for this result is that market makers must charge a premium for options on firms with high idiosyncratic volatility due to their higher arbitrage costs. Similarly, skew premiums around EAD may be more related to idiosyncratic risks as systematic risks can be hedged using index options. As stated before, we test several different measures of systematic and idiosyncratic risk. In addition, we define the indicator variable POSSKEW that is set to one when an observation has positive implied skew. We display the results in Table 8 when using the EA subsample. We note that all the regressions include several controls but we suppress their coefficients for brevity. In column (1), we use LOG_MRKCAP as a measure of systematic risk. As expected, we estimate a strong positive coefficient for POSSKEW (t-stat = 32.39) suggesting that DNRR returns are more positive when the IV skew is also positive. In addition, we estimate a positive coefficient for LOG_MRKCAP (t-stat = 10.01), a negative coefficient for the interaction POSSKEW x LOG_MRKCAP, and an F-test reveals that the sum of the coefficient for LOG_MRKCAP and the coefficient for POSSKEW x LOG_MRKCAP is significant. This suggests that for negative (positive) IV skew observations, DNRR returns are less negative (positive) for larger firms.

    "text": "larger firms, regardless if the firm has negative or positive implied skewness. This again is contrasted to the results of Barth and So (2014) who find that EAD variance risk premiums are larger for bigger firms. In column (2), we use BETA as the main independent variable. In contrast to the results of column (1), we find the DNRR returns are more extreme as BETA increases. This is interesting given the results when using LOG_MRKCAP and suggests that firms with higher systematic variance-and not just high return correlations-have more extreme DNRR returns. In column (3), we use LOG_SYSVAR. Consistent with the above logic, we find DNRR returns are more extreme for firms with more systematic variance. However, in column (4), we find similar results when we use LOG_IDIOVAR. From the results in columns (3) and (4), it appears that the source of the return variance (i.e., systematic versus idiosyncratic) does not matter to explaining the returns to trading skew. Instead, and as shown in column (5), we find the DNRR returns are highly related to total past return variance (LOG_TOTALVAR). The estimated coefficients are large and economically significant. The coefficients are also similar in magnitude, in absolute terms, to the coefficients when LOG_MRKCAP in column (1). Thus, larger firms with more stable returns tend to have less extreme DNRR returns and EAD skew risk premiums are related to firms’ total variance risk. Finally, in column (6), we confirm the source of the return variance is not important for explaining skew premiums. In particular, we fail to estimate strong coefficients for SIVARRATIO and the interaction of EA x SIVARRATIO. Thus, the log ratio of systematic to idiosyncratic variance is not conditionally important for explaining the cross-section of the DNRR returns around EADs. 5.5 Reporting characteristics As a final set of tests, we investigate if firms’ reporting characteristics help explain the cross-section of DNRR returns on EADs.

    "text": "saliency has on skew risk premiums. Report saliency is related to the amount of attention that a report may garner from investors. When firms report by themselves, investors may key on their announcements because the information is less likely to be diversified away by other firms’ reports. In addition, prior research has shown that EAs are associated with higher gambling behavior from traders (Liu et al., 2020). Thus, higher EA saliency may also draw in additional speculators who wish to take leveraged positions in the underlying stock but lack alternative concurrent events to bet on. We also examine if the timing of the EA is associated with skew premiums. Savor and Wilson (2016), for example, suggest that firms that report earlier in a reporting quarter will tend to have higher EA premiums due to the stocks providing more information about macroeconomic conditions. For firms that report later in a calendar quarter, in contrast, most of the reported information about macroeconomic conditions will be known by the time of the EA. Hann et al. (2019) also show that firm disclosures will tend to reduce peer firm uncertainty, and consequently, this may also suggest that earlier reporters carry higher risk. However, the release of earnings announcement later in the quarter is likely related to issues positively related to firm-specific risk. For example, a delay in reporting may be caused by higher reporting or operating complexity (e.g., Sengupta, 2004). Finally, we investigate firms’ past ability to meet or beat their earnings targets. Prior research has shown that there are positive capital market effects for firms that consistently achieve analyst-based targets. Kasznik and McNichols (2002) and Bartov et al. (2002) find firms that can meet or beat their earnings targets enjoy an equity premium and the equity premium is not transitory. In addition, Neururer et al. (2020) find that firms that consistently meet or beat their earnings targets have lower IV and variance risk premiums. This may lower investors’ desire for downside protection in the put wing leading to higher DNRR returns. However, Chu et al.

    "text": "are more likely to have engaged in earnings management. Moreover, firms that are subject to SEC enforcement actions are more likely to consistently beat analyst EPS targets. Thus, it is possible investors will attempt to obtain more downside protections for these firms. We consequently define three additional variables. First, and similar to Hirshleifer et al. (2009), we define SALIENCY as negative one times the log number of EAs that occur on the same date as the observation. Thus, a high SALIENCY value means that the firm reported without many competing EAs from other firms. We note that the values for SALIENCY use the entire I/B/E/S sample and, thus, are not limited to the observations that had sufficient options data to be included in the final data set. Next, we create the variable LOG_REPORTTIME defined as the log number of days the EAD is after the start of the calendar quarter. Finally, we define MEETORBEAT as the proportion of times the firm has met or beat its mean earnings target over the last two years. To be included in the data set, we require a firm have five prior earnings announcements in the last two years where we are able to calculate if the firm met or beat its earnings targets. This requirement reduces the number of EAD observations to 49,951.22 Table 9 displays the results. In column (1), we use SALIENCY as the main independent variable. We estimate negative coefficients for SALIENCY and the interaction POSSKEW x SALIENCY. Each coefficient is not strongly significant, but the results do indicate that DNRR returns are lower for firms with positive and negative implied skews. This may indicate that as SALIENCY increases investors seek additional downside risk protection. This would result in lower DNRR returns regardless of the sign of implied skewness. We use LOG_REPORTTIME in column (2). We estimate a negative coefficient for LOG_REPORTTIME and a positive coefficient for the 22 We do not tabulate the summary statistics for these three reporting variables. However, the median value for SALIENCY is -5.10 suggesting that for the average EAD in the sample, 164 firms reported their quarterly earnings values. In addition, the median value for LOG_REPORTTIME is 3.37 indicating that the average delay in quarterly earnings reporting is 29 days from the beginning of the quarter. Finally, the median value for MEETORBEAT is 0.75. This value is consistent with Chu et al. (2019) and shows that, on average, firms are able to meet or beat the EPS targets. 28 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "interaction of LOG_REPORRTIME with POSSKEW. Much like results when using total risk in Table 8, we find that reporting later in the quarter exacerbates the returns to the DNRR returns, depending on if the implied skew is positive or negative. We observe the opposite pattern in column (3) with MEETORBEAT. In this case, firms that consistently meet or beat their earnings targets are less extreme DNRR returns around EADs. In column (4), we analyze the three variables together. The results are similar to those generated in the separate regressions. The only substantial difference in column (4) from the other results is that we no longer estimate a significant coefficient for SALIENCY, although the estimated coefficients in columns (1) and (4) for SALIENCY are not significantly different from each other. We also continue to find that LOG_REPORTTIME (MEETORBEAT) is associated with more (less) extreme DNRR returns, depending on the sign of the implied skew. Again, it appears that LOG_REPORTTIME and MEETORBEAT help proxy for stock risk and this appears to influence the DNRR returns. Finally, in column (5), we additionally control for the option-implied risk measures (LOG_IMPSKEW and LOG_IMPVOL) and their interactions with POSSKEW. In comparison to the results of column (4), we no longer estimate strong coefficients for LOG_REPORTTIME and MEETORBEAT. This indicates that LOG_REPORTTIME and MEETORBEAT influence the implied risk measures but, after accounting for the variables’ effect on the option-implied price distribution, the timing of the earnings report and firms’ past ability to achieve its earnings targets do not have additional power to explain the cross-section of DNRR returns. In contrast, we now estimate strong negative coefficients for SALIENCY and POSSKEW x SALIENCY. This provides evidence that DNRR returns are impacted by report visibility and this effect is not captured by the implied risk measures. In particular, investors appear to overbid for negative skew protection when report visibility is higher. 29 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

    "text": "In this study, we examine the premiums to skew risk around quarterly EADs embedded in equity option prices. EAs represent large information disclosure events and they can change stock prices dramatically. In addition, prior research finds that realized stock returns are more negatively skewed on EADs relative to non-EADs. However, some theoretical option pricing models suggest that the predictable EA jumps should not affect the relative pricing of OTM puts to calls. To operationalize skew risk premiums, we study the returns to DNRRs. Our findings suggest that skew premiums are significant and elevated around EAs. In particular, DNRRs earn significantly lower returns for firms with negative implied skewness. However, we also present evidence that DNRRs returns are higher on EADs when the firms have positive implied skew. These results hold when we control for the contemporaneous returns to ATM straddles suggesting that the documented skew premiums are not subsumed by variance risk premiums. We also find that IV skews are highly predictive of DRNN returns and DNRR return sensitivity to implied skews is higher on EADs. We also present evidence that DNRR returns are more extreme for firms with high total variance. However, our results indicate the source of the return variance, be it systematic or idiosyncratic variance, is not important for explaining the cross-section of DNRR returns on EADs. Finally, we find that EA saliency, EA report timing, and firms’ record of meeting earnings targets help explain the cross-section of EAD DNRR returns. In particular, we find consistent evidence that the premium to hedging downside skew risk is heightened when firms report by themselves. 30 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3648496",

This involves buying OTM puts (delta range between -0.4 and -0.1) and selling OTM calls (delta range between 0.1 and 0.4) along with a long stock hedge. We scaled the profit/loss by the total capital required to initiate the trade. The put position size is +1 and the call position size is selected to make the position initially gamma neutral. The stock position is selected to make the position initially delta neutral. The position is initiated either -1 or -11 trading days before the earnings announcement date (EAD) and closed either +1 or -9 trading days after/before the EAD. See the text for more details. Independent Variables EA Indicator variable set to one if the observation is from the earnings announcement sub-sample and set to zero otherwise. STOCK_RET The log return to equity. The value is adjusted for splits and dividends. The position is initiated either -1 or -11 trading days before the EAD and closed either +1 or -9 trading days after/before the EAD. See the text for more details. STRADDLE_RET The return to the long straddle strategy. This involves buying ATM puts (delta range between -0.6 and -0.4) and buying ATM calls (delta range between 0.4 and 0.6). We scaled the profit/loss by the capital required to initiate the trade. The put and call position size is -1. The position is initiated either -1 or -11 trading days before the EAD and closed either +1 or -9 trading days after/before the EAD.

IMPVOL The (natural log of the) straddle implied volatility. The straddle (LOG_IMPVOL) implied volatility is the mean of the ATM call and put implied volatilities. LOG_PC_OI The log ratio of the put to call open interest on trading day -1 from the earnings announcement date. MRKCAP The firm market capitalization in millions of dollars from quarter t – 1. VIX The (natural log of the) CBOE VIX at the date of the option (LOG_VIX) position creation. EXPTIME The (natural log of the) difference in calendar days between the (LOG_EXPTIME) option expiration date and the date of the option position initiation. BETA The firm’s CAPM over the prior 91 calendar days before the position initiation date. The market is set to the CRSP value- weighted index.
