This model is based on the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt (BSB) equa- tion, which we will solve using two methods: trinomial model and finite-difference. We have priced different portfolios: call, put, straddle, and bull spread to highlight certain properties of the UVM model, namely: the sub-additivity of the payoff, the comparison between Black-Scholes (BS) model and UVM, or the impact of the change in the volatility band on the portfolio price. We also looked at a variant of the UVM model: the Lagrangian UVM which relies onoptionhedgingandwehavepointedoutnumericallythattheincreaseinthenumber of options in the hedging portfolio narrows the price range, thus giving more precise results for the price of the derivatives.

    "text": "El Jerrari Robust option pricing Introduction Derivativesarecontractswhosevalueislinkedtotheassociatedunderlyingasset. Theseprod- ucts experienced a significant increase in the volumes traded from the 1980s [14]. Derivatives are divided into four main classes, namely: options, swaps, forwards and exotic products: more complex financial instruments that are traded on OTC markets. Derivatives are mainly used by individuals as well as by financial institutions for a variety of purposes ranging from hedging to speculation including ’synthetic exposure’ [30]. One of the important issues re- lated to these products is the determination of their “fair value” prices which depends on the evolution of the value of the underlying asset. There are different methods and manners for the pricing of derivatives namely: analytical solution like the closed price given by [33] for the volatility swap or numerical approach like the Monte-Carlo simulation used by [25], [27] and [24] to price American options, or finite difference method used by [5] paper. The “fair value” of options can be determined in a simplified context, where markets are considered as free of arbitrage by using the binomial model [12] or the Black-Scholes model. In this context, the option price is the expectation of the discounted payoff under the risk-neutral measure which is unique only in a complete market (every position can be hedged or is replicable), as underlined in the articles [16] and [15]. The Black-Scholes model published [13] is a simplified model widely used in finance which gives an analytical price formula, considering that the volatility of the underlying is constant. However, in the real world, volatility is not constant. More complex models have appeared to correct volatility, based on stochastic volatility such as: Hull White model [19], Stein Stein model [31], the He- ston model [17] and Scott model [28]. Another model has taken a different approach like the uncertain volatility model (UVM) introduced by [2], which considers that volatility belong to a certain interval given as input thanks to options prices available in the market. The latter model will specify a price range delimited by a upper price corresponding to the best scenario, in the case of a long position in the derivative, and a lower price representative of the worst scenario of the volatility path. This study on the uncertain volatility model (UVM) is divided into five parts: In section 1, we present a benchmark of the main volatility models used. In section 2 we will introduce Black-Scholes model and price some vanilla options using this latter model. This part can be seen as an analysis of the different results of the Black-Scholes model (BS) that we will compare with the UVM model. In section 3, we will present the UVM and Lagrangian UVM models, as well as the various properties of those models. In section 4, we will discuss the implementation of the UVM model using the trinominal tree and see the difference with the classic BS model. Finally in section 5, we will introduce and implement the UVM method by adopting the finite difference method on the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt (BSB) equation. 6",

(cid:0) (cid:1) We consider a filtered probability space Ω,F,(F ) ,Q where F is a filtration, and Q t t≥0 t the risk-neutral measure. TheBlack-Scholesequation(BS)modelconsidersthatthevolatilityofthespotisconstant and the returns follow a log-normal distribution, as specified in [6]. Indeed, the underlying asset follows the equation below of GBM (Geometric Brownian motion): dS = S [rdt+σdZ ], 0 ≤ t ≤ T t t t With: S : the risky asset price at time t, r: risk-free rate, σ: volatility of the spot S, Z : t t Brownian motion, and T: the maturity. As quoted in [6]: S σ2 ln( t ) ∼ N(r− ,σ2T) S 2 0 Returns follow a log-normal distribution, which facilitates the calculation of the price of options, which makes this model very tractable, easy to implement and to calibrate. How- ever, considering constant volatility does not reflect the characteristics of the options market: like the heavy tails and asymmetry of returns or the smile of volatility, as specified in [21] and [10]. Indeed, on the options market we notice that volatility increases when the option is in the money or out of the money, this is called the smile of volatility, this stylised fact is not reflected with the BS model. 1.2 Heston Model ThemostpopularstochasticvolatilitymodelistheHestonmodelbecauseitsatisfiesanumber of characteristics of the options market and it has an explicit formula for the pricing options which gives more accurate prices than those offered by the BS model as showed in the article [11]. Heston model uses a stochastic volatility model where volatility follows a Cox-Ingersoll- Ross (CIR) process [17]: (cid:112) dS = rS dt+ V S dWS t t t t t (cid:112) dV = k(θ−V )dt+σ V dWV t t t t dWSdWV = ρdt t t √ Where: V volatility of the spot S, σ the volatility of the volatility (or volatility of V ), θ: t t long-term reversion, k: the speed of mean reversion, WS and WV Brownian motions associ- t t ated with respectively spot and volatility, and ρ: the correlation between spot and volatility of the risky asset. 7",

Thismeanreversionpropertyisimportant because it is consistent with market observations: volatility will move towards its average value [22]. Formula of the expectation and the variance of the volatility given below are extracted from [8]: (cid:0) (cid:1) E[V ] = V e−kt +θ 1−e−kt t 0 σ2 σ2 VAR(V ) = V (cid:0) e−kt −e−2kt (cid:1) +θ (cid:0) 1−e−kt (cid:1)2 t 0 k 2k We note that when t goes to infinity, the expected value of V goes to θ, the long-term t mean reversion, and the variance of V converges to θσ2. We note that if the mean reversion t 2k speed k goes to infinity and that the other variables are constant, the variance converges towards 0: the volatility V converges quickly towards the long-term average. Now, if the t volatility of the volatility σ takes large values, the variance also increases and therefore con- vergence to the long-term average will occur later in time. To determine the constants of the model, namely: the long-term reversion θ, the speed of mean reversion k and the volatility of the volatility σ, we perform the calibration which consists in finding these constants so that the price of the vanilla options given by this model is as close as possible to the market, as mentioned in [8]. [7] presents two calibration methods using historical data or the implied method which uses volatility surface. TheHestonmodelgivesananalyticalformulaforthepriceofoptions, itismoreconsistent with the market than the BS model. Indeed, this model reproduces the smile of volatility and the returns are modeled by a fat-tailed distribution, as specified in [22]. In addition, the correlation between the stock S and volatility plays an important role in obtaining a more realistic model, as mentioned in [17]. However, its implementation and calibration are more complicated than the BS model. 1.3 Others Stochastic volatility model There are also other stochastic volatility models such as: the Stein-Stein model or the White Hull model which we will briefly present.

However, it is better to have a simpler and faster numerical solution, as specified in [31]. In this model, volatility follows a normal distribu- tion, which makes the model very tractable than the Heston model (non-central chi-square distribution for volatility),[8]. Like Heston model, Stein-Stein model is a mean reverting process. When time goes to infinity the expected volatility converges towards θ with a finite variance, [8]. The disadvantage of this model is that volatility can take negative values, because volatil- ity follows a normal distribution which can of course take non-positive values with a non-zero probability. To solve this problem, we can think of a model where volatility follows a normal logarithmic distribution, this model is the Hull-White, [18].

Indeed, one limit of the model is that asset return does not follow a normal distribution, which can be seen on empirical data. However, the returns have a peaked distribution with heavy tails, as specified by the paper [4], which shows the impact that this can have on the risk assessment. The weak point of the Black-scholes model is that it considers the volatility of the asset to be constant, while empirical studies show that the volatility depends on the strike and the maturity of the options, as pointed out in the article [23]. Indeed, if we consider that time to maturity is the same for the options and we focus on the evolution of volatility according to the strike, we obtain the classic figure of the volatility smile. Moreover, if we add to this evolution of volatility, the maturity parameter we get a three dimensional figure called 14",

Thus, we see that the volatility is not constant on the empirical data. There are also other limits which we will only mention without going into details, namely: the interest rate is not constant over time as considered by the model, and the transaction cost need to be included in the BS model as specified in [9]. The papers [23] also states that this model is widely used and widespread in finance for its simplicity and give a price close to the market price, despite the limitations that this model may have. 15",

In [2] and [3] papers, the authors present the UVM model: we consider that the evolution of volatility will remain in a band determined fromthepricesofvanillaoptionsinordertopricemoreelaborateoptionscalledexoticoptions. In this model we consider Stock S as the risky asset, its price follows the dynamics below: dS = S (σ dZ +µ dt), 0 ≤ t ≤ T (3.1) t t t t t where: • Z a Brownian motion, µ ≥ 0 is called the drift. Under the risk neutral measure the t t drift is equal to the interest rate r. • σ is the volatility that is bounded between two constants σ and σ . t min max σ (cid:54) σ (cid:54) σ (3.2) min t max These bounds are inputs of the model and can be determined by choosing an implied volatility band where this volatility of the options available in the market falls within this interval. Therefore, determining a volatility interval for implied volatility: σ implied is equivalent to finding a interval of value for the asset’s volatility σ , as mentioned in t [3]. Assuming that the stocks S pays no dividends and that there is no transaction costs in trading, we consider a portfolio composed of: an option of value W(S,t) and a short position ∆ on the asset S, [32]. Π = W −∆S Using Ito formula : ∂W ∂W 1∂2W dΠ = dt+ dS + dSdS −∆dS ∂t ∂S 2 ∂S2 Using also that: dSdS = σ2S2dt we get: t (cid:18) ∂W 1 ∂2W (cid:19) (cid:18) ∂W (cid:19) dΠ = + σ2S2 dt+ −∆ dS ∂t 2 ∂S2 ∂S Choosing that ∆ = ∂W/∂S will eliminate the term associated with dS.

Therefore, for a short or long position, the price of a option is between the two extreme values associated with the best and the worst case, almost surely. In general, we are more interested in the worst case scenario because it gives us information about how risky the portfolio is and we can hedge against this scenario. Therefore, the UVM gives a price band for a portfolio of derivatives delimited by W− and W+.

W in the BSB equation can be either W+ or W−. The equation (3.3) is a generalization of the Black-Scholes differential equation, called the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation (BSB). In the case where σ = σ , we find the classic min max Black-Scholes equation. We note that the BSB is similar to BS provided that the volatility is constant. In the BSB equation, the volatility is determined by the convexity of W, and (cid:104) (cid:105) when the volatility is σ∗ = σ ∂2W(St,t) , the value given by the BSB equation corresponds to t ∂S2 the extreme value: either the upper values or the lower values, depending on the position on the option, this result will be proved in the next section. There is also another special case, when the second derivative of W relative to the Stock S (the gamma) has a constant sign (either positive or negative), the volatility in this case will be equal to a constant. This implies that the BSB equation simplifies to the BS equation with a volatility of σ if gamma is positive and σ if gamma is negative (for the higher max min price W+). We also note that the BSB equation is nonlinear unlike the BS equation, and therefore its resolution can only be done numerically. The solution of the BSB equation can be formulated as below, [3]: (cid:34) (cid:35) N (cid:88) (cid:0) (cid:1) W+(S ,t) = Sup EP e−r(tj−t)F S t t j tj P j=1 (cid:34) (cid:35) N (cid:88) (cid:0) (cid:1) W−(S ,t) = Inf EP e−r(tj−t)F S t P t j tj j=1 Where: • P is the set of all the measures on the paths which verify the dynamic equation of S t (3.1) and that the volatility belongs to the band (3.2). • Ep represents the conditional expectation under the set P and under the condition of all the information up to time t. 3.2 Hedging with underlying asset S and Bond B In this section we will discuss the hedging of a short position in derivative instrument with payoff φ = (cid:80)N e−r(tj−t)F (cid:0) S (cid:1) .

We highlight this sub-additivity when we choose a portfolio made up of options with gammas of different signs. In this case, there is no constant volatility that will give the value of the overall portfolio. On the one hand, if the option prices are convex (for example the call and the put payoff with the same strike K, then the straddle which is their sum is also convex) the BSB equation is reduced to a classical BS equation with constant volatility, and in this particular case there is equality between the price of the overall portfolio and the sum of the individual portfolios. On the other hand, when the options that make up the portfolio have different convexities, the risk of the overall portfolio is reduced and, therefore, the price range will be narrower compared to the sum of the individual portfolios. 3.4 The Lagrangian UVM: Hedging with options In this section, we consider a short position in a derivative with different cash flows F at time j t . To hedge this portfolio, we will use M European options with cash flows G ≤ G ≤ ... ≤ j 1 2 G at maturities t(cid:48) ≤ t(cid:48) ≤ ... ≤ t(cid:48) . The price of these options is noted C ,C ,...,C and M 1 2 M 1 2 M the proportions associated with each option are λ ,λ ,...,λ . Therefore, the price of the 1 2 M hedging portfolio can be written as follows: (cid:80)M λ C .

We can note that the Lagrangian UVM developed here corresponds to a method of static hedging because the hedge ratio (λ ,...λ ) are constant and not time dependent. 1 M 3.5 Calibration of the volatility band The article of [3], highlights the method of calibration of the volatility band that we present in this section. To find the extreme values of volatility: σ and σ , we can use the implied volatility min max of vanilla options. Specifically, we will plot the implied volatility found from the market price usingtheBlack-Scholesformulaforliquidoptions,andthenwewilltakeasthevolatilityband, an interval that will contain all the implied volatilities of those options. Indeed, considering a range of volatility for the security is equivalent to finding a range of implied volatility. σ ≤ σ (t,T) ≤ σ min impl max with T the maturity time of an option. A better calibration would be to consider a time-dependent volatility interval in order to limit an overestimation of volatility and to give a more accurate range for the value of the portfolio. (cid:115) (cid:115) 1 (cid:90) T 1 (cid:90) T σ2 (s)ds ≤ σ (t,T) ≤ σ2 (s)ds T −t min impl T −t max t t We can notice that if we take σ (t) = σ and σ (t) = σ , we find exactly the min min max max same range of volatility as before. Therefore, the implicit volatility of the derivatives used as inputs must be within the range defined by σ and σ . We also note that this time min max dependent calibration will give a smaller volatility range than the constant calibration and therefore a smaller and more accurate price range for the portfolio. Indeed, option price increases with volatility: the upper price W+ will decrease (because the upper value of the volatility range decreases) and the lower price W− will increase, thus giving a narrower range for the portfolio’s price. 23",

To approximate the solution to the BSB equation, we use a finite-difference scheme to provide an explicit solution. We first consider that the stock S follows a trinomial model: at the next time, S can reach three levels: up U, middle M or down D. We also assume that the tree is a recombining tree, which implies that UD = M2. We consider T as the maturity time by years, N the trading periods, and the time discretization becomes δ = T . N must be large enough so that the time discretization is as small as possible to N consider the stock S continuous.[2]. √ U = eσmax ∆t+r∆t M = er∆t √ D = e−σmax ∆t+r∆t Figure 1: Trinomial tree : Stock S with (cid:16) √ (cid:17) P (p) = p· 1− σmax ∆t U 2 P (p) = 1−2p M (cid:16) √ (cid:17) P (p) = p· 1+σmax ∆t D 2 Where: σ2 min (cid:54) p (cid:54) 1/2 2σ2 max 4.2 Finite-difference scheme After the introduction of the trinomial model, we will use it to approach the BSB equation.

We have plotted the market price of the options, the extreme prices given by the UVM method, as a function of the strike K. We find that the market price is well within the price range given by the UVM method, almost surely. Indeed, if this condition were not verified, there would be an arbitrage strategy. The drawback of this method is that the price range given by UVM method is wide, especially for the at the money (ATM) calls, as we note in the figures 9 and 10, below for K = 210. 30",

We consider a portfolio composed of two calls: a first long call with strike K1 and a short second call with strike K2, where K1 < K2, this spread option is called: bull spread. We will first plot the gamma of this option to show that its sign is not constant as a function of the Stock S. We took K1 = 160 and K2 = 230. Figure 15: Gamma of the Bull spread We see that the gamma of the bull spread is positive over the interval [0,180] then it becomes negative over [180,400]. In this case, the UVM price will be different from the Black-Scholes price because there is no constant volatility that will give exactly the UVM price. Figure 16: Black-Scholes and UVM prices comparison We note that the prices given by Black-Scholes (taking the extreme volatilities) are in the price range proposed by UVM. Precisely, to calculate the Black-Scholes upper price for the bull spread, we keep a constant volatility equal to σ and for the lower price we took max a volatility of σ . min 34",

We will take the same portfolio composed of Bull spread options (whose payoff can be written as the payoff of long call K1 and short call K2) as the previous section and compare the price of the overall and the individual portfolios. More precisely, we will study the prices for the bull spread with the sum of the prices of the following portfolios: long call with strike K1 and short call with strike K2, using UVM method.

We notice that the spread between upper and lower prices is strongly reduced with the lambda UVM method. We can also note that the spread is almost equal to zero for the Apple calls with the same strike as the hedging portfolio’s calls. For example we see in the figure 21 that the Apple calls with strikes 180, 210 and 220 have a spread of zero. We keep the same portfolio as before but this time we use four calls as inputs to hedge the portfolio. 40",

Indeed, let us consider 4 hedging options with λ = 0, and keeping the other λ 2 equal to the optimal ratio given for the three hedging options (as for the previous example), in this case the price range proposed by 4 hedging options would be equal to that given by 3 inputs, and as we optimize the lambdas the result given by 4 inputs would necessarily be better than that given by a lower number of hedging options. 41",

We will now study UVM pricing for barrier options, by approximating the BSB equation using the finite-difference method: by discretizing the time t and the values of the asset S. There are studies and articles in this direction like the papers of [20] and [26]. In this section, we will more focus on the article of [26]. Recall the expression of the BSB equation for a derivative with payoff F (S) N (cid:40) (cid:16) (cid:17) (cid:104) (cid:105) ∂W(S,t) +r S∂W(S,t) −W(S,t) + 1σ2 ∂2W(S,t) S2∂2W(S,t) = 0 ∂t ∂S 2 ∂S2 ∂S2 W(S,t ) = F (S) N N with: (cid:20) ∂2W+(cid:21) (cid:26) σ if ∂2W+ (cid:62) 0 σ = max ∂S2 ∂S2 σ if ∂2W+ < 0 min ∂S2 (cid:20) ∂2W−(cid:21) (cid:26) σ if ∂2W− (cid:54) 0 σ = max ∂S2 ∂S2 σ if ∂2W− > 0 min ∂S2 To approximate BSB equation, we can discretize: ∂W(S,t), ∂W(S,t) ,and ∂2W(S,t). Using ∂t ∂S ∂S2 Taylor Expansion, we get that: ∂W(S,t) W(S,t+∆t)−W(S,t) = +O(∆t) ∂t ∆t for ∆t << 1, we use that ∂W(S,t) ≈ W(S,t+∆t)−W(S,t), the error in this case is ∆t. ∂t ∆t ∂W(S,t) W(S +∆S,t)−W(S −∆S,t) = +O(∆S2) ∂S 2∆S For ∂W(S,t), we used the centered approximation, we can show that in this case the error is ∂S of the order of ∆S2, so this last method is more precise than that used for ∂W(S,t) ∂t ∂2W(S,t) W(S +∆S,t)+W(S −∆S,t)−2W(S,t) = +O(∆S2) ∂S2 ∆S2 ∂2W(S,t) W(S +∆S,t)+W(S −∆S,t)−2W(S,t) ≈ ∂S2 ∆S2 This formulation of the second order derivative is centered, and the error of approximation is of the order of ∆S2. We obtain this formulation by making the difference of the Taylor expansion of W(S +∆S,t) and W(S −∆S,t). Time t ∈ [0,T] and asset S ∈ [S ,S ] are discretized into N and M sub-intervals min max respectively. More precisely, t = i × ∆t, with ∆t = T , and S = S + j × ∆S with i N j min ∆S = Smax−Smin, for i ∈ {0,1,..,N} and j ∈ {0,1,..,M}. M 44",

Consequently, the Lagragian UVM method reduces the deviation of the price envelope compared to the UVM method. 5.3.3 UVM and Lagrangian methods with two hedging calls In this previous case, we were only interested in a call as a hedging instrument. Now, we will deal with the case of two calls to hedge an up-and-out call, and we will plot the upper and lower value of the portfolio for the Lagrangian UVM and the classic UVM methods according to the value of the stock S, and compare them. λ−UVM for Up-and-out call Value S 0 min S 240 max T 50/365 K 112 K1 210 hedging K2 220 hedging σ 0.1 min σ 0.2 max r 0.07 N 100 M 30 Table 12: Parameters of the up-and-out call’s range λ-UVM-prices Figure 32: Prices of up-and-out call using Lagrangian UVM and classic UVM methods 50",

Indeed, we have represented a barrier call, with the characteristics of the table above, which we have priced with two methods and using two calls as inputs in the case of λ-UVM. The latter method gives greater precision over the possible range of portfolio’s values. Conclusion In this study, we have presented the option pricing method using a volatility range. We determined the possible price range using two methods: the trinomial model and the finite- difference. With this first method, we priced the Apple vanilla options and we highlighted a number of results. It has been shown that the market price is indeed included in the price range given by the UVM method, almost surely. We have compared the classic BS model with the UVM model: we have shown that for a convex or concave price payoff UVM and BS give the same result, while for a mixed convexity option, it was pointed out that the two previous methods provide different results. One of the key results of the UVM method is risk diversification: we have underlined the property of portfolio price sub-additivity which indicates that the overall portfolio is less risky than the sum of the individual portfolios. We also introduced a variant of the UVM method called Lagrangian UVM, we implemented it with different hedging portfolios and we were able to show the importance and the impact of hedging portfolio on the price range. The last point discussed is the implementation of analternativemethodtosolveBSBequation: finite-differencemethodforthebarrieroptions. We have seen two approaches for option pricing using UVM: with trinomial tree and finite difference, there is also another more efficient method using Monte Carlo method especially if we are working with multiple assets. 51",
