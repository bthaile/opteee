    "text": "Social interactions allow for information dissemination about technologies, products, job opportunities, and beliefs (Jackson, 2010; Jackson, 2011). In finance, a substantial body of evidence shows that information sharing with peers plays an important role for investment decision-making, including stock market participation and portfolio choice (e.g., Duflo & Saez, 2003; Hong, et al., 2004; Bursztyn, et al., 2014; Li, 2015). In social settings, however, individuals are selective about the information they want to share with others. For example, people may tend to boast about good stock trades, favoring the transmission of appealing but inaccurate ideas about active trading (Shiller, 1995; Shiller, 2015), or they may try to convince others that they are wealthier or more intelligent than what they really are.3 Despite extensive research on the effects of social interactions on investment choices, the role that selective communication has on the diffusion of trading strategies remains largely unexplored.4 In this paper, we use data from a large- scale financial education program to study the effects from noisy word-of-mouth communication on the decision to participate in the stock market. We show that biased signals from peers disproportionally attract uninformed individuals to equity trading. These investors overestimate the value of active trading and generate inferior returns once they enter the stock market. Canonical models of social learning assume that peer choices are perfectly observed by members of the social network (Banerjee, 1992; Bikhchandani, et al., 1992). In practice, peer preferences and outcomes are not always observed directly, and such information is often transmitted via informal conversations. When negative outcomes are filtered out to present a positive self-view to others (e.g., trades that generated low or negative returns), there is less 3 This behavior has long been recognized and studied in sociology and psychology. See for example, Schlenker (1980), Leary & Kowalski (1990), and Gonzales & Hancock (2011). Although people often avoid lying given their preference for being seen as honest (Abeler, et al., 2019), they might selectively omit information that is unfavorable, or that may give the impression that they are not successful. Bénabou & Tirole (2002) present a general economic model in which agents protect their self-esteem by engaging in self-deception through selective memory awareness. 4 The notable exception is Han et al. (2018). The authors introduce a model of social interactions in which investors are more likely to discuss profitable investments to examine active versus passive investments. 2",

    "text": "information available to those that are forming an opinion about the value of an activity. Our paper attempts to study how investment choices are affected by biases in information transmission. Our analysis relies on a natural experiment involving exogenously assigned peer groups. Starting in 2008, the Colombian Stock Exchange (CSE) launched a series of professional courses on financial topics;5 the majority focused on equity strategies (the program is discussed in detail in Section 3). Registered individuals were assigned to small sections that spent the duration of each course studying about stock trading in a classroom setting – on average 16 students per class. We combine class records with administrative microdata of stock transactions to distinguish between students with trading experience and those with no trading background. In other words, we observe the trades of students that where active in the stock market before they participate in one of the CSE financial courses. We also observe trades and performance of students that began trading only after completing a course, that is, after interacting with some experienced classmates in their artificially-formed group. Overall, our novel data set combines the official class records and trading activity of 13,730 students from over 1,100 courses between 2008 to 2016. While we accurately observe the stock trades of experienced students, we do not know the specific information shared among classmates. To address this issue, we formalize the role of selective communication by introducing information-transmission-bias in a model of social learning. In the model, potential investors with different trading skills are uncertain about the expected payoffs from trading stocks. These individuals update their beliefs after observing public information in stock prices and the signal from experienced investors in their classroom. The theoretical model allows us to identify a set of testable predictions that are unique to the story of selective communication, relative to predictions from alternative or complementary explanations about investment choices under social interactions. For example, we compare our predictions to multiple settings: (i) when information is transmitted accurately across peers, (ii) when investors are overconfident (Kyle & Wang, 1997, Odean, 1998; Benos, 1998), and (iii) when investors have 5 Most courses were scheduled at night during weekdays or scheduled on Saturdays to accommodate for working professionals.

The two unique predictions from the model under selective communication are the following. First, only positive peer outcomes influence investment decisions. Second, peer outcomes promote market participation specially among uninformed individuals. In the model, unskilled investors have low precision in their private information. In turn, they put more weight on outside signals than other better-informed individuals – the marginal effect from the peer signal is higher if an individual is less informed a priori. Consequently, positive peer returns encourage more unskilled than skilled investors to trade stocks. Similarly, under perfect communication, uninformed individuals would be more likely to refrain from trading stocks after hearing about the bad experiences from peers. However, since negative information is not transmitted, both informed and uninformed individuals enter the market at a rate that is independent from peer returns. Overall, the model predicts that the proportion of skilled to unskilled entrants decreases when peer returns are positive, and this ratio is constant when peer returns are negative.6 In our empirical design, we exploit the fact that the representation of students with trading backgrounds, their trades, and past performance vary considerably across groups. We find that students assigned to groups with a high share of experienced classmates are more likely to start trading stocks after completing the course. A one standard deviation increase in the share of experience students in a group, evaluated at the mean of all other variables, increases the likelihood of market participation by three percentage points, an increase of more than 27%. Alternative mechanisms that do not involve social influence are ruled out. For example, time fixed effects control for market-wide news releases and other aggregate shocks that influence market participation. City fixed effects control for systematic regional differences and teacher fixed effects remove the influence from the class instructor. Overall, our baseline results suggest a strong presence of peer effects in our classroom setting. 6 These results hold even in cases where signal receivers internalize the bias in communication. 4",

    "text": "To evaluate the empirical predictions from our learning model we proceed as follows: we decompose peers’ performance into negative and positive regions to analyze whether unfavorable peer outcomes influence entry similarly to good outcomes. We find that negative returns do not affect market participation and that the relation between peer returns and entry comes solely from positive peer returns. The effect from positive outcomes is economically meaningful: A one standard deviation increase in peer returns, increases the probability of market entry among inexperienced classmates by 15%. Our second crucial finding is related to the performance of new investors. We find that among market entrants, those that share a classroom with successful peers underperform other investors in their first year of trading. In other words, individuals from groups where peers had positive past performance generate lower market-adjusted returns once they begin trading. Moreover, the performance of new investors declines as we compare courses with higher peer returns.7 On the contrary, we do not find any differences in first-year returns among students that entered the market after taking courses where peers had negative outcomes (or courses where classmates had no trading background). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that selective communication encourages more market entry among uninformed investors. These investors not only generate lower returns on average but are also less likely to continue trading after one year; as investors trade, they might realize that their inherent level of ability is low and decide to exit the stock market (Seru, et al., 2009). An alternative explanation for low returns among new investors might be related to mean reversion in stock prices.8 For example, if individuals systematically buy the best-performing stocks of their peers and large price increases are followed by reversals, new investors would display poor performance. To examine this possibility, we further disaggregate our empirical 7 A one standard deviation increase in peer returns is associated with lower market-adjusted returns among new entrants of approximately 160 basis points (bp) per year 8 Mean reversion refers to the tendency of asset prices to return to a trend path. Although the existence of mean reversion in stock prices is subject to much controversy, there is some evidence of mean reversion in stock prices in U.S. and international markets (Poterba & Summers, 1988; Chaudhuri & Wu, 2003; Fama & French, 1988).

    "text": "analysis at the investor-stock level. More precisely, we estimate the likelihood of buying a stock as a function of peer’s ownership and peer’s performance in that security. Interestingly, we do not find any herding at the stock level. While individuals appear to be driven to the stock market by the overall performance of successful classmates, they do not trade the same stocks as their peers. In our setting, groups are formed artificially, so relative wealth concerns and utility from joint consumption of an asset are likely smaller that in cases were peers are close and groups have formed endogenously (Bursztyn, et al., 2014). The documented underperformance of new investors in our study appears to be related to individuals’ innate ability, rather than from herding strategies that mechanically generate a drag on performance. Another potential explanation for our findings is that individuals accurately observe peer outcomes but decide to ignore negative signals. This form of information neglect is likely present if individuals overestimate their ability to replicate successful trades from peers, while avoiding peers’ mistakes. To directly test how social communication in our classrooms is related to peer performance, we asked former students if they had any discussions about trading strategies with classmates during the course.9 According to our survey, students engage in more investment conversations with peers during periods of high market volatility, when news about stocks are more salient. Importantly, we find that conversations about investments are more common in courses where peer outcomes are good – 93% of students report investment conversations when peer returns are positive, relative to 79% in courses with negative peer returns and 72% in courses without experienced classmates. In other words, while some negative information might be transmitted, the exchange of investment ideas seems stronger when some students have experienced positive outcomes. Our work is closely related to Han etl al. (2018). The authors are the first to model communication bias among individual investors to explain why active strategies (e.g., those with more personal involvement and with more variance) dominate passive invesments.

We show that social learning can sometimes lead to unfavorable outcomes, especially when peer choices are not perfectly observed by members of the social network. Our analysis contributes to the empirical literature that studies the effects from social interactions on investment (e.g., Hong, et al., 2004; Hong, et al., 2005; Ivkovich & Weisbenner, 2007; Brown, et al., 2008; Li, 2015). Most of this literature focuses on identifying peer effects – whether information or behaviors are transmitted, and on the strength of social contagion. We add to the literature by examining one important aspect of peer effects, i.e., the transmission of investment ideas and its impact on behavior when communication is biased. Closely related to our results, Kaustia & Knupfer (2012) find that only positive returns from neighbors, defined as investors living the same zip code, encourage stock market participation. In our study, social interactions are well-defined by classmates and the time and location of each course. This allows us to design a rich set of empirical tests to evaluate the role of selective communication versus other interpretations. The courses, which on average are composed by 13 students without trading experienced and two with trading background, are small enough so that the influence of peer outcomes is likely strong and not diluted as in large settings. Our findings suggest that in social groups, in order to understand peer effects, it is important to identify the biases that affect the process of information transmission. In our setting, uninformed investors appear to be drawn to active trading by the winning accounts from peers, but they later obtain low returns once they start trading. Finally, our findings are related to the literature on the determinants of individual trading performance. Excessive investor trading is commonly linked to poor returns and it is often 10 Other papers have used classroom settings to identify peer effects.

Moreover, active trading could be exacerbated by social interactions as favorable ideas about stock trades are easily disseminated across people (e.g., Barber, et al., 2003; Hong et al., 2004). However, because of self-selection, it is difficult to identify whether peer effects are the key driver in the transmission of active trading strategies. If individuals choose where to work or the type of peers, it is difficult to separate selection from peer effects. Our work contributes to this literature by empirically estimating how trading ideas are transmitted across people. While individuals self-select into CSE courses because of their interest in stock trading, they differ in the exposure to classmates with different trading backgrounds. More broadly, our findings have important policy implications. The goal of the education program was to provide information to improve financial decisions. Contrary to this objective, selective communication among peers disseminates inaccurate signals, promoting misguided ideas about personal investing. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: in Section 2, we introduce our model of stock market participation with social learning; in Section 3, we describe the financial education program and data; we present our empirical methodology in Section 4 and main results in Section 5; we explore different channels of peer effects in Section 6; Section 7 concludes. 2. HYPOTHESES In this section we discuss hypotheses derived from interactions among individuals that could explain the stock market entry decision as well as the investment performance of new investors. In the model, potential investors with different trading skills are uncertain about the expected payoffs from trading stocks, and they update their beliefs about that value by observing public information in stock prices and the signal from the performance of classmates with trading experience. We first derive hypotheses assuming that information is perfectly shared between experienced and inexperienced students.

Finally, we discuss testable implications when overconfidence, a psychological attribute that is commonly linked to investor overtrading and underperformance, is introduced into the benchmark model of market entry. Other explanations based on mean reversion in stock prices, herding due to relative wealth concerns, and selective information neglect are discussed (and tested) in section 5. 2.1. A MODEL OF STOCK MARKET PARTICIPATION There are N potential new investors, 𝑖 (cid:3404) 1,…,𝑁. These are students that participate in different training courses but have no previous trading background. The value of entering the stock market is uncertain, 𝑣(cid:3556), and is distributed normally with mean 𝑣̅ and variance 𝜎(cid:2870). We use 𝜏 to (cid:3049) (cid:3049) denote 1/𝜎(cid:2870). New investors must pay a fixed cost of entry 𝑐, so the net payoff from entry is 𝑣̅ (cid:3398)𝑐. (cid:3049) Each potential investor is endowed with two signals about 𝑣(cid:3556) at the beginning of their training. The first is a public signal, e.g., stock market prices, and is denoted by 𝑠̃ (cid:3404) 𝑣(cid:3556) (cid:3397)𝜎 𝜀̃ , (cid:3043) (cid:3043) (cid:3043) where 𝜀̃ is independently and normally distributed with mean zero, unit variance, and 𝜏 (cid:3404) 1/𝜎(cid:2870).

When experienced classmates reveal their trading outcomes, these could be valuable information that allows potential new entrants to update their beliefs about the value of stock market participation. We model such signal as 𝑠̃ (cid:3404) 𝑣(cid:3556) (cid:3397)𝜎 𝜀̃ , where 𝜀̃ is independently and normally distributed across (cid:3032) (cid:3032) (cid:3032) (cid:3032) experienced students with mean zero and unit variance.

When deciding whether or not to start trading actively, relative to skilled individuals, unskilled individuals put more weight on the information that is shared by peers. If a student with trading experience shares positive outcomes with classmates, students with less precision in their prior are more sensitive to this information. Although skilled individuals also increase their participation after hearing good peer outcomes, there are relatively more unskilled individuals entering in this case. If an experienced student shares that her trading payoffs have been negative, unskilled individuals also react more strongly to this information. That is, they reduce their likelihood of entering the market, more so than skilled individuals, who put less weight on the peer signal. In turn, when communication among classmates is accurate, when peers have negative trading experiences, the stock market is proportionally populated with more skilled investors. More broadly, peer outcomes generate a composition effect among entrants, encouraging or preventing more unskilled individuals depending on the sign of the signal. In the data, we do not measure ex-ante skill. For example, we do not have a test of financial knowledge or mathematical ability at the beginning of the course. Instead, we measure trading profits among those who decide to trade actively after completing the course. Since our benchmark model predicts that the proportion of skilled entrants decreases with the peer signal, in terms of performance, we expect for lower average returns among investors that share a classroom with peers of good outcomes. This leads to our second hypothesis: HYPOTHESIS 2: Under accurate communication, the average trading performance of new investors is decreasing in the peer signal 𝑠̃ (cid:3032) 2.2.

    "text": "be biased toward positive investment outcomes if individuals benefit from appearing to be successful. The tendency of people to report positively about themselves has been studied in the psychology and sociology literature and is explained by the need to satisfy presentational norms (Schlenker, 1980). There is also evidence that people tend to attribute successes to their own virtues, and failures to external circumstances or luck (Bem, 1972; Langer & Roth, 1975). Such psychological processes encourage people to think more about their successes than their failures, and thus, positive experiences are more likely to be transmitted across individuals. We model selective communication by assuming that the revealed peer signal is a non- linear function of the true peer outcome, 𝑠̃(cid:3045) (cid:3404) max(cid:4666) 0,𝑠̃ (cid:4667). We assume that signal receivers do not (cid:3032) (cid:3032) internalize the bias in communication similar to Han et al. (2018), but we also relax this assumption by solving for a model where potential investors understand that only positive peer outcomes are shared (see Appendix A). The testable implications of both models are similar, so we focus here on the case with naïve signal receivers.12 Using a signal that is biased toward positive outcomes implies an asymmetric relation between peer outcomes and market participation: HYPOTHESIS 3: Under selective communication market participation is constant for negative peer outcomes (𝜕Pr/ 𝜕𝑠̃ =0 if 𝑠̃ (cid:3407) 0) and increases on positive peer outcome (𝜕Pr/ 𝜕𝑠̃ >0 if 𝑠̃ (cid:3408) (cid:3043) (cid:3032) (cid:3043) (cid:3032) 0) The second implication of the model with selective communication is related to the ratio of skilled to unskilled entrants, Π. Since potential investors always observe a signal equal to zero (𝑠̃(cid:3045)) for negative realizations of trading returns among experienced classmates, the proportion of (cid:3032) skilled to unskilled entrants remains constant independent from the true peer outcome, 𝑠̃ . (cid:3032) Conversely, when peer returns are positive, this information gets discussed among classmates, and since unskilled individuals are more sensitive to outside signals, their marginal rate of entry is 12 In the case where signals receivers internalize the fact that negative information is not shared, when 𝑠̃(cid:3045) (cid:3404) (cid:3032) 0, individuals do cannot distinguish between not having experienced peers in the classroom and having peers with negative trading outcomes that avoid discussing loses. Bayes’ law in this case implies that a zero-peer signal has some negative information on the value of trading. In such case, all investors end up reducing their probability of entry relative to the case with naïve investors. 13",

    "text": "higher. In turn, selective communication disproportionally promotes the participation of unskilled individuals in the stock market. As shown in Figure 1, the ratio of skilled to unskilled entrants is decreasing in the true peer signal 𝑠̃ when outcomes are shared accurately. On the contrary, when (cid:3032) communication among peers is biased, the ratio of skilled to unskilled individuals is constant for negative peer outcomes, 𝑠̃ , and decreases when peer performance is positive. In terms of average (cid:3032) performance among amateur investors we can express the hypothesis as follows: HYPOTHESIS 4: Under selective communication, the average trading performance of new investors is constant for 𝑠̃ (cid:3407) 0. The average trading performance of new investors decreases (cid:3032) in the peer signal strength for 𝑠̃ (cid:3408) 0 (cid:3032) In our model, each of the N potential investors could enter the stock market after observing all the signals. Under selective communication, negative outcomes are not transmitted, so the magnitude from negative returns have no marginal effects, which under perfect communication would have discouraged entry among unskilled individuals in the first place. 2.3. OVERCONFIDENCE A psychological attribute among investors that is often linked to excessive stock trading and negative performance is overconfidence13 – the tendency to place irrationally excessive degree of confidence in one’s abilities and beliefs. There are two common ways to model investor overconfidence: (i) an irrational shift in the perceived mean, and (ii) an irrational shift in the perceived variance, when the confidence interval around the investor’s private signal is tighter than it is in reality. We introduce overconfident individuals in our model as follows. We assume that unskilled individuals wrongly assume that the mean of the private signal is centered around 13Kyle & Wang (1997) use overconfidence as a commitment device for trading intensity. Odean (1998) and Benos (1998) develop a model in which overconfidence leads to trading. Empirical evidence on the relation between overconfidence and trading frequency include Glaser & Weber (2007) and Deaves, et al. (2008). Experimental work also relates overconfidence to underperformance (Biais, et al., 2005) 14",

In other words, unskilled investors either (cid:3036) overestimate the true value of active trading or the precision of their private information.14 Overconfident individuals put less weight on the peer signal, following more their prior biased prior. In other words, while overconfidence in this setting reduces the marginal effect of the peer signal, individuals still increase their participation rate monotonically on peer outcomes, 𝑠̃ . In this case, an irrational shift in the mean would populate the market with a larger number of (cid:3032) unskilled individuals, with the ratio of skilled to unskilled entrants still decreasing on the peer signal (dashed-dotted line in Figure 1). Similarly, a miss-calibration of the signal precision would make unskilled individuals less responsive to peer outcomes, but the overall effect of the peer signal is still symmetric around good and bad past peer outcomes (dotted line in Figure 1). To summarize, while overconfidence dampens the effects from the peer signal, it effects on the entry choice are indistinguishable from Hypothesis 1 and 2 in the benchmark model. 3. DATA AND INSTITUTIONAL SETTING This section describes the data and the construction of key variables. We begin by discussing the Stock Exchange education program. 2.1 THE CSE FINANCIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM In 2008, the Colombian Stock Exchange (CSE) launched a nation-wide financial education program. The initiative would promote financial literacy and stock market participation of individual investors. Among the strategies, was the promotion of “Puntos de Bolsa” or CSE Spots. Located at universities, chambers of commerce, and business centers throughout the country, these information centers where open to the public to provide information and training. In particular, the CSE introduced multiple specialized courses from basic topics such as Introductory Excel for 14We introduce overconfidence only among unskilled investors as an extreme case to try to generate asymmetries between the proportion of skilled to unskilled individuals as a function of the peer signal. As it turns out, the “better-than-average effect,” or an irrational shift in the mean only changes the total proportion of skilled to unskilled entrants, even if the cognitive bias was present among both types of investors. In turn, the asymmetric effects from the peer signal are exclusive to the model of communication bias. 15",

    "text": "Finance, to more complex curricula which included fixed income and derivative trading. From the 1,136 courses taught between 2008 and 2016, 875 were on stock trading. Since our interest is examining the determinants of stock market participation and the transmission of trading strategies, and given their popularity, we focus exclusively on these. During the first few years of the program, the courses lasted two weeks for a total of 10 hours. The CSE strategy was to offer short courses, with students having to complete each level before being allowed to register for the next course. The progression would go from “Stock Trading Level 0,” to “Level 1,” and finally to “Level 2”, with instruction that ranged from the basics of stock trading, to fundamental and technical analysis. A student would have to matriculate separately for each course, and depending on her interest, continue or not with the following level. Starting in 2013, the CSE opted for a new strategy whereby courses were of longer duration, with a more developed curriculum and modules for different topics. In this new system, a student matriculated to a single course of about 24 total hours that covered the entire program of stock trading. Importantly, since the inception of the education initiative, and independently of the course duration, registered students would meet in the same classroom with the same instructor for the entire course. That is, the social interactions in our setting are well-defined by classmates and by the time of the course. 3.2. DATA Our analysis draws on three primary sets of data. First, we obtain data from the CSE on courses and participants. Each record includes detailed information on the beginning and ending date of the course, matriculated students, cost of tuition, total number of hours, location, and name and curriculum vitae of the instructor. Table 1-Panel A shows summary statistics on these courses for each year in the sample. In accordance with the CSE directives, between 2008 and 2012 courses were shorter and less expensive (averaging 10.8 hours and 110 USD) than in the last four years of the sample (averaging 22 hours and 276 USD). Classes had 16 students on average, with few classes with over 30 students, and some with as low as 10 students. One of the limitations of the data, is that the Stock Exchange did not collect demographic or socioeconomic information on 16",

We also determine the age range of each student at the time of each course using the national identification number. On average, female students represent 31% of the sample and 55% of all students were over 30 years old at the time of the course. Second, we use the CSE’s official record of equity trades for all investors in Colombia between 2006 and 2017. The CSE records every single transaction on listed equities, and the data disclose the date and time of each transaction, a stock identifier, order type (buy or sell), transaction price, number of shares, broker, and investor type (i.e., individuals or institutions). During our sample period, trades by individual investors accounted for over 7 million transactions. Importantly for our analysis, the data include the national identification number for each individual, which can be used to merge the information with the financial education initiative. Overall, 36% of the students in the CSE’s education program had at least one stock trade throughout our sample period, either before or after taking the course. These 3,960 students with some trading history are more active in the stock market than the average Colombian individual investor. For example, while the average investor in Colombia owns 2.2 different stocks, makes 1.3 stock transactions per year, and averages 7,200 USD per trade, the students of the CSE education program that trade actively, hold 6.2 stocks, make 6.6 trades per year, and average 8,781 USD of volume per trade. Third, we collect additional information about students via an electronic survey. The survey had three parts: (i) Socioeconomic information, i.e., age, education, academic background, and earnings. (ii) Experience in financial assets. For instance, whether the individual had any foreign investments or in mutual funds, which are not captured in the CSE trading tape. (iii) Self- reported social interaction. That is, whether they took the course with a friend or a relative and whether they talked to their classmates about investment strategies during the course. The survey was sent electronically on March 2018 to 4,600 students with emails reported in the CSE data set.15 15 A pilot of the survey was tested with an ongoing class in February 2018.

The response rate was 19% (842 students). According to the survey, 44% of the respondents had graduate education, 17% had some type of foreign portfolio investment, and many (80%) reported to have discussed investment strategies with classmates. 3.3. TRADING EXPERIENCE The key variables of interest are the share of students in a class c who have stock trading experience (𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 ) and their trading performance (𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑟 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 ). To be precise, (cid:3030) (cid:3030) we define experienced students as those with at least one stock purchase in a 12-month window prior to the beginning of the course. The average share of experienced students in a class is around 14.8%, with significant variation across courses (Table 1-Panel B). For instance, the 10th-90th percentile range is between 0% and 30.7%. To distinguish time-series from cross-sectional variation we graph the full distribution of experienced classmates, both the share and adjusted for year effects, i.e., the share divided by the average share in that year (Figure 1). While some courses have no students with prior trading background, others have up to 60% of the registered students and, year-adjusted, a rate nearly seven times the rate of other courses in that year. Returns were computed monthly using closing prices for each stock, considering all known open positions and transactions. For each experienced student, we compute total portfolio returns 6 and 12 months before the course. We then calculate 𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑟 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 as the average returns among (cid:3030) students with trading background registered in the same class. According to Table 1-Panel B, while Peer Returns are on average positive throughout the sample (5.26%), there is significant variation across courses – with the 10th-90th percentile ranging from -13% to 30%. We define new investors as students without trading experience who made at least one stock purchase in the year following the course.16 We have a total of 1,350 market entrants in our 16 We also use three- and six-month windows after the end of the course and the main results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar. 18",

These amateur investors made on average 10 stock transactions in their first-year of trading, and although they displayed positive returns on average, 3.1% per year, their market- adjusted returns were negative, -2.2%. 3.4. RANDOM ASSIGNMENT As we are studying the peer effects on market entry it is important to elucidate on the obvious self-selection that may affect our results. Students of CSE courses are interested somehow in stocks and consequently end up taking a class, but among them, some unexperienced students are exposed to peers with trading background and differences in performance. Since courses were formed based on availability and not on trading experience or past returns, the setting resembles a random assignment. However, it is possible that as the courses were formed, a group of individuals with distinctive characteristics might end up matriculating at the same time. For example, if the decision of individuals with trading background to register for a course coincides with the choice of high-income men to sign up for these classes (characteristics known to correlate with market participation), market entry might be driven by the attributes of individuals rather than from their interaction with peers inside the classroom. To deal with this concern, we test whether students without trading background in courses with more (above median) and with fewer (below median) pre-course trading experience display significant differences in any of their characteristics. We also run the same stratification test splitting the sample in courses where experienced students have above and below median returns. The raw results of all 6 characteristic variables in our data set are presented in Table 2. Only gender is significant, although the difference is small in magnitude – courses with below median experienced classmates have 3.3% more women than men. Other characteristics, such as age, students’ earnings, and education are similar for the two groups. Also, both groups have instructors with similar teaching experience and trading returns. Another potential concern with our class setting is that friends or acquaintances might register together for a CSE course. If an inexperienced student matriculates in a course with a 19",

According to our electronic survey, while 22% percent of students reported to have registered for a stock trading class with a friend, among experienced students, only 5% stated to have taken the course with an acquaintance. In other words, most experienced students did not know their classmates before the start of the training. 4. EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY To analyze peer effects and the role of selective communication in stock market participation, we estimate several variations of the following baseline empirical model: 𝑦 (cid:3404) 𝛼 (cid:3397)𝛽 ∗𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 (cid:3397)𝛾∗𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑟 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 (3) (cid:3036)(cid:3030)(cid:3047) (cid:3030) (cid:3030) (cid:3397)𝑸′Ω (cid:3397)𝑴′Ψ (cid:3397)𝒁′Γ (cid:3397)𝜇 (cid:3397)𝛿 (cid:3397)𝛾 (cid:3397) 𝜀 (cid:3047) (cid:3030) (cid:3036) (cid:3047) (cid:3043) (cid:3039) (cid:3036),(cid:3030) The subscript i refers to an individual, c indexes each course, l indexes the location (city), t is the starting date of the course, and p indexes courses with the same syllabus. In our first set of empirical exercises, the dependent variable 𝑦 is a binary variable that represents market entry. (cid:3036)(cid:3030)(cid:3047) The variable is equal to one if a student without trading background made her first stock purchase within 12 months of taking a course and is zero otherwise. Common time-varying shocks might affect market entry and at the same time be correlated with peers’ communication, thus biasing our estimates. For example, market volatility is likely associated with increased visibility of stocks in the media. Salient information about the stock market might promote market entry while encouraging individuals to exchange ideas about potential investments. To control for this possibility, we include Ω , a set of market characteristics (cid:3047) at the start date of each course, namely, stock market returns and volatility.17 Furthermore, we 17 Both are measured at 3, 6, and 12-month windows prior to the beginning of a course.

(cid:3047) We include course-level controls, Ψ , such as the value of tuition and total hours of (cid:3030) instruction. Students that register for courses with more advanced curriculum are likely more sophisticated or might be more incline to trade stocks in the first place. In turn, we include program fixed effects, 𝛿 , i.e., courses with identical syllabus. Another important set of controls, 𝑊, (cid:3043) (cid:3036) captures student-specific characteristics. These include gender, age range, and whether the student took any previous trading courses; a proxy for the student’s interest in the stock market. Finally, common time-invariant unobservables might also generate a positive relation between experienced peers and participation. For example, if residents in a city are financially more sophisticated, stock market participation might be more common. We eliminate this type of influence from our analysis by including city fixed effects, 𝛾 . (cid:3039) In summary, our empirical strategy compares the entry decision of students that took the same type of course, in the same city, under similar market conditions, but who differ in the exposure to experienced peers. To be precise, we ask, after controlling for all these factors, whether the market participation decision is affected by the presence of experienced peers in the classroom (𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 ) and by the past performance of those with trading background (cid:3030) (𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑟 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 ). Furthermore, to test if peer outcomes have a stronger influence on investment (cid:3030) decisions when these outcomes have been positive (Hypothesis 1 versus Hypothesis 3), we estimate a piecewise linear model in which we break down 𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑟 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 into two variables that (cid:3030) separately capture the slope estimates for positive and negative peer performance. Next, we modify our baseline empirical specification to evaluate the performance of new investors. We use the returns of each new investor in the first 12 months of trading as dependent variable in equation (3). This specification allows us to explore whether the performance of new investors is driven by interactions with a particular subgroup of experienced classmates, i.e., peers with good or bad outcomes (Hypothesis 2 versus Hypothesis 4).

DETERMINANTS OF STOCK MARKET PARTICIPATION We begin the analysis of peer effects by plotting the average participation rate per classroom –number (Figure 2A) and share (Figure 2B) of unexperienced students – sorted by the share of students with trading background (top and bottom quartile). In the nine years of our sample, there are consistently more students entering the stock market from courses with a larger share of experienced classmates, both in absolute and relative terms. That is, the participation rate is 20% (around 3 students per classroom) in courses with more experienced classmates, and 10% for courses where peers have less trading background.18 We present the results of our baseline specification (equation (3)) in Table 3. Since the dependent variable is binary, we estimate the model using a logistic regression. We adjust standard errors for heteroskedasticity and course-level clusters. Since classmates are exposed to the same experienced peers, their decision to enter the stock market might be correlated. According to the table, the coefficients of Experience Rate and Peer Returns are always positive. These effects are not only statistically significant, but also economically meaningful. For example, using our lowest estimates in the fourth column, we find that a one standard deviation increase in the share of experience students in a course, evaluated at the mean of all other variables, translates into an increase of 27% in the predicted stock market participation rate. That is, the share 18 If course sizes were constant, a higher number of experienced students would reduce the non-experienced students in the class, and the participation rate might mechanically be positively correlated with the share of experienced students. To deal with this concern and given the significant variation in course sizes, Table A.1 in the appendix examines the participation rate in courses with different shares of experienced students, conditioning on the number of unexperienced students in the class. In particular, when we compare courses with similar numbers of unexperienced students, the participation rate is significantly larger (up to eight times in some cases) if the course has more experienced students. 22",

The set of controls in Table 4 have the expected signs. For example, market entry is lower for women and is higher for students that take multiple courses.19 Also, market volatility and market returns are positively related to market entry, although these effects are largely absorbed by time fixed effects, since students that registered for courses that started during the same quarter experienced similar market conditions.20 The crucial finding is that even when we control for course and individual characteristics, peer effects seem to have a strong impact on the market participation decision among students of the CSE education program. 5.2. POSITIVE VERSUS NEGATIVE PEER OUTCOMES According to our learning model in Section 2, public information should encourage market participation when signals are good (e.g., positive market returns) and deter market entry for bad signals (e.g., negative market returns). Conversely, under selective communication, peer signals only affect market entry when students with trading background have experienced favorable outcomes. To test these ideas, we estimate a variant of equation (3) where we break down each, 𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑟 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 and 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 , into two variables that separately capture the slope (cid:3030) (cid:3047) estimates for positive and negative outcomes. Following Kaustia and Knupfer (2012), we use 𝑀𝑎𝑥(cid:4666)0,𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑟 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 (cid:4667) and 𝑀𝑎𝑥(cid:4666)0,𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 (cid:4667) to estimate the effect of positive (cid:3030) (cid:3047) outcomes and 𝑀𝑖𝑛(cid:4666)0,𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑟 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 (cid:4667) and 𝑀𝑖𝑛(cid:4666)0,𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 (cid:4667) for negative outcomes. (cid:3030) (cid:3047) We present our findings in Table 4. We find that negative peer returns do not affect entry – the coefficient of 𝑀𝑖𝑛(cid:4666)0,𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑟 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 (cid:4667) is indistinguishable from zero in all specifications. In (cid:3030) fact, the relation between peer outcomes and market participation comes solely from positive peer returns. In columns (1), (3), and (4), the coefficient of 𝑀𝑎𝑥(cid:4666)0,𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑟 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 (cid:4667) is always positive (cid:3030) 19 The lower stock market participation among women has been widely documented in the literature and is often related to risk aversion and lower financial literacy (Haliassos & Bertaut, 1995; Rooij, et al., 2011; Almenberg & Dreber, 2015). 20 The effect from market conditions is not fully absorbed when time fixed effects are included given differences in the starting date of the course within each quarter. 23",

The marginal effect from positive peer outcomes can be read as follows: an increase of one standard deviation in the average return of experienced students in a group, increases the likelihood of market entry between 15% to 22%. The evidence that peer effects are stronger only when outcomes are positive is consistent with hypothesis 3. 5.3. PERFORMANCE OF NEW INVESTORS So far, we document peer effects in the market participation decision, and a strong bias for classmates’ positive outcomes to stimulate active trading. We now examine the performance among rookie investors. In particular, we use the sample of students that entered the stock market after the completion of a course and calculate their returns during the first 12-months of trading. By focusing on first year returns, we expect to capture students’ inherent ability to identify profitable trading opportunities and avoid skill biases that are developed with trading experience (Mahani & Bernhardt, 2007) The model of accurate communication predicts a negative relation between peer outcomes and the share of skilled entrants. When low-skilled (or less-informed) individuals are trading actively, we should expect lower trading profits from this group – Peer Returns and investors’ performance should have a negative relation (Hypothesis 2). Conversely, under selective communication, only positive peer outcomes affect the composition of skilled to unskilled entrants. In practice, the negative relation between Peer Returns and investors’ first year performance should be only observable when peer outcomes are positive (Hypothesis 4). To study whether there are any systematic differences in performance among amateur investors, we first sort courses by quintiles of Peer Returns and calculate the average returns of new investors in each group. According to Figure 3, students that participate in courses with high Peer Returns display the lowest performance during their first-year of trading (Panel A). Interestingly, it seems that the relation between Peer Returns and amateurs’ performance is non- monotonic. For instance, while the returns of new investors are similar in the bottom two quintiles, 24",

    "text": "these returns decrease in the top two quintiles of Peer Returns. Panel B in Figure 3 confirm this trend when returns are calculated during the first 6 months of active trading. It is possible that the performance of new investors is driven by market conditions at the time of entry, or by individual characteristics, such as age or gender. To control for factors that affect investor performance, we estimate equation (3) via Ordinary Least Squares using the market-adjusted performance of new investors as dependent variable. Table 5 presents our findings. As documented above, there appears to be a negative relation between Peer Returns and first-year performance (columns 1 and 3), although this relation comes exclusively from the positive region of peer outcomes (columns 2 and 4). We do not find differences in first-year returns among new investors if they registered in courses where peers had negative outcomes. On the contrary, individuals that attend courses where peer outcomes are positive, obtain lower returns once they start trading. In fact, the performance of new investors is lower as Peer Returns are higher: a one standard deviation increase in Peer Returns – an increase of approximately 10 percentage points – is associated with 1.58% lower first-year market-adjusted returns among new investors. The documented relation between peer outcomes and investors’ performance is consistent with Hypothesis 4. Negative trading performance is often linked to market exit (Seru, et al., 2009). If individuals learn about their ability through trading experience, they might stop trading after experiencing losses. In our setting, investors with negative returns in the first year are 32% more likely to stop trading after 12 months than investors who experienced positive returns. This suggest that while positive peer outcomes encourage market participation, to the extent that investors experience negative outcomes, many exit the market after one year. To summarize, students exposed to classmates with pre-course trading experience, and in particular to peers with positive outcomes, are more likely to trade stocks, but these individuals generate lower returns once they start trading. In our model of social learning, the underperformance of new investors is explained by the innate ability of new investors since biased signals encourage participation among less-informed individuals.

    "text": "performance among investors is related to herding strategies in stock selection rather than to investor skill. In the next section, we examine alternative explanations for our findings. 6. ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS This section presents analysis that addresses various alternative explanations and discusses results from further robustness checks. 6.1. TRADING STRATEGIES ON INDIVIDUAL STOCKS Informal conversations with experienced classmates might encourage individuals to hold similar portfolios as their peers. In fact, there is extensive evidence that individuals and even professional asset managers living in the same region hold similar portfolios (Ivkovic & Weisbenner, 2005; Hong, et al., 2005). In addition to the information that is conveyed when peers hold a particular stock (social learning channel), the possession of an asset might affect investors’ utility via relative wealth concerns (“keeping up with Joneses” as in Abel, 1990) or through utility gains from joint consumption (Bursztyn, et al., 2014). A simple explanation for the underperformance of rookie investors might be related to a combination of herding in individual stocks and mean reversion in stock prices. If investors systematically buy the best-performing stocks of their peers, and large stock returns are followed by reversals, new investors would mechanically display poor performance. To evaluate this possibility, we use the sample of market entrants and estimate the likelihood of buying a stock as a function of peers’ ownership and peers’ performance. We modify our baseline empirical model (equation 3) by disaggregating the analysis at the investor-stock level as follows: 𝑦 (cid:3404) 𝛼 (cid:3397)𝛽 ∗𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 (cid:3397)𝛾∗𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑟 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑠 (4) (cid:3036)(cid:3030)(cid:3047)(cid:3046) (cid:3030)(cid:3046) (cid:3030)(cid:3046) (cid:3397)𝑸(cid:4593)Ω (cid:3397)𝑴(cid:4593)Ψ (cid:3397)𝒁(cid:4593)Γ (cid:3397)𝜇 (cid:3397)𝛿 (cid:3397)𝛾 (cid:3397)𝜌 (cid:3397) 𝜀 .

We control for time-varying stock characteristics (Ω ) by including stock returns (cid:3047)(cid:3046) and variance in addition to our previous controls for market conditions (i.e., market returns and market variance). Furthermore, to account for stock-invariant characteristics that may be affecting the likelihood of actively trading a single firm, we include stock-fixed effects in the analysis, 𝜌 . (cid:3046) Finally, in addition to students’ characteristics captured in Γ (e.g., age and gender), we include (cid:3036)(cid:3046) whether the individual had an open position in stock s at the beginning of the course. While many students are classified as ‘inexperienced’ in our sample – they do not have stock purchases in a12- month window before the beginning of the course –, they might have an open but inactive brokerage account with some holdings in stock s. In fact, among new investors in our sample, 72% had an open position in at least one stock prior to the beginning of the course. Table 6 presents the results. Interestingly, we do not find any evidence that new investors trade similar stocks as experienced classmates. The coefficient of 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑒 is (cid:3030)(cid:3046) indistinguishable from zero in all specifications. Moreover, there is no evidence that new investors systematically buy stocks with the highest performance in the peers’ portfolio. Meanwhile, our evidence suggests that individuals are more likely to trade actively in stocks that they already own. Investors might rationally choose to obtain information about stocks that are familiar to them (Van Nieuwerburgh & Veldkamp, 2010). While successful stories from classmates might encourage active trading, investors seem to focus their attention on stocks in which they have some ex-ante information. In our setting, groups are formed artificially, and consequently, channels that induce herding in individual securities such as utility from joint consumption or relative wealth concerns, might be weaker than when groups are formed endogenously. Overall, our evidence suggests that the underperformance of new investors is not related to herding strategies in stock selection. Importantly, there is no support for the view that individuals systematically buy the best performing stocks in the peers’ portfolio and thus are mechanically exposed to potential mean reversion in stock prices. 27",

    "text": "Another potential explanation for our results is that individuals accurately share their performance, but signal receivers ignore negative outcomes. Specifically, if inexperience students believe that they can replicate peers’ successful trades and avoid peers loses, only positive outcomes would impact market entry. In psychology, there is extensive evidence of self-enhancing thought process, such as the tendency of people to attribute wins to their own virtues, and loses to external circumstances (Bem, 1972; Langer & Roth, 1975). Similarly, people might disregard negative peer outcomes, assuming that these result from lack of skill or from other unique circumstances that do not apply to them. At the same time, people might be encouraged to trade actively if they overestimate their ability to reproduce good peer outcomes. To shed more light on this issue, we ask former students if they had any informal discussions about stock trading with classmates. Among the respondents of our electronic survey, 750 students had no trading background prior to the course start date. Within this group, 80% of people reported to have engaged in investment conversations with others in the class. We further classify our respondents in three groups based on their classmates’ experience: (i) those who attended courses with no experienced classmates (330 students), (ii) those in courses where peer returns were positive (252 students), and (iii) those registered in courses with negative peer returns (178 students). Among students in courses where the Experience Rate was zero, 72% indicated to have investment conversations with peers. This number was significantly higher at 93% among students in courses where peer returns were positive. Even in courses where Peer Returns are negative, students report more investment conversations – 79% of individuals in this group – than in cases when there are no experienced classmates. In other words, the presence of peers with trading background in a classroom seems to be positively correlated with the exchange of investment ideas. Importantly for our analysis, social communication seems stronger when peer outcomes are positive. We test this finding in a control regression framework. In particular, we estimate equation (3) using a binary dependent variable that is equal to 1 when a student self-reports having 28",

    "text": "investment conversations with classmates and is zero otherwise. We present the results in Table 7. We find that older individuals are less likely to report investment conversations with classmates. Also, students talk more about trading strategies with peers when the stock market is more volatile. In column (1), the coefficient of Experience Rate is positive and statistically significant, while the coefficient of Peer Returns is indistinguishable from zero. In columns (2) and (4) we examine the relationship between peer outcomes and social communication. We find that both positive and negative peer returns are associated with increased social interactions. However, the results seem to confirm the idea that positive peer outcomes have a stronger correlation with self- reports of investment conversations than negative outcomes. For example, students are 6.3% more likely to report having conversations about stock trading with peers, when the performance of students with trading background in their class is positive and increases by one standard deviation (10 percentage points). In courses where Peer Returns are negative, a similar decline in returns is associated with 2.6% more reports of investment conversations; an increase that is less than half relative to the one from positive peer returns. While our evidence does not rule out negative information neglect, it suggests that information transmission in social settings is stronger when individuals have experience good outcomes. If some information about negative returns is shared through the social network, the extent to which such information is discounted by signal receivers remains an open question. 6.3. TEACHER EFFECTS Informal communication might be present among students and also between teachers and students. If teachers share their own trading history with students, these might impact stock market participation. We test for teacher effects in two ways. First, we check whether our results of market entry hold once we control for teacher fixed effects in our baseline empirical model (equation 3). Second, we augment the empirical specification by including the instructor’s teaching experience (number of hours teaching previous courses) as well as the instructors’ most recent trading experience prior 29",

    "text": "to the beginning of a course.21 Columns (1)-(3) in Table 8 present our findings. The documented peer effects are robust to the inclusion of variables that control for the teachers’ influence. We found no evidence that the instructor’s teaching or trading experience had any influence on stock market entry. For example, we do not find evidence consistent with the idea that teachers with good trading returns promote more active trading. The absence of teacher effects could be explained as follows. Teachers might avoid discussing personal investment stories with students while focusing exclusively on the course material. Alternatively, students might disregard information about teachers’ outcomes. For example, since teachers are experts in the subject matter, their successful trades might be heavily discounted by amateur investors. An individual might believe that replicating her teacher’s winning strategy is too difficult because she does not have the same background or training. Notwithstanding the explanation for the lack of teacher effects, our key finding is that peer effects are robust to the inclusion of variables that control for the teachers’ influence. 6.4. TESTING FOR MARKET INTEREST Positive peer outcomes seem to encourage active trading. In Subsection 6.1, we found no evidence that, conditional on the entry decision, peer outcomes influence individual stock purchases. It is possible that communication about successful stock trades raises the general interest in the stock market, prompting some students to take additional training. To test this idea, we use the sample of trading courses that have a subsequent level, e.g., Stock trading level 0 and 1. In total, there are 368 of such courses; most of them offered before 2013. We repeat our strategy from equation (3), but instead of estimating the likelihood of entering the market, we estimate the probability than an inexperienced student matriculates for the following course. Our results indicate that skewed outcomes from peers, particularly, large positive returns, increase the likelihood of continuing with the training series (columns 4 and 5 ins Table 8). Overall, 21 During the nine years of our sample, 113 different instructors taught the stock trading courses. Among them, 33 made stock transactions on their individual brokerage accounts (we cannot observe the stock transactions of instructors who are trading for an institutional portfolio), accounting for over 58% of all stock trading courses. 30",

EXTERNAL VALIDITY A final important concern with our analysis regards the external validity of the findings. There are several important qualifications to the generality of the impact from selective communication on financial decision making. First, the type of social learning on which we focus differs from classic models, such as Banerjee (1992) and Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch (1992), in that peer choices and outcomes are revealed imperfectly. Although many individual choices are accurately observed by members of a social group (e.g., peer effects have been documented in: automobile purchases, Grinblatt, et al., 2008; choice of workplace, Bayer, et al., 2008; health plan, Sorensen, 2006), several other choices are only transmitted via informal channels and could suffer from self-enhancement and selectivity. In social media, people take time when posting information about themselves, carefully choosing the aspects they would like to emphasize. This might lead others member of the group to similar choices, for example, where to travel, what product to buy, and whether or not to undertake a business venture. Under selective communication, signal receivers base their decisions on biased information, limiting their ability to correctly measure risks and expected payoffs. Our evidence suggests that low-skilled or less- sophisticated people are more susceptible to the influence from positively selected outcomes – these individuals generate worst trading profits. In similar settings, members of a social network might spend more money than they would do otherwise, take on excessive debt, or underestimate the costs of a business investment. Second, our effects from positive outcomes on active trading are estimated using a particular sample of peers. The groups we study are exogenously formed as most classmates do not know each other before the start of a course. Selective communication is likely more pronounced in our setting than among groups with close connections, since self-presentation concerns are more pervasive when people interact with strangers. For example, people often try to 31",

    "text": "avoid excessive bragging about personal achievements with family members or with close friends that already know about their qualities (Tice, et al., 1995). The peers we study are in an environment where selective self-presentation strategies might be used to gain admiration and respect from peers. While we expect for information transmission bias to be attenuated in groups with strong social ties, in several social settings (e.g., among co-workers or in digital media), people might still benefit from self-enhancement strategies. In such cases, talking about one’s successes, can have large effects on risk taking activity by other members of the group. 7. CONCLUSIONS This paper examines how social interactions, and in particular, informal word-of-mouth communication with peers affect an individual’s decision to participate in the stock market. We examine the decision to trade stocks among students in a financial education program. The setting is empirically attractive due to the exogenous assignment of students to groups where peers have experienced different outcomes. We find that a higher share of students with trading background in a given course increases the likelihood that other students start trading actively; an effect that is stronger when peers have experienced large returns. We introduce a model of social learning to distinguish predictions that are unique to a setting where information transmission is biased towards positive outcomes. We show that only positive peer returns affect market entry. Furthermore, we find that students registered for courses where peers had large returns underperform during the first year of active trading relative to other amateur investors. We rule out competing explanations for investor underperformance and show that the evidence is mostly consistent with the idea that selective communication encourages active trading among low-skilled individuals. These investors appear to be drawn to the stock market by successful accounts of classmates but obtain lower returns once they start trading. While self-enhancement is common in many social settings and has been widely studied among social psychologists, the extent of its influence on the decision making of others is less well understood. In finance, most of the empirical literature on social interactions focuses on identifying 32",

    "text": "peer effects in investment choices, or on estimating the strength of social contagion. Our findings suggest that is also valuable to understand the sources of communication bias within a social group. According to our evidence, selective communication plays a key role in the transmission of ideas, and more importantly, in the behavior of people expose to such information. Our analysis of peer effects in investment decisions is relevant to policy makers, finance scholars, and asset managers. Our findings highlight the limits and negative side of social learning – unfavorable outcomes emerge when social communication is inaccurate, or at least when it favors the partial transmission of information. Positive peer outcomes seem to attract more people into the stock market, but perhaps, would-be investors need transparent unbiased signals to critically evaluate investment ideas to correctly assess the likelihood of success. 8.

    "text": "APPENDIX A. SELECTIVE COMMUNICATION WITH RATIONAL SIGNAL RECEIVERS In the main text, we model the tendency to share positive outcomes by assuming that the transmitted peer signal from individuals with trading background to potential entrants is biased, 𝑠̃(cid:3045) (cid:3404) max(cid:4666) 0,𝑠̃ (cid:4667). In Section 2.2, signal receivers did not account for this bias in communication, (cid:3032) (cid:3032) updating their priors assuming that the peer signal follows a normal distribution – naïve signal receivers. In this section we extend the model by assuming that individuals internalize that a peer signal equals to zero might result either from experienced traders unwilling to share their negative performance or from the absence of classmates with trading background in a group. We assume that the probability of having at least one student with trading experience in a classroom is 𝑝. When potential entrants observe 𝑠̃(cid:3045) (cid:3404) 0 they update their expected payoffs from active trading as (cid:3032) follows: 𝐸(cid:3427)𝑣(cid:3556) |𝑠̃ , 𝑠̃ ,𝑠̃(cid:3045) (cid:3404) 0(cid:3431) (cid:3404) (cid:4666)1(cid:3398)𝑝(cid:4667)𝐸(cid:3427)𝑣(cid:3556) |𝑠̃ , 𝑠̃ (cid:3431)(cid:3397)𝑝𝐸(cid:3427)𝑣(cid:3556) |𝑠̃ , 𝑠̃ , 𝑠̃ (cid:3407) 0(cid:3431).

Although we don’t have a closed-form solution for this model, we can characterize the solution and infer the effect from different levels of private information on the entry probability. We do this as follows. First, since equation A.6 is monotonic with infinite range, there exists a cutoff 𝜇∗ for which the equation is exactly equal to 𝑐. Using the implicit function theorem, it is straightforward to show that 𝜇∗ is decreasing in 𝜏 , that is, 𝜕𝜇∗/𝜕𝜏 (cid:3407) 0. Since the cutoff decreases (cid:3036) (cid:3036) on 𝜏 , there are more signal outcomes that lead to entry when investors have better private (cid:3036) information. In other words, when the observed peer signal is zero, more skilled than unskilled individuals enter the market. Intuitively, a zero signal is associated with lack of communication, which is interpreted by potential entrants as negative peer outcomes. While the signal receiver cannot distinguish how bad the underperformance is, they discount some potential underperformance and thus are more reluctant to enter. This dissuasion effect is higher among unskilled individuals, who have less private information and are more sensitive to outside information. In turn, the ratio of well-informed to less-informed individuals when the true peer 53",

    "text": "outcome is negative is constant on the peer performance, but we should expect more well-informed entrants when individuals rationally anticipate that the signal is biased. When the true peer outcome is positive, we assume that the signal is accurately shared across classmates, and the entry choice depends on 𝑠̃ following equation (1). Figure A1 presents (cid:3032) the proportion of skilled to unskilled investors in the market as a function 𝑠̃ and compares the (cid:3032) with the prediction of the model of naïve signal receivers. When signal receiver perfectly internalizes the bias in communication there is a discontinuity at 𝑠̃ (cid:3404) 0(cid:2878). This happens because (cid:3032) for any positive signal, the uncertainty about having an experienced classmate is resolved. Overall the profile of skilled to unskilled entrants follows the same asymmetry as in the naïve case, which gives rise to Hypothesis 4 in the main text. 1.08 — - Naivesignalreceiver 1.06 (cid:127) RationalSignal Receiver 1.04 1.02 1 (cid:127) 0.98 < 0.96 0.94 0.92 0.9 -2 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 Figure A1 Ratio of skilled to unskilled entrants The graph plots the expected rate of skilled to unskilled market entrants for different peer signals.
