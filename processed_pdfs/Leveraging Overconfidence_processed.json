Using broker data, we find margin investors trade more, speculate more, and have worse security selection ability than cash investors. A long-short portfolio that follows the trades of margin investors loses 35 bps per day. Recent evidence suggests that margin trading is popular among retail investors. For example, a Yahoo- Finance Harris Poll of individual investors indicates 44% of investors have either traded options or bought on margin during the COVID pandemic. The percentage climbs to 67% among those between the ages of 18 to 34.1 In this paper, we investigate whether overconfidence can cause investors to use leverage to their detriment. We examine this question theoretically and empirically. Our analysis begins with the development of a theoretical model based on Odean (1998a) and Eyster, Rabin, & Vayanos (2019). High- skilled (e.g., professional) and low-skilled (e.g., retail) traders receive private signals about the terminal value of a risky asset in zero net supply; high-skilled traders receive a high precision signal, the low-skilled traders a low precision signal. Low-skilled traders may be overconfident in that they overestimate the precision of their private signal. Without regard to each other’s signals, traders submit demand schedules and trade at the market clearing price. Leverage is modeled by assuming traders face exogenous budget constraints. In this model, three important predictions arise: low-skilled investors with higher overconfidence are (1) more likely to use margin, (2) trade more actively, and (3) perform worse.2 To test the empirical predictions of this model, we analyze the behavior and common stock trading of individual investors, comparing the behavior, trading habits, and performance of investors who use margin (i.e., use leverage) to those who don’t. This is a particularly good setting to test our predictions as it is likely that the typical individual investor is at an information disadvantage to institutional investors when trading. Of course, some individuals are good traders and some institutions are bad traders. However, on average is it likely that individual investors have less skill and information than professional investors.3 To test our first prediction, that overconfidence will lead investors to use margin, we use survey data from the National Financial Capability Study administered by the FINRA Investor Education Foundation. Specifically, we analyze responses of 1,601 respondents from the 2015 Investor Survey; 37% report having a margin account and 18% report having experience buying stock on margin. Survey respondents take two quizzes, a 10-question quiz that measures investment literacy and a 6-question quiz that measures financial literacy. Separately, respondents are asked to self-assess their investment knowledge and financial knowledge on a 7-point Likert scale. We measure overconfidence in investment knowledge as the difference in a respondent’s percentile rank on self-assessed investment knowledge less the respondent’s percentile rank on the investment quiz. There is an analogous calculation for overconfidence in financial knowledge. 1 https://theharrispoll.com/investor-index/ 2 We focus on the effects of overconfidence on low-skilled (e.g., retail) investors, not the effects of overconfidence on high-skilled investors or the differences in the behavior of skilled and unskilled investors. 3 See Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean (2009) for a comparison of the trading profits of all individual and institutional investors in Taiwan.",

    "text": "As shown in Figure 1, investors who trade on margin (Panel C) have greater overconfidence than investors with margin accounts but no margin experience (Panel B) or investors with cash accounts (Panel A). For example, investors with experience trading on margin are at the 65th percentile in their self-assessed financial knowledge, but the 37th percentile on quizzed financial knowledge (Panel C, left pair of bars). To test the robustness of this positive relationship between investor overconfidence and margin accounts, we estimate a linear probability model where the dependent variable is an indicator that equals one if the investor has a margin account. The key independent variable is measured overconfidence (based on either investment or financial knowledge). To this baseline regression we include a number of demographic controls (e.g., marital status, gender, age, etc.) and preference or trust variables (e.g., measures of risk tolerance, portfolio allocations, trust in financial markets). In the full model with all control variables, the probability of having a margin account is positively related to the overconfidence measures and the effects are economically large. A one standard deviation increase in investment overconfidence is associated with a 7.9 percentage point increase in the probability of having a margin account, which represents a 21% increase relative to the baseline probability of having a margin account in this sample (37%).4 A one standard deviation increase in financial overconfidence has similar effects. In additional tests, we analyze the use of margin conditional on having a margin account by analyzing the subsample of margin account holders. In these analyses, the dependent variable is an indicator that takes a value of one if the investor used margin to purchase stocks. The key independent variable is measured overconfidence (based on either financial or investment knowledge). With the broad set of controls described above, we find the use of margin among margin account holders is positively related to overconfidence measures. A one standard deviation increase in investment (financial) knowledge overconfidence is associated with a 9.4 (5.6) percentage point increase in the probability of using margin. In the second part of the paper, we use data from a large discount broker over the period 1991 to 1996. These data were first used by Barber and Odean (2000), and have been subsequently used by a number of papers. These data allow us to test our two additional hypotheses: low-skilled margin investors will speculate more and perform worse than low-skilled, but well-calibrated, investors. To do so, we analyze the trading and performance for the non-retirement accounts of over 43,000 investors; 66% have only margin accounts, 34% have only cash accounts, and 13% have experience using margin.5 To set the stage for the performance analysis and test the second prediction of our model, we compare the monthly turnover and frequency of speculative trading for three groups of investors: investors with cash accounts (Cash Investors), investors with margin accounts but no observed margin experience in our sample 4 See Section 2.2.1 for the details of these calculations. 5 We do not directly observe margin trades. As a result, we identify investors as having experience with margin if we observe a short position in their monthly position statement or a trade in an option security.",

Monthly turnover is measured as the average of purchase and sale turnover, which is the value of purchases (or sales) scaled by the investor’s position size. For each investor, we calculate average monthly turnover across months. Speculative trades are defined as sales for a gain followed by a purchase within three weeks (both the sale and purchase are considered speculative trades).6 This definition filters out sales for a loss, which might occur to harvest a tax loss, and sales that are not followed by a purchase, which might occur because an investor needs cash. For each investor, we calculate the percentage of all trades that are speculative. In Figure 2, we show the average monthly turnover and percentage of all trades that are speculative. Consistent with our predictions that overconfidence will lead to greater use of margin and more active trading, we find that margin account investors, but especially margin experience investors, trade more and more speculatively than cash investors. The monthly turnover of cash, margin account, and margin experience investors are 6.9, 7.8, and 15.2% (respectively). All pairwise tests reject the null of equality. These same patterns are evident in the proportion of trades that are speculative. The percentage of cash, margin account, and margin experience investors are 15.2, 17.9, and 29.7% (respectively). All pairwise tests reject the null of equality. In additional tests we control for investor characteristics (e.g., age, gender, marital status, income, wealth, etc.) and find the differences in Figure 2 are not affected much by these controls. In sum, we find strong support for our second prediction: Margin investors trade more frequently and more speculatively than other investors. Frequent trading by margin investors might emanate from either overconfidence or an information advantage. In our theoretical setup, for investors with low precision information, higher overconfidence increases the use of margin and results in lower profits. In contrast, more precise information increases the use of margin and results in greater profits. To better assess which motive is the more likely driver of margin use by individual investors, we analyze the performance of trades by investors in three trading groups describe above: cash investors, margin account investors, and margin experience investors. To do so, we construct a calendar-time portfolio that mimics the buys of cash investors by assuming the stock is purchased at the transaction price and sold three days later. We similarly construct a short portfolio, which mimics the sales of cash investors and closes the short position three days later. These long-short portfolios are constructed for each investor group, yielding a time-series of daily returns on the long-short portfolio. To assess the returns earned on these portfolios, we regress the daily returns less the risk-free rate on the market excess return to estimate a daily abnormal return (or CAPM alpha). We also estimate daily abnormal 6 In unreported analyses, we use a more restrictive definition of speculative trades that additionally filters out sales for a loss, which might occur to harvest a tax loss, and partial sales for a gain which could be motivated by rebalancing. With the more restrictive measure, fewer trades are identified as speculative; all of our other results are qualitatively similar for both measures.",

    "text": "returns using the Fama and French (2015) five-factor model plus a momentum factor (labeled FF5+Mom Alpha). In Figure 3, we present the daily abnormal returns from these strategies. All three groups of investors perform poorly, as the long-short portfolios earns economically large and statistically significant negative alphas ranging from 24.7 bps to 35.5 bps per day. Thus, individual investors perform poorly in general. Cash investors and margin account investors have similarly poor performance with daily abnormal returns around 25 bps per day. However, because margin account investors trade more than cash investors trading is arguably more detrimental to their performance. What’s particularly remarkable is the poor security selection of margin experience investors; the long-short portfolio that mimics the trades of margin experience investors loses about 35 bps per day and the 10 bps spread between investors with margin experience and other investors is economically and statistically significant (𝑝 < .01). However, the performance penalty is compounded by the fact that margin experience investors trade at nearly twice the rate of other investors (see Figure 2). We interpret this evidence as providing strong support for our third prediction that (overconfident) margin investors perform worse than other investors. While there may be some informed margin investors in our sample, they appear to be in a minority. We consider a number of competing explanations for the empirical results. We show that skewness preferences cannot explain our results. Though margin increases the volatility of return outcomes, it does not change the skewness of returns. And though margin investors display slightly greater skewness preferences than cash investors the differences are economically small and do not explain the performance differences that we observe between cash and margin investors. Investors with a greater appetite for risk are more likely to use margin. However, greater risk tolerance alone cannot explain why margin users trade more and perform worse than cash investors. Well-calibrated risk tolerant investors should earn higher average returns than their more risk-averse peers. Furthermore, while well-calibrated risk tolerant investors might use margin, this would not explain why we observe greater miscalibration amongst margin users in our survey data. Investors may trade for entertainment. But entertainment motives for trade also do not explain why we observe greater miscalibration among investors who use margin. Entertainment alone also does not predict that investors will use margin, unless one tautologically assumes that trading is more fun when one borrows to do so. Finally, if entertainment motivates the use of margin trading perhaps in a “fun” account we would expect to observe a greater use of margin in accounts that represent a small fraction of an investor’s overall wealth. Empirically, we observe the opposite: investors are more likely to use margin when the ratio of brokerage assets to self-reported net worth is above the median for the sample. Our study is related to two recent studies of leveraged trading in foreign exchange markets.

    "text": "leverage constraints reduce trading volume and improve traders’ average monthly returns. We extend this work by analyzing the use of leverage in the trading of common stock. Importantly, we provide evidence that overconfidence is a likely mechanism driving these results as we show margin investors exhibit higher levels of overconfidence than other investors. Heimer and Imas (2020) argue that behavioral biases might cause leveraged investors to perform poorly. To test this conjecture, they use the forex dataset and an experimental market to analyze the disposition effect and document investors who use leverage have a stronger disposition effect. We find support for their findings as the margin investors we analyze have a stronger disposition effect than cash investors. However, the greater disposition effect of margin investors does not explain why investors who use margin have greater overconfidence, as we document in survey data, or why they trade more than other investors, which we show using brokerage data. Our paper fits into the large literature on the behavior and performance of individual investors. In theory, overconfident investors will trade to their detriment (Odean, 1998a; Gervais and Odean, 2001; Caballe and Sakovics, 2003).7 Consistent with the idea that individual investors are overconfident about their ability and trade to their detriment, many studies find individual investors earn poor returns both before and after transaction costs (Barber and Odean, 2001; Grinblatt and Keloharju, 2000, 2009).8 Overconfidence has also been associated with a greater propensity to trade (Dorn and Huberman, 2005; Grinblatt and Keloharju, 2009). (See Barber and Odean (2013) for a review of this literature.) We contribute to this literature by documenting an important interaction between leverage and overconfidence. Leverage is particularly appealing to overconfident investors, but the use of leverage hurts their performance.9 Our work also ties to the literature on financial literacy. Many people lack basic financial literacy (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011) and financial literacy is correlated with a number of important financial behaviors like planning for retirement or savings. Anderson, Baker, and Robinson (2017) document that perceived literacy rather than actual literacy motivates behavior. This is quite similar to our finding that self-assessments of financial or investment literacy are generally more important than actual literacy scores in predicting the use of margin. Though we focus on the overconfidence and margin use of retail investors, institutions may also suffer the consequences of taking leveraged risks that overconfidence causes them to underestimate. A possible 7 Other models that consider investor overconfidence include DeLong, Shleifer, Summers, and Waldman (1991), Benos (1998), Kyle and Wang (1997), Daniel, Hirshleifer, & Subramanyam (1998, 2001). 8 There is evidence that the buy-sell imbalance of individual investors in the U.S. positively predicts short-term returns (Barber, Odean, & Zhu, 2008; Kelley and Tetlock, 2013; Kaniel, Saar, & Titman, 2008; Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, & Zhang, 2020). Barber, Odean, & Zhu (2008) find the buy-sell imbalance negatively predicts returns at longer horizons. 9 We show that overconfidence can lead investors to trade on margin. Cognitive dissonance could create a feedback loop in which trading on margin increases investor overconfidence. The basic idea is that most people want to maintain a positive self-image as a reasonable person. It could be perceived as unreasonable to trade on margin if one expected to lose money doing so. Therefore, to resolve cognitive dissonance and maintain a self-image as a reasonable person, an investor who is already trading on margin might convince himself that he has superior ability.",

    "text": "example of this is Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) which combined absolute-return trading strategies with high financial leverage that were initially successful but resulted in $4.6 billion in losses in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Amid concerns of systemic effects of a LTCM failure, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of $3.6 billion by LTCM’s major creditors in 1998.10 Our results may extrapolate to other markets. In housing markets, where leverage is readily accessible and often used, overconfident homebuyers might use more leverage, speculate more, and thereby potentially facilitate the formation of a bubble. Consistent with the idea that mistaken beliefs contributed to the housing bubble, Cheng, Raina, & Xiong (2014) show midlevel managers in securitized finance did not exhibit awareness of problems in housing markets in 2004-2006 period and certain groups were aggressive in increasing their exposure to housing during the pre-crisis period. In corporations, overconfident CEOs make poor decisions (Roll, 1986; Malmendier and Tate, 2005, 2008, 2009; Ben-David, Graham, and Harvey, 2013). Overconfident CEOs might leverage their hubris, further exacerbating its deleterious effects on decision making. Consistent with this idea, Ben-David, Graham, & Harvey (2013) document that overconfident CEOs are more likely to use leverage. Ho, Huang, Lin, & Yen (2016) find overconfident bank CEOs were more likely to increase leverage and weaken lending standards leading up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, making them more vulnerable to financial crisis shocks. While we focus on margin trading on the level of individual investors, others look at the aggregate effects of margin trading. In India, margin traders provide liquidity to other traders except during market crises and margin trading increases the comovement of stocks (Kahraman and Tookes, 2017; Kahraman and Tookes, 2020). Three recent papers examine margin trading during the 2015 Chinese stock market bubble and crash. Hansman, Hong, Jian, Liu, & Meng (2019) find that relaxation of margin constraints contributed to the bubble and that unconstrained speculators front-ran predictable price increases in marginable stocks; Bian, Da, Lou, & Zhou (2019) find that during the crash there was a high correlation in the returns of stocks that shared a significant overlap in the investors who owned the stocks on margin; and Bian, He, Shue, & Zhou (2018) report that leverage induced sales contributed to the crash with stocks disproportionately held by margin investors experiencing abnormal price declines followed by reversals. We do not claim that all investors who use leverage are overconfident. In theory, well-calibrated investors with superior skill or information might benefit from the use of margin. We do argue that 10 Some of our theoretical findings of the effect of higher overconfidence pertain also to high-skilled investors. High- skilled investors with higher overconfidence are (1) more likely to use leverage, (2) trade more actively, and (3) have lower expected utility than if they were well-calibrated. However, under some circumstances, higher overconfidence increases the expected returns of high-skilled investors while lowering their expected utility. In our model, we assume that high-skilled investors are rational in order to focus on the effects of overconfidence among low-skilled (e.g., retail) investors.",

    "text": "overconfident investors are more likely to use leverage and that in the domain we study, individual investors with nonretirement brokerage accounts, it is plausible that overconfidence is the dominant motivation for the use of leverage. Supporting this conjecture, we find that margin investors are more overconfident, trade more and more speculatively, and perform worse than other investors. 1 The Model In this section, we sketch out a model in which overconfident traders face an exogenous budget constraint which yields testable predictions. The model draws on features of models in Diamond and Verrecchia (1981), Hellwig (1980), Odean (1998a) and Eyster, Rabin, and Vayanos (2019). The details of the model and proof of propositions are provided in the appendix. A riskless asset and one risky asset are exchanged in one round of trading at time t = 1. Consumption takes place only at t = 2, at which time the riskless asset pays 1 unit per share and each share of the risky 1 asset pays 𝑣̃~𝑁(μ , ⁄ ). The riskless interest rate is assumed to be 0. There are N investors; we analyze 0 λ 0 the limit economy where 𝑁 → ∞. Thus, each investor correctly assumes that his own demand does not affect prices. At 𝑡 = 0, each trader has an endowment of 𝑓 of the riskless asset and of 𝑥 = 0 of the risky 0 0 asset, the net supply of which is assumed to be zero, known, and unchanging. Thus, each trader’s wealth at 𝑡 = 0 is 𝑊 = 𝑓 0 0. Prior to trading at t = 1, each trader, j, receives one of M = 2 private signals corresponding to his type, 1 𝑠̃ = 𝑣̃+𝜀̃ , 𝑚 = 𝐻,𝐿, where 𝜀̃ has the objective distribution 𝜀̃ ~N(0, ⁄ ) and λ > λ (i.e., H is 𝑗 𝑚 𝑚 𝑚 λ 𝐻 𝐿 𝑚 higher precision signal than signal L). Traders differ not only in the precision of their signals but also in their beliefs about those precisions. Traders believe the distribution of their signal to be 1 𝜀̃ ~N(0, ⁄ ); γ = 1 corresponds to rational beliefs and γ > 1 to overconfidence. In this analysis 𝑚 γ λ 𝑚 𝑚 𝑚 𝑚 we assume that γ is always 1; thus traders receiving low precision signals may be overconfident. As 𝐻 discussed in Odean (1998a), the differing precision of private signals in this model can alternatively be interpreted as differing abilities to interpret public information. All traders have constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) utility over their wealth at 𝑡 = 2 with a risk- aversion coefficient of r, i.e., the utility of trader j is 𝑈 = −exp(−𝑟𝑊 ). Our model departs from Odean 𝑗 2,𝑗 (1998a) and follows Eyster, Rabin, and Vayanos (2019) in that traders ignore the signals of others and do not attempt to infer the signals of others from prices when they trade. Each trader j solves: max𝐸[−exp(−𝑟𝑊 )|𝑠 ] subject to 𝑃 𝑥 +𝑓 ≤ 𝑓 (1) 2,𝑗 𝑗 1 1,𝑗 1,𝑗 0,𝑗 𝑥1,𝑗",

    "text": "When solving the maximization problem, each trader conjectures that price is a linear function of his private signal. An equilibrium is obtained because traders believe that they are behaving optimally, even though they are not. The equilibrium and proofs are presented in the appendix. In the propositions, we analyze the effects of moderate degrees of overconfidence, that is overconfidence in the region close to γ = 1 for Low information type traders. We define use of margin by trader j to be trader j buying a position in the risky asset with value greater than trader j’s initial wealth in the riskless asset, i.e., 𝑃 𝑥 > 𝑓 = 𝑊 . To simplify our analysis of margin 1 1,𝑗 0 0 γ use, we assume that μ ≫ 𝐿⁄ , which holds true if the probability of zero payoff is sufficiently low, 0 λ 0 provided overconfidence of the low type (γ ) is sufficiently low as well. This leads to three propositions. 𝐿 Proposition 1a: Low information traders’ trading volume increases in overconfidence. Proposition 2a: Low information traders’ expected profit decreases in overconfidence. Proposition 3a: Low information traders’ probability of using margin increases in overconfidence. These three propositions are the main focus of our empirical tests. Overconfident traders behave as if their signals were more precise than they actually are and place larger trades (in absolute value) than if they were not overconfident. This leads to greater trading and use of margin. Misinterpreting the precision of their signals, leads to suboptimal behavior that lowers expected profits. As discussed in the introduction, investors who are not overconfident might use margin because they have better information. This is true in our model. Proposition 1b: Low information traders’ trading volume increases in signal precision if γ ≤ 2. L Proposition 2b: Low information traders’ expected profit increases in signal precision for γ = 1. L Proposition 3b: Low information traders’ probability of using margin increases in signal precision if γ ≤ L 2. While both overconfidence and greater signal precision can lead to greater use of margin, overconfidence is coupled with lower expected profits while greater signal precision with higher expected profits when overconfidence is not too high. We can, therefore, analyze the profitability of retail investors who use margin (versus those who don’t) to understand whether their use of margin is more likely to be motivated by overconfidence or superior information. 2 Data 2.1 FINRA Investor Survey Our first dataset is a 2015 investment survey of 2000 investors who have non-retirement brokerage accounts in the U.S. administered by the FINRA Investor Education Foundation (FINRA Investor Survey).",

    "text": "The FINRA Investor Survey is a follow-up to the 2015 FINRA State-by-State Survey of about 500 adults per state (about 25,000 total). FINRA conducted a follow-up Investor Survey of 2,000 investors in the State- by-State Survey who indicated they had a non-retirement brokerage account. Both surveys are conducted online and respondents were contacted via email. The response rate for the FINRA State-by-State Survey is about 3%, and the response rate for the follow-up FINRA Investor Survey is 38%. We match the answers in the Investor Survey to the State-by-State Survey to obtain information on respondents’ access and use of margin, financial literacy, investment literacy, demographics, risk preferences, and trust in financial markets or regulation. Our main analysis is based on 1601 observations for which we have data on all control variables used later in our analyses. (The univariate results for the broader sample are very similar to those presented in the main analysis.) In Table 1, we provide a variable dictionary and break variables into three broad groups: measures of margin availability and experience (Panel A), financial/investment literacy, self-assessment, and overconfidence measures (Panel B), and demographic information and risk preferences (Panel C). We present descriptive statistics for the sample in Table 2. In Panel A, we note that 37.2% of respondents answer “Yes” to having the ability to buy stock on margin, 31.5% do not have the ability to buy stock on margin (𝑛𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑐𝑐), and 31.4% do not know if they have the ability to purchase on margin (𝑑𝑛𝑘𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑐𝑐).11 Of the 37.2% (595 respondents) who answer “Yes” to having the ability to buy stock on margin, 48.1% (286 respondents) answer “Yes” to “Have you made any securities purchases on margin?”. Thus, 17.9% of the 1601 investor survey sample have made purchases on margin. We use three measures of overconfidence based on investment literacy, financial literacy, and personal performance expectations (respectively 𝑂𝐶_𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑙𝑖𝑡, 𝑂𝐶_𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑡, and 𝑂𝐶_𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑓). Overconfidence in investment literacy is measured using a self-assessment of investment knowledge and a ten question investment literacy quiz administered as part of the Investment Survey. The self-assessment asks respondents “On a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 means very low and 7 means very high, how would you assess your overall investment knowledge?”. The average response for respondents is 5.06 (𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓_𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒). The investment literacy quiz asks respondents ten questions about investment concepts that are more detailed than those covered in the financial literacy quiz. The questions cover the following topics: stocks, bonds, bankruptcy, risk/return relation, asset class returns, inflation rates, nominal/real returns, municipal bonds, short selling, and margin buying. (See the appendix for the full text of the literacy questions.) The average respondent correctly answers 4.98 of 10 questions for a score of 49.8% (𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑙𝑖𝑡_𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒). We convert the self-assessment and quiz scores to percentile ranks. Overconfidence in investment literacy is measured as the difference between the two percentile rank variables: 11 Nine respondents answered “prefer not to say.” We group these respondents with the “do not know” respondents.",

(2) Overconfidence in financial literacy is measured using a self-assessment of financial knowledge and a six question financial literacy quiz administered as part of the State-by-State Survey. The self-assessment asks respondents “On a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 means very low and 7 means very high, how would you assess your overall financial knowledge?”. The average response for respondents is 5.87 (𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓_𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒). The financial literacy quiz asks respondents six questions about basic financial literacy that address compound interest, inflation, bond/interest rate relations, consumer loans, mortgages, and investment in own-company stock. (See the appendix for the full text of the literacy questions.) The average respondent correctly answers 4.4 of 7 questions for a score of 72.9% (𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑡_𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒). To measure overconfidence in financial literacy, we convert the self-assessment score and the financial literacy score to percentile ranks (𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓_𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐 and 𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑡_𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐). Overconfidence in financial literacy is a person’s percentile rank in self- assessment of financial knowledge less the percentile rank on the financial literacy quiz: 𝑂𝐶_𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑡 = 𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓_𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐 − 𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑡_𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐. (3) The overconfidence measure allows us to assess cross-sectional variation in overconfidence, but does not allow us to test whether the sample is overconfident on average since, by construction, the overconfidence measure has a mean of zero for the sample.12 Overconfidence in the context of our theoretical model is the belief that one can better predict the future performance of a stock than is actually the case. Our two main measures of overconfidence, 𝑂𝐶_𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑙𝑖𝑡 and 𝑂𝐶_𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑡, measure overconfidence in one’s investment or financial knowledge rather than one’s stock picking ability. It is likely that investors who overestimate how much they know about investments and finance also overestimate the probability that they can pick stocks that will beat the market. Consistent with the idea that miscalibration is correlated within the finance and investment domain, we find our two measures of overconfidence have a positive correlation of 55.2%. Thus, we believe the two overconfidence measures provide a noisy but reasonable proxy for overconfidence in one’s stock picking ability. The noise in our measures will cause us to underestimate the effect of overconfidence in one’s stock picking ability on the probability of margin use. As a third measure of overconfidence, we identify investors who expect to perform better than the market as a whole based on the following survey question: “Over the next 12 months, how well do you expect your portfolio of investments to perform?” Respondents can choose worse than the market as a whole, about the same as the rest of the market, or better than the market as a whole. We label this variable 12 The mean overconfidence measure for our sample will differ from precisely zero because we calculate percentile ranks for all available respondents but only analyze those with available control variables. The percentile ranks on 𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑡_𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒, 𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓_𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒, 𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑙𝑖𝑡_𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒, and 𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑓_𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 of approximately 0.52 to 0.54 indicate the respondents with available control data are slightly above average on these dimensions.",

    "text": "as overconfidence in performance (𝑂𝐶_𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑓) as there is little evidence that investors can systematically beat the market (particularly after fees).13 Almost 29% of investors expect to perform better than the market as a whole. It’s possible that investors who use margin leverage their investment in the market and believe the market will increase in the next 12 months. We cannot rule this possibility out and, as a result, prefer our first two measures of overconfidence. Nonetheless, overconfidence would also lead investors to incorrectly anticipate market-beating returns from their trades. Our empirical analysis of trades by investors with margin experience indicates trading causes them to underperform, rather than outperform, the market. In Panel C of Table 2, we present demographic information on the sample. The sample is well-educated (64% have a college degree), white (80%), mostly male (58%), and mostly married (70%). 39% of respondents have children as dependents. About half of respondents are over the age of 55. The portfolio size in the non-retirement account is greater than $250,000 for 36% of respondents. In Panel D of Table 2, we present descriptive statistics on risk and trust measures for the sample. We measure risk attitudes using the response to the following question: “Which of the following statements comes closest to describing the amount of financial risk that you are willing to take when you save or make investments?”. Respondents answers include: Take substantial financial risks expecting to earn substantial return (High Risk, 11.4%), Take above average financial risks expecting to earn above average return (Above Ave., 33.2%), Take average financial risks expecting to earn average return (Ave. Risk, 48.3%), and Not willing to take any financial risks (No Risk, 7.1%). Most of the sample has more than a 50% allocation to stock (>50% Stock, 62%) and only 4% have no stock allocation (No Stock). We measure trust in markets based on the answer to the following question: “How confident are you that U.S financial markets offer good long-term opportunities for investors.” Respondents answer using a 10-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Not at all confident) to 10 (Extremely Confident). The average response is 7.2 (𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑀𝑘𝑡). We use the average response to three questions regarding investors trust in regulation. Respondents assess whether “financial markets are effectively regulated,” “regulators are able to keep up with new market developments,” and regulators are “looking out for ordinary investors” using a 10-point Likert scale. We average the response to the three questions to create a variable that measures trust in regulation (𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑅𝑒𝑔), which has an average value of 5.7 across respondents. 2.2 Discount Broker Data Our second dataset comes from the discount broker dataset first used in Barber and Odean (2000), but used in a number of other subsequent studies which are reviewed in Barber and Odean (2013). The dataset contains information on trades and monthly positions from 1991 to 1996 for about 68,000 investors and 13 See Barber and Odean (2013) for a review of the evidence on the performance of individual investors.",

    "text": "158,000 accounts. For a subset of the data, we have demographic data from a market research firm and survey responses completed when the account was opened. We restrict our analysis to about 43,000 investors with nonretirement accounts since the motivation for investment and trading may differ in retirement and nonretirement accounts. This definition also lines up with the survey sample, which consists of investors with investments in nonretirement accounts. Including retirement accounts as cash accounts in our analysis does not materially affect our results. We also require that an investor hold only one type of non-retirement account (margin or cash) and place at least one stock trade during the sample period.14 We do not directly observe the use of margin by margin investors. As a proxy for margin experience, we identify investors that have a short stock position in their monthly position statement (denoted by a negative stock balance) or trade options.15 The basic idea is investors who are willing to short stocks or trade options are also more likely to use margin when trading. In Table 3, we provide variable definitions for the broker dataset. The margin variables are presented in Panel A, and trading activity variables in Panel B. Turnover is measured on a monthly basis as the average of purchase and sales turnover as in Barber and Odean (2001). Speculative trades are complete sales for a gain followed by a purchase within three weeks as in Odean (1999) and purchases preceded by a complete sale for a gain in the prior three weeks. Requiring a gain filters out sales that might be done to harvest a tax loss, requiring complete sales filters out rebalancing trades, and requiring a purchase within three weeks of the trade filters out liquidity-motivated sales. As in Odean (1998b), the proportion of gains realized (𝑃𝐺𝑅) is the ratio of realized gains divided by the sum of realized gains and unrealized gains; both the numerator and denominator are counted only on days with a sale. There is a similar calculation for the proportion of losses realized (𝑃𝐿𝑅). Returns after trade (Panel C) are calculated in event time from the day of trade (𝑡 = 0). On the day of trade, the return is calculated from the transaction price to the stock’s closing price. On subsequent days, we use the CRSP return. We then calculate the event-time abnormal return following a buy over the horizon (0,ℎ) as: ℎ ℎ 𝑅𝑏(0,ℎ)= ∏(1+𝑟 )−∏(1+𝑟 ), (4) 𝑖𝑡 𝑚𝑡 𝑡=0 𝑡=1 where 𝑟 is the return of stock 𝑖 on day 𝑡 and 𝑟 is the CRSP value-weighted market index. We also 𝑖𝑡 𝑚𝑡 construct calendar-time portfolios that mimic the buys and sells of different groups of investors, which we 14 We define cash accounts as accounts with the variable 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 =𝐶 or 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒2=𝐶𝐴 and margin accounts as accounts with 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒 =𝑀 or 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒2=𝑀𝐴. 15 Options trading is based on the broker product codes (OEQ, OFC, OIC, OIN, OPO). Virtually all of these trades occur in margin accounts, but 413 investors with only cash accounts have trades with these product codes. We exclude these investors from our analysis.",

    "text": "describe in detail later. Our return calculations do not consider commissions; including commissions will disproportionately reduce the net returns of more active investors. Demographic variables are presented in Panel D. In later analyses we use these demographic variables as controls for investor characteristics. While descriptive statistics on investor knowledge and experience are based on averages of the 4-point scale, the control variables use dummy variables for each category. We also use dummy variables for each income bin and the log of wealth. When we are missing information for a particular variable, the variable is set to the sample mean and we introduce a missing dummy variable for each control variable that takes a value of one if the control variable is missing. To assess robustness of our results, we also conduct analyses based on a limited sample for which we have all control variables. In Table 4, we present descriptive statistics on the investors meeting the sample requirements described above. In Panel A, we see that about 65.9% of investors have margin accounts and 13.3% of investors have margin experience. In Panel B, we see that the average investor has monthly turnover of 8.5% (annual turnover of about 102%), 7.6% of trades are speculative, the average investor is more likely to realize gains than losses (𝑃𝐺𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑃𝐿𝑅 = 1.907), and the average portfolio size is just under $50,000. (The number of observations on the ratio of 𝑃𝐺𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑃𝐿𝑅 drops because a household must sell a stock for a loss to compute the ratio since PLR appears in the denominator of the ratio.) In Panel C, we observe the average investor has poor trading ability as the returns after purchases are generally negative, which is consistent with the evidence in Odean (1999) and Barber, Lee, Liu, & Odean (2009). In Panel D, we observe the sample consists mostly of men and of people who are married. The average investor is 50 years old and reports an income of about $74,000; 22.7% of investors have children in the household. For a more limited sample, we have self-reported estimates of investment knowledge, investment experience, and wealth; the latter averages about $251,000. 3 Are Margin Traders Overconfident? Evidence from FINRA Investor Survey 3.1 Univariate Results Our first test of the prediction that overconfident investors are more likely to use margin (i.e., Proposition 1) is a simple comparison of the three overconfidence measures (investment literacy, financial literacy, and performance) for those with or without margin accounts. In our main analysis, we test whether the overconfidence of 595 margin account holders differ from the 1006 other investors.16 The results of this analysis are presented in columns 1-6, Table 5. In Panel A, we analyze the three overconfidence measures based on investment literacy (𝑂𝐶_𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑙𝑖𝑡), financial literacy (𝑂𝐶_𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑡), and 16 In appendix table A1, we compare the overconfidence of margin account holders to cash account holders and to investors who do not know if they have a margin account. Margin account holders are more overconfident than both other groups though the investors who answer ‘do not know’ to the margin question tend to have lower levels of financial literacy than others.",

    "text": "performance (𝑂𝐶_𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑓). For investment and financial literacy, we also present the components of the overconfidence measures. Those with margin account have great overconfidence in both investment and financial literacy. The differences in overconfidence in column 5 are quite similar for both measure (0.221 and 0.208, 𝑝 < .001 in both cases). The magnitudes of these overconfidence differences represent more than half of a standard deviation for 𝑂𝐶_𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑙𝑖𝑡 and 𝑂𝐶_𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑡, which are 0.364 and 0.388 respectively (see Table 2). For both measures, the majority of the difference in overconfidence can be traced to the self- assessed knowledge of margin account holders (column 3), which are at the 68.7 percentile and 61.3 percentile for investment and financial self-assessed knowledge (respectively). Investment literacy is quite similar for margin account holders and other investors (54.9 vs. 53.4 percentile respectively); the financial literacy of margin investors and is slightly lower than other investors (48.2 vs. 55.1).17 Our third measure of overconfidence is whether an investor believes he will beat the market. On average, 39% of margin account holders expect to beat the market compared to 22.3% of other investors. In Panel B, we present descriptive statistics on the demographic characteristics of margin account holders, other investors, and the difference between the two. Relative to other investors, margin account holders are more likely to be male, college-educated, nonwhite, younger, and have bigger portfolios. We observe little difference in the marital status of margin account holders. It is possible that these demographic characteristics are jointly correlated with a preference for margin accounts and overconfidence, which could yield a spurious difference in the overconfidence of margin account holders and other investors (a type of omitted variable problem). In later analyses, we control for these demographic differences and continue to find overconfidence is related to the probability of being a margin account holder. (As we discuss later, these demographic controls may overcorrect for a potential omitted variable because overconfidence might cause the demographic differences between margin account holders and others; for example, men might prefer margin accounts to women because they are more overconfident than women.18) In Panel C, we present descriptive statistics on risk and trust variables. Relative to other investors, margin account holders are more likely to express a willingness to take substantial financial risk (labeled “high risk” in the table), have a larger allocation to stocks, and have greater trust in markets and financial regulation. In contrast to the demographic controls, which might overcorrect for an unknown omitted variable, it’s quite plausible that risk or trust preferences directly affect an investors willingness to open a margin account and are also correlated with overconfidence. We carefully consider this possibility in later 17 Recall that we drop survey responses with incomplete data and thus end up with percentile ranks that average slightly more than 0.50 for the final sample of 1601. 18 We find mixed evidence that men are more overconfidence than women. Men expect to beat the market more often than women (30.5 vs. 25.7%, 𝑝<.05), but men have less financial and investment overconfidence than women (differences of 0.071 and 0.049, 𝑝<.05).",

    "text": "analyses. To preview these results, risk preferences and trust do affect the propensity to open or use margin, but the effect of overconfidence survives granular controls for risk preferences or trust. The above analysis analyzes margin account holders without conditioning on whether the investor has traded on margin. However, as seen in Figure 1, margin account holders with margin experience have lower levels of actual investment and financial literacy yet higher self-assessed levels than margin account holders who have not traded on margin. We focus on this difference by splitting the 595 investors with margin accounts into the 286 investors with experience buying on margin and the 309 investors with margin accounts, but no experience buying on margin. We present these results in columns 7-12, Table 5. In Panel A, we observe those with margin experience are consistently more overconfident than investors with margin accounts but no margin experience. The three key overconfidence variables (𝑂𝐶_𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑙𝑖𝑡, 𝑂𝐶_𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑡, and 𝑂𝐶_𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑓) all indicate those with margin experience are more overconfident than those without margin experience. Among investors with margin experience, self-assessed investment and financial knowledge fall at the 76th and 65th percentile (respectively), as shown in Figure 1, Panel B, and column 9, Table 5; both self-assessment scores are reliably higher than margin account holders without margin experience (𝑝 < .001). Interestingly, the margin experience investors have investment and financial literacy that rank at the 47th and 37th percentile (respectively), as shown in Figure 1, Panel B, and column 9, Table 5; both literacy scores are reliably lower than margin account holders without margin experience. In addition, margin experience investors expect to beat the market at much higher rates than those without margin experience (46.2% versus 32.4%). In Panel B, we observe margin users tend to be younger with children and smaller portfolios. Otherwise, the demographic differences between those with margin experience and those without (columns 7-12, Table 5) are generally smaller than the differences between margin and cash accounts (columns 1-6). In Panel C, we observe the differences in risk, stock allocations, and trust between those with margin experience and those without (columns 7-12) are analogous to those observed between cash and margin account holders (columns 1-6). 3.2 Multivariate Results 3.2.1 Margin Account Use The univariate results indicate margin investors, particularly those with margin experience, are more overconfident than other investors. In this section, we test Proposition 1 by analyzing whether overconfident investors are more likely to use margin after controlling for differences in demographics and preferences. To do so, we estimate a linear probability model where the dependent variable equals one if an investor opened a margin account (𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑐𝑐) and the key independent variable is a measure of overconfidence (e.g., overconfidence in investment literacy, 𝑂𝐶_𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑙𝑖𝑡):",

We hypothesize the coefficient b is positive since overconfident investors are more likely to open a margin account. We also estimate regressions that use financial overconfidence (𝑂𝐶_𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑙𝑖𝑡) and performance overconfidence (𝑂𝐶_𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑓) as the key independent variable.19 We test whether investors with greater investment (financial) literacy are more likely to open a margin account by including both the investment (financial) overconfidence variable and the investment (financial) literacy variable in the regression: 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑐𝑐 = 𝑎+𝑏⋅𝑂𝐶_𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑙𝑖𝑡+𝑐⋅𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑙𝑖𝑡_𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑐+𝑋Γ+𝑒. (6) While we anticipate margin use will increase with overconfidence (𝑏 > 0) the effect of increased literacy on margin use is less obvious. Investors with greater investment and financial literacy could use margin more because they have more investment skill (see Proposition 4 from our model). However, they could use margin less because they better understand the risks. It is also possible that investors who use margin may, as a result of greater involvement in investments, simply know more and score more highly on the literacy quizzes. We first introduce demographic controls. As discussed above, it’s possible that demographics are correlated with overconfidence and affect the choice to open a margin account for reasons unrelated to overconfidence. To address this concern, we introduce all of the demographic variables of Table 1, Panel C (college, nonwhite, man, married, child, age bin dummies, and portfolio size dummies). We next introduce controls for differences in preferences across investors. As observed in our univariate analysis, there are large differences in the risk attitudes, stock allocations, and trust in financial markets and regulation of margin versus cash investors. To control for these differences, we introduce the risk and trust variables of Table 1, Panel D, as controls (TrustMkt, TrustReg, bins for risk preferences, and bins for stock allocation). We present results in Table 6. Panel A presents results that use overconfidence in investment literacy, Panel B uses overconfidence in financial literacy, and Panel C uses overconfidence in performance. In column 1, we present the results of equation 5 with no controls. Consistent with Proposition 1, in all three panels, we see the measure of overconfidence is positively related to the probability of opening a margin account. For example, a one standard deviation increase of 0.364 in overconfidence in investment literacy (𝑂𝐶_𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑙𝑖𝑡) is associated with a 14.2 percentage point increase in the probability of opening a margin 19 To ensure results are not driven by the percentile transformation of self-assessment and quiz scores, appendix Tables A5 and A6 presents regression results using percentage scores on the literacy quizzes rather than percentile ranks and overconfidence measures based on the difference between the self-assessment score and percentage quiz score. We obtain qualitatively similar results.",

    "text": "account (0.364×0.390 = 14.2 ppt), which is a 38% increase relative to the baseline probability of having a margin account of 37.2%. The economic significance of the relation between financial overconfidence and the probability of having a margin account are similarly large; a one standard deviation increase of 0.388 in financial overconfidence yields a 12.5 ppt increase in the probability of opening a margin account (0.388×0.323 = 12.5 ppt) , which is a 34% increase relative to the baseline probability. In Panel C, we observe that investors who expect to beat the market have are 19.2 ppts more likely to have a margin account, which is a 52% increase relative to the baseline probability. We estimate models with demographic controls (column 2), risk and trust controls (column 3), and both (column 4). In each of these models, we observe demographic controls reduce the size of the coefficient on the key overconfidence variables, but the coefficients remain economically and statistically large. For example, in column 4 where we include all controls, the effect of a one standard deviation increase of 0.364 in overconfidence in investment literacy times the coefficient of 0.217 is associated with a 7.9 ppt increase in the probability of having a margin account, which represents a 21% increase relative to the baseline probability of 37.2%. The key overconfidence variable also has a large effect size (as measured by partial R2) relative to other independent variables in the regression of column 4. (See Table A2 for extended regression results and Table A4 for a summary of effect sizes). For example, the effect size for 𝑂𝐶_𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑙𝑖𝑡 is more than three times as large as all demographic variables. Only the indicator variables for risk as a group have a larger effect size. The fact that risk preferences explain the use of margin is consistent with workhorse asset pricing theories (e.g., the CAPM in which investors might use leverage to increase both their risk and expected return). Risk preferences and overconfidence are not mutually exclusive and both increase the probability that an investor opens a margin account. However, well-calibrated risk tolerant investors who use margin should, on average, earn more, not less, than other investors. We document that margin investors underperform. In columns 5-9, we add investment literacy (Panel A) and financial literacy (Panel B) as independent variables and estimate the regression of equation 6. We observe more knowledgeable investors are more likely to open margin accounts. The inclusion of the investment and the financial literacy variables increase the economic significance of the overconfidence variable in all specifications. 3.2.2 Margin Use among Margin Account Holders In Table 7, we analyze margin use among margin account holders.

These regressions test Proposition 1 by investigating whether more overconfident investors who have margin accounts are more likely to use margin to buy stock. In Panel A, columns 1-4, we see the relation between overconfidence in investment literacy and the use of margin among margin account holders is positive and statistically significant. In columns 5-9, we introduce investment literacy as an additional independent variable. In these regressions, investment overconfidence retains its statistical significance and the relation between investment literacy and margin use is no longer statistically significant when we introduce risk/trust variables (columns 8-9). In Panel B, columns 1-4, we see that the relation between overconfidence in financial literacy and the use of margin among margin account holders is positive and statistically significant. In columns 5-9, we introduce financial literacy as an additional independent variable in the regressions; the overconfidence variable loses statistical significance when we introduce risk/trust variables (columns 8-9). However, this lack of statistical significance can be traced to a negative relation between the use of margin and financial literacy among margin account holders (i.e., margin use seems to appeal to the less financially literate). The negative relation between literacy and margin use among margin account holders is unique to financial literacy, perhaps because investment literacy is a more relevant than financial literacy for margin investors. In Panel C, columns 1-4, we observe a positive relation between performance overconfidence and margin use among margin account holders. The relation is robust to the inclusion of demographic and risk/trust controls. The economic significance of the relation between overconfidence and the use of margin is also large. In column 4, which yields the lowest coefficient estimates on the overconfidence variables we still see economically large effects. A one standard deviation increase in overconfidence in investment knowledge (0.364) is associated with a 9.4 percentage point increase in the probability of using margin (.364×.257 = 9.4 ppt). The effect of a one standard deviation increase in financial knowledge overconfidence (0.388) is 5.6 percentage points (.388×.144 = 5.6 ppt). The effect size of the OC_invlit variable is again the second largest (second to the risk indicator variables) and is larger than the effect size for the demographic variables (see Tables A3 for extended regression results and Table A4 for effect sizes). To sum up, consistent with our first hypothesis there is strong evidence of a positive association between overconfidence and the propensity to open a margin account that is not explained by demographic or preference characteristics of investors. Among margin account holders, we generally find a positive relation between margin use and overconfidence. The relation between literacy and margin use among margin account holders is stronger when we use measures of overconfidence based on investment literacy.",

    "text": "We also generally find evidence that investors with higher levels of investment or financial literacy are more likely to open a margin account. However, among margin account holders the use of margin is only positively related to investment literacy. We next analyze the investment behavior of margin account holders and those who use margin to assess whether margin users are skilled or overconfident investors. 4 Overconfidence and Margin Trading: Empirical Evidence from Broker Data 4.1 Univariate Results We begin by presenting univariate statistics on the variables from the broker dataset conditional on investors with margin versus cash accounts. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 8, columns 1-6. In Panel A, we analyze trading activity. Recall that overconfidence leads to more margin use and more trading (Propositions 2 and 3), but better information has the same effects (Propositions 4 and 5). We indeed observe that margin investors trade more and trade more speculatively20 than investors with cash accounts. For example, the annual turnover of margin investors is 111.6% (9.3%×12), 28.8 percentage points higher than the annual turnover of cash investors (82.8% = 6.9%×12). About 8.8% of margin investors’ trades are speculative compared to about 5.4% of cash investors’ trades. In both cases, the differences in means are statistically significant (p<.01). Consistent with Heimer and Imas (2020), we find margin investors are more likely to sell winners rather than losers. Finally, we see that margin investors tend to have larger investment portfolios. In columns 7-12, we analyze the difference in trading behavior of those with margin experience and margin account holders without margin experience (i.e., the conditional effect of margin experience among margin account holders). In all cases, we observe qualitatively similar differences between those with margin experience and those without. Investors with margin experience trade more, trade more speculatively, are more likely to sell winners, and tend to have larger portfolios than margin account holders without margin experience. To determine whether the increased trading of margin traders is more likely traced to overconfidence (Proposition 3) or better information (Proposition 5), we analyze the returns from trading. In Panel B, columns 1-6, we observe both margin and cash investors have poor trading ability as the returns following buys are negative and the returns following sells are positive at all horizons that we analyze.21 Consistent with the joint hypothesis that margin traders are more overconfident and that overconfidence decreases the 20 Note that in our formal model, all trading is speculative, that is, motivated by anticipated returns, not by liquidity needs, rebalancing, or taxes. 21 Readers might notice the sample sizes are smaller in Panel B. This is because we only require one trade for each investor in our sample. Some investors will have only buys or only sells.",

However, margin investors have significantly worse security selection following sales. At a 4-day horizon (0,3), returns following sales by margin investors are 33.4 bps more positive than returns following sales by cash investors (𝑝 < .01). The results are similar at the longer horizons that we analyze. In columns 7-12, we observe similar patterns when we compare the stock selection ability of those with margin experience and those without though the magnitudes of the differences are much larger. As we will see in subsequent analyses, these differences remain robust to the introduction of numerous investor controls and the construction of calendar-time portfolio. These patterns support our conjecture that overconfidence leads to greater use of margin, more speculative trading, and lower profits. While it is also possible that better information at times leads to increased use of margin, these patterns do not provide support for the belief that margin investors are better informed.22 In Panel C, columns 1-6, we present demographic information on margin and cash investors. Sample sizes drop because we do not have demographic information on all investors. Nonetheless, the patterns in demographics are broadly consistent with those from the survey data. Margin investors are more likely to be younger single men without kids than cash investors. Margin investors also self-report higher levels of investment knowledge and investment experience echoing the results of the self-reported financial literacy and investment literacy from the investor survey. Margin investors tend to have higher incomes and wealth, but these differences are more modest than the difference that we observe in portfolio size in Panel A. In columns 7-12, we observe very similar patterns in the differences we observe between those with margin experience versus those without (conditional on being a margin account holder). 4.2 Turnover, Speculative Trading, and the Disposition Effect We further test Propositions 2 and 5 by estimating the following regression: 𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟 = 𝑏 +𝑏 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑐𝑐+𝑏 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑝+𝑋Γ+𝑒.

The results of this regression are presented in Table 9, columns 1-2. In column 1, we present a regression without control variables.

Margin investors with no margin experience (i.e., 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑐𝑐 = 1,𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑝 = 0) have monthly turnover that is 0.91 ppts greater than cash investors (𝑝 < .001); margin investors with margin experience (i.e., 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑐𝑐 = 1, 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑝 = 1) have turnover rates that are more than double those of cash or margin investors (𝑝 < .001). Importantly, when we introduce demographic controls, the estimated coefficient estimates are largely unaffected.23 In columns 3-4, we observe similar patterns for speculative turnover when we estimate the regression of equation 9 but replace the dependent variable with 𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑐_𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑒. In columns 5-6, we observe similar patterns for the disposition effect when we use 𝑃𝐺𝑅𝑡𝑜𝑃𝐿𝑅 as the dependent variable in the regression. In summary, margin investors and particularly those with experience trading on margin trade more frequently and more speculatively than cash investors. These conclusions are unaffected by the introduction of investor controls. These general patterns are consistent with the idea that either overconfidence and/or better information leads to greater margin use and more trading. We also find that margin investors are more likely to sell winners rather than losers relative to cash investors, which can lead to higher capital gains taxes. To determine whether the high levels of trading by margin investors stems from their superior information or overconfidence, we analyze trade performance. In theory, overconfident investors will trade more and have lower profits (Propositions 2 and 3); better-informed investors will trade more and have higher profits (Propositions 5 and 6). In the next two sections, we conduct two additional analyses to establish the empirical fact that margin traders have poor trade performance and conclude that for this group of investors overconfidence likely leads to the use or margin and poor trade performance. 4.3 Multivariate Analysis: Trade Performance We estimate regressions that are similar in form to that of equation 9 but we use investor returns subsequent to a buy (or sell) as the dependent variable in the regression. In these regressions, the unit of observation is investor-trade and we cluster standard errors by the date of trade to address cross-sectional dependence in returns for trades executed on the same day. We analyze performance at horizons of 4, 6, and 21 days. (We also analyze longer horizons and do not find evidence that the poor performance at these short horizons is reversed. See appendix Figure A1.) The results of this analysis are presented in Table 10. In Panel A, column 1, we see that cash investors lose about 42.4 bps in the four days after buying a stock. Margin investors do somewhat better, but only if they have no margin experience and the improvement is marginally significant (𝑝 < .10) and leaves them 23 In untabulated regressions, we drop investors with missing demographic information (about half of the sample) and find quantitatively similar results.",

Investors with margin experience have poor security selection, but it is not materially different from the poor security selection of cash investors. These results are similar when we introduce investor controls in column 2 or analyze longer horizons (columns 3-6). Margin investors have significantly worse performance when we analyze their selling activity in Panel B. In column 1, we see that cash investors have poor security selection ability as the returns after sale are 72.2 bps. Investors with margin accounts but no margin experience have statistically worse sales timing as their sales earn 79.7 bps (72.2 + 7.5) after that trade date. Investors with margin experience have particularly bad sales timing as their sales earn 115.6 bps after the trade date (72.2 + 7.5 + 35.9). These conclusions are qualitatively similar when we introduce investor controls (column 2) or analyze longer horizons (columns 3-6). In summary, margin investors have bad security selection as the mean returns after buys are negative and returns after sells are positive. Margin investors, particularly those with margin experience, have particularly bad sales timing relative to cash investors. We do not observe consistent differences in the purchase timing of margin and cash investors. Overall, we interpret the poor performance of margin investors as evidence consistent with our third hypothesis: overconfident margin traders will perform worse than other investors. 4.4 Calendar-Time Portfolios based on Trades To more finely control for the factor exposure of stocks bought and sold by cash versus margin investors and to address concerns regarding cross-sectional dependence in the prior regression analyses, we construct calendar-time portfolios. Consider the trades of cash investors. We create a portfolio that mimics the buys of cash investors and holds the purchased stocks for three days. This analysis yields a time-series of daily returns on the buy-mimicking portfolio. We perform a similar analysis for margin investors with no margin experience and margin investors with margin experience. These three portfolios allow us to analyze the differences in the daily returns earned on the buy-mimicking portfolios of the three investor groups (cash investors, margin account without margin experience, margin account with margin experience). We measure the daily abnormal return on these portfolios by estimating the following factor regressions: 𝑅 −𝑅 = 𝛼+𝛽(𝑅 −𝑅 )+𝑠𝑆𝑀𝐵 +ℎ𝐻𝑀𝐿 +𝑟𝑅𝑀𝑊 +𝑐𝐶𝑀𝐴 +𝑤𝑊𝑀𝐿 +𝑒 , (10) 𝑝𝑡 𝑓𝑡 𝑚𝑡 𝑓𝑡 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡 𝑡 𝑝𝑡 where 𝑅 is the return on the buy-mimicking portfolio, 𝑅 is the riskfree rate, and 𝑅 is the return on the 𝑝𝑡 𝑓𝑡 𝑚𝑡 value-weighted market portfolio. The additional factors are long-short portfolios constructed to capture exposure to firm size (𝑆𝑀𝐵), value versus growth (𝐻𝑀𝐿), profitability (𝑅𝑀𝑊), investment (𝐶𝑀𝐴), and momentum (𝑊𝑀𝐿) as discussed in Fama and French (2015). The independent variables are taken from Ken French’s online data library.",

We present daily percentage abnormal returns that use only the market excess return as an independent variable (CAPM alpha) and daily percentage abnormal returns based on the regression of equation 10 (FF5+Mom alpha). Focus first on Panel A, which presents results for a 4-day horizon. In columns 1-2, we see that the buy-mimicking portfolio for cash investors earns a -9.05 or -6.10 bps per day, an economically large shortfall that is statistically significant. In columns 3-4, we observe the sell-mimicking portfolio for cash investors earns 17.5 or 18.6 bps per day or an even bigger performance penalty than buys. In columns 5-6, we see the long-short portfolio (long the buy-mimicking portfolio and short the sell-mimicking portfolio) earns -26.5 or -24.7 bps per day. In summary, cash investors have dismal security selection ability and factor exposures do little to change this conclusion. Margin investors without experience and margin investors with margin experience also have dismal security selection ability. However, the margin investors with margin experience are particularly bad. The last six rows of Panel A test for pairwise differences in the portfolio returns. Focus on columns 5-6, the long-short portfolios that summarize the evidence from the buy-mimicking and sell-mimicking portfolios. We observe that cash investors and margin investors without experience have very similar return experiences. However, margin investors with margin experience have reliably lower returns than cash investors or margin investors without margin experience. For example, the long-short portfolio that mimics the trades of margin investors with margin experience earns 10 bps less than that earned by cash investors or margin investors without margin experience. In Panels B and C, we present results for the longer holding periods of 6 and 21 days. The daily alphas predictably decline as we consider longer holding periods. This occurs because the event-time returns for trades are quite similar at the different holding periods (see the univariate statistics of Table 8), which means the return shortfall per day is large at short horizons and smaller at longer horizons. Nonetheless, the general patterns are quite similar in that margin investors with margin experience have the most dismal security selection of the three groups. Overall this evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that margin investors are overconfidence about their ability and hurt their performance through active trading. 5 Alternative Explanations for our Results 5.1 Entertainment We argue that overconfidence leads retail investors to use margin, to trade excessively, and to trade to their financial detriment. An alternative explanation for why retail investors actively engage in wealth reducing trades is that they finding trading entertaining, perhaps because they view it as an alternative form of gambling (Barber, Lee, Liu, & Odean, 2008; Dorn and Sengmueller, 2009; Dorn, Dorn, and Sengmueller,",

    "text": "2015; Gao and Lin, 2015). Of course, overconfidence and entertainment are not mutually exclusive; indeed, it is probably more entertaining to trade if one is overconfident about one’s prospects for success. While we do not rule out entertainment as a partial driver of margin trading, there are three reasons why we don’t believe that it can replace overconfidence in explaining retail investor margin trading. First, entertainment does not explain why investors who are overconfident about their investment and financial knowledge are more likely to use margin. Second, entertainment—unlike overconfidence—does not explain why investors who use margin underperform other investors.24 Third, if investors trade on margin for entertainment, knowing that doing so will likely reduce their wealth (i.e., they are not overconfident), then we might expect that the investors most likely to trade on margin would be those for whom the risks were lower relative to their total wealth. This is not the case. A subsample of the investors at the large discount brokerage self-report their total wealth. When we separately analyze the trading of investors whose portfolio size to wealth ratio is above the median of 17.7%, we find they are more, not less, likely to have margin experience. As reported in appendix Table A7, 61.1% of investors with margin experience have portfolio to wealth ratios above the median. Furthermore, margin experience investors with portfolio to wealth ratios above the median demonstrate similar tendencies to trade actively, trade speculatively, and exhibit a disposition effect as do margin experience investors with portfolio to wealth ratios below the median (appendix Table A8) and earn similarly poor returns from trading (appendix Table A9). 5.2 Skewness and Margin In theory when investors have preferences described by cumulative prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1992), they will prefer stocks with positive skewness and a stock’s own skewness will be negatively related to expected returns (Barberis and Huang, 2008). Consistent with this theory, individual investors overweight lottery-like stocks (Kumar, 2009; Mitton and Vorkink, 2007) and lottery-like stocks earn low returns (Bali, Cakici, & Whitelaw, 2011; Boyer, Mitton, & Vorkink, 2010). We also find that individual investors prefer stocks with high expected skewness (see Table A11) and stocks with high expected skewness earn poor returns during our sample period (see Table A10). Though there is strong evidence that investors prefer stocks with positively skewed returns, this preference cannot explain why investors use margin. Consider a portfolio with an expected return 𝑅, return standard deviation 𝜎, and return skewness 𝛾. An investment weight of 𝑎 in the portfolio will yield an expected return, standard deviation, and skewness of 𝑎𝑅, 𝑎𝜎, and 𝛾 (respectively). Thus, an investor who 24 An alternative explanation for why investors who use margin underperform is that great risk and the use of leverage can lead to poorer decision making (Ariely, Gneezy, Lowenstein, & Mazar 2009; Heimer and Imas 2020).",

    "text": "borrows to invest in the portfolio will earn a higher and more volatile return (𝑎𝑅 and 𝑎𝜎, a>1). However, leverage has no effect on the skewness of the levered investment, which will remain 𝛾. Investors preference for skewness also does not predict that those who use margin will be more overconfident than other investors, which is what we find in the survey data we analyze. Skewness preferences also do not predict that margin investors will trade more than cash investors, which is what we find in the brokerage data. Do skewness preferences explain the underperformance of margin investors? This would be possible if margin investors have stronger skewness preferences than cash investors and stocks with positive skewness earn poor returns. While margin investors have stronger skewness preferences than cash investors, the differences are economically small. For example, 5.0% of margin investors purchases are among the top quintile of expected skewness stocks compare to 4.9% for cash investors (see Table A11). As one last check that our performance results are not driven by different skewness preferences, we reestimate the regression of equation 9 summarized in Table 10 but include a dummy variable for whether the stock purchased (or sold) is a stock in the top quintile of expected skewness. The skewness indicator variable absorbs any performance shortfall that can be traced to the purchase (or sale) of stocks with skewness preferences. Thus, the key independent variables (marginacc and marginexp) represent the performance difference between margin and cash investors after controlling for their potentially differing appetite for skewness. This modified regression yields results that are very similar to our main results (see Table A12). 5.3 Risk and Margin As discussed previously, standard asset pricing models like the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) would predict that investors with higher levels of risk tolerance might borrow money to increase the risk and return of their portfolio. Consistent with this idea, we find that investors with higher levels of risk tolerance are more likely to have a margin account or to use margin (see Table 5, Panel C). While risk preferences certainly affect the willingness to use margin, risk preferences alone cannot explain why margin users speculate more and perform worse than cash investors. One might conjecture that margin investors have nonstandard preferences and prefer more risk to less risk for the same level of expected return. Again, risk-seeking preferences like this would lead to greater use of margin but do not predict that investors who are risk seeking would trade more and perform worse than other investors. The risk-seeking investor can increase portfolio risk by borrowing to buy-and-hold a single volatile stock. And non-standard preferences should not cause investors to buy stocks with lower returns unless nonstandard preferences extend to preferring less to more).",

    "text": "In a recent working paper, Heimer and Imas (2020) argue leverage-constrained traders have an increased willingness to realize losses and a smaller disposition effect. The basic idea is investors have disutility from realizing losses and this disutility discourages investors from acting on attractive purchase opportunities if the investor must sell a loser to purchase the stock. Leverage relaxes this constraint since the investor can buy the stock without experiencing the disutility associated with the sale of a loser. Consistent with this idea, we find that investors who use margin have a greater disposition effect. The greater disposition effect of margin investors does not explain why investors who use margin have greater overconfidence, as we document in survey data. It’s possible—even likely—that the disposition effect and investor overconfidence are correlated, which would make it empirically challenging to disentangle whether changes in trading and margin use can be traced to the disposition effect or overconfidence. Our point is simple: the presence of disposition effect preferences alone does not explain our empirical findings that margin investors appear to be more overconfident than other investors. Can the underperformance of margin investors be traced to their greater tendency to sell winners and hold on to losers? This would be possible if winners tend to earn strong returns, which would yield poor returns on the sales timing of investors who suffer from a disposition effect. Absent this momentum effect in stock returns, there is no strong reason to assume investors with a greater disutility from selling losers will underperform other investors in the stocks they buy.25 However, there was a momentum effect in stock returns during the 1991-1996 sample period; the average return on the momentum factor in our multifactor model used to estimate the alphas of the calendar-time portfolios is 79 bps per month. The fact that we observe similar alphas when we use the CAPM and a multifactor model that includes momentum controls suggests the anti-momentum nature of the disposition effect is unlikely to be the main factor generating return differences between margin and cash investors. As a final check, we re-estimate the regression of equation 10 summarized in Table 10 but include a dummy variable for whether the investor has a disposition effect in our sample period (i.e., the ratio of 𝑃𝐺𝑅/𝑃𝐿𝑅 for the investor is greater than one during the sample period). This disposition effect indicator variable absorbs any shortfall that can be traced to the investors’ preference to sell winners rather than losers. Thus, the key independent variables (𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑐𝑐 and 𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑥𝑝) represent the performance difference between margin and cash investors after controlling for their potentially differing disutility for selling losers. This modified regression yields return differences between cash and margin investors that are very similar to those reported in Table 10 (see Table A13). Though disposition effect investors suffer 25 Investors with disutility from selling losers, if otherwise well-calibrated, would require a more attractive purchase opportunity when funding the purchase with the sale of a loser than an investor who does not have the disutility from selling losers. This line of reasoning suggests that investors with a greater disposition effect will earn better returns on the stocks they buy if they are well-calibrated in their assessment of the stock’s future prospects.",

Analyzing survey data of 1,601 retail investors with non-retirement accounts, we find that investors who are more overconfident about their investment knowledge, their financial knowledge, and their future returns relative to the market are more likely to have margin accounts and, conditional on having a margin account, are more likely to have traded on margin. Investors with margin accounts are more overconfident than other investors and those who have margin trading experience are more overconfident than investors who have margin accounts but have not traded on margin. Our model also predicts that traders with below average information who use margin will engage in more active, speculative trading than those who do not use margin and will, on average, earn lower profits. To test this hypothesis, we examine the trading records for over 41,000 investors with non-retirement accounts at a large discount brokerage. We find that investors with margin accounts trade more actively, more speculatively, and less profitably than those with cash accounts and that among investors who have margin accounts, those with experience trading on margin trade more actively, more speculatively, and less profitably. In sum, our evidence indicates that overconfidence—not better information—is a primary motivation for retail investors to trade, to their detriment, on margin. More generally, our analysis suggests overconfidence and leverage can be a dangerous mix.",

Returns from Trading for Cash versus Margin Investors controlling for Stock Skewness • Table A13. Returns from Trading for Cash versus Margin Investors controlling for Investor Disposition Effect Model of Overconfidence and Leveraged Investment In this section, we develop a model in which investors exhibit possible overconfidence in their understanding of investments and analyze their trading performance as well as their propen- sity to use margin or leverage. Overconfidence has become a well-established psychological bias in models of financial markets. Our model takes the standard setup of Odean (1998) and others, which captures overconfidence through overestimation of the precision of private information.1 Model Setup: Our theory is a static CARA normal model of trade. There is a riskless asset with zero net return. There is one risky asset with normally-distributed payo↵ of v and zero supply. The distribution of v is given by: v N(µ ,1/\u0000 ) e (1) 0 0 ⇠ e The assets are exchanged in one round of trading at time t = 1, and payo↵s are con- e sumed only at t = 2. There are N investors of two di↵erent types m✏ H.L (high and low { } information precision). We analyze the limit economy where N such that each investor ! 1 correctly assumes that his own demand does not a↵ect prices. At t = 0, each trader has an endowment of f of the riskless asset and of x = 0 of the risky asset. Thus, each traders 0 0 wealth at t = 0 is W = f . 0 0 Prior to trading at t = 1, each trader, j, receives one of two private signals about the risky asset payo↵ depending on whether the investor is of type H or L: s = v +\" (2) j m where \" has the objective distribution \" N(0,1/\u0000 ) and \u0000 > \u0000 (i.e., type H traders m em e e m H L ⇠ have a higher precision signal than type L). We assume \" and \" to be independent. H L Traeders di↵er not only in the precisioneof their signals but also in their beliefs about those precisions. Traders believe the distribution of their signal to be \" N(0,(\u0000 \u0000 ) 1). We m m m \u0000 ⇠ refer to \u0000 as “confidence” in information. This parameter represents bias in the assessed m accuracy of private information about the mean asset payo↵. As deiscussed in Odean (1998), the di↵ering precision of private signals in this model can alternatively be interpreted as di↵ering abilities to interpret public information. The value of \u0000 = 1 represents rational m assessment of information accuracy; the values of \u0000 > 1 and \u0000 < 1 represent overconfi- m m dence and underconfidence in information, respectively. We focus on the case in which type L investors are systematically moderately overconfident, i.e., \u0000 > 1 and \u0000 does not deviate L L 1Other models include Kyle and Wang (1997), Odean (1998), Daniel, Hirshleifer, and Subrahmanyam (1998, 2001), Hirshleifer and Luo (2001), and Hong, Scheinkman, and Xiong (2006) 1",

Demand We assume that agents make inferences about the mean risky asset payo↵ based upon their signalsanddonotimputeadditionalinformationbasedontheasset’sprice. Thisassumption is common in the behavioral asset-pricing literature and is motivated by cognitive limitations on the part of individual investors.2 Therefore, risky asset demand is based on the payo↵ distribution conditional on the agent’s signal only. To compute an agent’s demand in our CARA-normal setup, we must first specify the agent’s perceived mean and variance of the asset payo↵ conditional on the private signal. The subjective conditional mean payo↵ of agent j is given as follows (where E is the agent j0 j’s subjective expectation): 1 \u0000 0 \u0000 \u0000 0 \u0000 m \u0000 m µ = E [v s ] = µ + 1+ (s µ) = µ + s (3) 0j j0 | j 0 \u0000 \u0000 j \u0000 \u0000 +\u0000 \u0000 0 \u0000 +\u0000 \u0000 j ✓ m m◆ 0 m m 0 m m This conditional mean is a weighted average of the agent’s prior mean payo↵ and the signal. ee e e The weights are determined by the subjective precision of this signal relative to the prior precision of the mean payo↵. In particular, higher subjective precision of information results in greater weight on the signal. The subjective conditional variance of the payo↵ is given as follows: 2 1/\u0000 = E [(v µ )2 s ] = E [ \u00000 (v µ ) \u0000m\u0000m \" ] = 0j j0 \u0000 0j | j 0 \u00000+\u0000m\u0000m \u0000 0 \u0000 \u00000+\u0000m\u0000m m (4) 2 2 = \u00000 1 + \u0000m n\u0000ˆ m 1 = (\u0000 +\u0000 \u0000 ) 1 o \u00000+e\u0000m\u0000m \u0000e0 \u00000+\u0000m\u0000m \u0000m\u0000em 0 m m \u0000 e ⇣ ⌘ ⇣ ⌘ This is a standard result that posterior precision equals the precision of the prior plus signal precision.

The variance of dollar demand is approximately equal to µ times the variance of share demand, i.e.: 0 var(P x (s ,P )) µ2var(x (s ,P )) (21) 1⇤ ⇤1,j j 1⇤ ⇡ 0 ⇤1,j j 1⇤ Since the variance of share demand is increasing in \u0000 by proposition 1, the probability e L e of margin use in equation 20 also increases in \u0000 . By the same argument, proposition 1 also L implies that the probability of margin use increases in \u0000 for \u0000 2. QED. L L  3In this context, wealth (W ) represents the amount potentially allocated to investment accounts such 0 that the investor will borrow if they seek to invest more than this amount. This “wealth” will be less than household net worth in general as certain assets may be illiquid or earmarked for other accounts and purposes. 5",

Households with cash accounts are excluded. The key independent variables are Overconfidence in Investment Literacy (Panel A), Financial Literacy (Panel B), and Performance (Panel C). Overconfidence in investment literacy is the difference between the percentile rank on a person's self-assessment of investment knowledge (invself_p) less the percentile rank on a person's score on a ten question financial literacy quiz (invlit_p). Overconfidence in financial literacy is the difference between the percentile rank on a person's self-assessment of financial knowledge (finself_p) less the percentile rank on a person's score on a six question financial literacy quiz (finlit_p). Panel D lists control variables. Demographic controls include dummy variables for college education, nonwhite, gender, marital status, presence of children, age bins (<35, 35-54, >54), portolio size bins (<$50k, $50-$250k, >$250k). Preference controls include dummy variables for willingness to take risks (none, average, above average, high), stock allocation in portfolio (none, <=50%, >50%), trust in markets (10 point Likert scale), and trust in regulation (10 point Likert scale).",
