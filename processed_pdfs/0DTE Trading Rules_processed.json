While plenty of internet sites offer free and paid recipes on making money on options markets and explaining when and how a particular strategy should work, little is knownaboutthe performanceof naked 0DTEcall andputoptions and various strategies combining several call and put positions. We aim to fill the information gap and provide simple yet detailed performance statistics for naked 0DTE options on the S&P500 market index and for several popular strategies from these options. The first part of the analysis covers unconditional static trading rules, in which positions are taken every day at some fixed time point during the day (we use 10:00 in the main analysis and also include data and performance numbers for 16:00 of the previous day and 13:00 and 15:00 of the current day in the additional figures and data files) and held until expiry of all options at 16:00. The second part makes the first attempt to explore conditional trading rules, looking for variables that can explain and predict the performance of selected strategies. The sample period is from 09/2016 to January 11, 2024, i.e., starting from the month with at least three weekly expiration days. The data will be regularly updated to more recent periods. For the analysis, at a given point in time on each day, we interpolate prices of available 0DTE options with moneyness (defined as strike to underlying level ratio) between 0.98 and 1.02 (e.g., 3920 to 4080 for the SPX level of 4000) to fill in the available range with step 0.001 (i.e., a 4-dollar step for the SPX of 4000), and then use these standardized options to compute performance statistics for standalone positions and selected option strategies. As such option strategies, we use an at-the-money (ATM) straddle and strangles with several moneyness levels, 1 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4641356",

Figure A1 provides their sample payoff profiles. We also document the realized variance risk premium, computed as the implied variance of SPX options until settlement time minus realized variance for the same period. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 analyzes the average variance risk premiums, prices, and returns of individual options and option-based strategies. Section 3 (unfinished so far) attempts to figure out conditional trading rules. Section ?? will analyze dynamic trading rules. Section 4 discusses input data and its processing. Section 5 briefly overviews relevant academic literature. Section 6 concludes. Appendix A contains additional materials such as tables and figures for variations in the analysis. 2 Unconditional Static Trading Rules Suppose we establish an options position daily without considering any possible conditioning variables (a.k.a. managing parameters) defining when and how many contracts to open. In that case, we pursue an unconditional and static trading strategy. We calculate holding period returns and profits and loss (PNL) to expiry for the considered options and their combinations and then present the statistics for these returns. 2.1 Variance Risk Premium Over the whole sample period from 09/2016 to January 11, 2024, the 0DTEs deliver a positive and statistically significant variance risk premium, i.e., their implied variance is significantly higher than the realized variance to expiry, see Figure 1, Panel B. To trade variance, we need to sell options with different moneyness levels, with proportions depending on the method used to compute the variance.

    "text": "the risk-neutral variance of log returns, weighting prices of out-the-money options according to the formula in equation 4. Essentially, the variance swap rate is a weighted sum of time values of the out-the-money call and put options, with weights proportional to the reciprocal of the moneyness (for both stock price and strikes normalized by stock price) and empirically adding up to a number between one and two. For 0DTEs, the variance swap rate to expiration is shown in Figure 1, Panel A. The realized variance risk premium can be thought of as the remaining time value from selling a portfolio of OTM options after paying off the options that were exercised. Indeed, the higher the realized variance, the further away from the ATM point the final price realization can be, and the more we need to pay out on exercised options. In the limiting case of the zero realized variance, the underlying price does not change, and we keep all the collected time values. The numbers in Panel B of Figure 1 indicate that selling 0DTE variance can, on average, be profitable; however, because the time values of the OTM options with just hours to expiry are minimal (see Figure 2), the variance swap rates are also very low, and even having realized variance of zero during the day and collecting two times average time value of all the OTM calls and puts would earn us only ≈ 0.20% of the underlying price. Thus, the magnitude of the variance risk premium is tiny due to the very short period to expiry, and realistic transaction costs would hardly make it tradable for retail investors.

Individual call and put option returns are highly volatile, especially out-the-money ones, and mean returns are typically not significantly different from zero. However, statistical inference in this case can be flawed due to skewed dis- tributions of realized returns. Computing rather option realized PNL relative to the underlying price produces a less asymmetric (i.e., a more normal) distribution and shows that at- and out- the-money calls and all puts are losing money on average, and out-the-money option realized PNL is typically more compact in terms of the distribution. Selling slightly OTM calls and puts delivers in up to 75 percent of observations positive returns; for more ITM options, the realized PNL is far more volatile, with the difference between 75th and 25th percentile of 0.7-0.8% of underlying price. 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4641356",

Panels on the left show realized return in % relative to option mid-price. Panels on the right show the realized profit per one unit of underlying relative to underlying price (payoff −mid price)/underlying price×100%. Bars show mean values, and each bar is accompanied by median, 25th, and 75th percentiles. X-axis labels show the moneyness of the analyzed options. The sample period is from 09/2016 to January 11, 2024. The options performance from 16:00 on previous day and 13:00 and 15:00 on the current day to expiry is shown in Figures A2, A3 and A4.

Clearly, investment in any of the strategies is far from being risk- free, and while visually the profit- vs. loss-making regimes are have a rather long duration (or half-lifeasina mean-revertingprocess?), itisnotclearwhether suchregimescanbesuccessfully identified a priori. In any case, conditioning trading decisions on the current environment and making trading rules dynamic, i.e., adjusting complete combos or individual options positions during the day, can be crucial in improving the performance of 0DTE trading, and we explore one of such directions next. 3 Conditional Trading Rules The next enhancement of trading rules is conditioning position opening and potentially sizing decisions on a set of variables that can predict the performance of option strategies.1 Note that naked options and all considered strategies are not delta-hedged and are held to expiry, so the primary drivers of the PNL are the initial cost and the realized move of the underlying from position opening to expiry. Costs are directly observable and are correlated with the expected realized variance; however, prediction of the signed magnitude of the realized daily return of the underlying market index is extremely hard, if not impossible, under most circumstances.2 Even though the long-term average of daily market returns shall be positive due to the positive equity risk premium, it may take an extremely long series of realizations for thisexpectationtocometrue(e.g., Merton1980).

    "text": "Recall that the idea of constructing option strategies is to get a relatively concentrated exposure to particular moments of return distribution while eliminating (fully or partially) the effects of other moments. From the description of the strategies in Section 2.3 we can expect the best predictability for the combos exploiting variance risk premium (strangles/ straddles) and skewness risk premium (risk reversals). Call and put spreads load strongly on directional exposure,andthoughtheybenefitfromthevarianceandasymmetryofreturns,thepredictability results are likely to be distorted. Overall, the price of a strategy aggregates implied costs of risks (which we interpret broadly to include opportunities) that we are exposed to by taking a position in a strategy. A strategy’s payoff comes from realizing these risks, and the PNL (or return) reflects the ex-post or realized risk premiums. While there are several alternative ways to describe a financial instrument’s risks, it is common to use moments of underlying return distribution or their ad hoc proxies. The primary risk comes from the variance, and we compute implied and realized variances to describe its price (fixed side of a variance swap) and realization (floating side of a variance swap) and to define an ex-post variance risk premium (as a payoff to a short variance swap). Asymmetry of the distribution is equally important for asymmetric instruments like options, and depending on the particular strategy, we may emphasize up or down semivariances and skewness, using their implied and realized values and the risk premiums as the difference thereof.3 ToestablishhowthePNLofeachstrategydependsonrealizedpremiumsforparticularrisks, decomposing the effects into implied and realized values, and analyze the magnitudes of effects, we run a series of regressions of realized PNL for the option strategies on implied and realized return moments and their risk premiums, separately for each strategy type, but pooling several moneyness combinations into one model. Because changing parameters of a structure changes itssensitivitytotheimpliedandrealizeddistributions, weincludeintheregressionscombofixed 3We define these variables formally in Section 4; in general, we define risk premiums as payoffs on short (i.e., pay floating, receive fixed) swaps on a particular moment of the return distribution. 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4641356",

    "text": "Panel A in Table 2 delivers the first set of surprising results: realized returns of most strate- gies barely depend on the realized variance, and even though the RV coefficient is significant for several strategies, the R2s are extremely low, with the maximum of 4.5% for put ratio spreads. For call and put spreads, the coefficients have opposite signs, possibly explained by the asym- metric volatility effect: index and its variance are typically negatively correlated, and because these spreads are directional, higher variance also typically means higher profit realization for put spreads, and lower variance – higher profit for call spreads. Adding realized skewness in Panel B considerably improves the regression fit for asymmetric instruments like risk reversals and simple call and put spreads. Ratio spreads also look better, but at some point, they start suffering from large directional moves of the underlying (captured by skewness), and the RS effect gets weaker. Adding proxy for the strategy cost in the form of implied variance and skew- ness in Panels C, and D have a more minor relative effect in terms of the explained variability; however, it still adds 2 to 7 percentage points to the R2, boosting it especially strongly for strangles (from 1.6% in Panel A to 6.3% in C), call and put spreads (from 19% to 24.2% and from 19.8% to 27.4% in Panels B and C, respectively), and call ratio spreads (from 2.8% to 9.1% in Panels B and C, respectively). Except for the strangles, our PNLs depend mainly on the realized skewness capturing the directionalmoveoftheunderlying.

Appendix Table A6 documenting the same relationships in the last trading hour shows an even more extreme picture, where the same regression specifications typically deliver much higher R2’s, and again the most important explanatory variable is the realized skewness. It can be obvious after we see the analysis, but it confirms our fear that the final payoff of short-term option strategies is very hard to predict. 14 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4641356",

(6) t t t t t For individual options with today’s expiration, observed at a given point in time during the day (e.g., 10:00 ET), we first compute their moneyness (defined as strike to underlying price ratio) and then select all options within moneyness bounds [0.98,1.02], i.e., ±2% from the ATM level. For each of these options, we express the mid-price and bid-ask spread in terms of the underlyingprice(i.e., computetheratioofavariableandunderlyingprice), andtheninterpolate mainvariablesofinterest(mid-price,bid-askspread,impliedvolatility,andGreeks)asafunction of moneyness with step 0.00125, for calls and puts separately.7 For each interpolated option, we compute the payoff:    (M −S T /S t )+ if Type = Call, Payoff (M,Type) = (7) t   (S T /S t −M)+ if Type = Put, where M is the moneyness level for a given option, and S /S is the total return on the index T t S from time t to expiry T =16:00. We also compute for each option its intrinsic value as the payoff from an immediate exercise and the time value as the difference between the mid-price and intrinsic value. For options that get a negative time value (due to using mid-price instead of the effective or true price), we set the time value to zero and the intrinsic value to the mid-price.

Dim, Eraker, and Vilkov (2023) show that high open interest gamma in 0DTE options is not contributing to the propagation of past volatility (precisely, last day and overnight volatilities) and that the current state of liquidity in underlying markets absorbs any potential delta-hedging flows from option markets without generating abnormal volume patterns. Manypapersstudiedthefactorstructureofoptionsreturnsandexpectedreturnspredictabil- ity. Forexample,Bu¨chnerandKelly2022analyzedelta-hedgedSPXoptionsreturnsusingIPCA (Kelly, Pruitt, and Su 2017) and find that they can be well modeled by only a few factors. In contrast to long-term delta-hedged returns, which depend mainly on realized variance risk pre- miums, we study unhedged ultra-short returns on option strategies. 6 Conclusion Our empirical study of zero-days to expiry (0DTE) options trading strategies on the S&P 500 index, spanning from 09/2016 to January 11, 2024, provides valuable insights into this dynamic tradingsector. Thesurgein0DTEoptionstrading, mainlydrivenbyeasyaccesstouser-friendly brokerage platforms and the attraction of low option premiums, has produced a diverse range of outcomes in terms of profitability. Our analysis has uncovered several key findings. First, 0DTE options offer a substantial variance risk premium, with implied variance consistently higher than realized variance until settlement. However, the success of various strategies is not guaranteed. In the initial part of our analysis, we considered unconditional static trading rules, revealing high volatility and skewed returns in individual 0DTE options held to expiry.8 Some tactics, such as buying deep 8Wecallsuchrulesunconditionalandstaticbecausewedonotconditionourdecisionaboutthedirectionand size of the position on any environmental variables and do not adjust the positions during the day to fix profits, limit losses, or change the exposure profile.

Nevertheless, the median profit and loss (PNL) for most popular strategies tend to be negative, with a wide distribution of potential outcomes. Notably, the risk reversal strategy consistently yields positive PNL, though the magnitude is modest. Furthermore,ourstudyhighlightsthechallengesofapplyingunconditionalandstatictrading rules in 0DTE SPX options. These strategies often lead to highly volatile realized PNL and a minimal variance risk premium due to the short time to expiry. Additionally, the upward trend of the S&P 500 index during our study’s timeline may have influenced some of the observed outcomes. Our research underscores that while specific 0DTE unconditional static trading rules can yield profitability, this domain is inherently risky and unpredictable. Traders should be mindful of the volatility and mixed success rates associated with various strategies, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the 0DTE options market. These insights provide valuable guidance to market participants navigating this complex and evolving trading landscape. 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4641356",

    "text": "B Conditional Trading Rules B.1 Failed Approaches Before we get to a systematic analysis, we start from a quick description of failures. Clustering of strategy PNL/ Classification. The first approach we tried was a combina- tion of clustering of PNL of a particular strategy in random test samples and classification algo- rithms aiming to predict a particular cluster. We performed clustering either using algorithms like KMeans or applying a manual split into positives and negatives, terciles, quartiles, etc. In the second step we started from a simple Logictic regression (for a binary split), the used forest- based algorithms (boosted trees XGBClassifier, and random forest RandomForestClassifier) toclassifydataintoclusters, andalsoamulti-layerfeed-forwardneuralnetworkwithReLUacti- vation and the output layer with a softmax activation, suitable for multi-class classification. For conditioning we used a set of variables based on SPX, SPX options, VIX, and VVIX, including the last day and last hour returns scaled by the respective standard deviation of returns (from 1-minutebars), lastdayandlasthourvariancesofreturns, currentVIXandVVIXlevels(lagged by 1 minute to avoid look-ahead bias), implied volatility surface up and down slopes, estimated from interpolated data on SPX options with today’s expiration date. The results look promising on the training set, and quite disappointing on the testing and validation sets. Typically, we end up classifying most of the observations into one cluster, and the others get very low precision and recall scores. Neural network showed the best results, and it can be a good direction to try further, especially with the recurrent flavors.9 Factor Analysis using Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA). The next approach we tried was inspired by the application of IPCA (Kelly, Pruitt, and Su 2017) to explaining option returns by Bu¨chner and Kelly (2022).10 Bu¨chner and Kelly extracted systematic factors from a panel of delta-hedged index option payoffs (relative to underlying, same as we do), with multiple strike levels and maturities, using as instruments various option Greeks and time to expiration. Our setup is different in two aspects: First, we use unhedged payoffs, i.e., betting on both direction and volatility; and second, we work with very short-term options only, i.e., do not have a time-to-expiration dimension. As instruments we used first a set of Greeks, and then a grid of strategy payoffs for simulated moves in the underlying index modeled as number of sigmas times today’s implied variance to option expiry. The results for the Greeks are weaker than for the second set of instruments; however, both work well only in the in-sample exercises. Out-of-sample fit is barely positive. 9We will include the specifications and the results of the analysis later on. 10We appreciate being able to use the IPCA package available on https://bkelly-lab.github.io/ipca/. 35 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4641356",
