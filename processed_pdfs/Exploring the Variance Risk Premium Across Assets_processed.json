Most of the evidence in the literature to date is based on options on U.S. stocks and stock in- dices. However, this limited evidence does not indicate whether the properties of the variance risk premium for U.S. equity options extend to other assets. Consequently, the evidence cannot distinguish competing economic explanations for the existence and magnitude of the variance risk premium. For example, the variance risk premium might be due to systematic risk associ- atedwithinnovationsinthelevelofrisk. Alternatively, itmightbeduetoilliquidityandhedging riskinoptions.

Some papers rely on models to construct option portfoliosandtoinferthevarianceriskpremium. Otherstudiesuseinterpolatedpricesorimplied volatilities, and their results lack interpretation as returns on tradable strategies. In this paper, we measure the variance risk premium consistently across assets by constructing novel model- independent option portfolios. This approach is easily implementable in practice, and does not relyoninterpolationnoranyassumptionsabouttheunderlyingmodel. Inaddition,ourmethod- ology overcomes some of the drawbacks of the Chicago Board of Options Exchange VIX formula (CBOE(2019)).

VariancePortfolioMethodology To explore the variance risk premium in option returns across assets, we aggregate options ofdifferentstrikepricestoformarepresentativevarianceportfolioforeachasset. Itisimportant to use a methodology that consistently accommodates assets with different volatilities and uses options with different strike prices. We do this in a model-free way, constructing option portfo- lioswithpayoffsthatarehighlycorrelatedwithactualrealizedvariance,withamediancorrelation above 99% across assets. In this sense, these are truly “variance portfolios”. By comparison, Ta- ble A.1 in the appendix shows that another commonly used approach to measure variance risk premiums based on at-the-money straddle returns, has relatively low correlation with realized variance.

Thisvarianceswap approximation to a monthly return is just the realized variance over the month divided by the VIX2 at the beginning of the month, minus 1. The second column presents the actual realized returnsonourmodel-freeoptionportfolios. Whilethesereturnsoftendifferbyafewpercent,the strong correspondence of the numbers across assets supports the usefulness of the approxima- tion.

Westudyhowrealizedvariance riskpremiumsacrossourassetsrelatetoempiricalproxiesforeachofthesethreeexplanations. Perhaps the most established theories in asset pricing are based on systematic risk. In the Merton(1973)ICAPM,riskpremiumsareassociatedwithintertemporalhedgingdemandforrisks that affect investment opportunities. The level of systematic, marketwide variance is a natural candidateforavariablethataffectstheinvestmentopportunityset. Analternativetheoryisthatoptionsaredifficultandcostlytohedge. InaBlackandScholes (1973)world,optionsaredynamicallyspannedbyunderlyingfuturesreturns.However,jumpsand fattailsinfuturespricesmakeperfecthedgingimpossible(CochraneandSaa-Requejo(2000)). In addition, market illiquidity makes it difficult to manage risk quickly and efficiently. These mi- crostructural frictions affect option dealers who supply options. Illiquid option markets require morecapitaltomanagepositionsbecausetheycarrymorerisk. Insteadofperfectlyhedgingrisk inilliquidmarkets,dealersmaychoosetochargehigherpricesonoptionsthatarehardtohedge, whichwouldmakethevarianceriskpremiummorenegative. Thistheorypredictsthatjumpsand illiquidityareassociatedwithlargernegativevarianceriskpremiums.

Instead, it is possible that option returns have exposure to risk from the aggregate equity market portfolio, or from a systematic variance factor. Unreported diagnostics indicate that the first principal component of the VIX2 returns across assets is highly correlated with an equally weighted average of these returns. Moreover, the bottom row of Table 4, Panel B shows that the S&P 500 VIX2 return has 81% correlation with the equally weighted portfolio of all assets’ VIX2 returns. In other words, thissystematicvariancefactorishighlycorrelatedwiththeS&P500VIX2 return,aproxyforthe varianceoftheequitymarketportfolio.8 The right side of Table 5 (columns 6-10) uses the average VIX2 returns across all assets as a systematic risk factor, by making it the independent variable in regressions of individual asset VIX2returns.Again,thisriskadjustmentdoesnotexplainthemeanVIX2returnsforthemajority ofassets. Theinterceptsremainlargelynegativeandoftenstatisticallysignificantatconventional levels. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 illustrate the failure of futures returns and average VIX2 betas to explain VIX2returnsacrossassets. Fig.3showsapositivecross-sectionalassociationbetweentheunder- lying futures return and the average realized VIX2 return. Recall that the summary statistics in Table1showed11outof20assetshaveapositivefuturesriskpremium, whereasTable3reports that only 1 out of 20 has a positive variance risk premium. The positive cross-sectional relation- ship means that futures with a larger risk premium tend to have options with a smaller absolute variance risk premium. Similarly, Fig. 4 shows the relationship between average realized VIX2 returns,andtheVIX2 betaswithrespecttotheaverageVIX2 portfolio. JustasinFig.3,therela- tionshipispositive.

This exposesdealerstovolatilityrisk(HullandWhite(1987),Heston(1993)). Inaddition,OTMoptions canbeparticularlydifficultfordealerstohedge(CochraneandSaa-Requejo(2000)). Ifhedgingis difficultorcostly,thenoptiondealersneedmorecapitaltosupporttheiroptionpositions. Under such circumstances, it is natural for dealers to increase option prices to compensate for the risk andcostoftheirpositions.Accordingtothistheory,weexpecttoseelarger,morenegativevariance riskpremiumsinoptionmarketswithilliquidityorfat-tailedjumpsinprices.

Wefollowasimilarprocedure,andextendittoadditionallyforecastthereturns onourVIX2portfolios. Bollerslev et al. (2009) run a time series regression to predict the underlying asset’s returns basedonthepremiumofimpliedvarianceoverhistoricalvariance: r t F →T =α+β(VIX t 2−RV t−1,t )+ϵ T , (3) where r t F →T is the S&P 500 (futures) return from month t to T, and RV t−1,t is realized variance ofdailyreturnsmeasuredbythesumofdailysquaredS&P500returnsoverthepreviousmonth. Bollerslev et al. (2009) interpret a positive value of the slope coefficient β to mean that a high level of option implied variance (relative to historical realized variance) signifies a high level of systematic risk and a correspondingly high conditional equity premium on the underlying S&P 500. Although Bollerslev et al. (2009) used a measure of implied variance in excess of historical variancetoforecastequityreturns,thismeasureisevenmorerelevantforforecastingthevariance risk premium. Therefore, we derive a forecasting equation for the variance risk premium analo- gous to the equity premium regression (3).

Table7showsthattheevidenceforconditionalvariability in the variance risk premium is much stronger than the evidence for predictability of the equity premium,andthatitextendstomoreassets.

Future research can develop theoretical asset pricing models to simultaneously explain thevarianceriskpremiumsacrossassetsandthepredictableconditionalvarianceriskpremiums withinassets. 5. Conclusions This paper explores the variance risk premium across twenty different assets using a novel model-free methodology that measures returns on option portfolios, using a model-free hedge. Wefindthattosomeextent,thecommonlystudiedS&P500optionsarerepresentativeofoptions in other assets. Specifically, options on all assets exhibit a volatility smile, and all assets but the SwissFranchaveanegativerealizedvarianceriskpremium. However,therearesignificantdiffer- encesbetweenS&P500optionsandoptionsonotherassets. Forexample,S&P500optionshave thelargestnegativeoptionsmirk,whilemanycommodityoptionshaveapositivesmirk. TheS&P 500hasthesecond-largestnegativevarianceriskpremiumexcludingtheMarch2020COVIDcri- sis,andexperiencedthelargestpositivevariancereturn(above2000%)acrossallassetsduringthe COVIDcrisis. Wefindlittleevidencethatthevarianceriskpremiumacrossassetsisassociatedwithsystem- atic variance risk. Instead, assets that are positively correlated with systematic variance tend to have a smaller (negative) variance risk premium. However, we find mild evidence that the vari- 18 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4373509 anceriskpremiumisassociatedwithhedgingconstraintsasproxiedbyilliquiditymeasures(ratio ofoptionvolumetofuturesvolume)andmeasuresofjumprisk(kurtosis). Finally, we test whether the Bollerslev et al. (2009) measure of implied variance in excess of historicalvariancecanpredictvarianceandfuturesreturns. IncontrasttoBollerslevetal.(2009)’s findings, we find that this measure negatively predicts futures returns in our sample for several assets and is insignificant for the majority of assets. The measure does not significantly predict S&P500returnsexceptatthe3-monthshorizon. Wealsofindthatthemeasuresuccessfullypre- dicts returns on VIX2 option portfolios for most of the assets. These findings suggest that im- plied variance provides a useful measure of the conditional market variance risk premium. Our resultsindicatethatvarianceriskpremiumisnotwellexplainedbyexistingtheoriesandthatfu- ture research could develop better explanations for unconditional and conditional variance risk premiumsacrossassets. 19 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4373509",
