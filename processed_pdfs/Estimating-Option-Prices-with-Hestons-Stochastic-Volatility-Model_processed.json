This paper focuses on deriving and testing option pricing formulas for the Heston model [3], which describes the asset’s volatility as a stochastic process. Historical option data provides a basis for comparing the estimated option prices from the Heston model and from the popular Black-Scholes model. Root-mean-square error calculations find that the Heston model provides more accurate option pricing estimates than the Black-Scholes model for our data sample. Keywords: Stochastic Volatility Model, Option Pricing, Heston Model, Black-Scholes Model, Char- acteristic Function, Method of Moments, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Root-mean-square Error (RMSE) 1 Introduction Options are a type of financial derivative. This means that their price is not based directly on an asset’s price. Instead, the value of an option is based on the likelihood of change in an underlying asset’s price. More specifically, an option is a contract between a buyer and a seller. This contract gives the holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell an underlying asset for a specific price (strike price) within a specific amount of time. The date at which the option expires is called the date of expiration. Optionsfitintotheclassificationofcalloptionsorputoptions. Calloptionsgivetheholderoftheoption therighttobuythespecificunderlyingasset,whereasputoptionsgivetheholdertherighttosellthespecific underlying asset. Further, within the categories of call and put options, there are both American options and European options. American options give the holder of the option the right to exercise the option at any time before the date of expiration. In contrast, European options give the holder of the option the right to exercise the option only on the date of expiration. This research focuses specifically on estimating the premium of European call options. In general, when a party seeks to buy an option, that party can easily research the history of the asset’s price. Furthermore, both the date of expiration and strike price are contracted within a given option. With this, it becomes the responsibility of that party to take into consideration those known factors and objectively evaluate the value of a given option. This value is represented monetarily through the option’s price, or premium. As the market for financial derivatives continues to grow, the success of option pricing models at es- timating the value of option premiums is under examination. If a participant in the options market can predict the value of an option before the value is set, that participant will have an advantage.

    "text": "Black-Scholesmodeliswidelyusedintheassetpricingindustry. Praisedforitscomputationalsimplicityand relative accuracy, it treats the volatility of an underlying asset as a constant. Stochastic volatility models, onthe otherhand, allow forvariationinboth theasset’s priceand itsprice volatility, orstandarddeviation. This research focuses specifically on one stochastic volatility model: the Heston model [3]. This paper examines the Heston model’s success at estimating European call option premiums and compares the estimates to those of the Black-Scholes model. Heston and Nandi [4] proposed a formula for the valuation of a premium; their formula incorporates the characteristic function of the Heston model. After solving for the explicit form of the Heston model’s characteristic function, we use S&P 100 data from January 1991 to June 1997 to estimate the parameters of the Heston model’s characteristic function, which wethenuseinthecallpricingformula. WecomparetheHestonmodel’sestimates,theBlack-Scholesmodel’s estimates, and the actual premiums of option data from June 1997. In the remainder of this paper, Section 2 focuses on determining the explicit closed form of the Heston model’s characteristic function. In Section 3, we discretize the Heston model and employ two separate parameter estimation methods - the method of moments and maximum likelihood estimation. We discuss theBlack-ScholesmodelinSection4,asitservesasanalternateoptionpricingmethodtotheHestonmodel. Finally, in Section 5 we use sample data in a numerical example and evaluate the Heston model’s success at premiumestimation. Section6concludesbydiscussingourfindingsandsuggestingtopicsforfutureresearch. Due to the heavy computational nature of this research, Maple 16, R, and Microsoft Excel 2010 were all utilized in the development of this paper. 2 The Heston Model In 1993, Steven Heston proposed the following formulas to describe the movement of asset prices, where an asset’s price and volatility follow random, Brownian motion processes: (cid:112) dS =rS dt+ V S dW (1) t t t t 1t (cid:112) dV =k(θ−V )dt+σ V dW (2) t t t 2t The variables of the system are defined as follows: • S : the asset price at time t t • r: risk-free interest rate - the theoretical interest rate on an asset that carries no risk √ • V : volatility (standard deviation) of the asset price t √ • σ: volatility of the volatility V t • θ: long-term price variance • k: rate of reversion to the long-term price variance • dt: indefinitely small positive time increment • W : Brownian motion of the asset price 1t • W : Brownian motion of the asset’s price variance 2t • ρ: Correlation coefficient for W and W 1t 2t Given the above terms in the Heston model, it is important to note the properties of Brownian motion as they relate to stochastic volatility. As stated in [10], Brownian motion is a random process W ,t∈[0,T], t with the following properties: • W =0. 0 • W has independent movements. t 2",

In a martingale, the present value of a financial derivative is equal to the expected future value of that derivative, discounted by the risk-free interest rate. 2.1 The Heston Model’s Characteristic Function Each stochastic volatility model will have a unique characteristic function that describes the probability density function of that model. Heston and Nandi [4] utilize the characteristic function of the Heston model when proposing the following formula for the fair value of a European call option at time t, given a strike price K, that expires at time T: 1 e−r(T−t) (cid:90) ∞ (cid:20) K−iφf(iφ+1) (cid:21) C = S(t)+ Re dφ (3) 2 π iφ 0 (cid:18) 1 1 (cid:90) ∞ (cid:20) K−iφf(iφ) (cid:21) (cid:19) −Ke−r(T−t) + Re dφ . 2 π iφ 0 The characteristic function for a random variable x is defined by the following equation: f(iφ)=E(eiφx) Inequation(3),thefunctionf(iφ)representsthecharacteristicfunctionoftheHestonmodel. Therefore, in order to test the option pricing success of the Heston model, it is necessary to solve for the explicit form of the characteristic function. TofindtheexplicitcharacteristicfunctionfortheHestonmodel,wemustuseIto’sLemma[6]-astochastic calculus equivalent of the chain rule. For a two variable case involving a time dependent stochastic process of two variables, t and X , Ito’s Lemma makes the following statement: t Assume that X satisfies the stochastic differential equation t dX =µ dt+σ dW . t t t t If f(t,X ) is a twice differentiable scalar function, then, t (cid:18) ∂f ∂f σ2∂2f (cid:19) ∂f df(t,X )= +µ + t dt+σ dW . t ∂t t∂x 2 ∂x2 t∂x t Since Heston’s stochastic volatility model treats t, X , and V as variables, we extend Ito’s Lemma to t t three variables. Assume that we have the following system of two standard stochastic differential equations, where f(X ,V ,t) is a continuous, twice differentiable, scalar function: t t dX =µ dt+σ dW t x x 1t dV =µ dt+σ dW t v v 2t Further, let W and W have correlation ρ, where −1 ≤ ρ ≤ 1. For a function f(X ,V ,t), we wish to 1t 2t t t finddf(X ,V ,t). UsingmultivariableTaylorseriesexpansionandthepropertiesofItoCalculus,wefindthat t t the derivative of a three variable function involving two stochastic processes equals the following expression: df(X ,V ,t) = (cid:104) µ f +µ f +f +f σ σ ρ+ 1(cid:0) f σ2+f σ2(cid:1)(cid:105) dt t t x x v v t xv x v 2 xx x vv v (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:3) + σ f dW + σ f dW . x x 1t v v 2t 3",

ThefirststepistodiscretizetheHestonmodel. Tothatend,weemployEuler’sdiscretizationmethod [12]. Once the discretized model is in place, one can use data to estimate the model’s parameters. 3.1 Discretization of the Heston Model The Heston model treats movements in the asset price as a continuous time process. Measurements of asset prices, however, occur in discrete time. Thus, when beginning the process of estimating parameters from the asset price data, it is crucial to obtain a discretized asset movement model. We used the method of Euler discretization in order to discretize the Heston model. Given a stochastic model of the form dS =µ(S ,t)dt+σ(S ,t)dW , t t t t the Euler discretization of that model is √ S =S +µ(S ,t)dt+σ(S ,t) dtZ, t+dt t t t where Z is a standard normal random variable. ApplyingEulerdiscretizationtotheHestonmodel,wewishtodiscretizethesystemgivenby(1)and(2). We will let dt = 1 to represent the one trading day between each of our asset price observations.

That poses a drawback to the method of moments; however, in the Section 5, we will show that the value of ρ that we use in the call pricing formula has little effect on the estimated call prices in our data sample.

    "text": "The system’s variables are defined in the following manner: • C: call premium • t: current time • T: time at which option expires • S : stock price at time t t • K: strike price • r: risk-free interest rate. We use the rate of return on three-month U.S. Treasury Bills. • σ: volatility of the asset’s price, given by the standard deviation of the asset’s returns • Φ(·): standard normal cumulative distribution function The Black-Scholes model is widely popular due to its simplicity and ease of calculation. The model, however, makes a strong assumption by treating the volatility as a constant. The use of newer models that treat the volatility as a stochastic process is growing, however, and it is possible that Heston’s stochastic volatility model gives better option price estimates than the Black-Scholes model. Therefore, we wish to draw a comparison between the results of the Black-Scholes model and the results of the Heston model. 5 Data Example In order to compare the accuracy of the Heston model and the Black-Scholes model, we test out how well they estimate the premiums of 36 call options on the S&P 100 exchange-traded fund from June 1997. First, we must estimate the Heston model’s parameters. Utilizing both the method of moments (MOM) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) detailed previously, we find two sets of parameter estimates. The data set that we use to perform parameter estimation contains daily S&P 100 data from January 1991 to June 1997. Table 1 gives the parameter estimates that we find using both MOM and MLE estimation methods. Table 1: Parameter Estimates MOM MLE r 6.50×10−4 6.40×10−4 k 2.00 6.57×10−3 θ 5.16×10−5 6.47×10−5 σ 2.38×10−3 5.09×10−4 ρ NA −1.98×10−3 Since we are unable to solve for ρˆ , we solve for the call estimates using 21 values of ρ on increments MOM of 0.1 between −1 and 1. For our data set, the smaller the value of ρ, the closer the call estimates to the actual call data. Thus, ρ = −1 gives the most accurate price estimates, upon which we base our method of moments analysis. Granted, a person who wishes to estimate the call price before it is available will not know which value of ρ will give the best estimates. We find, however, that the call estimates we obtain from using ρ = −1 (the best choice of ρ) and the call estimates we obtain from using ρ = 1 (the worst choice of ρ) are within five cents of each other. Further, in order to measure the sensitivity of ρ, we compute the valuesofeachofthe36calloptionsusingall21valuesofρ. Thatgivesusasetof36×21=756dataentries consisting of a correlation ρ and a call value. We find that the correlation between the values of ρ and the callestimatesequals−6.44×10−5. Thatcorrelation,whichiscloseto0,impliesthatthecallestimatesfrom our data set are not particularly sensitive to the value of ρ. 8",

Furthermore, for r, we use the June 11, 1997 three month T-bill interest rate of 4.85% [1]. Together, those values for r and σ are utilized in the Black-Scholes formula to yield call price estimates. Finally, we examine a set of S&P 100 call option transaction data from June 1997, the end of the time period for which we have data on the S&P 100 index’s values. This sample of data contains options with expiration dates that were 24 days, 87 days, and 115 days into the future.

Both visual inspection and RMSE results show that the estimates of the Heston model are closer than the estimates of the popular Black-Scholes model to the actual call option prices in our data sample. The results that we find in this research make us optimistic about the knowledge that could result from further exploration of the Heston model. Utilizing additional real world option transaction data would pro- vide results of a broader scope. Furthermore, the use of data simulation to test the parameter estimation methods would permit measurement of the relative success of the estimation techniques. Although the method of moments provides closer price estimates for our data set, it remains unclear whether this result will continue. Finally, it would be beneficial to compare the results of the Heston model to those of other stochastic volatility models.

In order for the drift to equal 0 for all values of X and V , the coefficients in front of X must sum to t t t 0, the coefficients in front of V must sum to 0, and the constant terms must sum to 0. That gives us the t following system: 0=−B(cid:48)(T −t) 1 1 1 0=− B(T −t)− iφ−kC(T −t)−C(cid:48)(T −t)+ (B(T −t))2+iφ(B(T −t)) 2 2 2 1 1 − φ2+ σ2(C(T −t))2+ρσ(B(T −t))(C(T −t))+ρσiφ(C(T −t)) 2 2 0=rB(T −t)+riφ+kθC(T −t)−A(cid:48)(T −t). Further, we have the initial condition that when t = T,f(iφ) = eiφXT. As a result,we have initial conditions A(0)=0,B(0)=0, and C(0)=0. Since −B(cid:48)(T −t) = 0 and B(0) = 0, it follows that B(T −t) = 0. Given that condition, we know that the characteristic function has the form f(iφ)=eA(T−t)+C(T−t)Vt+iφXt. Further, since B(T −t)=0, we have the following two equation system: 1 1 1 C(cid:48)(T −t)=− iφ−kC(T −t)− φ2+ σ2(C(T −t))2+ρσiφ(C(T −t)) 2 2 2 A(cid:48)(T −t)=riφ+kθC(T −t) with the initial conditions that A(0)=0 and C(0)=0.
