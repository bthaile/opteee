The majority of investors (by value and number) are individual investors. Corporations include Taiwan corporations andgovernment-ownedfirms(e.g.,inDecember2000thegovernment-owned Post,Banking,andInsuranceServicesheldover$NT213billioninTaiwanese stock).

Thereisasimilarcalculationforthesalesofindividuals.Finally,wecalculate thecumulative(market-adjusted)abnormalreturn(CAR)onstocksboughtless theCAR(market-adjusted)onstockssoldas (cid:3)T (cid:1) (cid:2) CAR = MAbuy−MAsell . (2) T τ τ τ=1 There is an analogous calculation for the purchases and sales of institutional investors. The results of this analysis are presented in Figure 1, panel A. Con- sider first the results for institutions. Institutions appear to gain from trade, thoughthegainsfromtradingreachanasymptoteatapproximatelysixmonths (140 trading days). After one month (roughly 23 trading days), the stocks boughtbyinstitutionsoutperformthosesoldbyroughly80basispoints.After sixmonths,stocksboughtoutperformthosesoldbyroughly150basispoints. Incontrast,stockssoldbyindividualsoutperformthosebought.Themagni- tudeofthedifferenceissmallerthanthatforinstitutionssincemosttradesby individuals are with other individuals and do not contribute to the difference in performance between stocks sold and stocks bought.

Thoughtheseresultsprovideapowerfulvisualrepresentationofourprimary results, we do not draw inferences from this event time analysis because of thewell-knownproblemsassociatedwithconstructingawell-specifiedtestof the null hypothesis that abnormal returns are zero using long-run event-time returns. We base our statistical tests on the daily time series of dollar profits and the monthly time series of portfolio returns earned on stocks bought (or sold) by each of the investor groups that we analyze. (See Lyon, Barber, and Tsai (1999) and Mitchell and Stafford (2000).)

The average daily insti- tutional gains from trade (and individual losses) are virtually identical at the one-yearandsix-monthhorizon(seealsoFigure1).Totesttherobustnessof theseresults,wecalculatetheaveragedailyinstitutionalgrossprofitsforeach calendaryearfrom1995to1999.Ineachyear,meandailyinstitutionalprofits are positive (reliably so in four of the five sample years). Furthermore, when wesumdailyprofitswithineachmonth,institutionsprofitinfourty-fouroutof sixtymonthsduringoursampleperiod. 621 TheReviewofFinancialStudies/v22n22009 2.3 Tracingprofitstopassiveandaggressivetrades The fourth and fifth columns of numbers in Table 4 present the total profits thatcanbetracedtopassiveandaggressivetrades.Thelasttwocolumnsofthe table present the associated test statistics. Summing the profits of aggressive and passive trades does not precisely equal the total profits from all trades, sinceweareunabletocategorizealltrades. Consider first the passive trades. Both individuals and institutions profit in the short run from their passive trades. However, as we increase the horizon overwhichthetradingprofitsareevaluatedfromonedayto140tradingdays, the profitability of the passive trades of individual investors erodes and is indistinguishablefromzeroat25and140tradingdays.Incontrast,thepassive profitsofinstitutionsremainreliablypositiveatallhorizons. Whenaninvestorplacesapassiveorder,heisessentiallyofferingtoprovide liquiditytomarketparticipantswhodemandit.Ourresultsindicatethatthough individuals initially profit by providing liquidity to market participants, these profitserodeperhapsbecausethosetowhichindividualsprovideliquidityhave information about the future prospects of a stock. While some individuals undoubtedlyunwindthesepositionsforaprofit,inaggregate,individualshold positionsinitiatedwithliquidityprovidingtradesuntilinitialprofitsarelost.In contrast,institutionsaremuchbetteratsustainingprofitsthroughtheprovision ofliquidity. Thepatternofprofitsforaggressiveordersisquitedifferent.Individualin- vestors lose large sums immediately on their aggressive orders. Apparently, individualinvestorsdemandliquiditywhentheyhavenoinformationaboutthe future prospects of a stock. This observation is quite consistent with models that assume investors are overconfident and, as a result, trade too aggres- sively and to their detriment. In a striking contrast, institutions immediately profit from their aggressive trades and these profits grow dramatically at a longerhorizon—perhapsastheinformationthatinstitutionspossessaboutthe prospectsforastockaremorewidelyappreciatedbymarketparticipants.

The aggregate portfolio of individual investors suffers an annual performance penalty of 3.8 percentage points. In contrast, institutions enjoy an annual performance boost of 1.5 percentage points(aftercommissionsandtaxes,butbeforeothercosts). From 1995 to 1999, individual lose $NT 935 billion from their trading in stocks. Losses can be traced to (1) gross trading losses ($NT 249 billion); (2) commissions ($NT 302 billion); (3) transaction taxes ($NT 319 billion); and(4)market-timinglosses($NT65billion).15 Theselossesrepresent2.8% of the total personal income (including income of noninvestors) or 2.2% of Taiwan’s total GDP during our sample period.

Thus, nearly half of the wealthtransferfromdomesticindividualstoinstitutionalinvestorsgoestofor- eigninstitutions.Whethertheinstitutionalprofitsofcorporations,dealers,and domestic mutual funds represent a wealth transfer depends on many factors.

ReasonstoTrade Why do individual investors willingly incur such large net trading losses? There are several reasons why uninformed investors might trade: liquidity requirements,rebalancingneeds,hedgingdemands,entertainment(orsensation seeking),andthemistakenbeliefthattheyareinformed,thatis,overconfidence. TurnoverinTaiwanduringoursampleperiodisnearly300%annuallyandtwo to three times that observed in the United States in recent years. It strikes us as unlikely that the liquidity, rebalancing, and hedging needs of Taiwanese investors are two to three times those of current U.S. investors or that these needswarrantareductionof3.8percentagepointsinthereturnontheaggregate portfolioofTaiwaneseindividualinvestors.Wepropose,thoughdonotprove, thatacombinationofoverconfidenceandthedesiretogambleaccountformuch oftheactivetradingandsubstantiallossesofindividualinvestorsinTaiwan. Cross-cultural studies of overconfidence report higher levels of overconfidence—bysomemeasuresnearlydouble—inChinaandTaiwancom- paredwiththeUnitedStates(Yatesetal.,1989,1998).Theoreticalmodelsof equitymarketspredictthatoverconfidentinvestorswilltradetotheirdetriment (Odean, 1998; Gervais and Odean, 2001; and Caballe´ and Sa´kovics, 2003), while empirical work (Grinblatt and Keloharju, 2006) links overconfidence and sensation seeking with more active trading. Thus, overconfidence could contributetoexcessivetradinginTaiwan. Another contributing factor may be that Taiwanese investors view trad- ing in the stock market as an opportunity to gamble (Kumar, 2006) or a sensation-seeking activity (Grinblatt and Keloharju, 2006). During our sam- pleperiod,gamblingwasillegalinTaiwan.Legalizedgamblingintheformof a government-sponsored lottery (the Public Welfare Lottery) was introduced in January 2002.

To calibrate the reasonableness of this result, we compare lottery losses to stock market trading losses. Average annual lottery sales in Taiwan from 2002 through 2006 were $NT 82.3 billion (National Treasury Agency, Taiwan, http://www.nta.gov.tw/business/roclotto.asp). With a lottery payout rate of approximately 60% (ROC Lotto, http://www.roclotto.com.tw), lottery playerspaidanaveragenetannualcostofabout$NT32.9billion.InSection3, weestimatedtradingtotallossestoTaiwaneseindividualinvestorsfrom1995 to1999averaging$NT187billionperyear.Ifindividualinvestortradinglosses areapproximatelyproportionaltothetradingactivity,a25%reductioninthe trading activity would correspond to a reduction in annual trading losses of about $NT 46.75 billion.

Conclusion We estimate that Taiwanese individual investors incur trading losses, trading costs, and market-timing losses that reduce their aggregate portfolio return by 3.8 percentage points annually. Less comprehensive studies suggest that tradinglossesandcostsforindividualinvestorsintheUnitedStatesareabout 2percentagepointsayear(BarberandOdean,2000,2001).(U.S.individualin- vestorstradelessactively,butrunahigherriskoftradingwithbetter-informed institutional investors.) Countries around the world are increasingly counting on personal investment accounts to fund their citizens’ retirements. Yet most individualshavenotrainingininvestments;manyholdunderdiversifiedportfo- liosandroutinelymakepoortradingdecisions.Overasavingshorizonof20or moreyears,anannualreturnshortfallof2to3.8percentagepointswillresult in a tremendous reduction in potential wealth. In Taiwan, the United States, andelsewhere,investorswhoaresavingtomeetlongtermgoalswouldbenefit from effective guidance regarding best investment practices. Until then, the answer to “Justhow much do individual investors lose bytrading?” remains: Toomuch!
