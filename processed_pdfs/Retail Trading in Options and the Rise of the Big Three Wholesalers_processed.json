    "text": "The advent of zero-commission trading in stocks and options has revolutionized retail brokerage services in the United States. Since their market entry in 2015, the smartphone investing app Robinhood and other commission-free brokerages have attracted an unprece- dented inflow of retail customers. At the peak of its popularity in late 2021, Robinhood alone has amassed 21.3 million monthly active users, as reported in the company’s quarterly statements. The new generation of retail investors are young and tech-savvy yet amateur investors. A survey by FINRA (2021a) reports that 38% of investors who opened a (taxable) brokerage account in 2020 did so for the first time. Of these new investors, 22% were between ages 18 and 29 and 66% were under 45 years old. Moreover, a third of first-time investors had account balances of less than $500. One concern frequently brought up in the context of the recent retail trading boom is related to the controversial practice of payment for order flow (PFOF). Retail brokerages route clients’ orders to financial intermediaries (known as wholesalers) for execution and receive PFOF in return. In equities, wholesalers cross this order flow on their private trading platforms, away from national exchanges, and other market makers cannot compete for these orders. This is known as internalization. PFOF is a divisive practice because such order flow fragmentation may lead to wider bid-ask spreads on exchanges and because it may incentivize investors to trade more (see SEC (2022)). In June 2022, Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), publicly criticized PFOF and order execution quality for retail investors.1 However, the SEC’s attention has been focused almost exclusively on equities; in fact, Gensler gave the options market as an example of superior retail order execution. Unlike equities, all options in the U.S. trade on exchanges, which should mechanically expose option orders to direct competition from other market makers. It is therefore thought that internalization is specific to equities. In this paper, we argue that much of the retail order flow in options is also effectively internalized. We identify a friction that may hinder competition from other market makers on options exchanges. Specifically, wholesalers frequently execute retail orders through so- called price improvement mechanisms, which, as we show, often amounts to internalization. This allows us to isolate wholesaler trades and build a proxy for retail trading in options by exploiting a recently introduced flag for price improvement mechanisms in transaction-level data. We find that our measure of retail trading grew 104% from January 2020 to July 2021, in line with the growth in PFOF for options.2 Retail traders prefer cheaper, weekly options – the average quoted bid-ask spread for which is as high as 12.6% – and lose money 1See https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-08/sec-chief-takes-aim-at-payment-for-order-flow- in-sweeping-plans. 2We consider the combined PFOF from the largest U.S. retail brokerages reports under SEC Rule 606 (routing of orders).

    "text": "on average. A large fraction of retail order flow is serviced by very few wholesalers: The share in PFOF of the top three has grown to nearly 90% as of the second quarter of 2021. We start by documenting a stylized fact that, although only a fraction of investors trade options, most of the PFOF received by retail brokerages comes from options, not equities. For example, in 2021, U.S. brokerages received $2.4 billion in PFOF for options and only $1.3 billion for equities. The lion’s share of PFOF for options came from only three wholesalers: Citadel, Susquehanna, and Wolverine. RetailbrokersintheU.S.arerequiredtoprovidethebestexecutiontotheirclients, so they have an agreement with a wholesaler to provide price improvement relative to the best available bid and ask prices.3 To do so, they often use an options exchange process known as a price improvement auction or mechanism. Exploiting a flag for price improvement mechanisms, introduced by the Options Price Reporting Authority (OPRA) in November 2019 for transaction-level data, we are able to identify wholesaler trades and build a novel measure of retail trading in options. In our dataset, these are trades executed through a single-leg price improvement mechanism, which we abbreviate as SLIM.4 The monthly dollar trading volume in SLIM transactions grew by 104% from January 2020 to July 2021, alongside the PFOF in options (158%). We show that our measure picks up recent retail investor frenzies in GameStop and other “meme\" stocks, as measured by mentions on WallStreetBets, an investing forum popular with new retail investors. Furthermore, it is strongly correlated with an alternative retail investor trading measure – small trades in options (up to 10 contracts) – commonly used in the media and industry,5 as well as with Robinhood user popularity provided by Robintrack, and the retail frenzies measure of Barber, Huang, Odean, and Schwartz (2022). We also construct a novel retail popularity measure based on the internalized volume in the underlying stock or exchange-traded fund (ETF) using public data and show that it comoves with SLIM trades in the corresponding options. Weprovideseveralmoreteststoarguethatourmeasureindeedcapturesretailtrades. First, SLIM trading in options on tickers popular with retail investors drops significantly during outages on large U.S. retail brokerage platforms. For example, when comparing SLIM trading in the options on the same ticker during the times when these popular trading platformsexperienceanoutageversusnormaloperation,wefindthatSLIMtradinginoptions 3Most of order flow in options received by retail brokerages in our sample is routed to wholesalers. The fraction of orders routed directly to exchanges is small; see Table A1 in the Internet Appendix. 4Specifically, we use OPRA type “SLAN,\" which stands for single-leg non-ISO price improvement mecha- nisms. See Internet Appendix A.2 for a description. 5For instance, Bloomberg relies on small trades to proxy retail participation in options; see https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/gamestop-highlights-importance-of-option-related-equity- flows/. 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

    "text": "on popular stocks and ETFs significantly declines. Broker platform outages are plausibly exogenous to retail trading in options on a particular ticker. Second, we run a similar test on tickers that were subject to trading restrictions imposed by the same retail brokerages in 2021. We find that SLIM trading in those tickers drops significantly, by almost 30%, when all large brokers restrict trading at the same time. Finally, we present more evidence supporting SLIM as a measure of retail trading in options based on expiration-day rules of retail brokerages, stock splits, and call option exercise patterns. The new generation of retail investors is more tech-savvy and participates in invest- ment forums, but they are still financial novices. It is quite striking that they are so active in optionsmarkets, despitemuchhigherbid-askspreadsonoptionsrelativetostocks.6 Notably, 50% of retail trades in our sample are in ultra short-term options, that is, options with less than a week to expiration, with an average quoted bid-ask spread of 12.6%. However, the true trading costs for options may be obfuscated by the zero commissions; an opportunity to tradeoptionsisdisplayedprominentlyongamifiedinvestingappsusedbythenewgeneration of investors.7 Moreover, on some investing platforms, including Robinhood, weekly options are presented as a default choice to an options trader. In addition, retail investors may be attracted to the cheap way of achieving leverage that these options provide: Embedded leverage in weekly options is very high, often exceeding 50 (see Table A4 in the Internet Appendix). What can our measure uncover about retail investor preferences in options? Retail investors in our sample strongly prefer call options to puts: The volume share in calls is 69%. They trade mostly at-the-money (72% of trades) or slightly-out-of-the-money (24% of trades) options. The latter involve especially high trading costs, with the average quoted bid-ask spread of 28%. 14% of retail trades have a “micro\" size of up to $250, and their average quoted bid-ask spread is 23.6%. We document that retail investors prefer options on larger companies, with lower share prices and higher recent trading volume (e.g., attention- grabbing stocks). This is consistent with the literature on retail participation in equities. We view these cross-sectional relationships as suggestive evidence of speculative rather than hedging motives behind retail trades. Finally, we document significant increases in both call and put net purchases during retail investor frenzies, especially in trades of a smaller size. Are retail options trades profitable?

    "text": "manceofSLIMtradesattheone-, two-, five-, and10-dayhorizons, aswellasuntilexpiration. On aggregate, these trades lose money for all horizons. For example, assuming a holding horizon of 10 days, we estimate that the aggregate portfolio of retail investors lost $2.1 billion from November 2019 to June 2021. The bulk of the losses comes from the indirect costs of trading. The aggregate trading costs, measured as a distance from an actual trade price to midquote for all SLIM trades in our sample, amount to a staggering $6.5 billion. This number is much higher than direct trading costs (about $950 million), computed using commissions of retail brokerages in our sample.8 We next examine on what type of options contracts retail investors lose money. Re- gardless of the chosen measure of performance (i.e., dollar performance, per-dollar prof- itability, or delta-hedged performance), the aggregate net losses are concentrated in trades in short-term contracts. Further decomposition by trade direction suggests that there are two types of retail investors in our data: those who buy short-term options and lose money and those who sell these contracts and make significant profits, even after transaction costs. We also find that retail trading in options, in particular, a high volume imbalance in calls, tends to predict returns on the underlying stocks over the next trading day. This could be consistent with the informed trading hypothesis. However, given the short-term nature of predictability and all our other findings regarding SLIM behavior and performance, these results seem to be more in line with the price pressure caused by the hedging demand of the intermediaries servicing retail order flow. How big is retail participation in the options market, and what fraction of their trading does our measure capture? We perform a back-of-the-envelope calculation to assess how SLIM trading volume compares to the retail trading volume that can be inferred from the recently revised SEC Rule 606 forms filed by brokerages in the U.S. First, we estimate that retail investors constitute 48% of the total trading volume in options. This magnitude is striking, given that this market has been traditionally thought to be largely populated by institutional and/or sophisticated investors. Second, we find that SLIM reflects over 70% of inferred trading volume from market and marketable limit orders and over 30% of the total inferred retail trading volume (or 15% of the total market volume). To make up for the remaining retail trading and to alleviate concerns related to order selection into SLIM, we propose three alternative measures of retail trading that are noisier yet capture a larger fraction of the overall retail trading volume in options. Specifically, we first consider another way in which wholesalers can internalize transactions of up to five contracts and use the new OPRA trade flags to isolate such trades. We then add to those trades a refined subset of small trades (of up to 10 contracts), again using OPRA flags to define the subset, and 8Robinhood does not charge commissions for options trades, but many other brokerages still do. 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

    "text": "finally also include trades of small dollar values (up to $5,000). We show that these measures are similar to SLIM in terms of observables, e.g., preference for short-term options and call contracts. Like SLIM, these measures comove positively with proxies for retail investor popularity and drop significantly during outages experienced by large U.S. retail brokerages and during trading restrictions imposed by these brokerages. Additionally, they are not statistically different from SLIM in terms of their net profitability. This helps us conclude that, while the SLIM methodology does not capture the entire retail volume, SLIM trades are comparable to our broader measures of retail trading. Finally, we argue that our retail trading measure is less noisy than the popular in- dustry alternative, small trades. Using the new OPRA trade flags, we identify many insti- tutional transactions that are broken down into multiple small trades. Therefore, the naive small trades measure may contain many false positives, contaminating empirical analysis. Our paper is related to the emerging literature exploring retail investor trading in the age of Robinhood. Welch (2022), Barber et al. (2022), Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, and Zhang (2021), Eaton, Green, Roseman, and Wu (2022b), and Fedyk (2021) focus on retail investor equity holdings and trading and argue that the new generation of investors differs from retail investors previously examined in the literature (most notably by Barber and Odean (2001)) along several important dimensions. Although the counts of retail investor equity positions are available from Robintrack, data on their trading in options is not available to researchers. To our knowledge, we are the first to document retail investor preferences and market participation in options, which we infer from transaction-level data using newly introduced OPRA trade types. We are aware of the following papers on retail trading in options. Using account- level data from a brokerage, Bauer, Cosemans, and Eichholtz (2009) document that retail investors’ motives for trading appear to be gambling and entertainment and that they incur substantial losses on their options investments. Lakonishok, Lee, Pearson, and Poteshman (2007) argue that speculation is the key driver of retail investors’ trading in options and that during the dot-com bubble they favored options on growth stocks. Our paper doc- uments that this phenomenon is even more widespread than initially thought, given that retail trading in options accounts for 48% of the total market volume. Furthermore, our findings also indicate that most of this trading is likely related to gambling as opposed to hedging motives. In contemporaneous work, Eaton, Green, Roseman, and Wu (2022a) use retail brokerage outages to document that options on stocks popular with retail investors experience demand pressures that affect their implied volatilities and de Silva, Smith, and So (2022) document that retail investors lose on their trades around earnings announce- ments. These papers mainly exploit data from Nasdaq options trade outlines. Our paper 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

    "text": "uses transaction-level data for the entire U.S. options market to document the trading pat- terns of the new generation of retail investors. We confirm the findings of Lakonishok et al. that retail investors have a strong preference for call options and that, on average, they write more options than they buy. We document additionally that they opt for ultra short-term (weekly) options (consistent with preferences for skewness discussed in Barberis and Huang (2008) and Boyer and Vorkink (2014)), participate in trading frenzies, and incur large trad- ing costs (possibly masked by zero-commission offers). The literature has also documented poor retail investor performance during the bubble episode in the Chinese warrant market, attributing poor performance to feedback trading, herding, and buying out-of-the-money warrants too close to expiration (Xiong and Yu (2011), Cai, He, Jiang, and Xiong (2021), Li, Subrahmanyam, and Yang (2021), and Pearson, Yang, and Zhang (2021)). Finally, also related to our work are papers on options market structure and liquidity, for example, Battalio, Griffith, and Van Ness (2021), Ramachandran and Tayal (2021), MuravyevandPearson(2020), Christoffersen, Goyenko, Jacobs, andKaroui(2018), Battalio, Shkilko, and Van Ness (2016), Muravyev (2016), and Mayhew (2002). None of these papers, however, constructs measures of retail investor trading or, more generally, examines retail investors. In independent contemporaneous work, Ernst and Spatt (2022) and Hendershott, Khan, and Riordan (2022) propose the same method as ours to identify wholesaler trades in the options market. Their main focus is on the price improvement (relative to the best prevailing quotes) achieved by wholesalers. Our focus is on the behavior of retail investors in the options market and on their performance during the recent retail trading boom. 1 PFOF and rise of retail trading in options market In this section, we document novel facts about retail trading in the U.S. options market. Leveraging several granular datasets and regulatory filings, we describe the market for PFOF in stocks and options. We propose a new measure of retail activity in the options market based on transaction-level data, describe its composition, and show how it relates to the existing stock-level retail activity measures and other characteristics of the underlying. We validate our measure using plausibly exogenous trading restrictions and show that it is representative of broader measures of retail trading in options. 1.1 Data We use option transaction-level data from OPRA LiveVol provided by CBOE. This data covers all trades on 16 U.S. exchanges in index, ETF, and equity options. In our 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

    "text": "analysis, we focus on ETF and equity options and exclude index options.9 Our sample covers November 4, 2019 to June 30, 2021. Following the literature, we remove canceled trades, trades with nonpositive size or price, with a negative spread (difference between best ask and best bid) and only keep trades for which trade price is above the best bid minus spread and below the best ask plus spread. We aggregate trades of the same contract with the same quote time, exchange ID, trade price, and trade condition ID into one line. We do not exclude open or close trades from our analysis, yet we confirm that excluding trades before 9:45 a.m. and after 3:50 p.m. does not change our results. We winsorize trade prices, sizes, and spreads at the 99.5th percentile daily. To compute trade imbalances, we follow the method described in Muravyev (2016), whereby trades with prices above (below) the midpoint are classified as “buy\" (“sell\") trades and trades at midpoint are classified according to the quote rule on the exchange where the trade took place.10 We use daily option price, volume, and open interest data from OptionMetrics. It comes at a contract level for the period between January 4, 1996, and June 30, 2021. We lag open interest for all the data after November 28, 2000, to have a series of consistent open interest as of the end of day.11 We exclude contracts with a non-standard settlement. We also use data from Nasdaq Options Trade Outline (NOTO) and the PHLX Op- tions Trade Outline (PHOTO) End-of-Day files with order classification by the originating counterparty (customers, professional customers, market makers, firms, or broker/dealers). All standard stock- and ETF-level data comes from the Center for Research in Secu- rityPrices(CRSP).Thisincludesdividendhistory, stockpricesandreturns, andoutstanding shares. To link with OptionMetrics, we rely on the SecId-PERMNO crosswalk provided by WRDS. Our data on retail investor popularity is as follows. To build the measure of ticker mentions on WallStreetBets and its popularity, we use the data on both posts and com- ments available from the Pushshift Reddit Dataset. This is the largest publicly available Reddit dataset, that includes all the posts and comments and is continuously updated in real time. In particular, we use monthly dump files for the period of November 2019 to June 9Our sample also includes some ADRs. For brevity, we refer to underlying assets as “stocks and ETFs\" in the text that follows. 10Wehavealsoconfirmedthatourresultsholdifweusetwoalternativemethods: aso-calledquoterule,that is, when midpoint trades are excluded (shown to have strong performance for options data by Savickas and Wilson (2003)), and the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm (that is, applying tick rule to classify trades at midpoint instead of excluding them). The resulting ticker-level imbalances have a correlation over 99% between the quote and Lee-Ready (1991) methods, while the correlation of either of them with the Muravyev (2016) method is 94%. 11The lag is due to the change in the reporting format of OptionMetrics. This implies that end-of-day open interest is measured after option exercises. 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

To count ticker mentions in the downloaded posts and comments, we start from the list of unique historical tickers from CRSP and search for them in all the comments, then simply sum by date. Note that we exclude tickers that might coincide with popular words used on the forum (“USA\", “YOLO\", “IPO\", “MOON\", etc.) We search only for capitalized tickers, as it is typical for the reddit audience to use those. Since we exclude some of the tickers, omit any lower-case mentions, and do not cover other threads of the forum (such as occasional megathreads), our measure provides a lower bound for ticker popularity. Full description of the dataset and filters on the ticker exclusion can be found in Section C.4 of the Internet Appendix. For Robinhood breadth of ownership, we use Robintrack data, which is provided in intraday snapshots and covers May 5, 2018, to August 13, 2020. We use the number of users holding a stock as of the last intraday snapshot. In addition, we rely on Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Over- the-Counter (OTC) Transparency data for stock trading volumes executed away from lit exchanges, that is, automated trading system (ATS), typically referred to as “dark pools,\" andnon-ATSOTCtrades. PursuanttoFINRA’sRegulatoryNotice15-48,theseareavailable from April 2016, by security and venue.12 Recently revised Rule 60613 requires broker-dealers to report the aggregate data on PFOF in stocks and options, along with its composition across a number of categories. We download these forms for the largest brokers in the United States directly from their websites. We consider all the leading retail brokerages that rely on wholesalers for PFOF in servicingretailflow. Thelistofbrokers, largestvenues, andbrokers’correspondingpayments for order flow is reported in Table A3 in the Internet Appendix. We consider PFOF and PFOF-implied volume for each reporting broker. Note that our sample does not include Interactive Brokers, because they do not rely on the PFOF model and send retail orders directly to exchanges. In tests with broker platform outages and trading restrictions, we merge TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab from October 2020 because that is when Charles Schwab completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade.

    "text": "The global retail brokerage industry has changed drastically in recent years. More platforms are offering zero-commission trading in equities, and commissions in other asset classes have been reduced as well. Elimination of commissions has fueled a retail partici- pation boom in financial markets, rise in day trading, and gamification of investing.14 The success of the zero-commission business model relies on PFOF received from intermediaries in exchange for routing retail orders to them for execution. In response to the changing industry landscape and to promote transparency, the SEC introduced new reporting re- quirements for brokers. In this section, we use the forms filed in compliance with the new rule (Rule 606 reports) to describe the market for PFOF. Figure 1 plots monthly PFOF received by the U.S. retail brokerages in our sample since the more detailed reporting of PFOF was made compulsory by the SEC. Although only a fraction of retail investors trade options, the amount of PFOF from options exceeds that from stocks by about 100%, in each month in our sample. In 2021, the annual PFOF from options was $2.4 billion, compared to $1.3 billion from equities. Our results below help understand why PFOF in options is so large. Despite recent growth in retail trading and the commercial success of the zero- commission model, the wholesaler market remains quite concentrated, with the top five PFOF providers accounting for over 95% of the total PFOF received by U.S. brokerages (see Figure 2). Also apparent from Figure 2 is the high concentration of PFOF providers in options, with the share of the top three providers – Citadel, Susquehanna, and Wolverine – increasing from 73% at the beginning of our sample and reaching an average value of about 85%. It peaked at nearly 90% in the second quarter of 2021. We hereafter refer to Citadel, Susquehanna, and Wolverine as Big Three wholesalers in options. 1.3 SLIM: A measure of retail trading in options In this section we propose a new measure of retail trading in options. Our method- ology relies on detecting wholesaler-intermediated trades in transaction-level options data. A highly publicized advantage for investors for having their orders routed to a whole- saler by a retail brokerage in exchange for PFOF is that the wholesaler promises a price improvement to the customers, that is, the execution price that is at least as good as or bet- ter than the best quoted price, known as National Best Bid and Offer, or NBBO. To meet this commitment, wholesalers frequently execute retail orders through price improvement 14See, e.g., the interview with the SEC chair: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/01/19/secs-gensler -warns-investors-about-frequent-trades-on-brokerage-apps.html. 9 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

A retail investor sends an order, which the broker routes to a wholesaler in exchange for PFOF and price improvement. Unlike a stock order, which can be internalized by a wholesaler on its own private trading platform, all options orders in the United States must be executed on exchanges. The wholesaler therefore engages its affiliated market maker to bring a paired order (with the affiliated market maker taking the other side) to a price improvement auction on an exchange. Market participants (“responders\") have a window of time to respond (by sending a “contra\" offer) with a better price (hence, the name “price improvement mechanism\"), which could lead to the wholesaler losing the trade. In practice, the fees set by exchanges are stacked against responders, and it is prohibitively expensive to break up many of these paired trades.15 These responder fees are so high because exchanges also compete for the order flow and incentivize wholesalers to bring orders to them.16 Our novel measure of retail trading activity in options is based on trades that went through price improvement auctions. To construct it, we use a dataset from OPRA that includes all options transactions in the U.S. We take advantage of a unique feature of our dataset: the new trade type flags introduced by OPRA on November 4, 2019. This classi- fication is significantly more detailed than its predecessors, and hence we can construct our measure starting only from November 4, 2019. Specifically, we use the OPRA transaction code SLAN, which stands for “single-leg price improvement mechanism\"; we use the acronym SLIM to refer to these trades (see Internet Appendix A.2 for a description). In our analysis below, we primarily focus on SLIM Share, which could be computed as a frequency share and as a trading volume share. We adopt the latter definition, as it is more relevant for assessing the economic importance of retail traders. We compute it daily and aggregate it to a ticker level using total options trading volumes. We discuss other measures constructed using SLIM trades, for example, SLIM Imbalances, later in this section. Price improvement auctions were first introduced to improve trade execution for in- stitutional investors, but a specific type of them that we use, single-leg non-ISO price im- provement actions (OPRA trade type “SLAN\"), are now used by wholesalers for executing retail orders. ISO stands for “intermarket sweep orders,\" which is a type of market orders, 15On most exchanges, order execution by a wholesaler-affiliated market maker is charged the fee of just $.05 per contract. In contrast, it would cost another market maker $.50 to break up/respond to one of these already paired orders during an auction. In the latter case, the wholesaler receives a net rebate of $.30 per contract simply for bringing the order to the exchange. Internet Appendix A.5 contains a detailed description of the fee structure pertaining to price improvement mechanisms on U.S. options exchanges and highlights the fee advantages enjoyed by affiliated market makers. 16To some extent, this is natural, since markets benefit from the presence of largely uninformed retail flow and wholesalers are therefore compensated for delivering these orders. However, the structure and size of the fees associated with servicing retail order flow, which would lead to the optimal level of competition among market makers and efficient order execution, are still an open question. 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

    "text": "developed for large institutional trades, that take all available liquidity at the best price, then all liquidity at the next best price, and so on, until the order is filled. Trades that are executed in ISO price improvement auctions have a very different profile than SLIM trades – these are large institutional trades. There are also multi-leg price improvement auctions, stock options auctions, among others (see Internet Appendix A.2 for more details), which may have have some retail investor transactions, but they are a much noisier measure of retail trading and we therefore restrict our measure to single-leg non-ISO price improvement auctions. As a comparison, we also report a measure of retail trading in options, often used in the media and industry: Small Share, the volume share of trades of up to 10 contracts, and the corresponding trading volume in small trades.17 The frequency share of small trades is 87% in our sample, which overestimates retail investor activity in options. This measure is noisier than SLIM because in addition to retail trades it contains transactions of proprietary tradingfirms(e.g.,SimplexTrading)orISOordersoflargeinstitutionalinvestors,whichwere broken into smaller trades by order execution algorithms. For example, ISO transactions are reported by OPRA as a collection of separate small transactions for the same contract but at different prices and different exchanges. In our sample, the small trades measure picks up 18.2% of ISO trades. Using the OPRA flag for ISOs, we can approximately reconstruct the original order by bunching together trades in the same contract at virtually the same time on multiple exchanges. Table A6 in Internet Appendix A.6 contrasts ISO trades as reported by OPRA and bunched ISO trades. In the original transactions data, the volume share of trades above $20,000 is only 14.2%, while in the bunched sample this share reaches 31.5%. In Section 1.5, we propose a refinement of the small trades measure based on the new OPRA trade flags, which is a more accurate measure of retail trading than all small trades. In Figure 3, we plot our retail trading measure in options, SLIM Share, alongside Small Share. We also plot the total volume of SLIM and small trades. Panels A and C reveal significant growth of and comovement between SLIM and small trading volumes: Retail investor trading shows a marked increase in our sample. For example, the dollar trading volume in SLIM and small transactions has grown by 104% and 139%, respectively, fromJanuary2020toJuly2021. ThisisinlinewiththegrowthofPFOFforoptions, whichis 158%overthesameperiod, basedon monthly data. The growth inretailtradingisespecially high from January 2020 to March 2021. This period includes several well-publicized retail investor frenzies in equities and a meteoric rise in the number of Robinhood’s active users. 17Another popular measure of retail trading in options is based on the “customer\" order classification pro- vided by some exchanges. Bryzgalova, Pavlova, and Sikorskaya (2022) highlight false positives of this order classification using OPRA codes for transactions executing a specific sophisticated arbitrage trading strategy, dividend play. 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

Panels A and C plot total daily trading volumes in SLIM and small trades, respectively. Panels B and D plot daily SLIM and Small Shares, respectively, averaged across all stocks and ETFs in our sample. This increased participation is also reflected in higher average shares, especially in summer 2020, when the average SLIM Share was almost as high as 20%. Table 1 presents various features of SLIM trades and compares them to non-SLIM trades in the options market. To formally test the differences between them, we compute the average daily characteristics for SLIM and non-SLIM trades across each of the dimensions reported in Table 1. Values in bold correspond to the features of the SLIM trades that are statistically different from those of non-SLIM trades at 1% at a daily frequency. We report the daily averages and test their differences to those of non-SLIM trades in Tables A7 and A8 in the Internet Appendix, respectively.

    "text": "maturities: 50.3% of SLIM trades (in terms of their volume share) are in weekly options, compared with 42.8% for the non-SLIM trades. This difference is highly significant, both statistically and economically. The average bid-ask spread in options with less than a week to expiration is a whopping 12.6%. The effective spread is lower, 6.6%, reflecting that these orders indeed received price improvement. However, the effective spread is still orders of magnitude higher than that in equities. Why do retail investors opt for ultra short-term options? One possible explanation is that options with the shortest maturity are listed as default on trading apps (e.g., they are a default choice on Robinhood).18 Another explanation is investor preferences for lotteries or gambling. This explanation is consistent with preferences for skewness, as discussed in Barberis and Huang (2008) and Boyer and Vorkink (2014), and a number of other behavioral biases (e.g., overconfidence, sensation-seeking, and preferences for gambling), summarized in Table1ofLiu, Peng, Xiong, andXiong(2022).19 Finally, retailinvestorsmaysimplybecash- constrained.20 Indeed, weekly options have the lowest prices relative to otherwise identical contracts with longer maturities, so retail investors could opt for the cheapest alternative. At a 12.6% quoted bid-ask spread, the cheapest alternative, however, is by no means cheap to trade. Luredbyrecentlow-orzero-commissionoffers, retailinvestorspossiblyunderestimate the indirect trading costs in the options market.21 Table1alsorevealsthatretailinvestorsstronglyprefercallstoputs: Thevolumeshare in calls is 69%. We further find that written options are slightly more popular with retail investors than purchased options. Retail brokerages in our sample place various restrictions on naked options positions, as detailed in FINRA (2021b). Therefore, while written puts may simply be covered with cash, written calls (that do not simply close a preexisting long position in the same contract) are most likely part of a covered call strategy. We also use the Nasdaq NOTO and PHOTO end-of-day files for our sample period and provide trade classification by the originating counterparty. Following de Silva et al. (2022), we use the “customer\" classification to generate a proxy for daily retail trader position and find 18Defaultoptionsoftenhaveasignificantimpactonfinancialdecision-making;seeMadrianandShea(2001), Choi, Laibson, Madrian, andMetrick(2004), Beshears, Choi, Laibson, andMadrian(2009), andBeshears, Choi, Laibson, Madrian, and Skimmyhorn (2022), among others. 19Weekly at-the-money options, favored by retail investors, often have an implied leverage of 58–73. Table A4 in the Internet Appendix reports implied leverage for various option groups. 20For evidence that the new generation of retail traders in options is cash-constrained, see FINRA (2021a). Additionally, in Internet Appendix G.3, we examine stock splits and present evidence suggestive of cash constraints. 21ThePFOFmodelanditsimplicationsforexecutionqualityandcosttransparencyhavebeenunderscrutiny of regulators for years.

    "text": "argue, however, that the new generation of retail investors is cash-constrained and does not have sufficient collateral for writing options. The buy-sell imbalance in SLIM trades could then be due to the fact that our measure contains some institutional transactions, which are sell-imbalanced, while genuinely retail transactions include more buys than sells. We observe from Table 1 that retail investors trade mostly at-the-money (72% of trades) or slightly-out-of-the-money (24%) options. The latter involves higher trading costs, with average quoted bid-ask spread of 28.7%. Furthermore, 14.2% of retail trades have a “micro\" size of up to $250, compared to 12.4% for non-SLIM trades, and their average quoted bid-ask spread is 23.6%. Descriptive statistics in Table 1 are similar for dollar volume shares, reportedinTableA9intheInternetAppendix. Theseobservationssuggestthatretail investors are entering the options market with an intent to speculate rather than hedge – a point made also in Lakonishok et al. (2007) and Bauer et al. (2009). All these results are very similar if we use the quote rule to classify trades and exclude open and close trades, as shown in Table A10 in the Internet Appendix. In Table 1, 11.7% of SLIM trades volume (or 1.8% based on the frequency share) are above $20,000. The literature on retail trading in equities typically considers such large trades to be institutional (starting from Lee and Radhakrishna (2000)). In our sample, these trades are indeed likely to be institutional. They are also large enough to have price impact: Table 1 shows that effective spreads exceed quoted spreads for these trades. We acknowledge thepresenceoffalsepositivesinourbaselinemeasureandthroughouttheInternetAppendix, we show the robustness of our subsequent results to using SLIM trades below $20,000 as an alternative proxy for retail trades. For example, Table A11 in the Internet Appendix shows the descriptive statistics of trades below $20,000, which are very similar to those without the size filter. We further discuss potential limitations of our measure of retail trading in options in Sections 1.5 and 3.5. We next explore how our measure of retail activity in the options market is related to the characteristics of options contracts and their underlying. To do that, we first run the following panel regression, separately for call and put options:22 SLIM Trading = γ0X +δ0C +α +µ +ε .

    "text": "volume difference in buy and sell SLIM trades scaled by the total volume of SLIM trades, corresponding to a buy or sell tilt in retail investor trades. Our vector of characteristics X includes the following ticker-level variables: log i,t dollar trading volume in options on t−1, log price on t−1, log total trading volume (lit, ATS, and non-ATS OTC) in the underlying stock or ETF over the previous week, relative spread in the underlying averaged over the previous week, volatility of the underlying returns over the previous week, and log market capitalization value as of t − 1. Our vector of contract characteristics C , equal-weighted at ticker i level, includes quoted spread, options i,t moneyness, their time to expiration in months, and leverage.23 We include ticker and date fixed effects, α and µ . Finally, we report descriptive statistics for all these variables in i t Table A12 in the Internet Appendix. Table 2 presents the results of estimating equation (1). A notable feature of SLIM trades is that retail investor share and order imbalance are higher in the options on the underlying with a larger market capitalization and a higher trading volume in the previous week. Thelatterisconsistentwithhigherretailparticipationinattention-grabbingsecurities. Furthermore, retail investors tend to prefer tickers with lower underlying price (and hence, cheaper options as well). In addition, retail trading is more prevalent in the options on more liquid stocks and ETFs. Earlier studies have documented similar relationships for the stock-level imbalances (see Boehmer et al. (2021) and Welch (2022)).24 Notably, we see that SLIM Imbalance in calls is likely to be higher in smaller stocks. However, we also see that our chosen set of characteristics has smaller overall explanatory power for imbalances. It suggests that most of the potential price pressure originated from retail investors in the options market seems to be unrelated to fundamentals. This is con- sistent with the retail flow being fairly balanced and, hence, attractive to market makers. A natural question to ask is how SLIM Share and SLIM Imbalance are related to other measures of retail activity. For options, we use small trades as another proxy for retail activity, a measure popular in the industry despite its caveats discussed above. We also consider a number of retail trading measures in equities, proposed in the recent litera- ture. These stock-level measures include retail trading imbalances (Boehmer et al. (2021)), breadth of Robinhood user ownership (Welch (2022) and Eaton et al. (2022b)), and counts of WallStreetBets ticker mentions (also Eaton et al. (2022b)). Due to data availability, we 23Resultsarenotsensitivetowhetherweuseequal-weightingorvolume-weightingforcontractcharacteristics at a ticker level. Furthermore, our results are robust to including implied volatility, trade size, delta, and other option Greeks, such as theta, vega, and gamma, into the list of contract-level controls. 24Both SLIM Share and Imbalance are also correlated with a quasi-Robinhood portfolio, designed to reflect retail-popular tickers. Portfolio weights are based on the previous total trading volume, following the general procedure of Welch (2022).

    "text": "non-ATS OTC transactions. Internalized trades for stocks are executed off lit exchanges, yet not in “dark pools\" (which are classified as ATS transactions). The non-ATS OTC trans- actions consist primarily of internalized order flow from retail and institutional customers of wholesalers. Table A14 in the Internet Appendix ranks market makers by their non-ATS OTC volume share. This ranking closely resembles the one in which we sort wholesalers by their share in PFOF. To the best of our knowledge, this measure has not been used in the extant literature to date. For more details, see Internet Appendix C.2. To understand the relationship between SLIM Share/Imbalance and other measures of retail activity, we run a panel regression similar to that in equation (1) but in addition, we consider other measures of retail activity, one at a time: SLIM Trading = βRetail +γ0X +δ0C +α +µ +ε , (2) i,t i,t i,t i,t i t i,t where Retail is one of the following measures of retail activity at a ticker level. sharesmall i,t is the volume share of trades up to 10 contracts for ticker i on date t (within call and put options), Internalized volume in underlying istheshareofnon-ATSOTC(i.e., internalized) i,t volume in the total trading volume of ticker i in the week of date t, Robinhood ownership breadth, log , is the logarithm of the number of Robinhood users holding the ticker i at the i,t end of date t, and WSB mentions, log , is the logarithm of the number of times ticker i was i,t mentioned on WallStreetBets forum on date t. We use the same set of controls for options contracts (C ) and their underlying (X ) as in equation (1). i,t i,t Table 3 presents the results of estimating equation (2). Our first observation is that the measures of retail trading are positively correlated with both SLIM Share and SLIM Imbalance in the cross-section. This provides some initial validation of our measure of retail trading in options, with the main tests and further supporting evidence presented in Sections 1.4 and 3. However, along with the ticker-level X and C characteristics and fixed effects, they explain only 7%–11% of the total variation in SLIM Share, showing very limited improvement over the explanatory power documented in Table 2. We note that only WallStreetBets mentions exhibit slightly negative correlation with SLIM Share (in calls), albeit they have a very strong relationship with SLIM Imbal- ance, suggesting that ticker popularity on the investor forum is indeed related to the overall buying pressure in both calls and puts, even after conditioning on all the contract and under- lying characteristics. The relationship between both SLIM Share and SLIM Imbalance with WallStreetBets mentions becomes particularly evident and highly statistically significant if we restrict the sample to micro-trades (of $250 or less), as we show in Internet Appendix C.3.

    "text": "document in this section. 1.4 SLIM trading during broker platform outages and trading re- strictions In this section, we exploit trading restrictions on retail platforms to validate our measureofretailtrading. Weusebothaggregate(timeseries)andstock-level(panel)trading restrictions, already introduced in the literature. First, we follow Eaton et al. (2022b) and Barber et al. (2022) to show that the retail trading share, as measured by SLIM Share, significantly decreases when retail broker platforms experience outages. Second, we follow Jones, Reed, and Waller (2021) to show that trading restrictions on particular tickers are also associated with a lower SLIM Share in those tickers. Combining two types of restrictions allows us to use both time-series and cross-sectional variation to validate SLIM, as well as mitigate concerns related to how we measure restrictions. Eaton et al. (2022b) and Barber et al. (2022) use the data on outages from Down- Detector.com26 and Robinhood incident history, respectively, to study the effects of retail trading in stock markets. The data of Eaton et al. covers more brokers, but it is not public. However, DownDetector.com reports the largest outages for each broker in our sample on its Twitter account. We hand-collect that data to construct a sample of outages covering large brokers from public sources. Details on how we construct this sample are presented in Internet Appendix D.1. We study the effects of outages on retail trading in a sample of the top 100 most mentioned tickers on WallStreetBets during our full sample period. The unprecedented volatility in certain stocks resulted in many retail brokers re- stricting trading in January 2021. Jones et al. (2021) study the effect of those restrictions on the overall stock and options trading activity. We identify the timing of restrictions in two ways. First, we precisely follow the timings reported in Table 1 of Jones et al., that cover the restrictions introduced by Robinhood and TD Ameritrade (and Charles Schwab) and are based on the snapshots from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. Second, since the snapshots from the Wayback Machine are infrequent, we refine the list of restrictions by manually searching for online posts related to the restrictions on Twitter and reddit.com. This allows us to make the starting and ending time more precise and to add more tickers to the sample. Further details and the table with the resultant restrictions for the second approach are reported in Internet Appendix D.2. To identify the effect of restrictions on the retail trading share, we estimate the 26DownDetector.com is the largest consolidator of outage data. 21 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

(3) i,t j j,i,t i,t i,d tod i,t j In the equation above, SLIM Share is the share of SLIM volume in the total volume of i,t trading in options on stock i in minute t. D(Brokerjrestricted) is a dummy variable j,i,t equal to 1 if broker j had a trading restriction on stock i in minute t. Since outages affect trading in all stocks on a broker platform, D(Brokerjrestricted) = 1 for all i if broker j j,i,t experiences an outage in minute t. X is a set of additional stock-level controls such as the i,t logarithm of total trading volume and the logarithm of stock price two days before minute t, as well as the change in log volume and log price from one day before minute t to minute t − 1. α are ticker by date fixed effects, and µ are time-of-the-day fixed effects.27 We i,d tod cluster standard errors by ticker and minute. We report estimation results with and without controls X , and our results are not sensitive to the exact definition of these controls. i,t Because outages occurred throughout our main sample, we include all days when estimating regression (3). In contrast, ticker-specific restrictions concentrated in January–March 2021, so we restrict the sample to 30 days before the start of the first restriction and 30 days after the end of the last restriction, although the results do not change if we use narrower estimation windows. Table 4 reports the estimation results. Consistent with SLIM picking up retail trades, we find that SLIM Share in a ticker is significantly lower in the minute when broker restric- tions are in place, both statistically and economically. Columns (1)–(2) reveal that when the largest retail brokers in options experience outages, SLIM Share is 0.6-0.74 percentage pointslowerinstocksandETFsmostpopularwithretailinvestors. Whenticker-levelrestric- tions are considered, the magnitudes are even larger. Column (3) shows that SLIM Share is up to 4.4 percentage points lower when Robinhood restricts trading, 2 percentage points lower when TD Ameritrade or Charles Schwab restrict trading, and over 6 percentage points lower when trading is restricted for all of them. This corresponds to a 27% drop relative to the average SLIM Share in affected tickers. Volume and price controls do not significantly change the estimates.28 In columns (5)–(6) we use a refined sample of restrictions, and find the same pattern and magnitude of the effects as those reported in columns (3)–(4) (with 27Whenusingticker-levelrestrictions,weareonlyabletoincludeα withα ,ortickeranddatefixedeffects, i d because of very limited intraday variation in the restrictions imposed by TD Ameritrade. Furthermore, using minute fixed effects instead of time-of-the-day fixed effects for ticker-level restrictions produces very similar results. 28Ticker-level restrictions and especially outages are likely to be exogenous to ticker-level retail trading shares. We include the recent stock price and trading volume changes as well as their lagged values to make sure that the estimates are stable. 22 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

    "text": "16.9% (per ticker). This implies that broker outages lead to a relative reduction in trading by 0.743/16.9 = 4.40%, with the 95% confidence interval of (1.31%,7.48%). Further assuming that both TD Ameritrade and Robinhood account for about 20% of retail trading volume in options,29 yields the following back-of-the-envelope estimate for the average retail share in SLIM: 4.40%/0.2 = 22.0%, with the confidence interval of (6.54%,37.43%). These estimates, however, are sensitive to the underlying assumptions of the model specification, and could be significantly affected by a) the fraction of retail investors who have multiple trading apps and could therefore switch to another one in case of an outage affecting a particular platform, andb)measurementerrorintheexacttimingoftheoutage. Indeed, givenourdata sources, it is unlikely that we measure the timing of both outages and ticker-level restrictions with perfect precision. Appendix D.4 further illustrates how model misspecification leads to an attenuation bias in the estimate of the retail share in SLIM. For example, assuming a 50% switching rate among trading app users, and a relative measurement error of 20% in the outage timing (and the same coefficient standard error), leads to an average estimate of retail share in SLIM of 52.78%, with a confidence interval of (21.90%,83.67%). With a relative measurement error of 50%, the average retail share estimate becomes 65.92%, with a confidence interval of (35.03%,96.80%), correspondingly. Finally, there is also a measurement error in the SLIM share arising from a sophisticated arbitrage strategy known as dividend play. Benefitting from the growth in retail investor presence, it has become so popular during our sample period that it dramatically inflates overall trading volume and reduces SLIM share in particular retail-popular tickers when it takes place (see Bryzgalova et al. (2022)). For ticker-level restrictions, our baseline is the sample of restricted stocks augmented with the sample of stocks with the top 100 number of mentions on WallStreetBets during the sample period. In Internet Appendix Table A22, we also report the results for two alternative samples: the sample of restricted stocks only and the baseline sample augmented with stocks with at least two retail herding events (frenzies) in the data of Barber et al. (2022).30 We deem stocks in the baseline sample to be most comparable to each other, although the estimates are stable across the samples. 1.5 Alternative measures of retail trading in options Our measure provides the first comprehensive classification of retail trades in the options market.

To address these concerns, we propose alternative measures of retail trading in options and compare their characteristics to those of SLIM trades. We argue that our findings extend to these more general proxies of retail participation. We start by considering several alternative measures of retail trading in options. The first measure, also proposed by Ernst and Spatt (2022), takes advantage of another way to “internalize\" retail orders, facilitated by exchanges. If an order is routed to a market maker whoisaDesignated/Primarymarketmaker(formerlyaspecialist)inatickeranditcurrently quotes at the NBBO, this market maker has priority to execute, at NBBO, any order of five contracts or fewer in full.31 That is, the Designated market maker can effectively internalize these orders. There are 16 options exchanges in the U.S., and for most tickers, a wholesaler can route a retail order of up to 5 contracts to an exchange in which it is a Designated market maker in that ticker. Our empirical proxy for these trades is single-leg electronic trades (OPRA trade type “AUTO\") of 5 contracts or fewer, priced at NBBO. Together with SLIM, these trades form our All Internalized measure. What fraction of retail trading volume do SLIM and All Internalized measures cap- ture? Toanswerthisquestion,wepresentaback-of-the-envelopecalculationofthewholesaler- intermediated trading volume using Rule 606 (PFOF) disclosures from the brokers in our sample. Specifically, we divide the total monthly dollar PFOF from Rule 606 reports for each order category – market, marketable limit, non-marketable limit, and other orders – by an average PFOF per contract in that category, which yields the PFOF-implied trading vol- ume.32 The estimates of the Rule 606 implied trading volume and their splits by order type are presented in Table 5. The total Rule 606 implied trading volume computed in column (1) of Table 5 establishes a useful estimate of the volume of the wholesaler-intermediated retail transactions. Retail trading accounts for 48.1% of the total market volume. There is no estimate of retail volume in the literature to compare this number to, yet to us it is striking that retail investor presence is so high in the market commonly thought to be dominated by sophisticated and/or institutional traders. By contrasting columns (2) and (6) of Table 5, we conclude that the SLIM method- ology identifies between 63% (June 2021) and 87% (March 2020) of trading volume from market and marketable limit orders reported in Rule 606 disclosures. To capture the re- maining market and marketable limit orders, we next consider the expanded measure, or All 31See e.g., https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/cboeedgx/2018/34-84697-ex5.pdf, paragraph (g)(2), or https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/05/20/2021-10579/self-regulatory-organizations-box- exchange-llc-notice-of-filing-and-immediate-effectiveness-of-a#citation-17-p27492, Rule 7135(c)(2)(iii). 32We thank the anonymous referee for suggesting this calculation to us. 25 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

Table 5 reveals that the All Internalized trading volume exceeds Rule 606 implied volume originating from market and marketable limit orders. We view this as evidence that the internalized trading volume includes some volume from non-marketable limit orders (from SLIM specifically because the remaining All Internalized trades are all marketable). Barardehi, Bernhardt, Da, and Warachka (2021) argue that in equity markets wholesalers find it profitable to internalize a fraction of non-marketable orders. Since quoted spreads in equities are much tighter than in options, and, moreover, since quoted spreads in options are so wide – the average quoted and effective spreads for SLIM transactions are 13.7% and 6.7%, respectively (see Table 1) – we expect that a fraction of non-marketable limit orders in options does get internalized through SLIM. It is evident from Table 5, however, that both the SLIM and All Internalized method- ologies do not pick up all retail trades. The omitted trades are likely to be non-marketable limit orders that wholesalers send to the limit order book on an exchange.

    "text": "attempt to construct an All Retail measure, which captures additionally transactions orig- inating from non-marketable orders that are not captured by SLIM. The literature to date has not offered a reliable method to classify such trades in the OPRA data, and we therefore propose our own. We start from the measure of retail trading used in the industry, small trades (i.e., transactions of up to 10 contracts). As we have discussed in Section 1.3, the small trades measure overstates retail presence, and we therefore attempt to reduce the num- ber of false positives. In our All Retail (small) measure, we include only a fraction of small trades, namely, single-leg electronic trades under 10 contracts. The latter are our proxy for non-marketable retail orders sent to the limit order book. We note that we can identify single-leg electronic trades accurately using the new OPRA trade flags. By construction, All Retail (small) measure includes all of All Internalized transactions. The new generation of retail options investors is likely to be cash constrained. FINRA (2021a) reports that more than twice as many new investors who opened brokerage accounts in 2020 held account balances less than $500 (33%) when compared to experienced entrants (16%), and more than five times as many when compared to existing account owners (6%). This is why we follow Barber, Odean, and Zhu (2009b) and Brandt, Brav, Graham, and Kumar (2010) and use a $5,000 trade size cutoff as an additional way to define retail trades. In our All Retail (small + cheap) measure, we broaden our All Retail (small) measure by including“cheap\"trades, definedassingle-legelectronictransactionsofupto$5,000. Table5 shows that All Retail (small) captures 70% of the Rule 606 implied trading volume, while All Retail (small + cheap) slightly overshoots it, exceeding it by 11%. To examine whether SLIM transactions are similar to those constituting our broader measures of retail trading, we first compare their descriptive statistics. In Internet Ap- pendix E, we provide the descriptive statistics for All Internalized and All Retail measures and show that they are generally in line with those for SLIM trades, reported in Table 1 (also reported in Tables A7 and A8 in the Internet Appendix). Specifically, they also demonstrate a strong investor preference for ultra short-term (weekly) options and for calls over puts. In terms of trade direction, All Internalized and All Retail (small) measures also show that investors write more options than they buy, although the difference is small and it reverses for the All Retail (small + cheap) measure. We next conduct validation tests, described in Section 1.4, in which we seek to check whether All Internalized and both All Retail measures drop during outages experienced by the two largest U.S. retail brokerages. Table A29 in the Internet Appendix confirms that it is indeed the case. The results are strong for the All Internalized measure. They weaken for our broader measures, All Retail (small) and All Retail (small + cheap). This is to be expected. As we expand the retail trading measures by including more transactions, we 27 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

Yet, the coefficients on the dummy variables for TD Ameritrade’s and both brokers’ outages remain consistently negative, even for our broadest measures. Similarly to SLIM, they all fall by around 1 percentage point. Weobtainsimilarresultsforavalidationtestinvolvingtradingrestrictionsimposedby retail brokerages on a number of tickers that are popular with retail investors. Specifically, we estimate regression (3) using our broader measures of retail trading in options rather than SLIM. Table A30 in the Internet Appendix reports the results. Similar to SLIM, all the measures of retail trading are more than 6 percentage points lower when broker restrictions are in place. We find mostly negative but insignificant reductions in retail share under TD Ameritrade restrictions, although the coefficients on D(TDrestricted) are not significantly different from those for SLIM. The results are similar irrespective of the chosen sample of tickers (see Tables A31 and A32 in the Internet Appendix). Finally, we look at comovement of our All Internalized and All Retail measures with established retail investor popularity indicators. The results are reported in Tables A33, A34, and A35 in the Internet Appendix, which are the analogs of Table 3 for SLIM. Panels A of the tables show that our broader measures are, like SLIM, mostly positively corre- lated with measures of retail activity, such as Small Share, internalized volume in equities, Robinhood breadth of ownership, and WallStreetBets mentions. As evident from panel B, imbalances in our All Internalized and All Retail measures, for the most part, are also positively correlated with the measures of retail activity. We attribute the weakening of these results relative to their analogs for SLIM to the fact that our broader proxies for retail trading – All Internalized, All Retail (small), and All Retail (small + cheap) – are noisier measures of retail trading than SLIM. Overall, our alternative measures of retail trading are consistent with what we find for SLIM. Yet, the evidence in favor of them representing a clean cross-section of retail transactions is weaker. To date, there is no reliable identification method for non-marketable retail orders submitted to the limit order book. Our main concern with the broader measures we propose above is that, while they include limit orders of retail investors, they contain false positives as well. In particular, they may include institutional trades of smaller sizes. Fortunately, OPRA trade flags can help detect some institutional orders broken into smaller trades by execution algorithms, such as the ISO flag we discussed in Section 1.3 and Internet Appendix A.6. However, other split orders are likely to appear in our data under the plain vanilla flags such as single-leg electronic trades. Furthermore, our measures likely pick up genuine small trades of professional or semi-professional investors, such as those we see in index options. In the analysis that follows, to reduce false positives, we stick to our SLIM 28 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

    "text": "methodology for identifying retail transactions. 2 Aggregate performance of retail investors in the U.S. options market In this section, we examine the aggregate performance of retail investors in the U.S. options market. We document that investors lose money after transaction costs, with most of the losses concentrating in long positions in short-term options. Finally, we show that call imbalances in SLIM trading positively predict next-day returns on the underlying stocks. 2.1 Dollar performance of SLIM trades We compute dollar performance of each retail trade j over the horizon of h days, as follows: $Perf = Direction ×Size ×100×(Price −Price ), (4) hj j j j,t+h j,t where Size is the size of the trade in contracts,33 Price is the price of the traded j j,t+h contract at t + h, Price is the price of the traded contract at t,34 and Direction is the j,t j trade direction sign: 1 for buy trades and −1 for sell trades. We consider horizons h of one, two, five, and 10 days, as well as until the contract expiration.35 We also report the intraday performance, which is until the close of the trade day. We evaluate the contribution of gross performance and transaction costs separately. Tocomputethegrossperformance, weusemidpointprices: Trademidquote , orthebid-ask j,t midquoteatthetimeofthetrade, forPrice andClosemidquote , ortheclosemidquote j,t j,t+h of the traded contract on day t+h as reported by OptionMetrics, for Price .

We do not j,t j,t+h j,t+h explicitly consider trading costs paid as investors close their positions because some of them are held to expiration.

    "text": "By ignoring trading costs at the end of the performance evaluation horizon, we are providing an upper bound for investor net performance. We aggregate the trade-level performance defined in equation (4) into the total re- tail portfolio and report its daily average dollar performance in Table 6 (panel A). We also compute the performance of the buy and sell portfolios separately (panel B) by summing up the dollar performance of trades with the implied buy and sell direction, correspondingly. These calculations are consistent with the buy, sell, and buy-minus-sell portfolio perfor- mance calculations in Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean (2009a). We also report performance of trades aggregated over several dimensions specific to options such as contract type (call retail portfolio versus put retail portfolio), moneyness, and time to expiration. Table 6 summarizes the daily mean performance of retail investor options trades. Even though performance before transaction costs of the buy-minus-sell portfolio in panel A is positive across horizons, ranging from $10.2 to $13.0 million per day, adding the observed transaction costs makes it significantly negative, between -$5.2 and -$1.6 million per day. Theliteraturehasdocumentedthatoptionwritingstrategiesgenerallydeliverpositive average returns and large CAPM alphas (see, e.g., Broadie, Chernov, and Johannes (2009) andreferencesthereinforarecentstudyandJagannathanandKorajczyk(1986)foranearlier contribution). Consistent with this result, the average gross performance of the sell portfolio in our sample is positive.36 The average performance of the sell portfolio is positive even net of the observed transaction costs, although, with the exception of intraday performance, not statistically different from zero. On the other hand, the buy portfolio incurs losses on average, even on a gross basis. Directionally, this is exactly what one would expect from the theta exposure: because a long option position loses its value as time passes, buy (sell) trades should have a negative (positive) performance, on average. Table A36 in the Internet Appendix reports the aggregate performance between November 2019 and June 2021. Under the assumption of a 10-day holding period, retail investors lost $2.13 billion on their options trades. Similar to the mean daily results in Table 6, the aggregate losses were concentrated in buy trades, at-the-money contracts, call contracts, and in contracts with less than a week to expiration. In Table A37 in the Internet Appendix, we report the overall trade performance by month and day of the week. Retail investor losses are not concentrated in any particular 36We find the opposite for performance to expiration: investors lose on their short positions and gain on the long ones. This sign flip is mostly driven by large price movements affecting contracts expiring in 3-12 months (see Table A41 in the Internet Appendix, which decomposes performance by contract type, time to expiration, and trade direction). This is consistent with Broadie et al. (2009), who find that options returns mightbe strongly skewed in small samplesand recommend studying delta-hedged returns instead. Accordingly, we find no sign flip in delta- and fully hedged reported performance in Internet Appendix F.9. 30 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

The same table reveals that, on average, investor performance seems to be lower when the holding period includes the end of the week. Table A38 in the Internet Appendix reveals the top and bottom 10 tickers, based on the aggregate net performance of trades originated by retail customers and those of the whole market. Similar to the latter, retail investors realized a gain on such large-cap names as Nvidia (NVDA), Alibaba (BABA), and Moderna (MRNA). Interestingly, however, in contrasttothemarket, theylostontradingin“meme\"stocks, suchasGameStop(GME)and AMC Entertainment (AMC), and on some popular mega-cap names such as Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN). In general, 100 most retail-popular companies as measured by their mentions on the WallStreetBets forum account for almost 50% of investor losses in our sample (see Table A39 in the Internet Appendix).

The dollar performance measure, considered so far, is our preferred performance in- dicator because it reveals where the aggregate retail losses come from and also allows us to compare performance in the types of contracts SLIM investors prefer trading, or in other words, where most of SLIM trading volume is. 2.2 Profitability of SLIM trades To compare profitability of SLIM trades relative to that of our broader proxies for retail trading, All Internalized and All Retail, which include more trades, we need to appro- priately scale the dollar performance measure. We therefore compute per-dollar performance of retail trades, that is, investor returns or profitability of their trades.

    "text": "options they write, that is, it is as options textbooks would define it. Short positions can be netted against long. Formally, the daily gross/net profitability with leverage is computed as the daily gross/net performance of a portfolio at a given horizon divided by the absolute value of the net position of that portfolio (total purchased minus total sold). Our measure without leverage follows that in Barber et al. and assumes that each short position requires investor to deposit the entire proceeds from shorting as collateral, which earns zero interest. Under this definition, no netting is allowed and even a fully hedged short option position requires the same collateral as a naked one. Formally, the daily gross/net profitability without leverage is computed as the daily gross/net performance of a portfolio at a given horizon divided by the absolute value of daily dollar trading volume in that portfolio. Weviewtheabovedefinitionsofprofitabilityastwoextremes. Itisclearlynotpossible for a retail investor’s portfolio to have unlimited leverage, which the first definition implicitly permits. At the same time, the second definition could be too conservative. For example, covered calls are common retail investor strategies, which were already popular in the 1990s (see Lakonishok et al. (2007)) and are viewed by the new generation of retail investors as a way to earn extra income for a user who is “holding the underlying anyway\" (see Internet Appendix F.8 for more evidence from investor forums). Retail brokers would net the option position from the position in the underlying and deposit the proceeds from selling a covered call option at the time of the sale. Tables A42–A43 in the Internet Appendix present retail trades profitability under both definitions. Under the first definition that permits leverage, investors’ returns over any horizon are hugely volatile and large in absolute value (Table A42). The magnitudes of mean daily returns range from 50% to 147% for gross profitability and from -138% to 418% for net profitability over the same return horizons that we have assumed for dollar performance. These return patterns are consistent with the literature. For example, Broadie et al. (2009) argue that because options embed leverage and have highly nonlinear payoffs, standard statistics applied to options portfolios look rather extreme. We find that gross profitability is positive and significant for the horizons of up to one day and it is statisti- cally indistinguishable from zero beyond that. Net profitability is also highly negative and significant for horizons of up to one day and then becomes indistinguishable from zero. Under the assumption of no leverage, SLIM investors lose between 29 and 41 cents per 100 dollars of trading over the same return horizons that we have assumed for dollar performance (Tables A43), while net profitability to expiration is positive 39 bps, yet not statistically different from zero. If we consider portfolios by trade and contract features, net profitability is mostly indistinguishable from zero. A notable exception is the portfolio of contracts with less than a week to expiration, which incurs significant losses at all holding 33 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

    "text": "periods. The differences between the results delivered by the two definitions are quite drastic. It seems to us that the definition without leverage is perhaps too conservative for an options portfolio and actual investor portfolio returns are closer to those in the definition with leverage (although they would not be so extreme, given that in reality retail brokerage platforms do impose some margin/collateral requirements). One important limitation of our performance calculation is that, as we have remarked earlier, SLIM captures primarily market and marketable limit orders and leaves out the majority of non-marketable limit orders. By using liquidity-demanding marketable orders as our proxy for retail orders, we are biasing our sample towards costlier transactions and hence are potentially overestimating the extent of investor losses. We acknowledge this concern and attempt to address it by comparing the profitability of SLIM trades to that of broader measures of retail trading that we introduced in Section 1.5. To compare profitability of SLIM trades to that of All Internalized and All Retail ones, we adopt the profitability definition that involves leverage, as it delivers options returns that are more consistent with the literature. Table A44 in the Internet Appendix reports the results of the difference in means tests of daily net profitability of each of our broader measures and that of SLIM. It is clear from the tables that profitability of All Internalized and both All Retail trades is not statistically different from that of SLIM trades at the 1% level. This piece of evidence lends additional support to the claim that our SLIM measure of retail trading is similar to the alternative, albeit noisier, proxies. 2.3 Trading costs and other drivers of underperformance In our data, we do not observe stock holdings of investors, and they may possibly be engaging in strategies involving both options and the underlying stocks. For example, they may fully hedge their short options positions due to the restrictions on naked short positions typically imposed by brokerages. By full hedging we mean delta-hedging with the hedge ratio equal to 1 at all times. Furthermore, from the statistical viewpoint, options returns are quite extreme and standard statistics computed based on raw returns in finite samplesareproblematic, whilethosebasedondelta-hedgedreturnsaremoreinformative(see Broadie et al. (2009), Zhan, Han, Cao, and Tong (2022), and references therein). In Internet Appendix F.9, we compute fully hedged and delta-hedged performance of SLIM trades in our sample. Tables A45 and A46, which are analogous to Table 6, summarize our results for those two performance measures and demonstrate that they both deliver very similar results to our baseline ones.

    "text": "portfolios, which now contain a stock leg, is more extreme than in our baseline analysis. We attribute this to the run-up in the stock market during our sample period. As a robustness check, we have computed market-adjusted performance instead, and performance of both the buy and sell portfolios is much more in line with that in Table 6. As for the aggregate dollar performance, if all SLIM investors were delta-hedged (fully hedged), their 10-day net performance in our sample would have been -$2.3 billion (-$4.5 billion). Regardless of the chosen measure of performance, the losses in short-term options contracts are significant and contribute the most to the aggregate retail performance. We therefore study retail performance in these contracts in a multivariate setup. In Internet Appendix F.10, we estimate regressions similar to specification (2) in Section 1.3 but with SLIM performance as a dependent variable. We find that, even conditional on ticker and contract characteristics, retail investors who buy the short-term contracts are likely to expe- rience losses. Equity-based retail activity proxies are positively associated with performance, but only on a gross basis: They turn negative and mostly insignificant as soon as trading costs are taken into account. Finally, our estimates also suggest that contracts with a larger retail presence, as measured by SLIM Share, have negative net performance on average. Our analysis thus far has not taken direct transaction costs into account. Some of the brokerages in our sample, such as Robinhood, offer commission-free options trading. However, the majority of brokerages still charge around $.65 per contract.37 Using the fractionofPFOFinoptionspaidtoRobinhoodastheupperboundoftheirshareintheretail options trading (the share based on the Rule 606 implied trading volume is very similar), we can therefore estimate the aggregate direct transaction costs paid by retail investors. Using 1.93 million contracts as the aggregate SLIM volume and 25% as Robinhood’s average share in PFOF for options, the direct transaction costs of retail trades in our sample period amount to $0.65 ×1.93×106 ×0.75 ≈ $941 million. Even though indirect transaction costs are already included into the net performance figures we report, we find it useful to highlight their total value in our sample. It is computed by summing up the products of effective half-spread and trade size across all SLIM trades, resulting in around $6.5 billion.38 These costs are not as transparent as brokerage fees and are likely to be overlooked by retail investors. Furthermore, they become revenue for market makers and exchanges executing retail orders (rather than for retail brokerages). These costs are economically large, being almost seven times the direct costs of retail trading. 37As ofMarch 2022, TDAmeritrade, CharlesSchwab, E*TRADE, andFidelity allcharge$.65 per contract, according to their websites. Some of the brokers provide commission discounts for frequent traders or for large transactions. However, given the stylized features of retail trading highlighted in Table 1, these discounts are unlikely to have a material impact on our estimates. 38To put this number into perspective, the total PFOF in options in our sample is around $2.8 billion. 35 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

    "text": "Our calculation approach captures the actual gains and losses of retail trading and does not require any assumptions regarding their opportunity costs. One limitation of our data is that some trades might come from multi-leg strategies involving options as well as underlying equities (e.g., a covered call), and we do not observe equity legs of these transactions. However, since the retail investor boom in our sample is largely driven by novice investors, we believe that only a small fraction of them uses such sophisticated strategies. Therefore, it should have little impact on our aggregate retail performance estimates. The literature has suggested that investors may learn through trading (see, e.g., Seru, Shumway, and Stoffman (2010) and Linnainmaa (2011)). We use the results presented in Table A37 in the Internet Appendix to study whether retail investor performance in the later parts of the sample is better than in the earlier ones. We find that, on the contrary, retail investors lost more money in the later subsample, especially in January and February of 2021, around the GameStop frenzy. This could happen if retail investors do not learn from their trading experience.39 A more likely explanation, however, is the changing composition of the investor base. While some of the poor-performing early investors could have exited the sample, it seems that their attrition was more than compensated by the entry of new retail investors in the later months. After all, in 2021 alone, the account base of Robinhood almost doubled, increasing from 11.7 to 21.3 million, according to the company’s quarterly reports. 2.4 SLIM trading and stock return predictability Recent findings on retail investor frenzies during the pandemic indicate that retail or- der imbalances in equities positively predict next-day returns (see Jones, Zhang, and Zhang (2022)). Yet, there have been no studies evaluating the spillover of retail trading in options on the returns of the underlying. At the same time, there is a large and growing literature that documents that information contained in option returns has predictive power for the dynamics of the underlying assets, typically by reflecting informed trading or due to the relaxation of leverage constraints (see Cremers and Weinbaum (2010), Pan and Poteshman (2006), Xing, Zhang, and Zhao (2010), An, Ang, Bali, and Cakici (2014), Ge, Lin, and Pear- son (2016), Augustin, Brenner, and Subrahmanyam (2019), Weinbaum, Fodor, Muravyev, and Cremers (2022)). Is SLIM trading indicative of the future returns on the underlying 39Prior studies also suggest that investors learn worse after experiencing financial losses, in active trading (relative to observing other people decisions) and when they are emotionally involved in decision-making. See Kuhnen (2015) and references therein. It would be interesting to extend our data and test these potential mechanisms for the performance of the new generation of retail investors. 36 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

Table7reportsthepredictabilityofdailystockreturnsbySLIMImbalanceincalland put options estimated via panel regressions with fixed effects and double-clustered standard errors (by ticker and date). We consider several versions of the key independent variable: the level of SLIM Imbalance, its innovation relative to the previous day, computed as the change in SLIM Imbalance over two consecutive days, and the ticker-specific quantile of the previous day’s SLIM Imbalance relative to its levels over the previous trading month. The latter proxy allows us to better reflect the level of the previous day’s SLIM Imbalance compared to the overall directional retail trading over the recent period of time. All our specifications also control for the options trading volume, implied volatility, the market capitalization of the stock, as well as the contemporaneous market return. We also include Amihud (2002) liquidity measure because of the short prediction horizon. All the specifications in Table 7 indicate that a higher SLIM Imbalance in calls tends to forecast a higher return on the underlying stock over the next trading day. While this effect is present for both levels and innovations in call SLIM Imbalance, it is particularly pronounced for changes in the SLIM Imbalance over the previous day. We see no significant impact of the call order imbalance on weekly or monthly returns, although the signs of the coefficients remain the same.

    "text": "to the low statistical power of the tests, given a relatively short sample. We also see no significant impact of SLIM Imbalance in put trading on the return on the underlying. We attribute this to the fact that retail trading is largely concentrated in calls, and therefore, being relatively large economically, it is more likely to have a price impact propagated through those contracts. There are several channels through which volume imbalance in options could have an impact on the returns of the underlying stocks: hedging demand by the wholesalers and/or intermediaries, the relaxation of short-selling constraints, and the reflection of informed trading by retail investors. Given the short-term nature of predictability, its origination in call options, and all our other findings regarding SLIM behavior and performance in Sections 2 and 3, this predictability relationship seems to be more in line with the price pressure caused by the hedging demand of the intermediaries servicing retail order flow. 3 Additional support for SLIM as a measure of retail trading In this section, we offer additional suggestive evidence that our measure captures retail trading in the U.S. options market and discuss remaining limitations. 3.1 SLIM trading on option expiration days First, we exploit the fact that some U.S. retail brokerages handle expiring options on their clients’ accounts in a rule-based manner. For example, Robinhood attempts to exercise in-the-money options (if the account has enough buying power) or sells the contract approximately one hour before the market close (if it does not).40 This gives us a testable prediction for our measure of retail trading in contracts on their expiration day: We expect to see an imbalance in the direction of sell trades in the last one or two trading hours of the day. To test this prediction, we study volume share of buy and sell trades in each trading hour on option expiration day. On expiration days, as Table A49 in the Internet Appendix reports, there is a sig- nificantly larger sell volume share in SLIM trades in the last two hours of the trading day.

(2022). In particular, we estimate equation (2) using a dummy for the Robinhood herding event in ticker i on date t instead of Retail . This analysis is performed on a subsample of our data (November 4, 2019, to i,t August 10, 2020) due to availability of Robintrack data with which the investor frenzies are identified. TableA51intheInternetAppendixdocumentshigherSLIMImbalanceduringRobin- hood herding events. We also find that the correlation is the highest for SLIM trades sized below $5,000. Importantly, imbalances in MLIM, all multi-leg and large trades are not positively related to frenzies. Our results even show negative correlations, suggesting that other types of investors, most likely professional traders or institutions, trade against retail investors during such events. Overall, we document that during the well-publicized investor frenzies there were directional order imbalances in retail trading in options as well. 3.3 SLIM trading around stock splits Aswehavediscussedearlier, thenewgenerationofretailoptionsinvestorsisalsomore likely to be cash constrained. Micro SLIM trades (below $250) should therefore reflect the activity of cash-constrained investors, and we expect to see large changes in trading volume in these transactions around stock splits.41 Note that stock splits should have minimal effect on investor positions in the underlying, because trading fractional shares is permitted on most popular investment platforms during our sample period. In contrast, stock splits may still affect retail investors in options because trading fractional options contracts is not permitted. We perform a simple event study, reported in Internet Appendix G.3, where we focus on two companies popular with retail investors, Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA), that executed stock splits on the same day, August 28, 2020. We find that micro-sized SLIM trading volume on these two names went up significantly relative to a control group of companies popular with retail investors that did not go through a stock split. Figure A6 in the Internet Appendix also documents that the distribution of trade dollar sizes within SLIM trades changes after the split, consistent with the presence of cash constraints: After the split, we see a significantly larger share of trades of smaller sizes, corresponding to an 41We thank Yang Liu for suggesting this test. 39 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

InInternetAppendixG.3, wealsoconsiderallstockssplitsinoursampleperiod and document that an increase in micro SLIM volume is positively related to the size of the split. In this full sample of splits, we find similar changes in the distribution of SLIM trade sizes after the event as for AAPL and TSLA. All this evidence strongly suggests that SLIM trades, especially of micro sizes, are likely to be originated by cash-constrained investors. 3.4 Suboptimal exercise by SLIM investors In our last validation exercise, we show that SLIM investors are less likely to exercise their options optimally.42 We rely on the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to determine whether it is optimal to exercise a call option early, before the underlying goes ex-dividend. Denote the expected ex-dividend price of an option by c , its strike by K, and the current (cum- ex dividend) underlying stock price by S. The expected option ex-dividend price represents the expected time value of the option. Early exercise value (EEV) is therefore the difference betweenthecurrentstockprice,strike,andthisexpectedtimevalueoftheoption: S−K−c . ex The details of the computation of c are in Internet Appendix G.4. ex In the following analyses, we restrict our sample to call option contracts that are optimal to exercise on cum-dates and refer to it as the early exercise sample. The details of its construction are provided in Internet Appendix G.5, and Table A53 in the Internet Appendix presents the descriptive statistics.

    "text": "contract in the week preceding the cum-date raises the fraction unexercised by about 1 percentage point, depending on the specification. This result is robust, and the magnitudes of the coefficients of interest do not significantly change as we relax the specification of fixed effects and switch on ticker-level controls instead (see columns (4)–(5)). In sum, we conclude that a higher SLIM Share is associated with a higher fraction of open interest left suboptimally unexercised by the ex-dividend date. We also see that there is no such association for other trade types such as MLIM, all multi-leg, and large trades. Table A54 in the Internet Appendix summarizes these results. 3.5 Further limitations of the SLIM methodology Finally, we discuss the remaining limitations of using SLIM trades to detect retail trading in the U.S. options market. First, our methodology likely omits trades of semi- professional traders, such as those that do not go through a wholesaler and instead are sent directly to exchanges (for example, those originated on Interactive Brokers) and those that constitute complex strategies (e.g., bull spreads, straddles, and butterfly spreads). Complex strategies typically require multi-leg transactions, and, therefore, wholesalers looking for price improvement would usually execute them via multi-leg price improvement auctions, as opposed to single-leg ones. In the OPRA data, these transactions appear as a trade type “MLAN\" (multi-leg non-ISO price improvement mechanism), and we refer to them as MLIM for consistency. These MLIM trades correspond to about 4% of the total market volume, and they are composed primarily of trades of ‘protail’ investors – small professional investors and hedge funds – albeit some may be those of retail investors. We have also computed mentions of multi-leg strategies on WallStreetBets in our sample period and found that those constitute a very small number relative to the mentions of individual tickers and comments overall. In addition, in Internet Appendix G.7, we report descriptive statistics and cross-sectional correlations of MLIM with the equity-based measures of retail activity. It further demonstrates that these trades are clearly quite different in nature to those going through single-leg actions. Since we want to capture trading of the new generation of retail investors, we are hesitant to include MLIM trades in our analysis.44 Second, our measure likely includes some false positives. 11.7% of the SLIM volume is concentrated in transactions with over $20,000 in value (see Table 1), which is considered a cutoff for retail trades in the related literature on equities (see, e.g., Lee and Radhakrishna (2000)). We therefore exclude trades above $20,000 in our robustness checks. Table A16 in the Internet Appendix confirms that the results are virtually the same. Furthermore, the 44Furthermore, Tables A57 and A58 in the Internet Appendix demonstrate that all multi-leg trades taken together and trades above $50,000 are also clearly different from SLIM trades. 42 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

Itisreassuring, however, thatinindependentcontemporaneouswork,ErnstandSpatt (2022) rely on the same empirical strategy to classify retail trades in the options market. Their findings are complementary to ours, as they focus on the order execution quality and market microstructure. 4 Concluding remarks This paper focuses on the recent boom in retail investor trading in options, driven by young and tech-savvy, yet inexperienced, investors. Exploiting a new OPRA reporting requirement, we develop a novel measure of retail investor trading in options and document a rapid rise in retail investor trading in our sample. We argue that retail investors enter the options market for speculative reasons. They prefer options with very short maturities, primarily calls. These contracts have high relative bid-ask spreads, making the options business a very lucrative one for wholesalers that execute retail order flow. This is further supported by the ballooning PFOF for options received by retail brokerages. Our paper calls for more transparency in reporting wholesaler activities in the options market,consistentwiththecurrentrequirementbyFINRAinequities. Inparticular,itwould be useful to know how often market makers affiliated with wholesalers get order allocations through price improvement auctions. One particularly fruitful avenue for future research is uncovering the barriers to entry in this market and characterizing the optimal market structure. We would not be the first ones calling for more transparency in trading costs in zero- commission offers of retail brokerages.45 However, most prior calls were related to equities. Trading costs in options are orders of magnitude higher, so a regulatory requirement to disclose these costs to investors would be a welcome first step. FrequenttradingproduceslargeorderflowandrevenuefromPFOFforretailinvesting platforms. Trading assets that are less liquid, such as options, enhances these profits further. This may create an incentive for retail brokerages to encourage more trading in less liquid asset classes or securities. Policymakers should be aware of this potential conflict of interest. An advantage of our retail trading measure is that it allows us to capture a large 45Regulators have long been interested in various aspects of the system of payment for order flow and, in particular,whetherinternalizationofordersreallyprovidespriceimprovementfortheclients.

In particular, we consider two scenarios. The first is when a customer order is paired in an auction and the wholesaler-affiliated market maker trades gets the full alloca- tion (i.e., the auction is not broken). In the second scenario, a customer order is paired in an auction and an unaffiliated market maker trades in full (i.e., the auction is broken as an unaffiliated market maker provides a better price). 55 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

The algorithm aims to reconstruct the full originating ISO order, that is, merge together all the transactions most likely pertaining to the same initiating order. We start by isolating all the ISO trades in the same contract executed on the same date. In the second step, we rely on the K-means algorithm to identify clusters of similar trades that occur within a short period of time (that is, we consider trades clustered over time distance from the start of the trading day, measured in nanoseconds, as per OPRA convention). To do this, we select the smallest number of groups that produces the average within-cluster time distance of below one second. In other words, we aggregate ISO trades within the same contract into the smallest possible number of groups, such that the average time distance between trades within each group is up to one second. At the same time, we aim for the maximal between-group time distance if there are several groupings satisfying the first criterion. Finally, we bunch together trades that belong to a single group, that is, we attribute all the transactions within a corresponding group to a single originating ISO order. As Table A6 shows, most of the trading volume in bunched trades is in the originating transactions above 100 lots in size and almost half of their dollar volume is in transactions above $50,000. These features of the reconstructed full ISO trades are in stark contrast to the set of their separate elements, as reported in OPRA data, for which only about a third of volume is in trades above 100 lots and only a fifth of dollar volume is in trades above $50,000. 57 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

    "text": "C.4 WallStreetBets mentions and ticker popularity To generate the measure of ticker mentions on WallStreetBets and its popularity, weusethedataon WallStreetBetspostsandcommentsavailablefromthePushshiftReddit Dataset, matched with the MSENAMES dataset from CRSP. Pushshift is a social media data collection and analysis platform. In particular, their Reddit dataset is the largest publicly available Reddit dataset, continuously updated in real time since 2015 and available via monthly dump files and an API.46 We use monthly dump filesfortheperiodofNovember2019toJune2021tocollectbothoriginalsubmissions(posts) and comments. First, we collect submissions in the subreddit WallStreetBets that have Daily Dis- cussionthreadinthetitle. Foreachsubmissionweobservethefollowing: auniquesubmission identifier, author, timestamp of the post, title, description of the post, and the total number of comments. In addition, we include posts from the Unpinned Daily Discussion Thread, which is available on some of the days. Second, using the WallStreetBets subreddit filter and the unique identifier from each submission, we then extract all the comments for each post. In particular, we collect the following: a unique comment identifier, a unique submission identifier for the post the commentwasmadefor,theidentifierofanothercommentifitwasareply,author,timestamp, full text of the comment, and the number of upvotes. To match ticker mentions to our sample, we rely on the MSENAMES list of tickers from CRSP and apply additional filters. First, we only include active tickers in the sample (starting in November 2019). Second, we exclude tickers which names coincide with the commonlyusedwordsintheWallStreetBets forum: NEW,USA,GDP,EOD,ONE,TWO, WANT, BUY, HOLD, SELL, GO, CPI, EPS, FREE, ALL, DD, RH, AI, ATH, API, BEAT, BTC, CEO, CDC, COLD, DATA, DCF, DD, DM, GDP, GF, GOOD, GOV, EOD, ETH, EV, HF, IP, IPO, IQ, IRS, IV, JAN, LIFE, LTD, PSA, PE, NYC, MRNA, PS, RH, ROI, SF, TA, TV, UI, UK, USA, WIN, WOW, WSB, YOLO, AND, TO, THE, IS, YOU, MOON, THIS, ON, TD, IT, FOR, CNBC, ARE, GET, IN, LINE. For each of the remaining tickers, we first count the number of times a particular ticker is mentioned on all the comments within a 10-minute interval. We then aggregate this data to a hourly and daily level. Tickers can be mentioned at the start of the sentence, at the end, or somewhere in the middle. In case of the latter, we require ticker name to be separated by a space from the previous and following letters. Moreover, we only look for the ticker mentions in uppercase letters and replace non-alphanumeric characters with spaces to 46See https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/ and https://github.com/pushshift/api, correspondingly. 69 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

    "text": "D Broker outages D.1 Constructing the sample of broker outages Our sample of outages is manually constructed from several public sources. For outages on Robinhood, we follow Barber et al. (2022) and use incident history fromRobinhood’swebsite.47 Incidenthistoryincludestheexacttimewhenanoutagestarted and ended, as well as the services that were affected. For all other brokers, we mainly rely on Twitter. The start time of an outage is typi- callyreportedinpostsfromDownDetector.com. Suchpoststypicallyincludethenameofthe broker whose platform is experiencing an outage and the time when the outage started (ac- cording to the data of DownDetector.com, which is based on user reports to the website and posts on Twitter). Users frequently comment on such posts, stipulating the range of actions that they are not able to perform. See, for example, a tweet reporting TD Ameritrade’s out- ageonNovember19,2019: https://twitter.com/downdetector/status/1270712032665337856. The end time of an outage is typically reported by the retail broker itself. (For the same TD Ameritrade’s outage on November 19, 2019, see https://twitter.com/TDAmeritrade/status/ 1270726116710313991.) We also include outages reported by ordinary users on Twitter, yet we always require two tweets to identify an outage (from Twitter users, DownDetector.com, or the retail broker directly). We believe that our approach may miss smaller outages but should pick up all major ones. Comments on Twitter also allow us to document the affected service for all outages. Our final list of outages includes only incidents that may significantly affect trading in options. In other words, we exlcude certain types of outages, such as those related to cryptoassets, trading fractional shares, and loading of charts. The resulting number of outages by broker from November 2019 to July 2021 is reported in Table A18 below. 47Accessed in August 2022 via https://status.robinhood.com/history?page=1. 73 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

(2021) and construct the sample of refined timings of broker restrictions using the Wayback Machine, Twitter, and reddit.com. We cannotfullyseparateTDAmeritradeandCharlesSchwabbecauseCharlesSchwabcompleted its acquisition of TD Ameritrade in October 2020 and TD Ameritrade referred customers to the official statements issued by Charles Schwab at the time of restrictions. Furthermore, we do not include smaller brokerages separately due to their market share and because their (less frequent) restrictions coincide with times when both Robinhood and TD Ameritrade / Charles Schwab had restrictions in place. Such brokerages include Ally, Apex, E*TRADE, tastyworks, Tradestation, and Webull. Finally, we could not find evidence of restrictions by some brokerages in our sample, such as Fidelity. A handful of tickers remained restricted even in summer 2021, with little evidence on the exact end date of restrictions. In those cases, we set the end date to March 19, 2021, when most restrictions ceased. This end date also allows us to keep the overall sample comparable to that in Jones et al. (2021). 74 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

    "text": "D.4 Attenuation bias in the retail share of SLIM The baseline back-of-the envelope calculations of the retail share in SLIM are affected by two main sources of model misspecification: 1. ability of retail investors to switch to a different broker during an outage (since users often have installed multiple trading apps), and 2. the measurement error in the start and end time of the outage. The impact of the first source of model misspecification is clear, as it simply dilutes the share of the retail investors affected by the outage. For example, if the baseline estimate of retail share in SLIM is 22.0%, and half of the TD and Robinhood users could have switched to a different app during an outage, back-of-the-envelope estimates laid out in Section 1.4 would imply an average retail share of SLIM of 44.0% with a confidence interval of (13.08%,74.85%). The measurement error of outages timing is a non-classical one, since it is caused by a misclassification of the dummy variable indicator (and hence, by definition has a negative correlation with its true value). In case of a simple pairwise regression, however, the bias in the OLS estimate of the slope coefficient has a convenient expression. Consider a simple pairwise regression of the outcome on a dummy variable: y = α+βd +(cid:15) , i i i where d ∈ {0,1}. Assume that instead of observing the actual outage dummy variable, d , i i ˜ ˜ ˆ we measure it with an error: d = d +u , s.t. d ∈ {0,1}. The limit of the OLS estimate β, i i i i therefore, takes the following expression: ˆ p h ˜ ˜ i β =⇒ β P(d = 1|d = 1)−P(d = 1|d = 0) , with i i i i πq ˜ 1 P(d = 1|d = 1) = , and i i πq +(1−π)q 1 0 π(1−q ) ˜ 1 P(d = 1|d = 0) = , i i π(1−q )+(1−π)(1−q ) 1 0 ˜ where π ≡ P(d = 1) is the true probability of an outage, q ≡ P(d = 1|d = 1) is i 1 i i the probability to observe an outage in the measured sample when it actually happened, ˜ q ≡ P(d = 1|d = 0)istheprobabilitytorecordanoutagewheretherewasnone.

Table A21 demonstrates these calculations for different sizes of measurement error, expressed as a percentage of the unconditional true probability to observe an outage (π), which empirically is very close to zero. Note that since outages happen very rarely, the bias is largely affected only by the measurement error of recording an outage, when there was none (q ). For example, if 0 ˆ there is a 20% measurement error (that is, q = 0.2π), and the OLS estimate of β is 0.743, 0 correction for the attenuation bias implies the probability limit of 0.892, which leads to an average retail share in SLIM of 26.39% if TD and Robinhood users rely exclusively on those apps, and 52.78% if 50% of them use other apps during outages. If we assume the same estimate of the standard error for the OLS coefficients as in the baseline regression, the confidence intervals for the retail share of SLIM are (10.95%,41.83%) and (21.90%,83.67%), correspondingly. Naturally, the larger is the measurement error, the larger is the attenuation bias in the OLS estimates.

Quotedspread is the spread between the best bid and best ask on the contract (across all exchanges) relative to the midpoint price at the time of the trade. Effective spread is an absolute percentage deviation of the trade price from the midpoint price at the time of the trade, multiplied by 2. For both spreads, we report frequency-weighted averages.

Figure A2 plots the 10-day net performance of SLIM trades across these dimensions, and Table A40 below reports the same metrics for both gross and net performance for all our holding period assumptions. Table A41 reports the mean daily SLIM performance across the same dimensions along with Newey-West standard errors. Overall, we find that there are two distinct groups of retail investors: those who lose money on purchased short-term call contracts and those who earn on selling these contracts. On average across maturities, SLIM investors lose when writing calls, and the oppo- site is true for buy trades. However, a contrasting pattern emerges if we consider time to expiration: Investors lose when buying calls with less than a week to expiration (and gain when selling such short-term contracts). Losses on purchased weekly calls (and gains on written contracts) extend to gross performance as Table A40 reports. Furthermore, SLIM investors typically gain on written puts, and the netted perfor- mance (sell-buy) concentrates in long contracts (mostly, one to three months). This is con- sistent with some SLIM investors being able to earn compensation for servicing the demand of institutional hedgers. 97 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

Underlying for emphasis is ours. 104 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019 F.9 Hedged SLIM dollar performance In this section, we report daily average SLIM dollar performance under the assump- tions of delta-hedging or full hedging. To compute delta-hedged dollar performance of each retail trade j over the horizon of h days, we assume that the investor trades ∆ ×Size ×100 number of shares simultane- j,t−1 j ously with the trade of size Size in options. To compute fully hedged dollar performance, j we assume that the multiplier on the underlying stock or ETF leg is 1. That is, we assume that the investor trades sign(∆ )×Size ×100 number of shares simultaneously with the j,t−1 j trade of size Size in options. In other words, j $PerfDH = Direction ×Size ×100×[Price −Price −∆ ×(S −S )], (6) hj j j j,t+h j,t j,t−1 j,t+h j,t $PerfFH =Direction ×Size ×100×[Price −Price −sign(∆ )×(S −S )]. (7) hj j j j,t+h j,t j,t−1 j,t+h j,t Size is the size of the trade in contracts. Direction is the trade direction sign: 1 j j for buy options trades and −1 for sell trades. Price and Price are prices of the traded j,t+h j,t contract at t+h and t, respectively,48 and S is the midpoint price of the underlying at j,t+h t+h and t, respectively.49 ∆ is the contract’s delta as of the close of the previous day, j,t−1 sourced from OptionMetrics, and we exclude contracts with missing deltas. We consider the same horizons h as in the main text. Prices used to compute gross and net performance are consistent with the main text, and we ignore costs of trading in the underlying. 48As in the main text, we winsorize trade sizes at the 99.5th percentile each day and incorporate price adjustmentfactorsrelatedtocorporateactionssuchasstocksplits(forbothoptionandunderlyingprices). 49We use net-of-dividend stock and ETF prices, sourced from CRSP. Including dividends only slightly in- creases our performance estimates and does not change the presented conclusions. 105 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

In this appendix, we evaluate whether measures of retail popularity explain perfor- manceofretailtradesinweeklyoptions. Inparticular, weestimatethefollowingspecification in a ticker and contract type panel: SLIM Performance = βRetail +γ0X +δ0C +α +µ +ε . (8) i,t+h i,t i,t i,t i t+h i,t+h For SLIM Performance we use gross or net SLIM dollar performance for ticker i on i,t+h day t under the assumption of holding period h (Table A47) or a dummy variable for whether this dollar performance is positive (Table A48).50 Ticker characteristics X and contract i,t characteristics C are the same as in Section 1.3. Retail is one of the following measures i,t i,t of retail activity at a ticker level, as defined in the main text: sharesmall, Internalized volume in underlying , Robinhood ownership breadth, log , and WSB mentions, log . In addition i,t i,t i,t to these variables, we include D(EPSweek) , which equals 1 during the calendar week of i,t stock i’s earning announcement and 0 otherwise (according to I/B/E/S data). α and µ i t+h are ticker and date fixed effects, respectively. All variables are standardized. We do not winsorize SLIM Performance . i,t+h 50Results are very similar if we estimate a probit regression without fixed effects instead of the linear probability model with fixed effects estimated here. 108 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

SLIM trades exhibit a statistically significant intraday pattern compared to other trade types: On the option expiration days, there is a larger sell volumeshareinthelasttwohoursofthetradingday. Thisisconsistentwithretailbrokerages taking an automated action to close retail positions prior to the option’s expiration.

In this section, we present suggestive evidence for binding cash constraints for retail investors in the U.S. options market. First, we see that, during retail frenzies, Google users are more likely to search for \"fractional options.\" Trading fractional options is not permitted in the U.S. in our sample, yet it could allow constrained investors to trade in contracts on an underlying with a high price. Figure A4 plots Google searches for fractional options in our sample. It demonstrates that people are more actively searching for this phrase during the periods of retail frenzies, that is, in June-July 2020 and January 2021. Figure A4 Google searches for fractional options This figure plots weekly Google searches for fractional options between November 2019 and June 2021. Data source is Google Trends (see https://trends.google.com/trends/), accessed on May 8, 2022. Second, we see that stock splits on retail-popular yet expensive underlying stocks are associated with an increase in the retail trading volume in options. Figure A5 shows that the average daily volume in SLIM trades below $25051 in Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) has risen sharply right after their stock splits (both on August 28, 2020) while SLIM trading in FANG stocks, equally popular among retail investors, remained roughly the same. 51We focus on SLIM trades below $250, as this measure most likely reflects retail investors who are cash- constrained. 115 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

    "text": "Figure A5 SLIM trading volume around stock splits This figure plots the dollar volume in SLIM trades below $250 in size two months around August 28, 2020, when AAPL and TSLA had stock splits (4:1 and 5:1, respectively). The solid line is the average daily SLIM volume of AAPL and TSLA, while the dashed line is the average of FANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet). The vertical dashed line indicates the day of the split. Figure A6 plots the distribution of SLIM trade dollar sizes before and after the split. We focus on at-the-money contracts as their prices are most sensitive to the price level of the underlying, although the pattern is similar for the full sample of contracts. After the split, a larger mass of the distribution is concentrated near zero, or, in other words, we observe a larger share of SLIM trades of smaller sizes. This change in the distribution corresponds to an increase in sample skewness of 48% and 73% for AAPL and TSLA, respectively. Next, we investigate whether a change in SLIM trading is related to stock splits for all underlying securities that had a split in our sample period. Specifically, we estimate the following cross-sectional regression: Y = βSplitratio +γ0X +ε . (9) i i i i Y is one of the following measures of trading activity change around the split of shares in i company i: ∆ SLIM volume (contracts) is a log difference between the daily average number of contracts in SLIM trades below $250 one month after the split and one month before the 116 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

X arecontrolsrelatedtotheunderlyingstockorETF,allaveragedoveronemonth i before the split: price, volatility, return, volume (log), and market capitalization (log). If retail investors are cash-constrained, we expect their activity to increase more when the constraint becomes less binding. Consistent with this hypothesis, Table A52 reveals that retail trading in options tends to increase more when the split ratio is higher. This is true for all the measures we consider: contract volume change, dollar volume change, and the change in the share in the total option trading volume for that underlying. Furthermore, this effect is large both statistically and economically, as the size of the split ratio explains 35%–40% of the variation in SLIM volume around the event date (see panel A). Notably, the change in internalized volume in equities is not sensitive to the split ratio size, which is consistent with the availability of trading fractional shares in the United States. Underlying volatilities (and options implied volatilities) tend to increase upon stock splits in our sample, consistent with the classical result in Ohlson and Penman (1985). An increase in volatilities may change the trading dynamics in the options market, as well as SLIM share in the total trading. To alleviate the concern that the reported relationship is driven by that, in panel C of Table A52, we control for the contemporaneous change in underlying volatility and find that the results are unchanged. Figure A7 is a counterpart of Figure A6 above for the full sample of stock splits. We find that, across all stock splits in our sample, the share of SLIM trades of smaller sizes tends to increase, consistent with the entry of constrained investors. The pattern is less pronounced if we include contracts whose prices are less sensitive to the underlying price (panel (b)), although it is still present. The corresponding increase in sample skewness is 53% (for at-the-money contracts) and 43% (for all contracts). 117 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",

We include all call option contracts on dividend- paying stocks with EEV > 0. Furthermore, since our valuation might be imperfect, we add a market-based filter of the optimality of exercise: We only keep contracts with a decline in open interest on the cum-dividend date.54 By implication, we only have contracts with non-missing open interest on the cum-dividend date and the date before that. We remove contracts with missing trading volume on cum-dividend date (either in OPRA or in OptionMetrics). For both SLIM and Small Share, we compute a one-week moving average (requiring a minimum of a one-day observation) and use its lagged value on the cum-dividend date. We use the same rolling measures for the retail activity variables described in the main text, as well as volume, spread, and implied volatility controls. 52We use the daily contract-level implied volatility from OptionMetrics. If it is missing, we interpolate it from the neighboring strikes. 53We assume that its size is equal to the current dividend if the stock pays one more dividend after the current dividend until the option expires and 0 otherwise. 54This is consistent with Hao, Kalay, and Mayhew (2010). 121 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4065019",
