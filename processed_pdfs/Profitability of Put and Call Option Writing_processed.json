    "text": "by Richard Claus Katz Submitted to the School of Industrial Management on May 23, 1962, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science. Put and call option writing is a segment of investment activity on which there has been little intensive research. It is widely believed that option writing, while being a profitable auxiliary activity in the management of an investment portfolio, is not a profitable investment medium in its own right. This study is aimed at evaluating put and call option writing as an investment medium. The profitability of option writing is estimated by calculating the profits made by 76 option writers on 851 option contracts written over a 21-month period, April 22, 1960 to January 30, 1962. To calcu- late writer gains, the data describing each option contract first had to be coded and prepared for processing. Then the average rate of return per option sold was chosen as the best method of evaluating the overall profitability of the writing activity. A computer pro- gram was now written to calculate the profit associated with each possible option type and option outcome encountered in the data studied. The actual profitability of option writing found was contrasted with the profits option writers could have made by using other feasible strategies. The strategy actually used was the best one of those examined. However, it yielded a -0.1% rate of return cr -$8 per option contract sold. Next, the profitability of each option writer was contrasted with his opportunity cost. Thirty-three of the 50 writers who made a profit and 22 of the 26 who lost money would have had higher profits or smaller losses by not writing options. Some of the characteristics of all option contracts which may influence or determine profitability were now examined. A significant positive correlation between option outcome and duration was found. Longer duration options yielded higher profits for the option writers. A relationship between outcome and option striking price was also indicated. Puts and calls were found profitable while money was lost on straddles. If just margined puts and hedged calls were sold on",

    "text": "~-=-- -__ different stocks, the writer would eliminate the possibility of large double losses occurring from a sizable drop in the price of the stock optioned. A measure of the \"investment quality\" of a stock was considered as a method of predicting the profitability of writing options on particular stocks. The relation between the quality rating and the profitability of writing options on stocks with that rating was found significant. The average investment required for stocks in each quality group had a high positive correlation with the quality rating. This substantiated the relationship found earlier between outcome and option striking price. Higher priced stocks are usually higher quality stocks and are usually more profitable for option writing than lower priced stocks. The investment quality rating was used to evaluate the effects of option writing on option writers' investment portfolios. No significant change in the quality level of option writers' investment portfolios was found. The actions of a hypothetical option writer given various fixed amounts of initial capital and facing the option writing opportunities studied in this thesis were simulated. The results indicate that option writers can make profits with small amounts of capital devoted to option writing. However, while the evidence is not conclusive, there is some indication that the variability of one's initial capital increases with a decrease in initial portfolio size. In summary, this study has shown that option writing as a whole was not profitable over the 21-month period considered. The evidence indicates that option writing under the strategies investigated cannot be considered a desirable investment medium in its own right. There- fore, option writing may be useful only as an auxiliary activity in the management of an investment portfolio unless other writing strategies show that profits can be made over an extended period of time from this activity.

    "text": "Put and call option writing is a segment of investment activity on which there has been very little intensive research. It is widely believed that option writing, while being a profitable auxiliary activity in the management of an investment portfolio, is not a profitable investment medium in its own right. This study is aimed at evaluating the profitability of put and call option writing as an investment medium. The Extent of Put and Call Option Trading In 1960, put and call option sales were 1.12 per cent of New 1 York Stock Exchange volume. Thus, 8,470,000 shares of stock, or 84,700 100-share lots were optioned during 1960. This is an increase of 620 per cent in number of shares optioned since 1943, during a period when the number of shares traded increased only 275 per cent. The dollar volume of shares optioned during 1960 was $288,000,000. Put and call option trading therefore is a significant and rapidly- growing segment of investment activity. What Are Put and Call Options? A call option gives the owner the right to buy a stock at a specified price during a fixed period stipulated in the option contract. A put contract is an analogous instrument giving the owner the right to 1Report on Put and Call Options, Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Trading and Exchanges, August, 1961.

The price at which the stock is exercisable--the \"striking price'--is usually the market price of the stock on the date the option is written--the \"trade date\". The option duration extends to the expiration date of the option contract. Options are usually written on 100 shares of stock. They are often sold in mul- tiple combinations of puts and calls. Thus, a put plus a call is a \"straddle\", a put plus two calls is a \"strap\", a call plus two puts is a \"strip\", and a call plus a put where each side of this option 2 has a different striking price is called a \"spread\". How Option Trading Works If a person wishes to purchase a stock option, he must find a person willing to write an option contract. This search is facili- tated by put and call option dealers who act as middlemen. The dealer will contact a writer, negotiate the price of the option with both the buyer and writer, and make his profit through the difference in the two prices. A member firm of the New York Stock Exchange, usually the writer's broker, will endorse the option contract. This endorse- ment guarantees that the writer will carry out the terms of the agreement. The writer's compensation is called the option premium. The dealer will be willing to buy either a put or a call inde- pendent of the wishes of the option buyer. He is willing to do so because a put can be converted to a call and vice versa.

No losses can occur from a decline in the price of the stock, but gains are unlimited. Similarly, if a call is owned and the stock on which the option is written is sold short, the position is equivalent to a put. No losses can occur from a rise in the price of the stock optioned, but all gains due to a fall in the price of the stock are realized. Option Writing Requirements The New York Stock Exchange requires option writers to hedge or margin option contract sales. A call option can be hedged by purchasing the stock optioned. The writer is then in a position to deliver the stock if it is called. A put can be hedged by selling short the stock optioned. This short position insures that the writer will be able to accept delivery of the stock if it is put to him. Option contract sales, alternatively, can be margined. This margin, however, is not the same as the regular stock market margin where a certain percentage of the price of the stock must be paid to take the stock position, the remainder being borrowed. No stock position is taken when stock options are margined. The capital in- vested can be considered a \"perfomance\" margin, sufficient capital to guarantee that the option writer will fulfill the terms of the option contract. Minimum New York Stock Exchange margin requirements 3A detailed explanation of this procedure can be found in Richard Kruizenga, Puts and Calls: A Theoretical and Market Analysis, unpublished Ph.D. thesis, M.I.T., 1956, p. 9.",

Method of the Study To evaluate option writing profitability, a data sample of 851 option contract sales by 76 option writers covering a period from April 22, 1960, to January 30, 1962, was used. Computer programs were written and used to process and prepare the data for analysis. Proper methods for evaluating profitability were investigated. The average rate of return per option contract sold was chosen as the best criterion of profitability. A computer program which calculates option writing profitability under the strategy used by option wrriters and under other feasible stragegies was written. The strategy actually used by writers was to hedge calls and margin puts. Four other strategies were investigated, involving different methods of hedging and margining option contract sales. They are: (1) margining puts and calls; (2) hedging puts and margining calls; (3) hedging calls, puts, and call sides of two-sided options and margining put sides of two-sided options; 4 and (4) hedging calls, puts, and put sides of two-sided options and margining call sides of two-sided options. The data was processed through the option writing profit program, calculations being made for each of the strategies. The calculations under some strategies were run twice where it was felt appropriate to compare results under minimum and maximum hedge and margin requirements. 4Two-sided options are straddles, strips, straps, and spreads.",

The groupings used were option type, duration, outcome, writer, striking price, trade date, and expiration date. Another program was used to calculate the opportunity cost of the writers. To evaluate the possibility of using some quality measure to determine the attractiveness of particular stocks for option writing, the options were grouped according to an investment quality rating devised by the Value Line Investment Service. These groups were then processed through the option writing profit program to determine the relationship existing between this particular quality rating and the profitability of option writing. The effect of option writing on the quality level of option writers' investment portfolios was calculated to determine if writers were significantly changing the quality level of their investment port- folios by accomodating the option-buying desires of their customers. This was done by dividing the option sample into two groups, the first group containing those options which were hedged with previously- owned stock and the second group containing put options and those options hedged by purchasing stock in the market. The significance of differences in the mean and standard deviations of the quality levels were evaluated by \"t\" and \"F\" tests. To examine the effects of portfolio size on the variability in the value of an option writer's portfolio, the actions of a hypo- thetical option writer were simulated via a computer program. The",

Organization of Thesis The thesis has been organized largely in accordance with the steps taken in the analysis of profitability as outlined in the method of study section above. Chapter II describes in detail the methods by which the data used in the thesis was assembled, coded, and prepared for processing. The specific variables associated with each option contract sold are identified and defined. Chapter III first investigates the appropriate measure of profit- ability to use in evaluating option writing. Then, the method of cal- culating the gross profit on a writer's investment is described. The investment required for each option contract sale is considered next. The costs associated with the writing, exercise, or expiration of an option contract are enumerated. Finally, the computer program used to calculate option writing profitability is described. In Chapter TV, the actual profitability of option writing is calculated and contrasted with the profits option writers could have made using other strategies. Then the profitability of each option writer is contrasted with his opportunity cost. Characteristics associated with all option contracts which may influence or determine profitability are investigated next. In Chapter V, the question of whether some measure of the \"investment quality\" of a stock can be associated with the attract- iveness of that stock for option writing is considered. Then, the",

The distribution of option contract trade and expira- tion dates over the time period considered is investigated. The methods by which the data was assembled, coded, and prepared for processing are described. Then the specific variables associated with each option contract sold are identified and defined. The option data used in this study consists of 851 100-share contracts having trade dates between April 22, 1960, and November 21, 1961. Expiration dates range between October 10, 1960, and January 30, 1962. Information was available on option contracts which were to expire after January 30, 1962, but were exercised before this date. This data was not included in the sample, since it might bias results by not accurately representing profitability experienced by option writers during this later period. The distribution of option trade dates and expiration dates in the sample is shown in Table 1. Options are numbered from 1 to 1034. Of these numbers, 183 have no corresponding option contracts because either: (1) Information on this contract was sufficiently incom- plete to warrant exclusion, or (2) The contract was exceptionally unusual, e.g., a straddle with the two sides having widely differing durations, or (3) The contract was a duplicate of one already included, or 8",

Information on expiration date prices and in some cases date of action prices and interim dividends was lacking and found in Moody's Dividend Record and The Commercial and Financial Chronicle. Prices taken from the Chronicle were the average of the high and low prices for the day. Option data supplied on punched cards had the stocks optioned and option types coded alphabetically. The first program3 used transformed the alphabetical representation of option type to a numerical form corresponding with the author's code, and substituted a unique number for each different stock symbol encountered. These revised punched cards were then transformed by a second program to a format similar to the author's.4 Correct stock identification numbers were then substituted by hand in place of the coding done by the first program used. In addition, dividends paid during the period each option was outstanding were recorded on the final data cards along with expiration date prices where necessary. The data was now processed through a final program which converted the card 3This program had to be written in SPS, since the IBM 1620 does not accept alphanumeric input with FORTRAN. The program was written by Robin Hough, Ph.D. candidate in Economics at M.I.T. 4This program will not process strips and straps. Data on these options must be converted by hand to the author's format. 5When a sufficient volume of data with alphanumeric coding is to be transformed to the author's format, a master set of lead cards should be punched which has the stock symbols arranged in proper coded sequence so that additional recoding such as the author has done will not be necessary.",

This version, very similar to the card 1 format, was adopted to permit sorting on columns with pertinent information. Appendix 2 contains copies of all the programs used to transform the data sup- plied by Denmar Corporation to the author's format. Sample outputs from some of these programs are also presented. All final data cards were run through an error checking program, similar in same respects to the Fortran Pre-Compiler, except checking for errors in the input data rather than in the program used to 6. process the data. This program is designed to check relationships in the data and actual data quantities, punching out error signals when an unusual quantity or relationship exists. Exhibit 6 summarizes the unusual relationships detected. Exhibit 7 presents a sample of results obtained using this program. Appendix 3 presents a copy of the program itself. This program was especially valuable for checking the option data (option numbers 1 to 760) entirely processed by hand because of the high likelihood of errors occurring while coding information and transferring it to punched cards. Because this type of error could not occur in the data transformed by the computer to the author's format (option number 761 to 1034), the program was useful here only in checking that obviously impossible relationships did not exist on the original data cards. 6The error check program only checks the first card where two cards are needed to describe all the data relevant to an option contract. The program is not presently written to accept a second card as input, and these cards should be deleted when the program is used or the program should be modified (a simple task) to at least allow the second card to be read in if present.",

    "text": "A number of interdependent problems arise in comparing the profits earned on investments of unequal duration. Calculations adjusting returns on these investments to a common duration make implicit assumptions regarding the way capital devoted to shorter lived investments is reinvested. These assumptions may cause the profit measure derived to be entirely distorted. No adjustment for the length of time capital is invested would be necessary if it could be assumed that the return on an investment is independent of duration. Such an assumption is not true, as will be shown in Chapter 41, for the investments made by the put and call option writers studied. Therefore, differences in investment dura- tion cannot be adjusted by any method to yield an accurate measure of profitability. The problem is even more complicated, however, since it is nec- essary to have proportionately more capital tied up in longer, as opposed to shorter, duration investments.2 Should an imprecise measure of profitability be given a fine adjustment by weighting 1See page 54. 2For example, if an option writer sells 300 one-month and 300 six-month options in one year at the rate of 25 of each kind per month, at any time after six months have transpired, 150 six-month and 25 one-month options are outstanding.",

Shall a further adjustment be made to differentially weight investments of different magnitude? The author has decided not to make these adjustments to the main measure of option writing profitability used in this study. However, these adjustments have been made when other methods of calculating profitability were used. These methods are outlined below. The measuresof profitability cal- culated with these other methods can be used in further work evaluating the distortions introduced by the various types of correction factors applied. The main measure of profitability used in this study is average rate of return per option contract sold. As indicated earlier, this measure of profitability makes the assumption that outcome is inde- pendent of duration. While this assumption is not true for the put and call options studied, this measure of profitability always yields an average rate of return figure which has the proper sign, i.e., nega- tive if money was lost on the investment activity and positive if a profit was made--something that cannot be said for the other measures considered. This measure has the additional advantage of assuming arithmetic averaging. This assumption is appropriate, since the option writers considered in this Study are devoting only part of their capital to option writing. Other Methods Considered The other methods of calculating profitability considered an- nualize the returns on individual investments by assuming gains are compounded.",

This assumption is appropriate, since the option writers considered in this Study are devoting only part of their capital to option writing. Other Methods Considered The other methods of calculating profitability considered an- nualize the returns on individual investments by assuming gains are compounded. One method suggested by A. James Boness3 is akin to the use of a geometric average. A geometric average is only appropriate, how- ever, if all the capital utilized in the investment activity is nec- essary for each succeeding investment. Option writing does not nec- essarily require the investment of one's entire capital in each option contract sold. Boness first investigates the use of a geometric average in the strictest sense. If R is the return on an investment, then 1 + R = ert (1) where e = natural logarithm base r = instantaneous rate of return t = duration of the investment in days A continuous rate of return can now be found by calculating In(l+R) = rt (2) which becomes 1 Iln(l+R) = 365r, if annualized. (3) The average rate of return per investment is n Z In(l+R) i=l , which is the definition of a geometric average. n This measure of profitability will always yield a lower rate of return than an average of dollar gains. This return is lower because of the symmetric nature of the distribution of geometric gains rela- tive to the distribution of dollar gains which is skewed to the right. 31In a forthcoming paper, \"Some Evidence on the Profitability of Trading in Puts and Calls\".",

Since the logarithm of a negative number is undefined, the geometric average can no longer be used. To allow a rate of return of less than -100 percent to occur, Boness modifies equation (3) for negative R, as follows: -~ ln(l+jIR) = 365r. The gain distribution for this formulation of the rate of return calculation is believed to fall between the distribution of geometric gains and the distribution of dollar gains. 5 Annualizing a negative rate of return in the above manner im- plicitly assumes that additional capital is being added to the origi- nal investment at the rate of loss that occurs on the investment over its initial duration. While this method of calculation circumvents the problem of not being able to lose more than 100 percent of one's capital, the assumption of additional capital being added to the in- vestment introduces a negative distortion in the rate of return measureo The author has investigated a method of calculating profitability analogous to the Boness rate of return measure. This method simply Assume, for example, that a put on Texas Instruments is sold at a striking price of $200 and the option writer covers with 25% margin equal to $50. If the stock falls to $140, the writer will lose his $50 investment and $10 in addition. 5This has not been verified on a theoretical basis.",

Thus, (1+R') = (1+R)3 65/D and R' = (1+R) 365/ D - 1 where R = rate of return on the investment D = duration of the investment R' = annual rate of return The convention for R < -1 the author has adopted is to consider rate of loss equal to the total loss divided by the original invest- ment. Negative distortion is not introduced with this measure. The objection against this method of calculating an annual rate of return is that the returns are being distorted in a positive di- rection. For example, if two equal four-month investments were made, one yielding -100 percent and the other +100 percent, the net return to the investor is zero. However, the simple compounding formulation of the annual return calculation would say that the annual rate of gain on the first investment is -100 percent and +700 percent on the second, for an average return of +300 percent. Such a return is not entirely implausible, however, when one considers the nature of com- pound interest. If the investment yielding +100 percent in four months is made for two more four-month periods, the return also being reinvested, the average return for the two investments is +300 per- cent. Naturally, the question is whether these investments for the two additional four-month periods can be made.

It should be noted that the modified geometric average method previously discussed also produces this positive distortion, the net distortion being a function of the number of positive and negative returns and their duration. Rates of return on individual investments and the over-all in- vestment activity have been calculated using the Boness formulation of the geometric average and the simple compound interest method. Over-all profitability using these procedures has also been calculated by weighting individual annual returns by duration and investment, and by duration alone. These measures are defined on page 66. Two other statistical measures were calculated to reflect the nature of the profitability distributions. Standard deviation and skewness were found for the distributions of the modified geometric rate of return as formulated by Boness, the simple compound interest rate of return, and for the distribution of dollar gains per option contract sold. These statistical measures tell the relative dis- persion of the returns around the mean and to what extent the dis- tribution is skewed relative to other skewed distributions.

This procedure provides an excellent compara- tive measure of profitability and eliminates the difficulties found in calculating an absolute measure of profitability where the neces- sity of taking a weighted average creates distortions. Gross Profit Calculation The following discussion will show how the gross profit on a writer's investment, which hedges or margins an option contract, is calculated. Gross profit is a function of (1) the percentage of the premium retained by the put and call writer, (2) whether an option was hedged or margined, (3) the price movement of the stock optioned, (4) the dividends declared during the period the option was outstanding, and (5) the relationship between the option striking price and the market price of the stock at the time the option was written. If an option writer has an agent who provides the writer with advice, provides bookkeeping functions, and maintains contact with option dealers, the agent usually retains part of the premium received by the writer. The larger the percentage of the premium retained by the agent, the lower the profit of the option writer. If an option is margined, the writer loses nothing from the price movement of stock adverse to the holder of such an option.",

If a price movement of the stock optioned is unfavorable to the option holder, it is just as unfavorable to the option writer. If an option is hedged and a favorable price movement for the option holder occurs, the option writer suffers no loss. The above statements are modified to the extent that the striking price of the option is different from the market price of the stock at the time the option is written. Thus if the striking price is slightly above the market price at the time a hedged call option is written and the option is exercised, the writer adds that small dif- ference to his profit. If, on the other hand, he margined the sale of the call contract, his loss is reduced by that small difference. The writer's profit picture with a put contract is analogous. If a put option is hedged, written at a price slightly above the market, and ultimately exercised, the writer loses the small differ- ence between striking and market price. If the option was margined, he loses this small difference plus the amount of the price movement favorable to the option holder. If, on the other hand, the put optior. striking price is less than the market price, the writer gains the difference when hedged and does not lose the difference when margined.

Example of Gross Profit Calculation The following example should demonstrate the various aspects of the gross profit calculation just described: A six-month straddle is written on a stock selling at $50 per share, for which the writer receives a gross premium of $850. The option striking price is $51, and the writer keeps 90 percent of the option premium, 10 percent going to his agent.

If a straddle is sold where puts and calls are margined, New York Stock Exchange regulations specify that the larger of the minimum margins that would be required to write either a put or a call option separately is the minimum required coverage for the sale of the straddle. This minimum coverage is the call margin equal to 30 percent of the market price. If either side of the straddle were to be hedged, however, the New York Stock Exchange requires additional minimum margining (or hedging) of the other side of the straddle. Similar reasoning applies to the investment required for the sale of a strip or a strap under margining assumptions. Assuming 70 percent hedging, with calls hedged, the investment for a strap would be 165 percent of the market price; for puts and calls margined, 60 percent, and for puts hedged, 130 percent. The actual cash investment required of the option writer is arrived at by deducting the premium retained by the writer from the total investment required, as calculated under the hedging assump- tions made.

This program, shown in Appendix 4 , incorporates the concepts and methodology described lOFederal Reserve Bank of New York \"Monthly Review\", April, 1962. 42 on the preceding pages. The program processes the option data as follows: Punched cards containing the data describing each option con- tract are read into the computer.r The investment required of the option writer and the costs associated with the sale of the contract and its outcome are calculated. Net profit per option contract sold is found by subtracting the option writing costs from gross profit. Rates of profit are then calculated on each individual investment. After all the option data is processed, over-all profitability and the standard deviation and skewness of various profit distributions, described earlier, are computed. The program allows profitability calculations to be made under various strategies which the option writer is assumed to follow. These strategies will be discussed in the next chapter. To calculate profitability according to these different strategies, certain param- eter values must be specified before computations begin. These parameters are: (1) The portion of the option premium kept by the option writer. (2) The strategy upon which the calculations are to be based. (3) The call margin assumed. (4) The put margin assumed. The computer program was written to calculate the profitability of all types of option outcomes found in the data studied.

First, the actual profitability of option writing is calculated and contrasted with the profits option writers could have made by using other possible strategies. Then the prof- itability of each option writer is contrasted with his opportunity cost. Next investigated are characteristics which can be associated with all option contracts: duration, type, striking price, and out- come--all of which may influence or determine profitability. Finally, the relation between option writing profitability, option trade and expiration dates, and stock market price movements is investigated. Five possible strategies for put and call option writing have been considered in this study. Strategy 1: All calls and call sides of two-sided optionsl are hedged, and puts or put sides of two-sided options are margined. Both the call hedge and the put margin can equal 100 percent, or the call hedge can equal 70 percent and the put margin 25 percent. This strategy with both call hedge and put margin equal to 100 percent was used by the option writers considered in this study. Strategy 2: All options are margined. The call margin can equal 30 percent and the put margin, 25 percent. Strategy 5: Calls and call sides of two-sided options are margined and puts or put sides of two-sided options are hedged. Both 1Two-sided options are straddles, straps, strips, and spreads.",

If many options were purchased for protection , Strategies 4 and 5 would probably not be effective. \"Purell strategy here means a strategy where a certain hedge or margin position is taken to cover the option contract sale and is not changed while the option is outstanding. A mixed strategy is akin to the filter rule technique5 Alexander has investigated. With a mixed strategy, all options would initially be margined. If an adverse price movement of a specified percent of the option striking price occurred, the option would now be hedged. If the price of the stock optioned then changed direction and an equivalent percent price change occurred, the option would be margined again. Some work done with mixed strategies6 concludes they can be more profitable for the option writer than pure strategies. Mixed strategies have not been investigated here primarily because the option data on which this study is based did not have the necessary price range informiation. Dealers might convert options before sale. For example, a put option could be purchased to protect against a severe price decline in a stock owned by the option buyer. Any loss due to a drop in the price of the stock onmed would be bal- anced by a gain on the put option.

All the other strategies, except Strategy 2, have skewness values of the same mag- nitude. These dollar gain distributions are negatively skewed because gains are limited to the premiums received while losses are unlimited. The dollar gain distribution for Strategy 2 is not as negatively skewed at -1.7. This is because large double losses do not occur with margined straddles. When straddles are hedged, large price movements in the adverse direction9 cause losses on both sides of the straddle. Nothing especially significant can be said regarding the standard deviation of the distributions of dollar gain per option contract sold for the different strategies considered. The standard deviation for Strategy 2 is the lowest because the large double losses on straddles found with other strategies cannot occur. On the basis of the evidence shown by the profitability results, Strategies 2, 3, 4, and 5 were not desirable alternatives to Strategy 1 for the specific option sample studied and over the specific time period investigated.

This dependence on stock market movements suggests that in a period of selectivity in stock price advances, when the market itself is not moving up or down, Strategy 2 or a mixed strategy might yield the highest profit. A mixed strategy would probably be preferred to Strategy 2, since the mixed strategy would eliminate large losses fromn price movements favorable to the option buyer. The fact that Strategies 4 and 5 yield poorer results than Strategies 1 and 3 indicates that options sold by writers may be converted, option buyers' expectations are not correct, or option buyers have other motives such as protection for the purchase of put and call options.

It is somewhat doubtful, however, whether this maximum leverage can be applied with Strategy 1 and extremely doubtful whether it can be applied with Strategy 2. This is because brokerage houses probably will not allow option writers to use leverage unless they have other investments which act as additional protection in case the market moves adversely. This can be considered contingency capital which, while not directly invested in option writing, is necessary if lev- erage is to be obtained. This contingency capital can be invested in other financial securities. Since the option ,,rriters considered in this study do not use all their capital for option writing, they should have sufficient amounts invested in other types of financial securities to make same leveraging of option writing possible.

It is important to note that this high correlation between out- come and duration means that the over-all estimate of profitability of -$8 per option contract sold or -. 1 percent average rate of return per option contract sold is distorted in the negative direction. This negative distortion occurs because no six-month options written in the last six months of the period under consideration were in- cluded in this study. As indicated in Chapter II17, a cut-off date was established beyond which no options included in the sample could expire. The standard deviation of the distribution of dollar gains per option contract sold for a duration class, and the average duration for that class has a correlation coefficient of .5418 This correla- tion coefficient is not significant at the 10 percent level for the six observations made. Therefore the hypothesis that the standard deviation of dollar gains per option contract sold is independent of duration cannot be rejected. This result is surprising, since on an a priori basis, a definite relation between the two variables would be expected.

The better performance of puts and calls suggests option writers might do better by not writing straddles. If just margined puts and hedged calls were sold on different stocks, the writers would eliminate the possibility of large double losses occurring from a sizable drop in the price of a stock optioned. Selling puts and calls on different stocks is equivalent to diversifying to reduce risk. The sale of a straddle, using a puts-margined and calls-hedged strategy, is equivalent to selling two margined puts. Such a position offers no diversification at all. It is interesting to note the positive correlation between out- come by option type and the skewness of the dollar gain distribution by option type. This relationship indicates that option types, when profitable, had more large gains than large losses. Similarly, when option types yielded losses, they had more large losses than large gains.

A regression of investment per option contract on a measure of stock quality, which will be discussed in Chapter V, cor- roborates this hypothesis.20 Profitability and Option Outcome Table 11 presents the results for option contracts grouped by option outcome. Only on those options where stock was called did option writers make profits. Such profits were to be expected, how- ever, since all calls were hedged. The largest losses were incurred where stock was put to the option vwriter.and were mainly due to the double losses occurring on straddles. It is interesting to note that the premiums from expiring puts, straddles, and calls were not sufficient to offset the losses on stock held to hedge unexercised call options. Option Writing Profitability Related to Option Trade and Expiration Dates and Stock Market Price Levels To determine whether a relationship existed between the level of the stock market and option writing profitability, the options were grouped by trade and by expiration dates, by months, and processed through the option writing profit program.

In Chapter VI a significant positive correlation will be shown between the value of a portfolio of option contract sales and the level of the stock market as represented by the Dow Jones Average. It should be noted that the option writers' agent began his activities just prior to the period studied, and his volume of option sales grew over the period. Therefore most of the options in the sample studied had trade dates around the middle and end of the per- iod. Because options written at the beginning of the period were profitable for option writers, the total profitability of the option writing activity is understated relative to that which it would have 21The degrees of freedom used to evaluate the significance of the correlation coefficient have not been adjusted for possible auto-correlation of successive observations of the Dow Jones Average.",

This is not meant to imply that poor profitability results were obtained because option sales were bunched during periods unprofitable for option writing. As indicated in Table 12, stock option sales were well distributed over the period, September, 1960, to October, 1961, with the largest sales volumes occurring during periods which yield practically a zero return, March and June, 1961.

    "text": "In this chapter, the author briefly examines the question of whether some measure of the \"investment quality'\" of a stock can be associated with the attractiveness of that stock for option writing. Such a measure of quality could also be used to compare the quality level of an option writer's investment portfolio with the quality level of stocks that are potential additions to his portfolio through option writing. Stocks put to the writer or stocks bought to hedge call options which were not called must be utilized in some manner. WhethLer the writer will add these stocks to his regular investment portfolio, sell them to acquire cash, or use them to hedge call options is open to question. The writers studied in this thesis, however, are all advised by their agent to write options only on stocks they would be willing to hold in their portfolio on a long term basis. Therefore, by comparing the quality level of his investment portfolio with the quality level of potential additions, the extent to which an option writer is willing to change the quality level of his present invest- ment portfolio to accommodate the desires of option buyers can be determined. The stocks owned by the writer used to hedge call options must be used to represent the present quality level of his investment portfolio, since they make up the only sample available. These stocks, however, may not accurately represent this present quality",

These stocks, however, may not accurately represent this present quality =-~--~f ~s~L~i~L~ level if they are stocks the writer wishes to eliminate fram his portfolio because their quality level is too low. The study must proceed under these limitations. The quality measurel the author has chosen to investigate in this study was designed by the Value Line Investment Survey to re- flect past growth in dividends and earnings and past stability of price behavior of a particular stock relative to other stocks. If this quality measure is an accurate predictor of future performance, it should correlate well with the profitability of writing options on particular stocks and the desirability of holding particular stocks in an investment portfolio. Stability is weighted about three times as much as earnings and dividends growth in determining the quality grade of a particular stock. Nine grades ranging from A+ to C- are used to rate stocks. Quality ratings for the stocks considered in this study if rated by Value Line are given in Exhibit 4. The 722 options numbered 1 to 759 were used in evaluating the usefulness of the Value Line investment quality rating as a predictor of future performance. This group of options rather than the whole sample set were used in the test of quality vs. outcome to be con- sistent with the sample used when testing the potential quality change in writers' portfolios. The 722 options were divided into quality groups based on quality 1This quality measure is described in greater detail in The Evaluation of Common Stocks by Arnold Bernhard (Simon and Schuster, New York, 1959), p. 41.",

Outcome, as measured by average rate of re- turn per option contract sold, when regressed with quality yielded a correlation coefficient of .61, which is significant at the 10 percent level. These results are shown in Figure 3 . Therefore the hypothesis that option writing profitability is independent of quality is rejected. The results are somewhat affected by the specific Value Line quality ratings used, those assigned to each stock on August 28, 1961. This use of quality ratings existing at a single point in time introduces a small amount of inaccuracy into the results, since ideally the quality rating given to each stock at the time the option is written should be used.2 A second factor that could have affected the regression of out- come on quality is the fact that the options written on stocks in the extreme quality groups may not be adequate samples. The C- quality groups consisted of three options on two different stocks; 2Quality ratings are revised quarterly. The author weighed the large additional amount of time involved in obtaining quality information on a particular stock at the time an option was written and the additional data processing required vs. the potential gain in accuracy that could be achieved. He decided in favor of the method used. A comparison of one set of quarterly ratings with the succeeding set showed only a few cases where ratings were changed, and then only by one quality class. Texas Instruments, one of the stocks in the sample studied, had a very large price fall during the period under consideration. It had a quality rating change from A- to B-, but this occurred on February 5, 1962, six days after the end of the period under consideration.",

Value Line gave nine stocks a C- rating, 57 stocks a C rating, and eight stocks an A+ rating. These extreme quality groups have large opposite values for rate of return per option contract sold which were very important in determining the significant correlation coefficient found between quality and outcome. Therefore if the sample used to represent each of these groups is not representative of the performance of the quality group as a whole, the regression of outcome on quality gave inaccurate results. Another reason these results are not entirely accurate is that outcome has not been adjusted for duration. The small number of options written in the C- to C quality groups could indicate that the advice of the writers' agent to sell options only on stocks they would like to hold in their portfolios on a long term basis, is followed. However, this result could also be attributed to the fact that the stocks in which option buyers are interested fall mostly into the middle and upper quality groups. Therefore, on the basis of this evidence, nothing conclusive regarding the quality distribution of the put and call options writers prefer selling can be said. We do not know to what extent they decline option writing opportunities on low quality stocks. Even though the mean quality level of the stocks on which options were sold and the stocks rated by Value Line were very close, 5.07 vs. 5.19, the quality distribution of stocks on which options are sold is different from the quality distribution of all stocks rated by Value Line at the 1 percent level of significance.

It is possible to infer from the preponderance of middle quality options relative to the quality distribution of Value Line stocks, the desire of option buyers to concentrate on stocks in the middle quality range. Option writers would not be adverse to writing options on high quality stock. The above conclusions must be tempered by the 109 options written which were not assigned quality ratings by Value Line. The negative rate of return per option contract sold, -4.95 percent, associated with this group of options indicates the stocks the options were written on would probably fall in low quality groups if they had been assigned a rating. Of these 109 options sold, 46 or 42 percent of the total were puts, or calls which were hedged by stock bought specifically for that purpose.

This difference is significant at the 5 percent level. 4 Since the unrated stocks probably fall into low quality groups, it can be concluded that whenever options are sold on stock not owned by the option writer, the stock is more likely to be of high or aver- age quality than low quality. Again, no specific evidence is avail- able as to whether this was due to writer selectivity or whether these were just the option writing opportunities that presented themselves. It is interesting to note the high correlation coefficient be- tween the quality rating and the average investment per option nwritten in each quality group, .90. This significant correlation coefficient indicates that the higher quality stocks are usually the higher riced ones. It also tends to confirm the hypothesis that the 109 options vwitten on unrated stocks probably fall into low quality groups. Their average investment per option contract, $3,965, places them somewhere in the C quality range. In addition to finding a relationship between quality and out- come, relationships found existing between quality and the variance of outcome and quality and the skewness of the outcoame distribution would have been desirable.

The variance of the quality of the stocks that originally were in the writer's portfolio was much larger than the variance of the quality of the stocks purchased. The mean quality levels of the groups tested for writer 13 were all significantly different at the 10 percent level. The stocks writer 13 purchased and sold puts on had a significantly lower quality level than the stocks he originally held. While the last result indicates that some clients may be changing the quality level of their portfolio in the direction of lower quality stocks to accommodate the desires of option purchasers, the sample is not random, and this is an isolated case in which the stocks rep- resenting the writer's portfolio may not be representative. The quality level of option writers' investment portfolios cannot be shown as changing when all the options in the sample are considered as a group.

    "text": "Put and call option writing has been discussed in this thesis under the assumption that an option writer has only part of his capital devoted to this activity. The impression has been gained from various investment circles that most writers do not devote their capital solely to option writing, that those who have done so have not been happy with the results, and that the prevailing philosophy believes option writing is a profitable auxiliary activity to man- aging an investment portfolio. Some of the possible tax advantages associated with option writing and the opportunity to write options on stocks presently owned or desired can make the activity a profitable sideline. Hiow- ever, the possibility of capital devoted solely to option writing earning as much or more profit than an investment portfolio is not precluded. Whether part or all of the investor's capital is devoted to option writing, the question of the minimum amount of capital neces- sary to engage in this activity is open to question. At what level of capital is the risk of loss for not having spaced option sales over a sufficient period of time and over a large enough range of stocks too high?

The amount of capital actually needed to write options is a function of the writer strategy. For example, the amount needed would be less if a mixed strategy2 rather than a pure strategy were used, since only fixed percentage losses of capital for price move- ments in any one direction would occur. To shed more light on the two questions of devoting a fixed amount of capital to option writing and the minimum amount of capital necessary to write options safely, the writer has simulated the ac- tions of a hypothetical option writer as follows: A fixed amount of capital is assigned to the option writer. The writer is then faced with the option writing opportunities used as data in this thesis, presented in chronological order. If the writer has sufficient capital to make the investment, he does so; if not, the next investment is considered. Investments that have been made are liquidated as they come due. A flow diagram of the computer program written to do this simu- lation is shown in Exhibit 9 and the program itself in Appendix 8 The input data are the results from the option writing profit pro- gram. These results represent actual historical investment and profit per option contract.

As the amount of capital initially attributed to the option writer increases, the option writer will not necessarily be writing the same options he did with a lesser amount of capital, plus addi- tional ones the increase in capital has made possible. Timing dif- ferences in the availability of capital may occur, since an option may now be written which was passed by when sufficient capital to cover the option was not available. The results obtainable from the simulation are not quite as accurate as would be desired in the ultimate. The following factors which affect the simulation profitability calculations have not been adjusted for, but tend to balance each other out: (1) No interest earnings on idle cash are imputed to the option writer. Idle cash is present (a) at the begin- ning of the period considered when the writer is wait- ing to cover option contract sales as they materialize, (b)m ay be present during the period when available capital is inadequate to provide coverage on an addi- tional option contract, and (c) is present at the end of the period when option contracts are being exercised or expire and an insufficient number of option writing opportunities are presenting themselves.

(2) No ccmmission or transfer tax fees are charged the option writer on the sale of stock bought to hedge which was not called, or on stock put to the writer. This is because the input to the simulation program has profitability calculations based on these assump- tions. Another assumption which does not affect the profitability cal- culations but does abstract from reality is the lack of choice the hypothetical option wrtier has in deciding whether to write a par- ticular option contract. The option contracts which make up the sample studied in this thesis are the summation of \"yes\" answers to this question by the option writers in the group. This simulation does not leave the option writer the choice to reject a particular option contract if sufficient capital is available to properly hedge and/or margin its sale. While no specific bias should be introduced into the profita- bility calculations because of the following factor, it should be noted that options which were written on the same day were considered in the order in which the data for each option was coded and not necessarily in the order in which the options were written. Initially the simulation was performed assuming that a contract being exercised or expiring on the same day as the opportunity to write a new contract occurs, is terminated before the new opportunity is considered. In evaluating the results frcan the simulation, the author realized that the reverse order of events is more plausible.

Sample simulations assuming termination of existing option con- tracts after new writing opportunities are considered are shown in Exhibit 10 for $10,000, $25,000, and $50,000 initial capital. Sum- maries of the results of both sets of simulations are shown in Tables 15 and 16. Very little in the way of a positive contribution to the question of how much capital one needs to write options successfully can be derived from the simulation results for this set of data. In this instance (under both sets of assumptions), a writer starting initially with the smallest amount of capital invested, $5,000, would have made the largest percent return on his investment, 13.9 percent. If the writing period had started with saome other option contract (No. 559, for example), the writer could have suffered a 20 percent or 30 per- cent loss of his capital on the first option contract written. It can only be said that it is possible to write options suc- cessfully with a limited amount of capital. However, the variation in the value of one's portfolio of option contract sales and cash could be much greater, the smaller the amount of capital devoted to writing options. Other simulations would have to be run on samples 4Variation = (maximum value of portfolio over period considered - minimum value) / initial capital invested",

The variation in total capital was regressed with the initial capital assumed invested. In the simulation vfhere termination occurs before new options are considered, the correlation coefficient found, -0.51, is significant at the 5 percent level. Unfortunately, the correlation coefficient found for the simulation where termination occurs after new option contracts are considered, -. 39, is not significant at the 10 percent level. This tends to throw a real shadow of doubt on the validity of the conclusion that variability of capital is a function of the amount invested; i.e., it cannot be definitely asserted on the basis of the evidence provided by this study that a definite relationship exists between diversification and variability of the investor's capital. As should be expected on an a priori basis, no relationship has been found between the amount of initial capital assumed and the rate of return earned for the period. The correlation coefficients of +.04 and -. 28 found in the two simulations, are not significant. This simulation provided the opportunity to determine whether a relationship exists between the value of a portfolio of option 5The author considered dividing his data into two or three groups by a random sampling procedure, and running the simulation on each group. Since each of the samples would be random, however, each should be representative of the population and therefore yield similar results.

Figure 4 shows the value of the portfolio which initially contained $500,000 in relation to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, over the period con- sidered. These two variables have a correlation coefficient of +.57, significant at the 5 percent level. This significant correla- tion coefficient was expected because of the negative correlation found between outcomes grouped by trade date and the Dow Jones Av- erage.

The Use of Leverage The extent to which put and call option sales and stock purchased to hedge calls can be margined has been discussed in ChapterIIL1 The capital used to do this margining can itself be obtained via loans on other financial securities. The amount of leverage which can be introduced in such a situation is well illustrated by the following example which is based on the financial structure and op- erating policy of a firm presently in business. An investment company could be formed which has the paid-up life insurance policies of its owners, with face value equal to $1,000,000 as its only assets.2 The corporation should be able to borrow $900,000 1 See p. 39. 2The firm on which this example is based was formed from the corporate shell of another company with a tax loss carry-forward.

This capital could be used to purchase high quality securities which, in turn, could be deposited with a bank as collateral for a loan equal to 70 percent of their market value. After this loan was made, the ccrpany would have $900,000 invested in securities for their appreciation potential and have $630,000 in cash which it could use to hedge calls or margin puts. Over 50 per- cent leverage has been introduced into the financial structure of the firm. Even more leverage could be created by using minimum margins on option sales--but this introduces a much greater danger of the company's being wiped out through a large drop in the market prices of the stocks optioned. Protection One obvious example of option contract sales that were made purely for protection reasons can be found in the option data studied. Options 741 to 748 were 21-day calls on Brunswick Corporation. They were sold at a striking price of $35-1/8 when Brunswick's market price was $45-1/8 for a premium of $937.50. Since the price of the stock went up, the option writing profit program calculated that the writer lost $62.50 plus canmission costs and transfer tax fees. At $45-1/8, Brunswick was selling near its low for the year, The option writer, therefore, can be assumed to have sold the calls to protect his Brunswick stock from further loss. Any loss due to a further price decline in Brunswick stock would be compensated for by the premium he received from the sale of the call. This method of protecting stock from a price decline has the same effect as buying",

The option writing profit program uses actual cash flows to calculate profitability. An analogous protected position could be taken by an option writer who is short on stock which he thinks may rise in price if certain events occur in the short term future. The option writer could sell a put well above the market to protect his position. Any loss on a rise in the price of the stock is compensated for by the premium received from the sale of the put. Protecting a short position by selling a put has the same effect as protecting the position by buying a call. The advantages obtained from selling calls or puts to protect stock positions cannot be reflected in the profit results calculated. For the specific set of put and call options studied, only the Bruns- wick options cited above seem to have been purchased for protection reasons. Tax Advantaes Obtainable with Put and Call Options The provisions of the Federal tax statutes make possible certain put and call operations which can greatly enhance option writing profitability. Under present income tax regulations, premiums re- ceived on options which expire are treated as ordinary income. If a call is exercised, the premium received by the writer is added to the striking price in arriving at the gain or loss on the sale of the stock optioned.

The procedures are not specifically allowed by the Internal Revenue Service. It is believed that a consistent policy in the treatment of gains and losses, within the basic requirements of the law outlined above, is a sufficient basis for the legality of these procedures. Which of the procedures are actually used by option writers depends on their tax position. Creating a Lo g Tem Gain on Stock Held Less Than Six Months The example given earlier in this chapter where calls were sold on Brunswick stock for protection reasons can be used to illustrate the creation of a long-term gain. Assume that the present market price of Brunswick stock at the time options 741 to 748 were sold was its high price for the year and that the option writer had held this stock just under six months. By selling a call exercisable well below the market, the option writer is protecting himself against a price fall and trying to equal the six-month capital gains holding period requirement. 3See Filer, o. ci__., supra p. 2 , for a fuller discussion of these income tax regulations. 4'Most of the information on these procedures was found in a pamphlet Functional Put and Call Vriting published by Henry Blair and Ccmpany, Member, Put and Call Brokers and Dealers Association, Inc.",

    "text": "111 Creatin _ Lw Tern Gain and a Short Term Loss on Stock Used to Hedge a Call Often a writer will sell a call option where the stock optioned appreciates considerably in value. Rather than deliver the stock he has used to hedge the option, he can buy the stock on the open market when the option is called, hold the stock he originally acquired to hedge the call until six months have elapsed, and claim a long term gain and a short term loss. For example, assume a six-month call on a stock is sold at a striking price of $50 for a premium of $600. The stock goes to $80 after six months and three days and the call is exercised. The writer could deliver the stock he is using to hedge the option and claim a $2400 short-term loss and sell the stock he held for six months for a $3000 long term gain. The net gain to the option writer from the second procedure is a function of his tax advantage from having a $600 long-term gain as opposed to a $600 short- term gain. The writer might also have some short-term capital gains which could be offset by the short-term capital loss. Avoiding Wash Sale Provisions of the Tax Law An individual may wish to claim a capital loss on stock he owns and wish to recapture his position in the stock at its present market price. He can avoid the tax law's wash sale provision by selling his stock and selling a 35-day put well above the market price of the stock. when the put is exercised on its expiration date, the required 31 days will have passed before a position in the stock was recaptured. The cost to the option writer is approximately equal to the commissions involved in the transactions.",

Then a put on the stock would be sold well above the market. When the stock sells 'ex- dividend', the put striking price is reduced by the amount of the dividend. When the stock is now put to the writer, his new cost basis is the original striking price less the dividend paid less the premium received. This method of reacquiring the stock is approxi- mately equivalent to having sold the stock immediately before it went ex-dividend and reacquiring it immediately after it went ex- dividend. A question arises, however, as to why the individual would want to hold a position in a high dividend-paying stock to begin with. The only appropriate answer seems to be the capital protection pro- vided by preferred stocks which are stocks that pay high dividends. Creating Dividend Income and Short Term Loss With No Market Risk Such a procedure is especially desirable for corporations, because of the 85 per cent exclusion on dividend income they enjoy. This procedure is a bit more complicated than those previously con- sidered because it utilizes the fact that a stock is selling ex- dividend as a basis for claiming a capital loss. The corporation would buy a high dividend-paying stock and sell a call on the stock well below its market price. When the stock sells ex-dividend, the",

The premium received frcm the sale of the call option protects the cor- poration frma any greater loss. If the corporation has short-term capital gains to offset, it has almost doubled its net income by the use of this procedure. For example, assume a corporation had a short-term gain of $5000 from which it normally would keep $2400 at a 52 per cent tax rate. If $5000 of short-term capital loss and $5000 of dividend income were added to the picture, the short-term gain would be offset and the corporation would keep 92 per cent of $5000, or $4600. Creating a Short Term Gain and an Income Loss With a Minimum of Market Risk An individual with short-term losses and long-term gains would benefit from this procedure. The method is exactly the opposite from the one for creating dividend income and short-term loss. A high dividend-paying stock is sold short and a put is sold on the stock at a price well above the market. When the stock sells ex-dividend, the option writer is charged with ordinary income loss for the dividends he must pay on his short position. His short-term gain equals the short sale proceeds less the cost basis of the stock put to him. This cost basis will equal the original put striking price less the dividends paid less the premium received. This procedure has minimum market risk because the option premium received protects the option writer against a sizeable decline in the stock price.

Since duration and outcome are highly correlated, this result is somewhat negatively biased because of the exclusion of six-month options written during the last six months of the period under con- sideration. The correlation coefficient between duration and outcome, +.70, is significant at the 10 per cent level. Some additional negative distortion is introduced into the profit result because the option contracts studied were concentrated toward the middle and end of the period under consideration. This concen- tration is not meant to imply that option sales were bunched during periods which were unprofitable for option writing. Rather, the activities of the option writing agents were not fully under way during the beginning of the period, which resulted in relatively fewer contracts being written at this time. Since this was a profitable time to write options using a calls-hedged, puts-margined strategy because it preceded a rising market, profit results of the option writing activ- ity are somewhat understated. While the tax benefits obtainable from put and call option writ- ing can be substantial, no indication of tax-oriented option writing was found in the data used for this study. On same options, however, writers appear to have suffered small losses by selling calls well below the market in order to protect themselves against a large loss from a 115",

In future studies of actual option writing profitability, close contact with the option writers studied would be desirable to be sure that diff- erences in profitability associated with tax and protection-oriented option writing are recognized. If the option writers had kept the entire premiums received instead of paying their agents a 13.5 per cent commission, they would have had an average profit of 0.9 per cent, or $52 per option contract sold. Whether the services provided by the option writers' agent in obtaining higher premiums, maintaining contact with option dealers, and maintaining records for the option writers is worth an average of $60 per option contract sold, is an interesting question. Determining the extent of the difference, if any, between the premiums received by option writers acting independently and the writers' agent would be a fruitful area for further research. It could then be de- termined how much option writers are paying for the other services provided by their agent. While option writers on the average lost money, 50 of the 76 writers considered in this study made a profit. Considering the writers' opportunity costs, however, 33 out of the 50 writers who made a profit and 22 of the 26 writers who lost money would have had higher profits by not writing options. The writer's opportunity cost is considered to be the price change on previously owned stock used to hedge call options, plus the earnings on other capital used to hedge and margin options, assumed invested at 5 per cent over the duration of the option contract.",

This study has shown that options can be written profitably with small amounts of capital devoted to the activity. Not enough evidence is available, however, to properly evaluate the risks of loss involved due to lack of di- versification. While evidence of negative correlation between var- iation of one's initial capital and amounts of capital devoted to option writing has been found, the results of one of the two tests made is not sufficiently significant to draw any conclusions. It is possible, however, to lose 20 or 30 per cent of one's capital on the first option contract sold with capital on the order of magnitude of $5000 invested. The relative frequency of gains or losses with small amounts of capital invested in option writing has not been determined. The Effect of Option Writing on the Writer's Investment Portfolio An investor can use option writing to add stocks to or delete stocks from his portfolio of securities. The more intensive option writer, however, has his primary interest in option writing as an investment activity. The danger present for such an individual is that he will let his non-option-writing investments be affected by the option writing activity in such a manner as to weaken the quality level of his total security holdings. An investment portfolio of weaker quality level would be more subject to fluctuations in value due to changes in stock market price levels. The option writers studied do not seem to have had their non- option-writing investments affected by the option writing activity. No significant difference in the quality level of stock: on which",

Stock purchased to hedge calls which could be added to the writer's investment portfolio if not called also did not have a significantly different quality level. The quality measure used in evaluating the effect of option writing on an investor's portfolio was devised by the Value Line Investment Service. This measure, based on historical stability in price behavior and growth in earnings and dividends, has a positive correlation with the direction of price movements in the stocks valued. It is the type of quality measure that option writers using a calls-hedged, puts-margined strategy could use to their advantage in determining the stocks on which to sell options. It is interesting to note the high correlation coefficient between the quality rating and the average investment per option written in each quality group, .90. The significant correlation coefficient indicates that the higher quality stocks are usually the higher priced ones. This hypothesis is borne out by a positive correlation between option outcome and option striking price. Option Writing Strategy The calls-hedged, puts-margined strategy used by the option writers was the cause of the significant negative correlation at the 1 per cent level between option writing profitability classified by trade date and the movement of stock prices as represented by the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

There is a positive correlation at the 5 per cent level between the Dow Jones Average and the value of a hypothetical option writer's portfolio with initial capital of $500,000 devoted solely to option writing. The option writers' strategy of hedging calls and margining puts was the most profitable \"pure\" strategy they could have used during the period studied. This strategy was best because the stock market had a predominantly upward trend over the option writing period considered. If there had been a predominantly downward trend in the stock market, a strategy of puts-hedged and calls-margined would probably have been preferred. This dependence on stock market move- ments suggests that in a period of selectivity in stock price advances, when the market itself is not moving up or down, a calls- and puts- margined strategy might yield the highest profit. The desirability of writing straddles under a strategy where calls are hedged is questionable. If just margined puts and hedged calls were sold on different stocks, writers would eliminate the occurrence of having large double losses on straddles resulting from a sizeable drop in the price of the stock optioned. This substitution of puts and calls for straddles is equivalent to diversifying to reduce risk. The sale of a straddle, in effect a margined put and a hedged call, is equivalent to selling two margined puts on the same stock. Such a position offers no diversification at all. Because large double losses from hedged straddles are auto- matically eliminated, a strategy where all options are initially",

Therefore, a \"mixed\" strategy, where all options are initially margined but hedged if sufficiently adverse price movements occur, may be the most desirable. Such a strategy would eliminate sizeable losses from severe price movements in any direction. If a price reversal of sufficient magnitude occurs, the hedged position could revert back to a margined position. For a mixed strategy to be the most effective strategy, the large losses eliminated would have to be greater than the losses caused by not having a hedged position. The author, therefore, suggests investigation of the effects of mixed strategies as the main area for future research in the area of put and call option writing. By comparing how a writer using a mixed strategy would have done relative to the actual writing strategy used, perhaps using the data studied in this thesis, the merit of put and call option writing as an investment activity can be further evaluated. This study has shown that option writing was not profitable as a whole over the 21-month period considered. Even though the actual profit result may be somewhat negatively distorted, the evidence indicates that option writing under the strategies investigated cannot be considered a desirable investment medium in its own right. Therefore, option writing may be useful only as an auxiliary activity in the management of an investment portfolio. Options can be written on stocks presently owned or desired and advantages due to the tax and protection features of option writing can be utilized.",
