This effect is driven by investors’ utility preferences which lead them to over-pay for the risk reduction benefits of long puts instead of valuing options on the basis of expected returns. Investors can exploit this implied skewness premium by trading standard, exchange-traded index options. We also show that including risk-reversals in an equity portfolio creates a better portfolio (as measured by Sharpe ratio) compared to a pure index position.

    "text": "Understanding volatility is important to investors. Not only is volatility a source of risk, but it is now traded as an asset class. Researchers have reached a consensus that implied volatility is generally overpriced and that short positions in variance, either through swaps or delta-hedged options, produce positive returns. However, far less is understood about what specific characteristics of implied volatility leads to these returns and how these characteristics relate to each other. In this note we examine a particular implied volatility strategy: the risk-reversal. We document the profits from trading risk-reversals, selling an out-of-the-money put and buying an out-of-the-money call with the same time to expiry. Conceptually, we can think of this risk-reversal premium as analogous to the beta of a stock, which quantifies the relationship between the stock’s returns and those of the broad market. The idea of beta was proposed in the Capital Asset Pricing Model (Treynor, 1962, Sharpe, 1964, Lintner, 1965 and Mossin, 1966)) in the 1960’s but since then the concept has been extended to various factors. The first to do this were Fama and French (1993) with their three-factor model. In addition to the overall market beta, this model included value and size factors. Similarly, we view the risk-reversal premium as a sub- factor of the well documented variance risk premium: the tendency of implied variance to be higher than the subsequent realized variance. Just as an equity portfolio can benefit from exposure to smart equity beta factors, a volatility portfolio will benefit from including each of these variance premia. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section Two, we discuss the variance risk premium and the risk-reversal premium. In Section Three, we show that delta-hedged risk-reversal positions, where we are short puts and long calls, generate positive returns for several broad equity index ETFs. In Section Four we show that a portfolio that holds short risk-reversals outperforms pure index portfolios in a mean-variance sense. Section Five suggests further work and concludes. 2. Variance, Straddles and Risk-Reversals The variance risk premium is the phenomenon that implied variance tends to over-estimate future realized variance. Early proposals to monetize this effect were Dupire (1993) and Neuberger (1990) who wrote about profiting from the replicated implied variance from option strips (Breeden and Litzenberger, 1978). Other work along this line was done by Carr and Madan (1998), Demeterfi, Derman, Kamal and Zou (1999) and Britten-Jones and Neuberger (2000). Empirical studies were carried out by Wu (2011), using the returns of traded variance swaps, and by Carr and Wu (2009b), using synthetic variance swaps. There are several reasons for this phenomenon. The effect can be re-expressed as an implied skewness premium (Kozhan et al, 2011) or an implied correlation premium (Driessen et al, 2009), but these are re- statements of the phenomenon rather than explanations. Broadly, both of these explanations say that investor demand for options exceeds supply. Most investors are long equities and would use options for downside protection (Between November 1996 and October 2019 the ratio of index puts to index calls traded on the CBOE averages 1.20.). This directly increases out-of-the-money put prices (Garleanu et al, 2005), which in turn increases the implied volatility of other options as market-makers spread their 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3968542",

    "text": "volatility risk. Further, many retail investors are prohibited by their brokers from selling options at all, removing another possible source of supply (Gromb and Vaynos, 2010, and references therein). Formally, the utility function of investors encourages them to buy options for protection rather than evaluating trades on the basis of their expected profitability (Driessen and Maenhout, 2007). To see the relationship between the variance premium and option returns, we first consider a variance swap. A variance swap can be replicated from a strip of European call and put options, weighted by the inverse of the square of their strikes. The fair strike of the variance swap is, 2𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑟𝑇) 𝐹 1 ∞ 1 𝑋 = (∫ 𝑃(𝑋)𝑑𝑋+∫ 𝐶(𝑋)𝑑𝑋) (1) 𝑣𝑎𝑟 𝑇 0 𝑋2 𝐹 𝑋2 Where X is the strike P and C are European put and call options respectively R is the risk-free rate T is the time until expiration and F is the forward price of the underlying at that time. This is the risk-neutral variance. But because it uses all strikes, it is impossible to tell what particular options cause the overpricing relative to the subsequent realized variance. To do this we need to examine the returns of particular delta-hedged option positions. First consider the straddle. The price of an option straddle depends directly (and nearly linearly) on the implied volatility. This is easily seen by using the Brenner and Subrahmanyam (1988) approximation for the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) value of at-the-money options. 𝐶 = 𝑃 ≈ 0.4𝑆𝜎√𝑇 (2) 𝐴𝑇𝑀 𝐴𝑇𝑀 So 𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑙𝑒 ≈ 0.8𝑆𝜎√𝑇 (3) 𝐴𝑇𝑀 The instantaneous profit of a (short) straddle is proportional to the difference between implied and realized variance. 𝑃𝐿 = 1 𝑆2Γ(𝜎2 −𝜎2 ) (4) 2 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑑 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 So, both the price and the return of the straddle directly depend on the implied variance. (Equation 4 is derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton equation and hence applies in the risk-neutral world. In the real world where returns cannot be continuously hedged, returns of the stock also contribute to profits or losses.) 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3968542",

    "text": "The short straddle strategy directly trades the implied volatility of the options against the subsequent realized volatility of the underlying. If implied volatility is higher than the realized volatility, on average a short straddle will be profitable (This effect is only true on average due to path dependency. Even when implied is higher than realized, it is quite possible for the short straddle to lose money (Sinclair, 2013)). A number of researchers use straddle trading strategies to evaluate volatility forecasts (for example, Noh et al. (1994), Engle and Rosenberg (2000)). But straddles can also be traded with no volatility forecast, where we aim to passively collect a premium. An early discussion of how options were over- priced was in the book, “The Put and Call” by Leonard Higgins (Higgins, 1906, from Dotsis, 2020). The author writes how traders on the London Stock Exchange first determine a statistical fair value for options then “add to the “average value” of the put and call an amount which will give a fair margin of profit”. That is, a variance risk premium was added. Coval and Shumway (2001) show that an at-the- money straddle position consistently produces negative returns, as does Londono, 2011. However, it is well known that underlying returns are not normally distributed, and higher order moments need to be considered when pricing options. To avoid arbitrage, the price of an option is equal to its discounted expected payoff over the risk-neutral distribution. However, a specific risk-neutral distribution needs to be chosen. The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model assumes the underlying price has a lognormal distribution, but this is not an accurate description of the real market. Early studies to show that the physical distribution was not lognormal were Osborne (1959) and Mandelbrot (1963). And Mandelbrot cited the much earlier work of Mitchell (1915), Oliver (1926) and Mills (1927). This research has been corroborated many times since. Even allowing for the fact that the risk-neutral distribution and physical distribution are different, the lognormal is clearly an inappropriate choice. Many alternative stochastic processes for the underlying price have been proposed, which would lead to different, more realistic, risk-neutral distributions (see for example, Cox and Ross (1976), Bates (1991), Hull and White (1987)). In general, traders have taken a different approach. They price options using the BSM model (or a suitable modification to account for any early exercise features) but use a different volatility input for each strike. Volatility as a function of strike forms the implied volatility curve, smile or smirk. Breeden and Litzenberger (1978) showed that the implied risk-neutral distribution could be calculated from the implied volatility smile. Many studies have since shown that the implied risk-neutral density is more negatively skewed than the lognormal distribution. Further, the implied risk-neutral skewness is generally greater in magnitude than the subsequent realized skewness. This is not necessarily irrational and nor is it due to the options embedding an incorrect forecast of the future realized skewness. Unlike in the case of a straddle, where implied volatility dictates price and realized volatility dictates returns, the implied skew premium has very little to do with the skewness of the underlying. Further, just as with the ATM volatility premium, the implied skew premium is time varying and will sometimes trade at a discount. The expected profit from a hedged risk-reversal is mainly driven by the correlation between the underlying price and the level of volatility. Consider an investor who is short out-of-the-money puts and long out-of-the-money calls. As the underlying rises, her net vega exposure will increase. Hence, she benefits from a positive correlation between the volatility level and the underlying price. Or more properly, she is betting that the correlation between volatility and the underlying price is less negative 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3968542",

Far out-of-the-money strikes will generally not be well fit by a quadratic. So while we could use any delta risk-reversal to calculate the skew, the 25-delta options are a good compromise between being close enough to the at-the-money strike for the quadratic parametrization to work well, and being far enough away that the absolute difference between 25-delta put and 25-delta call volatility is significant. While the profit (or loss) of a hedged risk-reversal does not depend greatly on the skewness of the underlying (refer to Equation Five), Equation 14 says that the entry price is entirely determined by the implied skewness. There have been many studies that show out-of-the-money put options are overpriced (for example, Coval and Shumway, 2001, Ait-Sahlia et al, 2001 and Bondarenko, 2014). However, risk-reversals have not been studied to the same extent. In the same way that investors utility preferences lead them to buy puts, there are also many investors who sell calls as part of a covered call strategy (REF). Finally calls are not typically bought as hedges, further lowering demand. Together, these effects create a risk- reversal premium which is distinct from the variance premium. Bergomi (2009) and Sepp (2010) presented some empirical data but both studies mainly focused on the theoretical valuation of the option strategy and the empirical study was presented as an illustration. To our knowledge, ours is the most comprehensive empirical study of risk-reversals. 3. Harvesting the Risk-Reversal Premium 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3968542",

Our test uses IVolatility daily end of day prices spanning the period from January the 18th, 2005 to the 31st of December, 2019. Option strikes are the listed strikes on the contemporaneous SPY price but the hedge uses a back-adjusted SPY price series to account for dividends. The sample consists of 3766 trading days. The interest rate used when calculating excess returns for the Sharpe ratio calculations is the overnight Fed funds rate from the St. Lois Federal Reserve (available at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFF).

    "text": "While this example shows the clear existence of a premium in the delta-hedged risk-reversal, this implementation is far from what traders would do in practice (Sinclair, 2013). Common industry practice is to let the delta of a position fluctuate within a certain band and only re-hedge when those bands are crossed. In our case, whenever the net delta of the options either drops below 20 or above 40, the portfolio is rebalanced by closing the position and re-establishing with the options that are now closest to 15-delta in the same expiration.

It may be counter-intuitive that the more aggressively hedged version of the strategy performs worse on both an absolute and risk adjusted basis, but this is due to the increased path dependency of the more loosely hedged implementation (Sinclair, 2013). No general inference should be drawn from this strategy on the single historical price path. Even this loosely hedged implementation involved doing 631 trades, which in practice would incur significant transaction costs. If we assume sells were filled at the bid prices and buys were filled at the offer price, results are obviously worse.

The simplest way to reduce transaction costs is to trade fewer times. Lower costs come at the expense of higher variance (Sinclair, 2013) (there is also increased path dependency but that will not be evident when looking at a single historical price series). In a practical application, this result could almost certainly be improved by using a utility-based optimal hedging method (see for example, Hodges and Neuberger, 1989 and Zakamuline, 2009). Choosing different maturity options does not significantly change results, probably because the magnitude of Vanna does not change greatly with time and Equation 5 states that P/L is proportional to Vanna. The 15-delta risk reversal is not exceptional in producing a profit but does seem to be near the peak delta choice. Other delta choices also show similar profits. Table Four gives the summary statistics when implementing the same strategy for risk-reversals ranging from 10-delta to 30-delta. Statistic 10-Delta 15-Delta 20-Delta 25-Delta 30-Delta Allowable Net-Delta 10/30 20/40 30/50 40/60 50/70 Range CAGR 3.0% 9.6% 6.1% 5.6% 4.5% Volatility 6.4% 8.7% 9.4% 8.9% 9.2% Sharpe Ratio 0.24 1.1 0.55 0.53 0.39 Maximum Drawdown 16.1% 22.6% 26.7% 23.4% 30.4% Table Four: Summary Statistics for the hedged SPY risk reversals of various deltas. The fact that the peak return (and Sharpe ratio) is near the 15-delta risk reversal agrees with the theoretical prediction of Equation Five. For typical implied volatility smiles, this delta is close to the maximum vanna position. This is shown in Figure Three. As profit is directly proportional to vanna, these strikes will also give greatest dollar returns. (It need not necessarily follow that return on margin would also be maximized but in practice it was). The low return of the 10-delta risk reversal reversal is because these tend to have very little premium and hence have very little volatility value. For example, on the first day in the sample the 10-delta risk- reversal had a value of 0.04.

Next, we determined that the return series for the ETFs and the corresponding 15-delta risk-reversals are not drawn from the same distribution by applying a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In all cases, the null hypothesis that the ETF and risk-reversal returns come from the same distribution is rejected at the 0.001 level. To an investor, the important aspect of instruments being “different” is they can be combined in a diversified portfolio that is in some sense better than each individual asset. This is the case with the risk- reversals. Our choice for portfolio construction is to find the optimal number of risk-reversals to hold with 100 shares of SPY. The hedged 15-delta risk reversal consists of one risk-reversal and short 30 shares. So, when combined with 100 shares of SPY a one risk-reversal portfolio would consist of 70 shares, one short 15-delta put and long one 15-delta call. The portfolio composition was chosen to maximize the Sharpe ratio. In practice, investors could have other risk targets, possibly looking to match the volatility of the underlying ETF or to minimize drawdown.

It is important to note that while the historically realized risk has been acceptable (similar to the underlying ETF), by adding the short puts, we have raised the probability and consequences of a catastrophic scenario. While some losses will be mitigated by the vega of the long calls responding to the corresponding increase in implied volatility, in the worst-case scenario when the ETF drops below the short put strike, a one-to-one portfolio will be long more delta than a pure equity position. The fact that this has not occurred in the time period used in our test, does not mean it is impossible. In practice, investors may choose to arbitrarily cap their risk-reversal exposure because of this. 5. Conclusion We have shown that selling risk-reversals on US equity ETFs has been a profitable strategy. This premium accrues to delta-hedged portfolios, so it provides a diversifying component to long equity positions. 12 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3968542",

    "text": "Although this is to our knowledge the most comprehensive published examination of risk-reversal returns, it is still very preliminary. Most importantly, whether risk-reversals are systematically mispriced in other assets is unknown. Further, a comprehensive study of the relationship between the implied skewness premium and the variance risk premium should be carried out. Finally, the empirical results presented here could possibly be improved in practice. Just as traders wanting to harvest the variance risk premium forecast both realized and implied volatilities, the risk-reversal trade could benefit from forecasting the realized correlation between underlying and implied volatility (analogous to forecasting realized volatility), and the implied skewness expressed in Equation 14. Nonetheless, we have shown that the risk-reversal has been significantly mispriced in US equity indices and that this can be traded as a hedged, market neutral strategy or used as a component of a directional portfolio. 6.
