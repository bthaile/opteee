Schmidt HfB - Business School of Finance & Management Centre for Practical Quantitative Finance, 60314 Frankfurt May 24, 2006 Abstract When pricing the convexity effect in irregular interest rate deriva- tives such as, e.g., Libor-in-arrears or CMS, one often ignores the volatility smile, which is quite pronounced in the interest rate options market. This note solves the problem of convexity by replicating the irregular interest flow or option with liquidly traded options with dif- ferent strikes thereby taking into account the volatility smile. This idea is known among practitioners for pricing CMS caps. We ap- proach the problem on a more general scale and apply the result to various examples.

This convexity correction involves the volatility of the underlying rate as traded in the cap/floor or swaption market. In the same spirit, an option on an irregular rate, such as an in-arrears cap or a CMS cap, is often valued by applying a Black & Scholes model with a convexity adjusted forward rate and a convex- ity adjusted volatility, see e.g. [1], [3], [5], [6]. However, to a large extent, this approach ignores the volatility smile, which is quite pronounced in the cap/floor market. This note solves this problem by replicating the irregular interestfloworoptionwithliquidlytradedoptionswithdifferentstrikes. This approach is well-known among practitioners for pricing CMS caps. There is a certain overlap of the present paper with a recent paper by Hagan, [4]. However, we approach the problem from a different and more generic point of view and apply the result to various examples related to interest rates. We illustrate the approach by numerical examples based on market data for the volatility smile in the interest rate derivatives market. Comparing the results of the “smile convexity” with the results from a more simplistic approach based solely on adjusted forward rates (which is still frequently used in practice) we show that the smile effect on the convexity is by no means just an additional tiny quantity and cannot be ignored in practice. Another important consequence of the replication approach is that one obtains immediately the respective simultaneous delta and vega hedges in terms of liquidly traded options. 2 Setup of the problem Consider a financial underlying with price Y > 0 at time T. Suppose there is a liquid market for plain vanilla options on this underlying with all possible strikes K. Somewhat more general, we suppose that for all K ≥ 0 the price P(K) today of the “plain vanilla” derivative with payoff g(Y)max(Y −K,0) at time T is known. Here g is a certain function with g(y) > 0 whose role will become clear in the examples below. In the simplest case g ≡ 1 and the liquidly traded options are just calls on the underlying Y. Our goal is to price an exotic contingent claim with payoff f(Y), 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1375581",

    "text": "at time T, where f : (0,∞) → (−∞,∞). The idea is to replicate the exotic payoff f(Y) by a portfolio of traded derivatives g(Y)max(Y −K,0) with different strikes K. If this is possible, then the replication is the key to incorporating the volatility smile of the liquid options into the pricing of the exotic derivative. So we are looking for a representation Z f(Y) = C + g(Y)max(Y −K,0)dµ(K) (1) [0,∞) with some locally finite signed measure µ on [0,∞) and some constant C. If such a representation exists, then by no-arbitrage the fair price P(f(Y)) of the contingent claim f(Y) is given by Z P(f(Y)) = C ·B(0,T)+ P(K)dµ(K), (2) [0,∞) whereB(0,T)denotesthepriceofazerobondwithmaturityT, andprovided the integral on the right hand side is well-defined. Remark. The importance of the formula (2) goes beyond the issue of just pricing a derivative with payoff f(Y), since, at the same time, it provides us with an explicit strategy for a simultaneous delta and vega hedge of the derivative f(Y) in terms of liquidly traded products g(Y)max(Y −K,0). In practice one would discretize the integral appropriately to get an (approxi- mate) hedging strategy in a finite set of products g(Y)max(Y −K ,0) with i different strikes K ,i = 1,... i 3 Target applications related to irregular in- terest rate derivatives The examples that we have in mind and that we are trying to approach with the above idea are irregular interest rate cash flows or options on such rates. We denote by B(t,T) the price at time t of a zero bond with maturity T.

The standard caplet paying at time T is equivalent to a product that 2 pays the amount ∆ max(L(T ,T )−K,0) 1 2 1+∆L(T ,T ) 1 2 at time T .

We identify the signed measure µ with its generalized right continu- ous distribution function, µ(0−) = 0.

(cid:3) Remark. It is well known that from a universe of prices of call options2, P(K) = Emax(Y −K,0), for all strikes K > 0 one can extract the implied risk-neutral distribution F (x) = P(Y ≤ x) of the underlying asset Y at maturity by taking the Y derivative of the call prices w.r.t. the strike, F (x) = P(Y ≤ x) = 1+D P(x), Y + seee.g. [2]. Then,byno-arbitragethepriceofanyhedgeablecontingentclaim can be calculated as the expectation w.r.t. this distribution. In particular, for a derivative with payoff f(Y) the price is Z ∞ Z ∞ P(f(Y)) = E(f(Y)) = f(x)dF (x) = f(x)dD P(x).

    "text": "Now applying4 the replication formulae (18), (19) to a Libor-in-arrears swap or an in-arrears cap the questions arises what would be a reasonable benchmark for comparing the results? We compare the results from our replication with the results of a somewhat naive but quite popular approach in practice. There, one uses just a convexity adjusted forward rate to take careofthein-arrearseffect. Theconvexityadjustedforwardrateiscalculated as in (20) with σ set to the at-the-money volatility. For an in-arrears caplet then, in addition to the adjusted forward rate, the volatility for the caplet is taken from the smile according to the strike rate of the caplet. Of course, from the modeling point of view this seems to be a rather inconsistent way of taking care of the in-arrears and the smile effect simultaneously. In the table below the corresponding results are labeled “adj Fwd”. A second benchmark is based on a convexity adjusted forward as above, but the original volatility σ for the respective strike is also adjusted for the in-arrears effect to a new volatility σ∗ by the formula (cid:20) (1+∆L (T ,T ))(1+∆L (T ,T )exp(2σ2T )) (cid:21) (σ∗)2 = σ2 +ln 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 /T , (1+∆L (T ,T )exp(σ2T ))2 1 0 1 2 1 cf. [1], Section 4.1. This is labeled “adj Fwd & Vol”. Herearetheresultsfora10yearsin-arrearscapwithsemi-annualperiods5 fordifferentstrikes.

The case of strike K = 0% corresponds to the floating leg of a Libor-in-arrears swap. 4We use Gauss Legendre quadrature and integrate over strikes from 0% to 20%. 5The caps consist of 19 caplets, with the first one starting in 6 months. 15 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1375581",

The volatility for this swaption is then the 2Y into 10Y at-the-money volatility of 16.60% plus 0.16%. Now, applying6 the replication formulae (23), (25) to a CMS cap we compare the results again to the results from naive approaches based on convexity adjusted forward CMS rates and adjusted volatilities. Of course, the volatility for the cap strike is always taken by interpolation from the swaption volatility surface. The convexity adjusted forward swap rate is calculated from the forward swap rate C (T ,T ) (cf. (16)) by 0 0 n (cid:20) (cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:21) B(0,T )−B(0,T ) C (T ,T ) 1+ 1− 0 n (exp(σ2 T )−1) 0 0 n C (T ,T )B(0,p) Pn ∆ atm 0 0 0 n i=1 i usingtheat-the-moneyvolatilityσ , cf. [1], formula(28). Belowtheresults atm of this approach are labeled “adj Fwd”. Results labeled as “adj Fwd & Vol” refer to the situation where, in addition to the adjustment of the forward rate, also the volatility σ for the respective strike is adjusted for the CMS effect to a new volatility σ∗ calculated by (see [1], Section 4.1) (cid:20) (α+β C (T ,T ))(α+β C (T ,T )exp(2σ2T )) (cid:21) (σ∗)2 = σ2 +ln p 0 0 n p 0 0 n 0 /T , (α+β C (T ,T )exp(σ2T ))2 0 p 0 0 n 0 where α,β are defined in (14), (15). p Here are the results for a 10 years CMS cap with semi-annual periods for different strikes. The tenor of the CMS rate is 10Y. The first row shows the sum of all caplets with individual caplet prices in the rows below. The case ¯ of strike K = 0% corresponds to the floating leg of a CMS swap. 6Again we use Gauss Legendre quadrature. 19 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1375581",

Clearly, this cannot be ignored7. The naive approaches, although taking into account the smile by taking the caplet volatility from the swaption smile, show a significant mispricing relative to the correct valuations based on the replication (23), (25). Observe that the results are sensitive to the significance of the swaption smile. Comparing the results of the two replication approaches (23), (25), it turns out that the replication based on the idea of cash-settled swaptions consistently leads to slightly higher CMS caplet prices. It is not clear which approachissuperior,sincebothrelyonassumptionsthatarehardtocompare and value against each other.

It seems that these differences can be attributed to the swaption smile. 8This is the caplet starting in 9.5 years on a 10Y CMS rate.

    "text": "results of standard (naive) convexity adjustment valuations and quotes by brokers. It seems that these differences can be attributed to the swaption smile. 8This is the caplet starting in 9.5 years on a 10Y CMS rate. The replication integral was discretized in 1% steps. 22 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=1375581 7 Conclusions We have shown how to evaluate quite popular exotic interest rate derivatives such as Libor-in-arrears caps or CMS caps incorporating the volatility smile present in the cap and swaption market. It turns out that the volatility smile has a significant impact, which, in particular, cannot be ignored when pricing CMS swaps or caps. For Libor-in-arrears derivatives, the smile effect is al- ready relatively accurately captured by naive approaches based on convexity adjustments.
