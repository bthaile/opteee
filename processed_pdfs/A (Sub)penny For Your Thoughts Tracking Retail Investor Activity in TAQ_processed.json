Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874 A (Sub)penny For Your Thoughts: Tracking Retail Investor Activity in TAQ ABSTRACT We placed 85,000 retail trades in six retail brokerage accounts from December 2021 to June 2022 to validate the Boehmer et al. (2021) algorithm, which uses subpenny trade prices to identify and sign retail trades. The algorithm identifies 35% of our trades as retail, incorrectly signs 28% of identified trades, and yields uninformative order imbalance measures for 30% of stocks. We modify the algorithm by signing trades using the quoted spread midpoints. The quote midpoint method does not affect identification rates but reduces the signing error rates to 5% and provides informative order imbalance measures for all stocks.

The quote midpoint method does not affect identification rates but reduces the signing error rates to 5% and provides informative order imbalance measures for all stocks. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874 Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, and Zhang (2021), henceforth referred to as BJZZ, propose an algorithm that identifies as retail trades those that are executed off exchanges (typically by wholesalers such as Citadel or Virtu) and receive subpenny price improvement. The key idea relies on Regulation NMS (National Market System), adopted in 2005 by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Rule 612 prohibits the displaying of quotes with decimals below one cent (the “subpenny” rule), while still allowing the execution at prices with fractional cents. Typically, wholesalers offer price improvement to a large fraction of retail trades that are routed to them. Frequently, that price improvement is a subpenny. In contrast, institutional orders are typically not executed by these wholesalers. Accordingly, the BJZZ algorithm assumes that institutions represent a small part of trades that execute at a subpenny off exchanges. In addition, it does not identify off-exchange trades that execute at subpennies between $0.004 and $0.006 as retail because “…trades at or near the half-penny are likely to be from institutions” (BJZZ, p.2251). The BJZZ algorithm also uses the subpenny digit to sign a trade as a buy or sell. Specifically, if the subpenny amount is less (more) than $0.004 ($0.006), the trade is labeled as a sell (buy). BJZZ validate the algorithm using a sample of 117 NASDAQ stocks in 2010 and study the algorithm from 2010 to 2015. The algorithm is the best tool available to identify retail trades in TAQ and, as a result, is quickly gaining widespread use in academic studies to measure the intensity of retail trading and retail investor order imbalance.1 Most of these the studies, however, are set in more recent time periods with substantially different market structures (e.g., no commissions).2 To provide guidance to scholars relying on this method to study retail trading, we ran a trading experiment from December 2021 to June 2022 to evaluate the BJZZ algorithm’s ability to identify and accurately sign trades. We call the rate at which the algorithm correctly identifies our retail trades as the “identification rate” and the rate at which the algorithm correctly signs our 1 Papers that analyze retail volume include Blankespoor et al. (2019); Bushee, Cedergren, and Michels (2020); Bonsall, Green, and Muller (2020); Farrell et. al. (2022); Israeli, Kasznik, and Sridharan (2022); and Guest (2021). Papers that analyze retail order imbalance include Barber, Lin, and Odean (2023); Farrell et. al. (2022); Bradley, Jame, and Williams (2022). 2 After the BJZZ sample period, the SEC Tick Size Pilot TSP, which took place for about two years beginning in October 2016, limited quotes and trades in two test groups (G2/G3) to $0.05 increments with certain exemptions. There is a dramatic drop in subpenny price trades reported on TAQ for stocks in these two groups, so we recommend that scholars generally exclude stocks in these groups during the TSP period.

    "text": "trades as a buy or sell, conditional on the trade being identified, as the “accuracy rate.”3 We also compare BJZZ’s signing method to the Lee and Ready (1991) quote midpoint signing method. To implement the quote midpoint method, we sign a trade as a buy (sell) if the execution price is greater than (less than) the quote midpoint but do not sign trades that execute between 40 and 60% of the National Best Bid or Offer, or NBBO. In summary, we find that the two methods have similar identification rates. However, we find that the use of the subpenny digits to sign trades leads to low accuracy rates for stocks with spreads greater than a penny. In contrast, we find that the quote midpoint method leads to high, homogenous accuracy rates across all stocks. Thus, we recommend that researchers use the quote midpoint method to sign retail trades identified through subpenny pricing. Figure 1 illustrates how the BJZZ subpenny digit and the quote midpoint methods sign trades for stocks that face a spread of one, two, or three cents. When spreads are one penny, the two algorithms are identical in how they sign the direction of trade. When spreads are two cents, however, the subpenny digit method will incorrectly sign trades as buys that execute just below the quote midpoint but have a subpenny digit greater than $0.006; similarly, the method will incorrectly sign trades as sells that execute just above the midpoint but have a subpenny digit less than $0.004. So, the subpenny digit method will create classification errors if trades around the midpoint are common, unlike the quote midpoint rule. For spreads of three cents, misclassifications now occur over a wider range, so the potential problem becomes more pronounced as the spread increases. This issue is the main driver of low accuracy rates for the BJZZ algorithm.4 <Insert Figure 1 about here> In our trading experiment, we executed more than 85,000 trades over a six-month period in six retail brokerage accounts at five different brokers beginning in December 2021. Our main sample focuses on 64,000 trades made in 128 stocks each day. The 128 stocks represent a stratified sample of all stocks, which allows us to draw inferences about the performance of the two algorithms for the average stock and average trade. We conduct several additional targeted trading experiments to test the robustness of our main findings. 3 We refer to the conditional accuracy rate as “accuracy rate” throughout the paper for the sake of brevity. 4 The quote midpoint method signs trades that execute at subpennies between $0.004 and $0.006 (including $0.005) if the trade does not execute between 40 and 60% of the NBBO. 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

    "text": "The BJZZ algorithm identifies 35% of the trades that we placed as retail, which is likely close to results reported in BJZZ.5 Identification rates systematically vary across stocks and the variation is economically large, ranging from 20 to 50%. Subpenny price improvement is much more common for trades with a one penny spread than for trades with spreads greater than a penny. As a result, identification rates drop as spreads increase. Figure 2, Panel A, shows that BJZZ identification rates are close to 40% for stocks with a spread of 5 cents or less, but drop to 28% for stocks with spreads greater than 10 cents. Identification rates using the quote midpoint method are similar since it also relies on subpenny execution to identify retail trades. <Insert Figure 2 about here> Turning to accuracy, the BJZZ algorithm signs 72% of identified trades correctly (a 28% error rate). As with identification, wider spreads are the main reason the subpenny digit fails to accurately sign trade direction. In Figure 2, Panel B, we show that the accuracy rate for the BJZZ algorithm is 93% for identified trades that face a penny spread but drops to 52% when spreads are 10 cents or greater. Note that in our sample, more stocks face a spread of 10 cents or greater than face a penny spread (34% versus 20% as shown on the horizontal axis of Figure 2). For 30% of our stocks, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the signing accuracy rate for the stock is 50%. In contrast, the quote midpoint method accurately signs 95% of identified trades (a 5% error rate) and the accuracy rate does not vary significantly across spread bins. Subpenny signing is sensitive to spread size because of the implicit assumption that retail trades receive minimal price improvement is often violated in our trading experiment. In Figure 3, Panel A, we present a histogram of execution prices for our sell trades relative to the spread conditional on subpenny execution.6 Though the bulk of sell transactions execute just above the bid, a good fraction of trades executes near the midpoint, and even above. In Panel B, we observe analogous patterns for buys, which tend to cluster just below the ask, but with many executions near (or even below) the midpoint. <Insert Figure 3 about here> To visualize the effect of these execution patterns on signing accuracy, we plot signing accuracy for all subpenny trades using either the subpenny digit (as in BJZZ) or the quote 5 BJZZ (2021) do not report a directly comparable number but report that 46% of trades in 117 NASDAQ stocks on retail venues in October 2010 execute at subpennies other than the half-penny. 42% of our trades execute at subpennies other than the half-penny. 6 We also exclude trades that execute at the quote midpoint if it is a half penny since both algorithms do not identify trades that execute at the quote midpoint as retail trades. 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

    "text": "midpoint method in Panel C. Several points are worth noting: The quote midpoint method clearly dominates the subpenny digit method at every trade location. Near the quote midpoint, the subpenny digit method drops below 50% accuracy because spreads quoted in even cent amounts (e.g., $0.02) will incorrectly sign executions that occur near the quote midpoint, as illustrated in Figure 1. However, accuracy drops dramatically near the quote midpoint for the quote midpoint method as well. For this reason, we recommend eliminating trades that occur between 40 and 60 percent of the posted NBBO when applying the quote midpoint method. We should note that our subpenny digit accuracy level of 72% is much lower than the 98.2% reported in BJZZ. This difference can be traced to changes in the size of spreads over time. Penny spreads were much more common in 2010. Figure 4 plots the cumulative density of spreads at six-year intervals beginning in 2010. The figure shows that the frequency of penny spreads has dropped dramatically from about 80% of all off-exchange trades in 2010 to about 40% in 2022. <Insert Figure 4 about here> Since accuracy rates decline as spreads increase, the accuracy of the BJZZ subpenny digit method to sign trades has become less reliable in recent years. In sharp contrast, the quote midpoint method’s accuracy rate of 95% is similar across spread levels (see Figure 2, Panel B.) This is an important improvement for scholars who seek to measure retail order imbalance using off-exchange subpenny trades. As one example, we show that the BJZZ algorithm yields little change in retail order imbalance during the infamous GameStop episode in January 2021, but the quote midpoint method shows a dramatic increase in retail buying (see Internet Appendix Section I and Figure IA.1). While our suggested signing method improves accuracy, it does not improve the identification rate. Our trading experiment suggests that false negative identifications are common (65% of our retail trades are not classified as retail). On the other hand, an algorithm designed to identify retail trades can yield false positives as well (i.e., classify nonretail or institutional trades as retail). BJZZ suggest that one reason to exclude trades near the quote midpoint is because these trades are more likely to be institutional. Unfortunately, we cannot say anything definitive about the rate of false positives, which would require a representative sample of institutional trades to identify the frequency of institutional subpenny price execution off exchanges. Battalio, Jenning, Seglam and Wu (2022) argue that a large proportion of non-retail trades executed by wholesalers execute at subpennies other than a half penny, so the possibility 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

    "text": "that false positives obscure the signal regarding the intensity or direction of retail trade is an important caveat to scholars using the algorithms we study to identify and sign retail trades. Our estimates of identification and accuracy rates are based on a sample of approximately $100 trades in whole shares that we placed in six brokerage accounts at five brokers in 2021 and 2022. These estimates might vary across different trade sizes, brokers, and time. In a limited sample of trades of about $1,000, we find similar results. At larger trade sizes, however, price improvement relative to the spread may be less generous which might generate higher identification and accuracy rates for the subpenny digit method (though the quote midpoint method should still perform well when trades receive minimal price improvement). Price improvement varies systematically across retail brokers (Schwarz et al. 2023; Levy 2022). Thus, our estimates of identification and accuracy rates assume that the brokers that we use (E*Trade, Fidelity, Interactive Brokers, Robinhood, and TD Ameritrade) are representative of the trades placed across all retail brokers. This is a reasonable assumption since the brokers we use execute a large fraction of total retail trading.7 Finally, the prevalence of penny spreads was much greater during the period analyzed by BJZZ so the quote midpoint method would offer somewhat more modest improvements in signing accuracy in these earlier periods.8 Even with these caveats, we conclude that the midpoint quote rule will dominate the subpenny digit rule to assess the direction of orders because of the inherent limitations of the digit to sign trades that face a spread of more than a penny and receive more than de minimis price improvement. Overall, our results have important implications for those who rely on off-exchange subpenny prices to estimate the frequency of retail trading and retail order imbalance. Hypothesis tests about the frequency of retail trading face a joint testing problem. The null hypothesis that two stocks have equal rates of retail trading is a joint test of two hypotheses: first, that retail trading is equal in the two stocks and second, that the ability of the algorithm to identify retail trading is the same in the two stocks. Because subpenny execution is more common for trades that face lower spreads, variation in spreads across stocks or over time will cause the frequency 7 Retail trading activity can be compared across brokers that report “daily average trading” (DAT) statistics. DAT represents average trades per day that generate commissions, fees, or payment for order flow, and now also includes commission-free trades. For the first half of 2022, reported DATs were 4.7MM, 3.0MM, 2.3MM, 2.1MM, and 0.9MM for TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, Robinhood, IBKR, and E*Trade, respectively, for a total of 13.0MM. Thus, our sample accounts for a large fraction (87%) of the seven DAT-reporting brokers (Schwab is at 1.7MM and TradeStation at 0.2MM.) 8 In Internet Appendix Figure IA.2, we show the correlation of daily retail order imbalance for the two methods across stocks averages 86% from 2010 to 2015. Post-2015, the mean daily correlation drops to 67%. Correlations are lower for stocks with more than a penny spread in both periods. These correlations do not capture the attenuation bias caused by the lower accuracy rates, which we describe in the Internet Appendix Section II and Figure IA.7. 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

    "text": "of identified retail trades to vary. Ignoring this variation in identification rates can lead to spurious inferences regarding the intensity of retail trading. Hypothesis tests about retail order imbalance face a similar joint testing problem. The null hypothesis that two stocks have equal retail order imbalance is a joint test of two hypotheses: first, that retail order imbalance is equal in the two stocks and second, that the ability of the algorithm to estimate retail order imbalance is the same for the two stocks. Fortunately, we show that the quote midpoint method that we propose substantially reduces the joint testing problem by breaking the link between spreads and signing accuracy rates. In the remainder of the paper, we describe the experiment (Section II), summarize results (Section III), discuss the issue of false positives and implicit assumptions about excluded trades (Section IV), and conclude (Section V). II. Description of the Experiment In this section, we provide a brief description of the trading experiment. Details are provided in the Internet Appendix Section II. We made about 85,000 trades between December 2021 and June 2022 in six brokerage accounts at five retail brokers: Robinhood (RH), E*Trade (ET), Fidelity (FD), TD Ameritrade (TD), and two accounts at Interactive Brokers (IBKR, “Pro” and commission-free “Lite”, or “Free”). We traded 128 stocks each day by selecting one stock from each of 128 bins, which were created based on market capitalization, daily volatility, daily share turnover, and stock price. We targeted a trade size of $100 and traded full shares only (rounding the shares traded to make the trade size as close to $100 as possible). In robustness checks, we conduct auxiliary experiments that trade in round lots, larger amounts ($1000 or up to $5000), or targeted stocks (stocks popular with retail investors, megacap stocks with the majority of overall trading volume, and top movers based on overnight returns). We use the trade execution time and price reported by the broker to match our trades to the TAQ database, which provides the exchange code, the execution time on the exchange, and the prevailing NBBO at the time of the trade.9 Our main sample consists of more than 64,000 9 We use the WRDS Consolidated Trades (WCT) files to identify off-exchange trades (exchange code “D”) that execute at a subpenny amount. Since 2017, WRDS calculates the NBBO in the nanosecond prior to the trade. Only 125 of our trades execute outside the NBBO and we include them in our analysis. For the trades outside the NBBO that are identified as retail, the BJZZ subpenny digit has an accuracy rate of 77% and the quote midpoint method has 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

    "text": "trades with a total dollar value of $7.5 million; the auxiliary experiments add about 20,000 trades worth about $8 million. <Insert Table I about here> In Table I, we present summary statistics for our main sample. The mean (median) stock price is $55 ($18). Importantly, the average NBBO spread is 17 cents and the median is 5 cents. More than 80% of trades in our sample face a spread greater than one penny.10 The trade size averages $118 because we target $100 trades while trading round shares. Few trades are split (1.8%). Because we begin trading at TD and RH first, 37% of our trades are from these two brokers but there are more than 1,000 trades placed through each of the six brokerage accounts. III. Results A. Identification Rates In Table II, we summarize the ability of the BJZZ algorithm to identify retail trades. The fractions of total trades with price improvement (PI) exceeds 90%; 61% of trades receive subpenny price improvement, and 41% of trades execute at a subpenny other than $0.005 (i.e., 20% of trades execute at $0.005). BJZZ (2021) reports similar estimates for a NASDAQ TRF sample in 2010. BJZZ implement an exclusion ‘donut’ of [$0.004, $0.006] because “…trades at or near the half-penny are likely to be from institutions” (BJZZ, p.2251). When we add this filter to our trades, the BJZZ algorithm identifies 35% of our sample trades as retail. In the last column, we find that the quote midpoint method, which excludes trades within 40 and 60% of the NBBO, has a similar identification rate. < Insert Table II about here> Each stock is a random draw from one of the 128 bins generated to construct the stratified sample. Since we have roughly similar number of trades in each stock, equal weighted statistics an accuracy rate of 65%. Since the NBBO is likely estimated with error in these cases, it would be reasonable to use the BJZZ algorithm for trades outside the WRDS-calculated NBBO and when the NBBO spread is a penny. 10 The fact that about 20% of trades in our sample face a one penny spread but during our sample period about 40% of trades have a one penny spread can be traced to the timing of our trades, which is uniform across the day. If penny spreads are more common during periods of high volume (i.e., spreads are lower when there is more liquidity in the market) then uniform spacing of trades will generate a lower percentage of one penny spreads. Of course, ex ante we are not able to sample in proportion to contemporaneous trading volume. Internet Appendix Figure IA.3 shows that the proportion of penny spreads is similar for all stocks and our stocks if we analyze only trades at the same time of the day as our trades. 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

    "text": "provide results for the average stock.11 To obtain statistics for the average trade, we weight each bin by either the total dollar volume of trade in the bin (VW) or the total off-exchange volume for the bin (ExDW). In rows 2 and 3, we show that results for the average trade are quite similar to those for the average stock (row 1). Rows 4 and 5 show that identification rates are similar for buys and sells. In the last six rows, we observe differences in identification rates across brokers, ranging from 11% for trades placed at IB Pro to 42% for trades placed at E*Trade for the BJZZ algorithm, and 14% at IB Pro to 47% at E*Trade for the quote midpoint method. These differences arise because price execution varies across brokers (Schwarz et al. (2023)). B. Accuracy Rates In Table III, we present the conditional accuracy rates for the BJZZ and quote midpoint algorithms. The BJZZ algorithm accurately signs 72% of trades as a buy or sell. The quote midpoint method accurately signs 95% of trades. The equally weighted statistics represent statistics for the average stock. In rows 2 and 3, we observe similar accuracy rates for the average trade (weighting stocks alternatively by the bin’s total volume or the bin’s off-exchange volume). In rows 4 and 5, we find that buys and sells have very similar accuracy rates. < Insert Table III about here> In the last six rows, we find conditional accuracy rates also vary significantly across brokers for the BJZZ algorithm, from 64% at TD Ameritrade to 88% at IB Free. The quote midpoint rule reduces this variation substantially. Accuracy for TD Ameritrade, however, is notably lower than for others because our trades at this broker receive price improvement close to 50% (Schwarz et al. (2023)). C. Multivariate Analysis of Identification Rates Spreads affect identification rates because actual subpenny execution drops as spreads increase. To explore whether other factors affect identification rates, we estimate a linear probability regression that predicts identification. The dependent variable is one if the trade is correctly identified as retail using the BJZZ algorithm and zero otherwise. We present results in 11 The 128 bins in our main sample do not have exactly the same number of trades. When we create sample weights based on the number of trades in each bin, all statistics in the first row of Table II are within 0.24% of those presented.

    "text": "Table IV. Results for the BJZZ subpenny digit method are presented in columns (1) to (4). Analogous results for the quote midpoint method are presented in columns (5) to (8). <Insert Table IV about here> In column (1), we estimate a regression with indicator variables for different spread buckets (using the one penny spread as the omitted category). For the BJZZ algorithm, we find that identification rate probabilities drop by 9.4 percentage points (ppt) when spreads are between 5 and 10 cents and by 12.5 ppt when spreads exceed 10 cents. The odd spread indicator takes a value of one when the spread is in odd cents. It is statistically significant but has a relatively modest negative effect on identification rates. The negative effect reflects the fact that a modestly disproportionate share of trades occurs near the midpoint quote (Figure 3) and, for stocks with odd spreads, those trades are dropped by the BJZZ algorithm because they have a subpenny increment near $0.005. The effect is smaller in column 5 because the midpoint quote method treats stocks with odd and even spreads symmetrically. In column (2), we consider several stock characteristics: the log of stock price, return quintiles, an extreme return indicator (top 0.5% of same-day return), a negative return indicator, quintiles of abnormal volume and volatility, in addition to market condition variables (up market indicator and standardized VIX level). The price levels effect is important because spreads are correlated with price levels. There is weak evidence of identification being lower in up markets, but the effect is economically small. The effect of the VIX variable is statistically significant but economically small. A one standard deviation higher VIX is associated with 1.1% lower identification rate, which suggests subpenny price improvement is somewhat less common in volatile markets. We find similar results for the quote midpoint method in column (6). In columns (3) and (7), we combine the spread variables and controls. The spread indicator and stock price variables have the largest impact on identification. High priced stocks with large spreads have trades that are less likely to be identified by both algorithms. In column (4) and (8), we find similar results when we add broker and firm fixed effects. In summary, the evidence indicates that spreads are the main drivers of identification rates for both algorithms. Predictably, this leads to large variations in identification rates across stocks ranging from 20% to 50% (see Internet Appendix Figure IA.4). D.

    "text": "third of those used in the identification regressions. The dependent variable is an indicator variable that takes a value of one if a trade identified as retail is accurately signed as a buy or sell. <Insert Table V about here> Table V summarizes the results. In column (1), we observe that spreads are statistically and economically important determinants of BJZZ accuracy rates. Relative to one penny spreads, BJZZ accuracy rates drop 15.4 ppt for spreads of 1 to 5 cents and by a very large 40.5 ppt for spreads of 10 cents or more. In column (2), we find that many stock characteristics are related to BJZZ accuracy rates. For example, higher stock prices are associated with lower accuracy rates. More positive returns and extreme positive returns are associated with lower accuracy rates. The interaction with the negative return dummy suggests the effect of extreme returns is most pronounced for the extreme positive returns. We also observe higher accuracy rates when a stock has abnormally high volume. Importantly, in column (3) we observe that all the stock characteristics of column (2) decline in magnitude and mostly lose statistical significance when we introduce the key spread variables. This suggests that spreads are the mechanism that generates the correlations between accuracy rates and stock characteristics. Spreads remain the primary determinants of accuracy rates when we add broker and stock fixed effects in column (4). Overall, we find that the BJZZ algorithm’s ability to accurately sign trades declines dramatically for trades that face a spread greater than one penny. In sharp contrast, the quote midpoint method accuracy rates are more consistent across spread levels. In column (5), we observe that accuracy rates increase modestly as spreads increase, which suggests that price improvement greater than 50% is less likely as spreads increase. Note, however, that accuracy rates are between 94 and 99% for all spread levels (see Figure 2). In column (6), the only statistically significant stock characteristic is the price level, but this effect is considerably reduced when we introduce the spread variables in column (7) and loses statistical significance when we introduce broker and stock fixed effects in column (8). Predictably, as shown in Internet Appendix Figure IA.5, the BJZZ measure generates large variation in accuracy across stocks (ranging from about 50% to 100%). In contrast, the quote midpoint method materially shrinks the variation across stocks (ranging from about 85% to 100%). 10 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

    "text": "E. Robustness Checks We supplement our main analysis with several robustness checks to ensure that the results regarding identification rates and accuracy rates are reasonable. To do so, we run auxiliary experiments with different trade types or targeting specific stocks. Table VI uses the column (1) regression model of identification and accuracy rates from Tables IV and V (respectively) but adds a key indicator variable for the trade or stock of interest. <Insert Table VI about here> To address the concern that our small trades yield identification and accuracy rates that are different than those for larger trades, we execute 2,292 trades of about $1,000 in 130 randomly selected stocks that are in our main sample. The experiment compares the identification and accuracy rates of small and large trades in the same stock on the same day. To limit the cost of this experiment, we do not trade in all 128 stocks each day. As was done for our main sample, we choose a share size that yields a trade value closest to $1,000. In Table VI, Panel A, we find that both algorithms have similar identification rates for these larger trades (columns (1) and (3)). BJZZ accuracy rates are lower for these trades, but the economic magnitude is small (4.9 ppt lower on a baseline accuracy rate of 72%). The quote midpoint method yields a reduction in accuracy rates, but the reduction is economically small and statistically insignificant.12 Next, Bartlett (2021) shows that there is a sharp increase in de minimis price improvement for trades of 100 shares relative to odd lot trades for less than 100 shares. He attributes the difference to regulations that require market centers to post the percentage of trades that receive price improvement for trades of 100 shares or more. To see if this observation materially affects our inferences, we run an experiment by executing 338 trades of 100 shares alongside the $100 trades in the main sample. In Table VI, Panel B, we observe higher identification rates for both algorithms, which is consistent with the increased prevalence of de minimis subpenny price improvement for 100-share trades. Accuracy rates are unaffected. Next, several studies document that retail investors tend to be net buyers of stocks on days with extreme returns (Barber et al. (2022); Barber and Odean (2008)). To assess the performance of the algorithm on those days, we run an experiment where we place 5,509 trades 12 Somewhat surprisingly, this is because price improvement greater than 50% is somewhat more likely for these larger trades. For buys, 15.2% of both large and small trades experience price improvement over 50%. For sells, 15.8% of large trades and 11.0% of small trades experience price improvement over 50%. The quote midpoint method excludes a larger region of trades around the quote midpoint and thus reduces the inaccuracy that occurs in signing trades with greater than 50% price improvement. 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

    "text": "in stocks that appear on the Robinhood Top Mover list each day before the market opens (i.e., the stocks have larger overnight moves) and have share prices greater than $1. By luck, only 6.6% of these overnight return moves are negative. We compare the performance of the algorithm in these stocks relative to our main sample on the “Top Mover Day” (the trading day immediately following the 9 am observation of the large overnight move). We also analyze the performance “Post Top Mover Day” (the four days immediately following the “Top Mover Day”). This regression (and those in the remaining panels) contain all observations from our main sample because the experiment investigates stock (rather than trade) characteristics. In Panel C, we find that identification rates are not materially affected on these top mover days but increase modestly in the days following (columns (1) and (3)). Accuracy rates are somewhat lower on the top mover days. However, the economic magnitude of the effect is small (e.g., -3.5 ppt on a baseline accuracy rate of 95% for the quote midpoint algorithm). The small reduction in accuracy can be traced to the higher frequency of 50% or greater price improvement for sell trades, perhaps because big price moves attract buying activity, so sellers receive good price execution. We next analyze “retail darlings.” We identify the stocks in our main sample that are among the 30 most popular holdings on Robinhood as of May 2022, adding Apple and Tesla, which are also in the Robinhood top 30. In Panel D, we analyze the identification and accuracy rates for these retail darlings. There is some evidence of higher identification rates, but the effect is economically small. Among retail darlings, the quote midpoint method has somewhat lower accuracy rates but still dominates the BJZZ method given the high baseline accuracy rate of 95% for the quote midpoint method. Finally, we perform a similar analysis for megacap stocks since most trading volume is concentrated in large cap stocks. Specifically, we execute targeted trades in six megacap stocks (i.e., AAPL, BAC, GOOG, NVDA, V, XOM) with market caps greater than $700 billion at the time of sample selection. By comparison, the largest stock in our main sample is Goldman Sachs with a market cap of $129 billion. In Panel E, we find that identification rates and accuracy rates are similar for these megacap stocks. VI. Discussion A. False Positives In the prior analysis we show that false negative identification is common; indeed, 65% of our trades are not identified as retail.

    "text": "false positives (institutional trades that execute off exchanges at subpennies). Our discussions with SEC staff, FINRA staff, and traders at financial institutions suggest that institutional orders are not typically sold to wholesalers. Institutions do trade off exchanges through crossing networks and alternative trading systems (ATS). However, most of those we spoke with thought that institutional trades are more likely to execute in round pennies. Quote midpoints are an exception: Boehmer et al. (2021, p.2255) note that “…Reg NMS has been interpreted to allow executions at the midpoint between the best bid and best offer. As a result, institutions are heavy users of crossing networks and midpoint peg orders that generate transactions at this midpoint price.” BJZZ (p..2251) argue “…trades at or near a half-penny are likely to be from institutions and are not assigned to the retail category.” If true, including trades near the quote midpoint would increase the frequency of false positives. Thus, we also exclude trades that execute within 40 and 60% of NBBO when measuring retail trade. This exclusion is justified for measuring retail order imbalance because signing accuracy drops near the quote midpoint. However, it remains an open question whether excluding trades near the quote midpoint degrades or improves measures of the intensity of retail trading. To shed some light on these issues, we compare the distribution of our trades with all off- exchange trades (marked with code “D” on TAQ). We find that our trades are less likely to occur at a round penny than other off-exchange trades (39.30% of our trades occur at a round penny versus 50.58% of all off-exchange trades) perhaps because off-exchange institutional trades are more likely to execute at a round penny. Once we exclude trades at round pennies, the distribution of our trades and all off-exchange trades are similar (see Internet Appendix Figure IA.6). Our trades are less likely to execute at $0.005, which is often the quote midpoint and might contain an outsized fraction of institutional trades as discussed above. We also observe somewhat fewer observations in our trades in the low and high subpenny digits, perhaps because subpenny price improvement is more common for round lots, as we document in robustness checks, given that our trades are odd lots. We do not view this evidence as definitive. In summary, an open question is whether using the subpenny digit in off-exchange trades to identify retail trades leads to a large rate of false positive errors. B.

    "text": "errors when measuring retail order imbalance. When a researcher excludes trades from the calculation of order imbalance, one implicitly assumes that order imbalance for the included trades equals order imbalance for the excluded trades. In Internet Appendix Figure IA.8, we show this is a reasonable assumption across a wide range of order imbalance using data from our trading experiment. However, at extreme levels of order imbalance excluding trades near the quote midpoint inflates measures of order imbalance. For example, on days with heavy buying, sell orders are more likely to execute near the quote midpoint, and vice versa. However, in the Internet Appendix Section IV and Figure IA.8, we show that this inflation bias is relatively small.13 In the same section, we offer an alternative order imbalance measure that assumes zero order imbalance for the excluded trades and thus “shrinks” order imbalance estimates toward zero. Though the alternative measure has greater absolute error, the two measures are nearly perfectly correlated. Thus, they will rank stocks in similar ways and generate similar test statistics in regression analyses. However, scholars interested in the magnitude of order imbalance might use both measures to provide reasonable bounds on order imbalance. VII. Conclusions Boehmer et al. (2021) create an algorithm that identifies retail trades that execute at subpenny amounts on off-exchange venues. The method has quickly become widely used in the academic literature. We examine the effectiveness of the BJZZ subpenny digit algorithm and introduce a quote midpoint method to identify and sign retail trades using a self-generated set of over 85,000 retail trades. Regarding identification, both algorithms use subpenny price execution to identify trades. The BJZZ algorithm excludes trades that execute at subpennies between $0.004 and $0.006; the quote midpoint method excludes trades that execute between 40 and 60% of the quote midpoint, relative to NBBO. Both methods correctly identify about a third of our trades as retail trades. Because subpenny price improvement is less likely as spreads increase, identification rates vary systematically across stocks. The variation mechanically generated by spreads must be addressed to avoid false discoveries regarding the intensity of retail trading. In terms of accuracy of buy or sell signing, the BJZZ subpenny digit method incorrectly signs 28% of identified trades (i.e., has an accuracy rate of 72%). As with identification rates, accuracy rates decrease as spreads increase, vary systematically across stocks, and yield 13 For example, when estimated retail order imbalance is -0.73 (86.5% sells), the bias is -0.05 (i.e., true order imbalance is -0.66 or 83% sells). 14 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

    "text": "As a salient example of how the improvement in accuracy rates can affect inference, we analyze the infamous GameStop episode of January 2021 when it was widely reported that millions of individual investors were buying GameStop stock at unprecedented levels.1 In Figure IA.1, Panel A, we show that volume for GameStop increased dramatically on January 22, 2021, and that the GameStop stock price surged from less than $20 in early January to an intraday high of $483 on January 28, 2021. In Panel B, we plot the median bid-ask spread (with whiskers corresponding to the interquartile range) for the same period. The big surge in price was accompanied by a big increase in the bid-ask spread, from a median of 2 to 4 cents in early January to over $1 following the January 22 price surge. As we show in the main paper, increases spreads dramatically reduce the accuracy of the BJZZ signing algorithm. In Figure IA.1, Panel C, we compare the order imbalance calculated using the BJZZ algorithm to that calculated using our improved method, which relies on the quote midpoint to sign trades but excludes trades that execute between 40 and 60 percent of the NBBO. As Panel C shows, the order imbalance based on our improved algorithm increases by a large amount from the normal period (before January 22) to the frenzy period (on and after January 22). Using the improved algorithm, the order imbalance mean jumps from 15.3% in the normal period to 29.4% in the frenzy period, a statistically significant increase of 14.1 percentage points (𝑡 = 4.22). (The mean order imbalances for each period are shown with horizontal lines.) During the nine-day frenzy period, GameStop is in the top 20% of order-imbalance for all stocks on seven of nine days when order imbalance is estimated with the improved algorithm. In sharp contrast, using the BJZZ algorithm order imbalance is 10.3% in the normal period and 11.1% in the frenzy period, an economically small and statistically insignificant difference of 0.8 percentage points (𝑡 = 0.32). Furthermore, during the nine-day frenzy period, GameStop ranked in the top 20% of order imbalance for all stocks on only two of nine days when order imbalance is estimated using the BJZZ algorithm. Thus, the BJZZ method would erroneously lead researchers to conclude that the net retail buying did not increase significantly during the frenzy period. 1 See for example https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/business/gamestop-wall-street-bets.html. 2 Internet Appendix Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

    "text": "In this section, we provide the details for our trading experiment. A. The Stratified Sample We create a stratified sample of the stocks using 128 bins. To be included, each stock must have a price greater than a dollar and a share code of either 10 or 11.2 The bins are created as follows. First, stocks are split into four equal groups by market capitalization. Second, each of these groups is split into four equal groups by liquidity (the median of the percentage of shares outstanding traded daily measured over the prior quarter). Third, each of these sixteen buckets is cut into four equal buckets sorted by volatility (the median squared daily return over the last quarter). Finally, the 64 buckets are split into equal halves by levels of the stock price. On average, the 128 bins contain 32 stocks.3 We randomly choose one stock from each bin. A complete list of the stocks in our experiment is listed in Table IA.I. Our research design allows us to make inference about the average stock in our population. Since trades are approximately equally distributed across strata, the statistics based on our sample of trades will approximate statistics for the average stock in the population.4 Since most analyses of retail order imbalance are based on the average stock (e.g., sorting stocks on retail activity or order imbalance), the analysis of results for the average stock is most relevant. However, we also estimate statistics for the average trade by creating sample weights for each stratum. Sample weights are based on the total dollar volume (or off-exchange dollar volume) in a stratum as of June 2021; trades within each stratum are weighted equally. Weighting by total dollar volume assumes retail trading is proportional to total dollar volume (off-exchange dollar volume). 2 Per NMS rules, stocks less than one dollar can have subpenny bid-ask spreads and therefore are excluded. This is consistent with BJZZ. 3 If the share price of a stock drops below one dollar at the end of the week, that stock is replaced with another one from the same bucket using the latest quarterly version of the CRSP database. 4 The number of trades is not equal across stocks because some stocks are replaced if they are delisted or fall below $1. This creates multiple stocks for a single stratum. Trades are not precisely equal across strata because of occasional glitches in the API and the addition of large trades for 26 stocks. Results that weight each stratum by the reciprocal of the number of trades are very similar to the main results, so we present unweighted results for simplicity. 3 Internet Appendix Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

    "text": "B. Stock Trading For each brokerage, we use the Application Programming Interface (API) to automatically trade stocks each day. Fidelity and IBKR Lite do not allow for API access. Thus, we hand traded those brokers by synchronizing trading times with the API.5 Our trading is executed with five brokers, Robinhood (RH), E*Trade (ET), Fidelity (FD), TD Ameritrade (TD), and Interactive Brokers (IBKR).6 ET, RH, and TD are commission-free but all three accept payment for order flow (PFOF). Fidelity is commission-free and does not accept PFOF. We trade in two accounts at IBKR: a “Pro” account with tiered commissions (and no PFOF) and a “Lite” commission-free account (with PFOF). Each trading day begins at 9:40AM EST, after the opening auction. The program trades at regular intervals throughout the day, spacing trades out over the course of the day with the last trades ending before 3:50 PM EST. The program buys the same quantity of shares at each broker at the same time and program sells the same number of shares 30 minutes later. 7 Each day, we trade all selected stocks at each broker except for Interactive Brokers Pro, which has higher commissions and for which we trade only half the stocks per day. The target size for the order is $100. We trade full shares only, rounding the number to make the trade size closest to $100, with a minimum size of one share for higher priced stocks. In robustness checks discussed in detail later, we complement the main sample with a limited sample of $1000 trades and find similar results to those in our main sample. In additional robustness checks, we conduct auxiliary experiments that target stocks popular with retail investors, megacap stocks (which have the majority of overall trading volume), and top movers based on overnight returns. The results based on our main sample are overall quite similar to those in these targeted subpopulations. We began trading TD and RH in parallel on December 21, 2021. In 2022, we started trading IBKR (Pro), ET, FD, and IBKR (Lite, or Free) on January 25, March 16, April 22, and April 22, respectively. Our sample period ends on June 9, 2022, for a total of 113 trading days. 5 Given Schwab is owned by TD and does not have an API, we skipped Schwab. 6 As of June 2020, these are the first, second, third, and fifth brokers in terms of Daily Average Revenue Trades. (See https://inside.com/campaigns/inside-business-2020-08-11-24066/sections/202954) 7 Because the program runs in a single thread, sequentially across brokers for the same group of stocks, it cannot place the trades at the same millisecond. To control for this issue, the program randomizes the order of the API calls to ensure that no broker has a time advantage with both buys and sells. 4 Internet Appendix Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

    "text": "For a trade to be included in our main sample, we require both the buy and sell side of the trade and a valid NBBO in TAQ at the time of the trade execution. After these filters, our main sample consists of more than 64,000 trades across brokers and a total dollar value of trading more than $7.5 million.8 Because we begin trading at TD and RH first, 37% of our trades are from these two brokers. However, we have more than 1,000 trades placed through each of the six brokerage accounts. III. The Effect of Identification and Accuracy Rates on Estimated Order Imbalance In this section, we analyze the effect of identification and accuracy rates on estimated order imbalance. Identification and accuracy rates create bias if the identification rates for buys and sells differ. Accuracy rates generate an attenuation bias. A. General Framework In contrast to the simplified relation described in the main text, we allow for buys and sells to be identified with different probabilities and for buys and sells to be signed with different levels of accuracy. Instead of observing the true number of buys and sells, scholars observe an estimate of retail buys (sells) that is a function of two parameters: (1) the probability that a buy (or sell) is identified as a retail trade denoted 𝑝𝑏 (or 𝑝𝑠) (the identification rate) and (2) the probability that a trades identified as retail is accurately signed as a buy (or sell) denoted 𝛾𝑏 (𝛾𝑠) (the accuracy rate). Thus, the expected value of estimated retail buys and retail sells conditional on the true number of retail buys and retail sells can be specified as: 𝐸(𝐵𝐸|𝐵𝑇,𝑆𝑇) = 𝑝𝑏𝛾𝑏𝐵𝑇 +𝑝𝑠(1−𝛾𝑠)𝑆𝑇, and (IA.1) 𝐸(𝑆𝐸|𝐵𝑇,𝑆𝑇) = 𝑝𝑠𝛾𝑠𝑆𝑇 +𝑝𝑏(1−𝛾𝑏)𝐵𝑇. (IA.2) The expected values in these two equations allow for different identification rates for buys and sells (𝑝𝑏 and 𝑝𝑠) and different accuracy rates for buys and sells (𝛾𝑏 and 𝛾𝑠). The expected value of estimated order imbalance (Ω𝐸) conditional on the true number of retail buys and sells is: 𝐵𝐸 −𝑆𝐸 𝐸(Ω𝐸|𝐵𝑇,𝑆𝑇) = 𝐸( |𝐵𝑇,𝑆𝑇) (IA.3) 𝐵𝐸 +𝑆𝐸 8 This sample is for the 128 stocks traded daily. To conduct additional experiments (e.g., in our robustness checks), we placed a total of 85,417 trades equivalent to $15.4 million. 5 Internet Appendix Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

Estimated Order Imbalance when Buy and Sell Identification Rates are Equal In the special case of equal identification rates for buys and sells, observed order imbalance can be systematically biased up or down if the accuracy rates of buys are different from the accuracy rates for sells. We observe differences in the accuracy rates of buys and sells ranging from -20% to +20%. However, the mean difference of -1.6% is close to zero economically and statistically insigificant (with a standard error of 1.1%), and we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the differences in accuracy rates are equal across stocks. 6 Internet Appendix Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

    "text": "We summarize how differences in accuracy rates for buys versus sells affect order imbalance estimates in Figure IA.7, Panel A, which depicts the relation between estimated order imbalance (y axis) and true order imbalance (x axis) assuming equal identification rates for buys and sells. The black 45° line represents an unbiased estimate of order imbalance (100% accuracy rates). The solid red line represents an accuracy rate of 70% for buys and sells (close to the mean across all stocks). As average accuracy drops, the slope of the red line drops and turns negative when average accuracy rates drop below 50%. The dashed red line represents the same average accuracy rate (70%) but assumes the sell accuracy rate exceeds the buy accuracy rate (80% versus 60%), which results in a downward shift in the order imbalance estimates everywhere. As the buy-sell difference in accuracy rates becomes more negative, the downward shift increases. There is a similar upward shift if sell accuracy rates exceed buy accuracy rates. C. Estimated Order Imbalance when Buy and Sell Identification Rates Vary As is the case for accuracy rates, we do not observe systematic differences in identification rates across stocks. We observe differences in buy versus sell identification rates at the stock level that range from -15% to 15%, but we fail to reject the null hypothesis that differences in buy/sell identification rates are equal across stocks. When we relax the assumption that identification rates are equal for buys and sells, the relation between estimated order imbalance and true order imbalance becomes nonlinear as the ratio of identification rates appears in both the numerator and denominator of estimated order imbalance (see equation IA.4). Figure IA.7, Panel B, summarizes the effect of this nonlinearity. The solid black and red lines in the panel repeat the relations with equal identification rates for buys and sells and equal accuracy rates (100% and 70%, respectively). The blue line depicts what happens when we change the identification ratio from 1 (red line) to 0.50 (blue line) given an average accuracy rate of 70% (both red and blue lines). At a true order imbalance of zero, an identification ratio of 0.50 and an average accuracy rate of 70% yields a negative order imbalance measure (-0.13) because sells are more likely to be identified than buys. When there are only buyers (sellers) in the market and true order imbalance is 1 (-1), the identification ratio does not affect the order imbalance estimate. Note that the identification ratio of 0.50 in this example is extreme in that only 2 stocks in our sample have a ratio less than 0.50. For an identification ratio of 2 (buys are twice as likely to be identified as sells), we would observe a symmetric pattern; the blue line would be convex 7 Internet Appendix Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",

    "text": "and above the red line. However, we observe no stocks with identification ratios of 2 or more. In summary, for identification ratios less than 1 (greater than 1) the estimated order imbalance is negatively (positively) biased on average; the effects are largest near true order imbalance of zero but the overall effects on estimated order imbalance are not as dramatic as differences in accuracy measures depicted in the red dashed line of Panel A. Because the effect of identification ratios is relatively modest, the average identification ratio is indistinguishable from zero, and there is no reliable variation in identification ratios across stocks, we focus on the overall accuracy and differences in accuracy in the main section of the paper. IV. Bias from Excluding Trades in the Calculation of Order Imbalance In this section, we consider the bias that may arise from omitting trades from the calculation of order imbalance. We focus on the example that omits trades close to the quote midpoint (as described in the main paper) but the analysis of omitted trades can be more generally applied to any exclusion of trades from the calculation of order imbalance. Define yb and ys (b and s) as buys and sells close to (far from) the quote midpoint. True order imbalance (𝑂𝐼𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒) is 𝑂𝐼𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 = (𝑏+𝑦𝑏)−(𝑠+𝑦𝑠) . (IA.6) (𝑏+𝑦𝑏)+(𝑠+𝑦𝑠) Define x (or 1-x) as the fraction of orders close to (or far from) the midpoint, 𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟 as the order imbalance for trades far from the midpoint, and 𝑂𝐼𝑐𝑙 as the order imbalance close to the midpoint: 𝑦𝑏+𝑦𝑠 𝑥 = , (IA.7) (𝑏+𝑦𝑏)+(𝑠+𝑦𝑠) 𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟 = 𝑏−𝑠 , and (IA.8) 𝑏+𝑠 𝑂𝐼𝑐𝑙 = 𝑦𝑏−𝑦𝑠 . (IA.9) 𝑦𝑏+𝑦𝑠 True order imbalance is a weighted average of the fraction of trades that are close to and far from the quote midpoint 𝑂𝐼𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 = (1−𝑥)𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟 +𝑥𝑂𝐼𝑐𝑙. (IA.10) The bias from using only trades that are far from the midpoint to estimate true order imbalance is 𝐵𝑖𝑎𝑠 = 𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟 −𝑂𝐼𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 = 𝑥(𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟 −𝑂𝐼𝑐𝑙).

If order imbalance is equal for trades close to and far from the quote midpoint (𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟 = 𝑂𝐼𝑐𝑙), there is no bias. We wish to test the reasonableness of the hypothesis that 𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟 = 𝑂𝐼𝑐𝑙 across a range of estimates for 𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟. Note that this hypothesis test is equivalent to a test of the hypothesis that buys and sells are equally likely to execute near the quote midpoint across a range of estimates for 𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟. Define a as a measure relative intensity of observing sells and buys close to the quote midpoint: 𝑎 = 𝑦𝑠⁄𝑠.

We estimate 𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟 using TAQ data, the quote midpoint method and excluding trades near that execute between 40 and 60% of the NBBO (as described in the main paper). We then sort our trades into 20 roughly equal-sized bins based on the estimated order imbalance on the day of trade. In Figure IA.8, Panel A, we plot the percent of all buys (sells) that execute close to the quote midpoint in red (green) for each of the 20 order imbalance bins (whiskers represent 95% confidence intervals). For most bins, the probabilities that sells and buys execute near the quote midpoint are roughly equal. However, in the extreme order imbalance bins differences emerge. For example, in the bin with the most negative estimated order imbalance (-.73) about 50% of our buys execute near the quote midpoint and only 36% of sells do so. There is an analogous pattern in the bin with the most positive estimated order imbalance. These patterns make sense as sellers receive better trade execution on days when most are buying and vice versa.

    "text": "of the 20 bins. 𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟 is calculated using TAQ data. 𝑂𝐼𝑐𝑙 is calculated using equation IA.13, which requires estimates of 𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟 and the bias parameter (a). (Note the bias parameter is a function of the probabilities plotted in Panel A.) The key takeaway is the two order imbalance measures have the same sign and are generally close to each other. However, the difference in execution that we see in Panel A result in order imbalances for trades close to the quote midpoint that are less in absolute value than those far from the quote midpoint. In Panel C, we plot the bias measure of equation IA.11 for our main measure of order imbalance using circle markers. Across a wide range of order imbalance values, the bias is small. In the extremes, order imbalance is exaggerated by about 10%. For example, in the bin with order imbalance of -0.73 (86.5% sells), the bias is -0.05 (i.e., true order imbalance is -0.66 or 83% sells). To bound the inflated magnitudes that appear in the extremes of order imbalance, an alternative measure might assume that order imbalance close to the quote midpoint is zero and thus shrink the measure of 𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟 toward zero based on the prevalence of trades close to the quote midpoint: 𝑂𝐼𝑎𝑙𝑡 = 𝑏−𝑠 = (1−𝑥)𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟. (IA.15) (𝑏+𝑦𝑏)+(𝑠+𝑦𝑠) The bias in the alternative measure of order imbalance is: 𝐵𝑖𝑎𝑠 = 𝑂𝐼𝑎𝑙𝑡 −𝑂𝐼𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 = −𝑥𝑂𝐼𝑐𝑙. (IA.16) 2 In Panel B, we see the assumption that 𝑂𝐼𝑐𝑙 = 𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟 is more accurate than 𝑂𝐼𝑐𝑙=0, but the alternative measure is still useful in bounding the magnitude of order imbalance. In Panel C, we plot the bias of the alternative order imbalance measure with square markers. We conclude that using order imbalance estimated using trades far from the quote midpoint (𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟) provides the least biased measure of true order imbalance but may be inflated in extreme order imbalance situations. We consider an alternative measure that shrinks the estimate of order imbalance toward zero based on the prevalence of trades close to the quote midpoint, (1−𝑥)𝑂𝐼𝑓𝑎𝑟. While the bias of our proposed measure is smaller than the alternative, the two measures provide upper and lower bounds for true order imbalance, which is useful when scholars are interested in the magnitude of order imbalance. Note also that the two measures are nearly perfectly correlated. Thus, they will generate similar rankings of stocks and similar test statistics (though different coefficient estimates) when used in regression analyses. 10 Internet Appendix Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4202874",
