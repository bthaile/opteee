DOI: 10.1002/fut.20361 A Generalization of the Barone-Adesi and Whaley Approach 479 INTRODUCTION The goal of this research is to provide an efficient analytic approximation for pricing American options in a general model that allows for stochastic volatility, return jumps, and volatility jumps. The fact that asset returns exhibit both sto- chastic volatility and jumps has been widely documented. Although some closed-form solutions for European options based on these diffusion processes have been derived in recent years, no known analytic solution for American options exists. Consequently, simulative and numerical approaches are used to calculate American option values. Barone-Adesi and Whaley (1987) originally applied the quadratic approxi- mation method to price American options using the decomposition technique. Bates (1991) first extended this method by introducing jumps into the process of the underlying asset return. Ju and Zhong (1999) improved the accuracy of the original method for options with intermediate maturities by adding a cor- rection term onto the approximation. Chang, Kang, Kim, and Kim (2007) introduced an additional parameter into the original method and succeeded in extending its application from basic options to barrier options and lookback options. Nevertheless, these methods do not continuously evolve in conjunc- tion with the rapid growth of new option pricing models in the stochastic volatility framework. Additional empirical studies provide evidence that an option model allowing for stochastic volatility and double jumps dramatically reduces option-pricing errors (see Bakshi, Cao, & Chen, 1997; Broadie, Chernov, & Johannes, 2007; and others). These studies illustrate the impor- tance of extending the quadratic approximation method for American options based on these processes. Stochastic volatility models with double jumps proposed by Duffie, Pan, and Singleton (2000) were used as examples to highlight the generalization of the authors’quadratic approximation scheme, followed by a comparison with the least-squares simulation approach proposed by Longstaff and Schwartz (2001). The results of the authors’comparison show that the quadratic approximation scheme is useful and efficient in pricing American options based on these dif- fusion processes. To illustrate its generality, this approximation scheme is also applied to other existing models. The remainder of this article is organized as follows: the second section briefly describes the stochastic volatility model with correlated double jumps and the authors’quadratic approximation scheme. The third section gives ana- lytic approximation formulae for other jump models. The fourth section com- pares quadratic approximations with the least-squares simulation approach. Conclusions are presented in the fifth section. Journal of Futures Markets DOI: 10.1002/fut",

(2000) was reproduced to generate a self-contained treatment. Under the risk-neutral measure, the underlying asset price, S(t), is posited to follow a geometric jump diffusion with the instantaneous conditional variance, Y(t), following a mean-reverting square root jump process: dS(t) (cid:1) (r (cid:2) d)dt (cid:3) 2Y(t)dW (t) (cid:3) (ex(t) (cid:2) 1)dq (t) (cid:2) EQ[(ex(t) (cid:2) 1)dq (t)] (1) S(t) S S S dY(t) (cid:1) (Y (cid:2) k Y(t))dt (cid:3) s 2Y(t)dW (t) (cid:3) y(t)dq (t), t (cid:5) 0 (2) Y Y Y Y where ris the risk-free interest rate and dis the dividend yield. x(t) represents a percentage jump in the stock price and follows a normal distribution, N(m (cid:3) m y, s2 ), where y(t) is a level jump in the volatility and follows an expo- 0 x,y x,y nential distribution, Exponential(u) . q (t) and q (t) are two correlated Poisson y S Y counters with intensity l .rdenotes the instantaneous correlation coefficient x,y between the stock price return process and its conditional variance process.

Given the linearity of Equation (4), the early-exercise premium must satisfy Equation (3) because American option values, as well as European option values, satisfy the aforementioned partial differential equation in the nonstopping region under the risk-neutral measure. Given an analytic European option solution1 (see Appendix A), the only unsolved problem in deriving the pricing formula of an American option is a good approximation for the early-exercise premium. Because options are homo- geneous in Sand K, the premium is also homogeneous in Sand K: (cid:6)(S, Y, T; K) (cid:1) K(cid:6)(S/K, Y, T; 1).

    "text": "A Generalization of the Barone-Adesi and Whaley Approach 487 NUMERICAL RESULTS AND COMPARISONS Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) proposed a simple least-squares method (LSM) to value American options by simulation. Table II gives a comparison of the LSM and the quadratic approximation proposed in this research for the sto- chastic volatility model with correlated double jumps. The parameters reported in Bakshi and Cao (2003) are used for this computation. The simulation is based on 20,000 paths for the stock-price process and the option is exercisable 20 times before maturity. Puts (P) and Calls (C) are abbreviated as accordingly. The LSM proposed by Longstaff and Schwartz (2001), the quadratic approxi- mation, and their difference, are represented by Simulated American, Approx, and Diff, respectively. The standard errors of the simulation estimates (s.e.) are given in parentheses. As shown, the differences between the LSM and the quadratic approximation (Approx) are typically small. Table III gives a comparison of the LSM and the quadratic approximation for the stochastic volatility model with independent double jumps using param- eters presented in Bakshi and Cao (2003). The differences between the LSM and the quadratic approximation presented in this research are also typically small. By turning off the specification of volatility jumps (ly (cid:1) 0), the approxi- mation formula reduces to the solution of the stochastic volatility model with return jumps empirically examined in Bakshi et al. (1997) and Bates (1996). As shown in Table IV, the differences between the LSM and the quadratic approx- imation are small.

    "text": "490 Guo, Hung, and So the authors’ approximation for the stochastic volatility model with volatility jumps (lx (cid:1) 0) are small. These computations are performed with the parame- ters referenced from Bakshi and Cao (2003). Figures 1 and 2 illustrate that the choice of a affects the pricing errors of the quadratic approximation for the stochastic volatility model with independent double jumps. Although the optimal choice of a, between 50 and 60, minimizes pricing errors for calls, a corresponding choice for puts in this case cannot be determined. Therefore, the approach of Barone-Adesi and Whaley (1987) is followed and a value of a (cid:1) 1 is selected for simplicity in these cases because the pricing errors are small and often well within the market bid–ask spread. CONCLUSIONS In this article, the application of a quadratic approximation method is described to obtain efficient analytic formulae for American options on processes permitting stochastic volatility and double jumps to illustrate its gen- erality. To the best of one’s knowledge, the literature suggests no approximation formulae for American option values based on these processes. This quadratic approximation scheme is a generalization of the Barone-Adesi and Whaley approach and nests several option models. The constant volatility model is the first special case. The solution, with parameters specified as s (cid:1)0, k Y(cid:1) Y, ly(cid:1)0, and lx(cid:1)0, reduces to that of Y Y Barone and Whaley in 1987. Bates’constant volatility model with return jumps presented in 1991 is the second special case (s (cid:1) 0, k Y (cid:1) Y, ly (cid:1) 0, and lx Y Y (cid:8)0). The third special case is Heston’s (1993) stochastic volatility model with- out jumps (lx(cid:1)0 and ly(cid:1)0) proposed in 1993. The stochastic volatility model, with return jumps, empirically examined in Bakshi et al. (1997) and Bates (1996) (ly(cid:1)0), is the fourth special case. The fifth special case is the stochastic volatil- ity model with volatility jumps (lx (cid:1) 0) proposed by Duffie et al.(2000). Moreover, the stochastic volatility model with correlated double jumps is also included in this scheme. Comparisons with the least-squares approach show that the quadratic approximation scheme is very useful and efficient in pricing American options with stochastic volatility and double jumps. It is anticipated that the scheme can be further applied to American exotic options in the future. Journal of Futures Markets DOI: 10.1002/fut",
