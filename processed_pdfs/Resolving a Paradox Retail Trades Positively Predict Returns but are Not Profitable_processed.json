Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492 Resolving a Paradox: Retail Trades Positively Predict Returns but are Not Profitable Abstract Retail order imbalance positively correlates with returns in the days following trades. However, in aggregate, retail investor trades lose money over these same periods. Why? 1) While order imbalance tests value or equally weight stocks, retail purchases are concentrated in stocks earning large negative abnormal returns. 2) Order imbalance tests ignore losses on the day of trade. Our results reconcile the literatures on the performance of retail investors, the predictive content of retail order imbalance, and attention-induced trading and returns. We also find evidence that trades by retail investors with less knowledge, experience, and wealth are more likely to underperform. Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492 At short horizons, retail investors lose money through trading. At short horizons, the order imbalance of retail investors positively predicts future returns. Both of these seemingly contradictory statements about retail investors are well-established. Several studies of retail investors (using a variety of datasets, methods, and horizons) show that in aggregate retail investors earn poor returns at both short horizons, e.g. less than a month, and longer horizons, e.g. more than a month (Barber and Odean, 2000, 2001; Odean, 1999; Grinblatt and Keloharju, 2000; Chen, Kim, Nofsinger, and Rui, 2007; Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean, 2009; Jones, Shi, Zhang, and Zhang, 2020). In contrast, several studies of retail investors (using a variety of datasets, methods, and horizons show that retail order imbalance positively predicts future returns at short horizons (Barber, Odean, and Zhu, 2008; Hvidkjaer, 2008; Kaniel, Saar, and Titman, 2008; Kaniel, Liu, Saar, and Titman, 2012; Kelley and Tetlock, 2013; Barrot, Kaniel, and Sraer, 2016; Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, and Zhang, 2020).1 Papers reach different conclusions about the profitability of retail trades. Odean (1999) finds that “even when trading costs are ignored, these investors actually lower their returns through trading” (p. 1296). Grinblatt and Keloharju (2000) write that “the least sophisticated investors (households)… generate the worst performance” (p. 66). And Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean (2008) conclude that “individual investor trading results in systematic and economically large losses” (p. 609). In contrast many order imbalance papers interpret the positive correlation between retail order imbalance and short-term future returns as evidence that retail investors profit from trading. One reason retail order imbalance may positively forecast short-term returns is that retail investors have insider information (or are able to predict future returns from public information). Kaniel, Liu, Saar, and Titman (2012) interpret the ability of retail order imbalance to predict returns around earnings and dividend announcements as “evidence consistent with informed or skillful trading by individual investors” (p. 677). Another reason why order imbalance may positively forecast short-term returns is that retail investors are contrarians who buy (sell) stocks that institutions want to sell (buy) and reap short-term rewards for providing liquidity. Kaniel, Saar, and Titman (2008) propose that retail order imbalance forecasts returns because individuals “provide liquidity to meet institutional demand for immediacy” (p. 273) leading to retail investor profits at horizons of 20 days or longer. An alternative explanation for the short-term predictability of retail order imbalance is that retail order imbalance is positively serially correlated. Barber, Odean, and Zhu (2008) document this correlation and argue that order imbalance positively predicts short- term returns because it predicts price pressure. This hypothesis does not imply that retail investors in aggregate earn positive short-term returns, because they themselves are the buyers (sellers) at the 1 At longer horizons, there is evidence that retail order imbalance negatively predicts returns (Barber, Odean, and Zhu, 2008; Hvidkjaer, 2008). In the appendix, we replicate these findings out-of-sample. The focus of this paper is the conflicting results at short horizons. 1 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

    "text": "temporarily high (low) prices they create. Finally, Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, and Zhang (2020) write that “persistence in order flow, and order flow driven by return reversals (our proxy for liquidity provision), accounts for about half of the predictive power of the marketable retail order imbalance for future returns, and we attribute the other half to potential informed trading” (p. 3). The two literatures summarized above present a paradox: Over short horizons, in aggregate retail investors lose by trading, but retail order imbalance positively predicts future returns. In this paper, we reconcile these two empirical observations. The paradox can be traced to two key issues. First, order imbalance studies tend to equal or value weight stocks while investor performance depends upon the extent to which investors buy and sell each stock. Stocks with positive order imbalance but relatively little retail trading subsequently perform well while retail purchases with the most retail trading perform miserably. As we discuss in detail below, the tendency for retail investors to herd into stocks that subsequently perform lines up well with an emerging literature that documents attention-induced buying by retail investors predicts poor returns. Second, order imbalance studies often ignore trading losses on the day of trade. As a result of these two factors, there is a large difference between hypothetical trading strategies based on retail order imbalance and the returns actually earned by retail investors. A value- weighted long-short portfolio based on retail order imbalance measured on day t and held through t+1 yields impressive annualized alphas of 5.74%. In contrast, a long-short portfolio that buys and shorts in proportion to aggregate retail trading over the same horizon generates an annualized alpha of -2.32%. These differences are even more striking among small stocks (bottom third of stocks based on market cap). Among these small stocks, equal-weighted order imbalance strategies generate a daily alpha of 16.2 bps (an annualized alpha greater than 40%), but a trade-weighted long-short portfolio that mimics the buys and sells of retail investors earns -11.2 bps (an annualized alpha of less than -28%). Our empirical analysis is based on US retail trades, which we identify in the Trades and Quote (TAQ) dataset from 2010-2019 using the price improvement algorithm described in Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, and Zhang (BJZZ, 2020). To start, we calculate standardized retail order imbalance on day t and construct quintiles based on retail order imbalance.2 For each quintile, we construct a calendar-time portfolio that buys stocks in the top quintile (stocks with mostly retail purchases) of retail order imbalance and shorts stocks in the bottom quintile (stocks with mostly retail sales). We vary the holding periods on this long- short portfolio from 1 to 10 days after the measurement of order imbalance. We then calculate the daily 2 Standardized order imbalance for a stock is the stock’s retail order imbalance less the market-wide retail order imbalance divided by the standard deviation of the stock’s retail order imbalance. The adjustment of standard deviation has the effect of deflating order imbalances that are measured using few trades. We prefer standardized order imbalance to simple order imbalance measures (e.g., buys less sells divided by buys plus sells) because without standardization the stocks that appear in extreme retail order imbalance quintiles tend to be small stocks with few trades. Our results are similar if we use the unstandardized measures but the economic significance of trading in the extreme order imbalance quintiles is smaller. 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

In Figure 1, Panel A, we summarize the daily equal-weighted abnormal returns separately for big, medium, and small stocks in the day after sorting (blue bars) and cumulated across five days after sorting (red bars). Size bins are based on sorting stocks into three equal size groups as in BJZZ (2020). Consistent with prior studies, retail order imbalance positively predicts short term returns (Barber, Odean, and Zhu, 2008; Kaniel, Saar, and Titman, 2008; Kaniel, Liu, Saar, and Titman, 2012; Kelley and Tetlock, 2013). The alphas from these order imbalance strategies range from a few basis points for big stocks to more than 16 bps for small stocks. The predictive ability of retail order imbalance is greatest for small stocks, consistent with the results in BJZZ (2020). These trading strategies indicate retail order imbalance is positively correlated with short-term future returns. However, the positive return on these long-short portfolios does not answer a related but distinct question: Do retail investors in aggregate profit from trading in the short-term? They do not. Using the same retail order imbalance dataset derived from TAQ 2010-2019, we calculate the trade- weighted returns on stocks bought less the trade-weighted returns on stocks sold on day t assuming the stocks are traded at observed transaction prices on day t and held through the close of t+1. We also consider holding periods ranging from t+1 and t+10. In Figure 1, Panel B, we summarize the abnormal returns for big, medium, and small stocks. In sharp contrast to the profitable trading strategies based on retail order imbalance, these results indicate that the average retail investor loses by trading. The losses range from a few basis points in big stocks to more than 20 basis points for small stocks. The analysis confirms results in prior studies that document aggregate short-term losses by retail investors (Odean, 1999; Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean, 2009; Jones, Shi, Zhang, and Zhang, 2020). As discussed above, there are two key reasons why retail investors lose money trading over the short horizons that we analyze even though their order imbalance positively predicts returns. The first reason is that retail buying is concentrated in stocks that perform poorly. Within the quintile of stocks with the greatest positive retail order imbalance, the stocks most aggressively purchased by retail investors substantially underperform. Thus though an equal or value-weighted portfolio of stocks with positive retail order imbalance performs well, a purchase-weighted portfolio of the same stocks does not. For example, the daily equal-weighted alpha on stocks in the top order imbalance quintile is +3.65 bps the next day (t=6.31). In sharp contrast, the purchase-weighted return on stocks in the same quintile of order imbalance is -4.47 bps (t=-3.02). Furthermore over 40% of all retail purchases occur in this top quintile of retail order imbalance. We show that the negative purchase-weighted returns of stocks in the top order imbalance quintile are driven by stocks with exceptionally high retail trading volume. For each stock, we calculate standardized abnormal retail trading volume on day t as the difference between observed retail volume on day t and its 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

    "text": "recent average (from t-45 to t-6) scaled by the standard deviation of retail volume over the same 40-day period. We then independently sort stocks into deciles of standardized abnormal retail trading volume and quintiles of retail order imbalance. The average stock in the top quintile of retail order imbalance and the top decile of abnormal retail volume earns an alpha of -5.78 bps (t=-2.62) the day after the trade; in contrast, the average stock in the top quintile of retail order imbalance but below the top decile of standardized abnormal retail volume earns an alpha of 3.74 bps (t=6.92). The observation that stocks with a combination of high levels of retail volume and disproportionate retail buying underperform connects to a number of studies that document attention-induced return effects from retail trading. When searching for stocks to buy, retail investors can choose from any stock in the market. However, when selling retail investors tend to sell that which they own. This asymmetry in the search problem of investors leads to coordinated attention-induced buying by retail investors which, in theory, can lead to predictably poor returns (Barber and Odean, 2008). Consistent with this narrative, the stocks with the biggest increase in users on the popular Robinhood app tend to earn poor returns (Barber, Huang, Odean and Schwarz, 2020). Similarly, a number of studies document price reversals following attention grabbing events: Jim Kramer’s stock recommendations (Engelberg, Sasseville, and Williams, 2012; Keasler and McNeil, 2010; Bolster, Trahan and Venkateswaran, 2012), the WSJ Dartboard Column (Liang, 1999; Barber and Loeffler, 1993), Google stock searches (Da, Engelberg, and Gao, 2011; Da, Hua, Hung and Peng, 2020), and repeat news stories (Tetlock, 2011). We contribute to this literature by documenting that stocks with a combination of high retail order imbalance and abnormal retail volume earn reliably poor returns. Furthermore, a large proportion of all retail buying is concentrated in these stocks. The second reason why retail investors lose money trading at short horizons even though their order imbalance positively predicts returns over the same horizon is that retail investors lose money on the day that they trade. The losses on the day of trade are often ignored in the analysis of returns based on retail order imbalance and are alone sufficient to offset any subsequent trading gains.3 In aggregate, the same- day trading losses can be traced to the effective bid-ask spread that investors pay for transacting. This result reinforces previous findings that indicate a large portion of investor losses in can be traced to trading costs which include commissions, spreads, and (in some jurisdictions) transaction taxes (Barber and Odean, 2000; Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean, 2009; Barrot, Kaniel, and Sraer, 2016). Thus, though transaction costs have declined substantially in the last several decades, spread costs alone are sufficient to offset aggregate short-term gains earned by retail trading. However, because retail buying is concentrated in stocks that perform poorly, even when we assume counterfactual transactions with zero spreads, in aggregate stocks bought by retail investors fail to reliably beat stocks sold. Moreover, the purchase-weighted return on stocks 3 A notable exception is Barrot, Kaniel, and Sraer (2016) who focus on the predictive ability of retail order imbalance in France, but acknowledge losses on the day of trade offset the gains they document. 4 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

    "text": "in the top quintile of retail order imbalance and the top decile of abnormal retail volume experience post- trade returns of -15.8 bps on the day of trade, which far exceed the purchase-weighted effective spread on these stocks (-3.85 bps). These are precisely the same group of stocks that go on to earn poor returns in the coming days. In additional analyses, we show small trades perform worse than large trades. In brokerage data with demographic information, trade size is correlated with wealth, income, and self-reported measures of investment experience and knowledge. The purchases among small trades are also more heavily concentrated in the group of stocks with high retail order imbalance and heavy retail volume that perform dismally, which is consistent with the notion that small, less sophisticated traders are more likely to be influenced by attention. Thus, the observation that small trades underperform large trades suggests that wealthier, more sophisticated, investors earn better returns than others, consistent with prior evidence (Barber and Odean, 2000; Grinblatt and Keloharju, 2000; Li, Geng and Subramanyam, 2017; Campbell, Ramadorai and Ranish, 2019; Jones et al., 2020). Our main contribution is to reconcile two well-established yet seemingly contradictory facts about equity markets: (1) retail order imbalance positively predicts short-term returns (2) in aggregate retail investors lose money over the short-term by trading. Two observations reconcile these facts. First, retail investor buying is highly concentrated in stocks that subsequently underperform; this underperformance is particularly acute for stocks with high retail order imbalance and abnormally high retail volume. The concentration of retail buying in underperforming stocks is consistent with the literature that documents investors earn predictably poor returns following attention-grabbing events (Engelberg, Sasseville, and Williams, 2012; Keasler and McNeil, 2010; Bolster, Trahan and Venkateswaran, 2012; Liang, 1999; Barber and Loeffler, 1993; Da, Engelberg, and Gao, 2011; Da, et al., 2020; Tetlock, 2011; Barber, Huang, Odean and Schwarz, 2020). Second, investors lose money on the day of trade, mostly to spread costs. Prior studies have hypothesized that retail order imbalance positively predicts short-term returns because retail investors are informed or profit from providing liquidity. While some retail investors are undoubtedly informed and some may profit from providing liquidity, in aggregate retail investors lose money through trading in the short-term just as they do in the long-term. 1.

For all trades with the exchange code “D,” Boehmer et al. (2020) tag those trades with prices that end with a fractional penny in the range of (0, 0.4) as sales and those trades with prices that end with a fractional penny in the rage of (0.6, 1) as purchases. We use the same rule to identify the directions of trades. In our main analysis, we exclude retail trades as identified with the BJZZ algorithm that are for more than $100,000 because our primary interest is in small retail investors and mean trade size at US retail brokers tend to be much less than this threshold.4 Note that this algorithm only identifies market orders because limit orders are executed at whole pennies (BJZZ, 2020). Some argue retail market orders perform better than retail limit orders (Kelley and Tetlock, 2013; Linnainmaa, 2010). If so, our analysis will overstate the profitability of retail trades. We limit the sample to U.S. common stocks (CRSP share code 10 or 11) traded on NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ during normal trading hours (9:30:00 – 16:00:00) from January 2010 to December 2019. We exclude stocks impacted by the Tick Size Pilot program between October 2016 and October 2018. On October 3, 2016, following an order from SEC, the National Securities Exchanges and FINRA implemented a two-year Tick Size Pilot program. The Order approved the NMS Plan for a two-year period and officially commenced. In two of the test groups (G2 and G3) which limit trading prices at $0.05 increments, we observe a sizable drop in the trades identified as retail trading the pilot stocks (around 360 stocks in each group). Therefore, we drop the two pilot groups in the Tick Size Pilot program for the entire duration of the test.5 Because the main part of our analysis involves the measurement of retail order imbalance, we limit our analysis to stocks in which there are at least 10 retail transactions in a trading day. In Figure 2, we plot trades identified as retail (using the BJZZ methodology) as an average percentage of market volume. The average percentage of market volume is calculated by summing the value of all retail buys and sells and dividing by total market volume. Alternatively, we calculate the ratio of retail dollar volume to market volume individually for each stock and then average across stocks. The figure reveals retail volume represents between 4 to 6% of total market volume (red line) and 8 to 12% of dollar volume for the average stock (blue line), which indicates retail volume is more common in stocks with relatively low volume. 4 Gargano and Rossi (2018) report a mean trade size of $16,000 at a US brokerage firm. Barber and Odean (2000) report mean trade size for buys (sells) of $13,707 ($11,205). Trades above $100,000 represent 1.7% of the number of trades and 31.4% of the value of trades identified using the BJZZ algorithm. In a March 2, 2021, draft of this paper we report all results including trades above $100,000 and reach similar conclusions. In section 4, we analyze results by trade size (including trades above $100,000) and find smaller retail trades generate bigger losses. 5 Most of the pilots started around Oct 2016 and ended around Oct 2018. Stocks in the first test group and the control group did not experience a discernable change in trades identified as retail trades by the algorithm. 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

    "text": "Consider a market participant who is trying to assess retail sentiment in stock i on day t. Stocks that are purchased more than average have positive retail sentiment, stocks purchase less, negative. However, for some stocks the participant observes many trades; for others, fewer. Whether the participant can conclude the retail sentiment is relatively bullish will thus be a function of both the proportion of trades that are buys and the number of trades observed in the stock (i.e., the reliability of the estimate). To formalize this intuition, define 𝑏 (𝑠 ) as the number of retail buys (sells) for stock i, day t, and the !\" !\" total volume of retail trades as 𝑣 = 𝑏 + 𝑠 .

We prefer the standardized measure of order imbalance to the !\" !\" unscaled version of equation (1) because the unscaled version tends to push stocks with fewer trades to the extreme order imbalance bins although order imbalance for these stocks is likely less informative regarding retail sentiment. Nonetheless, we report results based on equation (1) in an online appendix and reach similar conclusions. 1.3 Measuring Abnormal Volume The second key measure in our analysis is standardized abnormal retail trading volume (𝑆𝐴𝑅𝑉 ).

(8) !\" 𝑣̅ !\" 1.4 Summary Statistics Table 1 presents summary statistics across stock-day observations. The mean stock-day has a mean of 311 retail trades, split about evenly between buys and sells. This corresponds to a mean (median) stock-day purchase of 51,000 (10,000) shares with a dollar value of $1,294,000 ($159,000). Statistics for retail sales across stock-day observations are similar. Retail volume is heavily skewed and concentrated in a few companies, similar to what we observe in the distribution of market volume and market capitalization. Order imbalance, defined as the difference between buys and sells scaled by their sum has a mean and median close to zero based on the number or value of trade. Standardized order imbalance has a negative mean (-0.244) and median (-0.265) and is positively skewed, which indicates retail buying is more likely to be concentrated than retail selling. This is noteworthy as it is consistent with attention-induced trading by retail investors, which tends to concentrate buying but not selling activity (Barber and Odean, 2008; Barber, Huang, Odean, and Schwarz, 2020). The two measures of abnormal retail volume (ARV and SARV) are also positively skewed, which indicates that volume tends to concentrate on a few days for the same stock.6 Much of our analysis focuses on daily quintile sorts based on standardized retail order imbalance (SOI). In Table 2, Panel A, we present the mean order imbalance for each of the five quintiles on the sorting day 6 The slightly positive means of the abnormal volume measures results from the pre-event window that we employ. If we calculate retail volume using a window that spans the event day (e.g., -20 to +20) the means are very close to zero. We choose to use a pre-event window to avoid any concerns that the calculation of the mean using a post-event window creates a lookahead bias. 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

    "text": "by first calculating the mean order imbalance within each quintile on the sorting day and then averaging across the days in our sample. Stocks with the most extreme standardized order imbalance also have the biggest buy-sell imbalances based on number or value of retail trades. Table 2, Panel B, present statistics on mean market cap and mean volume across stock-day observations for each quintile. Larger firms and firms with greater volume tend to end up in the extreme quintiles. We also observe firms with high levels of abnormal retail volume (ARV and SARV) end up in the extreme quintiles. This is partly because the larger volume of retail trades in these large, high-volume stocks allows for a more precise estimates of order imbalance. In contrast, if we sort on order imbalance based on number of trades, the extreme quintiles are populated by relatively small stocks (see Table A1), which represent a small percentage of total market volume. We prefer the standardized measure because it accounts for both the level of order imbalance and the precision with which it is estimated. Our empirical results do not hinge on this choice and we present parallel results for the unstandardized measure of order imbalance in the online appendix. A particularly important observation from Table 2 is the distribution of retail order imbalance across the five order imbalance quintiles, which we summarize in Figure 3. Volume is unusually high in both extreme order imbalance quintiles. As a result, trading is concentrated in these quintiles. Not surprisingly, retail buying is concentrated in the top order imbalance quintile with 41.5% of all buying. However, retail selling is also quite strong in this top order imbalance quintile and the percent of selling in this top order imbalance quintile exceeds the selling in the bottom order imbalance quintile (33.3% v. 31.1%). These observations are consistent with the abnormal volume measures of Table 2, which indicate that the highest levels of abnormal volume are observed in the top order imbalance quintile followed by the lowest order imbalance quintile. 2. The Retail Performance Paradox 2.1 Order Imbalance Trading Strategies To replicate the observation that retail order imbalance positively predicts short-term returns, we analyze a trading strategy that sorts stocks by standardized order imbalance quintiles on each trading day (t) and invests in either a value-weighted or equal-weighted portfolio of stocks in each quintile. In our main analysis, we focus on holding periods of 1, 5, and 10 days because the returns associated with the strategy are indistinguishable from zero beyond a 10-day holding period. Specifically, the equal weighted portfolio invests in $1/𝑃 shares of stock i at the close of trading on !+ the day t; 𝑃 is the closing price of stock i on day t. The day t+1 portfolio return is calculated as: !\" 9 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

Table 3 summarizes the daily market-adjusted returns and FF6 alphas for the quintile portfolios. Consistent with prior research, we see in Panel A that the one-day abnormal return on the long-short portfolio is 2.28 to 2.64 bps (p<.01) for value-weighted portfolios and grows to 5.57 to 5.68 bps (p<.01) for equal-weighted portfolios, which indicates the predictive power of retail order imbalance is greater for small stocks. At a five-day horizon (Panel B), the value-weighted daily alpha is 0.71 to 0.99 bps (or a total of 3.55 to 4.95 bps across the five-day holding period), but statistical significance is marginal. At the 10-day 7 We invest in $1/P shares rather than $1 so that the portfolio weights are those associated with a strategy that does not involve daily rebalancing implicit in an equal-weighted strategy. The implicit rebalancing in an equal-weighted strategy leads to positively biased returns in the presence of bid-ask spreads, which can be problematic in smalls stocks. 10 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

    "text": "horizon (Panel C), the spreads are no longer statistically significant though point estimates are in the same ballpark as those observed at shorter horizons (0.33 and 0.59 bps cumulate to 3.2 and 5.9 bps at 10 days). In contrast, the size of the effects for the equal-weighted portfolios remains statistically significant, large, and persists at the 10-day horizon. For example, the FF6 equal-weighted alpha is 5.57 bps (p<.01) at a one- day horizon and 1.31 bps or cumulative 13.1 bps (p<.01) at a 10-day horizon. For value-weighted strategies there is no meaningful drift beyond 10 days with weak evidence of a continued drift for the equal-weighted strategies (Panel D).8 The relation between firm size and the predictability is underscored when we split the sample into three equal size groups: big, medium, and small. Size groups are created annually in December. In Figure 1, Panel A, we present the FF6 alpha on the equal-weighted long-short portfolios for the three size groups at horizons of one and five days. The big stocks are similar in magnitude to the value-weighted results since big stocks dominate the market. The predictability grows for medium and small firms. 2.2 Aggregate Performance of Retail Investors As just described, we assess the predictive power of retail trades by comparing the return of an equal (or value) weighted portfolio of stocks in the highest order imbalance quintile to the return of a portfolio of stocks in the lowest order imbalance portfolio. To analyze the aggregate performance of retail investors, we calculate the difference between the return of a retail purchase-weighted portfolio and the return of a retail sales-weighted portfolio. Weighting portfolios by how much retail investors bought or sold each stock closely tracks the aggregate retail profits and losses from trading. It also allows a direct comparison to the returns of the trading strategies based on quintiles of retail order imbalance. When aggregate sales and purchases are equal, which is approximately true during our sample period (see Table 1), the sign of the trade-weighted return difference in any period will have the same sign of the aggregate retail profits or losses from trading. The magnitude of the gains or losses will depend on the intensity of trading, measured by portfolio turnover. To see this, consider the following example: An investor holds a $100,000 equity portfolio. Absent trading, the portfolio will earn 10% in the coming year. However, at the beginning of the year the investor decides to sell $50,000 in stock S to buy stock B. The $50,000 purchase of Stock B earns 10% during the year. The stock sold, stock S, earns 0% during the year, which implies the $50,000 of stock that was originally held in the portfolio earned 20% (since the buy-and-hold option earned 10% = 50%*0%+ 50%*20%). Thus, the return on the portfolio that traded is 15%, or a return improvement of 5 percentage 8 We observe similar results for portfolios formed on # BSI in Table A2. The long-short spreads tend to be a bit larger because the extreme quintiles are populated by smaller stocks when one sorts on # BSI rather than SOI and the return predictability of order imbalance is greater for small stocks (see Figure 1, Panel A). 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

    "text": "points relative to the buy-and-hold counterfactual. Note that the return improvement of five percentage points is the turnover rate times the difference in the returns of stocks bought less stocks sold: 50%*(20%- 10%) = 5%. When sales and purchase activity are equal, we can summarize the relation between the return on a buy-and-hold portfolio (𝑅 ) and a counterfactual portfolio with trading (𝑅6 ) as: ,\" ,\" 𝑅6 −𝑅 = 𝑇𝑂 B𝑅7 −𝑅8 C, (13) ,\" ,\" \" ,\" ,\" where 𝑇𝑂 is the turnover in the stock portfolio, defined as ½ the dollar value of purchases plus sales !\" divided by the portfolio size, 𝑅7 is the purchase-weighted return on stocks bought, and 𝑅8 is the sales- ,\" ,\" weighted return on stocks sold. (See the appendix for a detailed derivation of the equation.) The key takeaway is the sign of the investor profits is the same sign as the difference in return between stocks bought and stocks sold; the magnitude of the profits (or losses) will be determined by the amount of turnover in the portfolio. In our empirical analysis, we calculate the mean daily abnormal return on purchase-weighted portfolio less the mean daily abnormal return on a sales-weighted portfolio of stocks. There are two reasons that this statistic might depart from the actual retail profits and losses. First, as discussed above the calculation assumes that aggregate purchases equal aggregate sales, which is approximately true on average (see Table 1). However, if purchases perform better (worse) on days when purchases are greater than sales then the mean return difference will underestimate (overestimate) retail performance. Second, the calculation of the mean daily abnormal return weights each day equally. If retail investors perform better (worse) on days with high levels of retail trading (or turnover), we would underestimate (overestimate) the performance of retail investors because of the positive relation between turnover and performance. We address these two concerns in an auxiliary analysis by calculating dollar profits (rather than returns) as in Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean (2009) and obtain results similar to those reported using more standard return calculations below. (See Appendix Tables A3 and A4.) We construct a buy portfolio assuming shares of each stock are purchased at the observed purchase price of retail investors. Of course, different investors buy at different prices on the same day, so we use the trade-weighted average purchase price. Thus, the portfolio includes the intraday return on the day of trade (t), which is generally ignored by the order imbalance strategy of the prior section but is obviously a return experienced by retail investors. Similar to the order imbalance strategy, we trace out the returns on the buy portfolio 1, 5, and 10 days after trade. There is an analogous calculation for the sell portfolio. In Table 4, we present the daily market-adjusted returns and abnormal returns (FF6 alphas) of trading strategies that mimic the buys or sells of retail investors and assume execution at observed trading prices on the day of trade (t).

    "text": "returns, presented in the last column of the table provides an assessment of whether investors gain or lose from trading. Retail investors consistently lose from trading. Though both buys and sells earn poor returns, the stocks purchased underperform the stocks sold by more than 0.89 bps per day (t=-10.02 and -10.63 for market- adjusted and FF6 alpha, respectively) when performance is measured through the close of trading on the day following trade (t+1) (or 1.78 bps = 0.70 bps/day * 2 days across the two days). Though the daily alphas decline with holding periods, the cumulative losses are generally similar in magnitude. For example, the FF6 daily alpha at a holding period through t+5 of -0.29 implies a loss through the close of day t+5 of 1.74 bps = 0.29bps/day*6 days (t=-4.69). These results indicate the losses from retail trading tend to concentrate in the period immediately following trade. This conclusion is further buttressed by the results of Panel D, which shows there are no unusual returns on the long-short portfolios from t+11 to t+21. These results provide a stark contrast to those of Table 3, where we show retail order imbalance positively predicts returns. To further explore this apparent paradox, we split our sample into three equal size groups at the December of each year and recalculate the results of both tables for each size group. We present the results of this analysis in Figure 1, Panel B. In Figure 1, the retail performance paradox becomes even more apparent. In both Panels A and B results for big stocks are essentially the same as those presented for all stocks in Tables 3 and 4. This is because retail trading volume is concentrated in these stocks. In Panel A, we see the performance of the retail order imbalance strategy improves as we move to medium and small stocks. In Panel B, and in stark contrast to Panel A, the performance of the trade-weighted strategy that mimics the buys and sells of retail investors deteriorates for medium and small stocks. 2.3 Retail Performance within Order Imbalance Quintiles To further explore the paradox, we analyze the return on the stocks bought and stocks sold within each of the five order imbalance quintiles. Table 5 summarizes the results. Not surprisingly, the trade-weighted returns on buys and sells within each of the order imbalance quintiles follow similar patterns though the returns on stocks bought are generally lower than the returns on stocks sold within each order imbalance quintile. Perhaps the most striking result is the observation that the spreads between the high and low order imbalance quintiles are consistently negative and statistically significant. The spreads are mostly driven by the extremely poor returns of trade-weighted returns in the top order imbalance quintile. In Figure 4, we graph the returns on the order imbalance quintiles across the four different weighting schemes: equal-weighted, value-weighted, buy-weighted and sell-weighted. In Panel A, we present the FF6 alpha for the equal and value weighted portfolios at a one day holding period. There is a clear positive pattern as one moves from the low order imbalance quintile to the high order imbalance quintile, in which 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

In sharp contrast to Panel A, there is a clear negative pattern as one moves from the low order imbalance quintile to the high order imbalance quintile and within each order imbalance quintile buys underperform sells. The most negative returns are earned on the stocks bought in the order imbalance quintile with greatest standardized order imbalance (SOI quintile 5). This is also where we observe more than 42% of all retail buying (see Figure 3). 3. Resolving the Paradox In this section, we reconcile the seemingly disparate results of the prior section: retail order imbalance positively predicts short-term returns, but in aggregate retail investors lose in the short-term by trading. Moreover, purchase-weighted returns on stocks within the high retail order imbalance quintile earn poor returns although value-weighted and equal-weighted portfolios of stocks within this order imbalance quintile earn positive alphas. There are two key components to the reconciliation: the returns on the day of trade and concentration of retail purchases in a small number of stocks that earn large negative abnormal returns. We discuss each in turn. 3.1 Returns on the Day of Trade One part of the disconnect between the strong predictive power of order imbalance and the poor returns earned by retail investors in aggregate are the returns earned on the day of trade. The order imbalance strategies omit these intraday returns and begin return analysis on the day following the measurement of order imbalance, but retail investors experience these intraday returns. In Table 6, we separately analyze the returns on the day of trade (Panel A) and subsequent days (Panels B to D). (See Appendix Table A4 for the similar analysis of dollar profits.) In Panel A, we see that buys underperform sells by about 2.60 bps (t=-40.97) on the day of trade, which accounts for a large portion of the performance shortfall of retail investors. In Panel B, we see that both stocks bought and sold perform poorly on the day after trade though buys outperform sells by a 0.24 bps (p<.10), but the spread is not sufficient to offset the same day losses of investors. Moreover, at the longer horizon of 10 days the stocks bought underperform stocks sold though the difference is not statistically significant. In Figure 5, Panel A, we present the intraday return difference between stocks bought and stocks sold for big, medium, and small stocks (annually sorted into three size terciles) in red and the estimated round- trip spread costs in black.

    "text": "returns on the day of trade, which in turn can be traced to investors paying spread costs.9 In aggregate, retail investors enjoy some gains from intraday price movement but the gains are not sufficient to offset transaction costs. In the next section, we analyze the relation between these intraday price patterns, retail volume, and retail order imbalance; we find important cross-sectional variation in the relation as stocks with a both heavy retail buying and high retail volume experience intraday price movements that exacerbate, rather than offset, losses from spread costs. In Figure 5, Panel B, we recreate the returns of Figure 1, Panel B, but exclude the returns on the day of trade (including spread costs). In other words, these results present the trade-weighted return spread on stocks bought less stocks sold assuming transaction at closing prices on the day of trade (rather than observed transaction prices). We still fail to find robust evidence that stocks bought outperform stocks sold after excluding the return on the day of trade. This stands in sharp contrast to the returns earned on long- short trading strategies based on retail order imbalance, which we summarize in Figure 1, Panel A. Thus, the losses on the day of trade do not completely explain the starkly different returns for strategies based on retail order imbalance and the aggregate performance of retail trades. To provide further insight on this remaining disparity, we analyze the returns on buy-weighted and sell- weighted portfolios within each order imbalance quintile on the day of trade versus other days. In Table 7, Panel A, we present results for returns on the day of trade. Investors incur losses from buying stocks in the highest order imbalance quintile (-5.16 bps, t=-4.43) and 42% of their purchases are concentrated in this order imbalance quintile. Investors are compensated for buying stocks in the low retail order imbalance quintile (2.11 bps, t=1.87), but only 24% of their purchases are in this order imbalance quintile. We observe a similar return pattern for sales; sales-weighted returns on stocks in quintile 1 (lowest SOI with 31% of all sales) are 3.72 bps (t=3.54) and sales-weighted returns on stocks in quintile 5 (highest SOI with 33% of all sales) are -3.37 bps (t=-2.84). In Table 7, Panels B to D, we observe that the purchase-weighted stocks in the heavy retail order imbalance quintile, which represent 42% of all buying, continue to earn poor returns across the next several days and underperform stocks purchased in the retail order imbalance quintile with heavy retail selling. In summary, the returns on the day of trade are sufficiently large to yield overall losses for retail investors. However, the trade day returns are not the full story. A purchase-weighted portfolio of stocks in the top order imbalance quintile earns poor returns after the date of trade, in striking contrast to the strong returns earned on value and equal-weighted portfolios of stocks in this quintile. 9 The effective spread is calculated as the midpoint of the bid and ask prices divided by the transaction price. Thus, the remainder of the intraday return can be ascribed to intraday price movement from the transaction time to the closing price. In decomposing the intraday return, we exclude trades with effective spreads greater than 10% (less than 0.3% of all stock-day observations). 15 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

    "text": "The disconnect between trade-weighted returns (i.e., the returns investors actually earn) within an order imbalance quintile versus the value or equal-weighted returns within the same quintile indicates that stocks with unusually high levels of retail buying earn poor returns. In this section, we further explore this empirical observation by partitioning each order imbalance quintile based on deciles of standardized abnormal retail volume (SARV) on the day of trade (t). (SARV deciles are calculated independently of order imbalance.) For each order imbalance quintile, we then separately analyze the returns on portfolios in the top decile of SARV versus the remaining nine deciles. We present the daily alphas on value and equal-weighted portfolios in Table 8. In Panel A, we see that the returns on the day following trade (t+1) have different patterns conditional on the level of retail trade. For value-weighted portfolios (left columns), the return spread across the extreme order imbalance quintiles in the bottom nine retail volume deciles (SARV D1-D9) is 2.73 bps (t=4.45); in contrast, the estimated spread is -4.45 (t=-2.07) for the top retail volume decile (SARV D10). The 7.17 bps difference between these two return spreads is statistically significant (t=-3.27). At horizons of 5 and 10 days (Panels B and C), the value-weighted portfolios generate a difference in return spreads that is somewhat larger, but statistical significance declines: 8.45 bps at 5 day (1.69 bps/day * 5 days) and 12.00 bps at 10 days (1.20 bps/day * 10 days). The different patterns of order imbalance predictability across deciles of standardized abnormal retail volume are much more dramatic for equal-weighted portfolios because they weight small stocks more heavily. For equal-weighted portfolios (right columns), the return spread across the extreme order imbalance quintiles in the bottom nine retail volume deciles (SARV D1-D9) is 6.25 bps (t=11.63); in contrast, the estimated spread is -7.50 (t=-5.58) for the top retail volume decile (SARV D10). The 13.76 bps difference between these two return spreads is statistically significant (t=-4.35). At horizons of 5 and 10 days (Panels B and C), the economic significance of this difference in difference grows to 42.2 bps=8.45 bps/day * 5 days and 53.8 bps=5.38 bps/day * 10 days (and remains statistically significant). In appendix table A5, we present purchase and sales weighted returns for each of the SOI Quintile and SARV partitions and find even larger differences in differences. We find similar patterns in the intraday return on the day of trade. In Figure 6, Panel A, we plot the purchase-weighted return on the day of trade for stocks in the bottom nine deciles of standardized retail abnormal volume across for each SOI quintile.10 Effective spreads vary little across SOI quintiles, though they are bit lower in the extremes (likely because big stocks tend to end up in the extreme quintiles due to 10 Appendix Figure 2 presents a similar analysis for sales and finds similar patterns. Note that the comparison of buy and sell returns within a particular partition or order imbalance and abnormal retail volume is misleading because buying activity is more concentrated in the top order imbalance quintile (SOI 5) than is selling activity. 16 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

    "text": "the standardization). Intraday price movement generally helps offset some of the spread costs, but the effect varies by SOI quintile and is smallest in the top SOI quintile (where most buying activity occurs). In Figure 6, Panel B, we observe very different patterns for stocks with heavy abnormal retail volume (top decile of SARV). For these stocks, effective spreads again vary little across the SOI quintiles though they are somewhat bigger than those observed for days with low retail volume. However, for the top SOI quintile (stocks heavily bought) the intraday price movement contributes far more to the losses of retail investors than does the effective spread. This echoes the pattern of poor returns for these stocks on the day after trade (Table 7, Panel A). It is worth again emphasizing that the top order imbalance quintile represents 42% of total retail purchases (see Figure 3). The top decile of abnormal retail volume within this quintile represents 8.1% of all retail purchases (by dollars traded); yet it is these stocks that earn the worst returns on the day of trade and the days that follow. This interaction between the level of retail volume and the predictability associated with retail order imbalance is an important reason why retail investors lose from trading despite the fact the retail order imbalance positively predicts returns. 3.3 Panel Regressions To further investigate the interaction of order imbalance and abnormal volume, we estimate a panel regression of the following form: 9 9 𝑟 = 𝑎+ < 𝑏 𝑆𝑂𝐼 +<𝑐 𝑆𝑂𝐼 ∗𝐻𝑖𝑆𝐴𝑅𝑉 +𝜇 +𝑒 , !,\".1 9 !\" 9 !\" !\" \".1 !,\".1 (14) 9|(9<=) 9 9 where 𝑟 is the daily return on stock i on day t+h, 𝑆𝑂𝐼 is an indicator that takes a value of one if the !,\".1 !\" stock is in SOI quintile q on day t, and 𝐻𝑖𝑆𝐴𝑅𝑉 is an indicator that takes a value of one if the stock is in !\" the top SARV decile day t, and 𝜇 are day fixed effects. Since we omit the middle order imbalance quintile, \".1 the b coefficients represent return differences relative to SOI quintile three. The c coefficients represent the incremental return on a stock that is in the top decile of retail order imbalance within each order imbalance quintile, q=1,2,3,4,5. Standard errors are clustered by day to address the cross-correlation of returns observed on the same day. We summarize the results in Table 9. The indicator variables on the order imbalance quintiles yield impressive return spread on the day following the measurement of order imbalance. On day t+1, stocks in the top order imbalance quintile (q=5) earn an extra 3.67 bps (t=6.48) relative to the baseline quintile (quintile 3) and stocks in the bottom quintile (q=1) earn -2.61 bps (t=-5.09), a spread of 6.3 bps. Note that this analysis sorts stocks on daily order imbalance, weights stock-day observations equally, and does not include intraday returns on day t. In these respects, the analysis is similar to that reported for equal weighted portfolios in Table 3.

    "text": "calendar-time equal-weighted portfolio of Table 3 is very close to the 6.3 bps performance spread between the high and low SOI quintiles in Table 9 for stocks in the bottom nine abnormal retail volume deciles. However, the interaction of order imbalance on heavy retail trading volume generates a markedly different pattern. On day t+1, stocks in the top order imbalance quintile and the top decile of standardized abnormal retail volume underperform other stocks in the same quintile by -10.07 bps (t=-4.67) and the relative underperformance persists for at least another two days. In Panel B, we observe the total return effect for these stocks (summing the coefficients on the 𝑆𝑂𝐼) indicator and its interaction with 𝐻𝑖𝑆𝐴𝑅𝑉) \" \" yield reliably negative returns of -6.40, -7.88 and -4.91 bps on days t+1 to t+3 respectively (all with p<.01). These results provide further support for the observation that the trading strategies based on retail order imbalance yield results that are the opposite of those documented in the extant literature when we interact order imbalance with the intensity of retail trading. 4. Trade Size and Performance In this section, we analyze the relation between trade size and performance to shed light on potential cross-sectional variation in the performance of retail investors. When we analyze the trade-weighted returns of stocks bought and sold, we show that in aggregate retail trades lose money. The average performance of retail investors will equal their trade-weighted aggregate performance if trade size is unrelated to performance. However, we conjecture that trade size is related to retail investment performance for two reasons. First, prior studies find that wealth and trade performance are positively correlated (Barber and Odean, 2000; Li, Geng and Subramanyam, 2017; Campbell, Ramadorai and Ranish, 2019; Jones et al., 2020).11 Second, wealthier investors are likely, on average, to execute large trades. We verify this second assertion for a subset of investors with accounts at a large discount brokerage (1991-1996) and report our findings in the appendix Figure A1. Trade size covaries positively with self-reported wealth and income as well as investment knowledge and experience. To test the conjecture that trade size is related to retail investment performance, we construct six trade size (TS) bins with the following cutoffs: 𝑇𝑆 ≤ $500; $500 < 𝑇𝑆 ≤ $2,000; $2,000 < 𝑇𝑆 ≤ $10,000; $10,000 < 𝑇𝑆 ≤ $30,000; $30,000 < 𝑇𝑆 ≤ $100,000 and 𝑇𝑆 > $100,000. The biggest trade size bin represents trades that we exclude from our main analysis (𝑇𝑆 > $100,000). In Figure 7, Panel A, we summarize the total proportion of trades that fall into each trade size bin. When measured by the number of trades (black bars), 34% of trades fall into the two small trade size bins and about 1.7% of trades fall into 11 In contrast, Welch (2020) finds the aggregate holdings of Robinhood investors, who are likely less wealthy and less experienced than the average retail investor, earn strong returns from 2018 to 2020. Relatedly, trades at retail brokers outperform trades at a discount broker in Australia (Fong, Gallagher, and Lee, 2014) and trades of high IQ investors outperform other retail investors in Finland (Grinblatt, Keloharju, and Linnainmaa, 2012). 18 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

    "text": "the biggest trade size bin (>$100,000). In contrast, when measured by the value of trades, 31.4% of trades fall into the sixth trade size group. We next investigate whether small trades are more likely to be purchases of attention-grabbing stocks. Recall that stocks with heavy buying and abnormal retail trading earn poor returns. If small trades are placed by less sophisticated investors, we conjecture that we will observe a greater concentration of small buys in stocks the top quintile of order imbalance and top decile of retail abnormal volume. Furthermore, because of the asymmetric effects of attention on buying and selling, we conjecture this effect will be less pronounced for stocks sold. To investigate this issue, we use abnormal trading volume as a proxy for attention (Barber and Odean, 2008). For each day we calculate the percentage of all small buys (i.e., trades < $500) that are concentrated in stocks in the top quintile of standardized order imbalance (SOI quintile 5) and the top decile of standardized abnormal retail volume (SARV decile 10). This generates a time series of daily percentages from which we calculate an average daily percentage. This calculation is repeated for small buys. There is an analogous calculation of the two statistics for the other trade size bins. This generates 12 average daily percentages (i.e., buy and sell percentages for the top SARV decile for each of the 6 trade size bins). In Figure 7 Panel B, we graph the concentration of buying and selling in attention-grabbing stocks within each of the trade size bin. There is a clear pattern for buying. Small purchases are disproportionately concentrated in the attention-grabbing stocks that earn poor subsequent returns. For small purchases, 12.65% of all trades are concentrated in these stocks compared to 6.95% for big purchases. In contrast, we do not observe as distinct a pattern for small sales, which range from 7.49% for small trades to 6.87% for big trades. The concentration of small purchases in these attention-grabbing stocks would occur if small traders are more likely than big traders to purchase stocks that capture their attention. The lack of differences in the concentration of sales would occur if attention is less of a factor in sales decisions, since investors tend to only sell that which they own and small investors tend to invest in only a few stocks (Barber and Odean, 2000; Goetzman and Kumar, 2008). Finally, we calculate the trade-weighted returns on buys and sells within each trade size bin and varying the holding period from one day to five days (as in Table 4). In Figure 7, Panel C, we summarize the spreads on the purchase-weighted returns of stocks bought less the sales-weighted returns of stocks sold within each trade size bin. The smallest trade size bin experiences losses of 16.8 bps at a one-day holding period and these losses grow to 20.2 bps at a five-day holding period. In sharp contrast, the biggest trade size bin has much smaller losses at a one-day holding period (0.5 bps though statistically significant at the 1% level), which shrink to a statistically insignificant 0.2 bps at a five-day holding period. 19 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

    "text": "We can convincingly conclude that small trades perform worse than large trades. Thus, the aggregate returns from trading overestimate the returns of most retail trades. And, since trade size varies with wealth, the percentage losses of less wealthy retail investors are likely larger than those of wealthier investors. 5. Conclusion We reconcile two well established yet seemingly contradictory empirical findings: 1) in the short-term retail traders underperform, and 2) retail trade order imbalance positively predicts short-term returns. Two key observations explain the paradox. First, retail performance is quite poor on the day trades execute. Most order imbalance studies do not include same day returns when evaluating the predictive value of retail trades. Second, retail buying is highly concentrated in trades that perform poorly. Order imbalance studies evaluate hypothetical equal-weighted and value-weighted portfolios strategies, not the actual returns retail investors earn on trades. Thus the trades of retail investors can be interpreted in a way that positively forecasts returns even though these trades, in aggregate, negatively impact retail investor performance. We tie the underperformance of retail trades to attention-based trading. We find that the purchases of retail investors perform worst when retail order imbalance is high and retail trading volume is high. This is consistent with the theoretical prediction that retail investors will be heavily on the buy side of the market when stocks catch their attention and that this buying will lead to temporary price increases followed by reversals (Barber and Odean, 2008). It is also consistent with the observation the emerging literature that links attention-grabbing events to subsequent negative abnormal returns.12 We also find that small trades, which tend to be made by less wealthy, less experienced, and less sophisticated investors are more concentrated in attention-grabbing stocks and perform worse than large trades. Several explanations have been offered for both the negative effect of trading on retail investor performance and the positive signal from retail order imbalance. These explanations are not mutually exclusive. Retail investors may make wealth reducing trades because they do not realize that they are at an informational disadvantage and expect their trades to perform well; in other words, they are overconfident in their ability to trade (Odean, 1998, 1999; Barber and Odean, 2000, 2001; Statman, Thorley, and Vorkink, 2006; Glaser and Weber, 2007). Retail investors may also make wealth reducing trades because they find trading entertaining (Dorn and Sengmueller, 2009; Luo and Subrahmanyam, 2019), have an urge to gamble 12 For example, scholars have analyzed Kramer’s Mad Money (Engelberg, Sasseville, and Williams, 2012; Keasler and McNeil, 2010; Bolster, Trahan and Venkateswaran, 2012), the WSJ Dartboard Column (Liang, 1999; Barber and Loeffler, 1993), Google stock searches (Da, Engelberg, and Gao, 2011; Da, Hua, Hung and Peng 2020), and repeat news stories (Tetlock, 2011). 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3783492",

Retail trades may positively forecast short-term returns because retail investors are better informed than others (Kaniel, Liu, Saar, and Titman, 2012; Kelley and Tetlock, 2013; Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, and Zhang, 2020), because they are rewarded for providing liquidity to institutional investors (Kaniel, Saar, and Titman, 2008; Kaniel, Liu, Saar, and Titman, 2012; Barrot, Kaniel, and Sraer, 2016), or because their order imbalance is positively correlated and thus forecasts short term price pressure on stock prices (Barber, Odean, and Zhu, 2006). While the informed trading of some retail investors or the willingness of others to provide liquidity may contribute to the short-term predictiveness of retail order imbalance, our results confirm that, in aggregate, retail investors do not profit from trading.

Long-Short Abnormal Return that Mimics the Buys and Sells of Retail Investors Fig. 1 The US Retail Performance Paradox In Panel A, the long-short strategy involves buying stocks in the top quintile of retail order imbalance (heavily bought by retail investors) and shorting stocks in the bottom quintile of retail order imbalance (heavily sold); all portfolios equal weight stocks. In Panel B, the long-short strategy involves buying stocks in proportion to retail purchases and selling stocks in proportion to retail sales. Abnormal returns are calculated as the intercept of the regression of the long-short return on the Fama-French five factor model plus a momentum factor.

Proportion of Retail Trade Numbers and Value by Trade Size Panel B. Concentration of Trading in Attention-Grabbing Stocks within Each Trade Size Bin Panel C. Long-Short Buy-Sell Retail Returns by Trade Size Fig. 7 Proportion of Trade and Buy-Sell Returns by Trade Size Panel A presents the proportion of all trades in each trade size bin by number of trades (black) or value of trades (grey). Panel B shows the mean daily percentage of the total value of trade within a trade size bin that appears in stocks in the top retail order imbalance quintile (SOI quintile 5) and the top decile of standardized retail abnormal volume (SARV). Panel C shows the return spread on a long-short strategy that buys stocks in proportion to retail purchases and sells stocks in proportion to retail sales within each trade size bin. Abnormal returns are calculated as the intercept of the regression of the long-short return on the Fama- French five factor model plus a momentum factor. Blue (red) bars depict the cumulative alpha from the transaction on day t to the close of day t+1 (t+5).

Summary Statistics on Retail Trades Statistics are calculated across stock-day observations for stock-days with a minimum of 10 retail trades. # Buys (# Sells) counts each purchase (sale) as a single observation. $ Bought ($ Sold) counts each purchase (sale) as its dollar volume. # BSI ($ BSI) is the Buy Sell imbalance by number (value) of purchases and sales. Standardized order imbalance (SOI) is calculated as percentage of buys less the marketwide percent of buys for the day scaled by the standard deviation of percent buys (assuming a binomial distribution). Abnormal retail volume (ARV) is the ratio of number of retail trades on day t to the mean from t-45 to t-6. Standardized abnormal retail volume (SARV) is the number of retail trades standardized using the mean and standard deviation of retail trading in a 40-day window, t-45 to t-6. A minimum of 10 tradings with at least 10 retail trades in the 40-day window is required when computing standard deviation. 25th 75th N Mean Std.

    "text": "Table 9. Regression of Daily Return on Standardized Order Imbalance and Abnormal Retail Volume The dependent variable is the daily return (in bps) on a stock. Each column presents a regression where the dependent variable is the daily return on day t+1 in column (1) to the daily return on day t+5 in column (5). Retail order imbalance and retail trading activity in the stock are measured on day t. SOIq is an indicator t variables that take a value of one if the stock is in retail order imbalance quintile q, q=1,5 where quintile 1 contains the stocks most sold and quintile 5 contains the stocks most bought. We omit quintile 3 so coefficients represent variation relative to this omitted category. HiSARV is an indicator variable that takes a t value of one if the stock is in the top decile of abnormal retail volume on day t, which we interact with each of the five order imbalance indicators. Panel A summarizes regression coefficients. Panel B summarizes total return effects for the extreme order imbalance quintiles and high retail volume. Robust standard errors are clustered by day. t-statistics in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) VARIABLES Ret(t+1) Ret(t+2) Ret(t+3) Ret(t+4) Ret(t+5) Panel A.

For example, in our analysis of quintile portfolios formed on the basis of day t SOI quintiles we find no abnormal returns on days t+11 to t+21 (Table 3, Panel D). Similarly, we find no evidence of abnormal returns in purchase-weighted and sales-weighted portfolios on days t+11 to t+21 (Table 4, Panel D). However, prior evidence based on small trades from TAQ shows retail order imbalance measured at longer horizons negatively predicts returns (Hvidkjaer, 2008; Barber, Odean, and Zhu, 2008). To determine whether this result is robust during our sample period, we regress week t returns on lags of standardized weekly order imbalance (the weekly analogue of our daily SOI measure). To facilitate the interpretation of the regression coefficients, the SOI variables are standardized to have a zero mean and unit standard deviation. As control variables we include lags of weekly returns (to capture short-term reversals), longer horizon returns (to capture momentum effects), market cap, book-to-market ratios, and week fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by week to account for the cross-sectional correlation of returns. We summarize the results in Table A6 for all stocks and three firm size partitions (small, medium, and large). Consistent with the evidence in BJZZ (2020) and Barber, Odean, and Zhu (2008), we observe retail order imbalance reliably predict returns one week ahead primarily for small stocks. A one standard deviation increase on SOI in week t-1 predicts a week t return that is 2.0 bps higher for the average stock and 6.6 bps higher for the average small stock. In sharp contrast, the mean retail order imbalance observed in weeks t-5 to t-52 negatively predicts returns in week t. A one standard deviation increase in the mean SOI observed over these 48 weeks predicts a week t return that is 4.5 bps lower for the average stock and 17.6 bps lower for the average small stock. The bulk of our analysis in prior sections shows that despite the fact that daily retail order imbalance positively predicts returns over short horizons retail investors lose money by trading over the same horizon. The analysis in this section also indicates the short-term predictability of order imbalance reverses at longer horizons.
