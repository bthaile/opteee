    "text": "The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020 witnesses two significant changes in the U.S. stock market. First, large negative shocks brought by the pandemic significantly reduce market returns by 13.3% in March, while market uncertainty measured by VIX shot up from 18% to 83%, and market liquidity quickly worsens, with effective spread quadruples at the same time. Lessons from previous crisis periods show that the smooth functioning of the capital market during these difficult times is extremely important. Second, retail investors’ involvement in the U.S. stock market significantly increases after the pandemic starts. Here we identify the marketable retail order flow using the algorithm in Boehmer, Jones, Zhang and Zhang (2021, BJZZ hereafter), and find the monthly aggregate marketable retail trading volumes more than double from $325 billion in December of 2019 to $852 billion in September 2020, and remain high at around $700 billion for the next two years. Many attributes the rise of retail trading to the introduction of retail-oriented investing platforms with zero trading commissions, such as Robinhood, which attract young and unexperienced individual investors, with relatively little wealth but are incentivized to develop investing expertise by actually trading.1 Given the substantial negative shocks brought by pandemic, the significant surges in retail trading and the new mix of investors, do retail investors contribute positively towards price discovery, market volatility and liquidity, when these market qualities are the most needed? This question attracts significant attentions from all market participants, including researchers, practitioners, and regulators.2 1 According to Welch (2022), Robinhood investors triple their trading and account for 21% of the retail trading volume during the second quarter of 2020. Figure A1 of Bryzgalova et al. (2022) also shows that Robinhood takes around 20% of all brokerages’ payment for order flow from 2020 to 2021. 2 For instance, the chairman of the U.S. SEC, Gary Gensler, publicly expresses concerns regarding retail investors during his speech on May 5, 2021.

    "text": "Earlier works provide mixed theoretical predictions and empirical evidence for the above important question. Given the large volumes of existing work, we separate these studies into three broad groups. We refer to group I as the “pure noise retail investors hypothesis”. Classical papers, such as Black (1986), assume that pure noise traders have no information regarding firm value. If retail investors are pure noise traders, they can’t predict future price movements and can’t contribute to price discovery, yet their trading provides liquidity and improves market quality, as in Glosten and Milgrom (1985) and Kyle (1985). Group II contains works consistent with the “informed retail investors hypothesis”. Kelley and Tetlock (2013) find evidence that marketable retail investors are informed about future firm fundamentals and their trading shows return predictability. If retail investors are informed, their trades demand liquidity from other market participants, which would increase transaction costs, and reduce market quality. Group III is referred to as “uninformed retail investors hypothesis”. Studies in this group assume that the retail investors are uninformed about future firm fundamentals. However, the activities from these retail investors, through different channels, such as the attention channel from Da et al. (2011), and social media channel as in Pedersen (2022), still predict future prices movements. Notice that the three groups of hypotheses are actually not completely exclusive. In fact, group I and III have similar assumptions, and group II and III have overlapping empirical predictions. Below we provide a simple diagram to show the similarities and differences of the three groups of studies. Hypothesis Pure Noise Informed Uninformed Return Predictability No Predictability Yes and Positive Sign Yes and Positive Sign Market Quality Improve (+) Worsen (-) Unclear Before the pandemic, many empirical papers on retail investors provide mixed results supporting different hypotheses.

    "text": "Robinhood investors and still provide conflicting results.3 Given all these mixed previous findings, we believe the pandemic period and the increased participation of retail investors provide an ideal testing field for these hypotheses. That is, our study focuses on how retail investors in general, rather than only Robinhood investors, contribute to the price discovery process and market quality measures during the special period of pandemic. Specifically, we answer three research questions: how the new mix of retail investors contributes to price discovery and market quality; how other market participants, such as short-sellers and high frequency traders, respond to the increased retail trading; and finally, how these findings are related to the three groups of hypotheses. We start by investigating how retail order flows during this period are related to future stock price movements in the cross section. BJZZ examine the U.S. equity market between 2010 and 2015 and find that the signed marketable retail order flows, or retail order imbalances (buys minus sells), can predict future stock returns positively and significantly, indicating that retail marketable orders contain price-relevant information that is not yet incorporated into prices. After 2016, with the success of commission-free trading platforms, rise of social media as information gathering and distribution channels, and fierce competitions among trading venues, the overall trading environment has significantly changed. With the increased uncertainty and potential downward pressures brought by the pandemic, it is unclear whether overall retail order flow can still predict returns in the cross section. On the one hand, the retail traders might have increased savings from government salvage checks, and they might have more time and channels to acquire information than usual due to stay-at-home working practice and rising of social medias, which 3 In Appendix A, we provide a summary of empirical papers that are consistent with each of the hypothesis. For price discovery, Welch (2022) find Robinhood retail investors aggregate trading generates positive future returns; while Barber et al. (2022) show that Robinhood herding actually leads to negative abnormal returns. For market quality, Ozik et al. (2021) find that retail trading provide liquidity and reduce volatility during Covid lockdown; while Eaton et al. (2022) find that absence of Robinhood investors actually improve market liquidity and lower volatility. 3 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

On the other hand, the new entrants of retail investors, mostly Robinhood-type, are less experienced and more susceptible to trading biases, and might make suboptimal investment choices. Using a sample period between January 2020 and March 2022, we show that the more generally representative retail order imbalances still positively and significantly predict future daily returns in the cross section. Economically, an interquartile increase in retail order imbalance is associated with 3.90 bps of higher return for the next day (9.75% annualized), which is highly statistically significant. The predictive pattern persists for the next twelve weeks and is robust across firms with different sizes and different turnover ratios. That is, the higher uncertainty during pandemic and the arrival of more inexperienced retail investors do not diminish the positive predictive pattern of the general retail trading for future stock returns. This might not be too surprising because Robinhood investors only account for a small part of the general retail order flows. We next examine how retail order activities are related to future market quality measures, such as liquidity and volatility, in the cross section. Over our 2+ years of pandemic sample period, increases in overall retail trading activity (buys plus sells) are associated with significantly higher effective spreads and higher volatility in the future. An interquartile increase in retail general retail activity is associated with a 0.94 bps increase in effective spreads and a 0.64% increase in intraday volatility over the next day. The pattern extends over the next 12 weeks at least, indicating that retail activities generally demand future liquidity and generate more uncertainty. Given that more positive retail order imbalances predict higher future returns, and higher general retail trading volumes are associated with lower liquidity and higher volatility in the future, how do professional market participants trade in response?

    "text": "professional investors probably significantly differ from those to retail investors. Presumably, the environment of high volatility and low market liquidity during pandemic leads to decreasing funding liquidity, and it becomes more difficult for professional investors to acquire information with the quarantine practices and work-from-home routines. Here we focus on two groups of relatively sophisticated investors: high frequency traders (HFT) and short-sellers (SS). High frequency traders are generally believed to trade on arbitrage opportunities and are sensitive to short-term changes in prices and liquidity, while short-sellers are assumed to be informed pessimistic investors who collect and process information regarding future price movements. The general activity levels of retail investors are associated with significantly lower activity levels of both HFTs and SS’s. It is possible that increased trading by retail investors makes it harder for HFTs and SS’s to trade profitably, or the lower market quality associated with heightened retail trading activity makes it less attractive for HFTs and SS’s to trade. So far, our empirical results document three interesting patterns: retail trades predict future stock returns positively; retail trades lead to lower market liquidity and higher volatility; and high retail activity deters other market participants’ trading. These findings can be consistent with predictions from group II of “informed retail investors hypothesis” and group III of “uninformed retail investors hypothesis”, but not the predictions from group I of “pure noise retail investors hypothesis”. We further separate the “informed” and “uninformed” hypothesis, by using the retail attention measure in Da et al. (2011), which is widely adopted in the literature. We find that retail attention contributes to the short-term predictability for returns, but not the long-term predictability or earnings news. Rationally speaking, retail investors could be a combination of all three types of investors, pure noise traders, informed traders, and uninformed traders. Our results provide evidence that the latter two types probably dominate the first type in our sample. 5 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

    "text": "Our paper contributes to the debate on how retail investor trading contributes towards price discovery and market quality.4 As mentioned before, there have been many studies providing mixed theoretical predictions and empirical evidence. As for price discovery, while Kaniel et al. (2008), Kelley and Tetlock (2013), Barrort et al. (2016) and Boehmer et al. (2021) find retail order imbalances positively predict stock returns, some papers find retail trading lose money (Barber and Odean (2000, 2008)). Recent studies focus on Robinhood investors during the covid, but the results are still mixed: Welch (2022) show that the aggregated crowd consensus portfolio has good timing and good alpha, while Barber et al. (2022) find that Robinhood investors engage in more attention-induced trading and results in negative returns. As for market quality, for instance, among recent influential papers, though Barrot et al. (2016) and Ozik et al. (2021) find retail investors provide liquidity especially in volatile market, Eaton et al. (2022) show decreased Robinhood participation associated with higher market liquidity. In comparison with the existing studies, our paper examines the 2+ years of pandemic period and a much larger retail population, which provides a more general perspective on retail’s influences on price discovery and market quality during an important crisis period, and helps us possibly examine a more general nature of retail investors. Our main empirical findings, retail order flow positively predicts return, retail trading reduces liquidity, increases volatility and reduces sophisticated investors’ participation during pandemic, help to separate retail investors from pure noise traders. Our additional findings that retail order flows predict long-run returns and long-run earnings news help us to discover the informed retail investors. Overall, our study is the first to examine the more general nature of retail investors during the pandemic, to resolve the conflicts in previous studies and to provide more insights to all market participants. 4 We provide the detailed literature review in Appendix A. 6 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

Following existing literature, we collect trading data from TAQ and merge with stock returns and accounting data from CRSP and Compustat, respectively. We adopt the conventional filters by including only common stocks with share code 10 or 11 (which excludes mainly ETFs, ADRs, and REITs) that are listed on the NYSE, NYSE MKT (formerly the Amex), or NASDAQ, and removing low-priced stocks and guarantee a non-trivial minimum tick size by requiring the minimum stock price to be $1 on the previous trading day. For each day, we have an average of around 3,000 firms included in the sample. Overall, we have 1.9 million stock-day observations. We identify a large subset of marketable retail order flows in the U.S. following the BJZZ algorithm, which relies on the special subpenny setup in the U.S. stock market. That is, transactions with a retail investor tend to be executed off-exchange and reported on a TRF at prices that are just above or below a round penny due to the small price improvement given by the trade counterparty. For all trades reported to a FINRA TRF (exchange code “D” in TAQ), let P be it the transaction price for stock i at time t, and let Z ≡ 100 * mod(P , 0.01) be the fraction of a it it penny associated with that transaction price. Variable Z can take any value in the unit interval it [0,1). If Z is in the interval (0,0.4), we identify it as a retail sell transaction, because the transaction it price is just slightly above the round penny, which potentially is a small price improvement for the retail seller. If Z is in the interval (0.6,1), then the transaction is coded as a retail buy transaction, it because the transaction price is just slightly below the round penny, which potentially is a small 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

To be conservative, transactions at a round penny (Z = 0) it or near the half-penny (0.4 ≤ Z ≤ 0.6) are not assigned to the retail category.5 it To understand the aggregate magnitude and trend of marketable retail order flows in our sample period, we plot the time-series of aggregate retail trading in Figure I. Panel A presents the monthly aggregate retail trading volume, and Panel B presents the percentage of retail trading volume as a percentage of market total trading volume. Before pandemic, the monthly retail trading is slightly above $300 billion (with an annual total of $3.9 trillion) in 2019, and account for 9% of total market trading volume. After the Covid-19 outbreak in the U.S. in 2020, retail trading volume quickly increases to $629 billion for March 2020, and spikes in September 2020, reaching a total of $852 billion (14% of the total market trading volume).6 Other spikes in retail trading can be observed during the episode of GME of January 2021, and expectation of Ukraine War in late 2021. Given the large cross section of stocks in our sample, we are curious to understand whether retail trading increases in similar ways for firms with different market capitalizations. Therefore, we separate all sample firms into small, medium, and large size groups, using previous month-end market capitalization, and present the proportion of retail trading for these three groups over time in Panel C of Figure I. We find that the retail trading is much more important for smaller firms, for which retail’s proportion of total trading volume steadily increases from 15% to 23% over the 5 The BJZZ retail identification algorithm captures retail marketable orders, which normally are the more aggressive orders, while retail limited orders are excluded. According to the 606 filings by Charles Schwab, one of the largest retail brokers, limit orders account for 32% of all orders, and marketable orders account for more than half. From a cross validation test using Nasdaq data, the BJZZ algorithm matches the NASDAQ TRF’s correct buy/sell sign 98% of the time, which demonstrates its accuracy. It is worth noting that Barber et al. (2023) propose a method to refine BJZZ algorithm in signing the retail trades after 2015. We consider these modifications in Section 5.3. We show that results using the Barber et al. (2023) algorithm are quite similar to those using BJZZ algorithm. 6 The spike in September is possibly driven by momentum-trading oriented from market’s good performance during the past few months, the rising popularity of zero-commission platforms, the income surprise directed to equity market out of fiscal stimulus payments, and/or the Fed’s reaffirming indication to maintain a low target rate for a longer horizon, and SEC’s new amendment of retail protection from OTC market’s issuer ambiguity. 8 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

    "text": "pandemic period. For medium- and large-size firms, retail trading steadily accounts for around 10% of total trading volume. Overall, the time series of retail trading clearly shows two patterns: retail trading generally increases and remains high during pandemic period, and more so for smaller firms. With BJZZ algorithm, on each day t for each stock i, we define retail buy and sell volumes as “𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝐵𝑢𝑦𝑉𝑜𝑙 ” and “𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑙 ”. In this study, we measure retail activity from two 𝑖𝑡 𝑖𝑡 perspectives. First, we compute signed retail order imbalances measures, 𝑂𝑖𝑏𝑉𝑜𝑙 as follows: it 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝐵𝑢𝑦𝑉𝑜𝑙 −𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑙 𝑂𝑖𝑏𝑉𝑜𝑙 = 𝑖𝑡 𝑖𝑡. (1) it 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝐵𝑢𝑦𝑉𝑜𝑙 +𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑙 𝑖𝑡 𝑖𝑡 The order imbalance measures reflect net buy and sell directions for retail investors, and is mainly used for predicting directional changes in future stock prices. Second, we measure total activity of retail investors, by summing up both retail buys and sells and comparing with the total buys and sells from all investors for that stock (𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑙 ), as follows: 𝑖𝑡 𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝐵𝑢𝑦𝑉𝑜𝑙 +𝑅𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑙 𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑉𝑜𝑙 = 𝑖𝑡 𝑖𝑡. (2) it 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑉𝑜𝑙 𝑖𝑡 The total retail activity measures reflect activeness of retail investors, and we use them mostly for predicting market quality measures, such as liquidity and volatility, which are affected by both buys and sells rather than the net direction.7 Table I presents summary statistics on the retail order flows measures and other firm characteristics for our sample firms. We compute the mean, standard deviation, median, and 25th and 75th percentiles of the pooled stock-day sample of 1,920,323 observations. The retail order imbalance measure, OibVol, has a mean of -0.0208, and a standard deviation of 0.3967. The small magnitude of mean and relatively large standard error are consistent with previous literature, 7 We also consider using number of trades rather than share volumes in equation (1) and (2).

For the retail activity measure, ActVol, the mean is 0.0904 with a standard deviation of 0.1002. That is, for an average stock on an average day, the retail investors using marketable orders contribute around 9% to the total trading activities, which is sizable. To capture how these measures fluctuate over time, we report the cross-sectional distribution of marketable retail order imbalances in Figure II Panel A. The time-series of the mean, 25th percentile, the median, and the 75th percentile of OibVol is quite stable over time, except that there is a clear dip in March 2020 due to selling pressures for large market downturns. For the activity variable in Panels B, most time-series don’t display time trend or structural break. We notice a pattern of quarterly dips in the ActVol measures, which coincides with the quarterly witching days. It’s likely that institutions rebalance significantly around these days, and the relative importance of retail investors drop accordingly. For our main empirical results, we connect the retail trades future stock returns, liquidity and volatility, and trading from other market participant, and below we explain how we construct these measures in details. For returns, Blume and Stambaugh (1983) find that daily returns computed from end-of-day closing prices can generate an upward bias, due to bid-ask bounce, and recommend to use end-of-day bid-ask average prices to compute daily returns. Therefore, our study uses daily returns computed from end-of-day bid-ask average prices. Previous studies use many alternative liquidity measures, such as percentage effective spread, quoted spread, price impact and realized spreads. Given that trades can happen within the quoted bid and ask prices, the percentage effective spread is more precise and we choose it as our main liquidity measure (denoted as effective spread hereafter). Results using alternative measures are similar and available on request.

Higher effective spreads indicate lower liquidity. Our data on effective spread is obtained from WRDS Intraday Indicators, which utilizes intra-day trades and quotes data from TAQ, and applies filters and adjustments as in Holden and Jacobsen (2014). For volatility, we follow Van Kervel and Menkveld (2019) and Boehmer, Fong, and Wu (2021) and adopt the algorithm in Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold, and Ebens (2001). The annualized intraday volatility measure for stock i on day t is defined as 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑉𝑜𝑙 = 𝑖,𝑡 2 √250∑𝑇 (𝑅𝑒𝑡 ) , which is the square root of the sum of squared end-of-minute returns, 𝑚=1 𝑖,𝑚 𝑃 𝑅𝑒𝑡 = 𝐿𝑛 𝑖,𝑚 . Here m refers to minute, T is the number of minutes that stock i trades on day 𝑖,𝑚 𝑃 𝑖,𝑚−1 t, and we assume there are 250 trading days in one year. We obtain high frequency trading data from WRDS SEC MIDAS. Hendershott, Jones, and Menkveld (2011), Hasbrouck and Saar (2013) and Weller (2018), propose that both “cancel to trade ratio” and “order to trade ratio” are valid proxies for high frequency trading. Since the two measures have a correlation of 0.80 in our sample, we mainly present results on “cancel to trade ratio”. To be more specific, 𝐻𝐹𝑇𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑙 , the cancel to trade ratio, is calculated as the logarithm 𝑖,𝑡 of the number of full or partial cancellations divided by numbers of trades. Since high frequency traders tend to first place many orders to measure the depth of the market and then cancel them, higher cancel-to-trade ratios indicate higher level of activities from high frequency traders. 11 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

Our main results use the days-to-cover-ratio, as proposed by Hong, Li, Ni, Sheinkman, and Yan (2016), which is a standard measure capturing information from both supply and demand sides of equity loans. We compute shorts’ days-to-cover-ratio, 𝑆𝐷𝑇𝐶𝑅 , as the total number of shares on loan scaled by the daily 𝑖,𝑡 trading volume. High SDTCR indicates more shares on loan, and high activity by short-sellers. Results using alternative measures, such as short supply and short flow, are available on request. The summary statistics in Table I provide mean and standard deviations for all key variables. To illustrate the cross-sectional pattern over time, we also plot their cross-sectional distributions in Figure II, Panels C to F, where we present the cross-sectional means, p25 (the 25th percentile), p50 (the 50th percentile), and p75 (the 75th percentile) for each day. In Panel C, the EffSpd is expressed in % and it spikes drastically from around 0.4% to over 1% in March 2020, and remains high until May 2020, which reflects the quick and lasting dry-up of stock market liquidity at the outbreak of the pandemic. For GME episode in 2021 and Ukraine War in 2022, we observe similar but relative smaller spikes in effective spread. We present time-series of volatility in Panel D, and observe a sharp increase of IntVol during March and April of 2020. Volatilities are relatively higher around the GME episode and Ukraine War. For the high frequency cancel-to- order ratio in Panel E and shorting days-to-cover ratio in Panel F, the cross-sectional distributions are relative stable over time and there is no obvious time trend. 2.2 Empirical Method Our study aims to understanding how retail trades predict future movements in stocks prices, liquidity, volatility and activities from other market participants.

To be more specific, for predicting returns, we adopt the standard two-stage Fama- MacBeth (1973) regression approach, similar to the one in Kelley and Tetlock (2013).

(3) Here the dependent variable 𝑌(𝑖,𝑡+1) refers to returns of stock i at time t+1, and the independent variable, 𝑂𝑖𝑏𝑉𝑜𝑙(𝑖,𝑡), refers to retail order imbalance measures at time t. We obtain the time- series of parameter estimates {𝑎0(𝑡+1),𝑎1(𝑡+1),𝑎2(𝑡+1)′} from the cross-sectional regressions, and conduct inferences on the mean and standard errors of these parameter estimates, while the standard errors are adjusted using Newey-West (1987) approach with five lags for daily regressions.9 If retail trading can predict future returns in the correct direction, we expect a significant and positive coefficient of 𝑎1, the time-series average of 𝑎1(𝑡+1). For predicting liquidity, volatility, HFT and SS measures, we follow the panel set up as in Eaton et al. (2022): 𝑌(𝑖,𝑡+1) = 𝑏0+𝑏1∗𝐴𝑐𝑡𝑉𝑜𝑙(𝑖,𝑡)+𝑏2′𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙𝑠(𝑖,𝑡)+𝛾 +𝑢2(𝑖,𝑡+1). (4) 𝑡 8 The auto-correlation coefficients, AR(1), for effective spread, intraday volatility, cancel to trade ratio and days-to- cover-ratio are 0.86, 0.81, 0.70, and 0.80 respectively. 9 The number of lags equals to five following Newey and West (1987), where we use integer [𝑇1/4+1.5] to calculate the optimal bandwidth parameter with number of days in our sample T=567. Our results are robust if we use other algorithms to compute the optimal lag. 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

To control for firm effect, we directly include lagged depending variables to simultaneously capture the firm level effect and allow for time-series dynamics.

We follow existing studies to select control variables that can potentially affect future stock prices, liquidity, volatility and other measures. Our control variables include the following: the log market capitalization from the previous month, Lsize; log book-to-market ratio at the most recent quarter end, Lbm; last month’s consolidated trading volume as a fraction of outstanding shares Lturnover, and the previous month’s daily return volatility following Ang, Hodrick, Xing, and Zhang (2006), Lmvol. We also include the lag of the dependent variables as controls. In the case of return prediction, we include previous day’s return, Ret(t), the return over the past week Ret(w- 1), and the return over the past month Ret(m-1). For the other cases, we include lagged dependent variables as controls, and decide the lag length by AIC and SIC. The summary statistics of the control variables are presented in Table I, and they are consistent with previous literature.

    "text": "There is no consensus on whether retail trading can predict future stock returns. As discussed in the introduction, studies assuming “pure noise retail investors” argue retail trades cannot predict future returns, while studies assuming either “informed retail investors” or “uninformed retail investors” argue the opposite. To examine whether retail investors can predict future price movement during the pandemic period, we first use retail order imbalance to predict next day return, as in equation (3), and report the estimation results Table II Panel A. The coefficient on OibVol is 0.0010, with a t-statistic of 9.85. The positive and significant coefficient indicates that, if retail investors buy more than they sell on a given day, the return on that stock on the next day is significantly higher. For economic magnitude, given that the daily interquartile of OibVol is 0.3902, so when we move from the 25th to the 75th percentile in the cross section of OibVol, the daily return increases by 0.3902*0.0010 = 3.90bps (3.90*250=9.75% annualized). We compare the magnitude with the results in BJZZ, with the interquartile weekly return difference being 0.1089% (0.1089%*52=5.67% annualized). These magnitudes are comparable, and the magnitude is even larger during pandemic than for the period of 2010-2015. That is, previous day marketable retail order imbalances significantly predict next-day stock price movements in the correct direction. For the control variables, we observe negative and significant coefficients on the previous day and previous week’s return, which indicate daily as well as weekly return reversals. The coefficient on previous month return is insignificant. Size, book-to-market, turnover, and volatility all carry the expected signs, and most are not statistically significant. This confirms that the predictability we find is not a manifestation of size, book-to-market, turnover, or 15 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

Given the strong positive predictive pattern of retail order imbalance for next day return, it is natural to ask whether the predictive power persists over longer horizons. If the predictive pattern quickly disappears or reverses, retail investors may be capturing short-term information or driven by temporary fads; if the predictive pattern persists, then retail order imbalance might contain longer term information, such as firm fundamentals. Therefore, we extend equation (3) to the next 12 weeks. That is, we use retail order imbalance measures, 𝑂𝑖𝑏𝑉𝑜𝑙(𝑖,𝑡), to predict cumulative returns over the next k weeks, 𝑅𝑒𝑡(𝑖,𝑤 +𝑘), with k=1 to 12. To be specific, for k=1, 𝑅𝑒𝑡(𝑖,𝑤 + 1) is the cumulative return over days t+1 to t+5; for k=12, 𝑅𝑒𝑡(𝑖,𝑤 +12) is the cumulative return over days t+1 to t+60. We do not scale the cumulative return by the number of days involved, but to directly use the buy-and-hold return over a given future horizon. If marketable retail order imbalances have only short-lived predictive power for future returns, the coefficient a1 would decrease to zero quickly. Alternatively, if the marketable retail order imbalance has longer predictive power, the coefficient a1 should remain positive for a long period. We report the results in Panel B of Table II. The dependent variable is cumulative returns over the next k weeks, without scaling by the number of days. When the estimation horizon is extended from one to 12 weeks, the coefficient on OibVol gradually increases from 0.0016 to 0.0057. The first week annualized interquartile return difference is 5.67% in BJZZ, and is 3.25% (=0.0016*52weeks*interquartile of 0.3902) in this study, with a smaller but comparable magnitude during the pandemic. When we extend the window to 12 weeks, the coefficients gradually increase with no reversal, which is quite similar to the findings in BJZZ.

    "text": "of the retail order imbalances persists for multiple weeks, they potentially capture longer-term information.10 11 The general finding of retail order flow positively predicting next day and next 12 weeks of returns doesn’t support the “pure noise retail investor hypothesis”, but is consistent with the other two hypotheses. This finding might be surprising to readers who have been paying attention to Robinhood investors, and their lack of trading experiences. Even though Robinhood investors attract substantial attention from media and regulators, according to Welch (2022) and Bryzgalova et al. (2022), they still only account for around 20% of the total retail order flows at the outbreak of the pandemic, and probably cannot overturn the empirical pattern that the more general retail flow has return predictability. Earlier studies, such as Da et al. (2011), Kelley and Tetlock (2013), and BJZZ, all find that retail order imbalance has strong positive predictive power for future returns. Both Kelley and Tetlock (2013) and BJZZ provide evidence that retail orders might contain relevant information regarding firm fundamentals. However, the predictive pattern doesn’t necessarily mean that retail investors possess some private information or have advantages in information processing. For instance, Da et al. (2011) shows that retail attention-driven trades, rather than information-driven trades, can still predict future returns, but the predictive pattern would reverse over the longer term. We provide more discussions for these economic hypotheses in later section. 10 The BJZZ algorithm is based on the pay-for-order-flow (PFOF) practice, where wholesalers offer price improvement to retail investors to obtain their order flows. Readers might be concerned that if retail flows predict return positively, the counter-party would potentially lose money. BJZZ offers an economic explanation for why wholesalers would still like to pay for retail order flows on page 2299. In short, as long as the information content of marketable retail order flow is less than the bid-ask spread being charged, internalizers and wholesalers can still earn positive revenues by trading with these retail orders. 11 We follow Barber, Lee, Liu, and Odean (2009)’s method to calculate the retail investors gain/loss over the sample period. That is, if we form net buy and sell portfolios based on retail order flow and assume a holding period of 140 days, the daily gain from this strategy is 0.45 million, or 257 million over our sample period. 17 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

    "text": "How the activity of retail investors associates with future firm level liquidity and volatility? The “pure noise” hypothesis predicts that pure noise retail investors would provide liquidity to the market and reduce volatility, while informed and uninformed retail investor hypotheses suggest that predict retail flows probably would decrease market liquidity and increase volatility, which is actually consistent with inventory risk models, such as Ho and Stoll (1981) and Hendershott and Menkveld (2014), that market maker bears non-diversifiable inventory risk from retail trading, and retail trading lowers market liquidity. In this section, we examine how retail activities are associated with future liquidity and volatility in the cross section. We estimate equation (4) in the panel setting, with the Y(𝑖,𝑡+1) variable being 𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑆𝑝𝑑(𝑖,𝑡+1) or 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑉𝑜𝑙(𝑖,𝑡+1) , proxying for liquidity or volatility, respectively.12 In terms of liquidity, if retail investors provide liquidity to the market, then higher retail activity would be associated with lower effective spread in the future, and the coefficient b1 would be significantly negative, and vice versa. Similarly, if retail trading stabilizes the market, we expect that higher retail activity is associated with lower volatility for the future, and coefficient b1 would be significantly negative, and vice versa. We report the estimation results in Table III Panel A. In regression I, when we use ActVol to predict future effective spread, the coefficient on ActVol is 0.1017, with a significant t-statistic of 10.22. In terms of economic magnitude, given that the daily interquartile of ActVol is 0.0929, when we move from the 25th to the 75th percentile in the cross section of ActVol, the daily effective spread increases by 0.0929*0.1017 = 0.0094 percent or 0.94 bps, which is sizeable, given that the median effective spread is 16 bps for our sample in Table I.

    "text": "more activities from retail investors are associated with higher effective spread, or lower liquidity on the next day. When we use our retail trading measures to predict next-day stock intraday volatility in regression II, similar pattern emerges. The coefficient on ActVol is 0.0690, with a t-statistic of 5.46. Economically, an interquartile movement for ActVol (0.0929) is associated with an increase of intraday volatility of 0.0929*0.0690 = 0.0064 or 64 bps. The positive and significant coefficient shows that, if more activities from retail investors on a given day, the next day intraday volatility for that stock would significantly increase. These two regressions show that high retail activities reduce the liquidity and increase volatility in the market. Do these daily positive predictive patterns persist in the long run? If the positive coefficients quickly reverse or diminish to zero, then retail investors’ trading activity only has temporary prediction for market quality; if the positive coefficients continue to be significant over longer horizons, then the retail investors’ trades predict the market in a lasting way. To examine this issue, we replace the dependent variables in equation (4) from next-day market quality measures to average weekly market quality measures for the next 12 weeks. We report the results in Table III Panel B. In the first column, we predict future liquidity for the next one to 12 weeks using ActVol. The coefficients gradually decrease from 0.0810 to 0.00612 at the 12th week, while the t-statistics remain highly significant for all weeks, indicating that ActVol has long-lasting positive predictive power for future liquidity. In the second column, we use ActVol to predict future intraday volatility. The pattern is quite similar to those in column I. That is, ActVol have lasting positive predictive power for future volatilities. Overall, retail investors’ activities are significantly and positively associated with future illiquidity and uncertainties, over short or long horizons. These findings are generally consistent 19 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

Given the rise of retail investors during the pandemic, how are their activities associated with the behavior of other participants? In this section, we focus on two important subsets of institutional investors, the high-frequency-traders and short-sellers, who tend to be quite sensitive towards the price informativeness and market quality conditions. There are competing hypotheses regarding high frequency traders and short- sellers. On the one hand, as high frequency traders are believed to trade on arbitrage opportunities (Hendershott et al. 2011), and short sellers are assumed to be informed investors (Boehmer et al. 2008), they might increase their trading when “pure noise” retail trading contains profitable arbitrage opportunities (Barber et al. 2022). On the other hand, if retail flows have return predictability and their trades are associated with low liquidity and high volatility, then it would be hard for high frequency traders and short-sellers to trade profitably when retail investors are active. Results from previous sections show that retail flows can predict future returns, and they lower market quality measures, so the second hypothesis might be closer to the data. To understand how retail order flows and overall activities are related to next day activities from HFTs and short-sellers, we estimate our benchmark regression in equation (4), with the dependent variables being HFTCancel for high frequency trading, and SDTCR to for short-selling. We report the estimation results in Table IV. We first investigate how retail trading is related to next day HFT and short-selling in Panel A. In column I, when we predict next day HFTCancel with ActVol, the coefficient is -0.2300 with a t-statistic of -17.12. The negative and significant coefficient implies that high retail activities are associated with lower activities from high 20 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

Economically, an interquartile change in ActVol lead to a decrease in HFTCancel by -0.0214. From the summary statistics in Table I, the mean of HFTCancel is 2.98, and this change seems small. But if we consider that the standard deviation is only 0.51 for this variable, then the magnitude difference generated by ActVol is still economically meaningful. In column II on Panel A, when we use ActVol to predict next day short selling, the coefficient is -1.1141 with a t-statistic of -12.28. An interquartile movement of ActVol is associated with a decrease of -0.1035, in SDTCR. Table I shows that the mean of SDTCR is 4.26 days, and a decrease of -0.1035 accounts for -0.1035/4.26 = -2.43% decrease in shorting activity. Similar to HFT result, when retail investors trading more on a given day, there is less shorting of that stock the next day. Do these negative coefficients last for the longer term? We present the long term predictions in Panel B, where we replace the dependent variables in equation (4) from one day ahead measures to weekly average measures for the next 12 weeks. In the first column, where we predict future HFT cancel ratios for the next one to 12 weeks, the coefficient on ActVol gradually decreases from -0.1002 at the 1st week to -0.0756 at the 12th week, and the t-statistics remain highly significant for all weeks. In the second column, we use retail activities to predict future short selling, and the coefficients of ActVol are always negative and significant, with slowly decreasing magnitude. To summarize, higher retail trading is associated with lower participation of both high frequency traders and short-sellers, over short and long horizons.

Economic Interpretation: Informed vs. Uninformed Retail Investors Results in Section 3 show that retail flows have significant return predictability, contribute to lower market quality and reduce market participations from HFT and SS, which are consistent with both “informed retail hypothesis” and “uninformed retail hypothesis”. In this section, we conduct more tests to figure out which hypothesis is closer to the data. As mentioned in the introduction, the “uninformed” retail investors can affect price dynamics through different channels. Here we focus on the well-studied retail attention channel, as in Da et al. (2011) study. For instance, the recent study by Barber et al. (2022) finds Robinhood investors engage in more attention-induced trading than other retail investors. In terms of return predictability, Da et al. (2011) show that an increase in retail attention predicts higher return for the short term, but not the long term for over 52 weeks, because retail attention doesn’t contain firm fundamental information. In contrast, the “informed retail investor hypothesis” indicates that retail order flow contains firm fundamental information, and it can predict return both short term and long term. Therefore, we separate the “uninformed retail investors hypothesis” and “informed retail investors hypothesis” in three steps: 1) we compare their short-term predictions for returns, and both would indicate positive and significant predictions; 2) we compare their long-term predictions for returns over the next 52 weeks, and “uninformed” hypothesis indicates a reversal, while “informed” wouldn’t; 3) we compare their predictions for firm fundamentals, measured by earnings surprises, where “informed” hypothesis indicates predictability, while “uninformed” wouldn’t. We follow Da et al. (2011) and proxy retail attention by Google search volume index (SVI). To capture the changes in retail attention, we compute ASVI as in the original study, which is the 22 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

Interestingly, the correlation between our retail order flow measures OibVol and the attention proxy ASVI is 0.012, and the correlation between ActVol and ASVI is 0.035. The positive coefficients suggest that the attention and the order flow move in the same direction, while the low correlations indicate that they probably contain different information. We present the results for short-term return prediction in Table V Panel A. In the first specification, we replicate the results from Table II, where OibVol predicts next day return with a significant coefficient of 0.0010, and the interquartile return is 4 bps per day. In specification II, we use ASVI to predict next day return, and obtain a highly significant coefficient of 0.0042, which implies a higher interquartile return of 9 bps per day. In the last specification, we include both OibVol and ASVI, and results are quite similar to those in the first two specifications, possibly because these two variables have low correlations. That is, both OibVol and ASVI have significant short-term return predictability, and ASVI’s predictive power is stronger than OibVol. Meanwhile, these coefficients on these two variables barely change when they are included together, suggesting the predictive information contained in these two variables probably are different. Next we extend the prediction horizon from one day to the next 52 weeks and present the results in Panel B of Table V. In the first column, we use retail order flows OibVol to predict long- run cumulative returns, and the coefficient on OibVol monotonically increases from 0.0037 to 0.0211 and remains significant, implying that the predictive power of OibVol doesn’t reverse over longer horizon. In the second specification, where we use retail attention ASVI to predict return in the long run, the coefficient on ASVI starts to decay after the 24th week, with coefficients decreasing from 0.0138 (week 20) to 0.0116 (week 24), and it becomes insignificant and close-to- zero at the 28th week. This long-run reversal pattern of ASVI is consistent with Da et al. (2011). 23 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

    "text": "The reversal in return predictability of retail attention and the non-reversal of retail order flows together suggest that OibVol’s predictive power for the long run is not driven by retail attention. For the third step, we directly examine whether retail order flow and attention can predict the firm fundamentals measured by earnings news. Following Kelley and Tetlock (2013), we use cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) over earnings announcement periods to estimate earnings news, where the abnormal returns are the returns in excess of expected return using the market model. To observe potential decay in the predictive power of the independent variables, we provide results over 2-day, 60-day and 250-day horizons in Panel C of Table V. We find that the OibVol always positively predicts future CAR, while the significance becomes stronger over longer horizons. This finding suggests that possibly the long-term return predictability of OibVol is related to firm fundamentals, consistent with the “informed retail investor hypothesis”. Interestingly, the ASVI also always positively predicts future CAR, yet the significance and magnitude decreases when the horizons become longer. This confirms finding in Da et al. (2011) that ASVI probably don’t contain much information on firm fundamentals. We also examine how attention is related to market quality and market participation measures and compare the patterns with those of retail order flow, and report the results in Panel D of Table V. For the effective spread in the specification I, it is quite interesting to find that the coefficient on ActVol is 0.1076 (t-stat=10.69), while the coefficient on ASVI is -0.0043 (t-stat=- 6.61). That is, higher retail activity reduces liquidity and raises effective spread, while the higher retail attention actually provides liquidity and leads to lower effective spread. It is possible that retail attention doesn’t contain true value-relevant information, and thus provides liquidity to the market. We present results on volatility, HFT and short-selling in the rest of the panel. Basically, 24 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

    "text": "higher ActVol and ASVI both lead to higher volatility, lower HFT activity and short-selling activity, all with statistical significances. To summarize, we find evidence that retail attention has significant short-term return predictability, which supports the “uninformed retail investor hypothesis”. But, the retail order flow has both short- and long-term return predictability, which is more consistent with the “informed retail investor hypothesis”. We also provide evidence that retail order flow contains more information regarding firm earnings news than retail attention over longer term. For volatility measures and market participation measures, both retail flow and retail attention deliver results in the same direction, while the former has large magnitudes. As mentioned in the introduction, retail investors could be a combination of all three types of investors, pure noise traders, informed traders, and uninformed traders. Our results in this section provide evidence that the latter two types probably dominate the first type in our sample. 5. Robustness 5.1 Days with High Uncertainty The 27 months in our sample are quite eventful. The initial shock of the outbreak of COVID-19 in spring of 2020 is substantial, and the capital market quickly reacts with large negative returns, together with surges in market illiquidity and volatility. Presumably, the arrival of the pandemic contains systematic negative news, and affects the fundamentals of the economy. The VIX index, an indicator or the market implied volatility, increases from lower than 20% in January 2020 to 82% in March 2022. Do retail investors trade differently during times of high uncertainty? Barrot et al. (2016) find that the return predictability of retail order imbalances is significantly higher during times of market stress indicated by VIX, and offer an explanation that retail investors provide liquidity during these volatile times and are compensated.

    "text": "whether this interpretation also works out in our sample, we divide our sample period into high- VIX days and low-VIX days based on the 75th percentile during our sample period. We define an indicator variable, DVIX, which takes the value of 1 when the day’s VIX index is above the sample’s 75th percentile, and 0 otherwise. The empirical results using DVIX are reported in Panel A of Table VI. In regression I, the average retail coefficient is 0.0008 with a highly significant t-stat of 7.92, and the coefficient on DVIX is 0.0007 with a significant t-stat of 3.65, indicating that during period with higher VIX, the predictive coefficient becomes 0.0015 (0.0008+0.0007), much higher than other days, which is consistent with Barrot et al. (2016). For regression II, in which retail flows are used to predict future effective spread, the average retail coefficient is 0.0576 and significant, and the coefficient on DVIX is 0.1860 with t-stat of 6.50, which is consistent with our earlier results that retail investors demand liquidity during the pandemic, but inconsistent with Barrot el al.’s explanation. Similar patterns are observed for volatility prediction. For HFT activities, the patterns are interestingly different. On low-VIX days, the coefficient is -0.2599 (t-stat=-18.35), indicating higher retail activities are associated with lower activities from HFT. On high-VIX days, the coefficient on the interaction is 0.1227 (t-stat=3.94), meaning that even though the overall impact (-0.2599+0.1227=-0.1372) is still negative, the magnitude becomes significantly smaller. That is HFT seems to be more active on high VIX days, possibly because there are more arbitrage opportunities on these days. We find similar results for SS.13 5.2 Firms with Different Characteristics 13 In Appendix Table A.1, we further capture the influence of retail investors during three distinct events: the outbreak of Covid, the episode of GME (GameStop), and the Ukraine war. We find that during the GME period, presumably less sophisticated retail investors join the market which tend to provide liquidity and increase volatility, consistent with the findings in Hu et al.

    "text": "Our sample includes on average more than 3,000 firms each day. Is the predictive power of marketable retail order imbalances driven by particular subsets of firm? Do retail investors have preferences for trading particular subsets of firms during the pandemic? We investigate these questions by analyzing various firm subgroups in this section. That is, we first sort all firms into groups based on firm characteristics and define group dummies, and we estimate equation (3) and (4) with interactions with group dummies. We then present the coefficient on the retail measures within each group and compare their magnitudes. Here we consider two essential firm characteristics, market capitalization and turnover. From Table VI Panel B, we first separate firms by size or previous month turnover. Moving from the smallest size (or lowest liquidity) one-third of firms to the largest size (or the highest liquidity), the coefficient on OibVol decreases from 0.0013 to 0.0007 (or increases from 0.0006 to 0.0025), while both statistically significant. Clearly, the predictive power of marketable retail order imbalances is much stronger for smaller and more liquid firms than for larger and less liquid firms, but the predictability remains reliably present in all three groups. Results for effective spread, intraday volatility, HFT and SS presented in the rest of the table are similar to earlier findings.14 We are particularly interested in a small set of stocks, the Robinhood 50, which include 50 stocks that were restricted by Robinhood from users taking long or option positions for a period of time.15 It is generally believed that stocks on Robinhood 50 list are the most affected stocks by retail trades. We define a Robinhood 50 indicator variable, DRH50, which takes the value of 1 if the stock belongs to Robinhood 50 list, and zero otherwise. We interact the DRH50 with the retail measures for their predictive power for future variables. In Table VI Panel B, we present the 14 Appendix Table A.2 further provides robust subgroup results when sorting stocks by size using NYSE breakpoint rather than all stocks’ breakpoint. 15 A list of Robinhood 50 stocks is provided in Appendix B. 27 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

    "text": "predictive coefficients for the retail measures for the Robinhood 50 stocks and other stocks. The coefficients of all other stocks are similar to those we observed in earlier sections. For Robinhood 50 stocks, it’s interesting to find in the first column the coefficient on OibVol is 0.0169, which is much larger than 0.0010 for non-Robinhood 50 stocks, implying the retail order imbalance has a much larger predictive power on these stocks. There is a significant positive prediction for effective spread in column II, indicating that for the Robinhood 50 stocks, retail activities still demand liquidity, consistent with Eaton et al. (2022). In column III, the coefficient on ActVol is 0.1834 for Robinhood 50 stocks, which is significantly larger than 0.0671 for other stocks, suggesting that retail trading on these stocks potentially bring more uncertainty. 5.3 An Alternative Retail Identification Algorithm Our main results use the BJZZ algorithm to identify retail investors. Barber et al. (2023) propose alternative algorithms to identify retail trades or retail buy/sell from TAQ. To make sure our main results are robust to alternative retail measures, here we adopt the Barber et al. (2023)’s algorithm to identify retail trades and buy/sell direction, and re-examine our main results.16 In Table VI Panel C and Panel D, we use the reidentified retail activity measures to predict future next-day and long-run dependent variables. In Panel C, when we use the alternative retail order imbalances to predict return in regression I, the coefficient on OibVol is significantly positive, being 0.0016 with a t-statistic of 11.83, consistent with the result in Table II Panel A where OibVol identified using BJZZ algorithm is with a coefficient of 0.0010. Given that the daily interquartile of the reidentified OibVol is 0.3478, similar to the BJZZ algorithm’s interquartile of 0.3902, the economic magnitude of daily return difference when we move from the 25th to the 75th percentile in the cross section of OibVol is 0.3478*0.0016 = 5.64bps, comparable to the interquartile return 16 Details on Barber et al.

We also use the reidentified daily retail activity measure ActVol to predict next day effective spread, intraday volatility, cancel-to-trade ratio and DTCR in regression II to V, and the results are similar with those in Table III and IV. Panel D presents daily alternative retail activity measures predicting long-run measures, which is still consistent with our previous results from Table II to Table IV. Overall, our main results are robust to the alternative identification of retail activity measures proposed by Barber et al. (2023).17 5.4 Weekly and Intraday Horizons Our main results are based on daily data. In this subsection, we conduct robustness checks with weekly and intraday data. In Table VI Panel E, we use weekly retail activity to predict next week dependent variable. These results are quite similar to those using daily data. For instance, when we predict future return in regression I, the weekly OibVol has a significant coefficient of 0.0008 with a t-stat of 4.68, consistent with the daily result in Table II where the daily OibVol’s coefficient is 0.0010. We present intraday prediction results in Table VI Panel F. We divide the trading day into 13 intervals, starting from 09:30am to 16:00pm, with each interval 30 minutes.18 Then we use intraday retail activities to predict next 30-min dependent variables. These intraday results are also similar to those using daily data. For instance, in regression I for predicting returns, intraday OibVol can all positively and significantly predict the next half-hour of stock returns, with only one insignificance for the last interval (15:00-15:30). Taking the first interval as an example, 09:30-10:00 interval OibVol can significantly positively predict the next half-hour of stock return with a coefficient of 0.000120 and a t-statistic of 6.76. For intraday liquidity and volatility, in 17 Furthermore, we also consider alternative scaling methods when calculating scaled retail order imbalances. As is shown in Appendix Table A.3, our main result of positive return predictability still holds when scaling retail order imbalances by total trading volume or shares outstanding instead of retail trading volume. 18 We present the each 30-minutes trading patterns in Figure A.1., which display a U-shape throughout the day. 29 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

Conclusions Using the BJZZ subpenny transaction prices algorithm, we identify the marketable retail investors’ orders in the U.S. market between January 2020 and March 2022. During the pandemic period, our measure of retail trading volumes more than doubles from $325 billion in December of 2019 to $852 billion in September 2020. With the heightened retail activity, retail order imbalances significantly and positively predict returns for next day and for the next twelve weeks in the cross-section. In terms of future liquidity and volatility, higher retail activities are associated worse market qualities, measured by wider future effective spreads, greater future volatilities, along with significantly lower activities from high frequency traders and short-sellers. Previous literature provides three broad types of hypotheses for retail investors trading: pure noise, informed and uninformed retail investors. It is possible that the retail population is a mix of all three types of investors. These above predictive patterns we document during the pandemic period are not consistent with the pure noise hypothesis, but can be consistent with both informed and uninformed retail investors hypotheses. We conduct further tests on the latter two hypotheses, and find that the attention-driven retail has short-term predictability, while informed retail has both short- and long-term predictability for returns and firm level fundamental information. Given the rising of retail-oriented investing platforms with zero trading commissions, and retail investors trading’s impact on price discovery, market quality, and other market participants 19 Since intraday data on HFT and short-selling is unavailable, we don’t provide intraday analysis for HFT and short- selling. 30 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

Summary Statistics This table reports pool summary statistics for retail investor trading and stock characteristics. Our sample period is January 2020 to March 2022, and our sample firms are all common stocks listed on U.S. stock exchanges with a share price of at least $1. For retail trading, we report the retail order imbalance measure (OibVol) as defined in equation (1), and the percentage of retail share volume over total share volume (ActVol) as defined in equation (2). For liquidity and volatility, we report effective spread (EffSpr(%)), and annualized intraday volatility (IntVol). For high frequency trading, we report the cancel to trade ratio (HFTCancel). For short selling, we report the days to cover ratio (SDTCR). For stock characteristics, we report daily stock return (Ret) in percentage, market capitalization (Size) in billions, book to market ratio (Lbm), monthly stock turnover (Lturnover) and monthly return volatility (Lmvol). The return is computed using bid-ask average prices.

Retail Trading vs. Future Stock Returns This table reports results on whether marketable retail investor order imbalance can predict future stock returns from one day to 12 weeks. Our sample period is January 2020 to March 2022, and our sample firms are all common stocks listed on U.S. stock exchanges with a share price of at least $1. We estimate the Fama-MacBeth regressions, as specified in equation (3). The dependent variable is the next day return in Panel A, and cumulative k-weeks ahead return in Panel B. The returns are computed using the end-of-day bid-ask average price. The independent variables are scaled marketable retail order imbalance measures, OibVol, as defined in equation (1). Control variables include previous day return, Ret(t), previous week return, Ret(w-1), previous month return, Ret(m-1), log market capitalization, Lsize, book to market ratio, Lbm, monthly stock turnover, Lturnover, and monthly return volatility Lmvol.

Our sample period is January 2020 to March 2022, and our sample firms are all common stocks listed on U.S. stock exchanges with a share price of at least $1. We focus on the abnormal Google search volume index (ASVI), from Da et al. (2011), which is defined as the log SVI during the current week minus the log median SVI during the previous eight weeks. Panel A examines whether attention (ASVI) and retail order flow (OibVol) could predict next-day return. Panel B extends the dependent variable to future cumulative returns over the next k-weeks and examine whether attention (ASVI) and retail order flow (OibVol) could predict return for the next 4 to 52 weeks. Panel C examines whether attention and retail order imbalances could predict earnings announcement CAR over different horizon. Panel D examines whether attention (ASVI) and retail order flow (OibVol) could predict next-day liquidity (Effspd), volatility (IntVol), HFT(HFTcancel) and short-selling(SDTCR). Panel A.

Robustness Checks This table reports results on various robustness checks. Our sample period is January 2020 to March 2022, and our sample firms are all common stocks listed on U.S. stock exchanges with a share price of at least $1. Panel A report subperiod results for retail investor trading to predict future stock returns, liquidity, volatility, high frequency trading, and short seller trading in high VIX period. We follow Barrot et al. (2016) and split the period into high and low VIX days using CBOE VIX Index. The DVIX dummy takes one when the day’s VIX index is higher than the sample 75th percentile. Panel B reports subgroup results for retail investor trading to predict next- day measures, interacted with different stock characteristics, and Robinhood 50 restricted list. We first sort all firms into three groups based on previous month-end market cap and turnover and estimate the regressions for each subgroup. We then examine the Robinhood 50 stocks in the restricted list as the interacted group. If a stock i belongs to the list, then the dummy 𝑅𝐻50 takes 𝑖 1, and 0 otherwise. For regression methodology, from Panel A to B, we adopt Fama-Macbeth method to estimate the coefficients of retail order imbalances predicting next day return as in equation (3), and report the coefficients interacted with these dummies. We use panel regressions to estimate the coefficients of retail trading predicting next day liquidity, volatility, high frequency trading and short selling as in equation (4), and report the coefficients interacted with these dummies. Panel C and D report the robustness check on retail activity predicting next-day and long-run measures, where retail activity is identified using Barber et al. (2023)’s NBBO identification and buy/sell sign. Panel C present regression results on retail activity identified by Barber et al. (2023) predicting next day measures. Panel D present regression results on retail activity identified by Barber et al. (2023) predicting cumulative k-week ahead stock returns without scaling by number of days, and next kth week liquidity, volatility, high frequency trading and short-selling measures scaled by number of days involved. Panel E and F report different horizons’ results, using the retail activity to predict future measures over weekly or intraday horizon. Panel E present weekly retail activity measures predict next week measures. Panel F present intraday retail activities predict intraday measures, where every 30 minutes is an intraday interval, starting from 09:30 to 16:00. We use bid-ask average prices to calculate returns for each interval. We estimate Fama-MacBeth regressions, similar to equation (3), and panel regressions similar to equation (4), the independent variables are retail trading from each 30 minutes. *p<.1; **p<.05; ***p<.01.

Previous Studies on Retail Investors Hypotheses Previous studies Group I: Pure noise retail investors Glosten and Milgrom (1985 JFE) argue that informed traders lead to a positive bid-ask (1) Retail investors can’t predict return spread, and uninformed investors provide liquidity. (2) Retail investors provide liquidity Kyle (1985 Econometrica) model the insider, noise traders, and market makers, and argue that informed insider make profits, while noise traders provide liquidity. Black (1986 JF) argue that noise traders have no information of firm value and provide liquidity to make trading in financial markets possible. Barber and Odean (2000 JF) use individual investors trading from discount brokerage over 1991 to 1996 and find their trading performance are poor. Peress and Schmidt (2020 JF) exploit episodes of sensational news that distract noise traders and find trading activity, stock liquidity and volatility decrease on distraction days. Group II: Informed retail investors Kelley and Tetlock (2013 JF) use retail orders from off-exchange brokers from 2003 to (1) Retail investors could predict short 2007 and find both market and limit retail order imbalance positively predict future stock term and long term return, and firm returns. Further evidence suggest retail market orders are informed, while retail limit orders fundamental information provide liquidity. (2) Retail investors demand liquidity Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, and Zhang (2021 JF) provide an algorithm to identify and increase volatility marketable retail purchases and sales from TAQ over 2010 to 2015, and find retail order imbalance positive predict future stock return and may contain firm-level information. Group III: Uninformed retail Grossman and Miller (1988 JF) model the market liquidity as the demand and supply of investors immediacy, and market makers need to bear the inventory risks when facing momentum (1) Retail activities predict short term return. return, but reverse in long run, and Kaniel, Saar, and Titman (2008 JF) use all retail orders from NYSE CAUD file between can’t predict firm fundamental 2000 and 2003 and find positive excess returns following their intense net buying. information Da, Engelberg and Gao (2011, JF) find an increase in retail attention proxied by Google (2) Mixed predictions for liquidity and Search Volume Index (SVI) predicts higher stock prices in the next 2 weeks and an volatility eventual price reversal within the year. Barrot, Kaniel, and Sraer (2016 JFE) use the retail orders from a leading European online broker between 2002 and 2010 and find individual investors provide liquidity to the stock market, but they are not compensated. Ozik, Sadka, and Shen (2021 JFQA) use Robinhood investors holding data from May 2018 to August 2020 and find retail trading attenuated the rise in illiquidity by roughly 40% during the Covid pandemic lockdown. 47 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

Barber, Odean, Huang, and Schwarz (2022 JF) use Robinhood investors holding data from May 2018 to August 2020 and find Robinhood investors engage in more attention- induced trading than other retail investors. Intense buying by Robinhood users forecasts negative returns. Eaton, Green, Roseman, and Wu (2022 JFE) find that Robinhood outages are associated with increased market liquidity, and lower return volatility, whereas the opposite relations hold following outages at traditional retail brokerages. Hendershott, Menkveld, Praz, and Seasholes (2022 RFS) model inattentive investors arriving stochastically to trade, and add to return prediction with new insights based on the inattention friction. Pedersen (2022 JFE) model four types of investors trade assets over time: naive investors who learn via a social network, “fanatics” possibly spreading fake news, and rational short- and long-term investors. The naïve investors are influenced by fanatic and rational views.

Alternative Retail Identification Algorithms in Barber et al. (2023) Barber, Huang, Jorion, Odean, Schwarz (2023, BHJOS hereafter) propose two alternative variations to improve the signing accuracy of retail buys/sells beyond Boehmer, Jones, Zhang, and Zhang (2021, BJZZ hereafter)’s algorithm. In the first variation, the first step to identify retail trades is identical to that proposed in BJZZ, but BHJOS change how the trades are signed as buy or sell. To be specific, they first identify retail as all trades that are executed at subpenny except those between [$0.004, $0.006]. Trades are then signed using the midpoint of the NBBO. Trades that are executed at prices below the midpoint are signed as retail sell, while those above the midpoint are signed as retail buy. In the second variation, BHJOS change both the identification and signing of retail trades. To be specific, retail trades are identified as all trades that are executed at a subpenny except those that are executed between 40 and 60 percent of the NBBO spread. Trades are then signed using the quote midpoint rule described in first variation. Our main results are robust to both two variations of BHJOS, and we report the results using the second variation in Table VI Panel C and Panel D.1 1 Robustness results using the first variation of BHJOS are similar to what we report in Table VI using the second variation, and are available upon request. 50 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4151106",

Subperiod Prediction for Three Distinct Events This table reports subperiod results for retail investor trading to predict future stock returns, liquidity, volatility, high frequency trading, and short seller trading in three distinct periods. We select three distinct subperiods contained in our sample, the Covid strike period, the Gamestop period and the War period. The DCovid takes 1 for March 2020. The DGME takes 1 when the time ranges from January 13th 2021 to February 12th 2021. The DUKR takes 1 for days from February 21th 2022 to our sample end. Our sample period is January 2020 to March 2022, and our sample firms are all common stocks listed on U.S. stock exchanges with a share price of at least $1. For regression methodology, we adopt Fama-Macbeth method to estimate the coefficients of retail order imbalances predicting next day return as in equation (3), and report the coefficients interacted with these dummies.

Alternative Retail Order Imbalances vs. Future Stock Returns This table reports results on whether alternative calculations of marketable retail investor order imbalance can predict future stock returns from one day to 12 weeks. Our sample period is January 2020 to March 2022, and our sample firms are all common stocks listed on U.S. stock exchanges with a share price of at least $1. We estimate the Fama-MacBeth regressions, as specified in equation (3). The dependent variable is the next day return in Panel A, and cumulative k-weeks ahead return in Panel B. The returns are computed using the end-of-day bid-ask average price. The independent variables are alternative calculations of scaled marketable retail order imbalance measures, OibVol_TotalVol and OibVol_Shrout, defined as the ratio of the difference between retail buy and sell over total trading volume or over shares outstanding, respectively, rather than the sum of retail buy and sell as defined in equation (1). Control variables include previous day return, Ret(t), previous week return, Ret(w-1), previous month return, Ret(m-1), log market capitalization, Lsize, book to market ratio, Lbm, monthly stock turnover, Lturnover, and monthly return volatility Lmvol. To account for serial correlation in the coefficients, the standard deviations are adjusted using Newey-West (1987) with five lags. Panel A.

(2021). Our sample period starts from January 2020 to March 2022 and our sample firms are all common stocks listed on U.S. stock exchanges with a share price of at least $1. On each panel, we divide one trading day into 13 intervals, starting from 09:30am to 16:00pm. For each interval, we report the time-series average of cross sectional mean of marketable retail investor trading volume (trades). Panel A. Trading volume 40000 30000 20000 10000 0 9:30 10:00 10:30 11:00 11:30 12:00 12:30 13:00 13:30 14:00 14:30 15:00 15:30 Panel B.
