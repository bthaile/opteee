However,con- trary to the intuition that option sellers generate most of the delta-hedging flows, thereby aggravating market moves, we document that high aggregate gamma in 0DTEs does not propagate past index volatility and is instead inversely associated with intraday volatility. We find a higher correlation between intraday trading volumes in the 0DTE and underly- ing market in more recent periods and a stronger but economically small and insignificant response of the underlying index volatility to shocks to 0DTE trading. 0DTEs’ realized variance risk premium is exceptionally high, especially after the resolution of uncertainty.

Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190 1 Introduction Trading volume in short-dated options, specifically zero-day-to-expiry (0DTE), has exploded in recentyears. FortheS&P500indexalone, 0DTEoptionsaccountedfor50%oftheindexoptions volume in August 2023, up from just 5% in 2016.1 The major trading hub for equity options, ChicagoBoardOptionsExchange(Cboe),hassequentiallyincreasedthenumberofweeklyindex option expiration dates to three in 2016 and five in 2022 to eventually have options that expire every day of the week for the next four weeks, thereby facilitating daily 0DTE option trading. The surge in 0DTE option trading has raised several concerns among market participants and stimulated heated discussions in the press.2 The primary concern is that large open positions in 0DTEs and other short-term options induce delta-hedging needs that can destabilize the underlying market, even when the underlying market is very liquid, as is the case for the SPX index-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) SPY and S&P500 E-Mini (ES) Futures.3 The rationale behind such discussions is that when option sellers delta-hedge, they trade in the direction of the return, i.e., sell additional shares of the underlying during a market decline. The intensity with which hedgers need to re-adjust their positions in the underlying is higher for short-maturity options because these options’ delta is more sensitive (measured by “gamma”, which is inversely related to option maturity) to changes in the underlying. Cboe disputes such scenarios, claiming that the trading flows and the resulting exposure of market makers during the day are well-balanced. With the typical gamma risk distribution across market participants, one should not expect any excess volatility (propagation) in the underlying.

    "text": "This paper investigates these opposing arguments and documents several novel features of the 0DTE market for SPY and SPX weekly options. In line with the extant literature (e.g., Beckmeyer, Branger, and Gayda 2023), we show that volume in 0DTEs now dominates options trading in these underlying markets. To understand how the aggregate open interest in 0DTEs andlonger-maturityoptionsimpactsmarketstability, weanalyzethelinkbetweentheaggregate dollargammainopenoptionpositionsofdifferentmaturitiesandsubsequentintradayunderlying index realized volatility, unconditionally and conditional on lagged volatility. We do not find evidence that the 0DTEs option open interest gamma propagates or uncon- ditionally increases the underlying index volatility. Instead, our results suggest the opposite: higher 0DTE and other short-term options open interest gamma, measured by combining open interest at the market open and options’ dollar gammas shortly after that, predicts lower real- ized volatility within the day and does not propagate overnight and lagged intraday volatilities. There are two plausible explanations for this result. The first is that delta-hedgers are predom- inantly long volatility, and hence, long gamma. As a result, high gamma leads to more intense delta-hedging by gamma buyers, dampening price swings since traders with long gamma posi- tions would sell after the underlying price goes up and buy after the price goes down. Second, in anticipation of low realized intraday volatility, the price of volatility (and option premiums) decreases, and overall open interest increases, reflecting a higher demand at the new price. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to study systematically the effects of aggregate gamma exposure in 0DTEs. Our findings contrast those of Anderegg, Ulmann, and Sornette (2022), Soebhag (2023) and Brogaard, Han, and Won (2023), which either analyze different markets or concentrate on persistent option volume instead of aggregate gamma exposure. Next, to understand whether 0DTE option trading drives trading in the underlying market index instruments or boosts market short-term volatility, we use a structural vector autore- gression framework to analyze joint intraday dynamics of absolute realized market returns and 2 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190",

We observe that positive shocksto0DTEtradingvolumeinrecentyearsareindeedassociatedwithandfollowedbyhigher trading volume in the underlying market and vice versa. However, these responses are not eco- nomically significant and dissipate quickly. The change in market structure in recent years also makes the underlying market return react stronger to shocks to 0DTE trading volume relative to earlier periods when 0DTE trading was negligible. However, the difference in the magnitude of absolute return response to 0DTE trading across the early and later sample period amounts to only 0.1 standard deviations of the absolute return, which is economically negligible and sta- tistically insignificant. Thus, we reject the hypothesis that the surge in 0DTE trading in recent years leads to a stronger propagation of the underlying intraday return volatility through 0DTE trading. We assess features of 0DTE options that differentiate them from the more familiar longer- termoptionsandtheimplicationsforrisksassociatedwith0DTEoptionstrading. Wedocument negative average returns, Sharpe ratios, extreme volatility, and positive skewness for 0DTE op- tions trading — all intensifying as the expiration approaches. Similarly, 0DTE options exhibit exceptionally high variance risk premiums (VRP)—measured as the realized return on a short variance swap, i.e., the difference between implied and realized variances up to a particular expi- ration date—that increase as expiration approaches. The average annualized VRP for 0DTEs is roughly five times that of the 11-22 DTE options and is orders of magnitude larger than that of thelongermaturitybuckets(rangingfrom1to22DTEs)foreveryyearinoursample. Nonethe- less,the0DTEoptions’VRPdynamicsandthoseofthereturns,volatility,skewness,andSharpe ratios from the 0DTE options trading suggest a close alignment between realized risks and ex- pected returns.

    "text": "To ascertain whether market participants price perceived risks, reflected in dollar gamma values, differently in 0DTEs vs. longer maturity options, we examine how open interest gamma for 0DTEs and longer maturity options relate to their respective VRPs unconditionally and conditional on the realized underlying variance. We regress VRP on open interest gamma interacted with both underlying overnight variance and the previous day’s VRP and find no significant relationship between VRPs and open interest gamma for both 0DTEs and longer maturity options, respectively. The interaction of open interest gamma and overnight variance for the underlying is also insignificant across expiration. On the other hand, we find a negative andsignificantcoefficientfortheinteractionofopeninterestgammaandthepreviousday’sVRP for only the short expiration options (0 to 5 DTEs). This result suggests that traders prefer 0DTE options over longer-term options when they have an information advantage in predicting realized over implied volatility in the very short term. 0DTEs’ high leverage and gamma risk make them good candidates for event-based trading. We assess whether these instruments do serve this practical purpose in the market by analyzing the intensity of their use for event-based trading compared to longer maturity options around Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision announcements that are known to be as- sociated with the resolution of uncertainty (see, Cieslak, Morse, and Vissing-Jorgensen 2019, Ai, Han, Pan, and Xu 2022). We show that traders use ultra-short-term options, mainly zero- and one-day-to-expiry options, to bet on the resolution of uncertainty. Compared to the longer maturity options, the trading volume in the zero- and one-day-to-expiry options significantly declines in the half-hour interval before FOMC announcements and rebounds significantly after the announcement. We contribute to several strands of research. First, our paper relates to theoretical works (e.g., Jarrow 1994, Frey and Stremme 1997, Frey 1998, Platen and Schweizer 1998) that analyze how options trading and hedging affect the price of the underlying.

Thus, total hedging demand is proportional to the position size by option hedgers, and if option hedgers trade a sufficiently large volume, the stock price volatility explodes as an upward or downward price spiral ensues. We analyze how the potential hedging demand for ultra-short-term options relates to the underlying volatility and how the former is differentially reflected in the pricing of short- and longer-maturity options. Wealsorelatetotheempiricalliteratureontheimpactofoptiontradingandopenintereston the underlying. Baltussen, Da, Lammers, and Martens (2021) show that returns in the last half trading hour on a wide range of assets are predictable by the intraday return before the last half hour. For SPX, the last half-hour return is positively, but insignificantly, related to net gamma but significantly and negatively related to the product of net gamma and lagged return. Barbon and Buraschi (2020) study intraday momentum and show that autocorrelations are significantly relatedtothedifferencebetweencallandputoptions’gamma. Anderegg, Ulmann, andSornette (2022) suggest that the volatility of exchange rates significantly increases with the aggregate option gamma, such that the order flow from delta hedgers leads to a 0.7% and 0.9% increase in EUR/USD and USD/JPY annualized volatility. Sornette, Ulmann, and Wehrli (2022) extend the model of Anderegg, Ulmann, and Sornette (2022) to study how hedging activity impacts the drift of the underlying during speculative episodes. Using the model, they study the share price of Gamestop (GME) in the Spring of 2021, noting that as GME’s share price rose, call option sellers were forced to buy, leading to a price spiral. Lipson, Tomio, and Zhang (2023) use the shock to retail-based option demand from Robinhood during the 2020 pandemic to document that optionable stocks experienced increased volatility following the shock.

To our knowledge, our paper is the first to document (i) the negative association between 0DTE open interest gamma and the intraday realized variance risk premium conditional on the lagged realized VRP and (ii) analyze the joint dynamics of intraday 0DTE index option trading and underlying volatility. Theremainderofthepaperisorganizedasfollows. Section2discussesthedataanddefinition of risk, return, and trading activity variables. Section 3 presents empirical results that compare aggregate market activity, risks and returns in 0DTEs to longer maturities. Section 4 analyzes the propagation of volatility by 0DTEs and longer-maturity options’ open interest gammas and looks at the interplay between intraday volatility and trading activity in 0DTEs and underlying markets. In Section 5, we consider potential uses of 0DTEs as short-term bets on the resolution of uncertainty and the direction of underlying. Section 6 concludes. 2 Data and Variables Preparation This section summarizes data sources and processing rules in Section 2.1, and variable construc- tion in Section 2.2. 2.1 Data Sources Options. We work with data for several underlying instruments representing the broad U.S. stock market, with the following option roots: SPX and SPXW, both European type and cash- settled against the close (16:00 ET) of the S&P500 market index and SPY written on the most actively traded S&P500 exchange-traded fund (ETF), American type and settled physically in the evening of the expiration date. Note that the S&P500 index has several option roots due to differential settlements: SPX has its expiration at the open (AM) of the third Friday of each month, and SPXW has the (PM) expiration at 16:00 ET, once per week before August 2016, 7 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190",

SPY also had options with three weekly expiration dates for several years and now has the same expiration schedule as SPXW. At the time of analysis (August 2023), Cboe offers options on the S&P500 index and SPY with expiration on each day for the next month. All the considered options have a multiplier m = 100, i.e., the notional of one option contract is given by 100 times the underlying price. We use two source data formats for the options: intraday bars and actual transactions. In- tradaybarsfromCboeDataShoparerecordedat30minutefrequency, andtheyincludenational best bid and offer (NBBO) with size, open/high/low/close (OHLC) prices and trade volumes, price of the underlying instrument, open interest at the beginning of each day, implied volatil- ities and selected sensitivities (i.e., Greeks, including delta and gamma). Most computations are based on these intraday bars, and because the data is cleaned by Cboe, there is not much pre-processingorfilteringrequired. TransactionsdatafromCboeDataShoprepresentsenhanced data from the Options Price Reporting Authority (OPRA), and includes trade price and size, the exchange where the trade printed, the NBBO quote and size, the underlying bid-ask, and the implied volatility and the calculated delta of the trade. This data is not cleaned by the provider, and we parse it using filters and procedures similar to Bryzgalova, Pavlova, and Siko- rskaya (2023).4 After the initial parsing, we first aggregate simultaneous trades with the same conditions and then aggregate the data to the 1-minute bars by adding up trade volumes for each 1-minute bar and group, comprised of the expiration date, option type, and strike. We restrict the sample to options on the S&P500 index with the regular (PM) expiration (roots SPXW and SPY, standing for SPX Weeklys options and options on the most actively traded exchange-traded fund SPY, respectively), expiring within the next 30 calendar days.

For open interest variables on day d, we add up observations at the end of the first bar (i.e., 10:00) for all call and put options with moneyness K ∈ [0.5,1.5]. For volume, we add up all observationsofalloptionsintheselectedmoneynessrangeduringtheday. Tocomputetheopen interest and volume variables for DTE buckets, on each day d we sum up aggregate variables over the required dte range. Figure 1 gives the first impression of the market development over the last decade, by ag- gregating volume and open interest variables for SPX weekly and SPY options with maturities within the next 22 trading days. We know that SPY options are popular among individual investors due to the low notional value of the contract (1/10 of the index option’s notional). Accordingly, the average trading volume in Panel A for SPY is relatively high—about 50% of trading in index options. At the same time, Panels B to D demonstrate that aggregate risks are predominantly held in the index options: open interest in terms of dollar notional, delta and gamma for SPX is about four times higher than for the SPY. It indirectly suggests a more speculativeandretailcharacterofSPYoptions, though, foraformalclaim, oneneedstoanalyze volume and open interest composition in detail. 13 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190",

Second, open interest dollar delta (i.e., directional risk) in Panel C due to 0DTEs is an order of magnitude smaller than for longer-term options and has not increased over time.

Thepatternfitswellwiththeintuitionthatthedirectionof risk taken daily in extremely short-term options changes often such that, on average, the dollar deltas net out. On the other hand, flipping (often) the delta of a longer-term option portfolio is costly, and its sign generally corresponds to longer-term market sentiment in a given quarter. 0DTEs’ open interest and dollar gamma are nevertheless high, indicating a non-trivial size of daily directional bets and resulting gamma risk on the market.

The trading volume witnessed a relatively sharp increase only in 2020, but because it happened in the first quarter of the year, we are reluctant to link it to COVID-related trading. Table 1 provides more detailed summary statistics of 0DTEs volume and open interest vari- ables. The summary statistics are shown for the whole sample period, the sub-period with only one expiration per week (before 09/2016), the sub-period with three expiration dates per week (from 09/2016 to 04/2022), and the sub-period with expiration each day (after 04/2022).

The risk premium is clearly increasing during the day, and sharply so in the last several bars before the expiration.

    "text": "To further understand whether the variance risk premium is linked to (or justified by) the risk of investment in options just hours (or minutes) before expiration, we analyze the dynamics ofoptioninvestmentperformanceatvariouspointsduringtheexpirationday. Attheendofeach 30-minute bar, we select two calls, two puts, and two straddles with strike prices just around the current SPX level to be approximately ATM. Straddles are then close to being delta-neutral and call and put options close to 0.5 and −0.5 deltas, respectively. We compute the payoffs of these option positions using the SPX level at market close at 16:00 and then the realized return using the mid-prices at the end of the respective bar and the computed payoffs. We scale the returns to annual terms using the exact number of minutes to expiration and 60×24×365 minutes per year. These realized returns are used to compute performance statistics (means, quartiles, and standard deviations of the distribution) for calls, puts, straddles, and all strategies combined in Figure 5 and for straddles in more detail in Table 2. We observe that all the strategies reap negative returns on average, with the distribution being extremely wide and right-skewed, especially later in the day. Most importantly, the volatility of realized returns increases faster closer to expiration and jumps by a factor of 2 in the last bar. Average returns of the delta-neutral straddles, i.e., strategies closest to the pure volatility trade, are all negative and rapidly increasing in absolute value to the end of the day. Infact, theaveragereturnisanorderofmagnitudelargerinthelastto-expirationbarcompared to the noon. Table 2 shows that the risks for the delta-neutral straddles increase more or less propor- tionally to the expected returns. For all time points in the afternoon, the Sharpe ratios of investing into straddles are in the same ballpark. Because realized return distributions are very noisy and right-skewed, the Sharpe ratio may not be the best measure of risk-return trade-off. Nevertheless, combined with the pronounced return skewness, it follows that the increase in realized VRPs during the day we observed earlier closely tracks the dynamics of realized risks 19 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190",

Open interest is recorded at market open and converted to dollar gamma OI$Γ using underlying prices and option gamma levels at 10:00 each day.

The sample period is from 01/2012 to 14/06/2023. gamma levels lead to a more intense delta-hedging by gamma buyers, dampening the price swings: traders with long gamma positions would need to sell after the underlying price goes up and buy after the price goes down.

The results reported in Table 4 corroborate our findings above, showing that realized risk premiums decline following an increase in the preceding day’s VRP and open interest gamma at market open, respectively. The interaction terms with lagged intraday variance in Table 3 and with lagged variance risk premium in Table 4 are both negative, even though the VRP∆ expression includes RVday with a negative sign. These results indicate that the decline in the realized variance risk premiums today is driven predominantly by lower option prices, which overcompensate for a lower realization of intraday variance. 4.2 Trading Activity Next, we examine how trading activity in 0DTEs and underlying markets is related to realized price movements of the underlying over intraday time intervals.

Figure 6 shows that the average response of each variable to shocks in other variables is slightly more pronounced in the later period 2020-2023 compared to 2012-2019 (the red line is always higher than the blue one in all panels). However, the differences in the response for each variable across the sub-samples are mostly economically small and not statistically significant. The propagation of market return shocks (Panel A) to future underlying return volatility and tradingvolumebarelychangesacrossthesub-samples,andthesurgeintradingdissipatesquickly. 0DTE trading initially reacts strongly to the underlying return shock, which is consistent with the intuition that the applicability of delta-hedging in 0DTE markets is limited due to the high 0DTEs’ gamma. Following large returns, traders often rebalance their 0DTE positions by trading 0DTEs directly, potentially dampening the required intensity of delta-hedging in the underlying markets.14 12Using ξ =5 minutes produces similar results, but the empirical confidence bounds are wider due to a lower number of non-overlapping observations each day. 13Note that one can easily extend the analysis to compute joint impulse response functions as in Wiesen and Beaumont (2023). However, it requires an assumption about joint shocks, which adds unnecessary complexity. 14For example, check the discussion in Episode 275 of Systematic Investor Podcast at www.toptradersunplugged.com/podcasts/systematic-investor. 27 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190",

The averages and percentiles are computed for periods 2012-2019 (plotted in blue) and 2020-2023 (plotted in red). The response is calculated for one-standard-deviation shock to a given variable.

Panel B of Figure 6 depicts a more pronounced change over time for the propagation of trading shocks between 0DTE and underlying markets and the propagation of the own shock to 0DTE trading. This result tends to suggest that the markets became more integrated over time. At the same time, the impact of own shocks on underlying trading is unchanged over time, and the observed stronger link between the markets stems from the 0DTE market growth.

Although these numbers imply a 1.5 times stronger response in the latter period, the magnitude is negligible economically — roughly 0.1 standard deviations higher absolute return. Moreover, the large overlap of the confidence bounds suggests that the difference in the average response of the underlying return to 0DTE trading shocks across the sub-periods is not statistically significant. Overall,wefindevidenceofsomepropagationoftheunderlyingindexreturnvariancethrough 0DTEs trading. The pattern has not intensified significantly in the more recent periods over which 0DTEs trading surged, and the economic magnitude of the observed increase in the shock propagation is relatively small. 5 Real Uses of 0DTEs: Short-term Bets Our results so far indicate that 0DTEs do not stand out from other longer maturity options on the basis of their market-destabilizing effect. Instead, 0DTEs stand out mainly based on their extremely high ex-post variance risk premium, especially in the last hours before expiration, which we link to the convexly increasing leverage, gamma risk, and the speed of time decay of 0DTEsshortlybeforeexpiration. MaximumpayoffsfromtheATMstraddlesinTable2aretruly stunning, and even though mean (and median) returns are increasingly negative and volatile, many retail investors may be attracted by the lottery characteristics of the payoffs.

We group the time of the day into three buckets, morning, afternoon and evening, and then use these buckets in the controls. Figure 7 shows that options in all DTE buckets experience a significant reduction in trading volume before the FOMC decision and an almost symmetric increase in activity after the an- nouncement.

After the announcement, however, we observe high and significant payoffs from selling short-term variance, especially pronounced for 1DTE options, for which time decay has not yet eliminated most of the time value. Thus, trading in short-term options around FOMC announcements is akin to betting on the resolution of short-term uncertainty: one builds up and keeps short volatility positions in times of elevated uncertainty, and hence, high ex-ante variance risk premium (e.g., Bali and Zhou 2016), and liquidates them after the uncertainty is resolved and prices settle down. The other side, the option buyers, are betting on (or hedging) a directional market move after the FOMC decision atahighrelativepricebutstillcheaperinabsolutetermscomparedtousinglonger-termoptions. Longer-term options, with maturities exceeding one day, retain much of their value beyond the periodinfluencedbyFOMC-relateduncertainty, andtheirpremiumsarenotsignificantlyeroded by time decay yet. As a result, they are not well suited for making short-term directional and volatility bets. Simply looking at the average trading volumes and realized VRPs by intraday bars without including any fixed effects and not accounting for the exact announcement time, we observe distinct patterns of trading volume (Figure 9) and realized VRPs (Figure 10) on FOMC days. There is a clear reduction in trading before the FOMC decision announcement and a spike afterward.16 The realized variance risk premiums are quite different on FOMC days, with short volatility positions in 0DTE losing or not making money throughout the day of FOMC before the announcement and then making (all the) profits within the bar after the announcement. Unconditionally, 0DTE realized variance risk premium is positive for all 30-minute bars and is significant for half of them. For 1DTEs, unconditionally, all the variance risk premium one day before expiration is realized in the last 30 minutes before 16:00, while for FOMC days this period shifts to the right after announcement.17 16The other DTE buckets demonstrate similar changes in trading patterns consistent with results in Figure 7. 17In unreported results, we do not observe any significant changes in realized VRP for longer-term options. 32 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190",

Confidence bounds are based on Newey and West (1987) standard errors with one lag).The sample period is from 01/2012 to 14/06/2023. 6 Conclusion Following the introduction of weekly options with a daily expiration cycle by Cboe and a surge in popularity of ultra-short maturity options in recent years, daily trading volumes in zero days to expiration options (0DTEs) increased more than tenfold from its 2012 level. As a result, several large market participants have weighed-in on the ballooning 0DTEs trading, suggesting that 0DTE trading creates systemic risks for the underlying markets due to delta-hedging flows that can trail large and sudden market moves. We analyze the recent surge in trading volumes for 0DTEs and other maturity buckets (from one to 22 trading days to expiration) and its implications for the broader market. We find no evidence that delta-hedging in 0DTEs has a destabilizing impact on the underlying market. The sharp rise in trading volume for 0DTE options has not been matched by a commensurate 33 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190",

Moreover, contrary to the concerns, we find that the large gamma positions in short-term S&P500 options is instead been linked to lower underlying volatility, suggesting that the market impact of 0DTE options may be less about creating systemic risks and more about market participants managing their positions through hedging. During the day, 0DTE and underlying markets are more connected in recent peri- ods, and the trading volume in either market reacts stronger to trading volume surges in the other. This structural market change has a permanent but economically small (and statistically insignificant) effect on the propagation of the intraday index volatility through 0DTE trading. 0DTEs stand out from other maturities in terms of their risks and returns: these options deliver the highest realized variance risk premium (i.e., implied variance is higher than the 34 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190",

The returns on delta-neutral 0DTE straddles are very risky and exhibit positive skewness, both most pronounced close to expiration, and these features potentially rationalize long positions in 0DTEs by lottery seekers. Ultra-short maturity options are used as bets on the resolution of uncertainty, such as the macroeconomicuncertaintybeforetheFOMCannouncements,andonmarketdirectionfollowing FOMC decisions. Traders betting on uncertainty resolution would be shorting volatility in 0- and 1DTEs before the announcements, and lottery-seeking traders would be buying the options before such announcements to get exposure to extreme market moves. Overall, we do not find supportive evidence for concerns in the media that 0DTE options might be introducing systemic risks to the underlying market. Instead, our analysis suggests that these options serve specific strategic purposes for traders without necessarily destabilizing the market. Future studies could assess the longer-term effects of 0DTE options trading on market stability and whether market participants’ behaviors evolve in a way that could pose systemic risks over time. Such an analysis would require the history of intraday open interest in options of various maturities disaggregated across market participant types. 35 Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4692190",
