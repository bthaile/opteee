Return-generating strategies that are not correlated with equity or bond portfolios. 2. Access to a diverse set of long-only asset class returns with lower cost and potentially improved return versus risk characteristics. 3. Strategies that aim to generate returns during severe market drawdowns. Barclays sees client interest in accessing quantitative investment and risk management strategies via a rules-based index format. These indices can be an efficient way to access new or improved sources of returns, whilst also allowing transparency and flexibility to deliver the desired results. In summary, we see four key reasons why clients may consider QIS indices to be advantageous. Key features of QIS investing Access Liquidity • Asset classes, markets and/or investment • Daily for most indices strategies available that may otherwise • Use the most liquid instruments. require significant trading infrastructure and or expertise.

Types of smart beta factors Equity Factors Value source Behavioral effects (e.g. investors under-reacting to positive news ), bandwagon effects (investors buying Momentum the biggest winners / selling the biggest losers), explain the outperformance of high momentum stocks. Loss-aversion arising from the over-estimation of the risk of stocks prone to draw-downs or sensitive to economic shocks, as well as winners’ complacency resulting from the over-estimation of the ability of Value growth stocks to continue to grow, have resulted in certain attractively priced value stocks outperforming more expensive growth stocks. These types of stocks have tended to outperform due to a preference for lottery-like payoffs from single stock investments, which has historically caused high volatility stocks to be overpriced. Additionally, Low Volatility many investors have been unable to invest heavily in low volatility stocks due to benchmark tracking error guidelines or leverage constraints, causing stocks to trade below “fair value”. An empirical effect detected by researchers that focuses on investors’ preferences for a smaller allocation Quality to riskier stocks versus a larger allocation to less risky stocks has caused high quality stocks to be underpriced by the market.

    "text": "Growing ideas: Developing Quantitative Investment Strategies Idea generation • Ideas for QIS come from a wide variety of sources: Structuring and Trading – Deep experience in QIS. • Partnerships – world-renowned economists, research firms, data providers and thought leaders • Barclays Research – World class independent team of analysts, covering markets across the globe. • Third-Party Research – Papers from academics or other financial publications. • In many cases we have adopted our clients’ views on markets and strategy design, to launch bespoke or refined versions of our QIS indices. Analysis Once an idea has been identified we analyse it according to our four core principles: 1. Client Utility – Does the strategy fulfil a current client need? 2. Individuality – Is the strategy sufficiently differentiated to the current range of Barclays QIS indices? 3. Attractiveness – Is the strategy providing attractive returns, after making it investable and factoring in transaction and execution costs? 4. Robustness – Is the strategy sufficiently robust, i.e. not sensitive to changes in parameters or only applicable in a specific market or environment? Review 1. A group of senior members from the QIS Structuring and Trading assesses each strategy to check that each strategy is robust, well-constructed, and consistent with the philosophy of the business. 2. Barclays Index Administration (“BINDA”)1 conducts an independent review to determine whether to approve the index for launch. Launch of a QIS Launching an index is carried out in conjunction with the corresponding index calculation agent. Prior to an index launch, both Barclays and the index calculation agent run a back-test on the index in order to independently verify the calculation methodology. Once launched, index calculation is the responsibility of the index calculation agent, and is overseen by BINDA. The index levels are in most cases published on both the Barclays index website and Bloomberg. 1 Barclays Bank PLC (“BBPLC”) is a regulated Benchmark Administrator under the EU Benchmarks Regulation. Ownership, sponsorship and administration of Barclays QIS indices is retained within the Barclays group; calculation of all Barclays QIS indices is outsourced to third-party index calculation agents. Governance of Barclays QIS indices is the responsibility of Barclays Index Administration (“BINDA”), a distinct function within BBPLC, pursuant to a control framework designed to ensure that QIS index provision by BBPLC complies with both the EU Benchmarks Regulation; and IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks.

    "text": "How to access Quantitative Investment Strategies Portfolio Construction As an example, a risk-weighted portfolio which aims to balance exposure to each QIS index may utilize a two-step approach. 1. Construction of sub-portfolios Indices designed to capture similar risk premium styles and risk exposures, across asset classes, are first combined using a suitable risk-weighting methodology to form sub-portfolios for each alternative risk premium style. This first step is designed to ensure a strategic balance across pro-cyclical defensive strategies and can incorporate tactical tilts within sub-portfolios, if appropriate. 2. Construction of an overall portfolio Sub-portfolios are then combined using a risk-weighting methodology to construct the overall portfolio. Strategic selection and allocation We work to understand investment objectives and considerations. Typical objectives include: • Enhance risk-adjusted returns • Uncorrelated return stream • Limit downside risk • Replicate the performance of certain investment styles, • Yield enhancement by preserving risk or beta exposure. The team develops proposed index solutions using both: Qualitative selection criteria Quantitative selection Criteria • Strong rationale • Live track record • Clarity/robustness of risk • Risk profile (pro-cyclical/ defensive) premium capture • Downside risks • Expected persistence of risk premium • Diversification. And share transparent documentation around the index range including summaries, detailed presentations, index rules, Alternative Risk Premia Scores, fee levels and performance updates for each index. We regularly publish analyses of macro-economic factor exposures generated by our suite of indices, in order to help them to balance portfolios and avoid unintended risk concentrations. Topical factors include: risk-on/risk-off; inflation; economic growth; liquidity and rates. Strategic selection and allocation to risk premia strategies are most often done with a focus on balancing the risk-on/risk-off factor, i.e. balancing risk exposure across pro-cyclical and defensive strategies. | 15 |",
