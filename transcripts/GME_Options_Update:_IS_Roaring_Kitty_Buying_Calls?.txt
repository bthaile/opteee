0.72s: I went through all of GameStops options
4.36s: transactions for this entire month I
6.92s: told you guys I do this option stuff and
8.84s: I got a couple questions asking about
11.16s: some other expiration cycles and Strikes
13.64s: based on the video I did yesterday and
16.16s: I'm always here to look into some
17.96s: details so yesterday's video was really
21.36s: analyzing whether or not I thought
23.40s: roaring Kitty was buying calls the cliff
25.68s: notes to that version is at least so far
28.72s: I'm not seeing it and that's not to say
30.80s: that he couldn't be doing it but it
33.16s: would be completely different than what
35.08s: he's done before what that means is
37.16s: based on the updates he was sharing on
39.44s: his portfolio previously leading up to
41.56s: the 10th of June I essentially looked at
44.76s: his strike price around his size of a
47.28s: position and I analyze the transaction
50.68s: history so I can get a sense of size
53.56s: latency frequency all those kinds of
56.00s: things it kind of creates like a bit of
57.32s: a a fingerprint on an individual Trad
60.20s: Behavior especially when you're trading
62.12s: something at size it's a little easier
64.16s: to detect so a lot of the things we're
66.40s: seeing so far don't really live up to
68.96s: that standard in so far as most of the
72.28s: transactions the block transactions
74.32s: we're seeing are still pretty small and
76.84s: I'm not seeing the same behavior as I
79.76s: did before so the goal of this video is
82.60s: to provide an update on GameStop options
85.20s: cuz as you guessed more happened today
87.64s: specifically with respect to volatility
89.76s: and and a ton of call volume for this
95.04s: upcoming expiration in just a few days
97.08s: which I do find really interesting to me
99.44s: it seems like a lot of people are
100.76s: burning money here but we'll take a look
103.36s: and hopefully they're not hopefully they
105.72s: get paid out but my goal here is not to
109.88s: spread hyper fud it is to share
112.32s: information leave it up to you to decide
115.20s: so before we get to these two questions
117.20s: I'll get them out of the way just for
119.00s: now and let's take a look 25th of June
121.88s: we saw a pretty big pop in volatility
124.12s: and I actually keyed into that pretty
126.16s: quickly because it was very different
128.24s: and especially the way that the
130.08s: volatility moved throughout the
132.00s: expiration Cycles then we fast forward
133.88s: to today and we see a huge drop in
137.44s: volatility that is already strange to me
140.80s: again when I see volatility moving by
142.88s: near 50 points I'm curious what's
145.72s: driving that even in something that's
147.60s: very volatile there's typically some
149.92s: some sort of news that would lead to
153.20s: this kind of change in volatility the
155.56s: other thing that I find really novel
157.52s: here is how the midterm volatility
161.40s: didn't move quite as much as the
165.04s: near-term that doesn't fall out of line
168.24s: with what you might see if you're
170.28s: expecting a lot of volatility in the
171.72s: short term for the shortterm the front
173.64s: expirations to move around more not
176.36s: exactly shocking but the way that this
178.32s: all popped up and then kind of came down
180.96s: but stayed a little elevated towards the
182.92s: middle is interesting to me now let's
185.24s: kind of get to more of the specific
187.84s: details though the first thing I want to
190.00s: do is take a look at the volume because
192.96s: this is the Genesis of today's video
195.60s: When I See This is three days in a row
198.92s: where the call volume is over 220 this
202.92s: is the lowest it's been over the past 3
204.40s: days but it's still over
206.24s: 220,000 volume on calls AC cross all
210.84s: strikes and expirations and the puts are
212.80s: still pretty static in the ' 50s now if
216.32s: we click in a little bit see where this
218.04s: is happening of this total
221.32s: 226k 130 of it is in this expiration in
227.00s: just a few days here today is the 26th
229.48s: of June then if we go out to the 5th of
234.16s: July there's still a bit way more call
237.00s: skew but much slower transactions and as
240.36s: a typical learning point as you guys
241.88s: like to or as you guys might know I like
245.44s: to integrate different learning points
248.60s: more General to options outside of just
250.40s: GameStop in this and this is a good
252.40s: opportunity for that specifically you'll
255.08s: find that there's typically going to be
257.04s: way more volume and open interest in the
260.12s: standard expirations and it's because
262.60s: you kind of need enough players for
265.40s: increased liquidity so people naturally
268.40s: drift to these places for that as
271.36s: compared to the weeklys that doesn't
273.16s: mean you won't see anything in the
274.12s: weeklys you very frequently will but
276.12s: you'll typically see more in these
278.16s: standard expiration the other thing
280.04s: you'll find is that when we look inside
281.80s: of these standard expirations you'll
284.24s: typically find on round numbers more
287.20s: open interest so at these 20s there's
290.24s: 8971 at the 19 and a Hales there's five
293.84s: at the 20 and a Hales there's 13 does
296.96s: that mean that the 20s are just so much
300.08s: better than the 19 and a halfs or 20 and
301.88s: halfs not really it's just that there's
303.40s: more people that want to transact at
305.64s: these round numbers it's literally human
307.40s: nature so if you click through this the
310.12s: 21s only have 775 the 22s 23 then let's
314.48s: see what happens when we get to 25 this
316.60s: one now has
319.00s: 16,27 it's an observable pattern and
322.12s: it's actually again kind of subconscious
324.20s: tradable information that you can bake
325.84s: into how you're picking things because
328.64s: these Big Blocks transactions can either
331.20s: serve as overall support of resistance
333.28s: for Price depending on what Behavior the
336.40s: market makers have to exhibit as those
338.40s: positions move so that all aside coming
342.44s: back down to here we now know the vast
345.00s: majority is going on in 28 June if we go
347.48s: out to 12 July again still big call skew
350.84s: but very very low volume and then 19
352.80s: July very very big ccue in terms of
357.04s: volume but not as busy the vast majority
360.76s: of activity right now is hands down in
363.72s: this front expiration and I bring this
365.84s: to your attention because while there is
368.20s: activity going on out in the 19 ju when
371.00s: I see these questions that's one of the
372.92s: first things that come to mind to make
375.28s: sure that we're on the same page is when
377.60s: we say things like a lot of volume in
380.16s: high
381.24s: oi on a relative basis it's just not so
384.48s: much what we're seeing now that doesn't
387.60s: mean for that individual cycle that
390.64s: there's not a lot going on but as
392.80s: compared to where we are seeing most of
395.12s: the activity it's very very clearly here
399.20s: 130,000 out of the 226,000 for today
402.64s: occurred literally in a few day
405.12s: expiration cycle that's that now let's
408.64s: take a look at the notable positions for
412.44s: today in terms of transactions we did
415.04s: see a little more size coming in the
418.68s: vast majority of this size is at the
421.36s: super far out of the monies so there's a
424.20s: 1306 lot that came out for the 28 Junes
428.04s: at the 128s and then at the same there's
431.36s: a 1,000 lot that came through and these
433.84s: were actually pretty close together
435.24s: about 10 minutes apart so this isn't
437.60s: outside the realm of possibility for it
439.28s: to be a single party but we don't know
441.44s: and it doesn't necessarily matter
443.04s: because again as I try to remind you
444.96s: guys even though like
447.16s: 1,36 might seem like some sort of really
449.68s: big position it's actually not so I'm
452.88s: doing the math right now here for you
454.88s: guys so that we can see it's a $2600
458.00s: position so and for those that don't
460.32s: know how I'm doing the math I'm
461.40s: literally just taking 1306 * 02 * 100 or
466.44s: you could do 1306 * 2 what whatever
470.04s: makes you happy which now that I look at
472.76s: that pretty easy math still need a
474.52s: calculator though I'm not that
476.04s: smart anyways there's just these aren't
479.08s: big position
480.12s: right and these are the biggest that we
481.68s: saw now there are some sizable positions
485.20s: on a relative basis to this that are
488.00s: happening out here in the 19 July 25s
492.32s: but this still on a overall basis is not
496.88s: it's not that large of a position so in
499.24s: this case we would take 335 multiply
502.80s: that by 415 you get 139,000 and I know
506.56s: that that might sound like a lot of
507.64s: money but for something like it's really
509.96s: not for something like this and
511.60s: especially for options positions that's
513.40s: still on the smaller side but this one's
517.32s: kind of interesting to be honest this
518.96s: 26th July that you see here at the 24
521.20s: and a Hales at uh 250 the reason why
524.60s: that one's interesting to me is just
525.92s: because it's a 24 and a half you'll
527.16s: notice again most of these are generally
528.60s: round strikes and the reason why these
530.48s: 128s are so busy is because they're so
532.44s: far out of the money they're the
533.48s: furthest you can go right now and that's
535.52s: why these are seeing activity as
536.84s: compared to like a 125 or a 130
540.28s: most of these will expire worthless is
543.40s: what it will boil down to so unless we
546.40s: get a giant move I want to be super
548.00s: clear about that if we get a big move
550.40s: then they absolutely could show some
552.52s: money but if we take a look at the
554.96s: entire options chain
557.28s: here they've already decayed as compared
559.92s: to what I showed you yesterday they've
561.80s: lost their one Delta gamma is still zero
565.52s: and now they're mid at 1.5
570.00s: so they're still experiencing two two
573.56s: cents of theta Decay so essentially
575.36s: these will just hover around nothing
577.64s: they they're they're worth fractions of
579.80s: a penny at this point I think a lot of
582.16s: people are just piling into these
583.84s: because if for whatever reason there was
585.60s: some sort of big move then this would
587.88s: benefit but and I also think a lot of
590.40s: people might be unfortunately just
592.60s: piling in on Biggie's Theory and that's
594.72s: that's not to disparage the theory at
596.28s: all I I still think it's a fascinating
598.16s: theory that I'm exploring more for
599.64s: myself but this just a really tough way
602.56s: to make money trading by kind of
604.68s: catching a glimpse of athere and then
606.56s: piling a bunch of money into Super far
608.32s: outof the money calls fingers crossed
610.56s: hoping something works again I really
613.00s: hope it works for whoever goes for those
615.00s: positions I want to see people succeed
616.68s: in this and it's also why I try to talk
618.88s: about this stuff in this way to give
620.72s: people other ideas on how you can
623.00s: structure similar positions that might
625.44s: not make the same crazy percent return
628.04s: if you get a big move but you'll make
629.32s: make more as a gross dollar amount and
632.12s: I'll link that same video I've referred
634.00s: to you guys before a few times buying
636.08s: call options smarter specifically using
638.24s: gme as a vector I'll throw that in the
640.40s: notes that you can check out if you
641.72s: would like now last thing I want to show
644.76s: you is kind of this this is like a
647.36s: really highlevel summary of what I'm
650.88s: seeing in terms of call Long call
655.16s: activity for the month so what I did was
658.88s: look at each kind of primary expiration
663.68s: that we have coming up and I want to see
667.28s: a few things specifically I wanted to
670.40s: see what is the trend of transactions
673.36s: and is there any really big positions
675.52s: being built because there's some
677.16s: conjecture that there
679.12s: was and if we look out to the 19 July
683.84s: expiration which is this one here we do
686.28s: see some interesting positions coming on
688.92s: but
689.84s: still nothing even remotely large and to
693.04s: be clear this is volume this is not open
696.72s: interest this is volume using some of
698.92s: the larger trades so we
702.92s: have and this is aggregating these
705.20s: aren't individual transactions so this
707.00s: is looking over each trading day so far
709.24s: this month except for today I don't have
711.20s: the data yet for today and I'm looking
714.20s: at aggregating at each individual strike
718.84s: for that
720.20s: expiration what is the total volume that
722.76s: we saw transact at that point for the
724.96s: month and there's just not that much
728.72s: going on here the most interesting
730.76s: things are these super far outof the
732.32s: money 128s and I don't really view those
735.40s: is super informed in trades these look
738.00s: way more like lotos to me these 30s are
742.16s: a bit more interesting to me but it's
744.80s: still lower volume on a relative basis
748.32s: so if we come out here to the 30s we can
750.60s: see that there's a big position here
753.52s: 25,700 essentially oi against
757.04s: 18,500 volume today so there's
759.80s: definitely a lot of transactions
761.28s: happening here but my guess is this will
763.32s: be a mix of opening and closing because
766.68s: this is some people that are trying to
768.04s: collect whatever money they can get out
769.52s: of this position before it essentially
771.92s: decays into nothing because if you look
773.44s: at the Theta Decay it's 14 cents these
775.72s: are now worth 17 cents so if you wait a
778.80s: day these are going to be worth very
780.88s: very little as we get closer and closer
782.92s: to expiration again all options have to
785.12s: make a choice they're either going to be
786.32s: in the money with intrinsic value out of
789.64s: the money with no intrinsic value and at
793.76s: expiration extrinsic value is gone for
796.56s: all of them and we're coming up on time
799.80s: here so so far that's what I'm seeing
803.36s: now to go back and address these kind of
805.60s: specifically I don't see these and for
809.36s: the I can't I don't even know what this
811.28s: is kvb they were saying that they were
813.44s: watching as they were dashing out the
814.60s: door the reason why I was honing in on
815.84s: the 20s yesterday is because people had
818.04s: specific questions about that one kind
819.52s: of like you right with this one looking
821.32s: at the July 19th but I don't actually
825.08s: see a ton of activity out here at least
828.88s: so far for the 19th of July that doesn't
830.80s: mean that there's none but there's not a
833.00s: lot and then for this question they were
836.12s: looking at the 30 in 19th July which is
841.88s: the more busy expiration for sure out in
846.52s: 19 July but it's still not that busy so
851.24s: if we go out here 19 July pop out here
854.60s: to the 30s there's
857.80s: 21,600 oi against 6400 volume today so
862.68s: this isn't dead by any means but this
865.28s: also still is not a hyperactive position
869.80s: just yet and this is actually a decent
872.60s: trade in my opinion it's still a little
874.28s: too far in time for the way that I would
875.84s: structure these but at a 36 Delta these
878.88s: will gain decently especially because
881.00s: they will capture a lot of gamma if we
883.12s: get a move in our favor which in this
885.28s: case would be to the upside so there
887.60s: definitely is some speculation going on
889.56s: here but again based on the overall
892.08s: buying activity that I've seen at these
895.04s: levels and for here if we take a look at
899.12s: at the 30s let me see kill
903.40s: this and I just want to show you like
905.44s: the average sizes that we're seeing for
908.24s: that
909.52s: expiration uh specifically and then we
912.16s: need to clear these and we need to go
914.28s: out
915.96s: here you go so you can see the size of
919.76s: these
920.44s: trades they're not big the largest trade
924.40s: so far was 772 which is not small but
928.00s: that's also not a very big trade the
930.28s: other thing is when I look at the price
933.16s: that some of these come through it is
935.80s: clear that at least in my opinion the
938.48s: majority of these look like they're
941.40s: purchases so that is more bullish in
944.72s: nature but there's just not a ton of
948.04s: size going on here yet so that's what
951.16s: I'm seeing so far as you know I am
954.20s: paying pretty close attention to this
955.68s: I'm happy to take a look at anything
957.80s: that you guys would like me to if you
959.76s: have any questions let me know be an
962.08s: outlier I'll see you guys later
