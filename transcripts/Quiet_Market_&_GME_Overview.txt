0.72s: what's up outliers quick market update
3.12s: for you before the surprise live stream
6.80s: later today 5:00 P p.m Pacific time we
8.72s: were getting out there and back at it so
11.32s: taking a quick look at the market today
12.80s: it was a little bit of a follow-through
14.32s: day that's mostly what I saw which I
16.52s: thought was kind of interesting but we
18.48s: are still seeing a pretty big Divergence
21.40s: at this point between large cap and
23.88s: small cap so when I look at the q's and
26.52s: I look at spy you can see that they both
28.60s: had really big green today essentially
31.20s: the overwhelming majority of volume is
32.96s: by volume and it's just kind of this
34.92s: almost parabolic recovery up and out
37.32s: whereas when I'm looking at iwm it's
39.16s: still recovering but it's not really
41.36s: moving anywhere near the same degree as
44.52s: where we're at in these others and again
46.60s: like a quick reference for that is take
47.96s: a look at where they're closing in on
49.88s: pre drop from the first and then the
53.64s: second so over the first and the second
56.52s: on spy and q's it's already capturing
59.36s: most of that move back and it's closing
61.60s: in on where it was at on the 1 that is
63.76s: not the case for small caps we're not
66.04s: even halfway I find that really really
68.72s: interesting because the market so far
71.44s: has continued to be what I consider to
73.60s: be fairly erratic and really really
76.36s: sensitive to movements and what's even
79.96s: most interesting still is the timing of
82.28s: this has become very curious because the
84.92s: probability of a rate cut if I grab the
87.96s: FED watch tool for us to take a quick
89.48s: look at together the probability of a
91.24s: rate cut still is pegged at essentially
93.92s: 100% so here you go you could take a
96.88s: look here I guess I got to move it over
98.36s: to this side I got to get used to that
99.76s: now I'm so used to being on the other
101.60s: side um but you can see the probability
104.40s: of a rate cut here so if we poke through
107.32s: this quickly we can see if we look at
109.64s: the probabilities here it's now
111.44s: teetering back to a half point cut but
115.68s: it's pegged at at least a quarter point
117.80s: cut if not a half point cut I find that
120.28s: interesting because a big part of this
122.44s: move that we saw here in my opinion was
126.12s: the expectation of a cut but now the
128.16s: expectation of a cut is even higher and
131.36s: we're not making that kind of parabolic
133.16s: shift so that I find to be slightly
136.28s: interesting I don't know if there's
137.80s: necessarily a ton to read into it just
139.76s: yet it's kind of one of those
141.60s: FYI bits of information in my opinion
144.20s: that's at least how I'm treating it now
146.96s: when I look across earnings so far bar
150.56s: we did have an interesting earnings
152.44s: release today Home Depot if you didn't
154.64s: have a chance to look through it you
156.12s: should but essentially they're talking
158.32s: about some softening in the consumer and
161.16s: Home Depot overall still performed
162.76s: really well they came in at 467 against
166.12s: 454 expected earnings per share so they
168.84s: did fine they still beat but one of the
171.16s: comments I picked up from the releases
172.84s: that they were talking about a slightly
175.28s: here you go the consumer paused in July
177.76s: you can kind of see right now I'm in in
179.92s: the way on this side unbelievable no
181.44s: matter what I do I'm in the way but it's
183.88s: this uh line item here I thought that
186.20s: that was interesting to to keep an
188.24s: eyeball on so overall when I look at the
191.04s: market RIT large I see net highs lows
193.96s: still trending negative the fact that
196.40s: net highs lows is trending negative it
198.84s: tells me that this movement is being
200.68s: really really propped up by a small
202.96s: handful of names and I can see gross
206.16s: highs expanding and gross lows
208.16s: decreasing but still net is negative so
211.44s: I also find that generally interesting
214.60s: from a market synthesis perspective now
217.48s: let's take a quick look over at our
219.92s: friend gme see what's going on in here
222.84s: and we are essentially just trending
224.28s: sideways which is good I think this the
226.48s: fact that we're consolidating as we are
228.88s: here bodess relatively well for the
231.52s: stock it kind of found its threshold
234.04s: here really ran into strong support
236.24s: strong buy volume popped it back up and
239.20s: it's kind of been running sideways here
240.68s: which is okay because if you look at the
242.44s: performance of small caps here it's also
245.16s: good but it's not great so GameStop to
248.36s: me essentially just looks like it's
250.08s: waiting for some sort of catalyst that's
252.40s: the overwhelming Sensation that I get as
255.56s: I look at the stock now we are below the
259.44s: point of control still which is
261.00s: important to note the other thing is as
263.44s: I look at oi I'm seeing about 700,000
266.88s: calls against 341,000 puts so so put oi
270.68s: is still expanding a bit now one of the
273.52s: things I'm curious about is this 16 Aug
276.12s: oi is
277.64s: 29,000 out of that 696 it's a big bucket
281.72s: so one of the things I am going to be
283.44s: looking for throughout the rest of this
285.12s: week is to see if people are continuing
287.12s: to do what we tend to see them do which
288.84s: is reposition into the next expiration
291.08s: cycle the next primary expiration is 20
294.08s: September which is kind of like this
295.44s: redish orange-ish red and I don't see a
298.16s: lot in there yet I see a little bit here
301.12s: which looks like the 30s there is 10,000
304.36s: oi there now people building out to that
307.28s: but the other thing to keep in mind is
308.96s: that we have earnings coming up on the
311.88s: 4th of September before the market so
314.36s: the other expiration cycle I expect to
316.68s: see get way more busy is the six St but
319.92s: again as I already pointed out that I
321.40s: can't help but find interesting is that
323.56s: the V is still so low in here I really
327.24s: would anticipate this growing a bit
330.68s: so GameStop right now overwhelming
333.88s: sensation is kind of a bit of a holding
335.56s: pattern the options aren't showing me
338.08s: anything that's like super interesting
339.84s: just yet we are still seeing a healthy
342.76s: mix of order flow across different
345.20s: prices most of the bigger transactions
347.88s: are super far out in time so this 16
350.24s: genan 26 25 so much further out in time
354.68s: there was this trade here in 16 a 24 the
357.64s: 23 calls 340 nine of them came out these
361.60s: were sold so this looks like probably
364.16s: covered calls would be my best guess so
366.40s: this is not an insignificant Siz
368.52s: position but it's nothing insanely large
371.32s: just yet so generally quiet day I was
374.48s: texting with Newton a little bit earlier
376.28s: I'm still under the weather but seems
378.24s: like he's starting to feel better so
379.96s: shout out to Newton hope you feel better
381.48s: brother and then we'll see about when we
382.80s: can get back on for another gme live
384.64s: stream but first got to focus on healing
387.12s: as always if there's anything you need
388.36s: be an outlier see you guys later
