1.08s: we time for a gme update because we have
3.36s: some big news on what's going on today
5.52s: the 11th of June that I want to walk you
8.00s: guys through now again to be clear I am
10.16s: an options Trader that is my perspective
12.32s: on this stuff it's how I got alerted to
14.00s: the most recent price movement because I
15.76s: noticed unusual transaction volume
18.08s: obviously it was Ryan Kitty didn't know
19.48s: that at the time so I started placing
21.44s: trades based on that I'm familiar with
24.24s: GameStop but I'm nowhere near as red in
26.20s: as you guys are the ape Community I
28.28s: consider myself a guest in the house as
30.76s: it is right now I traded the last
32.24s: squeeze but there's people that have
33.56s: been here over that entire duration
35.60s: really really involved so I am having a
37.52s: blast learning about this entire thing
39.88s: what you guys are working on now from a
41.96s: trading perspective I want to walk us
43.72s: through some position updates and the
45.52s: way I think this thing could go into the
47.24s: expiration next Friday because that's
50.76s: really where all the interesting stuff
52.28s: is set to happen now the very first
54.68s: thing we have to talk about is not this
56.68s: tweet although I think it's funny
58.36s: because we even have somebody like
59.48s: Timothy PES now trying to badmouth
61.60s: roaring Kitty I just can't help but find
63.92s: it funny that everybody is trying to say
65.80s: something negative about this guy that
67.32s: roring kitty is a shell that he's trying
69.04s: to manipulate people that he's falling
71.04s: off the saddle it's like the dude has
73.20s: hundreds of millions of dollars chill
75.36s: out bro he's doing okay and more over
78.40s: than that he has the greatest sense of
80.68s: humor on planet Earth if we take a look
83.32s: at this tweet from earlier today it's
85.44s: one of my favorite things cuz
87.52s: everybody's talking about him Trading
90.16s: options and they're saying like oh does
91.76s: this guy understand options doesn't he
93.72s: doesn't he know about Theta Decay he
95.72s: bought premium it's like bro he's a CFA
99.80s: he is a $68 million relatively
102.76s: short-term options position in something
105.44s: like GM he knows what he's doing my
108.40s: favorite part is that his sense of humor
111.12s: I can't get enough of it it's so funny
113.92s: he's trolling everybody as if he's now
116.80s: just learning the basics after putting
118.56s: this position on obviously the dude
120.56s: knows what's up so there's actually one
122.92s: other
123.92s: tweet this one that's hilarious because
127.72s: again his sense of humor on this whole
129.48s: thing is something that I think can
131.00s: Inspire just about anybody he he's
133.92s: obviously poking fun at how close he was
136.48s: to becoming a billionaire and then and
138.80s: you know obviously G had a rough couple
140.88s: days which looks like we're probably
144.12s: through so if you take a look GameStop
147.04s: it completed the equity off offering so
151.00s: what that meant was when this first
153.04s: launched we started seeing massive
156.08s: selling volume accumulate this is from
159.04s: the 7th of June then the 10th Monday we
163.64s: saw a continuation of that sale volume
166.88s: this is shares entering the market
168.56s: they're selling shares into the market
170.84s: that provides a lot of downward pressure
173.16s: but take a look at today the day that
175.00s: that volume abated the day that they
177.40s: announced that it was concluded look at
179.48s: the s volume minuscule and take a look
182.04s: at all of these people buying above the
185.56s: recent averages Shares are being
188.16s: accumulated in DRS you can see it
190.24s: happening essentially real time here and
192.04s: it's being represented in price what I
194.28s: find so cool about this is that means
197.32s: that we lost some ground from
198.76s: essentially 38 where it opened here and
201.36s: then it got pushed down all the way to
203.64s: kind of
204.76s: 25 and then today it's up over 22% and
208.64s: it's still after hours bidding above 30
211.60s: so there's plenty of buying pressure
213.44s: here now how this all fits into the
216.00s: expiration next Friday is really where
219.48s: all of this gets super interesting
221.60s: because if we pull up roaring Kitty's
224.40s: position here the 20 uh the 20 calls out
227.08s: here in 21 June a few things stick out
229.64s: to me here the first one is there is
231.08s: another positive
233.40s: 4,92 contracts traded today being added
236.00s: to that and you can see the current open
238.96s: interest is over
241.20s: 166,00 contracts so there's people still
243.68s: accumulating in this the volume for
245.92s: today was
247.12s: 18879 so there's people just piling into
249.64s: this in droves there's also a massive
252.12s: massive change going on here at the 30s
254.12s: these are people that are being cheaper
255.88s: trying to get slightly cheaper exposure
257.68s: to leverage as compared to going super
259.20s: deep in the money couple other really
261.32s: important points here everybody that's
263.20s: freaking out about Theta Decay for him I
265.68s: don't think they understand the game
266.96s: that he's playing and why he's letting
269.00s: these options that are now deep in the
270.44s: money continue to run because if we take
273.12s: a look at the last price 3049 of gme
276.52s: that places him over
278.32s: $10 in the money the amount of extrinsic
282.48s: value left in these options is about a
286.20s: dollar actually a little bit less than a
287.84s: dollar so as this goes deeper in the
291.00s: money the extrinsic value of those
293.92s: options will decrease as intrinsic value
297.32s: comprises more of the premium so if
300.32s: there's an even more significant price
302.24s: accommodation this can be massive for
303.84s: him for a couple reasons which I will
305.52s: show you right now if we take a look at
309.56s: his last position update and again today
311.76s: is the 11th of June this is from the
313.56s: 10th of June and I'll give you updated
315.44s: numbers here so that you can follow
317.44s: along a little more easily so he still
320.56s: has obviously as of yesterday 120,000 of
324.16s: the 20 calls this represents a notional
326.08s: value of $240 million that's how much
328.20s: money he would need in order to exercise
331.76s: this option and take full delivery not
333.88s: using margin which he has access to
337.12s: right now these are not trading at 681
339.68s: these are trading at
341.28s: 11.3 that means his total gain on the
343.92s: position as of right now is
347.68s: 67,900 bucks he's up $7.5 million he
352.68s: still has
354.80s: 29.4 million in cash so what does all of
358.24s: this mean there's a a lot of different
361.08s: opportunities he has in terms of how he
363.20s: wants to execute this trade and he's
365.32s: getting really close to one of the most
367.12s: interesting ones in my opinion which
368.68s: would be a cashless exercise what that
372.12s: means is if the total gain on his
374.76s: position is large enough to cover the
377.20s: total cost so if the total gain is over
379.40s: $240
380.92s: million he can exercise his options and
384.48s: use the gain to cover the entire
387.16s: position he was very close to that if
388.88s: not over it if I'm not mistaken so he
391.60s: obviously has no problem waiting and
394.04s: allowing the the position to play out he
397.16s: still does have $29.4 million to back
400.16s: him up though so he's not quite there
402.20s: yet for some sort of cash transaction
404.40s: but he's not super far off either
406.92s: because his shares will accumulate that
408.68s: he could always offload if he needed the
410.68s: cash but he won't need to probably
412.80s: because he can always take it on margin
414.84s: where he doesn't have to put up the full
416.92s: $240 million his broker will request a
419.84s: subset of that because he will have
421.40s: marginable value from the rest of his
423.48s: positions and the cash that's in his
425.36s: account so he has a few different ways
428.16s: he can play this out best case scenario
430.08s: for him is if this thing continues to
431.72s: bid up and he can execute that cashless
434.96s: exercise that I'm highlighting which as
436.60s: of right now does not seem outside the
439.20s: realm of possibility to me now the last
442.00s: thing that I want to highlight from just
443.68s: an options trading perspective that I
445.32s: find interesting look at the call
448.08s: transaction volume today compared to the
450.32s: puts and look at where they're being hit
454.88s: at meaning most of them are being taken
456.84s: at the midpoint so it's people you can't
459.08s: make heads or tails necessarily if
460.40s: that's a bought or sold position which
462.40s: doesn't matter so much in this instance
464.92s: but look at the overwhelming number of
466.76s: calls transacted 600,000 today compared
470.24s: to 260,000 puts massive call skew
473.72s: normally you'll see the inverse when you
476.24s: see this kind of call skew that's people
478.04s: pricing in massive UPS side potential
480.84s: then if we look down here at the oi open
483.20s: interest let me scoot this in just a
484.96s: little bit so that you can see the rest
486.48s: of that number you'll see that the call
489.76s: open interest is
491.92s: $977,000 the put open interest is 741
495.60s: th000 contracts if we take a look at the
499.04s: 21 June expiration this is where all the
501.68s: focus is the put skew here is massive
505.20s: 456,000 contracts against 242 to give
509.24s: you idea of what this normally looks
511.04s: like if you go out further in time to
513.64s: something like this the 18 October
515.40s: notice how there's put skew this is more
517.52s: normal where there's 37,000 puts against
520.36s: 35 36,000 calls normally it's even more
523.28s: extreme to the put side but that's to
525.28s: give you an idea of what this normally
526.68s: looks like this is the inverse and then
529.44s: sum massive upside being priced in and
532.36s: interesting on top of that not really
534.84s: resonating into or kind of flowing into
537.20s: the 14 June expiration it's not
539.56s: resonating with these shorter term
541.40s: options players for this week because
544.12s: the total oi for 14 June is like
547.72s: 176 and the put oi is 173 something like
551.24s: that so there's actually just not that
553.44s: much flow through into this the last
555.92s: thing I want to talk about is what
557.80s: happens if he chooses to sell I've heard
559.76s: a lot of people ask that and it's a
560.92s: great question one the market makers
563.68s: would make him a market it would be
565.04s: there but he would take a massive
566.52s: haircut because everybody knows his
568.76s: position is out there now so if he
570.72s: attempted to start unwinding this
572.40s: position we would all pick it up again
574.16s: me I'm a random dude sitting in my house
577.16s: and one of my scanners picked up his
579.32s: buying volume and I didn't know who it
581.16s: was or what was going on it was just
582.40s: anomalous which necessitated a trade
584.84s: from me so think of really all the
587.32s: sophisticated Traders out there with
588.84s: incredible technology around this
591.32s: they'll see it in a heartbeat and they
593.36s: will happily fade into it to follow that
595.96s: down move the floor would come out if he
597.92s: started trying to unwind this in a big
600.00s: way so do I think that's what's going to
602.72s: happen here probably not it doesn't seem
605.12s: so much like hiso the other thing that I
607.60s: try to remind people that he can do is
609.68s: if he chooses to close his option
611.16s: position which would bid the market down
613.72s: he probably would give up some of this
615.88s: gain but he still would make millions of
618.56s: dollars and then he could always just
620.36s: gain exposure again buy more right he
622.64s: now has way more money that he can do it
624.24s: with he didn't even go all in on this
626.96s: first run so he's working on some stuff
629.32s: stuff in the background that obviously
630.84s: I'm not too privy to yet but maybe you
632.92s: guys know better than me again I view
635.08s: myself as a guest in this whole Saga I'm
637.12s: learning more as we go I can't help but
638.84s: be completely fascinated if you're in
641.12s: markets right now and don't think gme is
642.76s: one of the most fascinating things that
644.28s: you can be involved in I don't know what
645.64s: you're looking at because as you can
647.76s: tell it literally gets me excited it's
649.68s: so cool to see stuff like this so all of
652.76s: that is to say if I look at what I think
655.48s: he's going to do and what it looks like
657.04s: is happening as this thing starts to
660.12s: Rally if we get that gamma ramp which
663.44s: looks like it's happening and we start
666.12s: to see price accumulate even more he has
668.56s: the opportunity for a cashless exercise
671.96s: which to me would be threading the
674.04s: needle for him on this position because
676.36s: then if he does that exercise the market
677.96s: makers have to go find a bunch of shares
679.52s: on the open market that's already pretty
681.12s: limited because you guys are super smart
683.00s: DRS in your shares which is going to bid
685.16s: things up even more because it is a low
688.16s: low volume pool that they can pull from
691.20s: that they're all trying to pull from so
694.12s: that looks like the primary play here he
697.32s: could always exercise part of his
698.96s: position sell part of his position
700.68s: there's no rules meaning he can do
702.32s: whatever he wants with each and every
704.44s: one of those single contracts what I can
706.84s: say is that I highly doubt he would do
708.64s: anything all at once I don't think
710.60s: there's a reality where he hits the
712.36s: button to sell 12 120,000 contracts he
715.96s: would get murdered on the spread and the
718.76s: market maker would have a field day with
720.52s: that he would probably have to phase out
721.96s: in 10,000 lot and even that would be
724.20s: picked up super fast you get two or
725.68s: three of those out and it would be seen
728.28s: nearly immediately so one of the coolest
731.72s: things you can watch coming into the
733.04s: expiration next week I cannot get enough
734.92s: of this if you have any questions or
736.24s: anything to add throw it in the comments
738.20s: keep being awesome being an outlier I'll
739.84s: see you guys later
