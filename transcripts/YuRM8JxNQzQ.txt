0.00s: Sweet. What is up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers and I got my friend Michael
6.56s: Guy Ed from lead lag slash the attack sphere of ETFs. You and I have, you know, known each other
13.92s: for a while now. I always love getting a chance to pick your brain, talk about markets and whatnot.
18.64s: So first off, welcome on Stoke to Have You Here, man.
22.08s: Dude, you are the outlier. So I'm stoked to be on it. Come on now.
26.64s: You know, I feel like somebody was telling me about this thing of like manifestation,
33.52s: which it's always been so weird to me, right? To like just think of something and then all of a
38.80s: sudden it happens and I've tried it and it's not fucking working. So maybe I need a manifest
44.56s: harder and then I can become like an actual outlier and be like one of these dudes with a $200
48.64s: million yacht. But you know, we're working on it. At least we'll talk about it.
53.28s: I'm trying to manifest a credit event if you haven't noticed it. This is not been working
57.76s: apparently either on my end. I guess that's actually like really true. I'm laughing pretty hard
64.16s: at that because if I look back across your Twitter feed, it is filled with said what a great
69.84s: spot to start. So for the people at least from my audience that might not be familiar with your,
76.24s: I don't want to call it an obsession, but we'll call it in an obsession with a credit event.
80.56s: What is the thesis behind this? Because for those that don't know, I've actually read pretty much
86.48s: all of your white papers and the stuff that you think about, it's not like a lot of people
92.16s: speak in hyperbole for attention, right? And you get it, you know, there's always some showmanship.
97.36s: But when I read through your stuff, it's like very clear that you were connecting dots.
103.68s: Talk to me about the credit event.
105.36s: No, no, and well, and the showmanship and loudness on X is obviously not like the real professional
110.72s: stuff that I put out there. I mean, look, first of all, it's funny because people forget that I
116.64s: was bullish at the start of the year. I was saying melt up. There was a whole thread I
120.64s: pointed out, January 13. I said melt up or crash and yes, was the answer in putting the post. I said
129.60s: that Fin Twitt can't understand path. I believe we see both this year, right? So I was saying,
134.88s: you're going to have a melt up because it's pre-election years, but towards the end of the year,
138.80s: there would be a heightened risk of a credit event, which, you know, would be in response to the
144.40s: lag the facts of the fastest, greatest rate hike cycle in history. Okay, now, I think I've been
152.32s: right and wrong as is the case with most things in the way that it's played out.
158.16s: You did have a melt up, but only in large cap tech. So you can say, okay, that was right.
163.84s: You did not have a melt up and everything else. The S&P 493, small caps, retailers, Europe,
169.36s: emerging markets. There's been no melt up outside of those large cap names. So I'd say that I was
174.48s: actually very wrong in that melt up argument. And the whole melt up argument at the start of the
177.60s: year was it's pre-election year. Pre-election years are factually historically the strongest of
183.28s: the cycle. Now, let's talk about the credit event. Credit event is not some scary term.
191.44s: Credit event just means a VIX spike. That's all it is. So when you look at the VIX volatility index
199.12s: and you overlay credit spreads, you tend to see those are one for one relationship,
203.12s: meaning as the VIX spikes, credit spreads tend to widen, not my opinion. VALTODY is seen by the
209.60s: bond market as increasing de-falt risk. So yeah, part of the thesis was at some point the lag
215.12s: defects would kick in the Fed likely over Titans, which by the way, now, long-gravation yields are
220.32s: telling you that they did, which we can maybe touch on in the last several weeks here. Instead,
226.48s: you ended up having a credit event in Treasuries, which I then changed my tune and saying that's
233.04s: phase one, but a corporate credit event phase two is not yet happened. I thought it would start
239.60s: entering November. Now, the reason I said at the end of October that the first week in November,
244.16s: you could see circuit breakers, which I was able to say was way wrong on, right, was credit spreads
248.72s: were starting to widen. Okay, the VIX was at a point in the exact 21. It was at the point where it's
253.68s: like, it was going to break out and spike. It's around this level. So let me make a communication,
258.00s: bet and say, okay, well, what if I'm right? And it's so happened in my own funds. The signal said,
262.72s: the intresuries. Treasuries worked that week. No circuit breaker, best week of the year for the S&P.
269.76s: And then you had this drift and everyone's super bold up, right? But I don't think the credit event
274.72s: risk has gone away. Maybe my timing, not maybe obviously my timing has been off in putting a spotlight
281.76s: on it for entry November. But we don't know where these legs actually start to impact the economy
288.72s: in the stock market. I mean, you're already seeing now in housing. You're starting to see the housing
292.24s: side break down finally on home sales and pricing. But to say that just because it hasn't happened in
299.20s: a single month, which I thought was higher risk, that the risk is still not there to me as silly.
303.68s: Because the thesis has not changed. There are lags. We went through the faster rate cycle
307.36s: in history. At some point that will manifest the manifestation, probably manifest in an ugly way.
314.08s: But path matters more than prediction. I've been wrong. Having that silly made money or lost money,
319.36s: or I should say, on that, because if you were in treasuries the last month, you'd be great. Treasuries
326.40s: would have been the credit event way to trade it anyway. So it's fine. But it just goes to show you
332.24s: how this is a business where it's a fine line between being wrong and being early.
339.28s: Yeah. Well, and I also think it's interesting that you look a lot at path dependency because I find
345.28s: in markets, I have a stats background. And I spend a lot of time looking at these things as well,
350.40s: because I find them interesting. And sometimes I feel like the path can be misleading when it's
358.16s: overlaid with some of these unnatural add-ons, specifically like you're talking about a lot of the
365.28s: feds actions, which I've always been so curious how to even think about that. Because we've never seen
371.36s: anything like this before. So it's like how can you think about applying typical path dependency
377.76s: into this kind of environment? How do you think about that when there's like truly anomalous
381.52s: conditions like this? No, no, no, and actually you're hitting on why I just, the reality is nobody
388.08s: knows. Not me, not you, not anybody else's thing, right? Because we've never seen anything like this,
392.56s: the fastest rate hike cycle in this way, right? So even the fed can't model out the legs. They
399.04s: themselves have admitted that. And that's my point. It's like if we agree that we've never seen anything
406.88s: like what we've gone through. Then maybe it's bullish, maybe it's bearish. But one thing is that
413.92s: I can say for certain is that it's not certain, right? And that's sort of the mindset. It is funny
420.56s: to me, the I get all this anger and hatred for pointing out people say you're a perma bearer,
426.48s: it's like no, again, if you have an IQ greater than 80, you can see that a funny time has been bullish
431.76s: in the past. But unless the thesis has changed and the thesis has always been around the legs,
437.92s: I guess the magnitude of the rate hike, I still think the risk is there. The fact that so many
442.64s: people seem to think it's not just because it didn't happen in November, which was a monster month,
447.04s: which by the way, plenty of bear markets have monster months. To me is like, I don't know,
452.64s: that seems like that's the set of probably have a credit for it when nobody's thinking can happen
456.24s: again, right? When the risk seems to have gone away. This is having two roles with which drives me
460.56s: kind of crazy. So a lot of noise was made about the Dow Jones Duster average on a total return
466.16s: basis medium highs. So it's a bull market there, right? Okay. I keep them back to yes,
472.72s: technically that reset the drawdown in the down. You're still in the drawdown for the Nasdaq,
477.04s: you're still in the drawdown for small cash, still in the drawdown for the S&P. Okay, but
483.44s: what about inflation? Right? I mean, that prior peak for the Dow for the S&P for the Nasdaq from 2021,
493.20s: it's not in nominal terms. What's the real level, the after inflation level? You still need,
498.40s: like another 12% from here for the Nasdaq to technically be at the real after inflation at just
503.76s: the high from 2021. I'm not saying it can happen. I'm just saying for all intents and purposes,
509.28s: we're still in the drawdown because still being a bear market. And you only know if you're in a
513.92s: new bull market after you've taken out the prior peak, which means you only know if it's with hindsight.
519.28s: Right? But again, credit events tend to end bear markets. If it spikes tend to end bear markets,
525.60s: you have not had that inequities. And if I'm right, that the credit event is still out there that
530.88s: we're still in a bear market, it's going to frustrate the hell of a lot of people and that's what stocks do.
536.40s: That I couldn't agree more with. So thinking about the credit event possibility still,
542.96s: the way that things have been folded thus far, what are the primary catalysts that you see on
548.40s: the horizon that could kind of capitulate us down that route? So there really are a legit number
554.88s: of catalysts. I mean, ones that have been talked bad and ones that are not getting as much attention.
559.36s: So obviously, there's the commercial real estate side of things. I don't think it's going to be
565.36s: as big of a catalyst because that's not all at once. China could still be a catalyst with the
570.80s: real estate crash that's going on there. Our own housing market could be a catalyst. Right? If that
576.24s: kind of creates a sort of self-fulfilling cell cycle, everyone seems to assume that you have to go
582.08s: back to 3% mortgage rates to unlock this kind of lock-in effect. It's not true. Well, you go,
587.92s: mortgage rate of 5%, you're going to have people selling, you're going to have 5 and a half percent.
590.96s: They're going to sell. They're going to unleash because the reality is, yeah, they're
594.48s: locked into their home, which means they're also locked into home insurance rates.
598.24s: That's going up. You can see that with the storage on Florida. All these home prices,
605.36s: who went through the roof or these property prices went through the roof, they have this lock-in rate
608.56s: with low rates. But the insurance costs are going through the roof. So it's like, what do you do?
613.68s: You're going to keep on paying the insurance. You're going to try and sell just because you have
616.80s: a 3% is that enough. So that could be a catalyst. I still think Japan is the real big catalyst.
622.96s: Right? If they're going to try to, it's normalize their own policy because of inflation.
629.12s: You're talking about a country that has been a source of leverage for the entire world for 30 years.
635.84s: Now tinkering with monetary policy and a more aggressive tightening type of way, that could still
641.68s: be a catalyst. But the point is, it could be something nobody sees coming. But the condition
650.48s: for whatever it does come still relates to the fastest rate, high cycle in history.
655.92s: And the lag. Right? That's all I'm trying to stress by providing a different way of thinking about.
662.32s: Now, you and I both know having a thesis is one thing, trading is a whole different thing.
669.92s: Right? And I make this point continuously. I do not believe in shorting. I do not believe in going
676.24s: into cash. I do not believe in buying puts. For me, and I've said this as outlined in the papers,
682.00s: the risk off expression is still to be exposed to something on the long, long side. Right? And
689.84s: outside of the options market, the way you do that is by either being long gold, which is working,
695.52s: being long treasuries, which is starting to work, being long the dollar, which has worked the
699.68s: longest as a risk off trade, or being long utilities on a relative basis. Right? That's your risk off
705.52s: up to any set. Right? So you can be bearish and be long those, be wrong being bearish but still
712.72s: with money. You can be bearish, be long or those and make money. But the point is that it's not a
718.96s: guarantee either way. And that's why it tends to be a better way of expressing defense than
723.60s: making an outright directional bet saying stocks are going to go down credit event,
727.36s: shorted if you have conviction. I don't have conviction in the mile marker. I have conviction in
731.12s: the conditions. Right? The catalyst could be the pebble on the road that nobody sees as they're
737.92s: driving. You're not going to swerve because you can't see that catalyst, but you know that you
742.16s: need to already be slowing down before that pebble hits you. I think the way you described it there
748.64s: makes a lot of sense too in that it's not necessarily, you know, what is the last thing that
753.76s: tips us over, but we're at a point where any one of those things potentially could. Right? So
759.60s: when we look at something like the housing market and I was looking at something where like,
764.56s: you know, back in the 80s, the median home price was like 3.7 times that of the median income.
771.92s: And as of November, it's like five and a half to six times the median income.
778.00s: What role do you think the housing market plays in the way that this unwind occurs if any?
786.80s: So even the Fed has said that the wealth effect is most powerful when it comes to housing.
794.72s: Right? I mean, we talk about the stock market and the wealth effect for stocks, but like the
798.40s: reality is it's most people's assets is their home. We're privileged to be able to trade and own
804.64s: stocks and to play that game, but the reality is most people don't. Their wealth is their home.
810.08s: Okay, so to the extent that housing appreciates, it makes them feel more confident. They spend more.
815.44s: If housing depreciates and makes them less confident, there's a reverse wealth effect. They start
820.32s: pairing back. Right? You haven't seen that yet because housing is only now starting to roll over.
825.60s: I've been early on that, by the way, I said, could there's a housing is not going to use the word,
829.52s: but isn't trouble. Obviously, I've been wrong on that. But again, fine line between being wrong
833.44s: and early, plenty of people were wrong in 2006, warning of a great financial crisis.
838.24s: At the housing peak back then, they were wrong until they were right. Right? Which is just two-year
843.68s: lag from 2008. So if housing is going to keep on weakening, if there is going to be this depreciation,
852.40s: yeah, that's going to challenge the consumer. That's going to challenge small caps.
858.00s: It's going to challenge the likelihood of zombie companies, which have high leverage and low margin
864.64s: to keep up with higher costs of capital because the revenue cycle gets challenged as people
869.04s: spend less. That's not a perma bear argument that's causing effects. Right? Now, maybe that doesn't
876.00s: have. Maybe housing holds or goes sideways. Maybe it's a correction in time. Okay, it's possible.
882.64s: But typically, extremes don't resolve them self-sides. Right? And the appreciation post-COVID
891.92s: in housing isn't extreme or an annualized basis. Right? Nationwide.
896.08s: So, let's see. I think that is a headwind for a while. Again, maybe it's a catalyst, maybe not.
904.08s: It's not a catalyst in the same way as what you saw in the 2008 financial crisis. But as a catalyst
910.80s: that breaks consumer spirits, yeah, I don't see why not.
916.48s: Do you factor things like auto sales coming down or things like credit card defaults going up?
926.08s: Actually, the beginning of this earnings cycle, I trade earnings, right? So, I'm an
930.88s: options trader. So, unlike you, I have no loyalty long short, whatever it is, dog, I'm there.
937.12s: But I did notice when the banks were reporting, I always like to read through their reports,
941.76s: because you get a lot of information. And they have a really significant spike in credit
947.12s: write-offs from people defaulting. Do things like that factor into your thesis as well?
951.60s: Are those just kind of additional supporting metrics that move us further along this path?
956.24s: Yeah, I think it's supporting. It goes back to that point, but the legs, right? It's like,
960.80s: look, it takes time to change a habit. I mean, you know this yourself, right? I mean, given the
966.08s: CSS you've had in your life and your career. So, if it takes time to change habits, consumers don't
970.96s: change their spending habits overnight. It takes many months of seeing the minimum payment on the
974.96s: credit card rising, it takes many months of them seeing the minimum, just in general, just how much
981.36s: the rates are rising for that to actually impact how they're spending. So, and then suddenly they're
986.16s: surprised by it and then the link would see you start to kick in, right? It's like, I use that line
990.32s: slowly, then all of a sudden, continuously. Because that's how this works. It's like slow burden,
996.24s: then suddenly the fire is there. So, I think all that is supportive of the idea that, yeah,
1001.36s: that credit side is straining consumers, right? And again, it maybe doesn't resolve itself in an
1007.92s: event. Maybe it's just a long drawn out, you know, pressure problem for the economy,
1014.08s: but to deny the cause and effect of rates on consumer spending. And by the way,
1018.80s: on retailer stocks, which have been telling you for the entire year, consumers are strained.
1022.96s: For all the narratives around how strong the consumer is, tell me why retailer stocks have gone
1027.60s: sideways in a pre-election year. Tell me why small cash, which are more sensitive to domestic economy,
1033.60s: have gone sideways. I get the regional bank, you know, effective. But like even the stock side is
1039.36s: telling you that these delinquencies are are only starting. So, how else do you explain the
1044.96s: performance being so poor on a relative basis to the S&P to the NASDAQ? So, yeah, I think,
1050.80s: I think it's foolish to argue that we're in an expansion phase just because the Fed
1058.00s: is now maybe done hiking rates because history shows that when the Fed is pivoting,
1063.28s: it's a contraption phase. It's not an expansion phase. It doesn't have to be. It's not every time.
1068.08s: But this is game of probabilities. So, volatility should be increasing. Dilling quantities are the
1072.72s: first step to that. Did you see Powell statements today when he was talking about he doesn't
1079.36s: necessarily. He thinks it's, I don't want to misquote him too bad, but the paraphrase was
1085.20s: that it's too early to say that hikes are gone. What did you make of that? Is he just playing
1091.04s: hardball as per usual? Or because to me, I looked immediately at bonds to see what they thought
1097.20s: and they think he's full of shit. But, you know, no, no, no, it's actually interesting, right? The
1103.84s: moral swation is a tool for the Fed. Words are a tool because they obviously impact rates.
1112.72s: I suspect that Powell probably is concerned about the stock market running away. Does
1119.04s: some extent? Why? Because if the stock market keeps pushing higher, it will delay the disinflation
1127.04s: that comes from housing. So, one of the arguments for why I think housing has been stubborn on the
1131.92s: upside is because a lot of people saying, okay, yes, the mortgage ratio has been present. That's
1136.32s: fine, but I got in video. Like, the view there stock portfolio as something that can help pay off
1142.72s: those higher mortgage payments. So, I suspect that Powell does not want to see the stock market
1149.84s: in a enormous melt of phase because that's going to cause all kinds of liquidity and
1154.72s: flea-shares pressure and then cause them to have to hike rates again. So, I do think it's a game of
1158.72s: trying to manage expectation on his end. Now, to your point about the bond market saying he's full of
1163.52s: shit, of course, he's full of shit. He's full of shit because he can't tell the future better than
1168.56s: nobody else. I mean, if you look at headlines of Fed projections for hikes in 2018-2019,
1178.00s: they are expecting four hikes and then they end up cutting instead. It's like the Fed doesn't know
1184.16s: what's going to happen next to either. But, and the Fed is a follow. I always go back to that point.
1190.00s: The Fed doesn't own the bond market. The bond market owns the Fed. The fact that the long duration
1193.84s: side is acting like this. Okay, yes, it's over. It was oversold. Yes, it was due to bounce.
1198.40s: Right? And I stress that long duration trade finally kicking in. The Phoenix rising idea,
1203.52s: the fight to safety has not happened yet because credit spreads haven't widened yet. But,
1207.84s: it does seem like the long duration side is saying the Fed definitely over tightened,
1214.40s: which means that he can say that they're not done hiking rates. But, at the end of the day,
1219.84s: the Fed is the bond market's bitch. I'd say that way, but that's just the truth. The long duration
1224.40s: side is bitch. Right. Before we move on from the credit event, there is somebody in the chat from
1230.80s: the Twitter space that was saying, can you share two to three concrete examples of what a literal
1236.16s: credit event would look like? So, any VIX spike, I'd say above 30, you can see that. So, if you go
1246.08s: to Google, Fred, right? And then VIX and then OAS. Fred VIX OS, those three terms. I think it's the
1254.56s: first link that shows up. You'll see that chart that overlays the VIX against credit spreads and then
1261.20s: the shaded areas of recession. And you'll see, again, there's a one-for-one relationship.
1267.04s: Right? So, you know, it's like, if you're going to be mathematical about it, it's literally just
1271.52s: just that. Right? You had a credit event with COVID. You had a credit event in 2008. You had a
1276.48s: credit event in 2011 with a summer crash. You had a brief look like a little bit like a credit event
1283.44s: in November, December 2018. Right? But basically, at any time, you have a significant VIX spike,
1288.64s: that's basically where credit event is because you see spreads widened. Right? Again, it's,
1295.52s: if you believe, I put that poll on yesterday, right? I said, if you, as it do you believe that
1300.40s: you're going to see a VIX spike in the next three months. And something like 70% of people said,
1304.00s: yes, the next post down, I said in that, is if you believe that you're going to see a VIX spike,
1309.76s: you have to believe in the credit event thesis because it's the same argument. You're not going
1314.72s: to get a VIX spike in spread state type. That's not how it works. Right? That's my point with this.
1321.12s: Again, I've been wrong on the timing. I don't think I'm wrong in the reasoning.
1323.76s: Well, and I think some people, at least based on the way that this person was asking that question,
1332.64s: it looks like their name is bull for now. I kind of get, I kind of get the sense,
1338.48s: by the way, that they ask the question that sometimes people, when you, when you say something
1343.52s: like credit event, sometimes it feels like people are thinking like they're going to see fire in
1350.24s: the sky in that it's going to be end of days. Right. No, I've said this may test before. It's like,
1358.24s: if I'm right, there was still a bear market, which I know sounds crazy, especially now, a credit event
1362.48s: ends at a VIX spike ends it because historically, bear markets do end with a bang, the end with a
1368.24s: capitulate or remove, speaking about like tech analysis. Well, yeah, I always poke fun at the squiggles.
1373.76s: I say I use that term, the basement traders using squiggles, right? Okay, fine. Something
1377.76s: against tech analysis. I'm just against things you can't backtest. Right. And most of these
1382.64s: in quotes squiggles, you can't backtest. But one thing which is very well known that you can't
1386.16s: backtest is extremes. Right. The capitulation that happens at the end of a downtrend.
1393.76s: Capitulation is VIX spike. Capitulation is a credit event. It's where junk debt falls apart relative
1399.52s: to AAA. We have not had that in equities. It's just fact. Maybe we don't in which case, I'll be wrong.
1410.72s: But probably, realistically, I think it's a higher possibility than not. Now, if I'm right about
1417.04s: that, that brings back what I've used that line before, you know, to save treasuries, you have to crash
1421.60s: stocks. Right. And people seeing the treasury move the last month, they're saying, oh, obviously,
1426.80s: it shows you wrong. No, it doesn't because the top 1% of the clients using daily data for the
1431.76s: S&P treasuries are positive in the biggest decline for stocks. I mean, it's just fact. So if I'm
1436.08s: right about that VIX spike that credits bread wide name, which is still to come, okay, then you know
1440.40s: what? Yeah, you're going to see some really interesting movement in defensive areas in advance
1447.92s: because those tend to move prior to that occurring. And you're going to see junk debt breakdown,
1453.68s: which would be a great opportunity to buy into junk debt. Like, I want to see a credit event selfish
1459.76s: ly, not just because, you know, can't believe for my own funds, they're designed to play the flight
1464.40s: to safety trade in treasuries, which the credit event is kind of needed for that to kind of get
1469.76s: shot back into place. But I want to buy cheaper levels on the risk on side who wouldn't. I don't
1475.60s: know. I am blowing away. It's like, if you're a real investor, you want a credit event
1481.44s: because time's on your side. You want to buy cheaper. It's not going to stay down. I never
1486.48s: said it would stay down. A promo bear would say it would stay down. It's not.
1492.48s: So there's a couple of things that I wanted to ask you about. The first one is
1498.32s: a personal curiosity. Have you, because I know that you study a lot of relationships,
1504.64s: I've never studied this one. I've studied tons, but I've never studied this one.
1508.48s: Have you found any correlation between when Christmas displays come out and the performance
1515.28s: of that company? No, although it's not easy. I interviewed Jeff Mackey, who used to be on
1524.56s: CNBCL Adi's now covering a lot of stuff on retail or consumer stocks. And he actually
1530.08s: bring, I'm trying to remember the exact thing, but he mentioned something along those lines where
1532.88s: it's like, there's a strong correlation between sales related to garden Christmas items. I
1540.16s: think it was like display items for like the front yard and future retail sales into the holidays.
1550.08s: And it's basically the idea is that if you end up seeing people not buying a lot of things like
1554.96s: lights and all these things for their front yard, that's actually a harbinger of negativity.
1559.52s: So I don't know if that's, I haven't studied it from the perspective you're asking, but it kind
1562.80s: of reminds me a little bit of that. But is it, you saw on that up here? It's now.
1566.80s: No, I haven't. That's why I'm literally asking people because I haven't done that one yet. I'm
1570.72s: working on a handful of other ones from this past year on different anomalies. So like, I'm trying
1575.20s: to outsource some of these questions I have. So it wouldn't surprise me if there's some effect.
1580.32s: It was like, the reality is, you know, look, Phomo is always about sentiment, sentiment's always
1584.72s: more than just a chart. That's why seasonality is a thing. That's why even moon cycles are a thing.
1592.80s: It's ultimately about mood. So I am sure there's probably something there whether it's trailer or not,
1598.32s: I have no idea. But I don't know, man, I'll give you one which I think is just more anecdotal
1606.00s: interesting. Somebody turn me on to this app, Teemo. It's like this number one app on the iPhone.
1613.68s: There's tagline, I think it's something like shop like a billionaire. And basically it's like
1617.44s: all goods from China and just basically unbelievably cheap, stupid pricing. It's like the number one
1623.76s: thing everyone's just buying things left and right. I mean, a lot of this self look kind of junky to
1627.36s: me, but whatever. That's fine. It's just a way to get very cheap items. And it's like, all right,
1632.96s: I mean, I find it interesting they were at a point now where consumers are just so desperate for
1637.60s: anything that's cheap because they probably can't afford very much with inflation and with credit
1643.20s: card rates and credit card balances. Like that to me is actually an interesting
1647.52s: contrarian signal that you have so much demand for this, you know, Teemo app and these types of
1652.80s: products because they're just people are desperate to have something because they can't afford
1658.80s: anymore. It's just going to the prior alternatives like Walmart Amazon to get their stuff.
1664.72s: Isn't it pretty crazy? I was just talking with my wife about this not too long ago though. How
1669.28s: insanely good consumers tend to have it now where if you want to buy something you literally
1676.64s: can just go on Amazon and grab it and have it sent you in a couple days or if you want somebody
1681.12s: to go get your food. There's door dashes. It's like I feel like the average person literally lives
1687.92s: like a fucking king or queen at this point compared to what it used to be. Just what you're talking
1693.76s: about with Teemo is making me think of that because there's people that can just buy cheaper goods
1698.00s: directly from China across the fucking globe now and have it shipped over which is pretty sick.
1703.20s: Yeah, yeah. And I'm about to say on that it's like people also underestimate how that convenience
1708.72s: has a price in terms of their discretionary budget. It's like oh yeah, should I just press this
1713.04s: on Instagram? I mean, it's like what what's the markup on the percentage? As opposed to just
1717.84s: taking a walk down the block and buying it, you're just having it delivered to my point. It's like
1723.12s: we're still used to these luxuries but these luxuries still have a cost to them,
1726.72s: right? Which only furthers the strain on consumer budgets at some point but they're so used to
1730.72s: now ordering and taking advantage of those luxuries that it's hard for them to walk away. They'd
1736.80s: rather just be in more debt. I could not agree with that more. I was actually just thinking about
1742.64s: that before when I was thinking about going to the grocery store and like I literally use Instacart
1748.56s: and I was just like I remember thinking like oh, I'll just order on Instacart and I was thinking like
1754.56s: since when is your time now fucking valuable? Like you can go to the damn store, dude.
1760.24s: Like but you know I it's and gets and gets and gets to exercise that. Let's take a walk.
1765.36s: Does that happen? I have been eating very much because I'm doing the FASA thing as you can
1769.20s: it is as it may be does but it's like you know and now that I have that mindset, right? I
1773.76s: talk about like being an outlier. I mean you're you're super healthy and fitness and you know for
1778.32s: me it's like all right if I have an opportunity to walk somewhere I'm gonna walk.
1781.76s: Mark? Yeah, it's super smart and I don't know I find any time that like I travel one of my favorite
1789.04s: things to do is I say jokingly but it's like to exist. Like when I was in Africa you spend a lot of
1796.08s: time just finding somewhere to go to get food. Like that is now an actual activity that takes time
1802.24s: and effort and you just kind of enjoy that and it involves a lot of movement around and what not.
1806.64s: Yeah tell me how's your FASA? I've been doing I eat one meal of day. I've done that for a
1811.68s: whole time now. Yeah it's and I do not tell anybody that I do it because like I'm fasting or I'm
1817.12s: trying to do anything I think based on my genetics it is my disposition because my uncle eats like
1823.36s: this my dad before he died ate like this. It's just how a lot of the dudes in my family are.
1829.12s: I vastly prefer I think I went through college. I was force feeding myself trying to put on size
1834.32s: because I was working out a lot like I literally was at the point where I was blending chicken
1838.08s: breast and drinking it. So I got really sick with food and how the taste how the taste of blending
1844.96s: chicken. Powerful. Packing. Terrible. As soon as I realized how dumb I was and that I should have
1850.24s: just been eating like tuna out of the packets I was the biggest village idiot that I didn't have
1855.44s: to drink blended chicken but anyways I learned quickly how dumb that is and so anyways I prefer this
1862.32s: structure personally. I'm curious how you're finding it. Yeah no I didn't know you did
1865.84s: Oman one meal a day but yeah I mean that's I started right did Oman intermittent
1870.08s: this is an extreme form intermittent fasting and I did these done a couple extended fast like gone as
1874.32s: long as four days. Well I should take that back. Technically five days but there was a little
1880.88s: you know that's what it has you know you know you know you know just have like creamer with coffee
1883.84s: because the moment you have cream kind of breaks the fast but that's why I pause there but you know
1888.48s: it's I mean I've lost quite a bit of weight I feel healthy you know it's it's I'm not done yet I
1892.96s: think it's a great lifestyle and it saves a lot of time like I'd say that's the thing that actually
1899.12s: was the most surprising part it's like people underestimate how much time they spend cooking ordering
1904.16s: eating like it's about being an outlier now if you're going to be an outlier you're going to be
1909.20s: really time efficient not just healthy if you can do both you're going to be ahead no matter what
1914.48s: right so I'm a big fan of it I think it's I think it's not health advice but I think people
1920.88s: should learn more about it I didn't learn know that much about it myself until I started doing it
1925.12s: and that's one of those things where the targeted ads on X actually worked because for whatever
1930.24s: reason I started seeing ads on intermittent fasting I was like all right let me look into it
1934.32s: start watching some YouTube videos as in podcasts and going back to the point simplest answer
1938.88s: the right one just don't eat right and you know that's yourself right I mean I'm sure you know as
1945.12s: as the day goes on once you have you that one meal you get really focused right you get this kind
1950.56s: of like superhuman abilities it just really be centered in terms of whatever you want to do and
1955.76s: it's true that the more you eat the more you get distracted right and there's a by there's
1961.84s: a lot of reason for that you go back to our ancestors it's like all right if you didn't eat for a while
1966.40s: you were caveman your body said you better go out and hunt if you're gonna let an hunt for me
1971.92s: you better be focused right so there's a lot of it's like even DNA genetic aspects to it from
1977.44s: my kind of evolutionary perspective that I think are fasting look I started doing it
1984.88s: even as it released to me as a portfolio manager of funds right nobody can control the value of
1992.00s: their portfolio I don't care what anybody says nobody knows day to day what their portfolio is
1996.80s: known right I always go back to there's no boo-roos only cycles certainly in my world the cycle I
2002.40s: need is that risk on risk off like safety sequence credit spreads widening churches working against
2007.28s: equities they're going down okay I can't control that I have to only wait for it and hope that my
2012.16s: funds with their rules based approach the signaling get get it right so when you're in the business
2018.16s: of product development bringing strategies to market like I am you recognize you can't control
2026.40s: the outcome of the portfolios you get assets because you're performing in your funds but you
2031.76s: can't control that so you actually feel pretty helpless in these periods right it's like
2037.12s: shit I'm working so hard I'm putting all this effort I'm out there I believe when I built
2042.64s: but you know it's day after day after day you're waiting for the light to change so I said myself
2048.08s: all right if I can't control the value of my portfolio if I can't control my career which is
2054.16s: dependent upon the cycle that I'm in that I operate in let me control my health let me control what
2060.32s: I'm putting into my body and then I started making a point I go out every morning I wake up at 5.30
2065.36s: in every morning and I go out and I walk the gym and I'm just every single day at no days I'll
2070.80s: go to the gym I'm doing a long walk on the gym lifting I'm doing an older age right but not
2076.32s: terribly old but you know certainly not like you right back in college I was not that kind of guy so
2083.36s: I think that mindset is helpful because at least for me it kind of keeps me seen as I'm waiting
2090.56s: I think well and it's also very stoic of you right because I I'm a huge
2096.24s: studia of stoicism I came across it mostly during
2100.48s: covid marine officers we always like to think we're still exposed but most of us don't know what the
2104.88s: fuck it is um but I started studying a lot and it talks a lot about sphere of control right which
2110.96s: is exactly what you're talking about there but one of the things I find really fulfilling with any
2115.76s: sort of like physical endeavor is that once you can literally force your comfort seeking
2121.60s: sign of your mind into submission to literally submit to your will it's actually very powerful
2127.36s: because you start to realize how frequently on a day to day basis you are just acting off of
2132.40s: subconscious impulses because your body is trying to offload as much thought as possible atomic
2138.80s: habits goes into a lot of this which is a great book by James clear but yeah I'm actually really
2144.48s: stoked for you because I think there's a lot of great things that come out of that and then I mean
2148.40s: working out just for resilience like literally just you don't have to be like super strong or
2151.84s: anything if you don't want to be just for general resilience is good and yeah I I think that that's
2158.00s: a massive change that somebody can make in their life now before we pivot too far away from the
2164.00s: funds stuff I did want to talk to you about that because that is one of my favorite things to
2168.64s: pick your brain on because that's not something I've done right I've been a retail trader of my whole
2172.96s: life so I am completely ignorant to that world when you are deciding your funds did you have a
2182.32s: thought that yes I'm gonna make this fund this fund and this fund or is it more of a oh this
2189.20s: one seems like a good idea and then it sprouts the next idea and like so yeah okay so good question
2194.88s: so so ideally this is now from the business side of things right I'm an entrepreneur right and
2200.56s: I did launch my funds at these acro time because the cycle didn't favor the risk off after
2204.80s: your set of treasuries last two years the idea is you want to build a fund family right so
2210.72s: diversification is not just about what you're trading if if you're an entrepreneur you ideally want
2215.12s: to have a diversified number of funds because the reality is going back to you can't control the
2221.04s: cycle all right you want to ideally have I hate to say it this way but it's truth you always want
2226.16s: to have something that can sell like that's just the reality meaning something that is likely to
2231.52s: perform well while other things are maybe not performing as well you're trying to build you're
2235.52s: trying to get assets you're trying to get people to pay attention that's what all these fun
2238.96s: complexes do they have multiple funds and a cycle doesn't favor one asset class but the other
2243.84s: asset class works okay so I want to I always want to build out a fund family the the commonality
2249.92s: although funds is that they all rely on treasuries right which you can argue with my critical flaw in
2257.12s: the development but it's all for good reason based on the hindsight data of how treasuries tend to act
2263.68s: right against activities but the signaling actually tends to be different so I design the other
2270.24s: funds to have a correlation that's fairly low against each other so I've got my mutual fund
2274.96s: attacks by 2TS for Roro and Jojo on the indices for Roro and Jojo against the attacks to look at
2282.00s: the fuller history the correlation when I ran it was about 0.33 so I was trying to create a fun
2287.92s: family that was inherently risk-on-risk off in content but actually not that correlated to each other
2292.56s: except when you're in the real risk off periods where they would likely all be in treasuries and play
2298.40s: defense right it's challenging to bring three funds to market which have a correlation of 2.33
2308.40s: to each other at least you know based on that history and then be in the one period where they're
2315.44s: correlated to each other because again they rely on treasuries right I'm hopeful that's over but
2324.32s: you know this it was a purposeful decision on mine now I designed all my strategies to avoid
2329.68s: large drawdowns and equities in the risk-on asset by being in treasuries during those drawdowns
2335.44s: I did not avoid I did not design the funds to avoid drawdowns and treasuries
2341.20s: by the way that's nearly impossible to try to avoid drawdowns in both systematically because
2345.44s: almost never happens that's just fact right pre-voker post-voker it doesn't matter I can show you
2351.36s: the data on that right so and if I could do that then I have a perfect strategy because it means like
2356.64s: you know we never have a drawdown basically if you can constantly kind of wiggle between the two
2361.52s: so brutal period by the way every asset class at some point goes to a lost decade
2370.80s: I don't care if it's commodities I don't care if it's gold that's part of commodities I don't
2375.04s: care if it's bonds like we've seen already I don't care if it's equities how many lost
2379.20s: decades has the S&P had as the NASDAQ have like everything and by the way active strategy has lost
2383.84s: decades so I went through a nasty drawdown out of the gate with what happened with Roto and Jojo
2390.88s: in particular because I launched them just before this treasury you know nasty bear market started
2394.96s: the signals were right to say risk off but risk off didn't work treasure didn't work and it's rules
2400.24s: based now I am stupidly optimistic because I think the cycle's gonna come my way could be wrong
2408.88s: just like I've been wrong about the credit event so far but I know that every day that goes by I'm
2412.64s: closer to being right that's what keeps me optimistic and now combined with the fasting and health
2417.60s: it's like all right I'm even more energized like physically right it's like yeah let's go I'm ready
2422.80s: to go I'm ready for this thing to start picking up again Roto has done very well this year it's up
2426.56s: I think here today like 25 26 percent right even though I haven't had the risk off period if I get
2431.60s: a risk off period which may still happen in to December all right we'll see you know it'll surprise a
2436.24s: lot of people not me because I know how this can work but but fear going back to your
2440.48s: resurrection you know you think about it from a business perspective you know you want to have
2444.40s: multiple products that are not correlated to each other on the hope that at least one of them will work
2448.72s: it so happens in the cycle none of them worked now how did you align that you wanted to stick to long
2456.96s: only versus either shorting or using derivatives because to me it does seem like
2463.20s: the more pure style hedge at least if you know we want to hedge downside from a long delta portfolio
2470.96s: or something like that so how did you think about that yeah so it's actually interesting
2477.52s: interesting to talk to I would argue that you don't want to have a perfect hedge you don't want
2486.08s: a perfect hedge would be what perfect hedge would be you know inverse my shorting okay what's the
2492.00s: problem with having a perfect hedge make your time that's be perfect right it's like you know the
2498.72s: exact mile mark or something's gonna happen so you take a directional bet okay if you do any kind of
2505.36s: a long series back test I don't care what signals you're using right what happens is you will
2512.40s: inevitably get a full signal a type 2 error right meaning your signals have play defense
2518.80s: and the market goes higher okay so if you're in a type 2 error in a full signal and you're short
2525.20s: you lose money one for one the perfect hedge hits you because your timing was wrong right same
2531.92s: problem with cash by the way right but it's like why do the studies show that market timing doesn't
2536.80s: work using cash this cash has no momentum so if you're wrong the market goes higher
2542.48s: you're missing out you're not compounding right that's why studies show market timing does
2546.48s: the work versus my goals right whereas if instead you use an imperfect hedge which will go back to
2554.16s: things which benefit historically from stock market volatility not direction volatility the
2559.76s: flight to safety trades of gold the dollar utilities treasuries themselves you can be wrong
2566.72s: in the timing meaning you could play defense in either one of those four and the market goes higher
2572.64s: but you can still make money because you're not inverse equities right so it's really the function
2580.00s: of and it's just come from my years of just back testing strategy development in general the
2584.88s: opportunity set with which you express being wrong will matter more than being right right and
2591.60s: yeah you can be really right when you're short and I'm sure a lot of people I'm sure you
2594.88s: included make some good money when you're making a directional bet but if you're going to try and
2598.32s: do that systematically over time I would argue you're going to eventually have those streaks where
2603.68s: that perfect hedge kills you perfectly and you're better off then playing something else all right now
2608.56s: I get it right if you had done shorting or cash the last two years you did way better than playing
2613.92s: defense and treasuries obviously because treasuries got killed but that's an anomaly it's an outlier
2619.60s: to be about outliers right that that doesn't happen that what we saw with treasuries is a once in
2624.48s: a multi-generation move I'd rather bet that that's going to come back to being a better hedge going
2631.20s: forward than we've ever seen you know in the last 20 years have you considered something like
2638.56s: volatility products though that you could still trade long the problem with that as you know is that
2643.92s: it's it's no different than shorting in that you're betting at time right in that case now I'm
2648.56s: keeping it complexity right I do think if if you were going to try to do something like that you want to
2654.40s: do it you want to be a lot you want to allow yourself to be wrong cheaply which means and that's
2660.56s: where you know in your world comes into play if you can get out of the money puts and they're really
2664.40s: mispriced and cheap and you get a risk off defensive signal okay that I can be I can be on board with
2669.60s: because it's not really a directional bet that's an insurance bet right that's it's a different
2674.00s: I argue that's a different kind of hedge where you're not going to lose big right for the small
2677.92s: amount with convex convex payout but you know I mean it is true that this way you never see really
2685.20s: a very rich short seller rather than Jim Chanos you know I mean who else has really kind of is out
2690.72s: there known as this kind of killer short seller that's his mandate or her mandate and they just
2695.68s: make a ton of money it's very hard to do because the timing has to be perfect go back to path
2699.84s: matters more than prediction and then let's go back to the let's go back to the November first
2703.92s: week in November point I said circa breaker was likely okay by there is a short
2710.88s: said my strategy for infresories TLT I think was up like 4% that week or something I got so you
2717.44s: wrong in the idea in the direction still a money I'll take it I was actually looking at the
2727.28s: humor of it all to be honest just to take an opportunity to put a little bit of salt
2733.84s: comedically in your wound and I started entering TLT on the second of November and then on the 13
2745.60s: yeah it's been working it's it's been very nice but it's the reason I think that's so funny
2751.84s: obviously it's just because you are following and that's that's actually why I find your approach so
2757.92s: fascinating to me with like a rules based approach because one of my arguments against retail
2762.64s: traders there's this thing where retail traders say like oh I want to be mechanical I want to
2767.44s: deploy mechanically and it's sounds so great right it sounds super cool but unfortunately I
2772.96s: genuinely don't believe that that's how that works super well as far as I can tell so I look at
2781.52s: the way that your funds are designed to perform and it is really curious how you handle uncommon
2789.60s: events like this now I don't know if you follow much of Naseem's work or just that style of thought
2797.20s: where we think uncommon events are actually far more common than we tend to price in is that
2803.28s: something that you think about with these funds in any capacity going forward or do you think that
2808.72s: will still normalize so I'm a big fan of actually Taliban Black Swan and Fulbeira and
2815.84s: Visalissa the what I would say is like the last years had been the outlier like that's just fact
2826.24s: I go back to I don't care how many people on Fin Twit Finnex on social media in the media say
2834.80s: anybody could have seen stocks and bonds with lose money how could you launch funds knowing that
2838.72s: that was going to happen I had somebody actually say that to me it's like are you kidding me it's like
2842.24s: cost 250 grand to bring a fund to market you think I want to just spend that money yeah just for fun
2848.40s: oh yeah let's just see oh maybe I'm you're wrong let me take the risk and put a 250k chip
2853.68s: right with somebody who's going to game okay so okay fine let's say anybody could have seen stocks
2859.44s: and bonds will lose money could you have said that stocks and bonds will lose money while credit
2862.96s: spreads would stay tight while default risk would not increase in the fast history of
2868.72s: high cycle industry in that dual seller you may break and nobody would say that that's crazy
2874.64s: to talk about outlier the outlier was not that stocks and bonds fell the LL was how it happened
2879.92s: the path the interaction did not come effects to credit spreads that's what made this an outlier
2886.32s: because that's why treasuries didn't counter high volatility sequences the flight to safety which
2890.48s: is what I built my funds on and no one is more tuned into that than I am because I have skin
2895.28s: in the game and I built funds that I know the research around it so I know how how anomalous that is
2899.68s: now look you do any kind of back tests on any indicator you go back to the 1920s you will always
2908.32s: have always always have periods where it's not working well wait just like you have periods where
2914.96s: buying whole lesson P is not working where's an outlier on beta you're always going to have that
2921.92s: you're oh wait I challenge and if you don't have that you were made off you've done something
2927.68s: wrong in your modeling there's no such thing as somebody having 20% 20 years of no negative
2935.04s: returns and if you do have okay then you were a probably more lucky than skillful because in any
2942.80s: statistical data is that you will always have an outlier and the outlier can be luck in our
2947.20s: business especially because you don't again you can't control your portfolio so it's skill and luck
2950.40s: so maybe it's more luck okay so when you're going through these cycles the reality is you have to just
2954.96s: take it you have to wait for it to change right and in my case I don't have a choice
2961.92s: like the funds have just respect this I designed them this way right so it's like and this is also
2968.72s: what I think the retail community when they look I mean I put myself out there a lot and I
2973.76s: communicate a lot and I'm loud and aggressive and I'm not just on social media because it gets
2976.96s: attention as I'm waiting for a cycle to change it's just the reality I have to play that game I keep
2980.96s: saying it's a persona because anybody look at the funds would say why should I listen to this guy who's
2985.28s: this professional C.F.H. Charterholder but man he can make me laugh like that's the it was a
2990.08s: communication bet when I did that that put it but when you're going through that hell you've got to
2994.32s: keep going through it right now if you're a retail trader and you're going through a streak where
2998.96s: it's not working you have the luxury to step away you have the luxury to not have a mandate
3006.24s: when you're in the business of investing and your fiduciary and you have a strategy that you
3010.48s: hope will be different than every other strategy that's out there and competes against a very
3016.32s: crowded mutual fund and ETF space you can't do that right you're designing something for a particular
3024.08s: environment that you may not be in but at some point will come right so you don't actually have
3030.80s: the question what do you do not much you just have to wait and hope now it's like people say hope
3038.80s: is not a strategy it's like no I disagree I hope it's not an equifix strategy if you don't have hope
3043.84s: as part of your as part of the mindset of a strategy how can you wait for the turn to come your way
3048.56s: well it also dismisses the concept of luck if somebody thinks that there's no hope which
3058.16s: I would definitely argue against we're coming up on time here but I do want to catch you with one
3064.72s: more question before we go looking back over 2023 a lot of interesting things happen and I feel like
3072.08s: you put out a lot of content that talks about a lot of those events but I want to pivot us to 2024
3078.72s: is there anything in particular as we look into the next year that you're interested in or that you
3084.72s: think could be an interesting catalyst or an event to watch so I historically it is true that small
3092.40s: caps tend to underperform in pre-election years not to the extent that we've seen this year
3098.64s: the magnitude but it's true that pre-election years large caps do tend to outperform small caps
3103.36s: in election years though which is what next year is small caps do tend to outperform large
3108.00s: so I think from an asset allocation perspective there is an argument to be made that next year will
3114.00s: not be the year the magnitude seven that there will be the it'll be the year smid small mid cap
3119.36s: so it's like if you're going to play equities the catch-up trade which everyone talks about probably
3123.28s: does manifest right next year the question becomes the sequence in other words does it happen
3131.92s: at the start of the year or after some kind of you know capitulation credit event which I still
3136.24s: think is the more likely near-term scenario right but I think that's probably the real area to kind
3143.12s: of pay attention to right it's just that play the laggards that's probably going to be the biggest leader
3150.64s: I also think that there will be a lot of demand and money rotating
3158.40s: anyway from a sector perspective into anything that's dividend oriented right so dividend as you
3165.04s: know dividend stocks have not been well all relative basis utility have gotten smashed
3168.96s: relative to the smp why because you know utilities and high dividend paying sector has been competing
3174.00s: against the Fed as far as income goes same thing with consumer stable same thing with with
3178.40s: healthcare blue shifts if Fed is done which it seems like they are and if you get any kind of heightened
3185.36s: volatility you would expect that defensive sectors which are high dividend paying sectors utility
3191.36s: stable now care probably get some relative strength as well so there's two trade it's right there's
3196.32s: the defensive sector allocation from large cap side utility stable health care and then there's
3200.80s: the cap rotation from a small cap side right which I think both can work the thing I most
3208.16s: confident in which I could totally wrong on is that we're probably not going to see this large cap
3213.60s: dominance like we've seen you know the last you that that that part of this cycle is probably towards
3221.20s: the ends doesn't mean that we're going to all collapse it just means it's going to be finally rotational
3228.64s: and hopefully allows those that are actually benchmarking us the smp to beat the smp because guess
3234.88s: what you can't beat the smp as an asset okay or if it's the only game in town you want to you
3239.20s: need to have other asset classes leading and outperforming that's been what's been so maddening
3243.28s: about this cycle because it's been old market cap at seven-starred striped mold them that's not
3248.72s: just me saying that by the way I talk to financial advisors all day long that's them saying it's like
3253.20s: any kind of diversification is sucked this year it has not been a free lunch all right it's been a vomit
3260.24s: yeah and I feel like that's the nature of diversification right there's always an opportunity to
3265.92s: cost associated with it I am curious to see how tech continues to perform I'm glad that you
3271.04s: highlight that and then also small caps for anybody that follows like my youtube channel I trade Iwm
3277.76s: a lot so I definitely am kind of looking for a very similar movement as you're talking about
3284.64s: which I actually find interesting for that thesis but Mike you're always super gracious with your
3289.44s: time and I'm stoked to have chat with you I'll throw links to kind of everything that you have in
3294.56s: the notes below but for the people on the youtube channel side of things if you have a specific spot
3300.08s: that they can reach out to you where's that yeah I mean on all the major socials at Lee Lagerport
3305.20s: on x youtube and scrim leadlagerport.com also on substacking and the funds which are separate I
3310.64s: always stress two legal entities atackfunz.com with the caveat that the funds have not done well but
3318.32s: you know there's a I was back to meaner version is the only thing you can say is close to guaranteed
3327.28s: nothing's ever guaranteed a market the closest thing to a guarantee you can argue is meaner version
3332.64s: now you can pay where the mean is right where the average is but it's like meaner version is a
3338.08s: concept that's as old as the bible I always go back to this analogy he was first shall be
3342.64s: last and last first is meaner version that which lag leads that which leads lags right that goes to
3351.20s: sectors market cap also goes to funds so I'm hopeful that my meaner version for those strategies
3357.28s: is about to kick in but I'm sure either way whether it does or doesn't I'm still going to have
3362.00s: people I'm going to block on x relentless that sounds about right and I will be there enjoying
3369.04s: the show as I typically do otherwise but like thanks so much for hanging out man thanks for being
3373.84s: on the podcast and for everybody else check out the notes below and you'll be able to find them on
3378.40s: all those different spots but till next time we'll catch you later man.
