0.00s:  Sweet. What is up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers and I got my friend Michael
6.56s:  Guyhead from lead lag slash the attack sphere of ETFs. You and I have, you know, known each other
13.92s:  for a while now. I always love getting a chance to pick your brain, talk about markets and whatnot.
18.64s:  So first off, welcome on Stoke to Have You Here, man.
22.08s:  Dude, you are the outlier. So I'm stoked to be on it. Come on now.
26.64s:  You know, I feel like somebody was telling me about this thing of like manifestation,
33.52s:  which it's always been so weird to me, right? To like just think of something and then all of a
38.80s:  sudden it happens and I've tried it and it's not fucking working. So maybe I need a manifest
44.56s:  harder and then I can become like an actual outlier and be like one of these dudes with a $200
48.64s:  million yacht. But you know, we're working on it. At least we'll talk about it.
53.28s:  I'm trying to manifest a credit event if you haven't noticed it. This is not been working
57.76s:  apparently either on my end. I guess that's actually like really true. I'm laughing pretty hard
64.16s:  at that because if I look back across your Twitter feed, it is filled with said what a great
69.84s:  spot to start. So for the people at least from my audience that might not be familiar with your,
76.24s:  I don't want to call it an obsession, but we'll call it in an obsession with a credit event.
80.56s:  What is the thesis behind this? Because for those that don't know, I've actually read pretty much
86.48s:  all of your white papers and the stuff that you think about, it's not like a lot of people
92.16s:  speak in hyperbole for attention, right? And you get it, you know, there's always some showmanship.
97.36s:  But when I read through your stuff, it's like very clear that you were connecting dots.
103.68s:  Talk to me about the credit event.
105.36s:  No, no, and well, and the showmanship and loudness on X is obviously not like the real professional
110.72s:  stuff that I put out there. I mean, look, first of all, it's funny because people forget that I
116.64s:  was bullish at the start of the year. I was saying melt up. There was a whole thread I
120.64s:  pointed out, January 13. I said melt up or crash and yes, was the answer in putting the post. I said
129.60s:  that Fin Twitt can't understand path. I believe we see both this year, right? So I was saying,
134.88s:  you're going to have a melt up because it's pre-election years, but towards the end of the year,
138.80s:  there would be a heightened risk of a credit event, which, you know, would be in response to the
144.40s:  lag the facts of the fastest, greatest rate hike cycle in history. Okay, now, I think I've been
152.32s:  right and wrong as is the case with most things in the way that it's played out.
158.16s:  You did have a melt up, but only in large cap tech. So you can say, okay, that was right.
163.84s:  You did not have a melt up and everything else. The S&P 493, small caps, retailers, Europe,
169.36s:  emerging markets. There's been no melt up outside of those large cap names. So I'd say that I was
174.48s:  actually very wrong in that melt up argument. And the whole melt up argument at the start of the
177.60s:  year was it's pre-election year. Pre-election years are factually historically the strongest of
183.28s:  the cycle. Now, let's talk about the credit event. Credit event is not some scary term.
191.44s:  Credit event just means a VIX spike. That's all it is. So when you look at the VIX volatility index
199.12s:  and you overlay credit spreads, you tend to see those are one for one relationship,
203.12s:  meaning as the VIX spikes, credit spreads tend to widen, not my opinion. VALTODY is seen by the
209.60s:  bond market as increasing de-falt risk. So yeah, part of the thesis was at some point the lag
215.12s:  defects would kick in the Fed likely over Titans, which by the way, now, long-gravation yields are
220.32s:  telling you that they did, which we can maybe touch on in the last several weeks here. Instead,
226.48s:  you ended up having a credit event in Treasuries, which I then changed my tune and saying that's
233.04s:  phase one, but a corporate credit event phase two is not yet happened. I thought it would start
239.60s:  entering November. Now, the reason I said at the end of October that the first week in November,
244.16s:  you could see circuit breakers, which I was able to say was way wrong on, right, was credit spreads
248.72s:  were starting to widen. Okay, the VIX was at a point in the exact 21. It was at the point where it's
253.68s:  like, it was going to break out and spike. It's around this level. So let me make a communication,
258.00s:  bet and say, okay, well, what if I'm right? And it's so happened in my own funds. The signal said,
262.72s:  the intresuries. Treasuries worked that week. No circuit breaker, best week of the year for the S&P.
269.76s:  And then you had this drift and everyone's super bold up, right? But I don't think the credit event
274.72s:  risk has gone away. Maybe my timing, not maybe obviously my timing has been off in putting a spotlight
281.76s:  on it for entry November. But we don't know where these legs actually start to impact the economy
288.72s:  in the stock market. I mean, you're already seeing now in housing. You're starting to see the housing
292.24s:  side break down finally on home sales and pricing. But to say that just because it hasn't happened in
299.20s:  a single month, which I thought was higher risk, that the risk is still not there to me as silly.
303.68s:  Because the thesis has not changed. There are lags. We went through the faster rate cycle
307.36s:  in history. At some point that will manifest the manifestation, probably manifest in an ugly way.
314.08s:  But path matters more than prediction. I've been wrong. Having that silly made money or lost money,
319.36s:  or I should say, on that, because if you were in treasuries the last month, you'd be great. Treasuries
326.40s:  would have been the credit event way to trade it anyway. So it's fine. But it just goes to show you
332.24s:  how this is a business where it's a fine line between being wrong and being early.
339.28s:  Yeah. Well, and I also think it's interesting that you look a lot at path dependency because I find
345.28s:  in markets, I have a stats background. And I spend a lot of time looking at these things as well,
350.40s:  because I find them interesting. And sometimes I feel like the path can be misleading when it's
358.16s:  overlaid with some of these unnatural add-ons, specifically like you're talking about a lot of the
365.28s:  feds actions, which I've always been so curious how to even think about that. Because we've never seen
371.36s:  anything like this before. So it's like how can you think about applying typical path dependency
377.76s:  into this kind of environment? How do you think about that when there's like truly anomalous
381.52s:  conditions like this? No, no, no, and actually you're hitting on why I just, the reality is nobody
388.08s:  knows. Not me, not you, not anybody else's thing, right? Because we've never seen anything like this,
392.56s:  the fastest rate hike cycle in this way, right? So even the fed can't model out the legs. They
399.04s:  themselves have admitted that. And that's my point. It's like if we agree that we've never seen anything
406.88s:  like what we've gone through. Then maybe it's bullish, maybe it's bearish. But one thing is that
413.92s:  I can say for certain is that it's not certain, right? And that's sort of the mindset. It is funny
420.56s:  to me, the I get all this anger and hatred for pointing out people say you're a perma bearer,
426.48s:  it's like no, again, if you have an IQ greater than 80, you can see that a funny time has been bullish
431.76s:  in the past. But unless the thesis has changed and the thesis has always been around the legs,
437.92s:  I guess the magnitude of the rate hike, I still think the risk is there. The fact that so many
442.64s:  people seem to think it's not just because it didn't happen in November, which was a monster month,
447.04s:  which by the way, plenty of bear markets have monster months. To me is like, I don't know,
452.64s:  that seems like that's the set up for how you have a credit event when nobody's thinking can
455.92s:  happen again, right? When the risk seems to have gone away. This is having two roles with which
460.24s:  trust me kind of crazy. So a lot of noise was made about the Dow Jones Duster average on a total
465.84s:  return basis medium highs. So it's a bull market there, right? Okay. I keep them back to yes,
472.72s:  technically that reset the drawdown in the down. You're still in the drawdown for the Nasdaq,
477.04s:  you're still in the drawdown for small cash, still in the drawdown for the S&P. Okay, but
483.44s:  what about inflation? Right? I mean, that prior peak for the Dow for the S&P for the Nasdaq from 2021,
493.20s:  it's not in nominal terms. What's the real level, the after inflation level? You still need,
498.40s:  like another 12% from here for the Nasdaq to technically be at the real after inflation at just
503.76s:  the high from 2021. I'm not saying it can happen. I'm just saying for all intents and purposes,
509.28s:  we're still in the drawdown because still being a bear market. And you only know if you're in a
513.92s:  new bull market after you've taken out the prior peak, which means you only know if it's with hindsight.
519.28s:  Right? But again, credit events tend to end bear markets. If it spikes tend to end bear markets,
525.60s:  you have not had that inequities. And if I'm right, that the credit event is still out there that
530.88s:  we're still in a bear market, it's going to frustrate the help a lot of people and that's what stocks do.
536.40s:  That I couldn't agree more with. So thinking about the credit event possibility still,
542.96s:  the way that things have been folded thus far, what are the primary catalysts that you see on
548.40s:  the horizon that could kind of capitulate us down that route? So there really are like a legit
554.56s:  number of catalysts, right? I mean, ones that have been talked bad and ones that are not getting as
558.64s:  much attention. So obviously, there's the commercial real estate side of things. I don't think it's
565.20s:  going to be as big of a catalyst because that's not all at once. China could still be a catalyst
570.56s:  with the real estate crash that's going on there. Our own housing market could be a catalyst,
575.52s:  right? If that kind of creates a sort of self-fulfilling cell cycle, everyone seems to assume that
581.44s:  you have to go back to 3% mortgage rates to unlock this kind of lock-in effect. It's like, it's not true.
587.52s:  Well, you go, mortgage is about 5%, you're going to have people selling, you're going to have 5%
590.96s:  they're going to sell. They're going to unleash because the reality is, yeah, they're
594.48s:  locked into their home, which means they're also locked into home insurance rates.
598.24s:  Like that's going up. You can see that with the storage on Florida,
602.96s:  right? All these home prices, you know, went through the roof or these property prices went through
607.28s:  the roof there. I have this lock-in rate with little rates, but the insurance costs are going
610.96s:  through the roof, so it's like, all right, what do you do? I mean, you're going to keep on paying
614.96s:  the insurance, you're going to try and sell just because you have a 3% is that enough? So that could
619.04s:  be a catalyst. I still think Japan is the real big catalyst, right? If they're going to try to
624.80s:  hold normalize their own policy because of inflation, you're talking about a country that has been a
631.20s:  source of leverage for the entire world for 30 years. Now tinkering with monetary policy and a more
639.44s:  aggressive tightening type of way, that could still be a catalyst, but the point is it could be
645.84s:  something nobody sees coming, but the condition for whatever it does come still relates to the
652.96s:  fastest rate-high cycle in history and the lag, right? That's all I'm trying to stress by
660.96s:  providing a different way of thinking about it. Now, you and I both know, having a thesis is one
667.20s:  thing trading is a whole different thing, right? And I make this point continuously, I do not believe
674.00s:  in shorting. I do not believe in going into cash. I do not believe in buying puts. For me, and I've
680.48s:  said this as outlined in the papers, the risk off expression is still to be exposed to something
686.88s:  on the long-only side, right? And outside of the options market, the way you do that is by either
693.12s:  being long gold, which is working, being long treasuries, which is starting to work, being long
698.48s:  the dollar, which has worked the longest as a risk off trade, or being long utilities on
702.88s:  a relative basis, right? That's your risk off. Up to you said, right? So you can be bearish and be
710.08s:  long those, be wrong being bearish, but still make money. You can be bearish, be long, or those,
716.08s:  and make money. But the point is that it's not a guarantee either way, and that's why it tends to be
722.00s:  a better way of expressing defense than making an outright directional bet saying stocks are going to
726.24s:  go down credit event, shorted if you have conviction. I don't have conviction in the mile marker,
730.48s:  I have conviction in the conditions. Right? The catalyst could be the pebble on the road that nobody
736.64s:  sees as they're driving. You're not going to swerve because you can't see that catalyst, but you
741.84s:  know that you need to already be slowing down before that pebble hits you. I think the way you
747.92s:  described it there makes a lot of sense too, in that it's not necessarily what is the last thing
753.52s:  that tips us over, but we're at a point where any one of those things potentially could.
758.56s:  So when we look at something like the housing market, and I was looking at something where like,
764.56s:  you know, back in the 80s, the median home price was like 3.7 times that of the median income.
771.92s:  And as of November, it's like five and a half to six times the median income.
778.00s:  What role do you think the housing market plays in the way that this unwind occurs if any?
787.84s:  So even the Fed has said that the wealth effect is most powerful when it comes to housing.
794.72s:  Right? I mean, we talk about the stock market and the wealth effect for stocks, but the reality is
798.88s:  it's most people's asset is their home. We're privileged to be able to trade and own stocks and
805.12s:  to play that game, but the reality is most people don't. Their wealth is their home. Okay, so to
811.28s:  the extent that housing appreciates, it makes them feel more confident. They spend more. If housing
816.16s:  depreciates and makes them less confident, there's a reverse wealth effect. They start pairing back.
821.12s:  Right? You haven't seen that yet because housing is only now starting to roll over. I've been
826.00s:  early on that, by the way, I said, because there's a housing is not going to use the word, but as in trouble,
830.48s:  obviously I've been wrong on that. But again, fine line between being wronged early.
833.84s:  Plenty of people were wrong in 2006, warning of a great financial crisis. At the housing peak back then,
840.24s:  they were wrong until they were right. Right? Which is just two-year-old leg, right? From the 2008.
846.16s:  So if housing is going to keep on weakening, if there is going to be this depreciation,
852.40s:  yeah, that's going to challenge the consumer. That's going to challenge small caps.
858.00s:  It's going to challenge the likelihood of zombie companies, which have high leverage and low margin,
864.64s:  to keep up with higher costs of capital because the revenue so I guess challenge as people spend less.
870.56s:  That's not a perma bear argument that's causing effects.
874.56s:  Right? Now, maybe that doesn't happen. Maybe housing holds or goes sideways. Maybe it's a correction in time.
880.64s:  Okay, it's possible. But typically, extremes don't resolve them self-sides.
888.24s:  Right? And the appreciation post-COVID in housing is an extreme or an annualized basis.
894.48s:  Right? Nationwide. So let's see. I think that is a headwind for a while. Again,
902.88s:  maybe it's a catalyst, maybe not. It's not a catalyst in the same way as what you saw in the 2008
908.00s:  financial crisis. But as a catalyst that breaks consumer spirits, yeah, I don't see why not.
916.48s:  Do you factor things like auto sales coming down or things like credit card defaults going up?
926.08s:  I actually, the beginning of this earnings cycle, I trade earnings, right? So I'm an options trader.
931.60s:  So unlike you, I have no loyalty long short, whatever it is, dog, I'm there.
937.12s:  But I did notice when the banks were reporting, I always like to read through their reports because
942.00s:  you get a lot of information and they have a really significant spike in credit write-offs
947.76s:  from people defaulting. Do things like that factor into your thesis as well? Are those just
952.16s:  kind of just additional supporting metrics that move us further along this path?
956.64s:  Yeah, I think it's supporting it goes back to that point with the legs, right? It's like,
960.80s:  look, it takes time to change a habit. I mean, you know this yourself, right? I mean, given the
966.08s:  CSS you've had in your life and your career. So if it takes time to change habits, consumers don't
970.96s:  change their spending habits overnight. It takes many months of seeing the minimum payment on the
974.96s:  credit card rising and takes many months of them seeing the minimum just in general, just how much
981.36s:  the rates are rising for that to actually impact how they're spending. So and then suddenly they're
986.16s:  surprised by it and then the link would see you start to kick in, right? It's like I use that line
990.32s:  slowly, then all of a sudden continuously because that's how this works. It's like slow burden,
996.32s:  then suddenly the fire is there. So I think all that is supportive of the idea that yeah,
1001.36s:  the credit side is straining consumers, right? And again, it maybe it doesn't resolve itself in an
1007.92s:  event. Maybe it's just a long drawn out, you know, pressure problem for the economy, but to deny
1015.36s:  the cause and effect of rates on consumer spending. And by the way, on retailer stocks which have
1020.08s:  been telling you for the entire year, consumers are strained for all the narratives around how strong
1024.88s:  the consumer is, tell me why retailer stocks have gone sideways in a pre-election you. Tell me why
1030.56s:  small cash which are more sensitive to domestic economy have gone sideways. I get the regional bank,
1036.40s:  you know, effective. But like even the stock side is telling you that these delinquencies are
1042.48s:  are only starting. So how else do you explain the performance being so poor on a relative basis to
1047.36s:  the S&P to the NASDAQ? So yeah, I think I think it's foolish to argue that we're in an expansion phase
1055.84s:  just because the Fed is now maybe done hiking rates because history shows that when the Fed is pivoting,
1063.28s:  it's a contraption phase. It's not an expansion phase. It doesn't have to be, it's not every time,
1068.16s:  but this is game of probabilities. So volatility should be increasing. Dillon Quixie are the first step to that.
1075.28s:  Did you see Powell statements today when he was talking about he doesn't necessarily, he thinks it's,
1080.96s:  I don't want to misquote him too bad, but the paraphrase was that it's too early to say that hikes
1088.00s:  are gone. What did you make of that? Is he just playing hardball as per usual or because to me,
1094.16s:  I looked immediately at bonds to see what they thought and they think he's full of shit, but you know,
1099.20s:  No, no, no, it's actually interesting, right? The moral swation is a tool for the Fed.
1107.60s:  Right, words are a tool because the obviously impact rates. I suspect that Powell probably is concerned
1116.32s:  about the stock market running away, to some extent. Why? Because if the stock market keeps pushing
1123.76s:  higher, it will delay the disinflation that comes from housing. So one of the arguments for why I
1129.44s:  think housing has been stubborn on the upside is because a lot of people saying, okay, yes,
1134.72s:  the mortgage rates have been present. That's fine, but I got in video.
1138.80s:  Like they view their stock portfolio as something that can help pay off those mortgage, higher
1143.68s:  mortgage payments. So I suspect that Powell does not want to see the stock market in a enormous
1150.80s:  melt of phase because that's going to cause all kinds of other liquidity and flationary pressure
1155.44s:  and then cause them to have to hike rates again. So I do think it's a game of trying to just
1159.36s:  manage expectation on his end. Now to your point about the bond market saying he's full of shit.
1164.40s:  Of course he's full of shit. Of course he's full of shit. He's full of shit because he can't tell
1167.92s:  the future better than nobody else. I mean, if you look at headlines of Fed projections for
1173.92s:  hikes in 2018 to 2019, they were expecting four hikes and then they ended up cutting instead.
1181.68s:  It's like the Fed doesn't know what's going to happen next either.
1186.48s:  But and the Fed is a follow. I always go back to that point. The Fed doesn't own the bond market.
1191.20s:  The bond market owns the Fed. The fact that the long duration side is acting like this. Okay, yes,
1195.92s:  it's over. It was oversold. Yes, it was due to bounce. Right. And I stress that long duration
1200.88s:  trade finally kicking in the Phoenix rising idea of the flight to safety has not happened yet because
1205.12s:  credit spreads haven't widened yet. But it does seem like the long duration side is saying the Fed
1212.48s:  definitely over tightened, which means that he can say that they're not done hiking rates.
1218.72s:  But at the end of the day, the Fed is the bond market's bitch. I'd say that way, but that's just
1223.36s:  the truth. The long duration size of it. Right. Before we move on from the credit event, there is
1229.20s:  somebody in the chat from the Twitter space that was saying, can you share two to three concrete
1234.48s:  examples of what a literal credit event would look like? So any VIX spike, I'd say above 30,
1244.64s:  you can see that. So if you go to, if you use Google, Fred, right. And then VIX and then OAS,
1251.12s:  Fred VIX OS, those three terms, I think is the first link that shows up. You'll see that chart
1257.20s:  that overlays the VIX against credit spreads and then the shaded areas of recession.
1264.16s:  And you'll see, again, there's a one for one relationship. Right. So you know, it's like if you're
1269.44s:  going to be mathematical about it, it's literally just just that, right. You had a credit event with
1273.52s:  COVID, you had a credit event in 2008, you had a credit event in 2011 with a summer crash.
1280.40s:  You had a brief look like a little bit like a credit event in November, December 2018.
1286.08s:  But basically at any time you have a significant VIX spike, that's basically where credit
1289.60s:  event is because you see spreads widen. Right. Again, it's, if you believe, I put that poll
1297.52s:  out yesterday, I said, if you, as I do believe that you're going to see a VIX spike in the next three
1301.84s:  months, and something like 70% of people said yes. The next post down, I said in that, is if you
1307.84s:  believe that you're going to see a VIX spike, you have to believe in the credit event thesis.
1312.00s:  Because it's the same argument, you're not going to get a VIX spike in Spread State tight.
1316.24s:  That's not how it works. Right. That's that's my, that's my point of this. Again, I've been wrong
1322.00s:  on the timing. I don't think I'm wrong in the reasoning. Well, and I think some people,
1329.20s:  at least based on the way that this person was asking that question, it looks like their name is
1333.92s:  bull for now. I kind of get, I kind of get the sense by the way that they ask the question that
1340.08s:  sometimes people, when you, when you say something like credit event, sometimes it feels like people
1346.56s:  are thinking like they're going to see fire in the sky in that it's going to be end of days.
1353.36s:  Yeah, and of course, right. No, I've said this many times before. It's like, if I'm right,
1358.72s:  there was still an a bear mark, which I know sounds crazy, especially now. A credit event ends
1362.64s:  it. A VIX spike ends it because historically, bear markets do end with a bang. The end with a
1368.16s:  capitulate or removed, speaking about like tech analysis. Well, yeah, I always poke fun at the squiggles.
1373.76s:  I say I use that term, the basement traders using squiggles, right? Okay, fine. Something
1377.76s:  to make it a tech analysis. I'm just against things you can't back test. Right. And most of these
1382.64s:  in quotes squiggles, you can't back test. But one thing which is very well known that you can't
1386.16s:  back test is extremes. Right. The capitulation that happens at the end of a downtrend.
1392.80s:  The capitulation is VIX spike. The capitulation is a credit event. It's where junk debt
1398.56s:  falls apart relative to AAA. We have not had that in equities. It's just fact, maybe we don't
1407.52s:  in which case I'll be wrong. But probably, realistically, I think it's a higher possibility than not.
1416.16s:  Now, if I'm right about that, that brings back what I've used that line before. You know,
1419.92s:  to save treasuries, you have to crash stocks. Right. And people seeing the treasury move the last
1425.68s:  month, they're saying, Oh, obviously, it shows you wrong. No, it doesn't because the top 1% of
1429.12s:  the clients on using daily data for the S&P treasuries are positive in the biggest decline for stocks.
1434.56s:  I mean, it's just fact. So if I'm right about that VIX spike that credits bread wide name,
1438.72s:  which is still to come, okay, then you know what? Yeah, you're going to see some really interesting
1445.52s:  movement in defensive areas in advance because those tend to move prior to that occurring.
1450.80s:  And you're going to see junk debt breakdown, which would be a great opportunity to buy into junk debt.
1457.76s:  Like, I want to see a credit event selfishly, not just because, you know,
1461.92s:  Candle for my own funds, they're designed to play the flight to safety trade in treasuries, which
1467.36s:  is an idea. The credit event is kind of needed for that to kind of get shot back into place.
1471.04s:  But I want to buy cheaper levels on the risk on side who wouldn't. I don't know. I am bluntly,
1477.28s:  it's like, if you're a real investor, you want a credit event.
1482.32s:  Because times under your sign, you want to buy cheaper. It's not going to stay down. I never
1486.48s:  said it would stay down. A promo bear would say it would stay down. It's not.
1492.48s:  So there's a couple of things that I wanted to ask you about. The first one is a personal curiosity.
1501.28s:  Have you, because I know that you study a lot of relationships. I've never studied this one.
1505.84s:  I've studied tons, but I've never studied this one. Have you found any correlation between when
1511.20s:  Christmas displays come out and the performance of that company? No, although it's not easy. I
1520.24s:  I interviewed Jeff Mackey, who used to be on CBCL Adi's now covering a lot of stuff on
1526.88s:  retailer. I'm trying to remember the exact thing, but he mentioned something along those lines
1532.64s:  where there's a strong correlation between sales related to garden Christmas items. I think it was
1541.68s:  like display items for the front yard and future retail sales into the holidays.
1550.08s:  It's basically the idea is that if you end up seeing people not buying a lot of things,
1554.72s:  like lights and all these things for the front yard, that's actually a harbinger of negativity.
1559.76s:  So I don't know if that's I haven't studied it from the perspective you're asking, but it kind
1562.80s:  of reminds me a little bit of that. But is it you saw on that up here? It's now. No, I haven't.
1567.52s:  That's why I'm literally asking people because I haven't done that one yet. I'm working on a handful
1571.68s:  of other ones from this past year on different anomalies. So like I'm trying to outsource some of
1576.16s:  these questions I have. So it wouldn't surprise me if there's some effect that is like going out is,
1582.32s:  look, Phomo is always about sentiment. Sentiment's always more than just chart.
1586.64s:  That's why seasonality is a thing. That's why even moon cycles are a thing. It's ultimately about
1593.76s:  mood. So I am sure there's probably something there. Whether it's trailer or not, I have no idea.
1602.00s:  I don't know, man. I'll give you one which I think is just more anecdotal interesting.
1607.28s:  Somebody turned me on to this app team. It's like this number one app on the iPhone.
1613.44s:  It's there's tagline. I think it's something like shop like a billionaire. Basically it's like
1617.44s:  all goods from China and just basically unbelievably cheap, stupid pricing. It's like the number one
1623.76s:  thing. Everyone's just buying things left and right. I mean a lot of this self look kind of junky
1627.28s:  to me, but whatever. That's fine. It's just a way to get very cheap items. And it's like, all right.
1632.96s:  I mean, I find it interesting. They were at a point now where consumers are just so desperate for
1637.60s:  anything that's cheap because they probably can't afford very much with inflation and with credit
1643.20s:  card rates and credit card balances. Like that to me is actually an interesting contrarian signal
1649.12s:  that you have so much demand for this, you know, T-MU app and these types of products
1654.64s:  because they're just people are desperate to have something because they can't afford anymore.
1659.20s:  It's just going to the prior alternatives like Walmart Amazon to get their stuff.
1664.64s:  Isn't it pretty crazy? I was just talking with my wife about this not too long ago though. How
1669.60s:  insanely good consumers tend to have it now where if you want to buy something, you literally
1676.64s:  can just go on Amazon and grab it and have it sent to you in a couple days. Or if you want somebody
1681.12s:  to go get your food, there's door dash. It's like I feel like the average person literally lives like
1688.00s:  a fucking king or queen at this point compared to what it used to be. Just what you're talking about
1693.84s:  with T-MU is making me think of that because there's people that can just buy cheaper goods directly
1698.48s:  from China across the fucking globe now and have it shipped over which is pretty sick.
1703.52s:  Yeah, yeah. And I'm going to say on that it's like people also underestimate how that convenience has
1708.96s:  a price in terms of their discretionary budget. It's like oh yeah, should I just press this on
1713.28s:  a scar? I mean, it's like what what's the mark on the percentage? As opposed to just taking a walk
1718.40s:  down the block and buying it, you're just having it delivered to my point. It's like we're so used
1723.76s:  to these luxuries but these luxuries still have a cost to them, which only furthers the strain on
1728.32s:  consumer budgets at some point. But they're so used to now ordering and taking advantage of those
1733.92s:  luxuries that it's hard for them to walk away. They'd rather just be in more debt.
1738.00s:  I could not agree with that more. I was actually just thinking about that before when I was thinking
1744.08s:  about going to the grocery store and like I literally use Instacart and I was just like I remember
1751.04s:  thinking like oh, I'll just order it on Instacart and I was thinking like since when is your time
1755.68s:  that fucking valuable? Like you can go to the damn store, dude. But you know, I
1762.00s:  get it's an extra size that way. Let's take a walk. I have been eating very much because I'm
1768.16s:  doing the FASA thing as you can. It is. But it's like, you know, now that I have that mindset,
1773.12s:  right? I talk about like being an outlier. I mean, you're super healthy and fit and listen.
1778.08s:  You know, for me, it's like all right, if I have an opportunity to walk somewhere, I'm going to walk.
1781.76s:  Mark? Yeah, it's super smart. And I don't know, I find anytime that like I travel,
1787.76s:  one of my favorite things to do is I say jokingly, but it's like to exist. Like when I was in
1793.84s:  Africa, you spend a lot of time just finding somewhere to go to get food. Like that is now an
1800.24s:  actual activity that takes time and effort. And you just kind of enjoy that. And it involves a lot
1804.96s:  of movement around and whatnot. So yeah, tell me how's your FASA? I've been doing, I eat one meal
1810.40s:  of day. I've done that for a long time now. Yeah, it's and I do not tell anybody that I do it because
1815.76s:  like I'm fasting or I'm trying to do anything. I think based on my genetics, it is my
1821.36s:  disposition because my uncle eats like this, my dad before he died, ate like this.
1826.32s:  It's just how a lot of the dudes in my family are. I vastly prefer. I think I went through college.
1831.84s:  I was force feeding myself, trying to put on size because I was working out a lot. Like I literally
1836.24s:  was at the point where I was blending chicken breast and drinking it. So I got really sick with food.
1842.40s:  And now the taste of the taste of blending chicken. Powerful,
1846.00s:  packing, terrible. As soon as I realized how dumb I was and that I should have just been eating
1850.88s:  like tuna out of the packets, I was the biggest village idiot that I didn't have to drink blended
1856.40s:  chicken. But anyways, I learned quickly how dumb that is. And so anyways, I prefer this structure
1862.88s:  personally. But I'm curious how you're finding it. Yeah, no, I didn't know you did. Oh, man,
1866.24s:  the one meal day. But yeah, I mean, that's I started. All right. Did Oh man intermittent,
1870.00s:  it's an extreme form intermittent. And I did these done a couple of extended fasts like gone as
1874.32s:  long as four days. Well, I should take that back. Technically five days, but there was a little
1880.80s:  you know, as you know, you're not supposed to have like cream or with coffee because the moment I
1884.32s:  have cream kind of breaks the fast. But that's why I pause there. But you know, it's I mean,
1889.52s:  I've lost quite a bit of weight. I feel healthy. You know, it's it's I'm not done yet. I think it's
1893.28s:  a great lifestyle. And it saves a lot of time. Like I'd say that's the thing that actually was the
1899.28s:  most surprising part. It's like people underestimate how much time they spend cooking, ordering,
1904.16s:  eating like talking about being an outlier. Now if you're going to be an outlier, you're going to
1909.12s:  be really time efficient, not just healthy. If you can do both, you're going to be ahead no matter what.
1914.48s:  Right. So I'm a big fan of it. I think it's I think it's not health advice, but I think people
1920.88s:  should learn more about it. I didn't learn no that much about it myself until I started doing it.
1925.12s:  And that's one of those things where the targeted ads on X actually worked because for whatever
1930.24s:  reason I started seeing ads on intermittent fasting, I was like, all right, let me look into it.
1934.32s:  So watching some YouTube videos is in podcasts. At going back to the point, simplest answers,
1938.80s:  the right one. Just don't eat. And you know that's yourself, right? I mean, I'm sure as the day goes on
1946.40s:  once you have that one meal, you get really focused. You get this kind of like superhuman abilities.
1951.84s:  It just really be centered in terms of whatever you want to do. And it's true that the more you eat,
1957.60s:  the more you get distracted. Right. And there's a by there's a lot of reason for that. You go back
1963.04s:  to our ancestors. It's like, all right, if you didn't eat for a while and you were caveman,
1967.44s:  your body said you better go out and hunt. If you're going to let an hunt for me, you better be focused.
1973.60s:  So there's a lot of it. It's like even DNA genetic aspects to it from like an evolutionary perspective
1978.56s:  that I think are fasting. Look, I started doing it. Even as it released to me as a portfolio manager
1987.60s:  of funds, right? Nobody can control the value of their portfolio. I don't care what anybody says.
1994.64s:  Nobody knows day to day what their portfolio is going to do, right? I always go back to there's
1998.88s:  no boo-roos only cycles. Certainly in my world, the cycle I need is that risk on risk off like safety
2004.48s:  sequence, credit spreads, widening, treasures working against equities that are going down. Okay.
2009.60s:  I can't control that. I have to only wait for it and hope that my funds with their rules based
2013.36s:  approach, the signaling get it right. So when you're in the business of product development,
2020.96s:  bringing strategies to market like I am, you recognize you can't control the outcome of the
2026.96s:  portfolios. You get assets because you're performing in your funds, but you can't control that.
2032.72s:  So you actually feel pretty helpless in these periods, right? It's like,
2037.04s:  shit, I'm working so hard. I'm putting all this effort. I'm out there. I believe when I built
2042.64s:  but you know, it's day after day after day and you're waiting for the light to change. So I said
2047.76s:  myself, all right, if I can't control the value of my portfolio, if I can't control my career,
2053.68s:  which is dependent upon the cycle that I'm in that I operate in, let me control my health.
2059.52s:  Let me control what I'm putting into my body. And then I started making a point. I'd go out every
2063.84s:  morning, wake up at 5.30 in every morning and I go out and I walk to the gym. And I'm just
2069.60s:  every single day. I had no days off. I'm going to the gym. I'm doing a long walk on the gym,
2073.04s:  lifting, I'm doing an older age, right? But not terribly old, but you know, certainly not like you
2078.32s:  right back in college, it was not that kind of guy. So I think that mindset is helpful
2085.76s:  because at least for me, it kind of keeps me sane as I'm waiting.
2090.56s:  I think, well, and it's also very stoic of you, right? Because I'm a huge
2096.24s:  studia of stoicism. I came across it mostly during
2100.48s:  COVID. Marine officers, we always like to think we're stoics, but most of us don't know what the
2104.88s:  fuck it is. But I started studying a lot and it talks a lot about sphere of control, right?
2110.72s:  Which is exactly what you're talking about there. But one of the things I find really fulfilling
2115.36s:  with any sort of like physical endeavor is that once you can literally force your comfort,
2121.12s:  seeking sign of your mind into submission to literally submit to your will, it's actually
2126.16s:  very powerful because you start to realize how frequently on a day to day basis, you are just
2131.52s:  acting off of subconscious impulses because your body is trying to offload as much thought as
2137.92s:  possible. Atomic habits goes into a lot of this, which is a great book by James Clear. But
2143.20s:  yeah, I'm actually really stoked for you because I think there's a lot of great things that come out
2146.80s:  of that. And then I mean, working out just for resilience, like literally just you don't have to
2150.96s:  be like super strong or anything if you don't want to be just for general resilience is good.
2156.00s:  And yeah, I think that that's a massive change that somebody can make in their life.
2161.44s:  Now before we pivot too far away from the funds stuff, I did want to talk to you about that
2166.64s:  because that is one of my favorite things to pick your brain on because that's not something I've
2171.04s:  done, right? I've been a retail trader of my whole life. So I am completely ignorant to that world.
2177.28s:  When you are deciding your funds, did you have a thought that yes, I'm going to make this fund
2186.00s:  and this fund or is it more of a, oh, this one seems like a good idea. And then it sprouts the next
2192.00s:  idea and like so. Yeah, so good question. So ideally, this is now from the business side of things,
2197.92s:  right? I'm an entrepreneur, right? And I did launch my funds at these acro time because the cycle
2203.12s:  didn't favor the risk off after you set up treasuries the last two years. The idea is you
2208.64s:  want to build a fund family, right? So diversification is not just about what you're trading. If you're an
2213.52s:  entrepreneur, you ideally want to have a diversified number of funds because the reality is going back
2220.00s:  to you can't control the cycle. All right, you want to ideally have, I hate to say it this way, but
2224.96s:  it's truth. You always want to have something that can sell. That's just the reality. I mean,
2230.32s:  something that is likely to perform well while other things are maybe not performing as well.
2234.48s:  You're trying to build, you're trying to get assets, you're trying to get people to pay attention.
2238.08s:  That's what all these fun complexes do. They have multiple funds and a cycle doesn't favor one
2242.96s:  asset class, but the other asset class works. Okay, so I want to, I always want to build out a
2247.04s:  fund family. The commonality of all the funds is that they all rely on treasuries, right? Which
2254.40s:  you can argue with my critical flaw in the development, but it's all for good reason based on the
2260.64s:  hindsight data of how treasuries tend to act, right? Against activities. But the signaling
2265.68s:  actually tends to be different. So I designed the other funds to have a correlation that's fairly
2272.32s:  low against each other. So I've got my Mutevon attacks, my 2TS for Roro and Jojo.
2277.76s:  On the indices for Roro and Jojo against the attacks, look at the fuller history,
2283.20s:  the correlation when I ran it was about 0.33. So I was trying to create a fun family that was
2288.56s:  inherently risk-on-risk off in content, but actually not that correlated to each other except when
2293.28s:  you're in the real risk off periods where they would likely all be in treasuries and play
2298.40s:  defense. It's challenging to bring three funds to market, which have a correlation of 0.333
2308.64s:  to each other, at least based on that history, and then be in the one period where they're correlated
2316.08s:  to each other because again, they rely on treasuries, right? I'm hopeful that it's over,
2323.36s:  but it was a purposeful decision on mine. Now, I designed all of my strategies to avoid large
2329.92s:  drawdowns and equities in the risk-on asset by being in treasuries during those drawdowns.
2335.44s:  I did not avoid, I did not design the funds to avoid drawdowns and treasuries.
2341.20s:  By the way, that's nearly impossible to try to avoid drawdowns in both systematically,
2345.20s:  because it almost never happens. That's just fact. Pre-voker, post-voker, it doesn't matter.
2350.96s:  I can show you the data on that. If I could do that, then I have a perfect strategy because it means
2357.28s:  we'll never have a drawdown, basically, if you can constantly wiggle between the two.
2362.88s:  Roodle period, by the way, every asset class at some point goes to a lost decade.
2370.80s:  Outgairvis commodities, outgairvis gold, that's part of commodities. Outgairvis bonds,
2375.76s:  we've seen already. Outgairvis equities. How many lost decades has the S&P had as the
2380.48s:  Nasdaq had? Everything. By the way, Active Strikes has lost decades. I went through a nasty drawdown
2387.68s:  out of the gate with what happened with Roodle and Joe Joe in particular, because I launched them
2391.76s:  just before this Treasury nasty bear market started. The signals were right to save risk off,
2397.76s:  but risk off didn't work. Trishers just didn't work, and it's rules based.
2401.20s:  Now, I am stupidly optimistic, because I think the cycle is going to come my way. It could be
2408.32s:  wrong, just like I've been wrong about the credit event so far, but I know that every day that goes by,
2412.48s:  I'm closer to being right. That's what keeps me optimistic, and now combined with the fasting
2417.28s:  and health, it's like, all right, I'm more energized. Physically, it's like, yeah, let's go. I'm ready
2422.72s:  to go. I'm ready for this thing to start picking up again. Roodle has done very well this year. It's
2426.48s:  up, I think, here today, like 25, 26%. Even though I haven't had the risk off period, if I get a
2431.68s:  risk off period, which may still happen in December, we'll see. It will surprise a lot of people,
2436.80s:  not me, because I know how this can work, but fear going back to your original question,
2440.96s:  you think about it from a business perspective. You want to have multiple products that are not
2445.44s:  correlated to each other on the hope that at least one of them will work. It so happens in the cycle.
2450.64s:  None of them worked. Now, how did you align that you wanted to stick to
2456.48s:  long only versus either shorting or using derivatives? Because to me, it does seem like
2464.16s:  the more pure style hedge, at least, if we want to hedge downside from a long delta portfolio
2470.96s:  or something like that. How did you think about that? Yeah, so it's interesting to talk to.
2479.04s:  I would argue that you don't want to have a perfect hedge. A perfect hedge would be what?
2486.80s:  Perfect hedge would be inverse, my shorting. What's the problem with having a perfect hedge?
2493.68s:  You're talking about that's perfect. You know the exact mile marker, something's going to happen,
2500.40s:  so you take a directional bet. If you do any kind of a long series back test, I don't care what
2507.44s:  signals you're using. What happens is you will inevitably get a full signal, a type 2 error,
2516.16s:  meaning your signals have play defense and the market goes higher. If you're in a type 2 error
2523.52s:  in a full signal and you're short, you lose money one for one. The perfect hedge hits you because
2528.48s:  your timing was wrong. Same problem with cash, by the way. Why do the studies show that market
2536.16s:  timing doesn't work using cash? This cash has no momentum. So if you're wrong, the market goes higher,
2542.48s:  you're missing out. You're not compounding. That's why studies show market timing doesn't work.
2548.00s:  Versus my goals. Whereas if instead you use an imperfect hedge, which would go back to things
2554.40s:  which benefit historically from stock market volatility, not direction, volatility, the flight
2560.00s:  to safety trades of gold, the dollar, utilities, treasuries themselves, you can be wrong in the timing,
2568.56s:  meaning you could play defense in either one of those four and the market goes higher,
2572.64s:  but you can still make money because you're not inverse equities.
2578.56s:  So it's really the function of, and it's just come from my years of just back testing
2582.80s:  strategy development in general. The opportunity set with which you express being wrong will matter
2589.44s:  more than being right. And yeah, you can be really right when you're short and I'm sure a lot of
2594.08s:  people, I'm sure you included make some good money when you're making a directional bet. But if you're
2597.84s:  going to try and do that systematically over time, I would argue you're going to eventually have
2602.24s:  those streaks where that perfect hedge kills you perfectly and you're better off them playing
2606.88s:  something else. Now, I get it, right? If you had done shorting or cash the last two years,
2612.40s:  you did way better than playing defense and treasuries obviously because treasuries got killed.
2617.68s:  But that's an anomaly. It's an outlier to be about outliers, right? That doesn't happen.
2622.56s:  What we saw with treasuries is a once in a multi-generation move. I'd rather bet that that's going
2628.64s:  to come back to being a better hedge coming forward than we've ever seen in the last 20 years.
2637.20s:  Have you considered something like volatility products though that you could still trade long?
2642.56s:  The problem with that is you know that it's no different than shorting in that you're betting
2646.48s:  at time, right? In that case. Now, I'm keeping it convexity, right? I do think if you were going to try
2652.00s:  to do something like that, you want to do it, you want to be a lot, you want to allow yourself to be
2656.80s:  wrong cheaply, which means, and that's where, you know, in your world comes into play, if you can get
2663.04s:  out of the money puts and they're really mispriced and cheap and you get a risk off defensive signal.
2667.60s:  Okay, that I can be on board with because it's not really a directional bet that's an insurance bet.
2672.88s:  Right, that's it's a different I argue that's a different kind of hedge. Well, you're not going to lose big,
2677.12s:  right? For the small amount with convex convex payout. But you know, I mean, it is true that this
2684.40s:  way you never see really a very rich short seller, rather than Jim Chanos, you know, I mean, who else
2689.20s:  has really kind of is out there known as this kind of killer short seller that says mandate or
2694.24s:  her mandate, and they just make a ton of money. It's very hard to do because again, the timing has
2698.40s:  to be perfect. Go back to path matters more than prediction. And then let's go back to the
2702.80s:  let's go back to the November first week in November point. I said, circa breaker was likely.
2707.60s:  Okay, but there is a short said my strategy for infresories TLT, I think it was up like four percent
2715.20s:  that week or something like that. So you're wrong in the idea in the direction still made money.
2721.84s:  I'll take it. I was actually looking at the humor of it all to be honest, just to take an
2729.92s:  opportunity to put a little bit of salt comedically in your wound. And I started entering TLT on the second
2740.96s:  of November and then on the 13th. Yeah, it's been working. It's been very nice. But it's the
2750.48s:  reason I think that's so funny. Obviously, it's just because you are following and that's
2755.12s:  that's actually why I find your approach so fascinating to me with like a rules based approach
2760.48s:  because one of my arguments against retail traders, there's this thing where retail traders say,
2765.76s:  oh, I want to be mechanical. I want to deploy mechanically. And it's sounds so great, right? It's
2770.56s:  on super cool. But unfortunately, I genuinely don't believe that that's how that works super well
2777.28s:  as far as I can tell. So I look at the way that your funds are designed to perform and it is
2785.28s:  really curious how you handle uncommon events like this. Now, I don't know if you follow much of
2794.16s:  Naseem's work or just that style of thought where we think uncommon events are actually far more
2800.88s:  common than we tend to price in. Is that something that you think about with these funds in any
2805.84s:  capacity going forward? Or do you think that will still normalize? So I'm a big fan of actually
2814.08s:  Taliban Black Swan and Fulbeir Envisualista. What I would say is like the last two years,
2822.32s:  I had been the outlier. Like that's just fact. I go back to I don't care how many people
2829.76s:  on Fin Twit, FinX, social media in the media say anybody could have seen stocks and bonds would lose money.
2837.04s:  How could you launch funds knowing that that was going to happen? I had somebody actually say that to me,
2840.96s:  it's like are you kidding me? It's like cost 250 grand to bring a fund to market. You think I want
2845.76s:  to just spend that money? Yeah, just for fun. Yeah, let's just see. Maybe I'm going to be wrong. Let me
2851.44s:  take the risk and put a 250k chip. Right? Somebody who's going to game. Okay. So okay, fine. Let's say
2858.64s:  anybody could have seen stocks and bonds would lose money. Could you have said that stocks and bonds
2861.92s:  would lose money while credit spreads would stay tight? Well, default risk would not increase in the
2868.08s:  fast history of high cycle industry in that dual cell. He may break. And nobody would say that.
2873.28s:  That's crazy. It's so about outlier. The outlier was not that stocks and bonds fell. The LLR was
2879.04s:  how it happened. The path, the interaction that not gone effects to credit spreads. That's what made
2885.12s:  this an outlier because that's why treasuries didn't counter high volatility sequences. The
2889.68s:  flight to safety, which is what I built my funds on. And no one is more tuned into that than I am
2894.48s:  because I have skin in the game and I built funds that I know the research around it. So I know
2898.24s:  how anomalous that is. Now, look, you do any kind of back tests on any indicator. You go back to
2906.48s:  the 1920s. You will always have always always have periods where it's not working. Well, wait,
2913.92s:  just like you have periods where buying Holis and Pia's not working. Where's an outlier on beta?
2919.92s:  You're always going to have that. You're always I challenge. And if you don't have that, you were made
2925.68s:  off. You've done something wrong in your modeling. There's no such thing as somebody having 20%
2933.12s:  a 20 years of no negative returns. And if you do have, okay, then you were a probably more lucky
2940.48s:  than skillful because in any statistical data set, you will always have an outlier. And the
2945.60s:  outlier can be luck in our business, especially because you don't, again, you can't control your
2949.20s:  portfolio. So it's skill and luck. So maybe it's more luck. Okay. So when you're going through these
2953.44s:  cycles, the reality is you have to just take it. You have to wait for it to change. And in my case,
2960.40s:  I don't have a choice. The funds have just respect this. I designed them this way. Right? So it's
2968.08s:  and this is also what I think that the retail community, when they look at me, I put myself out there
2973.12s:  a lot and I communicate a lot. I'm loud and aggressive. I'm not just on social media because it gets
2976.96s:  attention as I'm waiting for a cycle to change. It's just the reality. I have to play that game. I keep
2980.88s:  saying it's a persona because anybody look at the fund would say, why should I listen to this guy
2985.04s:  who's this professional CPH charter holder, but man, he can make me laugh. Like that was a communication
2990.56s:  bet when I did that, that put it. But when you're going through that hell, you've got to keep going
2994.72s:  through it. Right? Now, if you're a retail trader, and you're going through a streak where it's
2999.04s:  not working, you have the luxury to step away. You have the luxury to not have a mandate.
3006.32s:  When you're in the business of investing and your fiduciary and you have a strategy that you
3010.48s:  hope will be different than every other strategy that's out there and competes against a very
3016.32s:  crowded mutual fund and ETF space. You can't do that. You're designing something for a particular
3024.08s:  environment that you may not be in, but at some point will come. Right? So, you don't have to
3030.80s:  the question, what do you do? Not much. You just have to wait and hope. Now, it's like people say,
3038.64s:  hope is not a strategy. It's like, no, I just agree. Hope is unequivocally a strategy. If you don't
3043.44s:  have hope as part of your, as part of the mindset of a strategy, how can you wait for the turn to come
3047.28s:  your way? Well, it also dismisses the concept of luck if somebody thinks that there's no hope,
3055.52s:  which, yeah, I would definitely argue against. We're coming up on time here, but I do want to catch
3064.24s:  you with one more question before we go. Looking back over 2023, a lot of interesting things happen,
3070.96s:  and I feel like you put out a lot of content that talks about a lot of those events, but I want to
3076.72s:  pivot us to 2024. Is there anything in particular as we look into the next year that you're interested
3084.00s:  in or that you think could be an interesting catalyst or an event to watch? So, I historically, it is
3090.64s:  true that small caps tend to underperform in pre-election years, not to the extent that we've seen
3097.84s:  this year, the magnitude, but it's true that pre-election years large caps do tend to outperform
3102.32s:  small caps. In election years, though, which is what next year is, small caps do tend to outperform
3107.20s:  large. So, I think from an asset allocation perspective, there is an argument to be made that
3113.36s:  next year will not be the year of the Magnificent 7, that there will be the year of Smin, small
3118.32s:  and mid cap. So, it's like, if you're going to play equities, the catch-up trade, which everyone
3122.48s:  talks about probably does manifest next year. The question becomes the sequence, in other words,
3131.12s:  does it happen at the start of the year or after some kind of capitulation credit event, which
3135.92s:  I still think is the more likely near-term scenario? But I think that's probably the real
3142.56s:  area to kind of pay attention to. It's just that play of the laggards. That's probably going to be
3149.92s:  the biggest leader. I also think that there will be a lot of demand and money rotating
3158.40s:  anyway from a sector perspective into anything that's dividend oriented.
3163.36s:  So, dividend, as you know, dividend stocks have not done well, on a relative basis,
3167.68s:  utility has gotten smashed relative to the S&P. Why? Because utilities and high dividend
3172.80s:  paying sector has been competing against the Fed as far as income goes. Same thing with consumer
3177.36s:  stable, same thing with healthcare, blue shifts. If the Fed is done, which it seems like they are,
3182.64s:  and if you get any kind of heightened volatility, you would expect that defensive sectors,
3189.36s:  which are high dividend paying sectors, utility, stable, and out there, probably get some relative
3193.68s:  strength as well. So there's two trade-ups, right? There's the defensive sector allocation from
3197.84s:  large cap-side, utility, stable, healthcare, and then there's the cap rotation from a small cap-side,
3204.64s:  right, which I think both can work. The thing I'm most confident in, which I could be totally
3209.60s:  wrong on, is that we're probably not going to see this large cap dominance like we've seen.
3215.60s:  You know, the last year, that that part of this cycle is probably towards the end.
3222.80s:  It doesn't mean that we're going to all collapse. It just means it's going to be finally rotational and
3229.84s:  hopefully allows those that are actually benchmarking as the S&P to beat the S&P because,
3234.72s:  guess what? You can't beat the S&P as an asset, okay, or if it's the only game in town. You want
3239.12s:  it. You need to have other asset classes leading and outperforming. That's been what's been so
3242.88s:  maddening about this cycle because it's been old market cap at seven-stocks driving all them.
3248.40s:  That's not just me saying that, by the way, I talk to financial advisors all day long,
3251.20s:  that's them saying it. It's like any kind of diversification has sucked this year.
3257.20s:  It has not been a free lunch, all right? It's been a vomit.
3261.20s:  Yeah, and I feel like that's the nature of diversification, right? There's always an
3265.44s:  opportunity to cost associated with it. I am curious to see how tech continues to perform. I'm glad
3270.40s:  that you highlight that. And then also small caps for anybody that follows my YouTube channel.
3276.00s:  I trade IWM a lot. So I definitely am looking for a very similar movement as you're talking about,
3284.64s:  which I actually find interesting for that thesis. But you're always super gracious with your time,
3289.68s:  man. I'm stoked to have chat with you. I'll throw links to everything that you have in the notes
3294.96s:  below. But for the people on the YouTube channel side of things, if you have a specific spot
3300.16s:  that they can reach out to you, where's that? Yeah, I mean, on all the major socials at Leigh
3304.80s:  Lagerport on X, YouTube, Instagram, leadlagerport.com, also on Substac and then the funds which are
3310.16s:  separate. I always stress two legal entities, atagfunds.com. With the caveat that the funds have not
3316.80s:  done well, but there's a... I was back to meaner version is the only thing you can say
3325.12s:  is close to guaranteed. Nothing's ever guaranteed in markets. The closest thing to a guaranteed,
3330.72s:  you can argue is meaner version. Now, you can bet where the mean is, where the average is. But
3336.48s:  it's like, meaner version is a concept that's as old as the Bible. I always go back to this analogy.
3341.52s:  He was first, shall be last and last first, is meaner version.
3346.56s:  That which lag leads, that which leads lags. That goes to sectors, market cap, also goes to funds.
3354.48s:  So I'm hopeful that my meaner version for those strategies is about to kick in.
3358.96s:  But I'm sure either way, whether it does or doesn't, I'm still going to have people. I'm going to
3362.48s:  block on X, relentless. That sounds about right. And I will be there enjoying the show as I
3369.92s:  typically do otherwise. But, Mike, thanks so much for hanging out, man. Thanks for being on the
3374.00s:  podcast and for everybody else, check out the notes below and you'll be able to find them on all
3378.56s:  those different spots. But until next time, we'll catch you later, man.
