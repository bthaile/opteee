 What's up, outliers? Big couple of days in GameStop. There is a lot to unpack here. So I want to talk a little bit about what we saw from earnings. I want to talk about the new debt offering and then what spurred this video actually is from the discord. I had a question about how I'm managing the covered strangle that I'm trading in here. So I'll get to that at the end of the video. So as we can see, it is a big red day for GameStop. Right now it's marked down 22.45% and that places it at 22.14. So a pretty deep move here. And there's a couple of things that namely led to this. The largest one that we can talk about here obviously is the debt offering. But, fun enough, I really don't view it as bearish pretty much at all. So we'll talk about that. So GameStop itself has been range bound, hitting a high of Jishai of 36, a low of 20, 73 for the last six months. We've been trading effectively sideways. And this is offered a lot of really interesting trading opportunities which we'll talk about in a little while. But first, let's just talk about really quick its recent earnings and then specifically the debt offering leading to this move. So if we take a look through the recent Q 125 results, we can see a couple primary themes. We talked about this a little bit on the live stream yesterday. So I don't want to spend too much time here. But there are a few key highlights. One of the first one is net sales were down to 732.4 mil compared to 81 in the prior year. First quarter. So using a year of year comparison, typically important to do that just because there's seasonality. So this tries to neutralize that seasonality, give you more of a raw, a raw of you on how a quarter performed operating loss 10.8 mil for the period compared to the operating loss of 50.6 mil from the years prior quarter. This is important. Take a look at first bullet. First quarter operating loss includes 35.5 million of impairment charges related to international restructuring efforts. So there's been a lot of really, really smart gamesmanship in terms of timing and when they're doing things and why. So if we take a look at the 10 Q that they cite here, there's an interesting note that I find is this. We have the assets held for sale broken out again. The reason why this is interesting is because this gives us at least some preview into the likelihood of additional unwind coming down the pike in terms of offloading unprofitable segments of the business. So I find paying attention to this actually to be pretty important, especially for something like GameStop, it requires taking a little more time to look closely at it because if you listen to what you'll get from Cohen and stuff like that, it's just not a lot. It's generally very straightforward. You have to do the research here. The other thing that's worth noting here is obviously they finished their divestiture of Canada. We know that and then they grabbed the Bitcoin. It gives you the window. And the reason why the window here matters is because it gives us at least some ideas in terms of basis, but between three May and 10 June, the stock was literally all over the place. So now just taking a look at the actual earnings and the financials themselves, a few notes. This now represents a fourth consecutive beat on estimates, which again, that's kind of like the given. You're supposed to beat on the estimates, but the fact that they are is good. So we can see they were expected to come in at eight cents that came in at 17. So a pretty significant beat and immediately after based on this, stock probably would have looked generally okay. Obviously, it's a slightly different story because of what ended up happening during the broader unwind. But if we take a look at, let's go to annual really quick. And I just want to show you what's happening to revenue and earnings earnings is now starting to show positive, which is awesome. This has a lot to do with the positioning with the cash that they have because you can see that the earnings is actually popping up even though revenue is going down from 5.27 bill so far. And again, this is partial year, but to 3.82. So if we move this into a quarterly and we take a look at the path of revenue, it's still declining quarter over quarter. It's 732.4 again, 797, 98, 860, 1.2 bill. So the revenue side of the equation is a little interesting here, but my best guess at what's going on right now is a insanely strategic positioning because that leads us now into the 2 billion of convertible senior notes. There's 1.75 offering and then it says up to an additional 250 million aggregate principle amount of notes. This is another effectively interest free loan. It's crazy. 1.75 billion at zero convertible senior notes due 2032. The really cool thing about this is GameStop is now getting to the point where they're going to have over $8 billion in Bitcoin and in cash kind of between both of those. And there's no near term dilution and this gives them true optionality in terms of how they want to resolve the debt in the future. And a big part of these debt offerings is the Delta hedging component, which explains a lot of the cell that you see today. It's difficult to know exactly how much of the cell that you see today comes directly from the Delta hedging because typically notes and stuff like this, they don't have super high deltas. You don't really have to hedge a bunch of deltas. But nonetheless, it will add some cell side pressure. I put it anywhere between 20, 25% of average daily volume, whereas today it really expanded quite a lot. So this is also likely a decent size grouping of people that are just playing that downside continuation move. We'll have to see how it fares over the next couple days. But this is we saw this already, right? When we think of the prior offering. Now a couple things to keep in mind. What this move does is positions the company well for the future. What this move does not do is provide immediate gratification in terms of price skyrocketing, which if you're in the markets, you kind of have to get rid of that. And I feel like most of the people that are in the ape community know that better than just about anybody at this point. So that's I imagine mostly preaching to the choir. But for the people that look at this and they're like, Oh, it's just Cohen, you know, suppressing price. It's it's not this is actually Cohen making some pretty savvy business decisions that help the company long term. And I think it's important to keep that in mind as we analyze what's what's happening here. Because this gives them again, not only more cash to do what they please, but now they are starting to spread into a couple other things, which we already talked about via the card grading PSA. So the company is actually pivoting pretty well. I would argue. So we can see, you know, near term reaction, sour, fine, whatever. Doesn't really matter. Now one thing I didn't like from this article specifically is this can mimic the success of micro strategy. I really don't like that. And the reason is because what micro strategy doing is a very different game. I really view a lot of what micro strategy does like almost as a quasi Ponzi scheme. So I they're different things, right? What what Cohen is doing is not necessarily trying to run a pyramid scheme and get new people to essentially support the existing price and to keep that party going. This to me looks like the actual tactical acquisition of cash to then invest either in the cryptocurrency or in other businesses because you got to start thinking about 8 billion. You can do a lot with that. That's not even a trivial amount while the rest of the company is being paired down, getting rid of the unsuccessful segments as we should. This also doesn't even get into the start of the console cycle to switch impact and stuff like that, which I'm not going to pretend to know a lot about. I've just been told about the console cycles and how impactful those can be. But I don't have a sense for handheld device versus primary console stuff like that. You guys will have to let me know. Most of you will know way more about that than I will. So let's talk about some of the really interesting stuff though. This. So if we take a look and we just look at the dark pool feed, this isn't necessarily all of the large trades, but we can see big blocks of trades. And right now this is looking back essentially over today. And we can see that there's 10 million, nine million, there's typically millions of dollars moving and that's fairly normal. Okay, let's get some context. If I open up this to the last 30 days, what I want you to pay attention to is the date column. I'm at the top and it's sorted descending by premium, most premium at the top going down to least. If I zoom this out over the last month, pay attention to the dates. 12 12 12 12 12. There's one two entries that are for the 10th. What does this tell us? This tells us that there was massive massive amounts of entry into GameStop as it's sliding down into this 22 23 handle. People become super, super interested in the name. Now a lot of these are contingent trades. So it's not a outright style transaction. There's a little nuance to analyzing these. But nonetheless, the message I want you to pick take away from here is that as I scroll through these notice how much buying pressure there was today on the 12th. This is again going back over the last 30 days. It's I don't want to say exclusively, because it's not exclusive, but the vast majority of what you see here from large buy transactions of equity are from today. So that tells us that there are a lot of entities highly interested in the price. Last two things. I want to walk through the earnings. I'm sorry, the options market with you really fast because there's a couple things sticking out to me there. And then I'll talk a little bit about the position adjustment, which will be super fast because it's easy. So if we go into GameStop, one of the first things to note here is that call. Oh, I has exploded. It's over a million contracts now. I haven't seen call. Oh, I over a million for some time. However, most of the trades that you saw today were coming at the bid or below people selling calls. And then if you take a look at the put side, the activity today was people buying puts. This is mostly just near term positioning. This is playing the move that we know typically happens on these style offerings and then the follow through. So I don't read that much into what things look like right now. I read into more this. The disparities usual between call and put open interest. Now a couple notes here. First, if I flip through and just kind of figure out where most of this OI is, we can see that the front expiration is actually fairly light 160 against 64, 20 June definitely gets heavier at 424k again 73. So the main thing is that most of the OI as per usual is in the front. But then there are also a couple pockets that are out further in time, specifically the 16 Jan, you can see a little bit here, the 15 Jan and then really 17 D's on wines a lot. So most of this OI is in the front cycle. Now let's take a look at VAL really fast. I'm going to get rid of the front and I'm just going to look at the front too first. And the main thing is massive call VALSQ right now. This is pricing in severity to the upside. But the funny thing is is where price is right now. It's not even a big difference between a high probability of downside or upside based on the surface. This is actually showing us that the market is kind of like either way here, but it's pricing a big move. That's why you see VAL as steep as it is here. And again, as usual for comparison, if I go out to like this 15 Jan 27 notice how it's still jagged just because of the VAL. But it's much smoother comparatively. And you can see that it has more style, more standard style puts queue in terms of VAL. And then the calls side trails down. That's not the case right now right now. Bam. It is all up in the calls, which is good for those that are selling calls, which is a big reason why I think you saw a lot of calls being sold today. Okay, last thing real quick. We'll talk about my trade, which was as easy as can be. So I'm still trading the cover triangle here in GameStop. And it still has the $25,000 allocation. This is a copy and paste from the log. So some of this stuff is messed up. I'll direct you to the stuff that actually matters. First thing is you can see this is the position I had on before. I had the 20 June 28 puts those were sold for 34 Delta's. It was $1.74 credit collected six lot. And I closed those today for 565. The funny thing about this is that's not even like that awful of a closing trade. It's bad, but it's not awful compared to something that effectively moved down 24% and all of that 24% essentially happened today. So this was still a little bit of a gift, I would say. Now you can see that the net PNL is still positive. So it really doesn't even matter on all the puts that have been sold out. However, what I did do is move me to the 12 June. And I'm sorry, on 12 June today, I moved me to the 18 July 23rd 23 puts. These were 46 Delta. Now the reason why I went to the 23s is because I got a big basis adjustment. So one of the things is I didn't want to get assigned at 28. So that's a little high of this range that I showed you previously in terms of where GameStop has been trending sideways. If we plot 28, it's somewhere between plus one standard deviation up here and the midline, which is a little higher than I want. Now with this down at the 24, if I get assigned, I really don't care at this point. Likely, what I'll end up doing is depending on how this lands is take partial assignment. So what that means is if these still land in the money, I'll take some of them down, I'll roll some of them out just so I can keep some of the mobile basis alive. The main thing that allowed this move, especially to collect a overall credit on this prior move, although I didn't need to do that, was adding three contracts. So what this did is it took the cash secured requirement from 16,800 to 20,700. Now again, here's a really cool thing. I added 300 shares of exposure and I only increased the cash secured requirement by like three grand in change. The way that I do that is because on the six contracts, they were required at 28, right? The basis for the strike. Now with these, even though there's more, there's three contracts, more 300 shares, I was able to move the basis down here to 23. So for these 600 shares, this is a net decrease in how much these required to be held for being cash secured puts. It's pretty solid. So that takes us today where the coverage strangle right now is running 8.4% better than the underlying and that's using the more conservative metric of the total return on capital, which does not include any yield that I'm getting on the cash that's not being used, which is the case. I don't bother putting that in here because I don't care, but that would add a little bit to this because I'm putting those in box spreads, which are typically earning decent yields right now still. So overall, a coverage strangle is still doing really, really well, especially in something like this that's moving around as much as it is. That is the game plan going forward as always. If you have any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. See you guys later.
