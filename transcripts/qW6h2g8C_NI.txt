0.00s: What's up, outliers? Big couple of days in GameStop. There is a lot to unpack here. So I want
5.88s: to talk a little bit about what we saw from earnings. I want to talk about the new debt
11.34s: offering and then what spurred this video actually is from the discord. I had a question
16.64s: about how I'm managing the covered strangle that I'm trading in here. So I'll get to that
21.64s: at the end of the video. So as we can see, it is a big red day for GameStop. Right now
31.04s: it's marked down 22.45% and that places it at 22.14. So a pretty deep move here. And
43.12s: there's a couple of things that namely led to this. The largest one that we can talk about
49.16s: here obviously is the debt offering. But, fun enough, I really don't view it as bearish
56.40s: pretty much at all. So we'll talk about that. So GameStop itself has been range bound,
63.40s: hitting a high of Jishai of 36, a low of 20, 73 for the last six months. We've been
69.28s: trading effectively sideways. And this is offered a lot of really interesting trading opportunities
76.00s: which we'll talk about in a little while. But first, let's just talk about really quick
82.08s: its recent earnings and then specifically the debt offering leading to this move. So
87.84s: if we take a look through the recent Q 125 results, we can see a couple primary themes.
94.56s: We talked about this a little bit on the live stream yesterday. So I don't want to spend
98.20s: too much time here. But there are a few key highlights. One of the first one is net sales
103.88s: were down to 732.4 mil compared to 81 in the prior year. First quarter. So using a year
111.56s: of year comparison, typically important to do that just because there's seasonality. So this
116.76s: tries to neutralize that seasonality, give you more of a raw, a raw of you on how a quarter
122.16s: performed operating loss 10.8 mil for the period compared to the operating loss of 50.6 mil
129.24s: from the years prior quarter. This is important. Take a look at first bullet. First quarter
133.96s: operating loss includes 35.5 million of impairment charges related to international restructuring
141.00s: efforts. So there's been a lot of really, really smart gamesmanship in terms of timing and when
149.64s: they're doing things and why. So if we take a look at the 10 Q that they cite here, there's an
157.32s: interesting note that I find is this. We have the assets held for sale broken out again.
167.64s: The reason why this is interesting is because this gives us at least some preview into the
174.12s: likelihood of additional unwind coming down the pike in terms of offloading unprofitable segments
182.68s: of the business. So I find paying attention to this actually to be pretty important, especially
189.00s: for something like GameStop, it requires taking a little more time to look closely at it because
195.24s: if you listen to what you'll get from Cohen and stuff like that, it's just not a lot.
201.00s: It's generally very straightforward. You have to do the research here. The other thing that's
205.64s: worth noting here is obviously they finished their divestiture of Canada. We know that and then
211.72s: they grabbed the Bitcoin. It gives you the window. And the reason why the window here matters is
216.44s: because it gives us at least some ideas in terms of basis, but between three May and 10 June,
221.32s: the stock was literally all over the place. So now just taking a look at the actual earnings
229.40s: and the financials themselves, a few notes. This now represents a fourth consecutive beat on estimates,
237.64s: which again, that's kind of like the given. You're supposed to beat on the estimates,
242.28s: but the fact that they are is good. So we can see they were expected to come in at eight cents
248.12s: that came in at 17. So a pretty significant beat and immediately after based on this,
253.72s: stock probably would have looked generally okay. Obviously, it's a slightly different story because
258.92s: of what ended up happening during the broader unwind. But if we take a look at, let's go to annual
267.16s: really quick. And I just want to show you what's happening to revenue and earnings earnings is
273.72s: now starting to show positive, which is awesome. This has a lot to do with the positioning with the
279.08s: cash that they have because you can see that the earnings is actually popping up even though revenue
284.68s: is going down from 5.27 bill so far. And again, this is partial year, but to 3.82. So if we move
292.52s: this into a quarterly and we take a look at the path of revenue, it's still declining quarter over
297.56s: quarter. It's 732.4 again, 797, 98, 860, 1.2 bill. So the revenue side of the equation is a
308.60s: little interesting here, but my best guess at what's going on right now is a insanely strategic
318.84s: positioning because that leads us now into the 2 billion of convertible senior notes. There's
326.92s: 1.75 offering and then it says up to an additional 250 million aggregate principle amount of notes.
335.32s: This is another effectively interest free loan. It's crazy. 1.75 billion at zero convertible
343.24s: senior notes due 2032. The really cool thing about this is GameStop is now getting to the point
351.00s: where they're going to have over $8 billion in Bitcoin and in cash kind of between both of those.
360.12s: And there's no near term dilution and this gives them true optionality in terms of how they want
368.52s: to resolve the debt in the future. And a big part of these debt offerings is the Delta hedging
376.36s: component, which explains a lot of the cell that you see today. It's difficult to know exactly
383.56s: how much of the cell that you see today comes directly from the Delta hedging because typically
388.04s: notes and stuff like this, they don't have super high deltas. You don't really have to hedge a bunch
393.32s: of deltas. But nonetheless, it will add some cell side pressure. I put it anywhere between 20, 25%
400.20s: of average daily volume, whereas today it really expanded quite a lot. So this is also likely a
407.64s: decent size grouping of people that are just playing that downside continuation move. We'll have
414.12s: to see how it fares over the next couple days. But this is we saw this already, right? When we think
421.64s: of the prior offering. Now a couple things to keep in mind. What this move does is positions the
431.32s: company well for the future. What this move does not do is provide immediate gratification in terms
439.00s: of price skyrocketing, which if you're in the markets, you kind of have to get rid of that. And I
444.92s: feel like most of the people that are in the ape community know that better than just about anybody
448.84s: at this point. So that's I imagine mostly preaching to the choir. But for the people that look at
453.72s: this and they're like, Oh, it's just Cohen, you know, suppressing price. It's it's not this is
459.48s: actually Cohen making some pretty savvy business decisions that help the company long term. And I
466.20s: think it's important to keep that in mind as we analyze what's what's happening here. Because
472.84s: this gives them again, not only more cash to do what they please, but now they are starting to
481.08s: spread into a couple other things, which we already talked about via the card grading PSA.
487.00s: So the company is actually pivoting pretty well. I would argue. So we can see, you know,
495.40s: near term reaction, sour, fine, whatever. Doesn't really matter. Now one thing I didn't
502.60s: like from this article specifically is this can mimic the success of micro strategy. I really don't
508.44s: like that. And the reason is because what micro strategy doing is a very different game. I really
514.52s: view a lot of what micro strategy does like almost as a quasi Ponzi scheme. So I they're different
521.48s: things, right? What what Cohen is doing is not necessarily trying to run a pyramid scheme and
528.52s: get new people to essentially support the existing price and to keep that party going. This to me
536.36s: looks like the actual tactical acquisition of cash to then invest either in the cryptocurrency
542.36s: or in other businesses because you got to start thinking about 8 billion. You can do a lot with
548.60s: that. That's not even a trivial amount while the rest of the company is being paired down,
553.72s: getting rid of the unsuccessful segments as we should. This also doesn't even get into the start
558.68s: of the console cycle to switch impact and stuff like that, which I'm not going to pretend to know a lot
562.84s: about. I've just been told about the console cycles and how impactful those can be. But I don't
569.00s: have a sense for handheld device versus primary console stuff like that. You guys will have to let me
574.60s: know. Most of you will know way more about that than I will. So let's talk about some of the really
581.48s: interesting stuff though. This. So if we take a look and we just look at the dark pool feed,
590.52s: this isn't necessarily all of the large trades, but we can see big blocks of trades.
596.44s: And right now this is looking back essentially over today. And we can see that there's 10 million,
603.16s: nine million, there's typically millions of dollars moving and that's fairly normal.
608.12s: Okay, let's get some context. If I open up this to the last 30 days, what I want you to pay
614.92s: attention to is the date column. I'm at the top and it's sorted descending by premium, most premium
619.64s: at the top going down to least. If I zoom this out over the last month, pay attention to the dates.
626.28s: 12 12 12 12 12. There's one two entries that are for the 10th.
635.64s: What does this tell us? This tells us that there was massive massive amounts of entry into
644.20s: GameStop as it's sliding down into this 22 23 handle. People become super, super interested in
650.84s: the name. Now a lot of these are contingent trades. So it's not a outright style transaction.
658.44s: There's a little nuance to analyzing these. But nonetheless, the message I want you to pick
663.24s: take away from here is that as I scroll through these notice how much buying pressure there was
667.96s: today on the 12th. This is again going back over the last 30 days. It's I don't want to say
673.16s: exclusively, because it's not exclusive, but the vast majority of what you see here from large
679.00s: buy transactions of equity are from today. So that tells us that there are a lot of entities
688.44s: highly interested in the price. Last two things. I want to walk through the earnings. I'm sorry,
696.52s: the options market with you really fast because there's a couple things sticking out to me there.
700.76s: And then I'll talk a little bit about the position adjustment, which will be super fast because it's
704.84s: easy. So if we go into GameStop, one of the first things to note here is that call. Oh, I has
711.96s: exploded. It's over a million contracts now. I haven't seen call. Oh, I over a million for some
718.28s: time. However, most of the trades that you saw today were coming at the bid or below people selling
724.44s: calls. And then if you take a look at the put side, the activity today was people buying puts. This
729.72s: is mostly just near term positioning. This is playing the move that we know typically happens
734.68s: on these style offerings and then the follow through. So I don't read that much into what
741.88s: things look like right now. I read into more this. The disparities usual between call and put
750.20s: open interest. Now a couple notes here. First, if I flip through and just kind of figure out where
755.56s: most of this OI is, we can see that the front expiration is actually fairly light 160 against 64,
763.48s: 20 June definitely gets heavier at 424k again 73. So the main thing is that most of the OI as per
774.12s: usual is in the front. But then there are also a couple pockets that are out further in time,
780.76s: specifically the 16 Jan, you can see a little bit here, the 15 Jan and then really 17 D's on
788.04s: wines a lot. So most of this OI is in the front cycle. Now let's take a look at VAL really fast.
796.68s: I'm going to get rid of the front and I'm just going to look at the front too first.
802.92s: And the main thing is massive call VALSQ right now. This is pricing in severity to the upside.
814.04s: But the funny thing is is where price is right now. It's not even a big difference between a high
819.80s: probability of downside or upside based on the surface. This is actually showing us that the market
827.24s: is kind of like either way here, but it's pricing a big move. That's why you see VAL as steep as it
833.64s: is here. And again, as usual for comparison, if I go out to like this 15 Jan 27 notice how it's
839.72s: still jagged just because of the VAL. But it's much smoother comparatively. And you can see that it
844.84s: has more style, more standard style puts queue in terms of VAL. And then the calls side trails down.
851.80s: That's not the case right now right now. Bam. It is all up in the calls, which is good for those
859.00s: that are selling calls, which is a big reason why I think you saw a lot of calls being sold today.
864.76s: Okay, last thing real quick. We'll talk about my trade, which was as easy as can be.
872.52s: So I'm still trading the cover triangle here in GameStop. And it still has the $25,000 allocation.
879.40s: This is a copy and paste from the log. So some of this stuff is messed up. I'll direct you to the stuff
885.08s: that actually matters. First thing is you can see this is the position I had on before. I had the
893.40s: 20 June 28 puts those were sold for 34 Delta's. It was $1.74 credit collected six lot. And I
901.64s: closed those today for 565. The funny thing about this is that's not even like that awful of a closing
908.76s: trade. It's bad, but it's not awful compared to something that effectively moved down 24% and all
916.20s: of that 24% essentially happened today. So this was still a little bit of a gift, I would say.
924.92s: Now you can see that the net PNL is still positive. So it really doesn't even matter on all the
929.24s: puts that have been sold out. However, what I did do is move me to the 12 June. And I'm sorry,
936.28s: on 12 June today, I moved me to the 18 July 23rd 23 puts. These were 46 Delta. Now the reason why
948.60s: I went to the 23s is because I got a big basis adjustment. So one of the things is I didn't
955.08s: want to get assigned at 28. So that's a little high of this range that I showed you previously in
960.12s: terms of where GameStop has been trending sideways. If we plot 28, it's somewhere between
967.80s: plus one standard deviation up here and the midline, which is a little higher than I want.
974.60s: Now with this down at the 24, if I get assigned, I really don't care at this point.
980.76s: Likely, what I'll end up doing is depending on how this lands is take partial assignment.
985.88s: So what that means is if these still land in the money, I'll take some of them down, I'll roll some
990.04s: of them out just so I can keep some of the mobile basis alive. The main thing that allowed this move,
995.40s: especially to collect a overall credit on this prior move, although I didn't need to do that,
1001.00s: was adding three contracts. So what this did is it took the cash secured requirement from 16,800
1009.24s: to 20,700. Now again, here's a really cool thing. I added 300 shares of exposure
1018.36s: and I only increased the cash secured requirement by like three grand in change.
1026.76s: The way that I do that is because on the six contracts, they were required at 28, right? The basis
1036.36s: for the strike. Now with these, even though there's more, there's three contracts, more 300 shares,
1042.68s: I was able to move the basis down here to 23. So for these 600 shares, this is a net decrease
1050.36s: in how much these required to be held for being cash secured puts. It's pretty solid.
1058.60s: So that takes us today where the coverage strangle right now is running 8.4% better than the
1067.96s: underlying and that's using the more conservative metric of the total return on capital, which does
1072.92s: not include any yield that I'm getting on the cash that's not being used, which is the case.
1078.60s: I don't bother putting that in here because I don't care, but that would add a little bit to this
1084.28s: because I'm putting those in box spreads, which are typically earning decent yields right now still.
1089.40s: So overall, a coverage strangle is still doing really, really well, especially in something like
1093.80s: this that's moving around as much as it is. That is the game plan going forward as always. If you
1098.92s: have any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. See you guys later.
