0.00s: In trading options, there's a lot of things you got to do.
3.08s: You got to manage risk, you got to research ideas,
6.04s: you got to pay attention to the market to understand
8.58s: where opportunities might be.
10.68s: And unfortunately, in all of these different things
14.38s: that you have to do, there is a bucket of things
16.82s: I refer to as trap tasks.
19.76s: And these are probably some of the absolute most
23.18s: nefarious things that catch a lot of traders.
27.64s: And unfortunately, more often than not,
29.94s: it doesn't lead to some sort of quick blow up of capital.
33.40s: It's something that actually happens typically
37.48s: speaking slower over time.
39.68s: So let's talk about this idea of trap tasks.
42.96s: As we think what we do as traders, there
45.44s: are a lot of fundamental activities that you
49.24s: need to do in order to be successful.
52.24s: Yet, a lot of these fundamental activities,
56.52s: if you do them poorly, it can be more damaging
61.92s: than not doing them at all.
65.08s: Why?
66.12s: Think of it this way.
67.44s: If you spend a lot of time doing something thinking
70.92s: it's helping, but it's actually hurting,
73.20s: but you don't know.
75.08s: That's problematic.
75.92s: A great example of this.
77.72s: I was stretching my hamstrings every single night
80.96s: for like 15 minutes without break for like two years
85.08s: because I thought that I just had systematically
87.48s: tight hamstrings.
88.48s: Little did I know, I actually had a herniated disc
92.04s: at L4L5.
93.84s: What's the problem there?
95.16s: The way that I was stretching my hamstrings
97.40s: was literally putting more pressure on the disc.
101.16s: It was damaging me, not helping me.
103.88s: So this happens in trading quite literally all the time.
108.28s: So I want to walk through six of these tasks.
111.56s: There's way more than six.
113.32s: But I think by going through these six really common versions,
117.56s: that it will help open your eyes to how this can be the case
122.32s: so that we can then talk about how to turn
126.04s: these trap tasks into value add.
129.12s: And then you can apply the same methodology
131.12s: essentially across the board in most things
133.12s: that you're doing.
134.28s: All right, so we're gonna run through six of them.
137.12s: Risk management already alluded to it,
139.88s: back testing, trading plans, analysis.
144.08s: So this is like your technical analysis,
146.48s: fundamental analysis, tool kits.
149.88s: The fundamental operations of options.
153.04s: So what I mean by this is literally just understanding
156.08s: like what options are, how they behave,
158.28s: volatility, different structures, that kind of stuff.
161.08s: And then strategy optimization.
163.08s: So let's talk about each of these quickly.
167.00s: I wanna talk first for each.
170.80s: What it looks like when it's done wrong
173.04s: and then I'm gonna show you what it looks like
174.76s: when it's done right.
176.40s: So let's start with risk management.
178.60s: The very first trait that's super common
181.64s: is some sort of static approach.
184.00s: What that means is a lot of times traders will say,
187.40s: I always manage risk at x points
190.12s: or if the stock does this, I get out.
192.80s: And it's completely wrong.
195.28s: 100% wrong.
196.44s: And I'll explain why in a few moments.
199.60s: Overheading.
200.76s: This often is due to the risk ofverse nature of traders.
204.56s: And it spits in the face of what we're really trying to do,
209.16s: which is speculate.
210.48s: The reason why there is a return
213.12s: that can exceed the market return beta
218.56s: is because there's risk.
221.40s: So if we want to outperform the market
224.68s: but we wanna do it with lower risk
226.56s: and part of that lower risk approach
228.52s: isn't smart things like managing correlation,
233.00s: sizing, stuff like that,
234.64s: it's just through peer hedging,
236.84s: buying options to cap your downside and stuff like that.
241.56s: The ability for you to outperform
244.04s: and also manage your risk in that way
246.84s: is completely ridiculous.
248.84s: If it was doable in that way,
250.80s: everyone would do it.
252.52s: So these are literally just two elements of risk management.
256.12s: There's way more, but two big ones.
258.72s: Let's talk about what this looks like when it's done right.
261.20s: The first thing I have a video
262.96s: that goes through risk management
264.72s: in an office trading portfolio end to end.
267.32s: So you can look for that on my channel, it's easy to find.
270.40s: But let's talk about these two elements
272.88s: of what it looks like when it's done right, the first one
275.40s: is portfolio in strategy specific plans.
278.84s: What does that mean?
280.56s: I will show you.
282.60s: Let's say that I'm trading long calls in Tesla.
286.24s: Just don't worry about the rest of the details
287.92s: of the strategy, let's just say it's long calls.
290.28s: What I likely manage those long calls in Tesla,
295.20s: which has a current implied volatility,
297.24s: 65.5% implied volatility, percent,
300.90s: 1043%, would I manage those calls the same
305.92s: as something like GE, same idea, long calls,
310.24s: but this has 34% vol, 64% implied volatility, percentile.
315.96s: The reality is no, probably quite different.
319.00s: So the point that I'm making here,
320.76s: even in the instance of using just long calls
322.86s: across the board, is that you have to build things
325.40s: that are specific to what it is that you're trading
328.40s: and what you're trying to capture.
330.20s: If you apply broad platitudes, it's essentially taking
333.32s: a hammer to every single thing that you need to do
335.76s: around your house.
336.68s: It just doesn't work like that.
338.80s: And then the last thing that's just honorable mentioned
341.84s: is you do have to execute.
344.96s: And a lot of people will abandon what they're doing
348.96s: and I'll explain a little bit more about that
351.08s: in a little while, but worth mentioning, back testing.
354.76s: So the first thing is, if you do this task of back testing,
358.64s: you probably feel like you're doing the work
361.32s: that needs to be done.
362.20s: It probably would feel like you're doing well,
364.60s: you're doing the hard stuff that helps build your approach.
368.56s: The problem is, back testing is literally
371.68s: riddled with pitfalls.
374.52s: It is funny enough, one of the things
377.24s: that you really do need to do in order to succeed
380.44s: in trading long term.
381.96s: So this is a perfect example of a trap task.
385.36s: Because if you do this poorly,
387.28s: you're going to build some sort of grossly overfit strategy
392.64s: that has you entering your option strategy
396.56s: at 1152 and 30 seconds, because that performs better
401.32s: than 952, and it's only going to be on Thursdays,
405.04s: but we don't know why.
406.64s: Right?
407.24s: Like in the process of back testing,
409.36s: most of the time, people really do not understand
412.48s: how to apply a basic statistical approach.
415.56s: There's also different kinds of biases
418.84s: that people don't recognize.
420.12s: A big one is availability.
421.48s: If the information is easy to get, it means it's widely gotten.
426.16s: So is there some sort of big edge baked into that easy
430.04s: to access information, maybe maybe not,
432.56s: but it's probably going to be less of an edge
435.80s: than you might want in terms of severity.
438.56s: Then there's also the desired outcome bias,
441.80s: which is when we go into something programmed with what
445.20s: we want to see, which then poisons all of our decision
449.12s: making all the way down that path.
451.48s: So the first thing to do in order to do this right
454.52s: is you got to build a framework,
456.28s: and just like any other scientific experiment or approach,
461.48s: it's got to be structured, so that you can control
464.68s: for these different kinds of things,
466.36s: specifically a lot of these biases, which will catch you.
470.12s: The cool thing is when it comes to building an actual approach,
475.40s: there's tons of great resources out there.
477.64s: AI can help you build a good approach.
479.76s: That's all good, but the trick here really
483.72s: is making sure that you are addressing you as a variable
489.20s: because a lot of people don't.
491.16s: And then there's something really simple again.
493.28s: This isn't an exhaust of list by any means,
495.20s: but talking about stuff like robustness checks.
497.56s: So one of the things I see a lot,
499.08s: especially in coaching calls, where somebody will share
502.60s: a back test with me that looks really, really good.
505.24s: And then I'll say, oh, what if we tweak this one variable?
509.44s: And we tweak that one variable.
511.24s: And then all of a sudden, the performance
513.00s: of the strategy just completely collapses.
516.00s: That's a problem.
516.80s: That's not robust, literally at all.
519.32s: Same thing when people try to use really favorable assumptions
523.68s: in terms of stuff like liquidity and ability to execute.
527.40s: That also is a massive problem.
529.68s: If you don't know, there's a lot of theoretical elements
533.00s: in the stock market that you could arbitrage.
535.08s: And you can see them.
536.44s: The problem is, once you include friction, execution, costs,
540.04s: latency, you kind of can't in a practical sense.
543.76s: So checking robustness is not negotiable.
547.16s: And these are just a couple of ways to think about it.
549.80s: Next, trading plan.
551.68s: This one is super nefarious.
554.92s: People will say things like, trade your plan, plan your trade.
558.88s: And it sounds intellectual.
561.52s: It sounds smart.
563.12s: But unfortunately, in most instances,
565.76s: this is just so superficial.
567.36s: It's not funny.
568.80s: And it's because for a lot of people, their plan is not,
571.84s: it's not based on anything real.
575.16s: So an example I like to use for this is, if you play basketball
579.76s: and let's say that you are going to the free throw line.
583.80s: And you have to shoot two free throws.
585.92s: Let's say that there's two scenarios.
587.88s: The outcome of shooting the free throw
590.64s: is you have to get your arm cut off if you miss one of the time,
594.72s: two of the times, whatever.
596.80s: But there's two scenarios leading into that.
599.36s: One, where the trader has shot the free throw,
602.88s: thousands and thousands of times.
604.88s: And then the second where the shooter has never
609.00s: touched a basketball in their life.
611.16s: Which one of them is probably going to be at least more
614.00s: confident in their ability to adhere to whatever they think
618.20s: the game plan is in order to shoot the basketball.
621.76s: Probably the person that's done it thousands of times.
624.40s: It's the same thing in trading.
625.72s: If your confidence is based on you simply saying,
629.92s: I'm going to exit at 50% max profit.
632.28s: Meanwhile, you don't know why.
634.24s: You haven't really researched it.
636.20s: You haven't done the analysis to realize that actually
638.52s: in a lot of instances itself optimal.
640.88s: But that is what leads to just abandoning your plan right away,
646.48s: which leads to execution shortfalls.
648.92s: If you build something that's made out of paper,
651.72s: the shade don't be surprised if it crumbles under the slightest
656.16s: pressure.
657.32s: So when we think about building a robust trading plan,
661.32s: this is when we take the time to build an end to end analysis
666.24s: in outline of our trading approach.
667.80s: I have a video that talks about this stuff in depth.
670.16s: But remember, one of the primary purposes of a trading plan
673.32s: is not the actual plan itself.
675.64s: It's the planning exercise that's super valuable.
680.16s: All right, let's talk about analysis.
681.52s: A lot of people will say stuff like, oh, I use bow and Japan's,
685.24s: or I use moving averages, whatever.
688.44s: And very much like what we saw up in risk management,
692.60s: the reality is your profit mechanisms come first every single time.
696.80s: So what that means is when we're looking at technical analysis,
700.68s: fundamental analysis, those are tools designed to help you
704.84s: identify opportunities.
706.76s: They are not any sort of edge in and of themselves.
710.48s: So for example, a great example of this,
712.96s: a really, really commonly researched well-understood
716.00s: profit mechanism, which I have a video that goes into detail
719.08s: on profit mechanisms, is momentum.
722.32s: It's really well researched.
724.32s: We know it's there.
725.28s: It's robust.
726.68s: So if I want to start with the profit mechanism of momentum,
731.08s: then I start thinking, what kind of analysis tools
734.68s: might help me identify good candidates to trade momentum?
738.80s: Maybe that's stuff like moving averages,
740.64s: which measure momentum.
743.56s: My point here is that the signals used should directly
748.16s: allow us to identify and trade the profit mechanisms,
752.16s: not signals for the sake of signals.
754.76s: And one other quick note here is I cannot tell you how
757.84s: frequently that I come across people that will say,
761.76s: like, oh, normally when I use bow and Japan's,
764.24s: I see the stock do this when it touches the upper bow and Japan.
768.76s: This is the pure definition of confirmation bias.
772.04s: It's somebody seeing and remembering what they want to see.
775.40s: The problem is in those instances,
776.84s: they don't remember literally the thousands of instances
780.04s: where the price touched the upper bow and Japan
782.24s: and did not do that thing that they're used to it doing.
785.68s: So when we're analyzing anything,
788.00s: especially technical analysis, fundamental analysis,
790.68s: tools you got to remain objective,
792.08s: what's the easy way to do that, run a study?
794.24s: Literally, back test it, forward test it,
796.64s: see how efficacious it is.
798.92s: But if your basis for using something is ever something
803.20s: that's not quantitative and it's you saying,
805.32s: I used to, I'm used to seeing it do this
807.92s: or it typically does this as complete bullshit.
810.12s: Doesn't mean anything.
811.56s: Options fundamentals.
813.60s: There's this really common misunderstanding
816.44s: that options provide edge in some sort of structural way.
820.44s: And they don't.
822.04s: So what this means is sometimes people say,
824.48s: like, oh, I buy options.
825.92s: And they think that's their edge or oh, I'm in theory gang.
828.36s: I sell options. That's my edge.
829.88s: And it's not.
831.48s: Same thing when it comes to different kinds of structures.
833.60s: I literally just responded to a post today on Reddit
836.72s: of somebody saying, oh, I switched from iron condor
840.24s: to verticals, what a game changer.
843.08s: And it's like, no dog, that's not a game changer.
846.24s: That's literally a just different option structure.
850.32s: It's like saying, oh, hey, I switched from a screwdriver
854.60s: to a hammer, what a game changer.
857.20s: It's ridiculous.
858.80s: The only thing is doing your best to fit the tool
863.00s: to the job.
864.24s: But a lot of people think as you're going
867.32s: through the effort of learning options
869.76s: that there should be a payoff be a some sort of baked-in edge.
874.64s: And it's not the case.
875.60s: This is literally just the cost to play the game.
880.04s: And the last thing is people bounce between structures,
882.76s: like that example that I just gave you,
885.08s: instead of starting with a profit mechanism.
890.08s: So going back to this momentum example,
892.84s: if I'm trading momentum in my expectation
894.72s: is something is going to go up,
896.36s: do I want to trade a short iron condor
899.08s: because I know what a short iron condor is?
901.92s: And I think that that strategy or that structure is good.
906.56s: No, the short iron condor makes no freaking sense
910.88s: in the concept of a momentum play.
913.20s: So the game here is you notice on multiple of these points
917.00s: is starting with the profit mechanism.
919.20s: What is the thing that you're trying to monetize?
921.40s: And then fitting the rest of what you're doing around that.
925.20s: OK, last one, strategy optimization.
928.00s: This kind of a dovetail off a backtesting.
931.00s: But one of the issues that you find frequently
933.64s: is as people are attempting to optimize a strategy,
936.60s: they're trying to tweak what different inputs
938.48s: is that lack of robustness that I shared before.
942.04s: But also if you're trying a strategy that's not well
945.92s: researched at all, most people will abandon it
950.44s: as soon as there's a site of difficulty.
954.12s: Meaning we have a couple losing trades, maybe in a row.
957.08s: We abandon and we go to another strategy, massive massive mistake.
961.36s: So when we're thinking about optimizing a strategy,
964.20s: that's fine.
964.92s: It should be iterative.
966.84s: But before you start messing with things,
969.68s: you should start with something that's well researched.
972.28s: If you're noticing something that you think
974.24s: can be improved, you need to start with a hypothesis.
976.84s: You need to test that idea and then validate or invalidate
980.84s: that idea in a much larger sample than the handful of trades
984.76s: that you recently had.
986.52s: Last thing, robustness and process-based focused
990.64s: versus the outcome of individual trades,
993.92s: that is what a strategy is predicated on.
996.64s: But most people are too wrapped up in the outcome
999.12s: of individual trades.
1000.96s: This is literally a, just my new shot of what trap tasks can look
1007.96s: like.
1008.76s: All of these things are things that you need to do.
1011.32s: But if they're done poorly,
1013.60s: can make you think that you're doing the right thing,
1016.88s: that you're doing well.
1017.88s: But really what you're doing is shoving a stick
1021.48s: into your own spokes on your bike and causing yourself
1025.60s: to fall.
1027.08s: God, I pay attention to what you're doing being outlier.
1030.00s: See you later.
