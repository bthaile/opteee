498.00s:  you
500.00s:  you
502.00s:  you
504.00s:  you
506.00s:  Let's start here.
509.00s:  And one of the things that you'll notice is that again, the New York Stock Exchange
515.76s:  is actually starting to show net highs.
521.20s:  And if you take a look at the NASDAQ, it's still showing net lows.
526.36s:  So the NASDAQ is still lagging here in a pretty broad manner.
532.60s:  Now, gross lows for both, absolutely contracted.
538.04s:  But NASDAQ is still showing net lows, even though it is experiencing some gross highs
546.00s:  on top of it.
547.00s:  So we are seeing a little bit of divergence.
550.20s:  And what I mean by that is you can see the peaks on the net highs lows has slowly been
555.88s:  coming in.
556.88s:  Like following the tenants of following momentum apply, I don't know if people have talked
563.88s:  about this.
564.88s:  I mean, it's pretty self explanatory, but it's worth mentioning.
568.44s:  The tenants of following momentum is about the same no matter what you're looking at.
572.40s:  So if we're talking about following the momentum of price, we use a moving average and then
576.60s:  we look at things like higher highs, higher lows, distribution of price.
580.56s:  This same exact thing when you look at even something like this, the net highs lows diagram.
585.44s:  You can take a look if there's higher highs, higher lows.
588.36s:  And this is a good example where the lows are actually contracting.
593.76s:  So we're not at the point where we're posting anything that I would consider to be higher
597.32s:  highs.
598.32s:  But again, this rally, this rally as it's been unwinding, like most things we see in the
605.60s:  market, it doesn't just like fall out of the sky.
609.88s:  It really is something that you can kind of keep an eye on and have a sense of as it's
617.08s:  underway.
618.08s:  Now, we never know probabilistically, like I'll tell you right now, I didn't know that
621.44s:  today was going to be a gap up.
622.52s:  I had no idea.
624.00s:  But based on this broader trend in this shorter term time frame that we're identifying, is
630.92s:  this does start to show signs of at least general relative strength to this short period
638.56s:  of time.
639.56s:  You can see that in the net highs lows.
641.72s:  You can see that even in something like the RSI that I use, the RSI with moving averages.
649.80s:  So if you take a look here, you can see RSI passed above the MA starting this day.
657.56s:  And then RSI has been, they've both been positive sloping with RSI remaining above.
662.72s:  I'll make the MA a little bit darker so that it's easier to tell the difference.
669.08s:  I don't really like that is just making them a little bit thinner.
676.76s:  So you can see that the RSI has been riding above this.
681.60s:  And again, it's not just this one day that it did.
684.48s:  It's been above what the MA positive sloping.
688.04s:  So my broader point here is just to continually remind you all a big part of what we do as
694.66s:  traders is look at what's happening in the market.
697.96s:  And we come up with probabilistic assumptions on what we think may or may not happen.
702.60s:  That's not predictive.
703.60s:  We don't know.
705.08s:  But we can take guesses.
707.80s:  And if we can wait those guesses slightly to have even a minor probabilistic edge, whether
716.04s:  that's in terms of the frequency that we're correct or the size that we put on in those
719.84s:  instances, then you can have something that you can make money off of.
723.48s:  You can profit from it.
725.96s:  So this is all to summarize that the move that we're in so far, that again, no way expected
731.00s:  a gap.
732.00s:  But this didn't just like happen overnight where it was an overnight gap.
735.72s:  A great example of that is actually the COVID bear market that definitely and I've been
739.96s:  pretty vocal about that one.
741.36s:  Because that one straight up did catch me by surprise.
745.00s:  We take a look at the total market performance here.
750.00s:  We'll see if anything sticks out to us.
753.64s:  Tech comms both gapped up.
755.36s:  There wasn't really anything else in here that I was like, oh, yeah, this caught my
761.52s:  eye.
762.52s:  The difference between discretionary and staples.
767.68s:  Do you notice how discretionary actually had a pretty solid gap day here?
772.48s:  Whereas staples continued to trend sideways.
776.56s:  That is a decoupling of the normalization of this relationship in a really short term
782.36s:  timeframe.
783.88s:  It leads me to believe that the market is pretty significantly vying off of what happened
791.64s:  this past weekend.
793.40s:  But this goes back into what I think is continually worth noting that we are in a very
802.44s:  emotional market.
805.28s:  And I've said that enough now where I'm actually starting to think and I've talked about
809.36s:  this on a couple of recent podcasts where I'm actually thinking that that's becoming
813.60s:  just an increasing artifact of how things are now.
818.28s:  Just the standard volatility being higher because of things like high frequency trading systems
825.68s:  because of things like algorithmic trading.
829.00s:  I think all of those different factors can lead to the market experiencing larger moves
835.52s:  than what we might typically expect to see.
839.04s:  And again, my benchmark really goes back quite a ways.
842.52s:  But the reason why this is important is because as fast as consumer discretionary is gapped
849.00s:  up today and made this pretty strong move, I see no world where it could not just roll
856.64s:  right back over.
858.48s:  So because of that, the carry over to the portfolio is I think right now carrying a mix
864.30s:  long short delta's beta weighted delta's to the S&P 500.
868.60s:  I think that that tends to be wise.
871.08s:  So now let's take a look at just some of the market internals and see if there's anything
875.16s:  that jumps out at us.
876.36s:  Tesla has been absolutely insane.
881.84s:  Tesla has been absolutely insane.
885.36s:  We can see that I mean, I've been seeing this pop up on the overwhelming majority
892.20s:  of the scanners that I run for anything that has trading activity or premium based activity.
899.36s:  It really is kind of incredible.
902.24s:  Now there was a trade that I was talking about a little while ago.
906.80s:  And this is a really silly trade, but I ended up putting it on because of what I was talking
913.60s:  about at the time.
915.20s:  And it's really just a pot odds style play.
919.60s:  And Tesla has been obviously sent down out of the stratosphere back down into the grass.
928.56s:  And it definitely has started consolidating here, right?
932.00s:  So we can see that it kind of approaches this bottom.
935.28s:  And then we get a little bit of rally rolls back down towards the bottom and then you know,
938.88s:  starts rallying back up and out.
940.92s:  I still again, don't think Tesla is anywhere near out of the woods here.
945.16s:  But if you recall, I don't remember what day the stream was again.
947.72s:  I do a stream pretty much every day.
949.40s:  So I don't always, I don't just remember when I said what, but it wasn't that long ago
956.76s:  where I was talking about this exact idea and the pot odds that reflect around a potential
962.88s:  trade in Tesla.
963.88s:  So for me, I ended up rolling with what we talked about, ESLL.
969.92s:  And again, the reason why for TSLL is not really for the leverage.
975.64s:  I actually didn't care that much about the leverage.
978.64s:  I liked this more so for the price because you can put on a very, very specific size trading
986.96s:  here relative to account size.
988.92s:  This isn't something I'm just trading in my own account.
991.76s:  This is something I'm trading in a couple family member accounts.
997.04s:  And don't worry, I don't tell them that I'm trading two times leverage.
1005.20s:  Tesla, right?
1006.20s:  That's I would be fired as an investment manager that Joe Kier obviously is, they don't pay
1013.00s:  me shit.
1014.00s:  So because they don't pay me shit and because there's no compensation in me for managing
1019.32s:  their accounts.
1020.32s:  I then take that as freelance to be able to be a complete derelict both in my portfolio
1027.68s:  and theirs so that we can all just lose money together.
1030.36s:  It's way more fun.
1032.08s:  So this actually fits pretty well for smaller portfolios for that exact reason.
1038.72s:  So the move here, I mean, is about as strong as you can get, right?
1042.80s:  Gapped up 23.5% today.
1045.56s:  So what I do for this is I trade longer term calls mixed with shorter term out of the
1052.44s:  money calls that can lead to a significant profit potential.
1059.56s:  So I'm actually going to probably prep a quick little video about this specific trade.
1065.04s:  I got to find that clip where I was talking about the current spot for the stock.
1072.24s:  But it came down to a monkey level analysis, which is this is pretty low.
1078.32s:  It hasn't gone lower.
1080.16s:  Tesla still is a viable company, not like this all this near term sentiment and the people
1085.80s:  trying to like trash the business and trashing people who have the cars, which is complete
1089.88s:  bullshit.
1090.88s:  By the way, that's ridiculous.
1092.38s:  But that stuff aside, that doesn't define the company and the company is still doing
1097.76s:  well.
1098.84s:  Just always been a wildly volatile company.
1103.64s:  You go back, like this movement is not new to Tesla.
1107.92s:  It's done this.
1108.92s:  It's entire life where it has these just crazy moves.
1113.40s:  So and a lot of this has to do with the industry, believe it or not, like the automotive industry,
1118.48s:  if you look across the past three years on most things in the automotive industry, it
1124.08s:  doesn't look good.
1125.36s:  So a lot of people take a look at Tesla and they're like, man, you know, Tesla is like
1128.88s:  really sucking here and like, they're kind of not.
1132.24s:  They're definitely way more volatile than names like this.
1136.44s:  But because of that volatility, there is a trade opportunity.
1142.24s:  So yeah, it's really just long calls.
1145.32s:  Pay, paid through the nose in terms of volatility.
1151.68s:  And this goes back to something I've talked to you about previously where depending on
1156.56s:  how you're choosing to trade, you always need to understand volatility.
1162.16s:  But how much you care about volatility will change depending on what you're trading
1167.52s:  and what your approach is.
1169.72s:  Because even if you pay through the nose and overpay massively on volatility, like I
1174.64s:  did, to get into TSLL calls.
1179.08s:  If you get a 20% move in a day, it doesn't really matter.
1183.60s:  The vol can contract as it did and the trade doesn't really care because of the delta change
1193.08s:  is so much greater.
1195.52s:  So it's something to pay attention to because traders notoriously as they're getting to
1202.60s:  like an intermediate level understanding of options, they'll start over optimizing for
1208.76s:  things that really don't necessarily matter as much as other things.
1214.04s:  But they think that they're doing something really smart by again, like the things like
1220.60s:  never buy vol if it's if volatility is expensive or implied volatility is above like 30%.
1227.52s:  Right?
1228.52s:  Like those kind of platitudes, they're meant in good taste.
1233.20s:  But those kinds of broad platitudes give you broad platitude performance, which is going
1237.08s:  to throw out the baby with the bath water all the time, which is exactly what would have
1243.64s:  happened here.
1245.48s:  So let's get into a couple of other things really quick.
1250.32s:  I want to run through some of the broad news from the day, anything that really stuck
1258.68s:  out to us here.
1260.36s:  So I haven't read this yet, but so stocks rallied on reports that said the upcoming reciprocal
1269.56s:  tariffs next week would be more targeted than previously stated in narrower than initially
1274.44s:  planned with some countries exempt and existing tariffs on steel and other metals, possibly
1279.44s:  not being cumulative.
1282.12s:  The market reaction to this kind of headline is insane.
1289.36s:  The reason why it's insane is because again, this is stuff we've already heard, but here's
1296.28s:  what's more important to me.
1297.88s:  What do you guys think?
1298.88s:  You guys tell me what do you think happens if some of the news such as steel and aluminum
1306.04s:  tariffs, because I was actually listening to CEO from some aluminum company.
1312.00s:  I forgot the name of it earlier talking about this.
1315.68s:  They're literally saying like, we don't know if the tariffs are going to be cumulative
1321.36s:  yet.
1323.36s:  Guess what, gang?
1328.12s:  Times coming up.
1329.12s:  When do we know, right?
1331.12s:  The fact that that is in unknown right now to me is not good.
1335.80s:  That's not like a bullish thing.
1338.36s:  It's the kind of thing that I have a pretty sneaking suspicion.
1342.00s:  Again, I'm curious what you think.
1344.36s:  If it turns out something like these metal tariffs are unfavorably stacked on to one
1351.12s:  another or not, that could be a massive problem because right now they're trying to figure
1356.24s:  out, for example, if there's an existing hold on.
1360.56s:  Okay.
1362.56s:  It was just an alert from a stock screener, but it's just a recap for the day.
1367.64s:  I thought it was talking about the tariffs right now, but we good.
1372.68s:  If it turns out that they're going to add the tariffs on top of what already exists
1377.24s:  versus just have whatever the total number is, I think that the probability is the market
1382.88s:  will likely have some sort of reaction in either way.
1388.40s:  Paul says Trump seems to be watering down his tariff policy, which is bullish.
1393.40s:  Has he, though, genuinely?
1396.52s:  I don't like being the political person and most of the stuff that I've listened to from
1404.44s:  a politics lens really is from a market perspective.
1407.84s:  So I skipped through a lot of the stuff that I don't really think impacts the markets,
1412.16s:  but I've listened to just about everything I found regarding Trump's discussions around
1418.48s:  tariffs.
1420.32s:  And the primary message I've heard from him across all of the pieces of content that
1425.68s:  I've listened to and just to give you some context with respect to Trump tariffs.
1430.88s:  And I would say near term tariffs in general, I'm probably close to 20 hours of dedicated
1438.76s:  research on that specific topic.
1443.16s:  And everything I've heard from Trump so far regarding the tariffs has not been wrapped
1450.16s:  around trying to drive revenue, but more wrapped around trying to even the playing field
1456.16s:  with places that, and again, I'm not arguing if the playing field is even uneven.
1460.08s:  I'm talking just from the lens he's been communicating to us.
1463.48s:  You can take it as whatever you want.
1467.20s:  But everything that I've heard so far from him really seems to be that he's been messaging
1473.64s:  that he's trying to even the playing field with respect to trade relations with other
1478.32s:  countries.
1479.56s:  That's why, I mean, let's just take a look at it.
1482.64s:  I actually don't know what it is right now, but we'll have our market analyst, AKH, HattuPT,
1490.28s:  hook us up.
1491.28s:  So create an analysis regarding the current tariff picture between the US and EU.
1506.40s:  Summarize all existing and current tariffs.
1514.96s:  Their severity.
1516.96s:  Cool.
1521.44s:  Because a big thing, we'll see what this says.
1524.64s:  I'm actually very curious because the only the kind of main talking points I've heard
1528.80s:  in the loose research I've done, it does look like a lot of the relationships are like
1533.88s:  genuinely skewed, like pretty strongly.
1537.60s:  So let's see.
1545.20s:  These are right now it's given us new stuff.
1547.68s:  I'll let that run in the background.
1549.68s:  Anyways, back to this.
1551.68s:  My hypothesis here is if we start getting unfavorable news in perceptions regarding some
1558.88s:  of these tariffs, I think the market is violently goes the other direction.
1562.48s:  That's my idea.
1566.24s:  So let's see, no, I don't want these.
1569.24s:  I don't want the tariffs being placed in 2025.
1580.32s:  Summarize the tariffs that existed prior to 2025.
1586.20s:  It's given me the upcoming retaliatory tariffs and stuff.
1588.96s:  I'll summarize that for you guys just because it's still topical.
1592.28s:  So on 12 March, US implemented 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports, including
1598.32s:  those from the EU.
1601.40s:  And then Trump indicated plans to impose a 25% tariff on a broader range of EU goods with
1607.84s:  specific TBD initial countermeasure from the EU.
1611.84s:  They announced retaliatory tariffs targeting 28 billion worth of US exports.
1616.84s:  The first phase initially set for one April includes a 50% tariff on US bourbon whiskey.
1624.60s:  Implementation day 20 March EU postponed the implementation of these tariffs to mid April,
1629.60s:  aiming to allow time for the negotiations and to avoid escalating the trade conflict.
1634.36s:  By mid April, the EU plans to impose tariffs on 18 euro, 18 billion euro worth of US goods
1643.08s:  and composing industrial products.
1645.56s:  Okay, so let's see, I want to see the existing stuff.
1653.40s:  Okay, so in 2018, it looks like there was a start with steel and aluminum.
1661.72s:  So that's been in place for a little while.
1664.20s:  Subsidies to Boeing and Airbus via WTO.
1670.60s:  That's interesting.
1671.40s:  That's from 2004 and that went to 21.
1674.60s:  Wow.
1679.24s:  That's crazy.
1682.20s:  So these guys have been, these guys have been at it for a while.
1687.40s:  These guys being the US, these guys have been US and EU.
1696.92s:  Jordan says, I feel like Trump has surrounded himself with solid people.
1700.28s:  I think Howard Lutnik will offer great advice on tariffs.
1704.28s:  Yeah, Howard Lutnik, I listened to some of his recent stuff and the only thing is, is I would love
1713.08s:  people in those and it is very difficult, but I really would love for people in those positions
1718.76s:  to just be more objective because I definitely got a lot of different leanings from him,
1725.24s:  but I do agree in general, like he's competent, like pretty much most of those people there,
1730.60s:  whether you like them or not, again, I think objectively they're competent.
1734.28s:  So I agree with that.
1736.92s:  Lauren says, I do believe he also wants more things produced in the US.
1740.36s:  That's a big thing, but so the production component of it is actually a little bit different than
1746.76s:  the upfront tariffs as well because the tariffs on different countries is one side of things
1753.00s:  that will still impact the trade with those different countries, but there's obviously a method
1758.12s:  for domestic companies to completely circumnavigate the tariffs by domestic production for some of
1767.72s:  them at least. The Flavis says, it's Howard Lutnik versus Peter Navarro. Navarro is into the
1774.44s:  tariff policy. They're flying by the seat of the pants. I don't agree with that, to be honest,
1779.48s:  I think again, I think it is completely reasonable to have different perspectives and preferences on
1787.48s:  things, but the reality is even in the prior administration, in the one before that, in the one before
1796.28s:  that, in zone and so forth, the people that are generally running the show making the decisions,
1802.44s:  they are smart people. They might be making decisions we don't like because it has some sort of
1809.56s:  impact somewhere else, and it's okay to not like the choice, but it is such a rookie mistake
1815.40s:  to downplay the intelligence into sum it up as just being silly.
1822.68s:  The Flavis says, market sentiment is shaping their policy, which doesn't really
1825.88s:  bode well for a coherent policy. Could you produce literally any evidence to that effect because
1832.12s:  I've not seen that? If they were creating policy based on market sentiment, there would not be tariffs.
1844.04s:  Right? That literally that entire announcement is what sent the market into a correction that's
1852.52s:  not market friendly. Tariffs are not market friendly, as you can see. So again, I think that
1859.80s:  those kinds of just talking points, the Flavis says there aren't really tariffs yet. What are you
1867.48s:  talking about? There are tariffs. See, this is one of the things that I encourage everybody to do.
1875.08s:  Do your absolute best to get news about what's happening from either market affiliated sources,
1883.40s:  or literally just bookmark Fox News and CNN. Because the reason is I can tell by a lot of these
1892.84s:  talking points, they're from a specific side of the news sourcing, and they miss, and again,
1900.76s:  you can listen to that side. I'm not arguing one is better than the other. They're both equally trash
1904.52s:  the fact that they're so biased. I'm not arguing that. But I'm saying as an objective analyzer,
1910.12s:  you have to get the information from both sides at this point because then the truth lies somewhere
1914.36s:  in the middle. But there are tariffs in place currently. And Flavis says they pause them based on
1921.88s:  the all on the dive in the market. What did they pause? What tariffs did they pause based on the
1929.24s:  dive in the market? Where do you get that? Risa says they don't get F about markets. Yeah. I mean,
1939.64s:  there, I would argue that what you see reflected in the markets is exactly what's happening. And it's
1946.12s:  that this isn't like a series of policy decisions being made by market, by caring about what the market's
1955.00s:  doing. Now, some of the things, and again, being an objective analyzer, some of the things that
1959.72s:  Trump has said that I do find interesting with respect to market impact are things like telling
1966.68s:  and starting to pressure Big Daddy J. Powell to start cutting rates. That's crazy. And if that ends
1975.56s:  up going through zero debate, like that is absolutely trying to pressure and create a market effect.
1983.40s:  But that's after we're already in a correction. So the moves have already started happening.
1992.92s:  Bubble says the tariffs have already drastically increased. What I'm paying for aluminum cans
1997.96s:  at the brewery I work at. Yeah. And that's exactly correct. That's what I'm saying. Thank you for
2003.72s:  the data point, bubbles, because just listening to the Flavis, which again, no shade or no issue with
2010.76s:  the Flavis, just a very common thing that you'll notice with people that prefer one side of the
2017.08s:  information field is you'll get like one side talking points, but there's like a very purposeful
2025.40s:  not talking of others. And again, I'm not saying only the left or the right do this. They both do
2031.56s:  this. It sucks. It's miserable. That's one of the really cool things about being a trader or an
2037.40s:  investor though is the market really doesn't care that much about left or right. The market will
2044.36s:  show you what's impacting the market and why. So that's one of my favorite things about being a
2050.36s:  market participant is you really have a beautiful way to consume some of the information without just
2056.84s:  the added nonsense. And another thing that is worth mentioning to you guys, I obviously am not
2062.60s:  affiliated with them in any way and they're not, they're not sponsoring this, but it's this here.
2068.12s:  It's an app called one second ground news. I don't know if you're familiar with ground news,
2078.68s:  but ground news is super, super cool because what it does is it aggregates news sources
2087.48s:  from different, I'll show you from different media. And it literally tells you like who's
2094.92s:  covering what and with what kind of tilt, hard to see, but like you can see the red and the blue
2101.56s:  on the app. So I actually use this all the time and it's because as again, a rational thinking
2110.12s:  human being, I don't need some sort of media agency to slowly slew thin their opinions and what
2117.96s:  I should think I really just want them to report the fucking information and then allow me to arrive
2123.00s:  at my own conclusions. So that app is actually really cool for that. I like it a lot. But yeah,
2129.00s:  when we look at the current market reaction to this stuff and this goes back to how things are
2136.76s:  still not fully understood and how things are not really priced in effectively yet. And we can see
2143.32s:  this again as an artifact of vault, even intraday vault today. It's exactly why I lost on the zeros
2151.88s:  that I traded today. Some of the the the weekend trade that I had on and it's because of this size
2158.04s:  move, right? It's not huge. But the move is still 1.3 percent or 1.3 standard deviation,
2164.20s:  which is still a pretty big move. So yeah, really, really interesting behavior from the market.
2171.72s:  So feel free. Now's a great time. If you guys have questions, anything else that you want to hit,
2176.36s:  throw it in the chat. Let's have a open conversation while we're doing that. I'm going to roll through
2182.12s:  and just run through some general scans and give you guys a couple updates. One of them
2187.88s:  is we are slated for the Wednesday session for skills development where we're going to be talking
2194.92s:  about exploring market themes just because I think it's wildly topical right now and analyzing macro
2201.72s:  events. This is a really fun topic because it requires absolutely precise balance. It's so easy
2209.32s:  to get sucked up into economic analysis because this stuff honestly is very interesting. But you get
2214.84s:  sucked out of like the tradable level of information very fast. So you have to pay really close
2220.60s:  attention and make sure that you're finding ways to monetize what we're looking at unless you
2225.48s:  are clearly bucketing in your head as like this. I'm looking at strictly for, you know,
2230.76s:  understanding and context. And then this I'm looking at for news. Now the next thing is let's
2236.12s:  take a quick look and see if there's any questions from the pro folks and it looks like we're good
2241.88s:  on that. And I think we wrapped up the trading basics stream on last Friday. So I was still
2251.80s:  probably do stream this coming Friday, but it will be just beginner focused, but it's not going
2258.52s:  to have like a set agenda or anything. We'll just kind of hop on and talk about stuff.
2263.08s:  Scott says earnings tomorrow, GME earnings is tomorrow. And the market GME had a pretty big day
2272.84s:  today. I actually made quite a few adjustments. I made quite a few adjustments to a bunch of trades,
2278.68s:  but GameStop was one of them. So if we take a look at what GameStop is sitting at right now,
2284.84s:  again, these lines have been there for a little while, but you can see that it is starting to have
2291.24s:  the moving average is real line on a shorter term time frame. They're still completely inverted,
2295.88s:  but they're starting to orient in terms of slopes. The earnings is set for after the close,
2302.76s:  still quite a bit of volatility in here leading into earnings.
2310.68s:  A little on the high side, but not much. One of the things I've updated on my vault here is I've
2319.48s:  started including ranges. So high low and average. And the main reason for that is because to give me
2328.12s:  some context over what the ranges for vault work compared to what it is now. That's actually been
2334.04s:  really, really useful. I like that addition a lot, but GameStop is also being traded a lot more.
2340.28s:  And this actually started on Friday. We saw quite a bit of quite a bit of movement.
2346.44s:  The Flavis says, what do you think about tourism, especially Florida? A large percentage of
2352.92s:  Florida tourism is from Canadian snowbirds. I could definitely see them reducing spend due to the
2359.40s:  escalating relationship with the US. That's a great question. I honestly don't know a lot about
2364.44s:  Florida tourism, but let's see what we can learn. So let's just postulate. Now, are you talked to me a
2371.72s:  little bit more broadly about the impact? What kind of are you thinking Florida-based tourism
2377.48s:  companies are like Disney? I don't know if Canadian visitors are big constituents of that.
2383.48s:  But okay, so analyze the Florida tourism industry across the state.
2395.16s:  Break down the percentage of non-US tourists. Then overlay with the percentage of US tourists.
2410.44s:  The interesting question.
2418.36s:  I think in general most of what I'm seeing, yeah, this is exactly what I expected.
2430.04s:  It's literally exactly what I expected.
2438.92s:  So one of the things I'm noticing with the Canadians is, and I don't blame them, but like the
2446.12s:  Canadians are riled up. They're not just upset at the trade policy, but they're kind of mad at
2451.32s:  Trump for the way that he's doing things. Which again, I don't blame them. Trump has been pretty
2458.76s:  inflammatory. So not looking to deconstruct that in any significant way. But this is the thing to
2468.12s:  keep in mind, right? Florida's tourism industry was responsible for welcoming a record setting 143
2474.36s:  million visitors in 24. So then if we look at 2023, it's 1.6 less than that. But in 2023,
2483.32s:  a 11.5 million came from Canada and overseas markets. But it doesn't matter. It's effectively what
2491.88s:  that means. Based on this, it's exactly what I would expect. And the reason why I say this is
2496.20s:  it's something to keep in mind is because again, like I've seen a lot of the Canadians, again,
2500.52s:  like they have nationalism, they feel proud of their country. And they don't like the way that
2505.96s:  the US specifically Trump is treating them. And again, not weighing in on that one way or the other.
2510.60s:  I can totally see the perspective. But I do think it's skewing a bit of the analysis in terms of
2517.00s:  like their ability to quote unquote, like punch back. And they're trying to find, you know,
2523.00s:  there really are focusing on buying local and that kind of stuff, which is great. That's really,
2528.04s:  really good for Canadians. But I do think a lot of the analysis that I see so far grossly over
2535.80s:  estimates, like the total potential impact that they will be able to have on the US in that way.
2542.60s:  And this is just a microcosm of that, right? Even because this isn't just 11.5 from Canada,
2549.32s:  right? This is 11.5 million from Canada and overseas markets. So if we take a look from Canadian
2556.92s:  specific, so here, Canadian specific visitation is 3.2 million, right? So they're less than 2.5
2570.92s:  percent of total visitors to Florida. So the flavour for that one, I think the impact is essentially
2577.64s:  no, it's just got open door for Thor. I don't think it matters much at all.
2592.36s:  And then the next frown, Flavis, also reduction in federal government spend on travel. A lot of
2597.56s:  my buddies who are still serving had their trips cancelled, puts on Hilton. Again, I think this is
2604.44s:  another really, really important thing to take a slightly closer look at. So let's do it.
2612.12s:  What percentage of domestic US travel is from government related travel?
2623.72s:  Break it down by government agency or branch if pop.
2633.96s:  Then overlay the expected
2638.76s:  headcount reduction by each entity. Let's see. Because a couple things with respect to government level travel
2656.84s:  is it definitely is pervasive. It like it happens a lot. And I traveled quite a lot when I was in
2663.56s:  the Marine Corps for just different stuff. So it definitely is pervasive. But we have to see
2670.12s:  first objectively how pervasive it is. And then also we have to overlay that with the expected
2677.00s:  areas that are experiencing cuts. And what kind of impact we might be able to wager from that,
2686.52s:  so by the way, who's question is that again? That is the Flavah. By the way, the Flavah,
2694.60s:  specifically with your latest question on federal government spending, that is a really great
2701.96s:  line of thought. I cannot encourage that kind of thinking enough. And what I'm showing you
2709.24s:  is how to take a hypothetical idea like that and then to add some numbers around it so that we can
2716.68s:  try and identify again if there's a tradable opportunity here. So I actually really, really like
2721.56s:  the idea. So let's see. According to Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Americans undertake
2731.16s:  over 405 million long-distance business trips annually. While specific figures for government
2739.64s:  really travel are scarce, it's reasonable to infer that a portion of business travel includes
2743.40s:  trips by federal employees. Okay. So we don't have numbers is what it says. But that in and of itself
2751.64s:  is actually slightly telling because if we don't know, then the expected potential impact is
2761.08s:  probably going to be a little more muted, but we'll see. And then DOD, they're cutting 50 to 60,000
2771.08s:  civilian jobs. So it's like a 5 to 8% reduction in workforce. So that I do think the civilians can
2777.56s:  travel a moderate amount if we take that 5 to 8% reduction in total workforce 8% and maybe
2783.72s:  say 1 to 2% regularly travel. So I do think there's an impact from there, but probably not a ton.
2790.84s:  The VA is cutting 80,000, which does suck because the VA is already pretty strapped. But
2800.36s:  I don't think the VA travels quite as much. IRS, I don't think the IRS travels that much.
2807.80s:  And they're looking to cut them in half. So yeah, I mean, based on what I'm seeing here,
2813.96s:  what the expected cuts to federal agencies, it doesn't really look like massive, massive impact.
2824.36s:  So let's take a look really quick. What percentage of US travel is domestic? Is for
2838.04s:  business first personal. I want to see if it has even a general idea of that. It's difficult to
2848.76s:  tell for domestic travel, but wow. Wow. Damn. Okay, what's the guess? What do you guys guess?
2872.04s:  What percentage is for business travel without looking it up? I'm actually very, very curious
2877.48s:  what you would guess. It's very different than what I was expecting. I will completely admit that
2883.16s:  up front. So what percentage of domestic US travel do you think is for business?
2889.16s:  Yes. Lave says 25. Any other guesses?
2904.36s:  65, 68, 35, 20. Hey, I think Paulo might have gotten it. It's about 20%. So about 20% is for
2913.48s:  business. And then 80% is for leisure. And that's from the US DOT. So then we can just guess
2925.88s:  right from those general numbers, right? So if there's 20% domestic travel that's based on business,
2936.84s:  and then if we click into the areas that are going to be impacted by cuts, and then the
2942.84s:  subsequent impact that those cuts would take on the total impact of business level travel,
2949.24s:  it again probably isn't much. I would guess definitely less than 5% maybe two,
2954.12s:  maybe something like that, 2% total. Just a guess. I haven't done the math. It wouldn't be that
2959.24s:  hard to do, but the main thing is summarizing that down is probably not really that significant.
2966.28s:  So then going back to the original question of puts on Hilton, that's a different question in my
2971.72s:  opinion, but I don't think puts on Hilton outright due to the expectation of decreased
2977.88s:  federal travel and government travel in general. I don't think that makes sense, right? Based on
2984.28s:  just that rough amount of what we're looking at. Ben says the problem I see with these things
2991.48s:  is doesn't matter. It would only seem it matters if whoever controls interest in these things sells.
3002.52s:  I don't understand. When you say these things, what are you referring to? Do you mean
3011.08s:  federal government travel contracting? Travel says if there is less business travel,
3018.60s:  is that better or worse for travel for non-business, like planes and hotels? Do they raise up or lower
3027.16s:  the compete? If there is less business travel, is that better or worse for travel for non-business?
3037.32s:  Like do they raise? That's hard to say, but again, I think the main thing is business travel
3044.36s:  already took a pretty massive hit during COVID, like the largest we've ever seen.
3049.56s:  And a lot of places kind of fared pretty well given the broader reduction in visitation and
3056.12s:  movement. So I don't necessarily think it's the kind of thing where you're seeing leisure,
3061.96s:  having to pay more to compensate for less business. I don't actually see that, but
3071.24s:  because the thing is, is you have to remember, like let's use airlines, for example.
3076.12s:  Airlines, and this is why it's always important to take the time and not get too vacuumed in
3084.04s:  into a specific level of inquiry. And I'll use this as an example, right? So for travels idea,
3091.96s:  which is a fair idea, travels saying effectively, if less business travel will prices go up for
3098.20s:  non-business travel to compensate the companies for less business travel. But if you look at something
3104.36s:  like airlines, if that happens, airlines, they don't care if somebody is traveling for business or
3111.48s:  for leisure. They care about how many people are on the plane. So if they're noticing a total
3117.96s:  reduction in the number of the people on the plane, whether it's for business or travel, they're not
3122.12s:  going to inherently just raise the prices for other people because then you don't get the other
3126.12s:  people on the plane either. And then you have a plane that's flying with nobody in it.
3130.84s:  So what they do is they reconfigure the flight plans. They send less planes. So it's really,
3137.88s:  really important when thinking about and exploring these kinds of ideas, which again, I cannot
3143.32s:  encourage you to explore these kinds of thoughts more. This is exactly how you think about what's
3149.24s:  happening in the world and just come up with tradable ideas. So it's awesome. But it's really,
3154.52s:  really important that when you do it, you approach it with a really thrifty mindset because very rarely
3163.00s:  is it binary outcomes, right? If less business than more expensive. And I'm not saying you said that.
3169.72s:  I'm just using that as an example. There's generally shades of gray and other scenarios that can
3177.08s:  pop up. So for example, if we think of hotels, the operating cost for a hotel if a room is empty
3187.40s:  is not that crazy because the utilization of hotels typically is underutilized anyway, they
3193.96s:  obviously plan for a certain amount of vacancy. So then they can do all sorts of other little things
3199.40s:  to incentivize people to come in, decrease the margins, but still use the room and stuff like that.
3204.44s:  So I think the broader the broader thought here is business already only takes up 20% of travel.
3212.92s:  If it was the other way around, then I would think very differently, but it's not. So because it's
3218.60s:  not and because business is inherently a smaller portion of total travel, it would require a pretty
3225.80s:  significant change in total business travel in order to make a significant impact on things. So
3235.72s:  interesting thought exercise though. A Ben says so the underlying things that should have price
3243.96s:  affected, but since there is not a direct connection between less, should mean price goes down.
3254.28s:  But that only works if bigger parties decide to move money.
3259.08s:  I'm still super struggling, man. I'm sorry. It sounds like you're essentially saying if like the
3269.64s:  bigger holders of something, the only reason why the stock would go down is if they sell.
3275.96s:  I think that's the which isn't fully accurate, but I'm the first part of your statement is
3284.12s:  losing me when you're saying like underlying things. So it's like just so you know, right?
3291.08s:  And remember from like my perspective on this side of the screen, I'm not inside your head.
3297.16s:  So I don't know the context of how people are framing questions. That's why it's really important.
3302.28s:  At least for me to be able to even give you a moderately useful response is if you give me like
3308.28s:  actual details because it yeah, it's a little confusing.
3314.44s:  Example, if Warren just bought Walmart yesterday, he doesn't care what comes out today or even
3321.64s:  within the next 10 years. Maybe I don't think it's fair to say that, but maybe I think to your
3331.56s:  broader point, Warren likely wouldn't care about a lot of things, but I actually think it's a pretty
3341.08s:  significant error to say something definitive like he doesn't care what comes out today or in the
3347.80s:  next 10 years. I actually think that's a pretty big logical flaw to make. Simply because most of his
3353.08s:  holdings are longer term holdings, that doesn't mean that Walmart couldn't come out with something
3357.88s:  that he would then say, I actually should probably get out of this. And that's also I think you're
3365.16s:  not fully understanding how stock price moves. It seems like you are only focusing on the buy side.
3371.96s:  There's a sell side and the sell side can move price as well. So it's important to remember that
3377.32s:  there's multiple people at the dance party. So again, because you can steal man your own argument,
3384.12s:  you can look at a stock, I mean, let's do it. It's a great exercise. So let's figure out a stock that
3389.24s:  uh, Burke Shire, uh, let's just take a look at their recent transactions.
3395.24s:  Burke Shire, pathway, recent transaction.
3404.04s:  Let's see some of their recent stuff.
3406.20s:  What is this?
3414.20s:  Okay, so this is what I'm referencing for the sake of the conversation. It's from CNBC
3420.44s:  Buffet Lodge. Now I'm just gonna, I'm literally just gonna flip through these on the chart.
3424.92s:  Right? Because if we're, if we're applying Ben's logic, then anything that Buffet bought in size
3432.68s:  shouldn't go down unless he sold. So let's see. So let's take a look at some recent things. BYD.
3446.28s:  So Buffet got into BYD back in 24.
3451.32s:  And
3458.28s:  and
3460.04s:  made June July.
3463.88s:  So he got in here. So after Buffet got in, it went up a lot and then it went down a lot.
3471.96s:  Buffet never sold. He still has his position. So this is an example where he got in.
3478.68s:  Stock price went up. Stock price then subsequently went down and it went down below his
3482.84s:  bases for a little bit. It's obviously been up since. But I'm just giving you an example on a
3487.48s:  way to kind of vet those kinds of thoughts. Right? Because there's more, more that goes into
3495.48s:  market price behavior than just if there's a large purchase from something. There's BISIDE and
3501.72s:  SELSIDE. Which is mostly what I see here. This is actually kind of interesting.
3510.84s:  Apple is still the biggest part of his portfolio.
3516.68s:  300 million.
3519.56s:  AXP. It's almost like a mini-doubt Jones. They think about it. AXP, BAC,
3525.64s:  C-C-C-C-V-X. It really is like a mini-doubt Jones. If you take a look at his portfolio,
3534.92s:  the funny thing I always found about Buffet's portfolio is that it's really expanded in the total
3539.56s:  number of names that he has. But if you take a look, these hands down are the biggest holdings.
3549.08s:  As soon as you get out of the top, what five holdings, you immediately start looking at a slew
3555.40s:  of sub 5% positions that are tiny. Which is really interesting. What is his 23?
3567.72s:  23.
3572.36s:  43.
3575.56s:  50.
3577.24s:  65% ish in the top five holdings.
3583.48s:  Yeah. Jordan says his most interesting position is 334 billion in cash at the very bottom.
3589.40s:  I actually think people think it's way more interesting than it actually is.
3593.48s:  Because he's been, again, this is another one of the things that if you've listened to Buffet,
3601.88s:  he's talked about this exact thing. He makes it very clear as to why he's sitting on
3609.88s:  300 billion of cash. And part of it, again, is if you look at it as a percentage of the total
3614.20s:  capitalization for Berkshire Hathaway, for those that need to revisit
3620.84s:  commas, hundreds, thousands, millions, billions, trillions. He's not sitting on a ton of cash
3628.52s:  relative to what he has. And a lot of people just see big numbers and they lose the context.
3636.04s:  Let's see what this is.
3638.20s:  90.
3645.00s:  And then this is 334.
3651.88s:  Two.
3659.08s:  Let's see.
3661.96s:  My sheet is completely frozen.
3668.76s:  Kind of crazy to use numbers of this size.
3674.52s:  So how much cash do you guys think he's in?
3679.00s:  He's less than 30% cash.
3686.44s:  He's largely invested.
3690.12s:  Travel says 334 billions in cash is still significant.
3693.96s:  I mean, it's really not. That's the thing. It's relative.
3699.00s:  When we as retail traders look at this and we think, wow, 334 billion dollars,
3704.12s:  this is a lot of money. It's a ton of money as a gross number of dollars.
3709.08s:  But for something that has a market capitalization of 1.1 trillion,
3713.64s:  that 334 billion that they're sitting on literally is less than 30% of the total market cap.
3720.12s:  So, and exactly. So travel and travel is on the bigger thing that Buffett has talked about,
3726.04s:  which in my opinion makes a ton of sense with respect to why he's sitting on so much cash.
3736.20s:  He's because again, like if you look at this on a relative basis, like this gives you the entire
3740.92s:  story right here. He has an $8.5 million position in LILAC.
3748.36s:  And it's 0.0% of the portfolio. He needs to go out more decimal points to even see it register
3757.40s:  for an $8.5 million investment. So then it starts to become really difficult to put anything on.
3764.60s:  That's of even moderate size relative to the portfolio. That's why so many of his positions.
3770.76s:  Or a percent. Right. Again, if you take a look, take a look at the sum of the size of these trades.
3777.32s:  And they represent 1% of the portfolio. A $2.8 billion trade is 1%.
3787.72s:  So the reason why the dude has so much cash is because he's got to find somewhere to use it.
3793.64s:  And it's difficult. And again, I have a video coming out in the not so distant future that talks
3798.68s:  about some of the benefits you have as a retail trader. But this is one of them.
3805.72s:  The fact that you are much smaller and much more agile is from a trading lens that actually
3815.80s:  is a benefit because it's much easier for us to move around in position. Which again,
3822.68s:  I personally would take the problem of being this size and have to deal with, you know,
3830.20s:  so difficult. I would figure it out, I think. But joking aside, it does tell a story, though,
3836.84s:  from a trader's lens. So yeah. Cool. I got to set 1,800. So I'm a wrap up. I got a couple things
3847.16s:  I got to work on. But as always, if you need anything, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you later.
