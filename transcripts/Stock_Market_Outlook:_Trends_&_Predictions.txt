0.64s: what's up allers happy Sunday today
2.68s: we're just going to do a quick video
4.48s: looking out at the week ahead so that
6.76s: everybody's equipped with what's coming
8.56s: up what to keep an eye out for because
11.40s: we are at an inflection point that's
13.52s: what I think I think that the markets
15.00s: right now are still very emotional in
18.68s: terms of the way that we're pricing in
20.36s: information and I mean you can see based
22.36s: on the chart that I have up here this
24.40s: kind of movement is strange and I looked
27.56s: back over decades
30.60s: to get some context because while I feel
34.44s: based on all of my subconscious
36.32s: processing that this looks anomalous I
39.16s: also want to make sure that it's not
40.48s: just some sort of random emotional
41.96s: visceral reaction so I looked it up and
45.40s: this indeed is rare this kind of
47.96s: movement this is almost like what we saw
50.68s: again much pair down version but this is
53.48s: almost like we saw during the covid bare
55.76s: market and I bring that for context
58.20s: because the covid bare Market was F
60.00s: fascinating if I zoom this in for you
63.24s: you can see the period where we're just
66.64s: crashing as we're understanding the
69.36s: impact of this pandemic and y y yada but
73.44s: the period that we actually set in a
75.16s: bare Market was like three days it it
77.36s: was one of I think one of the shortest
79.12s: bare markets we've ever had at least in
81.28s: the last century so because of these
83.80s: kinds of movements it started making me
86.64s: curious about what's going on why is the
89.52s: market it's starting to have these kind
91.32s: of like really aggressive moves to the
93.92s: downside that's generally been the case
95.92s: that's nothing new you've heard the
98.00s: saying I'm sure markets take the
100.32s: elevator down but the stairs up but in
103.12s: this case it's it's literally taking the
105.16s: elevator down and then back up that
107.44s: that's look at this that's exactly what
109.04s: this is now in this case the elevator
111.24s: backup was brought on by a ton of
114.48s: economic stimulus a lot of support from
117.48s: the
118.64s: FED uh
120.68s: I don't see the support here obviously
123.32s: the support Loosely would be the right
125.48s: environment and whatnot but really what
128.20s: I'm highlighting is that very little has
130.76s: changed between these two periods other
133.20s: than and it's important to call out the
135.52s: bank of Japan and the overall Japan
138.20s: economic system starting to chill out a
140.48s: little bit I do think was part of this
143.40s: significant drop down and now the
145.16s: subsequent okay that's been abated now
147.32s: we're coming back up but man like that's
149.56s: just a really big move to go through in
152.64s: such a short period of time without like
155.32s: a really big Catalyst again I understand
159.56s: the Japanese economy definitely
161.72s: influences the US economy I would argue
163.96s: that the US economy leads but
166.00s: nonetheless there's interplay there and
168.16s: not to overemphasize this move this
170.64s: isn't a crazy move but this is still 50
173.40s: points that Unwound over the course of
177.24s: two three weeks essentially and it
180.20s: really got super steep here but then
182.92s: after again another week and a half two
185.96s: weeks we're back up to where we were so
189.16s: I bring that for context not to say that
191.08s: this is right or wrong or that this is
192.76s: okay or not okay none of that matters
194.80s: the Market's going to do whatever the
197.04s: market does but my job as a Trader is to
199.88s: do my best to understand what it's doing
202.32s: so that I can interface with it well so
204.92s: that goes all the way back to my first
206.80s: comment that I think we are in an
209.28s: emotional Market that's highly highly
212.48s: sensitive to new information as it
214.36s: should be because we're at a really
216.64s: interesting point in our economy we've
221.28s: gone through a series of stimulus that
224.08s: we've never seen before we've made a
227.08s: bunch of moves that we've never done
229.12s: before from like the FED picture now
231.48s: everybody's just sitting here thinking
232.92s: like how does this go where do we go
235.88s: from here at first it was like no it's
238.52s: impossible for us to have a soft Landing
240.40s: then it was looking like wow it looks
242.16s: like we're actually going to have a soft
243.40s: landing and then then it switches back
244.88s: again to there's no way we're going to
246.80s: have a soft like nobody knows so in
250.36s: those kind of scenarios though it tells
252.48s: me that I have to be really thoughtful
255.60s: about the way that I'm positioning
257.12s: things so if we take a look at the
261.40s: sectors there's still a lot of
265.04s: interesting Divergence going on but it's
267.20s: in differing degrees so what I mean by
269.88s: that is the S&P 500 is essentially
272.28s: almost back at highs we're 10 points off
274.32s: of highs The Q's is closing in but it's
277.40s: still 25 points off of high so what I'm
280.24s: highlighting for you is a difference in
283.20s: recovery because if thep 500 is almost
287.36s: back it's again 10 points of highs well
291.68s: Q's typically Tech very well
295.16s: representative for Tech I should say a
296.52s: lot of people don't realize that there's
297.56s: other companies in Q's it's just that
299.20s: Tech is definitely the the largest
301.52s: portion of the index so we use Q's as a
305.00s: proxy for Tech so in this case if Q's is
308.56s: not all the way back up there yet it
310.56s: tells me that this move in spy is not
313.52s: being purely driven by Tech there's
316.60s: other things going on that's causing
318.96s: this movement and we'll figure out what
320.52s: that is in a second because again
322.08s: there's a lot of trading opportunities
323.56s: here and then we can see small caps
325.92s: we're not we haven't even closed the
327.68s: drop Gap yet so the these stocks are
330.52s: figuring out if they're going to get
331.68s: back to all-time highs with the S&P 500
333.72s: leading and iwm is kind of like just
336.12s: bouncing around down here the reason why
338.20s: I think that's so topical is because
339.64s: going all the way back to this emotional
341.20s: Market concept that I was talking about
344.04s: well some people might say well the big
346.36s: Catalyst for this is that we think that
348.16s: rates are going to get cut makes sense
350.96s: if we take a look at the FED watch tool
353.84s: the current probabilities for a rate
355.40s: cutter really really high let me drag
357.56s: this over here so we could look together
359.88s: and they're still sitting essentially at
361.76s: 100% chance of an ease and it's been
363.64s: bouncing between whether it's going to
364.92s: be 25 or 50 basis points right now it's
367.76s: looking more so like 25 again for a
370.12s: while it was looking like 50 basis
371.60s: points and whatever we know that again
375.64s: come 18th September right now the bond
378.16s: market is pricing in 100% probability of
380.20s: a cut okay so then what's happening here
384.92s: why is this not playing it indicates a
388.52s: slightly different tenor because what
390.28s: caused this parabolic literally
392.88s: record-breaking up move for iwm in a
395.32s: two-e basis was the same thesis this is
398.96s: when we started thinking that the Fed
401.12s: was going to cut small caps took a run
405.12s: as again I was expecting them to but
407.92s: what's been interesting to me is that
410.16s: now with rate Cuts even being more of a
412.60s: probabilistic outcome here they're not
414.36s: playing so what it tells me is that
416.36s: there are other themes now that are
418.80s: coming into play that are even more
420.48s: interesting than just the rate cut
422.52s: because of these relationships so wanted
424.80s: to share some of that with you all now
426.92s: the other thing I want to highlight is
428.16s: this down here take a look at vix this
429.72s: has been one of the biggest slam dunk
431.56s: trades I've had this year and I try to
434.12s: remind people that fading the vix or
436.04s: fading volatility is not comfortable
438.64s: because it can go through extended
440.28s: durations where it's really moving
442.00s: against you big and it's not a nice
445.24s: position to look at but if you
447.80s: understand the way that the products
449.00s: work and and you have patience I've
452.16s: never not seen the vix come back down
454.28s: let's go back out Max so this is in the
456.76s: entire lifes span of the Vick it has had
459.52s: some massive massive jumps like this
462.60s: right in late '87 this is one for the
465.28s: book super super interesting 09 Global
468.52s: financial crisis 0809 I should say and
471.56s: then we have Global pandemic then we
473.80s: have this giant Spike not to the level
477.92s: of global pandemic but also not that far
480.32s: off it's like 20 points off which to me
482.48s: they're very different events but still
484.64s: again this really emotional theme but
487.48s: more so what I find important to
489.44s: highlight here is the fact that it
491.12s: always always comes back down so
494.60s: whenever I fade something like vix it is
497.40s: never ever in the context of naked short
501.08s: calls or anything like that it is just
502.60s: not worth the risk and it's because your
505.04s: position will adjust over time you'll
507.44s: have blowout in terms of your mark in
509.84s: that becomes a giant problem I always
511.60s: Define the risk this is a a primary
513.72s: example of a position where I will not
517.08s: trade naked options specifically against
520.32s: it for those reasons it's just
522.08s: structurally it would work technically
524.28s: if you can withstand the move but the
527.36s: you have to withstand the move and some
529.16s: of these can get pretty aggressive so
531.28s: just again talking about that trade cuz
533.84s: it's something I've mentioned a few
535.00s: times now I'll probably do a standalone
536.64s: video on it because this one is is quite
538.68s: anomalous I've been been fading vixs
540.28s: most of the year we haven't seen a lot
542.56s: of great moves to do it on right like
544.48s: the last great moves was essentially
546.12s: when we're breaking above 15 that's when
548.24s: it's been interesting thus far in this
550.08s: case we clustered a little bit but this
552.04s: one offered a really interesting
553.52s: opportunity that I started Fading Into A
555.48s: little bit early got ran over but
557.28s: continued to scale into it because again
559.44s: I know how this works now the
561.20s: interesting part though is that the
562.20s: unwind was really quick which I find
564.92s: again generally interesting all right so
567.12s: let's take a look at what's coming up
569.60s: ahead so when I look out at the week I
574.36s: again emphasize the emotional concept
577.52s: again reason for that is because I think
579.92s: the news events that we see to me are
582.44s: more and more important and they are
584.20s: things that I'm trading I'm primarily
585.80s: trading with short dated options and
587.40s: stuff like that and for the outlier Pro
589.52s: members the patreon folks later today
591.36s: during the live stream we'll go a little
593.48s: further into detail on some of the
594.96s: things that I've been working on for
596.76s: these events because they've been
598.56s: providing a little bit more volatility
600.36s: than I've typically seen around the
601.72s: events so a lot of my historical
603.96s: references for how I trade the events
606.12s: are changing and adapting to the new
608.20s: information that we're seeing the
609.80s: beautiful part of markets they continue
611.76s: to evolve so this week we have on the
615.36s: 19th not a whole lot we have the leading
617.64s: index a Fed speaker nothing crazy but
621.44s: what I do want to highlight is we're
623.36s: coming into another week where there's
625.00s: quite a few fed speakers so on the 19th
627.64s: there's Waller then there's Bostitch bar
630.20s: the only reason why I bring this up is
631.64s: because you're going to actually see
633.64s: differing opinions about where we're at
635.84s: as you typically will see when these
637.28s: different folks speak which is just kind
638.80s: of good because it helps me understand
641.20s: the way that the FED is looking at
642.48s: things again I think that the bond
644.52s: market at this point is going to start
645.84s: forcing the hand and we started seeing
647.92s: the cards being shown there but I still
650.16s: like the way I still like to see the way
652.08s: that they're thinking about things so
654.64s: crude oil inventories on the 21st the
658.00s: meeting minutes on the 21st big deal and
661.08s: it's because we get more details when we
663.00s: get the Fed rate statement it's just a
664.76s: statement but when we get the meeting
666.36s: minutes we get to see what they're
667.52s: talking about how they're viewing the
668.80s: information there's much more
670.24s: qualitative information in here so this
672.28s: is one that I absolutely am going to be
674.92s: playing but keeping a pretty close eye
676.68s: on and then on the 22nd we have a few
679.60s: big deal releases jobless claims we're
682.64s: still very sensitive to that and then we
684.64s: also have PMI which both the composite
687.88s: Services manufacturing all those
690.00s: obviously looking at slightly different
691.48s: things and then Al together but again
693.56s: any of these economic efficiencies or
695.44s: productivity metrics are are a big deal
697.96s: because this is really what caused that
699.88s: original Spike that we saw in the
701.76s: probability of a rate cut because we
703.20s: were starting to see small cracks
705.68s: showing up and one of the issues that
707.40s: you'll find with stuff like this is that
708.80s: there's leads and lags if we're starting
710.60s: to see cracks now then by the time we
713.36s: start making changes and those changes
714.88s: are felt you're you're dealing with a
716.92s: really lagging system that can start to
719.08s: be become pretty problematic pretty
720.56s: quickly now the fed's preference to
722.84s: prefer overtightening and kind of
724.52s: holding it there long enough I
726.12s: understand because it's a lot easier to
729.16s: offer economic stimulus in some sort in
731.32s: a recession as compared to allow
733.68s: inflation to start running off the
734.92s: handle again and then trying to rain it
736.36s: back in that's not easy to do we haven't
737.80s: seen a lot of successful iterations of
740.04s: that historically so moving through the
742.96s: rest of this we don't have a ton going
745.88s: on the 22nd the balance sheet I don't
748.20s: actually think it's going to be that big
749.48s: of a deal new home sales change this
751.84s: hasn't been that much of a hitter as of
754.04s: late I'm interested for two reasons
756.16s: because I also invest in real estate and
757.76s: I'm also looking for some more property
759.24s: now but other than that this hasn't been
761.88s: as big of a deal so it's one I'm keeping
764.68s: an eye on but to me really the the big
766.96s: stuff from this week is going to come
768.52s: out on the 22nd when we're getting into
770.64s: more of those economic indicators as
772.76s: well as the meeting minutes on the 21st
775.08s: those are really the the big ticket
777.08s: items that I'm keeping an eyeball on now
779.64s: the last thing I want to take a look at
781.68s: is the crowd favorite chewy and psych
785.72s: GameStop I was just looking at Che
787.36s: that's why it's on the mind but let's
789.72s: take a quick look at GameStop it has
792.40s: been consolidating here so we already
794.08s: looked at the options chain I did want
795.60s: to show you what fell off from the
798.80s: previous expiration cycle because we
800.84s: just went through uh opax and there's a
803.64s: lot of stuff that fell off so now the
805.92s: new Baseline that we're look looking at
807.72s: for call oi is
810.52s: 45,9 C1 contracts against
815.20s: 24694 puts now one big difference
818.88s: compared to what we've seen historically
820.44s: take a look at all of these different
822.16s: colors all of these different colors
824.16s: indicate different expirations we do not
828.08s: see the front expiration Focus that
831.64s: we've seen essentially since I've
833.24s: started doing this regular coverage of
834.92s: GameStop what does that mean I can't
837.56s: tell you definitively cuz I don't no but
840.40s: one I can tell you that this is
841.72s: different than what I've seen since I
843.04s: started looking at this thing and two I
845.32s: can tell you that it does mean obviously
847.72s: that there's less interest built into
850.68s: these expiration Cycles that's what
852.72s: causes people to flood into derivatives
855.20s: markets is when there's something really
857.08s: perceivably interesting going on and we
858.52s: want to gain exposure to it in this case
861.72s: that's not the case for this week so
863.72s: does that mean 23 Aug is a quiet week
865.88s: again I have no idea but what I can tell
868.32s: you is that the options Market is not
871.44s: positioned for it to be a fireworks
873.88s: style week now the other thing that I
877.12s: keep drawing attention to because I keep
878.88s: finding it to be just crazy interesting
881.32s: is that the expiration cycle that
883.56s: contains earnings which is this six six
886.84s: seep cycle because earnings right now is
888.72s: on the fourth before the market it still
891.44s: is really low IV so this is again
893.36s: something that I intend to trade but the
896.08s: fact that the next expiration cycle
898.08s: which isn't even a primary expiration
900.12s: cycle it's just 13 sap for whatever
902.84s: reason has much higher V which I I just
906.08s: I can't I can't put heads or tails on it
908.56s: I don't know why this is the case the
911.24s: it's it's an anomaly like in the purest
914.00s: sense when I look at the volatility
915.48s: surface the fact that those two are
917.72s: flipped that much like you don't
920.36s: normally see this much crossing over of
924.28s: a volatility surface so to give you like
926.56s: a better example if you look at
927.76s: something like apple just something
929.00s: that's super liquid and if we take a
931.40s: look this is what a normal volatility
934.08s: surface looks like notice how there's
935.64s: not a bunch of these Kinks and random
937.20s: lines crossing over one another because
939.88s: this is more uniformly accepted there's
942.36s: some you know alterations specifically
944.68s: things that will include perceived
946.44s: events earnings coming up you'll see
948.28s: that where the lines cross over and
950.40s: really what I mean by when the lines
951.88s: cross over this is where we're expecting
954.44s: different expiration Cycles to have
956.24s: higher Vault than other expiration
957.88s: cycles and typically it just kind of
959.28s: ladders out very neatly like you just
961.32s: saw but if you look at this this is not
964.64s: that this is all over the place so
967.36s: there's a ton of relative value options
969.56s: plays like if you take a look at this
971.16s: line right here it's hard to see but
973.32s: there's a line right here and it looks
975.80s: like six up to me that's really really
978.28s: peaked out so you can trade those
980.08s: relative value vs if you're so inclined
983.04s: but yeah this this has been a really
985.64s: curious one for me to keep an eyeball on
987.60s: cuz I the v as you could tell hell I've
