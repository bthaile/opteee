0.60s: what's up outliers two pieces for the
2.92s: market update today I want to talk a
4.48s: little bit about the broad markets
6.28s: because there was a bit of a shakeup
8.08s: today and a lot of that has to do with
10.00s: Jackson Hole and some of the FED
12.32s: comments we're seeing and then the
13.52s: second thing is you know we're going to
15.04s: take a look at GameStop and see what's
16.80s: going on in there so starting off with
19.52s: the broad Market bit of a down day bit
21.36s: of a heavy down day and when I look
24.32s: across the various indices you can see
26.64s: in the top left here the S&P 500 had uh
30.68s: a pretty moderate down day it's
33.80s: essentially still just shy of where we
37.24s: were hitting previous highs this has
39.16s: made the best relative recovery and
42.52s: starting to reject back down but Q's is
45.36s: still worse off we can see Q's about
47.72s: made it
49.16s: maybe 80% of the way is back up to near
53.72s: term highs before it started rejecting
56.12s: down today and then same thing for iwm
60.12s: about uh maybe 60% of a recovery back up
63.48s: to near-term highs and another down day
65.72s: so what I'm highlighting here first and
67.44s: foremost is that it was down across the
69.08s: board everybody was down today if I were
71.52s: to Peg where I saw relative weakness it
73.64s: was in tech and you can kind of see that
75.64s: by the sides of this candle compared to
79.12s: the others and you can also see that
80.56s: there's very little Wick this was kind
82.40s: of a one-sided move and you can see that
84.40s: represented also in the volume that you
86.32s: see here today iwm little bit more of a
89.36s: two-sided action with kind of these
90.76s: little baby Wicks on both sides and then
93.20s: spy actually has a bigger tail Wick to
95.24s: the downside and then a little baby one
97.04s: to the upside so all I'm highlighting
99.44s: with talking about the Wicks is simply
101.92s: that from a movement perspective what we
105.40s: saw today in the cues was kind of more
108.00s: decisive and one directional now
110.72s: interestingly net highs lows doesn't
112.36s: look bad so net highs lows definitely
115.04s: contracted pretty meaningfully today in
118.36s: the cues
120.40s: yesterday it was hovering around
123.04s: 112 net highs lows and today is about
126.16s: cut in half to 62 so big drop there and
131.20s: for the New York Stock Exchange it's
133.52s: kind of still cruising right along it
134.84s: actually expanded net highs today uh
137.36s: sorry misspoke it didn't move much
139.52s: yesterday was 142 net highs and today
141.84s: was 136 so not really caring that much
144.76s: and it was gross lows that stayed pegged
147.92s: at 17 so the New York Stock Exchange now
150.08s: is still pretty resilient which is
151.24s: interesting to see small caps continue
153.56s: to be so troubled here we also saw
156.32s: downtick in bonds which was really
158.24s: interesting that's came down to
160.76s: 12404 and vix is up ever so slightly so
165.48s: we're now starting to crack above 17 A2
167.88s: again I've talked to you guys about some
169.12s: of the way that I like to fade the vix
170.60s: too early for me I actually have a
172.48s: slightly long vix position position on
175.24s: right now in the vix Futures and it's
177.16s: literally just to offset some of the
179.20s: other index stuff I have on and it'll
183.04s: probably come down pretty quick I'm not
184.28s: really expecting volatility to start
186.00s: accelerating overly meaningfully here
188.12s: now the other thing today is there's a
189.48s: bunch a bunch of economic data and news
193.44s: that came out that I think we should
195.04s: take a quick look at together so we can
197.56s: see jobless claims came in right on top
200.44s: of consensus we can see that Global
204.36s: manufacturing PMI came in a little bit
206.88s: light and services came in a little bit
209.80s: over
211.16s: expectations so as I'm looking through
213.72s: this it's a bit of a mixed bag today and
218.28s: tomorrow we have uh Powell speaking
221.92s: which will be really really informative
223.72s: I think the market is a little bit
225.92s: pensive here with respect to how the
228.16s: economy is doing we're continuing to see
229.80s: some mixed signals flowing in and I
232.92s: think everybody is kind of waiting to
235.28s: see what this cut picture ultimately
238.48s: ends up looking like so if I take a look
240.52s: at the FED watch tool surprisingly the
243.72s: probability of a 25 basis point cut
246.20s: actually increased pretty massively
249.88s: which I have to be honest with you I
251.20s: didn't expect this so for a while we
253.88s: were trending a little heavier on the
256.00s: probability of a 50 basis point cut and
259.84s: it's slowing down and it's moving
261.88s: further in favor of a 25 base Point cup
265.00s: which I imagine is kind of a little bit
267.12s: better news I guess technically speaking
269.20s: because it means me that things aren't
270.68s: coming crashing down and we need to
272.12s: start you know reversing policy super
274.00s: fast but it still surprises me just a
275.72s: little bit so the next thing we got to
278.32s: take a look at you already know it is
281.16s: the crowd favor gme volume uh man it's
285.68s: just not here we are just not seeing
287.36s: volume yet volume today was 3.3 million
291.16s: buy volume was
293.88s: 150,000 um just sale volume is 3.2
298.12s: million so the overwhelming majority of
301.28s: volume today was to the sales side and
304.68s: that's not overly surprising right it
306.68s: was a a fairly non-trivial down day for
309.96s: the market one of the bigger down dayss
311.64s: we've seen year to dat so again for
314.44s: context if I grab iwm and I show you
316.32s: this candle today it's to be clear it's
318.40s: had plenty of big down dayss but on a
322.04s: near-term basis this has been one of the
324.64s: larger down dayss that we've seen and as
327.20s: I look across it's especially iwm had
330.04s: quite a few actually of these bigger
332.04s: down days so maybe I'm thinking more so
334.84s: let me check spy really quick that's
337.12s: more so what I'm thinking because you
338.68s: can see spy is definitely had a few of
340.48s: them here here here here that this day
343.84s: aligns with more um but it's probably
346.44s: like the top qun tile like top 10% or so
349.00s: whereas iwm has been getting beat up a
352.48s: little bit more here unfortunately but
354.40s: it is consolidating so that part's good
356.76s: there wasn't some massive rejection
358.48s: today markets go two directions and
360.68s: we've had this really aggressive move up
362.72s: and out a little less aggressive in
364.44s: something like iwm but all I'm saying in
367.48s: this context is we see some downward
370.88s: pressure right take a look at the at the
372.32s: money put call ratio 3.4 to1 so people
377.00s: really are kind of positioning very
379.36s: specifically in the product at least for
382.04s: the front expiration or for the next
384.40s: primary expiration sorry um but when I
387.16s: look at something like gme it's down
389.60s: today unsurprising 1.9% but that's not
393.00s: the end of the world considering the the
394.88s: broader landscape of what's moving so
397.24s: gme continues to consolidate as long as
399.32s: I see it maintaining this consolidation
401.56s: movement I really don't dislike that for
403.92s: it because it's at least not getting
406.60s: rejected down to new lows we're starting
408.76s: to arrive at a new consensus value for
411.00s: where people think this thing is a good
412.64s: buy at which you can see coming through
414.64s: like tons of people have been
415.88s: transacting in this 22 handle so quick
419.76s: stroll over to the options and volume
423.36s: today was super light yet again 65,000
427.32s: calls against 15,000 puts still call ske
431.04s: but just very light this is again very
433.16s: very light for what we typically see in
435.12s: GameStop and I'll continue to reiterate
437.08s: a few important points because when I
438.92s: see them change that will be important
441.36s: so you'll hear me say some of the same
443.44s: stuff such as right now I see the
447.36s: expiration all over the place meaning
449.60s: current call and put oi is scattered for
452.68s: the put oi there's a little bit of a
454.44s: drift to further in future expirations
458.52s: whereas so here you can see on the put
460.48s: side the the largest tranches are in 17
462.92s: j25 we see 18 o um 24 that's kind of the
467.12s: next biggest one here we see 20 that's
469.92s: kind of the only 20 se you see out here
472.48s: so for the put side it's mostly kicked
475.08s: out into the future on the call side
477.04s: it's a mixed bag little bit of all over
478.80s: the place
480.20s: the other thing I told you I'm
481.72s: continuing to keep an eyeball on is this
484.12s: right here and this trade has actually
486.08s: been coming in nicely for me now on a
488.84s: really small scale cuz it's not doing a
490.52s: whole lot but I've been talking to you
492.36s: about this six expectation that that V
494.88s: will continue to increase the first time
496.60s: I was looking at it was like mid 7s
498.80s: trailed up to 78 79 now it's at 83 which
501.92s: is what I expect to see I still expect
503.48s: to see the six step expiration cycle
505.44s: volatility continue to expand because
507.24s: that's right now when earnings is and I
509.76s: would expect to see the earning cycle
512.04s: not necessarily to be like massively
513.64s: volatile but much more than the others
515.32s: and then this also popped up on my radar
517.16s: as a pure anomaly you can see V in what
520.72s: is this the 27 SE yeah 27 sep goes from
524.80s: 80. 91% to 4 October
529.24s: 41.8% so cut in half and then 18 o back
533.64s: up to 882 so that's another mispricing I
536.56s: think that um I'm waiting to see if it's
539.48s: literally just a print error or
540.68s: something that's a little more
542.08s: persistent tomorrow that I can trade but
544.56s: just another volatility anomaly so in
546.80s: this case you could tell a lot of what
548.08s: I'm doing is trading V in the product
550.80s: and it's just because the Delta meaning
553.96s: directional movement of it it's it's
555.88s: just not showing up in any significant
558.08s: Force for the time being so that's what
560.76s: I got for today as always anything you
562.64s: want me to take a look at let me know
564.04s: there was a couple um PE couple things
566.48s: people emailed to me so I'm going to try
568.12s: to hit those in the live session later
570.08s: today at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time so come
572.68s: hang out then if you're so inclined to
574.36s: talk a little bit more about the market
575.84s: specifically but in the meantime be an
578.32s: outlier I'll see you guys later
