0.00s: What's up, Abe's time for your game stop update as promised every week.
5.72s: We're taking a look at it even though this week is a little bit quiet.
8.96s: There's a couple of things I want to highlight and I do want to spend a little time talking
12.04s: about some of the latest news around store closures, analyst estimates and stuff like that.
16.88s: Then do you think it kind of paints a little bit of a picture for where we're at with
20.72s: the stock?
21.72s: Now, first thing, price performance, you can see that we're actually leveling off here.
26.40s: And this is a very welcome surprise.
29.96s: None of these lines have been drawn recently.
32.88s: These are all things that have been existing on the chart for a little while.
36.00s: And I draw that point out just because you can see that this down move has been in a
40.48s: couple of different stages.
41.80s: This hasn't been parabolic down.
44.08s: It's been down, big down day, but then consolidation down, slight drift down and gap up consolidation
51.76s: sideways, then three down days.
54.48s: And now we are consolidating sideways.
56.88s: So what this tells me is that the market is still both well game stop is susceptible to
64.08s: the broader market movements, but then it's also still catching bids, which in the grand
70.08s: scheme of things is really solid, I think.
73.24s: Now it does need to make a choice from essentially this zone that's building out.
80.72s: It's good that it's trending sideways through this, especially as the market was showing
84.84s: some pretty heavy weakness during the same stage.
88.28s: If we take a look at another chart really quick, just to share that point more closely,
94.24s: I want to give you a specific comparison point because I think it is useful.
100.28s: So let's take a look at game stop.
102.44s: Well actually, let's take a look at small caps here.
104.68s: We'll take a look at IWM and then we already have game stop ups.
107.52s: Let's great.
108.96s: And let's zoom these out a little bit more just to get a bit more data points in there
112.48s: but to the laptop can't do that with game stop up for goks.
115.08s: It's gone completely parabolic within the last year.
118.60s: So we have to tighten this up.
120.56s: So let's take a look.
121.96s: I want you to specifically monitor the time frames from this part of the chart, right?
127.16s: So I'm kind of highlighting the 20th here and then the same period here.
132.16s: And I want you to take a look at the move in game stop relative to small caps over this
138.36s: time frame, right?
140.04s: So game stop has been showing some pretty significant relative strength, even if we go
144.36s: out to large cap stocks.
146.52s: And again, we use the same reference period of essentially from the 20th, which is right
152.40s: here on both.
154.44s: And if we look at the moves here, game stop has gone from 27 and now it's sitting at 25.
160.56s: So definitely a pretty big decline on a percentage basis, but two point decline otherwise.
167.52s: So it's around 10%, but then we can see on the 20th here on a relative basis, S&P 500s
176.92s: gone from 612 down to 583.
180.04s: The main thing is obviously an volatility adjusted move 10% in game stop is kind of a nothing
187.04s: don't standard fair game stop moves a lot.
190.92s: And if you take a look at the average true range or average daily range comparison in
195.64s: the S&P 500, this is accelerated massively over this time frame, right?
199.88s: But if you take a look over the last 90 day period, the average true range is 1.16, then
206.24s: it goes to 1.33 and then it effectively almost doubles to 2.3.
213.00s: Whereas if we take a look at the difference between the 20 day on game stop, which is 5%
217.40s: and then on a 5 day, it's 4.7%.
220.60s: So even though on a relative basis, this is moving a lot relative to game stop specifically,
225.72s: it's actually kind of a stabilizing factor, which is very interesting to see.
230.52s: That aside, I did go through the options chain as per usual, just to see if anything sticks
235.80s: out to us.
237.36s: And honestly, not much.
239.68s: There was a little bit of a spike today that I can see here with respect to net call
245.76s: premium, but it's still not like a tremendously massive amount or anything that I would say,
252.72s: like, oh, yeah, this is a game changer, something crazy is going on here.
256.24s: I will say that this is notably bullish, though, compared to effectively the last two months.
262.72s: We haven't hit the same one mill level since towards the end of April.
268.08s: The net call premium has been pretty light.
270.76s: So the fact that it is skewing bullish today is actually noteworthy in and of itself
277.96s: from a net premium perspective.
280.56s: And then if we take a look at this overall trades and see if anything sticks out to us from
285.52s: the perspective of directional plays, we have to kill the spreads so that we're just
291.64s: looking at single legs.
294.24s: And we can see a lot of the build out is still out in 2026.
298.56s: These are people speculating on longer term ideas, which again is good to see because
304.08s: this is not game stop being dominated by expectations of short term price distortions.
310.60s: This is expectation of game stop as a company growing in value, which is exactly the kind
316.92s: of thing that I want to see as an investor.
319.96s: If we take a look at the options chain in the platform, you'll notice a couple things.
325.60s: The first thing is obviously we can see volatility is getting way, way, way elevated here
331.44s: in the 28 March expiration cycle.
334.76s: And right now earnings is slated for the 25th after the close.
340.40s: We'll see if it actually sticks there.
343.40s: But right now that's where the market is agreeing.
346.12s: It's seeing it there.
347.80s: If we take a look at the total breakdown of calls to puts still maintaining pretty strong
353.24s: and calls skew, not a big shift there, but a ton.
356.36s: Take a look at this volume today.
358.32s: 72,000 calls again, 17,000 puts and take a look at how many were bought at the ask or
363.48s: above.
364.48s: That's a actually tremendous value.
366.68s: The fact that that's 44%.
369.00s: I typically would expect to see the 40% handle as the in between the market.
374.84s: So these are absolutely people speculating to the upside.
379.76s: A lot of the volume is in the seven March expiration.
383.52s: So if we take a look, 28,000 of that is in seven March.
387.32s: And then if we go out to that longer term expiration, the 16 Jan, only 1500 options out that
393.40s: far, 21 March is about 10,000.
397.12s: So most of it is in the longer term, expiration on a combination.
402.08s: Obviously, a lot of it is the short term front play as per usual, but those are lower overall
408.40s: values.
409.64s: If we take a look at overall build out, the green here tells me that these are net ads.
415.56s: The contracts are still building out to the upside and a little bit same on the put side,
423.24s: but again, nothing to extreme here.
426.72s: Now the last thing I want to talk about is this.
431.04s: So there's some recent news that relates to the store closures.
438.16s: We can see that I think we already talked about some of these in Ohio.
442.32s: I think this article is from like the 26th or something like that.
446.12s: Yeah, 27 Feb.
448.16s: And it just talks about closing more of the stores, which again, I think is everybody knows
453.80s: this.
454.80s: We're trying to offload the stores that are not driving profitability, which is exactly
461.20s: what should happen.
462.20s: And you can see that here's an entire list of the stores so far.
466.44s: So this is continuing to expand and you can see that it's not limited to a place like
469.94s: Ohio.
470.94s: It's kind of across the board.
472.56s: The other thing that was really interesting was this.
476.06s: So they're talking about selling their international operations.
480.12s: This came out a little while ago.
482.40s: We originally discussed this, but I think it's worth just like just mentioning it in total
488.32s: because this drives the broader picture that GameStop is reinventing itself.
495.44s: It's doing what it needs to do to survive as a company.
498.18s: The fact that it's looking for stuff like this, the footprint that it has in Canada in
503.82s: France with Canada specifically representing 5% of sales are saying, okay, well, this isn't
509.54s: worth the investment we should divest from this and try to reallocate that money to where
516.62s: we see strength, which again, makes a lot of sense.
522.20s: Now the last thing I want to mention quick here, I was looking through this.
524.88s: This is kind of interesting.
525.88s: This is from the street and it just shares analyst estimates on GameStop EPS and most
533.12s: of them are showing negative expectations for fiscal year 2425.
538.92s: You can see what the ranges are for both of those periods.
544.46s: There are some that are starting to eyeball potential profitability is again, as you can
551.38s: see, expanding towards 2025.
555.62s: But these are using mean estimates.
558.98s: So we'll see exactly how it lands because again, they're sitting on a lot of cash which
565.26s: does help, but revenues are still contracting.
568.82s: So we kind of need to see where revenues go.
572.18s: But one of the cool parts about this is on a value basis.
575.70s: You can see price to sales are actually starting to show a little bit of opportunity from
582.02s: like a value perspective.
583.82s: So that is the current state of GameStop as I see it from a trader's perspective.
589.30s: As always, if you guys want to learn more about the depth and the lore, the due to talk
594.30s: to is Richard Newton.
596.42s: He's the guy to go see for all that stuff.
598.02s: He knows way more about GameStop than I could ever even hope to approach.
602.94s: So he's the guy for that kind of context, but I aim to add a slightly different lens
608.46s: and talk about the actual traders' lens of stuff as well as the options market.
613.42s: So as always, if you have any questions, let me know.
615.18s: Be an outlier.
616.18s: I'll see you all later.
