0.00s:  What's up, Abe's time for your game stop update as promised every week.
5.72s:  We're taking a look at it even though this week is a little bit quiet.
8.96s:  There's a couple of things I want to highlight and I do want to spend a little time talking
12.04s:  about some of the latest news around store closures, analyst estimates and stuff like that.
16.88s:  I do think it kind of paints a little bit of a picture for where we're at with the
20.88s:  stock.
21.88s:  Now, first thing, price performance, you can see that we're actually leveling off here.
26.40s:  And this is a very welcome surprise.
29.96s:  None of these lines have been drawn recently.
32.88s:  These are all things that have been existing on the chart for a little while.
36.00s:  And I draw that point out just because you can see that this down move has been in
40.44s:  a couple of different stages.
41.80s:  This hasn't been parabolic down.
44.12s:  It's been down, big down day, but then consolidation down, slight drift down and gap up consolidation
51.76s:  sideways, then three down days.
54.48s:  And now we are consolidating sideways.
56.88s:  So what this tells me is that the market is still both well game stop is susceptible to
64.08s:  the broader market movements, but then it's also still catching bids, which in the grand
70.08s:  scheme of things is really solid, I think.
73.24s:  Now it does need to make a choice from essentially this zone that's building out.
80.72s:  It's good that it's trending sideways through this, especially as the market was showing
84.84s:  some pretty heavy weakness during the same stage.
88.28s:  If we take a look at another chart really quick, just to share that point more closely,
94.24s:  I want to give you a specific comparison point because I think it is useful.
100.28s:  So let's take a look at game stop.
102.44s:  Well actually, let's take a look at small caps here.
104.68s:  We'll take a look at IWM and then we already have game stop ups.
107.52s:  Let's great.
108.96s:  And let's zoom these out a little bit more just to get a bit more data points in there
112.48s:  but to the laptop can't do that with game stop up for goks.
115.08s:  It's gone completely parabolic within the last year.
118.60s:  So we have to tighten this up.
120.56s:  So let's take a look.
121.96s:  I want you to specifically monitor the time frames from this part of the chart, right?
127.16s:  So I'm kind of highlighting the 20th here and then the same period here.
132.16s:  And I want you to take a look at the move in game stop relative to small caps over this
138.36s:  time frame, right?
140.04s:  So game stop has been showing some pretty significant relative strength, even if we go
144.36s:  out to large cap stocks.
146.52s:  And again, we use the same reference period of essentially from the 20th, which is right
152.40s:  here on both.
154.44s:  And if we look at the moves here, game stop has gone from 27 and now it's sitting at 25.
160.56s:  So definitely a pretty big decline on a percentage basis, but two point decline otherwise.
167.52s:  So it's around 10%.
170.96s:  But then we can see on the 20th here on a relative basis, S&P 500s gone from 612 down
178.32s:  to 583.
180.04s:  The main thing is obviously an volatility adjusted move 10% in game stop is kind of a nothing
187.04s:  don't standard fair.
189.12s:  Game stop moves a lot.
190.92s:  And if you take a look at the average true range or average daily range comparison in
195.64s:  the S&P 500,
197.28s:  this is accelerated massively over this time frame, right?
199.92s:  But if you take a look over the last 90 day period, the average true range is 1.16, then
206.24s:  it goes to 1.33 and then it effectively almost doubles to 2.3.
213.00s:  Whereas if we take a look at the difference between the 20 day on game stop, which is 5%
217.36s:  and then on a 5 day, it's 4.7%.
220.60s:  So even though on a relative basis, this is moving a lot relative to game stop specifically,
225.76s:  it's actually kind of a stabilizing factor, which is very interesting to see.
230.56s:  That aside, I did go through the options chain as per usual, just to see if anything sticks
235.80s:  out to us.
237.36s:  And honestly, not much.
239.72s:  There was a little bit of a spike today that I can see here with respect to net call
245.72s:  premium, but it's still not like a tremendously massive amount or anything that I would say,
252.72s:  like, oh, yeah, this is a game changer, something crazy is going on here.
256.48s:  I will say that this is notably bullish, though, compared to effectively the last two
262.28s:  months.
263.28s:  We haven't hit the same 1 mil level since towards the end of April.
268.04s:  The net call premium has been pretty light.
270.76s:  So the fact that it is skewing bullish today is actually noteworthy in and of itself from
278.12s:  a net premium perspective.
280.56s:  And then if we take a look at its overall trades and see if anything sticks out to us from
285.52s:  the perspective of directional plays, we have to kill the spreads so that we're just
291.64s:  looking at single legs.
294.24s:  And we can see a lot of the build out is still out in 2026.
298.56s:  These are people speculating on longer term ideas, which again, is good to see because
304.08s:  this is not game stop being dominated by expectations of short term price distortions.
310.52s:  This is expectation of game stop as a company growing in value, which is exactly the kind
316.96s:  of thing that I want to see as an investor.
319.96s:  If we take a look at the options chain in the platform, you'll notice a couple things.
325.60s:  The first thing is obviously we can see volatility is getting way, way, way elevated here in
331.56s:  the 28 March expiration cycle.
334.76s:  And right now earnings is slated for the 25th after the close.
340.40s:  We'll see if it actually sticks there, but right now that's where the market is agreeing.
346.08s:  It's seeing it there.
347.80s:  If we take a look at the total breakdown of calls to puts still maintaining pretty strong
353.24s:  calls, skew, not a big shift there, but a ton.
356.36s:  Take a look at this volume today.
358.28s:  72,000 calls again, 17,000 puts and take a look at how many were bought at the ask or
363.52s:  above.
364.52s:  And it's actually tremendous value.
366.72s:  The fact that that's 44%.
369.00s:  I typically would expect to see the 40% handle as the in between the market.
374.84s:  So these are absolutely people speculating to the upside.
379.76s:  A lot of the volume is in the seven March expiration.
383.52s:  So if we take a look, 28,000 of that is in seven March.
387.32s:  And then if we go out to that longer term expiration, the 16 Jan, only 1500 options out
393.24s:  that far.
394.20s:  21 March is about 10,000.
397.12s:  So most of it is in the longer term expiration on a combination.
402.08s:  Obviously, a lot of it is the short term front play as per usual, but those are lower
407.76s:  overall values.
409.64s:  If we take a look at overall build out, the green here tells me that these are net ads.
415.56s:  The contracts are still building out to the upside.
420.12s:  And a little bit same on the put side, but again, nothing to extreme here.
426.72s:  Now the last thing I want to talk about is this.
431.04s:  So there's some recent news that relates to the store closures.
438.16s:  We can see that we, I think we already talked about some of these in Ohio.
442.28s:  I think this article is from like the 26th or something like that.
446.12s:  27 Feb.
448.16s:  And it just talks about closing more of the stores, which again, I think is everybody
453.52s:  knows this.
454.76s:  We're trying to offload the stores that are not driving profitability, which is exactly
461.20s:  what should happen.
462.20s:  And you can see that here's an entire list of the stores so far.
466.44s:  So this is continuing to expand and you can see that it's not limited to a place like
469.94s:  Ohio.
470.94s:  It's kind of across the board.
472.56s:  The other thing that was really interesting was this.
476.04s:  So they're talking about selling their international operations.
480.12s:  This came out a little while ago.
482.40s:  We originally discussed this.
484.92s:  But I think it's worth just like just mentioning it in total because this drives the broader
490.88s:  picture that GameStop is reinventing itself.
495.44s:  It's doing what it needs to do to survive as a company.
498.18s:  The fact that it's looking for stuff like this, the footprint that it has in Canada in
503.80s:  France with Canada specifically representing 5% of sales are saying, okay, well, this
509.12s:  isn't worth the investment we should divest from this and try to reallocate that money
516.12s:  to where we see strength, which again, makes a lot of sense.
522.20s:  Now the last thing I want to mention quick here, I was looking through this.
524.88s:  This is kind of interesting.
525.88s:  This is from the street.
527.44s:  And it just shares analyst estimates on GameStop EPS.
532.84s:  And most of them are showing negative expectations for fiscal year 2425.
538.92s:  You can see what the ranges are for both of those periods.
544.48s:  There are some that are starting to eyeball potential profitability is again, as you can
551.40s:  see, expanding towards 2025.
555.60s:  But these are using mean estimates.
559.00s:  So we'll see exactly how it lands because again, they're sitting on a lot of cash, which
565.28s:  does help, but revenues are still contracting.
568.80s:  So we kind of need to see where revenues go.
572.16s:  But one of the cool parts about this is on a value basis.
575.70s:  You can see price to sales are actually starting to show a little bit of opportunity from
582.02s:  like a value perspective.
583.82s:  So that is the current state of GameStop is I see it from a trader's perspective.
589.30s:  As always, if you guys want to learn more about the depth and the lore, the due to talk
594.30s:  to is Richard Newton.
596.42s:  He's the guy to go see for all that stuff.
598.02s:  He knows way more about GameStop than I could ever even hope to approach.
602.94s:  So he's the guy for that kind of context, but I aim to add a slightly different lens
608.46s:  and talk about the actual traders' lens of stuff as well as the options market.
613.42s:  So as always, if you have any questions, let me know.
615.18s:  Be an outlier.
616.18s:  I'll see you all later.
