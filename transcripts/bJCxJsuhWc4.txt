0.00s: Let's talk about how to create investing goals.
1.92s: This is probably one of the most overlooked aspects that all traders just dismiss.
6.48s: I did the same exact thing early on and it's a giant mistake because you do not realize how powerful it is
13.04s: to even take a few hours to create a roadmap.
15.36s: So we're going to do exactly that right now.
17.00s: What's up everybody?
17.64s: Eric here.
18.00s: Welcome back to all outliers.
19.32s: A big shout out to the YouTube members and the Patreon folks.
22.12s: If you're interested in joining and supporting you can find the links in the description below.
25.60s: And with that, let's get right to it.
26.92s: So the very first thing, there's going to be five steps here.
29.00s: And at the end, the fifth step is going to walk us through some of the best practices that I've learned both from my personal experience,
35.40s: but then also observing other people in their natural habitat, working on these kinds of things.
40.20s: So the very first one is one I reference all the time.
42.80s: This is from Stephen Covey's Seven Habits of Highly Successful People, begin with the end in mind.
47.80s: This is in the Marine Corps, what we would call the desired end state.
51.52s: What are we trying to do?
52.92s: And most commonly, it's some derivative of this replace my income.
58.08s: People attempt to use investing in trading as a source of income so that they do not or not forced to work at a nine to five regular job.
66.56s: Okay, got that one pretty easy.
68.40s: The next step is we now need to take that end state, replacing our income, and we need to project it out in time.
74.68s: And then we need to quantify things.
76.28s: So these are the questions you have to ask yourself.
78.40s: When are you attempting to replace your income with your investing income?
82.52s: How much is your current income?
84.40s: A.K. How much investing income do you need?
86.68s: What are your expenses and what are your margins?
88.72s: This isn't necessarily used directly in these formulas.
91.48s: I'm going to share in a little bit, but it is more going to be a thing we want to track.
95.52s: Because that's going to be one of the most impactful early levers you can pull on to get your desired outcome.
101.24s: And then the last one is your future income references.
104.48s: This one is super important because a lot of people, when they're talking about this kind of planning,
110.24s: they tend to be super, super conservative.
112.92s: They'll say things like, oh, I just want this or I just want that.
117.40s: And maybe you do, but maybe you don't.
119.56s: Who's to say that the right retirement for you is just bare bones as little as you possibly need,
125.68s: but then you can't take vacations.
127.08s: You can't buy that fun car that you want to get.
129.28s: For me, I definitely am far more interested in fast fire.
133.00s: Financial independence, retire early is the fire part, but fat means you have a lot of money.
138.96s: It means you have to do things.
140.44s: So that's the very first junk you're going to run up to here.
143.40s: Do you want to be fat, meaning have a lot of money?
146.16s: If so, there's obviously burdens that come with that.
148.88s: You're going to have to figure out how to make more money, save more money,
150.96s: and you're probably going to have a slightly longer runway unless you hit it big, which is okay.
154.08s: But you have to identify truly for yourself what kind of retirement you prefer.
158.88s: If it's a, what we would call a green fire, exactly what it sounds like,
163.00s: it's essentially financial independence, retire early, but lean.
166.12s: You do it by cutting costs, living a rural life,
168.56s: and a lot of people are super fulfilled in doing that.
170.72s: You got to pick what's right for you.
171.92s: I definitely prefer fat fire, but plenty of people do and live completely fulfilled lives on lean fire.
177.64s: You got to figure out what this is, because it's a huge planning factor.
181.12s: Okay, so we got the first two steps.
182.56s: What is the current state in the Marine Corps?
185.36s: We would call this the orientation.
187.36s: We want to know where we're at right now.
188.88s: So what's your liquid net worth?
190.64s: This is a super important question because this essentially becomes your investible income.
195.84s: This is your principle that we can invest.
198.16s: So when I'm thinking about liquid net worth,
200.36s: I'm talking about money you can invest, not all of the cash you have,
204.04s: because you're going to want some of that emergency expenses and things like that.
207.28s: So liquid net worth in this context,
209.64s: I'm referring to the principle that you can invest.
212.28s: Next is your income, because this is going to tie into this later on,
216.84s: A.K.A. how much do you make now?
218.48s: How can we grow that and how much of it can we keep?
220.88s: And then the last one, this is another source of income for traders,
223.76s: which is your investing performance.
225.44s: In my opinion, I think you need to have at the very bare minimum,
229.16s: ultra minimum, a five year runway of how you've done over the past five years.
234.04s: With the objective being that in the more recent years on that,
237.16s: that you're starting to get more consistent.
239.48s: That part is super important because if you have a five year trading history,
242.76s: and it's all over the place, you can't really plan off of that.
245.92s: So that's why having a five year minimum,
248.48s: and if you get out of the gate running well,
250.40s: your first year is whatever,
251.60s: second year you're starting to get your feet under you,
253.40s: and then the next three years are pretty bang on the mark
255.84s: with what you're trying to do.
256.92s: Perfect.
257.44s: Most people it's going to be more than that.
258.92s: But the reason why I say five year minimum is because it typically will give you
262.00s: enough looks at different markets to have a pretty fair idea.
265.28s: But one of the things is if you are going through your planning cycle,
268.56s: and let's say you did it in 2012,
270.72s: when we went through literally a 10 year bull market,
273.24s: that's kind of difficult because you don't know how you're going to fare in a bear market.
276.24s: But that leads into some of our future points.
278.56s: So this is the variance that I was just referring to,
280.92s: and then the confidence interval.
282.28s: This is important.
283.12s: This tells you how confident you are in this as your future potential.
287.12s: A lot of people, when we're talking online or when we're talking to other people,
290.64s: we like to down to more confident than we might actually be.
294.60s: Be honest here.
295.36s: How confident are you in this because literally, quite literally,
298.88s: your future depends on it.
300.36s: So now we understand our current state.
302.64s: Let's talk about a roadmap.
303.84s: So with this is, I'm literally going to walk you through an example.
306.32s: So let's say that we want to retire in 10 years.
310.24s: Let's say that we want $200,000 per year.
313.76s: This is more of like a midfire slash lean fire,
317.04s: if you're in a high cost of living city.
318.68s: But you know, this can be adjusted to whatever you want.
321.76s: I'm just using numbers.
323.24s: So that's why these are like 10, 200, 200, 1000.
327.36s: These are very easy for you to adjust to your current scenario.
330.40s: So let's say we want $200,000 per year post taxes.
333.72s: Our current net worth is $200,000.
336.12s: And your savings rate is $1,000 a month.
338.16s: I will tell you right out of the gate.
339.12s: That's way too low of a savings rate.
340.52s: But I'm just throwing something out there
341.76s: based on these numbers at least.
343.04s: Okay, so let's take a look at this scenario.
344.72s: Let's say that you're a trader with at least five years of experience.
347.64s: And in those five years,
348.76s: you're averaging your compound annual growth rate
351.12s: is around 20% per year.
352.48s: Means you're doing great.
353.32s: So this is the growth phase of our account.
357.00s: And then there's a maintenance phase.
358.64s: The reason why I differentiate between these two
361.04s: is because I do not personally want to have to maintain
365.56s: essentially my top line performance into perpetuity
368.76s: in order to live off of it.
369.84s: The very stressful way to do things.
371.84s: So the way that I think about it is we have a growth phase
374.08s: where we're more aggressive more on top of it.
375.84s: But then we ease off the gas
377.60s: once we start getting closer to our metric
379.24s: so that we can actually just fuck out a little bit.
381.36s: Enjoy the stuff that we're working on.
383.24s: So think of it this way.
384.40s: Growth phase is what gets you to your maintenance phase.
386.76s: Maintenance phase is supposed to be a little bit easier
388.72s: and more reliable for you to hit.
390.28s: All right, so back over to this.
391.52s: As you can see, at a 20% growth rate with this information,
395.00s: you're gonna have 1.55 million and 10 years.
398.44s: Does this get you to your 10% at 10% maintenance?
402.36s: Does this get you to your $200,000?
404.20s: No, it gets you to $150,000.
406.16s: So we are short.
407.48s: This is not what we're looking for.
409.16s: So in this case, we have to figure out how to fix this thing
411.64s: because we want to make sure that we are again on target.
415.56s: So in this case, we have three things
418.36s: that we could take a look at and they're right here.
420.44s: We can look at our savings rate.
421.68s: We can look at the timeframe.
422.88s: We can look at our rate of return
424.96s: and my overall way to approach this is
428.16s: to use all of them.
429.08s: You don't have to just pick one.
430.60s: I certainly wouldn't if it were me.
432.56s: So let's talk about how we can use these different levers.
435.24s: If we change our savings rate,
437.16s: if we're able to increase our savings rate
439.88s: from $1,000 to $2,500 per month,
443.72s: that gets you to your $2,000,000,
445.04s: everything else being the same, setter is parabys.
447.80s: Or you can look at the timeframe.
449.52s: If we instead keep the same performance
451.76s: but instead of this 10 years to retire,
453.80s: we move to 12 years.
455.08s: That gets you to 2.26 million, you've met your mark.
458.28s: Or you can play with your return.
460.80s: So let's say if you can go from 20% return to 23% return,
464.48s: that gets you to 1.95 million again in this timeframe.
468.08s: Now, really important note, this is all pre-tax.
470.80s: A lot of this will depend on the rest of your tax footprint,
473.12s: but the point I'm showing you is based on these three inputs,
477.08s: you will affect the outcome up here,
480.44s: which is exactly what we're trying to do.
483.00s: So think of what of these you can adjust
485.64s: and how aggressively you can adjust it,
487.32s: maybe instead of going from one case savings,
489.20s: you go to 2K, but then you go from 10 years to 11 years.
492.52s: Maybe that's fine for you.
493.60s: There's a million different ways you can do this,
495.44s: but it's all gonna be based on your current performance,
498.20s: what you're able to maintain into perpetuity,
500.68s: and then how much slack you're giving yourself
503.08s: in terms of your timeframe.
504.08s: All right, I wanna talk now about some of the best practices.
508.00s: You gotta start with what you have.
509.20s: What this means is most people,
511.00s: they are scared to start even the conversation of this
515.56s: because they don't know these variables,
517.12s: they haven't thought about it,
518.04s: they don't even know where to start,
519.12s: we're actually having this dialogue
520.48s: in my free outlier discord right now.
522.96s: So you can hop in there,
524.08s: the link is in the show notes below, like I said, it's free,
526.56s: but this is an important thing is just start,
528.76s: just start with something,
529.96s: because just like a trading plan,
531.44s: just like a trading log,
532.48s: if you start the process of writing this stuff down,
535.36s: you will start to at least get something going,
538.64s: and then you can move it forward from there.
540.40s: So just start with what you have,
541.80s: think about your current savings, that's fine.
543.80s: And then move from there.
544.72s: This is, I cannot overemphasize this.
547.64s: You have to be honest with yourself
548.96s: when you're looking at these things,
549.96s: there's probably gonna be some stuff
551.32s: you're not comfortable with,
552.40s: because to be completely honest,
554.08s: this is why most people don't do it,
556.08s: is because they don't like the answer
557.48s: that they think they're gonna see.
558.88s: AKA if you looked at all that and you're like,
560.52s: damn, I'm gonna have to do this for 30 years.
562.96s: Yeah, that sucks, but the only way to affect it
565.52s: is to acknowledge it exists,
567.32s: and then do something about it.
568.80s: So you gotta be honest,
569.60s: when we're talking about these different return potentials,
572.40s: in this scenario, it is extremely important to be conservative,
575.44s: I cannot overemphasize that.
577.08s: So if you think you could scrape by maybe,
581.04s: taking the bike to work a few weeks,
583.60s: instead of driving to get you to a higher savings rate,
587.24s: maybe that's not super conservative,
589.28s: and highly fallible,
590.84s: be conservative in your numbers and be realistic.
593.12s: So this is probably one of the next most slept on aspects here,
597.60s: which is once we've defined what we're trying to do,
600.64s: is to break this out into our tracking metrics,
605.16s: because we have our 10-year goal,
606.52s: that's what we just created.
608.16s: So then if we think logically,
610.08s: that means five years down the line,
611.92s: we should be halfway to that goal.
613.96s: So what does that mean?
614.80s: It means each year, each month,
616.36s: we need to be in pursuit of this five year,
619.20s: and this 10-year goal,
620.12s: which if we did a good job planning them conservatively,
623.04s: we should be ahead of pace, typically, which is good,
626.24s: that's what we want,
627.08s: because guess what, life is going to happen,
629.12s: shit is going to happen,
630.28s: that's gonna set you back, it's how it goes.
631.80s: So think about these different metrics
634.28s: that support those longer term metrics.
637.60s: Early on, as I mentioned before,
639.40s: this is your biggest lever,
641.04s: this is the easiest thing you could do, is save money.
643.84s: So instead of trying to move from a 20% return
647.44s: to a 23% return, which might be really fucking hard,
651.24s: an easier thing would be just save an extra $200 a month,
654.56s: and those kinds of changes are massive.
657.00s: So think about saving first,
658.80s: but you can only save so much,
661.16s: you can only cut so many expenses,
663.24s: what I mean by saving, increasing your savings margins.
665.72s: You can only cut so many expenses,
667.16s: you still need to eat, you still need to do what you gotta do.
669.44s: So this is immediately your second priority,
672.84s: once you get to a good savings place, is more income,
676.00s: whether it's side hustles,
677.24s: whether it's creating another side business,
679.76s: whatever you have to do to start creating more income,
682.04s: it's gotta happen, and it's gotta happen,
683.84s: as fast as humanly possible,
685.16s: because this increases our savings margins,
688.44s: that's the whole point.
689.24s: And then the last thing here, Udalupe and CPI,
691.64s: Udalupe sounds really weird.
693.00s: This is actually from a book
695.20s: that a lot of marine officers have to read,
696.96s: and it's a decision cycle of a fighter pilot,
699.56s: and you can look it up,
700.84s: but essentially what I'm referring to here is,
703.16s: this is Observe Orient Decide Act.
705.60s: This means this is a perpetual review
708.32s: of where you currently are in this process,
710.92s: and then what needs to happen to get you there,
712.72s: because let's say for a couple months,
714.40s: you're slightly behind pace,
715.68s: but at the end of the year, you're above pace.
717.92s: Well, that's great.
718.76s: Maybe you can ease down your return targets,
721.12s: maybe you can ease some of the savings,
722.76s: so that you can spend and enjoy now a little more,
724.64s: or maybe you can accelerate your time frame,
726.52s: but this is a perpetually adjusted process.
729.56s: And then the last thing here is CPI,
731.56s: continual process or continuous process improvements,
734.20s: exactly what it sounds like.
735.24s: These little things, none of this is complex.
738.16s: This is why I like investing so much,
740.40s: is because a knee and a thaw like myself can do this.
743.88s: All you have to do is create a little bit of planning,
747.20s: so metrics around that ultimate goal,
749.60s: and then go for it.
750.84s: But one of the worst possible things you could do
752.80s: is just think that life is gonna magic you there,
756.08s: because you're gonna look back after 20 years,
757.68s: you're gonna say, what the fuck just happened?
759.32s: And guess what, those 20 years are gonna be your best,
761.92s: possible compounding years that exists.
764.56s: So if this video is helpful,
766.00s: like share it with other people that need to do this,
768.32s: subscribe, be an outlier.
769.56s: I'll see you guys later.
