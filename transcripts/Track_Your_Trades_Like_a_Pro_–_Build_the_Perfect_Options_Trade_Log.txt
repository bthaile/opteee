0.16s: what's up outliers let's talk about
2.08s: building a trade log if you've heard me
4.96s: on YouTube at all I've talked about this
7.32s: because it is one of the most important
9.16s: things you can possibly do as a Trader
11.28s: so I'm going to walk you through a
12.76s: process of what this whole thing is how
15.28s: it looks and why you should consider it
17.72s: and then I'm going to walk you through
19.24s: an actual example in Google Sheets right
22.08s: now so you can see exactly how to go
24.36s: about building your own now a couple
26.96s: things the first thing is one of the
30.60s: absolute best outputs of building a
33.16s: trade log is the process of building it
36.04s: it's the same thing for building a
37.24s: trading plan the process of building of
40.08s: the log is really useful because it
42.56s: brings you closer to your strategies
44.28s: closer to the information and it makes
46.20s: you think analytically and forecast the
49.84s: kinds of things that you might want to
51.44s: track the other thing about building a
54.20s: trade log is you don't need to have the
56.36s: final solution to start my trade log
59.12s: continues to evolve I just wrapped up my
61.28s: 18th year of trading I went through a
64.00s: phase where it was handwritten then I
66.32s: realized handwritten kind of sucks
68.08s: because you can't conduct data analysis
70.24s: on it so then it went into manual input
73.16s: but that kind of sucked because it was
74.48s: taking me a long time to input all the
76.24s: things that I was trying to input then I
78.44s: went to full automation I was using
80.84s: different kinds of Integrations to pull
82.56s: all the information into a single spot
84.60s: with literally not having to input
86.64s: anything that kind of sucked because it
88.88s: started moving me further away from the
91.32s: individual trades I was placing and now
93.76s: we've gone essentially full circle not
95.68s: full circle partial Circle and I'm back
98.32s: to generally using manual inputs but
102.08s: rather than the Second Step where I was
104.08s: trying to track everything I've become
106.84s: really specific with what I track and
108.76s: we're going to talk about that entire
110.16s: process so the first thing why why a
113.04s: trade log and why is it that so many
116.84s: Traders trade without a trade log well
119.36s: the reason why they don't genuinely is
121.52s: because they're lazy the reason why
123.60s: they're lazy is a lot of us start
125.56s: trading thinking that this is going to
127.00s: be fast easy money and then as soon as
129.52s: you put something in front of somebody
130.96s: like building a trade log where you have
132.64s: to track things that sounds like work
134.64s: that sounds like the antithesis of the
136.72s: expectations of when we started this
138.24s: thing the sooner you can get over that
140.12s: the better off you're going to be so the
142.88s: trade log is designed to complement the
145.68s: trade plan which I have a video that
147.84s: talks about both of those in detail I'll
150.36s: throw that in the description below but
152.84s: the trade plan is where we outline our
156.08s: ideas as we think we're going to do
158.48s: something we include our research how
161.28s: stuff is worked based on back testing
163.68s: that kind of stuff then the trade log is
166.44s: where we actually see the results we
169.12s: track the results now one of the cool
171.56s: things about a trade log is I use the
174.16s: same trade log for tracking things that
176.40s: are both live trades but then paper
178.60s: trades variations
180.56s: guess what that does it gives you a
183.80s: massive amount of information to make
185.84s: decisions off of because the second and
188.84s: third bullet points in this section over
190.56s: here you have a unbelievable amount of
195.40s: cognitive biases in the way that you
197.36s: perceive information react to
198.84s: information digest and analyze things
201.68s: some of them will be conscious you will
203.00s: be aware of it some of it you won't so
205.68s: the way we use a log is to Short Circuit
209.12s: those to make sure that we're not
211.24s: applying Goldilocks analysis and saying
213.96s: oh yeah you know I thought I made some
215.68s: money on that trade and then when you go
217.52s: back and look including fees it was a
219.24s: loss or if you're an options Trader and
221.68s: you're rolling options for 6 months and
223.56s: you're like man I'm so glad I got out of
225.68s: this thing out of profit but then you
228.40s: realize once you calculate the total
231.76s: returns over that six-month time frame
233.32s: you're like well crap I have essentially
235.80s: nothing to show for it sure I got out of
237.72s: those series of roles for a small profit
240.60s: but then if I look at the overall return
242.04s: on that money for that time frame it's
243.84s: not good so coming to reality with stuff
246.68s: like that is very important now the last
249.64s: Point here is designed to frame a
252.52s: thought for you building a trade log can
254.92s: be overwhelming but if you're planning
257.40s: to trade for a long duration of time a
260.64s: trade log is essentially bookkeeping
262.88s: this is what businesses do this is how
265.08s: businesses make decisions and survive
267.84s: and last the sooner that we accept that
271.00s: there's work to be done as a Trader and
273.56s: if we Embrace this work and get over it
275.92s: and get on board with it the faster
277.32s: you're going to see results so the how
280.88s: what kind of things belong in a trade
283.36s: log the way that my mind buckets it is
287.36s: there are things that we need to track
289.80s: for every individual kind of log we
293.96s: might build then there are elements that
297.16s: are going to be highly specific
300.28s: to the individual strategies that we're
303.20s: building so let me show you what this
304.72s: looks like what I do is use different
309.60s: tabs for different strategies so
311.88s: strategy one gets its own tab strategy
314.16s: two gets its own Tab3 gets its own tab
317.48s: paper trading strategy 1 gets its own
319.64s: tab so on and so forth and then I
321.92s: summarize all of these individual sheets
324.48s: within the tab itself and then also I
328.44s: pull out the requisite detail details
330.08s: into a C2C tab C2C in the military
333.08s: stands for command and control but I
334.96s: want to show you take a look at our
336.68s: sample log that I'm going to be showing
339.12s: you so we have a coverage strangle tab
341.32s: here if you're following the coverage
342.64s: strangle videos that I've been doing you
344.36s: will have seen a lot of these then I
346.84s: have things for single options then I
348.92s: have another tab for box spreads but the
351.12s: C2C tab is going to collate all of them
355.36s: into one visual spot for me think of it
357.32s: like a dashboard so what you'll notice
359.96s: is that these different strategies will
361.80s: have things in common but then these
363.40s: different strategies will have unique
365.88s: elements that matter for the strategy
368.28s: itself so the way that I think about
371.44s: building this is the C2C tab gets built
374.84s: as you go along because you'll get a
376.68s: sense of the things that you might want
378.04s: to include then for the individual
381.28s: strategy tabs before you start building
384.36s: anything trying to figure out the
385.64s: layouts we want to keep a few things in
387.72s: mind the first thing is we want to make
391.04s: sure that we can conduct actual data
393.68s: analysis to see what's going on to track
397.32s: Trends so we want to keep that in mind
399.96s: in terms of how we set things up what
402.68s: doesn't work well for data analysis is
406.08s: if you have an individual sell like this
408.92s: and you do something like today I sold
412.56s: five puts for
414.96s: $2 in GameStop and made $1 right like
420.88s: you can't do anything with this this is
423.60s: effectively useless so we want to think
426.48s: about the data points that matter to us
428.44s: based on the strategy and then create a
430.92s: format to pull them out the other thing
434.28s: is you want to make sure that you keep
436.12s: it
437.36s: consumable in the beginning you will
440.24s: probably overtrack things and that's
442.72s: okay the reason why it's okay is overt
445.52s: tracking in the beginning is part of the
447.40s: process of clearly identifying the
449.64s: things that actually matter for what
452.32s: you're doing then once you get a sense
455.32s: of that you start to dial in what things
458.48s: actually matter for the individual
459.92s: strategies which you'll get a sense of
462.32s: so I think for the outlier approach to
466.60s: trading which we leverage things like
468.60s: the outlier strategy process and the
470.72s: outlier trade process I will throw links
473.48s: to both of those videos it's available
475.00s: for everybody they're just Frameworks to
476.96s: think about trading I'll throw links to
478.96s: those in the description but based on
481.12s: those you will be familiar with these
482.68s: things things like profit mechanisms
484.96s: profit mechanism qualities profit
486.88s: mechanism signals based on the
489.52s: individual strategies and its requisite
492.48s: details pertaining to these topics I can
495.96s: think of
497.36s: different different metrics that will be
500.68s: relevant to the individual thing that
502.72s: I'm trying to track so the last thing is
508.44s: try and be
510.04s: efficient so when I'm setting up the
513.88s: sheets as you'll see in a minute I try
516.48s: to make it so that it's a Light Lift
519.08s: easy to move easy to replicate easy to
522.04s: adjust if you make it to be really
524.44s: really annoying then it'll be a bear to
527.20s: deal with and you probably won't want to
529.68s: so let's take a first look at the
532.40s: covered strangle strategy this is the
536.04s: summary tab for an individual strategy
539.16s: in this this case the coverage strangle
540.44s: and again you all will have seen a bunch
542.08s: of different versions of this for those
543.36s: that are unfamiliar I'm doing a subset
546.12s: of my broader portfolio and I'm trading
548.20s: the coverage strangle in these four
549.96s: different names tqs U proo ibit GameStop
553.28s: and I'm essentially using this as an
555.12s: example to just show a bunch of things
556.84s: about trading and my Approach so what
559.56s: you'll notice is on the top I have
561.96s: overall aggregate level details I want
564.92s: to see how much premium is open at a
567.24s: given point in time I want to know what
569.16s: the total p&l is I want to know how many
571.44s: trades are open I want to know our
573.56s: distance off of 52e highs why do I care
576.24s: about the distance off of 52 we highs
578.56s: because in my trade plan for these
580.52s: strategies that informs some of my
582.72s: sizing decisions I have a column here
585.76s: for notional value the reason why I have
587.72s: notional value is because tqs and upro
590.56s: are leveraged so what that means is if I
593.68s: have a total dollar utilization in tle
596.04s: Q's of
597.68s: $44,000 600
599.84s: 65 that's not really the risk that that
603.32s: represents it represents broader risk
606.04s: because it's three times leveraged do I
608.12s: track that here then we have overall
611.28s: dollar utilization so how much money is
614.36s: tied up in the trade right now so that
617.12s: includes both cash secured puts and long
619.68s: shares and you can see that I break that
621.36s: out here so that I can say okay right
624.68s: now I'm only actually a little bit in
627.96s: equity outright for q's and I'm mostly
630.96s: in cash secured puts does that reflect
633.36s: what I want to have right now then I
637.28s: start with I don't know why I naturally
639.64s: went right to left I think that shows
641.32s: how backwards my brain is but the
644.20s: starting point here is the allocation so
646.28s: what I do is I say of the portfolio how
649.04s: much money do each of these individual
651.76s: trades get for this strategy so for tqs
655.04s: it got 100,000 you proo 200,000 I bit
657.68s: 125 GameStop
659.88s: so far and again these are subsets of
662.92s: the broader portfolio but this is the
665.00s: same process I follow across the broader
667.16s: portfolio so now let's take a look at
669.60s: one of these and I'm actually in my
672.44s: actual log these are all linked right so
675.00s: it takes me right to it the links break
677.04s: when I copy and paste it it's kind of
678.48s: annoying but that's what these are so if
681.80s: we take a look at tle Q's you can see
683.80s: that this is the total log here and
687.04s: based on this total log I have about all
689.40s: all of the details I use to make
692.96s: decisions I summarize things on the left
696.40s: hand side for the total position and
698.88s: then I track all of the individual stuff
701.80s: here in the center I split short puts
705.40s: short calls that are open and then I
708.40s: have sections to track the closed
710.44s: versions of those trades then you might
712.96s: ask well why don't I just put the closed
716.56s: up here below this section well it's
719.28s: because I tend to trade more puts than
721.40s: calls so then this would push the call
724.72s: section down too far over time so that I
726.96s: have to scroll a lot again even though I
729.84s: prefer manual inputs I have to be
732.84s: thoughtful about what I'm doing and how
734.60s: I input things so that it's sustainable
738.04s: so then the other thing you'll notice is
739.64s: that there are some sections that are
741.40s: coded in green that represents elements
744.80s: that require my physical input then
747.84s: there are these sections over here which
749.60s: are automatically going to calculate
751.56s: based on these inputs over here so my
755.24s: goal is to make it really really easy
757.24s: for me to see where I need to input
760.80s: information and what information needs
763.12s: to go there so if we take a look you can
765.48s: see for the coverage triangle I'm
767.08s: tracking things like entry dat stock xir
769.84s: strike Delta Premium Lots now notice how
772.36s: I'm not tracking something like Theta
775.28s: and I'm not tracking something like Vega
778.16s: and the reason is because although I
780.72s: care about those metrics and they're
782.24s: actually part of my trading plan from a
785.28s: tracking perspective those don't really
788.84s: impact the breadth of what I'm doing
792.04s: even something like volatility which is
794.72s: in my trading plan in terms of how I
797.48s: think about selling but it's a secondary
800.20s: input in terms of how I think about
802.28s: selling my primary input for what I
804.56s: think about selling is what is the total
807.20s: amount of money this position gets how
809.16s: how much am I using right now how much
811.20s: is in stock how much is in cash secured
813.68s: puts does that align with what I want it
815.80s: to be today and if it does great if I
819.76s: take a look at my utilization and my
821.52s: utilization is low I don't really care
824.52s: what volatility is too much because I
827.40s: need to get the utilization to be what
829.20s: it should be based on what my
831.52s: disposition is and then the difference
833.80s: between buying stock outright or cash
835.64s: secured puts again is an artifact of my
839.32s: disposition not so much what volatility
841.36s: is there can be periods where volatility
843.00s: is low and I'll sell more sometimes
845.08s: because that's more advantageous
846.84s: sometimes if volatility is high I might
848.96s: sell more then it's based more on the
851.60s: utilization than trying to capitalize on
853.88s: volatility that is for this specific
856.36s: strategy the coverage strangle which
858.08s: I'll throw a playlist for in the notes
860.60s: below but this is really an entire
863.28s: strategy based around optimizing an
865.92s: underlying Buy and Hold Equity position
869.56s: so the options are ancillary here these
871.52s: are secondary the primary position are
874.76s: going to be the long Equity component so
877.72s: this is the log as it sits now another
880.04s: thing you'll notice in the coverage
881.12s: strangle log as I've built is I actually
883.36s: keep a little rolling option calculator
885.80s: off to the side here to help me analyze
888.36s: something like going on right here so we
890.64s: can see that this trade was actually
893.76s: adjusted so this trade started at at a
896.56s: two lot the opening premum premium that
899.40s: I gave it was 256 the closing premium
902.04s: when I took the trade down was $ 825 so
904.68s: then I opened up a new trade another two
907.12s: lot these should be the same format as
911.32s: this the opening premium for these were
914.00s: 8.5 so now this tells me exactly what I
917.72s: need this new option to be trading at in
920.40s: order to hit break even so what that
922.76s: means is this option right here which is
926.16s: at an 850 premium once it hits
930.24s: $281 that tells me that I will be at a
933.20s: break even so then if I close this trade
935.92s: for $281 cents it will net out wash this
940.84s: prior trade so I use that when I'm
943.44s: making adjustments everything in here is
946.36s: designed for a purpose so this is the
949.84s: covered strangle Tab and you'll notice
952.64s: that there's multiple covered strangles
954.16s: in here it's the same thing just several
956.60s: times and then I aggregate it up at the
958.56s: top
959.64s: now we can take a look at single trades
962.32s: single trades is something that shorter
966.28s: term in nature and this can be simple
969.56s: stuff like trading something
971.96s: directionally that's mostly what I find
973.80s: in here for things like trading
976.56s: volatility and whatnot I have separate
978.64s: tabs for those now the way that this
981.84s: one's built is also very purposeful
983.92s: you'll notice that I have all these
985.64s: different strategies up top and then it
988.24s: aggregates all of the total data based
990.60s: on the strategies this is the section
992.84s: for open trades then this is the section
996.00s: that collates all the Clos trades so now
1000.28s: the way this works is let's say today is
1002.16s: 16 Jan I have stock XYZ it's at 10 bucks
1005.76s: it's a five lot I'm going to look at the
1007.32s: 21 Feb expiration it's a 15 strike I
1010.88s: want to buy calls well what I do is I
1014.00s: find a call I find a 55 Delta call the
1016.92s: total premium to get into that is
1020.48s: $22.50 now one of the things you'll
1022.68s: notice right out of the gate is it does
1025.84s: a bunch of math for me off to the side
1027.64s: and it actually helps me codify what the
1029.76s: strategy is right out of the gate this
1031.28s: is just with a formula so then what I do
1033.80s: is I say okay what's the margin
1035.48s: requirement for this Trade A lot of
1037.48s: times I'll just use the total cost right
1040.04s: because when you're buying options
1042.00s: that's typically what it'll be and then
1044.92s: for short options I'll use whatever the
1047.80s: broker tells me the margin requirement
1049.40s: is then I'll input whatever my risk is
1052.24s: the risk is defined at entry this is
1055.60s: where I say when am I going to get out
1058.04s: of this trade based on the chart so if
1059.84s: I'm trading a long call it's based on a
1061.44s: breakout wherever I decide based on my
1064.08s: analysis where if it breaks down below
1065.68s: that level I would get out that's what
1067.16s: gets input here so let's say at that
1069.68s: point I lose 500 bucks that's my total
1073.36s: risk so now this is the open trade as it
1076.76s: sits and you can see that there's a gray
1078.84s: section here this is what I input when
1081.52s: I'm actually exiting the trade so let's
1084.04s: say it's the 16th of Jan the stock goes
1086.88s: up to $12 and then let's say that I
1089.28s: close this for
1090.72s: $2.75 great so now I have a sense of
1095.32s: what the actual move was but when I look
1098.28s: at this well I see 26 25 that's way too
1101.56s: high so what happened here really simple
1104.32s: we have to pay attention to the signage
1106.16s: that we use and whatever we codify into
1108.24s: our plan so for me if it's a debit I use
1111.28s: negative numbers meaning money has gone
1113.08s: out now all of a sudden the p&l is
1115.84s: accurate it makes sense so we just take
1118.44s: this this trade is closed we copy it
1120.80s: paste it down here and then you'll
1122.60s: notice that it'll start to aggregate all
1124.56s: these different trades and you can make
1126.36s: this as customizable as you want let's
1128.48s: say that I'm trading a ratio called
1130.08s: diagonal where I have a long option leg
1132.56s: and then a short option leg easy I
1135.12s: literally just copy and paste this down
1137.16s: whatever it is and instead of doing a
1139.48s: five lot since we normally do a ratio
1141.28s: maybe it's a a two lot and normally we
1143.60s: sell these closer in time so maybe we do
1145.76s: this for 17 Jan instead and the strike
1149.00s: price will typically be a little bit
1151.28s: different then the long call will be a
1153.40s: little further out of the money so maybe
1154.68s: this is like 25 and let's say that the
1156.60s: short call is like a 30 Delta well I
1159.08s: want to know though that this is part of
1160.92s: a ratio call diagonal not a long call
1162.88s: and a short call so all I do is drop a
1164.88s: dash in there drop a dash in here the
1167.32s: dash tells me that there's another
1170.08s: component to this trade another leg but
1172.68s: this is the base leg so this is the base
1175.52s: leg for this line item which is the long
1177.52s: call this is the base leg for this line
1179.48s: item which is the short call and you can
1181.88s: see that it automatically changes the
1183.76s: strategy to be what I want ratio called
1185.76s: diagonal so this is the process for
1188.60s: singles and then I have another one for
1190.32s: box spreads there is a video that I have
1192.92s: that talks about this this sheet itself
1195.16s: is available to those in the patreon you
1196.96s: can go download it from the shop for
1198.88s: free and yeah so this is like a really
1201.44s: easy tool to help me track box spreads
1203.48s: let's take a look at C2C C2C I have a
1206.72s: couple different sections now this is a
1208.68s: really broken down version of what I
1210.92s: have just because mine is very noisy but
1213.36s: I'm giving you some ideas on tools that
1215.08s: you might want to include in yours this
1217.44s: section represents portfolio level
1220.08s: tracking metrics so these are things
1222.24s: like what's the beginning value of the
1223.52s: portfolio how much money have I made how
1225.88s: much is my current Theta a comp
1228.64s: comparison against a reference return of
1230.48s: some sort is designed to be a drop down
1232.40s: in my main one where it'll say based on
1235.48s: whatever this percentage is it'll do the
1237.16s: math here based on the portfolio value
1239.60s: and it'll just tell me what the overall
1241.24s: sizing would be I can also just input it
1243.96s: manually I could say well I want to put
1245.32s: on a $5,000 trade and this will tell me
1248.32s: how much that is of the total portfolio
1251.32s: so just little tools like that to help
1253.68s: the day-to-day stuff be a little bit
1256.00s: easier then I have a total section
1259.32s: that collates everything from the
1261.68s: subsections down here so this section is
1264.40s: going to use all of these different
1266.24s: details to summarize so right now I can
1268.72s: see of my $600,000 portfolio right now
1272.80s: I'm using $748,000 in terms of
1275.84s: allocation in terms of actual
1277.88s: utilization I'm only using 532 the
1280.96s: difference between allocation is how
1282.36s: much money I'm setting aside to do
1283.76s: something utilization is how much I'm
1285.56s: using at a given point in time then I
1288.12s: purpos have a section that takes out box
1290.40s: spreads the reason why I want to take
1291.76s: out box spreads is because a lot of
1293.60s: times box spreads are tied to other
1295.56s: trades but it's a place that I park cash
1297.40s: to be more efficient then we have
1299.96s: notional exposure the reason why we have
1302.32s: notional exposure is because if I'm
1303.96s: trading leveraged
1306.04s: underlyings I want to know what my
1308.56s: actual risk is so a good example of that
1311.24s: is here in the coverage triangle because
1312.76s: as I showed you we're trading uo and tqs
1315.80s: so when I'm figuring out what my total
1318.60s: exposure is I don't want to just use my
1321.36s: actual dollar utilization because even
1324.32s: though this is the max I could
1325.88s: technically R risk at a given point in
1328.00s: time the notional exposure will help me
1331.20s: understand how levered I am and give me
1334.28s: some sense of the total risk there again
1336.40s: this is an aggregate level tab then I
1339.92s: have just some Standard Market tracking
1342.24s: stuff how far we are off of highs and
1345.52s: off of local highs for different indices
1348.28s: a watch list and stuff to do and then
1350.68s: just some basic calculators over here
1353.56s: then this is where I would continue
1355.40s: building out other sections this would
1357.68s: actually be input in here so I took it
1361.20s: out to make it look a little easier to
1363.20s: see but the way that this would actually
1365.36s: look is this would go down here then all
1368.32s: of this would slide
1370.88s: up into this and then all of this would
1374.36s: be filled in and I would apply the same
1376.60s: lines and all that stuff to make it easy
1378.12s: for me to see and each of these would go
1380.68s: to the individual tabs to pull together
1383.84s: the Futures tab everything that's going
1385.80s: on in the Futures Trading space the
1387.72s: ratio diagonals and so on and so forth
1391.40s: this is literally a step-by-step process
1393.28s: on how you build a log you start by the
1396.04s: individual tabs you track the things
1399.12s: that you need but you make it so that
1400.96s: you can conduct broader analysis what I
1403.76s: typically do is you'll notice that I set
1405.92s: space off to the side here so that I can
1408.68s: write different formulas to test
1410.68s: different ideas I don't bother with
1412.28s: graphs and stuff like that I know people
1413.92s: like those kind of visuals I think
1415.80s: they're fine but I don't need it it's
1417.72s: just stuff that gets in the way I can
1419.28s: just see the numbers but if you like
1421.80s: graphs and stuff you can build all of
1423.76s: those off to the side or up here if
1425.32s: you're so inclined but the idea is to
1427.72s: outline what you need then figure out a
1430.72s: format that allows you to input the
1432.96s: details that you need efficiently and
1435.84s: you start a little bit by overt tracking
1438.76s: but then you back off of overt tracking
1442.40s: the reason why you back off is so that
1443.84s: you'll actually adhere to the process if
1446.88s: you have too much in here you simply
1448.64s: won't do it that's not a good approach
1451.40s: then the other thing to note is you can
1453.80s: input comments in here if you're you
1456.84s: know filling in something you're like oh
1458.48s: crap I forgot what this acronym means or
1461.28s: what I meant when I said percent capture
1464.04s: which for me it's just how much of the
1465.84s: actual premium did I capture stuff like
1467.88s: that
1468.92s: so if you have any questions let me know
1471.88s: go out there and build a log it'll help
1475.96s: you a lot I literally literally promise
1479.24s: you that building this will at least
1482.12s: give you more information to make better
1485.08s: decisions as a Trader be out see y later
