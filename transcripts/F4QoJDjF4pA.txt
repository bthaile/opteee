 What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the Outlier podcast. I have my friend, Joe here. And you and I connected what, like two years ago or something like that now? Been a while, man. Yeah. Yeah. I like originally reached out to you when I first started YouTube, just to try to like figure out how to not completely dork everything up as I've done anyways, you know, against your best advice. So I guess I am a poor two to a two to a lich in that sense. But I am absolutely stoked to connect with you a little bit. And you bring a different perspective than what a lot of my standard audiences used to seeing. So as we were talking about right before we started recording, a lot of like active trading derivatives style stuff. And you spread a pretty wide gamut of things. And I know a lot of what I see on your channel is kind of like the dividend investing side of things that seems to be something your audience likes a lot. So I'd love to start with generalized backgrounds. Obviously you spent some time in the Marine crops, which is how we came into contact together. And then so I'd love to learn a little bit more about your military experience and then making the transition from there. Sure. Sure. Well, yeah. Spent a time in the Marine Corps as an at armor, got out in 2001, you know, just before just before it really hit the fan, obviously. And you know, always knew I liked making my money work for me, right? You know, corporal in the Marine Corps doesn't get doesn't make a whole lot of money. So you got to have that money working for you. So I got really heavy into investing. Of course, 2001, 2002, this was just as the real estate bubble was starting to inflate. So everybody was getting making money in real estate. And and I wanted a piece of that action. So I got started, you know, went back to school, went back to college and got my degrees there, finance and communication studies and you know, started on the real estate side was a real estate analyst. Of course, that all blew up in 2000 and, you know, 2007, 2008. And of course, it's it's weird because, you know, my professional career, the career, the career path that I thought I was going to take into real estate as an analyst and investor and that blew up just as the, you know, when I just first started investing in 1999, you know, blew up as well. So so I seem to have a knack for finding things, making an inflection point in my life. And then it just blowing up completely. So we're still waiting for the third act on that one. But anyway, so I, you know, I've spent some time in real estate, you know, when that all blew up, I kind of transitioned into equity analysis, stock analysis. I worked in venture capital firm for in a Canadian venture capital firm set up their cell side division and worked that. So I was a professional analyst for about 10 years. And then finally decided, you know, with these 80 hundred hour work weeks were for the goals. So, you know, I started kind of free lancing while I was building up my digital assets, my online business with blogs and then filing with YouTube, really trying to build my own assets and something that I actually own, right? Because, you know, anyone that's, you know, anyone in finance, they could tell you, they worked their balls off, but they own nothing, right? So they have to constantly be grinding that wheel. So I built up my online assets and here we are. You know, I love talking about stocks still, love watching my money grow and having it work for me. And I love being able to bring that that professional equity analyst background to YouTube where, you know, you know, you don't often get something like that. Probably a little bit longer term investing style, then, then what a lot of a lot of people are, I like to, I do like to swing trade. So, you know, three, three months, one year kind of kind of trades. But then beyond that, kind of try to take it easy and just let the money work, work its way out. You know, so I use, I use options for swing trading, but also for hedging longer term, you know, and then futures, it's probably usually, usually futures only in the forex sense. So, you know, times like now where the dollar is completely ridiculously overvalued and has been for the better part of a year, then I'll put on a futures trade, you know, short the dollar into some other stuff. But then, but mostly it's just stocks, you know, stocks for the long term growth stocks. I do, everybody likes to make that cash money on the dividends, but it's kind of hard to get rich with dividends. So, so I kind of stick to the the growth stocks, tech stocks, things that are going to multiply your money, get that portfolio to the point where you need it. So, you can be living off your dividends one day. A bunch of questions. Yeah, the so the very first one, not market related yet, did you think at any point that you were going to like be a YouTuber? Did that ever cross your mind? Sure. Well, I mean, we didn't even, there wasn't a YouTube until 2006. So, right, you know, so I was, I was already, you know, 30 years, 30 years old before YouTube was a thing, right? And then, and even then it was for gamers and I don't know, weirdos, you know, 14 year olds that would 14 year olds that would soon become, you know, the biggest YouTuber in the world, right? I think Mr. Beast had his in 2006, 2008, something like that. But yeah, no, I didn't. I started blogging in 2013, right? When I, you know, finished on my equity analyst career, really trying to start building those online assets. And I started the YouTube channel in 2015, but only as a way to put videos, you know, host videos on YouTube so I could put them on my website so people who could watch them on the website and, you know, spend a little bit more time there. Didn't really think much of it. Until, you know, I saw a huge, huge spike in, in hits one day to my, to the website and what had happened is, you know, a friend of mine had that with the YouTube channel had talked about one of my, one of my posts and sent massive amounts of traffic. So I was like, well, shit, and this was 2007 team, by the way, two years after I had actually started the YouTube channel. I hadn't really done anything. I think I had 10 videos on it in two years. And I thought, okay, well, you know, YouTube is a thing, I guess. So, so I started in 2017, December 2017, really putting videos on there for YouTube's sake to build that part of the business. And it's pretty much all YouTube now. You know, I love the face to face you get with people on YouTube. You just don't get that in blogging or even in podcasting if you're not real recording the video and posting it somewhere. So I love that sense of community you get with, with YouTube, really being face to face with people. Yeah, it's fascinating. The reason why I asked that question too is because I find my four what four ray into YouTube very similar. And I'm always wondering how other people came into a quick story that I think is kind of funny. We had a bee infestation outside my window here. So called a beekeeper came out helped us with the bees as he's leaving. He like looked at me and he's just like, he like a YouTuber or something. And at that point, I'd never touched any social media. I didn't even have an Instagram. So I thought it was the funniest thing on earth. I was like, no, like who's on like, why do you think I would be on YouTube? Right? Like just so crazy to me. No shit. By the next year, I had started a YouTube channel and had been off to the races. So this freaking, but you were, but you were, you were podcasting right at that point. So you had the setup. No, you just, he just asked if you were you that's kind of crazy out of blue. Yeah, the main thing is like we're fortunate. So we live in a nice house in a nice area. And I looked a little younger than I do now. So I think he saw younger dude in a nice place and he was curious like how that happened, right? That's pretty common out in California at least, but it's just so funny to me that like I thought that was the most ridiculous thing on planet earth. And so I should have told him, no, I just married a sugar mama. I told him I told him I was a prostitute. That's my go to. Yeah. Never anybody asked me what I do. I promise. Because if you think about it, which, which is crazy because because that's the more legitimate answer than, yeah, I'm a YouTuber. People still think, can you make money on that? Does that the thing? They're like, oh, yeah, that makes sense. You sell your body. I get it. Yeah. I mean my argument there is I feel like in a nutshell, we all are prostitutes because we're exchanging I'm an effort for money, just different kinds of effort. But okay. Yeah, I think I guess you could make that case for many, many other careers, but you know that they're there somehow prostituting there. That's exactly. Anyway, that's exactly it. But I just find that so funny because a lot of the people that I find that are doing really cool things on YouTube like you seem to just come across it randomly, right? Like you started YouTube channel. It's two years, 10 videos weren't doing anything and then all of a sudden, you know, your friend dropped you and it started taking off you're like, okay, I guess I'll do this too. Like that's so cool. Yeah. It's totally random. And the, you know, I will say I was fortunate enough to start in 2007 start relatively early, you know, even even 11 years after YouTube started. It was still relatively early and I had that benefit. And it's it is more competitive now, but it is still really early. It feels, it feels like, you know, there's even even at something like 26 million channels on YouTube. It is still an early time to start a YouTube channel. So for anyone out there that, you know, just wants to be heard, wants to make some money and wants to have, you know, wants to build something then YouTube is still the place to be. Yeah, I couldn't agree more with that. I mean, it's what the second largest search engine right now and the cool part about YouTube is even though there definitely is saturation, what I've come to appreciate is that there are areas for you to carve out for like your personality, your brand and what you do because somebody like you, even though YouTube started in oh six or whatever and at that point it was brand new, you would already been doing the finance thing for some time before that even started, right? So like you're coming to a place with a significant amount of experience that even though a brand new YouTuber might have really good marketing, now they don't have the experience you do. So that that part always provides a pretty strong differentiation, which leads me to my follow on. So I would love to know more about your experience, what you did and the overall perception you had of working at the VC firm and equity analysis. So you can start from the very beginning, specifically why that place and then you just kind of go from there. Sure, sure. Well, equity analysis, I mean anytime you start, anybody is starting equity analysis as an equity analyst, you always start as an associate, which is basically a peon, not only are you going to, you know, the go for going to get everything for everyone, but you're also really just doing cash flow modeling, right? You're sitting in front of a computer screen, nine, 10 hours a day, at least minimum, basically on an Excel spreadsheet and modeling out a company's cash flows, right? You know, everybody likes to follow income, net income, that's, you know, PE ratios, all that kind of crap that's on CNBC, it's easy, but that's not really where where investment analysis comes from. Investment analysis, you know, the way they do it is really modeling those cash flows, you know, how much cat free cash flow is the company have, how much is it going to be able to spin out to two investors, you know, theoretically if it wasn't saving it, saving it back for growth. And what's the value of that? You know, all those future cash flows, what's the value of that in the present and how does that on a per share basis? So you're basically just kind of, you know, a grunt, you know, to put it in a term we both know, you're basically just a grunt for on Excel for, yeah, 10 hours a day forever, forever, forever it seems. A year and a half, two years, then you get, sorry, sorry to interrupt, I just want to follow up on that first part first. So nine to 10 hours a day, working on cash flow analysis, can you walk me through like functionally what you're actually doing nine to 10 hours during the day? Like are you going to websites? Are you trying to like what are you functionally doing during that time frame? Sure. Well, a lot of it goes to the financial statements, right? You know, and a great, if anybody wants to learn real, real investment analysis, you know, the way the way they do it, to be able to to recommend stocks and all that, pick up at your local library and all copies of the CFA curriculum, right? The charter, charter financial analyst, you'll go in there and they've got, you know, everything from, I mean, it's a stack of books like like that, right? For each year, there's three levels of it, but you can do first level, second level, get those books and they'll walk you through everything from economic analysis, macro level analysis, all that. But the real, the real bed and bread and butter there is financial statement analysis, right? It's you go into that the income statement, the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. And really, again, you're looking at what the company has reported in the past, you know, the past five years or so. And then you're trying to model out into the future, what the future looks like. And of course, so one you've got management expectations, what they're saying on analyst calls, quarterly reports, what they're saying in their corporate, corporate presentations, what they're not saying is a lot of times very telling, right? So what happens is analysts, you know, most people don't realize it, but analysts usually only cover maybe a few industries or a one or two sectors, right? Because you have to get very good at those two, those industries or those sectors, right? So you might be a consumer staples analyst where you might be a hardware tech hardware analyst or something like that. And you get to know everything you can about the tech hardware industry, right? So you not only follow that company, but you follow all the companies in the industry. So five, six, 10 companies in that industry, you learn, okay, what do they typically talk about on their analyst calls? What are the metrics that really go with that industry? You know, what kind of growth is average? What kind of growth is medium? What their inventories look like? What their inventory spending looks like? And with that, you know, you get a feel for it. Like I said, what they are talking about and what they're not talking about, you know, if they're, if all the other competitors in the industry are talking about, you know, day sales outstanding or some of the other inventory measures. And there, it's conspicuously absent in, you know, whenever management talks about it to this other company, then you kind of wonder, okay, you know, why aren't they talking about it? And you research a little bit further. So you're looking at financial statements all day, you're digging through the notes to the financial statements to see how they're accounting for things on those financial statements, because, you know, even though there's, well, called GAP, generally accepted accounting principles, kind of guidances for how companies need to, you need to account for different things like revenue and expenses. There's a lot of leeway in there that companies have found, you know, ways around to make their own, you know, accounts look better or, or, or, or something. So you're digging through those. And then again, you're, you know, you're trying to model out what they've done in the past, what, you know, maybe, maybe your macro people, because usually a lot of times you're, your analysts, they're just doing those cash flow models and the financial statement analysis. Then the firm has, you know, maybe macro level people, so economic people that are saying, okay, the general economy is going to grow this much over the next three to five years. And you've got kind of models that say, okay, you know, if the general economy grows, if GDP grows two to three percent, then we can probably say maybe seven to 10 percent or 15 percent growth in this industry, right? And you've got other industry analysts telling you that as well. So you're applying some of those numbers that you have as well as what management at all 10 of these companies in the industry are saying, and you're trying to model out. Okay, what do I think sales are going to be for each of these 10 companies in the industry? Who's got the better expense management? What are their expenses are going to be? Who is, you know, has capital expenditures that are just running away? And maybe that's going to deflate their earnings a little bit. So you're really trying to get a feel for, you know, what earnings, what net income is going to be over the next over the next five years. You're modeling out their cash flows again, very important that you adjust the income statement to their cash flows, which is, you know, because, okay, the income statement is all those accounting shenanigans that everybody everybody uses. And nobody really says anything until something goes wrong, right? Until you got a super micro computer and somebody calls them out on it and the stock falls apart, you know, everybody does those kinds of accounting shenanigans, those manipulations to make their revenue look higher, their expenses look lower and make their net income look better. But nobody ever really says anything because that's a game everybody plays and everybody knows it. So you kind of try and do a kind of trying to think through, okay, the income statement has all these accounting shenanigans, these manipulations on it. The cash flow statement is actual cash generated by operations cash spent in investments and that free cash flow that is basically theoretically what kind of cash the company has left over after paying their capital expenditures from their operating cash flow. So you're really trying to tie those two statements together and see what that cash flow looks like and really, you know, which companies are the better at it in this industry, in your industry, right? So again, you know, it's a lot of work you're looking through industry reports, you're following if there's any industry magazines or, you know, industry research, you're following that. So it's not really, I mean, you're not just sitting at your desk watching an Excel screen all day long, you're building up all this information, this research that goes into, okay, you know, what's a good rate of growth for sales for a company that has this kind of market share, who has the market share in the industry and how is that changing among companies? So it's, I mean, that's why equity analysts get paid a lot of money, right? So, but it's also it's also a lot of work, you know, it's written in the Wall Street Journal probably last week and it kind of brought a lot of realities or a lot of memories back to me because it was all about, you know, the the hours of work in investment banking and equity analysis and how a lot of these these junior bankers and junior analysts are being overworked. Of course, we never said we were overworked when we were, you know, back in the back in the early 2000s and that that time, but and how they're coping with it with, you know, 80 HD medications and Red Bull, Red Bull laced with Riddlein and all that kind of good stuff. So it's just kind of a fact of life for, you know, for bankers and for equity analysts. So, you know, I did that for a few years, figured out that, you know, I wanted a little bit of change. I wanted to, in something a little bit, you know, prior to equity analyst analysis. So I started looking at venture capital, worked in venture capital firm for a couple of years and then was hired by a Canadian venture capital firm called High Alert Partners to put together their cell side division. So I managed a team of about six other analysts and we kind of analyzed stocks and analyzed, you know, other pre IPO private companies for the for the owner and kind of drove drove business that way. Fascinating. And so first off, thank you for the detail on just what the day to day looks like. I think that's one of the things that a lot of people that don't work in the industry never get a sense of unless they have an opportunity to talk to somebody like you. So yeah, you know, watch CNBC or YouTube. I mean, I think more people get their stock picks and information from YouTube now than CNBC. But you watch and you watch these guys, myself included. I never go into that much detail. I mean, I do a lot of the work behind the scenes, but I don't go into that much detail as far as, okay, this is why I'm picking this stock. I've modeled out these five years of cash flow for this company. I think it looks great. I think it's worth much more than people are paying for the shares right now. So you can't get a sense that it is just that easy. You just, you know, hey, look at the biggest thing I hate on YouTube right now is just the chart porn, right? People look at, oh man, look at it in video. Look at that chart right there. That looks beautiful. Yeah. By that, it must be, it must be going that way in the future. But that's what a lot of YouTube is now. It's just that chart porn also that people, you know, you know, finger, finger, FN year, the chart and thinking it's going to keep on going just like that. So, so yeah, you people don't get a sense that of what investing really is and how, you know, how professional it can actually be if you actually are actually doing the work behind it. Yeah, but it's much easier just to be degenerate and just say stonks go up and then just go load. Yeah. And I don't know. I mean, I guess I've benefited from the ease of having a YouTube channel just as much as anyone, right? You know, you don't need, you don't need experience. You all you need is a camera and camera and an opinion. And that's great to, you know, bring more people, give people the opportunity to have a business of their own. But yeah, it's not the greatest, not the best way to invest if that's all you're doing is following a chart up or or, you know, just following easy stuff like the P ratio and saying, oh, well, this is a cheap stock. It must be a good deal. Which is interesting. Are you familiar with Wesley Grey's work in momentum? No. So he's a, he's a marine dude, solid, solid guy. And he runs Alpha Architect, which is a big ETF fund. But anyways, he is a momentum junkie. That's what he spent a lot of time on his PhD working on. And he's come up with a lot of different factors with respect to momentum, frog, and the pan concept. The Cliff notes version to this whole thing is one of the dominant factors with respect to momentum is obviously an X period lagging return. So six months, 12 months, both tend to be pretty efficacious. And they tend to resist the short term turnaround effect of other things that three months has a strong turnaround effect. But what they found is when you overlay that with some of these fundamental indicators, like you're talking about like PE ratio or peg ratio or free cash flow that it can massively improve the performance of the system, which is interesting. But funny enough, PE ratio, just as you pointed out, is actually one of the less informative overlays that you can input, which is interesting that you've also mentioned in that there. Well, sure, because, you know, earnings, by the time earnings come from the income statement, right? And by the time you get down from revenue all the way down to earnings, you've got so much shit in there as far as accounting manipulations and shenanigans that you don't know what earnings really are. There are all kinds of ways to speed up your revenue recognition, as far as contracts that might be signed or may not be signed. And all kinds of ways to basically you're giving out credit where you know you're not going to be paid on that, but you're recognizing that revenue. And anyway, there's all kinds of ways to make that earnings look so much better than it actually is. So, you know, if you want to use maybe a better one to be like price to cash flow, that kind of thing. But yeah, you know, I agree. I don't use technical analysis a whole lot or kind of momentum analysis, but a great way to do it is, yeah, using that as a buyer as a indicator, a buyer as a point for the stocks that you've done the fundamental analysis on. And, and you know, you want to buy the stock, but you want to know, okay, when is good, when is a good time, when is a good price? And that technical analysis can be a great a great way to say, okay, yeah, you know, now is a time to start buying. You're going to have the lagging returns tend to be good on that and the long term returns are good on your fundamental analysis. Yeah, yeah, it's, it's really interesting to see the cross section between analysis, because I always find it interesting when when both traders and investors, they'll kind of poop on one of the other, they'll say, oh, this is trash or this is trash. And I always, I always think it's like, why would I close one eye when I have two eyes? I like use them both. Now, going back though to your transition from specifically equity analysis into the VC build outside of things, what made you make that transition? And what were some of the larger differentiators in your day today between those two jobs? Okay. Well, I think, you know, I mean, first you look at the money people are making, right? So venture capital, you're you're getting in much earlier than equity guys, right? So, you know, you're getting in and back then you're early 2000s and that was in mid 2000s. I think there were there are more opportunities in venture capital and pre IPO investing than there are now. Right now, there, there's just so much money floating around that companies are staying private for so long that it could be, you know, five, 10, 15 years before you get an exit. Basically, for the lot of these private companies, you're investing in a company. The idea is that it's going to, you know, have maybe four or five funding rounds, investment rounds into it. And then they'll look for an exit, right? Either to sell the company to through an acquisition to a bigger company or they'll do an IPO. And generally, you can do, I mean, very, very good returns. There's a, there's a study by Willem at University that looks at angel investing portfolios on a rolling, you know, rolling four year period and and found annualized returns of about 24% on those. So, very good. And that's even with about half the portfolio just completely flopping, right? That's one of the, just a fact of life for free IPO, angel venture capital investments is that about half of them are just going to bust, you know, those, those companies are going to, going to just go away. But then you've got enough that are 30, 40, 50 times your money that bring it up to that 22, 24% annualized return. So, very strong returns. Any more though, you know, you've got so much money sloshing around just over the last five years from, from all the stimulus and all that. And going, you know, being available to these free IPO, these, these private companies that they're just staying, they're staying private forever. I mean, you've got companies like, you know, I think, well, you know, XAI, you've got, you know, all of Elon's companies, right? You've got, you know, there's a couple other ones. But the $60 billion market cap, $100 billion market cap, you know, or valuation, which is just unheard of. I mean, these companies, we used to say, a billion dollars was, you know, a unicorn and a good time to try to, try to go IPO. And you've got companies just staying private forever. So there's no exit for those, for those people. But anyway, I kind of digress there back back in the earth, two or early 2000s, mid 2000s. I mean, you were getting much more frequent, much more frequent exits for these companies. And so, you know, the investors and the people in on those deals were making a lot more money. So I was kind of watching that, you know, to decide that I wanted to make a lot more money, you know, wasn't necessarily a choice. Not necessarily wasn't necessarily a starving to death as an equity analyst. But, but, you know, you're, you're, you're kind of beating your brains out over that market return and maybe a little bit higher. So, so I started looking into that. I really liked the idea of getting in before, you know, everybody else did, right? You get in pre IPO, you get into those private companies. I liked the idea of, you know, a little bit more, a little bit more of a control, an ownership and guiding, guiding ownership into the company. A lot of VC firms will have people on as board, on the board, directors of their investments. So there's always an opportunity to join the board of one of these private companies and kind of help guide it, help steer it. And of course, that's, you know, that's always a paid, a paid thing also to be on a board of directors and, you know, you get more stock options and stuff like that as well. So I, I just liked, I liked a lot of the, the things in that. But it's, as far as the work involved though, it is, it is very similar to an equity analyst, right? Especially, especially when you, when you're first starting out as a venture capital analyst, it's, it's going to be very similar because basically you're just taking, taking that company and, you know, looking at its financial statements, trying to project something into the future. But also, you've also got a little bit more of a guiding and managerial role, right? Where you're trying to tell them, okay, you know, this is what's working in the industry. This is what's effed up about your company right now and what's holding it back. And this is, these are the changes you should make. So yeah, it's a little bit more detail, a little bit more in depth, a little bit more detailed and managerial focused than an equity analyst. And which did you like more? I'd say the, the venture capital, right? You know, again, it gives you a little bit more of an opportunity to be, you know, I won't say the manager because you're not actually managing the company, but you are, you've got your strategy hat on and you're actually helping them to, to run the company better, find new customers, find new suppliers, really make that company something that, that could be, you know, someday the next trillion, well, I won't say trillion dollar company, but the next, you know, the next billion dollar company, the next IPO, big IPO, and something that's, you know, going to pay off big because, again, those, the big exits are fewer and far between 30, 40, 50 times your money, but when they happen, you know, I mean, that's just, that's just like the sun shining out through the clouds, you know, 50 times your money on, on an investment. It really, you know, really shows you why you're in this business. Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. It also seems, at least for somebody like you probably a better use of a diverse skill set because you apply some of the technical expertise, but you also apply some of the managerial side of things. Did you, did you like the managerial side or was that kind of annoying and you prefer the more technical stuff or different than that? Sure. Now, I liked, obviously, when you're used to, and at this point in my career, I was still fairly new, you know, I had just been associated in, in equity analysis and, and I was still doing, you know, the, the ground, the groundwork in these, you know, the Excel spreadsheets, the deep, deep research. So it is, it is always nice to be able to break, break out part of your day to truly look at something a little bit bigger picture, right? Right. You know, sit on the board of a company and, and have those, that networking that you have with, with those newer companies, and as well as with investors and, and other people in that industry. So it's, it's, it's always nice to have, you know, to do something different other than staring at a computer screen all day. Sure. What were the board meetings like that you would sit on? Like, what would you do? What would they talk about? What were the ins and outs of that? Sure. Well, most of them are very procedural. I, you know, once, once something gets to a board meeting, it's, it's basically been talked about and rehashed and, and hashed and rehashed ad nauseam just between, you know, the board members and management and that kind of thing. And their advisors, you know, advisors from the VC firm and that kind of thing. So, so the board meetings tend to be actually pretty short and procedural, you know, because everything's, I won't say a rubber stamp, but it's, it's, again, it's already been talked about, hash, rehashed into, into, basically, you know how the vote's going to come out, or, you know, a specific project or, or an idea. So the board meetings are all pretty, pretty easy. Basically, it's everything you do before the board meeting where you're just talking to management, where you're talking to some of the other board members, where you're talking to the advisors, you know, just kind of looking at where the company is going, what can be improved, where its weak points are, you know, a lot of times trying to find, you know, trying to figure out if you can find a better supplier for something, trying to make those network connections, because, and that's what it's half of what successful venture capital firms are, is just really making the network connections between their, between their companies, between their, their invested companies together, see who, you know, who can be a customer of who, who can help out, you know, somebody else, and help, who might be a good merger eventually someday. So you're really kind of trying to, try to play that networking a lot with the, with the other board members with management, that kind of thing. Sure. And overall experience there, good, bad, indifferent. Good, really good, you know, it's, again, if it wasn't so much, you know, I was able to build up investments, private investments into companies myself through that, but again, you know, other than those investments, I really didn't own, you know, a lot of my own, my own work, right? My own work was for someone else, it was for, you know, in someone else's business. So if it hadn't been for that, maybe if I could have been like a partner in that business, then I would have stayed. But again, I wanted my own thing, I wanted my own, my own assets, obviously even, even in the, the mid to late 2000s, the internet still felt like something very new, as far as a business idea, and as far as creating a business, of course, you know, somebody born in 1976, it would feel, it would still feel new. I'm sure somebody born, you know, after 2000, it feels, well, the internet has always been there, right? Right. Yeah, yeah, very different. Switching gears a little bit now to the actual practice of fundamental analysis. When you think of fundamental analysis as a concept, what does it mean to you? Sure. Well, you know, trying to, trying just as I did as an equity analyst, you know, trying to find the present, the present value of those future cash flows, and excuse me. And, and, you know, where makes the most sense to place an investment over the long term, right? And the thing is, you know, there is so much, there is so much sentiment value in there when you're talking less than a year, right? If you're talking stocks less than a year, it's all investor sentiment, it's all the overall market, right? Wherever, where the overall market is going to go, where investor sentiment is going to go, that's what's drive stocks in or under under a year, right? Beyond that. So if you take a little bit longer approach, a little bit longer horizon, then it is, you know, okay, which stocks, which companies have that competitive advantage? Okay. And, you know, that's, it's one of those words that's thrown around so much, it really means nothing. But it's, it's a little bit easier to see, you can get clues to it from an operating margin, from a sales growth perspective, you know, again, it's a little hard on YouTube because you're expected to know all stocks in all industries. But again, it's, it's a little, it's easier to just to focus on one industry. So you know, okay, what's a good operating margin in that industry? You know, that profitability. What is a good sales growth? What are the companies getting as far as sales growth? And who's getting the higher sales growth? And why, you know, why are they able to get 20, 25% revenue growth each year when the average is more like 15, you know, does that point to a competitive advantage that they're doing that, you know, either with their product, their marketing, just a brand, something like that, that they're able to steal market share from the, from the rest of their competitors. Right. And then operating margin, of course, you know, is there some kind of a competitive advantage? They have in the management of that company of the expenses, you know, not just, not just, you know, holding off expenses, so not investing in the future. But are they actually, you know, investing, putting as much money or cash flow, you know, from the cash flow statement, are they investing in the future? But they still just, you know, beat everyone else out in that operating profitability. So that's really, you know, through that fundamental analysis, the analysis of the financial statements and always hit all goes back to there, you know, where, where do you find the companies that have that advantage and, you know, and that's always going to lead to better returns in those companies, you know, any company, obviously, it might seem, it's intuitive and it might seem simplistic, but any company growing sales faster than its competitors, any company that has some kind of a competitive advantage that's leading to higher profitability, it's going to be the better return. So if you were to think of three of your favorites on the mental analysis indicators, it sounds like sales growth would be one of them. What, what would the three be? Sure, sure, definitely sales growth, but that's got, it's got to be in relation to, you know, the other companies in its industry. Okay, so, so when you're, when you're comparing stocks to buy or when you're looking for stocks to buy, you always have to compare, you know, a stock against the same, against other companies in its same industry, not just the same sector, but in its same industry, right? So you can't compare Coca-Cola to Nvidia. Okay, because obviously Nvidia's sales growth is just going to, you know, blow the doors off Coca-Cola. Doesn't mean Coca-Cola isn't a good company, isn't a great company. It just means it's two entirely different industries. You've got to compare, you got to compare Coca-Cola to Pepsi and to, you know, Monster Beverage and that. I think the question there, though, is does the Coca-Cola CEO wear an alligator skin jacket in signed people's bras? Right? Like that, to me is more what I'm, I just, there is definitely, and you know, it's, it's funny, but there is definitely a, an icon kind of value to a company. Okay, the, the, the kind of value that, okay, yeah, Jensen Wang that Elon Musk adds to add to their companies. You know, it's, it's, it's, it's an intro, or it's a, it's a intangible value that, you know, whether you add it to the stock or not, it's kind of weird. It's, it's kind of crazy to think of it like that. I can't, I can't really think, well, I guess we did, you know, back in the day, you know, we did have CEOs that were a little bit larger than life. We had Jack Welch over at GE, you know, Bob Igeros, still at Disney, but in the old days, he was, you know, at Disney first. And, you know, these guys were, were larger than life. They were media, you know, they, they were, won't say superstars or even stars, but you know, people knew who they were. They were, they were, you know, they were role models, but they weren't, they weren't the rock stars. Yeah, you're right, that, that, that Musk and Jensen Wang and, and, I mean, even, I won't say Tim Cook is really in that league, you know, but yeah, you know, so, so yeah, there's, there, there, there is something to be said for that superstar status and, and what that means for the stock price. But, yeah, you know, you, you, you got to, kind of compare apples to apples, right? So you're always looking at companies within the same industry. Okay, what's, you know, you, you get your hooks, you get your old spreadsheet out there and line them all up, get the revenue growth, not just one year revenue growth, but how are these companies grown revenue over the last five years, you know, an annualized return or an annualized rate? What's the average there? What's the median? Who's got the highest ones? And, and really, why is that? You know, it's like, again, like I said, it's a great clue into who might have a competitive advantage? You know, why is one company able to get revenue sells so much higher than the others? So it's, it's definitely something that, that you want to look at, but only in comparison with the others. Operating margins, same thing. You know, operating margins, basically, it's just your operating income, it's all on the income statement, your operating income divided by sales. And it's really that core measure of profitability, right? Because it's, you know, you've got your revenue minus your cost to good sold, which is basically a lot of factory expenses, your supplier expenses, things like that. Then you've got your operating expenses, which are, you know, selling general administrative marketing, things like that, some other operating costs. And that gives you your operating income, right? So, you know, further down on the income statement, you're going to find your, your interest, your taxes, things like that, that things that really aren't a part of the business, running the business, right? So that's why I like to use operating income divided by revenue that gives you your operating margin. It's really a core profitability for that business. Okay. So that's, you know, and that's again, compared to others in the industry, how, how is one company able to do so much better on that profitability than the other's why? You know, is it just better managed? Do they have a little bit more power over their, over their suppliers? They're able to get lower costs, things like that. You know, so it's a really good clue into how this company is being managed, which might have competitive advantage. You've also got just, you know, cash flow, you know, free cash flow growth, operating cash flow growth, you know, for, it's a little bit different for really early stage companies where it might be negative cash flow, negative earnings, things like that. You have to really look at the balance sheet as well, you know, is one company is growing, but it's so far in debt or, or so far negative cash flow that they're not going to survive, you know, if they don't have a big stockpile of cash on hand. But it's really, you know, for most, for most mature companies, it's really just about that growth and how they're able to generate it, right? Now, you're talking about for revenue growth, for example, you talked about using like a five year annualized, when you're conducting this fundamental analysis as a broader process. First, what do you think about the relevant timeframes for your analysis? I imagine it has to be partially based on your expected holding duration. Is that accurate or how do you choose what timeframes are most relevant for including prior data points? Sure, sure. Well, of course, yeah, if you're, if you're planning on holding it for five or 10 or 20 years, you can look back, you know, five years. Of course, it's got to be, it's got to be to the point where you're really kind of looking at, you know, what happened in those last five years, what were the major, you know, economic themes, right? Was the government just throwing money at everything? So everybody, of course, everybody had 20, 30% revenue growth. So you kind of, you know, a hedge it against that. So you kind of have to put it, put everything into perspective. But I would say, I would say five years is good for maybe some of the older companies. You can go back, you know, seven, 10 years, just to see, just to compare. Okay, so, you know, Coca-Cola versus Pepsi over the last 10 years, then over the last five years has something changed. Is, is there revenue growth over the last 10 years in relation to each other? Has that changed from 10 years to five years? You know, and why? What's management doing? You know, so, so you really have to look at, and again, these looking at these, I don't want the sound to sound too simplistic because you're not just looking at, okay, hey, this company has the higher revenue growth. This must be the better investment. No, you're looking at that, you're trying to use that as a clue for, okay, what should I look at in this company? Okay, if I found that Coca-Cola has, you know, 15% revenue growth annualized over the last five years, all of its competitors are, you know, three to five percent, then I want to start looking at Coca-Cola, and I want to start, I want to actually find why, you know, why is it revenue growth? Is it buying that revenue growth? That's, you know, something you have to look out for for a lot of these companies, just acquiring other companies. Yeah, their revenue growth is going to look great because they're buying it, right? They're, they're probably putting on mountains of debt to buy these other companies. Their revenue growth, growth, it looks great, but it's going to come out and buy them in the ass when, you know, when all that debt comes due. So you really have to, you know, have to look into the company, say, okay, is it because of some kind of strategic genius the management has? Is it some kind of competitive advantage in the brand, in the product, in the marketing, and can that be, you know, obviously, is that a durable competitive advantage that's going to last out over this five or ten years? That's really where you got to take that simple, you know, that those kind of simple metrics that you can look for, you got to take it to those, you know, to that level to really find those. And the thing is, I mean, for that real long-term investing, the good thing is you probably only have to do that maybe once every couple of years, right? Because you're looking for something that is durable, you know, over the next five or ten years. So basically you're finding that you're investing in it. And then, you know, if the stock doesn't, if the company doesn't do as well, over the next two years, three years, then you might revisit it and see, okay, what did they do differently? Is it, is it just, you know, hiccup in time? Or do I need to re-evaluate all of these? But this isn't something you're doing every, every month or even every year. So it is a lot of work. But once you find those companies, then, you know, you can hold them, hold them forever, basically. How do you choose, Dr? Because we talked a lot about comparing within sectors. We talked about not being able to compare the fact that in video, they have a rockstar CEO that's signing people's bras. And I don't even know the Coca-Cola CEO right now. So that tells you a lot. So how do you pick which sectors make the most sense for you? Sure. Well, a lot of it comes down to your goals, right? Obviously, some sectors are going to grow. Grow faster. They'll have those faster revenue growth and, you know, should produce better returns. So, all right, so you've got your technology, your communication services, which used to be all the old telecom stocks, but are now mostly internet stocks and things like that. So a little bit faster growth. Consumer discretionary tends to be kind of a growth sector, right? And then you've got, so if you want that portfolio growth, you would pick maybe one or two of those sectors. If you want maybe a little bit more stable returns, safety sectors like utilities, like consumer staples, like healthcare, things within those, then you would pick those. And again, probably the thing people don't realize about real investing when they just watch YouTube and they watch people pick stocks from all different sectors and everywhere is again, it pays to be very specific in, you know, your expertise, right? So what I would say is, okay, hey, pick one sector or maybe a few industries and different sectors. So if you want to pick a couple of industries out of tech, a couple of industries out of, you know, communication services, pick a couple of those industries, really get to be an expert and follow the companies and those industries, analyze the companies and those industries. So you know, you know which companies are the best stocks in those industries, you know, and that might only be maybe five or or 10 stocks at most, right? That you really think are the best of the best in their specific industries. And then to get that diversified portfolio, that a little bit more safety in your overall portfolio, then you pick maybe a, maybe I'll tell maybe a whole index fund, the SPY or the VO that just covers all the stock market, or maybe you just buy the other sectors in their, you know, select sector spider funds, right? So that's going to give you the, you know, the market, the market return, that's going to give you the return in those sectors that you really don't follow, you really don't know anything about. That's going to give you a nice smooth return in those. And then those those five or 10 stocks that you really have studied, you really have researched within those industries, those will give you that extra return, that extra alpha, right? And again, so to you put to your question, how do you pick those sectors? Well, again, it's, it's what do you want to focus on? Do you want to focus on growth? So maybe those five or 10 stocks, they're in those growth sectors, the the technology, communication services, consumer discretionary, maybe you overweight those a little bit in your portfolio. So maybe you have 20, 30% of your money in those 10 stocks. And then the other, you know, 60, 70% in the overall market. So that would give it a little bit of growth bent, right? Or you'll conversely, if you want more of a dividend focus, then you would focus on those sectors or a safety focus on those sectors and you would overweight your portfolio. Right? So you're not just you're not just picking one sector, even even if you were to become an expert in the technology sector or in a few industries in there, you're not still not putting all of your money in tech stocks. That would just that would be kind of ridiculous, right? You know, I mean, after the bubble burst in 2000 in tech stocks, I mean, it took 14 years for the NASDAQ to get back to that to the level it was in 2000. So to have all your money in tech stocks, you know, you're just you're just begging for that kind of a, you know, that kind of a crash. So overweight, you know, overweight those sectors that have that kind of growth or that or not growth, that kind of focus on what you want to focus on. But then, yeah, invest broadly or broadly across the market and just, you know, ETFs and index funds, things like that. If you feel some type of way about people being overweight in the NASDAQ, I think we just need to resensitize you to like Wall Street bets where people are betting their entire life savings on zero DTE and Nvidia. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, it's I hate bull markets. I got to say, I hate bull markets sometimes because because everyone is an expert and everyone knows the best investment, right? You know, you say one bad thing. You say one, I won't even say not even a bad thing. But, you know, the bear case on, you know, on a hot stock on Nvidia on Palantir, you say how, how it's just crazy expensive. And people are like, well, I've made 300% on Palantir. So, you know, shit on you. I must, I'm the expert. I had one comment. Yeah, it's a couple of weeks ago. And I was saying, I'm in Palantir. This is when it was rather on $80 a share and it's back down to that we're on 6770, I think now. But you know, I was saying, hey, I mean, two to at this valuation, it wouldn't need this kind of growth for decades out in the future just to make it, you know, kind of a breaking even investment. And it's just, there's just ridiculous valuations. And you know, somebody came back with, you know, oh, 10 years equity analyst, CFA designation, all that. I've got, I've got none of that. And I already made 300% in Nvidia. So now who's the asshole? You know, and somehow this guy is right, right? Because, you know, he's made money in. And I'm sitting here saying, don't buy Palantir. So, yeah, you know, it's just kind of the, it's, it's how the market works. One of the things I always remind people of is, in my opinion, I just wrapped up my 18th year of training last year. And in my opinion, the dominant, the dominant display of mastery of the skill set is endurance. So I'm very happy that he's made 300 percent. Let's come back in a decade and see what it looks like. Like, and it's not wishing bad on anybody. I want them to make money. But a lot of people, I think, really confuse exactly to your point short-term sequence of returns, the path. And they confuse it as strategy. And yeah, it'll catch up. And I won't say I want to say I'm any better. I mean, help when I first started investing, not to back with my $1,200 I was making as a, as a corporate in the Marine Corps. You know, I, I, I was momentum investing. I was buying the hot stocks. I didn't know shit from shine all those far as stocks are analysis or anything. I was just buying, buying what everybody was talking about, right? You know, so, so I've made, I made, I have probably learned more from my mistakes than I ever did learning as, you know, as an equity analyst and venture capital analyst and all that. It's just, you know, when you've been investing for 25, 25 years now, then you, you, you make a lot of mistakes. And, you know, if you learn from them, then, then that's, that puts you ahead of the 70 percent of investors out there that either haven't made the mistakes yet or you made them, but just didn't learn anything and just keep on repeating those same mistakes over and over again. Beautiful segue into a couple of my last questions for you. It's always fun to poke fun when somebody else gets hurt, provided that they're not hurt too bad. So let's talk about the hurt. Let's talk about some of the mistakes. When you look back over your, your trading career, I, I'd like to, I'd like you to break out, I handful, whatever number you, you feel like, but I'd like you to break it out into two distinct buckets. I would consider there to be beginner mistakes, which is often just not knowing what you don't know and those are kind of easy things, right? Once you're educated on them, then you can typically avoid those. So I'd love to start with a couple of those and then just to prime your brain and I'll remind you if you need the, the question again for the second part is what would you consider some of the more advanced mistakes? And these are things that typically occur later along in your tenure. You have some experience and there's still something that shows up that pops you out and nowhere. Sure. Well, you know, the beginner mistakes are just what you see on a lot of YouTube right now. It's just that chart porn just by following, following a chart up and thinking it's always going to do that, you know, investing just because that, that happens or really even saying, somebody's saying it happens. There's a lot of YouTubers out there that basically, you know, do do no more analysis than just looking at a chart. And I'm not talking about, you know, technical analysis and actually knowing the trends and patterns to look for. I'm talking about just eyeballing a chart and loving that it's going up and saying, Hey, you know, let's, let's write it till, grind it till we fall off. So that's, you know, that's probably the biggest mistake I see new, new investment. And I, I made, you know, myself way, way back ago. So I think that's it. That's an easy one. I think that the PE ratio, you know, following, following the easiest measures that, and really not knowing what goes into them or why, why some of the pitfalls or traps in them. So you know, again, we talked about the earnings on an income statement and how manipulated it is and why that makes that PE ratio a little bit, a little bit, you know, not quite what, not quite as valid as you might think. Right. So, so maybe going a little bit further into, you know, the price to cash flow or, or some of the other, some of the other measures is a better bet there. So I think that's that kind of, that kind of a basic, basic analysis and basic investing. I think it's the biggest mistakes I see people make it. You know, there's a, I think it's, I want to say the Dunnings Kruger graph. Correct. Right. Dunnings Kruger effect, where, where, you learn a little bit and you're right at that peak, that peak stupidity, I think is where they call it, where you know, just enough to, to make yourself dangerous. Right. And I think that's where a lot of investors find themselves at. They, you know, they put in, you know, a couple hours a week to look at stocks and all of a sudden, they think, they, you know, they think they, they, they know exactly where things are going and, and what to do. And it's really only when you start to, usually when you start to make those mistakes, and only when you hit that first bear market of your, of your investing life, and you really start to see some of the stupid things you were doing, that, that you really do, do start to learn, okay, this is what I don't know. This is what I need to learn. And that kind of thing. So really, really, it's unfortunately, I think for a lot of people, it's just that those mistakes have to be made, you know, and it would be great to, to be able to say, hey, you know, don't just follow a chart up, don't just buy what's going up, that kind of thing. But it's, it's almost like, you know, it's almost like my eight-year-old. You can tell them, you tell them all you want. You, you have all the advice in the world that they're not going to listen to you. You, they just have to make those mistakes themselves, and, you know, tell their eight-year-old when they have it, about those, about those mistakes. I think that maybe a little bit more, a little bit higher level mistake is learning how to, you know, watch that debt, watch the debt that a company has. I know a lot of us who we love a great deal, you know, so you look at a stock that's just falling, falling off of a cliff, you think, hey, it must be a great stock, it must be a great deal. So you just buy the shares, right, without looking at, okay, well, one, market's pretty smart. Usually when a stock is going down so much, it's for a reason, you know, so, so what does other people, what do people see that maybe you aren't looking at, and what's the bear case for the stock? But more importantly, is, you know, watching that, watching that stock and watching the debt on the company's balance sheet, the cash flow, it goes, really, this is where the cash flow statement comes in handy, is, okay, when does that debt come do, you know, what's the cash flow trend in the operational cash flow, and, you know, how much cash on hand do they have to pay if it's a negative, negative cash flow, but also how much debt do they have, and what are those interest payments like? Because, you know, even a great looking company can get into a lot of trouble if they have too much debt. I mean, case in point, probably my biggest loss ever was P body energy, right, coal producer. This was probably in 2012, right, and all the coal producers were just falling off of a cliff, you know, the government was really cracking, coming down hard on, on coal producers, trying to, trying to move everybody into renewable energies and natural gas and things like that. So, so yeah, the coal producers were just dying, and, you know, so I saw that, and I thought, well, hey, yeah, you know, the future is in your renewable energies, the future is in the natural gas, but at the time, coal was still, I think, something like, you know, 37, 40, 42% of electricity generation, right, so it wasn't going away any time soon, right, so I thought, okay, you know, you look at this industry, coal industry, who is, you know, who is the strongest, who's the best house in the shitty neighborhood, right, and P body, you know, and that size, it was one of, probably the largest, largest publicly traded coal producer. So I thought, okay, here's a company that, yeah, it's beaten down just because the entire market is beaten down for, for coal producers, it's not anything management did, it's just, it's just a horrible environment. So once that environment improves, once the environment for coal improves, this stock should go to the moon. So I invested in that, and of course, you know, followed it all the way down. One of the biggest mistakes an investor can make is, you know, that dollar cost averaging that, that isn't a bad idea, but that dollar cost averaging, yeah, all the way down, catching that fall in knife, and of course, they eventually filed bankruptcy, because, you know, even though eventually, and hell, you know, coal has been a great investment over the last few years, over the last five or six years, I think, but, but it didn't turn around enough, quick enough for the company to get out from that massive amounts of debt that it had on the balance sheet. So they just owed too much debt, and it ended up in bankruptcy. So it lost quite a bit of money from that, actually. And, and yeah, you know, if you're going to be, you're going to be chasing those, those value companies that have just sold off, you know, 30, 40, 50 percent, one, you got to, you know, you got to figure out that bear case, and you got to, you're going to follow me. You can't close your ears just because somebody is saying something negative about a stock that you think you might like. And then you got to look at that balance sheet, you got to look at the cash flows and that debt. I love that too, because it also highlights a really common thing in terms of the temporal relationship of your assumption with when it actually ends up playing out, because it's your broader point. The thesis ended up being correct, but just the timing, yeah, the timing hurt you. Oh, yeah. Timon is, you know, you look at, well, okay, another one of my best examples that I like is everybody loves the movie Big Short, right? And, and of course, Michael Berry always, always loves to point out that he predicted the housing crash. Well, he's really trying to predict it in 2000. If you follow that, watch the movie and you actually follow what actually happened, he was trying to predict it in like 2002, 2003. Okay. So he was about four years early. If you actually watch the movie, he only kept his firm, his, you know, his capital, capital management, his firm out of bankruptcy, because he just stopped returning investor money. You know, people were asking for their money back and he said, nope, I'm, I'm suspending all, all withdrawals right now. So that is the only way that he kept his firm out of bankruptcy. But he ended up being right, you know, so, so fully for him, he, he became a big star. And, you know, but, but, but, yeah, being, one of the biggest lessons I've learned is being early is just can be just as bad as being wrong. Yeah. And sometimes, sometimes it's even worse because if you're early and you still have conviction, you start throwing more money at it because it's losing and you're like, I still feel this is going to happen. Yeah. No, I literally couldn't agree more with you there. And it's, it's funny because I always think how razor thin the margin is between like genius and idiot. And that example is that razor thin margin. He's a genius because it worked. But just I always think of it in terms of probabilities. That's a lot of my background as in stats. That's like how many other versions of this happened with other people, different funds that failed on the same idea, but just couldn't make it across that finish line. He was, he was so overextended in this one bet that it almost destroyed his firm. So, so, there's a point where you got to go back to, you know, Warren Buffett's old or what's attributed to him, his old saying is just, you know, rule number one, don't lose money. Right. So you may feel, you may feel you've got the, the inside scoop on the company, or a company or the economy or the market where it's going. But if it means, you know, placing bets, you know, placing outsized bets on one direction and hoping that turns out, you know, those, those binary bets like options where, you know, you could lose everything if you're wrong. Then, you got to think, okay, you know, what if I'm, what if I'm early, what if I'm really early on this? What, what does the future look like for that? And then kind of try to try to hedge some of that and really, you know, I mean, it's, it's not wrong to place, you know, directional bets and put conviction, or put money behind your conviction. But, but again, you know, what happens if you're early? And what does that look like? Well, it also goes back to the point we're talking about before is, you know, placing bets with conviction is one thing, but survival is another. And again, to me, the ultimate mark of a seasoned investor trader is tenure, it's duration. So yeah, you might be worried about getting that thousand bagger that you're super convicted in, but if you mortgage the house on it and you're wrong, even if you win, if you apply that methodology going forward, you're gonna, you're gonna unwind it at some point. I always find that part really funny. How there's a lot of really, really, really smart people that have done really great in the markets. There's a couple of super famous ones that have done really great in the markets. But then because of like mistiming and things like that, they end up losing all their money. Yeah, it'll get you sooner or later. It's like the casino as long as you keep coming back, you have to have good bankrollment. And eventually, yeah, what was, you know, the, and this one, I can't remember the, the, the, the firm, but was what's the hedge fund that was in the recent game stop movie, right? That kind of the throne. Huh? Is it true? Yeah, I think that was the one that folded, the one that was played by Oh, Melvin. Yeah, Melvin. There you go. Melvin Capital. Yeah, yeah. He's a smart guy. He had, he had, you know, a history, a history behind him. And then yeah, he just, he just went so far into that one trade, you know, overexposed in that one thing. And that was it, you know, there was $12 billion loss, you know, just losses adding up to where it broke him. So, yeah, you know, the, you can make, you can make all the money you want. But if you continue to turn investing into gambling, rather than investing, then, then it's gonna, you know, like you said, the house is going to win eventually. GGs for them. Well, absolutely awesome to connect with you. I actually, I'm going to follow up with you after this to see if we can book a follow-up, because I think it would be really, really cool. Now that we have a baseline of kind of like, who you are, your background, what you're about. I'd love to do a follow-on where we kind of talk about 2024 and then 2025. So I find these, these two years to be really, really interesting from just a, a broader, like market and economic perspective. But thank you so much for coming to hang out. Before we wrap up, though, where can people find you? Sure. Well, let's talk money. They're right here on YouTube. I'd love to see people come over, you know, join the community, become part of the community. And, you know, let me know what kind of videos you want to see. Beautiful. We'll also throw a link to that in the notes below. But thanks for hanging out, man. Absolute blast. Thank you.
