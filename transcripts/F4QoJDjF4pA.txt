0.00s: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the Outlier podcast. I have my friend, Joe here. And
8.24s: you and I connected what, like two years ago or something like that now?
11.68s: Been a while, man. Yeah. Yeah. I like originally reached out to you when I first started YouTube,
17.04s: just to try to like figure out how to not completely dork everything up as I've done anyways,
22.96s: you know, against your best advice. So I guess I am a poor two to a two to a lich in that sense. But
29.68s: I am absolutely stoked to connect with you a little bit. And you bring a different perspective
35.36s: than what a lot of my standard audiences used to seeing. So as we were talking about right before
39.44s: we started recording, a lot of like active trading derivatives style stuff. And you spread a pretty
46.00s: wide gamut of things. And I know a lot of what I see on your channel is kind of like the dividend
51.36s: investing side of things that seems to be something your audience likes a lot. So I'd love to start with
59.60s: generalized backgrounds. Obviously you spent some time in the Marine crops, which is how we came
66.40s: into contact together. And then so I'd love to learn a little bit more about your military
70.64s: experience and then making the transition from there. Sure. Sure. Well, yeah. Spent a time in the
76.08s: Marine Corps as an at armor, got out in 2001, you know, just before just before it really hit the fan,
82.64s: obviously. And you know, always knew I liked making my money work for me, right? You know,
89.68s: corporal in the Marine Corps doesn't get doesn't make a whole lot of money. So you got to have
94.24s: that money working for you. So I got really heavy into investing. Of course, 2001, 2002, this was
100.48s: just as the real estate bubble was starting to inflate. So everybody was getting making money in
105.92s: real estate. And and I wanted a piece of that action. So I got started, you know, went back to
110.64s: school, went back to college and got my degrees there, finance and communication studies and
116.96s: you know, started on the real estate side was a real estate analyst. Of course, that all blew up
121.84s: in 2000 and, you know, 2007, 2008. And of course, it's it's weird because, you know, my professional
128.96s: career, the career, the career path that I thought I was going to take into real estate as an analyst
134.40s: and investor and that blew up just as the, you know, when I just first started investing in 1999,
142.24s: you know, blew up as well. So so I seem to have a knack for finding things, making an inflection
147.92s: point in my life. And then it just blowing up completely. So we're still waiting for the third act
153.04s: on that one. But anyway, so I, you know, I've spent some time in real estate, you know, when that
157.52s: all blew up, I kind of transitioned into equity analysis, stock analysis. I worked in venture
163.44s: capital firm for in a Canadian venture capital firm set up their cell side division and worked
169.44s: that. So I was a professional analyst for about 10 years. And then finally decided, you know,
174.24s: with these 80 hundred hour work weeks were for the goals. So, you know, I started kind of free
181.12s: lancing while I was building up my digital assets, my online business with blogs and then
185.68s: filing with YouTube, really trying to build my own assets and something that I actually own,
190.96s: right? Because, you know, anyone that's, you know, anyone in finance, they could tell you,
195.28s: they worked their balls off, but they own nothing, right? So they have to constantly be
200.32s: grinding that wheel. So I built up my online assets and here we are. You know, I love talking
205.60s: about stocks still, love watching my money grow and having it work for me. And I love being able
211.04s: to bring that that professional equity analyst background to YouTube where, you know, you know,
216.00s: you don't often get something like that. Probably a little bit longer term investing style,
222.72s: then, then what a lot of a lot of people are, I like to, I do like to swing trade. So, you know,
228.56s: three, three months, one year kind of kind of trades. But then beyond that, kind of try to take it
234.40s: easy and just let the money work, work its way out. You know, so I use, I use options for swing
240.80s: trading, but also for hedging longer term, you know, and then futures, it's probably usually,
246.96s: usually futures only in the forex sense. So, you know, times like now where the dollar is
252.72s: completely ridiculously overvalued and has been for the better part of a year, then I'll put on a
258.48s: futures trade, you know, short the dollar into some other stuff. But then, but mostly it's just
263.68s: stocks, you know, stocks for the long term growth stocks. I do, everybody likes to make that cash
268.88s: money on the dividends, but it's kind of hard to get rich with dividends. So, so I kind of stick to
274.24s: the the growth stocks, tech stocks, things that are going to multiply your money, get that portfolio
278.56s: to the point where you need it. So, you can be living off your dividends one day.
283.60s: A bunch of questions. Yeah, the so the very first one, not market related yet,
290.24s: did you think at any point that you were going to like be a YouTuber? Did that ever cross your
298.48s: mind? Sure. Well, I mean, we didn't even, there wasn't a YouTube until 2006. So, right, you know,
304.00s: so I was, I was already, you know, 30 years, 30 years old before YouTube was a thing, right? And
310.24s: then, and even then it was for gamers and I don't know, weirdos, you know, 14 year olds that would
316.96s: 14 year olds that would soon become, you know, the biggest YouTuber in the world, right? I think
321.28s: Mr. Beast had his in 2006, 2008, something like that. But yeah, no, I didn't. I started blogging in 2013,
329.60s: right? When I, you know, finished on my equity analyst career, really trying to start building
334.16s: those online assets. And I started the YouTube channel in 2015, but only as a way to put videos,
340.96s: you know, host videos on YouTube so I could put them on my website so people who could watch them on
345.60s: the website and, you know, spend a little bit more time there. Didn't really think much of it.
349.12s: Until, you know, I saw a huge, huge spike in, in hits one day to my, to the website and what
354.88s: had happened is, you know, a friend of mine had that with the YouTube channel had talked about one of
359.04s: my, one of my posts and sent massive amounts of traffic. So I was like, well, shit, and this was
363.68s: 2007 team, by the way, two years after I had actually started the YouTube channel. I hadn't really
368.96s: done anything. I think I had 10 videos on it in two years. And I thought, okay, well, you know,
374.00s: YouTube is a thing, I guess. So, so I started in 2017, December 2017, really putting videos on
380.40s: there for YouTube's sake to build that part of the business. And it's pretty much all YouTube now.
385.52s: You know, I love the face to face you get with people on YouTube. You just don't get that in
389.44s: blogging or even in podcasting if you're not real recording the video and posting it somewhere.
394.88s: So I love that sense of community you get with, with YouTube, really being face to face with people.
399.60s: Yeah, it's fascinating. The reason why I asked that question too is because I find my four
404.00s: what four ray into YouTube very similar. And I'm always wondering how other people
408.72s: came into a quick story that I think is kind of funny. We had a bee infestation outside my window
414.80s: here. So called a beekeeper came out helped us with the bees as he's leaving. He like looked at me
419.84s: and he's just like, he like a YouTuber or something. And at that point, I'd never touched any social
426.32s: media. I didn't even have an Instagram. So I thought it was the funniest thing on earth. I was like,
430.32s: no, like who's on like, why do you think I would be on YouTube? Right? Like just so crazy to me.
436.40s: No shit. By the next year, I had started a YouTube channel and had been off to the races. So this
442.40s: freaking, but you were, but you were, you were podcasting right at that point. So you had the
446.80s: setup. No, you just, he just asked if you were you that's kind of crazy out of blue. Yeah,
452.64s: the main thing is like we're fortunate. So we live in a nice house in a nice area. And I looked
457.68s: a little younger than I do now. So I think he saw younger dude in a nice place and he was
462.80s: curious like how that happened, right? That's pretty common out in California at least, but
468.40s: it's just so funny to me that like I thought that was the most ridiculous thing on planet earth.
472.64s: And so I should have told him, no, I just married a sugar mama. I told him I told him I was
477.52s: a prostitute. That's my go to. Yeah. Never anybody asked me what I do. I promise. Because if you
481.92s: think about it, which, which is crazy because because that's the more legitimate answer than,
488.40s: yeah, I'm a YouTuber. People still think, can you make money on that? Does that the thing?
493.12s: They're like, oh, yeah, that makes sense. You sell your body. I get it. Yeah. I mean my argument
497.68s: there is I feel like in a nutshell, we all are prostitutes because we're exchanging
505.04s: I'm an effort for money, just different kinds of effort. But okay. Yeah, I think I guess you could
511.60s: make that case for many, many other careers, but you know that they're there somehow prostituting
517.44s: there. That's exactly. Anyway, that's exactly it. But I just find that so funny because a lot of the
524.00s: people that I find that are doing really cool things on YouTube like you seem to just come across
529.36s: it randomly, right? Like you started YouTube channel. It's two years, 10 videos weren't doing
533.84s: anything and then all of a sudden, you know, your friend dropped you and it started taking off
538.40s: you're like, okay, I guess I'll do this too. Like that's so cool. Yeah. It's totally random.
544.00s: And the, you know, I will say I was fortunate enough to start in 2007 start relatively early,
549.52s: you know, even even 11 years after YouTube started. It was still relatively early and I had that
554.00s: benefit. And it's it is more competitive now, but it is still really early. It feels, it feels like,
560.64s: you know, there's even even at something like 26 million channels on YouTube. It is still an
566.80s: early time to start a YouTube channel. So for anyone out there that, you know, just wants to be
571.04s: heard, wants to make some money and wants to have, you know, wants to build something then YouTube
575.52s: is still the place to be. Yeah, I couldn't agree more with that. I mean, it's what the second largest
581.20s: search engine right now and the cool part about YouTube is even though there definitely
586.96s: is saturation, what I've come to appreciate is that there are areas for you to carve out for like
594.32s: your personality, your brand and what you do because somebody like you, even though YouTube started
601.92s: in oh six or whatever and at that point it was brand new, you would already been doing the finance
606.56s: thing for some time before that even started, right? So like you're coming to a place with a
610.88s: significant amount of experience that even though a brand new YouTuber might have really good
615.84s: marketing, now they don't have the experience you do. So that that part always provides a pretty
622.16s: strong differentiation, which leads me to my follow on. So I would love to know more about
629.12s: your experience, what you did and the overall perception you had of working at the VC firm
638.16s: and equity analysis. So you can start from the very beginning, specifically why that place
644.96s: and then you just kind of go from there. Sure, sure. Well, equity analysis, I mean anytime you
649.20s: start, anybody is starting equity analysis as an equity analyst, you always start as an associate,
655.04s: which is basically a peon, not only are you going to, you know, the go for going to get everything
660.24s: for everyone, but you're also really just doing cash flow modeling, right? You're sitting in front
665.28s: of a computer screen, nine, 10 hours a day, at least minimum, basically on an Excel spreadsheet
672.48s: and modeling out a company's cash flows, right? You know, everybody likes to follow income, net income,
678.88s: that's, you know, PE ratios, all that kind of crap that's on CNBC, it's easy, but that's not really
684.72s: where where investment analysis comes from. Investment analysis, you know, the way they do it is really
691.04s: modeling those cash flows, you know, how much cat free cash flow is the company have, how much is
696.64s: it going to be able to spin out to two investors, you know, theoretically if it wasn't saving it,
701.68s: saving it back for growth. And what's the value of that? You know, all those future cash flows,
706.40s: what's the value of that in the present and how does that on a per share basis? So you're basically
712.16s: just kind of, you know, a grunt, you know, to put it in a term we both know, you're basically just
718.32s: a grunt for on Excel for, yeah, 10 hours a day forever, forever, forever it seems. A year and a half,
725.84s: two years, then you get, sorry, sorry to interrupt, I just want to follow up on that first part first.
732.32s: So nine to 10 hours a day, working on cash flow analysis, can you walk me through like
738.72s: functionally what you're actually doing nine to 10 hours during the day? Like are you going to
743.92s: websites? Are you trying to like what are you functionally doing during that time frame?
747.76s: Sure. Well, a lot of it goes to the financial statements, right? You know, and a great,
753.60s: if anybody wants to learn real, real investment analysis, you know, the way the way they do it,
759.68s: to be able to to recommend stocks and all that, pick up at your local library and all copies of
765.12s: the CFA curriculum, right? The charter, charter financial analyst, you'll go in there and they've
770.00s: got, you know, everything from, I mean, it's a stack of books like like that, right? For each year,
776.24s: there's three levels of it, but you can do first level, second level, get those books and they'll
780.96s: walk you through everything from economic analysis, macro level analysis, all that. But the real,
785.84s: the real bed and bread and butter there is financial statement analysis, right? It's you go into
790.16s: that the income statement, the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. And really, again,
795.04s: you're looking at what the company has reported in the past, you know, the past five years or so.
800.32s: And then you're trying to model out into the future, what the future looks like. And of course,
804.88s: so one you've got management expectations, what they're saying on analyst calls, quarterly reports,
811.04s: what they're saying in their corporate, corporate presentations, what they're not saying is a lot of
815.44s: times very telling, right? So what happens is analysts, you know, most people don't realize it,
822.56s: but analysts usually only cover maybe a few industries or a one or two sectors, right? Because you
828.32s: have to get very good at those two, those industries or those sectors, right? So you might be a consumer
834.24s: staples analyst where you might be a hardware tech hardware analyst or something like that. And you
839.76s: get to know everything you can about the tech hardware industry, right? So you not only follow that
846.64s: company, but you follow all the companies in the industry. So five, six, 10 companies in that
851.36s: industry, you learn, okay, what do they typically talk about on their analyst calls? What are the
857.76s: metrics that really go with that industry? You know, what kind of growth is average? What kind of
862.80s: growth is medium? What their inventories look like? What their inventory spending looks like? And
868.56s: with that, you know, you get a feel for it. Like I said, what they are talking about and what they're
872.48s: not talking about, you know, if they're, if all the other competitors in the industry are talking
879.04s: about, you know, day sales outstanding or some of the other inventory measures. And there,
884.64s: it's conspicuously absent in, you know, whenever management talks about it to this other company,
889.52s: then you kind of wonder, okay, you know, why aren't they talking about it? And you research a little
893.44s: bit further. So you're looking at financial statements all day, you're digging through the notes
898.08s: to the financial statements to see how they're accounting for things on those financial statements,
902.16s: because, you know, even though there's, well, called GAP, generally accepted accounting principles,
907.20s: kind of guidances for how companies need to, you need to account for different things like revenue
913.44s: and expenses. There's a lot of leeway in there that companies have found, you know, ways around to
918.72s: make their own, you know, accounts look better or, or, or, or something. So you're digging through
925.12s: those. And then again, you're, you know, you're trying to model out what they've done in the past,
930.64s: what, you know, maybe, maybe your macro people, because usually a lot of times you're, your analysts,
935.92s: they're just doing those cash flow models and the financial statement analysis.
939.68s: Then the firm has, you know, maybe macro level people, so economic people that are saying, okay,
944.08s: the general economy is going to grow this much over the next three to five years. And you've got
948.96s: kind of models that say, okay, you know, if the general economy grows, if GDP grows two to three
954.48s: percent, then we can probably say maybe seven to 10 percent or 15 percent growth in this industry,
962.40s: right? And you've got other industry analysts telling you that as well. So you're applying some of
967.12s: those numbers that you have as well as what management at all 10 of these companies in the industry
972.24s: are saying, and you're trying to model out. Okay, what do I think sales are going to be for each
976.32s: of these 10 companies in the industry? Who's got the better expense management? What are their
981.04s: expenses are going to be? Who is, you know, has capital expenditures that are just running away?
986.40s: And maybe that's going to deflate their earnings a little bit. So you're really trying to get a
990.48s: feel for, you know, what earnings, what net income is going to be over the next over the next five
995.92s: years. You're modeling out their cash flows again, very important that you adjust the income statement
1002.00s: to their cash flows, which is, you know, because, okay, the income statement is all those accounting
1007.20s: shenanigans that everybody everybody uses. And nobody really says anything until something goes
1012.64s: wrong, right? Until you got a super micro computer and somebody calls them out on it and the stock
1017.52s: falls apart, you know, everybody does those kinds of accounting shenanigans, those manipulations
1022.48s: to make their revenue look higher, their expenses look lower and make their net income look better.
1026.64s: But nobody ever really says anything because that's a game everybody plays and everybody knows it.
1032.40s: So you kind of try and do a kind of trying to think through, okay, the income statement has all these
1037.20s: accounting shenanigans, these manipulations on it. The cash flow statement is actual cash generated
1042.56s: by operations cash spent in investments and that free cash flow that is basically theoretically
1048.88s: what kind of cash the company has left over after paying their capital expenditures from their operating
1054.32s: cash flow. So you're really trying to tie those two statements together and see what that
1059.04s: cash flow looks like and really, you know, which companies are the better at it in this industry,
1065.92s: in your industry, right? So again, you know, it's a lot of work you're looking through
1071.28s: industry reports, you're following if there's any industry magazines or, you know, industry
1076.40s: research, you're following that. So it's not really, I mean, you're not just sitting at your desk
1081.20s: watching an Excel screen all day long, you're building up all this information, this research that
1086.16s: goes into, okay, you know, what's a good rate of growth for sales for a company that has this
1092.40s: kind of market share, who has the market share in the industry and how is that changing among companies?
1098.72s: So it's, I mean, that's why equity analysts get paid a lot of money, right? So, but it's also
1104.96s: it's also a lot of work, you know, it's written in the Wall Street Journal probably last week and
1111.12s: it kind of brought a lot of realities or a lot of memories back to me because it was all about,
1116.24s: you know, the the hours of work in investment banking and equity analysis and how a lot of these
1122.24s: these junior bankers and junior analysts are being overworked. Of course, we never said we were
1128.00s: overworked when we were, you know, back in the back in the early 2000s and that that time,
1133.68s: but and how they're coping with it with, you know, 80 HD medications and Red Bull,
1140.24s: Red Bull laced with Riddlein and all that kind of good stuff. So it's just kind of a fact of life
1146.96s: for, you know, for bankers and for equity analysts. So, you know, I did that for a few years,
1154.24s: figured out that, you know, I wanted a little bit of change. I wanted to, in something a little bit,
1160.16s: you know, prior to equity analyst analysis. So I started looking at venture capital,
1165.44s: worked in venture capital firm for a couple of years and then was hired by a Canadian venture
1169.76s: capital firm called High Alert Partners to put together their cell side division. So I managed
1174.56s: a team of about six other analysts and we kind of analyzed stocks and analyzed, you know, other
1180.56s: pre IPO private companies for the for the owner and kind of drove drove business that way.
1188.16s: Fascinating. And so first off, thank you for the detail on just what the day to day looks like.
1195.36s: I think that's one of the things that a lot of people that don't work in the industry never get
1198.96s: a sense of unless they have an opportunity to talk to somebody like you. So yeah, you know,
1204.48s: watch CNBC or YouTube. I mean, I think more people get their stock picks and information from
1210.16s: YouTube now than CNBC. But you watch and you watch these guys, myself included. I never go into
1215.12s: that much detail. I mean, I do a lot of the work behind the scenes, but I don't go into that much
1218.96s: detail as far as, okay, this is why I'm picking this stock. I've modeled out these five years of cash
1223.44s: flow for this company. I think it looks great. I think it's worth much more than people are paying
1227.36s: for the shares right now. So you can't get a sense that it is just that easy. You just, you know,
1232.56s: hey, look at the biggest thing I hate on YouTube right now is just the chart porn, right? People
1238.32s: look at, oh man, look at it in video. Look at that chart right there. That looks beautiful.
1243.20s: Yeah. By that, it must be, it must be going that way in the future. But that's what a lot of
1248.56s: YouTube is now. It's just that chart porn also that people, you know, you know, finger,
1254.00s: finger, FN year, the chart and thinking it's going to keep on going just like that.
1260.88s: So, so yeah, you people don't get a sense that of what investing really is and how, you know,
1266.96s: how professional it can actually be if you actually are actually doing the work behind it.
1272.64s: Yeah, but it's much easier just to be degenerate and just say stonks go up and then just go
1277.84s: load. Yeah. And I don't know. I mean, I guess I've benefited from the ease of having a YouTube
1284.24s: channel just as much as anyone, right? You know, you don't need, you don't need experience.
1289.04s: You all you need is a camera and camera and an opinion. And that's great to, you know,
1294.24s: bring more people, give people the opportunity to have a business of their own. But yeah, it's
1300.00s: not the greatest, not the best way to invest if that's all you're doing is following a chart up or
1306.80s: or, you know, just following easy stuff like the P ratio and saying, oh, well, this is a cheap stock.
1312.08s: It must be a good deal. Which is interesting. Are you familiar with Wesley Grey's work in momentum?
1319.52s: No. So he's a, he's a marine dude, solid, solid guy. And he runs Alpha Architect, which is a big
1327.92s: ETF fund. But anyways, he is a momentum junkie. That's what he spent a lot of time on his PhD working on.
1336.24s: And he's come up with a lot of different factors with respect to momentum, frog, and the pan concept.
1343.76s: The Cliff notes version to this whole thing is one of the dominant factors with respect to momentum
1350.16s: is obviously an X period lagging return. So six months, 12 months, both tend to be pretty efficacious.
1358.72s: And they tend to resist the short term turnaround effect of other things that three months has a
1364.48s: strong turnaround effect. But what they found is when you overlay that with some of these fundamental
1370.24s: indicators, like you're talking about like PE ratio or peg ratio or free cash flow that it can
1376.40s: massively improve the performance of the system, which is interesting. But funny enough, PE ratio,
1381.36s: just as you pointed out, is actually one of the less informative overlays that you can input,
1386.72s: which is interesting that you've also mentioned in that there. Well, sure, because, you know, earnings,
1390.32s: by the time earnings come from the income statement, right? And by the time you get down from revenue
1395.52s: all the way down to earnings, you've got so much shit in there as far as accounting manipulations
1399.92s: and shenanigans that you don't know what earnings really are. There are all kinds of ways to
1405.52s: speed up your revenue recognition, as far as contracts that might be signed or may not be signed.
1411.76s: And all kinds of ways to basically you're giving out credit where you know you're not going to be paid
1418.88s: on that, but you're recognizing that revenue. And anyway, there's all kinds of ways to make that
1423.36s: earnings look so much better than it actually is. So, you know, if you want to use maybe a better one
1428.96s: to be like price to cash flow, that kind of thing. But yeah, you know, I agree. I don't use
1433.20s: technical analysis a whole lot or kind of momentum analysis, but a great way to do it is, yeah,
1439.52s: using that as a buyer as a indicator, a buyer as a point for the stocks that you've done the
1444.24s: fundamental analysis on. And, and you know, you want to buy the stock, but you want to know, okay,
1448.64s: when is good, when is a good time, when is a good price? And that technical analysis can be a great
1453.92s: a great way to say, okay, yeah, you know, now is a time to start buying. You're going to have
1460.72s: the lagging returns tend to be good on that and the long term returns are good on your fundamental
1466.56s: analysis. Yeah, yeah, it's, it's really interesting to see the cross section between analysis,
1472.24s: because I always find it interesting when when both traders and investors, they'll kind of poop
1477.20s: on one of the other, they'll say, oh, this is trash or this is trash. And I always, I always think
1481.20s: it's like, why would I close one eye when I have two eyes? I like use them both. Now, going back
1489.28s: though to your transition from specifically equity analysis into the VC build outside of things,
1499.12s: what made you make that transition? And what were some of the larger differentiators in your day
1505.68s: today between those two jobs? Okay. Well, I think, you know, I mean, first you look at the money
1511.84s: people are making, right? So venture capital, you're you're getting in much earlier than equity guys,
1518.48s: right? So, you know, you're getting in and back then you're early 2000s and that was in mid 2000s.
1526.24s: I think there were there are more opportunities in venture capital and pre IPO investing than there
1530.72s: are now. Right now, there, there's just so much money floating around that companies are staying
1536.48s: private for so long that it could be, you know, five, 10, 15 years before you get an exit. Basically,
1542.24s: for the lot of these private companies, you're investing in a company. The idea is that it's going to,
1547.92s: you know, have maybe four or five funding rounds, investment rounds into it. And then they'll
1552.48s: look for an exit, right? Either to sell the company to through an acquisition to a bigger company
1557.76s: or they'll do an IPO. And generally, you can do, I mean, very, very good returns. There's a,
1564.48s: there's a study by Willem at University that looks at angel investing portfolios on a rolling,
1570.64s: you know, rolling four year period and and found annualized returns of about 24% on those. So,
1579.76s: very good. And that's even with about half the portfolio just completely flopping, right? That's
1584.72s: one of the, just a fact of life for free IPO, angel venture capital investments is that about half
1590.72s: of them are just going to bust, you know, those, those companies are going to, going to just go away.
1595.44s: But then you've got enough that are 30, 40, 50 times your money that bring it up to that 22,
1600.64s: 24% annualized return. So, very strong returns. Any more though, you know, you've got so much money
1608.00s: sloshing around just over the last five years from, from all the stimulus and all that. And going,
1613.68s: you know, being available to these free IPO, these, these private companies that they're just staying,
1618.96s: they're staying private forever. I mean, you've got companies like, you know, I think, well,
1624.08s: you know, XAI, you've got, you know, all of Elon's companies, right? You've got, you know,
1630.32s: there's a couple other ones. But the $60 billion market cap, $100 billion market cap,
1636.80s: you know, or valuation, which is just unheard of. I mean, these companies, we used to say,
1641.92s: a billion dollars was, you know, a unicorn and a good time to try to, try to go IPO.
1646.88s: And you've got companies just staying private forever. So there's no exit for those, for those people.
1651.44s: But anyway, I kind of digress there back back in the earth, two or early 2000s,
1656.08s: mid 2000s. I mean, you were getting much more frequent, much more frequent exits for these companies.
1662.48s: And so, you know, the investors and the people in on those deals were making a lot more money.
1667.28s: So I was kind of watching that, you know, to decide that I wanted to make a lot more money,
1671.84s: you know, wasn't necessarily a choice.
1673.68s: Not necessarily wasn't necessarily a starving to death as an equity analyst. But, but, you know,
1679.20s: you're, you're, you're kind of beating your brains out over that market return and maybe a little
1684.56s: bit higher. So, so I started looking into that. I really liked the idea of getting in before,
1691.68s: you know, everybody else did, right? You get in pre IPO, you get into those private companies.
1696.40s: I liked the idea of, you know, a little bit more, a little bit more of a control,
1702.88s: an ownership and guiding, guiding ownership into the company. A lot of VC firms will have
1708.72s: people on as board, on the board, directors of their investments. So there's always an
1713.60s: opportunity to join the board of one of these private companies and kind of help guide it,
1717.92s: help steer it. And of course, that's, you know, that's always a paid, a paid thing also to be
1722.64s: on a board of directors and, you know, you get more stock options and stuff like that as well.
1727.12s: So I, I just liked, I liked a lot of the, the things in that. But it's, as far as the work
1732.64s: involved though, it is, it is very similar to an equity analyst, right? Especially, especially when
1738.24s: you, when you're first starting out as a venture capital analyst, it's, it's going to be very
1743.20s: similar because basically you're just taking, taking that company and, you know, looking at its
1747.52s: financial statements, trying to project something into the future. But also, you've also got a little
1753.20s: bit more of a guiding and managerial role, right? Where you're trying to tell them, okay, you know,
1758.40s: this is what's working in the industry. This is what's effed up about your company right now and
1763.68s: what's holding it back. And this is, these are the changes you should make. So yeah, it's a little
1767.76s: bit more detail, a little bit more in depth, a little bit more detailed and managerial focused
1772.00s: than an equity analyst. And which did you like more? I'd say the, the venture capital, right?
1779.44s: You know, again, it gives you a little bit more of an opportunity to be, you know, I won't say
1784.64s: the manager because you're not actually managing the company, but you are, you've got your strategy
1788.72s: hat on and you're actually helping them to, to run the company better, find new customers,
1794.32s: find new suppliers, really make that company something that, that could be, you know, someday the
1799.20s: next trillion, well, I won't say trillion dollar company, but the next, you know, the next billion
1803.44s: dollar company, the next IPO, big IPO, and something that's, you know, going to pay off big because,
1809.28s: again, those, the big exits are fewer and far between 30, 40, 50 times your money, but when they
1816.00s: happen, you know, I mean, that's just, that's just like the sun shining out through the clouds,
1820.00s: you know, 50 times your money on, on an investment. It really, you know, really shows you why you're
1826.00s: in this business. Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. It also seems, at least for somebody like you
1831.28s: probably a better use of a diverse skill set because you apply some of the technical expertise,
1836.72s: but you also apply some of the managerial side of things. Did you, did you like the managerial side
1841.68s: or was that kind of annoying and you prefer the more technical stuff or different than that? Sure.
1847.84s: Now, I liked, obviously, when you're used to, and at this point in my career, I was still fairly new,
1853.84s: you know, I had just been associated in, in equity analysis and, and I was still doing, you know,
1860.72s: the, the ground, the groundwork in these, you know, the Excel spreadsheets, the deep, deep research.
1865.76s: So it is, it is always nice to be able to break, break out part of your day to truly look at
1870.88s: something a little bit bigger picture, right? Right. You know, sit on the board of a company and,
1875.20s: and have those, that networking that you have with, with those newer companies, and as well as
1880.08s: with investors and, and other people in that industry. So it's, it's, it's always nice to have,
1885.36s: you know, to do something different other than staring at a computer screen all day.
1889.68s: Sure. What were the board meetings like that you would sit on? Like, what would you do? What would
1896.48s: they talk about? What were the ins and outs of that? Sure. Well, most of them are very procedural.
1901.92s: I, you know, once, once something gets to a board meeting, it's, it's basically been talked about
1907.44s: and rehashed and, and hashed and rehashed ad nauseam just between, you know, the board members
1913.12s: and management and that kind of thing. And their advisors, you know, advisors from the VC firm
1918.72s: and that kind of thing. So, so the board meetings tend to be actually pretty short and procedural,
1923.60s: you know, because everything's, I won't say a rubber stamp, but it's, it's, again, it's already been
1928.24s: talked about, hash, rehashed into, into, basically, you know how the vote's going to come out,
1933.68s: or, you know, a specific project or, or an idea. So the board meetings are all pretty, pretty easy.
1939.92s: Basically, it's everything you do before the board meeting where you're just talking to management,
1944.00s: where you're talking to some of the other board members, where you're talking to the advisors,
1948.56s: you know, just kind of looking at where the company is going, what can be improved, where its
1952.64s: weak points are, you know, a lot of times trying to find, you know, trying to figure out if you can
1957.36s: find a better supplier for something, trying to make those network connections, because, and that's what
1962.80s: it's half of what successful venture capital firms are, is just really making the network connections
1968.80s: between their, between their companies, between their, their invested companies together, see who,
1974.56s: you know, who can be a customer of who, who can help out, you know, somebody else, and help,
1980.00s: who might be a good merger eventually someday. So you're really kind of trying to, try to play
1984.88s: that networking a lot with the, with the other board members with management, that kind of thing.
1990.56s: Sure. And overall experience there, good, bad, indifferent.
1994.88s: Good, really good, you know, it's, again, if it wasn't so much, you know, I was able to build up
2002.32s: investments, private investments into companies myself through that, but again, you know,
2007.76s: other than those investments, I really didn't own, you know, a lot of my own, my own work, right?
2012.56s: My own work was for someone else, it was for, you know, in someone else's business. So if it hadn't
2017.60s: been for that, maybe if I could have been like a partner in that business, then I would have stayed.
2022.88s: But again, I wanted my own thing, I wanted my own, my own assets, obviously even, even in the,
2029.28s: the mid to late 2000s, the internet still felt like something very new, as far as a business idea,
2037.04s: and as far as creating a business, of course, you know, somebody born in 1976, it would feel,
2042.24s: it would still feel new. I'm sure somebody born, you know, after 2000, it feels, well, the internet
2047.44s: has always been there, right? Right. Yeah, yeah, very different.
2052.80s: Switching gears a little bit now to the actual practice of fundamental analysis.
2058.56s: When you think of fundamental analysis as a concept, what does it mean to you?
2064.96s: Sure. Well, you know, trying to, trying just as I did as an equity analyst, you know,
2070.72s: trying to find the present, the present value of those future cash flows, and excuse me.
2076.72s: And, and, you know, where makes the most sense to place an investment over the long term,
2083.76s: right? And the thing is, you know, there is so much, there is so much sentiment value in there
2092.80s: when you're talking less than a year, right? If you're talking stocks less than a year, it's all
2097.44s: investor sentiment, it's all the overall market, right? Wherever, where the overall market is going
2102.00s: to go, where investor sentiment is going to go, that's what's drive stocks in or under under a
2107.52s: year, right? Beyond that. So if you take a little bit longer approach, a little bit longer horizon,
2113.68s: then it is, you know, okay, which stocks, which companies have that competitive advantage? Okay.
2119.04s: And, you know, that's, it's one of those words that's thrown around so much, it really means nothing.
2124.00s: But it's, it's a little bit easier to see, you can get clues to it from an operating margin,
2130.00s: from a sales growth perspective, you know, again, it's a little hard on YouTube because you're
2136.72s: expected to know all stocks in all industries. But again, it's, it's a little, it's easier to just
2142.24s: to focus on one industry. So you know, okay, what's a good operating margin in that industry? You know,
2147.04s: that profitability. What is a good sales growth? What are the companies getting as far as sales growth?
2152.96s: And who's getting the higher sales growth? And why, you know, why are they able to get 20, 25% revenue
2159.04s: growth each year when the average is more like 15, you know, does that point to a competitive advantage
2165.36s: that they're doing that, you know, either with their product, their marketing, just a brand,
2169.76s: something like that, that they're able to steal market share from the, from the rest of their competitors.
2174.56s: Right. And then operating margin, of course, you know, is there some kind of a competitive advantage?
2178.88s: They have in the management of that company of the expenses, you know, not just, not just, you know,
2184.32s: holding off expenses, so not investing in the future. But are they actually, you know, investing,
2189.20s: putting as much money or cash flow, you know, from the cash flow statement, are they investing in
2193.92s: the future? But they still just, you know, beat everyone else out in that operating profitability.
2199.44s: So that's really, you know, through that fundamental analysis, the analysis of the financial
2204.32s: statements and always hit all goes back to there, you know, where, where do you find the companies
2209.76s: that have that advantage and, you know, and that's always going to lead to better returns in those
2215.76s: companies, you know, any company, obviously, it might seem, it's intuitive and it might seem
2221.20s: simplistic, but any company growing sales faster than its competitors, any company that has some
2227.04s: kind of a competitive advantage that's leading to higher profitability, it's going to be the better
2232.32s: return. So if you were to think of three of your favorites on the mental analysis indicators,
2239.84s: it sounds like sales growth would be one of them. What, what would the three be? Sure, sure,
2246.32s: definitely sales growth, but that's got, it's got to be in relation to, you know, the other companies
2251.36s: in its industry. Okay, so, so when you're, when you're comparing stocks to buy or when you're
2255.28s: looking for stocks to buy, you always have to compare, you know, a stock against the same,
2260.08s: against other companies in its same industry, not just the same sector, but in its same industry,
2264.80s: right? So you can't compare Coca-Cola to Nvidia. Okay, because obviously Nvidia's sales growth is
2270.80s: just going to, you know, blow the doors off Coca-Cola. Doesn't mean Coca-Cola isn't a good company,
2275.12s: isn't a great company. It just means it's two entirely different industries. You've got to compare,
2280.72s: you got to compare Coca-Cola to Pepsi and to, you know, Monster Beverage and that.
2285.76s: I think the question there, though, is does the Coca-Cola CEO wear an alligator skin jacket
2291.28s: in signed people's bras? Right? Like that, to me is more what I'm, I just,
2296.48s: there is definitely, and you know, it's, it's funny, but there is definitely a,
2303.60s: an icon kind of value to a company. Okay, the, the, the kind of value that, okay, yeah,
2309.68s: Jensen Wang that Elon Musk adds to add to their companies. You know, it's, it's, it's,
2316.32s: it's an intro, or it's a, it's a intangible value that, you know, whether you add it to the stock
2322.08s: or not, it's kind of weird. It's, it's kind of crazy to think of it like that. I can't,
2327.44s: I can't really think, well, I guess we did, you know, back in the day, you know, we did have CEOs
2331.52s: that were a little bit larger than life. We had Jack Welch over at GE, you know, Bob Igeros,
2337.28s: still at Disney, but in the old days, he was, you know, at Disney first. And, you know,
2342.24s: these guys were, were larger than life. They were media, you know, they, they were,
2346.56s: won't say superstars or even stars, but you know, people knew who they were. They were,
2351.20s: they were, you know, they were role models, but they weren't, they weren't the rock stars. Yeah,
2355.68s: you're right, that, that, that Musk and Jensen Wang and, and, I mean, even, I won't say Tim Cook
2361.92s: is really in that league, you know, but yeah, you know, so, so yeah, there's, there, there,
2368.08s: there is something to be said for that superstar status and, and what that means for the stock price.
2372.88s: But, yeah, you know, you, you, you got to, kind of compare apples to apples, right? So you're always
2378.32s: looking at companies within the same industry. Okay, what's, you know, you, you get your hooks,
2384.32s: you get your old spreadsheet out there and line them all up, get the revenue growth, not just one
2389.52s: year revenue growth, but how are these companies grown revenue over the last five years, you know,
2393.60s: an annualized return or an annualized rate? What's the average there? What's the median?
2398.88s: Who's got the highest ones? And, and really, why is that? You know, it's like, again, like I said,
2403.12s: it's a great clue into who might have a competitive advantage? You know, why is one company able to
2408.16s: get revenue sells so much higher than the others? So it's, it's definitely something that, that you
2414.32s: want to look at, but only in comparison with the others. Operating margins, same thing. You know,
2418.24s: operating margins, basically, it's just your operating income, it's all on the income statement,
2422.32s: your operating income divided by sales. And it's really that core measure of profitability,
2426.72s: right? Because it's, you know, you've got your revenue minus your cost to good sold, which is
2431.68s: basically a lot of factory expenses, your supplier expenses, things like that. Then you've got your
2436.40s: operating expenses, which are, you know, selling general administrative marketing, things like that,
2442.80s: some other operating costs. And that gives you your operating income, right? So, you know,
2448.24s: further down on the income statement, you're going to find your, your interest, your taxes,
2451.84s: things like that, that things that really aren't a part of the business, running the business,
2456.00s: right? So that's why I like to use operating income divided by revenue that gives you your
2459.44s: operating margin. It's really a core profitability for that business. Okay. So that's, you know, and
2465.12s: that's again, compared to others in the industry, how, how is one company able to do so much better
2473.36s: on that profitability than the other's why? You know, is it just better managed? Do they have a
2478.24s: little bit more power over their, over their suppliers? They're able to get lower costs,
2482.96s: things like that. You know, so it's a really good clue into how this company is being managed,
2487.20s: which might have competitive advantage. You've also got just, you know, cash flow, you know, free
2493.28s: cash flow growth, operating cash flow growth, you know, for, it's a little bit different for
2500.00s: really early stage companies where it might be negative cash flow, negative earnings,
2504.64s: things like that. You have to really look at the balance sheet as well, you know, is one company
2509.44s: is growing, but it's so far in debt or, or so far negative cash flow that they're not going to
2515.68s: survive, you know, if they don't have a big stockpile of cash on hand. But it's really, you know,
2522.24s: for most, for most mature companies, it's really just about that growth and how they're able to
2527.52s: generate it, right? Now, you're talking about for revenue growth, for example, you talked about
2534.24s: using like a five year annualized, when you're conducting this fundamental analysis as a broader
2539.44s: process. First, what do you think about the relevant timeframes for your analysis? I imagine it
2548.24s: has to be partially based on your expected holding duration. Is that accurate or how do you choose
2554.56s: what timeframes are most relevant for including prior data points? Sure, sure. Well, of course,
2561.60s: yeah, if you're, if you're planning on holding it for five or 10 or 20 years, you can look back,
2567.20s: you know, five years. Of course, it's got to be, it's got to be to the point where you're really kind
2573.04s: of looking at, you know, what happened in those last five years, what were the major, you know,
2578.08s: economic themes, right? Was the government just throwing money at everything? So everybody,
2582.72s: of course, everybody had 20, 30% revenue growth. So you kind of, you know, a hedge it against that.
2589.20s: So you kind of have to put it, put everything into perspective. But I would say, I would say five
2593.20s: years is good for maybe some of the older companies. You can go back, you know, seven, 10 years,
2598.64s: just to see, just to compare. Okay, so, you know, Coca-Cola versus Pepsi over the last 10 years,
2603.84s: then over the last five years has something changed. Is, is there revenue growth over the last 10
2608.32s: years in relation to each other? Has that changed from 10 years to five years? You know, and why?
2613.92s: What's management doing? You know, so, so you really have to look at, and again, these looking at these,
2621.44s: I don't want the sound to sound too simplistic because you're not just looking at, okay, hey,
2626.24s: this company has the higher revenue growth. This must be the better investment. No, you're looking at
2630.08s: that, you're trying to use that as a clue for, okay, what should I look at in this company? Okay,
2635.76s: if I found that Coca-Cola has, you know, 15% revenue growth annualized over the last five years,
2641.28s: all of its competitors are, you know, three to five percent, then I want to start looking at Coca-Cola,
2646.16s: and I want to start, I want to actually find why, you know, why is it revenue growth? Is it buying that
2651.20s: revenue growth? That's, you know, something you have to look out for for a lot of these companies,
2654.80s: just acquiring other companies. Yeah, their revenue growth is going to look great because they're
2659.20s: buying it, right? They're, they're probably putting on mountains of debt to buy these other companies.
2664.32s: Their revenue growth, growth, it looks great, but it's going to come out and buy them in the ass when,
2668.48s: you know, when all that debt comes due. So you really have to, you know, have to look into the company,
2674.96s: say, okay, is it because of some kind of strategic genius the management has? Is it some kind of
2680.64s: competitive advantage in the brand, in the product, in the marketing, and can that be, you know,
2685.92s: obviously, is that a durable competitive advantage that's going to last out over this five or ten years?
2692.00s: That's really where you got to take that simple, you know, that those kind of simple metrics
2696.88s: that you can look for, you got to take it to those, you know, to that level to really find those.
2702.32s: And the thing is, I mean, for that real long-term investing, the good thing is you probably only have
2709.28s: to do that maybe once every couple of years, right? Because you're looking for something that is
2713.44s: durable, you know, over the next five or ten years. So basically you're finding that you're investing
2719.44s: in it. And then, you know, if the stock doesn't, if the company doesn't do as well, over the next
2724.96s: two years, three years, then you might revisit it and see, okay, what did they do differently? Is it,
2730.08s: is it just, you know, hiccup in time? Or do I need to re-evaluate all of these? But this isn't
2735.84s: something you're doing every, every month or even every year. So it is a lot of work. But once you find
2741.68s: those companies, then, you know, you can hold them, hold them forever, basically.
2747.20s: How do you choose, Dr? Because we talked a lot about comparing within sectors. We talked about not
2754.24s: being able to compare the fact that in video, they have a rockstar CEO that's signing people's bras.
2762.40s: And I don't even know the Coca-Cola CEO right now. So that tells you a lot. So how do you pick
2769.92s: which sectors make the most sense for you? Sure. Well, a lot of it comes down to your goals,
2776.64s: right? Obviously, some sectors are going to grow. Grow faster. They'll have those faster revenue
2782.40s: growth and, you know, should produce better returns. So, all right, so you've got your technology,
2788.48s: your communication services, which used to be all the old telecom stocks, but are now mostly
2793.28s: internet stocks and things like that. So a little bit faster growth. Consumer discretionary tends
2797.28s: to be kind of a growth sector, right? And then you've got, so if you want that portfolio growth,
2803.36s: you would pick maybe one or two of those sectors. If you want maybe a little bit more stable
2809.20s: returns, safety sectors like utilities, like consumer staples, like healthcare, things within those,
2815.60s: then you would pick those. And again, probably the thing people don't realize about real investing
2821.12s: when they just watch YouTube and they watch people pick stocks from all different sectors and
2825.12s: everywhere is again, it pays to be very specific in, you know, your expertise, right? So what I would
2833.04s: say is, okay, hey, pick one sector or maybe a few industries and different sectors. So if you want
2838.88s: to pick a couple of industries out of tech, a couple of industries out of, you know, communication
2843.76s: services, pick a couple of those industries, really get to be an expert and follow the companies
2848.56s: and those industries, analyze the companies and those industries. So you know, you know which
2853.20s: companies are the best stocks in those industries, you know, and that might only be maybe five or
2858.96s: or 10 stocks at most, right? That you really think are the best of the best in their specific
2864.48s: industries. And then to get that diversified portfolio, that a little bit more safety in your
2869.52s: overall portfolio, then you pick maybe a, maybe I'll tell maybe a whole index fund, the SPY
2876.24s: or the VO that just covers all the stock market, or maybe you just buy the other sectors in their,
2881.36s: you know, select sector spider funds, right? So that's going to give you the, you know, the market,
2886.16s: the market return, that's going to give you the return in those sectors that you really don't follow,
2890.40s: you really don't know anything about. That's going to give you a nice smooth return in those.
2895.84s: And then those those five or 10 stocks that you really have studied, you really have researched
2901.28s: within those industries, those will give you that extra return, that extra alpha, right? And again,
2907.44s: so to you put to your question, how do you pick those sectors? Well, again, it's, it's what do
2912.40s: you want to focus on? Do you want to focus on growth? So maybe those five or 10 stocks, they're in
2917.60s: those growth sectors, the the technology, communication services, consumer discretionary, maybe you
2923.36s: overweight those a little bit in your portfolio. So maybe you have 20, 30% of your money in those 10
2929.36s: stocks. And then the other, you know, 60, 70% in the overall market. So that would give it a little
2936.40s: bit of growth bent, right? Or you'll conversely, if you want more of a dividend focus, then you would
2940.96s: focus on those sectors or a safety focus on those sectors and you would overweight your portfolio.
2946.56s: Right? So you're not just you're not just picking one sector, even even if you were to become an
2951.52s: expert in the technology sector or in a few industries in there, you're not still not putting
2955.36s: all of your money in tech stocks. That would just that would be kind of ridiculous, right? You know,
2959.68s: I mean, after the bubble burst in 2000 in tech stocks, I mean, it took 14 years for the NASDAQ
2965.92s: to get back to that to the level it was in 2000. So to have all your money in tech stocks,
2971.20s: you know, you're just you're just begging for that kind of a, you know, that kind of a crash.
2976.88s: So overweight, you know, overweight those sectors that have that kind of growth or that or not
2981.20s: growth, that kind of focus on what you want to focus on. But then, yeah, invest broadly or broadly
2986.80s: across the market and just, you know, ETFs and index funds, things like that.
2991.20s: If you feel some type of way about people being overweight in the NASDAQ, I think we just need
2996.32s: to resensitize you to like Wall Street bets where people are betting their entire life savings
3001.68s: on zero DTE and Nvidia. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, it's I hate bull markets. I got to say,
3009.52s: I hate bull markets sometimes because because everyone is an expert and everyone knows the best
3016.48s: investment, right? You know, you say one bad thing. You say one, I won't even say not even a bad
3021.28s: thing. But, you know, the bear case on, you know, on a hot stock on Nvidia on Palantir, you say how,
3026.96s: how it's just crazy expensive. And people are like, well, I've made 300% on Palantir. So, you
3033.36s: know, shit on you. I must, I'm the expert. I had one comment. Yeah, it's a couple of weeks ago.
3038.56s: And I was saying, I'm in Palantir. This is when it was rather on $80 a share and it's back down to
3044.16s: that we're on 6770, I think now. But you know, I was saying, hey, I mean, two to at this
3050.08s: valuation, it wouldn't need this kind of growth for decades out in the future just to make it,
3055.20s: you know, kind of a breaking even investment. And it's just, there's just ridiculous valuations.
3060.88s: And you know, somebody came back with, you know, oh, 10 years equity analyst, CFA designation,
3066.32s: all that. I've got, I've got none of that. And I already made 300% in Nvidia. So now who's the
3072.32s: asshole? You know, and somehow this guy is right, right? Because, you know, he's made money in.
3078.80s: And I'm sitting here saying, don't buy Palantir. So, yeah, you know, it's just kind of the,
3084.72s: it's, it's how the market works. One of the things I always remind people of is, in my opinion,
3091.92s: I just wrapped up my 18th year of training last year. And in my opinion, the dominant,
3098.56s: the dominant display of mastery of the skill set is endurance. So I'm very happy that he's made 300
3106.64s: percent. Let's come back in a decade and see what it looks like. Like, and it's not wishing bad
3111.92s: on anybody. I want them to make money. But a lot of people, I think, really confuse exactly to
3117.92s: your point short-term sequence of returns, the path. And they confuse it as strategy. And yeah,
3125.20s: it'll catch up. And I won't say I want to say I'm any better. I mean, help when I first started
3128.56s: investing, not to back with my $1,200 I was making as a, as a corporate in the Marine Corps. You
3134.16s: know, I, I, I was momentum investing. I was buying the hot stocks. I didn't know shit from
3139.84s: shine all those far as stocks are analysis or anything. I was just buying, buying what everybody
3145.12s: was talking about, right? You know, so, so I've made, I made, I have probably learned more from
3150.80s: my mistakes than I ever did learning as, you know, as an equity analyst and venture capital
3156.40s: analyst and all that. It's just, you know, when you've been investing for 25, 25 years now,
3162.40s: then you, you, you make a lot of mistakes. And, you know, if you learn from them, then,
3166.96s: then that's, that puts you ahead of the 70 percent of investors out there that either haven't
3172.16s: made the mistakes yet or you made them, but just didn't learn anything and just keep on repeating
3176.72s: those same mistakes over and over again. Beautiful segue into a couple of my last questions for you.
3185.04s: It's always fun to poke fun when somebody else gets hurt, provided that they're not hurt too bad.
3190.56s: So let's talk about the hurt. Let's talk about some of the mistakes. When you look back over your,
3196.64s: your trading career, I, I'd like to, I'd like you to break out, I handful, whatever number you,
3201.52s: you feel like, but I'd like you to break it out into two distinct buckets. I would consider
3207.60s: there to be beginner mistakes, which is often just not knowing what you don't know and those are
3213.60s: kind of easy things, right? Once you're educated on them, then you can typically avoid those. So
3218.56s: I'd love to start with a couple of those and then just to prime your brain and I'll remind you if
3222.40s: you need the, the question again for the second part is what would you consider some of the more
3227.52s: advanced mistakes? And these are things that typically occur later along in your tenure.
3233.60s: You have some experience and there's still something that shows up that pops you out and nowhere.
3239.60s: Sure. Well, you know, the beginner mistakes are just what you see on a lot of YouTube right now.
3245.20s: It's just that chart porn just by following, following a chart up and thinking it's always going to do
3250.00s: that, you know, investing just because that, that happens or really even saying, somebody's saying
3256.32s: it happens. There's a lot of YouTubers out there that basically, you know, do do no more analysis
3260.80s: than just looking at a chart. And I'm not talking about, you know, technical analysis and actually
3266.72s: knowing the trends and patterns to look for. I'm talking about just eyeballing a chart and loving
3272.00s: that it's going up and saying, Hey, you know, let's, let's write it till, grind it till we fall off.
3277.68s: So that's, you know, that's probably the biggest mistake I see new, new investment. And I,
3282.16s: I made, you know, myself way, way back ago. So I think that's it. That's an easy one. I think
3288.00s: that the PE ratio, you know, following, following the easiest measures that, and really not knowing
3294.32s: what goes into them or why, why some of the pitfalls or traps in them. So you know, again, we talked
3300.40s: about the earnings on an income statement and how manipulated it is and why that makes that
3305.92s: PE ratio a little bit, a little bit, you know, not quite what, not quite as valid as you might think.
3314.48s: Right. So, so maybe going a little bit further into, you know, the price to cash flow or, or some
3320.08s: of the other, some of the other measures is a better bet there. So I think that's that kind of,
3325.44s: that kind of a basic, basic analysis and basic investing. I think it's the biggest mistakes
3330.08s: I see people make it. You know, there's a, I think it's, I want to say the Dunnings Kruger graph.
3335.84s: Correct. Right. Dunnings Kruger effect, where, where, you learn a little bit and you're right at
3341.60s: that peak, that peak stupidity, I think is where they call it, where you know, just enough to,
3347.28s: to make yourself dangerous. Right. And I think that's where a lot of investors find themselves at.
3351.68s: They, you know, they put in, you know, a couple hours a week to look at stocks and all of a sudden,
3357.04s: they think, they, you know, they think they, they, they know exactly where things are going and,
3362.16s: and what to do. And it's really only when you start to, usually when you start to make those
3368.24s: mistakes, and only when you hit that first bear market of your, of your investing life, and you
3373.44s: really start to see some of the stupid things you were doing, that, that you really do, do start to
3379.04s: learn, okay, this is what I don't know. This is what I need to learn. And that kind of thing.
3384.08s: So really, really, it's unfortunately, I think for a lot of people, it's just that those mistakes
3389.12s: have to be made, you know, and it would be great to, to be able to say, hey, you know, don't just
3394.08s: follow a chart up, don't just buy what's going up, that kind of thing. But it's, it's almost like,
3398.88s: you know, it's almost like my eight-year-old. You can tell them, you tell them all you want. You,
3403.28s: you have all the advice in the world that they're not going to listen to you. You, they just have to
3407.20s: make those mistakes themselves, and, you know, tell their eight-year-old when they have it,
3412.40s: about those, about those mistakes. I think that maybe a little bit more, a little bit higher level
3419.12s: mistake is learning how to, you know, watch that debt, watch the debt that a company has. I know a
3425.68s: lot of us who we love a great deal, you know, so you look at a stock that's just falling, falling
3429.92s: off of a cliff, you think, hey, it must be a great stock, it must be a great deal. So you just
3434.08s: buy the shares, right, without looking at, okay, well, one, market's pretty smart. Usually when a
3438.64s: stock is going down so much, it's for a reason, you know, so, so what does other people, what do people
3443.44s: see that maybe you aren't looking at, and what's the bear case for the stock? But more importantly,
3448.96s: is, you know, watching that, watching that stock and watching the debt on the company's balance sheet,
3455.04s: the cash flow, it goes, really, this is where the cash flow statement comes in handy, is, okay,
3460.48s: when does that debt come do, you know, what's the cash flow trend in the operational cash flow,
3466.40s: and, you know, how much cash on hand do they have to pay if it's a negative, negative cash flow,
3471.92s: but also how much debt do they have, and what are those interest payments like? Because, you know,
3476.64s: even a great looking company can get into a lot of trouble if they have too much debt. I mean,
3483.36s: case in point, probably my biggest loss ever was P body energy, right, coal producer. This was
3490.08s: probably in 2012, right, and all the coal producers were just falling off of a cliff, you know,
3495.76s: the government was really cracking, coming down hard on, on coal producers, trying to,
3501.28s: trying to move everybody into renewable energies and natural gas and things like that. So,
3506.80s: so yeah, the coal producers were just dying, and, you know, so I saw that, and I thought,
3512.96s: well, hey, yeah, you know, the future is in your renewable energies, the future is in the natural gas,
3517.84s: but at the time, coal was still, I think, something like, you know, 37, 40, 42% of electricity
3525.60s: generation, right, so it wasn't going away any time soon, right, so I thought, okay, you know,
3531.44s: you look at this industry, coal industry, who is, you know, who is the strongest, who's the best
3536.64s: house in the shitty neighborhood, right, and P body, you know, and that size, it was one of,
3540.72s: probably the largest, largest publicly traded coal producer. So I thought, okay, here's a company
3547.36s: that, yeah, it's beaten down just because the entire market is beaten down for, for coal producers,
3552.40s: it's not anything management did, it's just, it's just a horrible environment. So once that
3557.76s: environment improves, once the environment for coal improves, this stock should go to the moon.
3563.04s: So I invested in that, and of course, you know, followed it all the way down. One of the biggest
3567.84s: mistakes an investor can make is, you know, that dollar cost averaging that, that isn't a bad idea,
3573.20s: but that dollar cost averaging, yeah, all the way down, catching that fall in knife, and of
3578.40s: course, they eventually filed bankruptcy, because, you know, even though eventually, and hell,
3584.32s: you know, coal has been a great investment over the last few years, over the last five or six
3588.80s: years, I think, but, but it didn't turn around enough, quick enough for the company to get out from
3595.28s: that massive amounts of debt that it had on the balance sheet. So they just owed too much debt,
3600.88s: and it ended up in bankruptcy. So it lost quite a bit of money from that, actually. And,
3606.16s: and yeah, you know, if you're going to be, you're going to be chasing those, those value companies
3610.56s: that have just sold off, you know, 30, 40, 50 percent, one, you got to, you know, you got to figure
3616.88s: out that bear case, and you got to, you're going to follow me. You can't close your ears just because
3620.24s: somebody is saying something negative about a stock that you think you might like. And then you
3624.48s: got to look at that balance sheet, you got to look at the cash flows and that debt.
3629.84s: I love that too, because it also highlights a really common thing in terms of the temporal
3636.80s: relationship of your assumption with when it actually ends up playing out, because it's your
3640.96s: broader point. The thesis ended up being correct, but just the timing, yeah, the timing hurt you.
3647.92s: Oh, yeah. Timon is, you know, you look at, well, okay, another one of my best examples that I
3654.24s: like is everybody loves the movie Big Short, right? And, and of course, Michael Berry always,
3660.00s: always loves to point out that he predicted the housing crash. Well, he's really trying to
3664.64s: predict it in 2000. If you follow that, watch the movie and you actually follow what actually happened,
3669.20s: he was trying to predict it in like 2002, 2003. Okay. So he was about four years early. If you
3674.24s: actually watch the movie, he only kept his firm, his, you know, his capital, capital management,
3681.60s: his firm out of bankruptcy, because he just stopped returning investor money. You know, people
3685.92s: were asking for their money back and he said, nope, I'm, I'm suspending all, all withdrawals right now.
3691.36s: So that is the only way that he kept his firm out of bankruptcy. But he ended up being right,
3697.28s: you know, so, so fully for him, he, he became a big star. And, you know, but, but, but, yeah, being,
3706.64s: one of the biggest lessons I've learned is being early is just can be just as bad as being wrong.
3713.04s: Yeah. And sometimes, sometimes it's even worse because if you're early and you still have
3717.44s: conviction, you start throwing more money at it because it's losing and you're like, I still feel
3721.52s: this is going to happen. Yeah. No, I literally couldn't agree more with you there. And it's, it's
3726.08s: funny because I always think how razor thin the margin is between like genius and idiot. And
3734.16s: that example is that razor thin margin. He's a genius because it worked. But just I always think of
3740.56s: it in terms of probabilities. That's a lot of my background as in stats. That's like how many other
3746.48s: versions of this happened with other people, different funds that failed on the same idea,
3752.16s: but just couldn't make it across that finish line. He was, he was so overextended in this one bet
3758.48s: that it almost destroyed his firm. So, so, there's a point where you got to go back to, you know,
3763.36s: Warren Buffett's old or what's attributed to him, his old saying is just, you know, rule number one,
3768.56s: don't lose money. Right. So you may feel, you may feel you've got the, the inside scoop on the company,
3775.28s: or a company or the economy or the market where it's going. But if it means, you know, placing bets,
3782.32s: you know, placing outsized bets on one direction and hoping that turns out, you know, those,
3787.84s: those binary bets like options where, you know, you could lose everything if you're wrong. Then,
3792.96s: you got to think, okay, you know, what if I'm, what if I'm early, what if I'm really early on this?
3797.20s: What, what does the future look like for that? And then kind of try to try to hedge some of that and
3802.56s: really, you know, I mean, it's, it's not wrong to place, you know, directional bets and put conviction,
3808.56s: or put money behind your conviction. But, but again, you know, what happens if you're early? And
3813.92s: what does that look like? Well, it also goes back to the point we're talking about before is, you know,
3820.48s: placing bets with conviction is one thing, but survival is another. And again, to me, the ultimate
3827.20s: mark of a seasoned investor trader is tenure, it's duration. So yeah, you might be worried about
3834.08s: getting that thousand bagger that you're super convicted in, but if you mortgage the house on it and
3838.88s: you're wrong, even if you win, if you apply that methodology going forward, you're gonna, you're
3844.64s: gonna unwind it at some point. I always find that part really funny. How there's a lot of really,
3849.36s: really, really smart people that have done really great in the markets. There's a couple of super
3854.56s: famous ones that have done really great in the markets. But then because of like mistiming and
3859.28s: things like that, they end up losing all their money. Yeah, it'll get you sooner or later.
