0.48s: what's up Al quick Market updates
2.48s: there's not a whole lot going on but a
3.96s: few things worth discussing as it sits
6.24s: today Futures right now after the close
9.28s: are a little bit down across the board
11.96s: oils up just a little bit S&P 500 is
14.36s: closing in on highs it's at
17.16s: 60746 and 3mon highs right now and
19.76s: alltime highs 609 for spy specifically
22.32s: Q's finally cracked highs on a 3mon time
25.68s: frame up to 530 iwm is Bucking the trend
29.32s: so we're seeing large caps and q's those
32.12s: two sectors themselves definitely
35.60s: showing strength and small caps rolling
37.80s: over interesting because there's a lot
40.48s: of speculation about the upcoming fomc
42.80s: meeting what that could look like as far
44.76s: as a rate cut we'll take a look at that
47.12s: and I think the market is starting to
49.92s: price in what they're thinking could be
51.56s: happening as per usual it's a
53.36s: discounting mechanism but I didn't
56.00s: really expect to see this level of
57.68s: weakness trailing off of 24 4 now we're
60.88s: down hovering right around like 235 mid
63.88s: 230s that's a little bit low here vix is
66.72s: sub4 so very low bonds are rolling back
69.60s: over Bitcoin is Comfortably hovering
72.56s: above 100,000 for the time being we'll
74.64s: see how that continues to go cross the
76.80s: sectors comms still super strong energy
79.72s: still super not strong financials have
82.28s: definitely rolled over pretty
83.76s: significantly not massively but on a
86.04s: relative basis Industrials same story
90.00s: technology is doing pretty well so we do
92.40s: know within QQQ that it's the com sector
95.88s: that's really driving that performance
98.08s: and we can see discretionary still
101.04s: crushing I have been following along
103.36s: with this for a while I have a couple
104.92s: trades that are designed to continue to
108.08s: follow this
109.28s: momentum and I keep waiting for the
112.00s: music to stop because I don't know why
114.00s: the music is playing at this point in
115.72s: discretionary it's been so decoupled
119.28s: from
120.36s: which is interesting not that they're
121.60s: one to one or anything just cuz they
122.92s: have they both have consumer in the name
124.28s: doesn't mean they're the same thing
125.24s: they're not but normally they're a
126.76s: little more correlated than they've been
128.36s: they're they're almost unlocked at this
130.08s: point which I can't help but find that
132.56s: to be a little bit interesting now if we
135.40s: grab the FED watch tool we can see that
139.72s: the current probabilities for a cut on
143.40s: the 18 D meeting are
146.68s: 98.6% this is moved up Mass massively
150.88s: there's been so much pricing dislocation
155.32s: with respect to the expectation around
157.28s: this specific rate cut is not quite
160.68s: confounding but very interesting the
162.60s: market normally is very persistent in
165.52s: It's ability to sniff out what it think
168.12s: may or may not happen it's a collective
170.32s: interface of knowledge but when you see
172.72s: these big kinds of changes it tells us
174.60s: that there's a lot of new information
176.00s: coming out that's causing people to
177.36s: change their opinions so when you go
179.20s: from 65 5% probability of a cut a month
181.48s: ago to 98% probability of a cut one as
185.04s: the event gets closer we tend to become
186.68s: a little more certain because there's
187.84s: less information coming out likely to
189.84s: impact it but it does show that there's
191.64s: a change in landscape there's a change
193.12s: in information that leads to this and
196.56s: for a while the FED has been messaging a
198.96s: slower more pragmatic approach not
201.72s: necessarily trying to jump the gun too
203.44s: far a lot of people felt that they
205.48s: waited too long to start then when they
207.32s: started a lot of people felt that they
208.92s: started too heavy
210.48s: with a 50 basis point cut as compared to
213.20s: a quarter and now it looks like we're
216.92s: targeting about a quarter point which is
218.56s: what would be expected in terms of a cut
220.48s: if it was anything bigger than that that
222.08s: means things are going very very poorly
224.24s: and that would be not well received by
226.60s: the market as a whole but the entire
229.16s: runup in small caps previously was due
232.64s: to a lot of the expectation around this
234.36s: rate cut now the rate cut seems near
237.12s: certain and small caps are rolling over
239.32s: so that tells us again that there's more
241.72s: going on underneath the surface as per
244.36s: usual and it's difficult to sniff it out
248.20s: but it has me questioning a few things
251.60s: as it sits we need to see how we roll
254.72s: out here let's grab the economic
257.32s: calendar really quick and see what we
260.60s: think might be coming up that could
262.76s: impact this
264.68s: obviously CPI came in right around in
268.32s: line with expectations a little bit
269.88s: lights which is a pretty good thing
272.92s: actually consensus was
275.72s: 31534 ke at 31549 so light little
281.24s: excessive compared to the consensus in
283.36s: the forecast but not by much at all and
285.48s: definitely lower than the prior so that
287.52s: means is CPI is moving generally in the
290.60s: correct direction and then tomorrow we
292.64s: have PPI coming out which will be
294.48s: another really big release across the
296.64s: board so I think the market is is seeing
300.72s: a little bit of weakness but it does
302.80s: look like inflation is still generally
305.16s: holding steady here which tends to bode
308.04s: well so let's take a look at a couple
310.16s: stocks quick because there's a few that
314.44s: stuck out to me first and
316.80s: foremost there was a trade in Google
319.16s: today that was
321.80s: interesting if we take a look at Google
324.16s: it had a blazing day 5 1 12% move and
329.48s: that doesn't sound like a lot of you're
330.64s: used to growth stocks but for something
332.84s: like this that's a that's a big look at
334.52s: the size of the candle compared to
335.64s: everything else right it tells you
336.56s: everything you need to know for an
337.68s: intraday move that's massive for
339.88s: something like Google and I noticed when
343.92s: it was trading around
345.36s: 19543 so very close to where we are now
349.28s: I saw out in 13 D the 190 puts there was
354.24s: a total volume transacted there at
357.64s: 43,000 the volume over oh why there was
361.80s: massively different so let's take a look
363.24s: at this let's go to 13 d 2 days from now
367.76s: and let's take a look at these 190 puts
370.00s: which are just shy out of the money take
371.92s: a look at this the oi on those prior was
376.08s: 137 and the oi now is going to be
381.48s: 43,4 in change a tremendous expansion
385.84s: that's people expecting downside that's
387.72s: why those puts are being open there we
389.76s: can take a look at some of the
391.44s: transactions that led to that but it
394.56s: looks like people are perspectively
396.84s: fading this pretty significant draw up
400.08s: move which doesn't entirely surprise me
402.56s: especially in something like Google it's
403.92s: not necessarily a bet against the
406.16s: company thinking that it's going to
407.40s: Crater or anything like that but it is
409.64s: absolutely speculation that maybe it's
412.76s: run up a little bit heavy here so let's
414.92s: take a look weird that GameStop's always
417.64s: in there that's typically the default
419.08s: but let's take look at
420.80s: Google and let's take a look at
424.28s: today and let's see right now it should
427.76s: be sorting by premium which we don't
429.84s: actually care about so much in this case
432.04s: I want to look specifically at the
434.80s: Friday expiration and I want to look
437.84s: specifically at those
439.88s: puts because we can get an idea of how
443.56s: those came through
445.80s: today so let's take a look we looks like
452.04s: like yeah they were getting banged all
456.76s: day literally all day and when we have
460.96s: these style moves doesn't really
463.24s: surprise me because people are going to
466.28s: play the short-term price perceived
468.72s: price reversion price as a mean
471.32s: reverting phenomenon is a little more
473.72s: difficult to discuss and quantify CU it
475.24s: doesn't actually have mean reversion
476.92s: Tendencies like something like
478.12s: volatility but does have extensions and
480.68s: retracements we can see those quantify
482.52s: those so yeah when I look at this it
486.04s: does seem like a pretty big move so it
488.72s: doesn't surprise me to see people fading
490.24s: them but man this was bit up really
492.32s: really heavy those 190s they came in
495.24s: super heavy I just thought it was
496.36s: interesting I it doesn't lead me to
498.08s: believe that downside is immediately
501.12s: coming but I also saw in Google GOOG L
505.60s: Google the 13d 1872 puts those came in
509.52s: at
510.20s: 2247 so that can also be people that are
512.88s: getting into puts just to lock in
514.64s: profits which Too Short Term though
517.36s: that's the argument against that always
520.32s: interesting the market always has a way
522.48s: to leading to very interesting movements
524.48s: that can be difficult to explain now
526.44s: let's take a look at Sofi Sofi had a
527.84s: good move today and with Sofi I got
532.08s: close to a re-entry so I had exited I I
535.04s: talked about that a while ago just
537.08s: because it was rotating sideways
538.64s: starting to to fall down but it's a
540.24s: little too early I want to see it above
542.32s: that 16003 handle that's just because I
544.88s: want to see that the consolidation is
546.36s: held I want to see that then it's
548.36s: building a base price continuation and I
550.84s: genuinely do expect to see that because
553.04s: it was bit up really heavy today the
554.76s: volume was overwhelmingly buy side so it
557.00s: looks like people are interested in it
559.04s: but you never know and that's why I
561.52s: trade the way that I do especially with
563.08s: directional momentum breakout following
565.20s: TR uh strategies that I would apply to
567.32s: something like this it's a very very
569.16s: different approach and it's depending
571.36s: entirely on what price actually does
573.28s: it's very little my expectations I do
575.64s: apply probabilistic assessments because
577.28s: it helps me size figure out what risk
579.68s: reward makes sense but I need to see it
582.36s: behaving as it should in air quotes cuz
586.04s: how should something behave but this I
588.32s: want it to go up so that's why we are
590.84s: holding tight right now no Sofi position
593.36s: but looking and if it looks like it can
595.72s: hold this rally then it will be time for
598.16s: reentry as always if there's anything
600.24s: you want me to take a look at let me
601.56s: know be an outlier I'll see you later
