0.00s: What's up everybody? I am super stoked. I have you on some Claire here with me and I was just telling him before we started.
10.00s: That I'm a huge fan. I have essentially read all of his books, which are fantastic reads. We'll talk a little bit about those in a little bit. But first and foremost, you and first. Thank you for taking some time to chat with us. And then secondly, welcome to the conversation. Great to have you.
25.00s: Thanks very much for having me. I'm always always delighted to give my all considered opinions on things. So this is great. I'll talk about options. All day.
34.00s: It's actually really cool though that you feel that way because you know, I feel like a lot of people once they figure out their way, sometimes they don't want to share quite as much and they just want to do. So I think it's just really, really awesome that in addition to being able to do something you are actively trying to share information about it, which is just kind of incredible.
54.00s: So with that is the background. I've read, like I said, all of your books, but for the people that are listening in that might be coming across you, maybe for the first time.
65.00s: I would love to start with like, how did you get into trading? Why trading? Obviously, I know that you have a very technical background. But what led you into the world of trading as compared to any other avenue open to you?
79.00s: Well, actually at the time, I didn't think there were any other avenues open to me, which is sort of why I fell into trading. I'm from New Zealand originally and New Zealand does not have a history of trading in the same way the US does.
93.00s: There are historical reasons for that in terms of the way the stock market was structured and also taxation laws. It made it much cheaper for people to speculate on property rather than stocks.
106.00s: So I don't know when you're anything about stocks. I didn't know anything about stocks. I did my PhD in England. I always wanted to be a physics professor, always thought I was going to be until I figured out, hey, I didn't really like doing what academics spend most of their time doing.
125.00s: And I probably wasn't good enough to get the sort of job I wanted. Academias brutally competitive and I was probably looking at three or four postdocs before I got a permanent position.
140.00s: And that permanent position probably wasn't going to be Caltech or MIT. So at that point, I started looking around and I remember actually saying to someone at the time, the problem is I had no skills.
153.00s: And she was trying to make me feel better, of course. So she was like, oh, you can do this and this and this. I'm like, yeah, really, really kind of can I. And this was before, this was before everyone knew how to use computers. So I didn't use a computer for my PhD. It was very much old school, you know, pencil and paper mathematics.
172.00s: So Nick Leeson at the time did me the favor of blowing up bearings, bang, which was the oldest English merchant bank. So that was big story over there. And so the popular press was talking about it and explaining these things called derivatives.
193.00s: And then they said, and these things are now being placed by PhDs and mathematics and physics and they're called rocket scientists. So I was like, oh, probably could do that.
205.00s: So I started going for interviews based on that. It was really just a matter of timing and what I heard about. And I kind of thought, sure, I like sort of making bets so I can do numbers. If that's all it takes, I can do that.
221.00s: So you came across derivatives in that context. And then after you did that, how did you find your way into options specifically compared to all the other kind of derivatives that are out there, you know, top of mind futures. Obviously, there's way more than that. But why options?
240.00s: Okay. So I just want to be very clear. I had no idea what I was doing at this point.
245.00s: Like coming from the outside, I didn't know the difference between trading sales being a court being a court, damn, to me, it does.
256.00s: These none of these jobs are particularly publicly visible. So I could have ended up quite easily in a completely different spot. I see.
267.00s: Futures was never going to happen because of the culture of futures trading in England, which is very, very old store, very east end sort of, you know, almost the guys who would be sort of working in market stores would have been taxi drivers, would have been running pubs.
285.00s: It's a very, very blue collar type thing. Those guys, they were never going to hire me. So it was really those guys didn't want me more than I didn't made a deliberate choice to get into options. The people who were hiring people like me were the options first.
301.00s: And the big ones at that time were all from America. They don't go on to Europe instead of operations there. So they knew very well what they wanted. It was basically mimicking what they've been doing in the US for four or five years before that.
315.00s: Interesting. So it was kind of like you are growing where you were planted almost. That's where the opportunity was and you kind of found your way into options that way as compared to like a discrete decision point like I want this versus that.
327.00s: Yeah, I chose the particular job based on the people I wanted to work with and the firm type I wanted to do as opposed to the exact thing I would be doing.
342.00s: Like I was also offered a job as a like a real quant, you know, pricing things and doing structured pricing and also as a convert sales trader.
356.00s: So I didn't know the difference between any of these things like I said, and I really just went on the basis of I think these people are kind of cool. I'd like to work with them.
366.00s: Got it. So you go through a couple jobs. I assume or what did your first couple gigs look like just to have an idea of your evolution in the option space.
378.00s: Actually, I've had a lot of jobs if you look at my resume, but it's really largely two jobs.
385.00s: Because most of them have been with the same group of people in various different contexts. So I started off doing market making.
397.00s: I evolved to doing a few of the stuff for a couple of years. Then I was doing sort of management risk management stuff. They're like quit and just traded my PA and did some work and starting a hedge fund.
413.00s: And in the last couple of years, I've gone back to those guys again. So it's really, it looks like I've had a lot more jobs than I really have. I don't say I've had two jobs.
427.00s: Got it. And so I think people like you have one of the most fascinating perspectives because you've kind of seen, you know, two sides of the coin. You were on institution market making side.
439.00s: And then obviously you are also trading your personal account. I would love to talk just a little bit about that because some of my favorite things I've heard you say and things that I've read of yours is kind of dispelling some of these common myths that retail traders have about the institution side.
457.00s: And I also tend to agree with your general hypothesis that a lot of it. I don't want to speak for you, but it seems like retail traders in general. We want to blame something. It can't be us that's doing something wrong. There's got to be a boogie man out there that's making all of this go awry as compared to just not having a positive expecting strategy.
476.00s: So I would love to touch on that real quick. That's one of my favorite parts of your dialogue that I've heard so far and it was actually like really pertinent. I think to a lot of the retail community. So as we retail think about institutions market makers. Again, a lot of times we think they're the boogie man. They're doing something wrong to affect us. I'm curious what your take is on that kind of thought process. And if you could shed a little light on the institutional side and what it's actually like for them.
505.00s: Yeah, okay. So first it's not just retail people who like to blame something else.
512.00s: A professional trading disc is full of the biggest crybabies you've ever heard. Nothing's in their fold. It's always the technology. It's always someone else who use something toxic order flow.
523.00s: No one can complain like traders. So that's something retail has got down very well.
528.00s: Okay, they learned that as well as the first. I think a couple of the big misconceptions are what the professionals do is a completely different job to what retail guys do.
546.00s: It's in the same space, but it would be like comparing. This is an analogy on this breathing up so it might be terrible. It's like comparing a card dealer to a card designer.
560.00s: They both work in the order space. But it's a completely different job. retail have to go out and sort of scan the whole world for little niches that they can make money in.
573.00s: And they typically have to jump from thing to thing because none of these things last very long. And it's all a matter of chasing the hot thing. So a few years ago it was facts.
583.00s: And then it was the meme stops and then it was crypto and so on and so on.
589.00s: The institutional guys don't do that. If you're an institutional trader, you will be brought in and you'll be trained.
596.00s: And so there's this idea, oh, you can't learn trading. Well, tell that to the professional firms who trained thousands of traders.
604.00s: And what they do is they train you to do a very specific thing.
608.00s: Your option and equity options market maker. You will then spend the rest of your trading career doing that.
615.00s: You become a very, very specialized in one thing as opposed to retail who are jack of all trades and jumping around.
624.00s: And that's one of the reasons retail is so much harder because because you have to reinvent yourself for a little time.
633.00s: And professionals don't. And that reinvention process is just a very, very difficult thing.
639.00s: And markets evolve much quicker than people can. So what retail are trying to do is very difficult.
647.00s: And one of the reasons retail don't succeed and they're always like, well, we don't succeed because the pros have better information and better technology.
654.00s: That's not it. There's all the reason the pros do it is because they're doing it easier game.
660.00s: I mean, they have the costs and the capital backing to run these very, very low margin trades at very big size and make money.
670.00s: Most of the things pros do the retail can't do because it's too expensive.
674.00s: Like you can't do dynamic hedging and an option as a retail guy. You'll just get eaten alive by costs.
680.00s: That kind of thing. So I think that's the biggest misconception.
688.00s: The other things and all the things which I've gone about in the past that a lot of retail like to blame market makers from manipulating market.
697.00s: Market makers who know abilities and manipulate anything.
701.00s: A market maker is completely at the mercy of income or a flow.
707.00s: They are the last people to have any control over the market.
711.00s: And only when you see something like a stock getting pinned an expiration.
715.00s: It's normally hurting the market makers. The market makers are doing that.
720.00s: So that's another another misconception and the idea of all high frequency trading is making it harder for us.
727.00s: No, it's made it so much easier for retail because they've reduced costs.
733.00s: I'm old enough to remember when stocks were trading on the New York Stock Exchange and they were eight for the dollar.
739.00s: And you know, good luck getting a specialist to actually fill you.
744.00s: Whereas now, I mean, every stock is all over the choice market. It's so much easier in that regard.
751.00s: You still have costs, but the bid asks for it is no way near that hurdle it used to be.
757.00s: Got it. And I think that that makes a ton of sense.
760.00s: By the way, I see you drinking a seltzer water. Is that accurate?
765.00s: Yes.
766.00s: What flavor do you have?
768.00s: This is grapefruit.
770.00s: Oh, bold choice. I'm going with Mandarin orange myself, but grapefruit is also respectable.
776.00s: I like all of them apart from coconuts and the berry flavors.
780.00s: Coconut stresses me out.
782.00s: Coconut.
783.00s: Yeah.
784.00s: Coconut is a is a seltzer water. That just doesn't sound right.
788.00s: So one of the things I actually from a personal perspective, this is one of my favorite things about doing these kind of conversations.
794.00s: I also get to interlase like my general personal curiosities.
797.00s: And one of them is.
799.00s: I understood your analogy.
801.00s: I forgot which book it's from, but it was kind of like that market makers are essentially the scavengers where they're just trying to pick up, you know, what they can along the way and they can't necessarily affect the market in any like significant way.
814.00s: I'm curious how you juxtapose that against like stop hunting or something like that.
820.00s: Because to me that seems like there's a little bit of nuance there.
824.00s: And I'm just curious your thoughts.
827.00s: Yeah. Okay.
829.00s: So.
831.00s: That idea of stop hunting.
833.00s: I don't even know if it really goes on much anymore.
835.00s: That was a thing.
837.00s: 30 years ago.
838.00s: But the futures markets were a lot thinner.
841.00s: 30 years ago.
842.00s: And.
844.00s: The futures market makers and high frequency trading because high frequency trading is basically just using all the tricks that the old guys use.
852.00s: There's nothing new in high frequency trading.
854.00s: It's basically just futures trading circa 1995.
857.00s: Done fast.
860.00s: The better.
861.00s: It's a very different game from options.
863.00s: What options the bed asks Fred is incredibly wide.
867.00s: So it's easy to make that money initially.
870.00s: And then you have to do the decomposing part of it.
874.00s: Hinge that into exploration, mitigating the risk and so forth.
878.00s: So the hard bit about options market making is risk management.
882.00s: Future's market making the bed asks Fred is minuscule.
886.00s: So a lot of the money they made wasn't pure market making.
890.00s: It was doing stuff like hunting stops creating little microsquees is.
895.00s: It is a very different game.
900.00s: And it's not pure market making the same way.
903.00s: It wouldn't be.
906.00s: They do it like that.
908.00s: Be like I'm 343434.
910.00s: But then the big money they may would be from pushing the market around like you say.
915.00s: But they can push it a few points.
918.00s: You know, they could run the sprues up 200 points.
921.00s: I mean, they're not doing that.
923.00s: But they do have the abilities to put these little microsquees together.
928.00s: Got it.
929.00s: That makes a ton of sense.
930.00s: I was actually wondering if it was a timing thing.
933.00s: So just in terms of like the market conditions.
935.00s: So I think that's a really good explanation.
938.00s: Dovetailing off of that.
940.00s: One of the other things I wanted to ask you is.
944.00s: I feel like as the retail traders become.
949.00s: I don't want to use the terms sophisticated just because I think we're a far away off of that.
952.00s: But comparatively, I feel like there is a certain level of gain in just general retail trader sophistication.
960.00s: I notice a lot of retail traders compare their approach to a institution side approach.
969.00s: And it always confuses me a little bit because I feel like retail traders feel like.
974.00s: What the professional approach is is the right approach.
978.00s: It's almost like if you play sports and you want to get good at basketball, you kind of watch the NBA.
983.00s: But to me, it seems like that could be a dangerous comparison.
987.00s: But I wanted to get your thoughts on that thought process.
992.00s: Yeah.
993.00s: Okay.
994.00s: So what basketball, right?
995.00s: If you're a rec league player, you are playing the same game as the NBA.
1000.00s: You're just playing a lot worse.
1002.00s: Whereas retail traders are doing a have to do different things to the pros.
1007.00s: And like I said, for a couple of reasons, first, most of what the pros do is very low margin on massive capital bases and low costs.
1017.00s: Retail can't do that.
1019.00s: And if they try, they're going to lose.
1021.00s: The other thing is, if you take a firm, one of the big options trading firms like in a basketball home,
1027.00s: they'll have hundreds of tech people and faults.
1031.00s: It's a team effort.
1033.00s: So, you know, you as a retail guy might have a garch model that you programmed in VBA or Python.
1040.00s: But Susquehanna has a garch model that 50 people have been working on for the last 20 years.
1047.00s: Even if you try and do that, it would be the same as the rec league player stepping on the court with Steph Curry.
1054.00s: It's just at that point, just ridiculous.
1057.00s: You're going to lose.
1059.00s: If you do the same thing as the pros, you're not going to make money.
1064.00s: So I think there's a misconception about what the pros actually do.
1068.00s: And then there's this idea that you have to do what the pros do, whereas you should be doing something completely different.
1075.00s: Right. And that's actually a beautiful segue into the concept of just the variance premiums.
1083.00s: So pretty much all of your books touch on that in some capacity.
1087.00s: And I think it's a really interesting concept because for anybody listening in,
1093.00s: the way that you describe it is the most pragmatic in my opinion.
1099.00s: And I think it's a lot of traders, I think accidentally find their way into it.
1104.00s: But they don't even really know what's going on with it or why what they're doing is working.
1109.00s: So to feel that back a little bit, I'd love to hear how you even came across the concept of the variance premium.
1116.00s: I know that you've been studying derivatives markets essentially back from, I think you use an example of an Italian guy.
1122.00s: Oh, no, that was for market making. Sorry.
1125.00s: The guy that essentially kept market making, even though his his thing up burned out.
1130.00s: Yeah, that's actually really.
1132.00s: America found it.
1133.00s: Yeah, I love that.
1134.00s: Actually, do you do mine just explaining that real quick?
1137.00s: Because I think just to switch gears, the concept of market making one of the points you made in your book is essentially they have to make markets in order to make money.
1145.00s: If they don't make markets, they're not making money.
1147.00s: And you gave this really cool example about that that that approach.
1152.00s: Yeah, it's a long time ago.
1153.00s: I'm not sure I remember all the details.
1156.00s: I mean, but as a market maker, you've got one thing in your fate, which is the bit asked for you have nothing else in your fate.
1163.00s: Like if the market trends, you get run over.
1166.00s: If you're trading against someone who knows something, you get run over.
1170.00s: If the market becomes more volatile, you'll get run over.
1175.00s: All you can do is collect the bit asked spread.
1178.00s: So you have to do it as often as possible.
1181.00s: And to the point where you have to do everything in your favor to be able to do that.
1187.00s: So if you ever get to a situation based on inventory or technology problems where you can't trade, that is the worst thing.
1197.00s: Because you'll still be losing money because of the inventory you've got, but you have no ability to make money.
1204.00s: And that's the story of I can't remember what was.
1207.00s: I can't remember the name of them, but he was the founder of Bank of America, what the kind of Bank of America.
1212.00s: It was just a good story because it was after the earthquake in whenever that was, it was 1876 or something.
1222.00s: And like his bank got knocked down and he was like, look, I'm going to keep trading. That's it.
1227.00s: Everyone else has stopped his age in the market.
1230.00s: I'm going to be the one who's going to be borrowing and lending money.
1234.00s: And it's just a great attitude for market makers to have.
1238.00s: When things go crazy, if you're the guy you can make markets, that's what you walk.
1244.00s: Yeah, I actually, I looked them up. I think his name is Gianini.
1248.00s: And yeah, I just, I looked up that story because I thought it was so fascinating.
1252.00s: But thanks for sharing that one. I think it's a good thing for retail to even understand the world and the motivations of market makers.
1260.00s: And I think that, you know, that explains a part of it at least.
1264.00s: So switching back over to the retail side, you at some point came across variance risk premium.
1270.00s: Well, different kinds of variance premiums, but specifically variance risk premium.
1274.00s: How did you find that? Like what led you? How did you come across that?
1279.00s: Okay, well, so I certainly, it's been around for you today.
1284.00s: And there weren't an awful lot of options books talking about options trading from any degree of sophistication.
1296.00s: But there were always traders. And one of the things they always said was, it's a full trading saying.
1305.00s: If in doubt hands out.
1308.00s: Because that's a sell your selling.
1311.00s: If you don't know whether a price is a good buy or a good sell, it's probably something you should be selling.
1318.00s: Because they knew that the edge was always with the sell.
1322.00s: And they know the edge was and math wasn't there, the days are wasn't there.
1328.00s: But they knew that options were overpriced.
1331.00s: And they knew what it's been since then is really just having more data to back up that idea.
1339.00s: And that's essentially what I've basically been trading my entire career.
1345.00s: And I think that's one of the things you can do as a retail person, but you could do this.
1351.00s: You either have to jump around from thing to thing.
1355.00s: Or you have to become an expert in one thing.
1358.00s: And if you become an expert in the variance premium, you could spend your rest of your life trading that one effect.
1364.00s: Knowing when it's high, knowing when it's low, looking for the specific situations where it's a good trade and where it isn't.
1372.00s: It's a different kind of skill.
1375.00s: Like I tried to do the thing where I'm always looking for the hot new thing and jumping from thing.
1381.00s: And I know some guys who do it and they've done very well.
1383.00s: I can't do it because that requires.
1388.00s: It requires a lot of imagination to find these things.
1393.00s: And that's just not me.
1395.00s: I'm better at thinking about something as a problem.
1400.00s: I wouldn't say deeply, but thinking about one thing.
1404.00s: So I think I have a sort of two complimentary approaches to trading.
1409.00s: I'm not ideally you do both, but I don't know what you want to do both.
1413.00s: Fair enough.
1415.00s: And that leads me to the next question for you.
1419.00s: Is when I think about retail traders and their approach to the markets, I think you've mentioned it a couple times now where, you know,
1429.00s: I think that's what I think is the most important thing is that you should be integrated somewhere for retail traders, not necessarily the only thing they always do, but at least somewhere they should they should take a look at it.
1441.00s: If you were a retail trader starting out right now with let's just say I think the average retail trader account is pretty small like maybe 5K or something like that.
1452.00s: What would you be thinking about specifically is it pertains to the VRP.
1458.00s: It's tough because I think, and I don't know this because it's a long time since I've had that kind of account.
1468.00s: I think you need $25,000 to trade naked options.
1472.00s: That sounds right. I'm honestly not sure myself, but that's that's right.
1478.00s: That would be the, that's the ideal way to trade the variance premium is to be able to trade to sell sprangles sell sprangles.
1488.00s: On a very small account, you don't have that option, but there are volatility ETFs and ETFs and there are VIX futures and they both are exposed to the variance premium.
1501.00s: It's a different variance premium.
1506.00s: The way options, the variance premium just see as options are overpriced on average.
1513.00s: But there are lots of sort of subfactors that go into that and it's the equivalent of saying stocks go up, which is also a very well documented thing.
1524.00s: If you just look at the charts, they go up.
1526.00s: But not all stocks go up at the same rates. Some stocks are better than others. There's value stocks since more cap stocks in different sectors.
1535.00s: There are still some ways to break down the variance premium.
1539.00s: And one of them is just the fact that the implied volatility has characteristics on its own.
1546.00s: And you can trade that through the VIX futures.
1551.00s: Like very easy example before a timed event of uncertainty.
1558.00s: So you've got an uncertain outcome at a given time, like an election.
1563.00s: The VIX will almost always go up and then it will always collapse.
1568.00s: So there's a very simple trade there.
1571.00s: Like before the event, you buy the VIX right before the event, you short it and then you cover it.
1577.00s: Exactly when you do it depends on the events. You have to do a bit of work.
1581.00s: You know, if a FOMC it might be five minutes for an election. It might be two weeks.
1586.00s: You know, I can't tell you those numbers. I'm not calling them back. I just don't know.
1592.00s: But that's another misconception people have while I'm about to start renting.
1596.00s: They think everything is a secret.
1599.00s: Whereas very little that works is actually a secret because there aren't that many things that really work.
1608.00s: So that work tend to have worked for a long time.
1612.00s: Hence there are generations of people who've been doing them.
1616.00s: If they were like pass trading that works.
1620.00s: And 35 years ago it might have only been one small group of traders in you about it.
1626.00s: But now I can type in pass trading into Google.
1629.00s: Well, I can find a YouTube course that teaches you how to do it.
1633.00s: Probably not well, but you know what I mean?
1636.00s: It's like the stuff that works.
1639.00s: It tends to be pretty well known now.
1642.00s: So I can't. Well, I'm not going to tell you everything I do.
1647.00s: I can tell you literally 90% of what I do.
1650.00s: And it's not going to make any difference to when I make money or not.
1653.00s: Well, I think there's value in that too to be completely honest.
1656.00s: I actually really enjoy that about your books is that you share math that I did stats is part of my undergrad and my grad.
1665.00s: And I think that it's very interesting.
1668.00s: So that book like especially in most recent book.
1671.00s: School to shit out of me in some of those math sections it did.
1675.00s: It took me a minute of like rereading through it to figure it out.
1678.00s: But I think that it's really cool that you share the basis behind things.
1683.00s: And then you even share like some examples, you know, to help people connect those dots.
1688.00s: So I actually respect the fact that you share even as much as you do.
1692.00s: And I think that's a similar voice where I don't like giving I don't think handing somebody an answer to something is doing much for them because then they're reliant on that specific scenario.
1701.00s: They lose the ability to think and adapt for themselves.
1703.00s: So I think honestly I think you share a lot as is.
1707.00s: So going back to kind of the trading volatility.
1715.00s: And let's we could remove the account size in the hypothetical.
1720.00s: I feel like a lot of people that I've talked to about their relationship with volatility trading and myself specifically was I would try it.
1730.00s: But hedging would eat me up.
1732.00s: It was very expensive for me to hedge.
1735.00s: Now with a lot of brokerage firms not charging commissions.
1741.00s: Obviously that doesn't erase the bit asks spread and what you're going to eat there.
1744.00s: But I'm curious if that factors into your thoughts on retail traders dynamically hedging.
1751.00s: And if your thoughts on like an optimal hedging periods, I know you've talked about the delta bands before.
1758.00s: But I'm curious if the change in commission structure has changed your thoughts on, you know, what retail, what could be optimal for retail trader, obviously completely dependent on the individual trader.
1771.00s: Yeah. Okay. So I haven't done the actual numbers for this. So I'm guessing.
1778.00s: I don't think the elimination of the headline commission charge is going to be enough to do it.
1784.00s: Right.
1785.00s: You can ask spread in like for example, you know, $300 stocks going to have a dollar bit ask spread.
1791.00s: I mean, you know that and if you want to hedge, you are paying that spread.
1796.00s: Right.
1797.00s: I have this idea that well, I need to buy it. So buy it on the bed.
1800.00s: Now that's not hedging. Once you need to do a trade, you need to do the trade.
1805.00s: So you have to cross that spread.
1808.00s: The other thing that these a lot of zero commission brokerage houses have exorbitant margin rates, particularly on the short side.
1819.00s: And that that's a significant cost as well.
1823.00s: So I doubt that that's going to be a doable thing.
1830.00s: Well, I would recommend instead would be.
1834.00s: Here's one of your other problems.
1836.00s: Let's say you want to get short SPY volatility, right?
1840.00s: And I don't know where the SPY is right now. You know, so I don't know, three 70 or something.
1845.00s: So you sell the three 70s travel.
1848.00s: And then next week, the market's gone up to three 80s.
1853.00s: At this point, you don't have as much volatility exposure because you've gone away from the strike.
1858.00s: Right.
1859.00s: You also have Delta exposure because you've rallied.
1863.00s: So you would need to do a hedge.
1865.00s: What I would recommend doing is closing your three 70s travel and then re entering a three 80s.
1871.00s: So you've got volatility exposure again, which is what you want.
1875.00s: And you're hedge.
1877.00s: So you've actually sort of hedge the both components you want to you've got rid of the Delta component you didn't want and we put the whole component back on.
1885.00s: If you do that once a week, that won't eat you alive.
1889.00s: If you do that every day, again, that's going to become way too expensive.
1894.00s: So you have to allow for that kind of slow.
1898.00s: And one of the reasons that.
1901.00s: One of the reasons options of frustrating this, you could be completely right in order for cast and still lose money.
1907.00s: And not just in rare cases, I mean quite often.
1912.00s: Yeah, I the reason why I'm smiling so much is because when I first launched the YouTube channel.
1918.00s: I was on Reddit a lot just because it's a if you ever need a place to like toughen up your skin a little bit.
1924.00s: And it's a place to go.
1927.00s: And it's hilarious listening to all of the people on their bitching about the trade that did quote unquote what they knew it would obviously because they knew.
1937.00s: But they still lost money, you know, because of some other factor pertaining to options.
1941.00s: So yeah, I think that that's a pretty relatable circumstance.
1946.00s: And we're looking for VRP.
1949.00s: There's obviously different places to look again, not to give too much away from your books, because I will link to all of them in the video description, because I genuinely think people should read them.
1959.00s: I was telling you before we started your content is so easy for me to want to promote, because I do it already, because I legitimately believe in it.
1966.00s: I think it's awesome.
1968.00s: You talked a little bit about places where people can more consistently find it as compared to others.
1976.00s: I'm curious if that still remains the case. Obviously this year's a bit of an anomaly, but I think I recall reading about centralizing more indexes compared to equities outright stuff like that.
1991.00s: I'm curious if that's still about the case or if anything's changed there.
1994.00s: In the last few years have been a bit weird, but generally I haven't even if the last few years have been completely different, right?
2004.00s: I will take the evidence of previous hundred years over two.
2008.00s: I mean, that's just like if something's always worked and then it didn't work for a while, unless I know a fundamental reason for why there's been a shift.
2017.00s: I think you've got to take it, you've got to weigh the evidence. You know, I could be wrong, because things do change and maybe this was the change, but I'll bet that it wasn't.
2030.00s: So in general, if you're looking for a high variance premium, look for things indices have the best.
2040.00s: In general, things with a very steep volatility skew, either to the cause or over puts will have a variance premium.
2050.00s: If there's a situation where, I'll put this short, today's options have higher variance premiums.
2061.00s: Why? Because variance premiums are risk premium and short later options are more risky to be short.
2068.00s: So if you think, well, I'm going to sell the two year option, just don't bother. There's no risk premium and a two year option.
2076.00s: You can sell it if you like, but the chances of being significantly overvalued are pretty minimal.
2082.00s: I mean, I'd rather sell a two day option. So that's where you'd look. You look for short dates. You look for indices, you look for steep skews.
2093.00s: So there's a lot of classes of stocks that have even higher variance premiums, but you've got to do a lot of work to find them.
2099.00s: And that's not the sort of thing you really want to do as a rule of thumb. That's kind of like building model with, or my models got, I don't know now 12 variables and it was something.
2111.00s: Yeah, and it's funny you were talking a little bit about the Garch models before because when again, from from you, I kind of came across those different concepts.
2121.00s: And I was actually reading one of your papers on SSRN about the variance premiums. So I was like, you know, let me just tinker with this to see if I can even put something together.
2130.00s: I very quickly realized how much of a lift it would be to continually optimize one of those, at least for I'm an idiot, like I'm just happy to be sitting here, you know, like I don't have the same capacity that you do to keep those things up to date.
2147.00s: So I think with that as the backdrop, one of the ways I've heard people attempt to monitor the VRP is through essentially comparing IV implied volatility, not for you obviously for the listeners, IV to HV historic volatility and seeing how that gap is trending.
2169.00s: And that seems like a decent back of the napkin kind of easy way to go about it. But I'm curious your thoughts on that. Or if there is a more effective way for retail to kind of analyze those relationships.
2183.00s: You can do better than that, but it's almost certainly not worth the effort to you can what you're measuring there is what the circle ball has been, which is that looking to what implied ball is now, which is forward looking.
2199.00s: But if all you're doing is looking for broad cases where, you know, variance premiums, high or average or low. That will get you 90% of the way there.
2212.00s: I don't really think it's worth it unless you do it very well to do a real time series prediction model.
2221.00s: That's one of those situations. Honestly, you can't do that as well as me.
2226.00s: Like I'm not saying you couldn't, but you don't have the experience, you don't have the technology, you don't have, you just can't. By the time you've caught up, I'll be further ahead.
2236.00s: And I can't do it as well as Cisco, huh? So I really don't try and play that game either. You know, so that sort of time series, more than 20 years ago, yeah.
2251.00s: Big edge and just doing that. Now the market's sort of priced most of that in. So which is to on the downside, that means that edge isn't very well. But on the upside, it means you don't really have to do that work anymore.
2266.00s: You should look for circumstances now where things are going to be stretched for some sort of other reason, like visual action, there's an FLC meeting. The time series stuff, it's not as important as it was. So yeah.
2282.00s: I mean, honestly, I could lie, but most of the time I just do exactly what you've said. I say it complied 30 over the last 60 days, it's been 28.
2292.00s: But I mean, that's about as good as you need to be now.
2297.00s: Right. Yeah. I think it's, that's actually the on my super messy chart. That's the middle box I have there is just because I found it to be kind of an easy way to look at it.
2308.00s: When I think about placing different kinds of volatility based trades, I've tinkered with different ways to try to isolate exposure purely to volatility, like we've talked about a little bit before, potentially via hedging or trading volatility products in and of themselves.
2326.00s: I'm curious again for just a retail trader is there one of those scenarios that seems to make more sense again, just in general, whether it's selling straddles or strangles and then delta hedging or just trading the volatility product itself outright.
2344.00s: Well, different things, right. If you're trading vix futures, you're only trading the implied. Whereas if you're trading a straddle, you're trading the implied versus the real price. So they're all tied in together, but they're also slightly different.
2359.00s: Oh, here's a good rule of thumb. Everything in the volatility world's mean reversing, like everything, term structure, if it's out of whack, it's probably going to go back to where it has been skew same thing.
2372.00s: Variant premium same thing imply ball same thing. So it's a pretty good useful rule of thumb. So even if you don't do any other analysis, if you just look at where it is relative to its historical range, that's a pretty good place to start. Certainly on the sell side, it's very dangerous to buy volatility because you think it's cheap because it can easily stay cheap for three or four years.
2396.00s: So that is not you can decide to sell ball purely on the basis of stats. If you're going to buy ball, you need to have some sort of catalyst for why things are going to change.
2411.00s: But anyway, back to your question.
2416.00s: There's a couple of things retail do roll here and it comes down to not understanding where their edges. They think they can sell options and collect fatter.
2428.00s: Fatter is not an edge. Fatter is just a measurement of what will happen over time if nothing else happens. Well, you know what other things do happen. You move around.
2441.00s: So unless you have this price volatility, you will get that fatter. You'll collect the theta, but you'll lose because the market moves.
2450.00s: And actually, a black shows equation. It is exactly says, face of profits are canceled by gamma losses. That is the equation. So unless you have volatility edge, there's no reason to trade options.
2466.00s: But that idea of fatter leads to a couple of very dangerous things. The first one is selling strangles.
2476.00s: You can sell a strangle and be completely wrong about what volatility should be and still make money in enormous amount of the time.
2486.00s: Right.
2487.00s: So let's say I'm selling volume at 25%. This is, I'll give you real numbers. I did this recently. So remember them. I sell volume at 20%. I expect it to be 20.
2502.00s: So I've got five balls of edge.
2505.00s: And let's say it's actually 40. So I've made a horrific trade. If I sell a strangle after about 10 trades or 10 days or 10 periods.
2517.00s: I will probably have enough evidence to statistically tell me I've done something wrong. I'll probably actually see, you know what? I'm expecting an average P and L of X. It's why.
2529.00s: And the tea test tells me those things are different. And then evaluate. If you sell a strangle, it's quite easy for you to do 10 trades in a row and think you've made money.
2540.00s: And all you've done is you haven't seen that disastrous case pop up yet. You have me going to be a judge. It just hasn't been realized.
2549.00s: So strangles are dangerous as hell because they give you the wrong feedback.
2554.00s: You want to be told how you're doing. And think about it. Right. You are in the military.
2559.00s: Okay. Do you want to be told you're doing really well. You're going to grace. What do you want to be told the truth?
2566.00s: Absolutely.
2569.00s: Absolutely.
2572.00s: If you if you're friendly drill sergeants is telling everyone, oh, you guys are doing great.
2577.00s: You're just awesome. And you're not. That's the worst thing you can hear. And that's what a strangles life.
2583.00s: The other thing retail do terribly is they do combos.
2588.00s: So I wanted to ask about these.
2591.00s: For the problem is you are selling something because you have edge.
2597.00s: And then you're buying some other things.
2600.00s: You are.
2602.00s: You know, volatility is overpriced.
2605.00s: Since you know the stuff you're buying is overpriced. But worse than that, we're buying fire out of the money options, which are the most overpriced.
2615.00s: And you're taking you never have a huge edge in the market, right?
2620.00s: So I literally did this example this morning because I was riding a course.
2626.00s: I'm selling an SPY straddle.
2628.00s: I had $600 of expected value that I could make.
2632.00s: If I bought the wings that I would naturally buy if I was trying to hedge my downside, I'm reducing that to $260.
2641.00s: I'm having the amount of money I can make.
2644.00s: And all I've done is cat the losses. You have cat the losses.
2649.00s: But you're much better off.
2651.00s: First, if you have to only hedge the downside, because crashes up, they don't mean they could happen.
2661.00s: But the biggest S&P up move in the last 20 or 30 years has been like 7%.
2666.00s: There could be a 50% downward.
2670.00s: So don't hedge both sides and always realize hedges are the most expensive things you can do.
2678.00s: So if you have to do that hedge to stay in the game, it might not be a game you can whip.
2686.00s: Much better off, just trade it small enough.
2690.00s: So if there's some P goes to zero, I mean, you'll lose money, but you shouldn't like have to remalge your house or something.
2700.00s: Right, you're using size to control risk.
2703.00s: Size and diversification are much better risk control than hedges.
2707.00s: I mean, that sort of hedge is just so expensive that you're probably better off just.
2714.00s: You know, seriously, if that's what you have to do, probably shouldn't be playing.
2719.00s: That I'm honestly refreshed to hear you say that because a lot of things I see new options traders and myself included.
2727.00s: I'm one of these really fortunate people where I started trading very young.
2731.00s: And it's because somebody just recommended investing to me.
2734.00s: I had a single mom, so we had no money.
2736.00s: So I scraped together what I could.
2737.00s: Dude saw me working is like, you should check this out.
2739.00s: So I was like, okay, cool.
2740.00s: And when I started to find options, kind of like what you're talking about, I was like, oh, well, I want to sell a put in this, but I can't afford it.
2748.00s: So maybe I'll just do like a put spread.
2750.00s: And I feel like a lot of new options traders attempt to force their ability to trade by doing exactly what I did, unfortunately.
2760.00s: And long term, it just doesn't work out super well.
2763.00s: At least that was in my experience as soon as I can move away from them. I did.
2767.00s: I want to know your thoughts, though.
2769.00s: I've seen a lot of people.
2771.00s: I don't know if you've come across it anywhere, but there's a lot of a lot of talk about these zero DTE SPX spreads.
2779.00s: There's like entire communities that have formed around this idea.
2783.00s: And most of them deal with selling far out of the money spreads, either condors or put spreads.
2792.00s: But what they do on top of that is they include a stop.
2797.00s: So not only did they spread it off, but then they have a stop limit of some sort and very common figures were like, three times credit received something like that two times credit received.
2809.00s: I'm curious if you come across any of those kind of strategies and if so, what your thoughts were, if not, obviously, no, no problem.
2819.00s: Yeah. Okay.
2820.00s: So.
2822.00s: Very short data options like I see and have a lot of each.
2826.00s: I trade zero DTE stuff all the time.
2831.00s: And I don't want to sort of make a blanket statement about what these people are doing because I'm sure they've all got nuances and so forth.
2839.00s: But it sounds to me they're making at least three very common mistakes.
2843.00s: The first one is to do a strangle, which like I said, it gives you statistically terrible feedback.
2849.00s: And it makes it very hard to know if you're actually right or you've just haven't seen that downside yet.
2856.00s: Next, the doing the thing I said was bad, which is buying those wings, which is the most expensive thing you can do.
2864.00s: All hinges cost money.
2866.00s: If you think you've found a hedge that doesn't cost you money in some way, you've just misunderstood the situation.
2873.00s: Right.
2874.00s: And the thing I hate is this risk reward thing, the two to one risk reward or three to one.
2880.00s: It's a completely arbitrary thing.
2883.00s: And it's the sort of thing people will say, well, if I make three to one, I can't go bankrupt.
2888.00s: Well, I mean, you can if you lose enough time, it's right?
2891.00s: I mean, the three to one thing is just again, someone just made that up.
2896.00s: Right.
2897.00s: Unless you can give me statistics to show that that has a real basis and something.
2901.00s: That sort of thing makes me sort of, that's a big red flag.
2905.00s: Finally, there's nothing intrinsically terrible about using stops with options.
2911.00s: I mean, again, it's just just because our options doesn't mean you can't use stops.
2917.00s: But the idea of a stop, you're making a big assumption about the dynamics of the process.
2924.00s: Once you've hit a stop, you've already lost money.
2927.00s: That money's gone.
2930.00s: By doing a stop, you're telling me that because I have lost money in the past, I will now lose money in the future.
2937.00s: So you're telling me that there is a trending process going on.
2941.00s: Otherwise, who cares that you've lost money?
2944.00s: That's over.
2945.00s: Do you want to be in the trade now?
2948.00s: If you want to be in the trade now, stop in yourself hours the worst thing you can do.
2953.00s: And you're telling me that if you just walked in, this would be a good trade.
2958.00s: But because you've lost some money, you're now going to exit.
2961.00s: Makes no sense.
2963.00s: So by doing a stop, you're implicitly telling me you're dealing with a trending system.
2971.00s: Now, maybe you are, but maybe you're not.
2974.00s: And I think a lot of people automatically think that's this idea of let your profits run, stop your losses out.
2981.00s: And then there's a good thing.
2984.00s: The world's way more complicated than that.
2987.00s: If that's how you train a mean-reverting process, it's exactly the wrong way to do it.
2992.00s: If it's a trending process, sure.
2995.00s: But that should be based on the dynamics of the underlying, not just some arbitrary rule you pull at the top of it.
3002.00s: So this zero DTE thing they do may well have age.
3008.00s: So, I think that's the thing that makes it a little more public.
3011.00s: That's a good thing to have a big red clang.
3014.00s: It's interesting because, um, yeah, I tested them myself for a little bit out of curiosity.
3021.00s: And I found exactly what you would expect with a strategy like that very high win rate, but the losses were overwhelming, especially in the long run.
3032.00s: That leads me to, I have two final questions mostly just because I literally could talk
3037.08s: your ear off and I want to respect your time.
3039.68s: So the first to last question is, so when you're trading things like these zero DTE strategies,
3048.44s: whether it's a short straddle, whatever the case is, what kind of risk management approach
3054.80s: do you take with those?
3056.08s: Is it primarily sizing that you think, and again, this is thinking just from like the
3060.12s: retail perspective?
3062.60s: Do you think sizing is the right answer there or once things move a little bit, then you
3067.08s: start delta hedging?
3069.56s: The main thing I'm curious is with like the zero DTE overlay because I think that's an
3073.84s: interesting add-on to that kind of thought process.
3077.28s: I think realistically sizing is the only thing you can do.
3081.84s: And it's a very, it's a very poor risk management technique if you're only trading one thing
3088.52s: because you have to keep your size so small that you might not make enough money to make
3093.00s: it worthwhile.
3094.60s: And you know the most robust, trade sizing mechanism is make enough money that things are
3102.84s: worthwhile doing, but if you lose, it shouldn't be overwhelmingly bad.
3108.08s: And if you can't find that balance point, you probably shouldn't be doing that trade.
3113.68s: So if you're just trading one thing, that's the problem you're going to run into.
3120.56s: I trade equity options.
3122.24s: Right now I've probably got on 300 positions.
3125.48s: Yeah.
3126.48s: I hear that I had a stock last week, some piece of ploy attack garbage that went from something
3133.12s: like $30 down to $5.
3135.12s: Oh, perfect.
3136.12s: Obviously I lost.
3137.88s: I lost literally as much money as that position could have, because it went down below
3142.96s: the cash value.
3145.72s: And but I've got so many positions on when it took me like 20 minutes to even notice.
3151.28s: I mean, once I knew that I'd lost money, I could find out pretty easily why, but honestly
3156.76s: it was such a small paper cut in the big mousher films that were going on.
3160.80s: It didn't matter.
3161.80s: That's the sort of, that's where a bus, I think, risk management.
3165.40s: And that's sort of very difficult for retail to do.
3170.04s: So again, if you, this sounds discouraging and it is, but you might just have to accept
3178.36s: that as a retail person, you shouldn't be trading this based on that sizing rule.
3184.76s: Because that's really the only, it's the only real robust way you're going to have of
3191.20s: making money.
3192.20s: Unless you price it really well and can tell me, you know, I've got five balls of
3196.20s: energy in the money and I'm paying away half of all the edge of the wings.
3200.24s: Maybe, but if you're paying away the same amount of all terms on each one, long term is
3205.20s: not going to work, is it?
3206.76s: Right, right.
3207.76s: Yeah, I think that makes a ton of sense.
3210.56s: Last question I have for you is what is one question I should have asked you, but I didn't.
3219.04s: I think that's pretty, it's a pretty random question, I guess.
3226.88s: I don't even ask you one.
3229.40s: You're not really a Corvette family.
3231.84s: Oh, die hard.
3233.28s: I have, I have a 2016 C7 sit in the garage right now that I've been building for two
3240.72s: years.
3241.72s: It's actually funny because the Corvette is appealing to me.
3245.04s: I used to restore cars with my uncle and the first car that I ever worked on with him
3250.12s: was a 64 white Corvette stingray and it was so much fun.
3255.76s: So that's essentially what I have down there.
3257.16s: I have a thousand horsepower Corvette that can't stick on the road.
3261.00s: It's perfect.
3262.00s: Okay, so I have to say, I think the new Corvette is a real Mishmash ugly thing.
3270.32s: I think it's all like a rainbow car.
3272.44s: The C7 when it came out was magnificent, right?
3275.16s: It was like holy crap, what is that?
3278.20s: I really think the C3 Corvette might be one of the best five looking cars ever made.
3283.52s: I think that would be, look, if that was a Ferrari, people would say it was the best looking
3289.36s: car ever.
3290.36s: But there's a lot of snobbery about the Corvette, which I just kind of implicitly said.
3297.40s: But I don't hate Corvettes anyway.
3299.44s: And literally, I think the C3 is gorgeous.
3302.84s: But probably what's them is that are now 50 year old fiberglass car.
3308.88s: You can hear them drive down the street because all the squints, they weren't made brilliantly
3315.88s: when they were made.
3317.52s: And that was 50 years ago.
3319.08s: And fiberglass, even the fiberglass Ferrari's are pretty messed up now.
3324.56s: Yeah, you can only get so far, I think.
3329.00s: I completely agree with you on the CA, I get why they did it because in order to continue
3333.24s: competing with the pool that they want to compete with, you need the mid engine.
3337.84s: But I'm still more of a purist than that.
3340.12s: So I really like the front engine.
3342.60s: I was actually one of my other favorite cars as a Dodge Viper GTS.
3347.40s: So that's like more my general style is kind of the over, you know, VV 10 American muscle
3354.16s: style.
3355.16s: I'll just yeah, super addicted to them.
3357.60s: They're too much fun between that.
3358.84s: And I get my European stuff in the motorcycles.
3360.92s: Like I just sold it to Coddy Monster 1200 S, one of my favorite bikes.
3365.32s: So yeah, what if dream car anything you could have, what would it be?
3370.40s: Unless you really have it.
3372.16s: No, I've got like cars, I didn't intend to have a car collection, but when you've got
3379.24s: Italian cars, you've kind of meet a collection.
3381.24s: Otherwise, you don't have a car that works.
3385.32s: I think dream car are probably going for the Lancia straddles.
3390.44s: Again, if that inner Ferrari engine, if that was called a Ferrari straddles, that's a
3395.32s: five million dollar car.
3397.04s: So it's a real bargain, not almost impossible to drive because I've got like 70% weight on
3403.60s: the rear wheels and they've got a wheel base of like this one.
3409.40s: So it doesn't matter that I don't want to ever get one, but they that would be my dream
3414.48s: car.
3415.48s: I'm not loud.
3417.12s: I think they're super cool.
3418.48s: So I'm actually really fortunate.
3420.24s: I live really close right across actually from me as a neighborhood called Rancher Santa
3424.64s: Bay.
3425.64s: And there's a bunch of old rich people that live in there and they do like a cars and
3428.60s: coffee on the weekend.
3429.60s: And they have all sorts of stuff that they pull out.
3432.96s: That's a really good time.
3433.96s: I don't know if I've seen one of those there, but I'm not sure that that's super, super
3438.12s: common out here.
3439.12s: Is it or it's not super common anywhere.
3441.68s: They probably have two or three of the road going versions.
3445.60s: They were basically a race car or rally car.
3448.32s: Got it.
3449.32s: I mean, Lancia is used to just be incredible.
3451.12s: And now they're just a badge and low end fience, which is kind of sad.
3456.20s: I mean, it's a lot of these cool old companies are just badges.
3459.24s: Now Citruz are just badges.
3461.36s: Right.
3462.36s: They used to be one of the most innovative companies in the world.
3464.84s: So it will answer you.
3465.60s: And Sam, Sam doesn't live in existing world.
3467.88s: They were awesome.
3469.52s: I don't know.
3470.44s: They were good.
3471.28s: My buddy had one when I was in high school and he drove me once and had a moon roof and
3477.32s: the moon roof for whatever reason collected a shit ton of water.
3481.56s: And as soon as he went in reverse, all the water fell straight on my lap right before
3486.56s: school.
3487.56s: And I was like, what the fuck is this?
3489.12s: And he was like, Oh, yeah, it does that sometimes after it rains.
3491.76s: I was like, Oh, sick.
3493.32s: Love that feature.
3495.32s: A bunch of my cars do stuff like that.
3497.84s: You've just got to get used to it.
3499.12s: It's like if you can't handle that kind of stuff, I don't know, get a Porsche.
3506.48s: Right.
3507.00s: And you get a Porsche and you'll have a much more reliable car and you and 50,000 other
3513.40s: people that I see every week.
3515.48s: You know, if you're going to get a 40 year old car, you know, except the weird things
3519.12s: are going to happen.
3520.28s: That it comes with the water feature.
3521.88s: I completely agree.
3522.88s: Yes.
3523.36s: Totally fair.
3525.72s: Cool.
3526.00s: So we're pretty much that time.
3527.28s: I had one last question.
3528.28s: Now that I realize that you're a bit of a car guy and I'm curious.
3532.28s: I've been a Chicago twice.
3534.20s: I haven't been around the area too much.
3536.68s: Is there like good driving roads there?
3538.68s: That's actually one of the things that keeps me here in San Diego is the canyons.
3541.88s: I love the driving out here, but I don't know what it's like out there.
3544.88s: It's bad.
3546.00s: Yeah.
3547.28s: There are, if you drive like two and a half hours, you can get to the open of the Mississippi.
3553.68s: And there are some nice roads up and down the Mississippi.
3557.24s: But yeah, close.
3558.68s: No.
3559.16s: And the traffic that takes you an hour and a half to get out of Chicago is one of the problems.
3564.88s: So no, there's nothing.
3567.28s: Nothing good around here.
3569.76s: No.
3569.96s: Yeah.
3570.96s: Well, whenever you, whenever you come out to San Diego, well, we'll take the vet out and you'll see that it's no slouch.
3577.28s: And we'll drive around some of the canyons out here.
3579.08s: I think he would love it.
3579.96s: It's very fun.
3581.12s: I have driven around San Diego, but that's not in a particularly fun car.
3588.32s: Yeah.
3588.76s: Well, next time you come out this way, we'll change that.
3591.24s: There's some really, really beautiful roads up here like up Palomar Mountain, out to Big Bear.
3595.92s: There's some just gorgeous, gorgeous roads.
3597.88s: You just have to plan around the traffic.
3599.96s: San Diego, 100 pounds points.
3601.56s: It's amazing.
3602.92s: Yeah, that's an, I mean, even that there's depending on the route you take, there's some cool routes,
3608.88s: but there's also like some very boring routes.
3611.76s: But I think around Palm Springs, there's also some very fun drives up to, uh, I want.
3618.32s: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
3620.36s: Well, can be terrifying if there's snow.
3623.64s: Yes.
3624.16s: And especially because most Californians have some sort of car that does awful in the snow,
3628.76s: and they just come sliding down past you.
3630.64s: I've had that happen to me multiple times, very entertaining.
3634.52s: That's what I want to do.
3636.52s: Well, you and honestly, absolute pleasure to chat with you.
3640.32s: Um, I was a big fan before we spoke, but now that I know that you're a car guy, I'm a even bigger fan.
3645.16s: So sincerely, thank you for taking the time to chat with us, share some of your knowledge.
3649.84s: I'd love to have you back on at some point in time.
3652.00s: I think what you share is important because you don't sugarcoat things,
3656.68s: but you're not like a fatalist or something, you know, like you give people,
3661.20s: I think a very fair shake of things.
3663.72s: And I think that's important.
3664.76s: One of my favorite things to wrap us up is, you know, I heard you a lot of people think,
3669.76s: like, oh, my superpower is discipline.
3672.12s: And you know, you kind of frame that really well because you say, well,
3676.36s: if you execute a shitty strategy, not that you said shitty, but I'm paraphrasing,
3681.92s: um, if you execute a shitty strategy with utmost discipline,
3685.72s: the only thing you're going to do is lose money slowly and disciplined, you know,
3689.72s: so that's not like what's going to get people across the finish line.
3693.48s: And I think stuff like that is really refreshing to hear, because that's more or less,
3697.84s: I think people need real information.
3699.40s: So thank you so much, you know, for spending some time.
3702.00s: And for people that want to get a hold of you, I will link to your books in the video description below.
3707.64s: I like I said, I think they're great reads.
3709.04s: But where else can people find you?
3710.32s: Do you have, I know you're on Twitter newsletter or anything like that?
3713.88s: No, I'm basically just on Twitter at the moment.
3717.92s: I have a LinkedIn page, but I go to LinkedIn like once every six months.
3722.28s: So got it.
3723.20s: Twitter is the probably the easiest place.
3725.08s: And if you can't find me on Twitter, I mean, you're probably not going to benefit
3730.12s: from much or many other advice if you can't manage to find me.
3735.12s: Fair enough. Well, thank you so much.
3736.96s: I'll link to all those in the video description below.
3739.08s: And I look forward to catching up with you again in the future.
3742.28s: Thanks a lot. It was nice. Thanks.
