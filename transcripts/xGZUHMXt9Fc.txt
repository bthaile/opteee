0.00s: puts up outliers today. We're going to talk about applying military methods to options trading.
6.48s: Why would we do this? Well, that little OG over there, that's me and OCS officer candidate
12.56s: school. And I was a platoon sergeant reporting in my platoon for an inspection. This was the CEO
18.48s: of the installation. And the military has shaped a lot of who I am. And a lot of what I do in the
24.56s: markets is actually adaptations from what I've learned over my entire life. And a good bit
29.92s: of that was spent preparing and then being a marine officer. So I think for a lot of people,
36.40s: especially those that don't go into the military, there's a lot that we can learn to help others
42.16s: through their trading path that might not have had this same experience. Now it's way more than just,
48.80s: oh, being disciplined. That's like table stakes. You have to be disciplined to do just about
53.36s: anything decently well. So it's way more than that. And you'll see actually we're going to walk
60.08s: through seven core concepts. I'm going to give you seven examples for each one of those core concepts.
66.16s: And then I'm going to show you the civilian or the trading version of all of these core concepts
73.44s: on how you can lift the core concept, shift it to your paradigm as a trader to amplify what you're
81.44s: doing. So the first question is why even do this? Why am I bothering talking about any of this? Well,
86.72s: it's because if we take even a quick basic overview of markets, they are complex markets have a lot
96.32s: going on. Anytime that you have a really complex system, we use simplifying tools. It's because
102.16s: it helps our minds get our arms around the problem so that we can efficiently solve it. This is also
107.92s: why in any sort of science, you'll see that they make assumptions. Assumptions that they literally
113.52s: know are not factual, but the assumption helps them continue on the problem solving path. So this
120.64s: process of creating structure and a way of thinking about things is literally essential to your
127.12s: survival as a trader, because not only are you in a very competitive space, but you're in a competitive
132.96s: space with essentially zero structure provided around you. So we're going to find a lot of the
140.08s: concepts that we're going to talk about are really designed to help with that exact problem set.
144.32s: So the first core concept is that of preparation. In the military, we use things called TDGs,
151.92s: taxical decision games. The purpose of a TDG is to put you in a scenario. We paint a scenario,
158.00s: and then we say, boom, magic has happened. And you're now in this scenario. What are you going to do?
162.72s: Talk about it. Walk us through it. And we do this in a bunch of different ways. They can happen
167.68s: in a conversation. It can happen via a sand table exercise. We call those stexes. But the whole
173.84s: point behind this is that the first time you're seeing a problem should not be when the real problem
180.32s: exists. So you'll see how this translates beautifully into trading. You'll also see things like
186.80s: IPBs. This is where we want to actually gain intelligence on the battlefield before we go step
193.28s: on to it so that we kind of know what clothes should we bring? Is it going to be hot? It's going to be
197.44s: cold. Even down to what the weather is like, how does that impact our assets that we might use?
203.36s: All of these things in the preparation stage are designed to give us an idea of what we're doing,
209.28s: how we're facing things, how we're going to train our Marines or other forces to execute the job
216.08s: that's expected of them. And it's also understanding the enemy side of things. So the enemy side is
223.36s: really important in the light of trading. You can think of this in the context of other market
228.00s: participants, although they're not enemies, they are other participants that influence what we do.
233.36s: So how does this translate into being an actual trader? Well, you can start by studying. You can take
240.08s: some time to understand the landscape as it sets the reality as it is for traders. You can take
246.80s: the time to understand and prep the battlefield by knowing who's in it. What exists there? All of these
254.64s: preparation elements literally lend to understanding yourself, getting yourself trained and capable of
262.32s: doing a job. This is learning how to trade, understanding the endeavor that you're trying to
267.68s: undergo in the case of trading. We're trying to make money by applying ourselves to capital markets.
273.84s: But it's also understanding what other people's experiences have been in that same endeavor.
281.20s: So we can identify common failure points and then move around them. This preparation phase is
285.84s: probably one of the most important things you can do as a trader. This will lend into things like
289.76s: paper trading. It will lend into taking the time to understanding what we're trying to do. The
294.64s: only difference is from a military perspective, it's easy to take this shit seriously because you know
300.16s: you might die, even if you do it well, but the probability of you dying if you don't is really good.
306.80s: So you want to avoid that at all costs, obviously, and we want to be able to successfully do our job
312.16s: and come back and trading the stakes are nowhere near as high. So people regularly just kind of,
317.44s: throw them off, which is a giant next. Let's take a look at the planning process.
324.00s: Planning is essentially where we take the preparation phase. We combine all the skills,
329.68s: everything that we learned, and we start to create an actual concept of what we're going to try to do.
336.88s: So in the Marine Corps, we use something called McPepe, which is the Marine Corps planning process.
340.80s: It has these several steps, problem framing, co-development, co-war gaming, co-accomparrison,
346.72s: orders development, and the execution. And we literally can translate every single one of these
352.40s: into trading equivalent. So the whole point of this planning process is to take a really big
359.12s: broad problem and figure out how to break it down into consumable parts for analysis and then
365.60s: figure out what the best path forward is for us. So problem framing is guess what? What we did in
371.52s: preparation. That's where we conduct that analysis using things like SSRN to understanding the
379.44s: standard experience for a trader. This is where we grab a couple of books and we do a little bit of
384.88s: reading. And we understand what we're trying to do. We're trying to make money through trading.
391.20s: Co-development then is how do we think we're going to go about doing this? And this is where you
396.24s: can employ things like the outlier strategy process that I've built for you, the outlier trade
402.24s: process that I've built for you, how to paper trade as a active trader built that for you as well.
409.76s: How to create a trade checklist also have done that. The whole point is all of these different
414.80s: videos that I've created for your reference are designed to give you a framework to work off of.
421.92s: So the co-ed development helps us understand how we're going to try and accomplish this goal. Co-award
428.32s: gaming is when we take these different courses of action. I don't think I said that yet,
433.20s: co-ed is course of action. When we take all these different courses of action and we compare them
438.00s: against each other. So what you'll notice is in the outlier strategy process in step three. Let me
443.36s: grab it right here. You see where it says outline fitting structures identify how to make money from
448.88s: the profit mechanism, create a list of structures, test performance and analyze, identify the best fit
454.88s: for that profit mechanism. Guess what this is? This is co-award gaming. As I'm figuring out different
461.36s: structures that might be able to make money from a market effect, I'm going to compare them all
466.48s: and I'm going to pick the best one. That's literally this. These two steps, co-award gaming and
472.48s: comparison of the results. Orders development is effectively where we build our strategy. How are
480.48s: we going to run this process? And I have videos, like I mentioned, for literally all of these.
486.64s: So we'll throw links to those in the notes below. And the execution is doing the thing.
492.56s: So next up, we have ruthless objectivity. One of the coolest things about the military culture in
499.76s: general is nobody cares about your feelings. Actually really important. It's not that your feelings
508.56s: don't matter. And I say that partially in just because the military is actually really, really
513.36s: thoughtful about our people as much as we can be. But what we do not do is beat around the bush
520.72s: at all. Nobody has time for that. Grow some thicker skin. And anybody that's familiar with my channel,
527.04s: the way I interact with our people. Again, you can see artifacts from all of this in how I live
532.72s: my day-to-day life. And it's really important, though, because ruthless objectivity allows us to
540.00s: accurately identify things to make adjustments. What doesn't work well is if you can't decode and
546.56s: if you can't take actual criticism. So in the military, you'll see this come up through things
551.76s: like standards and culture. People in the military that we would deem fat by most normal people,
558.80s: most normal people like you guys were crazy to consider that fat. But in the Marine Corps,
563.60s: absolutely. We think that person's fat if they look like probably a normal person average.
569.76s: It's a way that we enforce a standard. And that culture is actually a good thing. And the last
576.32s: thing I'm going to mention here is healthy peer pressure. We always think peer pressure is bad.
580.24s: It's taught as a bad thing. It's not always bad. Peer pressure leads us to rise to a certain level
587.36s: of performance, of behavior, because that's what's expected of us by our peers. So from a trading
595.28s: equivalent of this step, this is where you conduct those ruthless, ruthless self-assessments.
602.72s: It's where you strip yourself bare to yourself and you analyze your decision making. And you don't
609.68s: give yourself out. Oh, I was impatient on that because of this and I won't do it again. No,
615.84s: you were impatient in that and you broke the rules. Bad. How can we fix it? The only way you can get
621.76s: to that level is if you actually call it what it is and you're accurate. So that self-assessment
628.24s: process, we use things like trade logs. The importance of a trade log is because it gives us
634.32s: quantitative feedback on what we're doing so that we don't have that disconnect between what we
641.60s: think we're doing and what we're actually doing. A great example of this is in the Marine Corps,
647.76s: you have physical standards. You have a PFT, physical fitness test, a CFT combat fitness test.
652.32s: You get grades for those. You go to the shooting range. You get a score on the rifle and pistol
659.28s: range. Those literally are your trade logs because they show you your performance and you have
664.08s: to look at them. They're part of your ability to grow within the organization. If you suck at any
670.00s: of them, you're not going to be around very long. So trade log is the exact equivalent of this
676.56s: for a trader because it gives you that direct feedback that you literally need in order to survive.
684.00s: Emotional regulation. This is where we start entering that layer of discipline. The things that we do
690.08s: in the Marine Corps are really simple and other surfaces do this exact same thing, which is stress
695.20s: inoculation training. The whole idea is we're trying to put you in the best comparative scenario that
702.64s: we possibly can to actually being on a battlefield. So that when you eventually end up on a battlefield,
709.04s: it's not your first time in anything even close to this. So the equivalent for this in trading
715.12s: is actually pretty simple. I think there are a few things you can do. The first one is slowly
722.80s: start with exposure therapy. Exposing yourself to the things that make you uncomfortable, not just
728.56s: in trading, but in general, because that starts to build some level of resilience. A really important
734.88s: thing I think applies in trading is paper trading. Now most people dismiss paper trading because
739.84s: it's not real money. It's not the same thing. And I always give this exact example. Man, I'm glad the
744.88s: military doesn't think we shouldn't train because we're not actually being shot at by an enemy.
750.64s: So we're not going to bother training. Mx zero fucking sense. The thing is we acknowledge training
757.52s: will never be the same thing as actually doing the job in completing missions against a adversary
767.20s: near peer is even more difficult. But we still do those steps because it helps us and we take it
773.36s: seriously as we can. If you take trading and paper trading very seriously, you literally get
781.20s: in on the mindset that this is your money. All of a sudden, it carries some weight because guess what?
787.60s: If you look at it, you're like, Oh, I can't take it seriously because it's not real money. It's
791.12s: gonna be as soon as you actually start trading with real money. Guess what? Now it's real money.
797.04s: So the idea is to get that same level of experience as much as you can before you make the jump to
803.20s: get all those stupid mistakes out of the way. The other thing I'll mention here is the whole life
808.56s: approach. The reason why I mentioned this whole life approach is actually because if you try to be
814.40s: disciplined in one thing and then not something else, it doesn't work that well. You kind of have
821.20s: to run these concepts across what you do. So even something like emotional regulation, if you get
827.84s: super happy and then super sad and you go through that cycle, not saying whether it's good or bad,
833.52s: but that doesn't work well in trading because that's where revenge trading starts coming in. That's
839.44s: where despair starts coming in. The way as a marine officer were trained is you're kind of supposed
845.20s: to be that even keel. That doesn't mean that you can't be happy. It doesn't mean that you can't be
849.28s: sad. But rather than having happy and sad movements like this, we try to have them like this so that
855.44s: there are a little more measured, tempered, less deviation from our standard disposition leads to
862.00s: better decision making adaptability. In the Marine Corps, we have a really, really fun saying adapt
867.84s: and overcome. And it's because that really becomes the way that you succeed in the military because
874.64s: the planning process is always funny because you go through all of these stages, you come through
880.32s: all of this analysis and then you start actually doing the thing and nothing happens the way you
885.04s: thought it was going to be. And Mike Tyson obviously is the fantastic quote, everybody's got a plan
889.84s: to they get punched in the mouth. That's a fantastic quote and it literally represents life.
895.52s: So then why do we go through planning? It's because the planning process itself is equally if not more
902.48s: valuable than the output of the planning. And going through that allows us to be way more adaptable
909.28s: because we're able to understand in the military, we call it a commander's intent. It's the ultimate
914.40s: thing that we're trying to accomplish in the trading world. The commander's intent is whatever
919.28s: your goals are as a trader and then decentralized execution is how do we actually attain that goal?
927.60s: Now in the military and also as a trader, we need to adapt a Bayesian style of thinking Bayesian
934.72s: analysis is where we update our understanding of things as new knowledge comes out. So one of the
942.48s: best possible ways you can be adaptable as a trader is you focus on the process in far less on
950.16s: the outcome. That's one of those really weird things that it sounds like means nothing, but it
955.60s: really is the way to find success long term as a trader. It's where you are less concerned with how
963.20s: each individual trade comes out in the wash and we focus so much more on executing a sound
971.76s: process because in the long run, your returns as a trader literally are a measurement of your
979.84s: ability to adhere and execute a sound process that's positively expected risk management.
987.20s: We use a lot of risk management in the military and it's because we do a lot of risky things.
992.32s: The main thing I want you to pay attention to from a military perspective to things. The first
998.32s: one is what we call operational risk management. We use something called a RAM, risk assessment matrix.
1009.20s: What we try to do is we have two columns. We have the probability of something occurring and then
1014.40s: the severity. That allows us to understand what kind of controls need to be put in place.
1020.16s: To put this in the context of a trader, if you're putting on a trade that has a very low probability,
1027.36s: but if that probability happens, it wipes out your account. Guess what? It still is important enough
1035.04s: that you have to manage it. The idea of a risk assessment matrix and this kind of process is we're
1042.40s: trying to frame risk in a way that we're not accepting unwarranted risks and that the risks that we
1049.92s: are accepting have a commensurate reward. The way that you can do that as a trader is literally
1055.44s: by developing your own RAM. You can use things like a trade checklist. You can employ portfolio
1061.52s: level circuit breakers, which I have an entire video that talks about all these risk management
1065.68s: approaches as a trader. We'll link to that below that you can then think through all of these
1070.80s: things at a time in a trade management plan and then avoid taking stupid risks that you don't
1076.72s: even know are there. That one time you sold puts on a company because it had IV and you didn't know
1081.60s: that had earnings coming out. That kind of thing. The last one after action reviews. You'll
1088.64s: absolutely have heard me refer to this before. It's called an AAR and we ask ourselves a few
1093.60s: questions. What was supposed to happen? What actually happened? Why did it happen? What can we do
1097.92s: better next time? Literally that exact thing applies to you as a trader. The way that I conduct
1104.48s: this AAR process is I think of it following individual trades. I conduct a weekly mini AAR,
1113.36s: look over the entire portfolio. I do a monthly deep AAR. It's typically like several hours,
1119.44s: three to four hours of combing through everything, identifying trends. Then every single year,
1125.04s: I have a holistic AAR that literally takes me almost two weeks that I go through everything I did.
1132.08s: But this process of conducting an AAR in a structured way leads to finding things that you can
1138.00s: employ smarter going forward. This is exactly how you apply military strategies and decision-making
1145.92s: to trading options. See you later.
