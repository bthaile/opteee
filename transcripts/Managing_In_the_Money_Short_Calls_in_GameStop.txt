0.68s: what is up the ape Community it is Eric
4.12s: and yet again I come in peace I'm here
5.60s: to talk about options I'm actually
6.92s: following up on a prior video that I did
9.72s: and actually kind of a minseries that
11.72s: I'm starting to do about trading options
15.40s: in something like GameStop although if
17.76s: you're not trading GameStop what I'm
19.72s: covering today is applicable to you
21.20s: anyways because what I'm going to talk
22.88s: about is adjusting in the money short
27.36s: calls which ideally that's what we want
30.04s: to happen if we're selling calls as part
33.60s: of a ratio covered call which is what we
35.92s: reviewed in the last video I'll throw a
37.96s: link to that in the description in case
39.92s: you haven't seen that the whole point of
42.16s: this strategy is we're going to hold
44.12s: shares of INE equity in this example
47.16s: GameStop and we want to hold the equity
49.84s: anyways that's the premise and then we
53.00s: are holding something longer term
54.88s: whatever your holding duration is is
56.60s: part of your plan but there are going to
59.16s: be periods where stock might be a little
61.68s: more mellow and we can see periods like
63.80s: that in this time frame right so we can
66.08s: see GameStop from really the middle
69.12s: slend of the summer until the 11th of
72.68s: November has been pretty range-bound so
75.32s: if you're holding Equity during that
76.92s: duration is not really doing a whole lot
78.72s: but you can sell some calls against some
81.28s: of your shares in order to collect some
83.64s: premium up front however as with
86.44s: anything in trading there's always a
87.56s: catch the catch in this instance is
90.72s: sooner or later the thing that you're
93.76s: selling calls in can start to move and
95.92s: it can start to move pretty fast that
98.16s: can create a problem especially if
99.60s: you're actually not wanting to unwind
102.36s: your shares which that's why we do it at
104.92s: a ratio so the prior video walks through
109.00s: the basis of this ratio covered call and
112.76s: how it strikes a balance between taking
114.72s: in some premium upfront but preserving
117.20s: upside especially in case things start
119.00s: to get out of hand things moving really
120.48s: really fast because it can happen you
122.56s: can get caught however especially in
125.92s: something like GameStop which is very
128.40s: peaky there are a lot of chances for you
131.56s: to adjust your trade so that you can
134.36s: keep your shares but still be able to
136.72s: sell some short calls to collect
138.68s: something and we actually went through
140.52s: an example during a prior live stream
142.96s: and I captured data from that that I'm
144.72s: going to review now and this is really
147.44s: to condense down all of the lessons of
149.44s: that life stream into a palatable format
151.84s: so that you can follow along the train
153.44s: of thought and then as always if you
154.56s: have questions as we go through this
156.48s: please let me know that's the whole
158.12s: point of this so if you'll recall we
161.76s: used the example of this date here the
165.76s: 16th of April why did we do that because
169.08s: I wanted to pick as
171.24s: disadvantage Point as humanly possible
174.32s: to start selling calls why is this so
176.68s: disadvantaged because the stock is at a
178.32s: low so that means everything past this
180.72s: point in hindsight the stock has been
182.68s: higher so we're selling short calls into
186.72s: what we now know in the future to be a
189.16s: very difficult time because it's just
190.64s: straight up especially into this short
193.68s: squeeze that we had so I thought this
196.92s: would provide a great example of how you
200.12s: can manage short calls in a very
202.72s: challenging environment because managing
204.80s: a short call in this kind of environment
206.68s: super easy it's been a slow gradual move
210.12s: up it's had some down ticks this is easy
213.36s: days to manage a short call this is
216.04s: challenging and the reason why this is
217.76s: so challenging is because when we get in
220.08s: the price of GameStop for the example
222.24s: was in like the 10 handle and then it's
225.88s: not seen that again it's essentially
227.64s: never been not double that so we're
230.28s: literally dealing with something where
231.84s: when we entered and started selling
233.32s: calls against it it is doubled in price
235.24s: and not come back which provides a
237.56s: really really great example Le for us to
241.08s: work through so this is the original
245.36s: video that I did about trading options
249.16s: in GameStop and this one obviously
251.56s: introduces the ratio covered call and
253.76s: then the video that we're in now is
255.24s: going to talk about the management I
257.24s: realize that I don't have the same exact
258.96s: shirt on but it's pretty damn close I
260.88s: also realize that my forehead is
262.96s: disgustingly shiny that's a little
265.20s: nerve-wracking but that stuff aside this
268.96s: is what we captur
270.40s: so I don't expect you to know what this
272.04s: is right out of the gate this is a very
273.72s: very basic log that I built for us to go
276.20s: through the example together so I'm
277.56s: going to describe to you what this is
279.12s: now so you can test it out for yourself
281.96s: that's the point now the entire premise
284.60s: of a ratio covered call is that you want
287.44s: to hold more than 100 shares you have to
290.48s: be able to create a ratio why does it
293.20s: have to be that because of this I will
296.68s: show you well actually I'm going to draw
297.96s: it for you because it's a little easier
299.88s: so if we have 100 shares our p&l graph
304.60s: will look like this with this well that
307.36s: let's see if I can get it at least a
309.24s: little stter than that something like
312.00s: that this is the zero
313.64s: line now when you have anything over
317.88s: well first let me just reset and do what
319.92s: if we sell a call against this so if you
321.68s: have 100
322.88s: shares and then you sell one call your
327.00s: pnl graph is now going to turn into this
330.16s: and you see that it levels off just
332.20s: pretend that these lines are level and
334.32s: that means that you now have capped
336.20s: profit potential anything above the
338.60s: strike of this call so what this can
341.88s: turn into though is provided that you
343.64s: have greater than 100 shares literally
345.84s: even 101 will do it anything greater
349.48s: than 100 shares it turns it into
354.24s: this where it still will maintain an
357.48s: upside profit potential because this one
360.12s: share is now not covered you have 100
363.24s: shares that are covered by this one
366.08s: short call cuz remember each short call
369.16s: represents up to -100 shares so these
371.92s: two cancel out that leaves your one
374.12s: share alone in unafraid out there to
377.28s: build profit for you so the name of the
380.12s: game there is to determine how many
382.20s: shares you want how many short calls you
384.00s: want and the prior video goes through
385.52s: all of that this video I want to
387.36s: specifically talk about the management
388.80s: of the short calls that's a tricky part
390.20s: of this game so if we think about
392.76s: selling short calls we first need to
395.48s: start with identifying the risks
398.08s: specifically in the context of selling
400.60s: short calls in something that we do not
404.28s: want to take assignment and meaning well
408.16s: we don't want to be assigned we kind of
410.40s: are forced on the cell side we don't
412.52s: want to be assigned meaning we want to
414.28s: keep our shares that's the first context
416.76s: so what are our risks well if the stock
420.92s: goes above our strike price and we're in
425.52s: here this technically is a risk this
428.76s: zone why is this why is this a risk it's
432.08s: an opportunity cost because if we have a
434.76s: stock that we're holding the downside
437.12s: risk for and it eventually makes a
439.80s: massive up move and we can't participate
443.36s: that means that we've taken all of this
445.48s: risk and we've not got the commensurate
448.24s: payoff for this risk
450.20s: so that can be part of your strategy it
452.00s: can be accepted it can be fine it's just
454.32s: a consideration that is an absolute
456.28s: opportunity cost I consider that a risk
458.24s: to the strategy the second risk in the
460.92s: context of you not wanting to let go of
462.72s: your shares is early assignment this is
465.04s: one we're going to have to pay attention
466.20s: to especially on something that tends to
470.68s: have really big moves now when are we at
475.28s: risk of early assignment there's two
478.48s: primary periods
480.28s: the first one is when extrinsic
485.48s: value is about zero and this really
489.88s: becomes more pertinent I would consider
492.48s: when it's less than a dime
495.00s: 0.10 and even that's a little high
497.32s: that's kind of like an early warning
498.72s: system when it's like sub a nickel is
500.88s: what I would consider to be
502.88s: moderately accessible but even then it's
505.44s: not
506.32s: entirely rational and we'll talk about
509.64s: why early
510.96s: assignment is not necessarily the
513.68s: biggest risk if it's managed but we have
515.80s: to manage it now the second period is if
519.40s: we have a dividend coming up and the
522.32s: dividend
524.72s: yield is greater than the extrinsic
529.24s: value so let's talk about these two
531.40s: scenarios really fast because if you're
534.40s: new to options this might make no sense
536.80s: to you and that's okay we will literally
538.60s: be able to describe
540.40s: all of it very very simply and what I
543.32s: want to do is actually go over to the
545.40s: platform and use some live examples
548.44s: because I think this might be a little
550.36s: easier if you can look at a live example
553.80s: with me so let's take a look at GameStop
556.48s: let's go to 13 DS and let's take a look
559.36s: at these options and if you'll recall
562.04s: every single option has two forms of its
566.04s: value that's what creates the premium of
568.32s: an option we have inance and extrinsic
570.12s: value intrinsic value is simply how far
573.00s: in the money something is extrinsic
575.84s: value is a composition of Time Value how
579.12s: much days how many days are left to
582.08s: expiration and then also
584.64s: volatility so if we have an option and
590.36s: let's say we look at this 25 strike just
592.44s: out of curiosity and we say the 25
595.00s: strike right now and we'll take a couple
597.20s: notes so that actually I can just do it
598.68s: right in here
599.96s: so we can look at it real together so we
602.68s: take a look at this 25 strike right here
604.96s: and let's say that we're short the 25
606.80s: call that is now pretty far in the money
608.28s: by like $4.50 that's the current
611.88s: premium spot price right now is well
614.40s: let's just call spot price
616.76s: 29 and we have a strike price of 25 so
620.56s: that means we have
623.92s: $4 of intrinsic
627.68s: value and the reason why I know it's $4
630.52s: of intrinsic values because our strike
632.12s: price is 25 the underlying is currently
634.72s: trading at 29 so the difference between
637.36s: those because this is a call and we're
639.28s: in the money intrinsic value then for
642.60s: the extrinsic value I just showed you
644.48s: that the option here is trading at a
646.08s: premium of 450 so if we have 450 less
650.64s: our intrinsic
653.56s: value gives us 50
656.84s: cents so this is how much x transic
660.24s: value is left in the
661.64s: options so even though these 25s are an
664.84s: 80 Delta they're pretty far in the money
666.44s: they're not actually at massive risk of
668.16s: early assignment right now why is that
671.04s: the case well first one as you'll recall
673.76s: there's not even a dividend here right
675.76s: we know that there's no dividend in
677.00s: GameStop right now so that's not a
679.60s: scenario we have to concern ourselves
681.44s: with now why not just early assignment
685.12s: because whoever's holding these options
686.92s: if they exercise well that means that
688.80s: they can get the they can buy the stock
690.44s: at 25 that's pretty awesome because
693.12s: otherwise if they bought it on the
694.20s: market it'd be at 29 why wouldn't they
696.52s: do that it's because they throw this
700.04s: away so let's take a look at the actual
702.36s: transactions as that as would occur so
706.92s: we have the option buyer the other side
709.56s: of your trade so they bought to open and
713.40s: they bought to open let's just use
715.04s: current price at450 or
717.96s: whatever so so they bought to open one
720.40s: at
721.12s: $4.50 so they paid a $450
725.28s: debit now they're like yo I want to
727.32s: exercise cool so then they hit the
729.40s: broker up and they say exercise my
731.72s: options so what's going to happen here
733.12s: is they're going to buy to
735.32s: open 100
737.48s: shares at their strike price of
740.40s: 25 so then this is going to cost them
744.20s: their 25 per times 100 oops decimals in
748.80s: the wrong spot for the this is in the
751.08s: wrong spot ignore that this is what
753.68s: they're going to pay out of pocket and
756.24s: when they do this this goes away this
759.32s: vanishes so right now they would have an
762.12s: unrealized
765.12s: profit of the difference between these
767.44s: two things which again is $400 it's the
769.92s: intrinsic value so what happened in this
773.00s: scenario is they just lost 50 bucks the
777.32s: reason why they lost 50 bucks is when
778.80s: they actually size they get to buy it at
780.72s: 25 they're going to pay 2500 bucks the
782.92s: stock is currently at 29 an unrealized
785.44s: gain of 400 bucks you capture the
787.84s: intrinsic value that's great but the
790.92s: extrinsic value is just gone you give
793.24s: that up so the more efficient
796.40s: transaction here for the option buyer is
800.00s: to sell to
801.52s: close and again we're just going to use
804.16s: current spot price but then they can
805.48s: sell to close at
807.88s: 450 no notice the difference in this
810.68s: scenario if they sell the option to
812.76s: close they literally make $50
815.60s: more it's otherwise the same thing so
818.92s: this is exactly why early exercise in
822.36s: general just doesn't make sense because
825.12s: you are just giving up extrinsic value
827.08s: the reason why all this detail matters
828.76s: is because you have to understand the
830.76s: counterparty to your trade what they're
832.60s: thinking what they might be doing what
834.04s: your risk might be because if you
835.64s: remember this is about managing in the
839.48s: short calls so as soon as your short
841.80s: call falls in the money it's not
844.12s: immediately at risk of early assignment
847.24s: and in the case of a dividend for those
849.32s: wondering the time that it makes sense
852.28s: is if the dividend is greater than this
855.20s: extrinsic value so if there's a stock
857.68s: that pays a dollar per
861.04s: share you would be better off exercising
864.96s: your option in this scenario and then
867.56s: you rate the dividend provided that it's
870.68s: by X div date which gives you an extra
873.24s: $100 because you have 100 shares so yes
876.52s: you throw this $50 away but then you net
880.72s: $50 extra so you'll cover that $50 loss
884.24s: with this $100 and then you make another
885.96s: 50 on top of it it makes you whole and
888.76s: you make a little bit more money so the
890.88s: time that this becomes at risk for early
893.40s: assignment with respect to something
894.64s: that is a dividend is if the dividend
898.16s: value is greater than your extrinsic
900.60s: value because then it makes sense for
902.48s: the holder to take the dividend provided
905.24s: nothing else is factored into the
907.00s: equation maybe they don't have the money
908.68s: to take the inventory maybe they don't
910.32s: want to deal with the drop after the
911.64s: dividend there's a million other things
913.76s: but this is the theoretical backdrop for
915.92s: it so now you should be able to answer
918.12s: the question of when are we at risk of
922.24s: early assignment and we're at risk of
924.64s: early assignment if there's very very
926.72s: little extrinsic value left meaning the
928.40s: person doesn't throwing it away or if
931.92s: there's a dividend coming up that's
934.20s: greater than the current extrinsic value
936.36s: of your short call so now we have those
938.60s: two scenarios great now we can talk
941.32s: about managing in the money short calls
943.24s: the reason why this matters so much
944.48s: especially in something that moves a lot
946.72s: is you have to know when you're at risk
948.68s: of losing your shares if you're trying
950.24s: to keep them now one giant caveat has to
953.56s: be made here this is why I use a ratio
959.16s: because you still could be assigned
961.28s: somebody can exercise even if it doesn't
963.56s: financially make sense it is their right
966.60s: to exercise whenever they want so you
969.08s: have to be prepared even in that highly
971.92s: unlikely scenario and it's highly
973.52s: unlikely it still could happen so what I
976.00s: would tell somebody is if you have long
977.92s: shares and you just don't want to let
979.64s: them go don't sell calls against them
981.72s: just don't do it because there is a risk
983.96s: even if we do all these things to
985.12s: mitigate it there is a risk structurally
988.60s: it's very very small but it's there so
991.20s: if you're in the camp don't want to let
992.40s: the shares go the same for you if you're
994.36s: in the camp like this scenario that
996.08s: we're talking about and we use the
998.28s: scenario of gaining entry on 16 April
1000.40s: when the stock was around 10 a half and
1002.56s: this person bought a th000 shares this
1004.56s: is a hypothetical scenario this was our
1006.60s: entry
1008.16s: trade so in this case we started on the
1012.12s: 16th of April with this position we sold
1016.16s: four of the 17 May 12 strik we collected
1020.44s: 4 this was the just starting scenario
1024.16s: that we begun with the stock at this
1026.52s: point was trading like 1030 it's just
1028.20s: because we were using on demand that's
1029.44s: why these aren't the exact same so what
1033.12s: happened after this first transaction on
1035.96s: the 23rd of April we ended up taking
1038.56s: this down for 21 cents and we made a
1042.12s: profit of
1043.48s: $96 so what we did at this point was buy
1047.48s: a handful of more Shar and really you
1050.00s: could argue that we should have done
1051.92s: nine shares I think yeah nine shares in
1053.92s: the to make all the numbers work out so
1057.00s: on the 23rd of April when we exited this
1059.88s: position and we made 96 bucks on the
1063.00s: same day technically it could it could
1065.80s: have been the same day towards the end
1066.88s: of the day or it could have been the
1067.80s: following day on the open but we bought
1070.08s: nine shares essentially taking the p&l
1072.40s: the realiz p&l from that trade and we
1074.64s: just bought more shares with it so we
1076.00s: added nine shares for 91 bucks so now
1079.16s: our total position is 1,09 shares this
1082.16s: is our total cost
1083.68s: 10,591 and then we have our total
1086.96s: composite basis which again is just
1088.76s: right around
1090.12s: 1050 so this was I just picked a spot to
1093.48s: start this obviously wasn't a challenged
1095.76s: position this thing had no issues
1097.24s: whatsoever this was in this time frame
1099.68s: in here but the next trade is where
1102.36s: things get spicy so on the 23rd of April
1106.16s: and we can go back to that day and On
1108.12s: Demand it'll take a second for it to
1109.88s: load but let's go back to the 23rd of
1112.84s: April here and I'll let that start to
1114.88s: load while we're there that's where we
1116.80s: took this down and that's where we
1118.24s: opened up our next trade and that was
1120.60s: another four lot of the 21 June 14s now
1124.04s: for 54 cents so notice a few things the
1126.28s: first thing is if you take a look we're
1129.00s: keeping a really healthy ratio we use an
1131.68s: example with a five lot we use an
1133.36s: example now with a four lot but the
1135.52s: whole point is if we have a four lot
1138.36s: that means we have 69 shares that are
1141.64s: uncovered so this means we still have
1143.64s: massive profit potential and we're only
1145.76s: using this to collect a few dollars up
1147.76s: front while we're waiting in this case
1149.52s: we're getting a $216 credit and again
1152.16s: this is under the context of the stock
1154.20s: is going down we don't really know that
1156.32s: there's going to be a massive squeeze if
1157.76s: we actually put ourselves in this
1159.40s: scenario I don't think anybody knew it
1161.80s: especially at this point there was no
1163.12s: sign in the options markets that
1164.44s: anything squirely was going
1166.76s: on none of that was there
1169.44s: so with all of that being said we can
1172.44s: rationally say okay let's try to sell
1175.88s: some calls make some money while this
1177.28s: thing is going down maybe we scoop up
1178.92s: some more shares because we like
1180.04s: GameStop we like the stock we think it's
1181.60s: going to go up so that's what we did we
1185.04s: have this position on now and we
1187.20s: literally can go into the options chain
1188.84s: together and take a look at it so we go
1190.28s: in here I think I said we did the 21
1192.84s: June why didn't we do the 17 May it's
1195.76s: because if you remember in the last
1197.16s: video we try to strike a balance with
1200.24s: the duration how much money we're making
1202.24s: how much time the trade has to work and
1203.76s: whatnot I purposely use the 59 days to
1206.44s: expiration to actually hamper myself
1209.32s: this makes this scenario more
1210.72s: challenging why does it make it more
1212.56s: challenging well it makes it more
1214.68s: challenging because there's so much time
1216.28s: left in these options you actually run
1218.24s: out of what I call expiration liquidity
1222.44s: so you notice here that there's an
1223.80s: expiration in 3 days then in 10 days so
1227.08s: there's a 7-Day difference here then a
1228.68s: 7-Day difference here then a 7-Day
1230.24s: difference here but then notice as you
1231.96s: go further out here it expands it's much
1234.96s: greater than a 7-Day difference between
1237.32s: these two and then between these two so
1239.60s: as you get further out in time there's
1241.76s: less expirations just because there's
1243.60s: less liquidity there's not as many
1244.92s: people trading that far out so we tend
1247.88s: to see centralized liquidity and
1249.36s: near-term expirations especially in
1251.12s: something like GameStop so this puts me
1253.52s: at a disadvantage because we actually
1255.52s: have a big move in this scenario shortly
1257.56s: after entry and this is all the way out
1259.40s: like 60 days to go this is about the max
1261.64s: that I would sell short calls unless
1264.12s: there's extraneous circumstances which
1265.60s: we'll talk about in a second so we come
1267.64s: in here and what did I say that we
1270.08s: picked we did the 14s for 54 cents they
1272.68s: might trade yeah so they're trading
1274.28s: right around there again the timing is
1276.12s: slightly different I'm using 0900
1277.88s: Pacific time I'm just picking something
1279.72s: so we'll just say that this is 54 cents
1281.68s: for the
1282.92s: example great so now let's fast forward
1286.04s: time because we can tell and know that
1289.20s: things start to get really spicy so
1291.32s: let's go fast forward a week and see
1294.32s: what happens so stock starts to Rally
1297.60s: now in my world of managing short calls
1300.64s: if the stock rallies like this I don't
1303.12s: really care I'm not even at my short
1305.00s: strike yet there's not a lot for me to
1306.88s: do so I'm not going to bother doing
1309.08s: anything now another admin note when it
1311.72s: comes to managing short calls one of the
1314.80s: best things or managing any short option
1317.32s: by the way one of the best times to roll
1320.40s: is when the strike price equals the
1324.20s: stock price when they're the same why is
1327.24s: that the case well it's
1330.08s: because if we take a
1332.52s: look let's go to the 17 DTE for the
1336.12s: example if we take a look at stock price
1340.24s: equals strike price meaning the at the
1342.12s: monies let's just call it the 11s these
1345.36s: 11s let's say that you sold the 11 call
1348.68s: s back when it was n so these were out
1350.28s: of the money and then they come at the
1352.68s: money this is showing you that
1355.60s: directionally you're wrong the stock is
1357.88s: moving now whether it sustains the move
1360.28s: we don't know but when an option is at
1363.68s: the money it is the point where it has
1365.88s: the most extrinsic value so there's a
1370.36s: part of natural traders that I like I
1372.36s: don't want to buy that back if I sold it
1374.88s: that doesn't make sense however as an
1378.56s: option goes further and further in the
1382.12s: money it gains more and more intrinsic
1386.52s: value and it has less and less extrinsic
1390.84s: value So when you buy back a really deep
1394.80s: in the money option you're buying back a
1397.68s: ton of intrinsic value that does not
1400.64s: Decay it's intrinsic so that means you
1403.32s: have to go really far out in time in
1406.24s: order to compensate
1408.88s: extrinsic value all of that intrinsic
1412.64s: value that you have to buy back so we'll
1416.20s: take a look at a couple examples that to
1417.96s: help the point settle in feel free to
1420.12s: listen to that one or two times through
1421.64s: if that sounds super weird but it has
1423.92s: everything to do with the constitution
1425.64s: of the price of the premium and how we
1428.52s: can manage it so again if you don't need
1430.48s: all those details suffice it to say you
1432.76s: will have the most amount of choices as
1436.12s: you're being challenged to roll your
1438.08s: option
1439.04s: when your when the strike price is
1441.92s: equivalent to the stock price give or
1443.88s: take doesn't have to be exactly but
1445.28s: close enough that's when extrinsic value
1447.48s: is the highest that's what ultimately
1449.40s: will Decay out of your option so if we
1452.52s: take a look let's say we had these six
1454.40s: calls there's like no extrinsic value
1456.28s: left let's say that they're trading for
1458.76s: $512 and I want to roll them it means if
1461.72s: I want to roll these for a credit I have
1463.28s: to get at least
1464.68s: $512 so where can I get $512 well if I
1468.40s: roll out to the seven Junes and I look
1470.56s: at the sixes can I get
1473.40s: $512 maybe the bid ass spread is so wide
1476.76s: because it's so far in the money unless
1478.68s: I can hit it at the midpoint I might not
1480.60s: be able to that's because it's so far in
1483.56s: the money I'm buying back so much
1485.96s: intrinsic value that my choices are
1488.64s: truly limited and notice how I can't get
1490.72s: any basis Improvement there's no way
1493.04s: that I'll be able to get these six and a
1494.56s: halfes again because of liquidity I need
1497.40s: to get at least 5 12 if I get filled
1499.28s: there the probability of me getting 515
1501.28s: on these and moving up half a point is
1502.84s: very low definitely can't get a point
1505.80s: Improvement because these are for $470
1507.72s: now let's take a look at another
1509.24s: scenario if we had the 11s the 11s fall
1511.88s: in the money you have to buy these back
1513.60s: for $15 so let's go out to that same
1516.20s: expiration and see where can we get a15
1518.68s: ah well we can get it here at the 13 we
1522.08s: can get $119 but notice the basis
1525.08s: Improvement we get we can move from an
1526.96s: 11 strike to a 13 strike I can move two
1529.68s: points away in the same time frame as
1532.52s: compared to the other scenario that I
1534.04s: would be lucky to move 50 cents so
1537.80s: that's how that relationship works and
1539.76s: it's a delicate balance between
1541.40s: expiration liquidity meaning if you go
1544.32s: too far out in time and then the move
1546.04s: just keeps happening you just have to
1547.96s: sit there and deal with it because you
1549.20s: can't keep rolling out forever you're
1550.56s: literally going to run out of expiration
1553.40s: Cycles to pick from so that's The
1556.52s: Balancing Act here so going back to this
1560.28s: we sell these and let's now fast forward
1564.76s: and get some time under our belt let's
1568.04s: go to the 7 May
1571.00s: expiration ah starts rallying here now
1576.92s: in reality If This Were my actual trade
1581.28s: I absolutely would roll it in one of
1583.96s: these three days there's no doubt in my
1585.76s: mind and it's for a Litany of different
1587.96s: reasons it's not because of I know
1589.80s: what's going to happen because obviously
1592.16s: I do but when you see this kind of
1594.68s: one-sided massive strength in something
1597.36s: that takes a pause that's a great time
1599.88s: to try to get an adjustment so let's
1601.84s: take a look at what we could have
1603.64s: adjusted for we're not going to because
1605.68s: I'm again trying to use a really
1608.04s: difficult scenario for the example so
1610.16s: I'm not giving myself the easier out
1612.56s: that I would take I'm just letting you
1614.60s: know that there's no way that I would
1616.24s: let it run through those 3 days and not
1617.84s: do something something with it so let's
1619.68s: see what these 21 June 14s are trading
1623.68s: for right now so the 21 June are still
1626.00s: 45 out 45 days out and these 14s are now
1629.76s: a do and a half in the money there's a
1631.72s: lot of extrinsic value left we could
1633.76s: take these in for
1636.12s: $3.90 the only choice you have is
1638.64s: rolling it out 73 days so if we go out
1641.68s: here and we see where can we get
1644.16s: $3.90 you can get it to the 15s
1648.92s: and this is the problem with waiting too
1650.40s: long because with this kind of move in
1652.80s: something like GameStop as this is
1654.72s: making these meteoric Rises volatility
1657.88s: is jacking up so everything is becoming
1661.12s: uniform more expensive so you might not
1663.28s: even be able to get your basis
1664.76s: adjustment if you're taking those in for
1666.08s: 390 to get your roll for a net credit
1668.96s: now you don't always have to get a net
1673.00s: credit to have a total positive roll
1675.28s: scenario so what does that mean let's
1676.88s: use a little bit of scratch paper over
1678.72s: here so on this trade we made 96 bucks
1681.72s: so let's throw in 96 and then here we
1685.12s: had
1686.92s: 54 cents so let's drop 54 cents
1692.52s: here and then we had what a four lot so
1696.20s: in this case we took in a credit of 216
1702.32s: * 100
1704.00s: to6 here so this is where we're at so
1708.28s: far so let's say we buy these back for
1711.04s: 387 let's see what happens in this
1713.68s: scenario this is what the other trade
1715.72s: made already so let's say we buy these
1718.92s: back now for $387 so
1724.72s: $387 so oh no I'm sorry I said
1728.36s: 390 and then these ones are for
1731.12s: 380 so in this scenario 390 so what's
1734.52s: our p&l here well it's this minus this
1738.52s: so we lose
1739.72s: $336 that's the net loss that we're
1742.04s: taking so realistically this is what we
1744.84s: need to make because we're just
1746.72s: essentially counting this 54 bucks that
1748.64s: we collected as the net credit and we're
1750.52s: just saying yeah okay maybe we just give
1753.48s: that back we're not counting that as
1755.08s: part of the total loss because that was
1757.16s: just a credit that was tied to an open
1758.68s: trade so this is what you actually need
1761.04s: to make and then if we take a look then
1764.40s: we have another four lot and we do it
1767.64s: for
1770.28s: $387 this is not a net credit you're shy
1773.96s: 3
1774.92s: C but in actuality you're still fine you
1779.36s: would make money so let's take a look at
1782.20s: this time 100 I'm just doing all of the
1786.08s: math out for you this times 100 so what
1790.44s: happens here you'll notice that even
1792.44s: though from 390 what we closed at to
1795.36s: selling to open the new ones at 380 Cent
1797.48s: uh 380 7 which is a 3C debit technically
1800.76s: between these you still actually have
1804.08s: collected enough once you include the
1805.88s: prior credit you received here and then
1807.80s: the prior p&l of the original call now
1809.76s: you don't have to include this because
1811.12s: we put this in stock technically this is
1813.12s: gone but I just want to make sure when
1815.84s: people say like you always have to roll
1817.40s: for a net credit you don't actually have
1819.00s: to you just have to track your math
1821.28s: really well and in this case you would
1823.12s: be fine in this hypothetical scenario
1825.28s: but let us continue beyond this because
1827.72s: for for the sake of the scenario we did
1829.52s: not do that we literally waited until
1831.92s: the last moment that we could which
1834.32s: would have been on the 13th of May the
1837.52s: reason why the 13th of May was the last
1839.48s: moment you'll
1843.76s: see big giant move big giant
1849.00s: move and now if we take a look at our 21
1852.80s: Junes and we have the 14s let's take a
1856.48s: look at these 14s you'll notice a really
1859.24s: important detail now we are running
1863.20s: really really fast out of extrinsic
1866.00s: value really fast these have gone so far
1869.16s: in the money they're at an 86 Delta
1871.96s: they're essentially $15 in the money so
1875.96s: right now there's maybe a dollar and
1877.60s: change left of extrinsic value so you
1880.68s: don't have to you know that you don't
1882.52s: have to take these down yet there's
1884.20s: enough value in them to be okay but I
1886.92s: think what we did in this scenario on
1888.48s: the other live stream is we actually
1890.80s: looked at it early in the morning
1892.92s: because early in the morning it was even
1896.08s: higher uh not yet so maybe we have to go
1898.96s: to like 7:30 let's try that I'm just
1901.88s: eyeballing the price here yeah something
1903.68s: like this I think we're close to forgot
1907.52s: exactly what time it hit that it's
1909.00s: obviously sometime between 7:30 and
1911.64s: 6:30 but what I did for the example is I
1914.28s: made it so that we like this right here
1916.12s: we we're very close to the very top so
1918.32s: right now the spot price is not 29 it'll
1920.40s: be like 36 so these will be even worse
1923.92s: once this buffers which we'll see in a
1927.24s: second and this is why you have to pay
1929.68s: attention to the amount of extrinsic
1931.08s: value and then the risk of early
1933.08s: assignment because the other scenario
1934.48s: that's going on here is people are going
1937.04s: to be clambering to get shares if they
1939.36s: think that this is another full-on short
1941.08s: squeeze because that can be catastrophic
1942.96s: as we know so the risk of early
1945.68s: assignment will go up even more as
1948.08s: volatility starts to crack off so in
1950.32s: this scenario you can see that it hit a
1951.76s: peak of like
1953.96s: 2305 of in just overall cost and of that
1960.16s: it's $21 in the money so there's still
1962.96s: extrinsic value but a lot it's just it's
1966.12s: buried right now so that's why in this
1968.48s: scenario we actually waited a little bit
1971.32s: we waited as the stock came down to 2593
1974.40s: it was a random spot that we picked and
1975.88s: we closed it for $15
1978.88s: 45 this represents a $
1982.24s: 5,964 loss big loss what I try to tell
1985.28s: people is when you're trading this kind
1986.44s: of strategy you have to have patience
1988.00s: because that's the way that this works
1989.40s: in the long run we're taking losses
1991.52s: upfront we're realizing losses upfront
1994.96s: but as long as we are capable of
1998.20s: continuing to roll and adjust the trade
2000.24s: and or eventually letting the shares get
2002.68s: called away then we can ultimately make
2006.68s: money how does that process work let's
2009.12s: take a look at kind of the the rest of
2011.28s: the way that this goes so somebody said
2014.12s: uh I think before I forgot we looked at
2016.48s: an example in the in the live stream
2019.68s: where somebody said something about well
2022.36s: this is only because the stock didn't
2024.36s: keep going up or something like that and
2026.04s: it's a great point so let's say that
2028.32s: GameStop actually maintained this
2030.32s: meteoric rise and you were in the very
2033.72s: very rare but possible scenario that you
2036.56s: just couldn't roll so let's pretend all
2039.24s: of this isn't
2040.96s: here and let's say that you originally
2043.72s: sold this for 54 and let's say that in
2046.32s: order to close this here let's say that
2048.44s: this was like 30 so this would have been
2050.28s: a massive amount of money in order for
2052.60s: you to close so instead of $15 it's
2055.36s: double that so instead of it costing a
2057.80s: $6,000 debit it's like a 13,000 with the
2061.36s: rest of the change added in so like a
2062.88s: $113,000 debit something like that just
2065.08s: a massive amount of money to close and
2066.96s: let's just say that the stock stop kept
2068.08s: going up and there was no point to roll
2070.84s: well that's when you have to be prepared
2072.44s: to part with the shares and that's why
2074.60s: we do it at a lower amount because even
2077.12s: though that you're unwinding some of
2079.24s: your shares at this point 400 of them
2081.56s: you're going to make a killing because
2082.80s: you got in for 10 and a half and in the
2084.96s: scenario that we're talking about here
2086.40s: maybe it's at like 60 the stock so you'd
2088.72s: make a ton of money and more importantly
2091.56s: you always have that exit window of just
2093.88s: let it just let it get assigned just let
2095.56s: it be done because let's use one other
2098.80s: scenario let's say you completed that
2100.52s: first roll and then you were like okay
2104.40s: this this isn't working anymore let's
2105.92s: say we're in this scenario now and what
2108.76s: I'm trying to show you is that you
2110.32s: always have that exit so in this
2113.76s: scenario
2115.44s: we sold the first for 45 bought it back
2118.40s: for 21 we made 96 bucks then we sold for
2124.68s: 54 bought it back for $15.45 we lost
2129.80s: $6,000 about and we're like okay this is
2133.36s: getting rough one thing you'll notice is
2136.32s: that I actually increase the lot size we
2139.84s: go from four to six why do we do that
2143.12s: it's so that we can get a basis
2145.36s: adjustment as I showed you in that other
2147.64s: example trying to roll the sixes once
2149.72s: they fall so far in the money and
2151.48s: there's so little extrinsic value it's
2153.20s: very difficult to get anything back out
2155.60s: of these without adding a little bit
2157.28s: more risk risk now what's the drawback
2159.68s: the drawback is now instead of having
2162.64s: 200 shares you have 200 more shares
2164.76s: covered here you go from 4 to 6 so you
2166.84s: have to be prepared to run this all the
2168.28s: way through either through management or
2171.08s: acknowledging at some point that you The
2172.76s: Jig Is up and you're going to have to
2174.16s: let now this new number of shares go if
2176.36s: you're uncomfortable with that you
2178.20s: either take the exit here or you just
2180.20s: try to roll out and not improve your
2182.40s: basis or you go out further in time like
2184.76s: there's other choices available to you
2186.64s: this is a slightly more aggressive
2188.28s: approach but it's designed to get us out
2190.08s: of trouble faster you have to have the
2191.96s: stomach for it that's all there is to it
2193.44s: and again if you're uncomfortable with
2194.64s: that don't do it you don't have to do it
2196.92s: but in this case I'm able to improve my
2198.68s: basis by a dollar even though the stock
2200.60s: has gone up
2202.00s: 60% from when I first entered this
2204.60s: position so this is a massive win to be
2207.20s: able to make this kind of adjustment but
2209.40s: all that aside let's say after that
2212.16s: adjustment let's just pretend that this
2213.88s: scenario didn't happen where we exited
2216.28s: and let's say that the stock just kept
2218.48s: flying up it was just absolutely
2221.52s: skyrocketing up well here's what happens
2225.20s: if that occurs and let's say that you
2228.00s: had this six out so you would have your
2232.24s: 600 shares that you have for
2235.28s: 10.5 you would sell to close 600 of
2240.08s: those and you would do it at
2243.72s: $15 and then you would keep the entire
2246.96s: premium
2248.08s: so in this case you would keep the
2249.76s: credit of
2251.68s: $69.90 so if you look at the $699 $69.90
2255.68s: credit that you got plus the prior
2259.12s: loss of
2262.48s: 5964 plus the prior win of 96 you'll
2266.40s: notice that you still come out ahead you
2267.84s: still made
2268.76s: money so what I'm showing you is that
2271.12s: there's always an exit if you're rolling
2274.12s: something you're rolling something it's
2275.60s: keeping it going against you on the call
2277.60s: side you have the shares and you're just
2280.04s: tired of trying to roll and adjust it
2281.88s: you have an exit that's profitable you
2284.32s: might be upset about it because you're
2285.56s: like well I'm selling them at 15
2287.76s: when right now they're trading at 60
2289.60s: that does suck but again you still have
2293.04s: another 400 shares that you got at 10
2295.12s: and a half that are now trading at 60
2296.64s: that's pretty
2297.52s: cool but if you take a look at the rest
2300.24s: of this example we are actually able to
2302.56s: maneuver through it so to fast forward
2306.68s: through the rest of
2307.96s: this what we ended up doing was just
2310.76s: clawing our way back slowly so you can
2313.72s: see we had the 15 strike out in 19 July
2317.60s: we had six of those we got those sold
2319.76s: for 1165 and again you'll notice that
2323.28s: this is not a total credit here because
2327.00s: we closed these at1 1545 but we sold
2329.40s: these for $165 how does this make sense
2332.12s: it's because we sold more of them so if
2335.36s: you take a look at the total
2339.24s: credit net credit here in this case the
2341.64s: way that I kind of track the math this
2343.92s: is taking the total p&l of 5964 as long
2348.36s: as I take in more than
2351.68s: 5964 on this next trade I'm good that's
2356.12s: all I need so in this case because I'm
2358.64s: selling more that allows me to have a
2362.72s: credit even though it's a lower premium
2365.28s: and even though I'm able to move the
2366.72s: basis by it that overwhelms the prior
2369.96s: p&l realized p&l so we continue this
2373.76s: process from 16 April or 16 April 23
2378.00s: April 13 May 19 June or July 23 July
2382.24s: five Aug 30 sep and then 11 November is
2386.00s: when we're finally able to exit this is
2388.44s: when we're essentially in total profit
2391.16s: like we've made money we're at no risk
2394.28s: anymore we're we're good to just
2395.96s: continue the process
2397.84s: as per usual so essentially from this
2401.72s: point on in 23 July is when we were able
2404.12s: to get this flattened out so that we
2406.36s: were down 15 bucks flat and then we were
2409.88s: able to just run standard programming
2411.80s: from there we can either maintain the
2413.56s: size if we want we can scale the size
2416.12s: down like we did here so that we don't
2419.20s: have as many shares covered but you'll
2420.76s: notice that I strategically use
2422.88s: increasing the share sizes to give me
2425.60s: bigger basis adjustments
2428.24s: it's a slightly more aggressive approach
2430.24s: so this is the game that we play here
2433.76s: now one other thing I want to mention to
2435.12s: you is this little break even
2436.88s: requirement sometimes people don't
2438.80s: understand like let's say we're in this
2441.24s: scenario here let's say we just realized
2444.04s: the loss of 5,964 bucks and we came in
2448.40s: here and we sold six of the 19 July 15s
2450.68s: for
2451.52s: 1165 this up here tells me what I need
2456.44s: this premium to be trading at in order
2458.52s: to hit a break even that's what this
2461.28s: tells me so for
2464.00s: example we have the 1165 I just pull the
2467.08s: data out here we pull the 11 65s times
2470.40s: the six slot we weigh that against the
2474.60s: realized p&l leading into it and this is
2477.24s: using the total p&l we can use whatever
2479.72s: p&l that we want this tells me that I
2482.36s: need these
2483.48s: 1165 or the the 15 strike 19 July that I
2488.76s: sold for $165 I need those to be trading
2492.04s: at
2493.68s: $187 in order for this to be a break
2497.44s: even trade and I'll show you exactly
2499.00s: what it looks like just so that it's
2500.16s: clear I know that might sound weird so
2502.48s: I'll move this out of the way so that
2503.64s: there's no noise so what I'm doing is
2505.60s: I'm taking the p&l from the prior two
2508.80s: trades and again we don't have to take
2510.44s: this we can get rid of that we can just
2512.24s: say that we want to use this the 5964 so
2514.92s: let's do that minus 59 964 and we're
2518.72s: doing that because we're saying will we
2520.32s: put this into more shares so this isn't
2522.60s: even there so 5964 in this case we have
2528.20s: that role that we talked about six of
2530.92s: these 15 19 July we sold them for $165
2534.88s: we need them to be trading at
2537.00s: $1.71 in order for these two trades
2540.80s: essentially to cancel out so let's try
2542.76s: that so let's type in $1.71 Let's
2544.92s: Pretend that's where we closed and
2548.08s: voila notice how the sum is now zero so
2552.08s: if you're curious how to calculate this
2555.28s: all I'm doing is taking the relationship
2559.56s: well let me see if I get this out of the
2560.52s: way taking the relationship between the
2562.84s: realized p&l of whatever I'm trying to
2565.84s: overcome and I'm taking that against the
2570.64s: lot size and the premium for an adjusted
2573.64s: net credit for the other trade so let's
2575.16s: work through it literally step by step
2577.24s: I'm taking the lot size times the
2579.36s: premium for the RO trade that gives me
2581.76s: again what I call an adjusted net credit
2584.32s: I'm adding that to the loss from the
2586.64s: prior trade divided by 100 it kind of
2588.92s: puts it in a perlop
2590.60s: basis or in a standard options contract
2593.32s: basis and then I divide the whole thing
2595.32s: by the number of lots so that I know
2598.36s: exactly what I need each single contract
2602.00s: to be trading at because again when you
2603.40s: look at an options chain it's not going
2605.36s: to show the options chain in the context
2606.92s: of VI having six Lots it's going to show
2608.56s: it in one lot instances so that's what
2610.76s: that does so I know that's a lot but I
2614.28s: hope it's helpful as always we can go
2616.36s: further into detail on this we can talk
2618.84s: some other techniques if you'd like or
2620.68s: we can move on to the next strategy I
2623.12s: have in the docket for us which is a
2625.72s: ratio called diagonal that I think fits
2628.08s: into this thing very well as well
2630.08s: although a slightly different use case a
2631.60s: little more active of a management
2633.92s: approach so that's the game plan using
2635.80s: GameStop is a really fun example to talk
2637.72s: through these things uh these are my
2639.44s: strategies this is essentially what I do
2640.88s: so this is the ratio covered call
2644.08s: element of a coverage strangle which
2646.00s: always goes together for me so let me
2648.32s: know if you have any questions be an
2649.36s: outlier I'll see you later
