0.84s: another crazy day in GameStop we had
3.88s: tons of call volume we have volatility
7.20s: moving around and then player two has
9.52s: entered the chat with roring Kitty
11.56s: coming back with this tweet of this dog
15.32s: Emoji this came out at 10:00 a.m. today
17.84s: kicking off a pretty interesting move to
20.64s: say the least in chewy that we'll take a
22.44s: look at and this is another instance
24.84s: actually where my option scans picked up
27.56s: the move so then I was like what's going
29.24s: on in chewy I played it today because
31.84s: how could you not on the movement but
34.32s: then I was wondering what was going on
36.28s: and then I came across this tweet a
37.68s: little bit later and it all kind of made
41.04s: a little bit more sense now let's start
44.44s: with a quick recap because we haven't
46.72s: heard from roaring Kitty in a while his
48.72s: last tweet was on 17th of June and then
51.84s: today we had this this I do not know the
55.08s: lore behind and as you guys know I am
56.80s: here to keep it a buck I'm not going to
58.16s: talk about stuff that I don't know I
60.08s: know about options and trading you guys
62.04s: know way more about the background
63.84s: behind all of these things I just have
65.68s: peripheral information so my current
68.96s: understanding is that this is a dog
71.44s: emoji that they replaced he replaced the
74.44s: eyes with these green eyes so that's a
76.60s: purposeful move as compared to the
78.44s: standard eyes that the normal Emoji has
81.48s: and this color apparently lines up very
83.84s: very close to chewy brand colors I think
86.80s: somebody held up The Hex code side by
88.96s: side and it was was off by like one
90.68s: character so very very close to that now
93.96s: people are speculating if that means
95.96s: something about chewy if that just is
98.40s: kind of the next Emoji I guess in a
101.04s: cycle of emojis that roaring Kitty has
103.12s: shared in kind of this long stage of
105.64s: them again you guys would know way more
107.84s: than me I would love any information you
110.16s: guys have throw it in the comments but
112.56s: that's about my guess as far as I can
114.84s: see from this so far you know way more
116.60s: than I do so off of that though my boy
119.48s: Ras a man was saying can't wait to make
122.64s: a video in terms of raring Kitty's New
124.84s: Meme which is kind of this and then the
126.60s: craziness with Chewy which yeah I think
129.52s: craziness is a great way to describe it
131.60s: so we'll take a look at that in just a
134.56s: moment before we get into chewy let's
137.04s: take a look at GameStop what happened
138.36s: between yesterday and today well
140.44s: yesterday we had lower volatility still
143.28s: had over
144.88s: 200,000 call options
147.32s: transact big big movement but volatility
150.68s: suppression some bumps in the chains but
154.12s: nothing super crazy take a look at today
158.08s: over
159.40s: 400,000 call options traded today now my
162.48s: guess is when I look at this which I
164.28s: haven't looked at it yet but when I look
166.08s: at this I'm expecting to see a few
167.92s: things that we can probably dig into a
170.36s: little bit further in terms of what's
173.00s: going on with this activity the put
174.84s: volume also spiked a lot it doubled from
177.96s: what it was yesterday but it pales in
180.40s: comparison to the call volume so with
183.20s: that let's take a look not at chewy yet
186.64s: although we will look at chewy and let's
188.68s: get over here to GameStop and if we come
191.84s: into the product itself and we poke
195.04s: around the first thing I notice is take
197.96s: a look at the number of calls that
200.80s: transacted at the ask or above what does
204.52s: this mean these are calls that were
207.08s: purchased which is a lot there's a lot
210.48s: of calls that were purchased today so if
212.04s: we open up time in sales I wanted to see
215.96s: where we're seeing this activity kind of
217.96s: building off the video from yesterday
219.60s: where I recapped most of the primary
222.92s: GameStop options volume for this entire
225.16s: month now I'm looking specifically today
227.92s: I'm limiting bu things that are at least
230.36s: 250 size or higher and since there's
232.84s: quite a few of them I actually think we
234.96s: can bump this up to kind of my typical
236.64s: filter which would be at least 500 and
238.80s: the reason why I like 500 is that that's
240.32s: when it starts to become a meaningful
241.80s: position 250 is not small but it's also
244.68s: not super large and let's see where
247.80s: we're seeing this activity these are the
250.60s: two biggest trades so we'll kind of
252.12s: catch them when we get down in here but
254.44s: I see in 12 July the 30s had 500 move
259.20s: which is pretty big and those are
260.96s: slightly out of the money we'll take a
262.48s: look at those in the second we can skip
264.56s: over the puts those are just people
266.08s: hoping this thing goes down like a bunch
267.56s: of haters actually let me see
270.56s: uh yeah they're at the bid so there's
273.44s: actually a lot of people selling puts
275.28s: that's great so that's more people that
277.04s: wanted to go up hoay when we look at
280.48s: this 30 calls 997 here so I see 30 calls
285.00s: here I see 30 calls
287.84s: here that looks like it for the 30 calls
291.56s: that's not an insignificant size
293.32s: somebody paid a lot compared to the
296.44s: other person they got 500 for 160 they
298.72s: got 1,000 essentially for 210 which is
301.08s: not ideal then taking a look at these 24
304.40s: calls there's 650 of those out in 26th
307.88s: July and then
311.00s: in 5 July we had somebody building a
315.00s: very clear 262 position the reason why I
318.28s: know that this is very clear is take a
319.76s: look at the execution time on all of
321.56s: these 10 this is Pacific Time 10630 same
325.04s: time but this is a series of orders that
328.04s: went through not all at once so it got
330.84s: chunked up a little bit is what I'm
332.68s: gathering from here so I see uh this is
337.32s: interesting position to me we'll take a
338.64s: look at this the reason why this is
339.72s: interesting is the 26 and a half strike
341.60s: selection is is very interesting to me
343.84s: because most people that are more
345.32s: sophisticated Traders trying to put on
347.04s: meaningful size positions won't go to
349.40s: these half strikes because they're
350.84s: typically not as liquid and again my
354.28s: guess is if we check those out now let's
355.84s: go to the five
357.08s: ju and we go to those halves was it 26
360.08s: and halfs I already forgot got the
362.08s: memory of a goldfish 26 and a
365.52s: hals that's a pretty wide
368.32s: Market that's a really wide Market I
371.36s: don't understand that strike selection I
373.20s: really don't because take a look at this
375.00s: the 26 and a halfes they're bid at 115
378.16s: offered at 135 again I I've told you
380.88s: guys this a million times but it's worth
382.44s: reiterating you will almost always find
386.12s: that these weird strikes half strikes
388.20s: quarter strikes are going to have l
389.76s: liquidity than the whole strikes people
391.92s: kind of navigate to the same places and
394.52s: you can see this across the board look
396.56s: on the put side these
399.12s: 25 puts these are 11 cents wide the 24
403.68s: and halfs are much wider than that 16
406.76s: cents so it's the same thing on this
409.76s: side if we look at these 26s these are 6
412.88s: cents wide at 46 Delta and then the 27s
416.56s: were 4 cents wide but for whatever
418.52s: reason we picked these and I I really
422.52s: don't know why I don't know why you pick
424.76s: something that's significantly wider
427.36s: bitas spread than something like this so
430.04s: that's just a really novel position to
432.16s: me and it's hard to say I don't want to
435.68s: say that it's an uninformed position
437.44s: because that's not a tiny trade if we
439.68s: take a look real quick I see 1,20 plus
444.40s: 644 plus
447.68s: 728 so it's a 2 392 position at
456.08s: a191 it's like
459.04s: $456,000 it's a big position so I would
463.28s: man I don't
464.96s: know this one has me confused I really
467.40s: don't know because I would I would guess
470.60s: not retail because it's a near half
472.56s: million dollar position in options that
474.28s: expire in 8 days but this seems like a
477.16s: retail strike selection going to the
478.92s: halves I know why they did that but it's
481.84s: a person putting on a big trade like
483.52s: that's clearly what's happening here
485.20s: this is a trade that's interesting to me
487.48s: I know that a lot of times people kind
489.04s: of talk about oh is roring Kitty buying
491.96s: this or is he buying that and we can
493.92s: speculate a lot but it's really
496.24s: important to not manufacture the things
498.36s: that you want to see this is one of the
500.52s: first interesting call positions I've
502.36s: seen over the last few days doing this
504.20s: this is actually a pretty big position
506.40s: that was put on so this is a now that I
510.48s: will watch this isn't something that I
513.12s: necessarily will immediately take as
516.04s: some sort of alert or signal I don't
518.52s: really think that but I do see that
522.12s: these were also in at the offer so these
525.48s: are very clearly bought positions this
527.52s: is a bullish trade the reason why I can
529.40s: tell is if you look at the market it's
530.60s: showing you what the bed ask was and the
533.48s: offer there was $191 that's where they
535.12s: got in at so let's take a look at where
537.60s: these are centralized so if you go to
539.28s: the 28 Junes I see 236 of them there
543.20s: then in the 5 July it's 76k so quite a
545.92s: lot 12 July is pretty light at
549.60s: 16,000 19 July's
553.12s: 46 26 July is 7,000 let's go out here to
556.96s: the 16 Aug so it's still all very very
559.84s: near-term centered action as I go all
562.36s: the way through
563.44s: these very very near term it's not until
566.04s: 16 Jan that you actually see putsu in
568.88s: the overall volume which is pretty
570.20s: interesting now let's take a quick peek
572.20s: at
574.80s: oi almost double the calls to puts so
579.16s: again as per usual just massive call
581.56s: skew in this thing and it's hanging in
583.20s: there again let's run through the
584.88s: primary expirations really fast this
586.56s: front expiration 334,000 essentially
589.92s: against 128 so massive call skew 5 July
594.08s: it's about 2 to one calls to
596.96s: puts 12 July a little bit closer
600.60s: and then 19 July still massive call skew
603.00s: let's go out here to Aug closer still
605.44s: now so it's 88k calls to
608.56s: 58k
610.20s: puts further out still we start with
613.04s: putsu so 18 October has 53,000 puts
617.44s: against 46,000 calls 17 Jan back to call
621.28s: SK this is crazy back to
624.72s: put and then
626.88s: even that's hilarious the fact that it
629.32s: oscillates back and forth like that
630.76s: across these random time frames and then
632.48s: the last one's just even is kind of
634.88s: poetic to me all of the activities in
637.64s: the front that's kind of clearly
639.92s: observable here let's take a quick look
642.32s: now at this front
643.96s: exploration huge activity here at the
647.04s: 30s so there was 28,000 oi with 52,000
650.84s: transactions today so that's a lot of
653.64s: people that are buying no matter what
655.84s: and I also see the same story here at
658.48s: the 26s
659.92s: we have 9300 oi against 27,000
663.28s: transacted so a lot of people are buying
665.20s: here this is a lot of people buying
666.84s: calls that expire literally in one
669.88s: day and we got to check our boys at
672.36s: those 128s see how they're holding up I
674.36s: think yesterday they were at one and a
675.64s: half ah you just hate to see it I mean
678.88s: this is exactly what I told you guys is
681.16s: more likely to happen than not it's not
682.80s: like I'm some Oracle it's literally just
684.80s: such a high probability play but they're
687.84s: now essentially mid
690.40s: at
693.72s: 0.05
696.36s: 0.005 is the correct number these are
699.40s: essentially worthless and there was
700.72s: 4,000 transacted today against 64,000
703.32s: there there's going to be so many people
704.80s: that just lose all their money on that
706.12s: not that it's a ton because it was so
707.36s: cheap this is always an interesting play
709.56s: to me because I genuinely don't see why
711.36s: you come all the way out here to trade
712.88s: at stuff like this when you can go much
715.64s: closer and essentially get the same
716.92s: exact price if that's your move again
719.28s: again I want to always continue to
720.92s: redirect you guys to that video on
723.00s: buying call options smarter I will throw
724.80s: it in the notes below I genuinely think
726.64s: if you buy options and GameStop or stuff
728.48s: like this you should watch that video
730.44s: because I'm just trying to give you
731.88s: information about how to think about
733.72s: structuring your trades versus finding
736.12s: stuff that's super cheap and hoping it
737.72s: works it's a tough way to make money so
741.00s: I'll leave that point alone all right
742.16s: let's get over to chewy because today
743.88s: was really interesting and as I told you
747.12s: when this first kicked off I was
750.00s: watching chewy it's on my alerts for a
753.20s: few different reasons for the options
754.88s: chain specifically but today I got an
757.60s: alert on the stock itself and this is a
761.44s: today chart 2-minute candles and it
763.88s: started flying off right at 10 and again
767.56s: if we take a look at
770.16s: this 10
773.88s: so I don't want to get into the game of
776.88s: you know is dfv manipulating markets and
779.36s: stuff like that because as soon as he
781.20s: put that out a little bit later Jim
783.24s: Kramer put something out saying you know
785.16s: take advantage of it and sell half your
786.72s: position or whatever so I don't buy the
789.60s: argument that roaring Kitty is
791.36s: manipulating markets somehow but all
793.16s: these other pundit that are on TV shows
795.72s: talking about stocks all the time
796.96s: somehow aren't like n man get out of
799.08s: here so I don't care about that but the
802.32s: price
803.28s: activities timing is interesting right
806.32s: 10 tweet comes out 10 starts flying
810.12s: really hits this peak I had originally
812.24s: started transacting at about like 10:04
815.28s: so somewhere in here is when I got in
817.44s: and then I got stopped out on this side
820.00s: so it wasn't a giant move for me I was
821.96s: using long calls literally just to trade
823.88s: the flow nothing too complex but this
827.00s: just pops up on a stock scan first and
830.32s: then it turned into an options trading
832.48s: position for me it's literally just
834.32s: trading the activity I don't know
836.12s: anything about the company literally I
838.32s: kind of familiar with them but I don't
840.44s: know anything about them beyond that I
842.44s: just know it moved I need movement to
844.36s: make money that's what happened here for
845.96s: me but there's a lot of conjecture about
850.08s: if roren Kitty was in here potentially
853.24s: buying options trading options and
855.64s: here's what I see today there was a lot
858.64s: of volume that happened slight call skue
862.04s: if we come in here and we look at the
863.76s: the size of the trades there were just
866.52s: nothing really at roaring Kitty size I'm
870.24s: still filtering by 500 lots and unless
873.24s: ran Kitty like meaningfully is shrinking
876.00s: his positions or something like that I
877.80s: just don't see it happening here and I
879.64s: don't see it happening today this to me
881.84s: looks like he put out a tweet that might
884.52s: not even have been related to chewy this
887.44s: just looks like a standard dog Emoji
889.12s: this background is really interesting to
890.76s: me the color of that so I can't I can't
894.92s: say either way but the timing of it is
898.20s: too novel not to at least Loosely attach
901.68s: the two events together but when I look
903.92s: at the actual options chains as to
905.80s: whether or not he was transacting in
907.20s: here I don't see it the biggest call
909.28s: position was the 40s out in 28 June for
912.32s: 19 and there was 688 of those which
915.84s: that's not a very big position so we
917.56s: have 688
919.00s: times uh or I'm sorry at
923.48s: 19 it's a $113,000 trade so it's really
928.00s: nothing to write home about here here so
929.84s: I I don't see that personally that he
931.60s: was transacting in here but we will have
934.24s: to keep an eyeball on it now because it
936.44s: is a little interesting that there was
938.80s: quite that much volume today it looked
940.80s: like a lot of people piling in after
943.00s: they saw news come out and if we take a
945.68s: look at where most of those transactions
948.72s: occurred no surprise to anybody super
953.24s: far out of the money options which again
956.44s: for the vast majority of these people
957.84s: that is going to be money that's lit on
959.52s: fire and they'll never see again they
960.68s: won't even get to watch it burn which I
962.48s: guess would be the good part about
963.40s: lighting it on fire instead there's
966.68s: 29,000 calls transacted today at the 45
969.88s: which is a
971.00s: 0.04 Delta against 6,400 oi so that's a
975.20s: lot of
976.04s: purchases
977.64s: and it's super cheap so again going back
981.16s: off our standard thing the Theta DEC on
982.88s: these is 10 cents right now they're
985.04s: about mid at 92 so tomorrow these will
988.28s: be worth nothing
990.08s: is what it's going to come down to
991.00s: unless there's some sort of massive move
993.20s: which when I look at the chart in here I
995.32s: don't necessarily see uh Catalyst for it
998.16s: on the horizon Beyond some sort of you
1001.44s: know crazy Market activity look at the
1003.24s: sale volume today crazy crazy stuff the
1006.72s: other thing I saw was kind of an idea
1008.64s: about maybe xrt
1010.28s: Holdings I think the problem with that
1013.60s: theory is although chewy is the biggest
1015.84s: holding in
1017.36s: xrt it's small
1019.80s: like
1021.40s: 1.77% of the
1024.04s: ETF so I mean it could be you know the
1028.12s: that broader theory that we're
1029.44s: essentially using these for a shell game
1031.84s: but there's just not that much in here
1033.84s: and there's a lot of very near exposure
1036.16s: into other things like arvana or alies
1039.60s: so I'm not exactly sure that that's
1042.08s: what's happening here it's a great
1043.68s: Theory and as always like I genuinely
1046.16s: don't know definitively one way or the
1047.92s: other but when I look at this that's the
1050.72s: main thing I see is this is a pretty
1052.36s: light position in the broad context of
1055.76s: this ETF so the idea that they're trying
1057.48s: to play the shell game with Chewy and
1059.00s: here may be happening but it seems
1061.64s: difficult to do because of the dilution
1062.96s: from everything else that's kind of the
1064.28s: main point from that one but as always
1066.48s: I'm open to more information so if you
1067.88s: guys know something about it hit me up
1070.16s: as always if there's any questions let
1071.92s: me know I love taking a look at the
1073.44s: stuff that you guys want me to I love
1074.76s: sharing at least what I know about this
1076.68s: stuff with you all and trying to help
1078.52s: provide some useful information to
1080.08s: people this is my world so thank you for
1082.56s: letting me be a part of it and thank you
1083.96s: for sharing with me be an outlier see
1086.32s: you guys later
