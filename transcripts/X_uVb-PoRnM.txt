0.00s: What up outliers? Quick market update. I got two things on the agenda. The first one,
4.88s: quick look at the broad markets. Second thing, game stop earnings. We got to see what's
8.28s: going on in there. So let's dive right in today. The market really was all over the place.
14.80s: So if we actually jump into spy here, we can use something like SPX. And let's take
21.76s: a look at what it did in Shreday. So I want to look at today one minute and take a look
26.84s: at this. Started off a little bit of a gap up over yesterday, then crash down, based crash
32.40s: down, then rallied all the way up and out. It really started catching wind kind of
36.72s: like 10, 10, 10. And then it caught another breath of fresh air right at around 11. The
41.48s: reason why I know 11 is because I was just getting ready to place some trades. And I saw
45.20s: it start running. So I actually held off for a little bit and then kind of entered
49.72s: when I was basing in here. But what this means for me is the market is still in this highly
57.80s: tenuous position. I don't view this as ultra bullish, especially if you look at the
63.24s: S&P 500, the percentage of stocks that are above their 50 day moving averages, it actually
68.96s: declined today. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 was up today. So what does that tell me? It tells
74.48s: me that there was a handful of stocks that drove this movement. And then if we take a look
79.00s: over at the cues, we can see a lot of it came from the cues. This is tech really starting
85.32s: what I consider to be a really, really important price movement. And I'm going to zoom this
91.68s: out now just a little bit and show you what I'm talking about. Now in the analysis of a trend,
97.80s: what we want to see is higher highs, higher lows. And so we have a low here, we have a higher
102.84s: low here, we have a higher low here, and then we kind of hit this term high peak high for
108.44s: this timeframe that we start falling off. So then we create this low. Now this is a lower
114.36s: low compared to this, compared to this, but it maintains the broader trend for the timeframe.
120.84s: So now in my opinion, this price level becomes quite important because if this starts to fall
129.80s: at or below this low, that starts to confirm again, in my opinion, an actual down trend.
138.12s: And it still clearly is down trending in a short term timeframe. So if we look something close
143.24s: to this, again, near term high, then we just draw a general trend line, like clearly downward
149.24s: sloping. But the way I'm looking at this is the market has a little bit of a decision to make.
155.64s: And the reason why I'm cutting this candle off is to kind of fit it with this other period.
161.08s: This is overfitting this specific line from a TA drawing perspective. I don't really care. It's
166.68s: not for that purpose. It's just to show the broader trend that we're seeing here, where we are
173.08s: still getting slightly higher lows, which is again, important. But this is really, really
180.92s: delicate right now, in my opinion. So I'm keeping a really close eye. I do not have a lot of tech
185.32s: exposure here yet. I start to get interested in tech if we start looking at stuff above, I forgot
193.40s: that's a wrong tool. Let me grab trend line for price level. I like it above there. I start
201.24s: adding it to a closer watch list above here. Obviously, I look at it every day. But I need to see
206.76s: how it behaves in here. I need to see if it starts rallying up and challenging these zones that show
213.56s: like kind of lighter volume, right? So it's hitting right on this coming up right on this volume
219.32s: node has to cross up above that. But then after that, it's kind of smooth sailing as you can tell from
223.80s: the volume profile until you get up towards here. So and that would be starting to resume a broader
230.28s: up trend, which again, we just have to see how it behaves. From a breadth perspective, I do see both
236.68s: things like the money flow index is positive sloping here. And I see that the RSI is crossing over
244.84s: the EMA, which is also good because it just indicates to me a near term changing momentum that you're
252.52s: kind of seeing going on here. But we're still right around that kind of 50% level on the RSI. So
257.80s: when it's hanging around there, kind of in my opinion, go either way. But I like that it was
262.92s: well bought here. And it's moving up on sub average volume for 25 day periods. So yeah, overall
272.36s: really interested to see where this goes. I think this is again, not a point to start throwing a
277.72s: bunch of money around for me, at least the way that I trade. I am heavily utilized, but it's just
282.44s: not in stuff like tech. All right. Now let's get on to kind of the fun stuff, which is obviously
289.64s: GameStop. So GameStop reported earnings today. And it closed at 2345 right now trading around 2160.
297.40s: So we're down about 10% don't I don't love that look. But
306.44s: yeah, I feel like there's so much that goes into this earnings release and so much of it I don't know.
312.52s: So I don't actually feel comfortable speaking to heavily about like the broader context of Q2 and
319.40s: the way that the company typically performs. But if we take a look at some of our prior earnings,
325.40s: we can at least get an idea of how GameStop tends to behave, which is generally inside.
333.24s: Right. So as I look through this movement leading into earnings, it was up at 46. Then it came down
337.80s: to 28. This is obviously Q1, which is a little bit of a busy time for GME here. It came in at 15.5,
346.36s: came out at 13. So like this is generally standard fare from what I can tell from previous earnings
352.28s: releases, but like the broader context behind it. I'm not fully read into. But when I looked
358.12s: through the financials, it really didn't look bad to me. So starting from the top here, I was
366.28s: disappointed in that there was no statement or anything attached to it. And again, the community
372.76s: told me to expect that so I didn't have my hopes very high, but I still really wanted to see them
378.28s: say something about having four billion in cash, which is great. It's really good that they
383.96s: have a bunch of bunching cash. But from an investor standpoint, it's also like I want to know
390.28s: what the general idea is. Again, I know that there's something to be said about keeping like a
395.96s: competitive advantage by not necessarily forecasting all your moves and stuff like that.
399.80s: Like that makes sense. I'm okay with that. But I would just really, really love if at the very
405.88s: least they would give us something. We're looking to invest into the complex, literally any words
413.72s: associated with the cash pile that's sitting there would have been welcomed at least from my
417.96s: perspective to give some ideas. But let's go through this. So net sales came in positive, which
423.72s: was great 0.789 billion. So positive is good. Although we obviously came down from the 1.164,
433.96s: we saw net income at 14.8 million, which is super important because it was a loss year over year
443.96s: prior. And in cash right now, there's 4.204 billion. So again, they're sitting on a absolutely
455.16s: tremendous cash pile, which is exciting. But the excitement is slightly tempered for me right now,
462.52s: just because I want to know what they're doing. I want to know what's going on with this money.
467.88s: So I say it partially in just because I do think Cohen is super smart, way smarter than I am.
474.60s: So I know that he's making the moves that he's making for a reason. Or at least that's what I assume.
479.00s: So it doesn't bother me that much. But I just want to know, I just want to know. So let's scroll
485.88s: through this a little bit. So we can see net sales. That came down a little bit. I actually don't
491.48s: like to see that too much when we have sales contracting. And we can see that cost of sales has come
498.92s: down pretty massively. So net income came through pretty big time. A big part of that, obviously,
506.68s: you can tell stemming from here where we have again, much lower cost acquisition for sales
516.12s: operating loss has contracted pretty meaningfully. So overall, they seem to be in a pretty good
524.60s: position. Now I don't know how this leads into follow on earnings. But what I can say is that net
533.24s: income per share is pretty impressive in the sense. This is showing for pennies.
539.56s: So the other couple of things I want to highlight, let me see a little bit further down
547.72s: here. So we can see cash and equivalent securities, merchandise inventories, assets,
556.20s: all of that essentially is about the same. So merchandise inventories has come down a bit,
561.56s: which I find slightly interesting. But I also know that the company is trying to pivot a lot and
567.72s: lean into its successful stores and maybe start navigating a little bit away from its less
573.24s: successful stores, which again is just really smart for a company that's in this perspective.
577.48s: Accounts payable has come down quite a bit from 378 to 220 and liabilities about
587.08s: for long term debt. Sorry, for long term debt is about static. This I don't expect to see much
592.36s: change in this. But if there is a change in this, it typically tells me something's going on in a
596.68s: company. But that's why I look at that. And total liabilities is down as I think we generally
602.12s: expect. So long term net debt 12.4 versus 236. And total liabilities about the same call it
613.00s: relatively unchanged. You can see stockholders equity is moved from 1267 to 4383. So yeah, I think
624.44s: from a company perspective, like if I were like a value or a fundamental investor, which again,
630.68s: being completely honest with you guys, I'm not. I am a trader. But when I look at this, I see a company
635.48s: that seems like it's in a decent position to start doing something. But I also have to be honest,
641.64s: like right now, if I'm looking at this company, I'm thinking it's not doing much that I can see.
647.24s: Like I'm not seeing a bunch of capital improvements, massive plans coming out to expand the company,
652.20s: pivot the company, none of that. And again, my guess is Cohen probably has some ideas going on
657.48s: in the back end that, you know, he's probably just playing the game a little closer to his chest,
662.44s: for, you know, whatever reasons he has. But again, from a trader's perspective, it's kind of like,
668.76s: I need to know why I would put my money somewhere. And for something like this, if you have really
674.76s: strong belief in Cohen, the business, the ability to pivot, then sure, I totally get that. But
680.28s: again, like an objective analysis standpoint based on just the numbers, not the story,
685.00s: not the qualitative components, but just the numbers. This looks relatively light. It's obviously
691.16s: profitable to a degree. It's sitting on a literally war chest of cash. But as I continue to remind
698.44s: people, we have to do something with the cash because cash just sitting there really, it doesn't
703.40s: help us very much. Cash needs to be used to drive business. So hopefully, and again, that's my
709.00s: underlying assumption. They're just not ready to share it yet. There's a plan for this cash.
713.80s: So we can see sale from property and equipment, right? So we're starting to unwind things,
720.84s: which we knew is going on. Marketable securities came down massively. And let's see. Yeah, so huge
731.96s: cash flow essentially came from this segment in here. And a big part of it was decreasing
738.04s: marketable security purchases, right? So going from 313 to 75. So that's why this is so
744.68s: advantageous is essentially down to this line item. Repayments of debt about the same, not a big change
753.40s: there. Financing activities, right? We already know about all that. So cash equivalence 4.2.
761.32s: Yeah. So I mean, it's just it's a lot of money to sit on. This is what, yeah, like I didn't love this.
771.64s: So hardware accessory sales down. So net sales here, 597 here, 451, software, also down,
781.00s: collectibles, also down. So net sales from these, again, like I just, I don't love that.
791.48s: And it's the same thing from like the 26 week period versus the 13 week period, right? So
797.48s: this is giving you a slightly different comparison window. I don't love that because I would want to
805.88s: see sales moving again, it's still positive, which is good. But again, from like an objective
811.32s: analysis standpoint, this, this reiterates to me more so than ever, something needs to happen.
818.04s: And again, it's also important to remember this is why we compare typically different time frames,
823.72s: right? So this is looking 13 weeks, 26 weeks. It gives you different snapshots that cover different
828.60s: time periods. So sales is positive, which is great. And I know that there's a new console thing
833.96s: coming up. I think it's for PlayStation. Again, you guys would know better than I would on that.
838.04s: I would defer to you. But I'm not a PlayStation guy. I like Xbox. I've had that. I used to have
843.56s: PlayStation when I was a little kid. I remember playing like Gran Turismo on there. But we got a
847.32s: away from PlayStation pretty quick. I don't remember why. Maybe it was Halo moved us over to Xbox with
852.76s: I remember the Duke. Remember the Duke controller, this absolutely massive controller.
859.32s: So as I look through this, I'm interested. It doesn't look bad, but it also doesn't look like this
866.28s: is obviously a company that's currently outperforming. I think that's not necessarily a news flash.
871.72s: So for me, after looking through the financials and again, continuing to get closer to the product,
876.68s: I think a big part of this is just seeing where really where we go from here. We're at a spot.
883.56s: I don't want to call it maker break. So I think that's a little dramatic. I think that the company
887.80s: definitely has a decent runway to figure things out. But I don't think that this in and of itself
896.76s: is the winner of the day, right? We've known that it's had four billing cash for a month now.
903.00s: So the question is what do we do with it? And then the other question I have is I do like some
908.68s: video games, but I have absolutely no idea what I'm looking at up here. So if anybody can help me out
914.04s: with what the winged, it almost looks like a it looks like a dead pool ferry to me because this
919.16s: looks like a Deadpool mask. They have a sword and then they have wings. And then these remind me of
928.44s: harvesters from I forgot what game has harvesters. Maybe gears of war. I played that a while ago with
935.32s: a buddy that was kind of a strange. Strange for right. Anyways, don't know what this stuff is.
940.76s: We'd love to know. So now though, there is one other interesting piece of information. I look
946.84s: through the options chain. Somebody is probably going to be a little bit sad with these 990 24 calls
953.24s: for $208,000. That's not looking great. And that's for this Friday. So we don't love that for them
962.28s: unless they're part of like a spread. But what I have this filtered by right now is I care about
969.48s: single leg trades. So I get rid of spreads from the filtering. But here's the other thing that I
976.20s: can't help but find interesting is if we take a look at GameStop and if we take a look restricting
987.40s: trade size to 5,000. And we look at the last couple days, we see these blocks of 5,000 rolling
998.60s: in again. Now what I find interesting about the blocks of 5,000 today were that it was kind of
1005.56s: throughout the entire day. Whereas when we see these blocks of 5,000 yesterday, it was much more
1011.88s: short lived. There was a couple touches 0650 0655. This is a specific time 07. Then we see these 8,
1019.88s: 0840 transactions, which I have these earmarked as something I'm keeping an eye on. I'd see only
1026.20s: 1 0 840 transaction today. And then a bunch of like 0 9 0 10s. Sorry, not 0 9s, then 10s, 11s 12.
1036.44s: So it's kind of like throughout the rest of the afternoon. And then if we go back further though,
1040.60s: we can see that these 5,000 blocks have been happening for some time now. So based on the 9th,
1048.12s: based on the 6th, the 4th, the 4th again, the 3rd, the 30th of last month,
1055.16s: like there's lots of blocks of 5,000. The reason why I want to highlight that is because I know a lot
1060.28s: of people think that from Roryn Kitty's previous options trades, which we're going to dive further
1066.68s: into this coming GME live stream, this coming Saturday, because last Saturday, we got into the
1073.56s: weeds and I learned a lot. But one of the things is I think people just kind of naturally attribute
1079.40s: this size trade to him because of the options that he came into. But actually, I don't see that.
1085.64s: Obviously he doesn't have a monopoly on the size of 5,000. It's a nice round number tons of people
1092.68s: would transact there. And I'm not saying it's not him in the near term. I have no idea. But what I'm
1098.60s: highlighting is just that it's not relegated to him as, you know, solo fingerprint unique to him
1105.72s: and only him. That's all. As always, my goal is to try and analyze information as objectively as
1112.28s: possible. I have all sorts of crazy theories. It's literally why I have a tinfoil hat that I'll
1118.04s: throw on when I want to get weird and start throwing opinions out there. But when I'm looking at
1123.08s: this, I'm just trying to analyze data, interpret it as a trader, which is again, what I primarily do.
1130.04s: So there is buildout going on though. And there's a lot of these 5,000 block contracts. But it's not,
1135.00s: to be honest, like there's way bigger trades going on right now. So if we kill that 5,000 size
1141.32s: requirement and we sort this by premium, like there's literally a 2 million trade that ran through,
1149.48s: this is looking at the dark pool, by the way, for 93 three. There's 79,000 for 186 mill. So it's
1156.68s: like there's big trades going. And the reason why I highlight that is because it tells us that
1161.32s: there's liquidity, right? There's not in the options market to fill those contracts at 5,000 lots.
1169.00s: Like that's a pretty big options trade because obviously there's a hundred shares per. But that's
1173.80s: for relative size. It's larger 5,000 for an options market. But what I'm seeing here is that
1180.44s: if the order goes to the lid exchange through a dark pool and then obviously hits the consolidated
1185.56s: tape, there's still tons of liquidity here, right? So we're seeing, you know, just blocks of 10,000
1193.32s: move around like it's nothing, not moving the market that are being executed all together.
1199.80s: And then again, we see blocks almost up to 100,000. So it just tells me that there's liquidity here.
1206.20s: And for whatever reason, the, I don't know, the process of submitting like repetitive 5,000
1213.48s: lot trades is kind of the interesting to me because I would think of it from an efficiency standpoint
1219.88s: of why why bother doing that if you can simply get a much bigger price. Now it would make more
1226.04s: sense to me if these 5,000 lot contracts were being done day over day that I would get because
1234.04s: it's like you're scaling into something, right? So you're buying your 5,000 on the 9th,
1238.60s: then you buy 5,000 on the 10th, and you kind of dollar-ghost average into something over time.
1244.52s: But that's not exactly what I see here. Oh, it's my brother calling. In case you guys don't know
1249.88s: my phone, his name is Sasquatch because he's a, he's a big old boy. But shout out to you Sasquatch.
1257.00s: Anyways, back to this, there's a lot of these going on. Some of them that happened within
1262.76s: really tight time frames like this lead me to believe it's the same person. But the fact that this
1267.96s: happens across the entire day is confusing and makes me more likely to believe that this isn't
1275.16s: a single person, but likely different groups of people or different entities don't know who
1281.24s: that are transacting at, you know, their set prices. But when you look at these and you find
1285.00s: blocks of time where it's like right around one another, like soup like within seconds, super close
1290.36s: time frame, that like this right here, right? 707, 710, 732, like that's all right on top of one
1297.24s: another. So could that be three different people that entered in order right around the same time?
1302.12s: Sure, it could. But again, when I see it in this type of a compression at that exact size,
1307.56s: I typically believe that this might be one person. But don't know, that is the mystique and mystery
1315.32s: of trying to play this puzzle and piece things together with this kind of data. It's just so fun.
1320.60s: The absolute blast. I really, really enjoy it. And a couple of people are asking about when
1326.76s: Newton and I were going to do another live stream. I actually just hit him up yesterday. And he,
1333.64s: he and I were going to look for a time. So we don't know if it's going to be able to be a live stream,
1338.20s: but the dude's working like a dog right now. And he's trying to, you know, maintain his cadence
1343.64s: with his videos and stuff. So it's just challenging for him. But like I said, we text most days.
1349.48s: So we'll find something eventually, whether it's a live stream, which I obviously really
1354.12s: enjoy doing with you all. That would be my preference. But I also understand that, you know,
1358.04s: live streams are difficult timing for him. So he and I might do something recorded together in
1362.36s: the morning, early morning, so that it accommodates his schedule. Well, figure something out. But yeah,
1368.84s: looking forward to connecting with him again, because we have a lot to catch up on as this thing
1373.16s: continues to evolve. So yeah, just following up, I forgot who dropped that as a comment yesterday,
1377.96s: but I wanted to follow up with them. So that wraps me up as always. Let me know if there's anything you
1383.24s: want me to cover anything we should take a look at. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
