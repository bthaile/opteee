0.00s: sell outliers, 31 July, what happened in the market today? Well, a few things. And we're
5.56s: going to talk about it. As you can see, in the top left hand side, it might be a little
9.12s: bit small. Actually can't increase the text size there, unfortunately. But I wanted to
13.52s: give you an outline of what we're looking at today. I'm going to talk about FOMC, the
17.24s: indices, meta, crowd strike, and then our fabled GME at the end for any of the apes that
25.08s: aren't interested in the rest of this stuff. Just skip towards the end of the video that
28.44s: will be where you want to be. But for everybody else, let's start off here. And the first
35.56s: thing I want to talk about is what happened today with Big Daddy J-Pow and what he's
41.30s: talking about. And it's because it matters from a market perspective. And you actually
45.84s: saw the market react pretty heavily to what this was talking about today. I actually
50.32s: had some zero DTSPX options on that I managed almost like halfway through his talk, because
57.32s: watching them move as he was speaking made a decent bit of money today actually on
62.08s: the volatility. There was a lot of volatility baked into the zero DTS today. Obviously, I'd
68.52s: look at them every day. So what did he say? Kind of not much, to be honest, but not much
76.16s: is also important because he continues this very steady drum beat of the same thing. And
84.84s: he's messaging the same exact thing. So here, it obviously no surprise saying that the
94.36s: Fed interest rate right now is hanging out still at 5.3%. And there's a bunch of people
101.64s: saying that it should be lowered. We've had those conversations at nauseam at this point.
106.60s: And then you'll notice Powell said, if inflation continues to fall of reduction and our policy
111.00s: rate could be on the table. And this is standard messaging for him so far. He's not over
115.40s: under selling. And he's trying to keep the market from running away too fast on hopes.
120.44s: But I mean, let's be honest, market is going to do whatever the market wants to do. And
126.72s: it's just kind of part of the game here. Now this, I think is interesting. He says we're
132.28s: getting closer to the point at which it will be appropriate to reduce the rate, but we're
136.04s: not quite there. And he's reiterating this point multiple times. I think this is, again,
142.28s: a very standard fair for what he's been talking about. And you can see now interestingly enough
149.40s: that in the 18 set meeting, we're looking at a 12 and a half percent probability of half a
156.52s: point coming off and 87 and a half probability right now of a quarter point, which I think,
163.16s: I mean, if I were to place table stakes here, I would guess quarter point. And it looks like
168.20s: a quarter point each successive meeting throughout the end of the year. So this essentially would
174.68s: mean that we would have three cuts potentially. A couple notes here. This isn't, this is a overwhelming
182.04s: edge here, right? So 68% probability of 25 basis points on top of the previous from September
189.08s: plus the 9.3%, which is essentially the probability of a total cut between this. So the probability
194.92s: here is really good for the November meeting. But you'll notice in December, it's not quite as good
201.48s: necessarily. And the reason why I say that is because my guess is after we have these two cuts,
208.68s: if we have these two cuts, likely to have this one, if this one goes, which would still be my
212.84s: expectation, it gives to me half a point seems viable here. I don't know anything though. I'm not
217.56s: an economist. So as I say, half a point seems viable, that should mean nothing to anybody. It
222.12s: doesn't mean anything to me. That's what I think though. So looking at December though, my guess is
228.44s: based on how Powell has played this like really slow rolling a lot of this stuff, right? We're getting
233.64s: closer, but not quite reduction or a policy could be on the table like he's being overly conservative
241.48s: in my opinion with respect to the messaging at this point. So my guess is I would be surprised
247.00s: to see him go through three consecutive cuts in a row without taking a pause somewhere to see
253.00s: what the feedback is because one of the most dangerous things here is if he cuts and then rates rise,
259.00s: that becomes very problematic. And it'd be kind of like letting a genie out of the bottle. You've
263.48s: got to try to stuff it back in. If you've seen Aladdin, the genie does not like going back in,
268.12s: especially when you're far get some and yeah, you know, it gets out of hand fast. So that's what I'm
273.88s: seeing here. Overall punchline market liked this news today and we'll talk about the indices now
281.72s: in relation to that. So let's navigate away from meta and let's start with the broad
289.96s: indices overview, which is right here. And the E-minis are still happy. They had a huge day today
298.12s: and they're rallying up now still. Nasdaq is up in the Russell. The Russell had a fascinating day.
305.32s: If we take a look at small caps, they had this was just a day of emotions. Look at this. So it opened
313.00s: at 2262, rallyed all the way up to 22 or I'm sorry, to 2320. So essentially a 100 point rally.
322.84s: And then it closed at 2272, I think. I'm sorry. Yeah, 2273. So it up like a five point day
334.76s: after being up like 100 points. This is a crazy move in my opinion there. Very interesting.
340.92s: This comes a lot during the conversation that Paula had today. So if we zoom this in to like,
348.36s: I don't want to do it today one minute. That's a little excessive. Let's do a one day five minute.
352.76s: And you can see, you can see exactly how the market reacted during his conversation.
358.20s: Oh man, everything's great. Oh, shit. Here we go. That's kind of what happened here. So there was
364.92s: a couple of things I think that he talked about during the meeting that can lead to that kind of
370.20s: behavior. But the market is trying to front run this to a pretty big degree. That's the real
374.44s: punchline here. And it's not to be, it's not surprising. The Russell has had an amazing move
379.96s: so far this year playing a big game of catch up. So as I look at something like the IWM,
386.60s: specifically just because that's what I have in my little tracker here, year to date, it's up 12.7%.
392.36s: Literally all of that 12.7% year to date return essentially happened from here starting on the
398.76s: 11th. That's the lion share of what happened. Which is nuts. All of this was baked into small caps
407.00s: finally getting a glimpse of sunlight at the end of the tunnel with the rate environment
411.24s: potentially changing for them. So that's what we're seeing across the indices writ large. The
417.48s: percentage of S&P 500 stocks above their 50 days 72%. So still overall what I would consider
422.28s: to be in bullish territory, the E-minis and really just the S&P 500 in general. To me, it's tentative
428.04s: here though. I say that because we're kind of at an important point, I believe. We started breaking
435.56s: down pretty reasonably, meaning we broke down, bounced around here, consolidated, hanging right out
443.48s: on the 50 day moving average. And it's starting to pop above here, which is good to see.
448.92s: And I think that this was kind of the near term resistance. It was going to have to navigate
452.76s: through and it kind of popped right up through it. Didn't really care so much here is where that
456.20s: resistance was based on this volume node. So people are interested here, which is good. So
463.00s: Raleon, maybe that's more more likely than not what I'm seeing here at least as of now. We're
468.60s: seeing breath indicators expand. So if I slide myself out of the way so that you can see,
475.48s: you'll see that this is for the NASDAQ. But net highs lows is moving up pretty meaningfully.
481.96s: We see highs accelerating and we see lows decelerating. So all in all, that's a generally
490.04s: bullish breadth configuration to me. And this is where I keep an eye on the market. I want to see
496.12s: how I want to use my money and find awesome opportunities. There are no shortage of them. I want to
502.92s: switch to meta quick, talk about their earnings at a really high level. They had a great earnings
509.72s: release. So they close today at force 7483. And right now after hours, they're at 508 and a half
516.84s: ish. So you can see the breakdown of its earnings. Let's take a look through this quickly together.
526.28s: So we see Q3 revenue. And it looks like their projections looked pretty good. And they're holding
537.72s: off on quantitative guidance for 25 into a Q4. So they're giving themselves a little bit of time
544.12s: to pull themselves together. It says we anticipate our full year 24 capital expenditures to be in
549.00s: the range of 37 to 40 billion updated from our prior range of 35 to 40 billion. While we continue to
556.76s: refine our plans for next year, we expect significant capital expenditures growth in 25, which is
562.76s: pretty cool. As we invest to support our AI research and product development efforts. So again,
570.60s: the market is very excited about AI as it should be. I believe it's one of those truly revolutionary
578.44s: technologies that we haven't seen since what I would consider to be the internet. I think that
583.64s: this offers depending on how it scales. And if the terminator is spawned, hopefully not,
589.56s: I think AI can just change a lot of stuff. So yeah, overall, it looks like this is interesting.
597.72s: It says meta AI on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by year end. So they're
603.80s: really leaning into that segment. And it's working well for them so far. Earnings is again,
609.40s: they're coming off the shelf here, still hovering right around 508. So up, up almost 35 points,
617.32s: big run for them, all 35 plus. So that's meta quick pivot over to CRW. Oh, yeah, sorry,
624.76s: before we do that, I wanted to take a look at some meta options. Market stays on the ball. There were
631.24s: 1.2 million calls to about 900,000 puts. And then let's see what was isolated around this earnings
639.24s: release 103,000 to 87,000. So this is kind of like a mixed bag. Lots of people hedging positions
645.16s: out there is what I saw. And then we got some solo dole homies out here at the eight hundies.
651.96s: Swing for the fences is what I say, good, good for them. So the options in here are pretty active.
659.72s: All right. So now let's get back over here. And we need to take a quick look at
663.56s: Crage Strike because this one's been interesting and lower. She goes. This has been pretty continual.
668.92s: At this point, this has been one of the easiest fades I've come across in my trading career,
675.00s: especially after I got back in after this breakdown. And all I'm doing is sliding stops down.
681.24s: And I mean, I'll follow this as low as it goes. I'm very, very curious where that is. I do see a volume
689.56s: node building here. So you notice when it was transacting around here, we started seeing these
694.76s: volume nodes expanding out as people are picking up shares. And this one got out pretty far.
700.20s: Right. So this is where the point of control is up here before the drop lots of people interested
703.96s: to hear, but this is from before. Right. So this volume node is built back here. Then this volume
710.68s: node you can tell is being built right now because it didn't trade back here earlier on this chart.
716.44s: So people are interested in here. Now we see today two things. First thing I notice is the volume
722.60s: node is building a little bit slow, but it needs more time to even see if we're going to outpace
727.16s: this one. More importantly, though, volume today is slowing down. So what I'm looking for is how much
734.52s: sale volume are we getting? That's highly informative to me. So here on this day, the 29th,
741.64s: there was 9.8 million sale volume on the 30th, 17 million sale volume. So sale volume is accelerating
749.56s: here. It accelerated from here. Then today sale volume is down to 6.8 million. So sale volume
756.20s: is slowing down. Does that mean that it's done? I have no idea. But what it does mean is right now,
761.64s: this becomes where I manage the short to the upside, give it more room to run if it feels like it,
768.52s: I probably will set a prelimal alert here to scale out a little bit if it starts making that run
774.60s: early enough. Otherwise, I will follow this thing into the dirt happily. And to be honest,
780.76s: I have nothing wrong with CrossTrack. It's just doing exactly what I want, which is very rare,
784.76s: as a trader, as most of you probably know. But what I'm highlighting here is the importance of
788.92s: following a trade through, not just immediately seeing from here when I got my breakdown. And then
794.52s: just bouncing as soon as it started consolidating, like let the trade work. If you move your stops down,
799.88s: give it enough room, it again, something with this kind of weakness, just flow with it.
805.16s: Now, the other thing I will note in here though is I do believe whenever this does turn around,
810.68s: it offers inverse opportunity where we probably have overextended this and then some in my opinion
816.12s: at this point. I think we're at an extreme. But that doesn't mean that we stop and it doesn't
820.36s: mean we're not at an extreme. The market's going to determine what that is. But I would not be surprised
825.56s: at all to see this whenever the dust starts to settle. The news calms down to see a nice rally
831.56s: out of CrowdStrike. We will see. All right. Last thing. The bell of the ball. GME.
839.24s: First and foremost, got a positive print today. So we landed up 1.21 percent, which was really
848.36s: nice to see. Big fan. And it looks like unfortunately, though, in my opinion, that we didn't make much
855.32s: headway above and again, this is just a line, right? I don't want people to look at this and be like,
859.08s: well, I can't believe it's not breaking through that. It's just a line. I drew this yesterday.
863.40s: It doesn't mean anything. The price will go through it whenever it feels like it. But I did want to
869.32s: see it go through it today. And it did. You see if we zoom this in that we had some interest above
875.64s: here, but then it collapsed back down a little bit. So a bit of mixed price action. That's what I
881.64s: call it today in GameStop. But I love that it's starting to fight back here. And it's difficult to
888.04s: see. But do you notice the black zone here? And or maybe you just take my word for it. There's a
895.16s: volume note right here is what I'm showing you. And I love seeing this volume note all the way
900.36s: out here because this is what I was talking about in terms of really wanting to see people buying
907.08s: in and filling in this giant gap of a volume node. The reason why I care about that is because it
913.80s: tells me where people are interested in transacting. So for example, what I'm showing you guys before
918.68s: is like, this is devoid of volume. Nobody really traded in this level. So frequently as price
926.52s: drift towards that level, it becomes either in a place where new volume node will be built if
930.76s: there's interest or a place where people aren't interested in transacting writ large. So
936.68s: this is cool to see because it means people are starting to want to transact at these levels,
940.44s: which is fantastic. Now, let's take a look at the options chain. And I see a bit of a slowing down
952.20s: process in terms of the gap between calls and puts. I see 676,000 calls to 324,000 puts. Again,
960.76s: that's just reiterating when I see GameStop and like it's really bullish configuration, there's
965.32s: at least two to one calls to puts. But again, options are derivatives. Their values are derived
974.04s: from an underlying contract. So if the GME starts getting bit up, you probably will see the options
980.60s: start getting more active. But it's also kind of interesting because sometimes options lead
985.72s: things a little bit, which is what happened actually during the squeeze that we saw here.
990.36s: Options started getting active before these moves. So people were positioning for this to
995.56s: in some degree, which is just very interesting to me. We'll take a look at more at that tomorrow
1001.80s: during the GME live stream. So when I see this now, I'm seeing a lot of build out in 16og, which
1009.64s: continues to reiterate that same message, the takeaway in my opinion from a trading perspective
1014.04s: from there that people are interested as I would expect them to be in the 16og expiration. And
1020.76s: this is just the next standard expiration. There's definitely some hype built up around early
1026.20s: aug, which I'm also hyped to see how it goes. But this is also people moving out to the next
1031.40s: primary expiration cycle. The other thing I notice is this here, where in 6CEP, we can see that
1037.24s: we have 103% IV that tells me something's coming up then and I look over here and I see
1043.16s: earnings. And earnings is on the fourth as it sits now before the market. So again, this is how you
1047.56s: can use options to come up with ideas on where we think something might be going on because I can see
1053.72s: 92, 83, 90, right? So we're looking at like the high 80s low 90s here and then something at 100.
1059.24s: That's anomalous. So that's what that is though. I could tell something and it's just earnings.
1065.16s: So looking at the transactions today, there is 110,000 calls transacted against 37,000 puts,
1070.60s: which is great. That will build out this OI discrepancy. The problem I have with this,
1076.84s: unfortunately, is just a ton of this is in twoog. And we don't know exactly yet how much is opening
1084.12s: and closing volume. So we'll take a look at these 25s in twoog. And let's see. So we added
1093.40s: 3,920 over yesterday and there was 10,000 that transacted today. I'm actually very interested to
1099.56s: see what this does tomorrow because it's not clearly all going to be ad, but the trade is running
1107.16s: out of time and these are decaying away super fast, right? So these are midpoint seven cents.
1112.76s: They did a case six cents. You wait another day. Your options essentially become worth
1116.60s: us unless you get a big price move. So these become really, really dangerous to hold onto. I wouldn't
1122.44s: be surprised to see some of this 10,000 being closing out volume. And what I see the majority of
1127.88s: time in people doing this is trying to gain exposure to the next to the next expiration. So the
1133.88s: 25s here you can already see are starting to get built out. There's 5,000 contracts OI 2000 volume
1141.88s: 500 added over yesterday. So people are starting to build out in the next nearest
1146.68s: expiration cycle. But as I look at the overall OI for nineog it's still very quiet. So 48,000
1155.32s: calls against 19,000 puts. This is good that it's 2 to 1 again a slightly more bullish configuration.
1163.00s: But it's just generally light for GameStop again for comparison if we look at 16 off 220,000
1168.44s: against 107 in 16og. And as I continue to reiterate, a million times liquidity is a thing here.
1175.08s: So today I actually made some adjustments in my 20 step calls. They're still there. This is just
1179.72s: my pass through account. So it doesn't show my positions. But I still have long shares and I still
1184.92s: have short calls against them. But what I did for the short calls is I actually rolled them down
1190.36s: closer to add the money. Do this for two reasons. In doing so, I'm out in 20 step for a few reasons.
1197.56s: If I take a look at 30og and I take a look at the Theta decay for the at the monies, it's about
1202.84s: $3.4. If I look at $3.7. DTE, it's about $3.4. If I look at $51. DTE, it's about $3. So by going
1211.96s: further out in time, I'm not actually pulling away a bunch of Theta decay from my options from
1217.96s: the short calls against the long shares. I have to continue reminding people of that because as
1222.44s: soon as people hear short calls, they think I'm fading GameStop and I'm not. I'm long GameStop.
1227.72s: Now that's also not to say that I've absolutely traded GameStop to these down moves, but I just
1233.40s: maintain long shares during it. I will use options to trade price movement both directions. That's
1238.84s: one of the fascinating things about GameStop is that it moves around a lot. And the long shares
1244.68s: are component of the trade. But then I also have options that I can deploy to try to extract as
1251.00s: much as I can from GameStop, build a position out. So anyways, back to this though, when I see this,
1258.52s: I'm not really giving up on Theta decay and I'm giving myself a little bit lighter gamma.
1265.40s: So here the gamma is eight. Here the gamma is five. The reason why that matters is because these will
1271.32s: just move a little bit slower, which is what I want from a short option. I want to just pull in the
1275.96s: premium as I can. I don't want it to fly around too much. And by keeping them a little further
1281.24s: out in time, I don't want 51 days to be clear. I would prefer this to be like 40, but there's no 40 day
1287.24s: expiration. And these are less liquid than where I'm at now. So I'm making sure that I'm maintaining
1293.80s: upside profit potential. But I'm keeping a higher delta on these short calls so that if GameStop does
1298.92s: have a bit of a consolidation period or a down move, I can again, make some money on the short
1304.68s: calls and roll those into either long options when I decide to play it to the upside. But
1311.24s: it's kind of moving with the product as much as I might want it to do one thing or the other.
1315.24s: I don't get to pick. I have to play the game as it chooses to play the game and my job is to work
1321.16s: with it as best as possible. So that's what I have going on. That's what I'm looking at right now.
1327.00s: I will see you guys tomorrow during the GameStop livestream for those interested. And then Friday
1332.28s: is Options Trading for Beginners. We have another part to that series come hang out, learn about
1337.40s: options, be an outlier. See you guys later.
