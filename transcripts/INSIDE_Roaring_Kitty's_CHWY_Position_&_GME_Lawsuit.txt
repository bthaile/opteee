0.76s: what a day I thought it was going to be
2.44s: a slow week There's a holiday short
4.92s: trading week and no we have roaring
7.64s: Kitty coming out with a 9, 1,000 share
11.64s: chewy position that we have to take a
13.60s: look at we have a civil class action
17.64s: lawsuit that was launched and then
19.68s: subsequently unlaunched we got to talk
21.92s: about that then we got to take a look at
23.52s: GameStop and the options activity going
26.72s: on there so we have a full docket let's
29.56s: get straight into the details we'll
31.00s: start with the easy stuff here let's
32.72s: start with these cases and I find them
34.56s: very interesting the very first thing to
36.28s: note is I'm always very upfront with the
38.28s: stuff I know about and the stuff I don't
40.32s: I don't know anything about this I'm
41.92s: just applying normal logic so if there's
44.20s: any lawyers or anybody who know way more
46.48s: about this stuff than I do I would love
48.64s: to hear you weigh in but so far here's
51.56s: what I'm seeing and I will throw links
53.24s: to all of this in the notes so that you
54.92s: can look for yourself I think it's very
57.00s: important to be able to fact check
59.00s: sources so
60.84s: the 28th of June we had a class action
65.04s: complaint filed against roaring Kitty by
68.68s: Martin Riv and then other people so
72.48s: obviously what they do is they pick
74.36s: somebody to represent the group and then
77.08s: they assemble the group later on they
78.76s: find somebody that's been damaged that
80.60s: is representative of a larger totality
84.04s: of people and this thing is 40 pages
87.72s: there's quite a bit of detail and it's
89.64s: something something to the tune of pump
92.36s: and dump stock manipulation that kind of
95.16s: stuff we can essentially skip through
97.60s: most of it and I want to hone in on a
99.32s: few things and no the thing I don't want
101.84s: to hone in on necessarily is our boy
104.24s: Martin's 35 shares to which obviously is
106.84s: very very damaging to him it's less than
108.84s: I think $1,000 total here something like
110.84s: that so let's not hone in on that and
114.72s: let's talk about the the broader thing
116.16s: here which is really interesting because
118.16s: when I look at somebody like dfv one of
120.28s: the primary complaints from this is that
121.92s: they felt that he owed or Kitty owed
126.08s: other people some sort of heads up that
128.68s: he was going to unwind his position
130.28s: which is crazy to me the dude is an
133.64s: individual investor that's not even
135.12s: making any recommendations whatsoever
136.72s: yet you have people like Jim Kramer who
138.20s: jump on TV and I'm not I'm not trashing
139.92s: Kramer either I think it's okay to talk
141.52s: about your opinion but this is super
143.36s: frustrating when people Tred to
145.60s: essentially go for a money grab and law
148.24s: firms like this are very very smart and
151.20s: what they do is specialize in kind of
153.20s: these contingent style cases where
156.00s: they're not collecting a bunch of money
157.08s: up front they're trying to see if they
159.84s: have access to a pot of money that then
161.56s: they would get paid from that's probably
163.16s: even more than they could possibly make
164.48s: from one individual person up front so
167.84s: there are entire law firms that
169.32s: specialize in this stuff I have no idea
170.64s: if these guys do or don't I don't know
171.92s: them from a hole in- the- wall but there
174.08s: are a few things I find fascinating
175.60s: about this whole thing 28th of June this
177.72s: thing comes out Friday then we see this
181.04s: today voluntary
183.40s: dismissal 1st of
186.60s: July H crazy huh you go through the
189.96s: effort of making this entire statement
191.68s: you're grabbing some details again this
193.48s: isn't like a ton of work for them they
194.80s: have an entire staff that helps them but
196.60s: that does take Manpower and resources to
198.64s: build this and they submit this Friday
201.48s: and then Monday they're like nah take
204.20s: back se's never mind didn't mean it very
206.40s: strange to me don't know exactly what
208.72s: that means I do know a things though
210.56s: that this without prejudice component
212.60s: means that they can refile at some point
215.12s: there might be some gamesmanship going
216.56s: on because here's what I do know these
217.96s: aren't dumb people they're not playing
221.00s: checkers they're playing chess so I
223.40s: don't know what this turns into but this
227.00s: time frame is confounding to me I don't
230.20s: know the exact reason maybe somebody
231.52s: else does but again just from a logical
234.60s: perspective this doesn't logically flow
238.00s: if you go into this because there must
240.40s: have been some sort of injection of new
241.80s: information that led to this change but
244.08s: we don't know what it could be something
245.48s: as simple as they might want to try to
247.24s: take it to another place outside of New
248.96s: York it's very very difficult to tell
252.08s: but something changed and it was
254.72s: material enough that they wanted to
256.48s: Pivot that's what we do know so enough
259.08s: on the case for now at least because
260.56s: it's gone for the time being something
262.64s: to keep an eye on though because that is
264.88s: just an interesting progression next up
267.24s: let's take a quick look at some GameStop
269.84s: in general first and then we'll take a
271.44s: look at chewy and what might have
273.08s: happened there because when we take a
275.16s: look at GameStop I'm not seeing a ton of
277.48s: options activity nothing that's
279.96s: necessarily jumping out to me as very
282.84s: novel I'm seeing the same flattening
285.92s: across volatility for various expiration
289.40s: cycles and let's take a look at open
291.64s: interest first and I want to highlight a
294.84s: few things for you guys the first one is
296.24s: there's still massive call skew on oi
300.68s: 721 th000 calls against 464 465 give it
304.88s: to them on the put side and then if we
307.12s: take a look at volume today it's still
309.40s: very heavy it's over 200,000 almost
311.52s: 300,000 calls traded against 128k on the
315.16s: put side so very very heavy there for
317.28s: most of the volume we saw today it's for
319.52s: the 5 July expiration there's a couple
321.92s: interesting strikes that we need to take
323.32s: a look at the 24s definitely saw a lot
325.88s: of action the 25s and then I'm going to
327.92s: guess these are the 30s yep and then if
330.04s: we take a look at the open interest
332.24s: though notice how all the red here this
334.88s: actually is a lot of activity in the
336.44s: 19th July so this looks like people kind
339.16s: of playing the front month but then
341.36s: starting to establish positions in the
343.28s: next primary expiration cycle which is
345.24s: what I would expect to see based on
346.48s: liquidity plus again with the holiday
348.68s: this week I I just this is a tough
351.04s: position I think for any sort of
353.36s: expectation of super heavy movement but
355.56s: if we take a look at the oi on the 30s
358.32s: it's $ 16991 1 and there was 16712 that
362.16s: traded today that's very interesting to
363.72s: me I'm very curious what this strike
366.32s: will look like tomorrow because if a lot
368.92s: of that is opening positions that would
371.28s: be very surprising to me we're on a
372.80s: short week There's not necessarily a
375.00s: huge catalist especially after the news
376.76s: that came out today so this wouldn't
378.76s: overly surprise me if there's a lot of
380.32s: exits but if we take a look here and
383.40s: here so if you take a look at the 24s
385.32s: and the 25s the 24s have essentially 12K
388.40s: of OI but 19 18K of volume so there's
391.16s: definitely tons of opening positions
392.56s: there and even more opening positions
394.40s: here at the 25 over 10,000 calls opened
398.08s: now these are decent buys though these
399.60s: are a little closer to the money about a
401.00s: 30 Delta which again you could check out
403.20s: that video on buying option smarters for
404.80s: gme people I continue to push that
406.68s: because I want to make sure the word
407.88s: gets out on at least having a model to
411.84s: assess how we're buying options as
413.60s: compared to what we've been seeing to a
415.40s: pretty significant degree of people
417.56s: being super cheap coming all the way out
419.88s: here to the 95s which are now mid at
425.08s: 0.015 and we see 13,000 oi and 6,500
428.96s: transacted there they're less than a
432.28s: 0.01 Delta and they have essentially no
435.08s: gamma and they're going to Decay away in
436.96s: like a day I try to steer people out of
439.88s: those if possible just to get them to
441.28s: consider other positions essentially but
443.04s: that's what's going on here in 5 July
445.56s: looking at 19 July there's a huge
449.20s: position building at the 25s this is up
451.28s: to 20,000 21,000 almost at the 30s
454.72s: there's 27,000 and at the 40s there's
457.80s: 20,000 so this starts to become really
460.96s: interesting to me because it's not quite
463.60s: severe enough necessarily for a gamma
465.96s: ramp per se but this is a lot of
469.36s: activity going on and it's expanding
471.60s: pretty meaningfully because if you have
473.48s: 20,000 oi and then 8,000 volume traded
475.84s: today assuming a good chunk of that will
477.32s: be buying that starts to build build up
480.56s: and speaking of building up let's take a
482.16s: look at time and sales because there are
483.80s: a few things that stuck out to me today
486.44s: at least first I want to take a look at
490.16s: uh 250 that's what I'm filtering by to
492.40s: start so we're looking for slightly
494.24s: larger positions and I see a few things
497.44s: that pop out at my eyes not worrying
499.12s: about the put side so much don't care
500.96s: too much there like these 125s 9s these
504.16s: are far out of the money more YOLO
506.08s: Styles they're smaller positions in
508.20s: terms of amount of capital I don't
509.60s: really care about that but there are a
512.00s: couple in here I do care about so like
513.84s: this here this looks like somebody
515.44s: selling short calls against long shares
517.88s: covered calls these are all sales and
520.56s: they're at the 22 and 23 strike here in
522.92s: 5 July so this person's collecting a
525.36s: decent amount of money selling premium
528.44s: and again my guess is these would be
530.20s: against shares because you can see where
532.08s: the underlying was traded when they put
533.60s: these on the underlying was at 23 it was
536.12s: already over their strike when they
538.08s: established these positions so this
539.24s: looks look like they might want to get
540.64s: the shares called away and collect a few
542.56s: dollars doing it that's what I pick up
544.36s: from that at least then we have this
547.56s: position down here where are you this
549.44s: one this 20 September 22 call there's
552.60s: 500 and there was 690 of these or I'm
556.20s: sorry they traded at 690 there was 500
558.92s: of these that traded at
560.68s: 690 and this I couldn't necessarily tell
564.20s: if it's a buy or a sale I'm assuming
565.92s: it's a sale based on again the broader
568.56s: context here but it looks like people
570.92s: are starting to capitalize on a bit of
573.20s: the premium that's rolling in the last
576.40s: thing I want to take a look at with you
577.52s: guys with respect to GameStop is as
579.76s: always we'll take a look at the Vault
581.84s: this is for the out- of-the money
582.88s: options we're seeing the puts start to
584.76s: jump up as per usual the call side's a
586.96s: little heavy but nothing crazy what's
589.84s: most interesting here is if we clear up
591.68s: some of this noise you'll actually see a
594.84s: volatility Traders great friend which is
597.40s: all of this inversion right in here it's
599.36s: it's kind of difficult to see but
601.68s: typically we expect to see these shorter
604.20s: term time frames actually to trade above
606.24s: these so the fact that these are all
607.68s: inverted crossing over one another is a
609.88s: tradable event from a volatility
611.64s: perspective all
613.68s: right now we have to talk about
616.36s: this the fact that roaring Kitty is
618.76s: indeed not a cat that's great
621.52s: clarification we see that on the 24th of
624.92s: June we have a pretty meaningful
627.52s: position which is 9 million1 ,000 shares
630.56s: so the question is where did this come
632.76s: from because if we take a look on the
635.88s: 24th of June where Chewy was trading
640.16s: this is not a small position so if I
642.92s: drop in chewy and then if we go to the
645.88s: 24th of June let's give them a fair
648.12s: price let's say that we could have got
649.56s: in at like 25 which would be low I
651.76s: actually don't think we would have
653.28s: gotten a full fi there but let's say we
654.84s: got in at 25 and let's take a look at
658.48s: the position which is is 9 milon 1,000
661.60s: shares that's $225 million now I also
665.04s: see some conversation that he might have
666.48s: gotten in at 27 I I'm not sure myself
669.16s: I'm using a lower planning Factor here
671.40s: because it doesn't actually matter what
673.36s: it is because the point Rings true even
675.92s: with the lower planning factor of
678.64s: 225 and let's take a pause real quick
681.44s: we're talking about an individual retail
683.28s: Trader that goes by the name roaring
685.48s: Kitty that's
687.08s: slinging 22 5
691.96s: million how can that not be fascinating
695.36s: to everybody it's crazy that's
697.72s: absolutely crazy that that's what I'm
699.92s: talking about right now but I am here we
702.08s: are so this is nuts so this position
705.64s: goes on and he obviously files now I
708.84s: would not at all be surprised if he's
711.24s: already out of this thing I would not at
712.84s: all be surprised I think he technically
715.08s: would owe an amendment within 10 days
717.96s: from here I'm not positive on that but I
720.32s: think he would owe an amendment so I
723.40s: wouldn't be surprised to see another 13g
725.68s: come out in the near future that might
727.84s: Place him out of this trade but the
730.20s: other question is how did he get into
732.12s: this trade because we know based on his
734.36s: last position he had like $6 million a
736.28s: little over six like six and a half
737.60s: maybe something just shy of that so
741.04s: that's not 225 again giving them the
743.24s: benefit of the doubt so where does that
744.72s: money come from that really is a pretty
747.56s: big question and
750.24s: as far as I see it there's a few
751.92s: scenarios in the military we use course
754.52s: of action Kaa which is kind of what it
756.68s: sounds like how something might go down
759.08s: and there's a few of them there's more
760.24s: than this to be clear but we like to
762.20s: think in threes I'm a simple person so I
764.32s: picked three that I thought were
766.44s: probably representative of this so we
769.84s: have the scenario where he might have
771.60s: sold to close GameStop shares to then
775.56s: buy Chewy and we'll talk about that
779.88s: probably probably not don't know really
782.52s: hard to tell he could have traded chewy
785.24s: options use the proceeds from that to
787.88s: then
789.16s: byy also in a vacuum it
793.72s: seems doubtful not impossible then we
798.12s: have this third Kaa where you might have
800.40s: traded other things or a combination of
802.84s: things to then clear up enough capital
805.80s: in order to establish the position of
808.08s: chewy that's my expectation COA 3 is
811.68s: that this might have been several
814.36s: factors that joined together to build
816.52s: this position as compared to completely
818.48s: flattening GameStop as compared to
820.64s: Turning 6 million into 225 million just
824.12s: trading options I know Richard was
826.16s: talking about that in his video and
827.84s: again it's roaring Kitty like you can't
829.88s: put anything outside the realm of
832.28s: possibility but just trying to apply a
834.80s: logical thought process it seems really
836.84s: difficult and we'll take a look at the
837.76s: chewy options I literally downloaded all
839.88s: of them from all of last month to see
843.04s: what kind of positions could have
844.32s: produced that so first let's talk about
846.68s: Co 1 and my hesitation with this one and
850.68s: it's actually from the conversation that
852.60s: I had with Richard he showed me this
855.60s: really interesting piece of his
857.84s: incredible Excel sheet that he's been
859.28s: building and this stuck out to me and
862.08s: he's explicitly called this out to me as
863.72s: well to be clear this over the course of
867.28s: the different positions we've seen him
868.76s: have from 2020 on he's never decreased
871.68s: his position from what we've seen 250
874.48s: 10,000 50,000 200,000 I'm sorry 50,000
878.48s: 100,000 200,000 800,000 1 million 5
881.32s: million 9 million haven't seen it go
884.76s: down so it doesn't seem like he's in the
888.32s: habit of unwinding a bunch of his
890.80s: positions to get in the other thing
893.00s: though that I will say when I look at
894.44s: this is there's some really big
896.24s: expansion right 10,000 to 50 huge huge
900.44s: 50 to 100,000 big 1 to2 2 to 8 like it
904.36s: starts getting exponential here in terms
906.52s: of sizing so then the question is did he
909.44s: actually expect to park all 9 million
912.00s: shares into perpetuity that's tough to
915.20s: say because it does lock up capital for
917.36s: him and especially to be able to play
919.16s: something like this so let's take a look
922.24s: then at the chewy options
924.60s: thing and again this is kind of a
929.00s: all-encompassing document that I use
931.48s: let's start by looking at long calls
933.64s: however and this is looking for through
937.12s: all of last month the first thing I want
939.68s: to focus on is this 5,000 lot position a
942.28s: lot of people are talking about funny
943.72s: enough this actually isn't the biggest
945.08s: position that went on sometimes people
947.08s: get too focused on the size remember
949.48s: it's not all about the size and we
951.64s: forget the price that goes along with it
954.28s: in some of these instances so there are
956.60s: actually positions with a large total
959.68s: value associated with it so if we take a
962.36s: look at that we can see that there's
963.96s: actually some really large positions
965.72s: that went on here essentially in this
968.32s: block so if we then filter on these what
972.64s: we would call larger positions and let's
974.84s: say that we want to make sure everything
976.96s: we're looking at is at least greater
978.40s: than
980.36s: $100,000 something like that it limits
983.72s: our scope a bit to see what could have
985.32s: gone on here now if we take a look at
987.28s: these strike prices I
989.52s: see the majority of them going on at 30
993.56s: I also see 35 25 like those are the main
996.92s: ones that I'm keying into here so then
999.96s: the question is okay maybe we got into
1003.92s: chewy early but the problem is then if
1006.64s: we look at some of these dates and we go
1008.36s: back early these are the smaller
1010.20s: positions so then it's like well then
1013.76s: let's
1014.60s: see where we have sales of those calls
1018.96s: because he would have needed to unwind
1021.48s: the position we have to clear this
1023.44s: filter because it's using uh positive
1027.20s: integer we have to see where he would
1029.16s: have Unwound those calls right so then
1031.40s: we would look at the short calls to see
1033.04s: what would have happened after those
1035.32s: long calls and we do see these 30s right
1037.96s: this is one day after on that previous
1040.60s: expiration so that could absolutely be
1045.12s: something that happened right because
1046.36s: this is the 19 July uh I got to find
1049.80s: those 30s this one 19 July 5,000 of them
1055.16s: for
1055.96s: 99 so then let's say that we got those
1059.64s: for 99 cents 5,000 of them and then
1063.32s: let's flip back now to the short calls
1065.60s: look at that same block which would have
1067.60s: been here I see in unwind actually we
1071.12s: can even filter this by the 30s so that
1072.92s: we can look at that exact
1075.12s: block down here
1079.16s: and let's look at that exact
1083.40s: expiration is this and let's see what
1086.56s: happened absolutely enough here to
1089.60s: unwind that entire position potentially
1093.68s: there's not enough money made in my
1097.20s: opinion so we would obviously have to
1099.36s: filter the stuff that went on after the
1102.24s: original date so again if we flip back
1104.48s: to those calls the long calls you'll see
1107.44s: that they were put on what the 26 I said
1110.52s: so then looking at stuff that would have
1112.88s: been put
1114.08s: on or taken off after the 26 so we have
1117.12s: to go to the 27th 28th those are
1119.56s: essentially your choices
1121.64s: here and let's see total size that would
1124.04s: have came down it would have been enough
1126.44s: but if we look at the total proceeds
1129.12s: from the positions it's just not enough
1133.92s: it's less than a million dollar and you
1136.88s: also have to take into account the cost
1139.08s: to get into the position which again on
1140.80s: that first block of 5,000 was like a
1142.76s: buck so I am not convinced that we
1147.28s: traded options here in order to
1149.68s: establish the position again it's not
1151.96s: impossible because maybe we were spread
1154.40s: across more strikes or maybe we went
1157.52s: into additional expirations that's the
1160.12s: problem with this stuff is you know
1161.60s: we're kind of piecing together what we
1163.04s: can see but it's not definitive and
1164.64s: there's always going to be holes in all
1166.36s: of this which is kind of the beauty of
1167.72s: it really as I think about it it but
1169.96s: that does matter what I'm highlighting
1172.36s: here is that there's nothing that
1174.04s: overtly jumps out at me and says yes
1176.20s: here's a clear buying pattern and that's
1178.64s: essentially how I found his position so
1180.60s: far that's how I've ran with the
1182.84s: positions I've seen at least in the
1184.20s: options in the cycle as by going through
1185.88s: this process so I don't see
1189.76s: that where does that leave us probably a
1193.08s: combination of things there is a world
1195.16s: where he traded some
1198.92s: calls around his shares you can make a
1200.84s: bit of money that way there's a world
1202.24s: where he could have sold some of his
1203.88s: shares to probably get back into them I
1206.20s: assume but to start causing a potential
1209.28s: wave there's a good chance that he might
1211.40s: have traded some other things I think
1212.92s: that's less likely in terms of other
1214.68s: products my guess is it's a combination
1216.52s: of everything we've seen and talked
1217.88s: about here so far so as always I am
1220.76s: enthralled by this story cannot wait to
1222.76s: see what happens next I think Richard
1224.08s: and I are actually talking about doing a
1225.32s: live stream pretty soon because we're
1226.68s: both just so fascinated and love doing
1228.88s: the investigative work behind this this
1230.20s: is a puzzle we both enjoy looking at
1232.68s: quite a lot with slightly different
1233.92s: perspectives which makes it even more
1235.64s: fun to share perspectives we will see
1239.36s: what happens as always be an outlier let
1241.32s: me know if there's anything I should
1242.32s: look at see you guys later
