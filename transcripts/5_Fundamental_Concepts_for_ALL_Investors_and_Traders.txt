0.06s: back to the basics I'm going to walk you
2.58s: through five investing and trading
4.44s: fundamental concepts that I lean on very
7.74s: heavily for my own success and it's
9.72s: centered on one General concept
11.52s: Brilliance at the basics you've heard me
14.16s: say this before because in the Marine
15.54s: Corps we deploy it all the time we are
17.76s: focused on the skill sets that have the
20.28s: highest probability of application and
22.32s: what really lead to Ultimate success
24.54s: that is all trading is about now it's
27.60s: kind of Nefarious because in trading we
29.40s: start from a point where you go through
31.08s: this big cycle the first part of the
33.18s: cycle is you don't know anything you
34.56s: learn a few fundamental concepts but you
36.48s: can't really deploy them effectively
37.74s: think if you pick up a new sport think
39.48s: if you're playing basketball this is
40.86s: when you can't really dribble the ball
41.94s: well you can't really hit a jump shot
43.50s: because your form sucks those kinds of
45.06s: things then we learn a bunch of stuff
46.92s: now we know all different strategies
48.54s: different products and we're starting to
50.58s: get it together but you don't really
52.92s: have a bunch of success this is kind of
54.96s: like in basketball when you're trying
56.58s: all these different things you're trying
57.96s: to play Down In the post now you're
59.34s: playing up as a guard hard now you're
60.90s: trying to get really good at passing
62.34s: you're trying to find what works for you
63.78s: then at the other end of this we kind of
66.36s: start returning back to very basic
68.52s: concepts that we can execute
70.14s: exceptionally well that is what I want
72.78s: to focus on in today's session so what's
75.12s: up everybody Eric here welcome back to
76.92s: all the outliers a huge shout out to the
78.96s: YouTube members and the patreon family
80.34s: thank you guys so much for the support
81.90s: and let's get right into this video now
84.78s: the first thing I want to start with
86.16s: actually is is this this is one of my
88.50s: favorite things this is from
90.20s: goodreads.com it's a pretty cool website
92.70s: but I just really like this quote and
94.38s: it's something that I think about pretty
95.76s: regularly so let's check it out it is
98.40s: from Leonardo da Vinci and it says
100.20s: Simplicity is the ultimate
101.94s: sophistication this goes back to exactly
104.10s: what I was just talking about it's this
105.78s: idea of trying a lot of different things
107.76s: then distilling it down to the simplest
110.10s: Concepts that you can deploy extremely
113.64s: well that will take you much further
115.74s: than trying to reinvent all of these
118.26s: crazy ideas and thinking that you're
121.20s: gonna be the one some people will some
123.30s: people can develop a brand new strategy
124.98s: carve new ground and do really well I am
127.50s: stoked for them I am here to make money
129.84s: that's what I care about what gets me to
132.36s: that goal most efficiently and we're
134.52s: going to talk about that to get us
135.90s: started let's take a look at the first
138.48s: one and you'll notice that there are
140.52s: going to be action items for each one so
143.22s: I'm going to walk you through the
144.24s: concept and then I'm going to give you a
145.86s: specific action item that applies to
148.26s: that concept so that you have clear
149.76s: takeaways through this whole thing so
151.26s: the very first one risk first you can't
153.06s: trade no money this is probably one of
155.34s: the most slept on overlooked Concepts
157.62s: that I can conceive of for Traders and
160.38s: it's because we're too worried about the
161.76s: profits we're thinking more about how
163.44s: much money we're gonna make what we're
164.82s: gonna do with all the money we're gonna
165.96s: make all of those kinds of things and it
168.30s: leads to taking on too much risk and
170.22s: losing money so what is the action item
172.80s: here it's pretty simple every single
174.60s: trade in your entire portfolio as a
176.88s: whole must always have defined risk this
179.64s: does not not mean you can only trade
181.86s: risk defined strategies like vertical
183.96s: spreads that's not what I mean if you
185.94s: buy stock every single stock transaction
189.12s: that you make before you even enter it
191.22s: should have a predetermined loss if you
194.76s: bought a stock at ten dollars your risk
197.16s: is set at seven dollars you're willing
199.38s: to accept that three dollar drop
200.70s: whatever it is for you it should be
202.44s: defined and then there should be no
204.24s: questions asked once you get there it's
206.46s: made its move it's time to get out this
208.26s: is actually why I typically like to use
209.76s: two stops I have a first threshold this
212.28s: is kind of want to really take a look at
213.90s: something see if I want to stay in or
215.88s: get out at that point and then I have a
217.44s: hard threshold this is when I'm just
219.36s: wrong I'm just wrong and it's time to
221.22s: get out that is probably one of the most
223.50s: pivotal changes somebody could make as a
225.72s: Trader is taking the effort to Define
227.70s: every single trade now as a portfolio
229.80s: you might have single trades let's say
232.26s: you have 30 single trades and you start
234.00s: losing on all of them well that means
235.74s: that your whole portfolio is going to be
237.48s: suffering you've got to Define it for
239.04s: the portfolio too this is because if
241.14s: it's going to tell you a lot of stuff so
242.70s: in that same example if you have 30
244.08s: trades and 20 of them start losing your
246.48s: portfolio draws down 30 which it should
249.12s: not do but let's say it does draw down
250.86s: 30 now you're looking at it saying oh
253.02s: man what's going on here here's the deal
254.82s: I can already tell you you have 20
256.32s: trades that are behaving way too
258.66s: similarly at the same time your
260.82s: portfolio risk is massive even though
263.46s: you think you're doing a good job
265.08s: bucketing all of these different trades
267.24s: maybe managing the risk in each
268.92s: individual trade it needs to make sense
270.60s: at the trade level and then as an entire
272.34s: portfolio next one making a plan you've
275.22s: heard me talk about this a million times
276.54s: but I like to use an example here if you
279.18s: think about a sports team or a business
281.04s: What entity typically wins is it the
284.46s: entity that just kind of starts
286.38s: something spontaneously and then tries
289.26s: to figure it out as they go day by day I
292.26s: can't think of a successful entity that
294.42s: operates that way sure you can have
296.10s: spontaneous components to what you do
297.84s: however if you do not take the time to
300.78s: plan you are going to get eaten alive it
303.66s: is important to remember who is in the
306.06s: stock market and it's a lot of people
308.16s: who want your money and they're willing
311.28s: to put in the time to plan they're
312.78s: willing to put in the time to research
314.76s: what you do so that they can capitalize
317.28s: on it as efficiently as possible I have
319.38s: a video in the notes below that talks
321.18s: about Wall Street versus retail and
323.52s: there's some really important different
325.38s: concepts and approaches that I think you
327.54s: need to be aware of so with that what's
329.46s: the action plan you gotta create a
330.96s: trading plan I will throw a video in the
332.82s: show notes below the whole idea of a
334.98s: trading plan is it gives you a few
337.20s: things one it gives you a mental
339.12s: exercise to actually think something
341.52s: through as best you can from start to
343.56s: finish news flash the first one you do
345.48s: is gonna suck that's why it needs to
347.28s: evolve over time as you learn more but
350.22s: going through that painful process will
352.68s: save you a lot of money and it will
354.30s: actually help you make a lot of money
355.92s: because the second thing is you will
357.90s: start to control for variables that you
360.42s: can then optimize and make them better
362.34s: that is how you make money long term in
364.50s: the market next one simple strategies so
366.78s: like I said Simplicity ultimate form of
368.88s: sophistication Brilliance at the basics
370.62s: we kind of talked about this at the
371.88s: beginning so what does this mean I'm
373.38s: talking about exploring efficiently like
375.84s: I said we we all go through this cycle
377.70s: where we don't know a lot and suck at
379.56s: deploying whatever we know we start
381.00s: learning things start to figure it out
382.32s: and then we kind of refine back down you
384.60s: have to go through that phase just about
386.22s: everybody does you have to figure out
387.48s: what it is so when I say explore
388.86s: efficiently that doesn't mean don't try
390.66s: the complex strategies but it's to
392.94s: remember that you are going to want to
395.34s: be able to distill anything you do down
398.22s: to the simplest Concepts that will get
400.86s: you much further than having this crazy
403.68s: list of criteria that your one trade has
406.32s: to hit in order for it to work sixty
408.48s: percent of the time you're gonna realize
410.16s: that's really difficult to find and put
412.08s: on for the long run again if we're
414.00s: trading successfully this should be a 40
416.28s: 50 60 year long Endeavor begin with the
420.18s: end in mind it is completely fine to try
422.70s: all different kinds of things I
424.26s: encourage you to however start taking
426.60s: clear notes on what's working for you
428.58s: and then start distilling that down into
430.50s: the basic concepts so that you can
432.54s: really spend time building what is
434.28s: actually working for you as compared to
436.14s: just trying all these neat new things
437.82s: that you see every day because they're
439.14s: going to be there the next one tracking
440.94s: results so as we're talking about
442.50s: exploring efficiently we've already have
444.24s: a trading plan started you have to
446.22s: create a supporting data set think about
449.22s: the movie Moneyball where they
451.32s: essentially started bringing statistics
452.76s: into baseball and people are like what
454.26s: do you mean you're going to get rid of
455.22s: this big name dude that plays baseball
457.26s: really well legs are gone great we'll be
460.08s: lucky to get 60 games out of you why do
462.24s: you like him
464.58s: because he gets on base and you're
466.38s: getting this guy when the guy's like
467.52s: well because he gets on base what
469.38s: they're talking about is creating an
471.90s: objective data set to make better
474.24s: decisions literally every successful
477.54s: entity does this data-driven decision
480.72s: making is massive and it's because of
482.94s: how fallible the human psyche is but
485.28s: then there's no more guesswork if you're
487.26s: trading short strangles and you're like
488.94s: well is it better to trade 35 days or 20
491.22s: days I'll tell you what's not the
492.78s: correct answer to see what tastytrade
494.94s: says in their research and then just
497.10s: trying to copy that that doesn't work
499.38s: and the that's not on
500.88s: tastytrade I like them overall but they
503.64s: have a specific business and they have a
505.50s: specific way of going about that
507.06s: business the best possible way to create
509.46s: success long-term trading is to create
511.68s: your own data set and this is going to
514.38s: fit neatly into your trading log which
516.42s: again I will throw a video in the show
518.94s: notes below so that you can figure out
520.56s: how to do the trading plan and the
522.30s: trading log all right the last one here
524.04s: reviewing and optimizing our iron
526.62s: sharpens iron and remaining relevant two
529.74s: different things the first thing iron
531.42s: sharpens iron this is another thing we
533.22s: say in the military I actually think
534.48s: it's biblical in nature but what we're
536.04s: talking about is being receptive even
538.62s: once you know what you're doing being
540.24s: receptive to feedback being receptive to
542.22s: looking at your own work acknowledging
544.26s: the fact that there might be a better
546.12s: way to do it and continually looking for
549.18s: that this is why you see people like
550.86s: Kobe Bryant in the gym working his ass
553.98s: off rest in peace but working his ass
556.20s: off even though here it had a bunch of
557.88s: rings and it's because he was still at
560.22s: it he was still at the drawing board he
561.90s: was still wanting to sharpen every
564.00s: single piece of his game that is the
566.04s: same thing for trading if you want to be
568.14s: successful and then the second part here
569.64s: is remaining relevant this might sound
571.38s: weird but things change things change
573.48s: over time the perfect example this past
575.58s: week in the newsletter outlier insights
577.86s: it's completely free if you're not
579.18s: signed up again that's also in the notes
580.80s: below but I was talking about uh post
583.32s: earnings announcements drift which is
585.90s: after we have an earnings announcement
587.58s: with a big move a big beat or loss the
590.28s: underlying tends to track in that
592.02s: movement that's already changed whereas
594.42s: large liquid underlyings very much now
597.54s: do not follow what we used to see them
600.36s: do and it's because things change
601.98s: markets change information changes you
604.74s: have to stay relevant you are going to
606.54s: be in for a rude awakening if you think
609.42s: the one thing you do now is gonna work
612.48s: for that 50 60 year long Runway that
615.18s: we're hoping for you've got to stay
617.22s: relevant you've got to continue looking
618.84s: at what you're doing evolving to the
620.64s: current markets looking for the next
622.26s: effective approach because it continues
624.12s: to change over time so with this you
626.52s: have to create a priority list and what
628.20s: I mean by that is what matters to you
629.94s: what are we trading for what are we
631.80s: attempting to accomplish and then based
634.20s: on that priority list we're going to
635.82s: create metrics that assess our progress
639.12s: towards towards those priorities and
640.86s: then we're going to set a Cadence to
642.06s: review them I like to look at things
643.56s: Loosely they daily weekly and Loosely I
647.10s: mean just kind of going through my notes
648.54s: no specific structure I kind of have a
650.52s: routine built over time but it's just a
652.86s: cursory overview and there's a handful
654.42s: of things I'm looking for what stood out
656.22s: what outliers do I have for profits
658.20s: losses hold times compared to my trading
660.48s: plan all of those sorts of things but
662.10s: then I have a in-depth monthly review
664.20s: where I actually built a checklist that
667.02s: I go through line by line in Excel and
669.78s: track my results so that I can review
671.52s: them month over month to make sure that
673.32s: I'm in Pursuit successfully of my annual
675.66s: goal my two year goal my five-year goal
678.24s: you believe it my 10-year goal I'm going
680.76s: out 10 years and I'm measuring my
682.80s: performance monthly against that is it a
684.90s: perfect science no sometimes you hit
686.58s: them sometimes you don't but I need to
688.14s: make sure I'm trending in the right
689.22s: direction and that is an incredibly
690.72s: important exercise so if there's
692.52s: anything that I missed throw it in the
694.50s: comments below also I'm curious what's
696.48s: your favorite out of this maybe I'll do
698.34s: a specific video that dives into that a
700.26s: little bit more but until next time be
702.00s: an outlier see you all later
