0.00s: Option volatility, it's super straight forward.
2.96s: There's really no need for a video on it because you already know the difference
7.20s: between implied realized, future realized, forecast, historic
12.48s: altilities. That all makes sense to you. Am I right?
15.04s: You're anything like me when I first started out trading that all probably sounds like a bunch of
18.88s: nothing. So the goal of this video is to walk through all of those to give you at least a surface
25.12s: level understanding of these different kinds of volatility because they are different things
28.72s: so that you understand how this all fits into options markets. What's up everybody?
34.00s: Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers and shout outs of the Patreon family.
37.36s: You guys make content like this possible. If what I do helps you out, consider signing up.
42.16s: Let's get started. So we have option volatility. What is volatility? Well, really it's just a
48.88s: fancy term for deviation or dispersion. What does this mean? Simple. If you take a look at this
54.96s: chart of Microsoft, you see these linear regression channels. I have a video on those actually
60.72s: I'll throw in the notes below, but this middle line here is kind of like a line of best fit
65.92s: for all of the data on this chart. So when we move up above or down below, that's dispersion from
73.12s: whatever this mean is. So that's what we're talking about. The variance of something. And in this
80.88s: case in trading, we're specifically referring to different securities. So let's talk about the
86.64s: common types of volatility. There is implied historic realized future realized and forecast.
94.00s: We're going to go through all of these quickly so that you have a working understanding of these.
98.32s: And then at the end of the video, I'm going to walk you through some of the common scales for
102.40s: implied volatility because if you're an obfuscist trader, that will be important to you to understand
106.88s: the difference between implied volatility rank and implied volatility percentile because they're
111.68s: not the same thing. So let's start with implied volatility. In short, this is expected volatility
118.96s: for various time frames that we infer from an options price. So because I was looking at Microsoft
125.92s: before, we're going to keep looking at Microsoft. And we can figure out what the implied volatility
131.44s: is for every single one of these options. That's what this column is here for the put side and this
136.32s: column here for the call side. The reason why this matters is because if you think about trading
142.96s: options, they have two different pieces to their premium. They have intrinsic and extrinsic value.
151.12s: Implied volatility lives in the extrinsic value, the time value of an option. So we can isolate
159.92s: what the implied volatility is per strike. We can look at the implied volatility per expiration
166.80s: cycle. So for example, again, looking at Microsoft, the 15 December expiration cycle, the implied
172.48s: volatility there is a 21.25 percent that infers a 12.96 expected move within one standard deviation.
181.36s: That's all this is. So it is the expected movement of something. So implied volatility has a lot of
188.72s: uses to us. Now what is historic volatility? It measures the realize volatility for a specific
196.56s: period. So if we go back here and we look at Microsoft and we look at something like this,
204.00s: this little handy dandy volatility thingscript that I use and kind of modify it quite a bit over time.
211.20s: But if you notice there is hv2 hv5 hv21, this is historic volatility for different time frames.
220.16s: So you can isolate what the volatility was for specific time frames. Now realize volatility
227.44s: in can be a couple things. When we're talking about realize volatility in general parlance in
233.12s: general speak, it is the volatility that's realized in the underlying. It's also known as the
238.32s: statistical volatility. A lot of times these two will be used interchangeably and that's okay
244.24s: as long as we understand that realize volatility can also be future realized volatility. What the
252.40s: hell is that? Well, this is the realized prediction of future vol and this is different than forecast
262.32s: volatility, which is the prediction of future volatility. So think of it this way, we can forecast
268.64s: volatility if you have an implied volatility surface and you're a sophisticated trader, you create
273.68s: your own assessment of volatility of just forecast volatility. Most options traders, especially on
280.16s: the retail side, we are dealing with implied volatility. This is volatility that is derived from
285.92s: the options price. So the smart people in the market are looking at their forecasted volatility and
293.44s: then us retail traders are looking at what's implied via the pricing of an option. Then you can
300.32s: assess future realized volatility, which tells us how accurate the prediction was of fall.
308.96s: Makes sense? Good. Great. Let's now talk about some implied volatility scales. The reason why
316.88s: this matters is if we take a look at Microsoft here and we look at the current implied volatility,
324.80s: which is 21%, 21.29%, is that higher low? You can't really tell because if there's nothing to
333.68s: compare it against, you can have things that have 130% implied volatility that's actually not very high
342.00s: relative to what that specific products implied volatility typically is. Again, if you think about
348.40s: volatility as the dispersion of things, if we look at the implied volatility for Microsoft, it's
353.60s: 21.29%. And then if you look at it for Tesla, it's 49%. So we expect Tesla to be a little bit more
361.84s: volatile than Microsoft. But when we look at this 49% is this high relative for Tesla, well,
367.68s: this is exactly why we need things like IV rank and IV percentile. Now there's a big difference
373.60s: between these two. And in my opinion, IV percentile is a much better metric that is less prone to skew.
382.48s: Why is that? Well, let's take a look at how implied volatility rank is calculated. We have the
387.20s: current IV. We subtract the 52 week IV low. Then we divide that by the 52 week IV high less the 52
396.24s: week IV low. So what you'll notice is we're using the extremes. We're using the high. We're using
401.68s: the low. Now in typical markets, the difference between IV rank and IV percentile is not that crazy.
410.40s: However, when we are in more extreme markets, this can be massively different, which I'll show you
416.80s: in just a second. But before that, let's take a look at what IV percentile is. Instead of using
422.16s: the extremes, we take account of trading days that are below the current IV. Then we divide that
430.40s: by the number of trading days. So typically you use something like 252. So this is just looking at
436.16s: a pure tally. It doesn't really care what the extremes were, what it cares is where we are
442.72s: relative to its previous performance. Now, a fun fact. This is from think or swim. And the current
449.68s: IV percentile here actually is IV rank. This is completely wrong. And you'll see that in just a
455.92s: second because I want you to do the math for both of these. Why do we why do we have to go through
461.60s: this every time? This one's a little more difficult. You kind of can do the math on your own. I have
465.84s: a think script for it. But I do want you to do the math for the IV rank for this. And then throw
472.40s: it in the comments below what you got before I click on to see if you are correct. Now, you'll see
478.96s: that if we do the math on this, the IV rank for this scenario, the current IV is 19.38%. So that's
486.48s: this here. Then we're going to take the 52 week IV low, which is from here 0.177. Then we're going to
492.40s: divide that by the 52 week IV high, which is 0.442 less 52 week IV low again 0.177. And you're going to
500.16s: get 6.3%. Notice that this happens to be the same in this scenario. So what am I referring to then
508.08s: when we're talking about them being quite different? Simple. In this example, the IV percentile
514.80s: currently for this product, which was Apple is 5%. So if this is actually IV percentile, this
522.16s: should be 5%, not 6%. But this is actually IV rank. Now, this doesn't seem like that big of a
530.16s: difference because it's not. The market has been relatively consolidated for periods of time now.
535.36s: However, if you look at old performance, this is an OG video of Eric. Check that out. Some Eric
542.56s: conception. This was during COVID. And I don't remember what product I was looking at here. But
547.92s: the important part is if you look at the IV rank in this scenario, whatever it was, it was 30.26%.
555.04s: However, IV percentile was 66%. So during COVID, when there's a lot of volatility, this is literally
563.04s: two times. That's a massive difference. When we're looking at things now, it's not that big of a
568.48s: difference because things are relatively low. So you're not going to see that big of a skew. But
572.72s: it's important for you to know that IV rank is much more skew prone than IV percentile. You
579.60s: are going to get a better assessment of IV's performance against itself in an individual product via
586.24s: percentile versus IV rank. That is the long and short of it. So as always, if you have any questions,
592.96s: hit me up. Let me know. Make sure you hit up think or swim. Let them know that they're wrong. I've
596.96s: let them know this a million times. They don't change it. But who knows? Maybe Schwab will get it
601.60s: together and fix it for us. But otherwise, you should know that that is not IV percentile. That's
606.00s: rank and it is prone to skew. If there's anything I missed, throw it in the comments below. Don't
610.24s: forget like, subscribe, share, be an outlier. It's the only way to be. Catch you all later.
