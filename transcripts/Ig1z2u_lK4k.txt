0.00s:  As a trader, you are taught to diversify, even as an investor. This is one of the basic concepts
5.68s:  of building a robust approach to investing as an umbrella. However, like most things in markets
11.52s:  and trading specifically, there's a lot of nuance. And in that nuance is the potential to
16.80s:  really increase your returns or really hurt your returns. So the goal is videos to walk through
22.48s:  that exact nuance. I want to walk you through the process of building a diversified options portfolio
28.72s:  specifically built around your use case as an individual because not all diversification
35.84s:  is created the same and that has to be kept in mind. So let's start first with just defining
42.80s:  this idea of diversification. And there's basic definitions and then there's common use definitions.
49.36s:  We're going to use the common use definition here. It's more practical. This is essentially where you
53.44s:  spread your money, your investments across different asset classes. And the idea is as some
60.24s:  asset classes are doing well, others won't be doing well and they'll kind of balance each other
64.48s:  out and reduce some of the overall risk. However, with options, as you know, options add complexity
69.44s:  and more elements to a trade and we can achieve even greater types of diversification when we do
76.80s:  trade options. So the first thing that I want to start with really it's the first two things on
82.32s:  this list. Three things is we really want to understand what our current assessment is of the
90.08s:  market. The reason for that is if we're going to tailor and customize our diversification approach
97.44s:  to suit the current market needs, we have to have an understanding of what the current markets are
103.04s:  and what we want our portfolio to look like. A great example last year in 2024. In the beginning
108.64s:  of the year, I was long small caps because I was expecting rate cuts earlier in the year based on
115.04s:  positioning and then after a couple of months it ended up not happening. So then I had to pivot
120.32s:  that position into other things that were more topical and relevant to the market as it sat at
124.96s:  that time. So that's based on an economic and stock market analysis and then updating that analysis.
132.40s:  You have to start with that because for example, if you're really, really bullish, that will lead to
137.92s:  one portfolio structure as compared to if you're kind of bullish, but you're kind of nervous about
142.16s:  a downturn. So that will lead to another which blends beautifully into the second thing on this list,
147.92s:  which is that of purpose. A lot of times people default into doing things because it sounds smart
154.80s:  or it's something that they've been told that they should do. So then we just kind of start doing
159.44s:  it without really thinking about the purpose and does it apply to us. So what this means is if we
164.48s:  are thinking about building a diversified portfolio, what is the actual purpose for you? Great example.
170.96s:  Let's say that you're really, really bullish, you think the market's going to go up a lot and you're
175.76s:  just typically taught to diversify, but you're an active trader so you're going to use momentum,
181.36s:  moving averages and stuff like that to scale in and scale out of your position, which inherently
185.36s:  manages your risk. So then you might say to yourself, well, I don't actually really want to diversify
190.24s:  that much because if I have a bunch of different non-correlated returns and I get the move that I
195.68s:  think is going to happen, the stock market's going to go up a lot, well, I'm not really going to
198.96s:  benefit from that as much. And I'm already going to manage risk to the downside by scaling out of
204.00s:  positions, getting hit at stop losses and stuff like that. So when we're talking about this idea
209.28s:  of diversification, it's really, really important to define what you're doing and why. So some common
216.40s:  uses for diversification, the first one you already heard is absolutely to reduce portfolio risk
222.88s:  where we have some things that make money at a point in time and other things that might be losing
227.60s:  money at that same point in time. And they kind of offset one another a little bit. The second
231.52s:  purpose is actually more appropriate for somebody like me where I primarily am managing risk through
238.40s:  sizing and the actual management of the strategy. So the second purpose is if we're trying to trade
246.24s:  any kind of market condition. So that means when the market's going up, down sideways,
251.28s:  broad market trends, you have to have different kinds of things in your portfolio to take advantage
258.32s:  of different market forces that are going on at a given point in time. Great example right now.
263.36s:  It's the middle of January as of making this video. And things like quantum computing just got
270.48s:  crushed because of the CES keynote speech. And a lot of names like RGTI and so on and so forth,
277.20s:  they got slammed after that. And they started making a little bit of a recovery. So there might be
282.48s:  an opportunity there, specifically in trading the recovery move there. There's also earnings going
288.88s:  on right now, which provides a non correlated return source from volatility. So I'm inherently
294.88s:  diversifying by trading these different kinds of profit mechanisms simply because there are
299.36s:  different things that make sense right now. So that's the second purpose of diversification in my
304.80s:  opinion is to be able to take advantage of different things at the same time. Now when we're deciding
309.28s:  what our diversification is going to look like, we have to decide what our portfolio exposure is going
315.36s:  to look like and what we're comfortable with. The reason why that's so important is because of
319.84s:  reverse planning. It's when we begin with the end in mind. It's where we're visualizing what this
324.96s:  thing is supposed to look like. And then we kind of create a roadmap to get to whatever that end
331.76s:  state is from where we are today. So what that looks like specifically for target portfolio exposures,
336.64s:  we might say I want to earn at least 10% per year. Cool. If I have a hundred thousand dollars,
341.28s:  that tells me I need to make a certain amount on average every single month in order to hit that
346.48s:  at the end of the year. So then I can figure out what my portfolio exposure needs to be based on
352.32s:  my risk management plans, both profit and loss for all of the trades that I'm going to put on because
356.96s:  like a good trader, you are defining that before you enter your position. So you can see how many
361.36s:  positions you need to have on at a given point in time in order to maintain that slide slope. That's
366.08s:  the purpose here. So now let's talk about the actual elements of diversification within options.
372.24s:  There's a bunch of them. You've already heard me use the term correlation a few times. This is
376.08s:  the relationship between two different securities. One thing to know about correlation is that it is
383.36s:  not static. A great way to visualize this is if we pop over to the platform and we take a look at
389.20s:  Bitcoin and E-minis. We literally talked about this on our livestream not too long ago. So that's
393.84s:  why it's up. And I want you to take a note of the correlation across all these different time frames.
399.28s:  So this is using a three day five day 10 day 30 day 60 90 180 360. And let's take a look in the
406.96s:  short term correlation. If I eyeball this short term correlation, I see three day and five day,
413.04s:  it's like 95%. However, if I go out here to a 30 day correlation, it's actually like 57%. And then
420.64s:  if I go out again to a 360 day correlation, it's like 90%. So what I'm showing you is the relationship
427.04s:  between these tickers changes. So then when we're analyzing correlation, we need to do two things.
433.36s:  We need to make it relevant to the time frame we're trading. But then you also need to look at it
437.28s:  across different time frames to have a sense. So like this is a great example. Even though there's
441.92s:  one period where it's like 57% correlated, which is on the lower end, in general, it's above 70.
449.20s:  So it's generally correlated. There are periods where that correlation becomes dislocated, but
454.08s:  that's pretty constrained here. That's the point. Next, we have the direction. One of the beautiful
459.52s:  things about trading options is you can trade things in all different directions with different
464.08s:  kinds of strategies, which is the next bullet point. We kind of blend these two together. So with
468.56s:  direction, I can trade things up down sideways. With strategies, I can trade things with long premium
475.92s:  or short premium. Long premium will be undefined profit. Defined risk. It will suffer things like
482.72s:  Theta decay. It will be think long gamma, think like that. Short options or short premium will have
489.52s:  defined profit, undefined risk. It will be collecting theta, which benefits the position. And the way
498.48s:  that those trades perform over different time frames will be very different. So you'll see in a
503.68s:  little bit when we get into an example, we can build something that blends all this stuff together.
508.64s:  So as I've already noted, we can go across different kinds of aspirations. And we can also trade
514.64s:  tickers of varying volatility levels. One of the things you will have heard if you sell premium
519.84s:  frequently is, oh, you know, you got to look for stuff that's high volatility to sell. Well,
524.40s:  that might be okay, but there's a lot of drawbacks to that because if you build a portfolio where
529.60s:  you're selling premium only in high volatility tickers, guess what? Your portfolio is going to be
534.24s:  super volatile. That's what volatility is. So if you're okay with that, cool. But if you're not
539.52s:  okay with that, then you have to consider what you're building. Let's talk about some common
543.44s:  mistakes. These are pretty simple, but defaulting to a specific kind of strategy. The issue with this
549.28s:  is you start to stack things together. And then you have a portfolio that kind of looks like one
554.00s:  thing. So let's say you like to sell puts. If all you do is sell puts, you're going to have a bunch
558.40s:  of stuff on that is defined profit, undefined risk, and is going to be probably giving you some
564.80s:  pain potentially from something like gamma. So even if you prefer to sell, that's fine, not my
570.72s:  approach, but it's fine as long as we're including some other kinds of strategies to help offset
576.08s:  some of that concentration. Next, super, super simple is miss sizing trades in the overall portfolio.
584.40s:  This is what happens when we're too focused on the profit side of the equation, and we're not
589.44s:  paying attention to the risk side of the equation. And then the last super common mistake is when
594.88s:  we do not think about how the trade is going to behave over its lifespan. So what that means,
601.20s:  again, going back to the short put example, if you're trading a bunch of short puts and you're just
605.28s:  thinking about the credit that you're going to collect in how it's a high probability trade,
608.88s:  but you're not realizing the fact that as you hold short puts, gamma, big moves in gamma,
614.16s:  can really cause a lot of volatility in the portfolio, which can be unnerving if you're not
619.28s:  thinking about it. That's the kind of stuff we're talking about here. Now, let's talk about a step
623.76s:  by step process to build your very own diversified options portfolio. First thing, we start by establishing
631.84s:  goals. Next, we come up with our current disposition for the economy and the stock market. This
637.36s:  informs how we are going to use our portfolio. How much do we want to use? How do we want to split it
644.08s:  up? We can use things like beta waiting to put the risk of whatever you're looking at in the
649.92s:  context of a single underlying. I have a video that talks all about beta waiting. I'll link to that
655.60s:  in the notes below. For me, I then allocate. I figure out how much money is going to go into my
661.68s:  core and speculative allocation. If you don't split your portfolio up like I do, this is essentially
667.04s:  where you divvy up your money, where you're going to put it into what trades and why. If you're
671.20s:  curious how I manage a portfolio, I have a link to that. I will throw that in the notes below.
676.32s:  Next, we start figuring out the individual strategies that we're going to put on to make sure that
682.48s:  we have a mix of different directional plays if you want that we have long and short premium
689.04s:  trades if you want. Notice, I'm saying if you want, because again, this is relative to your
695.20s:  perception of the current market. Another example, using the short put example. Let's say that
699.84s:  you really like selling short puts in spy. That's pretty much what you do. If you're expecting a big
705.44s:  market contraction for some reason, whatever that reason is based on your research, you might not
710.88s:  want to have all of your portfolio in short puts because the risk reward profile on that starts to
717.04s:  become skewed if that risk ends up being realized. This is exactly why you have to start and go
724.08s:  in this order to make sure everything that you're doing is aligned. Next, we need to identify the
729.52s:  tickers, the kinds of tickers that they are. One of the great things you can use when you're analyzing
733.84s:  different tickers is you could take a peek at the beta. The beta tells you how does it move in relation
741.28s:  to the market and in general, we use the S&P 500 to represent the market. So spy will be one. If I
747.20s:  take a look at QQQ, you'll notice that the beta is 1.3. That tells me that the NASDAQ is more volatile
752.88s:  than the S&P 500. That means if the S&P 500 goes up by a dollar, we might expect the Qs to move
758.40s:  by a dollar 30 up or down, both in favorable direction and non favorable direction. So we need to
764.64s:  identify the tickers that fit in with the broader portfolio. And then I like to spread across some
770.00s:  different time frames. So let's take a look at this. We already gave the example of wanting 10% per
775.68s:  year. Let's say that we're bullish right now, we're risk open, we're ready to use up to 100%
781.20s:  of the portfolio. So we're figuring out what we want to put on. So we're going to use a $100,000
785.60s:  portfolio. We're going to say that we're going to use $60,000 in the core allocation allocating 60%
791.28s:  of it, long beta. That's to track the broader market. And then we have about $40,000 we can use
796.08s:  at no more than 2% risk per trade for other things. So now we start putting the actual strategies on
802.96s:  of this $60,000 that's going to be allocated to the coverage strangle. Maybe I start with $45,000,
809.92s:  leave them 15k to scale. Then I might look at adding some other strategies into the mix here
816.00s:  that allow me to tweak the overall portfolio risk, something like volatility risk premium
822.56s:  trades, which I have a video for that a link below are really great because it's kind of non correlated
828.24s:  returns. They're just going to do whatever they're going to do by themselves, which is beneficial
832.16s:  because it's not going to have a direct relationship with the rest of the portfolio. And then maybe
836.64s:  we have things that are more directly correlated. We're trading like a momentum breakout style strategy.
842.16s:  Again, limiting risk to no more than 2% for this case, no more than 1% for the risk premium
847.36s:  approaches. And for the momentum approaches, we might have three to 10 trades on at a given
852.88s:  point in time with at least 20% of them providing short beta weighted delta's to your core holdings.
859.84s:  This starts to offset things. Now the 20% short is going to be completely variable based on this
865.92s:  thing up at the top, which is your current disposition towards the market. If you don't think the
871.84s:  market's going to go down, you think the market's good where it is, then maybe you don't have any
875.28s:  short because you're not, you don't think the market's going down. But if you start to see the
878.48s:  market rolling over, you start to see short term moving averages, um, faltering on a bunch of
884.08s:  different sectors. We're seeing all the sectors running negative, trending down. Maybe we start
889.12s:  jacking up the number of short holdings we have on this part of it. Maybe we start sizing this down
894.48s:  in order to manage our risk. It's all entirely up to you, but you have to define it. So I want to
900.72s:  show you a cool tool in here, which is thinker swim. We could take a look at this is the risk profile,
907.36s:  but what you can do actually down here is you can move this to your entire portfolio. So what I have
912.96s:  is a bunch of random trades in here, just for an example, and what I'm showing you is I can put my
918.32s:  entire portfolio against something like spy. And I can say based on this hypothetical portfolio where
924.88s:  I'm trading cues so far in MSTR, I can figure out if the S&P 500 drops 10% and goes down to 550,
932.88s:  I would be down 18k. M-I okay with that. Does that feel reasonable? And maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.
942.00s:  So if it does cool, if it doesn't, then maybe I say, well, I'm going to scale down my cues position.
948.16s:  And then if it actually does move down a full 10% not a little bit shy, but we're actually full
952.96s:  10% closer to 540 and we're at 16k at that 10% move, we're like, okay, yeah, that's fine. Based
959.28s:  on my portfolio size, I'm comfortable with that risk. I want a little more beta than the S&P 500 for
964.16s:  a better end of your return. So I'm okay with this. So you can use this tool to assess your overall
969.36s:  portfolio. Okay, lightning round some common questions. The first one is I like to sell premium
976.24s:  do I have to buy? No, you could do whatever you want. The cool part about selling premium is you
979.84s:  can sell premium in counter opposing positions. So you can have short puts that are bullish, you
985.60s:  could have short calls that are bearish. Next one, should we diversify across strategies and
990.24s:  timeframes? Absolutely. I think we covered that here, but the main reason for that is because
994.88s:  different timeframes and strategies will behave differently over their life cycle, which is what
998.96s:  you're supposed to pay attention to here. So absolutely. How do I know if I'm diversified
1003.60s:  effectively? Great question. The first thing we can use is beta weighted delta to make sure that
1008.40s:  the total portfolio makes sense based on our risk. The second is you can model the total risk of your
1014.64s:  entire portfolio like I was just showing you here. You can build this for yourself. Thinkorswim does
1018.72s:  it for you, which is convenient, but if you have a good trade log, which most of you should, you can
1022.72s:  literally build your own graph for this. And it can give you this idea so that you can then say
1027.76s:  based on what I just showed you is this current portfolio setup able to get me to my monthly return
1033.28s:  target? Yes, good. If I get a down move in the S&P 500 of a standard size down move 5 to 10%
1040.72s:  if it's like a big down move, am I okay? Can I consume that risk? Yes. Okay, great. Then you're good.
1045.76s:  If you're not, then you have to make some adjustments. As always, if you have any questions, let me know,
1050.24s:  be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
