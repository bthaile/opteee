0.00s: the best option strategy for busy
2.94s: Traders I went through a pretty
4.74s: significant portion of my trading career
6.60s: on active duty in the Marine Corps which
8.34s: as you probably could guess meant that I
10.08s: had very little control over my schedule
11.76s: yet I still traded for those six and a
14.34s: half years on active duty and it's by
16.26s: doing a lot of this so I want to walk
18.30s: you through the strategy that I used and
20.88s: then I want to specifically get into
22.92s: details on how we can structure it so
25.20s: that it is super simple but still
27.06s: effective what's up everybody Eric here
28.56s: welcome back to all the outliers let's
30.18s: talk about trading some options okay so
32.10s: the very first thing like I already
33.48s: discussed is the concept for this trade
36.30s: is we are willingly sacrificing
39.56s: optimization for Simplicity and what I
42.18s: mean by that is once you set up this
44.22s: strategy which does take time after
46.26s: hours you could literally deploy it
48.78s: within 60 seconds of having access to a
51.84s: computer for whatever the trading period
54.12s: is that you choose which is the next
55.98s: bullet point here that it is flexible so
58.74s: you can choose some something as far out
61.98s: as 680 days Plus or you could select
65.40s: something that's in the weeklies or
67.86s: something that's 11 days out so you can
70.08s: select a time frame that fits your
72.66s: trading opportunity what I will tell you
74.82s: is we want to try and keep them within
77.58s: 60 days that's our typical window that
80.34s: we're looking for and I'll explain why
81.90s: and in case you couldn't tell from the
84.84s: Preamble here the strategy we're going
87.00s: to be talking about is the coverage
89.34s: strangle so the very first thing I want
91.32s: to follow up with there is I'll throw a
93.30s: link in the video description below on
95.58s: how I trade the covered strangle in
97.74s: depth because this is going to be a
99.48s: surface level overview this is going to
101.52s: be way more of me telling what I think
103.92s: works best for me and less of the
107.04s: optimization aspect which takes a lot
109.14s: more time because there are different
110.52s: ways I would trade the covered strangle
112.14s: if I had more time in front of a
113.70s: computer but this video is not for that
116.10s: circumstance it's for the one we're
117.42s: talking about all right so what does
119.58s: this look look like we need to select a
121.50s: ticker up front again I'm not going to
123.24s: go into scanning screening picking the
125.70s: best tickers we're keeping it simple
127.26s: here so for me I would pick anything
129.54s: that you already like for Buy and Hold
132.36s: so if you have a typical Buy and Hold
134.82s: portfolio that you're looking to
136.44s: optimize or enhance just a little bit
138.36s: through options this is really the kind
140.46s: of product that I would be selecting so
142.50s: for me I used index ETFs iwm anybody
145.56s: that follows the channel knows that I
147.06s: trade iwm a lot and there's a handful of
149.28s: reasons for that I'll link to that in
151.32s: the video description below as well but
153.42s: I also would venture into individual
155.40s: tickers I have a few on right now
157.50s: actually today is uh two Feb and I have
160.74s: the covered strangle on in Tesla and
163.14s: Amazon so ice Pfizer I still trade it in
165.78s: individual tickers as well liquidity
167.64s: this is increasingly important depending
169.80s: on how you choose to deal with some of
172.02s: these optional components that we can
174.00s: add on and I'll explain that in a minute
175.62s: but really we just need something that
177.48s: has options you're not going to be
178.98s: interacting with it super much unless
180.66s: you choose to so liquidity becomes less
182.76s: important most of the trades are going
184.44s: to be taken to expiration so you're not
186.18s: worried about a ton of adjustments when
187.92s: we're talking about selecting the option
190.14s: there are a few criteria that are
192.54s: important to us I already mentioned the
194.22s: days to expiration the reason why I like
197.04s: to keep them within 45 days is multiple
199.98s: full the first one is if you take a look
202.32s: on a relative basis so let's say this 45
205.08s: day trade this is using um TD
207.66s: ameritrade's on demand feature by the
209.46s: way so this is back in time really right
211.62s: now we're looking at the market on 4
213.60s: March 2019 because I want to walk
215.58s: through an example with you all so
216.90s: anyways just so that this stuff's going
218.64s: to look different than what it is today
219.96s: because this is back in time so anyways
221.94s: back in March um if we pick something
224.04s: that's 45 days out and let's call it a
226.44s: 30 Delta this 151 you're going to get a
228.66s: dollar and 94 cents if we look at
230.64s: something that's 32 days out at that
232.74s: same 30 Delta it's a dollar and 62 cents
236.34s: so you can see that there's really kind
238.56s: of an incremental loss in time value as
241.44s: we come further and further in the real
243.42s: difference is you're moving slightly
244.80s: closer and closer to the money so what's
246.48s: the point here Theta Decay accelerates
248.52s: the most once it gets within that 60-day
250.80s: window so it's important for us to try
252.84s: to take advantage of that when we can
254.28s: however there are plenty of periods of
256.38s: time where I traded cover strangles that
258.48s: were out 90 days plus because it's I I
260.40s: was at a training exercise it wasn't a
262.02s: choice so it's not an optimal outlay but
264.30s: it's as good as I could get and that
265.74s: happens the other thing to keep in mind
267.12s: is once you go beyond those 45 days
268.86s: notice what happens to the expirations
270.60s: that we have something we have weeklies
272.46s: here then we go to monthlies and
274.32s: quarterlies as you go further out in
276.00s: time liquidity in just the number of
278.16s: options chains available to us changes
280.14s: so the short answer here when it comes
281.76s: to DTE and Delta and strike for days to
284.70s: expiration for both the short put and
286.74s: short call I'm going to be looking
288.12s: ideally 60 days in typically somewhere
290.58s: between 20 and 30. for or I'm sorry 20
292.74s: and 40. for Delta and strike on these
295.20s: shorts puts it's going to be something
296.70s: between a 15 and a 35 Delta more often
299.64s: than then not the reason why I select
301.68s: those is to capitalize on the variance
303.60s: risk premiums there are slight
305.28s: differences based on the expiration but
307.32s: we're keeping it simple so anything
308.64s: between there is fine and the strike
310.74s: price I'm talking about this more
312.48s: specifically for the short calls I'm
314.46s: less concerned with the Delta on the
316.32s: short calls once the trade is on because
318.06s: once we have the short calls against
321.18s: long stock I'm not really using Delta to
323.70s: select my strike I'm using the strike
325.38s: price against whatever my basis is which
328.26s: I'll show you the beginning of an
329.64s: example which we'll get into later but
331.26s: let's say if I buy 100 shares of or 200
334.74s: shares of iwm at 100 and I sell a one
338.58s: I'm picking this 105 call based on the
342.18s: relationship to my basis here I'm not
344.52s: picking it because it's a whatever Delta
346.38s: the main thing is I don't want to have
348.24s: upside risk so I'm going to avoid
350.64s: selling short calls below my basis
353.10s: because they just turn into a problem
354.78s: more often than not and again we want
356.52s: this hands-free relatively easy the
359.04s: overall way that that this strategy can
360.90s: roll out is once you refine it literally
363.30s: you put the trade on you come back after
365.76s: expiration you see what happened and
368.04s: then you adjust that is it so that's why
370.74s: I select the Deltas and the strike
372.90s: prices based on that we'll talk about
374.28s: Management in just a second I want to
376.26s: talk about some of these optional
377.40s: components so like I said we are
379.14s: prioritizing Simplicity what I'm laying
381.06s: out here is probably one of the absolute
383.22s: simplest versions of this strategy that
385.26s: we can have but if you have a little bit
388.02s: of time you can start layering in just a
391.56s: little more detail it's a little more
393.12s: time consuming but it can have really
395.28s: significant impacts on our profitability
397.14s: and the strategy so for example we can
399.00s: integrate things like using moving
400.44s: averages linear regression channels so
402.54s: to follow that example through if I pop
404.88s: over to the chart and I say okay I see
407.52s: the 150 day in the 50-day these are
409.86s: really the more important moving
411.06s: averages again for a simpler strategy
413.46s: for me I as you can tell I use four
415.86s: moving averages because in my day-to-day
418.08s: normally I have more time I can do this
419.58s: this so I am a little more specific on
422.82s: what I like but in this case again
424.32s: keeping it simple I would use 5150. if
427.20s: the underlying specifically Falls below
429.72s: the 50 I come to a pause meaning I may
432.36s: not add more risk if it falls below the
434.34s: 150 or 200 I would consider either
437.10s: flattening or waiting to add risk until
440.34s: the 50 flattens out so if we follow that
443.76s: move here so we have the 50 that's
445.56s: trending it fell below the 50. so right
447.78s: now let's just pretend we're now paused
450.06s: whatever position we have on we're
451.38s: paused and then price Falls below the
453.42s: 150. now I'm not really wanting to add
455.88s: risk until I see the 50 flatten out and
458.70s: as you notice it's not flattening out
460.26s: it's not flattening out and then in here
461.82s: it starts to flatten out so a couple
463.20s: things happen you're going to have some
464.58s: risk on for this move unless you
466.02s: flattened which is a choice but it
467.76s: essentially keeps you from getting ran
469.56s: over on the way down now we didn't
471.60s: bottom ticket what I mean by that is we
473.94s: hit the low and you miss out on this
476.40s: move from 125.81 all the way back up
479.04s: essentially to 140. that is the lack of
482.76s: specificity but that's why it's so
484.86s: simple there's a trade-off here we're
486.66s: picking very simple moving average
488.88s: protocols but there's going to be a
491.16s: little bit of delay in when they in when
492.60s: they trigger the other thing is linear
493.92s: regression channels so one of the things
495.42s: I like to do is in the same exact
497.46s: example I would integrate once it starts
500.16s: getting below a minus one and especially
503.40s: a minus two linear regression Channel I
506.28s: probably would add a little bit of risk
508.32s: and the way that I modulate that risk is
510.72s: through scaling and I'll talk about that
513.12s: in a second but you can use technical
515.04s: analysis just like that in really really
517.02s: simple ways to help optimize the
519.42s: performance with just a little extra
521.10s: time added or you could say I don't have
523.50s: time for that and that's also fine it
525.30s: will still work just fine and then the
526.80s: last one is rolling Autobots
529.20s: rule out you can choose to roll options
531.90s: I have plenty of videos on that or you
533.52s: could choose not to it really doesn't
535.20s: matter but that is another way you can
537.00s: optimize the profitability of these
539.10s: trades I just rolled a trade recently to
541.74s: increase my overall profit potential by
544.02s: a few hundred dollars I have the time so
546.18s: I did it but you don't have to if you
547.50s: don't have the time let's talk about how
548.88s: this actually looks the management so we
551.22s: talked about identifying the ticker that
553.14s: we like right so we have that we're
554.64s: going to sell a cash secured put there's
556.44s: two scenarios that happen either you get
558.72s: a sign on that cash secured put or you
560.64s: do not that's it if you don't get
562.38s: assigned you can just sell another cash
564.00s: secured put if you do get assigned
565.86s: there's now two more choices available
567.42s: to us we can sell an additional cash
569.94s: secured put if we want to add more risk
572.28s: or we can sell an uncovered call
574.86s: provided we can sell that short call
576.60s: above our basis I know what you're
578.22s: saying Eric why uncovered it's because
580.44s: we don't want to cap our upside
582.84s: potential so our p l graph of a normal
585.66s: covered call will have a flat top at
587.94s: some point when your long shares r equal
591.30s: to the short shares tied into the short
593.58s: call by doing an uncovered call our
596.04s: upside looks like this it remains in
598.98s: upward slope it means that we don't have
600.78s: a Max profit potential on the trade it's
602.94s: unlimited when you're using a hands-off
604.92s: strategy not capping your upside is very
608.22s: very important this is such an important
610.62s: detail that a lot of people Miss because
612.54s: they'll say well covered calls they
614.34s: don't keep Pace with the market what the
616.14s: hell they can if you're smart about it
618.66s: and this is one of those details that
620.04s: makes a big difference and then on that
621.54s: uncovered call if you're assigned it
623.40s: just means you're going to sell the
624.36s: shares at that price and then you just
626.04s: go back to selling cash secured puts if
627.90s: you're not assigned you can choose to
629.70s: continue selling uncovered calls you may
631.98s: get to a point where you can't collect
633.84s: enough premium in order to or I'm sorry
636.48s: you might not be able to sell a short
638.70s: call that gives you really any premium
640.68s: that's above your basis and in that case
642.48s: that's when selling additional coverage
644.22s: cash secured puts or buying additional
646.38s: shares to reduce your average basis is
648.78s: really useful okay last thing I want to
651.18s: talk about are these couple scenarios
652.86s: and then I want to give you an example
654.18s: so in these scenarios if this
656.46s: stop between your strikes meaning the
658.02s: short call and short put you just keep
659.52s: doing what you're doing you just reload
660.96s: come on back if if the stock is above
663.06s: your short call you're going to lose the
664.56s: shares go back to selling more short
666.12s: puts to get the risk back out there if
668.04s: the stock is below your short put you're
669.84s: going to buy additional shares at that
672.12s: strike price keeping the premium that's
673.74s: it that's how this whole thing works so
675.48s: this is one of the best possible ways to
677.58s: optimize a Buy and Hold portfolio so
680.04s: let's take a look at an example here
681.36s: let's say we have a hundred thousand
682.68s: dollar account iwm's trading around 100
684.48s: bucks we decide to include some scaling
687.12s: I think it's a really smooth way to make
689.58s: sure that you have room to adjust your
691.32s: basis if we're in a prolonged down move
693.06s: so for example some scaling protocols
695.40s: you might consider you could have an
697.26s: initial outlay of 70 and then you can
700.14s: have whatever scaling details you want
701.94s: on the way down but the main thing is
703.32s: the initial so what this means is on
705.18s: this one hundred thousand dollars
706.38s: account you can use up to 70 on your
710.04s: first trade that's if we are greater
712.86s: than 20 away from all-time highs in the
715.38s: underlying why do I select this it's
717.72s: because the propensity when we're near
719.70s: all-time highs is you have much farther
721.68s: to move down than when you're near
723.30s: all-time lows but this is important to
725.82s: remember using the moving averages is
727.98s: part of this thought process because
729.66s: something that is decreasing can keep on
732.12s: decreasing for a long time before it
734.10s: slows down so you don't want to run out
735.66s: of money too fast so the other thing you
737.34s: could do is if we're not greater than 20
739.32s: off of all-time highs your initial trade
741.36s: is up to 50 so that means you can use up
743.52s: to fifty thousand dollars on your
744.72s: initial trade okay great that's just an
746.70s: idea I have slightly different
747.84s: variations I've used this in different
749.46s: Market environments based on volatility
751.14s: but this is just a again very simple
753.12s: back of the napkin here's an idea let's
754.98s: talk about the outlay here so on the
756.42s: initial trade we're going to buy 200
757.74s: shares at 100 20K then we're going to
760.14s: sell to open two of the 95 puts at a
762.66s: dollar so we're gonna collect 200 bucks
764.22s: and then we're gonna wrap up another 19k
766.32s: essentially we're just taking whatever
768.60s: the cash secured amount is for this that
770.52s: gives us that 200 credit then I'm gonna
772.32s: sell one 105 call the reason why it's
775.38s: only one is because we have 200 shares
777.72s: and I want uncap profit potential so I'm
780.42s: going to only do one there's a trade-off
782.52s: here the more short calls I sell up
784.92s: front the more money I get the lower my
787.08s: future profit potential the other thing
788.82s: the closer my short call strike is to my
792.54s: actual basis the more money I'm going to
794.76s: collect up front but the less total
796.32s: profit potential the trade will have you
798.00s: got to pick whatever is right for you
799.20s: the next thing is that'll bring in a
801.54s: dollar so it's a hundred dollar credit
802.80s: so overall I brought in three hundred
805.02s: dollars in total credit on the initial
807.00s: outlay of thirty nine thousand dollars
808.98s: and then we have the profit potential
810.78s: for another five hundred dollars in
811.98s: capital gains so overall you're looking
814.50s: at about a two percent return on your
816.30s: money in a month now that's two percent
818.28s: on thirty nine so what do we do with the
820.68s: remaining money that's not being tied up
822.96s: in the trade so we have sixty one
824.28s: thousand dollars that's tied to this
825.84s: that we're not using you have some
827.10s: choices you could use more of it if
828.96s: again if you're a typical Buy and Hold
830.70s: investor you're using most of it anyways
833.34s: because if you're a Buy and Hold
835.08s: investor you have to buy the stock and
837.36s: that's all the capital being outlaid so
839.52s: it's same same the other thing you could
841.38s: do is if you have the time you can set
843.12s: up Ox spreads you can use box spreads on
845.46s: the remaining sixty one thousand dollars
847.14s: in this scenario to earn the risk-free
849.18s: rate while the rest of is being used
850.68s: there are lots of ways to structure this
852.48s: but the name of the game is keeping it
853.86s: simple you should be able to log into
855.12s: the platform you should place your
856.62s: trades takes less than 60 seconds
858.06s: straight up you come back not midweek
860.64s: not mid-month after expiration if it's
863.22s: set up like this it doesn't matter what
865.62s: happens you just come back to see what
867.42s: happened so that you can make the
