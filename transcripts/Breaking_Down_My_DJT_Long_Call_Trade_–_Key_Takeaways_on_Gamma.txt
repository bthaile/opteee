0.32s: what's up outliers I did the exact thing
2.84s: I said typically don't do this and it's
6.20s: from a video called buying call option
8.00s: smarter I'll throw a link to it below
10.12s: but this trade that I put on in djt that
12.92s: made me over
14.16s: $45,000 broke a lot of the rules that I
16.76s: typically follow but I want to walk you
19.08s: through why trading is a game of very
23.20s: carefully building positions that do
25.28s: what we want and in this case it
27.92s: definitely included building something
29.68s: that is
30.48s: very different than my go-to Approach so
33.00s: we're going to walk through exactly what
34.36s: the trade was how it was structured how
36.24s: I managed it and how it made me just shy
38.52s: 50k what's up everyone welcome back to
41.36s: the outliers shout out to the patreon
42.80s: family if you're into trading that kind
44.20s: of thing consider joining up it's a
45.52s: great group and let's get right into it
48.12s: so the trade here is pretty
50.00s: straightforward and it's centered around
52.64s: djt why djt well because this has really
56.08s: become a proxy for the election and if
59.08s: we go back this is a three-year daily
61.04s: chart you can see that djt has been all
63.80s: over the place it's been over 100 it's
66.00s: been down to
67.52s: 1175 and it's rallied back up to just
71.00s: shy of 55 or right around 55 this most
74.64s: recent move that we've had here is
77.48s: literally over
79.04s: 360% a massive move so what ended up
82.60s: happening here was obviously I'm
85.00s: following the overall election
87.08s: probabilities and stuff like that and uh
89.64s: a really curious thing happened so if we
91.80s: go to poly Market here and you take a
94.76s: look at this red line which is the
96.92s: probability of trump winning and if you
99.16s: take a close look this movement looks a
102.44s: heck of a lot like what you see here
104.96s: an't that funny notice how you have this
106.96s: big popup here right around this area
109.52s: then it goes down into this trout and
111.40s: then it starts working its way back up
112.92s: and out this is an important note but
115.36s: specifically I want to draw your
116.56s: attention to this period in here where
118.96s: we can see around the 5th the 6th of
121.36s: October somewhere right around in there
123.60s: we can clearly see that the probability
127.00s: for Trump overtaking Harris starts to
129.76s: move up and if we align that with the
132.80s: first trading day after the 5ifth which
134.64s: would be the 7th notice how we have this
136.80s: pop and then it's been up and away very
139.32s: similar to what you see here interesting
141.88s: isn't that so this has clearly become a
145.76s: proxy for the outcome for the US
148.96s: presidential election
150.68s: and it's a really important note because
152.80s: it means that the fundamentals of this
155.52s: as a security have not changed as an
158.08s: overall brand business they're not doing
160.20s: anything different there's no
161.36s: fundamental new release that they've had
163.44s: to drive new value all of this has
165.52s: become a proxy that means the way that I
168.64s: build a trade in this is going to be
170.64s: very very different than something like
173.76s: Invidia where I think it's going to
176.12s: continue going up longer term even
177.64s: though it's not right now because of the
180.48s: potential it can have to change an
181.84s: industry there's a different value
183.88s: prospect there than something like this
186.40s: so let's take a look at the details now
189.64s: the first thing to note here is that the
191.32s: allocation is actually undefined I do
194.40s: this for smaller positions I don't
196.04s: really care how much money is tied up in
198.00s: the trade because I'm fortunate I have
200.28s: plenty of room to move around I'm not
201.84s: running out of capital at any point in
203.40s: time this is different than when I was
205.32s: trading a smaller account I had to be
206.76s: very careful and actually allocate each
208.96s: trade I don't really do that for a lot
210.96s: of these kinds of Trades anymore now
213.04s: what I do use to manage overall sizing
215.84s: and risk is I use a Max risk limit and
220.48s: in this case I used
222.56s: $155,000 this is a very very small
226.28s: fraction of the account this is for a
228.48s: very specific reason which we'll talk
229.92s: about in a minute why this is such a
232.60s: small amount relative to the total
234.52s: portfolio it's less than a percent and
237.56s: if we take a look at the overall F this
240.88s: is clearly going to live within this
242.60s: speculative allocation this is a highly
245.48s: highly speculative play it's going to be
247.24s: very short term why is it going to be so
249.04s: short term because of the overall idea
253.76s: behind this trade because if we take a
255.60s: look at this again no fundamental change
258.64s: my expectation is that after the
261.92s: election whether good or bad in terms of
264.60s: the outcome for Trump and the way that
267.12s: this stock would prospectively move I
269.48s: think whether he wins or doesn't this is
272.32s: likely going to contract to a degree
275.00s: because it can only go so high based on
277.80s: essentially nothing so that's why this
281.32s: is a very short-term play that's going
283.00s: to be wrapped around the election it's
284.76s: actually was structured very similarly
287.68s: to the way that I do earnings where I
289.88s: want to include the closest expiration
291.96s: that includes the earnings event itself
294.48s: so what's the strategy here this is
296.36s: where things deviate from my normal most
298.40s: people are used to hearing me say
299.96s: something like ratio call diagonal or
301.84s: deep in the money long calls this is
303.76s: different this is a unit play and this
306.72s: is one that I don't use that much as you
308.88s: can tell because I typically talk about
311.08s: not doing this but there are always
313.56s: exceptions to things and this is
315.36s: definitely an exception based on the
317.96s: expected movement that I thought might
320.08s: happen the way I looked at this trade is
322.24s: that it was either going to move enough
325.24s: in my direction that it was going to
327.68s: compound quickly because of long Gam
330.44s: or I was going to lose this 15K that's
332.96s: that's kind of it it was almost a binary
334.48s: outcome in my mind so I'm essentially
338.12s: building a play that's really built
339.88s: around Long gamma that's really what
341.56s: units means in this instance and so what
344.16s: is that in context let me show you if we
347.16s: pop over the platform and we look at djt
351.04s: today which is the 31st of October you
353.48s: can see that there's 15 days to
354.92s: expiration for the 15 no why the 15 no
357.88s: versus the eight no because these these
359.68s: are going to be more liquid that's why
361.68s: so even though this is better exposure
364.44s: to the event itself it's going to take a
366.68s: couple days for the results to come out
369.16s: but then more importantly I need
370.40s: liquidity so that's why I'm here now if
373.48s: we take a look at this notion of
374.76s: building units if let's say I were to
376.80s: buy an at the money call in this case
378.72s: you can get one for like 10 bucks just
380.28s: call it that for Simplicity 10 bucks and
382.76s: if we go all the way out of the money to
384.36s: these 115s you can see let's call it 90
387.20s: cents that they're trading for you can
389.04s: essentially put on 11 of these for every
392.88s: one of these so typically I prefer to
396.76s: pay a little bit more upfront and to buy
399.64s: stuff that's at the money slightly in
401.40s: the money because I'm not necessarily
403.76s: expecting a parabolic move most of the
406.04s: stuff I tend to trade has decent moves
409.12s: but not stuff quite like this now
411.76s: there's another reason for this specific
414.44s: buildout because let's take a look at
417.80s: the max risk you'll notice for the size
420.00s: of the position that I'm going to show
421.52s: you I can't actually hold this
424.60s: indefinitely so having a lower gamma
427.64s: actually I'm sorry having a lower Delta
430.24s: helps me a little bit because the gamma
433.40s: will rapidly build the Deltas if it
435.56s: moves in my favor but because it's
437.28s: already a pretty low Delta if I don't
439.52s: get a directional move in my favor it
441.00s: gives me a little more time to be in the
443.24s: trade so the same reasons why I
444.84s: typically favor the opposite it fits
446.92s: this thesis a little bit better so on
449.28s: the 24th SL 25th it was kind of phased
452.48s: in over two different days I'll zoom in
455.48s: to this specific time frame here and
457.64s: draw it for you so here's the 24th and
460.16s: here's the 25th and it's essentially at
462.64s: the same prices it was just over two
464.44s: days I got the vast majority of the
465.96s: position on the 24th and then I got a
468.00s: little bit more just a little bit more
469.84s: on the 25th so if I look at the core
473.04s: position that was built this is what
475.40s: went on and then in my normal annotation
477.88s: you can see it below so djt was trading
480.28s: around 35 bucks I grabbed 500 of the 15
483.40s: no 115 calls at
486.48s: 78 so this was a moderate Siz position
490.84s: in terms of what the options chain could
492.40s: hold but still not a very large trade
495.44s: altogether the Delta at the time of
497.64s: Entry was a 0.09 gamma was a 0.01 so the
501.60s: outlay for this was about 39,000 bucks
504.88s: and then again for my 15K cap on risk
507.84s: that would let me go to about 30 and A2
511.36s: so if we flip back over to the Chart you
513.32s: can kind of see those two entries and
515.68s: then we had a big gap up onesided rally
518.72s: and then we had this topping day and
522.48s: then we had a bit of a contraction the
524.64s: last two days now before I show you the
526.48s: next part I want you to comment in the
528.16s: video where you think I started phasing
532.32s: out I'm very curious the way that you
534.92s: guys think that I went about it my guess
536.48s: is most of you will have some of it
537.96s: right but some of it wrong and I'll
539.48s: explain why so on the 28th of October
543.28s: djt was around 46 bucks and I sold to
545.96s: close
547.28s: 400 of these for
550.12s: $185 so that brought in 74k total and
555.40s: netting it against the outlay for 400
558.36s: the net p&l for this specific position
560.84s: was 42,800 bucks and that left me with
565.84s: $7,800 in residual risk in the position
568.80s: that was remaining so 100 Lots still at
572.68s: 0.78 so what's going on here why did I
575.32s: do this on the 28th well it's really
577.04s: simple if we take a look at this big
579.76s: giant rally there was a fantastic exit
583.80s: point for me because again if you go
585.28s: back to the original Prospect of this
588.00s: position it was either make some money
591.04s: or lose 15K that was kind of what I was
593.48s: expecting to happen and in this scenario
596.28s: I got a bigger move than I originally
598.92s: anticipated ated and for this kind of
601.56s: profit mechanism which is a really
603.40s: shortterm just insane momentum breakout
606.40s: style play you can't you can't overstay
608.76s: your welcome it is as you could tell
610.72s: like literally as you could tell it is
612.44s: too easy to overstay your welcome so my
615.36s: idea here was take some of it off in
617.64s: case this didn't happen or this didn't
619.60s: happen if it went straight from this to
622.04s: this because there's also a reality
625.20s: about this day because I actually would
627.28s: have preferred to hold it a little bit
628.64s: longer but but fun fact life happens and
631.76s: this is a great example of this because
634.20s: on the 29th I was actually getting an
636.76s: assessment for a herniated disc in my
639.52s: back it was like a six-hour session
641.16s: throughout the entire trading day
642.52s: essentially I was not going to have time
644.68s: to watch the markets on the next day so
647.76s: I managed some of the risk on this day
650.16s: knowing that this position needs
651.92s: attention and I wouldn't be able to give
653.76s: it fully what I needed on this day
655.36s: that's the reality here and I purposely
657.92s: mention that because trading is a mix of
660.68s: adherence to systems but then also
662.84s: interacting it with life and that was
664.92s: going to be the reality for my 29 of
667.68s: October so that leaves me with just over
671.68s: 40K in profit I have 7,800 left to go in
675.48s: risk and that leads me to the 30th so at
679.12s: this point I decide to let the trade go
681.08s: for a little bit see what it does and it
683.60s: starts to consolidate take back down so
686.28s: I sold to close 98 of the remaining 100
690.88s: for $125 so that brings in a net of 4606
695.24s: that takes the total profit here to
698.72s: 47,4 bucks and you'll notice that this
701.92s: is 98 why 98 because I am a degenerate I
706.28s: left two on because I literally couldn't
709.04s: care less to what happens it's like one2
710.96s: 200 bucks total and I just I literally
713.28s: just want to see the fireworks I just
714.52s: want to see what happens so I'm leaving
716.48s: two on literally for the LS the rest of
719.64s: the trade has been done already by
722.08s: making this first original phase out I
725.24s: remove all of this risk immediately from
727.92s: the trade and I still left a little bit
730.52s: on in case I get a decent move there's
733.04s: still 100 lots that could continue to
735.76s: compound because again this was a gamma
738.04s: play and the gamma was just starting to
740.80s: accelerate so that's why I took the
743.84s: first leg down essentially removes all
746.88s: risk of the trade lets it live a little
748.56s: bit longer in in case there's a cool
749.84s: move there wasn't a cool move so take
752.08s: down the residual to maximize value and
755.72s: then leave two options on simply because
760.24s: ytf not so as always if you have any
763.28s: questions let me know be an outlier I'll
764.88s: see yall later
