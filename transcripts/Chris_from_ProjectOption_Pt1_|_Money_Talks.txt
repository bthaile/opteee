44.08s: anywhere there's no username where i
45.76s: could get chris
46.40s: oh yeah i have to you know either
50.32s: or do something that's a little bit more
53.20s: unique
53.76s: and not use my my first and last name so
56.08s: yeah you gotta be like chris butler 99
58.16s: or yeah exactly usually like my
61.04s: instagram was
62.08s: chris butler22 my email i have an email
65.52s: it just
66.24s: basically has my birthday after uh-huh
69.60s: i totally get it i don't get chris
71.36s: butler at gmail
72.88s: is i love that so also
76.40s: funny caveat on that in um in the marine
78.72s: corps i was
79.92s: the only eric erik smalinski
83.60s: except i don't know why but instead of
86.16s: just giving me eric.smolinski
88.48s: at usmc dot mil keep it just my name
91.36s: they made it
92.12s: eric.m which is my middle initial dot
94.64s: smolinski
96.16s: why why would god make this so long man
97.68s: i already got a long long last name and
99.92s: now we gotta have the middle yeah
101.36s: why um cool man so obviously super stuck
105.36s: to have you on the channel like we were
106.40s: just talking about i gave you some
107.68s: context on why i'm doing this you know
109.44s: just the general background and whatnot
111.44s: and you know anybody who's willing to
113.12s: come on and just you know share some
115.04s: time with us is
116.16s: honestly super awesome i get a
118.32s: tremendous amount of super positive
120.00s: feedback from the folks that frequent my
121.84s: channel
122.32s: you know just saying that they're having
123.84s: fun learning and seeing other stuff so
125.28s: obviously thank you for that
127.04s: um i thought obviously good place to
129.60s: start off would be learning a little bit
131.20s: about you you know we didn't dig too far
133.12s: into your background from chicago
135.04s: moved to denver um but i would love to
137.84s: you know dig in your background a little
139.12s: bit what got you
140.08s: into investing when did you start is a
142.08s: good place to start
143.28s: um so it's a good question because my
146.88s: freshman year when i went to college my
149.60s: initial major was computer science
151.84s: okay and that's because when i was in
153.76s: high school i played a lot of video
155.44s: games and i
156.40s: was into computers so i thought that i
158.88s: wanted to do something with computers
160.88s: and i also have a very technical mind
163.52s: which
164.32s: it's no surprise that that translates
166.08s: into options because options are
168.00s: a lot of moving parts but my initial
171.04s: major was computer science and i went to
173.12s: arizona state
174.48s: and then about a party school it is a
177.76s: party school
178.40s: okay i did my fair share of partying but
180.40s: i did not leave asu because i couldn't
182.88s: handle the party i did have some friends
184.64s: however that
185.68s: they dropped out of asu because of the
187.92s: partying
188.96s: they just couldn't handle it um but
191.84s: after
192.48s: my first year at asu i kind of i decided
195.92s: to
196.48s: transfer to depaul which is in chicago
199.28s: and when i
200.80s: prior to doing that move i decided that
202.80s: i wanted to change my major to finance
205.36s: and i can't explain exactly the moment
207.92s: this happened
208.88s: but it was literally just like a weird
211.20s: moment in my life where i woke up one
212.88s: day
213.36s: and my whole mindset was shifted towards
215.92s: finance
216.96s: and i was just like i need to know how
218.32s: money works i need to figure out how
219.68s: investing works
220.64s: yeah because it doesn't matter what kind
222.88s: of money i make in my life like if i
224.32s: don't know
225.44s: what to do with it or the things that i
227.44s: can do with it to grow it and preserve
229.36s: it
229.76s: then i'm going to be screwed yeah so i
231.60s: literally had like an overnight moment
233.44s: where
234.00s: i switched from computer science to
236.32s: finance
237.44s: transfer to depaul and the rest is
240.24s: history
240.96s: so when i was at depaul i got an
244.24s: internship at tastytrade which is a
246.88s: financial network to talk about
248.32s: options trading and stuff like that but
250.48s: i was just in email correspondence with
253.36s: the founder
254.00s: tom sasna and i had been i think or swim
257.36s: right
258.16s: yeah he's co-founder i think co-founder
260.48s: of thinkorswim got it and the other
262.24s: co-founder
263.12s: that started thinkorswim with him is at
265.12s: tastyworks now
266.16s: gotta tell the ceo of tastyworks got
268.40s: sheridan
269.28s: he and tom were the i think co-founders
272.16s: of thinkorswim
273.12s: they definitely both worked there i'm
274.32s: just not sure if there was another
276.16s: founder
276.64s: but okay um but yeah so i just was in
279.84s: email with him i sent him a couple
281.44s: emails one was about
282.80s: just an options trading question and
285.60s: then i sent him another email
287.44s: that was asking about internships within
290.24s: the finance slash trading industry i
292.40s: wasn't even necessarily asking for an
294.32s: internship
294.96s: at tastytrade but he just kind of
297.44s: skimmed that email i think and then he
299.68s: sent me back another email saying that
301.28s: they had some interns there
302.80s: that would be in a couple months and so
305.92s: he connected me with this other woman
308.00s: that worked at tastytrade i sent her my
310.08s: resume
311.12s: came in for an interview which was
313.36s: literally just kind of like a meet and
314.88s: greet to see
316.24s: righteous personalities yeah exactly
318.24s: yeah like the hardest question he asked
320.08s: me he said
321.20s: uh how are your math skills and i was
323.52s: like i don't know i think they're pretty
324.80s: good
325.12s: like that was the most that was the most
326.80s: technical question i think the interview
328.32s: process is a little harder these days
330.16s: but
330.80s: i definitely got super lucky with that
332.88s: but it was just kind of a cold email led
335.60s: into an internship
337.28s: and i worked at tc trade for three years
340.40s: from
341.32s: 2013-2016 and then
344.40s: after my stint there i left
347.84s: to start project option which the
350.40s: initial goal was to start a website
352.64s: have a lot of written content grow the
355.04s: website traffic and then
356.80s: sell subscription services or courses on
358.96s: that but then
360.32s: it kind of morphed into a youtube
361.92s: channel because i knew that it would be
364.24s: easier
365.12s: to get exposure on youtube as compared
366.96s: to google search because when you think
368.96s: about
369.52s: right the two there's like there's when
371.60s: i started there was already
373.20s: probably hundreds of websites that had
375.84s: lots of
376.48s: options trading articles and there it
378.40s: was really hard to compete with them but
379.84s: when you looked at the youtube space
381.60s: there were only really a couple of
384.24s: channels
384.96s: that had lots of viewers so i thought
387.52s: that it would be a much
388.80s: easier time getting exposure on youtube
391.44s: as compared to
392.40s: just the written content since there are
394.24s: less people making videos
395.60s: as compared to the blog post type
397.92s: content so
399.28s: and that kind of led to where i am today
402.56s: so today i'm just focused
403.76s: essentially 100 on youtube okay it's
406.72s: funny because when i started the youtube
408.48s: channel
409.44s: i saw it as a chore like i wanted to
411.60s: focus on the website and the written
413.04s: content
413.60s: interesting but i knew that the youtube
415.68s: channel would be a
417.28s: much easier way to get exposure at least
419.68s: that way theory
420.88s: and so i created written or video
422.88s: counterparts to all the blog posts that
424.64s: i was writing okay
425.76s: and my like my og day one youtube videos
428.72s: were all just
429.76s: horrible like voice over presentations
432.24s: like i would have
433.28s: i'd just be doing sitting here with this
435.12s: microphone yep
436.32s: and i would make a powerpoint
438.24s: presentation i would export the slides
440.08s: as images
441.04s: and then there would be times where i
442.72s: would i'd be talking over like the same
444.40s: slide for two minutes
446.00s: and it would be like all this text like
447.68s: getting static and then me
450.48s: talking for two minutes like which
452.40s: looking back on that i can't believe i
454.08s: even grew on youtube with that format
455.84s: because
456.64s: on youtube engagement is everything and
458.64s: so yeah these days when i make videos
460.56s: like i'm always trying to have something
462.08s: moving just to get
463.20s: the viewer engaged visually you must
465.20s: have really good content though
466.72s: i mean at the end of the day if that was
468.40s: making you grow even with the
470.00s: you know the clear overhead turn on the
471.84s: projector thing that goes
473.12s: yeah you know i think i think um
476.72s: yeah i think the original growth or the
479.44s: growth that i experienced over the first
481.04s: couple years even with the
482.72s: less engaging video format i think it
485.20s: was just about the content on the back
487.04s: end
487.36s: not necessarily production quality yeah
490.64s: i identify honestly a lot with that
492.24s: because i put zero effort into my
494.16s: production quality and i think everybody
495.76s: knows that i mean it's
497.20s: i tell it to people like this is what's
500.40s: that
502.32s: it's a lot of work yeah and for me like
505.04s: i was telling you i
506.08s: do not identify as a creative person so
508.32s: for me to like
509.44s: i like to use the whiteboard i just jot
511.12s: out my my thoughts and whatnot talk
512.96s: through them and share screenshots and
514.48s: for me that's not work for me that's
516.32s: just
516.88s: how i mentally process things but if i
519.04s: were to do what some of the other
520.32s: channels do which is really gucci like
522.08s: it looks cool
523.12s: but to me that's work i'm not
524.72s: graphically inclined so
526.56s: that's what i also attribute the you
529.60s: know very humble growth that my channel
531.68s: has had is
532.40s: essentially just because the content
534.24s: comes from a good a good place and i
535.92s: know that because
536.88s: i'm not selling anything i couldn't
538.08s:  care if you like it or not it's
540.00s: just there
540.64s: for general consumption but that's
542.64s: really interesting
543.68s: i'd love to hear a little bit more about
545.68s: the switch
547.04s: from the focus on your website to
549.92s: youtube when did you make that jump
553.28s: um i think let's see so i think
556.80s: 2019 was the first year this was a
559.36s: literal
560.40s: new year's resolution i had a business
563.36s: new year's resolution
564.48s: that's coming into 2019 i said for the
567.28s: entirety of 2019
569.04s: i'm doing nothing on the website i'm
571.52s: focusing all of my energy
573.28s: on making my videos better so higher
575.84s: production quality
577.36s: i learned kind of like the post
578.64s: production of doing animations and
581.60s: graphics and stuff like that which the
583.44s: first couple iterations of that were
584.96s: absolutely terrible
586.08s: sure but for 2019 that was the first
588.96s: year
589.44s: and it was a literal business new year's
591.84s: resolution that's dope to spend
593.68s: all of my energy and focus on youtube
596.00s: because i'm a one-man show
597.52s: right and so for me especially like i
600.16s: can be
600.72s: i'm i'm so prone to procrastination and
603.12s: being busy
604.32s: and focused like there's no way i could
606.56s: have a podcast a youtube channel
609.20s: write a blog post and do all that at the
611.60s: same time i just have to focus on one
613.68s: thing
614.48s: and i think well i know so the reason
617.36s: that i that i chose to focus on youtube
619.92s: for that year is because up to that
622.00s: point
623.04s: youtube was kind of like the steady
625.20s: growth curve so like whenever i looked
626.80s: at the analytics
628.00s: it was steadily growing and compared to
630.64s: my website analytics
632.24s: you know it was it was kind of choppy it
634.72s: wasn't
635.52s: it wasn't growing exponentially like
637.20s: youtube was and so i figured
639.60s: the highest probability bet that i could
641.44s: make would be to focus
643.20s: 100 of my effort on the one thing that i
646.16s: know
646.56s: is growing is growing and if i focus
648.64s: more on that and especially if i improve
650.88s: the quality of my videos then i think i
652.96s: could kind of pour gasoline on that
654.72s: growth so to speak yeah yeah that's what
656.24s: i did
657.04s: that's absolutely awesome i love that
658.56s: because i i also
660.08s: had a blog for a little while that was
661.52s: just you know general hobby and what i
663.68s: realized is i was talking to some of my
665.12s: friends
666.24s: nobody wanted to sit there and
667.76s: read it you know what i mean and one of
669.20s: the things people really enjoy about
670.80s: youtube is that if they're doing
672.32s: something else and they want to
674.08s: partially pay attention it's available
675.84s: to them they can just let it run
677.60s: and you know digest what they hear and
679.52s: if they want to go back and like really
680.88s: focus on it i think it's really awesome
682.40s: that you did that and you kind of
683.28s: identified that obviously
685.12s: you're really savvy it comes to identify
687.68s: business opportunities that's that's
689.12s: super awesome when you first started
690.56s: general
691.04s: question did it still feel like a chore
693.28s: working on youtube
694.32s: slash and i'm asking for me obviously
696.56s: none of my viewers have they don't care
698.32s: um but i'm curious personally like when
700.00s: did it start feeling like fun
701.60s: for you to work on youtube channel
703.36s: compared to the website
705.44s: um that's a good question i honestly
707.68s: can't
709.04s: i can't pinpoint a specific moment but
712.16s: i think i think just generally after i
715.92s: started youtube and i
717.28s: started seeing because the youtube
719.04s: analytics are absolutely insane as i'm
720.96s: sure you know
722.80s: i i tell you what man i'm too dumb to
724.72s: use it i like i literally have one of my
726.96s: best friends
727.92s: you only need to focus on a couple
729.20s: things youtube they you know they kind
730.80s: of guide you and show you
732.16s: yeah like when you when you log in watch
734.56s: time's the first thing they should
736.16s: it's all about watch time but i think it
739.36s: was
739.84s: after i had maybe a few months
742.00s: experience probably about a year
743.44s: experience
744.00s: because in my first six months i think i
746.24s: added
747.68s: maybe three to four hundred subscribers
749.68s: and then second six months i added
752.08s: maybe a thousand fifteen hundred yeah so
754.80s: like every
756.08s: the every interval of time or chunk of
758.40s: time like going forward was exponential
761.44s: in terms of growth compared to the same
763.36s: amount of time
764.72s: in previous history so like the first
766.64s: months was 300 subscribers the next six
769.04s: months
769.68s: where you know a thousand subscribers or
771.44s: whatever it is
772.72s: and it just continued to grow
774.80s: exponentially
775.92s: and so once i started to see those
778.00s: trends i think i became much more
779.84s: interested in youtube got it
781.36s: and then i think after i turned on
782.96s: monetization because i actually i didn't
784.64s: turn on monetization
786.32s: or ads on my videos right when it was
789.20s: available to me i think i actually
790.80s: because i assumed that the money that
794.24s: was going to be made
795.36s: from my youtube channel would be so low
797.92s: that it wouldn't even matter
799.20s: right and then i was surprised when i
801.04s: turned on monetization i was like
802.72s: oh this is actually like like my first
805.20s: my first paycheck from youtube was like
806.88s: a couple hundred bucks
807.92s: yeah so like well that's a pretty
810.16s: substantial amount of money because at
811.52s: the time
812.48s: my first year when i started project
815.12s: option i made ten thousand dollars
816.88s: right and the second year was more than
819.36s: that but it still wasn't like it wasn't
821.44s: a lot of money
822.16s: right right though three hundred dollars
824.32s: in one month in my
825.36s: in my first paycheck from youtube like
827.36s: that was a good amount of money yeah
828.72s: that's decent um so i was super
830.16s: surprised to see
831.44s: the amount of money that could be made
832.96s: from monetization and so that
835.36s: also started to get me more and more
837.20s: interested and
838.48s: i love that just for people who maybe
840.56s: have no idea about
842.08s: youtube ad revenue and stuff like that
844.16s: um it's
845.28s: very niche dependent so like if you have
847.76s: a youtube channel
848.72s: and you are getting like tens of
851.20s: millions of views on all of your videos
853.36s: then that means you have a very broad
855.36s: audience right
856.72s: basically you're catering to everyone
858.08s: you just have you just have viral
859.92s: youtube content that everybody wants to
861.68s: watch
862.48s: but for advertisers if you have a really
864.96s: broad audience
866.64s: then there's not gonna there's not gonna
868.88s: be as much competition to actually
870.72s: target a specific audience because they
872.88s: can't use your channel to really get
874.88s: to the audience they want right but in
876.88s: something like finance
878.64s: since all the people who are watching
880.24s: options trading videos or
881.84s: investing videos that's a much more
884.08s: specific audience
885.60s: and the lifetime value of acquiring a
889.12s: customer in finance
890.24s: is thousands of dollars right and so if
892.88s: you can
894.24s: if you can acquire that customer and
896.00s: make those thousands of dollars in some
897.92s: case
898.32s: tens of thousands of dollars over the
899.92s: lifetime of that customer
901.76s: then you can naturally spend hundreds of
904.24s: dollars to acquire a customer
905.92s: right and so since the lifetime value of
907.76s: the customer is higher in finance and
909.68s: investing
910.64s: then you can pay more to acquire the
912.48s: customer and so advertising
915.04s: uh competition and advertising spend is
917.92s: a lot higher in finance
919.68s: as it would be in something that's much
922.72s: more broad where you can't
924.24s: figure out the audience and so that
925.76s: trickles down to the youtube creator
927.76s: because youtube takes uh youtube takes a
930.40s: percentage
931.60s: of what the advertisers pay right to
933.76s: advertising your channel and then
935.20s: you as the creator get the rest so yeah
937.68s: that's it's
938.64s: i mean that's educational for me i
940.08s: honestly didn't know a lot of that
941.28s: because i was in the same boat as you
942.48s: where i didn't bother
943.44s: turning on monetization for some time
945.28s: and then i was talking to somebody about
946.64s: it and they were like dude
947.84s: why don't you just turn it on because
949.28s: they know i work with the wounded
950.80s: warrior project no why don't you just
952.16s: turn it on and donate it and i was like
954.08s: yeah you know i'm not sure i thought the
955.84s: same thing it's gonna be really low who
957.20s: really cares and then he's just like
958.56s: dude think of it this way
960.08s: it's no sweat off of the viewer's back
962.00s: like it makes no difference the content
963.68s: you're providing is still completely
964.96s: free to them
965.76s: so you're not you know what i mean
967.04s: you're not changing that paradigm
969.60s: that i i kind of built my channel on and
971.76s: he's like and then you just
973.04s: you know it's passive like just donate
974.72s: it i was like yeah okay and then i
976.64s: i found the same exact thing as you were
978.40s: talking about i was surprised
980.24s: um with the ad revenue it's actually
983.60s: really cool because i was
984.96s: able to make a donation that was
988.32s: for building a ramp at a dude's house
991.04s: that was in a wheelchair
992.48s: he literally sent a video to one of the
994.88s: segments of him getting in his house
996.40s: because it had stairs
997.76s: and he literally would roll the real
999.20s: wheelchair backwards until he hit the
1001.36s: stairs
1001.92s: and like muscle himself up four stairs
1004.72s: and he was good at it
1005.92s: but we're like you know we could
1006.88s: probably give this dude a ramp like so
1009.20s: he doesn't have to
1010.16s: play that game so let's it's fascinating
1012.32s: that background you shared because like
1013.60s: i said
1014.32s: ignorant to all of it knew nothing so
1016.24s: that's cool man so
1017.52s: like all these little things that i was
1018.80s: learning about especially like as they
1020.32s: pertain to youtube
1021.60s: all these things together they really
1024.24s: pulled me in and i was like okay if i
1026.00s: i could focus on this and if i put in
1028.56s: the effort
1029.28s: then maybe one day like this could be
1031.44s: all i need
1032.32s: right i'm i'm i'm happy that
1035.84s: i'm able to make a full-time living from
1038.96s: youtube and also the affiliate marketing
1041.04s: that i do which is just essentially
1042.40s: connecting people with a brokerage firm
1044.24s: because now my business model doesn't
1046.40s: require
1047.76s: anybody that's watching my videos it
1049.20s: doesn't require them to pay me
1051.12s: we're out of the pocket for me to make
1052.96s: money and so
1054.72s: you know there's obviously a lot of in
1056.64s: the trading and investing industry it's
1058.24s: very predatory
1060.40s: where hate it these people they
1062.72s: line their pockets from
1064.40s: other people who are paying them that
1066.40s: just don't know any better
1068.00s: and they sell them on the material
1069.60s: things which you know
1071.12s: that was like from day one when i
1072.80s: started project option i was like
1074.64s: i'm gonna take the long road and i'm
1076.40s: never gonna i'm not gonna
1078.24s: succumb to you know selling the dream to
1080.72s: sell my services or whatever because
1082.64s: number one that's not reality like these
1084.32s: people they're making
1086.24s: i they could be making that amount of
1088.64s: money from
1089.84s: their trading accounts but it's very
1092.08s: unlikely
1093.28s: that they grew small trading pounds
1096.16s: which is what most of their customers
1097.52s: will have a couple thousand dollars into
1099.44s: millions of dollars that's like
1101.44s: very far and few between but once they
1104.00s: have that
1105.12s: experience or they have the proof that
1106.72s: they actually did that however they
1108.96s: were successful in doing so then they
1111.20s: can use that
1112.24s: to sell a subscription service or a
1113.84s: course and then the money that comes
1115.92s: from that
1116.80s: can grow their trading account even
1118.88s: further and then they have
1120.08s: just the steady steady flow of cash flow
1123.12s: that they can use to make riskier and
1125.28s: riskier bets
1126.24s: and some of those could pay off but for
1128.32s: the average person that is going to
1129.92s: start with a couple thousand dollars
1132.08s: it's just not it's not a realistic way
1134.72s: to
1135.28s: market your stuff and so my goal with
1138.16s: project option was to just kind of
1140.08s: present things neutrally and give people
1141.76s: the information and let them
1143.60s: use it however they want to but i never
1145.52s: wanted to use the
1146.88s: flashy sales tactics for the purpose of
1150.08s: selling things that would line my own
1152.40s: pockets i love that it's
1153.84s: so i'm happy that the ad revenues are
1156.08s: high enough on youtube for
1157.84s: the options trading space and finance in
1160.40s: general
1161.12s: yeah i can structure a business model
1163.12s: around that where i don't have to
1164.40s: actually
1165.12s: collect payments from the customers yeah
1167.76s: and have them pay out of pocket
1169.12s: so yeah that's awesome man it's and it's
1171.36s: to be honest it's one of the things that
1172.96s: i do before i invite anybody to to chat
1175.60s: on my channel
1176.72s: not like again not like i'm offering any
1178.80s: sort of significant exposure but
1180.72s: i do know that folks are looking for
1182.80s: resources and stuff and
1184.00s: i want nothing to do with any of those
1186.40s: kind of channels because
1187.84s: it's just misleading man it does it
1189.92s: brings people down the wrong path i
1191.36s: literally just
1192.08s: started a i call it a small stacks
1195.12s: portfolio so i just took 5k opened up a
1197.84s: small portfolio
1198.88s: and i'm essentially trading it knowing
1201.92s: what i know now as if i was starting all
1203.68s: over again
1204.80s: and what i tell everybody is that this
1206.96s: 5k is not going to grow into my nest egg
1209.12s: like this 5k
1210.48s: is something that i think if i was
1213.12s: starting over again
1214.16s: that i would be wanting to grow modestly
1216.64s: but most importantly
1218.08s: developing a solid strategy that as my
1220.96s: income grows and as i continue to save
1222.96s: and grow the account i can continue to
1224.80s: apply that same strategy
1226.56s: earning that whatever that percent
1228.32s: return is so it's like
1230.00s: that 5k is for developing a strategy in
1233.12s: consistency
1234.08s: that is not going to grow in your nest
1235.60s: egg and i i honestly love that you
1237.92s: kind of echo that because it's so
1240.48s: exhausting
1241.28s: seeing all the that people are
1243.28s: spreading and then it's no wonder why
1244.96s: when there's new people to
1246.24s: come into investing they're like you ask
1248.48s: them hey you know what are you what are
1249.68s: you targeting this year they're like oh
1251.04s: you know nothing crazy maybe
1252.40s: 80 100 for the year and it's like oh god
1255.84s: like just just you're completely lost
1258.32s: you're so
1259.20s: skewed in what you think is realistic
1262.08s: yeah
1262.56s: some people some people email me and
1264.80s: they ask me for
1266.00s: my opinion on a service or whatever
1269.12s: not to name anything and some of most of
1271.36s: the time like i've never heard of it
1272.64s: myself
1273.52s: but just the other day someone asked me
1276.24s: they said well this service they said
1277.84s: that they can turn
1278.72s: five thousand dollars into two hundred
1281.44s: thousand dollars every year
1283.28s: i was like well obviously like that's
1286.16s: not true because
1287.68s: they may have done it once but if they
1289.84s: could do it every single year then there
1291.52s: would be no reason
1293.04s: to sell that because they would be a
1294.64s: trillionaire if you could turn five
1296.08s: thousand dollars into 200k every single
1297.84s: year
1298.40s: and you could scale that strategy there
1300.72s: would be no reason to be in
1302.16s: online sales you could just you could
1304.16s: become a billionaire with that
1305.76s: right you know so epstein's island and
1308.72s: then just
1309.36s: stay there yeah exactly um
1312.80s: and then like i've had i've had people
1314.72s: email me
1316.00s: pictures from other newsletters or trade
1318.40s: alert services
1319.68s: where like in their introductory
1321.52s: newsletter that they're using to kind of
1323.76s: try to sell people on it where they'll
1325.76s: say like with just
1327.20s: two thousand dollars in a margin account
1328.72s: like you can make a full-time living
1330.80s: trading options like psychotic now it's
1332.88s: just absolute so
1334.48s: psychotic it's unfortunate that that's
1336.72s: the space we're in
1338.00s: i hate it but but yeah like when i when
1341.92s: i started i knew
1343.36s: that not taking that approach to
1346.24s: marketing and selling
1347.68s: would be a much slower path but it was
1350.00s: just so important to me to not go down
1351.84s: that path just because it's so awesome
1354.80s: i wouldn't be able to live with myself
1356.24s: which is different types of people that
1358.88s: the person that can do anything and do
1361.44s: any type of sales that they want to as
1363.04s: long as
1363.68s: it benefits them and they don't care
1365.60s: like what that means ethically and then
1367.92s: there's the other type of person that
1369.68s: will refuse certain approaches if it's
1372.56s: not
1373.44s: ethical you know not i'm this type of
1376.32s: person
1377.04s: so i always try to be i always try to be
1379.68s: brutally honest
1380.64s: and just my whole goal is just to give
1383.04s: people information
1384.48s: unbiased and let them do with
1387.52s: with the information whatever they want
1388.96s: so i love that yeah it's
1391.04s: it's honestly when i was i looked at a
1393.12s: couple your videos
1394.40s: um before i asked you you know to to
1396.72s: come on and do this with me and
1398.40s: that's one thing i i truly look for is
1400.80s: the people who are like
1402.00s: genuinely trying to just share
1404.72s: information
1405.92s: and then let individuals do what they're
1408.80s: going to do with
1409.52s: it but right something that that is
1412.64s: definitely clouded the space is
1414.24s: just predatorial advertising you see it
1417.12s: all the time and it sucks because it's
1418.64s: so effective so many people
1420.80s: just want that lifestyle so bad that
1424.00s: when they see something that
1425.84s: you know it's fishy but you want it so
1428.32s: bad that you want to believe it and then
1430.32s: you find yourself going down this you
1431.84s: know really shitty path
1433.12s: yeah right so when you started
1436.80s: investing what what was your primary
1440.08s: um vehicle did you start with stock then
1442.16s: go to options or did you start with
1443.68s: options what did that look like
1445.68s: yes i started and i read a lot of books
1448.64s: just on
1449.20s: general stock investing so i read
1451.92s: basically all of peter lynch's books
1454.08s: he's famed mutual fund manager he worked
1456.72s: for fidelity he had like
1458.08s: 30 returns for 15 20 years whatever
1462.16s: whatever his period of time working
1464.64s: there he has like
1465.60s: some of the most historic returns ever
1467.52s: for mutual fund managers so i read
1470.48s: all of his books essentially i read a
1472.24s: couple books by jim cramer
1474.32s: um i was just kind of i was just
1476.88s: absorbing as much
1477.92s: information as i could within the stock
1480.88s: investing space
1482.56s: and naturally from there going down
1484.56s: rabbit holes on the internet
1486.00s: i found options and i think i found
1489.12s: options articles from the motley fool
1491.36s: and i was like
1492.24s: these things are interesting like i
1493.76s: don't know what this is about but this
1495.84s: sounds
1496.48s: really appealing and like admittedly the
1499.36s: appeal of options that
1500.64s: drew me in was that you could use a
1502.08s: small amount of money there it is a lot
1503.60s: of money you know
1504.32s: leverage um
1507.52s: so that really drew me in and then i
1509.84s: started searching
1511.36s: for options content on youtube and then
1513.92s: i found taste and trade
1515.36s: and then that's kind of what led me to
1517.76s: email tom and then
1519.12s: i had the internship at tastytrade and
1520.80s: then started project option obviously so
1523.52s: yeah i started
1524.56s: in stocks transitioned into options
1528.32s: but at the time
1531.84s: so this must have been in 20 this was
1534.32s: probably early 2013
1536.24s: okay so i was 20 years old
1540.48s: so i didn't have a lot of money to
1542.24s: invest at that time so i was basically
1543.92s: just learning as much as i could
1545.92s: right and just just absorbing all the
1548.64s: content so
1549.76s: yeah that's awesome i i started with
1552.24s: stock myself
1553.52s: and then um i stumbled across options in
1556.72s: a
1557.20s: kind of similar way i started early
1559.52s: though i started
1560.32s: trading options in when i was a senior
1564.16s: in high school so 2009
1567.36s: and i was super fortunate
1570.56s: in that there there was no like internet
1573.36s: was still kind of like growing then
1574.88s: obviously it existed but it wasn't like
1576.80s: tory for information as it is now
1578.72s: and i was super fortunate i came across
1581.84s: a um my mentor i still talk to him today
1585.52s: but he's a
1586.48s: prior army officer and whatnot i met him
1590.00s: on
1590.32s: a facebook group but long story short if
1592.56s: it wasn't for that dude to help
1594.16s: me get started when i was getting
1595.92s: started i probably would have just
1598.24s: you know pissed all my money away so i i
1600.72s: find
1601.28s: your approach very respectable because
1603.68s: most people
1605.12s: myself included want to get started
1607.60s: before they're ready to get started and
1609.44s: it seems like you did a lot of homework
1611.04s: which is
1611.76s: honestly it's just super admirable to
1613.68s: hear that because most people are like
1615.44s: me
1616.24s: and they're impulsive and they want to
1617.52s: get started before they're ready they
1618.88s: want to start making money and then they
1620.24s: just piss it away
1621.28s: because they're not ready so that that's
1623.04s: really awesome something i'm curious
1624.48s: about
1624.96s: is if you were to like look at the
1627.36s: lifespan
1628.08s: of your options trading how has it
1630.80s: evolved
1631.52s: from when you started to how you trade
1633.44s: now
1635.20s: that's a great question um so to kind of
1639.28s: to kind of build on what you just said
1643.44s: while i did do a lot of reading and
1646.40s: learning before i ever made an option
1648.32s: straight i probably
1649.28s: was reading about options for probably
1652.56s: one or two months before i even opened
1654.40s: up account and made my first trade
1656.56s: but the most
1659.68s: the most you're gonna learn is gonna
1661.04s: come from your direct experience
1662.72s: so it doesn't matter how many youtube
1664.08s: videos you watch how many books you read
1665.60s: how many blog posts you read
1667.52s: you're not going to learn how options
1669.60s: work until
1670.64s: you actually start trading them with
1672.88s: real money in my opinion because i
1674.56s: i messed around with paper paper trading
1676.48s: and i just never
1677.84s: found it to be a valuable learning
1679.28s: experience because interesting i would
1681.36s: i would and this is that's not true for
1683.36s: everybody oh sure
1684.64s: like i would put on an option position
1687.04s: in these
1687.76s: simulated trading softwares and i would
1690.88s: kind of just forget about them because i
1693.04s: i didn't have any skin in the game
1694.56s: and therefore there was really nothing
1697.36s: that
1697.76s: was pulling me back to like monitor that
1699.84s: position i'm truly focused on it
1701.76s: and so i didn't really find that it was
1704.40s: a valuable
1705.36s: learning tool although if if people use
1707.68s: it like
1708.80s: a real trade or a real position and they
1711.44s: actually like watch it
1712.80s: yeah multiple times a day check it out
1714.96s: every day
1715.84s: and then close it out i think i think
1717.68s: you can learn a lot from that but
1719.52s: i've always felt that real money trading
1722.64s: is the absolute best way to learn
1724.64s: obviously with a small amount if you're
1726.08s: just getting started
1727.44s: um but i agree with you your experience
1730.00s: trump's all
1731.12s: i totally regardless of what we're
1732.64s: talking about yeah i totally agree with
1734.56s: you i think
1735.60s: for me i had the same exact perspective
1740.08s: on paper trading for a long time that
1741.60s: was kind of useless and then
1743.04s: when i met my mentor my opinion on paper
1746.40s: trading completely changed because
1748.48s: he forced me to pay per trade for six
1751.20s: months straight
1752.08s: i couldn't he i mean i say i couldn't i
1754.80s: could have traded right he didn't
1756.08s:  control my account but
1758.00s: i i really respected him and i didn't i
1760.48s: wanted to do
1761.36s: you know what i mean what my mentor was
1762.88s: kind of telling me to do so anyways he
1765.20s: made me paper trade for six months
1766.80s: straight and
1768.88s: he we treated it just like it was my
1771.12s: money like we would talk about it every
1773.12s: single day
1773.84s: we would talk about the moves i wanted
1775.36s: to make i was only allowed to trade
1777.28s: the amount of money i was gonna you know
1778.88s: invest with stuff like that and
1781.20s: i found that to be so beneficial
1784.48s: and it came down exactly to what you
1786.48s: said it's like having the no
1788.24s: discipline
1789.28s: to treat this like real money to treat
1791.04s: this just like your account and like you
1792.56s: said most folks it's super hard to do
1794.80s: that
1795.12s: i needed somebody to force me to do it
1797.20s: in order to take it seriously so i
1798.64s: totally identify with you that for most
1800.56s: people until you put actual money in the
1803.44s: game it's
1804.00s: it's just not the same and even so even
1806.00s: like with me taking it as seriously as i
1807.68s: did
1808.00s: it still isn't the same exactly like you
1809.84s: said like there is no replacement for
1812.24s: actually trading but
1814.08s: what i do tell people is that if you're
1815.84s: new i suggest
1817.68s: so strongly to start with paper trading
1819.52s: because i truly think
1820.80s: that it can help you get a lot of like
1822.96s: just the gross ups
1824.64s: out of the way early so you don't have
1826.64s: to do that with real money i think that
1828.32s: that's
1829.04s: in just a really cool perspective that
1831.12s: you're sharing because it's something
1832.64s: i talk a lot about is you know the the
1834.48s: disposition towards paper trading
1836.32s: i agree with that so to answer your
1838.88s: question how the trading evolved
1840.96s: yeah the early like the first couple
1844.00s: years that i was trading options
1846.88s: i was doing i was very active so i was
1849.68s: probably
1850.08s: trading every day or as much as i could
1853.44s: and i was experimenting with lots of
1856.00s: different strategies trading all the
1857.36s: different strategies right
1858.64s: i did a lot of naked options selling so
1861.12s: i i loved selling strangles
1863.04s: early in the day and that's because when
1865.84s: you learn about
1866.72s: option decay and positive data and
1869.28s: everything like that
1870.48s: you naturally are gravitated towards
1873.60s: selling straddles and selling strangles
1875.52s: because you don't have the long options
1877.76s: that are reducing
1878.88s: your option to pay and so early
1882.00s: in my options trading career lifespan
1885.44s: whatever you want to call it
1886.64s: i was doing a lot of naked options
1888.16s: selling um
1889.84s: and just trading a lot of different
1891.60s: strategies um doing making a lot of
1894.32s: predictions and speculations on stock
1896.08s: price movements okay
1897.36s: but i think the most important part of
1899.84s: that whole thing
1900.80s: is just experimenting with different
1902.40s: strategies and
1904.56s: paying attention to why the positions
1906.96s: are changing
1907.92s: in terms of p l every single day
1911.04s: so observations
1914.08s: that you make with your positions i
1915.68s: think are one of the best ways to learn
1918.08s: because
1919.60s: you have to ask yourself all right the
1921.92s: stock is down today my position is up
1924.32s: or the stock is flat today my positions
1926.40s: p l has changed by correct
1928.48s: why is this happening and you have to
1930.24s: ask yourself the why every single day
1932.48s: and after every single movement and
1934.96s: that's
1935.68s: how you're going to learn how options
1937.20s: work truly in the real world
1939.60s: um and so that was the first the first
1942.80s: few years that's kind of how i
1944.16s: approached it
1945.28s: i i was not really making money i would
1948.40s: say i was a break-even trader
1950.08s: at best which is still i think really
1951.84s: good when you first start out if you can
1953.52s: break even your first year i think
1954.88s: that's all i
1955.68s: tell everybody i tell everybody be
1958.08s: profitable if it's your first year
1959.52s: and you make a dollar when you you come
1962.32s: out okay
1963.28s: yeah i may not have been breaking even
1965.04s: but it wasn't i never had any
1966.64s: catastrophic losses
1968.08s: completely wiped me out which i think is
1970.16s: very common for beginners especially if
1972.16s: you're
1972.88s: getting into the short-term option
1974.40s: buying which is something that
1976.08s: a lot of people kind of put out there
1977.76s: these days because that's the only
1979.20s: that's the only real way to have a 10
1981.04s: 000 x return
1982.48s: is to buy out of the money options super
1984.80s: short term and be right on a big stock
1986.72s: price movement
1987.68s: that's the only way to have those home
1989.84s: run type returns
1991.20s: and people do hit them but that's the
1993.44s: fastest way to blow up your whole
1994.64s: account
1995.44s: because you don't have any margin for
1997.76s: error
1998.48s: and those options are not only going to
2000.96s: decay very quickly but
2002.72s: if the stock price moves against them
2004.32s: one of those options will also be worth
2005.84s: yeah i mean you're just sitting there
2007.28s: looking at a lot of gamma risk
2008.64s: so it's yeah it's uh as my
2011.84s: i'm in a i'm in a google chat with
2014.96s: my brother and some other people and we
2017.84s: call it
2018.56s: vape risk vapor risk so like if you buy
2021.60s: short-term out-of-the-money options
2022.96s: those are pure vapor so yeah they'll
2024.80s: just be gone
2025.84s: yep i love that that's that's absolutely
2028.32s: accurate
2029.60s: yeah so that evolved into
2033.92s: that evolved into um basically
2036.80s: transitioning from all the strategies to
2039.28s: mainly selling directionally neutral
2041.68s: trades
2042.48s: or doing spread trades directionally so
2044.56s: it's basically just spreads
2046.32s: but it was either neutral or directional
2049.52s: like iron condors iron butterflies or
2052.24s: selling foot spreads selling call
2053.52s: spreads
2054.08s: buying false spreads buying put spreads
2056.32s: that's kind of where it went
2058.48s: but the activity was still pretty high
2061.44s: and
2062.40s: if we fast forward to probably the past
2064.72s: year
2065.44s: i would say that my training active my
2067.92s: training activity from day one
2069.68s: options trading like starting from when
2071.76s: i started learning
2072.80s: all the way to today i think my trading
2075.44s: activity has been a steady
2077.44s: decreasing curve that's awesome i think
2080.40s: that's because
2082.08s: i've realized that the more active i am
2084.80s: the worse i do
2086.48s: because not necessarily just like
2089.68s: churning trades but like you're you're
2091.12s: micromanaging positions and that's not
2093.20s: work this actually happened earlier this
2094.96s: year in march
2096.08s: when the market was so volatile i got
2099.12s: sucked into the volatility and i was
2101.20s: started to micromanage again and every
2103.20s: single day i was making
2104.88s: like 10 to 15 trades yeah and
2108.00s: i felt like i was just kind of digging
2109.68s: myself into a hole because i was never
2111.68s: letting a prediction play out i was just
2114.00s: kind of
2114.80s: changing my predictions with each day
2116.48s: with each new movement in the market
2118.72s: and i found that to be a very difficult
2121.84s: period training wise
2123.20s: and it was also getting super super
2124.88s: stressful i started to lose sleep
2126.80s: i was i was waking up at four in
2129.20s: the morning
2130.08s: checking my phone to see where es was
2132.64s: yeah
2133.28s: so it just it wasn't like i had a ton of
2136.16s: risk on that's that's not why i was
2137.76s: losing sleep it was just because
2139.68s: my brain had gotten into this pattern of
2141.76s: just being
2142.72s: hyper obsessed with every little
2144.48s: movement in the market yeah it was hard
2146.08s: to learn today
2146.88s: because every day the market was up or
2148.72s: down
2152.48s: and so i was able to
2155.52s: pair that back and start putting on some
2157.76s: directional positions which after the
2159.68s: federal reserve came out and came out
2161.28s: with all their stimulus
2162.56s: and then we rallied like 10 off the lows
2166.08s: and then we weren't starting we weren't
2168.16s: really seeing any
2169.44s: negative downturns even after that was
2171.52s: coming out then i kind of figured like
2173.84s: all right i might as well just not try
2175.28s: to fight this because
2176.96s: after we started bouncing 5 10 off the
2179.28s: lows i was like all right now is the
2180.96s: time to start
2181.60s: loading up on the shorts again right and
2183.68s: i burned a lot of money in
2185.44s: vxx by purchasing deep out of the money
2188.40s: calls in vxx because i thought we're
2190.08s: gonna have
2191.04s: another vol explosion with the obvious
2194.40s: the obvious incoming market crash but we
2196.96s: never really got that
2198.40s: and then i also learned that
2201.52s: typically when you have a shock to the
2203.44s: system and you have a really
2205.28s: severe stock market crash the volatility
2208.32s: increase is typically the most
2209.76s: exaggerated on the initial downturn
2212.00s: right but then even if you rally back up
2214.32s: and then you have another
2215.36s: 10 drop like the second increase in
2218.08s: volatility
2219.04s: primarily talking about the vix futures
2221.76s: and therefore vxx
2223.28s: that will not be as significant as the
2226.32s: first
2226.88s: typical meltdown so like the initial
2228.96s: shock is typically
2230.32s: the most jarring in terms of a
2232.08s: volatility increase
2233.52s: at least from the information that i
2235.92s: came across on the internet which
2237.44s: you know you always have to take really
2238.72s: great just trust it blindly obviously
2241.12s: it does make sense when you think about
2242.48s: it because like a couple months in like
2245.44s: a month and a half
2246.48s: into the new volatility like people are
2248.56s: used to really bad news
2250.00s: and people are used to a market decrease
2252.88s: and therefore
2254.32s: the reactions to those movements and the
2256.80s: reactions to the news are not going to
2258.56s: be as exaggerated
2260.00s: as when you go from a 12 vicks and then
2262.64s: all of a sudden the market dropped 30
2264.80s: in 17 trading days and now the vix is at
2268.16s: 90.
2268.80s: so yeah i i talk about that a lot too
2271.44s: it's
2271.84s: you know obviously i always like to say
2273.52s: markets crash down not
2274.96s: up but you know once you get through
2277.12s: that that first move exactly like you're
2278.72s: talking people have had a chance to
2280.08s: digest synthesize the information so
2282.08s: even if there is
2283.60s: a change in circumstance you know two
2286.48s: months down the line or whatever
2288.16s: um they've already you know hit that
2290.00s: initial shock i've
2291.52s: it's funny you bring that up because i i
2293.68s: truly have felt and i've said it a
2295.12s: million times on you know different
2296.48s: videos that this has been like one of
2298.00s: the most emotional markets i've ever
2300.24s: traded in like i said
2301.52s: i i started trading um really in like
2304.64s: 2007
2306.08s: and it's just been mind-blowing to me
2309.36s: just how emotional every single thing
2311.84s: feels to me
2313.04s: and it's also very fascinating to hear
2315.52s: how you handled the rebound
2317.76s: compared to how i did because i
2321.28s: absolutely shared your sentiment i
2323.76s: thought
2324.72s: with near certainty that there's no way
2328.00s: the market could continue up after that
2330.00s: initial rebound
2331.52s: but i didn't start playing it because
2334.64s: i felt like the move in the news i was
2337.28s: seeing
2338.08s: didn't make any sense so i literally
2340.96s: just started scaling out
2342.48s: when the market makes typically those
2345.36s: big down moves
2346.56s: um i that's when i end up doing very
2348.96s: well with the volatility starting to
2351.04s: to spike as much as it does and then as
2353.92s: soon as we started getting that rally i
2355.28s: was like ah
2356.00s: you know i'll just kind of scale out and
2357.52s: see how this plays out and then it just
2359.12s: kept
2359.52s: going and going and i was like what the
2361.92s:  man like what is happening right
2364.08s: now
2364.64s: yeah especially the technology stocks
2366.40s: that was
2368.64s: i was looking at um you know just some
2371.52s: studies on historical bear markets and
2373.76s: from like 1920 or so this the average
2377.20s: recovery is like 298 days or so so over
2380.32s: 200 days almost 300
2382.00s: and i know that and then as soon as i
2383.84s: started seeing this thing
2385.12s: you know looking like a v-shape i was
2387.52s: like how
2388.40s: how like how are we making this move i
2390.48s: just didn't believe it
2391.68s: so i've been ever since the drop i've
2394.80s: been
2395.28s: very lightly invested i i've scaled in a
2398.08s: bit more in different periods of time
2399.60s: but in general i just don't trust it man
2401.52s: i just do not trust where things are
2404.08s: technology has been doing well and i
2405.92s: think
2406.40s: in a lot of ways this kind of
2407.84s: environment bodes well for them you know
2410.16s: everybody needs technology and i get
2411.76s: that
2412.56s: but there's a lot of other you know
2415.28s: makeup in the markets not just
2416.96s: technology so
2418.32s: i have uh i don't have a hard time with
2420.08s: that um
2421.36s: being cognizant of our time i definitely
2423.28s: don't want to run over um
2424.72s: i really appreciate your time i want to
2426.24s: make sure that we have a few minutes to
2427.52s: touch on
2428.56s: just your thoughts on how the mind of
2431.92s: the trader
2432.88s: impacts you know their execution
2435.60s: especially in a time like we're seeing
2436.96s: right now you know when things
2438.80s: are so emotional i'd like to get your
2440.32s: thoughts on that
2441.92s: yeah so i think i've i've personally
2443.76s: realized and
2445.92s: i structure my own training philosophy
2449.28s: and approach around
2450.32s: psychology because yeah i'm particularly
2452.88s: sensitive to
2453.76s: stress and anxiety and so
2457.36s: if i if i'm too active in the markets
2460.00s: and like they're taking it's taking up
2461.44s: too much of my
2462.48s: mental space and especially like if i
2466.00s: size trades too large or something like
2467.76s: that or i don't really know how i'm
2469.28s: going to manage the position
2470.64s: then all those things can start to kind
2472.08s: of eat away at me and so
2474.08s: i try to structure my trading strategy
2476.80s: so that i don't really have to
2478.32s: have those worries and i think traitor
2480.80s: psychology is one of those things that
2483.52s: it's not a sexy topic to talk about
2485.20s: because everybody is like if we
2487.12s: if we just sit here talking about
2488.24s: traitor psychology people will probably
2490.88s: think
2491.52s: well that doesn't really apply to me
2492.84s: because always completely strong always
2495.04s: and while that could be true uh when you
2497.76s: have your money on the line and
2499.04s: especially once you
2500.08s: start to pay attention to the markets
2501.60s: very actively you'll find that the
2503.76s: markets can break you down pretty
2505.20s: quickly
2505.92s: and i've learned through many of
2509.52s: i think i learned the most about my own
2511.36s: trader psychology and
2512.72s: traitor psychology in general through
2515.36s: the big market crashes that we've
2517.04s: experienced
2518.40s: over the past few years yeah namely
2522.24s: i started trading options in mid-2013
2526.16s: and 2015 was extremely low vol 2014 was
2529.44s: extremely low ball
2530.64s: and then we get to august 2015 and
2533.84s: that's the first time that i ever saw a
2536.32s: high volatility market
2537.76s: that's the first time i ever saw the
2540.32s: floor
2540.96s: being pulled out from the stock market
2542.80s: right so
2544.72s: in 2015 i was trading with about
2549.12s: twenty thousand dollars and from january
2552.72s: to august
2554.08s: i went up ten thousand dollars again
2556.80s: with a lot of
2557.68s: naked options selling i was selling lots
2559.28s: of strangles
2560.80s: but i was having a lot of success with
2563.44s: options trading and i was up 50
2565.28s: on the year and then august came around
2567.84s: and
2568.40s: i lost all my profits in like 36 hours
2571.68s: or something like that
2572.96s: and that's because the market started to
2574.16s: get so volatile that i
2576.64s: initially got blown out not like blown
2579.04s: out in terms of i
2579.92s: blew out my whole account but my short
2582.48s: option positions
2583.52s: the strangles those exploded in value
2586.40s: when the market opened on august 24th
2588.88s: right and i took some big losses on
2590.64s: those but then
2592.16s: the futures were moving around a hundred
2593.76s: dollars a day so then i was i was like
2596.32s: if i could just catch one of these
2597.76s: movements then
2599.36s: i could make five thousand dollars
2600.80s: because a hundred points on vs
2603.12s: is five thousand dollars and so i
2605.36s: started to get into active futures
2607.20s: training
2608.16s: and that was like that pulled me in a
2611.28s: very dark place psychologically because
2613.44s: you're looking at every single move
2614.96s: right especially if you like i had my
2617.52s: entries then i had my stops
2619.20s: and then it would always basically go
2620.72s: right to my stop i'd get stopped out
2622.64s: and then the move would happen and i'd
2624.00s: miss out on it and then you'd start to
2626.32s: force
2626.80s: entries on things because you're tired
2628.80s: of waiting around so it's just a very
2630.48s: undisciplined period
2632.00s: and i started to get really really
2634.00s: active especially with the futures
2636.32s: and i just noticed that like i just got
2639.12s: way way stressed out
2640.72s: and i was in a very dark place like it
2643.20s: was not just
2644.72s: it was not just affecting my investing
2646.88s: portfolio yeah for like my investing
2648.80s: life it was like
2649.92s: all aspects of life i got very sour and
2652.72s: just dude i wasn't i was in a not good
2654.48s: place
2655.04s: so i actually when i got back to
2657.12s: principal
2658.16s: which is by 20 000 or so i actually took
2661.36s: all of that money out of my trading
2663.44s: account and
2664.48s: i didn't trade for a month i didn't even
2666.00s: open up my platform for a month
2667.76s: because i was like i need a receipt i
2669.68s: need to reset from this
2671.44s: i can't just go right back in there like
2673.44s: i'm not in a good place mentally
2675.20s: yeah and so that was my first big lesson
2678.56s: about trader psychology and especially
2681.04s: how volatile markets
2682.80s: can can chew you up and spit you out
2685.84s: to actually vote my old boss and i think
2689.36s: a lot of people may agree with that
2691.36s: because if you if you've never
2692.80s: experienced a volatile market
2694.40s: and when you start to learn you start
2696.16s: actually trading and getting involved in
2697.76s: markets
2698.56s: just trickling higher it's like all
2700.40s: right low volatility the market just
2702.00s: kind of grinds up
2702.96s: over time there's no real worry like i
2705.60s: don't know why people are scared of
2707.28s: the declines and the drawdowns and then
2709.44s: it happens
2710.64s: and then you're like oh like this
2712.64s: is this is how it feels
2714.40s: and this is what happens in my brain
2716.32s: when i start to see so much volatility
2718.88s: and also with volatility you start to
2721.12s: see all these opportunities
2722.64s: and so you might get sucked into all
2724.56s: these trades that
2726.24s: you are probably just putting on just
2728.48s: because of the volatility and you're
2730.24s: thinking about
2731.28s: if you can catch one of those huge moves
2733.68s: for this particular position like you're
2735.44s: going to be sitting pretty
2736.72s: but unfortunately it's it's not that
2738.64s: easy and volatile markets i think are
2740.40s: the most dangerous
2741.92s: particularly for new traders because
2745.20s: just what happens psychologically when
2747.36s: you're actively involved in the markets
2749.04s: and then everything just
2750.16s: starts to get crazy volatile yeah i
2752.24s: think that can
2753.92s: that can really surprise you negatively
2757.12s: in terms of how you react to those
2758.96s: environments
2760.56s: especially the you know what i find when
2764.56s: there are people who are you know
2766.64s: starting to think that they understand
2768.00s: it and stuff like that
2769.28s: i always talk to folks my my favorite
2771.12s: conversation is when folks are selling
2772.80s: cash secured puts and they're always
2774.08s: just like oh i'm okay with assignment
2776.40s: and then all of a sudden the underlying
2777.92s: drops and they're like well i don't want
2779.20s: assignment here
2780.16s: and it's like it's it's just what you're
2782.00s: talking about that
2783.36s: right it's what mike tyson always said
2784.88s: right everybody's gotta plan until you
2786.16s: punch in the face
2787.04s: it's the same exact thing like so many
2788.80s: people feel like they're in a certain
2790.56s: mental space
2791.52s: and then the happens and they're
2792.88s: like okay i'm in a completely different
2794.56s: mental space
2796.00s: yeah i i love that conversation
2798.08s: obviously um
2799.36s: we're pretty much at time so i
2802.88s: i literally have a million questions for
2804.56s: you we can keep going
2807.84s: on that on that note about psychology
2810.40s: because i kind of want to have an action
2811.68s: plan here
2813.36s: but the way i structure my trading these
2815.76s: days is i'm
2816.56s: typically doing one of three things
2819.60s: if i'm trading options at all so a big a
2822.32s: big idea that i
2823.60s: made a video about not long ago was that
2826.80s: people see that i have this options
2828.48s: trading channel and i only talk about
2830.24s: options on the channel
2831.52s: and so i think that people might have
2834.08s: the impression that i
2835.20s: only trade options and that's like all i
2837.44s: do in terms of
2839.04s: my investing portfolio but actually
2842.24s: it's a very small percentage and i think
2844.88s: that's important because
2846.64s: since you get a lot of leverage with
2848.72s: options you don't need to allocate 100
2851.76s: of whatever you have saved up and in
2854.24s: your investment accounts you don't have
2855.44s: to allocate 100
2857.36s: of that money to options and in fact i
2859.84s: think it's very dangerous
2861.60s: so for example like you you could use
2864.24s: five percent of your portfolio let's say
2866.00s: you have
2867.20s: let's say you have fifty thousand
2868.88s: dollars i know that's a lot of money but
2870.48s: i have to kind of size it up here
2872.48s: because unless you have
2874.48s: tens of thousands of dollars like you
2876.00s: can't really size positions with
2877.84s: five percent like if you have if you
2880.48s: have
2881.04s: three thousand dollars five percent of
2882.96s: that is a hundred and fifty dollars
2884.48s: there's how many options positions you
2885.76s: can put on
2886.72s: for 150 and so let's say you have fifty
2890.80s: thousand dollars five percent of that is
2892.64s: twenty five hundred dollars let's say
2894.88s: you're really really bullish
2896.24s: on some stock and you wanna put on a
2899.12s: position that is going to
2900.80s: benefit immensely from any increase that
2903.12s: you see over the next couple years
2904.88s: well you could take that 2500 and you
2907.04s: could you could buy a call option with
2909.04s: it in
2909.92s: you know the year out two years out
2911.68s: expiration cycle
2912.96s: and you could double or triple or 10x
2915.84s: that money depending on the
2917.44s: exact stock price increase that you see
2920.08s: but you can only lose one x
2921.76s: and so you either are going to lose five
2924.88s: percent
2925.44s: which over a one year two year period
2927.76s: like that's not gonna
2928.80s: that's not gonna kill you you're not
2930.16s: gonna be at zero right but
2932.16s: if your prediction is correct and you
2934.00s: should really only be doing this if you
2935.36s: have a strong conviction
2936.72s: about something and you you want that
2938.56s: exposure but you could double or triple
2941.36s: 4x whatever it is and with that small
2944.32s: five percent allocation
2945.84s: that could result in an overall account
2948.32s: gain that is still huge
2950.00s: relative to the risk you took right and
2952.40s: so i think
2953.44s: with the leverage that you can get with
2954.80s: options you don't have to take a hundred
2956.80s: percent
2957.52s: of what you have unless of course you
2959.20s: have just a couple thousand dollars
2961.20s: in which case it's hard to kind of
2963.04s: diversify that into
2964.56s: different positions and stocks are
2966.40s: expensive which is i think another
2968.08s: reason people are drawn to options is
2969.84s: that
2970.72s: buying stocks is really expensive like
2972.96s: if you want to buy a share of amazon you
2974.56s: gotta
2974.96s: have three thousand dollars whereas you
2977.36s: could trade a call spread on amazon with
2979.28s: a few hundred dollars
2980.64s: and you could make a few hundred dollars
2982.80s: from that position if you're right
2985.36s: but i think it's i think it's dangerous
2987.28s: to forgo
2988.96s: traditional investing and focus solely
2991.44s: on
2992.16s: more active approaches just because if
2994.64s: you think about it over
2996.16s: if i'm gonna take all of my money
2997.68s: everything i've saved up and i'm going
2999.28s: to allocate it to
3000.40s: strictly options trading and i'm going
3003.20s: to do that for the next 10 years
3005.12s: well what that means is over the next 10
3008.48s: years
3009.20s: i have to be consistently right about my
3012.40s: short term predictions
3014.00s: with what's going to happen in the stock
3015.44s: market otherwise i'm going to lose money
3017.68s: and for me personally getting back to
3019.76s: the trader psychology
3021.76s: i don't want to i don't want to put
3023.04s: myself in a position where i have such a
3025.12s: high bar to be successful i'm not saying
3028.64s: that
3029.28s: that's going to lead me to not do it at
3031.60s: all i obviously i love trading options
3033.44s: like i'm going to be
3034.16s: here for the rest of my life but i just
3036.72s: i don't need to spend
3038.32s: or i don't need to allocate 100 of
3041.20s: whatever i'm saving
3042.32s: to options because i know that they are
3045.20s: more speculative because
3046.48s: they require whether you're trading
3048.24s: directionally or neutral
3049.92s: doesn't matter you're still making a
3051.52s: prediction and
3053.44s: the success of your strategies depends
3056.08s: specifically on the path
3057.76s: that the stock price takes right over
3059.76s: that trade duration and so i don't want
3061.12s: to put myself in a position where
3062.96s: i'm not going to make any money unless
3065.36s: i'm successfully
3067.20s: predicting short-term movements in
3068.80s: stocks over the next 10 years like that
3070.72s: right when i just think about that like
3072.56s: that seems like a very stressful
3074.08s: situation to be in and so i'd rather
3076.88s: hold passive investments and actively
3079.12s: purchase
3079.92s: more long-term positions that actually
3082.32s: represent something
3083.52s: over a long period of time because i
3085.52s: know with a longer holding period
3088.16s: this is statistically been shown to be
3090.80s: true too
3091.84s: the longer you hold stocks the higher
3093.76s: the percentage
3095.44s: that you have in making money yes and in
3097.52s: this book that i'm reading psychology of
3099.12s: money
3100.00s: i think he said over 20 year periods
3102.40s: there's been a 100
3103.52s: chance of making money thus far right
3106.80s: but basically like on a one day period
3108.48s: it's 50 right
3110.16s: one year it's 60
3113.20s: i think he said 68 um 10 years it's even
3116.48s: higher and then 20 years is 100
3118.32s: so like if i'm putting my money in those
3120.48s: types of positions
3121.68s: there's a lot less stress associated
3123.52s: with that because i know
3125.28s: it's not on me i don't have to predict
3127.52s: where tesla's going to go over the next
3128.96s: 45 days
3130.16s: if i think in 10 years from now the
3132.16s: company is going to be better off than
3133.76s: it is now
3134.72s: and it's going to change the world and
3137.20s: how we see it then
3138.24s: that's a much easier play to make with a
3140.40s: majority of my money
3141.76s: but it doesn't mean that i'm not going
3143.28s: to buy some tesla stock tesla stock and
3145.44s: then also
3146.48s: take a portion of that and do some
3148.56s: highly leveraged highly speculative
3150.32s: option positions well
3152.64s: um so i think like that that gets back
3155.68s: to psychology and for me
3157.12s: personally like i don't want to put
3159.20s: myself in a situation where i have
3161.28s: such a high bar required just to be
3164.40s: successful
3165.28s: which is which is i think one of the
3167.60s: things that happens with
3168.88s: people when they get into options is
3170.40s: that you see the benefits of it like you
3172.72s: you can make a lot of money with a
3174.16s: little bit of money
3175.20s: and you can make money when the stock
3176.80s: price doesn't move at all you can make
3178.72s: money when the stock price moves
3180.00s: in either direction and all these things
3182.24s: they seem better
3183.68s: than just passively investing but
3187.76s: i honestly i think it's a really bad
3189.44s: idea to kind of forget about traditional
3191.36s: investing
3191.92s: even though there are benefits to be had
3194.32s: with options
3195.60s: so i think i think i would agree with
3197.68s: you and i think for most
3199.28s: folks finding some sort of mix is
3202.08s: definitely the
3202.96s: the right balance for me personally
3206.48s: my margin account is all options i trade
3209.28s: all options and i've done that for
3211.04s: for over a decade and what i found
3214.56s: is exactly like you're saying for most
3217.84s: people it doesn't work well and
3221.20s: i think one of the reasons why it has
3223.44s: worked very well for me
3225.60s: is because the guy again i talk about
3228.16s: all my time
3228.96s: i talk about them all the time because
3231.04s: 80 of what i do
3232.88s: is a relic of this dude that's been
3234.72s: trading for 60 years
3236.24s: so my mentor he's retired and
3239.76s: he uses his portfolio for income
3243.20s: so while a lot of people are trading
3244.88s: spreads like you're talking about i
3246.64s: avoid spreads at all costs
3249.44s: and most of his trading is
3252.80s: covered strangles so not even like naked
3255.20s: strangles obviously you know
3256.96s: um but the way that he trades
3260.40s: is really identifying with your concept
3263.52s: of the
3264.00s: longer term game plan so he trades
3266.72s: primarily index etfs
3269.28s: i trade primarily index etfs as a again
3272.56s: just a relic of
3273.44s: the way he imprinted on me and one of
3276.72s: the things that he does
3278.00s: and this is exactly what i did in march
3280.24s: is
3281.20s: we allocate a certain amount of our
3284.72s: account to this trade then we figure out
3287.04s: how much we want to enter
3288.40s: so if i allocate 300 000 to this trade
3292.16s: i'm not going to enter with all 300k at
3294.08s: once i'm going to start with maybe
3295.92s: 100k or 150k on the initial outlay
3300.08s: and then it happened in march as soon as
3303.20s: the market started crashing i continued
3306.08s: to scale into the trade
3307.76s: until i hit my cap and then i just took
3310.48s: assignment
3311.20s: and then i exercised that long-term
3313.52s: point of view whereas i trade iwm a lot
3316.08s: so whereas i thought eventually the
3318.96s: market will recover
3320.08s: the market will be fine so i just sat on
3322.00s: a ton of stock
3323.76s: until the market started to move up and
3325.52s: then i completely unwind
3328.16s: so it's very interesting listening to
3330.88s: you talk about
3332.32s: your journey through active management
3335.20s: because i think
3336.64s: most people touch the keyboard and the
3339.04s: mouse too much
3340.48s: and they get in their own damn way for
3341.92s: somebody to take assignment
3343.60s: and then do nothing is so difficult
3346.64s: and they like folks don't realize that
3348.48s: that they want to try to manipulate the
3349.92s: trade and do all these other things
3352.24s: something i'm curious about and i'd love
3354.48s: to just
3355.44s: dig into like your journey because you
3357.60s: do a lot of self-analysis it's very
3359.20s: clear
3360.16s: how did you go about like truly getting
3363.52s: yourself
3364.56s: to slow down in terms of your
3366.40s: interactions you know with your trades
3368.40s: as much and becoming
3369.84s: more comfortable allowing your trade
3372.88s: and your initial you know assumption to
3374.96s: play out
3376.96s: i think that comes with experience and
3379.68s: just understanding
3381.76s: understanding that every impulse you
3383.20s: have doesn't need to be acted on
3385.04s: and i think that's a that's been a big
3386.64s: lesson for me so
3388.32s: how did you and also i think i
3391.52s: i kind of got too smart for my own good
3394.08s: where i almost would talk myself
3395.68s: out of almost every single trade yeah
3397.92s: because
3398.96s: the initial assumption would be like oh
3400.80s: xyz or apple stock is down today
3403.52s: therefore i should sell this put spread
3405.92s: because i can make
3407.36s: you know 300 of easy money but if it
3410.64s: plummets another
3411.52s: 20 then i'm gonna lose whatever thousand
3414.72s: whatever the number is and so
3418.08s: you could look at it like oh it's a
3419.52s: really high probability trade you have a
3421.28s: really high probability of making money
3423.44s: apple's a crowd favorite like it's
3425.28s: probably going to catch a bid at some
3427.36s: point
3427.76s: sure um so you should take you should
3429.60s: sell that spread right now because you
3431.28s: can
3432.64s: and i think i've talked myself out of a
3435.36s: lot of
3436.40s: impulsive trades like that because
3440.72s: you understand what can go wrong and you
3442.56s: understand that there's that specific
3445.04s: time frame associated with it as well so
3448.00s: how do you balance
3449.52s: to the other side right you like you're
3451.28s: saying you talked yourself out of a lot
3452.80s: of trades
3453.92s: um how do you get yourself then you know
3456.40s: to find the good trades to make
3459.20s: it's uh that's a hard question because
3462.16s: as i said earlier
3463.36s: in march i kind of got sucked back in
3466.16s: and i was i was doing
3468.08s: bad things and i was being too active um
3471.28s: but a lot of that a lot of the activity
3473.36s: was kind of trading around
3475.36s: stock positions okay um but i also did i
3479.12s: was making a lot of
3480.16s: speculative plays as well primarily the
3482.72s: number one thing i was doing
3484.40s: is i was betting on on a market decrease
3486.80s: again right after
3488.56s: the initial bounce in march in april um
3492.00s: and that never happened so i actually i
3493.60s: put i put too much money
3495.52s: into the into the high
3499.20s: high reward low risk plays i did a lot
3501.68s: of asymmetric bets i was basically
3503.44s: buying
3504.16s: puts in spy i had puts in iwm
3507.52s: got it i had calls and vxx not
3509.92s: necessarily all at once but these are
3511.36s: kind of positions that i was trading
3513.44s: and the market just kept going up and i
3515.44s: kept leading those positions out
3517.68s: right but i did make i did make a lot of
3520.00s: money on the initial decline
3521.76s: from vxx call options right because i
3524.72s: had
3525.60s: a lot of stocks in this main portfolio
3527.76s: that i'm talking about
3528.80s: and those were taken ahead and i as we
3531.36s: started to kind of
3532.56s: pinch into that decline and as i started
3534.88s: to
3535.92s: read more into the coronavirus headlines
3538.32s: and
3539.52s: kind of understand that this could be
3541.28s: something not so great
3543.20s: i started to actually put on long vxx
3546.48s: call positions
3548.16s: those those did really well so they
3550.56s: sheltered a lot of losses from the stock
3552.96s: going into the decline but then as we
3555.36s: rebounded back
3556.56s: i started to bet heavily again on
3559.12s: another
3560.00s: leg lower in the market right that was
3562.00s: those never happened so i
3563.36s: reasonable i've earned a lot of money
3565.04s: doing that
3567.20s: and also just like micromanaging around
3569.52s: those positions
3570.56s: you know like if if i bought vxx calls
3574.08s: on one day and then the market went up
3576.64s: then
3577.28s: i would buy more because the xx would be
3579.92s: lower
3580.56s: and they're out therefore i was kind of
3582.08s: scaling into that position and that's
3583.60s: how i was justifying it
3584.96s: but then maybe as we got a decline i
3587.44s: would kind of sell out too early so i
3589.12s: just got
3589.60s: i got way too active with that but to
3592.40s: answer your question like how
3593.84s: how do you select the trades these days
3597.28s: it's it's a difficult question but i
3600.56s: would say
3601.12s: i i didn't answer this earlier i said i
3602.96s: was i basically am doing one of three
3605.20s: things if i'm trading
3606.48s: the first is i'm putting on leveraged
3609.60s: upside plays which is primarily
3612.24s: long-term call options
3613.76s: in specific companies or it could be an
3616.48s: index
3617.20s: okay um like spy i had i had a couple of
3619.84s: those positions where
3621.20s: i purchased like the 350 calls in spy
3625.36s: for three dollars and they had like two
3628.08s: years two and a half years expiration
3630.00s: and i've tripled up on those and i've
3632.08s: since closed them
3633.60s: yeah those are like the bullish type of
3635.36s: plays that i'm doing
3636.64s: and tesla i have some pretty deep out of
3639.12s: the money call spreads
3640.48s: that i actually liked into so i
3642.40s: purchased
3644.08s: i purchased some calls in tesla that had
3646.88s: two years
3647.36s: expiration stock shot up on that same
3650.88s: day that i entered
3652.00s: and i was actually able to short the
3654.72s: same amount of calls at 100 points
3656.72s: higher
3657.36s: right and i collected the same amount of
3658.80s: premium so i essentially legged into a
3661.36s: call spread and my price is zero
3664.40s: and since the strike width is 100 um
3668.24s: the max profit on those is uh ten
3670.80s: thousand dollars
3671.68s: right so but the answer that there's no
3674.00s: risk anymore so
3675.04s: so if i'm really bullish on a stock long
3678.08s: term then i'll
3679.04s: i'll look to these leveraged upside
3681.52s: plays
3682.24s: yeah but other than that i'm either
3685.20s: selling a directionally neutral
3687.44s: index butterfly so i do uh iron
3690.08s: butterfly
3691.20s: strategy and spy or spx depends on
3694.32s: how i'm sizing it but that's a
3696.80s: directionally neutral
3698.16s: plane that yeah basically doesn't have a
3700.40s: lot of upside risk
3701.52s: the main risk is a severe decline in the
3703.92s: market right
3704.64s: that's like a completely systematic
3706.72s: strategy so that really does
3708.32s: i don't lose sleep over that right and
3710.00s: then the third way i'm trading is if i
3712.40s: have an existing stock position
3715.04s: such as one in tesla this is the exact
3717.60s: example of
3718.56s: when i use this if i have a stock
3720.72s: position that's
3721.60s: increased like absurdly in a short
3724.96s: period of time
3726.24s: and therefore the profitability of that
3727.92s: position is really high then i'll
3729.68s: actually look to
3730.56s: hedge that position by using a put or
3733.52s: put spread
3734.40s: got it so i did that in tesla
3737.92s: because the cost base is in the main
3739.84s: portfolio that is the stock and option
3742.00s: mix
3742.80s: um the cost basis of tesla shares is
3745.04s: like 210
3746.96s: okay and the stock price obviously is
3750.08s: absurdly high
3751.36s: it's shot way higher just a couple
3753.04s: months and so
3755.04s: going into the election and with all the
3757.04s: uncertainty that's still brewing with
3758.64s: coronavirus and everything
3760.16s: i purchased some of the 300 puts to
3763.28s: purchase two of the 300 puts in tesla
3765.52s: got it and i bought those for 15 and
3767.92s: those expired
3768.96s: in i think november and so
3772.48s: with that play the logic was tesla
3775.36s: shares i've already seen this
3776.56s: meteoric rise i have a lot of profits on
3778.96s: the stock position
3780.40s: but i can use this opportunity to buy
3782.80s: these put options
3784.00s: that are are really cheap now at that
3786.24s: strike price because the stock price has
3788.00s: gone
3788.48s: so high and since my cost basis is 210
3791.92s: on the shares
3792.80s: and i bought the 300 puts for 15
3796.32s: effectively like the minimum sale price
3798.80s: for those tesla shares through november
3800.40s: expiration is 285.
3802.32s: so i love that the strike price of 300
3804.72s: minus the cost of the puts is 285
3807.36s: right history price in the shares is
3808.96s: 211. so
3810.48s: if tesla shares go to zero i'm
3812.96s: guaranteed
3814.32s: to be able to sell to share that at 285
3817.44s: essentially
3818.16s: right effective sale price since i
3820.56s: bought the 300 puts
3822.00s: for 15 but like if tesla goes
3825.44s: tesla goes to zero i don't think
3826.80s: anybody's doing we're probably not
3828.48s: gonna be on the computer very much
3829.92s: yeah yeah who knows you never know
3833.20s: um but selecting i think selecting
3836.64s: trades is really hard
3837.76s: it's trader specific because everybody
3840.80s: has
3841.60s: kind of the signals that they look for
3843.68s: their own personal predictions
3845.68s: these days i'm not trying to make an
3847.84s: aggressive amount of predictions but i
3849.60s: do options when i have a stronger
3852.88s: conviction on a particular company
3854.64s: or i just want leveraged exposure like
3857.44s: let's say i have
3859.12s: a hundred and twenty-five thousand
3861.20s: dollars in an account
3862.48s: and i'm already invested with a hundred
3865.12s: thousand dollars of it
3866.40s: right 25 000 left over so maybe instead
3869.12s: of buying shares
3870.32s: of the company that i'm bullish on long
3872.00s: term instead of
3873.76s: spending that larger outlay maybe i'll
3876.08s: spend the same amount
3877.76s: or a fraction of that and just turn it
3880.00s: into an option play
3881.28s: and therefore i can get exposure to that
3883.92s: long-term move
3885.36s: and i don't have to necessarily break
3887.60s: the bank and doing it so i don't
3888.72s: necessarily have to
3889.84s: allocate the remaining amount of cash to
3891.68s: that one position
3892.88s: by using an option i can get the
3894.64s: leverage but i still have limited
3896.16s: downside if i'm wrong so yeah
3898.00s: i love how i think about it but how to
3900.32s: select trades is such a difficult topic
3902.40s: because
3903.20s: everybody has their own strategies
3905.28s: everybody has their own stocks
3906.72s: that they trade and their own
3909.20s: philosophies i think that's a
3910.88s: really difficult question to answer but
3914.24s: i try to be i try not to make as many
3917.36s: predictions
3918.80s: in the short term as i can so i try to
3921.52s: if i'm going to make it
3922.64s: leverage option play typically it's
3924.24s: going to have an expiration a couple
3926.16s: years out
3926.72s: and i think that's i actually love that
3928.80s: strategy as well
3929.92s: strategies me too maybe not right this
3932.40s: second but i know i'm going to employ
3934.00s: that strategy a lot in the future
3936.08s: yeah my um so something that i've always
3939.36s: appreciated
3940.32s: my my mentor for is whenever i would
3943.60s: feel like having an opinion on where an
3945.68s: underlying was going
3946.88s: he would essentially always just call me
3948.48s: a idiot and he would always say
3950.48s: like i'm worried about the wrong thing
3952.00s: he's like stop worrying about where
3953.20s: things are gonna go he's like start
3954.56s: worrying about money management he's
3956.16s: like
3956.64s: right at the end of the day and he's
3958.88s: really imprinted that on me where
3960.56s: like for most of my trades right now and
3963.04s: i truly mean it like
3964.24s: i couldn't care less where the
3965.60s: underlying goes because i i know what
3967.44s: i'm gonna do
3968.16s: if it plummets i know what it's gonna
3970.08s: what i'm gonna do if it goes
3971.28s: up and most of my strategies are covered
3974.64s: strangle so a big part of it is just get
3977.04s: ready to sit and wait
3979.04s: and as long as you're comfortable with
3980.56s: that and it takes it took me a long time
3982.64s: to get there and once your account
3984.00s: continues to grow it becomes easier and
3986.00s: easier since you have
3987.36s: additional capital to do other things
3988.80s: with as you see fit but
3990.64s: i love that you're talking about the
3993.84s: longer term long options i
3997.28s: very rarely buy premium but i do
4000.72s: and i i kind of scold people that you
4003.28s: know are
4003.92s: dead set on only buying or selling i
4006.08s: always feel like it's a pretty ignorant
4007.84s: position there's a time for both
4009.92s: right and the way that if i'm buying
4013.20s: options it's typically a leap and i'll
4016.96s: generally employ like some sort of ratio
4019.28s: diagonal so i'll still sell calls
4021.12s: against the longs
4022.48s: right but in contrast to your approach
4025.04s: where you'll go out of the money
4027.04s: obviously paying less i typically goes i
4030.00s: go very far
4030.88s: in the money so i can try to limit theta
4033.92s: decay on the position
4035.28s: and make sure you know i'm capturing
4037.04s: some intrinsic value
4038.56s: but trade-off is it's more expensive
4042.00s: but it's it's really cool to hear you
4044.72s: talk about
4046.40s: leaps because most people who are buying
4048.00s: options they're cheap you know what i
4049.12s: mean they want to buy it
4050.72s: in the next two weeks because it's a low
4052.80s: dollar amount but i've done it too i'm
4054.72s: guilty as well i'm just
4056.88s: just um yeah so i guess what you said
4060.96s: kind of builds on what i was saying
4064.24s: by talking myself out of trades is that
4065.92s: like if i'm going to put on this 30-day
4068.56s: option play that requires a specific
4070.32s: movement to happen
4071.44s: it could happen over the next three
4073.92s: months or the next year
4075.20s: but for me to put money on the line and
4077.68s: say
4078.56s: with high certainty that's going to
4079.84s: happen in the next 30 days
4081.76s: right those types of trades are they're
4084.08s: much more like gambling
4085.76s: they're much more speculative because i
4088.48s: i
4088.96s: use this term the path of the stock
4091.04s: price and basically what i mean by that
4092.88s: is
4093.20s: literally like the path of the stock
4095.52s: price takes over a specific period of
4097.52s: time
4098.56s: option option prices and option
4100.88s: positions
4101.84s: are entirely dependent on the path
4105.36s: that the stock price takes so for
4107.20s: example if you're going to say
4110.00s: netflix is overvalued it's whatever it
4112.88s: is
4113.12s: let's say it's 525 a share i don't know
4115.36s: where it is right now
4116.48s: and you think that netflix for sure is
4119.36s: going to be below
4120.48s: 600 in 30 days
4123.60s: or 60 days so for that reason you might
4126.80s: go out
4127.36s: to the 60-day expiration cycle and you
4129.76s: might short
4130.88s: the 600 call option just by itself
4133.60s: because you're
4134.64s: you're very convinced that netflix is
4136.56s: going to be below 660 days
4138.88s: and with the stock at 525 it's a very
4142.00s: high probability play
4144.08s: because it has to go up more than 75
4147.52s: by expiration for you to lose money on
4149.60s: that but
4150.80s: what a lot of people overlook is even
4153.12s: though that is
4154.24s: a high probability strategy you have to
4157.12s: keep in mind
4158.32s: what the stock path would mean for your
4161.12s: strategy so if the if the path of the
4162.88s: stock was just flat and traded at 525
4166.00s: through the 60-day period then you're
4168.08s: just gonna see steady decay on your 600
4170.16s: short call
4170.96s: and you're gonna make easy money but
4173.36s: let's say you
4174.00s: short that same call and the other path
4176.24s: that happens or a different path
4178.32s: is the stock goes from 525 and adapts to
4181.84s: 600 the next day
4183.52s: well now your assumption on the prior
4186.88s: day was
4187.44s: yeah there's a good chance netflix is
4188.96s: below 600 in the next 60 days
4191.20s: which is a high probability event at
4193.52s: that moment
4194.64s: and you could collect a few hundred
4197.28s: dollars on that option and you think
4198.88s: it's free money
4199.92s: but then if the stock price gaps higher
4202.80s: in the very short term after you enter
4204.64s: that trade
4205.36s: now you have this massive unrealized
4207.44s: loss on the short call
4209.28s: and now you're thinking well if it goes
4212.00s: to
4212.56s: 700 then i'm gonna be out a huge amount
4215.60s: of money
4216.24s: and so maybe you close that short paul
4219.36s: because you think that it's not worth
4222.80s: the risk anymore you've already lost a
4224.16s: lot you can't stomach
4225.36s: losing any more right and then right
4227.12s: after you get out of that call
4229.20s: the stock price maybe goes a little
4230.64s: higher gets sick gets to 610
4232.56s: but then it goes back to 575 550 goes up
4235.76s: to 575
4236.96s: and at the expiration date of your call
4239.36s: it's below
4240.00s: 600 like you thought initially but since
4242.56s: the stock path was
4243.76s: not accommodative at all in the initial
4245.84s: period and since you took
4247.68s: such such huge heat initially you got
4250.64s: shaken out
4251.68s: so i think it's to look at an option
4255.52s: position or a particular trade
4257.28s: instead of just looking at like here's
4259.04s: the max loss here's
4260.56s: the max profit like here's the
4262.08s: probability of profit
4264.00s: that's all at expiration you have to
4265.92s: think about what can happen before
4267.76s: expiration which is the stock price path
4270.32s: and what will be your reaction to those
4272.88s: movements and i think
4274.48s: thinking about the particular path that
4277.12s: a stock price can take i think it can
4278.56s: help you
4279.20s: understand the risk and kind of what can
4281.12s: go wrong as opposed to just saying
4283.36s: netflix is at 525 there's really high
4285.28s: probabilities that it's going to be
4286.96s: below 660 days
4288.88s: so i'm going to sell the short 600 it's
4290.80s: going to be easy money
4291.92s: which you could be right about your
4294.48s: assumption but
4295.60s: what happens in between entry and
4297.68s: expiration and how do you react
4299.52s: that can that can be a wild ride and it
4301.92s: can be awesome
4302.96s: i honestly are prepared for it
4306.00s: i absolutely love that example i really
4307.84s: do because i i also think a lot of
4310.08s: people when they're setting up you know
4311.68s: a higher probability trade let's just
4313.20s: say that was uh
4314.32s: 20 delta whatever it is and if you think
4317.44s: about
4318.56s: a lot of people forget the probability
4319.92s: of a touch which is exactly that you
4321.76s: know like
4322.48s: there's a pretty good likelihood at some
4324.24s: point your option is going to be
4325.60s: underwater
4326.24s: and exactly like you said even though
4328.64s: your entire long-term assumption
4330.32s: does in fact play out that shorter term
4333.20s: touch assumption
4334.24s: or just you know calculation also tends
4337.04s: to play out
4338.24s: and if you find yourself in that
4339.52s: scenario where you're not ready to see
4341.28s: your position
4342.00s: underwater and then what that actually
4343.76s: looks i love that i really do because a
4345.28s: lot of people
4346.40s: it seems like they're just so focused on
4348.64s: the probability when they enter
4350.08s: and then what that looks like at
4351.12s: expiration and the money they're going
4352.48s: to make
4353.84s: you know they forego kind of the interim
4355.68s: i think that that's a really good
4356.88s: conversation the other thing
4358.80s: that my mentor talks a lot about is
4360.88s: expectancy
4361.84s: because everybody wants to talk about
4363.44s: probability of profit everybody wants to
4364.88s: talk about
4365.68s: you know the likelihood of different
4367.12s: things happening but
4368.88s: that's like that's half of the equation
4371.20s: that matters
4372.24s: it doesn't mean anything you you exactly
4374.72s: and
4375.36s: like everybody wants to obsess over
4377.04s: these different metrics and
4378.56s: like you know like he always says he
4379.92s: doesn't get it you know and i'm always
4382.24s: i question him a lot on it and he's like
4383.92s: at the end of the day you know the
4385.28s: likelihood of something matters
4386.96s: 50 the other is what is your average p l
4389.84s: attached to those likelihoods
4391.76s: because like like you're saying right
4394.16s: there if you
4394.96s: if you're getting shaken out on a really
4397.36s: low paying but high probability trade
4400.72s: typically really poor expectancy because
4402.72s: as soon as you get that move against you
4404.40s: it's going to wipe out 8 10 trades
4406.48s: and then you know you're kind of sitting
4407.76s: there holding that i i find that
4409.92s: to be a really uncommon conversation
4412.72s: with people because they don't like to
4414.56s: think through that in term it's
4416.40s: it's i like that um i like that you
4419.04s: bring that up
4421.76s: another example would be uh
4424.80s: i think i think talking about
4428.48s: stock price paths is a very interesting
4430.48s: thing and this is something that you
4431.84s: kind of um
4433.44s: you'll read about if you read about like
4435.68s: more advanced
4436.56s: option pricing documents stuff like that
4439.36s: or you get into the more
4441.68s: academic side of things i should say and
4443.20s: you go like really deep on how
4445.04s: these things work but the path is like
4448.48s: it's it that's everything and not
4449.76s: frustrating is what could happen before
4452.72s: expiration right and that's kind of
4455.04s: where options prices get their
4457.20s: their prices from one of the i think
4459.60s: it's called the binomial
4460.96s: tree is one of the pricing so basically
4463.36s: it's like
4464.00s: here are all the potential paths of the
4465.76s: stock through
4467.60s: between now and expiration and if
4470.72s: those paths or each path is successful
4473.20s: here's what the option price will be
4475.44s: and basically it takes all of the
4477.20s: different potential paths
4478.80s: and then basically takes like a weighted
4480.64s: average of you know
4481.92s: adoption price values and that's the
4483.44s: option price sheldon talks so that i
4485.20s: think that's like a very
4486.16s: that's a very crude way of explaining it
4488.96s: and
4489.60s: if there's anybody who is effective much
4491.92s: more specific
4492.88s: like with that knowledge and they
4494.16s: understand exactly how that works
4496.32s: then maybe there are some holes in what
4498.48s: i just said but that's well
4500.24s: there's like one there's one that's one
4502.24s: way to to price an option is like yeah
4504.24s: calculate all the potential paths based
4506.56s: on the probability
4507.68s: and then you take the probability
4509.12s: weighted value of that option
4511.68s: at each one of those paths and then that
4514.08s: option price
4514.80s: yeah but as i was going to say earlier
4516.96s: another example would be
4518.96s: if you're extremely bullish on a stock
4520.96s: and you think
4522.00s: it's going to go up a lot of people are
4524.64s: gravitating towards the short term
4526.24s: options maybe seven days out
4527.84s: and they'll buy the ottoman call and
4531.12s: let's say you put you know 10 of your
4533.60s: account into that trade which is
4535.44s: obviously a large percentage pretty much
4537.44s: yeah
4538.72s: um and over the the next seven days like
4542.00s: the stock price kind of trends higher
4543.76s: maybe it gets closer to your strike but
4546.16s: it expires out of the money
4547.84s: and therefore you just lost 10 and then
4551.44s: the next week now the stock price just
4553.60s: shot higher
4554.56s: and your initial outlook was completely
4557.44s: accurate
4558.32s: except you just had the timing wrong
4560.88s: another way to say is that
4562.32s: the stock price path over the duration
4564.08s: of your trade was not
4566.00s: specific enough and you you didn't get
4568.00s: that part of it right and therefore
4569.92s: you were right overall but you were
4571.92s: wrong with your trade
4573.44s: yeah and obviously you'd have to kind of
4576.48s: match up your time frame with your
4578.00s: outlook but that's
4579.28s: again you can still miss out regardless
4581.52s: of what time frame you choose
4583.36s: and so that's kind of that's how that's
4586.32s: kind of how i think when i think about
4587.68s: the more speculative plays because i'll
4589.28s: admit like
4589.92s: if i'm not trading a specific trading
4592.16s: plan with the rules all laid out which
4594.16s: is basically the
4595.04s: s p 500 butterfly strategy right like
4598.08s: that's a short-term strategy because the
4600.48s: entry is 60 days out
4602.00s: i know exactly how i'm going to size it
4603.76s: relative to the account
4605.04s: i know exactly what is going to trigger
4607.28s: the trade to be
4608.08s: closed and then i know exactly when i'm
4610.00s: going to re-enter the trade so like
4611.84s: that's not it is speculative still
4613.92s: because it still requires
4615.68s: the market to accommodate the strategy
4617.92s: but the
4619.12s: every single trade is man it's exactly
4620.88s: the same right the sizing for each trade
4622.80s: is exactly the same
4623.92s: and so it's a very easy strategist to
4626.16s: follow
4627.28s: over a one year two year three year
4628.96s: period and
4630.96s: if you are going to allocate like a
4633.92s: specific amount of your account
4635.44s: to an active strategy like that i think
4637.52s: it has to be rules-based just so you can
4639.68s: number one keep your sanity but also if
4642.40s: you have consistency with
4643.84s: how you manage the position and
4645.60s: especially if you've done back testing
4647.20s: and you've seen
4648.48s: some encouraging results from that even
4650.32s: though it's not the same
4651.60s: that's better than just you know
4653.76s: choosing
4654.72s: 10 different stocks every month choose
4656.80s: your prediction and then
4658.00s: structure all these different types of
4659.36s: strategies around your predictions and
4661.44s: they're all
4662.00s: differently sized you're managing them
4663.60s: all different then at the end of the day
4665.84s: whether you're successful or not you
4667.76s: don't know if it was luck or you if
4669.68s: or if it was just from discipline so
4672.16s: yeah so that's
4672.88s: that's kind of like the really long
4674.40s: answer this is still on the
4676.40s: how do you choose trades thing i think
4678.48s: but um
4680.64s: yeah so like if it's if it's outside of
4682.64s: a predetermined system with rules then
4684.80s: i'm just fully understanding of the fact
4686.72s: that i'm speculating you know yeah
4688.88s: you have to accept that i talk a lot
4691.12s: about like trading plan and strategy
4693.44s: outlines for that exact reason because
4695.76s: i always tell people unless you learn to
4697.68s: like identify
4698.80s: monitor and control variables one you
4701.20s: can't replicate
4702.16s: and two you can't make adjustments in
4703.76s: any sort of calculated manner to see how
4705.84s: things go
4706.64s: so the way that i have my personal
4708.96s: portfolio broken out is i call them core
4711.20s: holdings which is probably exactly what
4712.80s: you'd assume it to be and then i have a
4714.32s: speculative portion
4715.92s: and in the speculative portion there's a
4717.76s: certain set of strategies that i'll
4719.44s: apply
4720.08s: and i have strategy outlines for all of
4721.76s: them for that exact reason exactly what
4723.36s: you're talking about
4724.16s: because the shotgun blast leads to
4726.80s: whatever results it's going to lead to
4728.40s: and then who knows what it will be next
4730.48s: time right
4731.68s: yeah i think that's a great way to learn
4733.44s: is to experiment a lot and do
4735.28s: a lot of that and be very active but i
4737.52s: think
4738.40s: if you really want to use options
4740.64s: systematically and you want to
4742.16s: like a lot of people want to trade
4743.84s: options for a living for income
4746.40s: that's the case you're not going to do
4748.88s: that by
4750.48s: by just doing all random strategies and
4752.88s: coming up with your own specific
4754.40s: predictions each week
4755.68s: or each month it's not going to happen
4758.32s: because
4759.44s: that requires you to be consistently
4762.48s: predicting short-term stock price
4764.32s: movements which nobody can do that
4766.24s: consistently and the shorter time you go
4768.32s: the more uncertain it is with whatever
4770.80s: your prediction is
4771.92s: so if i say the market's going to go up
4774.08s: by if i say the market's going to go up
4775.84s: tomorrow
4776.80s: versus the market's going to go up over
4778.48s: the next 10 years
4779.84s: there's a big difference between those
4781.20s: two statements right and the shorter the
4783.36s: term
4783.76s: the more it is like gambling i feel and
4787.36s: if you are really really active without
4790.48s: a plan
4791.04s: i also think that is gambling because
4794.32s: unless you have a very strict plan for
4796.88s: each strategy that you're trading
4798.32s: and you're sizing them all the same then
4800.88s: you can actually figure out
4802.32s: all right this strategy i managed them
4804.72s: all the same i sized them all the same
4806.72s: my results were x then you that's you
4809.44s: can actually
4810.32s: kind of reverse engineer that and kind
4811.68s: of study the performance
4813.44s: much more so than if you have 20
4816.32s: different trading strategies you're
4817.68s: using
4818.32s: you have 20 different stocks and you
4820.48s: have you're managing them all different
4822.48s: ways and you're sizing them all
4823.60s: different ways it's going to be much
4824.64s: harder
4825.28s: to attribute success or failure to one
4827.92s: single point
4828.80s: so yeah yeah and that's one of the
4831.44s: things that i think is people mature as
4832.96s: traders they start to
4834.24s: identify the sustainability of what
4836.00s: they're doing it's when i was in college
4838.00s: i used to really enjoy trading forex and
4840.16s: i was
4840.72s: like pretty good at it and then as i
4843.76s: you know started my career in the marine
4845.12s: corps i stopped trading forex
4846.88s: and it was weird to walk away from
4848.40s: something i was doing well at but then
4850.48s: when i did the post-mortem on it i
4852.08s: realized like the amount of time it was
4853.92s: taking me to like
4855.12s: adequately research what i felt
4856.88s: comfortable doing before i was placing
4858.88s: trades i was like this isn't sustainable
4860.48s: man like there's no way
4862.00s: i want or probably can continue this
4865.60s: and that's again when i kind of came
4867.92s: across my mentor i had that conversation
4869.52s: with him
4870.00s: he's just like stop worrying about
4871.44s: direction start figuring out how to
4873.04s: place trades
4874.08s: and work around them based on you know
4876.96s: money management like i said before
4878.64s: and it's exactly like you're saying like
4880.56s: if if you're trying to consistently
4882.56s: like guess short term returns
4885.60s: you're just leaving it up to chance pure
4887.76s: chance and that's something that
4889.92s: he talks a lot about and i i share
4893.04s: on his behalf where when
4896.32s: i was like in the phase where i was
4897.92s: aggressively growing my account
4899.76s: i tell people i target at least 15
4903.12s: return per year sometimes that will
4906.08s: underperform the s p 500
4907.92s: a lot of other times it will outperform
4909.44s: the s p 500 kind of just depending on
4911.20s: where things lie
4912.56s: and what he always taught me
4915.60s: is once you're starting to get closer to
4917.92s: retirement to draw on this account
4919.84s: he's like you're out of your mind if
4921.84s: you're going to continue using that 15
4923.76s: as your planning variable like
4924.96s: especially when you depend on your
4926.16s: income so he's like when you're doing
4927.60s: your planning factor
4929.12s: make sure you have enough money that you
4931.36s: can crank that all the way down to
4933.04s: five six percent somewhere in there and
4935.76s: still get the amount of money you want
4937.28s: per month in order to live off of it and
4938.88s: that was just an eye-opening concept
4941.20s: because you know 15 per year is really
4944.00s: good
4944.40s: you know it's nothing astronomical like
4946.40s: you said there's that dude doing 30 for
4948.08s: like 15 years
4949.76s: but it's modest and it's something
4951.44s: that's attainable and it was weird to me
4953.20s: to hear him kind of even scold
4955.04s: that once you're trying to reliably draw
4957.44s: on it so i think it
4958.80s: reinforces the point you're making that
4960.88s: you you
4961.84s: trying to trade in a way that you have
4964.40s: to be correct
4965.36s: and you need to perform well in order to
4967.84s: get what you need to get can be
4969.52s: one very stressful and then two sets you
4972.08s: up for failure in a pretty big way
4974.16s: right you got to have you got to have a
4975.68s: plan if you look at
4977.52s: if you look at any professional trader
4980.32s: meaning they
4981.12s: they trade at a trading firm
4984.40s: they have a trading plan right like 99
4987.04s: of them
4987.52s: there's there's probably very few
4989.12s: traders that you'll talk to that don't
4991.28s: have any
4991.92s: resemblance of a plan and they're just
4994.40s: they're successful
4995.36s: year after year just from just from
4998.72s: their predictions that are coming out of
5000.16s: their head
5000.56s: yeah there has to be some sort of plan
5002.96s: as the backbone
5003.92s: if you are going to trade very actively
5007.20s: and especially if you're going to put
5009.44s: like a serious amount of capital
5011.44s: into those strategies yeah yeah i
5014.80s: something that um obviously i know that
5017.44s: we're well over now and like i said i
5019.36s: i really do respect your time so thank
5021.36s: you something i'm really curious about
5023.52s: on that same vein though
5024.88s: in in your thought process i get the
5027.36s: sensation
5028.64s: that some people when they start trading
5031.36s: and they're applying
5032.56s: their time they feel like they deserve
5036.08s: a certain return because they're
5038.24s: applying that time i'm sitting in front
5040.08s: of the computer all of this time
5042.32s: i should get x return at the end of the
5044.16s: year and
5045.84s: like we've both been talking about again
5048.72s: like i read a lot of white papers from
5051.36s: mit university of california in
5053.36s: everything unanimously
5054.88s: in terms of those studies says the more
5057.20s: you touch the computer
5058.64s: the lower the average return is for
5061.12s: those folks
5062.48s: so i'm curious what your thoughts are
5065.60s: in having those conversations with those
5067.52s: people because that's something i find
5068.88s: myself doing a lot like trying to
5070.72s: have a conversation to save people from
5072.72s: themselves
5073.84s: and essentially letting them know that
5076.48s: you know
5077.68s: you don't deserve and at the end of
5081.04s: the day
5081.68s: like the more you touch the computer the
5083.12s: worse off you are but a lot of people
5084.72s: you know refute that
5086.16s: have you had a conversation like that
5087.84s: with anybody i'm curious how you'd
5089.20s: approach that dialogue
5091.28s: um i've had people through email
5093.36s: correspondence that'll say
5095.28s: that they've been emailing me for a
5096.72s: while yeah they've been
5098.80s: they've been learning for probably over
5101.28s: a year in some cases
5102.80s: um and they they kind of get discouraged
5105.84s: because they feel like
5107.20s: well they'll say things like you know
5108.80s: there's so much to this option stuff
5110.48s: like it's really really a lot
5112.40s: and it's true and the i'm not sure
5115.60s: you're probably familiar with the
5117.36s: dunning-kruger effect
5118.72s: which is essentially as soon as you get
5121.76s: involved in something new you feel like
5124.08s: you're a genius and you know everything
5126.16s: and then that's like the peak of the
5128.40s: like introduction
5129.60s: phase of learning something new and then
5131.68s: the more you learn
5132.88s: then it goes back into like negative
5134.48s: territory which is like wow i don't know
5136.56s:  i don't know yeah and then as
5138.96s: you continue to get more
5140.00s: experience you get closer to that
5142.72s: initial baseline
5144.24s: where you realize that you know a lot
5147.52s: but you still are you're still
5150.24s: acknowledging the fact that there's more
5151.76s: to know
5152.32s: yes i think options training is a
5154.16s: perfect example of that because
5156.64s: as soon as you come out of the gates and
5158.08s: you have like your first few months of
5159.60s: learning
5160.08s: you feel like you're on top of the world
5162.00s: and you know everything and you're going
5164.24s: to be rich
5165.52s: and then months later or a couple years
5168.88s: later
5169.60s: you're continuing to learn and then you
5171.12s: realize wow like everything
5173.20s: in the past that i thought was a holy
5175.20s: grail strategy it's about to be a holy
5177.04s: grail strategy
5178.24s: turns out that this is very very
5179.92s: difficult there's a lot to know
5182.00s: before you can even get to a playing
5184.08s: field where you're not making you're not
5185.44s: losing money from mistakes or not
5187.04s: knowing something right you're losing
5188.32s: money because you're wrong
5189.68s: yes and options is one of the most
5192.40s: humbling things because
5194.24s: you could know everything there is to
5196.08s: about options trading and still
5197.76s: it does not guarantee that you're gonna
5199.28s: make it still be wrong
5200.80s: and that's a very difficult thing to
5202.80s: swallow for most people
5204.16s: yeah but it's true like there's just
5207.28s: because you know everything about
5208.48s: options and how they work
5210.48s: the next step is to actually implement
5212.48s: them in scenarios where they
5214.08s: profit yeah there's no guarantee that
5216.48s: you can do that
5217.52s: consistently over time and so
5221.12s: and so that's another reason why i i
5223.60s: focus
5224.16s: most of my savings into passively
5227.12s: investing because i know that
5228.80s: over a long period of time compound
5231.20s: interest can
5232.64s: can grow whatever i put in now
5235.76s: hundreds of times thousands of times in
5237.60s: some cases depending on
5238.88s: whatever you put it into but
5242.48s: i don't want to risk i don't want to
5244.32s: risk having to be right about every
5246.32s: prediction that i make knowing that i'm
5248.40s: going to be wrong on a lot of
5249.52s: predictions right
5250.56s: and i don't want to structure i don't
5252.40s: want to structure my financial future
5254.08s: around having to be right
5255.84s: consistently in the short term over a
5258.32s: long period of time it's just too
5259.60s: stressful for me so
5261.12s: dude so yeah like options is the more
5263.84s: the more you know the better because you
5265.36s: can avoid
5266.64s: you can avoid catastrophic losses
5268.48s: through mistakes or just not knowing
5270.32s: something
5271.20s: yeah but there is there is a certain
5274.96s: amount of time you have to put in before
5277.28s: you get to a point where you're pretty
5279.84s: comfortable that you know
5281.60s: like pretty much all there is that you
5283.28s: need to know there's obviously always
5285.44s: going to be more to learn
5286.72s: yeah and like i i consider myself to be
5289.68s: an expert but i know that i don't know
5291.28s: everything there's always more
5292.80s: to learn but once you get to that point
5294.96s: where like you know
5297.28s: everything or as much as you need to
5299.20s: know to actually implement these things
5302.00s: whenever you see fit and you know what's
5303.84s: going to happen given certain scenarios
5306.32s: with this position
5307.44s: it still doesn't guarantee that you're
5309.04s: going to make money and that's that's a
5310.72s: difficult thing to
5312.72s: to digest but it's true yeah it's i
5315.84s: i like to talk a lot about it in terms
5317.68s: of you know like the
5318.88s: the practical understanding versus the
5321.04s: scholastic understandings a lot of
5322.56s: people can
5323.60s: go really far in their scholastic
5326.08s: understanding
5326.88s: of options or whatever they're doing but
5329.60s: unless you learn how to like practically
5331.36s: apply it
5332.16s: it's you know just the scholastic
5333.68s: understanding and you know
5335.36s: because things scholastically should
5338.24s: work
5338.72s: out x y and z way it doesn't mean in a
5342.08s: practical sense that it's going to so
5344.08s: i think that it's honestly really
5346.80s: impressive
5347.76s: um on your end that you've kind of
5350.96s: acknowledged and looked through the way
5353.20s: that you trade and said
5355.12s: yes you know i'm an options trader but
5357.76s: financially
5358.96s: it literally makes sense for me to have
5361.20s: this kind of two-prong approach
5362.96s: with passive investments an option i
5365.04s: seriously respect that so much
5366.72s: because a lot of people that start
5368.96s: options
5369.84s: trading i mean like i said i trade
5371.92s: pretty much only options
5373.76s: and there's just so many of us that i
5376.80s: talk to
5377.44s: they again think that well if i just
5379.68s: continue to trade i'll pick it up and
5381.68s: i'll start making money
5383.28s: and you know for a lot of people they
5385.44s: just are throwing away their future
5387.44s: wealth
5388.00s: you know chasing something that they're
5391.28s: just not performing on so i think that
5393.60s: that's really awesome
5394.72s: and i think um i think the situation you
5397.68s: want to avoid and this is another reason
5399.52s: why i
5400.32s: buy you know i'm buying stocks and
5402.88s: buying bitcoin because i'm a bitcoiner
5406.80s: but i'm buying these things and
5408.88s: investing long term
5410.88s: because i don't want to be in a
5412.72s: situation where if i was only trading
5415.04s: options
5415.60s: and in a year the stock market goes up
5417.92s: 20
5418.80s: and i happen to lose money trading
5420.48s: options then that's a bad situation to
5422.96s: be in because it's horrible yeah because
5424.64s: you don't want to see the market go up
5426.00s: 20
5426.56s: when everyone else made 20 and you lost
5429.04s: money because you didn't have
5430.48s: any slice of that and so that's that's
5432.80s: kind of
5433.52s: another reason why i'm structuring that
5436.00s: way and i just think
5437.12s: it's i think it's irrational for me
5440.32s: to think that i am so smart where i
5443.44s: my predictions are always going to be
5444.88s: true yeah that's why i
5447.12s: with the majority of my free savings
5450.72s: i am investing that long term but
5453.76s: like talking about rational versus
5456.24s: irrational
5457.28s: like i think the most rational thing for
5459.44s: me to do
5460.40s: or most reasonable thing for me to do
5463.28s: would be to take
5464.40s: all of my savings and just put it in
5468.00s: a passive index fund and just put all of
5470.32s: that money into the next one and just
5471.84s: let it run it
5472.96s: for whatever the rest of my life and let
5475.84s: that grow
5476.72s: but just because i i think that is the
5479.36s: most rational thing for me to do doesn't
5481.12s: mean i'm gonna
5482.00s: not be irrational with a small portion
5483.92s: of my mind i enjoy
5486.00s: i enjoy making predictions i enjoy
5488.40s: trading options
5489.52s: yeah and i enjoy you know learn
5493.04s: implementing the things that i've
5494.16s: learned over the past
5496.16s: few years so like just because
5499.28s: just because there's like a an obvious
5501.92s: like rational approach
5503.44s: doesn't mean i'm going to actually
5504.64s: follow that that's just that's just
5506.64s: human nature that that's not just with
5508.80s: trading that's with everything like i
5511.84s: think everyone can agree
5513.60s: the most rational thing for me to do
5515.20s: would be to get up every day
5516.80s: and i should probably work out every day
5518.96s: exercise every day because that's going
5520.64s: to be
5521.12s: good for me long term but even though
5523.92s: people know that they don't do that
5525.92s: and so there's a you have to understand
5528.56s: that like we're all human and we're
5529.84s: going to
5530.24s: do things that are irrational and it's
5532.56s: it's fine
5533.84s: it's it's i it's a really fun
5536.56s: conversation in in kind of hearing that
5538.56s: that
5538.96s: side of things because i i am the dude
5541.76s: that wakes up every day and works out
5543.12s: because i know i'm supposed to but also
5545.36s: eat i had pizza last night which i know
5547.28s: i'm not supposed to do it's that same
5548.88s: thing right why would i go 3 000
5550.56s: calories of chinese food i actually
5552.40s: yeah that i'm glad i ordered orange
5554.96s: chicken and
5556.16s: generous chicken because i have
5557.68s: leftovers that i get right
5560.08s: now i get to indulge two days in a row
5562.00s: that's beautiful
5564.00s: there's only supposed to be a cheat
5565.28s: sunday yeah but i mean i also
5567.92s: i would argue that by continuing to
5569.84s: trade options i mean who knows man like
5572.16s: you absolutely can continue developing
5574.56s: your approach and just
5576.00s: find the next thing that works for you
5577.52s: because something that my mentor always
5579.60s: told me is like
5580.56s: when you're retired you can't draw
5583.28s: monthly income via trading stocks
5586.48s: not consistently so he's like you have
5588.96s: to understand
5589.84s: a way to use your capital to be if you
5592.72s: want to draw for income right
5594.08s: um but again like by continuing to trade
5597.76s: options no matter what
5599.28s: we're still developing a skill set that
5601.36s: in the future very likely can be very
5603.28s: helpful to us
5604.48s: yeah that's a great that's a great point
5606.32s: that's uh it's a positive point i feel
5608.00s: like we've talked about a lot of maybe
5609.52s: discouraging things today
5611.36s: and i don't want to be discouraging
5612.88s: whatsoever but what you just said is
5615.76s: perfect because
5617.44s: as i just said to you that i'm not
5619.36s: trading options every single day i'm not
5621.28s: like
5621.60s: super super active with it but i do do
5623.68s: it but
5625.28s: there is there's always value and having
5629.28s: knowledge so there's this quote that my
5631.20s: brother said he said fortune favors the
5633.44s: prepared mind
5634.56s: i think this this guy louis louis
5637.28s: pasteur
5638.00s: said it initially yeah and now i'm now
5640.16s: that's how i close out my
5641.44s: newer youtube videos perfect portion
5643.36s: papers have prepared mine
5645.28s: so even though it may not be in your
5648.88s: best interest to be
5650.72s: trading options like 30 times a day or
5652.80s: whatever it is or using them actively
5655.20s: and just because you know the kind of
5657.44s: the odds are stacked against
5658.88s: active traders like the more active you
5660.48s: are the worse you'll do statistically
5662.80s: speaking
5663.84s: it doesn't mean that it's a bad thing
5667.04s: to learn something because for example
5670.64s: let's say you give up on options you
5673.04s: don't know how options work because
5674.48s: they're
5674.88s: too complicated or you hear this
5676.08s: conversation and now you're discouraged
5677.44s: and they're like yeah that
5679.60s: um and then you just you don't you don't
5682.64s: learn about options and then let's say
5685.44s: you have a million dollar stock
5687.84s: portfolio
5688.88s: that grows immensely over over a
5692.16s: multi-decade period
5693.76s: and then there is something that happens
5696.48s: in the world
5697.12s: where you have this prediction maybe
5699.68s: that you want to protect against some
5701.60s: very unfortunate outcome with your stock
5704.56s: portfolio
5705.44s: so one thing you could do you could
5706.96s: purchase put options in
5708.96s: the s p 500 index and that would
5711.20s: effectively
5712.08s: hedge your stock portfolio and if you
5715.60s: understand the way that you could
5717.44s: structure that to protect yourself
5719.68s: against
5720.16s: catastrophic loss if you're correct
5722.00s: about this prediction
5723.28s: but you only give up a small portion of
5725.84s: your profits
5726.80s: if you're wrong then if you understand
5729.60s: options you know how to do that exactly
5731.36s: you can structure that trade
5733.44s: but if you have no idea how options work
5735.60s: then there's no way you could ever use
5737.20s: them
5737.68s: in any situation that could benefit you
5740.64s: when you could be
5741.60s: implementing them with some sort of
5743.76s: prediction that you have
5745.28s: um and so i think there's a lot of value
5747.68s: in knowledge i'm a
5749.04s: i'm a huge bookworm myself i love
5751.20s: learning i love reading about
5752.80s: different perspectives just because i
5754.40s: think anything that can broaden your
5756.16s: perspective or
5757.44s: see something from a different angle i
5759.12s: think that is immensely valuable
5761.76s: and so to go along with that i think
5763.68s: there's
5764.80s: excuse me i think there's a ton of value
5767.20s: in understanding
5769.28s: active trading having experience with
5771.04s: active trading knowing how
5772.88s: options work knowing how futures work
5775.12s: how the financial markets work in
5776.64s: general
5777.36s: i think understanding all those things
5779.60s: it's never going to be a bad
5781.04s: thing to know those things because when
5783.36s: the time comes
5784.72s: if you are prepared with this knowledge
5786.72s: then there could be times where you say
5788.96s: i know exactly what i need to do and i
5790.72s: need to do it tomorrow because i already
5792.88s: i don't need to learn
5794.08s: i already know everything that i need to
5796.32s: know for this particular play
5798.24s: and here's what i'm going to do and i'm
5799.60s: going to put this trade on and
5801.92s: that's it you know if you don't have the
5803.84s: knowledge and never spent the time
5805.36s: learning about something then you're not
5807.12s: going to be you can't identify that
5809.20s: circle yeah you can't open that door for
5810.80s: yourself yeah i think
5812.32s: i think understanding options
5816.16s: is hugely valuable and you learn a ton
5819.36s: about financial markets
5820.72s: and through the process of learning
5822.48s: options you learn about yourself you
5824.16s: learn about
5825.20s: you know the the trading kind of
5827.44s: psychology like everything that goes
5828.80s: along with trading
5830.08s: yeah i think a lot of value in all those
5832.08s: things
5833.12s: especially if you get to
5836.40s: even if it's even if it's a thing where
5837.84s: you get to a point where you realize you
5839.76s: know maybe i don't want to be an active
5841.12s: trader maybe i do want to be a passive
5843.04s: investor
5844.08s: but if you learn those things sooner
5845.52s: than later it's going to be better
5847.60s: than learning them later and it's based
5849.36s: on you know your experience so
5851.12s: yeah it's easier for you to deploy with
5853.44s: conviction
5854.24s: right like i'm so i'm so grateful that i
5857.44s: have all the experience that i have
5859.60s: because if i was if i didn't have a lot
5862.88s: of experience
5863.84s: in investing or especially active
5866.48s: trading with options maybe
5868.96s: i would just be getting into it today
5871.20s: and maybe i have
5872.72s: you know a hundred thousand dollars
5874.08s: saved up that i saved up over the last
5875.60s: 10 years yep
5876.72s: and now i'm just starting to learn about
5878.80s: options with
5880.40s: no prior experience or knowledge but i
5882.56s: have more money now and i'm learning
5884.08s: with a larger
5885.76s: larger stack of cash and now i make
5887.68s: these mistakes let's say i wipe out 10
5889.36s: years of savings because i didn't
5890.72s: understand
5891.92s: how these things work and that's not a
5893.92s: situation you want to begin so i think
5895.84s: learning
5897.44s: learning is learning about these things
5899.84s: is going to always be valuable because
5901.92s: at the very least you can avoid
5903.28s: landmines and
5904.96s: knowledge and experience is always a
5907.04s: good thing no matter what
5908.40s: so yeah yeah and i mean i i think just
5911.44s: like you're saying
5912.32s: exploring different perspectives and you
5914.40s: know life views and whatnot it's
5915.76s: literally the entire purpose of this
5917.12s: entire segment
5918.00s: is exactly that because i do find a
5919.60s: tremendous value in it
5921.20s: and i know when i first started trading
5923.76s: options
5924.72s: like most i was struggling and not doing
5926.88s: very well and then
5928.32s: when i was able to like drill down
5930.96s: mentor for
5931.68s: like literally forced me to write a
5933.28s: trading plan to pay-per-trades like take
5935.04s: this
5935.52s: seriously then for me i've been
5939.12s: just so fortunate with the way that it
5942.40s: is
5943.04s: changed my trajectory and it's not from
5946.48s: you know any sort of pure luck it's just
5948.08s: from like taking the time to
5949.92s: like truly sit down and understand
5952.24s: these things in how i can apply them
5955.44s: and i think for a lot of people you know
5958.24s: no matter
5958.80s: what capacity you choose to apply you
5961.20s: know something like options or whatever
5962.56s: there's just a lot of utility in them
5964.16s: whether
5964.64s: you're like me and you trade them
5965.76s: exclusively or like you and you trade
5967.52s: them as a component of a larger
5969.04s: portfolio
5970.24s: the biggest thing about trading and i
5972.00s: think dovetailing off your psychology
5973.76s: comment man it's individual to the
5975.44s: person man everybody works differently
5977.52s: you have an incredible amount of
5978.80s: self-awareness so do i in the sense that
5980.88s: like i know i don't know
5983.04s: so i just try to do what i know
5986.08s: and learn as much as i can and that's
5988.80s: generally my approach and like
5990.32s: your self-awareness has led you to a
5992.16s: place where you know you can get sleep
5993.84s: now you're comfortable with what you're
5995.04s: doing stuff like that because
5996.80s: there's so many people i mean i
5998.48s: mean you saw that kid that killed
5999.76s: himself
6000.40s: because of some that wasn't even
6001.92s: real right you know what i mean like
6004.00s: just it's just insane so i totally agree
6006.96s: with you that
6007.60s: you know just taking the time to get the
6008.80s: education is super important and
6010.64s: helpful yeah and
6013.68s: as a as a final note on that i think
6017.84s: having experience with active trading
6020.56s: and having experience with options
6022.64s: but mostly just like having experience
6024.48s: being super active
6026.08s: in the markets can make you a much
6028.56s: better
6029.12s: passive investor as well because it can
6032.00s: teach you
6033.28s: it can teach you about the impulses that
6035.84s: you feel in certain situations
6037.84s: and then it can teach you that the best
6040.32s: thing to do is probably
6041.60s: nothing you know it's like with your
6043.44s: option positions you could
6045.04s: you could be swayed to deviate from your
6047.28s: trading plan
6048.32s: because of some short-term movement and
6051.04s: when in reality you know that
6052.64s: you have to follow the trading plan and
6054.08s: you can't you shouldn't touch it right
6056.56s: so from the traditional investing
6058.80s: long-term investing perspective
6060.80s: if you are buying stocks let's say you
6063.12s: buy this company that
6064.00s: you love and then the next month the
6066.00s: stock's down 30
6067.76s: if you have a lot of market experience
6070.24s: and active trading experience then
6071.60s: you'll know that things don't always go
6073.36s: according to plan
6074.56s: right in fact more often than not they
6077.28s: don't go according to plan
6080.32s: if you're equipped with that mindset i
6082.32s: think it can be
6084.00s: very informing and it can help you make
6087.12s: better decisions overall so i i
6089.60s: definitely attribute
6091.12s: whatever whatever future success i have
6094.08s: with
6094.80s: passive investing i think a large part
6097.60s: of that success
6099.04s: is going to be attributed to my
6101.60s: experiences with more active approaches
6104.16s: so i think having the active approach
6105.84s: for having the active experience
6107.36s: can make you a better long-term investor
6110.24s: and more passively
6112.00s: it's powerful honestly i've never i
6114.24s: truly have never sat down to think of it
6116.08s: that way and that's a really powerful
6118.32s: comment and i literally as i hear you
6120.96s: talking about i couldn't agree with the
6122.16s: sentiment more
6123.52s: i think that that makes a ton of sense
6125.84s: dude so
6127.36s: the other day experience from saul
6128.88s: that's it fact never
6130.72s: never a bad thing to have knowledge or
6132.32s: experience so yeah don't
6134.32s: don't let this conversation discourage
6136.64s: you if you're an aspiring obstructor
6138.72s: we basically we we kind of just talked
6141.20s: to talks through
6143.28s: years and years of experience and kind
6145.20s: of the psychological
6147.04s: rollercoaster that you have over that
6148.88s: whole experience too so hopefully
6150.72s: people that are just getting started or
6152.40s: maybe just a couple years in
6154.40s: hopefully those people can can learn
6156.96s: from
6157.44s: the things that we talked about today
