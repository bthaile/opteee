0.00s:  Well, well, well, what's up everybody?
3.24s:  It looks like we have a light crowd to start.
6.20s:  So I'll give it a couple moments for folks to make their way in.
11.28s:  And then we will, we'll kick things off.
14.24s:  I'm also going to make sure that we are all posted out across.
22.88s:  Social media, make sure we have our Twitter post up.
28.92s:  And then I'll grab the chat in just a second.
32.40s:  Make sure that we have the ability to communicate.
36.24s:  I want to make sure I can say hi to everybody.
39.04s:  Make sure it's cool.
42.24s:  All right.
45.72s:  So it looks like we're good.
51.36s:  Let me grab the chat.
54.72s:  There we go.
56.72s:  We got Elon's songs, aka Liz.
59.56s:  What's up?
60.56s:  Good to see you Liz.
62.36s:  Pleasure is always have opportunity to catch up.
65.56s:  We got Brennan gate coming in hat and what up Brennan gate.
69.24s:  Good to see you as well.
71.56s:  Cool.
72.56s:  We are getting our peeps in the house, our ducks in a row and we're getting ready to kick
76.68s:  this thing off.
77.68s:  I'm I in.
78.68s:  That's a fun name.
79.68s:  What's going on?
80.68s:  I'm I in.
81.68s:  I'm not sure if I recognize your name.
82.28s:  So if you're new, welcome, if you're not new, sorry.
85.04s:  I don't always recognize the names because there's there's not that many of them.
88.60s:  Let's let's not pretend that like I'm some popular YouTuber.
90.76s:  I'm not.
91.76s:  But we also should not pretend that I have a good memory because I also don't.
101.64s:  Brennan gate says super low volume on GME today.
104.24s:  Yeah.
105.24s:  I kind of hit that a little bit in the GME update video.
109.60s:  We'll dive really far into GME come next week or next week.
114.08s:  I'm in it.
115.08s:  It tomorrow next week.
117.44s:  Tomorrow we're going to do like a GME specific live stream to like really, really get into
121.48s:  the weeds.
122.48s:  I want to go through the recent bad bath and beyond case, which is kind of related to GME
126.32s:  through Cohen and whatnot.
127.76s:  We also got Mr Simpson or Mrs Simpson fart Simpson to be specific.
131.48s:  What up?
132.48s:  Good to see you.
133.48s:  All right.
134.64s:  So today's session is designed to be a brown building in options trading portfolio.
141.36s:  So I think this is the 10th session in this total series.
146.52s:  And we've covered a lot like I was looking back at the topics that we've had listed so
151.28s:  far.
152.28s:  There's been a ton of stuff that we've hit, which is awesome.
155.16s:  It's absolutely awesome.
156.16s:  It's exactly what I wanted to be able to do.
160.64s:  Now the game plan is for today.
162.64s:  I want to go through this overview.
164.84s:  And again, this is still interactive.
166.68s:  Let the format here with there being a blackboard.
172.04s:  Think that this is like some sort of presentation style session.
175.12s:  It's not.
176.12s:  It's just to capture some things that I think will be useful for us to discuss.
180.36s:  And then the game plan is once we get through enough of this, what we'll do is actually pop
186.40s:  over here, going to on demand.
189.56s:  And we will build a, we'll actually build a portfolio.
195.32s:  Shrejish says, where's the manager of the outfit?
197.24s:  Haven't seen that's a great point.
198.48s:  One second, I'm going to get that bum.
200.20s:  He just got all laid up here.
202.12s:  Let's grab that and we'll get, we'll get the star of the show.
207.04s:  Here he is.
214.76s:  Ready to go.
216.08s:  He's a little, he's a little disgruntled because I did just take him out of his bed.
221.64s:  But as you can tell, he's ready to start talking about some options.
225.00s:  He's eager even.
228.12s:  How do you feel about portfolios?
229.64s:  Do you have anything to say?
232.68s:  Nothing.
233.68s:  So really what he's trying to communicate there with the portfolio thing where there
237.44s:  was kind of like a lack of a statement, that was actually very, very tactical, right?
242.92s:  Because he was saying that the portfolio is very individual to the trader.
248.08s:  So it is super important for the individual to build their own portfolio.
252.48s:  That's what he's trying to say.
253.84s:  So he does speak kind of in riddles.
256.12s:  You have to pay really close attention.
257.76s:  See like right now, he's saying you have to like face away from your problems.
262.04s:  Whenever you see some sort of issue, you can choose to confront them dead on or you could
267.08s:  essentially just rest your head on the shoulder because you've built a robust portfolio that
272.00s:  can handle the problems for you.
273.52s:  So he's really just dropping dimes if you guys aren't picking up all this stuff.
278.84s:  That's what he's doing.
279.96s:  I am going to return him to his bed so that he can get back to his supervisory duties.
290.20s:  He literally just like laser straight to the bed.
292.24s:  That's hilarious.
295.16s:  So yes, Shrej, don't you worry about it.
298.20s:  The boss is still in the house.
300.52s:  He's still monitoring everything that's going on.
304.80s:  He keeps it real.
306.72s:  All right.
307.08s:  So the rules for the road today is I'm going to run through some of the questions that
312.32s:  we got in the beginning because some of these provide a bit of context.
316.76s:  And then for this one specifically with Ian's question, we'll actually go through some examples
321.92s:  together.
322.92s:  So we'll hit that a little bit later in the session.
325.08s:  Now as per always, the name of the game here is interact.
329.48s:  So as soon as you have a question, let me know if there's something that we really want
334.20s:  to go down a separate rabbit hole.
336.60s:  I'll kind of make a note of that so that we can revisit it.
341.04s:  But I want to make sure that we have a open conversation so we can really hit the stuff
347.92s:  that you guys want to cover.
349.64s:  So let's get into it.
352.84s:  Shrejinger says, how does your only fans' income supplement your covered calls?
357.32s:  Unfortunately, I get no income from only fans.
360.16s:  I think that they actually are charging me to be on the platform right now.
364.16s:  It's this weird thing, but they were talking about how ugly I am in that there's like an
368.36s:  ugly tax, which is super frustrating because I see these other people on only fans that
373.96s:  are crushing it literally making more in a year than I have in like a decade long period.
380.36s:  So it's very soul, soul dismantling.
385.28s:  But yeah, so the only fans has been really tough out there.
391.04s:  As I've kind of mentioned to you, I realize why they name it the had.
393.28s:  It's because I am my only fan.
395.76s:  So unfortunately, there's no dice.
400.24s:  Brennan Gates says, when and why do you start trading?
402.08s:  I started trading 2007 and I started trading because I had a teacher that introduced me
409.32s:  to the idea of investing because he knew that I grew up poor and I wanted to figure out
413.76s:  how to make a bunch of money.
414.92s:  That was the idea.
415.92s:  So I started trading in 2007 while I was in high school still.
421.24s:  And I graduated high school, I think in 2009.
425.12s:  And I started with kind of just buy and hold in the beginning and I did that for like
429.92s:  three months, a little less than that.
431.68s:  And then I started trading.
433.48s:  I found options because I wanted to try to accelerate the timeframe because I was super impatient.
439.20s:  And to be honest, I'm glad, I'm really glad I did because I don't know a lot of high school
444.92s:  kids that are getting super deep into options.
448.84s:  But yeah, that's essentially where it started for me.
452.68s:  And the main thing I would say at least over that path is that it's been a very generative
458.84s:  process.
459.84s:  But in the beginning, it's just so easy to make so many mistakes.
464.12s:  And it's because there's no guardrails whatsoever.
467.88s:  It's like anything else you do, there's safety mechanisms in place to prevent you from
472.04s:  making really bad decisions that just not that just does not exist in the markets.
478.80s:  For any of it says, imagine if they taught stock and option trading in high school, got
482.56s:  to keep the poor poor.
483.56s:  I don't think it's got to keep the poor poor.
485.04s:  I don't necessarily go that route.
487.12s:  But I do think that the vast majority of people trading is not for them.
491.60s:  Like and again, that statistically bears out.
494.72s:  So I think teaching like a financial health class would be so smart.
499.60s:  I think that's drastically missing super basic stuff.
502.92s:  Like talking about good debt versus bad debt, what a mortgage is.
506.56s:  Like that kind of stuff in a class would be absolutely massive.
509.60s:  And maybe they are doing that some places.
511.48s:  They definitely did not do that where I went to high schools, kind of a rough place.
515.28s:  I actually got stabbed in my hand in high school.
518.92s:  So it wasn't like a super, yeah, I wouldn't call it a super enlightened place.
526.32s:  Beyond that though, I think trading is one of those things that it's a very specific
530.56s:  vocation that some people will connect really well with it.
534.36s:  And then other people will not have a good time with it.
538.56s:  And I think it's because trading coalesces two very different things.
543.40s:  It requires the practical application and understanding of markets.
548.12s:  So something that can be learned.
550.00s:  And then it requires just nothing short of self mastery of like a human being.
557.04s:  And that's really difficult to arrive at because everybody is very uniform or a non uniform.
562.68s:  Sorry.
563.68s:  And very individual, which is beautiful.
566.52s:  But when it comes to something like trading, you can't, you really can't build something
572.04s:  that applies to everybody, which is exactly what we're going to learn today as we go through
575.40s:  the portfolio.
576.40s:  And notice that even down to like risk tolerances and down to preferences for products, all of
582.88s:  that is so, so individual to the person that it would be very difficult.
589.60s:  So yeah.
593.40s:  Bernie gets says agree, but trading would be more for people if they know, if they knew
597.64s:  how to and didn't consistently lose money buying a lot of tickets on options.
601.88s:  Yeah.
602.88s:  And the fact of the matter is is like for most people that are first starting out, they
607.84s:  can do themselves a giant favor by not trying to trade options right out of the gate and
612.88s:  paper trading them.
614.28s:  That's always the most boring, ugly answer that nobody ever likes hearing me say, but it
619.60s:  is my honest opinion.
621.12s:  I don't think that there's a better starting place than paper trading with options because
626.84s:  here's the deal.
628.56s:  They're not going to learn options even remotely well enough within a year to trade them successfully.
635.32s:  It's just not going to happen.
637.00s:  It's not going to happen.
639.12s:  There could be really lucky streaks, but then the probability of you maintaining those
644.08s:  streaks is essentially no.
646.64s:  So I'm not saying don't trade for an entire year.
649.48s:  You can, but the problem is is most people that start trading within that year, they're
654.12s:  going to be miss sizing things.
655.40s:  They're not going to see the risk that they have out.
657.96s:  They're just going to make a ton of really dumb mistakes that can be countered otherwise.
664.68s:  And pretty much all of the arguments I hear against paper trading are freaking terrible.
668.92s:  It's so stupid when I hear people say stuff like Brennan gate says, I agree.
674.36s:  And also this is bacon for Thor.
675.72s:  I will, I will definitely, he doesn't do bacon, but we do like beef liver and salmon,
681.44s:  like freeze dried salmon.
682.92s:  So I'll hook them up with a piece tonight because you hooked them up.
686.76s:  So I'll let them know that it came from our boy Brennan gate.
690.44s:  Thank you very much.
692.44s:  But I think the process of paper trading is just second to none.
698.52s:  And I think having a thought behind the way that you do what you do before you start doing
705.12s:  it is important.
706.48s:  And essentially none of us do that when we first start trading options.
710.44s:  So I mean, that's just how she goes.
713.24s:  What I'm going to do right now is link into the chat of video about portfolio.
719.24s:  Oh, this is coming out.
720.80s:  That sucks.
722.80s:  Maybe I'll make this one come out this weekend.
724.84s:  Yeah, let me reconfigure this.
727.04s:  So I actually have a video portfolio management for option straighters.
731.04s:  So I will schedule that to come out tomorrow so that it can kind of compliment this because
737.24s:  tomorrow we're going to be how I trade options.
740.36s:  So this one will get scheduled for the following week.
742.92s:  There we go.
743.92s:  Just read that schedule.
745.00s:  So this video you won't be able to click into it yet, but you will you'll be able to
752.40s:  grab it tomorrow.
753.40s:  So that video, it's like 17 minutes long and it's just about portfolio management, kind
757.44s:  of like a bunch of guiding concepts and things like that.
761.84s:  So I think that will compliment a lot what we talk about today.
766.24s:  So let's get into it portfolio management.
769.24s:  That video that I linked is really going to give you more of the basis.
773.72s:  Today I want to focus more so on the practical application and I want to build off of this.
780.32s:  Where is it?
781.32s:  This which we went over not too long ago.
784.72s:  So this is a new slide because this is what's in the video.
787.72s:  I keep forgetting.
788.72s:  I've got to put it over here.
790.56s:  I always remember after I put it over there is again, I have migrated to the left side
795.92s:  versus the right side.
798.28s:  So this kind of goes through a lot of that stuff pretty far in detail realistically speaking
803.76s:  on what I try to accomplish.
806.96s:  And you can see that there's kind of three big pieces, disposition, portfolio position.
812.04s:  And that's what we're going to work through today.
813.76s:  The whole idea behind portfolio management in my opinion is to deploy your capital to
823.20s:  meet your objectives.
825.20s:  That's the high level purpose of portfolio management.
830.40s:  And this doesn't apply to options.
831.80s:  This applies to portfolio management writ large.
835.36s:  So to that end, you'll notice that the first thing on this list is reverse plan.
841.36s:  This is the process of starting beginning with the end in mind, which is from Stephen
848.24s:  Covey's seven habits of highly successful people, efficient people.
855.80s:  I forgot highly effective people.
857.60s:  That's it.
859.76s:  And so the very first thing we need to figure out is what are we trying to do with this portfolio?
864.72s:  Then what I like to do is figure out what I'm trying to do in the long run and then break
868.56s:  it down into sub targets.
870.20s:  So for example, if I'm 20 and I'm trying to grow a portfolio to be worth $5 million
877.88s:  by the time I'm 50, that's the long run plan.
881.56s:  So then how do I get from whatever my capital is at 20 to 5 million at 50?
889.64s:  That now becomes the delta I have to cross.
893.04s:  And I need to break that up into subsequent milestones so that I can make sure that I'm
897.88s:  doing the correct things because a lot of what you'll find in this conversation today
903.80s:  is really going to come down to the ability to consistently do something even though you
909.76s:  might not see the results up front.
912.68s:  So again, you all have seen this by now.
915.68s:  This is on my website so you can all go tinker with it until your heart's content.
919.08s:  That's the whole point.
920.08s:  It's why I built it is because I literally use this all the time from anybody from the
924.28s:  OG video days.
926.00s:  You guys know I used to use this too.
927.40s:  I didn't just like start using this because it's on my website.
930.28s:  I literally used to use it from the dot gov website, but I just made one that's slightly
934.48s:  better in my opinion for the way that I like to use it.
937.00s:  So it's literally why it's here and accessible to everybody.
940.64s:  So let's say you're in your early 20s.
944.52s:  You were able to save up maybe 10 grand.
947.88s:  You had grandma who might have been giving you a bunch of money.
951.04s:  Maybe you started doing what I did, which was working a bunch of different jobs.
955.44s:  One of them was actually selling Christmas trees.
961.92s:  That was so lucrative as like a young dude.
965.20s:  I made so much in tips selling Christmas trees.
970.48s:  It was insane.
972.80s:  And I mean, like I worked at a bowling alley.
974.64s:  I used to split wood for a dude.
977.28s:  I used to help move shale.
979.40s:  All I'm highlighting is that as a young man starting essential when I was 14, I started
984.60s:  working and I started trying to find different things I could do in order to make more money
991.68s:  so that I could save.
992.84s:  I'm going to turn down the game just a little bit because it looks like I'm redlining.
997.76s:  I don't know when.
998.76s:  But I'm going to take this down to like two and a half.
1001.28s:  Let me know if that's a little bit better because I'm trying not to blow your ears out.
1005.16s:  So back over to this, maybe you maybe you have 10 grand and you're 20.
1010.48s:  So before you're 50, you have a pretty long runway.
1014.80s:  You're looking at something like 30 years or so.
1017.68s:  Let's say that you're going to kind of be on the higher end of the standard stock market
1022.52s:  return, which from right now is actually higher than this 12% period.
1027.56s:  Like if you're using like the last 20 years, it's a little bit higher now.
1031.60s:  So you maybe call it like 14% ish, something like that.
1035.76s:  So in this example, if you start with 10 grand, save you essentially just dollar cost
1040.96s:  average into the S&P 500 index, not even dollar cost average, just lump sum it right in
1046.56s:  the beginning.
1047.56s:  You have half a million dollars.
1048.56s:  You have some work to do.
1049.56s:  You're not there.
1050.56s:  Now, the very first thing I want you to see is take a look at this.
1053.16s:  I built this for a reason so that you have to look at it whether you want to or not.
1057.92s:  And this is saying if you saved literally, literally $100 per month, $100 per month over
1065.20s:  this entire time frame, rather than 509, you have 937.
1070.24s:  You essentially double your money over this long run by doing this $100 per month.
1078.32s:  So the whole point behind this is that the long run, long run performance is completely
1086.62s:  built on short term performance executed consistently for the long run.
1094.36s:  This is something a lot of people miss out on.
1097.00s:  So again, if you literally just save $100, you essentially double your money in the same
1103.52s:  time frame, you cannot ignore this kind of stuff.
1107.80s:  So for me, when I'm thinking about portfolio management, this is the start.
1111.76s:  This is the reverse planning.
1113.20s:  This is the begin with the end in mind component.
1115.92s:  I decide how much I want to make over what time frame and then I start figuring out how
1122.88s:  do I get there?
1124.76s:  A great baseline is just dollar cost averaging or just buying into an index ETF like Spy.
1134.64s:  It's a great baseline because that tells you essentially what you could do if you just
1138.84s:  did nothing.
1139.84s:  If you just kept buying the S&P 500, this is what it would look like.
1143.40s:  Okay, well, we said that we want $5 million though.
1146.72s:  So now we have a couple more levers that we have to figure out.
1149.88s:  One of them is maybe instead of saving $100 per month, maybe we save $500 per month.
1156.40s:  Now you're at $265.
1159.00s:  Halfway, not quite, but much closer.
1162.64s:  And again, if you save instead of $500, $600, now you're at $3 million.
1168.68s:  Okay, so now we're on to something.
1171.32s:  Now again, in the beginning of your young career in your early 20s, what's the probability
1176.68s:  of you being able to save $500 per month?
1178.84s:  I don't think it's that crazy, although I am a little bit out of touch with what opportunities
1184.40s:  are out there.
1185.40s:  But again, even when I was in the Marine Corps, I would make sure that I'm still doing
1189.28s:  other things.
1190.96s:  The point being is even if this is a little high for when you're really young, this is over
1196.64s:  this entire timeframe.
1198.68s:  So the expectation here is sure, when you're 20, do you have an extra $500 per month?
1205.12s:  Probably not.
1206.12s:  That might be close to what you're making for the month.
1209.16s:  By the time you're 30, you should be able to save $500 at least a month, if not more
1215.60s:  than that.
1216.60s:  Otherwise, you're missing one of the most important wealth development levers of which
1220.52s:  there are three.
1222.92s:  And I have a video that I'm working on that talks about the more in detail, but the cliff
1226.24s:  notes version is the very first one is savings.
1229.12s:  You need a good savings rate, but you can't save your way to wealth.
1232.32s:  You need your money to work for you.
1233.52s:  You need to invest.
1234.76s:  So the first one is savings.
1236.28s:  The second is investing.
1238.00s:  Being a return on your money.
1239.28s:  The third one is growing your income.
1243.00s:  Make more money.
1246.52s:  Make more money.
1248.04s:  No substitute for that in the beginning.
1250.04s:  So anyways, you can play with this and you can see, alright, what gets me to my goal?
1255.08s:  If I do $750 a month, it gets me to $3,700.
1260.08s:  So I'm just going to keep tinkering with this until I get close to my number.
1264.08s:  Okay.
1265.72s:  Now I know my number.
1268.88s:  If I save $1100 per month on average earning the standard, relatively actually guided down
1275.72s:  stock market return for those 30 years, starting with 10 grand.
1279.48s:  I now have my $5 million.
1281.64s:  Now again, this doesn't account for inflation and stuff like that, which you probably
1285.20s:  do want to think about.
1286.64s:  But now we have a planning factor.
1288.40s:  We have a starting point because now on a monthly basis, there's a vision.
1295.52s:  And the vision is I need to save as much as I possibly can to get myself as close to
1303.32s:  this number as I possibly can so that I can get to this number in the time frame that
1309.48s:  I want.
1311.00s:  That's what this means.
1312.72s:  Now if you're like me, I don't want to wait till I'm 50.
1317.40s:  50 is fine.
1318.40s:  50 now, especially with medicine and stuff like that's still pretty young and super mobile,
1324.72s:  like it's a healthy place to be.
1327.32s:  But I wanted it way earlier than that.
1329.56s:  Go back to one, me being generally impatient.
1333.24s:  Second, being that I've told you guys this already, I was actually just talking to my
1336.68s:  mom before this, but my mom was going to rely on me.
1342.68s:  She never put that pressure on me directly.
1344.68s:  She never said, you know, Son, you got to do this for me.
1347.20s:  Nothing ever like that.
1349.00s:  But I also know that she doesn't have a retirement.
1351.32s:  I'm never retirement.
1352.76s:  So I needed to be in a position by the time I was in my early 30s, really to support her.
1357.40s:  So I personally set a goal of 1 million by the time I was 30.
1361.08s:  And that was to really, really start this process.
1364.16s:  So you can see at year 10 at this rate here, that's only $300,000.
1371.76s:  So I had a lot more work to do.
1373.68s:  So where does that work come from?
1375.36s:  Well, now instead of just doing what the market does, I start looking at how can I do better
1381.68s:  than the market?
1383.20s:  So for example, maybe I add a 5% variance on this entire profile.
1391.48s:  And if we take a look at doing plus 5% over the market in this time frame, that takes
1400.44s:  me to $383,000.
1403.24s:  So closer, still not there.
1405.24s:  Still have to do even better than this.
1408.04s:  So then what?
1409.04s:  Well, that takes me to 19%.
1411.20s:  So I'd have to start going higher and higher.
1413.44s:  So for me, I relied heavily on living like a monk into my mid to late 20s in order to
1422.52s:  hit the threshold.
1423.92s:  In that same time frame, I was able to drive my returns up pretty massively, but I was
1427.76s:  targeting 15%.
1430.04s:  Because again, my goal was kind of like early 30s, call it by like 35.
1434.20s:  So if you're 20, that gives you like 15 years, essentially.
1437.76s:  And in that time frame, I would be, if you look at this right at a million dollars at
1441.48s:  a 19% return rate at this configuration.
1445.44s:  So what I'm highlighting for all of this is create a plan.
1451.20s:  I gave you some ideas on how I thought about my plan.
1454.36s:  I gave you ideas about the context behind at least the starting point, but you got to
1458.00s:  start here.
1459.00s:  If you don't know what you're aiming for, how on earth are you going to hit it?
1464.28s:  It just makes no sense.
1466.04s:  So that's the begin with the end in mind.
1469.44s:  That's reverse planning.
1470.80s:  So now we kind of have some ideas.
1473.48s:  I'm mine says dividend stocks are great for additional income.
1476.20s:  They can be the problem is is that dividend stocks are almost always going to underperform
1481.28s:  things that grow in terms of capital gains.
1483.92s:  So if you're trading and your goal is, you know, you're at a point in your career where
1487.76s:  you're really focusing on income, nothing wrong with it at all.
1491.08s:  However, if you're trying to grow your money, dividends are not a great place to park
1495.16s:  your money.
1496.16s:  You'll make way more money on things that have aggressive capital growth for sure.
1503.32s:  So I don't have any issues with dividends, but I think traders is a lot of new traders
1508.96s:  mistakenly pursue them because it's kind of like sure money, right?
1512.84s:  You know, you're going to get your dividend, but there's an opportunity cost to that capital.
1518.28s:  In most places, they're paying less than a 6% dividend, right?
1521.68s:  Let's say and I just showed you that the average market return for the past 20 years is probably
1526.04s:  closer to like 15 to 16%.
1529.12s:  So for me, I mean, screw the screw the 6% like even if it's that high, most companies
1535.88s:  that were being realistic, it's like two to four.
1537.76s:  It's like not even close.
1539.64s:  So I would much rather take the capital gains risk of holding at least in index ETF because
1547.24s:  otherwise it's going to grow way too slow.
1549.56s:  All right.
1550.16s:  So let's start with Kenneth's question.
1554.28s:  If I can get it to look normal, there we go.
1557.08s:  So and I'll bring it up to the top.
1558.72s:  So Kenneth's question says, it seems to me that a lot of new investors start out picking
1563.76s:  the usual suspects and going trial error or start with a specific stock.
1567.20s:  They have a relationship with, in my case, been holding GME since 21 and started looking
1571.88s:  at options in these shares as well.
1573.84s:  I feel that there's a great foundation to do so because I have such a deep understanding
1576.52s:  of GME during three and a half years.
1580.20s:  So I want to start there because I actually think it's a big mistake.
1584.40s:  I think it's a giant mistake.
1586.32s:  The reason I think it's a giant mistake is because even though you can do well trading
1591.00s:  an individual stock over a time frame, it's such a myopic approach.
1595.96s:  And again, I would wager that if I dollar cost averaged into not even a leveraged fund,
1602.28s:  just QQQ over that time frame, it probably would outperform anything that was made
1606.84s:  in GME during those three and a half years, even with the squeezes.
1610.56s:  So yeah, to me, I think it's a bit of a mistake to become to myopic.
1616.32s:  That's not the route that I would go at all.
1618.60s:  I would be very thoughtful about what I was putting my money into, which we'll talk
1624.96s:  about.
1625.96s:  But I think in the beginning, it's just such a better approach to just build a more holistic
1632.20s:  understanding of markets if you're going to be a trader.
1634.28s:  Now, to Kenneth's point, if you're not going to be a trader, if you're going to be an
1638.12s:  investor and you just want to buy the stocks that you like because you like those companies,
1642.72s:  that's cool.
1643.72s:  Totally cool.
1644.72s:  No problem at all.
1645.72s:  No problem at all.
1646.72s:  If you're going to be a trader, it's a big problem.
1649.24s:  Why on earth would I limit myself to one or two things?
1653.32s:  It doesn't make sense.
1654.84s:  The whole point of trading is agility.
1658.52s:  Like you can, there's synonyms.
1660.72s:  The whole point of trading is to be active so that you can pivot to things that are working,
1667.24s:  that are not working, that have strength, that have weakness.
1670.96s:  Now, some traders decide that they're going to be long only or whatever it is.
1677.56s:  However, even if you want to be long only, you can still find a lot of different things
1683.88s:  that might make sense for you.
1686.44s:  So yeah, to me, I think if you're investing in something because you really like a company
1692.52s:  and that's part of your game plan is to invest, invest, that's okay.
1697.20s:  But in trading, I think it's a big mistake.
1700.84s:  Paul says this post emphasizes emotional bonds too much.
1704.48s:  I didn't get through the rest or do you mean this?
1706.48s:  Because I do agree with you.
1707.92s:  The relationship component is slightly emotional in my opinion.
1712.24s:  And I agree with you like the Tesla cars owners liking Tesla.
1715.48s:  But again, like if they're investing, I don't care because this is like one of the most
1720.24s:  common ways to start investing by what you know is super common advice.
1725.96s:  So from an investing perspective, I don't mind.
1729.12s:  Go Bulls says that's what I've been doing mostly to I'm here to learn more.
1731.88s:  Yeah.
1732.88s:  And again, I never would want to, I always want to be very clear.
1735.72s:  There's a lot of different ways to do this.
1737.56s:  So if you're doing something else and it's working, go for it, right?
1741.28s:  I'm just kind of talking about the way that I think about things and the way that I've
1746.92s:  synthesized it over the years.
1749.48s:  But yeah, I think in trading your asset, your biggest benefit as a trader is your ability
1757.20s:  to move your agility.
1759.84s:  And the idea of doing things like trading things in different directions, it's huge because
1768.28s:  again, even institutions, they have burdens that they have to go through.
1773.40s:  They have different filings that they have to make.
1775.88s:  They have a lot of reporting requirements that slow down their ability to move around.
1781.24s:  One of the only real benefits of being a retail trader is your ability to flip and move
1787.16s:  as fast as you want.
1788.48s:  You are as agile as you can be as a market participant.
1791.32s:  That's not all that glitters as gold.
1793.36s:  There's more, there's way more drawbacks to being a retail trader than positives.
1798.24s:  But there is a positive and that's probably the biggest one that exists.
1802.88s:  So I think it's really important to lean into that positive.
1806.52s:  So yeah.
1807.52s:  Brennan Gates says, would you still call it myopic to invest in GME knowing their current
1812.84s:  board and position?
1814.52s:  No, again, like if it's a long-term investment, I would say build whatever you want.
1819.68s:  But if, for example, if the question is more so like trading GME, that's different.
1825.80s:  I actually went over that in the video I did two days ago, right?
1830.20s:  Because I'm holding long shares in GME because I want to support the movement.
1833.48s:  I do think it looks good longer term.
1836.16s:  But I'm not trading options in it right now.
1838.16s:  This is not doing anything.
1839.84s:  So from a trading perspective, I would not just sit there and stare only at GME because
1845.76s:  it's not doing anything.
1846.76s:  I need to divert my attention to things that I can make money from.
1853.96s:  So from a trading perspective, if the idea is only looking at GME, it can work if it's
1862.12s:  moving for sure, right?
1864.40s:  There's nothing wrong with really dialing in your focus when it starts moving.
1868.64s:  But I mean, if we take a look at GME and we look at what it's done essentially from
1874.36s:  here, from the sixth, it's gone from 21 to 224.
1879.44s:  I mean, it's not moving.
1882.28s:  And companies do that.
1883.60s:  They will consolidate.
1884.60s:  That's what's happening here.
1885.60s:  This thing is consolidating.
1886.60s:  It's still trending up.
1887.60s:  It doesn't look bad here, but it's just not moving much.
1890.24s:  So for me, I'm way more interested in trading things that are showing movement that I can
1894.72s:  trade.
1895.72s:  Crouch strike.
1896.88s:  Great example of this.
1898.48s:  So it hit this term low, started accelerating up and out.
1903.68s:  As soon as it starts breaking above these levels, it looks somewhat interesting to the
1907.76s:  upside, especially with how bought it was here.
1910.40s:  And then it's just been slowly grinding up and out.
1912.56s:  So in another example, from the fifth of August, this is gone from a low of 200 to 261.
1921.88s:  That's not an insignificant move.
1923.44s:  That's a very tradable move.
1926.88s:  Not huge, right?
1927.88s:  I'm not like purposely cherry picking like these home run giant plays.
1932.28s:  Like I'm showing you something that's super realistic that has recently happened.
1936.36s:  That was a great trade.
1938.48s:  So I think for stuff like this, it's showing movement.
1944.16s:  It deserves some more attention.
1946.36s:  So when I look at something like GameStop, it's a little bit different because it's just
1950.20s:  not moving that much.
1952.16s:  So that's that one.
1953.40s:  Now for Ian, as I already mentioned, we're actually going to take a look at Ian's configuration
1961.00s:  a little bit in the video, but let's pull this up so that it's easier to see.
1968.46s:  And Ian is asking a few example portfolio structures would be helpful.
1971.70s:  It's okay if the goals aren't the same as theirs.
1975.02s:  The examples don't need to be optimized.
1976.54s:  It's just an example to see if you want to achieve X.
1979.54s:  Here's a way we can essentially set up a portfolio, which we can absolutely look.
1983.06s:  That's exactly what we're going to take a look at.
1984.42s:  So it's a great question.
1986.34s:  And then we have our hometown favorite, our boy, Shrey J.
1992.02s:  And he's asking about the idea of adding uncorrelated products into the mix.
1997.38s:  Do we have to venture outside of stock spawns as majority of them moving tandem with one
2001.70s:  another?
2002.70s:  This is a great question because it really, it hits a bunch of different things all at
2007.94s:  once.
2009.02s:  So the first one is in this example, I would demand to understand what's the point of
2015.18s:  the uncorrelated products.
2016.74s:  That's the starting point.
2024.90s:  Once I know why we're trying to add uncorrelated products and then for what time frame, then I
2033.90s:  can figure out what kind of stuff makes sense.
2036.14s:  So like for example, if you're trading volatility, volatility, the whole point of volatility
2042.30s:  is that it's a non correlated return.
2045.22s:  It doesn't care about price.
2047.14s:  That's the whole point of volatility is that it is price agnostic.
2051.50s:  You are trying to trade, and this is if you're actually trading volatility, right?
2055.34s:  Where we're talking about gamma hedging, then delta hedging, like actually isolating
2060.42s:  vol.
2062.22s:  It's not correlated to beta.
2065.06s:  It doesn't care about beta.
2066.86s:  Now if the market trends, that's essentially it telling you that the vol hypothesis was
2073.90s:  wrong.
2075.34s:  But that's one very simple non correlated return that you can add to a portfolio essentially
2080.82s:  at all times.
2082.30s:  Now the rest of it really depends on what's in the portfolio, but you can find non correlated
2087.94s:  products.
2088.94s:  They almost always exist.
2090.66s:  So the other trick to this though is that you have to analyze the correlation of things
2098.22s:  over the reference time frame.
2100.54s:  So the reason why that matters a lot is because correlations of things change.
2105.82s:  So for example, for the longest time, stocks and bonds typically inverse what happened
2111.82s:  during COVID and then post COVID, they both moved together.
2115.42s:  That messed up a lot of people because they built entire systems that was entirely predicated
2121.42s:  on these long term relationships that generally had been respected, but it's not perpetual.
2126.90s:  It's not always.
2128.42s:  So the way I would look at it is as I'm going through the rest of the portfolio, if I run
2135.02s:  into a point where it's like, I really want to add more risk to the portfolio, but I don't
2141.18s:  want to add directional risk one way or the other, then I would start to look at non correlated
2147.18s:  returns and see if I can find them.
2149.86s:  But that would really be done by beta waiting the entire portfolio and then finding things
2155.34s:  that essentially have no relationship with the S&P 500 and there are stocks you literally
2161.90s:  can scan for it directly.
2164.18s:  So but the thing is that there's still systematic risk here.
2168.70s:  So for example, if you find a stock that's not correlated with the S&P 500, that doesn't
2173.02s:  mean that if the stock drops, that your stock's not going to drop, it still probably will drop
2178.06s:  because it's still systematically attached.
2180.98s:  But if short of some sort of big forcing circumstance like a global pandemic or something
2187.22s:  else, then it means that it's going to kind of run around and do whatever it wants and
2191.66s:  not necessarily move in line with the market on the day to day.
2195.18s:  Now if you're looking for things that are non correlated to the S&P 500 over longer
2199.16s:  term timeframes, that's actually when I would look at things like commodity futures because
2207.34s:  you can find other things that are essentially completely different markets.
2210.46s:  You have to trade different markets at that point.
2213.26s:  If you're looking for like true non correlated returns, even during severe market movements
2219.38s:  up or down, you can find them.
2221.86s:  But it essentially requires moving into different markets.
2224.78s:  Currencies is another market.
2226.54s:  So your instinct here of venturing outside of stocks and bonds is spot on.
2230.38s:  Again, if you're going to that extreme, which I would imagine most people probably don't
2235.42s:  have to.
2237.14s:  So another great question.
2239.54s:  All right.
2242.46s:  So we talked a little bit about kind of breaking this long run, playing down into smaller
2248.54s:  timeframes.
2249.54s:  And then I talked really briefly about what this looks like.
2253.26s:  So the video tomorrow is going to go way further into detail on this.
2257.98s:  So I'm not going to labor the point too far now.
2260.50s:  But essentially all this is emphasizing for you is a top down approach.
2265.14s:  This is talking about starting with how you feel about the market to figure out what
2269.26s:  your portfolio should look like.
2271.34s:  Then making your portfolio look like that by building each position in it so that they
2276.22s:  come together as a portfolio that makes sense for however you feel about the market.
2280.66s:  So a super quick example here that might be helpful is let's say that right now we
2286.54s:  look at the market.
2287.54s:  Let's take a look.
2290.34s:  And let's say you're bullish.
2294.42s:  You think that the market is on the route to recovery.
2297.30s:  You want long deltas, stuff like that.
2300.90s:  Okay.
2301.90s:  We can figure out how to do that.
2303.18s:  So right now the disposition is generally long deltas.
2307.46s:  I think again, the qualitative side of my brain is that we're in a really emotional
2311.70s:  market, which I've talked about before, meaning very news driven event driven, which means
2316.18s:  that things can move a lot, which is going to inform my allocations to things, but overall
2320.94s:  on bullish.
2322.10s:  So it tells me that the overall tilt I want in my portfolio is slightly long.
2328.22s:  That's the starting point here.
2329.94s:  So let me grab my notepad.
2336.46s:  And let's get some more of everybody's favorite, which is Eric's handwriting.
2341.58s:  I'm pretty sure that this is like a crowd favorite, is it not?
2347.26s:  So I'm going to add like a little scratch pad thing so that delete it when we don't need
2353.58s:  it.
2354.58s:  All right.
2355.58s:  We'll grab our little free hand tool.
2358.46s:  All right.
2359.78s:  Here we go.
2360.78s:  So for the portfolio, we know we want long deltas.
2371.14s:  For the next part, that's actually pretty good handwriting.
2374.02s:  Come on.
2375.54s:  Give it to me real.
2376.70s:  That's pretty good handwriting.
2377.70s:  Is it not?
2378.70s:  Also, I should stand up.
2381.98s:  I've been taking a bunch of a set of medicine and ibuprofen.
2386.38s:  So my whole back, really, it's more so the leg doesn't hurt quite as bad, but then
2391.10s:  it can kind of sneak up on you.
2392.70s:  So you got to keep it, you know, keep it smart.
2397.34s:  Jonathan says, did you type that?
2398.94s:  Reece says pristine.
2399.94s:  Yeah, exactly.
2400.94s:  I mean, I can't imagine writing more clearly than that.
2403.38s:  I think Jonathan is, he might have actually found my secret.
2407.54s:  So I did just type that.
2408.66s:  That's a really tricky font to get.
2411.46s:  It's kind of like comic sands, but it's a little bit better.
2415.06s:  Yeah.
2416.06s:  So we know we want long deltas.
2418.22s:  Next we need to know how big the portfolio, okay, so now I'm standing so that the handwriting
2421.70s:  is going to change a little bit.
2422.70s:  Let's see what we can do here.
2424.02s:  So the portfolio is going to be $100,000.
2427.22s:  And the reason why I use $100,000 is because you can divide by 10, multiply by 10 to make
2432.34s:  it whatever size you want.
2435.58s:  Of note, it's about the only thing you can make whatever size you want.
2438.54s:  Fun fact, is this example?
2442.26s:  So we know about $100,000.
2444.78s:  We know that we want to be long.
2446.50s:  We know that with the market where it's at, we have to decide how much of the account
2450.54s:  we want utilized and how much of the account we want in reserve for whatever subsequent movement
2456.30s:  we think may or may not happen.
2457.74s:  And all of this is going to be predicated on our strategies.
2461.70s:  So of this, we need to think about how we're going to split up this money.
2466.38s:  Where does this go?
2468.46s:  And this is the art of portfolio management.
2472.54s:  Is exactly this.
2474.58s:  It's figuring out where that money goes.
2478.58s:  So let's talk about it.
2481.58s:  This is just a quick recap for you all to understand how I typically think about trading and the
2487.14s:  kind of things that I look to do.
2489.38s:  So it's literally just for your reference, we're going to spend no more time on that.
2493.90s:  Now let's start with an example portfolio.
2497.38s:  Let's say that we have $100,000 account.
2501.10s:  Right here.
2504.06s:  That's kind of not there we go.
2506.90s:  $100,000 account right here.
2509.06s:  We want to make 15% per year, which means we need to make $15,000 over the year, which means
2517.06s:  we need to make about 12 fitty a month.
2520.58s:  How can we do that?
2522.22s:  Lots of ways.
2523.22s:  Literally, there are unlimited ways to crack that nut.
2527.62s:  I'm going to give you an example of one way that's pretty simple to follow, I think.
2534.42s:  So we know in the long run, stocks go up.
2537.82s:  There's positive drift.
2539.30s:  At the beginning of this, we started with this buy in hold proxy.
2544.50s:  We were saying what could we do if we bought and held the S&P 500, right?
2550.10s:  Spy.
2551.10s:  So we started with that as the backdrop.
2554.14s:  So then the way my brain works is I think, okay, well, how can I do slightly better than
2558.26s:  that?
2559.26s:  I think of two things.
2560.58s:  I think of how can I add leverage?
2563.70s:  And the second thing I think about is how can I reduce the draw downs?
2567.30s:  Because if you don't participate in it as many of the draw downs, then you have a slightly
2572.18s:  more effective approach to not be in trades as they're completely unwinding, drawing the
2578.70s:  account down.
2579.94s:  So we can take a look at something like this.
2583.30s:  So this was a really, really quick back test of looking at a super simple strategy using
2589.62s:  SSO, which is a two time leveraged S&P 500 product.
2596.22s:  And you can see that the average performance year over year for the last 10 years of this
2601.66s:  takes you just over 20%.
2604.06s:  This is using a base 50 day moving average momentum strategy.
2611.06s:  Above the 50, we're in it and buying the crosses below.
2614.14s:  We get out until it crosses back above.
2616.06s:  That's it.
2617.26s:  So as we look at this, we can see that it performs pretty well most of the time, but then
2622.06s:  it has a rough year in 22.
2623.66s:  It's a big old drawdown.
2625.26s:  It's like 40% down on the year way, way unacceptable.
2629.30s:  So then we can think about if we wanted to really perfect the strategy, how do we address
2634.10s:  that year in 22 that really sticks out to me?
2637.30s:  But what I'm doing right now is I'm just coming up with a base system that is super
2642.30s:  simple to start with.
2644.34s:  And this would become the core allocation.
2648.58s:  So I would say for the core allocation of the portfolio, I probably would run something
2653.62s:  like the coverage strangle on something like this, use a moving average momentum strategy,
2659.30s:  run the majority of the portfolio on this because in the long run, it's going to put me
2662.94s:  exactly where I need to be.
2665.02s:  Easy.
2666.02s:  So then that leaves us with a speculative allocation, 20% of the money.
2671.14s:  So now we have $20,000 to trade and attempt to amplify this.
2677.38s:  So why am I doing 80% of the money in this?
2681.70s:  Because if I do that at slightly over 20%, this alone, essentially for the entire account
2687.58s:  would meet this threshold for the portfolio.
2692.74s:  And then this is a way for me to amplify.
2695.74s:  How can I make this better?
2698.42s:  So then we start figuring out how we want to deal with that $20,000.
2705.34s:  Do we set for me, I would start by setting what's the max risk?
2711.46s:  I would take per trade understanding that I need to make sure I can get enough iterations
2717.66s:  on.
2718.66s:  So for example, if I have that 20% speculative allocation, I don't want to be too aggressive
2723.82s:  especially early on.
2725.98s:  Again, this is just obviously a random example.
2729.26s:  If this was actually my account, I would trade this quite a bit differently.
2733.22s:  But in this example, I would have no problem using most of this 20K on an individual trade
2739.06s:  for a speculative trade personally.
2741.54s:  But the risk on it would be very tight.
2743.66s:  I'm giving you another potential threshold you could use.
2746.10s:  So something like less than 5% of total account value per trade, which gives you about $5,000
2753.10s:  of risk ability per trade of this allocation in total.
2759.26s:  So that means you can use all $20,000 on an individual trade, but you can only risk 5K
2763.62s:  of it so that it fits in with the broader portfolio objectives.
2767.82s:  So now we have parameters.
2769.98s:  We started with what we want to do in the ultimate long run.
2774.98s:  What are we trying to do?
2776.86s:  What are we trying to do long term?
2778.34s:  We have that.
2779.66s:  We've now broken it down into smaller time frames so that we know what we need to make
2784.14s:  per year, what we need to do per month.
2786.90s:  All of that is done.
2788.74s:  So now we're at the point where we need to find individual positions to do things.
2794.82s:  We already did that.
2795.82s:  For 80% of this portfolio, we know where it's going to go.
2800.30s:  Something like this done.
2802.70s:  So now what we need to do is figure out what specific positions fit into this.
2809.90s:  So I've just done the vast majority of the work for you.
2814.34s:  Now you have to help me do the remaining work.
2818.62s:  How do we find these positions?
2819.86s:  You guys tell me, what are your ideas?
2822.30s:  I gave you the parameters that I think make sense for the broader example.
2827.10s:  Now we need to figure out how do we use the rest of this 20%?
2832.10s:  Where do we find the risk?
2834.10s:  So what do you guys think?
2835.42s:  What should we do to find this risk?
2837.74s:  There's again a million ways to do this.
2841.46s:  But I think it's a super important exercise now for you guys to start thinking about it.
2850.94s:  What do we think?
2853.50s:  I need to find some place to put $20,000.
2862.94s:  Where does that go?
2867.54s:  I'll sit here with you guys.
2869.30s:  I'm actually about to get my food order ready for tonight, which is going to be Mexican,
2875.42s:  I think.
2876.42s:  I don't know how you guys feel about Mexican.
2879.46s:  I'm in different to it, but I really like the carne asada burritos.
2884.94s:  But there's this really gross thing called a California burrito where they put fries
2890.26s:  and shit in it, which is super.
2892.06s:  I don't know, that just sounds so disgusting to me.
2895.02s:  Like fries in a burrito.
2897.58s:  Maybe it's one of those things that tastes really good, but it just does not sound good
2901.46s:  to me.
2902.46s:  Big A says copy Pelosi, I love that.
2906.02s:  That's not a bad idea at all.
2909.98s:  Jonathan likes California burritos.
2911.74s:  I, God, dude, I just don't know how.
2913.94s:  I mean, they're not bad.
2915.34s:  I mean, I've never had one.
2916.86s:  I just don't want fries on a burrito.
2919.90s:  I do like adding Chipotle sauce, though, which I feel like is kind of a pretty white person
2925.70s:  thing to do, but it's good.
2929.70s:  All right, let's see what you guys.
2936.34s:  Big A says see which S&P or QQQ are near 52 week lows.
2940.02s:  All right, let's do it.
2941.54s:  Literally, we now go into practical application.
2944.66s:  So what I'm going to do is go into on demand.
2947.18s:  We are now back in time together.
2949.54s:  And I'm going to go back to a random point in time.
2953.50s:  Let's do 2016.
2955.82s:  I don't know much of what happened in 2016 off the top of my hand.
2959.14s:  I don't even know what kind of year that was.
2961.98s:  So we will start in 2016.
2972.30s:  So you guys, you guys drive me.
2974.30s:  You guys tell me what we're doing here.
2975.54s:  We have $20,000.
2977.26s:  We need to get to work.
2978.66s:  I'm going to start with getting our core allocation set up in the meantime.
2984.58s:  So let's take a look at SSO.
2986.14s:  Let's see if it's above a 50 day.
2988.22s:  Which one of these stupid lines is a 50 day?
2991.14s:  It's not above a 50 day.
2992.26s:  So I have nothing to do right now.
2993.62s:  I am unemployed.
2995.22s:  My trade, our 80% is off the table right now.
2998.82s:  Technically, I would rotate it into something like HYG, like some sort of yielding product.
3004.14s:  So we can simulate that as well.
3006.86s:  Let's see where HYG is at.
3008.98s:  Yeah, I would love that here.
3011.30s:  So in this case, I would just come in here.
3014.94s:  Apparently, there's no bit ask.
3018.38s:  I don't know why that is slightly confusing, but we need to use $80,000.
3026.14s:  So essentially, 1,000 shares.
3027.54s:  Can we get a fill?
3029.34s:  I don't know if let's fast forward this.
3034.18s:  We'll do like nine, nine 45 is fine.
3042.10s:  And let's see.
3044.10s:  Answer replace.
3046.38s:  Rease says excess funds and box spreads.
3048.42s:  It's a great, it's a great point.
3050.70s:  What's the problem?
3052.34s:  What was the interest rate in 2016?
3056.78s:  Let's see.
3060.78s:  Interest rate in 2016.
3065.42s:  Yeah.
3069.22s:  So you, Rease, are probably a little too spoiled here.
3074.34s:  Jonathan says 4.5.
3075.98s:  That's not what I see.
3078.86s:  That's not what I see at all.
3080.82s:  I don't know unless chat GPT is wrong, but chat GPT is saying that the federal funds rate
3085.38s:  in 2016 from the beginning was 0.25% to 0.5%.
3091.34s:  And this was after December 15, which was the first time that they raised rates in nearly
3096.42s:  a decade from about zero.
3099.14s:  So yeah, that doesn't exist.
3102.66s:  One of the main reasons why when I first was making YouTube content in 2020, I wasn't
3108.54s:  doing a bunch of stuff about box spreads, which is a big part of what I do, but it needs
3114.26s:  yields.
3116.02s:  So yeah, in this case, yield was 0.25 to 0.5%.
3121.02s:  There was no yield.
3122.62s:  So I mean, for me, that's not where I'm going.
3126.18s:  Whereas if you look at something like HYG, this is what is it?
3133.18s:  A 42 cents, so 0.42, it doesn't give me the yield here, so I have to figure it out.
3138.50s:  0.42 divided by what 80 point at the 8.
3144.18s:  So it's like 0.5%.
3146.66s:  So it's still, I mean, just the yields were non-existent here.
3150.46s:  The yields were absolutely abysmal.
3154.62s:  So yeah, but in any case, just simulating this through, let's put on a position in HYG
3162.62s:  so that we can have some sort of risk on.
3165.46s:  If I can get this to fill, maybe I can just do like a market order.
3172.26s:  Or not, because there's no bid ask.
3174.62s:  Was the market closed?
3176.54s:  Is that what's happening right now?
3178.82s:  January 1st.
3179.82s:  I'm so dumb.
3180.82s:  That's New Year's.
3181.82s:  So stupid.
3186.82s:  So stupid.
3187.82s:  Fun fact, the market's closed on New Year's.
3190.98s:  And when the market is closed on New Year's or any other day, you can't get a fill on
3197.42s:  your trade.
3198.42s:  In case you were wondering.
3202.22s:  So now let's try to get a fill.
3204.90s:  Let's just go for a market order.
3206.94s:  Ah, we're filled.
3211.14s:  So we have our yield trade on.
3218.10s:  And then let's zoom this over.
3221.38s:  There we go.
3227.50s:  It doesn't let me see beta-weighted delta's because it's super annoying.
3231.38s:  So I'm not sure what the beta-weighted delta's are here, but this is very correlated with
3236.02s:  the S&P 500 typically.
3238.30s:  So now let's take another quick look at SSO.
3240.54s:  See if it's time to put that.
3241.62s:  What the?
3242.94s:  I don't think that's right.
3244.82s:  I hate these leveraged funds back in time.
3247.54s:  They're really, really painful to use.
3249.78s:  So I'm just going to pretend the SSO HYG thing is going to happen in the background just
3254.54s:  because I don't want to keep dealing with this as a giant waste of time.
3257.78s:  So now we need to figure out the $20,000.
3260.42s:  Now, let's see what you guys think.
3264.90s:  HYG says see which S&P or QQQ are near 52 week lows.
3272.50s:  Okay.
3273.50s:  So let's take a look at spy.
3275.90s:  Let's just continue with this thing.
3278.74s:  So Neon wants this covered calls on spy.
3282.54s:  Okay.
3284.38s:  Let's play that out.
3289.46s:  Right now for the rest of the portfolio, we're doing SSO which is levered two times spy.
3296.94s:  Now Neon is suggesting maybe we look at covered calls in spy which we can look at.
3302.82s:  Walk me through how this would work.
3304.38s:  We have $20,000 to use in total.
3308.14s:  So if we're doing something like covered calls, it'll be pretty expensive in something
3313.02s:  like spy in my opinion.
3315.34s:  So how do we make this make sense?
3319.90s:  Because we know we need to make $12,50 a month to keep us on our target.
3325.90s:  You need $12,50 a month.
3328.22s:  And right now our fastball which is SSO is not on.
3332.62s:  We're waiting for the condition for SSO to be able to be put on.
3337.90s:  Which we also know SSO would not have been jacked up like that with spy being down here.
3342.70s:  So it's just kind of an artifact of the back test of the portfolio.
3348.42s:  So big as says a leaps diagonal in spy.
3351.26s:  So for me, I would probably x-snay that move personally.
3358.22s:  And it's again, if I'm looking at a ratio called diagonal, I needed to go up.
3363.42s:  If I'm looking at trading something like covered calls, I needed to go up.
3367.86s:  This is not going up.
3369.54s:  I'm looking at something that's largely going sideways.
3373.22s:  And it actually has a slight downtrend.
3376.22s:  So then the question is why would we put on something that is bullish and needs to go
3383.10s:  up in order to make money if it looks like that?
3389.54s:  What's the idea there?
3392.54s:  I'm seeing any other ideas that you guys had.
3400.46s:  Doctors A is to sell puts.
3401.98s:  All right, let's take a look at someone with some puts.
3404.46s:  Which again, for me, bullish.
3407.02s:  This is not bullish.
3408.18s:  Markets going down.
3411.54s:  Nian says I currently do call credit spreads to get my extra money.
3414.98s:  I also would not do that personally.
3418.10s:  But let's take a look at the puts scenario.
3419.66s:  So for the puts things first, puts again are bullish.
3424.50s:  And this is not going up.
3426.10s:  So I would be mindful of those factors combined.
3430.54s:  Now let's just take a look at the example.
3433.10s:  We need to make 1250.
3434.66s:  And again, right now our fastball is not on.
3437.62s:  Doctors A says buy puts.
3439.70s:  Okay.
3440.70s:  They're going to be more expensive now.
3442.58s:  But walk me through the trade.
3443.98s:  What trade would we put on?
3446.10s:  Doctors A is talked to me.
3448.98s:  So from this, what I really need to understand is how much money are we going to use in this
3457.66s:  trade?
3458.66s:  And then how do we build it?
3463.78s:  Tyler says neutral spreads like iron condors until a breakout.
3467.94s:  I don't hate that.
3469.86s:  So Tyler, in the meantime, if you want to start elaborating on your idea, like what
3474.82s:  kind of stuff we would look at and what kind of trades we would put on, we can take a
3477.98s:  look at those.
3479.82s:  And then doctors A is let me know what puts we're going to buy, what expiration we're going
3483.98s:  to, those kinds of things.
3486.10s:  Because what I what I'm hoping to show you with this example is an important process,
3492.50s:  which I'm not sure most people go through.
3494.74s:  So that's why I'm kind of getting into the specific details with these.
3498.22s:  So for example, for doctors A is let's say that he wanted to buy 74 DTE puts and we
3504.66s:  want to trade it similar to like what I would do in a ratio put diagonal.
3508.66s:  So I'm going to grab something that's in the money that's liquid.
3512.30s:  So let's take a look at like these 70 delta puts maybe or these the none of these are super
3518.70s:  liquid.
3519.70s:  So I'm kind of is what it is.
3521.78s:  But let's take a look at like these two tens.
3524.26s:  We buy these two tens that are 74 DTE.
3527.62s:  So that takes up $1,278.
3531.62s:  Now we need a couple important decisions.
3534.46s:  The first one is where's the target?
3536.46s:  Where do we think that the S&P 500 is going to fall to?
3540.34s:  So if I look at this and we're hanging around there, we're actually coming right up on
3545.94s:  a volume node kind of like right here is what I see.
3550.78s:  And I'm just using the volume nodes over here to get a sense of where prices.
3555.94s:  So you can see that there's a volume node.
3557.38s:  I just parked that on.
3559.02s:  So I would view that as near term support.
3562.74s:  So again, personally, I wouldn't trade a put diagonal here because to me it's just
3570.34s:  coming into support and I would need to know how I would need to see how it's going to
3575.26s:  move.
3576.26s:  But let's just play the example out.
3578.14s:  As I look at the trade, I might pick a price target.
3580.78s:  Where do I think it might go after it breaks through here?
3584.22s:  Well, the next volume node I see is like right there.
3587.98s:  And then let's say that we think we might get a bigger move for whatever reason that next
3591.82s:  volume node is right there at 193.
3594.26s:  So let's give ourselves the benefit of the doubt.
3596.58s:  And let's say our target is 193.
3599.78s:  So I'll go back into this trade and then I'll keep it out of one lot for now.
3604.42s:  And then I'm going to look at the analyze tab.
3608.46s:  And I want to see what it would be worth, which again, this is kind of, oh, maybe it'll
3614.30s:  update.
3615.30s:  Let's see.
3617.78s:  That's tricky because I wanted to see what it would be worth.
3622.90s:  If the stock was trading at 193, you can typically do that in the analysis tab again like this
3627.86s:  isn't, oh, this is the old one.
3630.02s:  That's why that's my bad.
3633.82s:  That's my bad.
3634.82s:  Let's see the analyze trade.
3636.18s:  There we go.
3638.34s:  So at 193, you'd have 427 bucks.
3641.98s:  So we need to make 1250.
3644.42s:  This would get us about a third of the way there, which is great.
3648.46s:  Or we might need to size it up.
3650.66s:  We could do a second one, but then we need to figure out where do we get stopped out?
3654.94s:  Well, the risk part of this trade, it looks like the first stop would be somewhere right
3659.38s:  around here, like the 201 handle.
3663.14s:  So then what's our PNL at 201?
3665.82s:  This is down 390 bucks.
3667.62s:  And if you remember, we said that we can risk up to $5,000 per trade.
3673.98s:  This is well within that tolerance.
3675.90s:  So so far so good.
3677.58s:  We're looking at a probability of getting stopped out at 390 and trying to get to 193, which
3683.18s:  would give us $419.
3685.70s:  Now what I would do is look at the probabilities of both of these circumstances, 193.
3691.18s:  And then the probability of hitting 20, what did I say 201?
3698.18s:  And I would calculate the expected return.
3701.02s:  So I'm going to grab a calculator right now.
3703.78s:  So the probability of us hitting this, which would give us like $410.
3709.94s:  So 410, which is done at 193.
3713.46s:  And then the loss was 390.
3717.14s:  And that happens at 201.
3720.18s:  So let's say that we're going to give this thing like 30 days to work or something like
3725.66s:  that.
3726.66s:  Again, normally I would use this tool here, which is the probability analysis tool.
3730.98s:  It's a little easier, but you don't need it.
3733.06s:  You can use the options chain all the same.
3736.14s:  So we can come out here and we can say, what's the probability of us hitting 193?
3742.18s:  Well the probability of a touch is 73.85%.
3747.22s:  So then there's a 73% probability of a touch there.
3752.30s:  And then what's the probability of a touch to 201?
3757.94s:  It's 93.81%.
3759.34s:  93.81.
3760.34s:  So this is a probability of a touch.
3761.34s:  81.
3762.78s:  So this is a negatively expectant trade.
3766.34s:  This is a no trade for me.
3768.14s:  So this is an example of I would need to either update my expectations for where it might
3774.42s:  go.
3775.42s:  So one of the ways I might do that is by saying, OK, maybe 201 is too tight.
3781.34s:  Maybe we say if it gets above this next volume node, which this one's at like 203.
3787.94s:  So let's say if it gets up to like 204.
3790.90s:  And we can take a look at new probabilities here.
3793.74s:  We can say, what is it worth at 204?
3797.02s:  Now we're losing 684.
3798.82s:  So we have to update our probability matrix, negative 684.
3805.54s:  And then we have to look at the probability over this 70 days of us hitting.
3814.26s:  What was the specific number 204 60?
3818.94s:  So the probability of hitting 204 is 7768.
3823.42s:  So this will still be a bad trade.
3827.62s:  Still negatively expectant.
3831.10s:  So this is a no trade.
3832.10s:  It doesn't fit.
3834.26s:  That's it.
3835.78s:  Good look.
3836.78s:  Good, good idea to look at.
3839.22s:  So now we can take a look at this iron condor trade.
3842.70s:  So Tyler, if you give me some details on, well, first before I go into the next example,
3848.86s:  what I just did make sense to you guys from like a practical standpoint, like what I just
3854.10s:  went through, I just realized I didn't really take a pause after that.
3860.14s:  But I want to make sure that that makes sense because it's a really important process.
3866.22s:  And we just got through our first beverage, which is the spin drift man.
3871.58s:  Every time I do this, spin drift mango, big fan, really liked those a lot.
3877.50s:  It's probably the mango orange is probably my favorite.
3880.34s:  All right, so Liz is following us, which is great.
3883.58s:  As long as she's with us, that's essentially all that matters.
3887.78s:  And then the rest of you hula gins around your own.
3889.90s:  That's really what that boils down to.
3893.14s:  So now we're moving on to our next beverage, which is a strawberry lemonade.
3897.54s:  This one's pretty good too.
3901.70s:  That was just a celt or water though.
3904.82s:  So now we have to move on to the next trade idea.
3907.10s:  Now I'll kind of go through some of the things that I would do.
3910.62s:  The first thing I would be trying to figure out.
3915.26s:  Nian says in my model of a call credit spread, 3K risk makes 1323 a month with 25% tax rate.
3924.30s:  Currently over 95% success rate, my one loss in one year is 50% capital close.
3930.78s:  Walk me through the system.
3932.26s:  We can look at it together.
3935.58s:  But the again, the issue with really high win rates is the probability of a blowout at some
3942.38s:  point is super super real.
3944.90s:  But yeah, happy, absolutely happy to take a look at it.
3948.70s:  If you let me know the general parameters, we can run an example.
3953.02s:  But in the meantime, what I would be looking for is what is the market look like it's
3957.02s:  going to do.
3958.02s:  So right now net highs lows is trending negative.
3961.30s:  I don't love that.
3963.70s:  And the spy is coming down, cues is coming down, Russell's coming down.
3968.70s:  Essentially everything here is coming down.
3973.18s:  So what that means to me is I don't actually know if I want to go really long here to the
3979.26s:  upside.
3980.46s:  I don't necessarily want to fade the indices either.
3983.38s:  So one of the things I would do personally is take a look within the sectors and find
3988.78s:  sectors that are not doing well broadly.
3992.30s:  So like this, XLU is not doing well.
3995.38s:  This is like the sick puppy, along with XLE.
3998.22s:  These are two trades that I like to the downside that look more prone to collapse.
4005.02s:  So this is kind of where I personally would start looking.
4008.14s:  And I can either fade the entire index itself or I can look what's within the index.
4013.90s:  I don't know how well the scan feature.
4015.50s:  Okay, that sucks.
4016.66s:  So I was going to scan with you guys, but you can't scan in on demand, which I mean, I
4022.30s:  guess that's fair.
4023.30s:  It's kind of difficult to code in little annoying because really what I would do here is go
4029.78s:  into the sectors and look for the underperforming stocks within those sectors.
4037.98s:  That's the first step to this idea.
4040.98s:  So I know it would be within XLE and I know it would be within XLE.
4044.62s:  But we can just use the indices themselves to start with and just kind of follow that
4048.10s:  vibe.
4049.10s:  So let's take a look at XLU.
4052.46s:  XLU.
4054.78s:  And it doesn't look like it's crashing.
4056.70s:  It looks like it's relatively range bound.
4059.02s:  So this might be something that we can sell some options in.
4062.34s:  So maybe we can do something that's like, I don't want to go as far out as 46 ideally.
4067.02s:  We can take a look at what the theta is, which is super low.
4070.14s:  So that's no good for me.
4071.66s:  Maybe 32.
4072.66s:  Yeah, so something like 32 days, it'll be a little less liquid.
4075.66s:  So it's not my preferred expiration, but I'm hunting for liquidity here.
4081.38s:  And my disposition is slightly more to the downside.
4085.50s:  So I would look at something like this, like selling the 34 delta calls.
4090.82s:  And we can do like a few of those.
4093.22s:  I'll see what the actual risk is on these.
4095.22s:  And then I still would sell some of these puts, maybe like these 42 puts, but I would
4100.34s:  do it at a ratio.
4101.74s:  So maybe like two of those.
4103.98s:  And let's see what this looks like.
4105.22s:  We got to get rid of this one.
4110.06s:  It looks like nothing because again, we're in on demand.
4113.54s:  That is one of the artifacts of this.
4116.70s:  But really what I wanted to see is what the total risk would be.
4119.98s:  I wonder if I split these up actually.
4121.82s:  Let's see if that'll work for us.
4123.82s:  So let's pretend that we just sell these first and see if we can get a risk profile.
4129.66s:  And we cannot bummer.
4133.18s:  Okay, can't get a risk profile.
4136.94s:  We can just swag it.
4138.62s:  So the way that I'm going to swag it is by using the options chain and seeing what
4142.54s:  surrogate options look like.
4144.62s:  So my stop here.
4148.90s:  Doctors they says why are we in on demand and not real time.
4152.06s:  So that we can ideally fast forward so that we can see what it would look like in the
4158.74s:  example.
4161.22s:  The other reason is to put us in an unknown time frame so that it's a little more efficacious
4170.22s:  for us to posture.
4171.22s:  It's like I really don't know what happens in the market here genuinely.
4174.74s:  I think if I'm not mistaken, I think 2016 ended up being an up year like less than 15%
4180.66s:  greater than 10.
4181.66s:  I want to say, but I don't know the path of that return.
4185.50s:  I have absolutely no idea what it looks like.
4188.06s:  So it's to try to like genuinely put us in a scenario where we're literally building
4192.70s:  a portfolio in a scenario.
4193.98s:  We don't know that ideally we can fast forward and see how it does.
4198.42s:  That's the idea.
4199.66s:  But the main point is whether it's a non-demand or not, the concepts here really remain
4203.94s:  the same.
4204.94s:  So what I'm working us through is we have the core allocation that we're going to flip
4209.26s:  on and off as it's time right now.
4210.74s:  It's time to be flipped off.
4211.86s:  That's okay.
4212.86s:  And then right now we're looking how do we use this $20,000 to find good opportunities.
4218.38s:  Now ideally, I would much like scanning would be a huge part of this.
4223.46s:  So we'll probably go off on demand so that we can scan because I at least want you to
4229.02s:  see that process.
4230.02s:  I think it's important.
4233.82s:  But we'll get through this.
4236.34s:  Nian says, after the opening hour, I sell a call credit spread $1 wide $3.
4243.34s:  What?
4244.34s:  $1 wide $3 premiums at least 10 over currents spy price for the next day close.
4264.98s:  The $1 wide $3 premiums doesn't make any sense.
4272.10s:  I sell a call credit spread at $1 wide $3 premiums at least $10 over currents spy price.
4287.02s:  The other like I $1 wide is the spread from short to long collect but you don't.
4295.54s:  You're not going to collect $3 premium on a dollar wide spread like that just is not
4299.98s:  how it works at all.
4302.46s:  So let I mean, we'll look at it in an example really quick.
4305.98s:  We'll go to spy and we'll go to $1 wide.
4310.66s:  So 20 and I'm giving you the benefit by doing the at the monies.
4316.50s:  You get 58 cents.
4321.66s:  So yeah, like you don't collect $3 premium.
4328.86s:  Do you mean like $3 premium that gives you through no because you're saying 3K is 30
4337.02s:  contracts.
4339.30s:  That doesn't look right at all to me.
4341.26s:  You're not going to collect more premiums than the width of the strikes.
4345.58s:  That's just structurally not going to happen.
4349.18s:  So then your math on 3K is 30 contracts doesn't work at all either.
4356.06s:  So I have no idea what you got going on but I think I would definitely encourage you
4362.70s:  to take a super close look at the math because what you just drop there is not right.
4366.70s:  It's not accurate at all.
4369.98s:  All right.
4371.22s:  Back to this.
4372.50s:  So when we're looking at weakness trying to find those trades, we were in what was it?
4383.58s:  XLE or XLU, both of these look bad.
4387.54s:  Yeah, XLU.
4388.58s:  So XLU, I'm more neutral in my disposition.
4392.90s:  Like bearish disposition, it's trending down.
4395.50s:  So that would lead me to want to sell a little bit more premium than buy.
4400.10s:  So using this 32 days, some shit like that, we can sell a couple more of these so we can
4406.86s:  sell five of them.
4409.46s:  Now what I'll do is because I can't see it in the risk profiles.
4412.90s:  It's not popping up is I can just create what I call a surrogate option.
4417.02s:  I can see what these would look like given different moves.
4420.54s:  So if I go to the chart and I say where would my stop be?
4423.22s:  My stop would be let's call it 44.
4426.30s:  So from 42, 93 to 44, it's about a one point move to the upside.
4432.86s:  It's actually too tight, I think, but we can see what it would look like.
4436.70s:  So what I would do is pretend that these options moved one point against me.
4443.34s:  That means that my options would look like these 43s.
4449.34s:  So my options then from a surrogate sense would go from 37 cents to about 85 cents.
4458.86s:  It's about the change that would happen if we get that $1 move.
4462.70s:  So it helps me understand what the risk is.
4465.90s:  So if I get a dollar move against me, my premium is going to change from 37 to about 85.
4474.66s:  So then my risk, whatever the unrealized loss would be the difference between those two.
4481.22s:  So I'll take a pause there because I know the surrogate stuff typically starts losing
4485.42s:  people pretty quick.
4486.90s:  And I want to make sure that that makes sense for you guys.
4489.74s:  What I'm doing is I'm just mentally simulating if XLU moves a dollar against me, what my
4495.90s:  option would look like.
4497.74s:  So if I essentially move the option a dollar, these 43s would look just like my 44s as
4504.46s:  of right now if we get that dollar move.
4507.26s:  So then that means that they would be trading again for like 85 cents or something like
4511.14s:  that.
4512.14s:  So then I would take the, I think it's 84 cents.
4514.70s:  So 84 cents less the 37 cents that I made, I'm not worried about that because that's originally
4523.74s:  the credit I get gives me 47 cents in risk, which is $47.
4530.78s:  The trade would be down 47 bucks if I get a dollar move against me again, give or take
4535.42s:  just it's a surrogate.
4537.42s:  Has that completely lost everybody?
4539.82s:  Because if so, I don't want to do that.
4541.54s:  And I'm happy to kind of just gloss over it a little bit higher.
4545.42s:  I'm trying to give you some tools on how I think about these things, but I know that
4551.14s:  it's kind of esoteric.
4552.14s:  It's a little bit weird.
4553.14s:  Okay, doctors A is with us.
4554.78s:  He's a doctor.
4555.78s:  Of course, of course the doctors with us, we, you have doctor in your name.
4560.22s:  So Willie says a bit lost.
4565.14s:  That's fair.
4567.02s:  So the way Willie to think about what I'm doing is I am moving the options by pretending
4580.06s:  this moves.
4581.26s:  So for example, right now with spot price at 43, these are right at the money, right?
4589.90s:  They're right here.
4591.42s:  If this pretend this moved a dollar and instead of this being 43, this is now 44, if this
4598.78s:  moves to 44, now our 44 options would be at the money, which is what this is.
4606.22s:  These strikes that are colored like this, it means they're right at the money.
4610.98s:  And technically it's 44 or three.
4614.06s:  Because we're starting from 43 or three.
4616.22s:  So I'm just mentally moving the price of the underlying with whatever I want to check.
4621.26s:  In this case, it's $1 from 43 or three to 44 or three to see what my options would look
4625.62s:  like.
4626.62s:  So it means that my 44s would look like these 43s.
4630.18s:  And then I'm calculating what the loss would look like on those assuming these would be
4635.66s:  about 84 cents.
4637.98s:  And then we would sell these for about 37 cents.
4641.82s:  So it gives us $47 in unrealized loss at the time.
4647.62s:  So that's the start of the position.
4649.58s:  So now we know $47 is way too little.
4652.58s:  We need to definitely take more risk than that.
4655.42s:  So then if we do like a five lot or something like that, we would take our 47 times five,
4661.82s:  gives us $235 in risk, still super, super light.
4665.22s:  So we can take even more.
4666.94s:  So now we're at $470 in risk at a 10 lot.
4670.34s:  And then, I'm going to go to $470.
4672.34s:  So then what I would do is actually go over to these 42s, sell some of these, maybe five
4678.18s:  of those.
4679.78s:  And then on the put side, where would I want to get stopped out?
4685.78s:  Probably below here.
4687.46s:  So like 42, I would call it like sub 42.
4691.22s:  So again, like $1 to the other side.
4694.34s:  So then my 42s would look like the 43s, which is like a 20 cent variance, something
4700.30s:  like that.
4701.94s:  So then be like another 100 bucks a little, a little more than that.
4707.46s:  So then the total at risk here is still under $1,000 essentially.
4711.78s:  So then if we launch this trade, we would be taking in 610 bucks.
4717.62s:  So for me, this would be the first piece that would be added to the portfolio puzzle.
4724.30s:  Now it's super unlikely that that will get filled because it's a weird order and it's
4727.46s:  paper trade, but just to give you an idea.
4730.42s:  So that's the first trade.
4732.42s:  And I would go and find more until I'm able to hit my threshold of 1250 in profit.
4739.90s:  Now the caveat here is if I plan on managing these, I need to bake that into my plan.
4746.82s:  So for example, let's say on this one trade, I took in $1,250 in credit.
4753.14s:  But if I'm planning on managing it at 60% max profit, well, it's still not 1250 on
4758.62s:  the month.
4759.82s:  I would need to do something else because even though I took in the 1250 upfront on this
4763.78s:  trade, I know I'm going to manage it based on my plan.
4766.98s:  So I need to be ready to put on something else or put on other things in conjunction with
4771.46s:  it at the same time.
4773.82s:  So this is the idea here on how I start building a portfolio.
4783.02s:  So I'll take a pause here and see if that makes sense.
4786.58s:  If you guys have any questions, and then this is also the perfect time.
4789.98s:  If you have any other questions related to portfolio, options trading, something else
4794.58s:  that you're working on that you're interested in getting some feedback.
4797.74s:  Now is the perfect time for general broad questions about trading or whatever else.
4803.38s:  But if you have any specifics on this, happy to dive into it.
4808.58s:  Nian says, I sell a call by a call $1 higher, collect $3 credit.
4813.94s:  Yeah, it's not right.
4818.10s:  So that's why it's a credit spread and not a debit spread.
4826.26s:  Nian, Nathan is trying to help you, dog.
4828.46s:  I would be nice to Nathan because Nathan is trying to help you reason through your position
4832.86s:  because it's like, what you're describing is completely wrong.
4837.62s:  So again, let's look at spy.
4840.26s:  We can look at an example together right now.
4842.02s:  This is using today's market.
4844.10s:  So we can go out to any any expiration.
4847.82s:  So in this case, 35 DTE.
4850.18s:  If I sell any option, it doesn't matter if it's at the money, in the money, around the
4854.90s:  money, none of it matters.
4856.90s:  I sell any option at a dollar wide.
4860.14s:  So if I do these 58s, 59s, I sell these 785s and then I buy these 555s.
4867.58s:  This is a credit spread.
4869.22s:  I get 55 cents.
4872.42s:  That's not $3.
4874.18s:  What you're talking about is literally an impossibility.
4877.30s:  You cannot make more money than the width of the spreads.
4883.62s:  So if you tell me of a dollar wide spread, you cannot make more than one dollar on the
4889.02s:  spread.
4890.02s:  Otherwise, it's an arbitrage opportunity.
4891.54s:  I would be picking those up in droves.
4894.06s:  I would sell my house to do more of them.
4897.34s:  It's not a thing.
4898.78s:  So my guess is you're making a mistake somewhere.
4901.62s:  I don't know where, but the way that you're talking about it is completely inaccurate.
4907.38s:  There's, yeah, there's just a mistake somewhere.
4910.74s:  I just can't tell you where, but I can tell you what's wrong.
4913.58s:  So yeah, that's that.
4917.58s:  Big A says, so if we needed money down the road to adjust the speculative, would we take
4921.74s:  it from the core?
4923.98s:  I would that would be baked into the plan ahead of time for me.
4926.90s:  For me, the way that that would work is I would go through the standard sizing for
4937.74s:  the core and the speculative allocation as I always do.
4942.10s:  So for example, on that speculative trade, I would decide before I put it up how much
4948.90s:  money it gets.
4949.94s:  And then that's what it gets.
4951.58s:  So let's say, for example, in that case, I don't even know what that would have taken
4955.06s:  to put on.
4957.26s:  But let's say that the margin requirement was $1,000 to put on that trade or again, whatever
4963.74s:  it was.
4964.86s:  So if I allocate mentally $3,000 to the trade, but I'm only using $1,000 to put it on
4972.82s:  up front, then that leaves me $2,000 to mess with that trade a little bit more.
4978.02s:  And that $2,000 belongs to that trade.
4981.02s:  Inverse scenarios, let's say I allocate $1,000 to that trade.
4985.74s:  And that's the margin requirement to put the trade on.
4988.30s:  One, you're not giving it quite enough because the margin requirement is likely to move.
4991.94s:  But that means that there's nothing to add to it.
4994.34s:  So for me, in that kind of position, there's no management actually.
4997.98s:  It's just does it hit one of my stops, yes or no.
5002.14s:  And if it does, then I get out.
5004.26s:  But I wouldn't try to start rolling shit.
5006.50s:  I wouldn't try to complicate it like that personally.
5009.30s:  Because that's how you start tying up a bunch of money trying to defend a trade that's
5014.50s:  not working well.
5016.10s:  And then you have nothing to show for it after a few months.
5018.66s:  You might be able to get out of your trade for a scratch.
5021.34s:  But now we're really far behind on hitting our $1,250 target.
5026.38s:  So yeah, for me, that specific trade that we were outlining, I wouldn't sit there and
5032.02s:  try to adjust it.
5033.42s:  Like the trade would be whatever it is.
5035.34s:  Either I'm cracked and price stays generally within that band or goes down, which I would
5041.02s:  still make money.
5042.82s:  Or I'm wrong and it goes up and then I lose and then I move on to something else.
5049.98s:  That is just how it goes.
5051.90s:  So yeah, it's a good question.
5054.02s:  But the short answer to it is I would very, very much define it ahead of time.
5059.38s:  I think that that's super important.
5061.62s:  So I realized that the color of these is way too similar.
5066.14s:  It's very difficult to tell the difference.
5067.82s:  There we go.
5068.82s:  That's better.
5069.82s:  Big Ace, let me know if that answers your question.
5074.66s:  But that's the general idea.
5080.42s:  Dr. Zayah says, can you explain the Analyze tab and toss like I'm fine.
5084.02s:  I look at the graph and my brain shuts down.
5085.78s:  Yeah, let's do it for sure.
5087.06s:  I would love to.
5088.26s:  I think the Analyze tab is actually a really, really great tool.
5092.02s:  So what aspect of the Analyze tab are we talking about?
5095.78s:  And Dr. Zayah, give me something that you want to actually analyze.
5099.26s:  Like is there a specific trade that you're looking at that's hard to understand or what
5103.30s:  component of the Analyze tab?
5108.94s:  Coming down.
5113.94s:  All right, we good.
5122.10s:  If not, I can just come up with a general example if you'd like.
5126.06s:  Basically how to read it, especially in a multi-leg strategy, yeah, for sure.
5129.30s:  We can we can take care of that.
5131.90s:  No worries.
5134.14s:  Let's take a look.
5141.70s:  He says I click on builder, call credit spread, dollar, go up to $3 and turn on my contracts.
5148.90s:  Yeah, but I mean, that's not what it is, man.
5151.38s:  So I cannot say at all what you're doing, but it's not that.
5156.38s:  So just be super careful.
5158.70s:  I again, I'm not even going into this to try to like get you or to try to make you feel
5163.54s:  any type of way.
5164.54s:  It's literally to try to help you because I can like, again, I can just tell you there's
5167.62s:  something wrong with that.
5168.70s:  I don't know what because I don't have the position on myself and I'm not actually
5174.50s:  positive that you're explaining it exactly correctly.
5177.30s:  And again, that's not a dig at you, but I'm just saying based on the details you're giving
5181.86s:  me, it's something's wrong.
5186.46s:  And that's the problem with options is that that kind of stuff happens literally all the
5190.78s:  time with people.
5192.62s:  So it is super difficult and it's easy to mess up.
5198.70s:  So yeah, just be careful.
5200.58s:  Waldo, I love you too, man.
5201.78s:  Thanks for coming to hang out.
5202.78s:  I'm glad that the channel is useful.
5204.86s:  That's exactly what we love to hear.
5207.46s:  All right, so let's take a look for Dr. Zayus about the analyze tab.
5212.50s:  Let's come up with a perspective trade.
5214.74s:  So let's take a look at spy.
5219.06s:  Well, actually, let's pretend we're building a trade for that same portfolio, but now we'll
5223.42s:  do it with like live stuff.
5225.46s:  I literally just took a trade down and TGTX today that I would run again.
5231.90s:  Upstart looks good.
5234.18s:  Let's see how upstart looks.
5235.66s:  Yeah, I like upstart here a lot.
5239.78s:  So let's do something like 34 is this stop.
5251.86s:  I mean, this would be a better stop like 32.
5258.62s:  So this will get an alert at or below.
5264.50s:  And then we'll build a trade still bullish positioning for sure.
5277.26s:  And let's take a look at like these 63s.
5281.34s:  We want to trade it to the upside so we can take these are 20 wide.
5289.34s:  These are pretty narrow.
5290.34s:  These 35s.
5292.34s:  So we can grab these for like 685, 685 bucks.
5297.86s:  We'll go to the analyze.
5301.34s:  685.
5302.34s:  We need to use a little bit more money here.
5307.42s:  We need to add a couple more of these.
5309.38s:  What I'm doing is I'm creating.
5315.30s:  I'm creating a view for us to look at how this behaves at different price points.
5322.46s:  So what I like to do is I like to use standard deviations.
5326.62s:  So I'll do plus one standard deviation plus two standard deviation plus three.
5330.70s:  Then it will be spot price.
5332.46s:  Then I'll do minus one minus two minus three.
5337.90s:  And then you'll notice that there's two more down here that are just blank.
5342.06s:  That's so I can type in specific numbers that I think specifically normally my stops.
5347.22s:  So in this case, my stop would be probably like 32 or like 31 98 or just below that essentially.
5356.74s:  So if we go to here and I type in something like 31 90.
5364.46s:  So this trade would lose 15 77 to the downside here.
5369.42s:  So we can now grab our handy dandy Excel sheet and do our math.
5375.26s:  So in this case, we're risking 15 77.
5379.74s:  And then the probability of hitting 31 90.
5384.42s:  In our time frame, which is probably like 30 days ish.
5390.54s:  Probability of hitting 31 90 is like 45%.
5394.42s:  So we'll give that a 45% probability of happening.
5401.22s:  And then to the upside, let's see what our near term target is.
5405.70s:  We got two years looks like consolidation.
5408.42s:  It's like literally in the congestion zone.
5411.58s:  But this is where this is where the next volume note is.
5416.90s:  Right there at 44 34.
5421.22s:  So then we go back in here.
5425.82s:  We go back in here.
5427.86s:  This one gets 44 34.
5433.06s:  And we would make three grand if it hits 44 34.
5436.22s:  What's the probability of us hitting 44 34.
5441.26s:  Like 38%.
5444.22s:  So 38 and we would make 30 65 positively expectant trade.
5457.54s:  So this is good risk.
5459.94s:  So now let's talk about how we analyze this for a doctor, Zayas.
5469.02s:  So your why axis here is just PNL.
5473.90s:  So anything above this line here is positive below is negative.
5479.22s:  Then your x axis is the price of the underlying.
5483.86s:  I actually literally might make a video about this really quick.
5487.30s:  Because I've gotten more questions on this like how to read the analyze tab and think
5490.50s:  or swim.
5491.50s:  Actually, let me take a note.
5492.50s:  Literally as soon as we wrap up.
5494.50s:  I'll make a video on how to do this.
5496.30s:  So I think it would be useful for people and I actually get asked it relatively frequently.
5504.74s:  The reading analyzed.
5511.74s:  Cool.
5513.90s:  So this is still single leg trade.
5516.22s:  So for your example, I would then maybe sell some options here.
5521.62s:  So like maybe these, maybe these sell like two of those.
5529.18s:  Maybe three.
5531.42s:  Yeah, that's cool.
5533.78s:  Then we'll zoom this in.
5536.38s:  So the reason why there's two lines is because there are options.
5542.22s:  They have a value today and they have a value at expiration.
5546.78s:  You see these dates down here in the corner.
5549.26s:  So the purple line is showing you today's date.
5551.86s:  The blue line is showing you the value of the option at expiration.
5556.30s:  So you'll see if I click this button down here and change the time.
5561.22s:  So like right here, I'm fast forwarding time.
5563.54s:  You've noticed how essentially these lines converge on one another until we get into
5568.90s:  the expiration for the short options.
5574.58s:  So that's why there's two lines.
5576.22s:  It's showing you two different periods in time.
5579.06s:  And then this is just showing you the PNL of the position.
5586.30s:  And then the probability analysis gives you the ability to analyze the probability of things
5590.82s:  hitting this is using option prices to see the probability of hitting different points.
5595.30s:  So that's what this is showing you the probability of hitting these different points.
5600.46s:  So plus three plus two plus one zero one two three standard deviations.
5605.34s:  That's what all these are.
5607.18s:  And it's letting you know the probability of hitting those within different time frames.
5612.18s:  So that it's easier to understand.
5614.46s:  That's actually why I like to use probability of touch.
5616.86s:  A big mistake here is people use probability of in the money.
5620.18s:  And then they'll get way more favorable probabilities.
5623.66s:  But if you're trading things based on stops, it's not about in the money.
5628.34s:  It's about what's the probability of touching in that time frame, which is what this looks
5632.54s:  at.
5633.70s:  So yeah, I'll make a video about this literally soon as we wrap up here.
5636.98s:  So you guys have it.
5640.38s:  Anything else you guys want to cover any last calls, any remaining lingering questions we
5644.90s:  want to dive into.
5646.02s:  And while we're thinking about that, I'm just going to open the door from a pup.
5650.18s:  Cool.
5657.18s:  Looking quiet out there.
5663.46s:  So the game plan going forward for these sessions is going to be less prescriptive now.
5670.46s:  So we've gotten through 10 sessions here.
5672.86s:  My goal is for the future sessions.
5674.70s:  I'm going to continue Fridays being specific for options trading for beginners, but it
5681.90s:  will be much more ad hoc based on whatever you guys want to talk about.
5688.02s:  So it'll be really important for me to get feedback from you all.
5692.54s:  And whenever I'm making the post about the session to hear what you guys want to cover
5699.02s:  so that we have a good agenda for the sessions.
5701.98s:  It will be much more open ended and it'll be still very, very geared towards beginners.
5708.26s:  So that wraps me up for today.
5711.46s:  As always, whatever you guys need, just let me know.
5713.86s:  I will see you guys at the GME live stream tomorrow.
5716.22s:  And then for the outlier, pro members, we have our next live stream on Sunday.
5720.06s:  Be an outlier.
5721.06s:  I'll see you guys later.
