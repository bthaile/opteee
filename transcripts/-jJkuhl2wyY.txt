0.00s:  What is up, outliers. Happy Friday and today we have options trading for beginners. On the agenda
11.12s:  is going to be kind of a quick conversational quiz. And then after our conversational quiz,
18.72s:  I want to take a look at some case studies. But the conversation today is very open-ended.
23.96s:  This is kind of our first departure from a regimented series of topics. So this is part
30.92s:  of 11, episode 11, whatever we want to call it, number 11.
36.92s:  So I'm using this as a bit of a gauge to see where we're at, how people are feeling about
45.36s:  options to kind of see where we're sitting. Because then I'm going to make another piece
51.52s:  of curriculum for us that will go on essentially for another nine episodes beyond this. So the way
58.56s:  I'm looking at it is like the first 10 episodes we've done have been really designed to lay the
63.84s:  foundation for the rest of this. And then my intention is going forward. I want us to continue building
70.56s:  off of what we've learned so far. And then for newer traders that are just joining us in the series,
79.12s:  you can essentially go back into what we've covered so far. And then get kind of caught up
86.08s:  with where we're at now and then go from there. So that's what I'm thinking today. And then for
94.00s:  everybody's awareness tomorrow is going to be a GME live stream at 5pm Pacific time. So we'll
102.40s:  cover that kind of in detail tomorrow. So that's the upcoming agenda. Now in the meantime, while we're
109.52s:  waiting for a couple folks to trickle their way in, I have a couple more pictures from Alaska. I
115.04s:  thought I would show you guys because I recently went on a trip there, flew the drone, had a bunch of
121.84s:  fun. And so I'll kind of flip through some of these. I don't know which ones I showed you already
127.12s:  and which ones I didn't. But I'll kind of like I said, I'll just blast through some of these so
132.72s:  that you can kind of check out some of what we saw because we were kind of stunned by what we saw.
139.92s:  This is all this big giant glacier area that we were hanging around. And this is kind of like this
145.36s:  trail that takes you up to this glacier. So there's a giant big ice field essentially on the other
151.92s:  side of this, which is really cool. And then if you guys haven't seen before, that's a close-up
156.72s:  of what it looks like kind of top down on a glacier, which I find the texture is absolutely
162.96s:  fascinating, which is why obviously I share this picture. I also like this one a lot. I don't know
169.60s:  why I think it's because of the mix of like live trees and dead trees, life and death. I don't know,
174.72s:  maybe I'm just super artistic and I don't know it. But I like that one a lot. And then I will show
179.92s:  you guys this last one. I don't know if you've seen it, but that one I just thought was super cool.
185.12s:  We just have this bald eagle, let it rip. And what is just super cool backdrop. So yeah,
193.04s:  couple photos for you guys. The trip was overall sick. I do have a video of some of the helicopter
199.36s:  ride that we went on if you are ever interested in checking that out. But that's what I got for us
206.08s:  so far. All right, gang. So let's get into the option side of the house. First we got to say hello
212.96s:  to everybody. We got Liz, Paulo, Spascar, that's kind of a fun name, Bean, Doku Doki. That's
219.76s:  another fun one. I like that. Reese and Bean says, I remember you saying you sold your
226.72s:  SEP GME calls. Do you ever buy back in? Nope. So right now in GME for the option side of things,
235.12s:  I'm actually quite limited. And I have some short calls against my long shares, but that's it.
243.28s:  I don't have any directional GME options on right now. The way that I think about trading options
250.00s:  is I need movement. And GameStop is just not moving right now. So while it's not moving,
256.56s:  I don't put on like directional options trades, you know, like buying long calls or kind of my
263.44s:  standard go to suite of strategies. And it's because they won't make money. I need the stock to move
270.24s:  and it's not moving right now. So the way that I think about that is as I see volume starting to
279.04s:  come in a little bit more meaningfully, then I'll happily start to trade it more speculatively. But
285.20s:  I also wouldn't trade it before earnings at this point unless I wanted to trade it through earnings,
290.08s:  which I don't have a good fingerprint for GME through earnings. It looks okay. Actually,
296.80s:  I don't hate this through earnings. And then the times that it be big drop down.
304.88s:  Yeah, like I don't hate this for earnings. So there might be an earnings play on the docket for GME
312.08s:  TBD. We'll see. There we go. I think I think I've rhymed that all the way out. Go me.
318.64s:  We also have Graveteris, John, Tom and Colonel. Great. We got we got everybody here. We have the
324.00s:  whole gang in town ready to talk about options trading, which I love. So the way the session will work
333.20s:  is I'm going to run through a couple really basic options questions. And I'm going to start with
341.28s:  some simpler stuff. And then it's designed to be conversational though. So I'm going to give you
347.84s:  guys something that you can look at. And then actually, let me grab this so it'll be a little
353.92s:  bit easier. I can pull some of the questions. These are all random questions that I've generated
359.12s:  over time and different things. I'm going to grab a couple from here. But then I really want to
362.64s:  spend time going through the platform and asking specific questions in here. It's not going to be
366.96s:  super long. We might do like five or 10. But the main thing I want to work on in this with you
375.20s:  is trying to continue to hone both the practical and the theoretical understanding of options.
384.24s:  So that's the idea. This takes a minute because this workbook is becoming like really, really,
390.80s:  large. It's actually taking even longer than I would expect. There we go. All right. So let's get
399.44s:  this zoomed in. And then close that out. Pull that up. What's this one? Those are just old questions.
411.68s:  All right, here we go. So I will highlight the question part. It's going to be multiple choice.
418.32s:  So you have the option. Check me out to literally just put in a letter. So it'll be a little
424.16s:  easier for you to answer. Here is your first question.
436.48s:  So when you know the answer, you could just drop it in the chat and you can just use a letter,
442.40s:  which would make it kind of easy. And then we'll talk a little bit about the question itself.
448.96s:  So the question here says an investor buys 10 XYZ. That's the stock. May 70 calls at $3.10
458.56s:  when the stock is trading at 68. At expiration, the stock is now at 77. And the trader closes the
468.96s:  position at intrinsic value. What is there? P and L.
477.36s:  Alfonso says is the image cropped. Yes, it is cropped. Oh, my bad. I see. I got to move it
482.00s:  over a little further. That's where you're telling me. Hold on. One second. Stand by.
486.08s:  So let me see. That's too far. We need it to be right there. There you go.
499.92s:  Rease says 3.9. Tom says D. Rease changes to D, which is again, the same is just making it easier
509.92s:  for me because he knows that I am an idiot. So that's I appreciate that. Rease keeping it,
515.84s:  keeping it all super linear for my brain to handle it looks like Evan flow portfolio just showed up,
521.28s:  which is great. CSY says what program do you use? It's thinkorswim. That's what you see in the
527.44s:  background there. All right. Any other answers? We got to so far. Any well, I guess I can
537.04s:  phrase it this way. Are there any other answers, meaning anything different than these?
544.48s:  Liz also says D. Cool. So for anybody that didn't answer, so anybody that is not
554.00s:  Reese Tom Liz or Paulo for anybody that is not them. Ah, perfect. Alfonso. There we go. We always
563.44s:  have to find one of them. So Alfonso, it's a brave answer going against the crowd. I respect that.
570.08s:  In this case, it was a terrible time to go against the crowd because you're 100% wrong. So let's
575.36s:  focus on you. Obviously. So Alfonso walk me through why you think it's A. And then simultaneously,
586.16s:  John, the question is on the screen. If you're driving or something, I'll read it out again.
591.60s:  The question is an investor buys 10 of the XYZ may 70 calls for $3.10, 3.1 when XYZ is at 68.
602.64s:  At expiration, the stock is at 77 and the trader closes the position at intrinsic value. What's
608.80s:  the PNO? So in case those were wondering, this isn't a question even that I made up on my own.
614.24s:  A lot of the questions that I like to grab are from like a series seven licensing exam.
619.68s:  Actual like legitimate exams so that you can see the kind of stuff that goes into that, which is
624.32s:  hilarious, right? Because if you think from an options trading perspective, that this is what we're
628.72s:  obviously have to know this. So maybe it's like comical because it's super basic, but this is from a
634.24s:  series seven exam. So Alfonso walk me through why you think it's A. And then what I would love is
644.16s:  simultaneously. Okay, here we go. Alfonso says purchase was $3100. Intrinsic was guessing seven.
653.44s:  And then I guessed, okay, that's cool. That's totally cool. So let's grab our handy dandy white board.
663.12s:  And let me make sure I'm set up here to get my scribalon because that's what we are about to do.
669.28s:  We're about to get our, this is my favorite part, a chance to draw live because I'm known for my
674.72s:  artistry. A gravitaris says so the 68 is irrelevant. It could have been any number in PNO is the
683.20s:  same. Potentially, Carlos says need more info. Question makes no sense. The question makes total
696.40s:  sense. So Carlos, talk to me, what info do you need to answer this? So what we need to know is
704.96s:  intrinsic
713.36s:  and that's a C versus extrinsic.
722.48s:  So then, I see Carlos, it tells you, closes the position at its intrinsic value.
732.00s:  So that's what he closed the position at. Ramalamas here live and well. Ramas says
738.00s:  been trading spies zero DT for two weeks ended up today over a grand. I have to thank you. The
745.04s:  content is invaluable so much more to learn but starting to believe the possible to win consistently.
749.04s:  That's awesome. First of all, congratulations. The second thing is I would highly encourage you to
753.04s:  not worry so much about winning consistently but winning long term. But yeah, that's awesome.
758.16s:  I'm really, really stoked that your question is huge. Ramalamas says answer is D that is also correct.
764.88s:  So Alfonso is now doing the math. So if the stock is at $77, here, I guess I need another color to
779.20s:  make that easier to see. One sec standby. So the stock is at $77. We have a strike at $70. We're
790.56s:  essentially saying we're only looking at intrinsic value. It's giving you exactly what we care
797.84s:  about intrinsic value. So we don't care about extrinsic value. So intrinsic value is Spanish
806.40s:  for how far in the money. These are the same. So if we have our strike at $70,
821.84s:  strike is $70. Stock is $77. How far in the money is the call?
839.84s:  7. So exactly as Alfonso highlighted, this is how far in the money we are.
851.44s:  Except we need to, we're trying to figure out what's the P&L profit and loss. So it's not just
857.76s:  what's the intrinsic value. It's telling you that's where we're getting out at.
863.20s:  But we need to take into account what the cost is. So you guys walked right on target.
870.32s:  So that's exactly correct. We need to take the cost out of this, which results in letter D,
876.16s:  which is the correct answer here. Bingo. Nice job. All right. Next question. I'm going to add a
887.28s:  group here. So that'll be a little easier. Does that one make sense? Is everybody good on how we
899.52s:  arrive at that? Okay. Good. So fuck it. Delete it. Hold on. One second. One second. Here we go.
908.56s:  Alfonso says intrinsic isn't a Spanish word. Oh, yes, it is. Intrinsic is the direct translation
915.84s:  in Espanol is how far in the money? Word for word verbatim. Take that to the bank. That's just
922.16s:  sign sealed and delivered. Obviously kidding.
930.16s:  Toku Toku says from where do you get the 7,000? It's a great question. So the way we get the 7,000
938.00s:  is worth $7 in the money. So we have 10 contracts from over here.
948.88s:  Right. So our bought to open price is 10 contracts times the 100 multiplier times 3.1.
961.92s:  So this is where we're getting 3,100. Then we have to do that same math over here. 10 contracts
971.36s:  times our multiplier of 100 times 7. This is where we're getting 7 bands for your boy.
981.60s:  So this is what we ended up selling it for right here. This is what we bought it for.
989.92s:  So our PNL is the net between these, which gives you this one. Okay, cool. It looks like
1007.20s:  Toku Doki is on board. That's what we're looking for. We're looking for everybody being on board
1012.96s:  the train. Yeah, of course, that's perfect. That's exactly what we're looking to accomplish here.
1017.60s:  So I'm glad it was helpful. I will clean this one up, get it up out our way, add another layer,
1024.96s:  group this, minus commissions. Yep, John is exactly right. So this is looking at it in a frictionless
1034.88s:  environment. So in a frictionless environment, we're kind of just talking from a theoretical
1039.68s:  standpoint, but John, you are literally 100% correct that we would in a real sense need to take
1046.88s:  commissions into the equation as well as spread if we wanted to be even kind of more precise
1055.04s:  to figure out what the total cost is. That's exactly correct, John. And then Carlos says,
1059.60s:  but don't you have to factor in the Greeks like Delta and Theta. So Carlos, for you specifically,
1067.84s:  why do you think we need to integrate the Greeks like Delta and Theta when we're calculating the
1075.84s:  P and L of an option? Walk me through why you think that's the case. And then in the meantime,
1081.20s:  I'll grab something that I think might be helpful for us to look at together, which is Eric's handy
1088.64s:  dandy. I mean, this is really a bit of an abomination if we're being honest with ourselves.
1093.20s:  Like this deck is so it's like, it's pretty terrible. It's all over the place. I have just a
1100.24s:  random smattering of junk, but I hope at least it's marginally useful. That's the goal. Also,
1107.28s:  I need this to be like super precise. Okay, so let's grab this. Let's grab this.
1114.64s:  Carlos says, I don't know, never mind. Is that I don't know, never mind? Because you don't know why
1119.52s:  or do you still think that those should be integrated, but you're just not sure why they're not.
1125.04s:  Because if you're if you understand why they're not integrated, then I'll move on.
1129.76s:  But if you're not sure why they're not integrated, then I'd like to continue the point to make
1136.00s:  sure you get it. No, it was a bad question. No, it's literally, I'll tell you if it's a bad question.
1147.68s:  I because there are bad questions, but bad questions are relative to kind of the person who's asking
1154.48s:  them. So if you're new to options and that's a question you have, that's literally not a bad question
1160.32s:  at all. Like that's a completely fair question to ask. Yeah, so I'm in a similar boat as
1166.40s:  Sposcar. Like there, well, I disagree. I think there's tons of bad questions, but I think that
1172.72s:  the bad question, again, like a question is relative to the person who's asking.
1176.56s:  So if there's somebody that's new to something like a beginner, you really have is about a wide
1182.48s:  leeway gap, as you can imagine for asking questions. Now, if you guys saw there was a person that
1188.48s:  introduced themselves earlier in the chat named Tom A, if Tom A asked a dumb question, I'm
1194.64s:  going to let him know. I'm going to let him know big time. One, because I know him personally,
1198.96s:  but two, because he is more or less been around markets for a while. So if he asked a question
1206.00s:  about something that I don't think he's reasonable for him to know about, meaning like what's the
1212.32s:  disparity between stock XYZ and when we're plotting its log normal distribution, explain why
1222.40s:  kurtosis is actually a bad indicator for us to assimilate into a pricing model.
1228.96s:  Like I actually wouldn't expect Tom A to know that. So that's a fair question for his level.
1234.96s:  But if he asked me some stupid shit, I'm going to tell him it's some stupid shit. So it's
1239.28s:  I view questions at the level of the person asking. So if you're new to trading literally ask away,
1246.32s:  you have the utmost grace that you can be working with.
1252.48s:  Reset Eric with the Spanish again. Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you guys. I'm like super
1255.84s:  fluent in Spanish. I'm about to order Mexican food for dinner again. Like if that doesn't tell you
1261.04s:  how Spanish I am, I actually don't know what does. I am essentially Spanish, I think.
1268.16s:  I think there's this. So for those that don't have it, I recommend grabbing a screenshot of this.
1275.68s:  So this is just a really quick reference for you to work off of. And then actually let me write
1281.52s:  this out. So it's clear. VAL utility. You can grab a screenshot of this. So the reason for
1292.80s:  Carlos that was wondering about the Greeks, the Greeks just measure things. That's it. So Greeks
1299.84s:  are slaved to options, not the other way around. So that's why the simple answer to that, why
1308.40s:  don't we consider the Greeks in that P&L calculation is because they literally don't matter.
1313.28s:  We're at expiration and something calculating what essentially we paid versus what it's worth.
1319.12s:  These don't have a say in that. And then the other one you guys can grab a screenshot of is this one,
1325.04s:  which is kind of like the more comprehensive I have a YouTube video all about the Greeks.
1330.16s:  So I'll also grab that super fast for you in case you're looking to get into detail on the Greeks.
1341.12s:  There you go. And yeah, that should get you a little more familiar. But yeah, that was a completely
1350.24s:  fine question. I next question. This one I'm actually really curious because this essentially has
1357.76s:  nothing to do with options. But it's again from a series seven exam. So I think it's a good question
1365.04s:  nonetheless. So this is more of a general market understanding. The reason why I think this one
1371.12s:  is still relevant to us is because we need to understand these relationships. Again, like if you're
1377.92s:  going to be a trader, this is a still an important relationship that you have to know.
1384.64s:  So here we go. CSY says anyway, I can get that PowerPoint. So great question. It's a fair question,
1391.04s:  but no, there is no way because it's not done. That's going to be one of those PowerPoints that I'm
1396.80s:  going to work on. That's literally never going to be done because I'm going to keep building it.
1401.04s:  So I don't feel comfortable filling some like sharing something that's super, super not done.
1406.64s:  And that's not even close. So yeah, there's that. All right, here's our next question.
1414.32s:  A US importer is buying 10,000 worth of goods from a Japanese manufacturer. It's very American of us.
1424.00s:  The payment will be made six months from now in the Japanese yen to hedge what would the US
1434.64s:  importer do with they buy puts on the dollar by calls on the dollar by puts on the yen by calls on the
1443.52s:  yen.
1448.72s:  Paulo, it is not cut off. Don't try to gaslight me. I already told you
1454.80s:  Mel recently explained to me what gaslighting is. So I am now gaslight impervious. You can't
1460.88s:  you can't gaslight me at this point because I know what the word means and I won't be fooled again.
1466.96s:  A lot of seas.
1473.44s:  So, Cravitarist is running with D.
1478.48s:  Evan flows D. Willie Sposcar Tom Carlos C. Big Ace opted to not tell me which one. So I have to
1487.04s:  look it up. That's annoying. Puts yen. Okay. C. Liz says C. Willie says C. Rises C. Jason says C.
1497.04s:  We are near unanimous C. Working investor comes in at C.
1506.88s:  Silent sleeper says D. Good to see somebody bucking the majority. I always love that. All right.
1514.00s:  So I would love for Gravitarist, Ebb and Flow or Silent Sleeper to explain their answer
1528.00s:  because they are the minority.
1531.36s:  Paul says D. John says B. The first B I think I've seen. That's brave.
1543.60s:  Gravitarist says if Yen goes down, we get a discount. And if Yen goes up, we get money on calls.
1553.84s:  I like the logic. Can I get somebody from the C cohort to explain why they think it's C.
1564.64s:  So we have future whale, kernel, ape of trades, working investor, Jason Reese, Willie, Liz.
1574.72s:  Future whale, there is no C or B. This is a single choice only exam.
1580.40s:  Big A says you asked how to hedge it, not make money. Okay. Well, that that attempts to discount
1589.04s:  Gravitarist's answer, but that doesn't explain your answer of C.
1598.16s:  Rises hedge our payment in case Yen goes tits up. So think of that.
1605.36s:  Buy puts on Japanese yen to hedge the risk of a decrease in Yen's value.
1611.36s:  Another fair guess. So let's work through this logically. Again, this is more for you to understand
1618.56s:  how markets work than anything else. The very first thing to know.
1624.96s:  Nian says if Yen goes tits up, we win in the payment. So we would put on USD.
1637.68s:  Negative. Gravitarist says I suppose I don't know the definition of hedging. Hedging is simply
1643.76s:  to reduce risk.
1650.48s:  Payment, Tom says payment is being made in Yen. So if the value of the Yen goes down,
1656.00s:  then puts will hedge that risk. This is fascinating.
1665.52s:  Evan flow says if Japan is receiving the money of 10 million, I want to make money
1670.32s:  when they receive that. So I choose call. That's interesting. So we have a couple instances of
1678.32s:  they're correct, but for the wrong answer. So let's do that. Let's get through what's correct,
1688.08s:  what's not correct. The very first thing is anything related to the US dollar we don't care about.
1696.00s:  We don't care about A, we don't care about B. This is not what we're looking to hedge. This is
1704.08s:  essentially going to be a controlled based on whatever the US economy is. We don't care about
1710.48s:  this. Our value risk comes from the Yen. So now let's go a little bit further. If I am agreeing to
1722.56s:  buy 10 million US dollars worth of goods, I'm going to give you 10 million dollars. That's US
1732.72s:  dollars is my side of the equation that's going to turn into Yen. So I'm going to pay you in your
1739.84s:  your currency. What's more dangerous to my position? If I go to give you one dollar and my one US
1748.48s:  dollar is only worth 50 Yen or 50 cents. Yen, I don't know what 50 cents Yen is. Whatever that is,
1755.68s:  50 cents of Yen. Or if I go to give you my US dollar and it's worth 151.50 Yen, which scenario is
1772.16s:  better for me as you manufacturer? Ape of trade says Yen went up. That becomes the problem.
1781.44s:  So if the Yen increases in value, which means my one US dollar buys me less Yen because the Yen
1792.08s:  went up in value, that's my risk. That's what's dangerous to me. So then out of C or D,
1803.52s:  which of those benefits me if the Yen value goes up, which is the scenario that causes me
1814.56s:  damage. Ape of trade says calls on Yen would hedge. Then we're rolling in with the D's. That's
1822.16s:  exactly correct. John is good. Tom is good. Paula says Yen has no sense. That's actually really
1827.36s:  good to know. Thank you. Dr. Zayah says D. Yeah, that's good. So again, the reason why this stuff
1835.28s:  matters is because you're starting to get an idea of how market participants engage in markets
1842.72s:  and what they're doing and why they're doing it, what their incentive structures are.
1847.52s:  So that's why I thought this is a good question to work through. So I love this.
1855.36s:  All right. Any other residual questions on this one are we generally good?
1861.92s:  Really good.
1866.80s:  Willie says don't understand. Totally cool. So let's try and let me see if I can help elucidate the point.
1876.96s:  Gravitary says was the reasoning I had correct. I don't remember what your reasoning was.
1883.44s:  To be honest, if you repaced it, let me know.
1885.76s:  Evan Flow also is unsure and same as Reese. That's cool. Yeah. So let's get it. Let's get this down.
1899.52s:  So pretend it's not 10 million. One of the easiest things you can do to help yourself
1905.44s:  kind of answer questions like this is just reduce all of the stuff down to its simplest terms.
1915.04s:  So let's just say we're going to buy a dollar. Oh, shit, that got stuck. Let's say we're going to buy
1919.76s:  a dollar you at Jesus. Oh, I think my bracelet is hitting it. So we're going to buy one US dollar
1927.84s:  of something. And instead of it being six months from now, again, don't even worry about how long it is.
1933.84s:  Think just future in the future. Future in yen.
1941.20s:  Now, let's start with kind of a baseline. Let's say today,
1951.84s:  one dollar US equals, I don't know the yen symbol. I think it's like a Y with two lines through
1959.76s:  it, but I don't know where the lines are. Well, on Japanese yen symbol.
1965.20s:  Okay. So like the bottom of the stem. Okay. So today in this hypothetical example,
1975.84s:  one dollar equals one yen with just a Y with two lines through it.
1984.88s:  So we'll take a pause here for who was it, Willie? Because you were the brave one to say that
1991.12s:  you were uncertain. So I'll work with you specifically. So Willie, does this first scenario make
1997.92s:  sense to you? Right now, we're looking at a scenario where they're both equal to each other.
2006.64s:  Okay, we'll with us. Perfect. So now we have two potential scenarios in the future.
2013.52s:  The yen goes up in value, meaning it becomes more expensive relative to the dollar,
2024.96s:  or the yen declines in value, and it becomes cheaper to the dollar. So if the yen goes up,
2032.40s:  in this case, our one US dollar is equivalent. You guys told me there's no
2043.20s:  sense in yen, but there's going to be sense in this example to make it simple.
2047.20s:  Is going to buy you half of one yen. This is where the yen goes up. In this example, yen goes down.
2056.72s:  So then your one US dollar now can buy you two yen.
2066.32s:  Do these two scenarios make sense so far for you, Willie?
2077.28s:  So what I'm highlighting is there is a scenario where the yen, the value of the yen relative
2082.08s:  to the dollar goes up. Okay, cool. So now, if originally, my original guess was I wanted to pay
2094.08s:  one dollar for something. In this scenario, this one dollar doesn't go as far. So if I was going to buy
2104.56s:  one dollar, and that gives me 10 widgets, let's say, just to add another number, 10 widgets, 10 things.
2113.84s:  That's what I was originally expecting to get. I was going to give them one dollar in this
2117.68s:  scenario from the starting point. I was going to give them one dollar and I was going to get 10 widgets.
2121.20s:  If the value of the yen goes up, and now my one dollar is only worth half of a single yen,
2130.80s:  that means when I give them my dollar, I'm only going to get five widgets.
2139.68s:  Because the yen has become more expensive relative to the dollar. So every time I give somebody my
2146.32s:  one US dollar, I get less stuff back. Willie, does that scenario so far make sense?
2159.60s:  So what I'm highlighting to you, okay, cool. So now, bring it home. We're looking at how can we save
2169.20s:  ourselves from this risk? If the value of the yen goes up, we can't get the same amount of shit,
2176.88s:  or if we want to get the same amount of shit. So in this case, we want to get our 10 widgets.
2183.20s:  We're going to have to give them two dollars now. So how can we protect our business deal and
2193.44s:  essentially make money if the yen goes up? That's why we would want to buy calls.
2201.44s:  Because the theory behind the, again, it's a theoretical position.
2207.44s:  So in the theoretical position, if this scenario happens, and I still want my 10 widgets,
2215.84s:  I have to pay instead of my one dollar, two dollars for my 10 widgets. So I have to come out of
2222.40s:  pocket more money. However, if I made money as the yen goes up, so instead of this doesn't change,
2232.88s:  this is going to be what I have to pay if the yen goes up. But the addition with these long calls
2239.52s:  means I might make a dollar as the yen goes up. So then that gives me the two dollars I need
2250.08s:  without having to put more money out of pocket to cover this variance. Now for everybody else that's
2257.44s:  following along, this is a highly simplified example of how this actually works, just to be
2264.96s:  abundantly clear. However, the part that I'm trying to express to you,
2270.56s:  uh, Sposcar says, wouldn't you want to see if the calls cost more than the potential of USD to pay?
2281.92s:  That starts to get into the theoretical positioning of things. Because again, the purpose of the calls
2289.28s:  is to offset risk. It's not because we're trying to bank if the yen goes up. We simply want to make
2296.64s:  sure that we're going to be able to get our 10 widgets without having to add more than 10 million
2303.76s:  US dollars from our initial outlay. So the purpose of the calls in this case,
2310.48s:  you to structure the trade again, they probably would use futures like it would be completely
2315.04s:  different than this. But in the theoretical scenario, the idea is if you buy calls on the yen,
2322.08s:  you make money on the calls that then offset the additional rise in price in the devaluation of the
2329.52s:  dollar. Well, he says, I see your point. Appreciate taking the time to explain. Yeah, definitely.
2336.72s:  Alfonso says borrow 10 million yen when you make the deal and pay it back in yen when you pay
2343.28s:  the supplier. Yep. So there's obviously other ways to hedge the position again. You just take the
2350.00s:  question for what for what it is. It's just teaching about the concept of using options to hedge.
2356.88s:  You can change this from currencies to something else. You can change it to a forward. It's it's just
2362.40s:  the concept that you should pay attention to here. More importantly, the other takeaway that you
2368.16s:  should have from this is when we're using options around other things. That's the main point.
2375.44s:  Evan flow says I seen that now because we're protecting our deal in the future, but we don't want
2382.16s:  to pay more than the agreed upon price. Yep. The calls are insurance to protect our future price
2388.16s:  fluctuations. That's exactly right. Yep. That's exactly correct. And the broader idea here is some
2394.96s:  people when I've given this question before, they're like, well, why don't you just pay them today?
2399.12s:  Well, why would I pay them today? If I don't have to pay them for six months,
2404.32s:  why would I give up six months of interest and pay them today? This makes no sense.
2412.72s:  So while if I paid them today, it would absolutely lock in the value. If I can put this $10
2420.48s:  million into some sort of interest bearing account that I can then use to subsidize the cost of,
2428.64s:  in this example, long calls, now essentially I have a hedge that subsidized via my original principle.
2436.40s:  So again, it's just a general example designed to help connect a couple dots. It's not a practical
2443.84s:  example of how this actually would work. This is not how it would go, but this is how it goes.
2449.44s:  Ape of spades says I wish you would use more bananas. That's fair. So instead of 10 widgets,
2454.16s:  we're buying 10 bananas. I'm not sure why we would want to go to Japan to buy bananas. Maybe
2460.32s:  they have really good bananas or something, but maybe we just like exotic bananas. That could be what
2465.44s:  it is. Cool. That's that question. We'll do one more of these and then we'll take a look at
2474.24s:  something else.
2475.44s:  Alfonso says there was almost zero interest on the yen for years. That's why people would borrow
2485.20s:  yen to finance other currencies. Yeah, absolutely. And that's also why the carry trade was a thing
2489.84s:  for a long time, definitely. From again, actual real life example, the yen was really interesting
2498.16s:  for that for quite a while. And even now, I mean, it's still at an astronomically low rate.
2504.88s:  So yeah, for sure. All right.
2517.28s:  Let's do.
2524.48s:  Do we want an easy question or a hard question?
2528.56s:  And then depending on the level of difficulty we want, I'll structure something for you.
2538.16s:  All right. We want a hard question. We can do this. Let me find something
2545.36s:  a little more interesting. Here we go.
2549.44s:  Now again, this is going to be hard relative to a new trader. Like, if you're an experienced
2557.68s:  trader, this question still is not hard at all.
2561.60s:  Audiencing, my goal is not to stump people. My goal is to try to teach. So
2567.36s:  oh, that'll stump you.
2572.48s:  Explain to me what volatility term structure is.
2579.84s:  This is different than a volatility surface.
2583.36s:  So walk me through what a volatility term structure is.
2597.60s:  And it's okay to take your time because I'm about to order some Mexican food.
2605.12s:  Which is funny because I'm not really one of those Californians that really likes Mexican food.
2609.28s:  I typically Mexican food is good, but I'm not like freaking out about it. I much prefer Italian
2614.64s:  and stuff like that.
2618.00s:  Reese says no multiple choice. No. If you guys ask for a hard question, hard questions are not
2623.12s:  multiple choice.
2624.32s:  Able space says too hard.
2626.96s:  This is you guys are tripping.
2632.24s:  Suppose cars says no.
2640.32s:  Yo, you guys fucking cracked me up, man. I love this. This is so fun.
2645.84s:  IV over time. There we go. We're getting there.
2650.08s:  That's so awesome.
2651.60s:  Let me find.
2659.76s:  That's not good enough.
2662.08s:  Oh, see, that's some see. I have to add this to my unfinished crappy deck.
2669.60s:  We'll look at some GME.
2672.72s:  Epe of trades has expected vol during option period. That's incorrect.
2677.36s:  Gravitaris says different volatility for different dates. There we go. That's exactly correct.
2683.60s:  So,
2685.76s:  Reese says GME has always the answer.
2691.04s:  Whatever you need an answer, it's in GME.
2695.52s:  It's awesome.
2699.36s:  So a volatility term structure, it simply tells us what volatility looks like over different
2706.24s:  timeframes. That's all. So in this case, you can derive a volatility term structure directly
2713.12s:  from these numbers. This right here. So for example, if I drew a line, let's just pick three of them.
2721.92s:  There's 163, 90, and 85. 163, 90, and 85. I gotta grab my notepad again. I just slid it out of the way.
2737.12s:  All right. So we have vol here, which is 0.1. So this is like, let's just do like T0 or T1.
2747.84s:  Let's do T2. And then let's do T3.
2753.44s:  And then here's the starting point. These are just like ticks. These are out in time.
2759.92s:  So then we had 169, whatever it was, this axis will be vol. We had 169, then we had like 90,
2772.72s:  and then we had like 80, 5 or whatever the fuck. So in this case, this is your term structure.
2782.00s:  So in this case, it's showing you what I just realized how terribly misaligned these are.
2795.44s:  Just pretend that they're aligned. This one is so bad. It's not even close.
2803.04s:  Just pretend that they're aligned. This should be over here. I directly aligned like this.
2807.84s:  But what I'm showing you is volatility over different time frames. That's what term structure is.
2816.64s:  And the reason why we care about term structure is that it gives us ideas on how much movement we
2825.52s:  expect a stock to have in the future. That's all implied volatility tells us. It is expected
2835.60s:  movement. So for example, if we come in here and I go to implied vault,
2843.84s:  and then let's take a look at the average, and then let's get rid of a lot of these.
2850.32s:  And let's just look at like the primary explorations.
2855.04s:  So if we use, these are super confusing because it's game stop. Normally, it's, let's just use
2861.20s:  another product for now. Bear with me because it'll just be a lot easier to see in something
2866.88s:  that's not as crazy. Okay. Apparently Apple is no better right now. Let's pick maybe GE. Yeah,
2875.20s:  this looks boring. This is also, it's because the market's closed. Anyways, if we use spot price,
2883.12s:  which is right here, this is another way to visualize what I was literally just showing you.
2891.36s:  So in this case, instead of looking at the monthly explorations in the access I was showing you
2898.40s:  like this, it's simply plotting different strikes, not the just the monthly expiration.
2906.96s:  But it's showing you the same exact thing. So we can see by the placement of these lines relative
2914.48s:  to one another for the at the money, what explorations we expect to be more volatile than the others.
2922.48s:  So for this case, we actually have 15 know on top of the 18 oct on top of the 20 step.
2931.60s:  So this also would have a downward sloping volatility term structure just like what I was just
2938.64s:  showing you. So that's what term structure is in this case. Now there's other things that you can
2946.32s:  add to this. So this is more of a volatility surface, which there are different versions of that.
2952.48s:  I don't know if I have one of those in here. Do I?
2959.04s:  Don't think so. Yeah, I don't. So let me add that to my to-do list actually. So I'll add like
2969.60s:  a volatility term structure and surface. I'll add that into the deck for us.
2981.04s:  But without that, this is just a way to visualize volatility over different time periods.
2987.44s:  It's why we care about it because our ability to understand volatility over different time periods
2992.96s:  can tell us where it's expensive on a relative basis, where it's cheap on a relative basis.
3000.32s:  So recess overall smile is the term structure. Smile in and of itself is a description
3009.36s:  for a term structure because it's not always a smile. So in this case,
3015.04s:  this front expiration is a smile. So this is looking just at the front expiration, the 23-og.
3025.04s:  And you can see just like when you smile, right? Your cheeks go up. That's what this is showing you.
3030.40s:  So this is a smile, but it's not always a smile. So sometimes it'll be a different shape
3037.04s:  like you see here. This is like a fucked up smile. This is a silly smile. So
3046.80s:  smile is a descriptor for term structure.
3053.36s:  Gravataris says does a smile imply bullish bear sentiment if they're skew?
3058.88s:  So if you'll remember from some of the OG GME videos I was doing and even this right here,
3064.72s:  this is a representation of skew. Now you have to be really, this starts getting into the weeds
3071.36s:  and I don't want to start going over people's heads here. So I'm going to gloss over this.
3075.12s:  I'm happy to go further into detail on this if anybody would like in the future. I just don't
3079.84s:  want to overwhelm people because this starts to get a little convoluted because what you'll almost
3084.96s:  always notice is the far out of the money options are going to have really high vols priced in.
3091.44s:  And they tend to be really expensive for what they are. That's a function of pricing models
3096.56s:  and the way market makers perceive their risk. I'll kind of leave that at that. So when we see skew,
3104.24s:  we can't immediately assume like right across the bat that if we see the call side higher than
3113.20s:  the put side that that automatically thinks we think it's going up because that can just mean we
3119.04s:  expect larger price movement or we can expect more risk to the upside. Some of it is going to be
3125.04s:  relative to the product you're looking for or looking at more often than not if you see and this
3133.20s:  is an important point. If you see the implied vols skewed for the same delta or the same distance,
3142.56s:  you can do either or so in this case spot prices about 20. So if I go to well, it's 22 technically.
3149.04s:  So I have to be a little more precise than that. So if it's 22 and I want to go plus or minus 10
3154.00s:  points, I can look at what the vol is at 32 and then I can take a look at what the vol is at 12.
3160.40s:  So if I go to 32, my vol is like 113 for this front expiration. If I go to 12,
3167.28s:  my vol in this case is like 95. So I can tell you that the calls are being priced with more vols
3174.08s:  than the puts, which is actually kind of backwards than what you typically would see. You generally
3179.12s:  see the put side priced heavier. So in this case, the market is pricing in more volatility,
3186.56s:  expected movement to the upside. It's exactly what it's telling me. It's why again, if you go through
3191.60s:  the GME videos, it's why I always look at this because the market makers as much as people like
3197.76s:  to make fun of them, they're fucking smart. They're smarter than I'll ever be. And they're the ones
3203.52s:  that are pricing the vols. So you kind of have to take the vols that they show you with a grain of
3209.20s:  salt sometimes and I do still price my own, but they're going to have a much more informed opinion
3214.24s:  over what they should be. And I would go with market vols over Eric's vols any day of the week,
3218.48s:  most of the time. I can sometimes tell if it's kind of just of a floating order of
3224.64s:  I wouldn't call it a spoof. That's more of a high frequency trading. But market makers to go
3228.80s:  a little further down the rabbit hole, they don't always show the current actual expected
3234.72s:  volatility for something because then it shows their cards. So a lot of times they'll rest
3240.72s:  vols that are an accurate. And then if somebody starts entering the market, they'll then adjust
3245.52s:  their vols to be more accurate. They don't want to show all the other market makers or other people
3250.16s:  that are making markets in that market. What they think it is. So
3258.08s:  Willie says they hire top talent math majors. Yeah, they literally have armies of PhDs. That's
3264.56s:  exactly why I say that they're super smart. Anybody that thinks that they're not smart. Again,
3269.84s:  I get it. It's sometimes fun to poke fun and stuff. And nobody's omnipotent. They also make
3274.64s:  mistakes too. But in general, they're really smart people. And that's just I think it's an
3280.80s:  important understanding to have when we look at the markets. The working investor says Tom Saznaf
3286.24s:  from Tasty mentioned that meme stocks tend to have calls you. They do because people fear the squeeze.
3291.36s:  They fear the upside. It's exactly why they have calls you. Whereas if I look at something again,
3297.20s:  let's take a look at GE. It has putt skew. The puts go literally has higher vols on the putts
3304.88s:  side. This is way more normal than what you see. This is an apple. This is the putt skew. Most
3311.92s:  options, most products are priced more so to fear the downside. But for things like Game Stop,
3320.80s:  where you can see these hyperbolic upside moves, there will be periods where we see these calls
3328.40s:  trade more expensively than the puts like this. That's exactly what that's pricing.
3336.80s:  Great discussion. And I'm always happy to talk about vol. I think it's super important.
3342.64s:  Reese says that calls skew is from the market makers hedging and not from retail buying excessive
3347.20s:  calls or one in the same. It's where they're pricing markets. So it's not from market makers
3353.84s:  hedging and it's not necessarily from retail buying excessive calls. Market makers decide
3361.28s:  they literally have a quote machine. So think of it this way. If I'm a market maker for Game Stop,
3366.80s:  I need to determine what I want to price these at. So these 40 calls. What do I want to price these
3376.32s:  at? How do I determine that? The way that they determine that is that they're just looking at
3382.24s:  volatility. That's the game. So they're figuring out what their best guess, what they think,
3388.64s:  what volatility makes sense for the product. And that's one of the cool parts about efficient
3394.64s:  markets. Because if I'm a market maker, the way I make money is by making markets is by gaining
3400.32s:  transactions. Cool. Now, if I make a market and the question might be, well, then why wouldn't
3408.08s:  they just always overestimate their volatility? That would definitely pad them better. It would make
3415.12s:  options more expensive and it would give them a better pad. However, markets are competitive.
3422.24s:  So if I'm padding my order too much and I'm pricing this right now, it's running at 139.39%
3430.80s:  and I want to be super conservative. So I want to pad the balls, make them higher so that I have
3436.24s:  more room to work with if my ball estimate is wrong. But there's other people. And if there's other
3443.28s:  balls that are more accurate, they're going to undercut you and then you're not going to get the volume.
3449.04s:  So that's one of the cool things about efficient markets is that market makers are really pushed
3453.84s:  to be more accurate in their calculations. The other thing that people don't fully appreciate
3460.72s:  is that individual market makers, their first job is to make markets. Their second job is to control
3467.92s:  their risk. So there's nothing that says, I as the market maker must price these options
3477.60s:  at the best possible theoretical value. If I already have a portfolio and based on market price
3486.32s:  action and something like GameStop and I really don't want to buy more calls. I don't want to buy more.
3493.44s:  Well, I can skew where I put my bid and offer. I can skew the market by putting in different
3501.76s:  balls or by literally changing where I rest my market. And it's not because they're trying to
3508.08s:  the fuck the retail trader, although it's not not because of that. But what they're trying to do is
3512.80s:  control their risk. So if because market makers are slaved to order flow, if order flows in one
3520.40s:  direction, they have to keep making markets. So if it's one direction, they're not having an
3526.56s:  opportunity to offload any of their book. I'm people are buying calls. So all the way up, I'm selling
3534.72s:  calls, I'm selling calls, I'm selling calls, I'm selling calls, which puts me short the stock.
3538.88s:  I don't want to be short the stock. But market market flow is still one direction, one
3543.84s:  direction for whatever reason. It's going super hard, one direction, gotta keep selling calls,
3548.08s:  selling calls, selling calls. I don't want to sell anymore calls. My risk is getting out of hand.
3553.44s:  In order to hedge all of these short calls now, I need to buy the shares. The shares are hard to
3558.64s:  borrow, hard to locate, whatever the case is there. Or I need to use other options. But now
3564.16s:  volatility is starting to change and it's becoming more expensive for me to hold the position.
3568.56s:  What market makers try to do is I'll sell the calls here and then the market moves a little bit
3574.88s:  than somebody else wants to sell there. So then I'll buy them back somewhere else at a fair
3578.88s:  valve value. And then I'll make a little bit of money on that exchange. That's what they prefer.
3583.20s:  But if you get one side persistent order, that's really, really difficult in order for them to
3588.56s:  manage. So that's why you'll see one skewed orders, right? You'll see skewed resting orders.
3601.12s:  Well, in this case, just resting markets that they're offering you because part of it is going
3605.76s:  to be based on their book. If they don't want to sell anymore calls, they might offer a better
3614.16s:  other side of that trade. So in this case, they're going to look to buy calls from somebody.
3618.96s:  So they might offer a better offer, a cheaper offer in a worse bid or whatever the case is,
3625.76s:  depending on their position, so that they can try to manage their risk. So the other thing that
3631.04s:  they'll do is they'll change the vault to widen the markets out to slow down movement. Because
3636.88s:  what is catastrophic is if a market maker who's a counterparty goes under water and they still
3642.96s:  have to be cleared by OCC, that creates a giant problem. So yeah, market makers have a really
3649.92s:  interesting place in the market. And I think they do have some power. They're not innocent people.
3657.92s:  They're money hungry like everybody else that's on Wall Street. But they also don't have
3663.04s:  like these superpowers that I think a lot of people, especially in like the ape and GME community
3668.72s:  think that they have. Because there's a lot of regulation that they have to maintain their
3673.84s:  quote machines for certain durations of time in order to maintain certain statuses in order to
3679.36s:  be granted order flow. So for example, somebody has asked me before, well, if they don't want to sell
3685.68s:  anymore calls, why don't they just turn off their quote machine? Well, they can, but then they
3690.24s:  can lose their status and their preferential treatment as a consistent market maker. Because
3695.28s:  what we don't want is directional market makers. We don't want to give them the ability to turn
3700.24s:  their shit on when they want to make money and then turn it off and they're like, okay, I'm good,
3703.52s:  I've made my money. That creates an incentive essentially for them to start trading directionally.
3708.88s:  We don't want that. So yeah, a little bit of a rabbit hole, but I think it's an important one for
3714.24s:  people to understand because I genuinely believe market makers are probably one of the more misunderstood
3720.80s:  entities that play in this whole ecosystem with us. At least that's my opinion.
3730.24s:  Any thoughts or questions on that? Riz says, how do you put in different balls? They decide. So
3735.84s:  they again, like they literally have a quote machine. So they'll have a volatility surface that,
3741.52s:  you know, estimates whatever they think volatility should be. And then they literally input
3746.96s:  the metrics that they think apply to it. What the risk-free rate is all that stuff.
3750.64s:  And then when they turn on their quote machine, that's what you see here. This is a market maker
3754.08s:  right here. Resting orders. This is in this can be to be clear. This can be retail traders.
3761.04s:  And I've seen it happen before. So for example, if I'm resting in order, let's say that this
3767.60s:  30 option is bid 57 offered 60. If I wanted to offer a bid at 58 and there wasn't a counter
3778.08s:  party at the time, this will move to 58. The size offered will change. In this case, you can see
3785.76s:  somebody's doing that. It's one by three 14. That means on the bid side, they're offering one
3793.04s:  at that price, 57. And they're offering 314 at the 60 on the offer side. So this is a prime
3802.64s:  example of another way that market makers can skew what they're giving you. They can say,
3807.36s:  I'm tired of selling calls. I don't want to sell any more calls. So in this case, I'm going to
3813.36s:  give you one call at 57. But if you want to buy them, I got a shits on for you boss. Come on in.
3820.80s:  I have 314 locked and loaded to go at the 60. So if you as a retail trader input and order
3829.20s:  that doesn't get filled right away and it's better than what's currently offered that would narrow
3834.32s:  the market down, your order will sit there. You'll see it. You'll literally see it move.
3839.20s:  And it's obviously easier to see on wider markets. But a lot of times we get filled really fast.
3844.56s:  So you don't actually have to deal with that too much. But yeah, this is that's exactly what the
3850.24s:  size is showing you is what's being offered at those prices. Cool. Yeah, I'm glad that that was
3858.32s:  useful for you guys. I think a Reese says we're too for an easy question. All right, fine. We can do
3866.88s:  an easy question. What's the difference between implied and historic volatility?
3885.84s:  That's pretty easy, I think.
3887.04s:  Future versus past. Yep. That's exactly right. Gravitaris has it spot off. That's exactly what it is.
3900.24s:  So implied volatility is forward looking expected volatility. And then historic volatility is what
3910.96s:  has happened in the past. It's exactly correct. Now to confound things a little bit,
3917.76s:  there's kind of a world called realized volatility. And realize volatility is really interesting.
3927.60s:  I'm not going to go super far into detail in this because I think there's a pretty solid chance
3934.96s:  that it's going to freak a lot of people out. So what I will do though is share a link with you
3944.08s:  on a video that goes into volatility so that it's a little more clear because you can have
3954.72s:  forecast volatility. You can have realized volatility. You can have future realized volatility.
3962.88s:  It can get a little confusing to that end. So we'll save that joy and wonderous experience
3971.04s:  for another time. So that's good. You guys got that down. Cool. So now I thought what we could do
3977.28s:  is pivot and take a look at a couple case studies. But this is also a perfect time. Whatever questions
3983.20s:  you have, start throwing them in because I probably have maybe another 15 minutes or so.
3987.84s:  And I would love to hit as much stuff as I can with you guys. Gravitarius says you have videos on
3992.24s:  how to find incorrectly bargain priced options. There's not really a way to do that. I mean,
4000.16s:  realistically speaking, like the probability of you as a retail trader finding a mispriced option
4005.68s:  is almost null. It's not zero. But the way you have to do that then is you have to find something
4012.56s:  where you think your volatility is priced better than the market volatility, which is
4021.28s:  real tricky because again, I told you when we look at market participants, especially institutions,
4028.16s:  they're really smart. And most of the larger institutions have derivatives desks and market
4033.28s:  makers and proffers. There's a lot of very serious committed traders to the markets where if you're
4038.80s:  trading options markets, a big part of your job is pricing volatility. So the concept of finding
4045.36s:  incorrectly priced options is predicated on somebody mispricing volatility. So unless you think
4052.64s:  you can price volatility better than market consensus, there's not really a way.
4060.88s:  Gravitarius says I got you. So we just have to try and ride the waves while the whales are making
4065.20s:  sort of to a degree like there's other things you can do though. So like, for example,
4071.12s:  this kink right here in GameStop, where I can see that this option here, which is what the 17 and
4078.64s:  a half or whatever, is much higher than the 17s. So I could come up with a relative value play.
4086.64s:  I could say I think the 17 vols are going to go up and I think the 17 half vols are going to go
4093.36s:  down and I can trade that relationship normalizing and there can be reasons why there's these kinks
4100.24s:  that emerge. But again, that's not so much attempting to trade what we would perceive as a mispricing
4106.88s:  but a relative pricing difference. And there's typically reasons why it exists. It's not risk-free.
4112.80s:  If you put on that trade that does not mean that the 17 vols are going to go up and that the 17
4118.48s:  and a half vols are going to go down. But it just means that, I think these are out of line and
4124.80s:  maybe I can run a play on it. And you can do that within the same expiration cycle. You can do that
4130.96s:  across expiration cycles. So in this case, if I throw on the 18 oct, I can see periods where they're
4137.84s:  inverted. So like here, I can see these 22s are actually more, they have more vol in 18 oct and less
4147.28s:  in 20 set. So in this case, I can buy the 20s in the cheaper and sell the 20 22s in the more
4157.68s:  expensive and I can trade a calendar in that sense to trade the relative vols between one another.
4163.60s:  Paul says, could you talk about order types? How to get the best possible fills? Yeah. The way you get
4168.80s:  the best possible fill is definitely through a market order, kidding. In case you guys just realize
4176.24s:  how serious that sounded. And I didn't smile, but definitely not through a market order. So the
4182.88s:  reason why market orders are really terrible is because it really focuses on speed of transaction
4191.12s:  as compared to getting best price. So market order is essentially, I want to get executed for whatever
4198.08s:  it is right now. So if I look at this 23 and it's bid 148 offered 160 and I just want to get a
4208.64s:  fill right now, right this second rather than using a limit order, I would use a market order.
4216.08s:  And that's just going to do it at the very next available transaction. That's a dangerous order.
4221.36s:  I have a great example of how it's dangerous. Today, I was trading zero DTE SPX options. They were
4227.84s:  in profit. So I had a stop market order. So in this case, if you do just a regular stop, you'll see
4237.12s:  that essentially once an option gets to a certain price, it turns into a market order. So I had a
4244.40s:  stop set, it hit my stop, and then I got the next fill. That was two times what the stop was,
4253.68s:  which is terrible. It's a terrible fill. But you have to understand and prioritize what your
4261.28s:  objective is because some people will say, oh, I want to do a stop limit. So if I look at a stop
4269.44s:  limit, that means once my trigger is hit, in this case, 160, I can say, well, I want to get filled
4277.20s:  at no worse than 170. Well, what if it goes past 170? Then what? Then you have a problem.
4287.84s:  You didn't get a fill. So this stop that is supposed to protect your risk from blowing out,
4294.32s:  you didn't get a fill. So now you wanted to get out at 160, it gapped past 160. It already went past
4302.16s:  170, which is where your limit was. And now it's at 190, then two, then two, 10, 260. It's at three,
4310.16s:  that three and a half. It's at four. This can happen in zero DTEs. This isn't even dramatic pricing.
4315.84s:  You literally can have an option that goes from $0.50 to $10. That's not insane.
4321.36s:  So if you're trading stuff like that, you have to be very thoughtful and you have to accept
4325.44s:  what you're doing. So in that case, I wasn't like, oh, what a unbelievable. I can't believe that
4330.96s:  this would ever happen. No exactly what happened. And it sucks. It happens sometimes. But I would
4337.52s:  rather control the risk. And more often than not with zero DTEs, it'll come right back in the range.
4343.92s:  The times that you'll get knocked out at those points is when they're typically is some sort of,
4349.04s:  you know, short-term extreme that then reverses. But it doesn't always. So then if you're trying to be,
4358.56s:  frugal, you don't want to waste a bunch of money. So then you're like, well, I'm going to use
4363.44s:  a stop limit because I think it's going to come back in anyways. There's a case where it doesn't
4369.44s:  come back in. And your stop limit stopped you from getting a fill on something that was supposed
4375.60s:  to manage your risk. And then that takes you out. So you have to just understand the order type
4382.40s:  into implications thereof. Alfonso says, the trade type that I wish was available on Schwab is a
4391.60s:  trailing stop. Oh, wait, what? I don't understand. It's literally right here.
4400.40s:  What are you talking about? You mean on the Schwab platform?
4410.32s:  Because Schwab owns think or swim. Think or swim is Schwab.
4419.68s:  This is for options. Exactly what I'm showing you. This is a trailing stop limit where
4426.48s:  if this wherever you choose to start it, well, let's do just a trailing stop standard.
4439.12s:  Yeah, the platform. Yeah. So because think or swim is owned by Schwab and you literally can do it
4443.20s:  right here. This is exactly what it shows you. So based on wherever you're at now, you can tell
4448.16s:  it plus or minus. You can give it only one direction. You can do it off of a percentage. You can do
4454.80s:  it off of like the plus or minus is a raw value. But yeah, you can absolutely use a trailing stop,
4460.48s:  a trailing stop limit. For sure. There's all different kinds of order types. There's
4468.72s:  M.O.C., which is if you're in the discord, you know, I use that most days when the market closes.
4474.00s:  That stands for market on close. Then there's TIF time and force. When do we want the order to go
4481.12s:  through? So day means the trading day. So that means that if your order doesn't get filled by the
4486.40s:  end of the trading day, then it gets canceled. Then down here, GTC stands for good to good till
4493.52s:  canceled, meaning it'll hang to the next day, to the next day, until it eventually is filled.
4499.68s:  They tend to have an expiration. I don't know how long it is, but it'll actually give you a heads-up
4504.24s:  when it comes up on the expiration of arresting order. If it's been waiting forever.
4511.44s:  And this is still just like a single order. You can do multiple orders. You can submit multiple
4516.56s:  orders at once. You can have one order that triggers a sequence of other orders. You can have one
4522.56s:  order that triggers a bunch of them. You can have order cancels other. You can have a bunch
4529.84s:  of different kinds of advanced order types. So yeah, there's a ton you can do with placing trades.
4537.28s:  The one thing I would say with that stuff is there's really value in keeping it as simple as
4543.44s:  possible, genuinely speaking. You're not really compensated super well for taking on increasing
4551.44s:  amounts of risk. And I'm sorry, increasing amounts of complexity, which does increase your risk.
4559.20s:  Because then your orders typically are not going to go through as well, stuff like that. So
4565.44s:  yeah, I think it's kind of smart to limit a little bit how complex you let things get so that
4571.68s:  your orders don't get hung up trying to run through.
4575.60s:  Alfonso says I use the web platform to trade because I use iPad from ability.
4579.20s:  Doc, just download toss for your iPad. I trade on toss on my phone.
4584.48s:  Like one of the places I place most of my trades because I'm moving around a lot.
4588.88s:  For me, like I don't really sit at the computer like hunting for trades. I mostly know what I'm
4594.88s:  going to do in a trading day the day before because I plan. So yeah, a lot of my trades are done
4600.80s:  on the phone because I know exactly what I'm looking for. But you can have you can have
4604.64s:  think or swim for your iPad, which I guess you can't see here. Maybe if yeah, there you go, iPad,
4609.92s:  or for your iPhone or whatever device.
4612.32s:  Policies. What do you do if a limit order takes too long to be filled? Change it. Stop being so cheap.
4620.48s:  So if in this case, I wanted to trade these 23s, they're 148 by 160. Maybe I'll start it to buy
4628.00s:  them. Maybe I'll start at the mid or maybe even better. I might start a little, a little south of
4632.88s:  the mid and I might offer them 152. See if I get filled. And then if I don't get filled, I'll
4637.52s:  literally come right back in right click, cancel replace, come back up, give it to them for
4641.84s:  154. That doesn't get filled. Come back, cancel replace, give it to them for 155, 156. Just walk the order
4648.72s:  up until you're at a price where you're like, yeah, okay, I don't like these actually at 160. So
4653.20s:  I'm not going to get them at 160. But I find very, very infrequently is the bit asks so wide,
4660.00s:  where by the time I'm done walking the order through, I'm now like, oh, I don't even want to do
4664.08s:  this. The only time that that really happens with any significant frequencies when I'm trying to
4668.96s:  fill box spreads. Box spreads can be tricky for that scenario for sure. But it's infrequent where
4679.12s:  it'll be like that bad. I just typically have to narrow down how much of a premium I'm getting
4686.56s:  over the relatively rate. Ape of trade says I use limit orders on zero DCS PX. I did better
4692.48s:  on my fills after I learned to quickly cancel replace also putting limits on for targeted entries.
4697.52s:  Yeah, that's it's a smart idea. And again, the only dangerous part is like I would be very careful
4703.28s:  with how you choose to do that on the profit taking side of things. But to put them on,
4712.96s:  especially something like SPX, I essentially have zero, zero problem with liquidity.
4718.64s:  Suppose Carson, how long do you wait to see if it fills before replacing it? That's really relative
4723.68s:  to how urgent it is for me to get in the trade. If I want to get in the trade right now, I literally
4728.80s:  just walk it all the way in. Submit it doesn't go cancel replace, submit it, cancel replace,
4734.72s:  submit it, cancel replace. I literally just walk it all the way up. If it's something that like a
4741.20s:  box spread, I'll let it sit for a little bit because there are complex orders that are typically
4746.80s:  in slightly less liquid periods of time. So I will let those take a little bit more time for sure.
4755.28s:  Evan flow says I use let me just grab the chat over here so that you guys can also see the chat.
4761.12s:  Well, I think you guys obviously you guys can see the chat. Maybe I don't know.
4767.60s:  Evan flow says I use a sell stop order for my take profits. Could you explain how a trailing
4773.84s:  stop of .15 would work if I've hit my profit target at one and want to trail it? Yeah. So then
4781.36s:  if assuming that you bought, if you bought your option, essentially it's going to take 0.15 off
4790.24s:  of the one. So it'll take you if the option hits 0.85, that's what it would let you sell it for.
4797.68s:  And then if the option goes from a dollar to a dollar five, then it's going to take 0.15 off
4804.80s:  the dollar five. So that means now your option if it doesn't change in value to the upside again,
4811.84s:  if it trails down to 90 cents is where you would get where it would be triggered. Now if it's a
4817.92s:  market order, that means that it's going to be filled at the next spot, which we don't know what
4822.96s:  it is. So in that case, it doesn't mean that you get filled at 85 or 90 cents in those two examples
4830.16s:  respectively. It just means that's when it's going to get triggered. And then it will run to,
4835.20s:  if it's a market order, if it's a limit order, it's going to bound it by whatever the limit is.
4840.80s:  So that's exactly how it works. It's nothing, nothing too complex.
4846.00s:  If you guys give me one second, I can let the pop out the pop out really fast. And then I can still
4853.92s:  hang out because I'm waiting for my food. Otherwise, if you guys are wrapping up, that's cool too. I
4858.64s:  was going to throw up a couple examples that's completely up to you guys. But let me let him out real
4862.72s:  fast. I'll be right back. I, we move quick around here. Cool. So let me grab. Oh, I already got
4888.56s:  rid of it. Never mind. That's my bust. I had a couple reddit posts that I was going to pull up for
4894.08s:  you guys that I think are good examples. Maybe we'll do that on the next one, because I was going to
4899.28s:  run you through like a couple just I think one of the really good things about stuff, like
4909.76s:  looking at Reddit and whatnot is to help you learn where other people are and to learn from
4915.12s:  other people. That's the way I think about it. But I killed all of them by accident. I have to add
4921.92s:  back my bad. Cool. All right, gang. Then that wraps me up. I will see the GME folks tomorrow for the
4929.60s:  GME live stream. If you have any friends that like to come to those or are interested in learning
4935.04s:  along me with GME, come on out. It'll be at 5 p.m. Pacific time. And then for the outlier
