0.00s: What is up outliers?
3.00s: Happy Friday and today we have options trading for beginners.
9.00s: On the agenda is going to be kind of a quick conversational quiz
15.00s: and then after our conversational quiz, I want to take a look at some case studies.
21.00s: But the conversation today is very open and did.
24.00s: This is kind of our first departure from a regimented series of topics, right?
29.00s: So this is part 11, episode 11, whatever we want to call it.
33.00s: Number 11.
36.00s: So I'm using this as a bit of a gauge to see where we're at.
42.00s: How people are feeling about options to kind of see where we're sitting.
48.00s: Because then I'm going to make another piece of curriculum for us that will go on,
53.00s: essentially for another nine episodes beyond this.
56.00s: So the way I'm looking at it is like the first 10 episodes we've done have been really
62.00s: designed to lay the foundation for the rest of this.
65.00s: And then my intention is going forward.
68.00s: I want us to continue building off of what we've learned so far.
73.00s: And then for newer traders that are just joining us in the series,
78.00s: you can essentially go back into what we've covered so far.
83.00s: And then you know, get kind of caught up with where we're at now and then go from there.
88.00s: So that's what I'm thinking today.
92.00s: And then for everybody's awareness tomorrow is going to be a GME live stream at 5 p.m. Pacific time.
101.00s: So we'll cover that kind of in detail tomorrow.
105.00s: So that's the upcoming agenda.
108.00s: Now in the meantime, while we're waiting for a couple of folks to trickle their way in,
112.00s: I have a couple more pictures from Alaska.
115.00s: I thought I would show you guys because I recently went on a trip there,
121.00s: flew the drone, had a bunch of fun.
123.00s: And so I'll kind of flip through some of these.
126.00s: I don't know which ones I showed you already and which ones I didn't.
129.00s: But I'll kind of like I said, I'll just blast through some of these so that you can kind of
134.00s: check out some of what we saw because we were kind of stunned by what we saw.
140.00s: This is all this big giant glacier area that we were hanging around and this is kind of like this trail that
146.00s: takes you up to this glacier.
148.00s: So there's a giant big ice field, essentially on the other side of this, which is really cool.
153.00s: And then if you guys haven't seen before, that's a close up of what it looks like kind of top down on a glacier,
159.00s: which I find the textures absolutely fascinating, which is why obviously I share this picture.
167.00s: I also like this one a lot.
169.00s: I don't know why.
170.00s: I think it's because of the mix of like live trees and dead trees, life and death.
174.00s: I don't know.
175.00s: Maybe I'm just super artistic and I don't know it.
177.00s: But I like that one a lot.
179.00s: And then I will show you guys this last one.
181.00s: I don't know if you've seen it, but that one I just thought was super cool.
185.00s: We just have this bald eagle, let net rip.
189.00s: And with this just super cool backdrop.
192.00s: So yeah, a couple photos for you guys.
194.00s: The the trip is overall sick.
196.00s: I do have a video of some of the helicopter ride that we went on.
200.00s: If you are ever interested in checking that out.
203.00s: But that's what I got for us so far.
207.00s: All right, gang.
209.00s: So let's get into the option side of the house first.
212.00s: We got to say hello to everybody.
214.00s: We got Liz Polo, Spaskar.
216.00s: That's kind of a fun name being Dooku Doki.
219.00s: That's another fun one.
220.00s: I like that.
222.00s: And being says, I remember you saying you sold your set.
227.00s: GME calls.
228.00s: You have a buyback in.
229.00s: Nope.
230.00s: So right now in GME for the option side of things.
235.00s: I'm actually quite limited.
237.00s: And I have some short calls against my long shares.
242.00s: But that's it.
243.00s: I don't have any directional GME options on right now.
246.00s: The way that I think about trading options is I need to
250.00s: move in and I don't put on directional options.
260.00s: You know, like buying long calls or kind of my standard go to sweet of
264.00s: strategies.
266.00s: And it's because they won't make money.
268.00s: I need to stock to move.
270.00s: And it's not moving right now.
272.00s: So the way that I think about that is as I see volume starting to come in.
279.00s: A little bit more meaningfully, then I'll happily start to trade it more
283.00s: speculatively, but I also wouldn't trade it before earnings at this point.
287.00s: Unless I wanted to trade it through earnings, which I don't have a good
290.00s: fingerprint for GME through earnings.
294.00s: It looks okay.
296.00s: Actually, I don't hate this through earnings.
298.00s: And then the times that it be big drop down.
304.00s: Yeah, like I don't hate this for earnings.
308.00s: So there might be an earnings play on the docket for GME.
312.00s: TBD.
313.00s: We'll see.
315.00s: There we go.
316.00s: I think I think I've rhyme that all the way out.
318.00s: Go me.
319.00s: We also have graveteris, John Tom and Colonel.
322.00s: Great.
323.00s: We got, we got everybody here.
324.00s: We have the whole gang in town ready to talk about.
328.00s: Option trading, which I love.
331.00s: So the way the session will work is I'm going to run through a couple.
335.00s: Really basic.
338.00s: Option's questions and I'm going to start with some simpler stuff.
343.00s: And then it's designed to be conversational, though.
346.00s: So I'm going to give you guys something that you can look at.
351.00s: And then actually, let me grab this so it'll be a little bit easier.
355.00s: I can pull some of the questions.
357.00s: These are all random questions that I've generated over time and different things.
361.00s: I'm going to grab a couple from here, but then I really want to spend time going through the platform.
365.00s: I'm going to be talking about things specific questions in here.
367.00s: It's not going to be super long.
369.00s: We might do like five or ten, but the main thing I want to work on in this with you is trying to
375.00s: continue to hone both the practical and the theoretical understanding of options.
385.00s: So that's the idea.
387.00s: This takes a minute because this workbook is becoming really, really, really large.
394.00s: It's actually taking even longer than I would expect.
397.00s: There we go.
398.00s: All right.
399.00s: So let's get this zoomed in and then close that out.
405.00s: Pull that up.
406.00s: This is one.
408.00s: Those are just a little to questions.
411.00s: All right.
412.00s: Here we go.
413.00s: So I will highlight the question part.
417.00s: It's going to be multiple choice.
418.00s: So you have the option.
420.00s: Check me out to literally just put in a letter.
423.00s: So it'll be a little easier for you to answer.
426.00s: Here is your first question.
436.00s: So when you know the answer, you could just drop it in the chat and you can just use a letter,
442.00s: which would make it kind of easy.
444.00s: And then we'll talk a little bit about the question itself.
449.00s: So the question here says an investor buys 10 XYZ.
454.00s: That's the stock may 70 calls at $3.10.
458.00s: When the stock is trading at 68.
463.00s: At expiration, the stock is now at 77.
467.00s: And the trader closes the position at intrinsic value.
471.00s: What is there?
473.00s: P and L.
477.00s: How funds are says is the image cropped?
479.00s: Yes, it is cropped.
480.00s: Oh, my bad.
481.00s: I see I got to move it over a little further.
482.00s: That's where you tell me.
483.00s: Hold on one second.
484.00s: Stand by.
485.00s: So let me see.
489.00s: That's too far.
491.00s: We need it to be right there.
495.00s: There you go.
499.00s: Recess 3.9.
504.00s: Tom says D, Recess changes to D, which is, again, the same.
508.00s: It's just making it easier for me because you know that I am an idiot.
512.00s: So that's I appreciate that.
514.00s: Recess keeping it keep it all super linear for my brain to handle it.
518.00s: Looks like Evan Floport fully will just show it up, which is great.
523.00s: CSY says what program do you use?
525.00s: It's think or swim.
526.00s: That's what you see in the background there.
530.00s: All right.
531.00s: Any other answers?
532.00s: We got too so far.
536.00s: Any, well, I guess I could phrase it this way.
538.00s: Are there any other answers meaning anything different than these?
544.00s: Liz also says D.
547.00s: Cool.
549.00s: So for anybody that didn't answer, so anybody that is not.
555.00s: Recess Tom Liz or Paula.
559.00s: For anybody that is not them.
561.00s: Ah, perfect.
562.00s: I'll find.
563.00s: So there we go.
564.00s: We always have to find one of them.
566.00s: So if Fondo is a brave answer, going against the crowd, I respect that.
570.00s: In this case, it was a terrible time to go against the crowd because you're 100% wrong.
574.00s: So let's focus on you, obviously.
577.00s: So I'll Fondo walk me through why you think it's A.
583.00s: And then simultaneously, John, the question is on the screen.
588.00s: If you're driving or something, I'll read it out again.
591.00s: The question is, in investor buys 10 of the XYZ may 70 calls for $3.10
598.00s: 3.1 when XYZ is at 68.
602.00s: At expiration, the stock is at 77 and the trader closes the position at intrinsic value.
608.00s: What's the P&L?
609.00s: So in case those were wondering, this is an a question.
612.00s: Even that I made up on my own, a lot of the questions that I like to grab are from like a
617.00s: Series 7 licensing exam, actual like legitimate exams so that you can see the kind of stuff that goes into that, which is hilarious, right?
625.00s: Because if you think from an option of trading perspective, that this is what we're obviously have to know this.
630.00s: So maybe it's like comic books, it's super basic, but this is from a Series 7 exam.
637.00s: So I'll find a walk me through why you think it's A.
642.00s: And then what I would love is simultaneously.
646.00s: Okay, here we go.
647.00s: I found this as purchase was $3,100 intrinsic was guessing seven and then I guessed.
654.00s: Okay, that's cool.
655.00s: That's totally cool.
656.00s: So let's grab our handy dandy whiteboard.
663.00s: And let me make sure I'm set up here to get my scribble on because that's what we're about to do.
669.00s: We're about to get our, this is my favorite part a chance to draw live because I'm known for my artistry.
676.00s: A gravitaria says so the 68 is irrelevant.
679.00s: It could have been any number in P&L is the same.
685.00s: Potentially.
690.00s: Carlos says need more info.
692.00s: Question makes no sense.
694.00s: The question makes total sense.
696.00s: So Carlos talked to me what info do you need to answer this?
700.00s: So what we need to know is intrinsic.
705.00s: And that's a,
710.00s: and that's a C verse extrinsic.
722.00s: So then.
724.00s: Ah, I see Carlos, it tells you.
727.00s: Close is the position at its intrinsic value.
731.00s: So that's what he closed the position at.
736.00s: Ramalama is here live and well.
738.00s: Ramas says, been trading spies your DTE for two weeks ended up today over a grand.
744.00s: I have to thank you.
745.00s: The content is invaluable so much more to learn, but certainly believe the possible to win consistently.
749.00s: That's awesome.
750.00s: First of all, congratulations.
751.00s: The second thing is I would highly encourage you to not worry so much about winning consistently, but winning long term.
757.00s: But yeah, that's awesome.
758.00s: I'm really, really stoked that your question at this huge.
761.00s: Ramalama says answer is D that is also correct.
766.00s: So Alfonzo is now doing the math.
770.00s: So if the stock is at $77 here, I guess you need another color to make that easier to see on sex.
781.00s: Stand by.
783.00s: So the stock is at 77.
787.00s: We have a strike at 70.
790.00s: We're essentially saying we're only looking at intrinsic value.
796.00s: It's giving you exactly what we care about.
799.00s: Intrinsic value.
800.00s: So we don't care about extrinsic value.
802.00s: So intrinsic value is Spanish for how far in the money.
814.00s: These are the same.
817.00s: So if we have our strike at 70, strike to 70, stock is 77.
832.00s: How far in the money is the call?
842.00s: So exactly as Alfonzo highlighted, this is how far in the money we are.
851.00s: Except we need to, we're trying to figure out what's the P&L profit and loss.
856.00s: So it's not just what's the intrinsic value.
859.00s: It's telling you that's where we're getting out at.
863.00s: But we need to take into account what the cost is.
867.00s: So you guys walked right on target.
870.00s: So that's exactly correct.
872.00s: We need to take the cost out of this, which results in letter D, which is the correct answer here.
880.00s: Bingo.
882.00s: Let's stop.
884.00s: All right.
885.00s: Next question.
886.00s: I'm going to add a group here.
889.00s: So that'll be a little easier.
897.00s: Does that one make sense?
898.00s: Is there really good on how we arrive at that?
901.00s: Okay. Good. So I'll fuck it.
903.00s: Delete it. Hold on.
904.00s: One second.
906.00s: One second. Here we go.
909.00s: Fanzo says intrinsic isn't to span is in a Spanish word.
912.00s: Oh, yes it is.
913.00s: Intrinsic is the direct translation in Espanol is how far in the money.
919.00s: Word for word verbatim.
920.00s: Take that to the bank.
921.00s: That's just science sealed and delivered.
925.00s: Obviously kidding.
929.00s: Toku Toki says, from where do you get the 7,000?
933.00s: It's a great question.
935.00s: So the way we get the 7,000 is we're seven dollars in the money.
942.00s: So we have 10 contracts from over here.
949.00s: Right?
950.00s: So our bot to open price is 10 contracts times the 100 multiplier.
960.00s: Times 3.1.
963.00s: So this is where we're getting 3,100.
968.00s: Then we have to do that same math over here.
971.00s: 10 contracts times our multiplier of 100 times 7.
976.00s: We're getting 7 bands for your boy.
981.00s: So this is what we ended up selling it for right here.
987.00s: This is what we bought it for.
990.00s: So our P&L is the net between these, which gives you
1001.00s: this one.
1005.00s: Okay cool.
1006.00s: It looks like Dokeu Doke is on board.
1009.00s: That's what we're looking for.
1010.00s: We're looking for everybody being on board the train.
1014.00s: Yeah, of course.
1015.00s: That's perfect.
1016.00s: That's exactly what we're looking to accomplish here.
1018.00s: So I'm glad it was helpful.
1019.00s: I will clean this one up.
1021.00s: Get it up out our way.
1023.00s: Add another layer.
1025.00s: Group this.
1030.00s: Minus commissions.
1031.00s: Yep.
1032.00s: That's exactly right.
1033.00s: So this is looking at an frictionless environment.
1036.00s: So in a frictionless environment, we're kind of just talking from a theoretical standpoint.
1040.00s: But John, you are literally 100% correct that we would in a real sense need to take commissions into the equation as well as spread.
1051.00s: If we wanted to be even kind of more precise to figure out what the total cost is.
1057.00s: That's exactly correct John.
1059.00s: And Carlis says, but don't you have to factor in the Greeks like Delta and Theta.
1064.00s: So Carlos, for you specifically.
1068.00s: Why do you think we need to integrate the Greeks like Delta and Theta when we're calculating the P and L of an option?
1078.00s: Walk me through why you think that's the case.
1080.00s: And then in the meantime, I'll grab something that I think might be helpful for us to look at together, which is Erics,
1088.00s: and Andy, I mean, this is really a bit of an abomination if we're being honest with ourselves.
1093.00s: Like this deck is so.
1096.00s: It's like it's pretty terrible.
1098.00s: It's all over the place.
1099.00s: I have just a random smattering of junk.
1102.00s: But I hope at least it's marginally useful.
1106.00s: That's the goal.
1107.00s: Also I need this to be like super precise.
1109.00s: Okay.
1110.00s: So let's grab this.
1111.00s: Let's grab this.
1113.00s: Carlos says, I don't know never mind.
1117.00s: Is that I don't know never mind because you don't know why or do you still think that those should be integrated, but you're just not sure why they're not.
1125.00s: Because if you're if you understand why they're not integrated, then I'll move on.
1130.00s: But if you're not sure why they're not integrated, then I'd like to continue the point to make sure you get it.
1143.00s: No, it was a bad question. No, it's like literally I'll tell you if it's a bad question.
1148.00s: I because there are bad questions, but bad questions are relative to kind of the person who's asking them.
1155.00s: So if you're new to options and that's a question you have, that's literally not a bad question at all.
1161.00s: Like that's a completely fair question to ask.
1164.00s: Yeah, so I'm in a similar boat as Sposcar.
1167.00s: Like, well, I disagree.
1169.00s: I think there's tons of bad questions, but I think that the bad question, again, like a question is relative to the person who's asking.
1176.00s: So if there's somebody that's new to something like a beginner, you really have is about a wide leeway gap as you can imagine for asking questions.
1185.00s: Now, if you guys saw there was a person that introduced themselves earlier in the chat name Tom A, if Tom A asked a dumb question, I'm a lot of no.
1196.00s: I'm a lot of no big time.
1198.00s: One because I know I'm personally, but two because he is more or less been around markets for a while.
1204.00s: So if he asked a question about something that I don't think he's reasonable for him to know about, meaning like, what's the disparity between stock XYZ and when we're plotting it's log normal distribution.
1220.00s: Explain why cartosis is actually a bad indicator for us to assimilate into a pricing model.
1229.00s: Like, I actually wouldn't expect Tom A to know that. So that's a fair question for his level.
1235.00s: But if you ask me some stupid shit, I'm going to tell him it's some stupid shit. So it's I view questions at the level of the person asking.
1243.00s: So if you're new to trading literally ask away, you have the utmost grace that you can be working with reset Eric with the Spanish again. Yeah, that's why I'm trying to tell you guys I'm like super fluent in Spanish.
1258.00s: I'm about to order Mexican food for dinner again. Like if that doesn't tell you how Spanish I am, I actually don't know what does.
1264.00s: I am essentially Spanish. I think.
1268.00s: I think there's a this. So for those that don't have it, I recommend grabbing a screenshot of this. So this is just a really quick reference for you to work off of and then actually let me write this out. So it's clear of all utility.
1288.00s: You can grab a screenshot of this. So the reason for Carlos that was wondering about the Greeks, the Greeks just measure things.
1298.00s: That's it. So Greeks are slave to options, not the other way around. So that's why the simple answer to that why don't we consider the Greeks in that piano calculation is because they literally don't matter.
1313.00s: We're at expiration and something calculating what essentially we paid versus what it's worth. These don't have a say in that.
1321.00s: And then the other one you guys can grab a screenshot of is this one, which is kind of like the, you know, the more comprehensive I have a YouTube video all about the Greeks. So I'll also grab that super fast for you in case you're looking to get into detail on the Greeks.
1341.00s: There you go.
1343.00s: And yeah, that that should get you a little more familiar, but yeah, that was a completely fine question.
1351.00s: I next question.
1355.00s: This one I'm actually really curious because this essentially has nothing to do with options, but it's again from a series seven exam. So I think it's a good question nonetheless. So this is more of a general market understanding.
1370.00s: The reason why I think this one is still relevant to us is because we need to understand these relationships. Again, like if you're going to be a trader. This is a still an important relationship that you have to know. So here we go.
1387.00s: See, it's wise as anyway, I can get that power point. So great question. It's a fair question, but no, there is no way because it's not done. That's going to be one of those power points that I'm going to work on. That's literally never going to be done because I'm going to keep building it.
1401.00s: So I don't feel comfortable filling something like sharing something that's super, super not done and that's not even close. So.
1410.00s: Yeah, there's that.
1412.00s: Right, here's our next question.
1414.00s: A US importer is buying 10 mil worth of goods from a Japanese manufacturer. It's very American of us.
1424.00s: The payment will be made six months from now in the Japanese yen to hedge.
1432.00s: What would the US importer do? Would they buy puts on the dollar by calls on the dollar by puts on the yen by calls on the yen.
1449.00s: Follow, it is not cut off. Don't try to gas light me. I already told you.
1454.00s: Mel recently explained to me what gas lighting is. So I am now gas light impervious. You can't you can't gas light me at this point because I know what the word means and I won't be fooled again.
1466.00s: A lot of seas.
1470.00s: So cravetarrist is running with D.
1476.00s: Evan flows D Willie Sposcar Tom Carlos C. Big ace opted to not tell me which one's left to look it up. That's annoying.
1489.00s: Put's in. Okay, see.
1492.00s: Liz says, see Willie says, see, recess. See Jason says, see, we are near unanimous. See.
1501.00s: Working investor comes in at sea.
1507.00s: Silent sleeper says, D. Good to see somebody bucking the majority. I always love that.
1514.00s: So I would love for gravittarist, Eb and Flow or silent sleeper to explain their answer because they are the minority.
1533.00s: Follow says D. John says B, the first B, I think I've seen. That's brave.
1542.00s: Gravittarist says, if N goes down, we get a discount.
1548.00s: And if N goes up, we get money on calls.
1554.00s: I like the logic. Can I get somebody from the sea cohort to explain why they think it's sea. So we have future whale.
1567.00s: Colonel, ape of trades, working investor Jason Rees, Willie Liz.
1574.00s: Future whale, there is no C or B. This is a single choice only exam.
1582.00s: Big A says US how to hedge it, not make money. Okay. Well, that that attempts to discount gravittarist's answer, but that doesn't explain your answer of C.
1598.00s: Rees says, hedge our payment in case N goes tits up. So think of that.
1606.00s: Buy puts on Japanese yen to hedge the risk of a decrease in N's value. Another fair guess.
1613.00s: So let's work through this logically. Again, this is more for you to understand how markets work than anything else.
1622.00s: The very first thing to know.
1628.00s: N says if N goes tits up, we win in the payment. So we would put on USD.
1637.00s: Negative.
1640.00s: Gravittarist says, I suppose I don't know the definition of hedging. hedging is simply to reduce risk.
1651.00s: But Tom says payment is being made in yen. So if the value of the yen goes down, then puts will hedge that risk.
1660.00s: This is fascinating.
1665.00s: Evan flows as if Japan is receiving the money of 10 million. I want to make money when they receive that. So I choose call. That's interesting.
1674.00s: So we have a couple instances of their correct, but for the wrong answer. So let's do that. Let's get through what's correct, what's not correct.
1689.00s: The very first thing is anything related to the US dollar we don't care about. We don't care about A, we don't care about B.
1699.00s: This is not what we're looking to hedge. This is essentially going to be a controlled based on whatever the US economy is. We don't care about this.
1711.00s: Our value risk comes from the yen. So now let's go a little bit further. If I am agreeing to buy 10 million US dollars worth of goods.
1728.00s: I'm going to give you 10 million dollars. That's US dollars is my side of the equation that's going to turn into yen. So I'm going to pay you in your your currency.
1741.00s: What's more dangerous to my position? If I go to give you one dollar and my one US dollar is only worth 50 yen or 50 cents.
1753.00s: I don't know what 50 cents yen is. Whatever that is 50 cents of yen.
1760.00s: Or if I go to give you my US dollar and it's worth 150 one point 50 yen, which scenarios better for me as a manufacturer.
1777.00s: A of trade says yen went up that becomes the problem. So if the yen increases in value, which means my one US dollar buys me less yen because the yen went up in value. That's my risk.
1796.00s: That's what's dangerous to me. So then out of C or D, which of those benefits me if the yen value goes up, which is the scenario that causes me damage.
1818.00s: A of trade says calls on yen would hedge. Then we're rolling in with the D's. That's exactly correct. John is good. Tom is good.
1825.00s: Paul says yen has no sense. That's actually really good to know. Thank you.
1829.00s: Doctors say it says D. Yeah, that's good. So again, the reason why this stuff matters is because you're starting to get an idea of how market participants engage in markets and what they're doing and why they're doing it. What their incentive structures are.
1848.00s: So that's why I thought this is a good question to work through. So I love this.
1855.00s: All right.
1859.00s: Any other residual questions on this one are we generally good.
1867.00s: Will he says don't understand totally cool. So let's let's try and let me see if I can help elucidate the point.
1877.00s: Gravitarius says was the reasoning I had correct. I don't remember what your reasoning was.
1883.00s: To be honest, if you repaste it, let me know.
1890.00s: Evan flow also is unsure and same as Reese. That's cool. Yeah. So let's let's get it. Let's get this down.
1899.00s: So pretend it's not 10 million. One of the easiest things you can do to help yourself kind of answer questions like this is just reduce all of the stuff down to its simplest terms.
1915.00s: So let's just say we're going to buy a dollar. Oh shit. That got stuck. Let's say we're going to buy a dollar US Jesus. Oh, I think my bracelet is hitting it.
1924.00s: So we're going to buy one US dollar of something.
1929.00s: And instead of it being six months from now again, don't even worry about how long it is think just future in the future.
1938.00s: Future in.
1943.00s: Now let's start with kind of a baseline. Let's say today.
1952.00s: One dollar US equals I don't know the yen symbol. I think it's like a Y with two lines through it, but I don't know where the lines are.
1962.00s: Well on Japanese yen symbol.
1967.00s: Okay, so like the bottom of the stem.
1972.00s: Okay, so today in this hypothetical example, one dollar equals one yen with just a Y with two lines through it.
1985.00s: So we'll take a pause here.
1988.00s: Four, who was it, Willie? Because you were the brave one to say that you were uncertain. So I'll work with you specifically. So Willie.
1996.00s: Does this first scenario make sense to you? Right now we're looking in a scenario where they're both equal to each other.
2006.00s: Okay, we'll's with us perfect. So now we have two potential scenarios in the future.
2016.00s: So then those up in value, meaning it becomes more expensive relative to the dollar or the yen declines in value.
2027.00s: And it becomes cheaper to the dollar.
2030.00s: So if the yen goes up in this case, our one US dollar is equivalent.
2041.00s: You guys told me there's no sense in yen, but there's going to be sense in this example to make it simple.
2047.00s: Is going to buy you half of one yen.
2051.00s: This is where the yen goes up.
2054.00s: In this example, again goes down.
2056.00s: So then your one US dollar now can buy you two yen.
2071.00s: Do these two scenarios make sense so far for you, Willie?
2077.00s: So what I'm highlighting is there's a scenario where the yen, the value of the yen relative to the dollar goes up.
2085.00s: Okay, cool.
2087.00s: So now, if originally my original guess was I wanted to pay one dollar for something.
2096.00s: In this scenario, this one dollar doesn't go as far.
2103.00s: So if I was going to buy one dollar and that gives me 10 widgets, let's say just to add another number.
2110.00s: 10 widgets, 10 things.
2113.00s: That's what I was originally expecting to get.
2116.00s: I was going to give them one dollar in this scenario from the starting point.
2119.00s: I was going to give them one dollar and I was going to get 10 widgets.
2122.00s: If the value of the yen goes up and now my one dollar is only worth half of a single yen.
2130.00s: That means when I give them my dollar, I'm only going to get five widgets.
2140.00s: Because the yen has become more expensive relative to the dollar.
2145.00s: So every time I give somebody my one US dollar, I get less stuff back.
2152.00s: Willie, does that scenario so far make sense?
2159.00s: So what I'm highlighting to you, okay, cool.
2164.00s: So now bring it home.
2167.00s: We're looking at how can we save ourselves from this risk.
2172.00s: If the value of the yen goes up, we can't get the same amount of shit or if we want to get the same amount of shit.
2180.00s: So in this case, we want to get our 10 widgets.
2183.00s: We're going to have to give them two dollars now.
2188.00s: So how can we protect our business deal and essentially make money if the yen goes up?
2198.00s: That's why we would want to buy calls.
2201.00s: Because the theory behind the, again, it's a theoretical position.
2207.00s: So in the theoretical position, if this scenario happens, and I still want my 10 widgets,
2215.00s: I have to pay instead of my one dollar two dollars for my 10 widgets.
2221.00s: So I have to come out of pocket more money.
2224.00s: However, if I made money as the yen goes up.
2229.00s: So instead of this doesn't change, this is going to be what I have to pay if the yen goes up.
2236.00s: But the addition with these long calls means I might make a dollar as the yen goes up.
2246.00s: So then that gives me the two dollars I need without having to put more money out of pocket to cover this variance.
2255.00s: Now for everybody else that's following along, this is a highly simplified example of what this actually, how this actually works.
2264.00s: Just to be abundantly clear. However, the part that I'm trying to express to you,
2270.00s: a, suppose car says, wouldn't you want to see if the calls cost more than the potential of USD to pay?
2282.00s: That starts to get into the theoretical positioning of things.
2286.00s: Because again, the purpose of the calls is to offset risk.
2291.00s: It's not because we're trying to bank if the yen goes up.
2295.00s: We simply want to make sure that we're going to be able to get our 10 widgets without having to add more than 10 million USD from our initial outlay.
2306.00s: So the purpose of the calls in this case, do you, to structure the trade again, they probably would use futures like it would be completely different than this.
2316.00s: But in the theoretical scenario, the idea is if you buy calls on the yen, you make money on the calls that then offset the additional rise in price in the devaluation of the dollar.
2333.00s: Well, he says, I see your point of appreciate taking the time to explain. Yeah, definitely.
2337.00s: So, the funds are says, borrow 10 million yen when you make the deal and pay it back in the end when you pay the supplier.
2344.00s: Yep. So there's obviously other ways to hedge the position. Again, you just take the question for what it is.
2352.00s: It's just teaching about the concept of using options to hedge.
2357.00s: You can change this from currencies to something else.
2360.00s: You can change it to a forward. It's just the concept that you should pay attention to here.
2365.00s: More importantly, the other takeaway that you should have from this is when we're using options around other things.
2374.00s: That's the main point.
2377.00s: Evan Flow says, I see that now because we're protecting our deal in the future, but we don't want to pay more than the agreed upon price.
2384.00s: Yep. The calls are insurance to protect our future price fluctuations. That's exactly right. Yep.
2391.00s: That's exactly correct. And the broader idea here is some people when I've given this question before they're like, well, why don't you just pay them today?
2399.00s: Well, why would I pay them today? If I don't have to pay them for six months, why would I give up six months of interest and pay them today?
2410.00s: This makes no sense. So while if I paid them today, it would absolutely lock in the value.
2419.00s: If I can put this $10 million into some sort of interest bearing account that I can then use to subsidize the cost of in this example, long calls, now essentially I have a hedge that subsidize via my original principle.
2436.00s: So again, it's just a general example designed to help connect a couple dots.
2442.00s: It's not a practical example of how this actually would work. This is not how it would go.
2447.00s: But this is how it goes.
2449.00s: Ape of space says, I wish you would use more bananas. That's fair. So instead of 10 widgets, we're buying 10 bananas.
2456.00s: I'm not sure why we would want to go to Japan to buy bananas. Maybe they have really good bananas or something, but maybe we just like exotic bananas. That could be what it is.
2467.00s: Cool. That's that question. We'll do one more of these.
2471.00s: And then we'll take a look at something else.
2479.00s: Elfonsa says there was almost zero interest on the yen free years. That's why people would borrow yen to finance other currencies. Yeah, absolutely.
2488.00s: And that's also why the carry trade was a thing for a long time, definitely. From again, actual real life example.
2496.00s: The yen was really interesting for that for quite a while. And even now, I mean, it's still at an astronomically low rate. So yeah, for sure.
2511.00s: All right.
2517.00s: Let's do.
2524.00s: Do we want an easy question or a hard question?
2528.00s: And then depending on the level of difficulty, we want all structures something for you.
2538.00s: All right. We want a hard question. We can do this.
2542.00s: Let me find something a little more interesting. Here we go.
2549.00s: Now, again, this is going to be hard relative to a new trader. Like, if you're an experienced trader, this question still is not hard at all.
2561.00s: Audiencing. My goal is not to stump people. My goal is to try to teach. So, oh, that'll stump you.
2572.00s: Explain to me what volatility term structure is.
2580.00s: This is different than a volatility surface.
2585.00s: So, walk me through what a volatility term structure is.
2597.00s: And it's okay. Take your time. Because I'm about to order some Mexican food.
2605.00s: Which is funny. Because I'm not really one of those Californians that really likes Mexican food.
2609.00s: I typically Mexican food is good, but I'm not like freaking out about it. I'm much prefer like Italian and stuff like that.
2618.00s: Recess no multiple choice. No. If you guys ask for a hard question, hard questions are not multiple choice.
2625.00s: Able space is too hard. This is, you guys are tripping.
2632.00s: Spouse car says the way.
2640.00s: You guys fucking crack me up, man. I love this. This is so fun.
2646.00s: Ivy over time. There we go. We're getting there.
2650.00s: That's so awesome.
2653.00s: Let me find.
2660.00s: That's not good enough.
2663.00s: Oh, see, that's some sea. I have to add this to my unfinished crappy deck.
2669.00s: Look at some GME.
2672.00s: Eight of trades has expected.
2674.00s: Val during option period. That's incorrect.
2677.00s: Gravitarius says different volatility for different dates. There we go. That's exactly correct.
2683.00s: So,
2686.00s: Recess GME is always the answer.
2691.00s: Whatever you need in answer, it's in GME.
2695.00s: It's awesome.
2699.00s: So, a volatility term structure, it simply tells us what volatility looks like over different timeframes.
2707.00s: That's all.
2708.00s: So, in this case, you can derive a volatility term structure directly from these numbers.
2714.00s: This right here.
2717.00s: So, for example, if I drew a line, let's just pick three of them.
2722.00s: There's 163,
2724.00s: 90,
2726.00s: and 85,
2728.00s: 163, 90, and 85.
2730.00s: I got to grab my note pad again.
2732.00s: I just slid it out of the way.
2737.00s: All right.
2738.00s: So, we have Val here,
2741.00s: which is 0.1.
2744.00s: So, this is like, let's just do like T0 or T1.
2747.00s: Let's do T2,
2749.00s: and then let's do T3.
2752.00s: And then,
2755.00s: here's the starting point.
2757.00s: These are just like ticks.
2759.00s: These are out in time.
2760.00s: So, then we had 169,
2763.00s: whatever it was,
2764.00s: this axis will be Val.
2767.00s: We had 169,
2769.00s: then we had like 90,
2772.00s: and then we had like 80,
2775.00s: five or whatever the fuck.
2777.00s: So, in this case,
2779.00s: this is your term structure.
2785.00s: So, in this case,
2787.00s: it's showing you,
2788.00s: what,
2789.00s: I just realized how terribly misaligned these are.
2795.00s: Just pretend that they're alive.
2797.00s: This one is so bad.
2801.00s: It's not even close.
2803.00s: Just pretend that they're alive.
2805.00s: This should be over here.
2806.00s: I reckon I lined like this.
2808.00s: But what I'm showing you is
2812.00s: volatility over different timeframes.
2814.00s: That's what term structure is.
2816.00s: And the reason why we care about term structure
2819.00s: is that it gives us ideas
2822.00s: on how much movement we expect a stock
2827.00s: to have in the future.
2829.00s: That's all implied volatility tells us.
2833.00s: It is expected movement.
2836.00s: So, for example,
2838.00s: if we come in here,
2840.00s: and I go to implied vault,
2843.00s: and then let's take a look at
2846.00s: the average,
2848.00s: and then let's get rid of a lot of these,
2850.00s: and let's just look at like the primary explorations.
2854.00s: So, if we use these are super confusing,
2858.00s: because it's game stop.
2860.00s: Normally, let's just use another product for now,
2862.00s: bear with me, because
2864.00s: it'll just be a lot easier to see
2866.00s: and something that's not as crazy.
2868.00s: Okay, apparently Apple is no better right now.
2872.00s: Let's pick maybe GE.
2874.00s: Yeah, this looks boring.
2877.00s: This is also, that's because of markets closed.
2880.00s: Anyways, if we use Spot Price,
2882.00s: which is right here,
2884.00s: this is another way to visualize
2888.00s: what I was literally just showing you.
2890.00s: So, in this case,
2892.00s: instead of looking at the monthly explorations
2896.00s: in the access I was showing you like this,
2899.00s: it's simply plotting different strikes,
2903.00s: not the just the monthly expiration,
2906.00s: but it's showing you the same exact thing.
2909.00s: So, we can see by the placement
2912.00s: of these lines relative to one another
2915.00s: for the at the money,
2917.00s: what explorations we expect to be more volatile than the others.
2922.00s: So, for this case,
2923.00s: we actually have 15-nove on top
2926.00s: of the 18-Oct on top of the 20-Sept.
2931.00s: So, this also would have a downward sloping
2936.00s: volatility term structure just like what I was just showing you.
2941.00s: So, that's what term structure is in this case.
2944.00s: Now, there's other things that you can add to this.
2948.00s: So, this is more of a volatility surface,
2951.00s: which there are different versions of that.
2953.00s: I don't know if I have one of those in here, do I?
2958.00s: Hmm, I don't think so.
2962.00s: Yeah, I don't.
2963.00s: So, let me add that to my deduolis, actually.
2966.00s: So, I'll add like,
2969.00s: volatility term structure and surface.
2978.00s: I'll add that into the deck for us.
2981.00s: But, without that,
2982.00s: this is just a way to visualize
2984.00s: volatility over different time periods.
2987.00s: It's why we care about it,
2989.00s: because our ability to understand
2991.00s: volatility over different time periods can tell us
2994.00s: where it's expensive on a relative basis,
2997.00s: where it's cheap on a relative basis.
3000.00s: So, recess of all smile is the term structure.
3005.00s: Smile in and of itself is a description
3009.00s: for a term structure,
3011.00s: because it's not always a smile, right?
3013.00s: So, in this case,
3016.00s: this front expiration is a smile.
3019.00s: So, this is looking just at the front expiration,
3023.00s: the 23-org.
3025.00s: And you can see just like when you smile,
3027.00s: right, your cheeks go up.
3029.00s: That's what this is showing you.
3030.00s: So, this is a smile,
3032.00s: but it's not always a smile.
3033.00s: So, sometimes it will be a different shape
3037.00s: like you see here.
3039.00s: This is like a fucked up smile.
3041.00s: This is a silly smile.
3044.00s: So, smile is a descriptor for a term structure.
3050.00s: Gravitary says does a smile imply bullish bearer sentiment
3057.00s: if they're skew?
3058.00s: So, if you'll remember from some of the OG GME videos I was doing
3063.00s: and even this right here, this is a representation of skew.
3067.00s: Now, you have to be really,
3069.00s: this starts getting into the weeds,
3071.00s: and I don't want to start going over people's heads here.
3073.00s: So, I'm going to gloss over this.
3075.00s: I'm happy to go further into detail on this
3077.00s: if anybody would like in the future.
3079.00s: I just don't want to overwhelm people.
3081.00s: Because this starts to get a little convoluted.
3083.00s: Because what you'll almost always notice
3086.00s: is the far out of the money options are going to have really high walls priced in.
3091.00s: And they tend to be really expensive for what they are.
3094.00s: That's a function of pricing models
3096.00s: and the way market makers perceive their risk.
3099.00s: I'll kind of leave that at that.
3101.00s: So, when we see skew,
3104.00s: we can't immediately assume
3108.00s: like right across the bat,
3110.00s: that if we see the call side higher than the put side
3114.00s: that that automatically thinks we think it's going up.
3117.00s: Because that can just mean we expect larger price movement
3121.00s: or we can expect more risk to the upside.
3124.00s: Some of it is going to be relative to the product you're looking for.
3127.00s: Or looking at.
3129.00s: More often than not,
3131.00s: if you see,
3133.00s: and this is an important point,
3135.00s: if you see the implied walls skewed for the same delta
3140.00s: or the same distance,
3142.00s: you can do either or so in this case spot prices about 20.
3146.00s: So, if I go to,
3148.00s: well, it's 22 technically.
3149.00s: So, I have to be a little more precise than that.
3151.00s: So, if it's 22,
3152.00s: and I want to go plus or minus 10 points,
3154.00s: I can look at what the wall is at 32,
3157.00s: and then I can take a look at what the wall is at 12.
3160.00s: So, if I go to 32,
3162.00s: my wall is like 113 for this front expiration.
3165.00s: If I go to 12,
3167.00s: my wall in this case is like 95.
3170.00s: So, I can tell you that the calls are being priced with more walls than the puts,
3175.00s: which is actually kind of backwards than what you typically would see.
3178.00s: You generally see the put side price heavier.
3181.00s: So, in this case,
3183.00s: the market is pricing in more volatility,
3186.00s: expected movement to the upside.
3188.00s: It's exactly what it's telling me.
3190.00s: It's why, again, if you go through the GME videos,
3192.00s: it's why I always look at this.
3194.00s: Because the market makers
3196.00s: is much as people like to make fun of them.
3198.00s: They're fucking smart.
3200.00s: They're smarter than I'll ever be.
3202.00s: And they're the ones that are pricing the walls.
3205.00s: So, you kind of have to take the walls
3207.00s: that they show you with a grain of salt sometimes,
3210.00s: and I do still price my own.
3212.00s: But they're going to have a much more informed opinion
3214.00s: over what they should be,
3215.00s: and I would go with market walls over Eric's walls any day of the week,
3218.00s: most of the time.
3220.00s: I can sometimes tell if it's kind of just a floating order of us.
3224.00s: I wouldn't call it a spoof.
3225.00s: That's more of a high frequency trading.
3227.00s: But market makers, to go a little further down the rabbit hole,
3230.00s: they don't always show the current actual expected volatility for something,
3236.00s: because then it shows their cards.
3238.00s: So, a lot of times they'll rest,
3240.00s: walls that aren't accurate.
3242.00s: And then if somebody starts entering the market,
3244.00s: they'll then adjust their walls to be more accurate.
3248.00s: They don't want to show all the other market makers
3250.00s: or other people that are making markets in that market.
3253.00s: What they think it is.
3255.00s: So,
3256.00s: Willie says they hire top talent, math majors,
3261.00s: they literally have armies of PhDs.
3264.00s: That's exactly why I say that they're super smart.
3267.00s: Anybody that thinks that they're not smart,
3270.00s: again, I get it.
3271.00s: It's sometimes fun to poke fun and stuff.
3273.00s: And nobody's omnipotent.
3275.00s: They're not smart.
3276.00s: They're not smart.
3277.00s: They're not smart.
3278.00s: They're not smart.
3279.00s: They're not smart.
3280.00s: But in general, they're really smart people.
3281.00s: And that's just a, I think it's an important understanding to have when we look at the markets.
3285.00s: The working investor says Tom Sauson off from tasty mention that meme stocks tend to have calls to you.
3290.00s: They do because people fear the squeeze.
3292.00s: They fear the upside.
3294.00s: It's exactly why they have calls to you.
3296.00s: Whereas if I look at something again,
3298.00s: let's take a look at GE.
3300.00s: It has puts you.
3301.00s: The puts go, it literally has higher walls.
3304.00s: It's a little bit more expensive on the put side.
3306.00s: This is way more normal than what you see.
3309.00s: This is an apple.
3310.00s: This is the put skew.
3312.00s: Most options, most products are priced more so to fear the downside.
3318.00s: But for things like game stop where you can see these hyperbolic upside moves,
3325.00s: there will be periods where we see these calls trade more expensively than the puts like this.
3332.00s: That's exactly what that's pricing.
3337.00s: Great discussion.
3338.00s: And I'm always happy to talk about all.
3340.00s: I think it's super important.
3342.00s: Re says that calls skew is from the market makers hedging and not from retail buying excessive calls or one in the same.
3348.00s: It's where they're pricing markets.
3351.00s: So it's not from market makers hedging and it's not necessarily from retail buying excessive calls.
3358.00s: Market makers decide they they're of a quote machine.
3363.00s: So think of it this way.
3364.00s: If I'm a market maker for a game stop, I need to determine what I want to price these at.
3371.00s: So these these 40 calls.
3375.00s: What do I want to price these at?
3377.00s: How do I determine that?
3379.00s: The way that they determine that is that they they're just looking at volatility.
3383.00s: That's the game.
3384.00s: So they're figuring out what they're best guess.
3387.00s: What they think what volatility makes sense for the product.
3392.00s: And that's one of the cool parts about efficient markets because if I'm a market maker,
3397.00s: the way I make money is by making markets is by gaining transactions.
3401.00s: Cool.
3402.00s: Now, if I make a market and the question might be, well, then why wouldn't they just always over estimate their volatility?
3412.00s: That would definitely pad them better.
3415.00s: It would make options more expensive and it would give them a better pad.
3419.00s: However, markets are competitive.
3422.00s: So if I'm padding my order too much and I'm pricing this right now,
3427.00s: it's running at 139.39% of all.
3431.00s: And I want to be super conservative.
3433.00s: So I want to pad the balls make them higher so that I have more room to work with if my ball estimate is wrong.
3440.00s: But there's other people.
3442.00s: And if there's other balls that are more accurate, they're going to undercut you and then you're not going to get the volume.
3449.00s: So that's one of the cool things about efficient markets is that market makers are really pushed to be more accurate in their calculations.
3457.00s: The other thing that people don't fully appreciate is that individual market makers,
3463.00s: their first job is to make markets.
3466.00s: Their second job is to control their risk.
3469.00s: So there's nothing that says I is the market maker must price these options at the best possible theoretical value.
3481.00s: If I already have a portfolio and based on market price action and something like game stop,
3488.00s: and I really don't want to buy more calls.
3492.00s: I don't want to buy more.
3494.00s: I can skew where I put my bid and offer.
3498.00s: I can skew the market by putting in different valls or by literally changing where I rest my market.
3506.00s: And it's not because they're trying to the fuck the retail trader, although it's not not because of that.
3512.00s: But what they're trying to do is control their risk.
3515.00s: So if because market makers are slave to order flow,
3519.00s: if order flows in one direction, they have to keep making markets.
3524.00s: So if it's one direction, they're not having an opportunity to offload any of their book.
3530.00s: I'm people are buying calls.
3533.00s: So all the way up, I'm selling calls, I'm selling calls, I'm selling calls, I'm selling calls,
3537.00s: which puts me short to stock.
3539.00s: I don't want to be short to stock.
3541.00s: But market flow is still one direction, one direction for whatever reason.
3545.00s: It's going super hard, one direction.
3547.00s: Gotta keep selling calls, selling calls, selling calls.
3550.00s: I don't want to sell anymore calls.
3552.00s: My risk is getting out of hand.
3554.00s: In order to hedge all of these short calls now,
3557.00s: I need to buy the shares.
3559.00s: The shares are hard to borrow, hard to locate.
3561.00s: Whatever the case is there, or I need to use other options.
3564.00s: But now volatility is starting to change and it's becoming more expensive for me to hold the position.
3569.00s: What market makers try to do is I'll sell the calls here and then the market moves a little bit.
3575.00s: And somebody else wants to sell there so then I'll buy them back somewhere else at a fair,
3579.00s: evolve value.
3580.00s: And then I'll make a little bit of money on that exchange.
3582.00s: That's what they prefer.
3583.00s: But if you get one side persisted order, that's really, really difficult in order for them to manage.
3589.00s: So that's why you'll see one skewed orders, right?
3596.00s: You'll see skewed resting orders while in this case is resting markets that they're offering you.
3604.00s: Because part of it is going to be based on their book.
3607.00s: If they don't want to sell any more calls, they might offer a better other side of that trade.
3615.00s: So in this case, they're going to look to buy calls from somebody.
3618.00s: So they might offer a better offer, a cheaper offer in a worse bid,
3624.00s: or whatever the case is, depending on their position, so that they can try to manage their risk.
3630.00s: So the other thing that they'll do is they'll change the vault to widen the markets out to slow down movement.
3636.00s: Because what is catastrophic is if a market maker who's a counterpart, he goes underwater,
3642.00s: and they still have to be cleared by OCC, that creates a giant problem.
3648.00s: So yeah, market makers have a really interesting place in the market.
3652.00s: And I think they do have some power.
3656.00s: They're not innocent people.
3658.00s: They're money hungry, like everybody else that's on Wall Street.
3661.00s: But they also don't have like these superpowers that I think a lot of people,
3666.00s: especially in like the ape and gma community, think that they have.
3670.00s: Because there's a lot of regulation that they have to maintain their quote machines for certain durations of time in order to maintain certain statuses in order to be granted order flow.
3681.00s: So for example, somebody has asked me before, well, if they don't want to sell any more calls,
3686.00s: why don't they just turn off their quote machine?
3688.00s: Well, they can, but then they can lose their status in their preferential treatment as a consistent market maker,
3695.00s: because what we don't want is directional market makers.
3698.00s: We don't want to give them the ability to turn their shit on when they want to make money and then turn it off and they're like,
3703.00s: okay, I'm good. I've made my money.
3705.00s: That creates an incentive essentially for them to start trading directionally.
3709.00s: We don't want that. So yeah, a little bit of a rabbit hole, but I think it's an important one for people to understand because I genuinely believe market makers are probably one of the more misunderstood entities that play in this whole ecosystem with us.
3724.00s: At least that's my opinion.
3730.00s: Any thoughts or questions on that?
3733.00s: What do you say? How do you put in different walls? They decide. So they again, like they literally have a quote machine.
3739.00s: So they'll have a volatility surface that estimates whatever they think volatility should be.
3745.00s: And then they literally input the metrics that they think apply to it with the risk free rate is all that stuff.
3751.00s: And then when they turn on their quote machine, that's what you see here. This is a market maker right here, resting orders.
3757.00s: And this can be to be clear. This can be retail traders. And I've seen it happen before. So for example, if I'm resting in order. Let's say that this 30 option is bid 57 offered 60.
3772.00s: If I wanted to offer a bid at 58 and there wasn't a counterparty at the time, this will move to 58.
3782.00s: The size offered will change. In this case, you can see somebody's doing that. It's 1 by 314. That means on the bid side, they're offering 1 at that price 57.
3795.00s: And they're offering 314 at the 60 on the offer side.
3801.00s: So this is a prime example of another way that market makers can skew what they're giving you. They can say, I'm tired of selling calls.
3809.00s: I don't want to sell anymore calls. So in this case, I'm going to give you one call at 57.
3816.00s: But if you want to buy them, I got a shit ton for you boss. Come on in. I have 314 locked and loaded to go at the 60.
3824.00s: So if you as a retail trader input an order that doesn't get filled right away. And it's better than what's currently offered that would narrow the market down.
3835.00s: Your order will sit there. You'll see it. You'll literally see it move.
3839.00s: And it's obviously easier to see on wider markets. But a lot of times we get filled really fast. So you don't actually have to deal with that too much.
3847.00s: But yeah, this is exactly what the size is showing you is what's being offered at those prices.
3856.00s: Cool. Yeah. I'm glad that that was useful for you guys. I think a res says we're too for an easy question.
3864.00s: All right. Fine. We can do an easy question.
3873.00s: What's the difference between implied and historic volatility?
3885.00s: That's pretty easy, I think.
3892.00s: Future first pass. Yep.
3895.00s: That's exactly right. Gravitarius has it spot on. That's exactly what it is.
3900.00s: So implied volatility is forward looking expected volatility.
3907.00s: And then historic volatility is what has happened in the past. It's exactly correct.
3914.00s: Now to confound things a little bit, there's kind of a world called realized volatility.
3923.00s: And realized volatility is really interesting.
3928.00s: I'm not going to go super far into detail in this because I think there's a pretty solid chance that it's going to freak a lot of people out.
3938.00s: So what I will do though is share a link with you on a video that goes into volatility.
3949.00s: So that it's a little more clear because you can have forecast volatility.
3956.00s: You can have realized volatility. You can have future realized volatility.
3963.00s: It can get a little confusing to that end. So we'll save that joy and wonder as experience for another time.
3973.00s: So that's good. You guys got that down. Cool. So now I thought what we could do is pivot and take a look at a couple case studies.
3981.00s: But this is also a perfect time. Whatever questions you have start throwing them in because I probably have maybe another 15 minutes or so.
3988.00s: And I would love to hit as much stuff as I can with you guys. Gravitary says you have videos on how to find incorrectly bargain price options.
3997.00s: There's not really a way to do that. I mean, realistically speaking, like the probability of you as a retail trader finding a mispriced option is almost null.
4007.00s: It's not zero, but the way you have to do that then is you have to find something where you think your volatility is priced better than the market volatility, which is real tricky because again, I told you when we look at market participants,
4026.00s: especially institutions, they're really smart. And most of the larger institutions have derivatives desks and market makers and pro firms. There's a lot of very serious committed traders to the markets where if you're trading options markets, a big part of your job is pricing volatility.
4044.00s: The concept of finding incorrectly priced options is predicated on somebody mispricing volatility. So unless you think you can price volatility better than market consensus, there's not really a way.
4062.00s: So we just have to try and ride the waves while the whales are making sort of to agree, like there's other things you can do though. So like for example, this kink right here in game stop, where I can see that this option here, which is what the 17 and a half is much higher than the 17s.
4083.00s: So I could come up with a relative value play. I could say I think the 17 walls are going to go up and I think the 17 half walls are going to go down.
4093.00s: And I can trade that relationship normalizing and there can be reasons why there's these kinks that emerge. But again, that's not so much attempting to trade what we would perceive as a mispricing, but a relative pricing difference.
4109.00s: And there's typically reasons why it exists. It's not risk free. If you put on that trade that does not mean that the 17 walls are going to go up and that the 17 and a half walls are going to go down.
4121.00s: But it just means that I think these are out of line and maybe I can run a play on it. And you can do that within the same expiration cycle. You could do that across expiration cycles. So in this case if I throw on the 18 oct. I can see periods where they're inverted. So like here I can see these 22s are actually more they have more vault in 18 oct and less in 20.
4148.68s: So in this case I can buy the 20s in the cheaper and sell the 20 22s in the more expensive and I can trade a calendar in that sense to trade their relative vaults between one another.
4163.68s: All of a sudden, could you talk about order types how to get the best possible fills yeah the way you get the best possible fill is definitely through a market order kidding.
4174.68s: Okay, so you guys I just realized how serious that sounded. And I didn't smile but definitely not through a market order.
4181.68s: So the reason why market orders are really terrible is because it really focuses on speed of transaction as compared to getting best price.
4193.68s: So market order is essentially I want to get executed for whatever it is right now. So if I look at this 23 and it's bid 148 offered 160 and I just want to get a fill right now.
4209.68s: Right this second rather than using a limit order I would use a market order and that's just going to do it at the very next available transaction.
4219.68s: That's a dangerous order. I have a great example of how it's dangerous today I was trading zero DTE SPX options they were in profit.
4228.68s: So I had a stop market order. So in this case if you do just a regular stop you'll see that essentially once an option gets to a certain price it turns into a market order.
4242.68s: So I had a stop set hit my stop and then I got the next fill that was two times what the stop was which is terrible.
4254.68s: It's a terrible fill but you have to understand and prioritize what your objective is because some people will say oh I want to do a stop limit.
4268.68s: So if I look at a stop limit that means once my trigger is hit in this case 160 I can say well I want to get filled at no worse than 170.
4280.68s: Well what if it goes past 170 then what then you have a problem you didn't get a fill.
4289.68s: So this stop that is supposed to protect your risk from blowing out you didn't get a fill.
4295.68s: So now you wanted to get out at 160 it gaped past 160 it already went past 170 which is where your limit was and now it's at 190 then 2 then 2 10 to 60 that's 3 that 3 and a half it's at 4 this can happen in zero DTE this isn't even dramatic pricing you literally can have an option that goes from 50 cents to 10 dollars like that's not insane.
4320.68s: So if you're trading stuff like that it'd be very thoughtful and you have to accept what you're doing so in that case I wasn't like oh what unbelievable can't believe that this would ever happen.
4332.68s: You know exactly what happened and it sucks it happens sometimes but I would rather control the risk and more often than not with zero DTE's it'll come right back in the range.
4343.68s: The times that you'll get knocked out at those points is when they're typically is some sort of you know short term extreme that then reverses but it doesn't always.
4354.68s: So then if you're trying to be you know frugal you don't want to waste a bunch of money.
4360.68s: So then you're like well I'm going to use the stop limit because I think it's going to come back in anyways.
4366.68s: There's it there's a case where it doesn't come back in and your stop limit stopped you from getting a fill on something that was supposed to manage your risk and then that takes you out.
4378.68s: So you have to just understand the the order type and the implications thereof.
4383.68s: I'll funds us as the tree type that I wish was available on Schwab is a trailing stop.
4393.68s: Oh wait what I don't understand it's literally right here.
4403.68s: We talk about.
4408.68s: You mean on the Schwab platform because Schwab owns think or swim think or swim is Schwab.
4419.68s: This is for options exactly what I'm showing you.
4423.68s: This is a trailing stop limit where if.
4429.68s: This wherever you choose to start it.
4432.68s: Well let's do just a trailing stop standard.
4438.68s: Yeah the platform yeah so because think or swim is owned by Schwab and you literally can do it right here.
4443.68s: This is exactly what it shows you so based on wherever you're at now you can tell a plus or minus you can give it only one direction.
4451.68s: You can do it off of a percentage you can do it off of like the plus or minus is a raw value but yeah you can absolutely use a trailing stop a trailing stop limit.
4462.68s: For sure.
4464.68s: There's all different kinds of order types.
4467.68s: There's MOC which is if you're in the discord you know I use that most days when the market closes that stands for market on close.
4476.68s: Then there's TIF time and force when do we want the order to go through so day means the trading day so that means that if your order doesn't get filled by the end of the trading day then it gets canceled.
4488.68s: Then down here GTC stands for good to good till canceled meaning it'll hang the next day to the next day until it eventually is filled.
4499.68s: They tend to have an expiration I don't know how long it is but it'll actually give you a heads up when it comes up on the expiration of arresting order if it's been you know like waiting forever.
4511.68s: And this is still just like a single order you can do multiple orders you can submit multiple orders have once you can have one order that triggers a sequence of other orders you can have one order that triggers a bunch of them.
4524.68s: You can have order cancels other you can have a bunch of different kinds of advanced order types so yeah there's a ton you can do with placing trades the one thing I would say with that stuff is.
4540.68s: There's there's really value in keeping it as simple as possible genuinely speaking like you're not really compensated super well for taking on increasing amounts of risk.
4554.68s: And I'm sorry increasing amounts of complexity which does increase your risk because then your orders typically are not going to go through as well stuff like that so.
4564.68s: Yeah, I think it's kind of smart to limit a little bit how complex you let things get so that your orders don't get hung up trying to run through.
4575.68s: I'll find those says I used the web platform to trade because I use iPad from ability dog just download toss for your iPad.
4581.68s: I trade on toss on my phone.
4583.68s: Like one of the places I place most of my trades because I'm moving around a lot.
4589.68s: For me, like I don't really sit at the computer like hunting for trades I mostly know what I'm going to do in a trading day the day before because I plan.
4597.68s: So yeah a lot of my trades are done on the phone because I know exactly what I'm looking for but you can have you can have think or swim for your iPad which I guess you can't see here maybe.
4607.68s: Yeah, they go iPad or for your iPhone or whatever device.
4615.68s: Policy is what do you do with the limit order takes too long to be filled change it stop being so cheap.
4620.68s: So if in this case I wanted to trade these 23s there were 148 by 160 maybe I'll start it to buy them maybe I'll start at the mid or maybe even better I might start a little a little south of the mid and I might offer them 150 to see if I get filled and then if I don't get filled I'll literally come right back in right click cancel replace come back up give it to them for 154.
4642.68s: That doesn't get filled come back cancel replace give it to them for 155.56 just walk the order up until you're at a price where you're like yeah okay I don't like these actually at one 60 so I'm not going to get them at one 60.
4654.68s: But I find very very infrequently is the bid asks so wide where by the time I'm done walking the order through I'm now like oh I don't even want to do this.
4664.68s: The only time that that really happens with any significant frequencies when I'm trying to fill box spreads.
4671.68s: Box spreads can be tricky for that for that scenario for sure but it's infrequent where it'll be like that bad.
4680.68s: I just typically have to narrow down how much of a premium I'm getting over the relative risk rewrite.
4688.68s: Ape of trade says I use limit orders on zero dtspx I did better on my fills after I learned to quickly cancel or place also putting limits on for targeted entries yeah that's it's a smart idea and again the only dangerous part is like I would be very careful with how you choose to do that on the profit taking side of things but.
4710.68s: To put them on especially something like SPX I essentially have zero zero problem with liquidity.
4717.68s: Suppose car says how long do you wait to see if it feels before replacing it that's really relative to how like how urgent it is for me to get in the trade like if I want to get in the trade right now I literally just walk it all the way in submit it doesn't go cancel or place submit it cancel or place I literally just walk it all the way up.
4738.68s: If it's something that like a like a box spread I'll let it sit for a little bit because their complex orders that are typically in slightly less liquid periods of time.
4749.68s: So I will let those take a little bit more time for sure.
4754.68s: Evan flow says I use let me just grab the chat over here so that you guys can also see the chat.
4760.68s: Why thank you guys obviously you guys can see the chat maybe I don't know.
4766.68s: Evan flow says I use a cell stop order for my take profits could you explain how a trailing stop of 0.15 would work if I've hit my profit target at one and want to trail it yeah so then if assuming that you bought.
4784.68s: If you bought your option essentially it's going to take 0.15 off of the one so it'll take you if the option hits 0.85 that's what it would let you sell it for and then if the option goes from a dollar to a dollar five then it's going to take 0.15 off the dollar five.
4805.68s: So that means now your option if it doesn't change and value to the upside again if it trails down the 90 cents is where you would get where it would be triggered now if it's a market order that means that it's going to be filled at the next spot which we don't know what it is.
4823.68s: So in that case it doesn't mean that you get filled at 85 or 90 cents and those two examples respectively it just means that's when it's going to get triggered and then it will run to if it's a market order if it's a limit order it's going to bound it by whatever the limit is.
4840.68s: So that's exactly how it works it's nothing nothing nothing too complex.
4847.68s: If you guys give me one second I can let the pop out the pop out really fast and then I can still hang out because I'm waiting for my food otherwise if you guys are you know wrapping up that's cool too.
4858.68s: I was going to throw up a couple examples that's completely up to you guys but let me let him out real fast to be a back.
4869.68s: I.
4878.68s: I we move quick around here.
4880.68s: Cool so.
4885.68s: Let me grab.
4887.68s: Oh I already got rid of it never mind.
4889.68s: That's my bust.
4891.68s: I had a couple reddit posts that I was going to pull up for you guys that I think are good examples maybe we'll do that on the next one.
4896.68s: Because I was going to run you through like a couple just I think one of the really good things about stuff.
4906.68s: Like.
4908.68s: Looking at Reddit and whatnot is to help you learn where other people are into learn from other people that's the way I think about it.
4917.68s: But I killed all of them by I have to act my bad.
4922.68s: Cool right game.
4925.68s: Then that wraps me up.
4927.68s: I will see the gme folks tomorrow for the gme live stream if you have any friends that like to come to those or are interested in learning along me with gme come on out it will be a five p.m.
