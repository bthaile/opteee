0.00s: things are heating up in GameStop. If you can see up here after hours, we're getting
7.14s: a little bit of a run. I don't want to be too hyperbolic. This isn't the end of days
11.80s: kind of move, but this is also not an insignificant kind of move. Like I continue to remind you,
16.92s: guys, my goal is not to spread hyperfied. It's to call it as best as I can see it. And
24.48s: you can see it being really active right now after hours.
29.04s: Most of the usual, it is hovering right around 29 and a half. It almost cracked 30. I'm
32.76s: not sure if it actually got above 30 or not. I wasn't following it the entire time,
37.20s: but it was really close. I was actually going to do this video when it broke above 30.
41.48s: And I haven't seen it do it yet, but maybe it will while we're on here, or maybe it
46.60s: already has, and it will again, who knows. But let's talk about what's going on in GameStop.
53.96s: The very first thing I notice is this drift continues, and it's accelerating, like pretty
59.78s: meaningfully. So we still have this term low on the first of July, and we've just been
63.98s: slowly rotating up and out just like this. The other thing that's important to note,
71.96s: take a look at our volume. It's expanding. And today, it's now above essentially a two
78.56s: week reference range. That's what this is. This is a two week average. And you can see
84.00s: we are now tracking up above it, which is not insignificant. And the majority of this
91.72s: is by volume, 20% of the volume today was sale volume. And yesterday it was a pretty
97.48s: light percentage of sale volume here as well. So there's buying going on. We can see that.
104.92s: We can also see this starting to rotate up. And there's a couple things that kind of
110.44s: line up really well here. I want to, as always, give a shout out to my friend Newton,
116.00s: who's, he does a tremendous amount of work on this thing. And he's like just so, so,
122.56s: so well versed on all the background. He and I have been talking at least touch and
126.96s: base most days, just sharing some ideas back and forth. And his sheet is really useful
133.16s: to kind of get an idea of some of these different timing components. And he does a great
139.32s: job keeping this thing up to date with things like XRT volume with things like FTDs, also
146.48s: with things like tracking creation. And this column here is actually really useful in
154.04s: case you're not paying attention to it. Because he's trying to forecast out what the
161.56s: price behavior in GameStop might be like predicated on all these different forces and cycles.
168.48s: And this is getting really interesting because there's a mix of things going on that I
172.96s: can see from the sheet. I don't want to pretend like I know anything about this anywhere
176.80s: near to the degree that he does. So he's the arbiter of truth. Go watch his stuff about
183.36s: this. It's fantastic. I just follow along with the two because I find it fascinating.
188.92s: The punchline as far as I see it right now is there are some interesting relationships
194.40s: going on with respect to FTD cycles and redemption cycles that seem to be feeding into some
201.28s: of the price activity that we're seeing. Now getting back closer to my sphere, which
207.40s: is options. Here's what we got going on. Huge call volume today. As let me open this
212.88s: up to encapsulate all strikes, you'll see that there is 344,000 calls traded today against
220.28s: 89,500 puts. So massive call skew in terms of OI. I mean, in terms of volume, sorry, to
229.44s: be specific. Actually, I bet you it's in terms of OI as well. Let's take a look. Also in terms
234.44s: of OI, not anywhere near is extreme though, because we're looking at 891,000 calls to 5,000
241.76s: or I'm sorry, 500,000 puts. So it's still a pretty big call skew, but not quite as much
248.36s: in OI as volume is we take a look across these explorations. The lions share this 344,000
256.84s: lives in this front expiration. It's crazy. 214,500 all for this week. case you guys didn't
264.20s: know it's Tuesday. Got a couple days left here three days. It's not necessarily a ton
269.80s: of time. Ah, great. Those short calls are in the money. As I was actually talking to
274.16s: some folks in the discord, really all we needed was me to offer some short options against
280.36s: my long options in long stocks in order to get the rally effort. Got right. That's how
284.72s: the market is. No matter what you put on, it'll find a way to make you wrong. So I mean,
289.52s: honestly, I should apologize to everybody because all I needed to do was to add some
295.64s: short options against the long deltas and then obviously it would rip my face off. Why
300.48s: wouldn't it? Why wouldn't it do that? And it's doing it. So my bad for not just doing that
306.32s: earlier, I forgot that that's all I needed to do. And the fun part is if I would have
312.16s: just left long options on, we all know this would be a completely different video about
316.20s: how for whatever reason GameStop was getting punished to the downside and all my long deltas
320.80s: were worth nothing. You know, that's just how it goes in this business. So anyways, they
327.04s: are in the money. We're going to have to figure that out a couple days. That's a future
329.72s: Eric problem. Can't worry about everything at once. Here's what we need to look at. This
334.44s: right here is very topical, very topical, 73,900 open interest at these 30s, 57,647,
349.50s: volume on these big volume. If these fall in the money, this gets real interesting, real
362.26s: fast. Even this after hours move that we're starting to see gets interesting. The reason
368.50s: why this gets interesting is as these get closer to falling in the money, which they
373.14s: are right now as we're talking, as you can see up here, as these get closer and closer
377.66s: to falling in the money, market makers have to do something with their position to hedge
381.38s: their risk in the event that these are in the money come expiration because then they're
386.30s: on tap to start delivering shares. So that means that they need to find them somewhere.
391.46s: So if that does start to happen, that likely will lead to some sort of buying pressure on
397.90s: GME. How high does it launch from there? It really depends on how many people scale into
402.06s: this because there's a lot of weakness after this strike. Like again, let's just keep
405.82s: it a buck. After the 30s, the 30 and a halves are dry. The 31s are small. The 31 and
412.72s: a halves are dry. The 32s start to offer something, but still not a ton. 33s are light,
420.02s: 34s are light. It doesn't start getting bigger until the 35s. So it would need to find
426.74s: a pretty big breath of fresh air and have enough wind of its back. Even if it does fall
432.50s: into the 30s for all of that buying pressure to move us five points from 30 to 35 can
436.90s: happen. Absolutely can happen. Want to be clear about that. But it wouldn't necessarily
441.94s: be quite as simple as this buying volume. If these do fall in the money immediately
447.50s: means we go there, it probably would require a little bit broader participation and stuff
453.06s: like that. We'll have to see. So the other thing I want to look at super fast is the volatility
458.34s: here. So let me open up all series. We're going to take a look at the implied volatility.
462.30s: We're going to look at the out of the money as per usual. And interestingly enough, I'm
467.74s: going to kill it to just these two so it's a little less noisy. Notice all these kinks
471.46s: showing up. That happens when there's a big change in volatility. When the market is
476.06s: trying to synthesize new information, new data coming out, new behaviors, you'll see
482.06s: this happen right here. And this is pretty interesting because again, as I always say,
488.54s: it's tradable. But more importantly than that, as we typically see, the put side is growing
493.06s: pretty massively as per usual. And the call side is expanding, but not quite to the
498.90s: same degree. And from an expiration cycle, these two are popping a lot. This is now broke
505.02s: above 200%. This is broke above 175%. But if I'm not mistaken, looking out to something
512.78s: like the 26 July, these look pretty quiet. Well, the call side has huge implied volatility,
522.98s: but that's not what I was looking at. I wanted to talk about the open interest. Yeah, 77,000
528.46s: to 28. So they're there, but it's lighter. These op-x weeks are really important because
534.10s: these are way more liquid. And this is where a lot of activity is going down. And we don't
539.26s: have another big opportunity here until 16 August, which is 31 days away from here. If
544.54s: we take a look at the OI for 16 August 162 K versus 89. So already positions being built
551.34s: there, but not necessarily huge, huge positions just yet. So a lot of volume today, a lot of
559.18s: it centered in the 19 July people are getting very, very active out here with like 19 July
563.90s: 30s. Like I said, 57,000 of those came through today. So if we take a look at these 19 July 32
571.42s: calls, 3,000 of those came through at 98 cents, not a massive position, but not an insignificant
578.78s: position to kind of help people see this more clearly. People tend to see this side a little
584.22s: better, which is totally understandable. I get that. Let me get rid of these puts. We're just
589.34s: going to look at the call side coming in at the offer or above. And we can see 571,000
599.98s: dollar trade came on for the nine August expiration. So this is a little further out. 16 August
608.06s: still getting hit. October 18th getting hit. 26 July getting hit. So there's a lot of this bigger
614.70s: exposure being added in these further explorations. So as I limit this to this coming expiration cycle,
621.82s: it's not as active, which I find a little interesting to be honest with you. I would have
627.42s: expected with the price movement we've been seeing the last few days to see more people coming
631.10s: into these near term explorations, but this also does line up with some of the redemption cycles
637.18s: and the delivery cycles that we've been discussing on the Saturday live streams with Newton,
643.34s: which we have another one this coming Saturday. Don't forget to tune in. It's already up on the
647.34s: channel for you to go check out and set an alert for when it launches. But I would have expected to
652.46s: see more of this in these near term explorations, but they're all over the place. People are building
657.02s: positions out, which is still, I mean, there's a lot of money here, right? All the way down here is
662.54s: the first, the first cycle that's less than a hundred thousand dollars. So essentially this entire
668.06s: page almost is over a hundred thousand dollar trades. This is completely different than what we've
673.02s: been seeing lately. Again, like if I go back to the ninth of last week and we take a look there,
680.22s: we had one trade that was 200k, everything else, sub 100,000, the vast majority in 30 and 20,000.
687.26s: Who cares about that? You know, just peasant money over there. We active out here on the 16th now,
695.58s: looking at millies being thrown around between these two positions right here, you have a million
699.58s: bucks. And then you probably have another million in change in this series. So there's money coming
706.54s: into this thing, which is very exciting to watch. Now, a little bit early, I think to read too far
713.18s: into it because a lot of things need to align in order for this to really start accelerating. But
718.38s: I think a big, big part that will be useful to see is the redemption cycle coming up in the
723.02s: creation cycle and how that impacts the underlying. We see these building out more. So the 30s out in
731.74s: 16 aug 2400 contracts were added net over yesterday with another 50 hundred volume today out here
739.90s: at the 40s. There's 12,000, oh, I 1500 added 3677 volume today. So people are scaling into these
747.90s: positions like that's very, very clear to me. And it's centralized in the standard
753.74s: expiration cycles 19 July 16 August. That's where most of this stuff are. As you guys can tell,
758.62s: I tend to put my positions a little further out. I took the 18 October is down today because they
763.58s: showed a sizeable profits. I went very deep in the money. I had those for a while now as you
768.86s: can tell I'm not using the pass through account for this one mostly because I wanted to make the joke
773.02s: about this. Hey, we don't like that. These were deeper in the money before. Boo, boo,
778.94s: Wendy, these 29 and a half's need. I want this to be buried. I want these shorts to be so far in
784.46s: the money that they get exercised early and it causes a massive problem for me. That's what I want.
789.90s: Mostly for you guys, it would be a giant headache for me if those get exercised early. If you're
793.82s: on the other side of those calls, do me a solid. Don't exercise those please. Just let me close
797.50s: them out if you would be so kind because I'm not trying to deal with being short
802.38s: game stop. Short shares on game stop is I mean, I have the I have long shares to offset it,
807.18s: but I want those shares. I don't want those to get taken away. So whoever's out there on the other
811.02s: side of these 29's whoever bought the 29's just chill. If you would be so kind, let me close this
816.54s: out and then feel free. Go haywire, go crazy, exercise till your heart's content. Just let your
821.74s: boy get out of this. I mean, look, hook a homie up, would you? All right. I am pretty excited.
829.50s: I'm excited to see where this goes. I'm excited to see this after hours movement. It's not
833.18s: insignificant. We need to keep a close eye on things. I see volume expanding. It's difficult to see
839.42s: this isn't a log chart. So this kind of skews stuff so much. It makes this look really, really
843.98s: compressed, but it's not like if we move into something that's much closer. This is a five day
849.10s: five minute chart just to give a different sense of magnitude. This thing has been running for some
853.66s: time now. So I am eager to see where it goes from here. You can see where my alerts are set to
859.50s: the downside where I would be reconsidering the position slash adjusting my long deltas to make
864.94s: sure I'm not stock holding again. It's different with options. They're decaying assets. So I can't just
869.98s: hold options if the market's going against me because then I'm just bleeding money everywhere.
875.98s: That's not the idea of believe it or not in the business. The idea is to attempt to make money.
880.62s: So that's what we're working towards. Maybe we'll see. As always, if there's any questions,
884.86s: anything you want me to take a look at, let me know be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
