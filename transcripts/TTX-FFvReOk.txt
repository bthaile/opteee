0.00s: What's up, outliers? Quick market update will run through the indices. Then we'll take
4.88s: a quick look at what happened today. And then I'm going to pivot over to GameStop ahead
10.20s: of our GameStop live stream tonight at 5 p.m. Pacific time. So if you want to come,
15.10s: hang out, get a little weird, get a little deeper into GameStop. That's where that will
18.52s: happen. But in the meantime, let's take a look at these markets. So you can already see,
23.80s: as I'm hovering over the Russell, it had a massive down day. So did the NASDAQ, so
29.70s: did the E-minis. We saw the S&P 500 percentage of stocks above the 50 day moving average crater.
37.44s: We saw bonds have a pretty good day and we saw VIX actually pop above 18 for a little
43.18s: while, which is kind of an important thing because VIX is been a very reliable steady trade
49.66s: this year. And it's been very static, meaning we're not seeing these really drastic extremes.
55.38s: But whenever I see it up at these levels, I'm fading it. And it's just because it has
61.16s: very seldomly remained above here for all too long, although it can volatility does cluster.
67.30s: But this has been a great trade so far this year. Essentially anything above 17 becomes
71.44s: interesting scaling and above 18, 19. That's that's all right. Now I do want to take a look
77.88s: at the futures really quick futures are open right now. So the E-minis are down a little
81.62s: bit more. The Russell's about unchanged in the NASDAQ is down about half a point. Taking
86.14s: look specifically at the Russell, because I have some short puts on in there, I've scaled
92.54s: the trade down massively funny enough. I seem to have a really random habit of doing this
99.42s: with Russell. But the last couple days I actually had a much bigger position on that I was
103.90s: scaling out as we were kind of trending sideways here. You can see that we're baking in a little
109.26s: bit of a top. And that's okay, because we need consolidation. It's healthy for the index
116.02s: for the underlying, but things are a little different this time. One thing I noticed
120.14s: is that the CCI is now turned negative, which is just a momentum indicator. It's an oscillator.
126.66s: But I have pretty good success with it. I like this one. I tinker with a lot of them,
131.24s: but really when I want to draw your eye to down here is the net highs lows. So we see net
136.18s: highs lows is now turned negative for sure, actually a little deeper than the last negative
140.94s: we saw over here. But take a look at the difference in the quality. So as I hover here, net highs
146.14s: lows was negative 51. Today it's negative 69 giga. It's not that different, but take a
151.42s: look at the difference in these days. Here's where the other red day was. Here's what it is now.
156.34s: And again, this is for the NASDAQ. It's not fully representative of what you're going to see
159.54s: in the Russell. But this gives you a pretty good idea of what's going on. And we see highs
165.18s: collapsing and we see lows expanding. So I don't actually love this configuration. If we take a
172.06s: look at these other periods where we start to see these transitions, these transition days can
177.26s: be kind of heavy one way or the other to the upside of the downside. So it's something I'm keeping
182.62s: an eye on. But the way I think about it now is brought in disease. I am being careful with risk.
190.78s: I'm not overly allocated or utilized right now. Most of the cash I have is kind of being transferred
197.10s: over into more of a holding pattern for at least till it needs not to be. I will maintain some
203.66s: exposure as per usual, just because you never know when things are going to grab some light and
207.34s: start moving. But right now things are slowing down. So what is the cause of this? What happened?
212.30s: Well, first I want to be very clear that people really like to oversimplify things in markets.
218.22s: And we like to have these really neat, tidy little descriptors of what happened. Right? Why did
223.18s: X happen? And a bunch of things happen today. Now nobody ever fully knows why everything goes the
229.82s: way it goes in the market, typically unless there's a massive catalyst. I just like to call that out
233.98s: because getting into the news cycle of listening to CNBC or these other news sources say, oh, the S&P 500
241.10s: is down because of this. It's probably partially because of that. But then you also notice that the
245.90s: next day it'll be up because of a similar thing. So you just have to be careful. Otherwise, if you
250.46s: get into this habit of these really neat succinct explanations for everything, you start to oversimplify
255.98s: it just as a heuristic and you miss a lot of details. Now if I were to pinpoint though the primary
261.82s: drivers for the movement today, it's this right here. I think job jobless claims came in very hot.
269.18s: And this is really important because it's seen as a form of broad stock market weakness.
276.62s: And this is important because we've been in this really high inflation period for so long.
281.18s: And we've been at a point now where rates have been held up for quite some time. That puts a lot
286.46s: of pressure on small companies, specifically small caps, typically everybody, but specifically small
292.22s: caps. And as this continues, you get to a point where you're wondering when things are going to break.
299.66s: When can they no longer sustain viable operation? When do they have to start laying people off in
306.06s: order for this to continue to be economically viable for them? And this all feeds into the fed rate
311.26s: decision because the fed in the previous meeting said that they're not putting rates. And for the
317.74s: last meeting and the market didn't care, that's what we expected to see. But if we take a look at
322.46s: what the markets expectations are for September, it is that a cut is coming. So now the question
327.42s: becomes how big of a cut and notice the change yesterday, it was an 88% probability of a quarter
335.50s: point cut. Today, after that came out, that dropped literally 10 points. And we now have a 22%
343.26s: probability of a 50 basis point cut. Why is that? Because the market is starting to see weakness.
350.54s: And if this persists for too long, it's important to remember that there's leads and lags to all of
355.98s: this. So if this continues at this rate, it puts the market in a compromised position moving forward.
361.74s: So that's why in my opinion, a primary driver of this was the unemployment metric coming out and
369.26s: being much higher than pretty much everybody expected it to be. So this will likely be an important
375.90s: data point for big daddy J pound his decision on what he wants to do with rates. All right, so now let's
380.62s: talk about GameStop quickly. And it's because this trend is assuming. So again, this is I talked about
388.54s: this yesterday. This is not surprising to me. I don't want it to do this, but this is what it's
393.66s: doing regardless of what I want. Shocker. The market is not listening to my wishes. It's
398.22s: unbelievable, really. And to me, we're getting close to this first stop as I see it at least,
404.14s: which is this 2098 slash 21-ish handle. Again, I always think it's important to remind people,
410.62s: GameStop is one of those really unique beasts where when it decides not to follow standard pricing
416.54s: behavior, it doesn't. Right? When you see things go through these kinds of cycles, this is not
421.58s: standard pricing behavior. So even though that this is in a very standard descending trend line,
427.42s: if I put a linear regression best fit line on it, it's going to be descending from this point.
432.30s: The thing is as soon as there's some sort of catalyst that turns it around, it'll shoot right up.
438.22s: Like this. So it's an important point because I always have to remind myself as I'm looking at
443.42s: this product, you can always apply technical analysis to things. It's simply observing behavior
449.90s: of market participants and their conviction with how they choose to buy and sell. Now with that,
455.50s: you can read into it a lot and you can determine standardized patterns, behaviors, and extrapolate
459.82s: that across a broader data set. You can't really do that as well with GameStop. I run studies on
466.38s: all the different kinds of studies I like to use. You'll notice that I switch between them sometimes
470.54s: based on what I'm kind of flagging is working really well at a given point in time in a current
475.10s: market condition. And GameStop fails them all the time when you kind of want the most.
479.98s: So what I mean by that is during this less volatile period going back in here, you can come up with
486.38s: some pretty good ideas of standard technical analysis. But even these kinds of really big moves,
492.46s: you don't, it's really difficult to pinpoint the pivot. So that's okay. That's kind of what makes
499.26s: it special. And that's why I like using options also to just use it as an amplifying function of
505.58s: determining price behavior. So what are we seeing here? Downtrends continuing. I still think 21 is
511.58s: very likely on the horizon. Hopefully not. But what makes me say that is I'm seeing the buy volume
517.90s: continue here. Right. So you can see essentially coming back to 26 July, we've had buy volume, I'm
524.62s: sorry, sell volume on a daily basis coming in above 90% every single day. So there's just people
532.14s: selling and there's a lot of people selling here. Why? Who knows? And you can see that the point
537.74s: of control is now up here. I imagine for a lot of people, there's fear about getting stuck in the
543.42s: stock at 20 when it's spent a long time below 10. Now that still doesn't seem like the floor to me.
551.74s: We've had a couple conversations about this. It looks like after this 21 handle where I'm pricing
557.02s: it off of this node, it looks like the next next node is here at like 15. You can see it right in
562.62s: there. So I'm just referencing where people previously transacted with the underlying, but you can
567.90s: see another node building right here in the 17 handle 1771. So there's a good chance that buyers will
575.58s: continue to step in down here as well. But we are getting into a later volume area. And all that
580.78s: means is price becomes more loose in those zones. It means that there's not enough not as much
587.58s: support or resistance. That's why price bounces around and these kinds of things very quickly.
591.90s: Right. As you see, price like this, making these kind of moves. Look how light that volume is.
596.86s: But it's just flying through this. And it's because there's not much support or resistance to
601.98s: slow it down. And you'll see that when there is a lot more support and resistance that's built out
607.42s: over time due to heavy volume, price becomes sticky around those points until it starts traversing
613.42s: above or below. And in this case, we're dripping traversing below this most recent point of control.
620.06s: So let's take a look now at the options. I'm seeing 701,000 calls against 388,000 puts. So again,
628.78s: this is not the most bullish configuration I've seen for this product specifically. I'm seeing
635.10s: continued build out in 16 August. I've said that multiple times now. But on the call side,
639.98s: that's where most of the volume is starting to dump in. Now what I do want to show you,
643.82s: this is total li across all the options. Change. Check. Take a look at these. This is in 17,
649.02s: Jan 25. So we have some pretty long expiration starting to pop up 17, Jan 25. Again, the 125. So
656.06s: there's already 20,000 of those. If we look across the current strikes for calls where the most
661.10s: li is, this is essentially tied for third. So there's a massive amount of options being built out
670.30s: in these longer term explorations. And they're creeping up, which is really interesting. Even this
675.74s: expiration cycle, which is the 18 October 24, right? That's 78 days out. So that's interesting to see.
681.98s: And this is something I've been talking about where it feels like we continue to have so much
686.70s: centralization in these near term explorations. But it's actually starting to slide out a little
691.90s: bit into the next primary expiration and then even further out than that. So what does that tell me
696.70s: from an options perspective? It just looks like the market is being priced in for a more mellow
704.86s: two weeks. And I've said that before, I can I'm just reiterating that sentiment as far as I can see.
710.14s: Now sometimes people will say that I say a lot of stuff in the video, but not there's nothing
714.70s: that they can pull out. So I'm trying to make it more clear. I try to avoid that typically because I
718.86s: want people to come to their own conclusions. But for those that are unfamiliar with like how to
723.98s: take the information I'm saying and decipher it into or I guess interpret it not really decipher.
728.62s: It's pretty clear in my opinion, but to turn it into usable information, I'm trying to specifically
733.42s: call those out for you guys. So here in 16 aug, this is where things are the busiest next. And it's
742.38s: not crazy for the at the monies. So the 21 and a half are very light. The 22s are a little bit
748.78s: busier, but you can see out here at the 25s, that's a very dense, very dense strike 17,000 liat
755.42s: 25s with 3600 transactions today and 1100 net new over yesterday. So I bring that to your attention
762.22s: because it tells me people are building in this expiration cycle. They're not taking positions
768.30s: whereas if I look in here, notice, and this is exactly what I expected based on the video yesterday
773.26s: if you were called that I thought the 25s people would be taking down and rolling out. And that's
777.50s: exactly what they're doing. So you can see that there was negative 4,000 on the OI net. That means
783.66s: people close these positions. My guess is again that they're just moving them out in time. So not
787.50s: seeing the price behavior and they're trying to salvage what they can of the remaining time value.
793.82s: So what's the play here for me? I still have my long shares and I intend to hold those. I have
799.10s: decent basis on them, but even if I didn't like I told you guys I plan to hold them just to support
804.14s: the ape movement. I like I like it. I like what you guys are about. It's fun for me to participate.
809.58s: So that's the deal with the shares and I highlight that because I'm essentially turning the
814.38s: trader part of my brain off and I'm using some money to participate. Now the trader part of my
820.70s: brain has short calls on still in 20 September against the long shares that I've already made
827.10s: some money on. I've rolled them down and I probably will scrub a little bit more off of them
832.54s: because they're producing and it's just allowing me to not just see the unrealized gains on my shares
839.66s: dwindle, but it's allowing me to take some money and while that's happening. In terms of long
844.62s: options, I've none of them right now in GameStop and I don't intend to until I start to see it
850.86s: paving closer to what I want. So really what I'm paying attention to is when do I see more buying
857.74s: volume, right? Because right now it's not here and somebody else made a comment about how,
863.90s: you know, they said that the buyers have never stepped away, which I appreciate. I know that the
867.34s: apes have always been there. But what I mean is from a broader market perspective, you need
872.94s: big volume and with the amount of the at the money offering that came through, there's a lot of shares
878.86s: floating around right now. So the flow isn't as locked up as it used to be. So what that means is
884.62s: this that's partially good and bad. It's good in this case because even though we're seeing these
890.54s: sellers coming through in mass, they're not really crushing the price. It's going down, but they're
895.98s: not crushing it, which again is probably because a lot of shares got also picked up during
902.38s: the at the money offering. So we'll have to see where it starts to stabilize. That's what I'm
907.10s: most interested in. When does this start consolidating? That's where I start looking at in long options.
913.74s: That's where I start looking to add more shares. For me, the trading side of my brain, when I see
918.86s: something going down, I'm not going to build a long position until it's tenor changes. The down
925.10s: inside of that, I very rarely top tick or bottom tick something. So even this move here, when I first
931.18s: started getting in in the beginning of the May, I waited until this breakout came through. So I
936.14s: didn't get in here. I didn't get in here. These periods obviously would have made me some more
940.94s: money. But the problem is, again, from a trading perspective, I'm thinking about probabilistic outcomes,
947.10s: what's most probable to happen and then how can I put money behind those ideas? So that's why I think
952.14s: about it the way I do. So as always, any questions, let me know through them in the comments.
956.22s: Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
