0.00s: Don't let the alert of zero DTE options make you think that there's less risk involved.
6.00s: There's a benefit.
7.00s: There is no overnight risk because zero DTE means the options expire in zero days, the same day.
14.00s: So you don't have overnight risk that's good.
16.00s: The problem is options are priced pretty efficiently.
20.00s: So what that means is if you think, oh well, most of these are going to expire worthless at the end of the day,
25.00s: let me sell some of them.
27.00s: It's just one big move you need before you wipe out a bunch of profits that took you weeks or months to accumulate.
34.00s: And the inverse happens when you're buying, you might lose a whole bunch of time trying to make a few dollars,
38.00s: and after commission fees slipage, it might not make sense.
41.00s: That's not to say never trade them, but I wouldn't use that as your only trading strategy.
46.00s: I would have some other stuff in the toolkit and apply zero DTE when it makes sense.
51.00s: Being all our sea guys later.
