0.00s: What's up outliers?
2.00s: Bit of a mixed bag out there today and the market is giving you a heads up.
7.36s: That's what I see.
8.36s: So I want to talk about two main topics today.
13.16s: The first one is going to be the tech sector again.
17.28s: So I specifically want to talk about SMCI and Nvidia.
20.68s: And then we will take a look at some broader market scans to help people look for some opportunities
27.04s: out here.
28.04s: So and then at the end of the video, I will poke through GameStop and see if anything's
31.56s: going on in there.
33.40s: But let's dive right in.
35.36s: So we're at a really interesting point in the market.
38.32s: We can clearly see a downtrend starting in Q's.
45.12s: Whether this again, stabilizes at some point is TBD.
49.36s: But as I was recently talking about in the video yesterday, this needs to be a higher
55.28s: low.
56.52s: And right now, it's not right now.
58.92s: It's still trending down even though today was an update.
61.84s: It opened a gap lower and then closed higher, but it's still a down day.
66.36s: So I think here we really, really need this to stabilize if I'm to believe that this
73.44s: is the continuation of an uptrend versus the assumption of a downtrend.
78.20s: Now when I look at it from a qualitative perspective, I'm seeing broad changes going
83.12s: on right now.
84.28s: So I'm seeing things like SMCI get downgraded.
87.64s: I'm seeing things like Nvidia, which is a disproportionate, an alarmingly disproportionate
94.12s: proponent of the entire stock market at this point.
96.60s: It's kind of wild.
98.04s: If you look at the S&P 500, I was just looking at this on a live stream recently and it surprised
104.20s: me a little bit.
105.28s: So if you take a look at the S&P 500, so we'll just look at Spy and we look at this.
112.28s: Back is 30% now.
114.32s: It used to be in the 20s and I thought that was heavy.
117.96s: Now it's over 30.
119.76s: And if we take a look in video in and of itself is 5.7%.
125.24s: Then we have Microsoft and Apple, which all of those are fairly well correlated.
131.40s: What I'm trying to highlight is the overwhelming majority of the S&P 500 falls clearly within
139.24s: the top 20 holdings within the top 10 specifically, but the top three are in outsized input to this
148.12s: entire index, like over 20%.
151.28s: Just for these three stocks.
154.08s: So make sense, they're massive stocks, but it's almost like Spy is starting to kind
161.60s: of become like another tech stock.
164.56s: And that's just because of how successful tech has been.
167.16s: Okay.
168.16s: And that's all of this matter.
169.16s: It matters because when I look at the broad market now and I see tech starting to roll over
177.20s: a little bit that gives me flashing warning signs, not that we're crashing again as much
183.92s: as it would be better for the YouTube channel for me to tell you that the sky is falling
187.44s: and to go stock up on canned foods because it's all coming to an end.
192.64s: I don't think that way.
194.04s: I'm actually pretty optimistic in general.
196.12s: I just look at this as a little bit of an inflection point and it's going to dictate where
200.48s: I want to put my money.
202.48s: So when I look at something like this, I'm not actually scaling in to a bunch of positions,
208.40s: although I did add to the my S&P 500, my futures positions there a little bit.
214.52s: I'm just trying to maintain some sort of broad core exposure here because other than that,
220.64s: I don't have exposure in cues.
222.84s: And I don't have exposure in Russell, which I kind of want exposure in both, but I can't
227.52s: rationalize it.
228.96s: So if we take a look at NASDAQ futures or again, cues, whatever you want, it doesn't look
234.36s: great.
235.56s: It doesn't look terrible, but this also isn't the place that I want to start scaling into
240.28s: things.
241.28s: As I've talked about before, I see a lower high.
243.52s: I see the climbing low that again, we need to see if this gains a footing and starts
247.36s: to consolidate a little bit before like this kind of scenario.
251.36s: But even if it starts consolidating, we have to be ready for it to reverse and start
255.26s: finding its way back down again.
257.12s: This is just clearly a point where things are not in a defined trend.
262.76s: And this is where it's really easy to get stuck.
264.96s: You know, you can get stuck in a few different ways.
267.20s: The first ways you can get stuck by analysis paralysis, looking at this saying, I don't know
271.16s: which way it's going to go.
272.16s: Who does?
273.16s: And then not putting anything on.
274.80s: That's one way you get stuck.
276.04s: The other way you get stuck is if you're trying to use some sort of momentum following
279.92s: strategy, you're using moving average crossovers.
283.40s: And this is one of the most frustrating periods for those kinds of strategies because it's above,
287.60s: it's above, it's above, it's below.
289.48s: And as you're entering an exiting, you're realizing P&L on those entrances and exits that
295.40s: impact your account.
296.92s: So then the question becomes, well, what looks good here?
300.08s: Well, as I've already talked to you about before, there's still a lot of stuff that looks
304.92s: good that's still continuing to hold up.
308.60s: So XLF is definitely holding on here.
312.56s: XLI is starting to fall off.
314.96s: XLP hitting new highs.
316.64s: I just put on another position within this sector specifically for this reason.
321.64s: XLRE just hit another new high.
323.44s: XLU just hit another new high.
325.64s: XLV just hit another new high.
327.64s: So I'm highlighting these same sectors.
330.80s: This is like a week in a row now that I'm talking about these same sectors giving where
336.48s: at least I'm finding strength because even though the broad market and the golden goose
341.96s: that we typically would migrate towards being XLK is not looking healthy.
346.24s: There's other stuff that's doing well.
349.12s: So that's what I think from a broad perspective.
351.48s: We need to figure out what tech wants to do here.
353.92s: And I don't know if tech knows what tech wants to do here.
357.12s: And until it starts to sort itself out, that's not where I'm looking to start piling
362.16s: money.
363.16s: From a broader trend perspective, we just had SMCI get downgraded after lackluster earnings.
371.00s: Again, it actually missed on EPS estimates, which is really not good.
375.88s: It came in at 625.
378.00s: It was expected at 7.3 was that.
380.76s: Let's see.
381.76s: 7.63, my bad.
384.12s: And it then just got downgraded recently by Barclays, which again, these analysts upgrades
391.20s: downgrades.
392.20s: I don't put too much stock in it.
393.72s: I guess to throw bad pun out there.
396.76s: But it does matter because other people use it.
401.08s: That's kind of the funny thing about markets.
402.64s: Even if I don't really think much about the analysts upgrades downgrades, if the market
408.28s: believes it, then it doesn't matter if I believe it or not, it has the ability to move the
411.80s: market.
413.00s: And that's for a bunch of different reasons.
414.76s: It's not always because, oh, we think the analysts are right.
417.88s: It's because people that hold things like SMCI in their funds have to justify on a
423.84s: quarterly basis why they hold what they hold.
426.64s: And then they start to look not great if they're holding a bunch of things that aren't
430.32s: being upgraded by analysts.
432.08s: They look like they're death tone.
434.56s: And I think it's more conservative for a lot of those kinds of entities to not hold
439.76s: something that's not being recommended generally.
442.48s: And we can see that because, I mean, take a look at the follow through.
446.60s: It's just been some sale volume.
448.08s: Now again, sooner or later, I think this will hit a level that people get interested
451.64s: in.
452.64s: But we've had a precipitous decline, a massive decline over six months from 1229 down to 400,
460.44s: massive, massive decline.
463.68s: So that doesn't look great.
466.72s: And this impacts the broader tech picture because people are looking at stocks like SMCI,
471.96s: thinking this is part of the future.
473.52s: This is part of how we're going to see AI servers coming out rolling out in the future,
479.72s: which is supposed to be a giant, giant profit driver.
482.20s: I still think AI is a massive value driver.
485.80s: But it takes time for these things to materialize.
488.92s: And right now it's not there.
491.76s: So SMCI is getting punished.
493.88s: And then if we take a look at something like Nvidia, which we already talked about this
497.04s: a few times.
498.04s: So I'm not going to go over their earnings and stuff, but this still doesn't look good
500.40s: either.
501.40s: It doesn't look bad.
502.40s: Again, I want to be very clear when I say doesn't look good.
505.44s: A lot of people take that to mean the null.
508.36s: And it's not binary.
509.96s: I can have something that doesn't look good and doesn't look bad.
512.72s: It just doesn't look like anything that I'm interested in, which is kind of in video
516.20s: right now.
517.20s: Again, from an investor standpoint, further down this goes my opinion, the more attractive
521.88s: it gets because I still embellish an Nvidia long term.
525.16s: But that's I'm not an investor.
526.44s: I'm a trader.
527.72s: And I cycle on shorter term timeframes.
529.76s: And I think and I need things to move in a time frame that makes sense for my thesis
534.36s: for what I'm trying to accomplish, especially as an options trader because options expire.
539.76s: You can be right but wrong happens to all of us all the time.
544.52s: So with this, I'm also very, very interested to see if it gains a bite here and starts
550.08s: to consolidate because if it does, then I love that because then it looks like yes,
555.16s: we have a slightly lower high, but then we have a higher low, which would then nullify
560.00s: this downtrend section here as compared to a lower low coming down here, showing a continuation
566.88s: of this broad downtrend.
568.12s: So we have to wait and see what it does.
569.84s: So for me, from an investing standpoint, long term doesn't look bad, but from a near term
575.72s: trading perspective and from an information integration in the markets and pricing,
580.92s: it looks like it's still sorting things out.
583.64s: And this is not where I would be massively bullish in it.
586.04s: Take a look at these recent five candles.
589.20s: Four of them have outsized sale volume.
592.36s: This one close is 53% sale volume, but still majority sale volume.
596.40s: And the last two days have been just dumping it, just unwinding.
600.72s: So yeah, I am really interested to see how Nvidia behaves here, but right now it looks
606.88s: like tech, even from a general momentum perspective using two different oscillators here.
611.80s: I spoke with, I think the pro Patreon members about the inclusion of MTSI, this is just
618.16s: from a study that I read that I'm interested in tinkering with it.
620.92s: So really you can kind of ignore this blue one for now.
624.12s: I'm just putting it through some repetitions and observing it myself so I can come up with
628.44s: an idea to complement the studies I'm running on it.
631.12s: But mostly what I want to direct your attention to here is the RSI that I see.
635.32s: And again, there's two lines here.
636.84s: You'll see the RSI itself.
638.16s: And then you'll see a moving average for the RSI.
640.44s: I like to smooth RSI's.
643.16s: So the EMA is downward sloping.
645.96s: This is a short term four day EMA.
649.28s: And then the RSI itself is downward sloping below the EMA.
653.48s: Moving averages, turning over on the short term.
656.32s: So we can see that the, right now the short term MA that I'm using is a nine day.
662.00s: Sometimes this will be a 10 day either or, and that's downward sloping.
666.08s: And so yeah, I mean, I just, I don't love the way this looks.
669.40s: And the longer term moving averages are starting to rotate down over some of the shorter
674.32s: terms.
675.32s: So the 50 day already is starting to show a, let's take a little, yeah, it's negative
680.20s: sloping already negative 0.4.
683.00s: So that's negative sloping 20 days negative sloping now, a bunch of negative sloping
686.86s: moving averages.
687.86s: All of this is to say right now it's going down.
691.16s: I know what a revelation, what a revelation.
695.44s: Joking aside, I do use these is an indication to help me understand like how much movement
701.52s: is behind a pullback.
703.04s: You can get some ideas on like these sharp pullbacks that rapidly start ascending back.
708.80s: The mid term long term moving averages won't even notice them.
711.76s: They don't care.
712.76s: So it takes a little bit more of a pro long downtrend or resume downtrend, right?
717.96s: So downtrend started up trend and then resuming to the downside here so far for these moving
722.36s: averages to roll over.
723.88s: So between that, the breath indicators, the volume from a really simple perspective,
728.44s: this is a keep an eyeball on it, but nothing that I am overly eager to jump in front of
734.04s: right now, although I am bullish in Nvidia long, long term.
737.28s: And the other thing I have to be honest with you is even with NASDAQ futures, I was real,
741.28s: real, real close, real close to pull the trigger on starting to enter just little tiny position
746.40s: today because the broader part of me just instinctually feels that this is going to start
753.28s: resuming to the upside.
755.60s: The main reason why I feel that is because I haven't seen any sort of big material change
762.16s: in information that would lead me to believe that the underpinning reason for the ascent
767.56s: of tech here is now reversed.
770.12s: I just haven't seen that yet.
772.72s: So I mean, we'll see, DVD, a little bit too early to come up with any significant conclusions
778.68s: from it yet, but that's just the way that I'm initially looking at this.
782.96s: All right, so now let's rotate over and I want to take a look at GameStop.
789.16s: And GameStop in my opinion here is generally following more of the broad market.
794.72s: Now the cool part is if we move into the three months, we're starting to drop off these
798.40s: really big candles.
799.64s: So a lot of this will start to normalize and we are closing in on earnings.
804.24s: What I don't love is the sale volume on the last two days because the overall volume
809.24s: is also pretty high.
811.48s: So on the third, we saw 11.35 million shares with 83% sale volume and then the fourth
818.48s: rate 6.8 million shares with 99% sale volume.
822.76s: So people just kind of unwinding today pretty meaningfully.
826.16s: So this is a little bit of a resumption in my opinion of a sideways trend, nothing that
833.16s: I really care about near term, right?
835.84s: Like it's continuing to oscillate sideways nicely between this kind of 18 and three quarters
840.56s: and this 25 handle ish, something like that.
843.76s: And it's just staying within that range.
845.76s: That's okay.
846.76s: And I think it's really just depending on what catalyst we get from earnings if any.
852.36s: Most people have kind of let me know that earnings typically is a bit slower, not really that
857.28s: big of an event.
858.76s: So I don't have that context as well as a lot of you do.
862.48s: I don't really trade GameStop for earnings too much, but I am going to obviously pay
865.72s: closer attention to it for earnings here, just out of curiosity.
871.28s: One of the things I am really curious about is if we're going to start getting some information
874.88s: on this cash pile.
876.16s: Most people have said that they don't typically release a statement with earnings, which
879.80s: I can't help but find slightly interesting because it's like, well, what's the point
883.36s: of earnings then other than reporting the financial performance of a company guidance is
886.92s: a big part of it.
888.32s: So I'm hopeful that maybe we'll see something, but I'm uncertain if we will find out
895.44s: in just a few days here.
897.20s: So let's pivot over and take a look at the options chain because I noticed this, which
904.52s: made me kind of happy.
906.44s: So we are now definitively at a two to one ratio calls to puts, which is actually very,
912.16s: very cool because it's been around that, but not quite.
916.12s: 106,000 of those calls is in this front expiration.
920.20s: 55,000 is in the next.
921.60s: I'm expecting this next expiration to build out more because it includes earnings and
925.12s: I'm expecting people to want to play earnings.
927.68s: But GameStop is continuing to really have a loaded front expiration, which is kind of
934.88s: standard business at this point.
938.12s: But you can see that the 18 ox are what I found is the densest expiration cycle so far.
945.40s: So we can see that 17,000, 130,000 calls 18 oct is 151.
951.64s: The six steps is only 106.
953.12s: The 20 steps is 93.
954.96s: So I keep an eye on where I'm seeing this kind of centralization and exposure because
960.68s: the longer term explorations tend to build over time as more people are establishing these
964.48s: longer term positions, very, very normal.
966.96s: But I can detect quick changes and that's again, useful information for me.
973.00s: And then the other thing I took a look at from our friends over at unusual whales is we
979.00s: are seeing a little bit of activity in these 20 calls, but these are all the way out in
983.64s: 2025.
985.32s: And they're bigger trades, but still not anything near the size that we had been seeing
989.44s: for a while.
990.44s: We got a little bit spoiled seeing just massive, massive trades week day of day after
994.84s: day week over week for a little while.
997.00s: So now we're back down to just essentially four line items above $100,000.
1002.36s: So for me, I would call this quiet.
1005.72s: That's the over overwhelming sensation.
1008.20s: I feel if we add the puts back in, again, this doesn't really change most of the larger transactions
1013.00s: are on the call side right now.
1015.72s: So that's about it.
1017.56s: We have a YouTube live session later today for those interested at five PM Pacific time.
1022.28s: And then the GME live stream will be Saturday at five PM Pacific time.
1027.68s: The intent for this one is I started going through old, roaring kiddie stuff going all the
1033.20s: way through his Reddit profile posts.
1036.56s: And I found some really interesting things that just peak my curiosity, much of them being
1042.84s: really early trades that were very options heavy, surprising to me.
1047.40s: So what I want to do is actually take a much closer look at what the trades looked like
1052.60s: as he was putting them on so that I can then continue developing this fingerprinting mechanism.
1058.12s: Now one thing I want to highlight is the reason why I'm trying to ID and fingerprint
1063.04s: his behaviors is not actually because I have any intention whatsoever of attempting
1067.40s: to copy him.
1068.40s: I'm not going to.
1069.92s: I am I've always traded my own book.
1073.72s: But for me, I'm like studying a fascinating character that does so many things that are
1081.40s: so irregular that I cannot help but be super curious about the way that he's using the
1087.60s: products that I use on a daily basis and to learn more about that.
1091.92s: I just want to be clear because I think sometimes people might spend a little too much
1096.64s: time trying to decode what he's doing so that essentially they can copy his every move.
1102.24s: And that's okay if that's your approach like whatever works for you works for you, but
1105.04s: that's super dangerous because one of the things that he does that you have to acknowledge
1110.12s: is the way that he sizes his positions.
1112.84s: And unless you're able to like fully employ what somebody is doing, you're always going
1118.32s: to get a partial result because I've seen after going through his old post, I've seen
1122.60s: his portfolio go up hundreds of percents but also go down by the same.
1127.36s: So the main thing I try to highlight with that point is while I'm fascinated by studying
1132.24s: the character, the background, the methodology, it's just from a curiosity standpoint.
1137.20s: And I throw that out as a cautionary tale because I don't want people looking at what
1140.44s: I'm doing as if like, oh yeah, Eric's been doing this for a while and he's trying to
1144.12s: figure this out so we can copy him.
1145.48s: So that seems like a good idea that's not it at all.
1147.76s: I'm just interested in it.
1149.56s: And for you, the best thing I could ever tell to anybody is do what makes sense for you.
1154.16s: You're the only person that can manage your own finances in a way that makes sense for
1158.44s: you.
1159.44s: So whatever that is, do that.
1160.92s: If it's yellowing GME to the moon because you think that's right for you, go for it.
1164.80s: If it's saving your money, dollar cost averaging into an index ETF and then having some speculative
1169.76s: plays out there, right?
1171.04s: Whatever works for you works for you.
1172.52s: The important part is understanding and always remembering that you are the ultimate controller
1177.08s: of your destiny.
1178.36s: Take control of your actions, what you choose to do, own them and do whatever you think
1183.80s: is best for you.
1184.80s: I will see you on the live streams later.
1187.44s: Be an outlier.
1188.44s: Catch you guys later.
