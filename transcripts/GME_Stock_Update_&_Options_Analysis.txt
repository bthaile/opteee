0.76s: what's up outliers Apes ape outliers uh
3.76s: today's all about GameStop and it's
5.72s: because I want to one talk about where
8.76s: we are today I want to recap what we've
12.32s: learned so far from analyzing all of
15.00s: rk's old trades and then I want to talk
17.92s: to you about some analysis that I want
20.48s: to integrate into the Saturday live
23.64s: stream going forward because there's a
26.00s: lot that we have to do from my
27.76s: perspective in terms of what I'm trying
29.16s: to learn so we have a lot to get through
32.52s: and let's Dive Right In so we'll first
34.12s: do quick current state analysis of
35.96s: GameStop which is a little bit of a
38.08s: downtrend it's been down uh 5 days in a
40.96s: row consecutively and it's hovering
43.48s: right around 21 right now it closed at
45.80s: 2090 one of the things I want to note is
48.72s: that there is a volume node that lives
51.72s: right in here at about 20 and a half so
55.32s: to me this looks like the next near-term
57.40s: Target and then depending on how it
59.32s: behaves around that near-term Target
60.96s: again we'll see and as always I want to
63.44s: remind you when I draw these lines it's
65.48s: it's not pinpoint Precision right these
67.80s: are always kind of ranges the way to
69.52s: think about when I draw a line like that
71.48s: is that it really represents this kind
73.64s: of Zone the reason for that is I'm using
76.08s: the width of the volume profile to
78.64s: determine where I think price is likely
80.84s: to get stuck around and if so to what
83.48s: degree now if we take a look at small
86.40s: caps small caps have been also trending
90.16s: down so this just adds a little bit of
92.20s: overall pressure as far as I'm concerned
94.76s: to something like GameStop now there's
96.76s: one thing that I'm actually very excited
98.88s: about which is if we take a look at the
101.52s: current open interest Feast your eyes
104.56s: there's 650,000
106.64s: calls against just 284,000 puts we're
112.08s: still seeing this huge skew but it
115.56s: starts to get a little more interesting
117.28s: now because if we take a look across
120.20s: where a lot of this oi is it's here in
125.40s: 18
126.60s: October that starts to get way more
130.84s: interesting because if we look at the
133.12s: overall exposure in 18 October it's
136.84s: 273,000
138.48s: calls against 92,000 puts so we're
141.92s: actually starting to see like a pretty
145.32s: stark contrast call put oi variance and
149.96s: it's starting to look closer and closer
152.96s: in time now it's centralizing in 18
155.72s: October which is quite meaningful now in
158.56s: terms of overall options activity there
160.76s: was a ton of calls traded today
164.16s: 999,000 against 17,000 puts most of
167.40s: those calls were sold because they came
170.12s: in at the bid or below and on the put
173.60s: side a lot of those were bought
175.96s: 34% so bit of a mixed bag as far as I'm
179.12s: concerned with respect to today's
181.56s: overall activity other than the fact
183.12s: that this is a ton of calls still that
185.04s: are moving that is a whole whole lot of
187.08s: calls now looking across the volatility
190.12s: in the chains I see really muted
193.76s: volatility literally across the entire
195.52s: board nothing is above 100% that is very
199.24s: rare and in my opinion this is one of
201.56s: those times where it just feels like a
204.48s: matter of time until something happens
207.60s: and again it's just because I not even
209.76s: earnings is over 100% which is rare for
212.44s: something like this normally you can see
214.00s: exactly where earnings is because V is
218.00s: elevated around that period so I find
221.92s: how quiet volatility here is to be quite
224.32s: interesting if we take a look at average
227.04s: daily ranges on the 5 day it's 4% 20day
230.64s: it's five 90day it's 9.3 so obviously
234.88s: average daily range tightening up quite
236.88s: a lot and then if we look at the average
239.84s: true range that's also tightened up
243.08s: quite a lot as far as I can see so 90
245.84s: days was about 11.2% 20 days
249.04s: 5.6 and then 5 days 4.2 so this is if
252.44s: you picture Binger bands they're getting
254.56s: tight that's essentially all this is
256.72s: showing me um in number format it's a
258.88s: little quicker for me to see so that's
261.08s: that volume did tick up a little bit
263.84s: today so the last 2 days before today we
267.28s: had 4.6 5.3 now we we are at 5.9 so
271.72s: almost six that's a nice slight uptick
274.28s: in volume I don't love the look of this
276.24s: candle because this is pretty much
278.12s: one-sided selling pressure most of the
280.08s: day and we can see that represented 88%
282.60s: sale volume no surprise there and then a
284.96s: quick peek at RSI it does show us
289.04s: rotating over um the right now it's red
292.28s: because it's Crossing below the moving
295.04s: average of the RSI and right now I'm
296.96s: using a 7day moving average for RS I
300.12s: both of them are negative sloping so
301.72s: kind of negative overall oscillator
304.60s: presence here which is just kind of a
306.56s: momentum indicator for me now let's take
309.44s: a quick look at the volume that we've
312.04s: seen I want to look at two spots the
314.12s: first one looking at unusual whales just
317.64s: sorting today by premium super quiet we
321.16s: had one series of transactions out in 25
325.24s: uh January 2025 for 100k everything else
328.28s: is Tiny so there is really nothing to
331.04s: talk about in here and then if we take a
333.36s: look at the dark pool really quick for
335.60s: GameStop see if anything interesting was
337.36s: going on in
339.40s: here and I'm going to sort this by
341.96s: premium as
344.12s: well overall it looks quiet yeah very
348.96s: very quiet we only have one trade over a
351.08s: million there's a handful you know
353.16s: several hundred th000 worth which is
355.60s: kind of standard fair and then the other
357.52s: thing just out of curiosity we have to
358.80s: look and see if there's those 5,000
360.24s: blocks again that's more just out of
361.72s: curiosity it's not because I think
364.16s: anything too highly about it let's drop
366.84s: five not 100 5,000 in here and they're
370.08s: still there so we have much less but I
373.04s: see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 so
379.20s: this leads into the next part of the
381.52s: analysis that I want to continue going
383.44s: forward because we had a really
384.68s: interesting conversation during the live
386.44s: stream on Saturday about roaring kitties
389.16s: old trades and then again like piecing
391.72s: together what could have happened now
393.68s: there's one thing I have to be
395.12s: abundantly clear about when I'm
397.32s: analizing things there are two buckets
400.20s: in my mind there's the bucket of I can
403.52s: decisively prove this that is true
407.24s: verifiable information then there's the
409.92s: bucket of I think this might be but I
414.44s: can't directly prove it and I know I
416.36s: can't prove it so when I'm analyzing the
419.04s: cat's movements right now as I go
422.36s: through the current state analysis of
424.12s: his trades I am far more interested in
426.80s: this first bucket of what I know I can
431.28s: prove by looking at his YOLO updates by
434.40s: looking at movement in gme price the
437.40s: reason why I care about that is because
439.36s: one of the the giant theories we're
441.16s: trying to explore is rk's methodology
444.96s: and did he find some sort of secret code
448.72s: that helps him predict movement because
450.60s: there's a a ton of different variations
453.84s: out there around it and all of it is
456.84s: we're not able to decisively prove it
460.08s: but I want to see how close we can get
462.64s: because there's a lot of information
464.36s: that alludes towards something leading
466.72s: like yes but then there's also a lot of
468.80s: information again that leads to no so
472.00s: for example as we look through a lot of
474.68s: his old trades one of the things that I
477.60s: find really really interesting
480.36s: is how much the portfolio volatility
484.44s: actually is and it makes a ton of sense
486.92s: right he calls it his YOLO updates it's
489.44s: YOLO you expect a lot of volatility in a
491.68s: YOLO play so when I'm looking at stuff
494.64s: like this I clearly can see that there's
497.84s: not a hyp specific timing mechanism in
501.44s: this period I want to emphasize this
503.72s: period because this is looking back at
506.48s: 2020 and 2021 and again the reason why I
509.56s: don't think that there's a specific
510.84s: timing mechanism is because I can see
512.84s: the portfolio up here reaches 2.3
515.84s: million and then it contracts down to
518.72s: 1.3 uh less than about two weeks later
521.72s: right like if you have specific dates
524.04s: that you're playing something you don't
526.08s: let your portfolio do that there's no
527.60s: reason to and it's not out of the
529.88s: context of trying to make as much money
531.48s: as possible because I don't think that's
533.20s: rk's ultimate motive here but I think in
536.16s: terms of playing the game and beating
538.04s: the game and adding as much pressure and
540.56s: being able to accumulate as much
542.80s: gamestock stock as possible you do that
546.32s: through more Capital right so when I
548.80s: look at the ultimate motivating factor
550.72s: as far as it looks like in terms of him
552.32s: accumulating his stock position and
553.92s: stuff like that you would want more
555.68s: money to do that so then if you have
557.04s: some sort of really great timing tool
559.00s: you wouldn't go through this kind of
560.24s: portfolio volatility because when you go
561.92s: down to 1.3 million when you get back up
564.24s: here to 3.2 essentially if you don't
567.60s: lose that million dollar this 3.2 now
570.64s: can become three well 4 and a half or
573.00s: almost five because there's the
574.56s: compounding effect of that Capital not
576.24s: going through draw Downs so this is the
578.52s: old stuff we're just now getting to his
582.56s: updated trades and one we're going
586.28s: through and reconstructed and we've
587.80s: already done this reconstructed this
589.88s: entire block of positions that you see
591.76s: here the 5 million shares and then the
594.64s: 120,000 calls we can track all of them
597.64s: we can see when they were entered what
599.72s: the cumulative premium was at the point
601.56s: in time that he was entering what was
603.04s: GameStop's price we have all of that so
605.64s: again this is the first bucket this is
607.68s: the stuff I can decisively track prove
610.44s: add up do math and see now we have a
614.52s: really interesting scenario where I want
617.32s: to analyze and this is part of the
619.20s: analysis I want to do on the next series
621.72s: or the next session on Saturday is I
624.08s: actually want to go
625.80s: through not just his old trades
630.28s: but I've been purposefully going all the
632.60s: way back into
635.28s: 2023 starting here and I'm going to go
637.92s: back further but what I'm doing is I'm
639.88s: analyzing the trade Behavior and the
641.96s: premium amounts around different moves
644.88s: in GameStop so if I slide this over here
647.68s: and I zoom this out further we go out to
649.48s: three years daily I can find different
652.40s: periods where GameStop started rallying
654.56s: for different reasons whether it's for
656.08s: earnings whether it's kind of this post
658.36s: earnings Gap and I'm analyzing the stock
661.76s: movement in these periods and what I
664.68s: want to see
666.28s: specifically is what kind of
668.32s: corresponding options activity was there
671.08s: because one of the things people have
672.40s: said is like oh the options chains were
675.08s: dead before the cat came back and I've
679.32s: heard that said I don't know if it's
681.52s: true so I want to go through and look
684.00s: and explore and see like what dead means
687.20s: because as I cursory flip through this
690.04s: they're they're really not dead around a
692.12s: lot of these periods now there are
693.72s: periods that I found where they're
695.16s: completely dead for like an entire month
697.64s: the biggest trade is 80k in April of 23
701.56s: but as soon as I see different kind of
703.20s: movement patterns and what I'm going to
704.80s: do is deconflict by time I'm going to
707.20s: see are we seeing these options trades
709.36s: getting built out and then the move or
711.44s: are we starting to see signs of a move
713.56s: then options trades get built out and
715.48s: I'm going to do this all the way back to
717.80s: 2021 so that's that's the next step in
720.12s: the analysis I am super excited because
723.36s: I am a giant nerd and this
725.48s: stuff's so damn interesting to me so I'm
729.52s: excited to see what we can learn as we
731.20s: go through all of these and track them
732.88s: discreetly like this here look at this
735.04s: there's this was in June of
737.96s: 2023 the 7th of June so then when I go
741.28s: in there and I look at that I was like
742.80s: okay well let me find the 7th of June in
745.44s: 2023 I have to squish this in a little
748.36s: bit so it's easier
749.84s: let's go 2023
753.92s: June here's the
758.08s: 7th so this was an earnings play it
760.52s: looks like gap down but then it shot
762.68s: right back up out so what I'm going to
764.72s: do is actually track not just the
767.24s: entrances for these trades but I'm going
768.80s: to find the exits and see when we exited
772.12s: we being whoever this is and try to
774.76s: analyze some of the stuff because again
776.08s: like around earnings here this is
777.64s: hyperactive relative to the time frame
780.00s: to be clear this is not dead in my
782.16s: opinion there's still several million in
784.44s: options being traded throughout the
786.04s: month now again this pales in comparison
788.80s: to when the cat came back with his War
790.84s: chest of hundreds of millions of dollars
793.24s: but this is exactly what I want to
795.44s: explore because I'm so curious what
797.84s: these options chains look like in
799.32s: different periods so I've actually
801.08s: started exporting all of this data into
804.36s: python so that I can do my standard
806.04s: manipulation a little bit easier but
807.56s: then won't on the live stream we'll go
808.92s: through through literally period by
810.72s: period just like that so that we can see
812.92s: because literally just because this
815.44s: shit's interesting so that's my game
817.08s: plan as always anything you need let me
818.84s: know be an outlier and I will see you
821.16s: all to live stream catch you later
