0.00s: Hey everybody, Eric here. I was lucky enough to randomly find Matt on Twitter and I actually
8.00s: look through your stuff a little bit like I was just telling you and I love a lot of what
12.64s: you talk about and you have an interesting background. So first off, welcome to the channel.
17.84s: Thank you. Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure.
20.00s: Yeah, and I'm really looking forward to the conversation. So I figured as always, it's really
24.80s: helpful to just start with a little bit of level setting. Maybe get a little bit of your background.
28.88s: You gave me a little bit of a preamble, but I would love to understand two main things.
33.84s: The first one is how did you get started in trading or investing kind of whichever you more
38.80s: closely identify with? I think it's trading, but we'll see. And then the second one is just walk
44.48s: me through kind of an evolution from that start to where you are now.
49.68s: Okay, thanks. Well, you know, so first of all, I'm just happy to be on your, you know,
53.76s: marine veteran, like I was saying before we started the call, I always respect people that such
57.68s: passion and work so hard. That's I think that's key for success in anything that you got to do
62.24s: in life. And I think the Marines probably represent that better than anything else out there. So
67.44s: so just a bit of my background. My dad, you know, he kind of loved the markets, but it was it was in
72.56s: his day job. I just didn't like to do on the side. And so for one hour was a really young kid.
76.16s: He always tried to like kind of talk to me about it and stuff. And the first share I bought was Wendy's.
80.72s: I bought five shares. I think I was eight or nine years old because we used to drive to Florida
85.60s: every year in the summertime. And I just stopped when these nice my dad said, well, if you like it,
89.04s: buy buy some shares. So I bought five and I kept track of the three years. But really,
93.36s: what really kind of got me really into the markets was I think I was maybe 16. I forget now exactly,
99.44s: but I read how to make money and stocks by Willie Moniel. And that that book kind of like blew me away.
105.04s: Like I might that was a more value investor at the time, Warren Buffett type stuff. And I tried
109.92s: to kind of read that and my you know, glanced at it and was boring. When I read Bill O'Neil's book,
114.56s: that was like, you know, the angel saying and I said, well, this is really interesting because I was
119.28s: always a, you know, the market always appealed to me, but I just never really clicked as a passion.
122.96s: I always say I was a kid, right? So, sure. But once I read that book, what I really liked about it
127.44s: was the charting section. I just found it so interesting that because you know, especially when you
131.44s: first approached the market, your only question is, you know, when do I buy, when or what do I buy?
136.16s: And to see on a chart, which I'd never seen a stock chart before that that book, to say like,
141.12s: you know, if you draw a trend line here, if this past this point, this is where you buy and then this
144.24s: stock went up 200 percent, it was like, wow, that's how you know, that is the secret for the markets.
149.76s: And I kind of went down my path and I became a chartered market technician. I pretty much
154.40s: read every book I could on technical analysis. I majored in economics. And I'd basically traded ever
160.88s: since I got that read that book, even while it was in university. And that kind of landed my first
166.32s: job where I was a market maker, a protrader right at university. And also I became president of the
172.08s: Canadian Society of Technical Analysts. And that led to me actually, I was a year out of university.
175.76s: And I was asked to come back to be a finance professor for university graduates. So, funnily enough,
180.96s: I was probably a year older than most people in the class and I was teaching that class. And it's
184.88s: still being taught today. Actually, I don't teach it anymore, but it's still that's a very popular course.
189.36s: And well, you know, long story short, I became a chartered financial analyst in 2020. I joined
194.56s: the US investing championship where I gained a little bit of popularity. And today I still invest
199.36s: for myself and have my website, the Kuroso Insights. Awesome. So, it's funny, like I just really
206.24s: identify with how you got started. It's super similar to how I got started, where it was, you know,
213.76s: essentially just bought a couple shares of stuff that I liked and looked interesting. I think
218.96s: that's so curious how for a lot of people, that's how we get started, right? Is you start with what
223.28s: you see, what you know. And you're like, well, I like Wendy. So, go start with them.
228.48s: So, when you started finding this draw to technical analysis, what was your initial impression towards
238.24s: it? And the reason why I'm asking that specific question is my background is very limited technical
247.28s: analysis. I use some of it, but it's definitely a bit of a balance of technical, fundamental,
254.64s: and then a lot of just options data. So, I'm really curious when you were looking at or reading
260.64s: the book, maybe that's, you know, really where it hit for you. But what drew you to technical analysis
265.52s: over the value investing that your dad was doing? Was it simply the chart or what was it?
271.44s: Well, you know, most of the books at that time for technical analysis were mostly futures,
278.00s: guys, commodity, guys. Because in the 80s and 90s, I think the reason the technical analysis was like
282.72s: in the realm of commodity futures trading, not for stocks. Stocks was the respectable place where
287.28s: you looked at financial statements and that was what you looked at. But, you know, I think when you're
291.60s: a young guy, you know, you're 16 years old, I mean, risk doesn't exist. None of that matter. You
296.00s: want to make as much money as possible. And so for me to see on it, you know, so trying to buy a stock,
300.40s: you know, I was reading, I think Benjamin Gray and was one of the first books I tried to read where
303.36s: they talk about utility companies in a 10% return. And when you look in your bank account and you have
307.92s: like $500, you say, yeah, I got to do all this work for $50. But so when I saw what Bill and Neil
313.04s: was talking about in his book, and the first thing he mentions is about controlling your risk. And so
318.16s: it just kind of dawned on to me, you know, how do you control your risk unless you can time your entry,
321.92s: even at a young age that, you know, made a lot of sense to me. And as I jumped into the technical
326.96s: analysis kind of stuff and all these guys were mostly futures commodity traders. And I saw the
330.88s: leverage that existed out there. So as a young guy, again, you're only one thing that you're focused
335.44s: on. So I said, oh, so I with, you know, five or $10,000 of money, save part time, I can buy, you know,
340.88s: $100,000 with a gold or crude oil contracts. And that's where a period of time when I was, you know,
346.88s: really young living at home and had a, you know, cat moves up and down of like hundreds of percent. And
352.32s: you know, up and then crashes back down. It wasn't there definitely not a starway to heaven. I
355.68s: tell you that much. And so that, I just got immersed in tech. It was all about timing and all of that.
360.48s: And I came up obsessed with it. And with time, you know, now I use a lot of fundamentals in my
365.52s: approach. But the technical analysis served me well because my first job as a market maker and
369.20s: day trader was, I mean, really when it comes down to it, it's all technical. I mean, okay, it's not
374.32s: always chart. Some of his also reading market data, like you mentioned, options data. But you're
379.04s: talking about the mechanics of the market. So it's really a different world than fundamental
383.84s: numbers. I mean, those, there is impact sometimes if there's news that comes out, you have to
387.76s: assess the news. What are we talking about? And you learn that with time. But 90% of what you're
392.32s: doing is technical in nature. So it was a background, especially for the first job.
397.04s: And I guess you must be a minor reader because that was actually the next question I was going to
401.76s: ask you. So talk to me a little bit about your times of market maker. You said you spent about
404.88s: what six years doing that. Yeah. Sorry, I had to cut you off. No, go for it. So it was six years.
411.12s: I won the big banks here. Then they, unfortunately, they closed the division, was post-financial crisis,
416.16s: reduced risk. And I did a small stent another brokerage before I went on my own. But the interesting
420.56s: thing is that, you know, when some people kind of hear me speak now or whatever, you learn a lot of
424.72s: what you do now at the bank. And ironically, I remember I showed up. I was 10 years younger than
430.56s: the next guy on the desk. I was by far the I was 22, the youngest guy. And my supervisor said,
435.44s: you know, on the kids, it was like one of those keyboard driven entry systems was like F1 is by
440.16s: F4SL, F3 is short, you know, make us money. And that was really pretty much all I had in terms
446.80s: of trading. You know, so the only training I got was really when a colleague next to me, you know,
451.76s: saw, you know, it was, was, you know, saying, Hey, Matt, why don't you try this? You saw me do all these
455.84s: charting and stuff. And you showed me the kind of the simpler methods they were doing the market
458.88s: making methods. And no one ever puts that in a book because it's such minute detailed information.
464.16s: Right. And they're in quite a bit there. So, but but in general, that was that was day one. It was
469.60s: like, this is by cell. And, you know, let's see at the end of the month, how you do. Yeah, I get to
473.68s: clicking guy. Yeah, yeah, pretty much. So if you were to synthesize, I don't know, maybe like the
479.60s: the top three or five things that you learned as a market maker, what, what are those things? I
485.44s: think that first one is an interesting point. You feel free to add that to your list because I
489.36s: actually have a few friends who are market makers. And I'll talk to them sometimes about trading and
494.00s: whatnot. And it always surprises me. The they have very nuanced information about their firms
500.64s: approach. But if you were to talk to them about other things, they might know it because they're
504.80s: interested in it, but they're not getting it from work necessarily. And that always surprised me.
509.68s: Just how specialized a lot of the knowledge was for them. But I'm curious what year maybe top three
513.76s: to five takeaways were from your time there? Well, one is, you know, it's interesting. Most people
520.72s: on the approach to market, it's a big picture stuff, you know, fundamentals and that. But there's
524.80s: there's a microcosm to the market, the mechanics of the market, much like, you know, you're in the
528.64s: military and, and yeah, you know, everyone thinks about the strategy of war. But then there's actually
532.96s: the actual day to day of what you're doing, which are there two different skill sets. So,
537.04s: and, and you know, if every year trading in a volatile market, even if you want to hold a stock
541.04s: for a 20% return, but if the day-to-day swings in a in a market, like we're dealing with now or
545.52s: five or seven percent, well, if you step on, you know, the the wrong day and you're down seven percent
550.80s: the next day, that dramatically impacts what you're doing. So just the importance of the short-term
555.12s: mechanics. And it's an important part of the toolbox to be able to control that even that short-term
559.84s: risk for long-term returns. A second item I would, I would really say, is very important is, is
565.68s: you get to read the buying and selling pressure, the buying and selling in Canada, we can also see
570.00s: the broker number so you could really read the data better. And luckily, I started before
574.64s: Algos were there, the HFTs, the rather. Yep. So I really saw the impact of institutional investors.
580.40s: It was, it was much clearer. You can still see it, but it was much clearer before. It wasn't,
584.16s: it wasn't distorted by like they, I'm trying to hide their tracks with Algos and stuff like they do
588.48s: now. So it's just that really, they really drive the trends. And if you're going to get this big up
593.12s: trend, you'll see that same buyer. And, and you could notice it after time, like all, you know, we say,
597.28s: hell, you know, number nine is back. Because that'd be the broker code. And, and bang, he started
601.28s: buying all day again. And you, you know, you try and get ahead of him or whatnot. And if you disappear,
604.96s: you, you try and get out before the stock would come back down. So just the real impact of institutional
610.64s: investors, it's not the retail investors, not the day-to-day investor that moves the stock.
614.80s: It's institutional. That's so important. And I guess, you know, let's say a third would be, um,
621.20s: the world I was in, especially, we're, you know, I'm Canadian, it was a lot of resource companies.
625.84s: And so, you know, I learned a lot about the, um, each company has a lot of specifics. So you
630.40s: want to understand your company specifically. But, you know, to be a good investor, you also want
634.80s: to understand the macro picture. So because I wasn't so many of these commodity stocks, like, you know,
638.56s: oil, gold, they're really, I mean, you could be in a gold stock and oil opens down, you know, 4%
643.92s: the next day because of some geopolitical problem in Kazakhstan or in Russia, you know, and so,
648.16s: so it kind of made me ultra aware of all the variables that affect the stock. There's, there's
654.72s: technical variables. There's the individual stocks, fundamental variables. There's the institutional
658.72s: flows. There's global macro problems. So I think some people in the hear me talk and say, well,
663.20s: you know, you have a lot of experience with different things. Just because I was kind of, you know,
667.36s: world where it kind of forced me to, you know, you know, each day you wake up, you get you get slapped
671.28s: in the face, you want to stop and say, well, what, why did I, why did I get slapped this time? And
674.48s: you, you learned that skill set. And it's just like this constant learning process. So those are
678.56s: the three, I guess, big takeaways that I got from that experience. This is pretty awesome,
683.28s: especially that last one, the invention. That's one of my favorite things about the markets in general,
688.16s: is I always find that if you actively trade, you generally, just a more informed human being
695.12s: because exactly what you're noting. And one of my favorite things about the, the markets as well,
700.80s: especially in the US, like we have a very polarized political environment. Every article you read
705.76s: Leens one way or the other, but a lot of financial stuff is pretty straightforward, right? It's like
710.56s: what impact does this have on making money? And I actually always found a lot of reprieve in that
717.04s: perspective because I just get tired of reading the rest of the news. You're like, okay, who wrote this?
720.96s: What's their, what's their angle? Right. But that's interesting. So what led to you jumping ship
727.60s: as a market maker to go be a professor? So actually, I did them simultaneously. So as I was
734.48s: trading, I was, you know, part-time professor gig. So I had one or two set, first of all,
739.04s: one section and two, but it was, you know, night classes. And my, only the first section was during
743.92s: the day. And I was a young guy, 22, so I had to ask my boss permission. So I was actually, I have,
749.44s: I could ask some of my students, some of them are professional traders now too. And, and,
753.36s: you know, I'd be in the front of the class and I get a phone call from my buddy saying,
755.76s: hey, look, you know, I'm gonna hit the bid on this. He told me to let me know if it's coming off.
758.48s: And I'll get hit. So I'd be giving like trades over the phone back then. You know, so that was,
761.68s: I was fine, but it was too much. So after that, I spoke with the university to have it only
766.00s: at night and night classes. Yeah, that's kind of cool that they're accommodating you though.
770.96s: Yeah, it was fun. It was fun. So what was your experience like as a professor dealing with,
776.72s: just, you know, students who are interested in it. And again, the caveat to this question is,
781.20s: when I was working on my MBA, I actually took a handful of trading courses, derivatives courses.
788.16s: And I thought they were fucking abysmal. They were ancient. It drove me nuts. I was blown away
796.32s: that they were still trying to teach that stuff. So I'm really curious what your experience was like,
800.56s: you know, creating materials and whatnot and just what the students were like.
805.36s: So I was kind of fortunate with the school reached out to me that it was a class that was like
809.68s: loosely based on technical analysis. I didn't get the outline of it, but it was kind of that
814.56s: professors own take on things. And they said, look, you're the president of the CSTA,
818.72s: and we'd like you to make a class. So I'm a CMT charter holder. And so I reached out to the
824.80s: CMT association. They had any kind of tools and they actually had this program, the MTA
829.44s: educational foundation where they actually help, you know, professors get up and run. So they
833.04s: had the kind of curriculum. So I kind of took that and that was probably 90% of what I used to,
840.00s: is basically the CMT program, like level one, was probably 80 to 90% of what I taught. And then
846.08s: on top of that, you know, so the name of the class was how to build a profitable trading system.
850.00s: Oh, cool. So I took basically all these technical tools, but we had access to Bloombergs and stuff
855.04s: like that terminal. So, you know, the course, the had a project where they had to build a trading
859.76s: system. They'd not be complex, but it had to be a, you know, moving average crossovers or,
864.16s: you know, tend to break out whatever it would be. And so I kind of took all of the technical tools,
868.80s: but I made it that there would be an application portion to it. So that was, that was fun. It
874.08s: was interesting. The only, the reason I kind of stopped teaching at a certain point was, you know,
878.64s: time became difficult, but out of a class of 50, 60 students, you know, you'd have that four or five
883.84s: people that are really into it. And everyone else would be, you know, arguing for grades,
887.52s: I got a B plus, kind of an A minus. And if you do it for one, then after, so it just kind of,
892.48s: I like, I want to teach people who actually want to learn, not because they're there to pass the
896.56s: class. And with trading, I was so busy, I just, I certainly wanted to say, look, I had some,
900.72s: you know, some friends who want to teach are also, you know, in the field and they took over the class.
906.08s: But that was, that was my experience. That's awesome. It's, I, because I find myself in the
910.80s: same exact, just scenario where I really do enjoy teaching, but I like teaching people who are
915.68s: interested in it. Right. Because I could totally see the, the drag on, you know, just fighting over
920.56s: somebody's grades. Well, B plus A, you should have done better than you get an A minus.
926.00s: You know, it's like, yeah, you have a bad trading day. You come to the class, you teach,
929.12s: like you don't feel like being here that day because you're thinking about what the heck you're
931.76s: going to do with your position tomorrow. And then this guy's saying, like, oh, you know, you gave,
935.36s: you gave Jim, like, you know, an extra two days to work on the project. He said he wasn't feeling
939.60s: well. I wasn't feeling well either. Oh, right. You know what? You know, like, I mean, like, these
943.52s: are not 14 year old kids. Like you're 21 years old. Like, you're an adult. Yeah, like, you know,
949.20s: this is a, an application course. This is right before you graduate into the workforce. You know,
953.12s: like, like, I was my expectations are that you're here to learn because you want to apply, you know,
957.84s: but that's, you know, that's, that's, that's university, right? We're all there. Yeah.
960.80s: At some point, but it's just that was the situation. That's interesting. And then, so then you
966.24s: participated, you said in the US investing. Investing. Yeah. Okay. And what, what was that like?
973.28s: I've heard of it before, but I'm completely ignorant to it. I don't know what, I don't know what
977.84s: the, you know, the program is or anything like that. So it actually goes back to the 80s. I think
981.76s: some of the early participants were Paul Tutor Jones, who's the hedge fund multi building
985.60s: air. Yeah. It is a lot of the, you know, David Ryan, who's three time champion, Mark Minervini,
990.24s: who was champion. There's a lot of the popular names that you know. And so that went back to the 80s.
994.96s: And it actually stopped for, for I think a good 15 years because the guy who runs it stopped
999.28s: to his own hedge fund. And so he came back to restart in 2019. And so when I saw that, the
1003.76s: competition already started. And all the guys I looked up to starting out, you know, were, were
1007.84s: champions of this. So I said, wow, I got to get in there and try my hand at it. And so in 2020,
1012.56s: I joined. And I was always top contender in September, actually, of that year, I was in first place
1018.32s: with 426% return, which broke, which broke the night, the, the nine month record of the
1023.60s: championship going all the way back to the 80s, which I was proud of. Yeah. And I ended up finishing
1027.12s: a top contender, but I didn't finish right. I kind of took my foot off the gas. I didn't realize
1030.08s: stocks were going to go vertical or also I would add even a better return, but I finished with 346%.
1034.40s: But it gave me, I think, I've some good exposure, which I appreciate it. Then it's,
1038.80s: it's giving me a chance to teach again. So that's been a lot of fun. So what, like,
1042.32s: if you were to summarize the experience, especially I'm curious, what does that experience feel like
1048.64s: for you as compared to just your normal trading career? Like what, what's the difference between what
1054.16s: you learned in that championship compared to just your regular trading? So it's funny because I
1059.20s: didn't have that pressure since I started trading. So when I started trading, I, I,
1064.16s: until I started trading professionally, I was trading for myself. So if I made, if I, you know,
1069.44s: quadrupled my account and futures contracts, and then after I made a mistake and it fell all the
1073.12s: way back down, I looked like a fool. Only I knew that. So, you know, when, when you love something,
1078.08s: you're more concerned about being good at it, necessarily than making money. Like I mean,
1082.16s: the point is to make money, but that's going to come with executing well. Right. And when I start
1086.32s: trading professionally at the bank and suddenly I had a manager watching my, my PNL saying like,
1090.16s: oh, no, no, no, you, you can't have that kind of drawdown or, or, you know, hey, Matt, how come,
1094.24s: how come it's two weeks where you're struggling? You know, you're doing great last month and this,
1097.76s: this month, you're, you're down. Just that feeling of someone watching over my PNL, when I started,
1102.72s: that was the hardest part. I found that just psychologically, like a pressure on me.
1107.60s: Yeah. I got used to that. That was fine. But then when I entered the competition, and this was,
1112.72s: you know, the competition was my professional account. So it wasn't like, I didn't take a small
1117.36s: amount of money and say, hey, let's, let's rocket. It was, I approached it like my, with my
1121.12s: professional funds. That this is how I'm going to trade. And then so suddenly, like the whole
1125.68s: world, or the whole world, whoever's watching the competition, which became very popular because
1129.36s: myself and two or three other guys were really knocking it out of the park with the manager returns.
1134.16s: Suddenly to have this month, the month where it's like, you know, you're trading for money, but
1138.24s: then after saying, oh, but I also, you know, am I out trading the other guy? And I created this
1141.84s: pressure where it's fun, but at the same time, like my aim is supposed to be a profitable trader.
1147.44s: It kind of created a bit of a distraction. That's why I didn't do it in 2021. I said, I want to
1151.12s: kind of like, refocus and a lot of fun, but it creates kind of this like negative pressure in the sense.
1156.32s: Right. So that would be the con of the competition. But the pro is that I met some phenomenal people.
1160.72s: So really nice guys and, you know, we still chat together. And so that's been a lot of fun.
1165.36s: Good. That's awesome. That's it. It's funny. You mentioned the part about having kind of a second
1170.56s: set of eyes on just your performance because that's one of the things that my mentor started with
1178.32s: me early on is first he forced me to write out like a trading plan. But then we ended up doing like
1184.72s: a monthly review where it probably obviously nowhere near the same degree as you were, you know,
1189.60s: it's like P&L for a company and they're like probably looking at you every day. But he and I would do
1194.16s: like a monthly review. And I found a lot of stuff that I would rationalize in my head because of
1200.24s: an ego, you know, somebody starts poking holes and you're like, shit, yeah, I'm not making the
1206.08s: greatest decisions here. And I found that to be like actually tremendous growth experience. So
1211.12s: I just resonated with me when you mentioned that, you know, as part of your experience. Did they
1215.76s: was it like a daily, you know, review of your P&L with your boss and then like a weekly or monthly
1222.32s: roll up to your boss's boss or something like that? Or how did that work for you guys?
1227.52s: To be honest, it's funny. Like it was a very laid back experience. As long as you made money,
1231.76s: you could pretty much do whatever you wanted. As long as you were making money and almost every
1237.20s: every day, week, month, I was making money. It was a fairly, at that time, it was a very consistent
1242.24s: type of strategy. Yeah. It's only if you got into like a bit of a drawdown or something where
1246.24s: it'd be a conversation, you know, so that was kind of I remember 2010 for me was a really big year.
1251.44s: It was probably as big as almost as big as my 2020 year. And so then, you know, whenever you have
1257.60s: high fat, the experience, whenever I have a lot of big returns, then after that's where I would get
1261.12s: hit because you know, you get maybe over confident or you get a little bit a cocky or now you're just
1266.56s: so blindsided by profit. Like your your mindset's not in a good place. And so then after obviously
1272.16s: that volatility returns, they said, well, we don't care what you made last year. It's one to remind you.
1275.20s: That was last year's profits. Now this is a new year. So I had, you know, a bit of talking to it.
1279.68s: And boy, words like, okay, like, no, in your mind, it's like, well, I made all this money last year.
1283.60s: So if I give a little bit of average it out. Yeah, we know that I know, no, no, that was a company that
1288.00s: was already last year's earnings. This is a new year that we don't care about last year anymore.
1292.08s: Right. So I learned, you know, my buddy told me it was the guy who sat next to me and that's like,
1297.04s: you're only as good as your last trade, Matt. I always remember that. So just never, never blow up
1301.36s: because they don't care what you did before. It's what you what have you done for me lately, kind of.
1304.88s: Yeah, man, what a, that's crazy to me. Like, I get it. But like, as I don't know, like,
1311.44s: I'm a lifetime retail trader. So if I have a down year, as long as it doesn't hit like my
1316.32s: cager too hard, you don't even mean it, like down years might happen. So it's just, that's an
1321.84s: interesting perspective where you might just knock it out of the park. And then the next year,
1325.04s: like, what the hell's wrong with you guys? Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. That's wild.
1329.92s: Yeah. All right. So we talked a little bit about your backgrounds. I would love to know just a
1337.52s: little bit more about your participation in the championship. So what was your general approach
1345.04s: during that? And again, just for my own edification, what was like the time frame that you guys
1349.36s: were trading like, how long does that championship go for? So it's the full year. So it's from
1353.44s: January 1st to December 31st. Okay. Got it. And so that was you said 2020, yeah? That's right.
1359.44s: Okay. So what was like, what was your approach when January 1st, whatever the first trading day was,
1366.16s: you know, what were you thinking to start that championship? How were you going to crack the knot?
1371.76s: You know, my goal is really just to, to, to, you know, that's the funny thing with the market,
1376.64s: you know, is you could think it's not like sports, or I'm going to try extra hard to make it work.
1381.84s: In the market, I found just being as disciplined as possible is just your best chance. I mean,
1385.92s: the market may be conducive to your strategy that year or may not because sometimes, you know,
1390.96s: you're not a bad trader. It's just the strategy you're implementing. This current market environment
1395.20s: is not great, but you know, over the next five years, you can make a ton of money, but over these
1398.64s: three months, it's not. So really, my goal is just to be as disciplined as possible and just
1403.44s: really make sure I apply my strategy to a key. And it was just a great year for it. And I,
1409.60s: the only difference is I started the year flat. So with no positions, usually I'm always trading my
1413.36s: circle camera really started at zero and and take it from there. So there's no impact of like
1417.20s: last year's decision making. And worked out really well. I was, you know, I think there was two
1424.00s: big things that really worked in my favor that helped me to make the, you know, the monster
1427.52s: results were just basically I was actually in Florida on vacation in February when COVID was
1432.32s: starting. And all of my rules had me get the cash. And so I still remember, you know, like my wife
1437.04s: was at the beach with the kids and I, you know, I'd go up in the afternoon. Sorry, one of my son
1440.64s: would sleep in the afternoon. So I'd go with him to my wife would be at the beach or the pool.
1444.56s: And I was have CNBC on and see that that was down a thousand points a thousand every day. And I was
1448.72s: like, it was incredulous to just see the market get smacked every day. Yeah. So to being 100% cash was
1454.72s: it was a big advantage. I was already up in January and then full cash. And then right near the lows,
1461.52s: we know my understanding of monetary policy to Federal Reserve, I remember it was, I think,
1466.64s: it was I think a day off the low. And when the, when the Fed came in and said, you know, we're
1470.00s: bringing race to zero, we're doing QE, we're making reserve requirements. Zero, I told my wife,
1474.16s: it was a Sunday night. I said, that's it. The bear markets over. I said, come on, the world's
1478.08s: shutting down around us. There's no bull market coming. I said, the bear market is over. That's
1481.84s: what the Fed's doing. And then technically, my technical tools triggered a couple of days later,
1486.16s: because I'll always wait for my tech. And it's so it's like, I said, you know, it doesn't make any
1489.84s: sense. The world is in a chaos, but the Federal Reserve is super accommodative. My tools are telling me,
1495.36s: it's a new bull market. And I sat there and I told myself, you know, what are the stocks that
1500.40s: are going to most benefit from the situation? I actually went back to like the 1914 World War One
1504.24s: Era, because I said, this is a health war. And so I looked at like the steel stocks from, from,
1508.24s: you know, 1914, Bethlehem Steel as an example of what to expect. And I was able to key on like,
1513.84s: some really stocks that would really benefit for like Lavango was for health. Fastly was an internet
1518.88s: provider play. And man, you know, the trade desk was a digital advertising, you know, everything that
1523.84s: would benefit from being at home. And kind of like everything in the strategy really fell together.
1529.12s: It was like Monster Run. So that was, that's really, it was really just a matter of applying the
1532.96s: strategy. I didn't do anything for an extra. I didn't, some people think, did you go extra leverage?
1538.00s: Like, this is my, my livelihood. I don't have a plan B. So I can't say I know to win this competition.
1543.44s: I'm going to risk my, my family's, you know, money situation, you know, so it was really just
1548.32s: being disciplined, but, you know, also being aggressive. Right. That, that makes a ton of sense. So
1554.56s: when like what were some of the indicators that you saw that made you make that transition to cash?
1560.32s: Because I think that obviously that was a fantastic call. But I am curious what led you to that,
1568.32s: to that decision and kind of like when, when did that, you know, when did those pieces line up
1574.24s: that you're like, okay, time to go to cash? So there's really three basic things that I'll work
1579.28s: with to go to cash. One is your own positions, how they're acting. So because I came into the year
1584.08s: without any positions, I had like, I had one really good trade early in the year. I think I,
1588.40s: I mean, like brought my account up 20%, but I close that out. And then all the new trades I initiated
1593.28s: started to break down. And then, but rather initiate new trades, you know, William O'Neill
1599.04s: tracks what he called distribution day. So he looks at the market index to see if there's,
1602.88s: you know, increase selling on down days to see if there's a shift of what institutions are doing.
1607.60s: And that was picking up at the same time. I look at, yeah, I don't want to get too technical.
1613.36s: But each day, there's a number of stocks making new highs, 52 week highs, a number of stocks make
1617.92s: new 52 week lows. So like never to climb or something like that. Yeah, but it's really,
1621.84s: yeah, that's similar, but it's really looking at 52 week highs versus also. So when there's more
1625.84s: stocks making lows and highs, that's a negative. And if you get three days in a row, for me,
1630.24s: that's that's a big negative. And right near the top, that's what that's what was really key about
1634.72s: that market in 2020 is everything started to break down. Like it wasn't like, oh, you know,
1638.96s: this sector's a little bit weak. It was like, no, it's cross the board selling. So that cross the
1642.32s: board selling and my own, you know, recent sellouts of my stocks was just had me and cash. I said,
1647.84s: there's no there's no reason to be long. And I was able to just sit back and and see the the
1652.48s: carnage from the sidelines. And when you're trading during this championship, is are there
1657.84s: limitations on the products you can trade or can you trade equities, can you trade derivatives,
1662.16s: or how does that work? So different categories. I was in stock category. So stock only you could
1667.04s: use leverage margin, but you know, standard, whatever your broker up, you know, provides nothing
1671.44s: abnormal. And but only equity. So I, you know, there's no options, no futures or anything. And then
1677.04s: can you trade both sides? Can you be long in? And okay, got it. So during the the COVID drop,
1683.28s: when you get that sort of indicator, that's like, okay, you know, we're seeing 52 week highs and
1688.72s: lows and, you know, just a breakdown between what you typically look for there. Did you start
1693.92s: saying and your positions, obviously like you're, you know, citing where we're looking hurt other
1698.24s: than that one outlier that was performing? Did you say, I'm going to trade the short side here,
1704.96s: or did you just say, I'm going to wait and see how this thing pans out?
1708.96s: You know, to be honest, I'm not a good short side trader. So I think I think we have to all know
1712.88s: our strengths and weaknesses like my first year trading pro was 2008. So the financial crisis,
1718.24s: I had a good year, especially for a first year in office, like pro trading. I think I traded
1723.12s: the long side that entire year. I just, you know, I was always, you know, pick my positions,
1727.92s: pick my spots, you know, short term. I did some shorting, you know, like I have my technical tools,
1732.32s: but I don't personally feel comfortable. I think the main reason for me is it's always
1738.80s: appealed to me what's called the asymmetry, you know, so, you know, on the upside, you could have
1743.76s: a 5% loss is where you see, look, I'll get out, but I have a stock that can potentially go
1748.00s: 50, 100, 200%. On the short side, what's great about the short side is it happens fast. So if you're
1753.68s: right, it's like, you know, wow, big profits quickly, but a stock is going to break down what, 10, 20,
1758.88s: 30%, you can't get a 300% drop. The stock gets zero by then, you know, so, so for me, like the
1764.56s: risk reward, I just prefer that long side. And I think I'm an optimistic person by nature. So I like
1770.40s: to always feel things will improve and get better at some point. So I don't like living in that
1775.44s: negative, you know, world of trying to be short. I'd rather pick my points and try and get
1779.44s: longer, be cash and just get ready for the next, you know, upleg. That's my personality.
1783.76s: So if you play crabs, you pay the pass line, you don't play the dumb pass. I don't know,
1787.28s: you can't craft, but that's, you know what, I've been trading my whole life. And unless it
1791.28s: besides a bit of poker with friends, to go somewhere where I have a negative edge, a negative
1794.72s: expectancy and put my on the table, it goes against everything I believe in. I want to be the casino.
1799.28s: I don't want to play in the casino. That's not a big craps player. It makes it sound a sense.
1804.24s: Yeah, that's, that's a big thing in crabs anyways. The pass line is what the whole tables
1809.76s: typically rooting for and the dumb pass typically is playing with the house essentially.
1815.52s: Okay. But yeah, that's funny. So the, it's interesting that you say that because I actually,
1825.20s: I almost always have some sort of short market deltas on, but they're always painted against
1831.92s: a generally long disposition portfolio. So it's, it's interesting. For me, if I'm shorting something
1839.44s: that's going to be via like short calls, I have tried shorting stock a couple times and I,
1845.60s: I don't like it. I don't like just the carrying cost. And then sometimes I don't know, it's probably
1851.60s: just because I'm relatively new to it. But the liquidity part freaks me out sometimes.
1857.84s: You know, if it starts to dry up, I'm just, so I tend to avoid that.
1864.64s: Okay. It's funny what you mentioned though, because I remember once I was having a discussion with
1869.44s: the higher ups of the bank and we were just talking back and forth and you were talking about,
1873.76s: you know, there was a very small options trading a team, much smaller than the equities. And I
1879.60s: remember asking, you know, I said, you know, how the performing well, I mean, you, you,
1882.56s: you, you have a preference to yourself stocks, you know, options like, no, it's like I'm more stock
1886.40s: guy, but we like having the options guy. They don't do exceptionally great. Whenever there's a
1890.32s: really bad marketer steep decline, the options guys almost are always like, you know, are always
1894.88s: positioned to make more money if the markets are dropping, you know, for all the reasons of how
1898.88s: options are pricing on the way things change, you know. So it's like, it's kind of like always a good
1902.96s: hedge to the equated vision. So it's funny that, you know, the way you think is really
1907.36s: typical of an option straighter, I guess, or someone with that dual personality of options and equities.
1912.48s: That, but that's exactly it is. I'm sure you've heard the saying, but you know, the markets crash
1917.12s: down not up. So it's always having something ready for that crash down. It's, to me, it's interesting
1923.68s: because the during the, you know, the bull market post, oh, eight, that was a tough trade to keep on
1930.16s: because after a while, you're like, okay, well, it wasn't a row. Okay, but yeah, it's like four
1935.60s: years in a row, you're getting killed on this thing and you're like, come on, give me a payout
1940.16s: here, but when it does hit, it typically is pretty nice. So when the market, you know, going back
1948.80s: to the COVID drop, working capitulated, you saw the stuff come out with the Fed, obviously,
1954.96s: big daddy J pal turned on his printer and just let that thing go into overdrive. That's right.
1961.12s: So what kind of other than the Fed's statements, what technical tools were you looking at that
1968.32s: started making you comfortable with like your reentry post COVID? So when the Fed statement came out,
1974.64s: I always use the technical side to confirm my bigger thoughts. So I'm just a natural, I guess,
1980.96s: strategist. So you know, even when I was, even I was day trading, I was always reading like macro
1985.28s: news or company news, but, but, you know, I always use the technicals to confirm whatever my thoughts
1990.32s: are because you can have this great idea and be totally wrong. And it's such a, it could be such a
1995.12s: a well-argumented argument. I mean, if you go online, you read some stuff on different websites
1999.84s: and they say, wow, this guy is, he's thought of everything and then he's dead wrong. You know, so I
2004.00s: find the market will always surprise you. So even though all that came out by the Fed, I was waiting
2008.72s: for the fall through day, which again, William O'Neill teaches in his book, a very simple concept.
2013.04s: Basically, what he looks for is, you know, the first two or three days after market bottom,
2017.84s: you can't really look at those to confirm a new uptrend because that could be short covering.
2021.12s: Just people can't say I got to get out. But starting on the fourth day or later, if you get a
2025.20s: day with a market's up like, you know, one in a quarter, one and a half percent or more, and with
2029.20s: increasing volume, that's a sign that institutions are confident to come back into the market and you
2033.52s: may have the beginning of a new bull market. So when I saw all that Fed news, I was really waiting for
2038.56s: that fall through day or net new highs to come out. When I got the fall through day, at that same
2043.20s: time, I saw all these great setups and these, again, these stocks that would benefit from stay at
2047.04s: home and it was like the perfect textbook setup. And that really is what it would allow me to get
2051.28s: in there aggressively. And just a personal question I have for you out of curiosity. You're in this
2058.32s: championship, you know, markets going to hell, you decided to go to cash. How did that feel?
2064.24s: Because I imagine my mind would be racing like, oh my, you know, other people are shorting right now,
2069.20s: you know, other people are making money. Or were you just more focused on this is my real money.
2074.32s: So I'm going to do what I need to do to protect my real money irrespective of, you know, the impact
2079.44s: of the championship here. Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, that brings up a really good point,
2084.24s: though, you know, this whole, this whole idea of the championship and, and, you know, some people
2087.84s: say their changes for fun or I mean, but the championship was real money. But obviously, I don't
2092.16s: know other participants to what degree they're invested. I mean, the statements I'm handing in
2096.64s: are my company statements, you know, I don't know what everyone else is handing in, you know,
2100.00s: I think the minimum is 20,000 or something. I'm not sure if there's just somewhat of a minimum. But
2104.64s: that really goes back to I think people underestimate what it's like to trade for a living, you know,
2109.76s: for even out of the bank, especially now that I trade my own capital, there are so many different
2114.88s: pressures that people don't realize because if that's the full time job and you have a trading
2118.72s: account, nobody wants to lose money. But at the end of the day, if you mess up, you're still going
2122.80s: to be able to eat that night. You're still going to get paid, you know, and for myself, when I'm trading
2127.52s: for a living, you know, the first of all, there's a higher tax rate because now this is your income,
2132.16s: right? So you have higher tax rate, which is against you. Your capital, you can't use for other things
2136.56s: in life using it for this. And if you go into drawdown, every time you go into drawdown, that's
2140.80s: less buying power to make more money in the future. That impacts all your future income. And
2145.04s: then on top of that, you have your living expenses that come out of your trading. So there's a lot
2148.80s: of hurdles and a lot of pressures that you have trading for a living that don't exist when you're
2153.52s: trading part time. So maybe just because I'm used to that. And so in the championship, I just,
2159.28s: you know, it's just like, look, this again, discipline, execute your strategy, even though other people
2163.60s: are doing whatever they're doing, be diligent, be disciplined. And because again, I can't
2169.20s: risk blowing up everything just for a championship. But there's really that a really big difference
2173.60s: between trading pro and trading as a side business, just like drastically different on the mentality and
2178.64s: the psychology. Yeah, it makes it sound a sense. I was curious because, and it's, I really resonated
2185.04s: with me when you started talking about some of the impacts of the championship, you know, just on your
2190.40s: mental approach to the markets because like by nature, I am just a hyper competitive human being.
2197.84s: So, you know, during the COVID drop for me as a retail trader, I literally couldn't have cared
2205.28s: less zero difference. Like, you know, I had some positions that were hurt and real bad. I had
2210.08s: other stuff that was doing just fine. And it was all whatever because I knew if I needed to roll
2215.68s: in managed positions sooner because I was mostly trading index ETFs. I was trading like I WM.
2221.04s: So, I didn't care, right? If I have to wait three years for it to make a move and whatever, fine.
2227.68s: But if I was in a championship, my mind would be racing. It would be what am I not doing that? You
2234.00s: know, other people are doing to take advantage of this site. I actually think it's really impressive,
2238.64s: you know, that you're able to balance the pressure of trading, you know, for your livelihood. But
2244.80s: then also keeping keeping really your priorities in place despite that competitive environment.
2250.24s: That's that's really impressive. But I think that also highlights a really important skill set that
2255.12s: you've developed over time as a trader, right? Which is to be less mentally perturbed by the market
2260.48s: moves and staying disciplined. So, it's it's an interesting, yeah, it's an interesting culmination of
2265.44s: that. You know, I think it's really it's really interesting that all the traders I know, like the
2269.52s: guys I traded with or even other that I've met through, you know, online and stuff. People who trade
2274.80s: for a living or or have traded, let's say even if you don't trade for a living, but you trade
2277.76s: aggressively for many, many years. It's funny. We can't tend to have a lot of similarities in how we
2284.08s: view the world, how we think, even in politics, very similar views, like it and it's like really
2290.16s: strange, like you're really become the subset. I think it's the market kind of forced you to be a
2295.68s: very independent person, self reliant, confident. You have to read between the lines. You need a new
2302.72s: statement that comes out, what does that person really trying to say? You know, or is it a CEO trying to
2306.64s: make a bad situation look good? You have to be resourceful. You know, you only have so many funds.
2311.04s: You got to make these work. You know, what are your costs? How do I grow this? So, I mean, I think
2315.60s: that's why even yourself as as a as a Marine is, you know, it's these are the things that
2320.16s: are trying to instill with you. And I always I always compare the markets with battle with war.
2326.32s: I mean, the book, the battle for investment survival by Gerald Lowe, which is one of the classics.
2332.64s: I find that's probably the best titled book of any book because it's like, you know, for investment,
2337.60s: it's really a battle for investment survival. The market's a hard place. I mean, if you're going to buy
2341.60s: stocks, I'll this for a tie from 40 years out and buying AT&T. Okay, you'll do all right. I mean,
2346.40s: but that's that's not active investing. I really want like that's not a business. That's the same
2351.20s: like buying a condo and renting it out. You're not you can't say you're you're running a real estate
2355.04s: company. You know what I mean? So, so you know, so most traders that psychology, what it builds into
2361.12s: because of the the adversity and and you know, there's months where the market is hurting you and
2366.08s: you have to get the confidence to come back and it really creates a specific unique set of still
2371.28s: skills mindset that I think now I was you know, talking with my wife and some friends and with all
2377.60s: this COVID stuff and some people are down and having a hard time and and you start to realize when
2382.80s: when you're through always dealing with your day job where it's there's an adversary kind of like
2387.28s: attacking you all the time. You kind of become almost numb to it as part of life and I got to
2391.76s: get over this and it's just another hurdle to success. But then you know, you kind of realize that
2396.08s: that's not normal for most people that's not that's not that's not most people's day-to-day life.
2401.20s: You know, they have a nice job and and that's great. It's just a choice of livelihood. But the skill
2406.16s: sets that now we develop as active investors is a and I think it makes you a very strong
2413.04s: independent, confident human being. So if you can get through all the adversity,
2417.12s: much like I'm sure like if you can get through Marine Bootcamp, you come out the other side
2420.72s: a different person, a stronger person. You know, so that's I think that's something that
2424.08s: that's a life skill that you get that you won't you don't even know that you're going to get by
2428.16s: getting into this. I think that that's a huge point and I think that another thing that I would add
2433.68s: on that I find that most traders identify very closely with not always the same approach but
2440.32s: the way that we perceive and assess risk is very different than most other categories that I see
2447.84s: and I find that to be useful just in general life, right? I mean, even using COVID as an example.
2453.36s: You know, there's different perceptions of the risk and the way that we mitigate the risk.
2458.88s: And I think trading at least for most of the traders that I've had the pleasure of talking with
2465.36s: in terms of approach, risk assessment is always something that's top of mind. It's not always,
2471.60s: you know, a huge concern, but definitely top of mind. And then the other thing that
2476.16s: that you were saying that really resonated with me was just the the concept I haven't met a
2482.00s: successful trader that's been in the business for a longer a decade that isn't disciplined.
2486.24s: I haven't found one. I found a couple that were really lucky early on and then they stopped,
2492.00s: which you can consider that discipline of some sort. But, you know, I've met some people like that
2496.80s: that just hit a good bankroll early on and then switched to long-term investing and, you know,
2501.84s: let that sit. But I haven't met an active trader that's been at it longer a decade that hasn't
2507.04s: learned discipline and the ability to follow a plan. So something I'm curious about with you is
2515.44s: you were talking a bit about institutions driving trends. This is a little bit of a nuanced question,
2522.32s: but I'm just curious your take on it. What do you think about dark pools?
2528.56s: Well, in what sense? I mean, I'm curious. So to just give, you know, for the for anybody that's
2534.96s: listening that may not be familiar, essentially dark pools are a way for large institutions to
2541.44s: send block trades through. And obviously they'll have a pretty significant impact if they were
2547.28s: traded on the open market. It may not be able to get a full fill, prices be all over the place,
2550.96s: all that kind of stuff. But one of the main benefits to dark pools is a little bit of obscurity and,
2557.04s: you know, movement. And I'm curious when you're going through using institutions, it seems institutional
2564.40s: volume is like part of your information data gathering, these decisions off of how do do dark pools,
2570.56s: you know, factor into that at all, or since they're not traded on the open market, are they things
2575.60s: that exist, you know, they exist, but they don't necessarily impact your deployment as a trader.
2581.28s: From myself personally, I don't think it really impacts what I'm doing. That's really, I think the
2585.60s: biggest impact there is if you're a very short-term trader, like what I was doing,
2590.24s: market-making, pro-training, there's more of an impact significant. But, you know, most institutions,
2595.52s: they're going to cut up their orders. They're never going to go to one venue, you know? So dark pools
2599.04s: is going to be one venue they're going to go to. And look, I mean, I don't have the stats behind me to
2603.44s: go over all this, but like, you know, basically, let's say they even descend 20% to dark pools. That's
2608.48s: probably going to be like across the board, going to be a consistent number. So, you know, the majority of
2613.20s: the volume is still going to trade on the open markets. And at the end of the day is that demand and
2617.68s: supply, you know, if that, if the sellers are being absorbed by these big buyers, that's going to come
2621.20s: through an increase in volume. And I'm looking more for, you know, trends that last, you know, several weeks,
2626.96s: at least two months. And so that very small nuance is not going to really hide the fact if you're,
2632.40s: if you're the fidelity-contra fund, you're $130 billion fund. You want to have 1% of your portfolio
2637.44s: in one stock. That's $1.3 billion. And the market cap on that portfolio is $20 billion. So, that's
2642.48s: you need to buy 5% of that company. The fact that there's dark pools or not is not going to impact that,
2647.44s: you know, it's not going to stop the impact that you're going to have in that stock price. That's not
2650.88s: it. Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. And that leads me to my follow-on question. And you've answered
2655.52s: some of it, but I'm curious, you know, a more specific answer. So, like, obviously, the time frame
2661.76s: impact is different. What time frame are you normally looking at if there is a normal for you, or does
2667.28s: it vary widely? And if so, what does that range look like? So, I mean, if I get into a stock and if
2672.32s: falls tomorrow and gets me out, I'll be out tomorrow. But my holding period, my aim is going to be
2678.48s: at least four to six weeks up to nine months or so. That's that's what I'm looking to. You know, if the
2683.28s: trade is successful, it's going to be six to nine months if it's a real rocket trade. If it's
2688.08s: mediocre, and I'm taking my profits, because it's not going to be the big move that I was expecting,
2692.40s: I'm probably in there for four or five weeks, and I'm taking my profits. So, that's kind of
2696.80s: the two sides of what I'm probably doing, typically. Got it. Okay. And to start with just the risk
2703.04s: understanding first, when you find a stock that you're interested in, what is your general
2708.08s: approach to deciding how you're going to manage risk in it? So, the way I've developed my strategy
2713.76s: over the years, the way I deploy my risk now is every trade has the same risk all the time.
2718.72s: My position is standard. Regardless of the charter, the volatility, I have a fixed maximum loss
2725.20s: that I'll take. That's a fixed amount of my account. And I'll build my position over time. So,
2730.24s: that's also a way for me to avoid gap down risk. So, let's say I want to have, I'm a concentrated guy,
2736.80s: I'm an aggressive guy. If I have a third of my account in a stock, I don't want to do that day one,
2740.80s: because if I do day one and they announce, you know, we expect sales, you know, sometimes there's
2745.44s: an early announcement, sales are going to be a little lower than we expect that we open down 20%,
2748.88s: I'm going to get hit pretty hard. So, if I want to get that 30% exposure in a stock, I'll do it
2754.32s: over a number of days or a couple of weeks so that it's going my way and I have some profit cushion
2758.88s: to buffer my initial capital at risk. But even as I do that, my maximum risk will stay the same.
2765.44s: So, I end up using kind of open profits to finance additional risk.
2769.12s: Got it. So, when you're looking at, that's an interesting perspective. So,
2776.16s: if the position side is generally standard, you know, again, regardless of the product,
2781.68s: are you using, I assume, then just like a percentage of the position size as your max risk in that position?
2787.68s: So, it's, I just think that kind of unique that for me that I have never seen anyone do,
2793.12s: is I call it the Crucial Dollar Stop. So, basically, I set my name. I love that name.
2798.32s: I got a name. You know, it's so funny. I created like an investing course and it's all the stuff
2802.88s: I'd been doing for years and you know, when you're teaching someone, you got to name these things.
2807.20s: I'm just horrible. Like, if you look at some of the names, I choose, it's just like literally like
2810.64s: what I think of it, you know, like I have these like, you know, my voodoo tool and the xy.
2816.32s: I have the worst things possible. Anyways, I like that one. Yeah, yeah, I guess, you know,
2821.28s: I'm sure it's out there somewhere, but yeah. So basically, my initial position will be a percentage
2826.48s: of my account, but you know, I'll put in dollar terms day to day so it's easier to deal with.
2830.08s: So, you know, because you know, if I buy in the stock falls x number of dollars, I'm out instead of
2833.76s: calculating a percentage. Got it. As I add to that position, that initial dollar stop doesn't get
2839.68s: bigger just because the position gets bigger. That's a way for me to build a position size would never risk
2846.16s: more than what I initially risk. Got it. And how do you balance, you know, giving the position
2855.76s: a little bit of room to move so that you're not prematurely stopped out with controlling your risk?
2861.04s: Like what's your mindset with that? Yeah. And so that's a good point. And so whenever I make a purchase,
2866.56s: I usually wait for it to advance at least about 5%. You know, so a lot of the stocks I deal with,
2871.20s: you know, this will probably be different if you're dealing with a utility stock or you're dealing with a,
2875.52s: I don't know, a penny stock, you know, which have really different on the two extremes in terms of
2880.16s: volatility. But, you know, for most of the growth stocks, I deal with, I just through, I guess,
2884.40s: experience that I've worked with once it advances 5% or more, if you get another good buy signal,
2890.32s: I have enough breathing space for normal volatility if I add to that position. I just don't
2894.40s: as I used to get in trouble sometimes where I'd buy a stock and go up, you know, one and a half percent
2898.88s: pause and all I got another buy point and, you know, okay, I'll buy some more. So basically, I'm
2902.48s: building this big position all within a one or two percent range. So here by the time I put on a
2907.44s: full position, it's probably advanced 10% from my original purchase. So all of that gain in my
2914.08s: initial low cost buys give me a lot of breathing room for normal volatility. If the stock dropped 20%,
2919.44s: I'm stopped, but that's not a normal downside move for a stock that's in a bull market, you know, so.
2924.08s: Right. Okay. And then when you're deciding, for me, I always term it scaling in, that's actually
2930.48s: a big part of my general approach to is like I come up, I call it like a trade allocation. However,
2936.40s: much money I'm going to put into a specific trade and then I come up with scaling rules. So my
2941.04s: initial outlay will be x percent of that total amount of money and then, you know, initial scale
2945.52s: and from there, which is hard for a lot of people. I mean, like we have a same mindset. Yeah. For most
2950.56s: people who come to the market and I've noticed as I've, you know, interacted with more people is that,
2955.44s: you know, they have a hard time thinking that way for them. It's like I buy and when do I take my
2958.88s: profit to think that you're adding to a stock that you're making money on is a unique mindset that
2964.56s: people have to get used to typically. Yeah. Oh, absolutely. And sometimes it's even difficult, you
2969.52s: know, if you get a big move in your direction and then you're like, you know, what do I do, I just
2974.72s: take this profit and walk away or, but anyways, I'm curious when you're deciding to scale into our,
2982.40s: you know, let's say if the position is moving in your favor, when like how do you approach scaling?
2987.92s: What's your thought process there? So this whole part of it becomes really my technical analysis
2994.16s: base, you know, so I always try and start my positions when the stock is making a larger base.
3001.04s: And what I like to do though is all the swing trading tools, the technical tools that I use for my
3005.68s: years of, you know, being a market maker and pro trader, which are so short term, I use a number of
3010.24s: those tools to keep adding as the stock is breaking out of my direction. So I kind of, I kind of
3015.28s: bring a larger base structure by typing that with smaller type of trading patterns. And I got to
3022.56s: that point because at one point, I remember I was, I think I forgot what it was like I made a
3027.12s: couple of buys, you know, because I, you know, I always ran two strategies, my short term strategies
3030.88s: and my growth portfolio and it's very different kind of logic. And I remember like I take a couple
3036.56s: of losing positions on my growth portfolio. And it's like, I knew when I was putting them on, like,
3041.04s: from a short term basis, I wouldn't be doing this if it was my short. So I had these two sides of my
3045.44s: brain. So I said, you know, if institutions and I see these guys coming in buying every day for three
3049.60s: months, if they can buy every day, why do I feel just because I'm using this strategy, I have to blindly
3054.56s: follow it as I learned it. Why can't I adapt it to all the other tools that I learned that I know
3058.24s: work short term because sometimes I was being stopped out because of a bad short term entry,
3063.44s: but the longer term idea was correct. So I said, look, one of my skills that I've
3067.04s: fortunately developed is a great short term entry pattern. So I, that's how I kind of, at one point,
3072.16s: I said, like, you know, the why don't we like join all the skills that we have instead of keeping
3076.40s: them separated? I love that. I literally love that. That's so one of my favorite strategies that I use,
3082.48s: it's kind of like a, it's a bit of an abomination, but it's like an, in options, we have diagonals.
3090.48s: So a big strategy that my mentor like to use was leap diagonals, then we, you know, add a ratio to it.
3096.80s: But long story short on the strategy, it really capitalizes on a lot of that where the entire base
3104.00s: of the trade is typically over a year in terms of, you know, assessment thinking, you know, from here
3110.32s: to here, we're expecting it to go up or down over the course of a year. But there's a short term
3114.96s: component to that trade. It's one of my favorite trades. And it's, you know, it's designed exactly,
3120.32s: you know, kind of like you're, you're explaining your approaches, which is interesting to hear that
3124.16s: with like an equity's base. I'm fascinated by that. So thinking and just being mindful of your time,
3133.20s: but I would be remiss if I didn't ask a couple of questions about just your general technical approach.
3137.84s: So when you think about, you know, that some of the stocks you're looking at, do you typically
3143.36s: arrive at your stock picks by looking at your portfolio and saying, you know, I need to fill this gap,
3151.04s: whatever, you know, that risk gap looks like if you want a specific product, or are you generally
3156.08s: looking at the market and just saying, well, this looks interesting to me or this looks like an
3160.24s: opportunity. Do you start at the portfolio or do you typically start by looking at the market
3164.88s: and seeing what opportunities are there? So portfolio wise, obviously, I'm a trader, so I always
3169.84s: want to be like 200% invested, right? But so it's I have to always hold myself back. So I usually
3175.20s: use the market in general, like the way I look at new highs and you lows to kind of gauge my
3180.32s: exposure. I have some rules for, you know, should I be fully invested? Should I should I have 30%
3184.64s: cash? I should I be at least 70% cash. So I have kind of a technical gauge just to keep me on the
3190.32s: road instead of being too off of what the market's telling me. But that's kind of like my big picture idea,
3195.44s: but typically what I do is I run a lot of scans to find which stocks have the biggest growth numbers
3200.56s: fundamentally that of those I want to see which are performing the best technically. And then the
3205.60s: market telling you the story, right? So for example, let's say, I don't know, let's think of a company
3210.96s: like, or let's go back to we were talking 2020, you know, like this company Lavango has 200% earnings
3216.08s: growth and it's 5% from its 52 week high. Well, okay, something's going on. The company's obviously
3221.92s: doing it fantastically fundamentally. The market's recognizing that because it's paying up, it's at
3226.56s: 52 week highs. What is going on? So then that's why I like to dive into the story of the company.
3231.44s: You can go to vestrelation website, CEO, read online. And okay, this is what they're doing. And
3236.32s: when you do that enough times, eventually, you know, no company is like an island. You know, if someone
3242.08s: wants to do something, it's usually just a slightly better iteration of something else someone's already
3246.00s: done. And then it's a matter of implementing. So when you do this with company after company after
3249.76s: company, you can have say, like, oh, okay, that's the trend they're working on. And so then after once
3253.60s: once you see that, you start to build a picture of, will this scale? Who else is going to benefit? And
3258.64s: once you build that idea and then after these other companies that you thought would have
3261.76s: benefited start coming and now they have huge monster growth and they're sitting at 52 week highs.
3266.48s: Okay, so I guess that trend. So you want to have an idea that you build with a fundamental
3271.36s: basis, but then you want to have, okay, the market's recognizing it. The funds are paying up for it.
3275.52s: How do I get on board with a good, lower situation? And that's kind of how I bring it together.
3280.16s: I love that. That's that's really a fascinating perspective, especially. I think most of when I venture
3287.12s: into individual stocks, I almost always start with fundamentals just to make sure if it's something
3293.92s: that I get stuck in for a little longer than expected. Because again, for me, if I have to hold on
3297.76s: as something for three years, I really don't care. I'll do it. You know, it is what it is. So figure it out.
3303.12s: Not for me. If I can't use my money, I'm dead. So it's got a worker. It's got to go. Yeah.
3308.24s: So when you're looking at fundamentals, it sounds like you're looking at kind of the very,
3315.84s: I don't want to say stereotypical, but like just common, common concepts, like making sure that
3320.48s: we're generating cash is somehow via earnings per share metrics or revenue, whatever.
3328.32s: Just some sort of valuation metrics there. Are there any other like really fundamental tools
3334.40s: that you like to integrate when you're looking at these stocks? I think, you know, if you boil it down
3340.64s: and you know, you can go into academic papers and people can argue this way that way, but you know,
3345.60s: earnings are what investors are going to pay for. And even if it's not current earnings,
3349.92s: it's future earnings. For example, Amazon for years, everyone argue like, oh, they're barely making
3353.52s: any money. Well, at that time, investors believe though, they spoke, they heard the message from Bezos,
3358.88s: so they said, okay, you don't have great earnings now, but we believe you enough, you're executing
3363.84s: enough on different variables that we're going to put that faith in you. So typically, the earnings
3368.24s: will be present, they'll be booming. The rare exception, that won't be the case, but then at least
3372.24s: sales are going to be booming, right? So I mean, you can, you can say I'll postpone earnings, but you
3376.00s: better be at least selling the product and you get the earnings later when you can, when you have
3379.60s: more pricing power or whatever it is, you know, so those are the two factors I look at either,
3383.60s: you know, record earnings or at least the highest earnings at the past eight or 10 years or at
3387.36s: least record sales or the highest sales of the past eight to 10 years, but growing aggressively.
3392.32s: Now, if you look at a company where this is, well, let's assume it's a younger company, those
3396.40s: usually have the best growth stories. If this is the most money as a company you ever made,
3402.40s: and you're going to grow by another 50% next year, and your sales have been up quarter after quarter,
3406.80s: 40%, you are doing something right. Now, if, if, if, you know, the economy doesn't fall apart or,
3414.56s: or if you don't make a big mistake, you know, as a company and you pivot the wrong way,
3419.04s: you are selling a product that your customers love and you're doing it well. So if you can continue
3424.16s: executing like that, you're going to keep those earnings growing and that's the best candidate to
3428.96s: have huge upside. This is where the asymmetry comes in. If you can find companies that are doing that,
3433.92s: and if you're growing aggressively, your stock price is going to advance aggressively. So your
3437.84s: upside is huge because if you compound earnings growth of 30% over four or five years and institutions
3443.44s: pay up, you're going to get hundreds of percent return. But if you're wrong in your discipline,
3447.92s: you're going to lose what, three, four percent of your of your trade. So it gives you the chance to
3452.56s: find a stock that has this huge runway that you can potentially really significantly, you know,
3457.52s: build with position building, like we mentioned, scale into size. And if you're right, you have this
3461.92s: massive upside. But if you're wrong, okay, I lost, I lost what I was willing to lose for this trade,
3466.24s: I can move on. So that asymmetrical setup, you could be wrong at the end of the year, you could be
3470.80s: wrong seven out of 10 times and have a great year. Right. So it's just a different, which when I was
3476.32s: day trading, it was the opposite. I probably had a success ratio of north to 50%, but the gains
3481.52s: were small, wins were small. So there's not a one perfect way to trade, but this is the strategy I'm
3486.64s: using now. And that's the logic behind it. I think for most retail investors, that's, you know,
3492.64s: the best way to approach the market because that asymmetry is huge and you catch one in video or
3498.24s: Apple and you're retired, you know, it's, it's interesting. So many thoughts coming to my mind when
3504.96s: you say that because I feel like for most retail traders, lower risk, high return is very appealing,
3512.48s: which is, you know, a version of, you know, what you're discussing. We essentially want to control
3516.72s: risk to the downside fairly tightly, but give ourselves runway to the, to the, to the upside.
3521.12s: When I always feel like retail traders, fuck it up for themselves because when you look at like the
3527.36s: behavior of even there's a couple white papers that I really like. One of them is individual investor
3533.04s: behavior and it was by the university, California, Berkeley. And it talked about the propensity for
3540.56s: retail traders to let losers run and cut winner short. Literally, they have the idea that you do,
3547.76s: but they don't have the discipline to make it happen. What was, I don't know, your approach to allow,
3555.52s: I always feel like cutting losers, you know, it's, it's difficult, but once you get used to it,
3560.56s: it is what it is. It's part of the business. But I find when I talk to people, one of the more
3565.68s: difficult components, when we, once we get the risk under control is letting winners move. How do
3571.76s: you arrive at that? Like what's your approach to letting some of these trades run, you know, 30%,
3578.16s: 50%, 100%, you know, whatever you're seeing, how do you, you know, force yourself to keep your
3582.64s: hands out of it and say, nope, I'm going to let this run. This is my strategy.
3587.36s: And it's hard because for example, in 2020, LaVongo was my best, my best trade and that was up about
3592.40s: 400%. So when you're already up 100% to, to let it ride and you have 200, it's very hard, but, you know,
3597.92s: I was, and this concept you bring up is as old as investing is because if you read the book,
3604.72s: reminisces of a stock operator, I don't think I've ever read that book. Jesse Livermore,
3608.80s: that's written in 1927. And he's saying that, you know, men should, should fear when they hope,
3613.60s: and they should hope when they fear, which is, yeah, people do the, because I think it's just that
3616.48s: human nature of, it's going to come back. And when you're making money, oh, no, I'm scared, I'm
3620.96s: losing my profit. It's just, it's weird psychological, you know, block that almost most people have.
3626.32s: Yeah. And another, another part of it is that people don't like to be wrong. So if you're making
3631.44s: money and you take your profit, you're right. If you're losing money, but I don't sell, you're not
3635.68s: yet wrong. You are wrong. The, Mark, your broker will tell you wrong. The money's gone there,
3639.36s: but it feels like you're not wrong. Right. So I think I'm very, very, very fortunate that the first
3645.28s: book that appealed to me was how to make money and stocks by William O'Neill because he really explained
3648.96s: it in such a way that it made so much sense to me logically from day one that, that it became part
3655.28s: of my DNA as a trader. And that's probably why, you know, you look at most traders, even professionals,
3659.52s: a lot of them had a period where they blew up. I never blew up because I never broke the cardinal rule
3663.76s: of risk, a limiting risk. And he just really made it, he made it, he made it sound so simple.
3667.92s: He, I think he was a, was it the dress story I think he told you, he's like, let's say you're a
3671.36s: businessman and you have, you buy a red and yellow dresses and the yellow dresses are not selling
3676.00s: and the red dresses, you're sold out. But what are you going to do? You're going to discount the yellow
3679.68s: dress just to get rid of it. And you take that money and you're going to buy some more red dresses.
3683.84s: And I just said, you know, I don't know, they just, just clicked with me. I said, yeah, the stock's not
3687.60s: trading. They're just, there's something wrong with it. Take it out and write, approach like a
3691.12s: businessman rather than a gambler, let's say that, come on, you got to come back. Like people,
3696.64s: because it's, it's buying and selling and numbers are flashing, it has that gambling component.
3701.36s: Of course. Yeah. And it's very easy that the line is very fine. It's more about how you
3706.48s: treat it than what it is, whether it's gambling or or investing or a business. But if, if logically,
3712.16s: you could approach it like a business person, then it totally makes sense to, hey, what's not
3717.04s: working? Get rid of it and start focusing on what's working because any business person in any
3721.20s: business ever that was successful focused on what was executing in the company and getting rid of
3725.84s: it. But what wasn't? So I think if you just look at it from that perspective and you really
3730.16s: internalize that idea in your mind, you won't, you won't be hoping anymore. So you'll just, again,
3735.76s: that, that just resonated with me from day one. So I had that out of me. And some people are going
3740.56s: to have to work through that psychologically. But once you get that inside you and inside your
3744.80s: mindset, it's going to, it's, for me, it's impossible to go the other way. I just, I can't sit,
3749.60s: when I see a stock turn red and I'm bleeding money, it, like, it just me to get rid of it. And
3754.08s: mostly the opposite. So I think it's just a mindset you have to build. That's awesome. Yeah. That's
3759.28s: just a really powerful story. And I really like that analogy because I am one of those idiot traders
3765.84s: that at one point had to go through that, you know, Phoenix from the Ash's bit where nearly,
3771.52s: nearly imploded. But I'm, you are very rare exception to that. And it's actually really awesome
3777.20s: to hear how you're able to do that. That's pretty, that's pretty impressive to me. Okay, so I have
3783.60s: one other question again. I don't want to take up too much your time. I really appreciate chat
3787.36s: with you. 2022. Yeah. Hell of a year coming up, especially here in the US, you know, we're talking
3795.12s: about three to four interest rate rises. One of them starting as early as March, they're talking
3800.32s: about easing the quantitative easing bond, but all these sorts of things. I am really curious
3805.92s: just what your general hypothesis is for the markets, you know, heading into 2022. Obviously,
3814.40s: just based into discussion on what we know right now, which is what 18 Jan and everything is subject
3820.32s: to change based on new information, all that stuff. A lot of people get really wrapped around
3824.00s: the axle and somebody's like, well, you said this. And it's like, yeah, I said that three weeks ago,
3828.00s: should change it. Stay with the times here. You know, I'm not an analyst. I'm an investor trader.
3833.28s: So if I said something, you know, what's the saying? You know, like, I can't remember now. I'm trying to
3838.16s: think, you know, I have very strong opinions, very weekly held. You know, it means like, I'm on something.
3844.24s: Yeah. Yeah. When I'm really onto something, like, I'm going to be in there, I'll position my account,
3847.12s: but if that's in work, like, oh, maybe I'm wrong. And I think flexibility is important. Yeah.
3851.12s: I love it. So I agree. You know, so what my outlook, if I'm reading the, you know, the market,
3856.24s: as I see it now, the Federal Reserve, wanting to raise rates is the elephant in the room. The
3861.36s: Federal Reserve is always the elephant. Actually, but, you know, but the thing is, there's, it's rare
3866.48s: that the Federal Reserve is making big moves. So 2020 forced their hand and now inflation is forcing
3870.88s: their hand again, usually in the mean time between major tightening or losing policies, you kind of
3876.08s: don't hear from them very much. So the day it's, you know, day to day is normal. But with them wanting to
3880.56s: raise rates aggressively, that's definitely going to put pressure on the market. I mean, you're pulling
3884.88s: money out of the market. The lifeblood of the market is money and you're taking money away because
3888.64s: you're making money more expensive. But the other side of that coin as well is whenever you raise
3892.96s: your lower interest rates, you change which sectors are going to be attractive for institutional
3897.12s: investors within the market. That's why you're seeing technology get killed and energy is,
3902.00s: and other things are so strong because of inflation and all that. I think those trends are going to
3905.92s: persist. The trade I'm most excited about now is probably the oil trade. Oh, interesting. I think,
3912.40s: again, this kind of goes back funnily enough, funny enough to my early years where again,
3916.40s: resource companies and my global macro perspective. But, you know, so many oil come to really beat up
3921.04s: last year, well, now two years ago, 2020, because oil was negative at one point in the March contract.
3926.40s: They couldn't find storage for it. So, you know, when you're going to, you know, this is a way I kind
3930.40s: of build my overall thesis, right? So when I'm approaching the markets and I always time it technically.
3935.28s: So the feds raising rates, that makes companies with current real earnings more attractive. You know,
3940.72s: if rates are going up and you're a tech stock promise me earnings 10 years from now,
3944.72s: well, as rates are higher, it's more expensive for me to sit there and wait for those earnings.
3948.72s: So that's why that attract them. This shifts from high PE lower no earning stocks to lower PE
3955.92s: higher. That's why that's the sector switch that the flows will be towards energy, I believe.
3961.04s: A second reason I like energy is there are in the current oil environment, they're basically
3965.20s: printing money. The profits are huge. Some of these companies are making record earnings already.
3971.60s: They're very reluctant, especially American, shale producers are very reluctant to put out
3976.08s: the more oil rigs to take out more oil rigs. They've got slams so hard. A lot of companies
3980.32s: went through a structuring board director says, you're going to be very careful with what capital
3983.92s: you put out because we don't know as COVID going to come back. Are they going to, you know,
3987.84s: keep putting pressure on oil companies for, you know, climate change or whatever. So you're not
3991.68s: going to go out there and put out more drilling unless you're really sure of the demand situation
3997.68s: and the rest. Same with the OPEC countries, exact same situation. In fact, with Russia on the
4002.32s: Ukrainian border, if there's some kind of a conflict, that would even be more pressure on the oil.
4006.56s: So you put all of this together and I think personally, I don't know if you know Peter Lynch,
4012.00s: the great investor, fidelity investor. His ethos was always by what you know, by what you like,
4017.28s: by the products around you. These are these great companies. Well, I don't want to buy anything
4022.32s: right now. What I want to do is I want to go out and live a normal life. I want to travel. I want
4025.68s: to take a drive. And so if the world, I think, come out of this unfortunate situation and depending
4031.76s: where you are, there's still some rather, you know, big restrictions. If everyone starts driving
4035.12s: and flying again, even if it's incrementally, but in that direction, because oil companies and
4040.48s: oil producing nations are so restrictive and careful in putting out new supply, your supply
4046.72s: equation is very tight for oil. That's why you say, President Biden put oil out with the strategic
4051.44s: petroleum reserve. What happened? Oil fell. Whoop, right back up. It was consumed by the markets.
4055.28s: So the more that's telling you the market is already very tight. Supply is very tight. And if that
4060.08s: demand comes on, even if it's two, three, four, five, six months from now, people say that's it.
4064.80s: I want to, I want to take a drive. That increase in demand, I think, could take oil up significant.
4071.36s: And on top of that with inflation, put yourself in the shoes of the old peck nations. Our oil will
4076.80s: still start your car, but your dollar, we can't buy the same amount of bread at the store because
4081.52s: the dollar has been printed. So they're not as willing to accept lower prices for the oil. So
4086.24s: all of this to me provides a backdrop where there's an asymmetric setup on oil. The downsides limited,
4091.76s: maybe my idea could be wrong. Maybe we come down a little bit. But if I'm correct in my analysis,
4096.56s: can you see a hundred dollar plus oil? Absolutely. Sure. And if the oil companies are already doing
4101.52s: great now, well, if oil gets to a hundred plus, they're really going to be killing it. And also,
4106.80s: then if you look at higher rates and institutions moving towards these current earnings type companies,
4112.32s: now I can see this place where this funnel torrent of money can come in these oil stocks that have
4117.68s: been so out of favor for so long. And technically, the action is great. Again, you can have all the idea,
4123.20s: these ideas and pass on them. But for myself, why I'm actually committed, I've been buying oil stocks
4127.76s: for a little while now is technically they're acting great. Who's making 52 week highs? It's not
4133.20s: text stocks this year. So the market is agreeing with me and no one's paying attention because oil is
4138.88s: no longer sexy, right? It's about supposed to be about green investing and all of that. And so it's
4142.80s: kind of abandoned. But when the earnings come, the money will follow. It's just the law of the market.
4148.48s: That's how I'm reading the market. I think you're going to see pressure on general markets in general.
4153.28s: I think probably growth stocks are going to wash out sometime later this year because it's already
4157.60s: year they've topped. I mean, we top basically February 2021 for a lot of growth stocks.
4162.64s: But in the meantime, I think the best upside trades probably oil. Beyond that, I think general
4168.16s: markets gains are going to be limited just because the Federal Reserve is going to be this big weight
4172.08s: on the market. Yeah, I think that's a obviously really comprehensive analysis. I feel like a lot of
4178.72s: what we experienced in COVID was an experiment by the Fed. And I think that we don't know how
4186.16s: the story ends. I'm generally just market bearish like going into this year, not to say that the year
4193.92s: couldn't end up. But I don't think we're seeing 29% return this year, you know, with everything
4199.60s: coming towards us. And it's also interesting that you highlight oil specifically. So I do
4206.32s: a live session pretty much every Monday. And you know, I just bullshit about the markets, whatever.
4211.12s: And anyways, for the last few weeks, I like to pull up a sector performance of the S&P 500.
4219.28s: And just look at it essentially week over week. And energy has been at the top. And, you know,
4224.80s: obviously you've already arrived at that conclusion and have been moving your way into oil. Just an
4229.92s: interesting point. I'm curious your thoughts on with regards to oil. Is your trade hypothesis
4239.44s: something within a year or you expecting slash planning for like a longer term upside to oil?
4246.00s: And I ask that just because for me, I think there definitely is short term potential in oil. But
4252.00s: I really do feel like in a lot of ways its head is on a chopping block. Once we start getting out
4257.20s: like five plus years like way further out in time. I don't think we're getting rid of oil anytime
4260.96s: soon. I think it'll be around for the foreseeable future. But I do feel like they're constantly under
4266.40s: fire for something. So I'm just curious, you know, when you discuss your trade hypothesis,
4272.56s: what's the kind of time frame that you're thinking about? Yeah, it's usually like 12 months out.
4277.52s: Like again, most of my trades are three months to nine months. You know, can they go maybe a year and a
4282.40s: half? Sure. But that's the, you know, the rarity, you know, but that's usually like the wheelhouse.
4287.20s: I like to focus in because once you start getting beyond nine months or more, even if it is a five
4292.24s: year trade, let's let's say you have this great five year vision, you're going to have to sit probably
4296.64s: through some some points where three six nine months with a stock consolidate drops hard under
4301.20s: performs. Again, myself is where this is what I do for a living. I don't have, I don't have the,
4306.48s: you know, the ability to just sit there and say, okay, I'm going to sit here for nine months and
4310.32s: have the stock fall 30% while the S and P.I. But like I'll rotate elsewhere. I just know it's my
4314.56s: personality. And I think at a certain point, you really have to pick what worked for you as a person
4319.28s: and your situation. So that's what works for me. So I'm not, I never myself even focused on
4324.48s: five year projections because it doesn't interest me. I'm a shorter term guy. So,
4327.76s: truly that three nine months, 12 months is the, is there, you know, the wheelhouse I usually focus on?
4332.72s: Got it. Okay. And to wrap up, I do have one last question. I am curious. I think the technical
4340.00s: analysis folks from my community would probably hang me up to die if I didn't ask you this.
4345.76s: When you think about your, you obviously mentioned a few times your technical tools looking for
4352.72s: confirmation. What are your top two or three technical analysis tools that you deploy?
4363.20s: I think critical for me are the bases that William when you'll talk about. I mean, some of them
4369.20s: are even textbook, I mean, technical analysis bases. But there's real specific criteria he provides.
4374.56s: So I think that's just so important to start with on a foundation of which stocks to look at.
4379.36s: I mean, and it's not just the shape of the pattern. People think, you know, it looks like
4384.16s: ahead of shoulders or this or that. There's also depth, you know, requirements that it's got to be
4388.40s: a certain length of time. And the way he got to these parameters is he went back to look at all the
4394.16s: best stocks as they had their major advances in history. And he looked at the basing patterns to
4399.04s: find what are all the commonalities in the minimum criteria because a base, if you're just looking
4402.72s: at a technical price action, you could see that on a five minute chart, you could see it on a
4406.56s: big chart. But if you're looking for these stocks are going to have these explosive runs after being
4411.20s: accumulated by institutions, they have a commonality as to how they form these bases. So that would be
4415.76s: step one as to what I do. I think just, you know, people are varying experience and technical
4422.16s: analysis. Just something basic like the 50 day moving average. Like keep your stocks above the 50 day
4427.44s: moving average for your purchases. I mean, if you're below there, I mean, you're dealing with a
4432.80s: stock that's maybe either in a correction or has already started a downtrend. So just at least above
4436.96s: a 50 day. And beyond that, well, the technical tools, there's many that I use, I probably have to show
4442.08s: you on a chart. But I think there's no real super secret. I picked the ones over the years that are,
4447.28s: I feel are most effective that work best with me for me as well, I would say, but keep a variety. So by
4453.76s: that, I mean, some people let's say like an oscillator, some people like short term chart patterns.
4458.00s: If you have a variety for different types of situations, not every stock advance will be the same.
4462.80s: So for some, sometimes a stock advance is quick and you'll get like a flag pattern because it's a
4467.28s: quick pattern. Sometimes a little bit slower and other patterns will show up. So, you know, if you
4471.76s: have a larger, you know, a diverse set of tools, you'll be able to capture entries on a variety of
4478.40s: type of stock moves. That's the way I would look at it. So awesome. Yeah, that's really helpful. Thank
4483.04s: you. I'd love to, you know, set up another session with you sometime to chat about that a little
4487.44s: bit more. Because I know a lot of people are super interested in that and it would be really cool,
4491.92s: you know, even for me to learn a little bit more about your general technical analysis approach.
4497.20s: Because there's, I'm kind of similar in that way where my, again, most of what I do is via what I
4504.08s: learned from, from that mentor of mine, I mentioned him so frequently not to talk about it. Like,
4509.36s: it's this mysterious dude, but it's because I don't feel comfortable taking credit for most of what
4514.32s: I do. Because it literally is from him. But anyways, he was really big into like super simple,
4519.44s: you know, technical analysis. He uses like 150 day moving average, 50 day moving average,
4524.72s: and that's about it. So it's, you know, it's funny. Most people I know, after years of experience,
4531.20s: become very simple, myself included. Like again, I did my charter market technician, the CMT
4536.64s: designation, which is everything technical analysis. And I just have oscillators, indicators,
4540.80s: and bands and all of this on my charts. And right now, my charts are so simple. It's just,
4545.52s: it's just candlestick charts with my moving averages, other tools I use like net highs and lows,
4549.92s: it's like, it's breadth. It's not, you know, it's the market itself composition. It's not the,
4553.36s: it's not a technical indicator. Right. The same definition. And so I've just become so simple over time.
4558.64s: And my goal now is less about, you know, looking at all these, these lines and indicators, more
4563.36s: about trying to understand, is there more, are, are institutions net buyers or net sellers? So I,
4568.88s: I come to the stock chart, not by trying to see a pattern, but by trying to read what is the
4573.20s: pattern telling me? I think that's a really important distinction to me. Yeah. Yeah. I think that
4578.24s: that is a kind of a profound distinction, because a lot of people see a chart and they try to impose
4584.48s: whatever their, you know, analysis. Yeah. That's a really profound statement. And then I, I think
4591.84s: I lied to you, because I have one final question. Do you, do you use any sort of like volume profile
4598.24s: or VWOP, anchored VWOP, anything like that? Because it sounds like when you're talking about
4602.48s: institutional pricing that, you know, those tools, at least for me, come to come to mind, but I'm
4608.00s: curious if that's something that you use for that. It's not, it's not something I use, to be honest.
4612.72s: Really, I like to look at the volume on the chart versus what a stock average typically trades in
4618.16s: the day, you know, but I never really got beyond that. What I find a very key important tool and
4622.96s: that's nothing I created, but you know, if you're buying a stock during the day, that's breaking
4627.44s: out or something and these, these kind of more advanced discussion, but, you know, the day is not
4632.40s: created equal. So for example, at 10 o'clock in the day, you know, you're only a small fraction,
4638.08s: you know, into the day. So if you just kind of say like, oh, you know, let's say we're 10% of the
4643.04s: trading day is complete. Are we doing 10% of the volume? That's not a fair analysis. You have to know
4647.12s: how much your stock typically trades in the first half hour because, you know,
4649.92s: when your stocks, you're the opener, is that's their most active time of the day. So in real time and
4654.80s: real time application, you want to know, is it above average volume, but is it also above average
4659.60s: volume for that time of day? Yeah. So that's, that's like a way I like to use volume real time when
4665.92s: I'm putting my position on to understand, is this, is this move real right now? I mean, either I'm
4670.88s: buying on a pullback or consolidation, but if I'm buying into strength because I think there's a
4674.32s: breakout or something, you know, happening, that's an important way I like to approach the market.
4679.04s: Got it. Yeah. That's awesome. Thank you. I was just curious. I hear a lot of discussion about
4684.16s: some of those tools. So well, I have thoroughly enjoyed talking with you. Obviously you're,
4690.56s: you're a great conversationalist. You're just fun to chat with about the market. You have a fun
4693.76s: of great information. So thank you so much for taking some of your time to share it with us.
4698.32s: We really appreciate it. I appreciate being here and everything yourself is a,
4703.44s: as a marine and a veteran, everything you guys have done for us. You know, keep freedom going.
4707.12s: This doesn't just keep going on its own. So I appreciate that. Yeah. Yeah. And most of the people
4712.00s: appreciate that sentiment as well. You mentioned earlier that you have a website, you know,
4716.88s: I, you know, could you just give us like a quick overview of, you know, what's on there, what people
4720.72s: could look for? So if you go to carusoinsights.com, insights plural, right now I have a course where
4727.76s: basically my entire approach from A to Z is what I talk about. After the competition, a lot of people
4733.20s: reached out to me, I just realized, you know, books are great, but people like a video,
4739.04s: interface. So my whole, the course is video based, but really like less, you know, module one is
4743.60s: mindset. So it's really about stepping through the entire journey as a trader, as an investor,
4748.80s: and it's focused towards growth stock, as well as called the active growth investor. And it's sold
4753.52s: very successfully. I'm very proud of that. What I'm most proud of is I only have five star reviews.
4757.52s: So I'm just the reaction I've got from members has been, you know, the biggest reward that I've got
4762.96s: of course, respect five star review. That's super noteworthy. Let's talk about that for a minute
4767.68s: because you know, the age of the internet keyboard warrior, somebody's always pissed about something.
4772.88s: I agreed. I agree. I was, I'm, I'm so, I mean, I set up like this automation, like, you know,
4778.08s: ask for review when I said, yeah, it happens. I mean, I hope to be good reviews. And just,
4781.52s: I've only gone, I think I forgot how many I have now, but I'm proud of that. And we said
4786.56s: you're good to man. I'm actually starting a new product in February will be kind of like a
4789.68s: interactive subscription service where you'll call us twice a week and daily little markup roundups
4795.84s: and all that. You know, so if you sat up on the website to the newsletter, you'll get information
4800.24s: about that when it comes out. So awesome. Yeah, great. Thanks. I'm always interested in
4804.48s: connecting people with resources. And obviously I love a lot of what you talk about. So thank you
4809.28s: for, you know, sharing a little bit of that with everybody. My pleasure. Absolutely. Well, until next
4813.60s: time, thank you so much for hanging out for a while. And I definitely look forward to chatting with you
4817.04s: again. You got it. All right. Take care, man. Bye.
