752.00s:  you
781.00s:  you
782.00s:  you
810.00s:  especially with this game of tariffs,
811.92s:  is tariffs take quite a long time
814.62s:  in order to completely work through the plumbing,
817.22s:  and they can have pretty significant impacts
819.86s:  that are very different than the upfront incentive structures
824.14s:  than you might think.
825.66s:  So this is something to keep a really close eye on
828.58s:  because I view a couple different very key ways to trade it.
833.70s:  So there's the original news launch that has happened
837.46s:  and we can trade that initial reaction,
840.94s:  which is pretty standard that's going to happen.
844.18s:  And then after that initial reaction,
846.34s:  there's also going to be the actual trickle
849.18s:  through effect of the tariff itself.
853.66s:  That trickle through effect is important
855.74s:  to understand how it works with the broader market plumbing
858.70s:  because a lot of people will think like,
860.18s:  oh, tariffs, that means that domestic production
863.54s:  is gonna skyrocket in order to fill that gap.
866.54s:  Well, the problem with domestic production filling
869.58s:  that gap is that domestic production is way more expensive.
873.18s:  That expensiveness is going to work through the entire system.
878.02s:  So what that means is aggregate expenses,
880.70s:  in this case, for everything that has to do
883.94s:  with steel and aluminum is going to go up.
887.02s:  So then you can logically forecast the impact
891.34s:  of that on different industries like materials,
894.46s:  come up with some ideas.
895.78s:  You can also look at very basic ideas.
898.90s:  Like who are the largest US users
903.18s:  or who are not even US, who are the largest users
906.78s:  of American based aluminum and steel?
909.90s:  And let's take a look, I'll ask Chattchen B.T. right now.
913.90s:  Who are the current largest users of US-sourced steel
918.90s:  and aluminum that are publicly traded companies?
925.34s:  Now, the reason why I filter it by publicly traded companies,
928.34s:  not because that's the only way to find an impact,
931.38s:  a lot of publicly traded companies interact
933.50s:  with non publicly traded companies.
935.82s:  So you can still find a trickle through effect.
937.98s:  This is just an easier straight A to B connection
940.50s:  that I can draw for you.
941.82s:  So the automotive industry knows shock, right?
946.82s:  The automotive industry knows shock, right?
948.86s:  So things like four GM bowing planes,
952.02s:  a lot of fucking metal, BA, construction, caterpillar,
955.58s:  deer, John Deere, so CAT and DE packaging,
959.62s:  like ball, BAL, manual, factoring and industrials,
963.02s:  like GE, all of those are big consumers
966.42s:  of US-sourced aluminum and steel.
969.06s:  So that means we have to look at their businesses
974.06s:  and how price sensitive their end consumers are.
978.26s:  For example, airline industry, the government,
981.46s:  not super price sensitive, we need fighter jets,
984.70s:  we need commercial airlines to move people across the globe.
988.02s:  So there will be cost passed through,
991.82s:  but there's a little more resilience
993.58s:  in the price sensitivity there.
996.82s:  For things like automotive, there's a small cohort
1001.82s:  of people that are die hard fans of like
1003.74s:  an individual auto maker brand, but you would better believe.
1008.58s:  If all of a sudden Ford vehicles start spiking in price
1013.38s:  because of something like this,
1015.18s:  then all of a sudden, other alternatives start to look better
1018.42s:  like Toyota or other just manufacturers
1021.70s:  that aren't restricted to US-sourced steel and aluminum.
1025.94s:  Now, one other note, and this is a really useful general lesson
1030.42s:  for everybody.
1031.62s:  This is the original purpose of futures.
1037.94s:  So you better believe right now is everybody that interacts
1042.58s:  with steel and aluminum.
1045.02s:  Right now, they are in futures markets
1047.54s:  hedging their cost exposure.
1050.14s:  This means that this entire cost here,
1053.38s:  this 25% tariff is not a full pass through cost.
1057.10s:  And it's because most entities that interact
1060.94s:  with steel and aluminum that have some sort of investing slash
1065.58s:  risk management arm that deals with capital markets,
1068.14s:  which most of those players will for GM bowing all of those
1071.82s:  absolutely will, they're hedging right now.
1075.22s:  And the way that they hedge is they go long the thing
1078.34s:  that's gonna go up in price.
1080.06s:  So that then as their source materials are going up in price,
1084.54s:  some of that is partially offset by the increase
1088.50s:  in their futures contracts.
1090.18s:  This is obviously an extremely, extremely simplified example,
1094.66s:  but that this is the source of hedging.
1097.02s:  This is why it happens.
1098.82s:  So if we take a look at the COT report,
1104.06s:  there's a couple things we can,
1107.50s:  let's take a look at aluminum.
1109.18s:  Now, for those that don't know,
1118.62s:  you can either use the aggregator or disaggregated report.
1121.78s:  It doesn't really matter, but one of the main things is,
1125.02s:  we want to get a sense of specifically people that deal
1130.02s:  with the products themselves.
1132.78s:  So if we go to the disaggregated report,
1135.46s:  you can take a look at the change in commercials
1139.14s:  from the producer merchant processor and user line
1143.90s:  and take a look, they've been hedging.
1146.86s:  They've absolutely started to hedge some time ago.
1150.74s:  And the reality is this is probably going to peak up
1154.02s:  quite a lot.
1154.86s:  Now the COT report lags, right?
1157.06s:  So you can see that this is back from three Feb in before
1159.42s:  that will have been 27 Jan, but this lags,
1163.02s:  this will likely start to increase
1165.38s:  as that hedging activity changes.
1167.70s:  Now what I do want to take a look at though,
1170.98s:  is the E-minis.
1172.78s:  And I'm specifically curious about that thing
1175.90s:  we were talking about in the beginning.
1177.46s:  This idea that retail is stepping in front of the,
1186.50s:  I don't really think so.
1190.50s:  I don't really think so at all.
1193.26s:  Interesting.
1194.90s:  So here's what I'm eyeing right now.
1197.82s:  I actually don't really care that much about the price
1200.42s:  for this up here.
1201.42s:  I care about these two lines.
1203.82s:  And if we're looking at the legacy report,
1207.54s:  you can see that small speculators,
1210.82s:  which is this violet looking color line,
1214.18s:  they're about the same, right?
1215.98s:  They've been training sideways.
1218.54s:  It's actually a slight downtrend if we plotted this carefully.
1221.82s:  Let's move this in way closer in time.
1223.58s:  Let's look at like a three month look to blocky.
1226.78s:  We'll look at a six month.
1229.18s:  Okay, I like one year.
1231.10s:  And you can see that speculators have definitely gotten
1235.22s:  a little bit extended bullish to the upside,
1237.18s:  but they're still there in force.
1239.38s:  And then take a look at this massive change
1242.94s:  from managed money, large speculators.
1246.70s:  We care way more about managed money
1249.70s:  in this scenario for something like the S&P
1252.50s:  than we do for commercials.
1253.94s:  Commercials in managed money will almost always
1256.78s:  go opposite directions.
1258.14s:  And it's because they're doing different things.
1260.22s:  So the commercial side of things,
1263.26s:  those are people that are using this again
1265.06s:  for production, hedging activities of some sort,
1268.18s:  currency hedges, all different ways.
1270.18s:  Even you can use S&P futures to do something like that.
1272.94s:  It's really, really nuanced.
1275.10s:  But what we can clearly see is that small speculators,
1278.78s:  those are the peasants that's you and I.
1281.34s:  And we've been getting net long for some time now.
1286.34s:  And we can see that large speculators,
1289.14s:  this is institutions had hedge funds, places like that.
1293.02s:  They are now just taking up massive long.
1296.70s:  So the in terms of their relative level,
1299.98s:  they're still short, right?
1301.14s:  So you can still see it's at negative 4800 or so.
1306.98s:  And this is a net figure.
1309.10s:  So they're still short, but they're changing.
1312.54s:  They're tuned very, very quickly.
1314.30s:  And now the game is, are they starting to get long here?
1318.82s:  No, which we have to wait and see.
1320.62s:  We have another week or so to go.
1322.74s:  The COT report doesn't come out for a little bit.
1326.90s:  Interesting.
1329.02s:  So this goes back to what we were talking about in the beginning.
1331.10s:  I don't actually see the correlation.
1334.26s:  And again, I'm actually really curious
1336.06s:  from the chat from you guys.
1338.22s:  Have you seen that thing I'm talking about
1342.06s:  or is that just me?
1342.90s:  It's I'm genuinely asking because I don't know.
1345.06s:  The thing I'm talking about is it seems like
1347.62s:  as I'm going through X and other social media places,
1351.10s:  Reddit, it seems like retail traders
1353.30s:  are really nervous right now that they're kind of like
1355.66s:  waiting for a crash.
1357.42s:  But we can see that in the aggregate,
1359.34s:  they're still quite long.
1361.30s:  So I don't know if that's just the silo of information
1365.30s:  that I'm looking at or if that's something
1367.62s:  that collectively people are picking up.
1369.98s:  Because right now that seems to be the trend.
1371.74s:  I'm seeing a lot of people talking about the bearer side,
1375.02s:  the potential downside in the market,
1376.54s:  which is always comical to me.
1378.34s:  It's we always do that as soon as markets start getting
1382.94s:  a little bit extended.
1384.90s:  But that's definitely what I've been seeing.
1387.94s:  We got capital ape.
1389.30s:  What a travel says how many times a year can we win?
1393.78s:  Lauren says all I heard was quick easy wins.
1395.62s:  Yep, that'll be Thursday.
1396.66s:  Thursday's designed is supposed to be something simple.
1403.70s:  Ken says what I see seems odd so many long.
1408.06s:  Okay.
1410.26s:  I mean, I guess to me,
1413.38s:  I don't see why it seems odd that people are long.
1418.02s:  Because if we take a look at just where the market is,
1422.10s:  the market is essentially hovering near all time highs.
1429.70s:  So if I zoom these out,
1431.14s:  I'll take all these out to like a six month.
1443.62s:  I don't really know what bonds is in here.
1446.82s:  Why are we looking at bonds?
1451.14s:  Oh, that's right, because I hate the doubt.
1452.90s:  I think the doubt dumb.
1457.26s:  So I see like we're literally
1461.82s:  less than a percent off of all time highs.
1464.34s:  So to me, this is actually the like a decent spot
1467.42s:  to not be long.
1470.30s:  To not not be long.
1471.94s:  I mean, you needed the double negative there.
1473.70s:  I think right now is a logical place to be long
1477.06s:  because of, I mean, this is exact thing, right?
1480.18s:  Like we're literally near all time highs.
1482.90s:  People do tend to get verbally skittish.
1487.06s:  Tommy says crypto retails are scared
1489.90s:  but hanging on large liquidations in crypto.
1493.02s:  I saw that whole thing too with the bar stool coin.
1496.70s:  I forgot the name of it, jail stool, jail stool coin.
1500.26s:  I don't know anything about it.
1501.38s:  But I saw Porton only talking about that,
1503.46s:  which I always like watching Porton.
1504.82s:  I use fucking hilarious to me.
1507.06s:  But Bd's will says folks have been super bears for a long time
1510.14s:  but keeps seeing the market move up, which that tends to be
1513.30s:  what, here's what I tend to surmise from that.
1516.58s:  I think it's the same thing we see in a lot of politics
1520.82s:  and other stuff where there's a very vocal minority.
1525.58s:  And then there's the majority that are a little more quiet
1528.82s:  kind of doing their thing.
1530.22s:  I always say it with respect to like politics and stuff
1533.42s:  like that because if you look at the news, politics,
1536.82s:  you would think like everybody hates each other
1539.26s:  and it's like left versus right
1541.46s:  and there's a great massive divide between them.
1543.90s:  And all of a sudden, if you take most people
1546.26s:  that are left and right and just haven't talked about some shit,
1548.50s:  there's a lot of stuff that they get along with just fine.
1552.58s:  So it's just kind of exacerbated by, you know,
1555.54s:  the media presentation of that.
1557.62s:  I get that same sense with the market
1560.70s:  where there tends to be a pretty vocal minority of people
1564.10s:  that tend to be perpetually short.
1566.10s:  Those are people even like Michael Burry.
1567.66s:  Michael Burry has been saying that the market's
1570.42s:  gonna go down for a long time now
1572.26s:  and I mean, he's just continually wrong.
1575.06s:  That's not, he's smart as hell,
1577.30s:  not taking anything away from that dude.
1579.22s:  Just saying that like that angle is really, really common
1583.62s:  for people that like to talk about it.
1585.30s:  So it also seems really intelligent, right?
1587.98s:  For people to be the one that calls the drop.
1590.86s:  But it's just like in anything else
1593.18s:  where the number of quote unquote calls
1595.50s:  that don't come to fruition have to be mentioned
1599.02s:  because those are the periods that were wrong.
1603.46s:  I or two that says federal government
1605.30s:  is shedding thousands of jobs opposite of what was happening
1609.10s:  just a few months ago.
1609.94s:  This will show up in a few months.
1611.94s:  Yeah, but I mean that shedding of thousands of jobs
1615.18s:  is actually really good for the broader economy
1619.58s:  because we've been running in a deficit for so long.
1623.18s:  Again, not getting political in terms of
1624.86s:  if we're shedding the right jobs
1626.66s:  or if the way that we're doing it is right,
1628.50s:  just talking at a high level,
1630.94s:  government spending versus government income.
1634.34s:  And this game of drawing down government spending
1639.78s:  which the largest part of that is personnel
1643.42s:  that contracting to create a better balance
1646.62s:  with government income,
1648.26s:  I actually think that that's better for the market long term.
1653.02s:  And also it's also worth noting
1654.54s:  that like the federal government is federal government.
1657.50s:  So that's not necessarily a direct lend over to capital markets
1662.22s:  which are typically private.
1666.02s:  Private, I'm sorry, not private.
1667.42s:  They're publicly traded but corporations.
1670.22s:  They're obviously not private.
1672.42s:  The ones that we can trade at least.
1674.74s:  So yeah, I mean the turnover that's going on in the government
1678.66s:  I think is something to keep an eye on
1680.26s:  but I don't really see that same angle
1682.94s:  in terms of that being a reason for people
1686.18s:  being nervous about Apple potentially going down
1689.34s:  or Nvidia potentially going down.
1691.78s:  They seem fairly disparate to me at least.
1694.90s:  Now speaking of Nvidia,
1696.10s:  we should take a look at it because there she is.
1698.98s:  This is exactly what I had been talking about.
1702.98s:  So this and take a look,
1705.62s:  I didn't change this from when we spoke about it.
1709.58s:  So this became the spot to be
1713.22s:  and we had talked about Nvidia actually on the fifth
1716.38s:  and that to me is when it started looking good
1720.10s:  because it's starting to make consecutive pretty strong moves
1725.10s:  and I mean this has been probably one of the easier trades
1728.54s:  which is about anybody could have gotten into again.
1731.46s:  I didn't trade it directly personally simply
1733.90s:  because I'm already generally and directly involved
1736.94s:  in it via SSO and T triple queues
1739.66s:  but we're trading an individual tech company on top of that.
1743.30s:  I mean this was like one of the simplest
1744.86s:  no-brainer trades in my mind when it started to materialize.
1748.50s:  As I always say when it first made the drop
1751.06s:  and we talked about this in my mind,
1753.42s:  the game was waiting and seeing what it was going to do.
1757.66s:  Now I don't think Nvidia has had any massive change
1761.74s:  in underlying value pipeline relevance.
1764.62s:  It's at the heart and soul of this entire AI revolution.
1767.62s:  This is one of those very rare,
1770.14s:  very rare market opportunities
1772.70s:  and it's one of the reasons why I talked about Nvidia
1775.50s:  quite a few times and that's because you don't get
1779.26s:  this many gifts from the market.
1782.02s:  You can essentially count them over your lifespan of trading
1785.98s:  where you can have probably one of the absolute
1789.10s:  best position companies on planet earth
1791.90s:  just fall off a cliff due to some news
1794.86s:  in short term sentiment changing so heavily
1798.54s:  dropping almost 20%.
1801.94s:  I mean it had an incredible drop from here, not 20%
1806.30s:  a little less.
1807.62s:  But anyways this still I think is a really solid place
1812.90s:  to keep an eyeball on.
1814.18s:  If you've not already made a trade on it or again
1816.82s:  from an investor's perspective,
1818.34s:  this is all still I think an incredible spot,
1821.46s:  an absolutely incredible spot because the probability
1824.94s:  of Nvidia being anywhere near any of this
1828.82s:  two years down the line so low, so so very low, very unlikely.
1835.14s:  So Nvidia to me looks really, really strong.
1838.66s:  Let's take a quick look at the overall market.
1842.30s:  I'm going to pop the door for Thor.
1843.82s:  So we can go grab his dinner.
1855.02s:  He's out of there.
1857.98s:  So the S&P 500 had a decent, a decent spike.
1864.98s:  It's kind of rebounding off of this
1868.82s:  fairly significant contraction by the way.
1871.62s:  And Q's is now in a really, really delicate spot.
1875.98s:  It's running up into overhead resistance.
1880.66s:  Again, this trend line has been drawn for some time.
1883.94s:  From a technical perspective,
1885.50s:  it still looks favored, I think, to punch through it.
1889.10s:  But it's too really to tell.
1891.18s:  And what we might favor doesn't really matter what matters
1894.18s:  is what it ultimately ends up doing.
1895.94s:  Now what I can tell you is that if it doesn't
1898.46s:  and if it starts to roll over,
1900.42s:  to me, that becomes pretty attractive
1902.22s:  for at least a very short term downside trade two, three days,
1905.30s:  probably something super short term like that,
1907.74s:  but not a bad opportunity.
1909.70s:  So I'm watching it for really both of those directions.
1913.30s:  Again, I still have the coverage
1914.74s:  triangle that's out in Teachable Q's and in SSO.
1917.82s:  So I'm broad, large, broad, long, large cap equities.
1923.30s:  But I still will trade the short term movements
1926.78s:  because the coverage triangle is really a much longer term
1929.62s:  style position and I can trade around it really success.
1932.54s:  We'll even directly to the downside.
1933.98s:  There's nothing wrong with that in my book.
1935.38s:  So I'm always happy to do that.
1936.94s:  Small caps can't catch a bid to save their fucking lives.
1940.78s:  Now, small caps also interestingly,
1943.78s:  for those that haven't looked,
1945.10s:  this is worth showing you, I think.
1947.34s:  We pop over to IWM and we go into the trade grid.
1951.54s:  I want to show you something.
1953.14s:  Take a look at even like a 20 delta, 22 delta put.
1960.02s:  You essentially get a 1% return for a 22 delta put
1963.90s:  that's 39 days out.
1966.14s:  So let's track that, right?
1968.02s:  So somebody pay attention to that.
1970.78s:  Remember that, 22 delta and it's about a percent.
1975.10s:  Now let's go to spy.
1978.42s:  Let's go to same expiration.
1979.94s:  Let's go to a 22 delta.
1981.94s:  22 delta, you are collecting.
1984.50s:  I have to do the math because it's much less than that.
1987.06s:  Whoa, that's intense.
1989.14s:  I had the scientific calculator up for a little bit
1992.98s:  and I just needed to chill out because it's,
1997.54s:  I don't need all that noise.
1999.34s:  So what is it's like call it 406?
2001.22s:  So 406, 406 divided by what, 583?
2010.78s:  0.7%.
2014.06s:  Why am I telling you this?
2016.38s:  Why would I identify that as a data point real?
2023.38s:  James says, you still have ORATS affiliation?
2025.50s:  I do.
2026.34s:  I do still have an ORATS affiliation.
2028.78s:  Did that fall out of like the description thing?
2032.22s:  Normally it's in the description.
2036.02s:  If it's not and you want it, let me know.
2037.58s:  I can send it to you.
2038.90s:  It's like I tell you guys what I make
2041.10s:  from like those affiliates.
2042.42s:  It's so insignificant to me.
2044.58s:  It literally doesn't matter.
2045.54s:  The only reason why I do that is for those that are interested
2048.94s:  in it, like straight up gets you a discount.
2051.94s:  But I literally make essentially nothing off of them.
2054.70s:  It's not not really consequential.
2058.50s:  Anyways, back to the question.
2060.30s:  Why am I talking to you about this?
2061.90s:  Why am I talking about the relationship between what I can get
2068.62s:  in terms of premium on a short put from spy versus Nvidia,
2073.02s:  or I'm sorry, spy versus IWM.
2075.06s:  I was writing Nvidia my little update here.
2078.34s:  Nvidia analysis.
2082.94s:  Spy versus IWM volatility.
2088.18s:  IWM expected more if a downside compared to spy.
2092.10s:  Not quite.
2093.86s:  It's a good guess, but it's not quite.
2096.30s:  What I'm showing you is a relative volatility.
2102.82s:  Now, normally we see pretty strong correlation
2106.70s:  between the various indices.
2109.94s:  So if you look at the S&P 500, if we take a look at Q's,
2113.70s:  if we take a look at the Russell, they tend to be fairly similar
2116.82s:  in terms of their price action and their willingness
2119.98s:  to follow one another.
2121.18s:  Now, for the last two years, three years now,
2124.98s:  what, four years now almost, you've seen a massive decoupling
2128.98s:  of that from small caps, the Russell, and the rest of the large caps.
2135.50s:  You can also plot the correlation of volatility.
2140.94s:  And the correlation of volatility between these tends to be
2146.06s:  a little stronger than what it is.
2149.74s:  So if I'm a volatility trader,
2153.06s:  you can literally trade the dispersion of volatility
2155.78s:  between two different indices based on a pairs trade.
2160.02s:  Now, that's a really cool style of trade
2162.34s:  because it's effectively hedged internally,
2165.38s:  provided that the relationship is your confident
2167.54s:  in the relationship and the normalization of it.
2169.90s:  But then also from a non-bate or risk design trade,
2175.34s:  that's really the goal of that kind of position
2178.22s:  is to capitalize on the variance and volatility,
2181.54s:  not just in anyone index, but between the two indices
2185.22s:  because that's a big gap.
2186.94s:  The fact that right now, you can get essentially a percent
2190.70s:  on 22 delta out of the money put in IWM
2194.26s:  and then in spy, you're looking at 0.69 percent.
2199.26s:  It's a big difference.
2200.82s:  And there's not an insignificant opportunity
2204.22s:  wrapped into that.
2205.06s:  Now, again, it's not sexy, it's not super fun,
2207.50s:  it's not high flying, but it's just another idea.
2213.02s:  All right.
2214.98s:  Now, I want to take a look through a few other things
2219.30s:  with you all.
2220.46s:  The first thing is I want to talk,
2222.22s:  actually I'll save that for the procession tomorrow.
2226.54s:  I have a couple of single trades on
2228.46s:  in a few different companies
2230.46s:  and I do want to talk about those
2232.90s:  because I think that there's a few broader takeaways
2237.34s:  from a trend following perspective,
2239.22s:  but we can get into that stuff more so tomorrow.
2242.58s:  The other thing I do want to flag though
2244.66s:  is trying to get more downside opportunities.
2248.98s:  So the market, as it sits now,
2252.30s:  is still showing that same divergence
2255.06s:  that we were talking about yesterday
2257.90s:  and really for the last week or so.
2260.90s:  So if we take a look at, that's not what I want.
2264.54s:  I want this.
2266.46s:  So if we take a look at what's performing really well right now
2272.54s:  compared to what's really starting to roll over,
2275.98s:  real estate is still slowing down pretty significantly
2279.38s:  compared to everything else.
2281.54s:  Now, a lot of these other names you can see
2283.86s:  that they're relatively slow compared to the 20 day
2286.62s:  and the five day.
2287.30s:  That's essentially saying no change
2289.42s:  that a bunch of these were remaining about the same.
2291.78s:  But you can see things like energy, industrials
2294.38s:  and utilities are now starting to pick back up
2296.54s:  because we're starting to come into another defensive rotation
2300.02s:  and it says a lot to do with the tariffs
2302.02s:  that are coming out right now.
2303.82s:  There's also a handful of really big economic releases
2307.58s:  this week that are worth mentioning.
2310.86s:  If we run through that really quick,
2313.10s:  we took a look at these yesterday
2314.74s:  so I'm not going to linger on them,
2316.38s:  but I do want you to be aware of what's coming up
2318.78s:  because there's quite a few things at this point
2321.78s:  that potentially pretty significant impact is far as I'm concerned.
2327.22s:  And a lot of that is going to come from down here, CPI.
2334.30s:  So CPI is obviously a really important inflation gauge
2339.30s:  and the market's watching CPI very, very closely.
2343.30s:  And then you also have production.
2345.10s:  Production is also going to be really, really important.
2348.94s:  And GDP, the reason why these metrics are so important
2352.98s:  is because the market is trying to get a sense
2354.82s:  we're still trying to gauge the probability
2357.94s:  of a hard versus soft landing.
2361.58s:  And we don't really know.
2364.26s:  The overall leanings and probabilities as far as I've researched
2368.54s:  so far still seem to favor the probability of a soft landing.
2372.02s:  But I mean, we're still in the middle of pretty persisted
2374.54s:  inflation.
2377.14s:  So it's not soft, it's not super soft.
2381.22s:  Maybe bumpy landing, we'll call it at this point.
2384.18s:  But those are probably the bigger metrics
2386.78s:  that you see coming out this week along with CPI
2389.10s:  a little bit later.
2389.86s:  Retail sales, I was talking about that yesterday quite a lot.
2393.22s:  And it's because the health of the consumer right now
2396.54s:  is really important to keep an eye on.
2398.82s:  The consumer that we saw, we were looking at
2401.18s:  what was the earnings release we were looking at yesterday?
2404.78s:  It's a financial company, was it a firm?
2407.74s:  Might have been a firm, that sounds familiar.
2410.10s:  We were looking at, I think it was a firm.
2412.10s:  And essentially the payoffs for writing off debt
2416.70s:  that isn't being paid out and the delinquency rates
2421.50s:  are slowly starting to go up.
2423.18s:  And these are things I typically watch from Fred,
2426.34s:  the Federal Reserve education, I forgot what Fred stands.
2430.70s:  What is Fred stand for?
2431.78s:  It's from the economic division.
2434.54s:  What the fuck does Fred stand for?
2440.38s:  Federal Reserve, no it's not that.
2443.10s:  Hey, how does Fred stand for?
2444.46s:  Yo, somebody hooked me up here.
2448.58s:  Trying to figure out what Fred stands for.
2451.34s:  I can't remember, I'm trying to log it into the dashboard
2453.82s:  right now so I can show you what I look at.
2460.70s:  It's not letting me log in.
2467.62s:  That's actually kind of frustrating.
2471.26s:  Nobody gave me the answer?
2472.26s:  Damn, you all are gonna make me look up myself?
2485.66s:  All right.
2487.50s:  Ah, Federal Reserve economic database.
2493.70s:  I mean that's realistically that is a very intuitive name.
2501.14s:  I just didn't remember it.
2502.78s:  I think that's pretty good.
2504.34s:  So anyways, you can create different dashboards
2506.66s:  and stuff there to visualize stuff.
2509.06s:  It looks like my old email's gone,
2510.26s:  but I was gonna show you guys another time.
2514.26s:  So let's take a stroll and let's take a look at a few things.
2519.26s:  I think from a trading perspective,
2521.74s:  there are a couple ideas that stick out to me right now.
2525.86s:  For my own portfolio, I'm already pretty good
2529.94s:  in terms of my tech exposure.
2531.70s:  And again, that's because a lot of it, a lot of the portfolio,
2535.30s:  I share with you all the sample portfolio,
2537.94s:  like the segment that I break out from the broader portfolio,
2541.58s:  but the percentages and stuff like that essentially
2543.70s:  mirror one another.
2544.54s:  Otherwise it would be annoying for me to track all the differences.
2547.62s:  So what that means is a decent amount of the portfolio
2552.42s:  right now is still sitting in the coverage triangle.
2558.50s:  Actually, I think, yeah, here.
2560.98s:  So this is the segment portfolio,
2563.78s:  the reference portfolio that I've been sharing with you all.
2566.82s:  And this is again, just essentially taking a bit of what I have
2570.06s:  in my broader portfolio, pulling it over
2572.06s:  into a smaller allocation and then using it as an example
2576.14s:  for us to take a look at and explore together.
2578.94s:  And still you can see one of the key themes right now
2582.54s:  for the portfolio is I still am very, very heavily
2587.34s:  in cash-secured puts versus long equity.
2592.10s:  And I do this a lot, but anyways,
2595.02s:  of the total subset allocation of 550K,
2599.26s:  you can see that 375K of that is in
2603.26s:  T triple-q's and SSO, which really is kind of getting direct exposure
2607.86s:  to tech broadly, right?
2609.14s:  Because the S&P 500 is most tech now
2612.54s:  and T triple-q's is even higher concentration tech.
2616.34s:  So the reason why I bring that to your attention
2617.66s:  is because then as I'm looking for different trade ideas,
2620.66s:  I'm looking at it from the perspective of,
2622.50s:  I'm not like, shying away from tech
2624.74s:  because I still think tech is the primary place to look.
2628.22s:  However, it's not where I'm waiting
2632.46s:  to like really try to add more risk in tech.
2635.94s:  I actually am trying to find things in other ideas.
2638.26s:  Now that's not working well
2639.30s:  because a lot of the opportunities that I'm seeing
2641.22s:  are in tech and so be it, that is what it is.
2643.90s:  But that starts to increase
2645.58s:  overall correlation risk of the portfolio,
2647.62s:  which I don't want too much because of the leverage ETFs.
2651.94s:  And then you kind of have a bunch of positions
2654.90s:  that all look the same.
2656.38s:  If there is a big market turn down,
2658.42s:  that then starts to look really painful.
2661.18s:  So that is the context on why I want to actually take a look
2666.50s:  and see from a directional perspective.
2669.42s:  Now from a volatility trading perspective,
2672.58s:  we're in one of the best times of the year already,
2676.14s:  which is earnings.
2677.30s:  So there's a ton to do from an earnings trading perspective.
2680.86s:  I'm not really scrounging bottom of the barrel
2683.62s:  to come up with ideas here.
2684.74s:  It's kind of the opposite.
2686.06s:  There is just a pure abundance of things to do.
2690.02s:  So this is easy.
2691.82s:  This is how I manage most of the volatility book
2695.26s:  coming through this kind of earning cycle.
2698.82s:  But from a directional perspective right now,
2704.90s:  there's a couple different ways we can go.
2706.46s:  We can look at things that are showing strength
2708.94s:  within energy and leading energy
2711.34s:  because there are a handful of names
2712.98s:  that we looked at before that continue
2714.50s:  to be the dominant leaders.
2716.74s:  Or we can look for things that are starting to break down
2719.66s:  massively like in real estate
2721.30s:  and we can look for the weakness within real estate
2724.42s:  or even financials.
2728.98s:  The financials sector has been all over the place.
2735.50s:  So if we take a quick look here,
2738.30s:  let's see what's slowing down on the month.
2742.34s:  PayPal is slowing down a lot,
2746.58s:  EG, P-R-U, USB.
2751.38s:  So all of these are slowing down
2754.82s:  on the financial sector quite a lot,
2758.38s:  which again, that offers opportunity to us
2762.38s:  because we can trade things
2764.30s:  that are showing more weakness within the sector.
2767.82s:  Yeah.
2768.94s:  And it obviously had a disappointing earnings.
2772.62s:  So now this to me looks like if it breaks down below,
2779.22s:  then I very much favor a downside acceleration.
2783.46s:  If it rebounds and breaks out from the top,
2786.38s:  then there's really nothing to be done there.
2788.62s:  Now this also can be traded via stuff like short calls
2791.78s:  and with the expectation of maybe having
2794.02s:  to manage them a little bit.
2795.22s:  But trading short calls in something like PayPal,
2797.74s:  it's not like a massive mover.
2800.54s:  So from six months over the last six months,
2802.94s:  it's gone from 63.
2805.18s:  It did hit a high of 92.
2806.74s:  So it's not a small move obviously,
2808.42s:  but that's not like a crazy move.
2809.50s:  Like you can easily keep pace with that kind of move.
2813.74s:  So this is a pretty easy place to look for downside.
2818.86s:  Pretty easy place to look for downside.
2824.70s:  Now if we take a look at the volatility surface really quick.
2835.46s:  And let's take a look at.
2849.74s:  Ah, interesting.
2852.74s:  So you see how the 16 May expiration that blue line
2855.74s:  that gets overlaid essentially is showing so much higher
2859.74s:  than these others.
2861.74s:  This is a really curious scenario.
2864.34s:  This is essentially the market telling us that it thinks
2867.34s:  that there is a higher probability for PayPal
2870.74s:  to have a moderate size move.
2873.34s:  Right now it's favoring a downside move in terms of severity,
2878.34s:  which means upside move is slightly more,
2880.86s:  well not slightly, probably significantly more probable,
2883.82s:  which we can look at the probabilities for that.
2886.18s:  And it's expected to happen essentially before 16 May,
2889.34s:  because once we get out to 16 May in 20 June,
2892.30s:  it flattens out massively.
2895.22s:  So we lose the smirk and it goes more into a flat
2905.26s:  a near flat, obviously not perfectly flat,
2907.58s:  so that's what the market is telling us
2911.18s:  from a whole perspective in PayPal.
2914.50s:  Interesting.
2917.22s:  Yeah, we'll keep an eyeball on it.
2919.42s:  Let's take a look at some eG.
2921.90s:  It reminds me of like eA sports.
2928.10s:  Amboy.
2929.94s:  So this looks.
2935.94s:  Ah, interesting.
2937.94s:  So this is kind of the previous floor.
2942.94s:  That was priced in.
2945.94s:  And you can see.
2948.94s:  Where we are relative.
2959.94s:  So now the question becomes, how does it deal with that,
2963.94s:  that
2989.94s:  for something like this, this also becomes a fade potential.
2993.94s:  So all I'm doing is setting up a couple alerts to stay button close to it.
2997.94s:  And then if it breaks down,
3000.94s:  essentially look to trade it to the downside.
3004.94s:  Let's take a look now at.
3009.94s:  Want to take a look at one of the other sectors we've got like 10 minutes left.
3012.94s:  So I'm going to continue this and then in like two minutes,
3017.94s:  I'll just pivot over to you guys and we can take a look at any questions
3021.94s:  or anything that you guys want to take a look at specifically and he stocks.
3024.94s:  So if there's anything like that, now's the perfect time to start throwing that stuff out there.
3030.94s:  Right now.
3032.94s:  I'm just trying to find a couple ideas, make a couple dollars.
3036.94s:  You know how it is, you know how it is.
3038.94s:  We're just out here trying to make a couple dollars.
3041.94s:  No, this doesn't look bad at all, unfortunately.
3045.94s:  But this does look like something I want to see if it starts to look bad.
3051.94s:  Because this also at disappointing earnings.
3055.94s:  Things that have bad earnings, I always favor them.
3060.94s:  But one of the notes I found I was reviewing my trade log for my monthly review last month.
3066.94s:  One of the things I'm noticing more recently is that the fade opportunities are there in terms of numbers,
3072.94s:  the severity has gone down quite a lot, especially compared to like my average P&L from a short from this year so far compared to last year.
3083.94s:  So what that means is I am sizing up a little bit more on the long puts or short calls and I'm typically taking them down a little quicker.
3096.94s:  Just for your general context, let's take a look at thing.
3102.94s:  I mean, this just looks like straight downside on it.
3109.94s:  This looks like a continued.
3113.94s:  Just a continued massive.
3117.94s:  Downside channel.
3125.94s:  Like that.
3127.94s:  And.
3130.94s:  I mean, this I also heavily favor to the downside has earnings coming up.
3136.94s:  So we can see how the markets positioning in it for earnings. Let's take a look.
3143.94s:  Trying to get the earnings detail. What is it's 24th.
3149.94s:  February 24th. So we have to be out here.
3151.94s:  A lot of callsque.
3156.94s:  In this near term, which this has got to be recent flow in. So if we take a look just at a curiosity.
3164.94s:  My guess is we'll see way more flow coming in from this side.
3173.94s:  Yeah.
3175.94s:  Yep, exactly as expected. No surprise.
3179.94s:  Most of the inbound flow has been very recent.
3184.94s:  And it probably has a lot to do with the news that we saw today.
3189.94s:  And yesterday, like us last week, but coming into this week.
3194.94s:  So the market definitely this is still being punished though.
3199.94s:  And I don't really want to fade VLO COP.
3204.94s:  That's actually the other play I was looking at though is finding long.
3209.94s:  Long ideas based on the expanded drilling.
3215.94s:  So that's a I didn't finish working on it with chat.
3219.94s:  So create a list of publicly created companies that are likely to benefit the most from.
3230.94s:  From.
3232.94s:  Rumps.
3235.94s:  Expansion.
3238.94s:  Of.
3239.94s:  Oil extraction and drilling.
3244.94s:  Let's see what this says.
3247.94s:  I want to poke through some of these names.
3257.94s:  All right.
3261.94s:  Up, moving me down.
3264.94s:  I wish format as a table.
3269.94s:  These year, I normally have chat GPT.
3272.94s:  This again, if you're not using chat GPT on a daily basis, you're literally wrong.
3277.94s:  You're just making a very poor choice.
3281.94s:  Because it accelerates everything. It's not perfect in any capacity.
3286.94s:  But it helps a lot.
3289.94s:  So here's a few names to start.
3293.94s:  Now.
3295.94s:  What categories are most likely to benefit.
3303.94s:  The most from Trump's policy.
3306.94s:  And I want to see what it says to that.
3308.94s:  I want to see what it says.
3310.94s:  I want to see what it says.
3311.94s:  I want to see what it says.
3314.94s:  Exploration and production.
3317.94s:  Oil field.
3319.94s:  Because fracking is probably going to go up.
3322.94s:  So they're talking about Halliburton.
3325.94s:  Shlumberger S.L.B.
3327.94s:  Which should be in there.
3328.94s:  Baker Hughes.
3330.94s:  Which is not in there.
3332.94s:  So.
3335.94s:  Create a new table with all these.
3337.94s:  And.
3345.94s:  Cole.
3346.94s:  I'm not really super bullish on Cole, to be honest.
3352.94s:  I think Cole can be fine.
3354.94s:  I don't think Cole's going anywhere.
3355.94s:  But I'm just not sure that that's where I would position for.
3360.94s:  A bigger move.
3367.94s:  I'm not sure if I can get a new table.
3369.94s:  I'm not sure if I can get a new table.
3371.94s:  Okay, this is going to have to be.
3373.94s:  Like a multi.
3375.94s:  Is there's.
3377.94s:  That rules me a sec.
3385.94s:  I don't know what.
3388.94s:  I don't know what's super secret content you guys are about to see.
3391.94s:  We'll find out.
3392.94s:  This is where I make obviously the little.
3395.94s:  The little.
3398.94s:  Blockboards for the videos that I show.
3401.94s:  Show you guys.
3405.94s:  Nothing.
3406.94s:  That sucks for you.
3407.94s:  Because I have a bunch of stuff in the works over here.
3412.94s:  That could have been fun.
3413.94s:  Anyways.
3415.94s:  I guess an easier.
3417.94s:  Would have just been.
3419.94s:  Yeah.
3420.94s:  So I should be easier.
3422.94s:  I'm not sure.
3425.94s:  Literally.
3427.94s:  Just.
3429.94s:  I'm.
3432.94s:  I'm.
3436.94s:  I'm.
3444.94s:  And then we'll poke through these relief.
3448.94s:  And then we'll do Q and A promise.
3451.94s:  I'm.
3454.94s:  I'm.
3457.94s:  I want to see these.
3460.94s:  Okay.
3464.94s:  All right.
3465.94s:  So you guys can all grab a screenshot or take a peek at that.
3468.94s:  As far as you want.
3469.94s:  And then I'm going to move it off to the side now so that I can like see.
3474.94s:  It'll allow me to move much, much more quickly.
3477.94s:  So exon mobile.
3481.94s:  Man, I just don't like these to the upside.
3484.94s:  The problem is this is going to be a news driven trade based on whenever this stuff starts breaking.
3489.94s:  But this might be okay for like short puts.
3492.94s:  I wouldn't hate selling puts in XMobile, but I'm not sure that I'm expecting some sort of big breakthrough.
3497.94s:  I don't like COP.
3501.94s:  This you can see I already have a bunch of alerts waiting for it trying to find some strength, which just literally has not happened.
3508.94s:  So no doubt there.
3511.94s:  This looks better, but not good.
3514.94s:  EQT continues.
3515.94s:  This wasn't on that list.
3516.94s:  I just wanted to see EQT.
3520.94s:  But EQT looks really good.
3524.94s:  Um.
3527.94s:  How else.
3530.94s:  I don't know if it looks terrible.
3533.94s:  See, man, I just.
3536.94s:  I really just can't get behind going along these companies.
3539.94s:  They look like straight trash.
3541.94s:  What I can get behind doing though is keeping an eye on them that I absolutely can do.
3547.94s:  And monitor.
3549.94s:  If there's a perspective entry over time.
3552.94s:  But.
3554.94s:  I mean, the reality is based on where these sit now.
3556.94s:  I think that's the reason why I'm going to be doing that.
3559.94s:  I would want to do with them to the upside.
3562.94s:  There's just so much better opportunities that are moving heavily.
3566.94s:  You sent me or dinner order.
3568.94s:  I'm going for Mexican.
3569.94s:  So I'm sure she's not going to.
3571.94s:  Not going to go for it.
3573.94s:  But we'll see.
3576.94s:  As expected.
3580.94s:  That's alright, burrito for me.
3584.94s:  Okay, order is up.
3587.94s:  So.
3589.94s:  This doesn't look good.
3591.94s:  S.L.B.
3593.94s:  This doesn't look good.
3595.94s:  B.K.R.
3597.94s:  Looks good.
3598.94s:  So this is what I'm talking about, about looking within the sector.
3602.94s:  And finding strength.
3604.94s:  Because there is strength in the sector, especially something like energy right now.
3609.94s:  Because even though energy isn't doing anything that we're like,
3612.94s:  oh, wow, this is, you know, so crazy.
3615.94s:  What crazy such moves.
3617.94s:  But it definitely still is performing moderately.
3623.94s:  And the reason why we know that is because of this.
3626.94s:  Because of this giant change in the number of stocks within the sector that are above a short term moving average compared to a slightly longer term moving average.
3636.94s:  So there has to be stocks doing this.
3639.94s:  And then we can sort them.
3641.94s:  We can actually get, I mean, the tip the way I typically would do this.
3644.94s:  If I wasn't looking for something based on a broader market theme.
3649.94s:  Is that would just come into this.
3650.94s:  And then I would sort this.
3652.94s:  And normally I prefer to sort looking for stuff that's exhibiting momentum.
3656.94s:  So that's why EQT came up on that list is because EQT has been something I've been in and out of several times now.
3662.94s:  And it's because EQT continues to be a leader.
3665.94s:  And then no shock here.
3667.94s:  Take a look at what else popped on the list that we happen to be looking at right now.
3671.94s:  BKR.
3672.94s:  So this is literally how you can navigate through markets and find ideas literally at any point in time.
3680.94s:  People that struggle to find trades confound me.
3684.94s:  Because there are always things to do.
3688.94s:  There's unlimited things to do.
3690.94s:  It's always a function of finding the best things to do.
3694.94s:  But there's a ton of them.
3696.94s:  So this is another, again, really simple idea.
3699.94s:  Is BKR is involved in this broader exponential change that we might see from the oil development and further production from oil field services BKR.
3713.94s:  They essentially can benefit from the growth in equipment and services.
3717.94s:  If we take a look at their fundamentals.
3729.94s:  I mean, their fundamentals look good.
3731.94s:  There's one other thing I want to look at and then I promise we'll pivot now to the Q&A.
3735.94s:  And you know, take a look at whatever tickers you want.
3738.94s:  But I want to take a look at their last earnings release.
3741.94s:  BKR.
3743.94s:  What I want to do is I want to see where their money comes from.
3755.94s:  Hell yeah, look at her go.
3757.94s:  What the fuck?
3760.94s:  He's the only one with a patch.
3763.94s:  Uniformity.
3767.94s:  What Marine and me is bugging out right now that that's not at least more similar.
3775.94s:  Let's see.
3781.94s:  What up Nancy?
3784.94s:  I want to see the breakdown.
3789.94s:  No, I don't care.
3791.94s:  I don't care.
3792.94s:  I don't do I care?
3794.94s:  I don't care.
3797.94s:  Okay.
3799.94s:  Flexible pipe systems orders massively going up.
3805.94s:  15% increase in best value countries.
3810.94s:  So global global revenue coming in.
3823.94s:  Okay.
3824.94s:  Here we go.
3825.94s:  Here we go.
3826.94s:  This is what we want.
3829.94s:  Let's see.
3835.94s:  Well construction.
3839.94s:  943.
3841.94s:  Production solutions.
3843.94s:  974 sub C932.
3845.94s:  So that will be useful.
3847.94s:  Geographic region.
3849.94s:  Interesting.
3850.94s:  Again, this is another reason why we like to look at this is because if we break out
3855.46s:  their potential revenue sources from different geographic regions, it's actually a minority
3863.02s:  from North America.
3864.70s:  Because again, think of it from the perspective of the idea that we're trying to tease
3868.54s:  out here.
3869.54s:  The idea that we're trying to tease out is Trump is saying I want more oil drill bitch.
3877.54s:  We're then doing a little bit of preliminary research saying, okay, who's involved with
3881.58s:  the drill bitch function of that.
3884.38s:  And some of it is Baker Hughes for sure.
3886.78s:  And they're performing well.
3888.18s:  But if we take a look at the overall revenue by region, I want you to look at two things.
3894.94s:  The first thing is take a look at the North American revenue streams for the past three
3899.54s:  earnings cycles.
3901.82s:  1018, this was obviously year over year.
3904.78s:  So a pretty significant decline and then quarter over quarter from 971 to 971.
3910.62s:  Nothing is changed.
3912.14s:  So most of this growth is happening from Latin America, Middle East.
3917.82s:  And that's important because then if we take a look at their total revenue streams from
3922.98s:  non-US based functions, it's the majority.
3926.26s:  So then how much of the potential revenue impact would be realized by them if Trump says
3932.70s:  drill more and then they're involved.
3936.82s:  That's not to say that it can't be significant.
3938.58s:  It can be significant.
3939.58s:  What I'm highlighting is that there's an opportunity here because right now it's about
3942.90s:  gridlocked.
3943.90s:  It's not really doing anything.
3944.90s:  It's declining 5% year over year.
3948.18s:  But we would need to see how well they're positioned to then interact with the various
3955.58s:  product lines that they produce what the competition looks like.
3959.74s:  So now that's the next question and so on and so forth.
3962.94s:  And I promised you that I would pivot to Q&A.
3965.38s:  But that's I'm just letting you know the way that I would do this.
3968.10s:  So the next step for me here would be to look through that.
3971.66s:  I would go through, find their competitors.
3974.02s:  An easy way to do that is to come in here.
3977.70s:  We can look at BKR.
3984.06s:  And then we can figure out who their primary competitors are.
3988.98s:  SLB, HAL, TES, which TES is also doing really well in FTI.
3994.46s:  And then we can look through their earnings and see what their market cap right now or
4000.06s:  what percentage of the revenue comes from North America.
4002.50s:  And then this helps us pick the right place to put the money to play the idea.
4007.10s:  This is one of my favorite things about trading, especially more thematic ideas is you get
4013.18s:  to do really cool research at least for me.
4015.58s:  I'm a fucking nerd about this stuff.
4016.90s:  I like this.
4018.46s:  And to see essentially what's going on in the broader market.
4022.14s:  Now a couple of other notes.
4024.02s:  This is the kind of thing I would absolutely use leverage for and it's because of this.
4030.06s:  Take a look at the institutional ownership 98.7%.
4033.82s:  This stock is just about locked up.
4036.18s:  So what that means is the ability for the stock price to move meaningfully is really muted.
4043.14s:  And it's not going to be some sort of high growth, high flying stock like some of the other
4048.30s:  newer up and coming names will be.
4050.90s:  But on the same token, I can't trade most of those up and coming names because they're
4055.86s:  too liquid for the size that I have to put on in order for the trade to make sense.
4061.50s:  So that is a quick rundown at least of capitalizing on the energy side of things and you know
4071.86s:  seeing what might be possible there.
4075.46s:  So all of that aside now, let's.
4082.86s:  Let's pivot to Q&A.
4083.94s:  I just have to update our little timestamps here.
4090.82s:  Trade opportunity and energy.
4094.10s:  What is this BKR?
4097.34s:  Okay.
4098.82s:  Now we're at 108 20.
4101.34s:  We'll do a little Q&A.
4103.86s:  Anything you guys want to hit?
4105.42s:  If not, that's totally cool.
4106.30s:  But I just I promised you so I wanted to make sure that you have the opportunity to throw
4110.34s:  out anything that you might want to take a look at.
4114.26s:  Tesla sure.
4120.90s:  Trash bro.
4122.34s:  So Tesla to me here looks bad.
4127.90s:  And that's probably not any sort of surprise.
4132.06s:  It's in a fairly defined downtrend at this point.
4138.62s:  And this new tool by the way of redraws channel channel is very, very cool.
4146.94s:  If you guys don't use this, I recommend it.
4149.50s:  The other thing that in case you don't know, they added a new tool.
4153.10s:  You have to go into the settings.
4154.74s:  I don't want to go in there because it shows some of your account information.
4158.26s:  But if you go into settings, think or swim now has a new tool where you notice this,
4162.14s:  you can't see it.
4163.14s:  Let me squish this down for a second.
4167.34s:  Okay.
4168.34s:  So you see this thing down here, the navigator.
4170.98s:  This is cool.
4171.98s:  So this essentially is like if I zoom in on this section, it shows me where I'm at.
4176.22s:  And then I can slide through this section.
4178.70s:  And then obviously I can zoom back out to recapture the whole screen and stuff like that.
4183.50s:  But that's you just have to turn that on in your settings.
4186.46s:  But I actually like that quite a lot.
4188.14s:  It's very, very useful.
4189.74s:  And it shows you the overall trend.
4191.98s:  That's what the little mountain is.
4193.86s:  So pretty cool.
4195.94s:  And for Tesla, it looks bad.
4199.10s:  I mean, that's the reality of it.
4200.90s:  It's falling through successive areas of support.
4206.58s:  It's running into its next volume node right now.
4209.14s:  It's essentially on the next volume node.
4210.94s:  It's also coming down onto a 100 day moving average.
4217.02s:  So yeah, I mean, for me, I favor it to the downside right now.
4221.98s:  And I like Tesla.
4222.98s:  I want Tesla to do well.
4224.66s:  But automotive manufacturers are in a rough spot right now.
4228.70s:  And I don't think that that's going to change.
4230.30s:  That's why and especially in the EV industry, I think people that are trying to play the
4236.50s:  EV industry have to be super, super careful.
4239.62s:  Like Rivian as well.
4241.14s:  Rivian is just not doing well.
4245.22s:  And you can see it also in their earnings, right?
4247.78s:  Like they're still losing money.
4250.14s:  So automotive companies struggle historically.
4254.38s:  Rivian is no different than most of the broader companies.
4258.30s:  The main difference though is Tesla has come up and it has found a way to turn a profit
4264.78s:  to make some money.
4266.02s:  But it's highly, highly volatile.
4267.94s:  It's still making good money and even Tesla is starting to slow down.
4272.54s:  So I think it's an important note, at least to be aware of.
4278.42s:  So we can take a look at the options chain and see slight call skew.
4295.46s:  Recent call volume traded today.
4298.38s:  Take a look at the surface.
4308.38s:  Favourite downside, higher probability of upside.
4320.54s:  And compressed movement expectations.
4325.02s:  They're expecting more of that movement in the near term.
4338.02s:  Valtility isn't that high.
4340.54s:  IV percentile right now is 48%.
4343.26s:  Yeah, I favor it to the downside.
4347.26s:  This stops in my eyes are this 340 ish zone that you see.
4353.62s:  I'll draw like a little box around it so that you can see again what my eyes are looking
4358.82s:  at this.
4360.98s:  Essentially that volume node becomes the next support line.
4365.54s:  And then it's already built a lot of overhead resistance potential.
4370.14s:  There's this volume node.
4372.74s:  And then there's this volume node for overhead resistance.
4378.42s:  So now it's we will see that's the way I look at it is see how it behaves around here,
4386.22s:  but I don't like it.
4387.34s:  I think it looks at least I don't like it to the upside.
4396.50s:  Jonathan says Trump also mentioned bolstering US steel X is the ticker tariffs on incoming
4403.22s:  steel and aluminum.
4404.22s:  Yeah, well, that's that's the whole idea, right?
4407.06s:  Tariffs they're designed to try to spur domestic production.
4411.06s:  The problem is is again domestic production is more expensive.
4414.30s:  So in terms of how much they're actually able to produce will be really dependent on
4421.14s:  the price sensitivity of the primary consumers of whatever they produce in this case, whatever,
4428.22s:  you know, US deals primary partners are.
4431.26s:  So a fairly tricky prospect, I think.
4438.30s:  Oz he says cost going along with Jamie again means whatever happened back in June is still
4442.78s:  on the table.
4445.38s:  I think in general you're going to see a lot of those names move together.
4448.86s:  We've seen that correlation for some time now for GameStop.
4452.14s:  I'm really stoked to see again, a bit of a rally here, but I think it still is in a just
4461.86s:  really dangerous spot.
4464.58s:  So this essentially has become invalid and then I mean, it's still in a really big downward
4475.26s:  channel.
4476.26s:  It did break out and it broke above two of these, which I think is really important because
4480.34s:  there's not big volume nodes here yet, which is good.
4484.18s:  So now it's does it consolidate and we'll see obviously I'll make a GameStop video on
4491.90s:  it tomorrow.
4492.90s:  But yeah, definitely a little bit tricky.
4495.30s:  I think here.
4496.62s:  Coke.
4497.62s:  You mean Coca Cola?
4502.94s:  Kale?
4503.94s:  Or okay, so I'm just lexic?
4507.94s:  I assume you mean Coca Cola or do you mean something else with Coke?
4517.94s:  Kale, okay, yeah, that's what I figured.
4529.94s:  And I don't love it.
4533.94s:  I don't love it for either direction, to be honest.
4539.74s:  And this is again from a trading lens.
4542.98s:  The reason why I don't love it for downside or upside is that in my eyes, there's not
4551.98s:  like an easy win here.
4555.90s:  It broke out of that downward channel, which is good.
4561.98s:  It's starting to build successive higher lows, which is good.
4569.58s:  But and it doesn't have a ton of overhead resistance, which is also good for like a upside
4576.62s:  idea.
4577.62s:  But the question I always say to myself is always is like, you know, it's not can there
4583.26s:  be a trade.
4584.26s:  Like is there a trade?
4586.26s:  Is there something that's good?
4588.50s:  It's not can I put something on and I don't want to trade this to the downside because
4594.06s:  it's rallying.
4595.06s:  I don't want to trade this to the upside because it's gone from a low of 60 up to 64.
4602.06s:  So I really couldn't care less about that size of a move in a company this big.
4607.78s:  And it's really swimming upstream right now.
4611.26s:  So it does look like there might be a little bit of information that could have come
4615.70s:  out regarding earnings.
4618.50s:  And people might be front running it a little bit.
4621.26s:  So we can take a look at that really fast.
4626.02s:  There's definitely calls skew way more calls traded today.
4630.14s:  Most of them at the ask this to me looks like somebody knows something about earnings.
4635.34s:  And what would consolidate this down in my mind is if we see a lot of this activity in
4640.42s:  these front expirations.
4642.78s:  So right now earnings is on the 11th.
4645.50s:  So I wouldn't expect that necessarily to be in the 14 feb experee.
4650.50s:  That's simply because bigger entities need liquidity and there's less liquidity here.
4655.94s:  So if they're trying to trade this directionally through earnings a lot of them will go out
4659.10s:  to 21 feb, which we can see that there is definitely a bit of build out going on here.
4663.78s:  We can see that these at the money transactions are heightening up.
4668.54s:  And from last Friday to today, there's a pretty big on load.
4673.18s:  And you can see that today's volume is also very high.
4677.66s:  So all of that leads me to believe that there's a chance some information would have come
4683.22s:  out regarding its earnings.
4685.42s:  And people are trying to trade it from a bullish perspective.
4688.58s:  Let's take a look at the volume.
4690.74s:  85 against 36.
4694.14s:  And yeah, sure, shit.
4695.74s:  Take a look at where most of them are.
4698.14s:  Love that 85 traded today.
4700.90s:  52 are in the front two experee.
4705.38s:  So leads me to believe somebody is thinking something about earnings.
4711.58s:  And if I take a quick look on here, I just want to see what their previous earnings looks
4721.74s:  like.
4725.14s:  That previous earnings.
4728.50s:  Still within move though.
4729.50s:  This is something I trade pretty regularly actually from an earnings play perspective.
4737.06s:  It just doesn't move that much.
4739.38s:  But from a directional from a directional play.
4744.10s:  So to summarize all of that.
4748.18s:  Right now it's a mess.
4751.42s:  The moving averages are all fucked up like a football bat.
4754.78s:  They're just starting to reorganize.
4756.66s:  It looks like it's building a near term uptrend.
4760.14s:  So this really delicate stage can be traded to the upside.
4763.94s:  It just has to be traded really carefully.
4766.42s:  Meaning I wouldn't give it a lot of room to fall back down to the downside.
4770.42s:  I think it has earnings coming up on the 11th before the market.
4774.70s:  So tomorrow, AM, it looks like a bunch of people are positioning in this pre earnings
4779.34s:  move with the expectation of upside.
4783.54s:  It's because they do that.
4784.54s:  It doesn't mean it's going up.
4785.54s:  They can be wrong.
4786.54s:  But that's what it looks like is happening to me.
4789.86s:  And it's really not got a lot of overhead resistance.
4797.46s:  There's just not a lot of volume in here.
4799.42s:  So that part is good.
4800.70s:  It's not like fighting through a bunch of prior people.
4803.30s:  It will slow down when it gets up here, almost guaranteed if it gets up here.
4808.14s:  And that's just because a lot of people are probably feeling some type of way about it.
4812.74s:  Meaning the ability to get out at a profit.
4815.78s:  Now the other thing from a fundamental perspective, it's really, really important.
4819.46s:  Remember is that Coca-Cola is within consumer staples.
4823.50s:  So if we take a look at the behavior of staples over here compared to discretionary over
4829.14s:  here, staples is been in a massive downtrend.
4833.34s:  So the weight of the broader sector is also bearish for consumer staples.
4841.18s:  So that serves as a natural headwind.
4843.66s:  This is something like Coca-Cola.
4845.74s:  So that sums up about two cents.
4850.90s:  All right, we'll take one more before I wrap up.
4856.18s:  Let me see really quick.
4858.46s:  So we were at like 116.
4862.62s:  116.
4865.10s:  And this was K-O-N-L.
4869.26s:  Let's see.
4876.02s:  Dark Mark says, are you still on for a balance here?
4878.26s:  Yeah.
4879.26s:  So I still have my balance here position on.
4882.46s:  Palantir is a super easy trade.
4885.66s:  I again, I'll run through this more in detail tomorrow.
4890.50s:  But Palantir is a ratio call diagonal.
4894.94s:  So I do have the 21 March, 125s, the short calls.
4901.94s:  And those are still OK.
4903.66s:  They're obviously being challenged here.
4905.78s:  And then I have out in 16 Jan 26.
4910.74s:  That's where the long options are.
4912.38s:  So I'm really planning to play this for a much longer term idea.
4917.42s:  So that's what I'm seeing here.
4919.90s:  I like this.
4920.90s:  We'll review that trade way more in detail along with the rest of the portfolio.
4924.78s:  Like we normally do during the pro livestream tomorrow.
4929.02s:  But yeah, Palantir, I still think looks really good here.
4932.02s:  Just kind of monitoring it as it's trickling up.
4935.02s:  Not really because I'm intending to manage the long options really at all and planning
4939.34s:  on letting them go.
4941.22s:  But it's mostly because I want to opportunistically manage the short calls to pull in as much
4947.70s:  as I can.
4948.70s:  As always, they are at a ratio to make sure that there's uncapped upside profit potential.
4953.82s:  But they're paying a little bit now, especially because of the potential of a severe move
4959.42s:  to the upside.
4960.42s:  The wall on the call side looks pretty good.
4962.02s:  The skew is not bad.
4964.02s:  So that wraps me up, gang.
4966.66s:  Absolutely awesome.
4967.82s:  Hanging out.
4968.82s:  As per always, I'll see the pro members on Tuesday for those that are coming to hang out
4972.38s:  on Wednesday for the skilled development segment.
4976.34s:  I'll tell you exactly what we're doing.
4978.98s:  We're doing how to build trade exit plans.
4983.34s:  So that will be the session for Wednesday.
4985.78s:  Then Thursday there will be a case study on this.
4989.62s:  And then on Friday for those that are joining for the outlier options trading basics, we
4995.74s:  are going into the Greeks.
4998.62s:  Now for the Greeks, I am going to give you a reference video first that I asked you to
5004.86s:  watch because I already did a pretty big video.
5011.46s:  It's like 20 minutes on the Greeks.
5014.22s:  I'll throw that in here and then I'm just going to leave that in here for my reference
5017.70s:  as well.
5019.02s:  But the reason being is because I want the video to focus way more on the practical side
5025.18s:  of the Greeks versus like understanding that the Greeks measure things like, okay,
5029.98s:  great.
5030.98s:  I want to be way more practical.
5032.98s:  So like actually using them to understand your positions better.
5036.38s:  That's the idea.
5037.74s:  As always, if you have any questions, let me know anything.
5039.82s:  Want me to take a look at you give me a via email.
5042.02s:  I try to pull in as much as I can into the live streams.
5045.82s:  Be an outlier.
5046.82s:  I'll see you all later.
