0.16s: the worst possible time to determine
2.36s: when you should roll an option is when
4.20s: the trade is on what that means is we
6.40s: should think about it ahead of time so
8.48s: the goal of this video is to walk you
10.04s: through a formula on how you can think
13.08s: about rolling options what the best time
15.48s: to roll an option is but then most
17.72s: importantly the different considerations
19.60s: you should think about as you're going
21.96s: through the process of rolling an option
24.32s: let's get right in so very first thing
27.12s: is a market disposition this is the same
29.52s: thing you'll see most of my content and
31.28s: it's because overviewing the market in
33.48s: your portfolio upfront is probably one
35.64s: of the most important steps you can take
37.48s: as a Trader it informs everything else
41.52s: that we're doing so if I'm looking at
44.56s: any position and I'm thinking if I want
46.72s: to roll it a big part of that is what do
49.40s: I think about the market what do I think
51.20s: about the portfolio and how this
52.88s: position fits into the portfolio all of
55.32s: that informs the way I think about
57.20s: rolling now a couple other general
59.52s: concepts says it pertains to Rolling
61.16s: first off when we're referring to
62.92s: Rolling most often we're referring to a
66.48s: short option that is fallen in the money
70.08s: meaning we would be closing it for a
71.72s: loss and opening a new trade but that's
74.36s: just kind of colloquially speaking
76.16s: rolling can occur at any point in time
78.36s: rolling an option is simply when we
80.68s: close one open another and we're tying
83.96s: the accounting to one another it's
86.32s: nothing more than that so you can roll
88.32s: winning positions you can roll out of
90.20s: the money positions you can roll bought
92.36s: or sold positions it's just two
94.44s: transactions now for General context
97.32s: here and most often you're going to hear
98.88s: to people rolling positions that they're
100.84s: defending something that's going against
102.84s: them so that part aside we have kind of
105.40s: our first step out of the way what's the
107.24s: next step well this is one that most
109.76s: people Overlook and it's probably one of
111.44s: the most important things they need to
112.60s: ask themselves should you be in this
115.60s: Trade A lot of people have a position
117.80s: that they put on it starts to go against
119.64s: them
120.36s: and then they're like ah I got to defend
122.72s: this but maybe we're just wrong maybe
125.64s: the best move is actually to get out of
127.60s: the trade not tie up Capital into
129.88s: something that's not working and then to
132.36s: deploy our Capital somewhere more
133.84s: logical so the way to think about this
136.28s: is first I don't like the question of
139.52s: what I put the position on now because
142.56s: that assumes that over the entire life
145.20s: cycle of a trade that you would have
147.92s: optimal entry points and that's just not
150.32s: real that's not how trading works even
152.68s: trades that are working there's very
155.12s: commonly instances where I wouldn't put
157.08s: that trade on right now so I actually
159.52s: don't like that I get the idea and it's
162.44s: designed to get you to do this but as
164.52s: usual I prefer to get a little more
166.04s: specific so the real question I have is
169.80s: am I defending a loser just because of
172.72s: my ego and because I don't want to have
174.52s: a losing trade or is there a logical
177.24s: reason behind it that is the question to
180.08s: ask here and we'll get into an example
182.20s: in just a couple minutes the next piece
184.92s: we have is this which is what is the
187.96s: optimal time to roll well in an Ideal
190.96s: World your optimal time to roll would be
194.36s: when the stock price is the same as your
196.96s: strike price and there's no extrinsic
198.96s: value remaining this is a goldilock
201.12s: scenario you're essentially never going
202.64s: to see this it could happen but it's
204.76s: insanely infrequent most often though
207.80s: you're going to have a point in time
209.52s: where your short option again just using
212.52s: kind of that General scenario is the
214.44s: same price as the stock so let's take a
217.96s: look at an example that I have on right
219.72s: now if you take a look at iwm you'll
221.92s: notice that I'm short the 199 puts this
224.28s: is part of a coverage strangle these are
226.04s: at a 20 Delta so these are actually
227.80s: working for me beautifully a rare
230.48s: scenario but let's say now that I'm
233.40s: talking about it's probably going to
234.44s: happen let's say that these short puts
237.00s: end up at the money what you'll notice
239.04s: is when they're at the money there's
240.76s: actually the most extrinsic value the
243.44s: option is going to have so in terms of a
246.32s: beta Decay perspective there's a lot of
249.16s: time value that needs to come out of
251.40s: these options and there's a lot of
252.64s: extrinsic value that you don't
254.04s: necessarily want to buy back if you've
255.96s: sold it that's the idea of selling a put
258.44s: is to collect time value however the
261.72s: other thing you'll notice is there are a
263.76s: lot of choices available to roll so
266.48s: these have 10 days left let's say that
268.60s: these actually fell to the at the money
271.00s: and they're trading around where these
272.72s: 204s are right now which is like 242
275.56s: something like that so if I take a look
277.84s: let's just even go out one cycle to 2 uh
281.56s: let's go a little further let's go to 28
283.36s: March and you'll notice that I can
285.88s: already roll them down I can get them
288.76s: further away from the money and I can
291.24s: still collect a small credit so I can
293.44s: decrease my basis in this scenario
295.48s: hypothetical from 204 to 203 this is the
298.76s: ideal scenario and again this is
300.32s: assuming your short puts are being
301.80s: challenged now you'll notice though that
304.16s: you're buying back a ton of x transic
306.68s: value so that has to be part of your
309.00s: equation and we'll get a little further
310.76s: into that later the reason why it's
312.32s: important to know when optimal what's
314.00s: the goldilock scenario is so that we can
316.80s: then understand the tradeoffs that we're
318.68s: actually going to be facing as we go
320.20s: through this example so let's take a
322.24s: look now at a quick decision tree using
324.56s: this iwm position that I have on so I'm
327.40s: going to start with the market and the
328.56s: portfolio the first first thing I'm
330.16s: looking at from the market is has my
333.16s: market disposition materially changed
335.20s: from the time I entered the trade to now
337.20s: and if it has it might require a change
340.44s: in position in its entirety then I'm
342.96s: going to look at the portfolio here I
345.16s: want to get a sense of what different
347.44s: decisions impact the portfolio as a
349.92s: whole so again for example let's say
352.68s: that if I look at my portfolio I have
355.24s: tons of positions that are expiring the
358.88s: 28th of March tons maybe instead of
362.08s: rolling these out to that same
363.72s: expiration cycle I could get a little
366.48s: bit of diversity in expirations that I
369.92s: have exposure to and instead of going to
372.76s: this 28 March maybe that informs my
375.08s: decision- making to go out to the 5
377.28s: April or the 12 April so some of this is
380.32s: going to be fed by what do you think
382.24s: about the market as a whole but then
383.84s: most importantly how does this fit into
386.04s: your portfolio are there any guidelines
389.20s: or implications from either of these
390.96s: that inform your decision- making then
393.28s: we have the trade review so now we're
395.40s: going to look at the trade we're going
397.28s: to say is my original thesis intact am I
401.16s: concerned about early assignment how
403.12s: many days are left to expiration are
406.20s: there any Market moving announcements
408.44s: coming up that I have to be aware of so
410.64s: in this case if the thesis has not
412.88s: changed then we're okay for a role if
415.12s: the thesis has changed maybe we need to
417.24s: change the position am I at risk of
419.20s: early assignment if yes that tells me I
421.28s: need to do something sooner rather than
422.80s: later a way to think about early
424.72s: assignment is pretty simple if I had
427.92s: again short puts but let's say I had
430.08s: short puts that were all the way in here
431.56s: like the 230s notice that there's only
433.28s: like two pennies of extrinsic value
435.72s: these become more and more likely to be
437.64s: reassigned once they're you know sub a
439.88s: dime definitely sub a nickel in
441.60s: extrinsic value left so you have to
444.04s: consider that how many days are left so
446.92s: one of the things is we talked about in
448.72s: the beginning if I'm I'm selling premium
451.04s: I want time to pass so if I have a whole
453.88s: bunch of days to expiration left maybe I
456.48s: want to leave it on a little bit longer
457.88s: to let some of that Theta go or if I'm
460.28s: concerned about the way this fits in the
461.88s: portfolio I don't want to take
463.12s: assignment yet and it's super far out in
465.32s: time but at this point the stock price
467.64s: equals the strike price I can make a
469.12s: meaningful basis adjustment maybe it
471.68s: being a little further out in time then
473.12s: doesn't matter to us and we make the
474.40s: adjustment there's some ideas that go
476.16s: behind this which we'll talk about and
477.64s: then announcements is simple do we have
480.12s: something coming up that can potentially
481.72s: hurt us how does that inform our
483.40s: decision- making okay let's talk about
485.28s: the analysis now so we already talked
487.20s: about the stock equals strike what's
489.88s: going to happen here is you're going to
490.92s: have the greatest choices in strike
494.24s: selection and here's why if we take a
497.60s: look at this again 10 DTE the further
500.72s: you go in the money the more in transic
504.04s: value there is the less extr transic
506.56s: value There Is So when you buy this back
509.56s: it's becoming increasingly expensive but
512.40s: there's less extrinsic value that you're
514.48s: getting for these so let's say if I
516.64s: wanted to roll these 210 that are
518.84s: trading let's call it 610 so the 210 are
521.92s: trading for 610 if I go out to that same
525.16s: expiration that we were looking at
526.72s: before the 16 DTE from the 10 and I go
529.84s: to those two 10 notice how I can't
532.64s: improve my basis anymore I can't get a
535.00s: net credit here these are only trading
537.08s: for 575 57 8 so because they're too far
541.84s: in the money and there's too much
543.20s: intrinsic value I've now lost the
546.24s: ability to go out as short as I could
549.00s: before and collect a credit I'm stuck at
551.64s: this strike unless I want to go further
553.28s: out in time so this is why when the
556.16s: stock price equals the strike price
558.32s: you'll have the most variability in
559.80s: terms of strike selection but you're
561.80s: going to be paying the most extrinsic
563.48s: value so the first question that comes
565.80s: into my mind here and the most important
567.84s: one in my opinion is actually this one
571.08s: right here what is my preference towards
574.08s: inventory do I want to take shares on or
577.48s: do I not if I don't want to take shares
580.60s: on that's going to inform my
582.40s: decision-making really this series of
584.56s: tradeoffs here which we'll touch on in a
586.32s: second if I don't care about inventory
588.52s: then I might feel a little bit
589.44s: differently expiration liquidity is
591.32s: another part of this puzzle if we take a
593.20s: look at expirations even in something
595.52s: like iwm that has a bunch of them notice
598.24s: how we can go from 1 day 3day 6 day 8 10
602.76s: 13 16 24 31 so what's happened here here
606.64s: we're going in 2day increments then we
608.96s: go 2day again but then all of a sudden
611.00s: we start going out full weeks then
613.00s: you'll notice it goes 3845 45 to 66 66
617.00s: to 101 what I'm showing you is
619.08s: expiration liquidity the way that these
621.16s: expirations are thought up is based on
623.36s: liquidity and near term options even
626.04s: with weeklys will have more expirations
628.68s: the closer into time you get typically
631.00s: within 60 days but once you get outside
633.76s: 60 days then the date Windows start to
636.84s: jump massively in this case you have 49
639.12s: days until you get to the next cycle and
642.20s: this can be even worse if you're trading
644.12s: something that's less liquid so if
645.88s: you're trading something like qld notice
648.12s: you don't have that many choices you go
649.44s: from 3 to 38 to 129 so expiration
652.60s: liquidity is actually really important
654.20s: part of this puzzle because my general
656.12s: disposition is to go as little far out
658.24s: in time as I can here's why if I'm in
660.76s: the position of Defending something
663.16s: that's not going in my favor so if we
665.88s: Zoom this out more and I'm going and I'm
668.48s: trying to fight this thing that's going
669.88s: in the wrong way you have a couple
671.68s: choices you could go really far out in
673.40s: time get a bigger basis adjustment but
675.92s: then if it keeps going down what's
678.12s: happening in that scenario is let's say
680.16s: you rolled it from this 10 to the 45 you
682.48s: get a really nice basis adjustment but
684.76s: let's say it keeps plummeting well now
687.04s: you can't really adjust your basis as
689.00s: much much because now instead of just
690.96s: being able to jump 30 days you're going
692.88s: to have to jump increasing periods of
695.60s: time that kind of lock you into holding
697.64s: the position even though something could
699.20s: be nose diving so it's very Market
701.28s: dependent but it's something to think
703.08s: about my typical disposition is if I'm
705.36s: defending a trade I want to go as little
706.92s: out in time so I can maintain spot price
710.48s: sensitivity so the last thing here is
713.36s: profit potential now if I have no
715.60s: inventory preference and expiration
718.52s: liquidity looks good meaning I have tons
720.04s: of choices then I'm going to look at
721.56s: which one gives me the most ways to make
723.92s: money and what that means is let's take
726.04s: a look at this example again if I go in
728.52s: this trade and again let's say that we
730.28s: have these 204s let's say that you
733.56s: choose to roll out to this 16 DTE so
737.48s: this 204 you would make more money if
740.00s: you kept it right here at the 204
742.24s: because you would collect more extrinsic
743.92s: value however your basis would be the
746.16s: same so if you wanted to roll out and
748.84s: then down to get away from being at the
751.20s: money and this is the same for the call
752.72s: side then all of a sudden you're
754.24s: collecting less Theta so your trade
757.32s: makes less money so this also becomes a
760.28s: pretty big calculus specifically for
762.08s: covered calls because if you have long
764.48s: shares and if you're able to roll up for
767.84s: your long shares that means that you're
769.92s: able to sell them instead of 203 at 204
773.16s: so you might sacrifice some of the time
776.00s: value of your options because you'll
778.40s: make more money on the long stock you
780.36s: have to look at that pretty carefully so
782.72s: this is really the series we're looking
785.24s: at though how do I feel about inventory
787.80s: what am I trying to do with my basis if
790.16s: I'm trying to more aggressively adjust
792.28s: my basis that tells me I'm going to
794.56s: sacrifice how much money I potentially
796.80s: am going to make in extrinsic value
798.88s: because I'm trying to get a bigger
800.00s: change in my basis the time value left
802.52s: in the options is always a tricky
805.12s: Prospect I prefer to let as much time
807.68s: value run away as I can
809.76s: however again if you do that and
811.80s: something Falls too far in the money
813.84s: that's when you get stuck and you can't
815.96s: adjust your strike or your bases anymore
818.36s: so again if you don't care about
819.56s: adjusting your bases then that probably
821.20s: doesn't matter so much you wait until as
822.76s: much of this is out as you possibly can
824.60s: if you do care about your basis or you
826.60s: do care about inventory then maybe we
828.84s: prioritize getting away from at the
831.44s: money and getting out of the money again
833.68s: whether it's a callor a put and then the
835.56s: last thing here is reminding us about
837.88s: that DTE liquidity the reason why I go
840.08s: from the 10 to the 16 is because it lets
842.64s: me slowly move my way out while I'm
845.28s: accelerating by the highest portion of
847.64s: theta Decay because again if we look at
849.52s: these 203s 204s they're moving at a dime
852.08s: a day in Theta if I go out to this 38
854.72s: DTE and I go to the at the money they're
856.64s: only losing 6 cents of theta way less so
861.48s: if my goal is to be spot price sensitive
863.68s: and maintain as much expiration
865.40s: liquidity as I can meaning if I roll to
867.60s: this 16 and then 5 days in it's not
869.64s: going well I can roll it again out to
871.92s: that would be the 19 at that point
873.60s: instead of the 24 DTE I have a lot of
875.96s: choices if things go against me I'm
878.40s: collecting less money up front because
880.04s: I'm going out very little in time but I
882.96s: want to go out as little in time and
884.76s: possible while achieving whatever my
887.40s: broader objective is for the role so for
889.56s: example if I wanted to get a really big
891.24s: basis adjustment if we go to this 10 DTE
894.92s: and you know we buy these 204s back in
897.36s: for 242 and we go go 38 DTE out notice
900.68s: you can go all the way to the 199s and
903.12s: get 242 you can get a few pennies in
905.68s: extrinsic value back to roll for Break
907.96s: Even or slight net credit but you're
909.64s: moving your bases five bucks from 204 to
911.96s: $1.99 so this is a way you can get a
913.92s: more meaningful basis adjustment but
915.80s: again then if you want to roll again
917.52s: you're not able to go from 10 to 16 DTE
921.20s: you're going to have to go from 38 to 45
923.24s: or what whatever else is there so it's a
925.60s: big consideration to make this is the
927.64s: general process that I follow I'm going
930.32s: to look at the market the portfolio
931.84s: review the trade make sure it still
933.04s: makes sense that there's nothing coming
934.28s: up that alerts me then I'm going to go
936.28s: through this series of analysis how do I
938.00s: feel about inventory how do I feel about
940.12s: making an aggressive adjustment to my
941.56s: bases or not and then where's the best
943.76s: profit potential I have affordable to me
946.04s: and what keeps me most adjustable to the
948.88s: market that I'm obviously defending
