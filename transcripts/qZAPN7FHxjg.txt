0.00s: Do you have a defined process for creating an option strategy?
4.48s: Do you even know where to start?
6.48s: The goal is videos to walk you through end to end and then to give you an example on what
11.68s: this can look like in a simple scenario.
14.44s: But the punchline is if you're going to trade for hopefully a long time, you have got
19.68s: to define a process for this.
21.68s: While strategies are different and they vary based on circumstances, the process to create
26.68s: one is not that different.
28.68s: And we can define a well thought out process that we can multiply and apply in a bunch
35.08s: of different scenarios so that this isn't a painful thing that we're forgetting pieces
40.52s: because we're just kind of cobbling it together as we go.
44.08s: What's up everybody?
45.08s: Eric here.
46.08s: Welcome back to the outliers.
47.08s: Shout out to the Patreon.
48.08s: Let's get right in.
49.08s: So don't be this guy.
50.08s: That's kind of the starting point.
51.32s: So you can see we have a person here that they put on a trade and they're asking a
56.96s: Reddit community, should I hold on to expiration?
60.28s: What's the problem here?
61.28s: The trades on like we are a daily dollar short.
64.20s: You should already know what you're doing before you put the trade on.
67.36s: Don't be this guy.
68.48s: This guy says I sold a put 511 expires today.
72.08s: It's trading below but now it's above why didn't I get assigned?
75.72s: So clearly they don't even understand the risk that they're taking with the strategy
81.40s: that they put on because again, they didn't build a strategy.
84.32s: They just put a trade on and they're hoping that it works out.
87.24s: Okay, I think that point's been made.
89.12s: So how does this work?
90.56s: As you can tell, we have kind of 11 broad steps here.
93.64s: We're going to run through all of them pretty quickly.
95.64s: Here's the thing.
96.64s: One of the most common mistakes I see new traders make when it comes to building a strategy
102.28s: is they pick a structure and then they just start trying to cobble together a strategy
108.60s: around the structure.
109.80s: The difference between a structure and option structure is a short call, long put.
113.80s: Those are structures.
114.80s: It's an iron condor.
116.28s: It's just a configuration of options.
118.08s: A strategy is how you use that configuration.
122.32s: What rules are applied.
123.96s: So the idea of saying I sell puts is superfluous because sometimes it might make sense to
130.64s: sell puts and other times it might not.
132.68s: There's no reason to be a put seller.
134.80s: There's a good reason to be a trader and trade what makes sense.
138.76s: So as we go through this process, you'll see the very first step here is pretty clear
142.52s: to find a purpose.
144.00s: What are we trying to do?
145.32s: Notice how this isn't pick a structure.
147.36s: We need to figure out what it is we're trying to accomplish.
150.08s: So what is the goal of this strategy?
153.00s: Are we trying to trade a bullish thesis directionally up?
157.36s: Are we trying to trade a bearish thesis when something's going down?
160.20s: Are we trying to trade volatility?
161.76s: Are we trying to develop something that allows us to have short beta weighted spy deltas?
167.96s: You got to start with what we're even looking for here.
170.96s: And once you do that, we should outline what the money making mechanism is.
178.08s: This is a core competency in trading that shockingly a lot of people have a giant gap.
184.28s: I have a video that talks about this a bit more.
186.92s: I'll throw in the notes below.
188.28s: But here's what this comes down to.
190.08s: A vertical doesn't make money.
191.88s: A long stock share doesn't make money.
195.60s: Long options don't make money.
197.16s: They need a condition to occur to make money.
201.16s: So the idea here is we're trying to identify the conditions that lead to making money.
207.72s: So is that you're going to trade things directionally to the upside.
211.72s: OK, that's a condition.
213.24s: We know if we buy low and sell high, we make money.
216.08s: We know that there's risk premium in SPX options, for example.
220.80s: That is a money making mechanism.
222.48s: You have to define what this thing is and then how it makes money.
228.16s: So from here, we move on to then determining what structures make sense.
233.36s: So based on if we're trying to trade a bullish thesis where if something is going up, we
239.56s: want to trade it to the upside directionally, what structures make sense for that?
244.24s: List them out.
245.24s: And I would start from simplest and move to more complex.
248.32s: So for example, if we want to trade something that we think is going to go up, you can
252.04s: buy shares.
253.04s: That's the simplest.
254.04s: Then maybe you can buy a call and sell a put so on and so forth.
257.48s: You can list out these different structures that work in this scenario.
260.36s: This is going to help us later.
262.16s: Then we need to create a basic rules set.
265.12s: So based on this idea of we want to trade something directionally to the upside, what
269.88s: are the rules that we want to apply on entering the trade, exiting the trade, and then how
275.16s: long are we looking to hold these trades?
277.12s: Again, if you trade options, guess what?
279.08s: You don't have the luxury of just picking a direction.
282.48s: All options have an expiration.
284.12s: So not only do you need to pick a direction, you also need to understand the severity,
288.20s: how much it's going to move or have an idea on that.
290.60s: And then you also need to have a time bound component.
292.88s: This is actually why options aren't always the right answer.
295.60s: It adds a lot of complexity that may not need to be there.
299.00s: But in any case, these are kind of just three basic rules that you can start with to develop
304.60s: a strategy.
305.72s: So based on this rule set, I would then test those rules with a few things in mind.
311.76s: The first one is I would start with a very big sample.
314.52s: I would use the largest sample I could find.
317.00s: So for example, if I'm trying to trade something in the SPX, that goes all the way back to
321.40s: the 20s.
322.40s: I will literally run a test from the 20s until the nearest data I have.
326.08s: Does that mean I'm going to treat all that data the same?
328.32s: No.
329.32s: But that doesn't mean that I'm not going to acknowledge it because it's so far gone.
333.84s: Old data still is relevance.
335.70s: So when I look at how do I then make this make more sense, I segment the data.
341.58s: So let's say I'm back testing 10 year period.
344.62s: I'll run a 10 year back test.
346.66s: Then I'll run two five year back tests.
349.94s: Then I'll do five to your back tests.
352.94s: Then I'll do 10 one year back tests.
355.46s: Why do I do that?
356.82s: Because this helps me see the path of the strategy.
360.26s: So for example, you can have something like this in T triple cues where let's say you
364.50s: were just buying T triple cues.
366.26s: And if you just test this broad data like, wow, you went from 36 cents to $59.
371.70s: That's a great return.
372.70s: That's perfect.
373.70s: Meanwhile, at one point, you were all the way up at $92 and it fell all the way down
378.18s: to $16.
379.82s: That's the path of something.
381.94s: So you might have something that has a crazy good return.
385.30s: But then once you analyze it closer, you might realize like, okay, this actually has like
388.46s: a 98% drawdown.
390.90s: Am I going to hold for that?
392.14s: Is that viable?
393.30s: Are there rules I can apply during that drawdown that make it easier?
396.98s: Who knows?
397.98s: But you have to be aware of the path that your returns take.
402.22s: Then from here, we start identifying more closely out of those different structures that
406.78s: worked.
407.78s: What are the best for our use case?
410.58s: So an example of this is let's say that you want to trade directionally and you actually
415.18s: want to use leverage.
416.18s: Well, that right out of the gate will probably get us away from using long shares.
421.06s: So you can apply kind of selection criteria like that.
424.62s: And once you finish doing so, we now codify it in its current form.
429.94s: You're going to be taken a bunch of guesses.
432.26s: Some of them might be good.
433.26s: Some of them might not be good.
434.54s: That's okay.
435.54s: That's part of the process.
436.54s: What we need to do is track them.
438.18s: So we use things like strategy outlines and trading logs.
441.90s: And specifically for the Patreon members, the outlier pro folks, you have free access
446.98s: to the shop that I have.
448.82s: So you can download templates for both of those from there.
451.58s: And if you aren't in the Patreon, that's okay.
454.14s: You can check out this video on the notes below that walks through an outline on how to
458.46s: create a strategy so that you can make your own without that.
462.82s: But the point being is unequivocally, you need to define what you're doing and then you
467.30s: need to track how that goes.
468.94s: This is how we objectively see what works by repeatedly testing and changing specific
475.34s: variables so that we understand their effect and then we can optimize them.
479.66s: Now you have to be careful between overfitting, but in general, if you're using a large sample
486.18s: then a segmented sample and then you're even getting into this next step where we're
489.82s: going to back test and forward test again, you're going to limit that inherently.
493.62s: So we want things that are robust.
496.30s: We want things that hold true in large samples and then also generally hold true in the smaller
501.34s: samples as much as possible or at least have observable patterns that we can then calculate
507.90s: different approaches off of.
510.06s: So once we get through this cursory back test, I think of it like working down a funnel.
514.50s: I want to start with the biggest funnel and then get more and more specific because you
518.26s: get more specific.
519.26s: It takes more time to analyze these things.
522.10s: So this next stage of back testing, forward testing, it's not super time consuming, but
527.02s: it gives us a chance to take a look at the rules set.
529.62s: Now you might be thinking, how do we even back test this stuff?
533.06s: There's different ways you can do that.
534.38s: You can either jump in a platform.
536.26s: I'm an affiliate of two of them, O rats and options, Omega.
540.06s: They're both in the links below for discount codes, but that's if you don't want to get
543.78s: your own data, but you are completely capable of getting your own data from Cebo and you
549.30s: can either run back tests and something like Python.
552.62s: It's up to you how you want to back test.
554.74s: If you don't want to do any of that, you could consider doing something like on demand
558.78s: and think or swim, which is free.
560.70s: But the thing is, is people feel like this data should just be available to them and it's
565.54s: not right?
566.54s: Like think about if you're a professional athlete, you need stuff to do your job and
571.34s: as a professional athlete, you're not necessarily paying for that stuff, but somebody does.
575.66s: It's not free.
576.66s: It doesn't just fall out of the sky.
578.02s: Somebody still has to buy the stuff that they use.
580.14s: It's the same thing here, but in this case, as a sole proprietor, you're by yourself.
583.74s: You have to buy it.
584.74s: You have to procure it.
585.74s: So I wouldn't come into this thinking that you're going to be able to just get fantastic
588.90s: data easily for free.
590.50s: It's just not reasonable.
592.54s: So then you can also pay for trade with different variations.
596.22s: I do this anyways, but this is also free, but it takes time.
600.54s: You only get to pay for trade with the market show you.
603.34s: And for example, I started trading in 2007 from 2007 until now, 2024.
608.22s: There's only been three bear markets and two of those have been in the last four years.
613.50s: What that means is if you just pay for trade at this, you're really getting a skewed view
618.38s: of the path something takes.
620.78s: So I really believe in paper trading.
623.06s: I do it with live strategies, kind of actually in this sustained optimization stage as well,
628.86s: but this stage here step nine is when we're actually trading it exactly as we think we
634.46s: would.
635.62s: And at the same time, we have different variations that we're also paper trading.
639.86s: So I kind of segment this into two buckets.
642.22s: I have the paper trading I'm doing to simulate my actual account and then I have the paper
645.90s: trading I'm doing to collect data.
648.14s: So the way I do that is the stuff I'm using to collect data.
650.58s: I'll put on tons of different trades, thousands of them and track them, right?
654.26s: I'm creating a data set.
655.34s: I'm not worried about actually doing that exactly as I would, but in the paper trading account
660.14s: that I'm testing as if it were live, I'm going to size things exactly as I would.
664.90s: I'm going to manage them exactly as I would because it gives me the best view of how
669.22s: this actually would work.
671.30s: And we have our live test is when you start using real money, none of this testing is ever
675.94s: going to be the same as using live capital.
678.22s: That's all there is to it.
679.22s: But the idea is we want to make as many mistakes as we can and get as much headway as we can
683.90s: before we're throwing capital at things.
686.42s: I know for the impatient people, I wasn't the beginning.
689.42s: This seems really painful in a waste of time, but the fact of the matter is, is you are
692.98s: far more likely to lose money than make it as a trader.
696.10s: So by not losing money unnecessarily and setting your account back further than it needs
700.66s: to go, you're actually moving faster in terms of compounding your capital.
705.66s: So going slow upfront actually will get you a speedier result in the long run.
710.54s: So what does this actually look like?
712.02s: I kind of outlined what this in large steps goes down like and here's kind of a quick
718.66s: flow.
719.66s: So in number one here, I'm saying I need long beta weighted spy delta.
724.42s: So that means I need something that goes up when the S and P 500 goes up.
728.14s: This can be whatever you want.
729.14s: This could be you need negative beta weighted spy delta so that you have some uncorrelated
734.02s: or non correlated returns.
735.90s: You could also say that I need non correlated returns to the S and P 500, whatever it is,
740.06s: whatever the use cases that you need to your portfolio.
743.18s: In this stage here, what I recommend to traders is have a specific use case in mind.
749.46s: Don't just think about building strategies for the sake of it.
752.10s: Think about what the market does.
753.26s: The market goes up.
754.26s: I need a strategy for that.
755.74s: Things go down.
756.74s: I need a strategy for that.
758.14s: If I trade volatility, I need a strategy to trade volatility when it goes up down sideways.
762.94s: So as I look across the toolkit, you can start to see that you don't need 35 different
767.42s: strategies.
768.42s: You kind of just need a handful because you need to be able to trade directionally up
772.18s: down.
773.18s: You need to be able to trade volatility up down.
775.42s: Maybe there's a couple of risk premium strategies in their momentum, premium strategies
778.74s: in their news announcement strategies in there, stuff like that.
782.02s: But they're not all unique.
783.46s: The way that I trade earnings is the very similar to the way that I trade FOMC meetings.
787.58s: I'm using the same structures, just modifying them slightly.
790.54s: So really think about how many strategies you need and what for we shouldn't just have
795.34s: a laundry list of stuff.
797.42s: Then I go through the rest of these stages to codify what I'm doing.
801.06s: Now getting down to kind of testing things.
804.34s: This is from using Python.
807.18s: And the cool part about this is it lets you test simple thesis.
812.02s: And if you wanted to test something like options, it starts to get a little more complex.
815.46s: You have to calculate them yourselves or buy historic data.
818.90s: So maybe if that's too prohibitive for you, you actually just see maybe a directional
823.82s: assumption.
824.82s: And then you can use logic to reason through the rest.
827.10s: For example, let's say that you don't have data to back test and you want it to understand
831.34s: which one would make you more money.
833.06s: Let's say that's one of the questions you have.
834.62s: Would it be long stock or long options?
837.62s: Well, if you put the same amount of money in both and you get the move in your favor,
841.58s: you're going to make money with long options.
843.50s: So you can also reason through some of this if you don't have access to the data.
848.70s: When I start pairing down these different choices, I think about the structures because
855.30s: is a long call the same thing as a short put?
858.74s: No, long calls have defined risk.
861.66s: They have undefined profit potential.
863.98s: So if the thesis that I'm trying to trade is directional momentum, meaning I want it
869.82s: to move a lot, would I prefer a long call or short put?
874.54s: Probably the long call.
875.54s: That's a better fit for that thesis, a directional momentum trade.
880.02s: If you trade a short put in that scenario, it could still make money, but you have a
884.54s: defined risk or a defined profit right out of the gate and undefined risk.
889.58s: So by understanding the qualities of the options, you can then use that to further narrow down
894.18s: what best fits again, what money making mechanism you are trying to capitalize on.
900.34s: Then we go down to these last steps.
903.82s: We're going to test multiple variations.
906.26s: We're going to use something like this, a strategy outline to document what we think we're
910.70s: going to do.
911.86s: And then we iterate on this process.
914.14s: A good example of this iteration and I'll throw a link in the notes below that talks about
918.82s: this exact thing where for zero DTE and even earnings for a long time, I favored
923.78s: straddles made more money.
925.94s: But with the markets over the last four years or so, I've actually started moving to
929.38s: strangles more frequently because I need the delta offset based on how the markets are
933.38s: behaving.
934.38s: So how did I come to that conclusion by this down here, by continually to optimize what
938.82s: I'm doing because if I just use the original analysis that I did and stopped, I probably
943.46s: would actually be losing money on some of those as compared to making money.
946.38s: You have to continue to adapt your strategies to what the markets are doing.
949.90s: That's the name of the game, more traders.
952.02s: That's our job.
953.02s: See what the market is doing.
954.02s: Fit your toolkit to the market to make money.
957.62s: Like, subscribe, share, be an outlier.
959.42s: See you all later.
