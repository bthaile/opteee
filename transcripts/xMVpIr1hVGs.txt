 What's up everybody Eric here and I am back with you and I've tricked him into another conversation. We have a lot of interesting things that I want to talk to you about. We're starting a new year. I think it will be really interesting to get some of your thoughts on last year this year. There's a handful of other things that I wanted to talk to you about. One of which I was giving you a little bit of a preamble before we started recording, which is a purchase I'm making and I want to get your thoughts. But before we get into all of that, welcome back yet again. It's good to start the year with you. Thanks for having me. I feel sorry for you that you haven't got anyone more interesting to talk to that you've had me back three times in what three months or something. But it's fun to be here. Yeah, I think the cool thing I like about you is it's very straightforward conversation. A lot of people that I talk to. Yeah, there's a lot of nebulous pieces to the conversation and I think from like a listening perspective, I am a very known nonsense guy. I just prefer to ask a question, talk about whatever that is. And you have a lot of depth behind what you talk about. Plus, I mean, most of us are options traders. So really you're our guy. So whether whether or not you like us were here. And the audience. I'm pretty awesome. So I can see what. I mean, based on what you were telling me about your distilling practices and the level of clarity you can get in your alcohols. I mean, that is pretty impressive to me for anybody that's interested in moonshine and whatnot. We were just talking about that. And apparently you and with saying that he has the best moonshine on planet earth. He labeled it as it will not kill you, which is, you know, about bringing him endorsement as you can think of. Yeah, I've still got some. I'll send you some. I actually'll bring some at one. I'm in California. When you coming out next week. No way. Where you going? Palm Springs. Oh, cool. Yeah. I if yeah, I mean, I'm I literally work from home. So I can always pop over a link up with you. That'd be kind of cool. Palm Springs right now. I think is it getting rain or no? Cause it's been raining here actually a lot in San Diego. I don't know. I mean, if it gets rain, it's going to be for a few days and we can live with it. It's going to whatever the weather is there. It'll be better than it is here. Fair enough. Yeah, I guess that's fair. Yeah, it's it's actually been warm. And I think it's supposed to be really nice. Like we got the sun out today. It's the first day in a little while. We've been getting a bit of a storm mostly up in North cow. So you probably are right up in the desert. So the very first question I want to talk to you about is the purchase decision. So I am car shopping and I need something else to juxtapose against the quervet. And I figured you would have a strong opinion on this. So I'm ready to hear it, which is what are your thoughts on McLaren since you've spent some time over there. And you are a car kind of sort of yourself. I know you were for our guy. So I already know we're starting off on the wrong foot, but I'm curious what your thoughts are. I feel like I should like McLaren's more than I do, but the Bruce McHaren was a key week. So I've got a kind of a kinship there. And if you actually remember the Ford versus Ferrari movie. Yeah. Three of the guys who finished in the post Ford cars were New Zealanders. Like New Zealanders used to be legit good at sports car racing. I don't know why you know people go. And countries go through little patches where there are good people and then other people follow them and so forth. But anyway, Bruce McHaren was in New Zealanders. So I feel like I should like them more than I do. Very good cars, but they don't I don't know. They don't really seem to have a lot of. I don't know. They just don't really appeal to me. They just don't do it. You've got to be really careful with is if you find one that's being dinged, they are incredibly expensive to repair because they sit on this carbon fiber tub. Right. It's not a matter of just hammering it out. It's that's a real problem. I mean, not good. I'd rather get one that a Porsche. So I was looking at the super car. I was looking at the Porsche's and the problem is I like I respect them. I like them. But I just have a hard time with a six cylinder in a in a play car. So I superficial as that is. I've been in a couple of them and they just don't. They don't yeah do it for me that way. The Aston Martin's I think they're really, really classy beautiful cars, but they're just heavy. They're heavy as all get out. Well, they're not sports cars. Yeah. Have you ever have you ever own one or driven one? I nearly bought a DB eight a long time ago. Because they were kind of like the English muscle car. Right. Look a little bit like 70s Mustangs. They do. The problem with old ones is they just don't work. They're terribly, but really badly built. The new ones are fine. They're friendly bought one. I've driven them that great. They're fine. But any car you buy now is going to be going to drive really well. I mean, you can't buy a bad car. You buy a Kia is going to drive better than any Ferrari of 40 years ago. You know, cars are much better. I just. The big thing about a McLaren though is you're not going to see them every day. You know, I see Porsche's every day. Yes. No one no one gets excited when a Porsche turns up, but a McLaren still. Yeah. I can get it. I can get one. I can they just don't do much for me, but that's not great cars. Do you like do you prefer the naturally aspirated V10 V8 platform versus the forced induction? I'm curious if that's part of your calculus. Oh, I got. There's nothing better than a V12. There it is. If you've ever driven a V12, that is so smooth and they sound so good and they've got all the power of a V8 with the smoothness of a straight six. That is the best. But I've really got a problem with turbos. I mean, they do. A good turbo set up is quite good for avoiding sort of dead spots in your power curve and stuff. I've got a problem with them. Yeah. Many of my favorite cars happened to have them, but an old turbos were terrible. If you ever drive like a sob turbo from the 80 or I think what else was turbo charged back then? Oh, yeah, the Lotus with the turbo. Yeah. Terrifying cars because they didn't do anything. They had a huge turbo lag and then it would just come in and suddenly you get an extra 100 horsepower. It was like driving a two stroke motorbike. I think it's one of the funnest turbos I think is every once in a while they just come on and punch you right in the face because the Corvette I have supercharged around that, which I really, really like. So that's actually one of the draws to the McLaren for me was that it has the twin turbo. I like there's a lot of stuff you can modify slightly with that, which I like. So I checked out a couple of the Ferraris, one of which was the 488 GTB. And I liked it, but I just I don't know. It didn't it didn't really do it for me. I'm not. Yeah, I don't know. It didn't tickle my fancy, I suppose. I don't I'm not a huge fan of the Ferrari sports cars. Yeah. The Ferrari GTs are really amazing, classy, beautiful, wonderful cars. The sports cars are great, but they don't. I don't know. They didn't I didn't really appeal to me as much. Supercharges, though, are different to turbos and that that kind of halfway between naturally aspirated and a turbo. Exactly. Much smoother power delivery. Well, twin turbos help because you can have a big one and a little one. You can have the spinning it, coming in a different periods and stuff. Yeah, exactly. And then depending on. And also they make that whining noise so you can pretend you're mad Max. Yeah. I think that's the best part. Yeah. Well, the other thing, especially with like things like 85, right? And variable timing, you can really smooth out most of the power curve. I mean, really the main drawback for people on supercharges, at least, is the parasitic loss because it's belt driven. But I mean, one, they're very efficient now, but two, obviously none of these are for gas. Well, the total is the total horsepower you get out, even if it's not as efficient as a turbo, it's still better than if you don't have it on there, right? By far, and I mean, my favorite part is with superchargers now they come on quick. It's there's there's no lag, right? As soon as I get above 2000 RPM's, I'm getting what I'm getting off the belt. Yeah. Yeah. Supercharges went out of fashion for a long time, but yeah, they seem now everyone's putting supercharges and turbos on so you get the best of both worlds. I know that that cross pollination I actually think is really fascinating. I know kidding was thinking about that for a little bit on the Corvette, because that's kind of turned into my Frankenstein. I just have a bunch of parts laying down on the garage and every once in a while, I'll just slap some different ones on and see what it behaves like. And that does seem like a really fascinating setup. I just do not have the skill set for tuning that just yet. I can tune most of the rest of the car, but that is a little outside of my wheelhouse. Yeah, I can see that, especially with the, you know, the ECU's you've got on these cars now. It's no matter just bolting the ball and isn't putting it. Yeah, bingo. And especially like this set up on the Corvette right now, I have two ECUs essentially to handle the different fueling systems and that already is challenging enough. But well, I'll be honest, you shocked me. I thought that it was going to be a the imminent dislike of them, a clarin, but I figured there might be part of you that liked some of it because of your your background. So I mean, that great cows, they just don't grow up. Yeah, which I think is totally fair. I find that with a couple of the other things I was looking at night. I mean, that's the beautiful part of American consumerism in general is, you know, there's so many viable alternatives here because I've talked to some of my other friends who were in like Australia and whatnot. And they can get other cars, right? It's not like they don't have any cars, but for some of them, it's like really restricted. Like it's difficult. You're essentially starting to ship things. They end up costing twice as much to you. And the other thing about America is gas is almost free. Right. How expensive you think it is compared to the rest of the world. It's really cheap. Oh, yeah. Urances ridiculously cheap. Like ensuring it Ferrari and London is going to cost you, you know, like 50,000 bucks a year or something ridiculous. I just made that. I just made that up. But it's a very, very high number. Like I don't I don't motorbike there and it cost me as much to ensure it every years by paid for the bike. I mean, at that point, I would just what's what's the penalty if you get caught without it? Like I. Oh, yeah, it's you've got to have it. It's bad. Got it. And also the other thing is, um, they get stolen. There's a problem. Right. So I only had that bike eight months and someone stole it. So you know, I came out of here on the shirts. Yeah, it's so easy. Even here in San Diego, there's a big problem because I mean, you literally just need two dudes and they can pick it up and put it in a pickup truck and that's it. Yeah, that's what they did. I had a chain on it that was like as big as an anchor chain on a baffle ship. And they just don't bother. They just pick it up sick and an event and take it away and deal with it later. Exactly. 100%. 30 seconds. Yeah, it's the I mean, they're just not that heavy, especially, you know, a lot of bikes. It's funny. You don't see that happen with some of like the BMW 1200 GS is because those are just fat. They're heavy. But yeah, that's probably only weighed, you know, three 50, 400 pounds. Yeah, too easy. That's an easy pick up. Well, I want to pivot us over for a little bit to the markets. 2022, interesting year. It for me, at least, I talk about it pretty regularly. I started trading in 2007. So not that long ago, 15 years ago now. And last year technically was like the third and only the third down year in the S&P 500. Since I started trading, which I think just kind of highlights the regime overall that I've been trading through mostly. I walked out the years still pretty handsomely profitable, which I'm thankful for. I think it was the final culmination of this skill set I've been working on for some time. And then it final. I just saw a different market, which obviously benefited a lot of the strategies that I use, which I just want more volatility, which I mean, we did get that. But from your perspective, obviously way more time and experience in the markets than me, I'm just curious as you look back at 2022. If you were to share some of your initial thoughts, what does that look like? Well, my first thing you said it was an interesting year and you've got to get over there. I mean, the market shouldn't be interesting. You'd like that on a. On that sort of level, you should be interested in your process and interested in doing what you're doing. But I mean, until you told me the market was down the third time and what I mean, I don't know, I didn't know that. I don't care. It's like it doesn't. People seem to think you need a different process of the markets going down and the markets going up. But the problem with that is you don't know that in advance. You can say we're in a bear market, but that just means we have been going down. And if you're good enough, frankly, to say that that's going to continue, I don't know why you're trading options. You should just be trading futures. It's an awful lot easier. So if you don't have a process that can be broadly applied in an up market or a down market, you've got a problem because you cannot predict that in advance. That's why we trade options. We trade because of volatility, which we can predict in advance. That's that's why options are good because you're trading something more predictable. You've got other problems, but at least you can predict the main profit driver. So that would be my first takeaway is like, you know, it was just another year. I mean, the only thing I've seen genuinely different. I've seen two things genuinely different in the market because the market goes up. The market goes down. I mean, something has to happen, right? I mean, a year is 365 days. That time gets filled with some crap. Right. So it's usually like whatever's driving the market, the market goes up. The market goes down. The Fed does this. The Fed does that. Oil does. It's all the same apart from all the banks going bankrupt in 2008, 2009. That was a big change because that was like the entire system was threatened. The only other thing that I remember and it's a much more minor thing was the blowups of the volatility ETFs in 2020. No, God, long time ago, 2018 or something. That was different. Like because that was a. Something that was endogenous to the structure of the ETN. It wasn't a volatility effect. It was because of the way they structured this thing and the way they had to rebalance it. But other than that in 2022 was just a it was a year. Things happened. The interesting thing about it. Was VIX is elevated still. I mean, VIX is it's not often that VIX stays this far above its long term median. It's not that long. I mean, it's it's it's unusual. But it's more unusual is that volatility of VIX is really low. And usually there's a very strong correlation between the VIX level and the volatility effects. Now, that's kind of an observation. There's no money to be made there. Volatility of VIX should be low because it's not moving. So purely as an observation, you can't make any money out of it because. Well, you can't make any money out of levels or prices. You need something to change to make money. But that would be one of those things where I think you should look at your process. And like, okay, so volatility is high. So you might have been trading a certain way in the past based on that. But is that actually contingent on volatility of volatility being high as well? I see. Because that is a correlation that's always held on the past and might not now. So that I think trading and volatility regimes, you can modify your process and you should. Trading and bear markets and bull market regimes. I think that's that's a fool's errand trying to fit your process to that. It's interesting. And I actually that's one of the reasons why I really enjoy talking with you because I know that you're very dedicated to the volatility trading craft. And I think for me, I look at last year in another interesting aspect to it, at least in my opinion, was just the relationship between equities and bonds. And there was actually at least for a good period of time, some good pairs trades. I think that we're able to construct on that. Do you trade pairs and things like that when their typical relationships are out of whack or do you kind of just stick to the volatility trading because that's more your real house. I don't really trade interest rate products at all. I mean, I have a little bit in the past. The correlation between bonds and stocks is a lot trickier than I think people think. It either goes really positive for a while or really dig it in for a while, depending on exactly what people are worried about. You know, whether it's, are we worried about inflation? Are we worried about a recession? It's that is something I've never got involved in. And I would be very cautious about doing that based on any sort of macro views you might have because those you might as well be guessing. Whatever you think your macro views are, it's very unlikely that better than market consensus. It's just no ones have ever proven to be in the long run. So the chances that you will that guy is pretty slim. So the other reason I avoid bonds is they're not volatile enough. There's not really enough change in going on for me to do anything with them. The people I've known who've been very successful in interest rates have all been doing spreads along the curve. Yeah, and that I imagine they're probably mostly trying to take advantage of the leverage as well because bonds do offer depending on what product you're trading like bond futures offered pretty good leverage. Yeah, and they'll be trading the fives against the tens against the 30s or euro dollars trips against the fives. And so, you know, they're trading the more recently leveraged stuff and they're trying to make half a tech on it. It's a different game. It's it's not in no way is it a retail game. Right, right, right. Yeah, I think that's fair. I mean, I actually found last year I know that this is a necessarily your approach, but I found directional options trading to be pretty profitable. There is a handful of of things that I was able to do specifically like ratio put diagonals, which I like quite a bit. But again, I know you tend to focus more on the volatility side of stuff. Looking at. And if you do that and you make money, that's great. That's no problem. You know, you're not making money off me. I'm not going to be better or twisted about it. That's great. You've done well. All I would say is make sure you P and L things separately. Yes, you've got a Delta P and L. And you've got a volatility P and L, which is basically everything that isn't your Delta P and L. Because a lot of times what you think is making your money isn't really what's making your money. And that makes it really hard to improve or to know when things are going badly. So if you find out all your money is coming from the Delta, give up on the options. You should be trading the Delta because it's an easier. You should always trade the simplest thing you can. Right. Or maybe all your money is coming from the volatility side in which case, you know, don't do the Delta stuff. When you're doing multi-dimensional stuff and I do this for options as well, because. Options have tons of different risk factors. You've got to break out where you P and L is coming from in each case. Because the more that is, the more you can learn. Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. I think one point that I do slightly disagree with you on is just the idea of trading options solely for volatility. And if it's essentially not a volatility component or, you know, the majority of the profits coming from volatility. You should trade Delta one products. And the only reason I say that is there's an efficiency component with options that I can't get with Delta one products. Totally, you know, respect your point, especially as it pertains to volatility being the largest driver essentially when we're talking about options. But I do think that there's something to be said about the overall product efficiency of options, specifically, it pertains to leverage. Like if I buy a leap that's 500 and something days out that I'm pretty convicted on at least either following a trend or an interim price movement. It's going to perform better for me. Then if I buy the Delta one product provided that I'm not stepping in the face of volatility and getting my face ripped off with that. I can see that, but I think what you're doing is making the best of a bad situation. You're not you're doing what the best you can, but you're not doing what the best is in an ideal world. So I mean, we all have we all have issues with what we can trade like that. I mean, there are sometimes I see it, oh, I want to do a VIX futures trade. But I don't have I don't have a futures account. So I can't just say, oh, I do the VIX futures instead of I don't know VXX or whatever. So I mean, we all have limitations like that. And you have to do the best within them. But you also have to sort of realize that sometimes what you're doing wouldn't be the best in an ideal world. So yeah, no, and it's super well received. So. I mean, so let's say with options as well as if you're trading sort of semi part time and you can't sit in front of your screen all day. Options do give you that automatic stock process. You know, and that is that is about that. That's what you're paying for. And so if you are, I don't know semi professional or retail or whatever, if you're not a full time pro, then that does give some benefits as well. I mean, options do exist for a reason. Yeah. So following that same thread. And let's say that that same scenario, right? Let's say if I have a bearish theme and something and I want to trade it to the downside. And rather than what would you just short the Delta one product if that is your primary theme and accept the carrying cost of the short. And then just manage the and I know that you to preface all of that. I know that that's not necessarily your style of trading. This is all just an hypothetical. But would you trade the short stock, including the carrying cost and then just manage your risk via a stop or whatever the cases versus buying a long dated deep in the money put and something like that. I would probably end up doing that, but it wouldn't be there would be the result of a process rather than a dogmatic decision. So first thing I do is look to see what the implied vol looked like relative to my forecast ball. Maybe the options are cheap. When that does happen, the other thing I'd look at is what the implied skew was like. If it was an index, I probably wouldn't because you're overpaying for the ball and the skew. But for a lot of stocks, you're not. So if it was stock, maybe maybe I'd do an option. I mean, could possibly. But I probably given the fact options are usually over price given the fact skews usually over price. I probably would end up just shorting the stock. Yeah, yeah. And I think that mean something like you VIX or you VIXE right. We know it decays right. If you've just shorted it, you've made a ton of money over the years. If you bought pots, you haven't. Because you're paying such a high vol level for them. But they just, they're just a bad bit. You're just paying too much for the viewpoint you have. Right. Right. Yeah, that makes total sense to me. Because I think one of the, the primary inputs at least in what I do. Anytime I touch an options, really. A lot of it is inspired from reading your work. If, if I don't have at least some level of volatility opinion, I wouldn't typically trade it. So it makes sense to integrate that. I was actually doing a bit of testing. I don't know if you've read the book. I think it's called the, the second light down. Yeah. Yeah. And that's been a really interesting read to me. One of the things from that book you talked about was just the centralization of various risk premiums in indices. And they were looking at different delta's to see, you know, where that skew or that variance risk premium tends to trend. And they were identifying with something around a 25 delta. I'm curious if that falls in line with what you've seen or if you've actually studied that. I know you've looked at a ton of stuff. And have you seen that? Yeah, I actually wrote a paper of it last year. Got published started last year. Yeah, I'm looking at all the risk reversals in all of the different ETFs and different indices. Actually, it's more like the 15 delta. 20 delta. It's slightly lower. But yeah, that's true. I would that is a good book, by the way. So I'm not criticizing the book necessarily, but I do. I mean, there aren't many good books, but that is one of them. I do take issue with that being a volatility premium. Because if you just trade, if you try to reach a hedge risk reversal. And you compare that to just selling the straddle. And you'll find that you have that correlated, but not 100%. It's a different risk factor. So I kind of think of it like the same way that the market, the stock market has value factors and size factors. I think volatility surface has different factors as well. I think there's a variance factor. There's a skew factor. But yeah, if you're going to sell options in indices, start with the 15 20 delta range. When that's normally where you get the most bandwidth, you buck. That makes sense. And another interesting follow on this was one that I was doing myself was just testing different styles of broad portfolio hedges, either using index itself spy I WM, something like that. Or using volatility. And I know there's obviously tradeoffs between using those two products. One of the things I found interesting was I use a program that essentially lets me trade live, but pre like historical days, right? So I can like rewind and time and trade that day as it was. And one of the things I noticed that was pretty interesting was volatility's behavior during something like 2020 during the crash that we saw around March. That seemed to greatly outperform using any sort of put strategy as the hedge kind of ideal circumstances for that spy or the volatility hedging strategy. One of the things I'm curious about is I was thinking that volatility was so underpriced because leading into volatility or leading into 2020. We've had just a sustained bull market. Does that rule or does that experience carry more as a rule where volatility can serve as a more effective general broad portfolio hedge versus using something like beta weighted, you know, puts in a index itself because those tend to be overpriced. That's a really, really big question. Every hedge tends to be overpriced and that shouldn't hold you back because you're paying for insurance. You're doing it not to make money. People sometimes can flate a hedge with it being a different trade. And they want to make money on both sides of it and that's just not going to happen. If you think stocks are going to go down, settle your stocks that you have a hedge in place because you think things are going to go down, but if you're wrong and you can't get out of the way. So you have to pay for that privilege and whether it's a stop, whether it's an option, whether it's volatility, it's it should cost you money. You want it to cost you money because that means the rest of your portfolios making money. The optimal way to do stops is a really difficult question. And it's a very involved question. I'm actually working on it now trying, I'm sort of tying stops and options and the Kelly criteria and all into one thing. So I figure when I've done it, it will annoy practically everyone in the world because all of those annoy people. Yeah, it's a it's a very difficult, very general question. I would say the other thing is if you're hedging, if you're hedging something, you should probably hedge it with or something on that something. Right. So if you're hedging stocks, you should hedge it with stock options or a stop in the stocks. Oftentimes people get too clever and they try to hedge a product with something else they think is correlated. And the problem is when something disastrous happens, those correlations can break. So you would have seen that if someone had tried to do a hedge on. You vexie with VXX options, when VXX went through that problem where they weren't redeeming those those correlations completely broke right and you're not hedged. So I would say if you've decided you're going to hedge, it's almost always a better move to hedge it with the actual thing. So hedge your stocks with stock options or stock futures. I wouldn't do a cross product hedge because you're just adding another problem on top of things. And the reason you do a hedge is because you're like, there are some situations in the future that I won't understand right now. So don't try and get too smart. Yeah, I think that makes a ton of sense. And I think at least from my perspective, I actually just about never hedge. I just kind of use sizing as the primary risk control protocols, but I like looking at them. I find them fascinating, especially the way that they behave. And the thing I was really looking at there as I was wondering if the outperformance I saw in VX in 2020 relative to hedging again via puts of different deltas of different expirations in the in the indices himself was because we had such a pro long period of low volatility leading into 2020. And I think that's just outrageously cheap comparatively or if that's, you know, kind of just general behavior for them. It's really hard to tell the public analyzing things like that is we just don't have many examples. I mean, the fix has only been around since 1990. It's only been tradable since 2003. So we haven't had many sort of genuine panics. So we anyone who claims that's one of those things I'll be like, maybe I can't claim to know because no one can claim to know we haven't had enough. I mean, we haven't had enough evidence to do it. I would say that just because vol's low doesn't mean it's a good time to buy it because it can stay low for a very long time. Like vol was exceptionally low for like three years in the 2000s. So if you decided that you're going to buy the VIX because it was 12, even though the VIX, I don't know if it's trading back in. I mean, you would you would pay carry on that for four years before you would have made money. So it's one of those things that timing is really important. Right. And I think that's kind of the general hypothesis I had was it was so low because of exactly that because people would have been. So low for so long, because there wasn't a volatility. Another question that I got from somebody that actually thinks really interesting, they were talking about the the risk free rate because for some of the people that started trading in 2020, essentially, you know, it was not so. Does that factor into the way you trade options beyond the fact that risk free rate is obviously priced in we know that. But I'm curious if the movement of risk free rate or the trend of risk rate anything like that of that factors into your calculus. It doesn't really for a couple of reasons. First, most of the stuff I trade is complete garbage that has enormous borrow rates on it. So, you know, if you're trading a stock with a borrow rate of like 60%. That's your main consideration for what the fair value is going to be not the interest rate, whether it's the interest rates 2% or 4%. The other thing is most of the options I trade are very short dated. I mean, honestly, I still think you can pretty much ignore interest rates as an option trader. I don't really think they're a big deal. And especially like row is going to be such a small risk component to you that it's going to be overwhelmed by other considerations. Sure, you might make or lose money if interest rates change because of row, but you're probably going to make or lose a lot more money because of something else. And you can't hit you anyway. It's just one of those things. If you find yourself selling or only puts and no calls, you might have your interest rate set too low in your system. But that's pretty much the only thing I'd worry about. Got it. Yeah, essentially that was generally what I was expecting you to say because it does seem. Yeah, it seems like it gets priced in as we move along. So at least from a retail trading perspective, I think one of the parts of the question they were trying to identify was, does that change like risk to reward calculations? And for me, it didn't seem like it, but I assume it does a bit. And I think people neglect carry more than they should. If you're, if you're doing something like, I don't know, selling you, right. You might think, well, that's a great trade because it's down 15% this year or whatever it is. Yeah, except there's a 9% borough rate on it. Right. So that makes a major difference. And you don't see that in your calculations because you're looking at the price of it. You don't see this interest rate payment draining out of your account each day. You don't do neglect it. But the effect on options because the option premiums low. Right, that's why you like options compared to trading the underlying. So the amount of carry on the option premium isn't an enormous consideration. I mean, yeah, you should probably think about it, but I wouldn't think about it very hard. I've got other problems. It's way down the list. Right. I'm worried about my row. I know it's been a very, very quiet time. Got it. Now, another 2022 question for you. Did any of your trades specifically stand out and if so why? I remember there was one from our previous conversation that I was actually curious about. I was saying that I don't know if it was from last year from a time before that, but essentially you were explaining your book, which is a lot. You carry a lot of positions at least compared to like most retail traders. I'm typically below 100. But you were explaining that there was something. It was a biotech stock or whatever that you were trading volatility on that essentially like imploded. Oh, yeah, but that happens all the time. I know I can't I think. This is there's a bit of a dichotomy, right? One of the things about trading is it's like the Alice and Wonderland thing. You've got to hold diametrically opposed views in your head at the same time and you've got to be comfortable with that. So one of the things about trading is you have to learn from your mistakes. Because a lot of people think that if you do something for 10 years, you're going to get better at it. But you want unless you examine your mistakes and learn actively learn. But the other thing is it's kind of good and a way to forget all these trades in a way they should all just blur and together. Because it should be like asking, you know, I don't know a cabinet maker. You know, do you remember anything particularly eventful about the cabinets you made in 2015? You're like, I don't know. I went to work. I picked up a wood. I did the same stuff. I always do it. So I started to think about that when things are going well, probably shouldn't remember stuff. It should be the process. It should just be a thing you do every day. Like the biotech imploding, yeah, but it was a biotech this week that went up 50% yeah, was that you've even been able to do what it was. I don't know. I mean, I never even care. I don't know why it happened. I just knew that it could happen because you can see it price in the options. So that happens all the time when you're trading garbage like I do. So unless it happens to like five or six stocks on the same day, it's a decent chance like don't even really notice it, which is how I like it. Right. Fair enough that it's, yeah, generally unremarkable. Was there anything that you changed in your approach for last year compared to the year before or the year before that? Incrementally, I mean, I changed things all the time incrementally. There's always an evolution, but I wouldn't say there was any sort of dramatic revolution rechange. I'm always tweaking models, testing models. This year I've been working a lot on the portfolio construction, rather than just having, I'm selling these and buying these, trying to wait the more more appropriately. And that's actually a really difficult problem because it's really easy to just overfit things to what they did in the past. So that's, I mean, I'm always working on stuff like that because the actual trading is fairly automated. So you should always be doing that, but it's not like I'm like, oh, stop doing that. Now I'm going to do pairs trading or something. Sure, sure. With the exception of the crypto stuff I got tied up in, which was genuinely a different game. And very unique. I mean, yeah, I think. Yeah, the whole structure of that market was different. And you could do carry trades on crypto and make 20% a year, whereas that's just not going to happen in the equity world, you know. Right, right, right. Yeah. So then that leads into kind of a follow on question. Then as I assume we already know the answer based on what you've shared so far, but looking at 2023, are there any like themes that you're interested in or is it generally, said or as parabes just continue to deploys you to typically do? Yeah, I think so. There are things that could affect me in better ways or worse ways, but the things I don't have any real control over. So, and I can't really predict them. So I would like it. If some of the retail flow got out of front week options and went into the backs. I'd like it if the retail flow stopped trading. I think 50% of its ETFs, because there's another 3000 stocks that I'd love some more volume in. If that happens, you know, in five years ago, we wouldn't afford all this retail would have come in and started trading weekly options to the degree they have. Right. So if that happened, that'd be great for me, but I can't really do anything to prepare for that. I can't convince people they should do that. So that's kind of like most of my things. There's a ton of things that could happen to me, but I'm kind of at the mercy of the world. Right. And like what actually happens. That's fair. Yeah. Is retail moving into the other products? Is that more like your saying just for liquidity to provide liquidity or? Yeah. It's. If you look at how many products actually trade more than 1000 options a day, it's about 800. Right. So there's a lot of listed stuff that just doesn't trade. And of those 800, an awful lot of them are going to be trading less than 2000 a day. So any sizable position I want to put on is really. It's one of the problems with my portfolio. It's like I would happily sell 20,000 options, but that is just not going to happen. Right. So I can't wait that the way I wanted to. It's also a problem incidentally with a lot of academic papers. When you actually go through the details of what they did, you'll find they did a long short portfolio, but you look at the shorts they put on and you're like, yeah, none of that would have been possible. I see. So yeah, I'd prefer it if there was someone to trade against. I've like some more volume than some of the stuff. It's interesting. And I think that, you know, this is part of the conversation that retail traders were always taught. Or told at least, you know, that retail traders are, you know, the most disadvantaged people, you know, yada yada yada, which I agree with a lot of that to some degree, but I always maintain for retail traders. One of the beautiful things about a lot of what we do is even if you have, you know, a $10 million portfolio, you can still very reasonably move into and out of most things. But, you know, for portfolios that are larger, you know, institutional side, you know, they run into this liquidity problem like you're talking about, even more and Buffett talks about this. There is an interesting interview I saw with him. I forgot how old it was, but this is actually the same thing. People are saying, you know, well, why don't you spread into more things if you're able to find all of these undervalued companies? He said, because I can't, there's nothing for me to do there. There's not enough depth. And, you know, I think that's just a point that a lot of retail traders don't fully understand. But, I think people, I think you're overestimating the liquidity as well, though. If you're trading SPX, you've got to remember options and volatility are a tiny bit of the financial universe. Tiny compared to equity and bonds and currencies. The stuff we do might as well not exist. We are, we are fleas on a horse. And if you want to trade the SPX options, though, I don't care how big you are. You know, you can have a billion dollars in trade, those. But if you want to trade a wide book of equities, you would have trouble with 10 million bucks. If you had decent margin, I don't know what I be would give you. But if you had professional level margining, that could be difficult, a 10 million dollar portfolio. If you've got 10 million bucks, you are really limited in the stuff you can trade. You're probably limited to the top 100. Yeah, and I think that that generally rings true. It's actually, you know, part of the product selection, I typically go through anyways is built around the index ETFs. And it's a lot of it is just because I'm lazy and a lot of it's easier for me. One of the the following questions I had based on the last point for you, though, is when you're looking at the positions as you're building your book. And you have this limit in liquidity. Obviously, it can be difficult to exit some of the positions I presume at a fair price, especially in some of the biotech stuff. If they have really wide varied volatility, how do you handle that? Okay, so if I, if I could, I would like to trade like six month options and take them off after about three months. Because that means I'm much less exposed to gamma. I have much lower hedging costs. It becomes much more of a pure volatility play. It's much cleaner. The problem is first, there's a lot less liquidity as you go further out like this. And the other thing is like you say, getting in one thing. I could always just hang around. Maybe I get in. Maybe I don't. But if I have to get out, then I'm in trouble. You have to do something that liquidity is a big deal. So because of that, I'm pushed way more towards the fronts. And I would say, I don't know, 80% of my positions, probably I hold to expiration. That's a big problem. And it sort of takes you away from theoretically where you want to be to practically where you have to be. Yeah. I mean, is expiration risk or pin risk is that something that impacts you or not so much? Oh, it does. But today I had possible problems with about three stocks. So it's not normally a huge deal. And I mean, it's, it, it was always there. But I mean, I know that's something I can live with because I can trade the underlying. I can, if you're right, very close to expiration that's normally you can get out easier than you can if it's a four month option. Because other people are looking at it. If you're sitting right on the strike as well. Right, right. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. I had one other question for you. And I think we've kind of talked a little bit about it so far. But a lot of the people that I interact with have like really small accounts. It's essentially like $25,000 and less. And you know, I always commensurate with the series of tradeoffs that they have to make. And one of the questions that I got somebody was asking in that scenario. Let's say you have a 10 or $20,000 account, whatever. And you want to trade derivatives specifically for the leverage. But you're less interested in trying to extract just volatility in and of itself. But you're trying to play a trend. What are your thoughts on that broadly speaking? Well, it goes back to what you were saying before. It's not the ideal way to monetize that view. But it might be the best way that this person can. So what I would do in a situation like that is look for. What for situations where you are overpaying by the least amount possible. So I wouldn't be. I wouldn't be buying 20 delta calls, you know, because they are very speculative. That out of the money now. Yeah, you'll get great leverage on them. But they're probably going to end up worthless. And then you're going to get a lot of options like that. I mean, maybe. Buy like a 70 delta call or something, but you're still overpaying. Because there's still a volatility premium to it. So that's the price you're paying for the leverage. The other thing I caution people with is they tend to somehow or sometimes. Overestimate their edge. And hence over leverage something. Because you can't leverage it doesn't always mean you shouldn't. So. That's probably a bigger problem to be honest. Yeah, and I always think about it. I actually did what like two years ago. I did like a small challenge account. You've seen them around before probably at some point. But essentially, I like I just took $5,000, put it in account and saw what I could do over, you know, a few months. And then I think that's a good reminder of how annoying that is to be honest. Just being so restricted is super difficult. Even if you wanted to trade equities outright. I mean, that is, I think even more difficult. You I made way more money. In that account trading options. Then delta one products because of the leverage. So I can see why people go in that direction. But it lends to the point that you're highlighting, which is. And then you know that you're really good at direction. And we know that in general, people aren't. I mean, I, I run to this occasionally as well. It's like it's pretty easy. Actually, well, OK, nothing's easy. But there are patterns you can trade in options with the day left. So let's just take that as a given. The problem is those SPY options might be worth a dollar. And I might have a 10% edge. Let's say I can get 10% I can make 10 cents on that option even after costs. Great. The problem is if I want to sell a thousand SPY one day options. That's like a, I don't know. Multimillion dollar haircut. You know, it's something like I don't know. Three three point eight four million dollars or something. That's a tiny return on that amount of margin. So that's a big yeah, everyone faces that. I mean, I was very happy that I found something I could make 10% 10 cents on every day. Then I realized that the actual return on the capital was probably not worth it. I only found that out when I got a call from the clearing bank to ask what the hell I was doing. So hold on. I'm actually really curious about that. Why did they call you? I mean, I just went. Typically, I just went massively over my risk limits without knowing I got over my risk limits. My risk wasn't really a problem, but my margin was a problem. And they only really have a hard limit on that overnight. So typically the, the. I don't know about this. The limits I have are on the software side and a thousand options isn't particularly big. Okay. But a thousand SPY options, because it's a $400 stock. That is particularly big in a margin sense. Okay. So that was, I was like, oh, that was surprising. I mean, I should have thought of that earlier, but it just didn't seem like a big deal. Yeah. Yeah. So I've had you here for about an hour. And as always, I really respect your time. But I do want to ask you one final question, which is. I was reading a few articles that I find really interesting where there was a lot of retail traders that started in 2020 during COVID all at home, tons of stimulus, yada, yada, yada. And we're starting to see retail traders bowing out, which falls in line with most of the studies I've read so far at least at about five years is the major threshold for retail traders specifically day traders to either make it a break it. For the people that are on the fence. I was looking at this and saying, okay, you know, I've been at this for two years, not really profitable. If you were in their shoes, what would you be doing going forward, not necessarily because it's 2023, but just going forward as there are two years into this, you know, into the trading tenure. You mean, what would I be doing as I'm giving them advice whether they should keep going or what they should specifically be trying to learn. I would go with the latter, but less on like your advice for them and more your advice for yourself, like if you were in that that paradigm. I mean, that's difficult to know because honestly, when I was two years in the markets were in such a different situation in a different shape. I mean, we were talking about, you know, barrel linch and still charge people 20 bucks to do a futures contract kind of thing. It was it was a different world. I think the big thing to get over is to work out the things you actually have a chance of predicting that might make money. So stop trying to think these deep and complicated thoughts about how the war in Ukraine is going to affect potato futures or something. That's a very appealing game to play, right? It's like when you think you can bet on football because you played football in high school. And you think you know about football. I bet you build ball check couldn't prefer professionally bet on football. Because what he knows isn't the important thing for beating the spread. He knows more about it. Sure. That's almost completely baked in. So you've got to look for other stuff. So don't try and do the fundamental things like that. Look for situations where markets might be slightly out of line for a reason you can identify. You know, because there's a, I don't know, co-compepsy. You tend to move together and there's a massive supply and balance because someone's dumping a lot of coke. So the spread gets out of whack. So you do that spread tree. That kind of thing. Look for situations where there is a definite reason you can identify for a small discrepancy like that. So actually honestly, if I was starting right now when I was coming in from a retail angle, I'd probably do pairs trading. Because that is that situation where you've got an identifiable thing. You can hold these things for weeks. So your transaction costs won't kill you. That's the other thing. Don't try to be a day trader. That's what they all do though. Your transaction costs are just way too big. Look, I get it as well. Right. It's the same thing. You, you think you've got an edge. So you want to make a thousand bets a day. All you're going to do is rack up transaction costs. It's an incredibly difficult thing to do. I would say be a pairs trader. Look for trades that are going to take you two or three weeks. Right. And don't look for things that are a lot. Don't worry too much about whether coke has this business and Pepsi doesn't or whatever. I would do it mathematically. Try not to have opinions. And would you use options or would you use Delta one products? You can do pairs trading through options, you know, straddle versus straddle. But it's a lot more complicated because you've got exposure to applied vol and realized vol and correlation. Just a way more complicated thing. I'd probably use Delta one. Most of the stuff you need to learn about options is the mechanics of options. You will really benefit as an options trader if you know how to trade all this other stuff as well. And there's actually there's another good book one of the very few good books out there. A book called pairs trading. By some Indian person whose name I can't remember I think it starts with a V. And you know people will take issue with it if you if you put out in Twitter for example. Is this a good book? You'll get 100,000 people say it's a terrible book for some reason because they did something and it was wrong. But I think it's a good book. There's a lot of stuff in there that'll help you and set you in the right direction. There's no money but. The the book for anybody wondering I'll throw a link to it, but it's called pairs trading quantitative methods in analysis. I would try to say the name but did a mercy or something? It's Ganna pathy. Okay. Yeah. It's a good book. I've tried to find. I'm trying to email and will contact them I've never managed to actually plagiarized them accidentally in my first edition of my book. Because I've written it down in some notes and I hadn't written down that I've taken it from his book so I'd forgotten. I apologize for that in the second edition. I try to reference people. I don't try and plagiarize. But you know sometimes. And then I'm like I'll be telling you that I'm not going to get it wrong. Yes, I'm not going to get it wrong. I'm not going to get it wrong. I'm not doing that. This was just an idea that existed. This was more than that. This was basically spread out of his book. Oh, good. It was only half a page. And I think I wrote it better and I did apologize later when I realized. If he's listening, I apologize again. It was a homage. Well, you and as always, seriously, I love chatting with you. I love picking your brain on a lot of this stuff. So thank you for taking the time to hang out, talk a little bit with us. I think an interesting thing going forward, there was a handful of questions that people ask specifically as it pertained to your approach to retail trading. And I think that there's bits of that, you know, in your books, I think people can identify a lot of it, but I thought that could be a cool follow on session to do in the future and really kind of like nuts to bolts walk through some of that stuff. Because I think like you're talking about one of the the fights I'm fighting here is retail traders do what retail traders do. They typically look at things that are just straight in front of their face, forgetting the future dated aspects to things even like expectancy. It's hilarious to me like how unknown that is compared to something like probability profit. You throw a rock, you hit somebody that knows about probability profit, but has never heard of the idea of expectancy. You know, it's like those kinds of things. So I think it would be really cool if you're willing at least at some point in the future to do kind of like a concerted session specifically on like retail trading concepts. I think that could be really fun, but regardless, you know, as always, it's a pleasure chatting with you. So thank you for hanging out for a bit. No problem, thanks sir. Talking again. Well, we'll catch you again soon. I'll let you know what what car I end up with and then we'll see what your opinion is of it. No, just don't get an orange one. That's literally the color I probably will get. I had to figure out a way to disappoint you. So I think I snuck it in there right at the end. Don't worry, I'm sure you can disappoint me in lots of ways. I'm positive. Take care. What's
