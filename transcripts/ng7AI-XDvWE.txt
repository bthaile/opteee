 you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you I said before, and yes, perfect, my And if you couldn't tell, I actually owe you all an apology because for the first two options trading, basic series or episodes that we did, I totally forgot that I started doing this random thing with how I present when we're doing the episode, which is typically a post the day of just to remind everybody. And normally it's like, if blank can do blank, then you can learn options. And we just got back at it today. So that's actually two big wins for Eric because I had two great popular culture references for today so far. For those that don't know, I don't know shit about pop culture. That's why it's topical. So Lauren, back to you, I noticed you didn't respond yet. Why did you do it again? So you reiterated sell to close. Why is that? There's a specific reason I can tell you exactly why and it's not because you're dumb, you're not. It's not because you're not paying attention because I know you are. It is something to do with the way that you automatically are framing these things in your mind. And it's super common. What you're doing is thinking of the trade or your treat, you're thinking of the transactions from your standard perspective. And your standard perspective is buying options because I assume you don't sell options very much based on that response. Exactly. So Lauren says because that's what I do the most. That's exactly correct. Good. Nothing serious to take away from that. But the exercise that I just did there with her is something you all should be able to do with yourself, which is positive attribution. It's actually getting to the root of why something is happening and being aware of it. That's how we can make adjustments going forward is through awareness. So nice job, Lauren. All right. Next one. What is the most common method to settle an option? Super easy. We went over this. There's a statistic from OIC. I'm actually pretty sure I shared it. Yeah. This is just a straightforward question. It's the most common method to settle an option. And it's not what you hear a lot of. Close. That's correct. Travel or stool is correct. I forgot we got to get our fake internet points go in my bad. Wait, where are the rest of my fucking emojis? Hold on. This is terrible. Oh, there they are. All right. We got our fake internet points. Normally I use a little trophy. Let's see if we can find something that's. I like the trophy. Is there a lot of voted love that one. So travel or so gets plus one fake internet point. Congratulations. And the answer is the majority are closed. The reason why that's super important is because most of the people on Reddit in theta gang would lead you to believe that most options expire worthless. And they use that as a rationale for selling options. Most of them expire worthless. You sell the options. Most of them expire worthless. That is logical. The problem is is it's wrong. It's just not true. That's an issue. So the reason why I'm emphasizing quiz question number two is because this is tied to a really common mental approach and validation for way methodology for trading. That's just purely inaccurate. It's just wrong. So most options do not expire worthless. So that does not bolster the position of selling options as some sort of secret edge that somehow everybody knows about, but it's still a massive edge. So last question here. What are the two biggest differences between buying and selling options? There's more than two technically, but there's two massive differences. The most important ones is far as I'm concerned. So let's see if you guys can guess what those are. It's something we talk about a lot when we're building trades. Premium call capital ups is premium. That's not it. Why not says credit debit? That's not it either. It's think of the implications of that. Travel Ursula says debit and credit again. That's okay. Oh, here we go. Okay. Reese has part of it. Pingo. Elizabeth has the full answer. So at Elizabeth, you get plus one fake internet point. And since somebody made fun of my goat, which is a little, it's saddening to me because I really like the goat. I'm a let this is a point for Elizabeth, but it's also a slight to be clear against Lauren, which is stopped at bullshit, respect the goat. So Elizabeth gets plus one fake internet point. That's exactly correct. The most important differential between buying and selling options unequivocally is not the fact that there's credits and debits. That is a big difference to be clear that you know, I already said that it's, there's multiple differences, but the biggest ones by far have everything to do with this risk reward graph. This is the zero line. So if we buy a call, it's going to look like this. And if we sell a put, it's going to look like this. Now easy does it. I know everybody's going to start reading into the to the symbol just like they did with fucking Elon Musk. Everybody chill out. These are just two risk reward profiles overlaid with one another. The biggest difference to be aware of here is the risk side of the equation. And the reward side of the equation. This is the biggest difference. Now there's a lot of nuanced differences between them and we went over that in the last session. So we're not going to believe are those points. Well, the reason why you have to be aware of this is because when we get into a further session, where are we session number nine? We're going to talk about it before we get to number nine. But at session number nine, where we're talking about how to build an options trade, this difference is one of the defining features that's going to naturally back you into different decisions. Great. Okay. So we ever quiz done. Let's talk real quick about what you saw in the last session. You saw the differences between buying and selling from a holistic perspective. We looked at everything from how to open the trades, how to close the trades, how to settle the trades, the risk profiles for the trades, understanding when we might want to buy, when we might want to sell all of that was in the last session. This is going to continue to just grow so that you have a quick recap of what we spoke about last time. Now let's talk about the agenda for today. We are getting into option pricing, explain. So we're at 17 minutes, 10 seconds. I'm updating our timestamps. And this is what we're going to talk about today. We're going to talk about the components of an options contract. We're going to talk about what premium is. You already know what premium is because we talked about that before. We're going to talk about it again. We're going to talk about pricing models in pricing model inputs. We're going to talk about bit-ask spreads. We're going to talk about in order book and layering. And then we're going to talk quickly about some of the actual implications of this stuff through the Greeks. So your TLOs, terminal learning objectives. This is a really obnoxious military term whenever you do, well, especially for the Marine Corps, I don't know what other services call it. Whenever you take a military course, you have TLOs and ELOs. TLOs, terminal learning objectives are what you should know at the end of the session. This is what you should know at the end of the session. ELOs are enabling learning objectives. Those are the things we're going to learn along the way, essentially these things. So this is what you're going to walk away from the session with today, as well as an understanding of these common questions and misconceptions. The questions you see here are, first one, this is from a comment on the post, I think. This one is, how do you quickly identify mispriced options? Great question. Next one. This is from Reddit, which is how do you use Black Sholes, Merton model to price options. Next one after that is using option pricing models as a retail trader. Are they relevant? That's also from Reddit. And then the last one was a DM to me on Reddit, which is which option pricing model is most optimal. So we're going to answer all of those by the end of this. Okay. Take a quick pause before we actually get kicked off with the material and see from you all in the chat right now. If there are any other specific questions that you have, the way that this question list works is by the end of the session, you should have an answer to whatever the question is that you have. That's why I'm tracking them here. This is why they're literally for everybody to see. So at the end of the session, you will literally be able to answer everything that we input over here. If there's anything else that you want to add, if there's anything related to our option pricing that you want to get an answer on, now's the time to bring it up. If not, and these questions are good, we can continue on. All right. Great. So let's get started. We are going to grab our handy, dandy notebook and no unlike the dude from Blues Clues. I'm not what, what, what, what drugs did he end up doing? Can he get kicked off the show for doing like a bunch of drugs? I can't remember what the drugs were. But shout out to him. We're not going to go that route. We're going to grab our handy dandy notebook, but and grab the notebook, believe that the drugs put those down. Notebook, no drugs, to be clear what we're doing here. Sorry to let everybody down. So the first thing. This of an options premium. Now I realize this actually is mis labeled. This should be components of an options premium. And the way that I typically would write this as inputs to. The reason why I differentiate that way just for your context is the details of an options contract are the standard things that we quote when we're talking about an option, right? We talk about what the underlying symbol is, what the days expiration are, what the strike price is premium, the type, whether it's a caller put that kind of thing. This is what we typically refer to when we're citing an options contract. This is not the same as the primary inputs into a pricing model, which are these elements here. So the first input into a pricing model is the underlying price. Why is this an input? Simple. Because if I'm dealing with an option that's tied to an underlying that's worth $5, it's going to have a completely different series of values than an option that's $500. Let's take a look at this for a practical example together. We're going to notice I'm going to do a lot of these where I'm going to take us into an options chain together so that you can see with me. So let's start with Cisco. This is great because this is a $60 stock. It's cheap. Let's go to 28 days to expiration. Let's go to the at the monies, the 50 delta right now, which is 62 and a half. Let's see what these are worth. $1.73 by $1.90. You don't have to know what that stuff means just yet. That's just the price for the 62 and a half call. That's 28 days to expiration. Let's go to meta. I'm pretty sure meta is pretty expensive now in it. Yeah, meta six, six, 47. Let's take a look at the at the money, the six, 50s, the 650 call in the same expiration cycle is 29, 85 and 30, 10. What do you notice? Way more expensive. So the first input that's relevant to us is the underlying itself and it's because the underlying itself will have different values that are important to us. The next one is the type of option that we're looking at. Is it a call or is it a put? The reason why that matters is because the pricing relative to both of those is going to be slightly different, which we'll explain later. We also care if it is a US or American style option or European style option. The reason why this matters is because early exercise applies here does not apply here. That impacts our pricing models. Early exercise is a risk. So this one doesn't have a risk that this one does. That's why that matters. The strike price, which all of you are familiar with, but when we pop open an option chain, that's literally just the price that the contract is tied to. That's essentially if you're talking about a house, the contract price for the house is whatever the buyer and seller agree that the house is worth and they're going to transact at. That's what this is. That's what the strike price is. Next up, we have days to expiration. The reason why this is an input is because an option is a contract between two people. The duration of the contract matters a lot. Imagine if you were going to go to an insurance provider for a car and let's say that you were going to get a car and you needed to have automobile insurance in order to be able to drive it around, but you only needed insurance for two days. Just work with the example. I know it doesn't work like that, but work with the example here. Do you think that the insurance that you would pay for two days is more expensive or less expensive than insurance that would last a year? Kind of straightforward. I imagine you probably know the answer. But what's more expensive, the two day insurance or the one year insurance? And I'm not talking on a relative basis. I'm talking at a gross dollar amount. Reese is on it one year. Pretty simple. Why? Because it's a longer contract. That's exactly why. So days to expiration is important because the length of the contract will impact the price associated with it. The current risk-free rate, the reason why the current risk-free rate isn't input to models is because it tells us what price we need to have integrated into the pricing model where a participant could go get that risk-free rate somewhere else. So there needs to be a reason for us to trade an options contract which has additional risk. If you don't integrate the risk-free rate, and let's say that the pricing is completely off where you could get the risk-free rate somewhere else for free and then an option happened to be cheaper on a relative basis, who wouldn't go for the risk-free rate? I would. It's risk-free. So the risk-free rate is a really important input into the model. The next one is any dividend yield to the underlying. The reason why yield is so important is because it impacts the stock price movement, volatility. It impacts the propensity for early assignment risk. So the yield really is important from two different perspectives. A call has early assignment risk if you're short of call. A short put doesn't have early assignment risk from a sales side perspective. However, the short put has the risk on the market dropping after the dividend. So both calls and puts are impacted by the dividend yield. And then there's the last one that is in gold. Volatility. The reason why volatility is in gold. Is because when we look at a pricing model, all of these things are known. Every single one of these details are known definitively. It's not I'm taking a guess. I know them definitively. I can look at the underlying and see what the price is. The price for meta right now is 647.49. I can see the price right now. The type of option I can see if I'm talking about calls or puts. I can see it right now. If we look at the type of contract that it is US American versus European, you can see those pretty simply by looking up the contracts. The strike price we already talked about. You can see that right in the middle there. There's your strike price. I can see all of these things right now. Days to expiration. That's the length of the contract. If I move this over, I can see the days to expiration. The risk-free rate, you can look that up on any sort of platform that shows you bond prices or the sofa rate or the library, depending on the duration of the contract that you're looking at. The dividend yield. This is also a known. We can see this up here. The point is all of these are known right from the jump. The only one that we don't know is this to be technically correct is implied volatility. The reason why implied volatility is not known is why. Why is this one input into the pricing model not known? Any guesses? Why is implied volatility not known? We know everything else here. Why not known? Talk to me. Talk to me, Goose. Can't predict future price. You can predict, but your point is well made. Implied volatility deals with the future, which is unknown. We can predict it. We can come up with estimates based on where we think it's going to go. We actually can predict pretty well, but that part aside to why not specific point, you can't predict what meta is going to be next Wednesday. We can have ideas, but we can't predict it. That's unknowable until next Wednesday. We can come up with an expected range, but remember, implied volatility is just an expectation of price movement. That's all it is. We do not know the implied volatility element of a pricing model. This very, very important point as we go through the rest of the session together. I will take a pause there. Where's my other little sheet, my little croissant? Input to an options premium. Do you feel comfortable with the inputs to an option price based on what we just talked about? The input to an option price. I'm just updating our timestamps. N54 is good. Capital Apes says the standard deviation play a factor. That's what implied volatility is tracking. The standard deviation. It's looking for deviation of future price. This says, so how do we arrive at implied volatility? Which is a great question. We're going to talk about that more in a minute. Good so far, it seems. Okay, cool. Don't worry, Reese. We will get, we will touch on that when we get into the pricing model input specifically. To pivot now over to premium. Premium, fortunately, is really, really simple. Premium is broken down into two buckets. So let's do a little bit of drawing together. We got to, you know, sometimes you, like, you just got to draw. You just got to express yourself. The funniest thing about all this drawing is I really actually hate drawing. I don't like it at all. So, this is always entertaining to me. But let's talk about the premium of an option, which is Spanish for the price. There are two elements that equal the premium. There's extrinsic and intrinsic. Intrinsic is simply the strikes relationship to price. Price, intrinsic is made of volatility, imply vol and time. So one of the notes here is that, there you go, you can see the fly volatility there. One of the notes here is that implied volatility lives within time. There are two different things you can isolate them. But the more time we have, the more time implied volatility has to be volatility. So implied volatility doesn't exist without time. So what that means is if time is zero, what does that mean? It means that we're talking about a contract and I'm saying zero ad expiration. I'm not saying like a zero DTE that still is the rest of the day. I'm talking ad expiration zero. The reason why you need time for volatility is because we're talking about implied volatility. It's forward looking. If you are at time zero at expiration, there is no more forward looking. The contract is now expired. It's all historic at this point. None of that is forward looking. The contract is gone. So that's why implied volatility lives within time. As soon as time is zero, implied volatility is gone for that contract. It needs time. Now, the relationship between strike and stock is relative to whether or not we're talking about a call or put. So let's take a quick look at these. I actually think it might be in this. Yeah, here. So we can take a look at calls versus puts the type of option. And we can see that this gray, I don't even know what color is that. What color is this? The shaded area. It almost looks purple. I have no idea what color to call that. You're going to have to help me out here. This shaded area represents in the money for calls. This shaded area, everybody says purple. Okay. We'll go purple. Alberto says violet. Alberto is going. Alberto is going real specific, which you guys will have to confirm or deny if this is actually violet. In the money for calls is simply when the stock price is above your strike or puts, it's the inverse. The reason why money matters is because it impacts the probability of the option being in the money, which impacts the overall value of that option. Options that are expected to have intrinsic value are worth more than options without intrinsic value. So super important point. Okay. So now we take a pause with respect to premium and see if you have any question. What questions do we have on premium of options? Do you understand how it's broken down into intrinsic and extrinsic value and the differences between intrinsic and extrinsic value? Do we feel good about this? Lauren says it's plum. I think plum is, let's see. I don't know. I feel like Lauren's bullshit me right now. Yeah. I think Lauren is playing games. It's not fucking plum. That's straight bullshit. Unbelievably, Lauren, I thought that we actually had a decent relationship built on trust and respect and come to find out you straight up fucking lied to me about the color. Unbelievably. Okay. So now we have a pretty good understanding of premium. What premium is now we update our timestamps. Now we're going to talk about pricing models. So pricing models as we go back to this, we already know and we belabor the point. All of this stuff is known except this. So then the question becomes how do we get this? Where does this come from? I don't know if you guys have seen, I was about to make a joke. I feel like literally nobody would have gotten. If you would have gotten this joke, let me know. But I was, I was going to say, where does this come from? And then the joke was going to be, but where do I come from? And then the response to that is get a journal low again. If you haven't seen those clips, which I imagine is the majority of people, you won't get that joke at all. But if you do, you'll actually probably get a chuckle out of that. But where does this come from? Let's take a look. Good old volatility. So I actually have a video that talks about volatility in detail. So I am going to share that video with you here. Right there. So volatility, we don't need to add it here. Volatility is the only input that we're missing. So that video goes through volatility in depth. The way that we price an option effectively is through pricing volatility. There are a lot of different kinds of volatility. And if you'll notice back on this, we literally have an entire session about volatility by itself. That's how important it is as an input to this entire thing that we do as options traders. One of the things you are doing, whether you realize it or not, every single time you are trading an option is you are expressing an opinion on volatility, whether you mean to or not you are. So you have to understand that because it changes the way that we frame and make decisions on position sizes, types of positions, the way we structure our trades, which we'll get into in a future session. So here we have forecast volatility. Forecast volatility is how we determine expected volatility. And there are all different kinds of tools people use. The entire world of forecast volatility is where you see all of the advanced institutions, market makers. That's where they're all playing. They're all trying to be the best at figuring out what volatility should be priced at. So the way that that works are people using all kinds of pricing models. And it's not pricing models simple as black, sholes, merton. We use black sholes, merton model as a way to understand and simplify options. However, the world of pricing the volatility input itself is exceedingly complex. And that's where you will come across different models like garsh e garsh, ej garsh, including jump diffusion. The cliff notes version of forecast volatility is from a retail trading perspective, you're not, you're not going to use it. You're not going to forecast volatility. The reason why you're not going to forecast volatility more often than not, you could do it as a scholastic exercise, right, just to learn and to try it. You're not going to price fall better than all of these other entities that are then expressing these opinions in the market. So when we're trying to figure out the price of an option, this, this is the biggest and most important input that exists. If an implied volatility calculation is mispriced, it can lead to significant opportunity for other traders to capitalize on that misprice ball. The way that that can work from a theoretical perspective to give you an overview of what the fuck this means that I'm saying. Let's say that we're not retail traders. Let's say that we're both institutions. Let's say that we're both high frequency traders. If I'm a market maker and I'm providing these quotes on what I think this option is worth, this quote literally just represents vol. That's what when people are talking about options in a technical perspective, we just refer to them as vals. We talk about the volatility because none of this other ship matters. It's all known. So the only thing we care about is the vals. So we can take a look at something like this and we can determine what the current implied volatility being priced into the option is. Now a lot of platforms do it for you, but that's primarily what we use the Black Sholes Merton model for is it allows us to use the differential equation to pull out the individual inputs and isolate the individual inputs so that we can see what this is. So this 615 put right now is being priced at 41.75 vol. Now going back to the example, you and I are both institutions. We're both high frequency trading firms. And we see this being priced at 41.75 vol. According to our model, which they're competing with one another, according to our model, which we've spent tons of time in R&D. We literally have a fucking army of PhDs that man the model and update it. They come in and they say, oh, wow, that 4175 is way off. That's super high compared to what our model says. So then what do we do? We come in and we sell this volatility. That's the cool part about consensus driven markets because there are so many really smart entities interacting here. You're going to get a pretty good example of what volatility is priced at because as soon as that one hypergoose trading firm comes in and says that this is priced too high and they start selling it, then there's going to be others that will probably arrive at a similar conclusion and also sell it. There's going to be a bunch of people selling it that's going to drive the price down. Now there's a really good chance that one, the market maker would catch on really, really fast. But two, from a retail trading perspective, you're not involved in this game. This is shit that's happening way outside your purview, especially as a beginner. As an intermediate to advanced trader, you can absolutely, I've tried forecasting volatility just at a curiosity and sometimes it's right. But it rarely is anything worth the effort of trying to maintain a forecast model that actually would have enough edge priced into it to be able to just isolate vol like that and then compete on this space. Because the mispricings that we're talking about now are dramatized just to make it easier to understand. The mispricings that they might be looking for on the market, it's not even out to two decimal points. It could be out to six decimal points and they would put the trade on at such scale and they can also more directly isolate volatility through hedging activities because they have lower transaction costs that they can actually isolate this thing and put it on scale to take advantage of much, much smaller price discrepancies that we just don't have access to. So all of these different pricing models that you see floating around binomial trees, black sholes, merton, these are theoretical pricing models. They're designed to help us understand options and they're used as simplifying functions. In no way are these the way that options are actually being priced in the context of volatility? Because once we price volatility, we can use something like black sholes, merton, because we can adjust for some of the simplifying assumptions it makes with respect to the stock distribution and we can use log normal. We can change those small inputs to make it pretty accurate but pretty fast. The thing about getting really accurate with stuff like this is that these kinds of pricing models are close enough provided that the implied volatility calculation is very accurate. So to use more advanced pricing models typically introduces latency. Pricing models use simplifying functions so that they're one consumable but two so that not consumable to be clear for you and I they don't give a fuck about you and I. It's so that when they're programming them they're fast and this is typically good enough. So the way to think about pricing is far as a retail trader. Options are priced by institutions. They're priced by institutions that are playing these games that I'm outlining for you here. The pricing that we participate in is whether or not we think the current price is fine for whatever we're trading. But to answer our first question from this is how do you quickly identify mispriced options? You fucking don't. As a retail trader you absolutely do not. You have no fucking idea and it's because this game is happening at a level that you don't even see. So the game of identifying mispriced options it's not for you. There's going to be other entities that are much smarter, faster, well equipped to do that actual thing. You will not know if it's priced correctly or not because think of what this represents. If you are able to identify a mispriced option as a retail trader that means every other active market participant missed it and didn't do anything about it. Probably not going to happen. So this one is super simple. You don't quickly identify it nor do you typically identify it much at all. You've just taken opinion on what volatility might be or what you think volatility might be. But to go as far as calling something mispriced way off. The other thing to keep in mind is that there's a really important relationship between puts and calls called put call parity. If put call parity is violated in any way, there are high frequency trading algorithms that are hunting for that exact scenario. And the reason why they're hunting for that scenario is because there's an arbitrage opportunity or there's different kind of positions that can be put on to even have a risk-free trade potentially. So there's an arbitrage opportunity. So that's again going to happen so fast you literally won't even see it. So there are structures that maintain the relationship between puts and calls from an efficient market perspective. And then when it comes to the pricing of options, we as retail traders, we simply go through and we accept whatever the market is pricing the Volsad. So right now for meta pricing the 620s at 41.66, I take that as accurate. I don't have a better estimate than Vol on that. And me running anything through a Black Sholes Merton model doesn't fucking matter unless I have a different volatility input. So then the question is where do you get your volatility from? We as retail traders, we derive it from the market. We take that's why it's called implied Vol. We're implying it from the market. But the input that's actually used in pricing models is called forecast Vol. That's when we decide what volatility should be and what we're going to price volatility act. Okay. Big, big section. So I'm going to take a pause there. And I want to see how we feel about pricing models and pricing model inputs. If we have questions, we can do that now. I'm just updating our timestamps quick. Okay. Let's see. Any questions on what we just talked about? Any questions about pricing models, pricing model inputs, anything like that. Why not says I'll get full off of the market crumbs? That's the thing is just because volatility is priced correctly or accurately, that's not the way that we're making our money. The way to think about market pricing of options is if options were mispriced or priced too rich or too cheap. If that were the case, then there's the ability to capitalize and to monetize that. And that's where you hear of things like variance risk premiums because we know an indices that volatility tends to be priced rich. That's for a bunch of different reasons. And there's literally a known phenomenon around that that people can monetize. So that's one way to make money. That's one profit mechanism as you will hear me refer to it as. But just because there's not a bunch of mispricing and options for us to go around and try to trade all the time, there's a bunch of other ways we can make money and options. That's just not our game. Recess in retrospect, can we say an option was mispriced? I mean, yeah, but it doesn't really mean anything. So the way that we would infer that an option was mispriced is if we price volatility and then something moves either too far within that volatility band or too far outside of that volatility band. But looking at it in retrospect doesn't really matter that much from an IV perspective. But you can. I think that's an okay to wait a phrase it. But say it says, what's the difference between IVR and IVX? The fuck is IVX? Where's that from? I don't know that one. Any. Re says if everything was priced perfectly, I wouldn't have any 100% winners. That's incorrect. Again, you're focusing on the wrong thing. Let me explain this because I can tell that this part's confusing people. Okay. We have two scenarios. Give me one second. Looks like I ordered Mel. She really likes salt. So I ordered Mel a bunch of, there's this drink brand called element ELM and T or some shit like that. And they just do like hydration stuff like liquid IV and whatnot. But there's stuff like super, it tastes like drinking fucking salt water. I have no idea how she could possibly like it. But anyway, she was just talking to me about that scenario one. We have a house. Got two windows and then scenario two. We also have a house. This one also has two windows. The 10 that these are the same and that the windows both look good. So house one, this is priced at 100 K house two is priced at 80 K. Let's say that they are the same house one house to the same house in the same neighborhood. They're the same. These are just two alternate universes, different dimensions in dimension two. This was from an estate sale. And this is just being sold on the normal market. And let's say after five years, the house is now worth 500 K. That's because this house wasn't quote unquote mispriced. Doesn't mean you can't still make tons of money. The difference is the margin you make might look a little bit different. So the way to think about options being priced properly doesn't mean that you can't make money. It if you absolutely can make money. It just means that you're not making money from an inaccurate or mispriced basis itself. And again, I'm using an estate sale as the example for the mispricing here. Everything else being the same, you can still make money. It's just priced appropriately. So even though it's priced appropriately at 100,000, if it goes up to 500,000, you make money. The difference here is that if this is mispriced, you might be able to make more money or you might be able to make money in a different way. And it doesn't work well at the real estate example because you can't really arbitrage of this. But in options, you could arbitrage it. So let's pretend that this is an options contract now, which I don't know why I drew that little face. It looks kind of funny. Pretend this is an options contract now. And if this was mispriced for whatever reason, we actually don't want to trade it up to 500,000 anymore because we actually think it's worth 100 K. This is the mispricing as far as we're concerned. So what we want to do is isolate this difference through hedging activities to capture that differential. That's all. So the pricing of an option being priced correctly doesn't mean that you can't make money. And it being reflective of priced correctly or incorrectly, they're just different profit mechanisms, completely different profit mechanisms. So that's the lesson there. Let me pop the door for Thor real quick and we'll be back. So because options are priced correctly, it does not mean that you just get breadcrumbs. It does not mean that you have to be the peasant out in the market. You have to be the peasant out in the market anyways because we're retail. It has nothing to do with the pricing of options. They're completely different things. So the way to think about the pricing of options is that they offer specific elements that can enhance things. They offer a different profit mechanism. But as I mentioned in the beginning, you don't have access to that profit mechanism. It's just the reality of it. Okay, let me get back to the questions. We can spend literally as much time on this section. The rest of these are going to be super fast. And this is the heart and soul of the session. So feel free to throw literally anything you have at the questions. That's exactly what we should be talking about right now because this is the important element. Okay. Reese says so making money comes from the risk assumed because it've gone another way. It doesn't mean it was mispriced. Yeah, that's exactly correct. James says it's super confusing trying to figure out which IV to go by as it's different from different brokers. I don't imagine I don't know. I don't look between brokers that much, but I don't imagine implied volatility is going to be that different between most of them. But if it is, you could always just split the difference between the two assuming that they're not that different. If there's a big difference somehow, I would go to a third broker and then see which of the cluster between two out of three looks most correct to you. And it also depends on what volatility they're providing to you. There's implied volatility, which the implied volatility should not be different. The implied volatility is pulled directly from the option prices that are resting on the market. If they have a theoretical volatility, that's their own volatility calculation. James says IV IV IV X IV is implied volatility IV R is implied volatility rank. Completely different things IV X. I'm really not sure what that is. I'm assuming that might be a newer thing. Let me see. I'm wondering if that's like from T.C. Trade's platform or something. I just I don't use that one. Oh, duh. It's so if I'm understanding what you're talking about correctly, you're talking about the implied volatility index. Is that correct? Yeah. So it's from Tasty. Yeah. So implied volatility index is a slightly different thing. But the way to think about volatility and again, we have a whole session that will go through all of these different things. And if you check out that video that I shared above, it's literally, it literally talks about all this stuff. But implied volatility is a different function. Implied volatility tells us how volatile something is as a percent basis. Implied volatility rank or percentile take the implied volatility and they make it relative to itself. So let's take a look to see if we can find an example and sure we can. But right now meta has a 43% vol and a 73% implied volatility percentile and a 76% implied volatility rank. I almost always use implied volatility percentile because it's much less prone to skew, which implied volatility rank is. The way to think about these two implied volatility percentile and implied volatility rank, they're very similar to one another. They look to take this volatility and make it relative to the underlying, not just a gross amount. So just let's remember these numbers. Implied volatility, 43% and implied volatility percentile at 73%. Let's just click through. Let's see if we can find something else. Great example. I knew it. Instincts right on fleek. Implied volatility and game stop is 78.25. So almost double what you saw in meta, but take a look at the implied volatility percentile. 8%. What's going on here? Why is this the case? There's a distinct reason. So the implied volatility in game stop is much higher. But the implied volatility percentile and rank both are much lower. Why is that the case? What does that tell you? Rointitdy says, did you see my question? I did not. Feel free to dump it back in and we can circle back on it. Rointitdy says market cap. That's not it. That's an okay guess. Re says GME is usually higher implied volatility compared to meta, I think is what you meant. Oh, I see you're talking about the same. Yeah, same same. So what Risa saying is correct. What he's saying is that generally speaking, game stop has higher volatility than what it has right now, even though the volatility in game stop is already double what it is in meta. So that tells you that game stop is more volatile of an underlying. Think of this is another way of viewing beta. If we view beta of the S&P 500, it's typically 1.0. If you look at things that move around more, you'll have beta of 1.3, 1.5, 2, 3, you can have beta that's in excess of it. This is a similar way of looking at that. Rointitdy says do option premiums have more volatility? Buyers and sellers at half in whole dollars like stocks do. Do option premium have more volatility? Buyers and sellers at half in whole dollars like stocks do. I think you're mixing a bunch of things here. So if we look at the number of buyers and sellers which we would refer to as liquidity, then absolutely. I actually talk about that quite a lot. Where if we look at the open interest and if we look at the volume for half strikes compared to whole strikes and even whole strikes compared to whole number, whole strikes, you will build nearly almost always see this. Where the open interest and the volume for those options is way more. So it's way more liquid. One using whole strikes is compared to half strikes. The next factor to that is whole numbers. So it's typically things that end in five's or zeros that will have more open interest than the surrounding options. Great example of that is here. If you take a look at the 20's, there's 2900 of them. If you take a look at the 21's, there's 23 so there's still more of the 20's. Then if we look through all of these, there's like nothing. 35, 166, 10, 137, nothing until we get to this one. That's 3600. What number do you think that is? 25. So normally zeros and fives will have the bulk of volume and open interest. Now your inclusion of implied volatility in that statement is what makes it confusing. Because the implied volatility is a completely separate factor and it has less to do with whether or not it's a half strike or a full strike and it has more to do with if it's closer to or further out of the money. That's the difference here. So the half strike, whole strike, whole number, round number, whatever, where volatility has way more to do with where it is in terms of relationship to the underlying price. So you'll notice that the tails of volatility tend to be priced higher than the at the monies. So if we take a look at this 20 day to expiration, we look at the 28's. These are at the money. The volatility on these is 68. Then if we go super far in the money, the implied volatility here is 261%. Then if I go super far out of the money, it's 150%. Notice how much higher the tails are compared to the at the monies. It's part of option pricing, which has a lot to do with expectation of in the money versus out of the money. Kind of keep it at a simple level. Okay. Next question from Amadeus. If two same price stocks have the same IV and the same underlying price and similar liquidity, will they be priced the same or does their historical volatility and price performance come into play? Historical volatility and price performance comes into play in forecasting volatility. So if we're saying that they have the same implied volatility, we're inherently saying they have the same historical price performance because that's an important factor for forecasting future volatility is what something has done previously. A great way to think about that and put it into into into similar context is think of the weather today and think about what you expect in general, the weather to be tomorrow, probably pretty close to whatever it was today. So volatility very much functions the same volatility clusters and that's when it goes through its transition phases, it tends to hang out for a little while once it hits an extreme and it'll stay there for a little bit called clustering. So you can think of it similar to the weather in that context. So based on your example, Amadeus, by saying that they have the same IV, you are inherently saying that their historical volatility and price performance is the same. So it definitely does come into play. That's how one of the major tools we use to forecast volatility. Rowing to these is maybe I'm asking wrong. I mean, if premium is at 35 cents, are there psychological levels at 50 and $1 and so on? Oh, I see. You mean for the actual premium itself? Not really. That's the pricing of an option in that way is going to be determined by the market maker. So that is much less done or as a factor of like human entries. Now there typically is a slight natural lean versus something like I would prefer to sell something at 40 versus 39, but I would rather sell something at 41 versus 40, right? So it's less so of just trying to be at an even number on the premium. That it's just a matter of what's the better price relative to what you're trying to do. That's relative to the premium itself. Great questions. I'm stoked. It feels like you guys are, feels like you guys are crushing this. So let's talk. This one's easy. Let's talk about that spread. So we're at 45 did ask spread and then we'll also do bit I spread and order books. We don't really have to talk about layering. That's more of a HFT thing. So bit asked spread simply represents the current market offered or an option. That's all. So the bit asked spread are these two numbers. You see the bid here, the ask here, the bid here, the ask here for calls inputs. The bid is the most somebody is willing to pay. Think of the people that do the, but I've got to do have a 40. And then they, the auction people. So the auction people essentially as they do that rambling, which I think I just did a excellent job mirror. And if I do say so myself, they're essentially providing a market. And the person when they raised their little thing, they raised their, they raised their thing. And they have, you know, their, their fancy hats on and shit. And we go through that kind of pricing is the same thing as the market. There is a person that's sitting in a chair that says, I will pay $10 for that item. Then the auctioner will say, well, do I have 12? And then they're going to try to find somebody to pay $12 and so on and so forth. So the bid is the most somebody is willing to pay at this time. The ask is the cheapest somebody is willing to sell. Now the cool part about markets is you typically can get filled between these words of the mid price and things that are liquid, meaning there's a lot of people transacting in there. They will have narrower bid ask spreads. bid ask spreads are super important because they represent your ability to get into and out of something at a fair rate. And we did a focus topic a while ago on how to calculate liquidity bid ask spreads. And before you ask, you already know I have a video on it. So I will share this video that goes in depth on assessing option liquidity bid ask spreads, all of those kinds of things. But the main takeaway is for you to know that there are two prices that you will see. You typically can transact in between these prices. These prices are typically set by market makers. One of the games for market makers is they obviously have to make markets. There's certain requirements for their quote book being turned on or the quote machine being turned on for certain durations of time in certain things. And if they violate those rules, then they can lose some of the benefits that they have as market makers. The reason why that matters is because it impacts them what they might rest on the order book. The reason why it might impact what they rest on the order book is because they still have an entire inventory of stuff. They have tons of positions on already. So they might not want to take a whole bunch more of game stop at either of these on the buy side or sell side if they can avoid it. So they might price them a little less aggressively or they might offer different sizes at that price. So that's why you typically can transact towards the middle is because the fair price is generally towards the middle. Now you can actually use something like the black sholes, merton model to figure out what the price should be because right now this is telling you dollar 92 by 202. What should it be? Well, guess what? You have an implied volatility input right here, which is 6794. So I actually have a tool. I can tell you right now, I just got to grab my thing. I have a tool built in my trade log that does this for me in two different ways. It does it through the black sholes, merton model to give me a theoretical price. And then it also gives me a binomial tree. I have like a couple different versions of the binomial tree, but it gives me the delta of the game, all that stuff. So we can run through an input, the ticker, the underlying price, the expiration, the IV, the yield. If there is one, the current risk rate relative to the duration that you're looking at. And you can figure out specifically what the call should be priced at, what the put should be priced at. That's called the theoretical price. Travel Ursel says, is there an online calculator? I'm sure there is. But the fact of the matter is whatever the price is shown to you as doesn't really matter that much in all honesty. Because regardless of what the theoretical price is, you still, if you want to put the trade on, are going to have to transact at the prices that they're showing you. And the idea generally though is to try to transact towards the middle, if we can. That is much more preferable than trying to transact obviously towards the bid or the offer. We generally can do better than that. So let me take a pause on bid-ass price. I'm going to take a second and see if what Mel wants for dinner. And if you have any questions on this stuff, perfect time, throw it in and we can take a look. Frank says, do you have any tips for setting a stop loss on contracts that have a wide bid-ass spread? I feel hesitant to set one because I'm not maximizing gains. Well, it depends on what the, what the stop loss is for. So that one is a slightly different question. We can save time for the very end for those. I just want to handle stuff right now that's more specific to this. Feel free to bring that back up though at the very end. And we can take a closer look together. But in the meantime, just so that I'm not leaving you hanging, this video goes into that on using stops. Roryntady says, I find they don't fill me off and at the midpoint takes forever to get filled. Yep, that's exactly correct. And it depends on what you're trading. If you're trading something that's less liquid or more volatile, more volatility typically leads to less liquidity, then you will find that exact thing. If you're trading something that's super liquid, you'll almost always transact at the mid. So if you're trading stuff like GameStop, which is notoriously volatile, or if you're trading smaller float stocks, cheaper stocks that have less overall volume, then those tend to have wider bid-ass spreads. The probability of being filled right in the middle is, yeah, not very high, but that's just kind of normal. Cool. So I think we have one more thing on our agenda, which is the order book. The Greeks will get into in a standalone session. I'm actually going to make sure, let me find that really fast. Just make sure that we have the Greeks as its own. We do. So the Greeks will go into more in depth. What I was going to talk about with the Greeks with respect to today is simply that the fact that the Greeks help us understand how things are priced. Like that's pretty much it. It gives us a little context on the pricing of what we're looking at. So, when we buy and sell options, we are basically negotiating with the market maker, not the actual buyer sell. That's correct. The vast majority of instances, the probability of you stumbling across another retail trader that's looking to trade a single lot, five lot, ten lot, like a small position, and being able to line up with them at the right time at the right price and agree on a price is very low. So the market makers in that context, they provide liquidity. And they essentially say, sure, I'll sell this to you at this price, whatever that price is. They'll take the inventory on. They'll hold it until they have the ability to offload it to somebody else that wants the other side of the trade. That's what they're trying to do. But they in the process through providing liquidity is they will take on inventory. Which is actually a great segue into a quick look at the actual order book. And the order book, there's different things level two data. Again, this is the order book here for the underlying. And then you can look at the actual order book for individual options if you're so inclined that we could take a look at the 28s here. And you can see what the current sizes are, what the current bids and offers are at those sizes. So this lets you take peak at what's what this specific option, for example, is being traded and offered at. So the order books let you see what's in there and how much depth there is, there's an entire world around trying to use the order book to make trading decisions, which can be done, but it's a little bit difficult. The reason why it's a little bit difficult is because there's a lot of games that are played in the order book. So I don't want to spend too much time on that just because it's not really that applicable to most people. But most traders at some point will come across somebody or some entity that says like, yo, I can show you how to trade the order book or something. There's like a bunch of edge that you can extract out of here. And the summary of that is, no, that's not what's happening. There's not a ton of edge that you're going to extract out of the order book. I mean, that's just the reality. So you can look at it. You can use it for context. You can use it for intraday trading decisions. All of that is fine. All of that is possible. All of that is applicable. But it's not like this, this giant source of edge, you know, being able to view the order. Oh boy, there was a solo, Richie scratch on the door. Nuts. All right. All right, let's update this. We're at 122. 20, 30. Q and A. We'll talk about anything now. Anything that you want to hit, anything that you're curious about, anything that we didn't fully cover, we can talk about now. Oh, Rointit, he says, is order book the same as the tape? No. The tape is showing you what trades have occurred. So the tape is something over here, time and sales. And the tape really refers to a much older thing, which is like the things that are sliding on the screen. Well, when you're on the pits, like on the floor, they have these screens that show transactions that are happening. So it used to be like a physical tape, but the tape are transactions that have occurred. So the equivalent of that would be TNS time and sales. The order book are things that have not happened yet. The order book are things that are resting. So slightly different. Darkmarks says, what a type account do you recommend for a beginner options trader in regards to taxes liquidity as a maybe brokerage account until things get to a certain predefined number than adjust, then adjust to what? What you mean, Willis? And let me pop the door for Thor. Here he is. He's ready. I told him that he has to answer some questions. So where were you last night? Nothing. Very, very suspect. Very suspect. Why won't you say where you were last night? But it doesn't make sense. What's your alibi? Unsure what his alibi is. You guys will have to let me know if it's legit or not, but it seems, it seems, you see like he can't even look straight. So I just don't know about this. I'm trying to see dark marks. Darkmark says adjust as an start and account that may have more fees, but better tax breaks, IRAs and stuff. Kind of different, right? Like your IRA versus a standard brokerage account shouldn't have more fees. So I would call those different, but the simple answer to that question is literally just about everybody should absolutely, whoa, Jesus. I'm trying to turn that down. It's like nuking my eyes. Just about everybody should have a retirement account and having a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA typically makes sense. Roth IRA, you will get priced out at some point. It will mean that your income means that you don't get a deduction from contributing your Roth IRA money, which is not the end of the world. But there are other ways you can contribute to the IRA through what we call a back door contribution. Sounds illegal. It's not completely fine. But it's essentially when you input money into an IRA, which again, once you're at a certain income level, it's not tax deductible. You get no tax break from it. But then you can put that as a larger dollar amount into a Roth IRA and trade that. So to do, GC says 7K, I think. Maybe you're talking about the maximum limits to contribute. I'm talking about your income level and your ability to contribute. What ends up happening is when you make too much money, it's not even that much money. Once you get over a certain amount of money as your income, they literally won't let you contribute, which is honestly also super annoying to be clear, because it's like if you want people to retire, why the fuck are you penalizing people that save well? But I digress. So let's take a look at Roth IRA income limit. Here. So you can see in 2024, the Roth IRA income limits are 146 for single filers or 230 for married filing jointly. So what that means is if you make over this amount of money, you can't contribute to one directly. And there's no tax benefit to doing so. And then let's take a look at just regular IRA. Yes, it looks the same. So if you're 230 or less, you get a deduction of up to 7K. And then as soon as you're over 240, there's no deduction. So essentially the money you put into an IRA from your income is taxed nominally, but then you can do a conversion from traditional into Roth. So slightly different. Dark Mark says, I guess I'm asking, can we trade options in certain retirement accounts the same way you can in a brokerage account? Definitely. Yeah, you absolutely can. I trade my IRA. I also traded a 401k that I had from when I was working at Deloitte and stuff. So yeah, you definitely can. It's some of it will depend on the IRA is easy. It will depend on where you open it. There are typically slightly different rules that they apply. So that means that like you can't trade naked strategy. So you have to keep your clothes on, which is fucking lame. The other one is for your 401k's, you can trade those as well depending on who your provider is and like what they're all about. I also realize I have one like this, which is pretty like me, dad center in the middle, middle and big. Cool. I figured this is decent for Q&A. EHOD says some 401k will not allow you to trade options. Yeah, that sounds right. It'll be based on whatever the plan is. Mateus says, how did your position in any go today after sharp rise? It had today. N-E-E for N-E-E, two different tickers. We have N-E key, which I still have a position in. And then N-E-E, which looks like the streaming thing. Hold on a second. I don't know if I'm still on. There it goes. Mateus says N-E-E. I don't think I have anything in any, any more. Yeah, I don't have anything in that. I have N-E, but not N-E-E. So I have nothing that did anything. Yeah, GCA says, any just had earnings, which it definitely did. We were looking at this from an earnings play perspective. Is that like super blurry for you guys? Oh, no, that looks like N-B-M. N-B-M. Trevor Ursul says, can we talk about stock consolidation? What it is, what it looks like? Yeah, for sure. Absolutely. So, thank you for bringing this up again during a stream. I remember, if I'm not mistaken, this is something that you brought up in the discord somewhere. I don't remember where, but I remember seeing this before. So let's talk about that one really quick, because it's super easy. So the way to think about consolidations is that consolidations are just a form of price action. That's it. Now, I can tell that you're incorrectly assigning consolidation to breakout. There's a relationship between them, but it's not an inherent relationship. A breakout is a very specific profit mechanism that has very specific signals that has very specific behaviors underlying conditions. There is a relationship between consolidations and breakouts, but it's not consolidations and breakouts automatically are tied together. There's more to the equation than that. Let's talk about consolidation. And really, anything else related to, actually, sorry, one sec. I just want to update the stuff that we've talked about in the Q&A and my little log. We talked about retirement accounts. I have to get better at updating this thing. We talked about, I think that's the main thing. Yeah, okay, cool. So we talked about that. And then we now are talking about consolidation. So for consolidation, it's really simple. It's relative to the timeframe, just about everything that we've looked at so far when we're trading options or analyzing and underlying, it's highly relative to the timeframe. So if I zoom this out to a three year daily, I can find periods where the stock was consolidating. Consolidation is just a generally sideways range bound price action. So a consolidation would be something like this here. So this range from here to here. This area is consolidation. This one, an underlying is bouncing between a range. And generally it will be flat. Now the caveat is it's highly, highly relative to the timeframe you're looking at. So if we switch this to a five minute daily, this is a consolidation on a five minute timeframe, this much smaller range right here. And then this is a breakdown out of the consolidation. And then this is a rally back up into another consolidation, which is a consolidating in between this level, so on and so forth. So the way to think about consolidation is just sideways trending price action. It tends to be when we're accumulating people that are transacting at a specific level, keeping it within a range. But it's highly relative to the timeframe. You can have things like this that on a five minute, on a five day, 15 minute chart is consolidating. But then if we zoom this out to a 30 day, we can see that it was actually moving in that timeframe was going up. But then if we zoom out further from a 30 day timeframe, this is not consolidating, it's going down. This is consolidation here. But then it's going down. So if I'm looking at a 30 day, four hour chart, and then I go out to a six month, well, it's not really consolidating much, it's still going down. So it's relative to the timeframe. But consolidation simply is generally sideways price action. Now, when it comes to breakouts, that's a whole other bag. Breakouts have a lot to do with underlying conditions, meaning specific earnings criteria that have been met, specific relationship to prior earnings, specific fundamental conditions that set something up that when it does break out of a consolidation phase, it tends to be a stronger move, kind of like what we saw here. This was consolidating. It did try to break out. This is a false breakout because the consolidation area really is from here to here. So I tried to pop out here, didn't work, consolidated, consolidated, consolidated, try to break out to the upside, then got shot down, broke out to the downside, false break out to the downside, then it finally broke out to the upside through here. So the conditions though that lead to the subsequent breakout is a very specific profit mechanism, pretty, pretty different. All right, gang, I got me a 90 minutes in. It's about time for me to go grab my dinner, sit in here. If you guys have anything else, feel free to hit me up in the discord. Happy to catch up. Tomorrow, we have the GME stream. On day, we have the market prep, probably for the pro members, and then we'll keep on keeping on from there. So your homework almost forgot your homework for the session today about option pricing model is to build your own black sholes, merton pricing model in Excel. If you have no idea how to do that, use chat, GPT. It can tell you exactly how to do that. It's very, very simple. Black sholes, merton model, it sounds more overwhelming than it is, which is why that is your homework. So for those that are doing the homework, you can post it in the discord. There's a section in the learning lab. There's a thread that is the beginner workshop here. And this is exactly where I'll grab the link to it. I'll tag everybody in the discord really quick. Everyone, oops. Here you can post your homework from the not all our options trading basics. But just tagged everybody there. So that you can drop your homework in there for any review from people. GCA says, what do we call, I'll type it in here. So homework. Build your own black sholes, merton model in Excel or Google. Here we go. And be careful what you type in because BDSM is not far off. Homework is, and I'm putting it in the timestamp as well. Homework is build your own black sholes, merton model in Excel or sheets. Use chat GPT for help as needed. And post the results in the discord. And to wait if we don't really have to standardize it, now I'm not going to standardize it. You can use whatever underlying you like. I don't, I want you to be able to look at the stuff that, that you feel like looking at. So that's the gameplay. All right gang, I'm off for tonight. If you need anything, hit your boy up, be an outlier. See you all later.
