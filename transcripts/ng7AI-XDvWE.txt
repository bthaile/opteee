594.00s: however
596.00s: well
598.00s: if you
599.36s: episodes that we did, I totally forgot that I started doing this random thing with how
604.28s: I present when we're doing the episode, which is typically a post the day of just to
610.20s: remind everybody. And normally it's like, if blank can do blank, then you can learn
613.72s: options. And we just got back at it today. So that's actually two big wins for Eric because
618.92s: I had two great popular culture references for today so far. For those that don't know,
624.16s: I don't know shit about pop culture. That's why it's topical. So Lauren, back to you, I
629.12s: noticed you didn't respond yet. Why did you do it again? So you reiterated, sell to
634.28s: close. Why is that? There's a specific reason I can tell you exactly why. And it's not because
638.88s: you're dumb, you're not. It's not because you're not paying attention because I know you are.
642.88s: It is something to do with the way that you automatically are framing these things in
646.64s: your mind. And it's super common. What you're doing is thinking of the trade or your
652.84s: you're thinking of the transactions from your standard perspective. And your standard
658.68s: perspective is buying options because I assume you don't sell options very much based on that
662.92s: response. Exactly. So Lauren says because that's what I do the most. That's exactly correct.
666.92s: Good. Nothing serious to take away from that. But the exercise that I just did there with her
672.84s: is something you all should be able to do with yourself, which is positive attribution.
678.28s: It's actually getting to the root of why something is happening and being aware of it. That's how
684.60s: we can make adjustments going forward is through awareness. So nice job, Lauren.
689.72s: All right. Next one. What is the most common method to settle an option? Super easy. We went over
696.12s: this. There's a statistic from OIC. I'm actually pretty sure I shared it. Yeah. This is just
704.44s: straightforward question. What's the most common method to settle an option?
709.88s: And it's not what you hear a lot of. Close. That's correct. Travel or so is correct. I forgot we
720.52s: got to get our our fake internet points go in my bad. Wait, where are the rest of my fucking
725.56s: emojis? Hold on. This is terrible. Oh, there they are. All right. We got our fake internet points.
732.36s: Normally I use a little trophy. Let's see if we can find something that's. I like the trophy.
740.44s: Oh, go did love that one. So travel or so gets plus one fake internet point. Congratulations.
749.96s: And the answer is the majority are closed. The reason why that's super important is because
758.28s: most of the people on Reddit in theta gang would lead you to believe that most options expire
765.96s: worthless. And they use that as a rationale for selling options. Most of them expire worthless.
771.64s: You sell the options. Most of them expire worthless. That is logical. The problem is is it's wrong.
776.84s: It's just not true. That's an issue. So the reason why I'm emphasizing quiz question number two
783.16s: is because this is tied to a really common mental approach and validation for
789.32s: way methodology for trading that's just purely inaccurate. It's just wrong. So most options do not
795.64s: expire worthless. So that does not bolster the position of selling options as some sort of secret
801.48s: edge that somehow everybody knows about. But it's still a massive edge. So last question here.
807.96s: What are the two big biggest differences between buying and selling options? There's more than
817.16s: two technically, but there's two massive differences. The most important ones as far as I'm concerned.
823.72s: So let's see if you guys can guess what those are.
827.96s: It's something we talk about a lot. One, we're building trades.
831.40s: Premium call capital. It says premium. That's not it. Why not says credit debit. That's not it either.
840.28s: It's think of the implications of that. Travelers will say debit and credit again. That's okay.
849.00s: Here we go. Okay. Reese has part of it.
854.28s: There you go. Elizabeth has the full answer. So at Elizabeth, you get plus one fake internet point.
865.80s: And since somebody made fun of my goat, which is a little it's saddening to me because I really
871.88s: like the goat. I'm a let this is a point for Elizabeth, but it's also a slight to be clear against
883.24s: Lauren, which is stopped at bullshit, respect the goat. So Elizabeth gets plus one fake internet
890.28s: point. That's exactly correct. The most important differential between buying and selling options.
898.84s: Unequivocally is not the fact that there's credits and debits. That is a big difference to be clear.
904.28s: That you know, I already said that it's there's multiple differences, but the biggest ones by far
911.40s: have everything to do with this risk reward graph. This is the zero line. So if we buy a call,
921.08s: it's going to look like this. And if we sell a put, it's going to look like this.
935.08s: Now easy does it. I know everybody's going to start reading into the to the symbol just like they
939.40s: did with fucking Elon Musk. Everybody chill out. These are just two risk reward profiles overlaid
945.72s: with one another. The biggest difference to be aware of here is the risk side of the equation
954.12s: and the reward side of the equation. This is the biggest difference. Now there's a lot of nuanced
961.40s: differences between them. And we went over that in the last session. So we're not going to
964.44s: belabor those points. Well, the reason why you have to be aware of this is because when we get into
970.60s: a further session, where are we session number nine? We're going to talk about it before we get to
975.64s: number nine. But at session number nine, we're talking about how to build an options trade. This
981.64s: difference is one of the defining features that's going to naturally back you into different
988.92s: decisions. Great. Okay. So we ever quiz done. Let's talk real quick about what you saw in the last
999.00s: session. You saw the differences between buying and selling from a holistic perspective. We looked
1004.28s: at everything from how to open the trades, how to close the trades, how to settle the trades,
1008.52s: the risk profiles for the trades, understanding when we might want to buy, when we might want to
1015.40s: sell all of that was in the last session. This is going to continue to just grow so that you have
1021.40s: a quick recap of what we spoke about last time. Now let's talk about the agenda for today. We are
1026.44s: getting into option pricing, explain. So we're at 17 minutes, 10 seconds. I'm updating our timestamps.
1039.00s: And this is what we're going to talk about today. We're going to talk about the components of an
1043.00s: options contract. We're going to talk about what premium is you already know what premium is,
1047.24s: because we talked about that before. We're going to talk about it again. We're going to talk about
1050.52s: pricing models and pricing model inputs. We're going to talk about bid-ask spreads. We're going to
1056.04s: talk about in order book and layering. And then we're going to talk quickly about some of the actual
1062.04s: implications of this stuff through the Greeks. So your T L O's terminal learning objectives.
1070.44s: This is a really obnoxious military term whenever you do, well, especially for the Marine
1075.24s: Corps, I don't know what other services call it. Whenever you take a military course, you have TLOs
1080.28s: and ELOs. TLOs terminal learning objectives are what you should know at the end of the session.
1085.56s: This is what you should know at the end of the session. ELOs are enabling learning objectives.
1090.36s: Those are the things we're going to learn along the way. Essentially these things. So this is what
1096.52s: you're going to walk away from the session with today, as well as an understanding of these
1103.48s: common questions and misconceptions. The questions you see here are, first one, this is from a comment
1113.88s: on the post, I think. This one is, how do you quickly identify mispriced options? Great question.
1119.32s: Next one. This is from Reddit, which is how do you use Black Sholes Merton model to price options?
1125.40s: Next one after that is using option pricing models as a retail trader. Are they relevant?
1129.96s: That's also from Reddit. And then the last one was a DM to me on Reddit, which is which option
1135.32s: pricing model is most optimal? So we're going to answer all of those by the end of this. Okay.
1142.36s: Take a quick pause before we actually get kicked off with the material and see from you all in
1149.96s: the chat right now. If there are any other specific questions that you have, the way that this
1157.00s: question list works is by the end of the session, you should have an answer to whatever the question
1164.36s: is that you have. That's why I'm tracking them here. This is why they're literally for everybody
1169.64s: to see. So at the end of the session, you will literally be able to answer everything that we input
1175.48s: over here. If there's anything else that you want to add, if there's anything related to option
1179.64s: pricing that you want to get an answer on, now's the time to bring it up. If not, and these questions
1185.80s: are good, we can continue on. All right. Great. So let's get started. We are going to grab our
1197.40s: handy dandy notebook and no unlike the dude from Blues Clues. I'm not what, what, what, what,
1203.88s: drugs that he ended up doing. Didn't he get kicked off the show for doing like a bunch of drugs?
1210.36s: I can't remember what the drugs were. But shout out to him, we're not going to go that route.
1218.60s: We're going to grab our handy dandy notebook. And grab the notebook, leave the, the drugs,
1225.80s: put those down. No book, no drugs, to be clear what we're doing here. Sorry to let everybody down.
1234.20s: So the first thing, components of an options premium. Now I realized
1243.24s: this actually is mislabeled. This should be components of an options premium.
1254.04s: And the way that I typically would write this as inputs to.
1258.92s: And the reason why I differentiate that way just for your context is the details of an options
1267.80s: contract are the standard things that we quote when we're talking about an option, right?
1272.36s: We talk about what the underlying symbol is, what the days expiration are, what the strike price
1276.44s: is premium, the type, whether it's a caller put that kind of thing. This is what we typically
1281.56s: refer to when we're citing an options contract. This is not the same as the primary inputs into a
1288.20s: pricing model, which are these elements here. So the first input into a pricing model is the
1296.12s: underlying price. Why is this an input? Simple. Because if I'm dealing with an option that's tied to
1308.44s: an underlying that's worth $5, it's going to have a completely different series of values
1314.44s: than an option that's $500. Let's take a look at this for a practical example together.
1320.04s: You're going to notice I'm going to do a lot of these where I'm going to take us into an options
1324.84s: chain together so that you can see with me. So let's start with Cisco. This is great because
1332.44s: this is a $60 stock. It's cheap. Let's go to 28 days to expiration. Let's go to the at the
1339.48s: monies. The 50 delta right now, which is 62 and a half. Let's see what these are worth.
1345.16s: $1.73 by $1.90. You don't have to know what that stuff means just yet. That's just the price
1351.88s: for this 62 and a half call. That's 28 days to expiration. Let's go to meta. I'm pretty sure meta
1357.96s: is pretty expensive now in it. Yeah. Meta six six forty seven. Let's take a look at the at the money.
1364.52s: The six 50s. The six 50 call in the same expiration cycle is 2985 and 3010. What do you notice?
1374.76s: Way more expensive. So the first input that's relevant to us is the underlying itself and it's
1384.60s: because the underlying itself will have different values that are important to us. The next one is the
1392.28s: type of option that we're looking at. Is it a call or is it a put? The reason why that matters
1399.88s: is because the pricing relative to both of those is going to be slightly different which will explain
1406.04s: later. We also care if it is a US or American style option or European style option. The reason why
1419.64s: this matters is because early exercise applies here does not apply here. That impacts our pricing
1429.32s: models early exercise is a risk. So this one doesn't have a risk that this one does. That's why that
1437.80s: matters. The strike price which all of you are familiar with but when we pop open an option
1444.04s: chain that's literally just the price that the contract is tied to. That's essentially if you're
1451.40s: talking about a house the contract price for the house is whatever the buyer and seller agree
1457.72s: that the house is worth and they're going to transact that. That's what this is. That's what the strike
1463.32s: price is. Next up we have days to expiration. The reason why this is an input is because
1473.64s: an option is a contract between two people. The duration of the contract matters a lot. Imagine
1483.56s: if you were going to go to an insurance provider for a car and let's say that you were going to
1490.04s: get a car and you needed to have automobile insurance in order to be able to drive it around but
1495.08s: you only needed insurance for two days. Just work with the example. I know it doesn't work like
1499.24s: that but work with the example here. Do you think that the insurance that you would pay for two days
1506.36s: is more expensive or less expensive than insurance that would last a year? Kind of straightforward.
1514.52s: I imagine you probably know the answer but what's more expensive? The two-day insurance or the one-year
1522.28s: insurance and I'm not talking on a relative basis. I'm talking as at a gross dollar amount.
1529.48s: Rises on it one year. Pretty simple. Why? Because it's a longer contract. That's exactly why.
1537.80s: So, days to expiration is important because the length of the contract will impact the price associated
1545.56s: with it. The current risk-free rate. The reason why the current risk-free rate isn't input to models
1556.28s: is because it tells us what price we need to have integrated into the pricing model where a
1564.60s: participant could go get that risk-free rate somewhere else. So, there needs to be a reason for us
1571.80s: to trade an options contract which has additional risk. If you don't integrate the risk-free rate
1578.92s: and let's say that the pricing is completely off where you could get the risk-free rate somewhere
1584.04s: else for free and then an option happened to be cheaper on a relative basis. Who wouldn't go for
1589.96s: the risk-free rate? I would. It's risk-free. So, the risk-free rate is a really important input into the
1596.36s: model. The next one is any dividend yield to the underlying. The reason why yield is so important
1607.48s: is because it impacts the stock price movement, volatility. It impacts the propensity for early
1616.12s: assignment risk. So, the yield really is important from two different perspectives. A call has
1625.16s: early assignment risk. If you're short of call, a short put doesn't have early assignment risk
1629.72s: from a sales side perspective. However, the short put has the risk on the market dropping
1636.20s: after the dividend. So, both calls and puts are impacted by the dividend yield.
1642.04s: And then there's the last one that is in gold. Volatility. The reason why volatility is in gold
1653.16s: is because when we look at a pricing model, all of these things are known. Every single one of these
1660.52s: details are known. Definitively, it's not I'm taking a guess. I know them definitively. I can look
1667.56s: at the underlying and see what the price is. The price for meta right now is 647-49. I can see the
1674.20s: price right now. The type of option I can see if I'm talking about calls or puts. I can see it
1681.32s: right now. If we look at the type of contract that it is US American versus European, you can see
1689.56s: those pretty simply by looking up the contracts. The strike price we already talked about. You can see
1694.76s: that right in the middle there. There's your strike price. I can see all of these things right now.
1701.08s: Days to expiration. That's the length of the contract. If I move this over, I can see the days
1707.24s: to expiration. The risk free rate, you can look that up on any sort of platform that shows you
1713.00s: bond prices or the sofa rate or the library. Depending on the duration of the contract that you're
1719.16s: looking at, the dividend yield. This is also a known. We can see this up here. So the point is
1728.28s: all of these are known right from the jump. The only one that we don't know is this to be
1738.44s: technically correct is implied. All it's a
1749.32s: the reason why implied volatility is not known is why. Why is this one input into the pricing
1759.00s: model not known? Any guesses? Why is implied volatility not known? We know everything else here.
1773.96s: Why not known? Talk to me. Talk to me, goose. Can't predict future price. You can predict, but your
1788.36s: point is well made. Implied volatility deals with the future, which is unknown. We can predict it,
1798.12s: right? We can come up with estimates based on where we think it's going to go. And we actually can
1802.76s: predict pretty well. But that part aside to why not specific point you can't predict what
1812.28s: meta is going to be next Wednesday. We can have ideas, but we can't predict it. That's
1819.64s: a noble until next Wednesday. We can come up with an expected range. But remember,
1826.60s: implied volatility is just an expectation of price movement. That's all it is. So we do not know
1835.96s: the implied volatility element of a pricing model. This very, very important point as we go through
1844.20s: the rest of the session together. So I will take a pause there. Where's my other little sheet? My
1852.12s: little croissant input to an options premium. Do you feel comfortable with the inputs to an option
1864.84s: price based on what we just talked about? Those are the inputs to an option price.
1869.80s: I'm just updating our timestamps. And 54 is good. Capital Apes says the standard deviation
1884.36s: play a factor. That's what implied volatility is tracking the standard deviation. It's looking for
1891.40s: deviation of future price. Reese says, so how do we arrive at input? I'm sorry, at implied volatility,
1906.92s: which is a great question. We're going to talk about that more in a minute. So good so far, it seems.
1914.20s: Okay, cool. Don't worry, Reese. We will get we will
1918.92s: touch on that when we get into the pricing model input specifically. So to pivot now over to
1925.96s: premium premium, fortunately, is really, really simple premium is broken down into two buckets.
1934.28s: So let's do a little bit of drawing together. We got to, you know, sometimes you like, you just
1940.44s: got to draw, you just got to express yourself. The funniest thing about all this drawing is I really
1944.76s: actually hate drawing. I don't like it at all. So this is always entertaining to me. But let's talk
1952.68s: about the premium of an option, which is Spanish for the price. There are two elements that equal
1967.48s: to premium. There's X-Trenzic and Intrenzic.
1981.48s: Intrenzic is simply the strikes relationship
1987.88s: to price. X-Trenzic is made of volatility, implied volatility, time.
2006.60s: So one of the notes here is that, there you go, you can see the
2011.96s: fly volatility there. One of the notes here is that implied volatility lives within time.
2020.68s: There are two different things you can isolate them. But the more time we have, the more time
2028.04s: implied volatility has to be volatility. So implied volatility doesn't exist without time.
2037.80s: So what that means is if time is zero, what does that mean? It means that we're talking about a
2045.56s: contract, and I'm saying zero at expiration. I'm not saying like a zero DTE that still is the
2050.12s: rest of the day. I'm talking at expiration zero. The reason why you need time for volatility is
2057.32s: because we're talking about implied volatility. It's forward looking. If you are at time zero at
2065.72s: expiration, there is no more forward looking. The contract is now expired. It's all historic
2072.44s: at this point. None of that is forward looking. The contract is gone. So that's why implied
2079.00s: volatility lives within time. As soon as time is zero, implied volatility is gone for that contract.
2085.16s: Needs time. Now the relationship between strike and stock is relative to whether or not we're
2096.28s: talking about a call or put. So let's take a quick look at these. I actually think it might be in
2104.76s: this. Yeah, here. So we can take a look at calls versus puts, the type of option,
2114.44s: and we can see that this gray, I don't even know what color is that.
2119.88s: What color is this? The shaded area. It almost looks purple. I have no idea what color to call
2125.16s: that. You're going to have to help me out here. This shaded area represents in the money for calls.
2131.24s: This shaded area, everybody says purple. Okay. Yeah. So we'll go purple. Alberto says violet.
2137.56s: Alberto is going. Alberto is going real specific, which you guys will have to confirm or deny
2144.68s: if this is actually violet. In the money for calls is simply when the stock price is above your strike
2155.24s: or puts, it's the inverse. The reason why money matters is because it impacts the probability
2163.72s: of the option being in the money, which impacts the overall value of that option.
2170.12s: Options that are expected to have intrinsic value are worth more than options without intrinsic
2177.64s: value. So super important point. Okay. So now we take a pause with respect to premium and see
2190.60s: if you have any question. What questions do we have on premium of options? Do you understand
2201.48s: how it's broken down into intrinsic and extrinsic value and the differences between intrinsic and
2207.48s: extrinsic value? Do we feel good about this? Lauren says it's plum. I think plum is, let's see. I
2224.28s: don't know. I feel like Lauren's bullshit me right now. Yeah. I think Lauren is playing games.
2238.44s: It's not fucking plum. That's straight bullshit.
2243.96s: Unbelievably, Lauren, I thought that we actually had a decent relationship built on trust and
2256.20s: respect and come to find out you straight up fucking lie to me about the color. Unbelievably.
2263.24s: Okay. So now we have a pretty good understanding of premium. What premium is? Now we update
2273.56s: our timestamps. Now we're going to talk about pricing models.
2280.28s: So pricing models as we go back to this, we already know and we belabored the point. All of this
2287.56s: stuff is known except this. So then the question becomes how do we get this? Where does this come from?
2296.12s: I don't know if you guys have seen I was about to make a joke. I feel like literally nobody would have
2299.88s: gotten. If you would have gotten this joke, let me know. But I was I was going to say, where does this
2307.56s: come from? And then the joke was going to be, but where do I come from? And then the response
2312.84s: of that is get a journal low again. If you haven't seen those clips, which I imagine is the majority
2318.36s: of people, you won't get that joke at all. But if you do, you'll actually probably get a chuckle
2323.16s: out of that. But where does this come from? Let's take a look.
2330.28s: Good. All. Volatility. So I actually have a video that talks about volatility in detail.
2344.76s: So I am going to share that video with you here.
2350.52s: Right there. So volatility. We don't need to add it here. Volatility is the only input that we're
2366.84s: missing. So that video goes through volatility in depth. The way that we price an option effectively
2376.20s: is through pricing volatility. There are a lot of different kinds of volatility. And if you'll
2386.20s: notice back on this, we literally have an entire session about volatility by itself. That's how
2393.32s: important it is as an input to this entire thing that we do as option traders. One of the things
2400.68s: you are doing, whether you realize it or not, every single time you are trading an option,
2408.28s: is you are expressing an opinion on volatility, whether you mean to or not, you are.
2415.00s: So you have to understand that because it changes the way that we frame and make decisions on
2422.44s: position sizes, types of positions, the way we structure our trades, which we'll get into in a
2429.32s: future session. So here we have forecast volatility. Forecast volatility is how we determine
2441.16s: expected volatility. And there are all different kinds of tools people use. The entire world of
2451.80s: forecast volatility is where you see all of the advanced institutions, market makers. That's where
2460.36s: they're all playing. They're all trying to be the best at figuring out what volatility should
2469.72s: be priced at. So the way that that works are people using all kinds of pricing models. And it's not
2479.64s: pricing models, simple as black, sholes, merton. We use black sholes, merton model as a way to
2488.04s: understand and simplify options. However, the world of pricing, the volatility input itself is
2497.24s: exceedingly complex. And that's where you will come across different models like Garsh EGarsh,
2505.40s: EJ Garsh, including jump diffusion. The cliff notes version of forecast volatility is from a
2512.36s: retail trading perspective, you're not going to use it. You're not going to forecast volatility.
2519.64s: The reason why you're not going to forecast volatility more often than not, you could do it as a
2523.80s: scholastic exercise, right? Just to learn and to try it. You're not going to price fall better
2530.20s: than all of these other entities that are then expressing these opinions in the market.
2535.80s: So one, we're trying to figure out the price of an option. This, this is the biggest and most
2546.68s: important input that exists. If an implied volatility calculation is mispriced, it can lead to
2555.24s: significant opportunity for other traders to capitalize on that misprice valve.
2561.08s: The way that that can work from a theoretical perspective to give you an overview of what the
2565.40s: fuck this means that I'm saying. Let's say that we're not retail traders. Let's say that we're both
2572.44s: institutions. Let's say that we're both high frequency traders. If I'm a market maker and I'm
2580.36s: providing these quotes on what I think this option is worth. This quote literally just represents
2587.80s: a valid volatility, which is the value of the volatility. It's the value of the volatility that's
2592.60s: the value of the volatility that's what when people are talking about options in a technical
2597.48s: perspective, we just refer to them as VALSE. We talk about the volatility because none of this
2602.76s: other ship matters. It's all known. So the only thing we care about is the VALSE. So we can take a
2609.24s: look at something like this and we can determine what the current implied volatility being priced
2616.44s: but that's primarily what we use the Black Sholes-Mertan model for. Is it allows us to use the
2623.96s: differential equation to pull out the individual inputs and isolate the individual inputs so that we
2632.36s: can see what this is. So this 615 put right now is being priced at 41.75 all. Now going back to the
2643.80s: example. You and I are both institutions. We're both high frequency trading firms and we see
2651.64s: this being priced at 41.75 VALSE. According to our model, which they're competing with one
2659.72s: another, according to our model, which we've spent tons of time in R&D. We literally have a
2666.84s: fucking army of PhDs that man the model and update it. They come in and they say, oh wow, that 41.75
2674.76s: is way off. That's super high compared to what our model says. So then what do we do? We come in
2682.44s: and we sell this volatility. That's the cool part about consensus-driven markets because there are
2692.92s: so many really smart entities interacting here. You're going to get a pretty good example of what
2701.00s: volatility is priced at because as soon as that one hypergoose-re-trading firm comes in and says
2706.36s: that this is priced too high and they start selling it, then there's going to be others that will
2710.44s: probably arrive at a similar conclusion and also sell it. There's going to be a bunch of people
2714.52s: selling it that's going to drive the price down. Now there's a really good chance that one, the
2720.20s: market maker would catch on really, really fast. But two, from a retail trading perspective,
2726.20s: you're not involved in this game. This is shit that's happening way outside your purview, especially
2732.44s: as a beginner. As an intermediate to advanced trader, you can absolutely, I've tried
2739.00s: forecasting volatility just at a curiosity. And sometimes it's right. But it rarely is anything
2746.60s: worth the effort of trying to maintain a forecast model that actually would have enough
2752.92s: edge priced into it to be able to just isolate vol like that and then compete on this
2758.68s: space because the mispriceings that we're talking about now are dramatized just to make it easier
2764.76s: to understand. The mispriceings that they might be looking for on the market, it's not even out
2769.64s: to two decimal points. It could be out to six decimal points and they would put the trade on at such
2775.72s: scale and they can also more directly isolate volatility through hedging activities because they
2781.32s: have lower transaction costs that they can actually isolate this thing and put it on scale to
2787.08s: take advantage of much, much smaller price discrepancies that we just don't have access to.
2795.32s: So all of these different pricing models that you see floating around binomial trees,
2803.24s: black sholes, merton, these are theoretical pricing models. They're designed to help us understand
2810.20s: options and they're used as simplifying functions in no way are these the way that options are
2819.48s: actually being priced in the context of volatility. Because once we price volatility,
2828.36s: we can use something like black sholes, merton because we can adjust for some of the simplifying
2834.36s: assumptions it makes with respect to the stock distribution and we can use log normal. We can change
2841.48s: those small inputs to make it pretty accurate but pretty fast. The thing about getting really
2846.92s: accurate with stuff like this is that these kinds of pricing models are close enough provided that
2853.80s: the implied volatility calculation is very accurate. So to use more advanced pricing models typically
2861.88s: introduces latency. Pricing models use simplifying functions so that they're one consumable
2868.36s: but two so that not consumable to be clear for you and I they don't give a fuck about you and I.
2872.76s: It's so that when they're programming them they're fast and this is typically good enough.
2879.72s: So the way to think about pricing is far as a retail trader. Options are priced by institutions.
2889.16s: They're priced by institutions that are playing these games that I'm outlining for you here.
2894.60s: The pricing that we participate in is whether or not we think the current price is fine for whatever
2902.36s: we're trading but to answer our first question from this is how do you quickly identify mispriced
2911.08s: options you fucking don't as a retail trader you absolutely do not you have no fucking idea
2918.20s: and it's because this game is happening at a level that you don't even see. So the game of
2924.52s: identifying mispriced options it's not for you. There's going to be other entities that are much
2930.28s: smarter faster well equipped to do that actual thing you will not know if it's priced correctly
2937.32s: or not because think of what this represents if you are able to identify a mispriced option as a
2945.48s: retail trader that means every other active market participant missed it and didn't do anything
2953.16s: about it. Probably not going to happen. So this one is super simple you don't quickly identify
2961.08s: nor do you typically identify it much at all you just take an opinion on what volatility might be
2967.40s: or what you think volatility might be but to go as far as calling something mispriced
2973.80s: way off. The other thing to keep in mind is that there's a really important relationship between
2980.68s: puts and calls called put call parity if put call parley parity is violated in any way there are
2988.84s: high frequency trading algorithms that are hunting for that exact scenario and the reason why they're
2996.68s: hunting for that scenario is because there's an arbitrage opportunity or there's different kind of
3001.56s: positions that can be put on to even have a risk-free trade potentially. So there's an arbitrage
3007.24s: opportunity. So that's again going to happen so fast you you literally won't even see it. So there
3016.68s: are structures that maintain the relationship between puts and calls from an efficient market
3021.56s: perspective and then when it comes to the pricing of options we as retail traders we simply go
3026.92s: through and we accept whatever the market is pricing the balls at. So right now for meta pricing
3036.36s: the 620s at 41.66 I take that as accurate I don't have a better estimate than vol on that
3044.36s: and me running anything through a black sholes martin model doesn't fucking matter unless I have a
3049.24s: different volatility input. So then the question is where do you get your volatility from? We as retail
3055.64s: traders we derive it from the market we take that's why it's called implied vol were implying it
3064.60s: from the market but the input that's actually used in pricing models is called forecast
3071.00s: ball that's when we decide what volatility should be and what we're going to price volatility
3078.36s: act. Okay big big section so I'm going to take a pause there and I want to see how we feel
3088.36s: about pricing models and pricing model inputs if we have questions we can do that now
3095.48s: I'm just updating our timestamps quick. Okay let's see any questions on what we just talked
3115.40s: about any questions about pricing models pricing model inputs anything like that
3126.20s: why not says I'll get full off of the market crumbs that's the thing is just because volatility
3131.24s: is priced correctly or accurately that's that's not the way that we're making our money.
3137.64s: The way to think about market pricing of options is if options were mispriced or priced to rich
3146.36s: or too cheap if that were the case then there's the ability to capitalize and to monetize that
3153.88s: and that's where you hear of things like variance risk premiums because we know an indices that
3160.28s: volatility tends to be priced rich that's for a bunch of different reasons and there's literally
3166.28s: a known phenomenon around that that people can monetize so that's one way to make money that's one
3173.48s: profit mechanism as you will hear me refer to it as but just because there's not a bunch of
3180.20s: mispricing in options for us to go around and try to trade all the time there's a bunch of other ways
3184.76s: we can make money in options it's that's just not our game.
3191.24s: Recess in retrospect can we say an option was mispriced?
3197.24s: I mean yeah but it doesn't really mean anything so the way that we would infer that an option was
3204.52s: mispriced is if we price volatility and then something moves either too far within that volatility
3211.96s: band or too far outside of that volatility band but looking at it in retrospect doesn't really
3218.92s: matter that much from an IV perspective but you can I think that's that's an okay to wait a phrase
3224.28s: it but say it says what's the difference between IVR and IVX the fuck is IVX where is that from?
3231.48s: I don't know that one.
3233.40s: Any
3243.80s: Recess if everything was priced perfectly I wouldn't have any 100% winners that's incorrect
3248.36s: again you're you're focusing on the wrong thing let me explain this because I can tell that
3253.56s: this part's confusing people.
3263.72s: Okay we have two scenarios
3277.96s: I'll give me one second looks like.
3282.44s: Oh I ordered Mel she really likes salt so I ordered Mel a bunch of there's this drink brand
3289.16s: called element ELM and tears some shit like that and they just do like hydration stuff like
3299.24s: liquid IV and whatnot but there's stuff like super it tastes like drinking fucking salt water
3303.72s: I have no idea how she could possibly like if at any way she was just talking to me about that
3308.12s: scenario one we have a house
3310.60s: we have two windows and then scenario two we also have a house this one also has two windows
3320.20s: pretend that these are the same and that the windows both look good so house one this is priced
3326.12s: at 100k house two is priced at 80k let's say that they are the same house one house two they're
3339.96s: the same house in the same neighborhood they're the same these are just two alternate universes
3345.16s: different dimensions in dimension two this was from an estate sale
3353.56s: and this is just being sold on the normal market and let's say after five years
3362.12s: the house is now worth 500k
3370.76s: just because this house wasn't quote unquote mispriced doesn't mean you can't still make tons of money
3382.60s: the difference is the margin you make might look a little bit different
3389.48s: so the way to think about options being priced properly doesn't mean that you can't make money
3396.52s: you absolutely can make money it just means that you're not making money from an inaccurate or
3404.60s: mispriced basis itself again I'm using an estate sale as the example for the mispricing here
3410.60s: everything else being the same you can still make money it's just priced appropriately
3417.72s: so even though it's priced appropriately at 100,000 if it goes up to 500,000 you make money
3423.00s: the difference here is that if this is mispriced you might be able to make more money or
3427.64s: you might be able to make money in a different way and it doesn't work well with the real estate
3432.36s: example because you can't really arbitrage this but in options you could arbitrage it so let's pretend
3437.48s: that this is an options contract now which I don't know why I drew that little face it looks
3441.08s: kind of funny pretend this is an options contract now and if this was mispriced for whatever reason
3448.44s: we actually don't want to trade it up to 500,000 anymore because we actually think it's worth
3453.64s: 100k this is the mispricing as far as we're concerned so what we want to do is isolate this
3459.96s: difference through hedging activities to capture that differential that's all so the pricing of an
3467.64s: option being priced correctly doesn't mean that you can't make money and it being reflective of
3474.20s: priced correctly or incorrectly they're just different profit mechanisms completely different
3479.64s: profit mechanism so that's the that's the lesson there let me pop the door for door real quick and
3486.60s: we'll be back
3489.72s: so because options are priced correctly it does not mean that you just get bread crumbs it does
3503.88s: not mean that you have to be the peasant out in the market you have to be the peasant out in the
3508.44s: market anyways because we're retail it has nothing to do with the pricing of options they're completely
3513.64s: different things so the way to think about the pricing of options is that they offer specific elements
3520.84s: that can enhance things they offer a different profit mechanism but as I mentioned in the beginning
3526.04s: you don't have access to that profit mechanism it's just the reality of it
3532.84s: okay let me get back to the questions we can spend literally as much time on this section the rest
3538.28s: of these are going to be super fast and this is the the heart and soul of this session so feel
3543.32s: free to throw literally anything you have at the the questions that's exactly what we should be
3549.00s: talking about right now because this is the important element okay Reese says so making money comes
3555.64s: from the risk assumed because it've gone another way doesn't mean it was mispriced yeah that's
3561.08s: exactly correct yep James says it's super confusing trying to figure out which IV to go by as it's
3569.96s: different from different brokers um I don't imagine I don't know I don't look between brokers that much
3577.40s: but I don't imagine implied volatility is going to be that different between most of them but if it is
3584.12s: you could always just split the difference between the two assuming that they're not that different
3588.44s: if there's a big difference somehow I would go to a third broker and then see which of the cluster
3594.28s: between two out of three looks most correct to you and it also depends on what volatility they're
3600.12s: providing to you there's implied volatility which the implied volatility should not be different
3604.68s: the implied volatility is pulled directly from the option prices that are resting on the market
3609.40s: if they have a theoretical volatility that's their own volatility calculation
3615.56s: James says IV IVR IVX IV is implied volatility IVR is implied volatility rank completely different
3624.04s: things IVX I'm really not sure what that is I'm assuming that might be a newer thing let me see
3631.00s: I'm wondering if that's like from Tasty Trades platform or something I just I don't use that one
3636.12s: oh
3644.20s: oh duh it's so if I'm understanding what you're talking about correctly you're talking about the
3650.04s: implied volatility index is that correct
3656.92s: yeah so it's from Tasty yeah so I so implied volatility index is a slightly different thing
3665.08s: but the the way to think about volatility and again we have a whole session that will go through
3671.08s: all of these different things and if you check out that video that I shared above it's literally
3678.52s: it literally talks about all this stuff but implied volatility is a different function
3685.72s: implied volatility tells us how volatile something is as a percent basis implied volatility rank
3692.92s: or percentile take the implied volatility and they make it relative to itself so let's take a
3701.56s: look see if we can find an example and share we can so right now meta has a 43% vol and a 73%
3711.24s: implied volatility percentile and a 76% implied volatility rank I almost always use implied volatility
3720.76s: percentile because it's much less prone to skew which implied volatility rank is the way to
3728.76s: think about these two implied volatility percentile and implied volatility rank they're very
3733.08s: similar to one another they look to take this volatility and make it relative to the underlying
3739.40s: not just a gross amount so just let's remember these numbers implied volatility 43%
3747.32s: and implied volatility percentile at 73% let's just click through let's see if we can find something else
3756.84s: great example I knew it instincts right on fleek implied volatility in GameStop is 78.25
3765.72s: so almost double what you saw in meta but take a look at the implied volatility percentile
3773.88s: 8% what's going on here why is this the case there's a distinct reason so the implied volatility
3786.36s: in GameStop is much higher but the implied volatility percentile and rank both are much lower
3794.12s: why is that the case what does that tell you
3799.40s: uh rowing titty says did you see my question I did not feel free to dump it back in and we can
3803.96s: circle back on it rowing titty says market cap that's not it that's an okay guess
3811.00s: Reese says gm is usually higher implied volatility compared to meta I think is what you meant
3818.04s: and oh I see you're talking about the same yeah same same so what Reese is saying is correct
3824.76s: what he's saying is that generally speaking GameStop has higher volatility than what it has right
3831.64s: now even though the volatility in GameStop is already double what it is in meta so that tells you
3840.68s: that GameStop is more volatile of an underlying think of this is another way of viewing beta
3849.16s: if we view beta of the s and b500 it's typically 1.0 if you look at things that move around more
3855.56s: you'll have beta of 1.3 1.5 2.3 you can have beta that's in excess of it this is a similar way of
3862.60s: looking at that
3867.24s: um rowing titty says do option premiums have more volatility buyers and sellers at half
3875.96s: in whole dollars like stocks do
3878.92s: you do option premium have more volatility buyers and sellers at half in whole dollars like stocks do
3893.32s: I think you're mixing a bunch of things here so if we look at
3900.36s: the number of buyers and sellers which we would refer to as liquidity then absolutely I actually
3907.00s: talk about that quite a lot where if we look at the open interest and if we look at the volume
3913.48s: for half strikes compared to whole strikes and even whole strikes compared to whole number
3920.36s: whole strikes you will nearly almost always see this where the implied I'm sorry we're the
3932.28s: open interest and the volume for those options is way more so it's way more liquid one using whole
3942.68s: strikes as compared to half strikes the next factor to that is whole numbers so it's typically
3949.40s: things that end in five there's zeros that will have more open interest than the surrounding
3956.76s: options great example of that is here if you take a look at the 20s there's 2900 of them if you take a
3964.44s: look at the 21s there's 23 so there's still more of the 20s then if we look through all of these
3969.48s: there's like nothing 35 166 10 137 nothing until we get to this one that's 3600 what number do you
3977.24s: think that is 25 so normally zeros and fives will have the bulk of volume and open interest now your
3986.84s: inclusion of implied volatility in that statement is what makes it confusing because the implied
3992.84s: volatility is a completely separate factor and it has less to do with whether or not it's a half
3998.84s: strike or a full strike and it has more to do with if it's closer to or further out of the money
4007.56s: that's the difference here so the half strike whole strike whole number round number whatever
4014.44s: for volatility has way more to do with where it is in terms of relationship to the underlying price
4023.08s: so you'll notice that the tails of volatility tend to be priced higher than the at the
4029.40s: monies so if we take a look at this 20 data expiration we look at the 28s these are at the money
4035.32s: the volatility on these is 68 then if we go super far in the money the implied volatility here is 261
4045.16s: then if I go super far out of the money it's 150% notice how much higher the tails are compared to
4053.32s: the at the monies that's part of option pricing which has a lot to do with expectation of in the
4060.92s: money versus out of the money kind of keep it at a simple level okay next question from Amadeus
4069.96s: if two same price stocks have the same IV and the same underlying price and similar liquidity
4077.72s: will they be priced the same or does their historical volatility and price performance come into play
4083.96s: the historical volatility and price performance comes into play in forecasting volatility
4089.40s: so if we're saying that they have the same implied volatility we're inherently saying they have
4095.96s: the same historical price performance because that's an important factor for forecasting future
4103.00s: volatility is what something is done previously a great way to think about that and put it into
4108.60s: into similar context is think of the weather today and think about what you expect in general the
4116.28s: weather to be tomorrow probably pretty close to whatever it was today so volatility very much functions
4126.12s: the same volatility clusters and that's when it goes through its transition phases it tends to
4133.32s: hang out for a little while once it hits an extreme and it'll stay there for a little bit called
4137.88s: clustering so you can think of it similar to the weather in that context so based on your example
4143.80s: Amadeus by saying that they have the same IV you are inherently saying that their historical volatility
4152.12s: and price performance is the same so it definitely does come into play that's how one of the major
4157.24s: tools we use to forecast volatility of Roy Titi says maybe I'm asking wrong I mean if premium is at
4166.04s: 35 cents are there psychological levels at 50 and one dollar and so on oh I see you mean for the
4173.80s: actual premium itself not really that's the the pricing of an option in that way is going to be
4183.16s: determined by the market maker so that is much less done or as a factor of like human entries now
4192.52s: there typically is a slight natural lean versus some like I would prefer to sell something at 40
4200.60s: versus 39 but I would rather sell something at 41 versus 40 right so it's it's less so of just
4207.88s: trying to be at an even number on the premium that it's just a matter of what's the better price
4212.76s: relative to what you're trying to do that's relative to the premium itself great questions
4226.12s: I'm stoked it feels like you guys are feels like you guys are crushing this
4231.72s: so let's talk this one's easy let's talk about badass spread so we're at 45 did ask spread and then
4243.48s: we'll also do bit ass spread and order books we don't really have to talk about layering that's
4249.88s: more of a hft thing so bit ass spread simply represents the current market offered or an option
4260.68s: that's all so the bit asked spread are these two numbers you see the bid here the ask here the bid
4266.60s: here the ask here for calls inputs the bid is the most somebody's willing to pay think of the
4273.08s: people that do the have a 40 and they then they the auction people so the auction people essentially
4282.92s: as they do that rambling which I think I just did a excellent job mirror and if I do say so myself
4288.12s: they're essentially providing a market and the person when they raised their little thing
4294.44s: they raised their they raised their thing and they have you know their their fancy hats on and
4302.60s: shit when we go through that kind of pricing it's the same thing as the market there's a person
4312.04s: that's sitting in a chair that says I will pay $10 for that item then the auctioner will say
4318.52s: well do I have 12 and then they're going to try to find some data paid $12 and so on and so forth
4325.08s: so the bid is the most somebody is willing to pay at this time the ask is the cheapest somebody's
4330.84s: willing to sell now the cool part about markets is you typically can get filled between these
4336.92s: words the mid price and things that are liquid meaning there's a lot of people transacting in
4344.36s: there they will have narrower bid-ask spreads bid-ask spreads are super important because they
4354.52s: represent your ability to get into and out of something at a fair rate and we did a focus topic a
4362.76s: while ago on how to calculate liquidity bid-ask spreads and before you ask you already know I have a
4371.08s: video on it so I will share this video that goes in depth on assessing option liquidity bid-ask
4383.16s: spreads all of those kinds of things but the the main takeaway is for you to know that there are
4393.08s: two prices that you will see you typically can transact in between these prices these prices are
4400.20s: typically set by market makers one of the games for market makers is they obviously have to make
4407.96s: markets there's certain requirements for their quote book being turned on or the quote machine
4415.16s: being turned on for certain durations of time in certain things and if they violate those rules
4422.04s: then they can lose some of the benefits that they have as market makers the reason why that
4428.84s: matters is because it impacts them what they might rest on the order book the reason why it might
4437.64s: impact what they rest on the order book is because they still have an entire inventory of stuff
4447.56s: they have tons of positions on already so they might not want to take a whole bunch more of
4453.88s: game stop at either of these on the buy side or sell side if they can avoid it so they might price
4459.56s: them a little less aggressively or they might offer different sizes at that price so that's why
4468.52s: you typically can transact towards the middle is because the fair price is generally towards the middle
4476.20s: now you can actually use something like the black shoals merton model to figure out what the price
4484.76s: should be because right now this is telling you dollar 92 by 202 what should it be well guess what
4493.88s: you have an implied volatility input right here which is 6794 so I actually have a tool I can tell
4501.40s: you right now I just got to grab my thing I have a tool built in my trade log that does this
4508.36s: for me in two different ways it does it through the black shoals merton model to give me a theoretical
4513.24s: price and then it also gives me a binomial tree I have like a couple different versions of the
4518.20s: binomial tree but it gives me the delta the gamma all that stuff so we can run through
4524.12s: and input the ticker the underlying price the expiration the IV the the yield if there is one the
4534.84s: current risk-free rate relative to the duration that you're looking at and you can figure out
4540.52s: specifically what the call should be priced at what the put should be priced at that's called the
4544.36s: theoretical price travel ursel says is there an online calculator I'm sure there is the the fact
4552.92s: of the matter is whatever the whatever the price is shown to you as doesn't really matter that much
4563.24s: in all honesty because regardless of what the theoretical price is you still if you want to put
4569.72s: the trade on are going to have to transact at the prices that they're showing you and the idea
4576.44s: generally though is to try to transact towards the middle if we can that is much more preferable
4584.60s: than trying to transact obviously towards the bid or the offer we generally can do better than that
4593.16s: so let me take a pause on bid-ass price I'm gonna take a second and see if what Mel wants for
4599.88s: dinner and if you have any questions on this stuff perfect time throw it in and we can take a look
4617.88s: Frank says do you have any tips for setting a stop loss on contracts that I have a wide bid-ass spread
4621.96s: I feel hesitant to set one because I'm not maximizing gains well it depends on what the what the
4626.12s: stop losses for so that one is a slightly different question we can save time for the very end for
4632.76s: those I just want to handle stuff right now that's more specific to this feel free to bring that
4637.32s: back up though at the very end and we can take a closer look together but in the meantime just so
4644.20s: that I'm not leaving you hanging this video goes into that on using stops. Royntady says I find
4654.68s: they don't fill me often at the midpoint takes forever to get filled yep that's exactly correct
4659.80s: and it depends on what you're trading if you're trading something that's less liquid or more volatile
4664.52s: more volatility typically leads to less liquidity then you will find that exact thing if you're trading
4670.04s: something that's super liquid you'll almost always transact at the mid so if you're trading
4675.00s: stuff like game stop which is notoriously volatile or if you're trading smaller float stocks
4680.68s: cheaper stocks that have less overall volume then those tend to have wider bid-ass spreads the
4687.48s: probability of being filled right in the middle is yeah not not very high but that's just kind of normal
4703.96s: cool so I think we have one more thing on our agenda
4711.32s: which is the order book the Greeks will get into in a standalone session I'm actually going to make
4719.24s: sure let me find that really fast let's make sure that we have the Greeks as it's own we do so
4727.08s: the Greeks will go into more in depth what I was going to talk about with the Greeks with respect
4732.12s: to today is simply that the fact that the Greeks help us understand how things are priced like that's
4738.84s: pretty much it it gives us a little context on the pricing of what we're looking at
4761.72s: we're into the says so when we buy and sell options we are basically negotiating with the market
4766.84s: maker not the actual buyer sell that's correct the vast majority of instances the probability of
4771.32s: you stumbling across another retail trader that's looking to trade a single lot five lot ten
4777.64s: lot like a small position and being able to line up with them at the right time at the right price
4783.56s: and a gree on a price is very low so the market makers in that context they provide liquidity
4789.48s: and they essentially say sure I'll sell this to you at the this price whatever that price is they'll
4794.92s: take the inventory on they'll hold it until they have the ability to offload it to somebody else
4800.04s: that wants the other side of the trade that's what they're trying to do but they in the process
4805.16s: through providing liquidity is they will take on inventory which is actually a great segue
4811.40s: into a quick look at the actual order book and the order book there's different things level two
4817.40s: data again this is the order book here for the underlying and then you can look at the actual order
4823.40s: for individual options if you're so inclined so we could take a look at the 28th year
4831.64s: and you can see what the current sizes are what the current bids and offers are at those sizes so
4840.52s: this lets you take a peek at what's what this specific option for example is being traded and
4848.52s: offered at so the order books let you see what's in there and how much depth there is there's an
4857.24s: entire world around trying to use the order book to make trading decisions which can be done
4862.68s: but it's a little bit difficult the reason why it's a little bit difficult is because there's a
4866.12s: lot of games that are played in the order book so I don't want to spend too much time on that just
4874.84s: because it's not it's not really that applicable to most people but most traders at some point will
4884.44s: come across somebody or some entity that says like yo I can show you how to trade the order book
4892.04s: or something there's like a bunch of edge that you can extract out of here and the the summary of
4899.00s: that is no that that's not what's happening there's not a ton of edge that you're going to extract
4904.60s: out of the order book and that's just the reality so you can look at it you can use it for context
4912.52s: you can use it for intraday trading decisions all of that is fine all of that is possible all of
4917.72s: that is applicable but it's not like this this giant source of edge you know being able to view the
4923.64s: order oh boy there was a solo fritchy scratch on the door nuts all right let's update this we're at
4937.08s: 122 20 30 Q&A we'll talk about anything now anything that you want to hit anything that you're
4948.20s: curious about anything that we didn't fully cover we can talk about now uh
4956.44s: Rointit he says is order book the same as the tape no the tape is showing you what trades have
4962.84s: occurred so the tape is something over here time and sales and the tape really refers to a much
4970.60s: older thing which is like the the things that are sliding on the screen uh well when you're on
4975.48s: the pits like on the floor they have these screens that show transactions that are happening so
4981.96s: and it used to be like a physical tape but the the tape are transactions that have occurred so
4988.84s: the equivalent of that would be TNS time and sales the order book are things that have not happened
4994.44s: yet the order book are things that are resting so slightly different dark marks says what a type
5000.76s: account do you recommend for a beginner options trader in regards to taxes liquidity as it may be
5005.16s: brokerage account until things get to a certain predefined number than adjust then adjust to what
5013.00s: what you mean Willis and let me pop the door for Thor
5022.20s: here he is he's ready i told him that he has to answer some questions so where were you last night
5041.64s: nothing very very suspect very suspect why why won't you say where you were last night that doesn't
5051.08s: make sense to me what's your alibi unsure what his alibi is you guys will have to let me know if
5058.12s: it's legit or not but it seems it seems you see like he can't even look straight so i just don't know
5067.88s: about this uh i'm trying to see dark marks dark marks says adjust as in start in account that may have
5078.68s: more fees but better tax breaks IRAs and stuff uh kind of different right like
5084.84s: your your IRA versus a standard brokerage account shouldn't have more fees so i would call those
5092.44s: different but the the simple answer to that question is literally just about everybody should
5099.56s: absolutely whoa Jesus i'm trying to turn that down it's like nuking my eyes just about everybody
5108.12s: should have a retirement account and having a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA typically make
5117.32s: sense Roth IRA you will get priced out at some point it will mean that your income means that you
5124.84s: don't get a deduction from contributing your Roth IRA money which is not the end of the world
5133.64s: but there are other ways you can contribute to the IRA through what we call a back door
5138.12s: contribution sounds illegal it's not completely fine but it's essentially when you input money into
5144.20s: an IRA which again once you're at a certain income level it's not tax deductible you get no tax
5149.08s: break from it but then you can put that as a larger dollar amount into a Roth IRA and trade that
5155.64s: so to do um gc says seven k i think gc you're talking about the
5163.72s: maximum limits to contribute i'm talking about your income level and your ability to contribute
5170.84s: what ends up happening is when you make too much money it's not even that much money
5175.56s: once you get over a certain amount of money as your income they literally won't let you
5180.36s: contribute which is honestly also super annoying to be clear because it's like if you want people
5186.52s: to retire why the fuck are you penalizing people that save well but i digress so let's take a look
5191.96s: at Roth IRA income limit here so you can see in 2024 the Roth IRA income limits are 146
5205.56s: for single filers or 230 for married filing jointly so what that means is if you make over this
5213.56s: amount of money you can't contribute to one directly and there's no tax benefit to doing so
5218.60s: and then let's take a look at just regular IRA
5232.12s: yes it looks the same so if you're 230 or less you get a deduction of up to seven k
5238.60s: um and then as soon as you're over 240 there's no deduction so essentially the money you put into an
5245.40s: IRA from your income is taxed nominally but then you can do a conversion from traditional into Roth
5254.44s: so slightly different dark mark says i guess i'm asking can we trade options in certain retirement
5261.48s: accounts the same way you can in a brokerage account definitely yeah you absolutely can i trade
5265.24s: my IRA i also traded a 401k that i had from when i was working at the loit and stuff so yeah you
5273.96s: definitely can it's some of it will depend on the IRA is easy it'll depend on where you open it
5280.44s: they're typically slightly different rules that they apply so that means that like you can't trade
5286.12s: naked strategy so you have to keep your clothes on um which is luck and lame the other one is for
5295.48s: your 401k's you can trade those as well depending on who your provider is and like what they're all
5303.40s: i also realize i have one like this which is pretty like a me dad center in the middle middle and
5309.32s: big cool i figured that this is decent for q and a
5316.44s: ehaj says some 401k will not allow you to trade options yeah that sounds right it'll be based on
5320.76s: whatever the plan is um it says how did your position in any go today after sharp rise it had
5329.00s: today do you mean nne or ne2 different tickers so we have nne key which i still have a position in
5343.40s: and then ne which oh uh looks like the streaming thing hold on one second i don't know if i'm
5352.68s: still on uh there it goes uh mitea says nne i don't think i have anything in any any more
5365.88s: yeah i don't have anything in that i have nne but not ne so i have nothing that did anything yeah
5378.76s: gca says any just had earnings which it definitely did we were looking at this from an earnings play
5384.28s: perspective is the that like super blurry for you guys oh no that looks like nbm
5399.32s: nbm
5400.68s: um uh Trevor ursal says can we talk about stock consolidation what it is what it looks like what
5407.00s: not yeah for sure absolutely so thank you for bringing this up again during a stream because i
5411.40s: remember if i'm not mistaken this is something that you brought up in the discord somewhere i
5415.16s: don't remember where but i remember seeing this before so let's talk about that one really
5419.88s: quick because it's super easy so the way to think about consolidations is that consolidations are
5428.76s: just a form of price action that's it now i can tell that you're you're incorrectly assigning
5438.28s: consolidation to break out there's a relationship between them but it's not an inherent
5443.80s: relationship a breakout is a very specific uh profit mechanism that has very specific signals
5450.68s: that has very specific behaviors underlying conditions there is a relationship between
5456.12s: consolidations and breakouts but it's not consolidations and breakouts automatically are tied
5461.56s: together there's more to the equation than that let's talk about consolidation consolidation
5466.52s: and really anything else related to um actually sorry one sec i just want to update the stuff that
5473.56s: we've talked about in the q amp a my little log we talked about retirement accounts
5478.28s: i have to get better at updating this thing um we talked about
5493.40s: i think that's the main thing yeah okay cool so we talked about that and then we now are talking
5499.88s: about consolidation so for consolidation it's really simple it's relative to the time frame just
5509.72s: about everything that we've looked at so far when we're trading options or analyzing and underlying
5520.68s: it's highly relative to the time frame so if i zoom this out to a three year daily i can find
5527.48s: periods where the stock was consolidating consolidation is just a generally sideways range bound
5536.04s: price action so a consolidation would be something like this here so this range from here to here
5546.68s: this area is consolidation it's when an underlying is bouncing between a range and generally it will
5555.48s: be flat now the caveat is it's highly highly relative to the time frame you're looking at so if we
5570.28s: switch this to a five minute daily this is a consolidation on a five minute time frame this much
5579.32s: smaller range right here and then this is a breakdown out of the consolidation and then this is a
5585.72s: rally back up into another consolidation which is a consolidating in between this level so on and
5593.00s: so forth so the way to think about consolidation is just sideways trending price action it tends to be
5600.52s: when we're accumulating um people that are transacting at a specific level keeping it within a
5607.00s: range but it's highly relative to the time frame you can have things like this that on a five minute
5613.16s: fit on a five day 15 minute chart is consolidating but then if we zoom this out to a 30 day we can see
5620.20s: that it was actually moving in that time frame was going up but then if we zoom out further from a 30 day
5625.56s: time frame this is not consolidating it's going down this is consolidation here but then it's going down
5631.72s: so if I'm looking at a 30 day four hour chart and then I go out to a six month well that's not
5636.76s: really consolidating much it's still going down so it's relative to the time frame but consolidation
5643.16s: simply is generally sideways price action now when it comes to breakouts that's a whole other bag
5649.64s: breakouts have a lot to do with underlying conditions meaning specific earnings criteria that
5657.00s: have been met specific relationship to prior earnings specific fundamental conditions that set
5663.72s: something up that when it does break out of a consolidation phase it tends to be a stronger move
5672.36s: kind of like what we saw here this was consolidating it did try to break out this is a false breakout
5678.20s: because the consolidation area really is from here to here so I tried to pop out here didn't work
5685.56s: consolidated consolidated consolidated try to break out to the upside then got shot down broke out
5690.92s: to the downside also break out to the downside then it finally broke out to the upside through here
5697.56s: so the conditions though that lead to the subsequent breakout is a very specific profit mechanism
5705.00s: pretty pretty different all right gang I got me in 90 minutes in it's about time for me to go grab
5710.76s: my dinner sitting here if you guys have anything else feel free to hit me up in the discord happy to
5715.32s: catch up tomorrow we have the GME stream sunday we have the market prep probably for the pro members
5724.04s: and then we'll keep on keep it on from there so our your homework almost forgot your homework
5730.68s: for the session today about option pricing model is to build your own black sholes
5737.88s: martin pricing model in excel if you have no idea how to do that use chat gpt it can tell you
5746.76s: exactly how to do that it's very very simple black sholes martin model it sounds more
5752.68s: overwhelming than it is which is why that is your homework so for those that are doing the homework
5759.80s: you can post it in the discord there's a section in the learning lab there's a thread
5766.68s: that is the beginner workshop here and this is exactly where I'll grab the link to it I'll tag
5779.48s: everybody in the discord really quick everyone oops here you can post your homework
5794.28s: from the not all our options trading basics but just tagged everybody there so that you can
5806.60s: drop your homework in there for any review from people gca says what do we call all type it in
5813.72s: here so homework build your own black sholes martin model in excel or google there we go
5829.88s: and be careful what you type in because bdsm is not far off
5838.04s: homework is and I'm putting it in the timestamp as well homework is build your own black sholes
5849.88s: martin model in excel or sheets use chat gpt for help as needed and post the results in the discord
5866.36s: and to wait we don't really have to standardize it now I'm not going to standardize it you can use
5873.88s: whatever underlying you like I don't I want you to be able to look at the stuff that you feel like
5880.52s: looking at so that's the gameplay all right gang I'm off for tonight if you need anything hit
5887.64s: your boy up be an outlier see you all later
