540.00s:  you
542.00s:  you
570.00s:  you
577.00s:  I
591.00s:  moment
591.48s:  And if you couldn't tell, I actually owe you all an apology because for the first two options trading basic
598.48s:  Series or episodes that we did I totally forgot that I started doing this random thing
603.40s:  With how I present when we're doing the episode
607.32s:  Which is typically a post the day of just to remind everybody and normally it's like if blank can do blank
613.04s:  Then you can learn options and we just got back at it today
616.12s:  So that's actually two big wins for Eric because I had two great
620.08s:  Popular culture references for today so far
623.08s:  For those that don't know I don't know shit about pop culture. That's why it's topical
627.16s:  So Lauren back to you. I noticed you didn't respond yet
630.92s:  Why did you do it again? So you reiterated sell to clothes? Why is that?
635.80s:  There's a specific reason I can tell you exactly why and it's not because you're dumb you're not
639.96s:  It's not because you're not paying attention because I know you are
642.72s:  It is something to do with the way that you automatically are framing these things in your mind and it's super common
649.00s:  What you're doing is thinking of the trade or your treat you're thinking of the transactions from your standard
656.28s:  perspective and your standard perspective is buying options because I assume you don't sell options very much based on that response
663.96s:  Exactly so Lauren says because that's what I do the most that's exactly correct good
668.36s:  Nothing serious to take away from that
670.84s:  But the exercise that I just did there with her is something you all should be able to do with yourself
675.64s:  Which is positive
677.48s:  Attribution it's actually getting to the the root of why something is happening and being aware of it
683.64s:  That's how we can make adjustments going forward is through awareness. So nice job Lauren
689.72s:  All right next one
691.24s:  What is the most common method to settle an option super easy? We went over this
696.92s:  There's a statistic from oh, I see I'm actually pretty sure I shared it
701.64s:  Um
702.68s:  Yeah, this is just straight forward question
705.96s:  What's the most common method to settle an option?
709.96s:  And it's not what you hear a lot of
715.32s:  Clothes that's correct
717.48s:  Travel or stool is correct. I forgot we got to get our our fake internet points go in my bad
723.88s:  Wait, we're the rest of my fucking emojis hold on
728.36s:  This is terrible. Oh, there they are
730.84s:  All right, we got our fake internet points normally use a little trophy. Let's see if we can find something that's
737.96s:  I like the trophy
739.96s:  Is there oh
741.64s:  Goaded love that one
743.80s:  So travel or so gets plus one fake internet point congratulations
749.96s:  and
751.48s:  The answer is the majority are closed
754.52s:  The reason why that's super important is because most of the people on
760.60s:  Reddit in theta gang would lead you to believe that most options
765.08s:  expire worthless
766.92s:  And they use that as a rationale for selling options most of them expire worthless
771.64s:  You sell the options most of them expire worthless
774.20s:  That is logical the problem is is it's wrong. It's just not true
778.28s:  That's an issue. So the reason why I'm emphasizing quiz question number two is because this is tied to a really
785.32s:  common mental approach and validation for
789.32s:  Way methodology for trading that's just purely an accuracy is wrong
793.96s:  So most options do not expire worthless so that does not bolster the position of selling options as some sort of secret edge that somehow everybody knows about
803.80s:  But it's still a massive edge
806.20s:  so last question here what are the two big biggest differences between buying and selling
814.76s:  Options there's more than two technically, but there's two massive differences the most important ones as far as I'm concerned
823.80s:  So let's see if you guys can guess what those are
828.04s:  It's something we talk about a lot one were building trades
833.40s:  premium call
835.80s:  Capital obses premium that's not it why not says credit debit that's not it either it's think of the implications of that
844.44s:  Traveler's will says debit and credit again. That's okay. Oh, here we go
852.68s:  Okay, Reese has part of it
857.24s:  Pingo Elizabeth has the full answer
860.84s:  So at Elizabeth you get plus one fake internet point and since somebody made fun of my goat, which is a little
870.12s:  It's saddening to me because I really like the goat
873.24s:  I'm a let this is a point for
877.88s:  Elizabeth
879.48s:  But it's also a slight to be clear against Lauren, which is stop that bullshit respect the goat
887.80s:  So Elizabeth gets plus one fake internet point. That's exactly correct
891.88s:  the the most important differential between buying and selling options
898.68s:  Unequivocally is not the fact that there's credits and debits that is a big difference to be clear that you know
905.16s:  I already said that it's
907.88s:  There's multiple differences, but the biggest ones by far
911.40s:  Have everything to do with this risk reward graph
916.20s:  This is the zero line
918.44s:  So if we buy a call it's going to look like this
922.36s:  And
924.36s:  If we sell a put it's going to look like this
935.08s:  Now easy does it. I know everybody's going to start reading into the to the symbol
938.92s:  Just like they did with fucking Elon Musk. Everybody chill out. These are just two
943.64s:  risk reward profiles overlaid with one another the biggest difference to be aware of here is
950.76s:  The risk side of the equation
954.12s:  And the reward side of the equation
957.48s:  This is the biggest difference now there's a lot of nuanced differences between them
962.44s:  And we went over that in the last session
963.96s:  So we're not going to believe her those points
965.72s:  Well, the the reason why you have to be aware of this is because when we get into a further session
972.20s:  Where are we session number nine? We're going to talk about it before we get to number nine
976.36s:  But at session number nine where we're talking about how to build an options trade
981.00s:  This difference is one of the defining features that's going to naturally
986.36s:  Back you into different decisions great
991.40s:  Okay, so we ever quiz done
995.32s:  Let's talk real quick about what you saw in the last session
999.88s:  You saw the differences between buying and selling from a holistic perspective
1003.96s:  We looked at everything from how to open the trades how to close the trades how to settle the trades the risk profiles for the trades
1010.92s:  Understanding when we might want to buy when we might want to sell all of that was in the last session
1017.96s:  This is going to continue to just grow so that you have a quick recap of what we spoke about last time now
1024.04s:  Let's talk about the agenda for today. We are getting into
1028.04s:  Option pricing explained so we're at 17 minutes 10 seconds
1034.92s:  I'm updating our timestamps and this is what we're going to talk about today
1041.00s:  We're going to talk about the components of an options contract
1043.64s:  We're going to talk about what premium is you already know it premium is because we talked about that before
1048.28s:  We're going to talk about it again. We're going to talk about pricing models in pricing model inputs
1054.04s:  We're going to talk about bit-ask spreads
1055.72s:  We're going to talk about in order book and layering and then we're going to talk quickly
1060.52s:  About some of the actual implications of this stuff through the Greeks
1064.44s:  So your TLOs terminal learning objectives
1070.44s:  This is a really obnoxious military term whenever you do
1074.20s:  Well, especially for the Marine Corps. I don't know what other services call it
1077.56s:  Whenever you take a military course you have TLOs and ELOs TLOs terminal learning objectives are what you should know at the end of the session
1085.56s:  This is what you should know at the end of the session
1087.56s:  ELOs are enabling learning objectives those are the things we're going to learn along the way essentially these things
1094.60s:  So this is what you're going to walk away from the session with today as well as an understanding of these
1103.48s:  Common questions and misconceptions the questions you see here are
1110.60s:  First one, this is from a comment on the post I think this one is how do you quickly identify mispriced options great question
1119.32s:  Next one, this is from reddit, which is how do you use black sholes merton model to price options
1125.48s:  Next one after that is using option pricing models as a retail trader are they relevant?
1130.04s:  That's also from reddit and then the last one was a DM to me on reddit
1134.04s:  Which is which option pricing model is most optimal?
1137.32s:  So we're going to answer all of those by the end of this
1141.24s:  Okay
1142.36s:  Take a quick pause before we actually get kicked off with the material
1147.96s:  And see from you all in the chat right now
1151.64s:  If there are any other specific questions
1155.00s:  That you have the way that this question list works is by the end of the session
1161.56s:  You should have an answer to whatever the question is that you have that's why I'm tracking them here
1167.16s:  This is why they're literally for everybody to see
1170.52s:  So at the end of the session
1172.20s:  You will literally be able to answer everything that we input over here
1176.36s:  If there's anything else that you want to add if there's anything related to option pricing that you want to get an answer on
1183.32s:  Now's the time to bring it up if not and these questions are good we can continue on
1190.84s:  All right great
1192.84s:  So let's get started we are going to grab
1196.52s:  Our handy dandy notebook and no unlike the dude from blues clues. I'm not what what ended what drugs did he ended up doing
1206.68s:  Didn't he get kicked off the show for doing like a bunch of drugs?
1210.36s:  I can't remember what the drugs were
1214.68s:  But shout out to him we're not going to go that route
1218.60s:  We're going to grab our handy dandy notebook
1221.32s:  But and grab the notebook
1224.20s:  Believe that the drugs put those down
1227.48s:  notebook
1228.76s:  No drugs to be clear what we're doing here. Sorry to let everybody down
1234.20s:  So the first thing components of in options
1239.72s:  premium
1240.92s:  now I realized
1243.32s:  This actually is
1245.72s:  mis labeled
1248.44s:  This should be components of in options premium
1254.12s:  And the way that I typically would write this as inputs to
1259.00s:  And
1261.88s:  And the reason why I differentiate that way just for your context is
1266.44s:  The details of an options contract are the standard things that we quote when we're talking about an option right
1272.44s:  We talk about what the underlying symbol is what the days expiration are what the strike prices premium the type whether it's a caller put that kind of thing
1279.88s:  This is what we typically refer to when we're citing in options contract
1284.36s:  This is not the same as the primary inputs into a pricing model which are these elements here
1292.44s:  So the first input into a pricing model is the underlying price
1298.44s:  Why is this an input?
1302.04s:  Simple
1303.24s:  Because if I'm dealing with
1306.60s:  An option that's tied to an underlying that's worth five dollars
1311.16s:  It's going to have a completely different series of values than an option that's
1316.28s:  $500 let's take a look at this for a practical example together
1320.04s:  You're going to notice I'm going to do a lot of these where I'm going to take us into an options chain together
1325.88s:  So that you can see with me
1328.76s:  So let's start with Cisco. This is great because
1332.52s:  This is a $60 stock it's cheap
1335.32s:  Let's go to 28 days to expiration
1338.04s:  Let's go to the at the money's the 50 delta right now which is 62 and a half
1343.64s:  Let's see what these are worth dollar 73 by a dollar 90
1347.80s:  Okay, you don't have to know what that stuff means just yet
1350.52s:  That's just the price for this 62 and a half call that's 28 days to expiration. Let's go to meta
1357.24s:  I'm pretty sure meta is pretty expensive now in it
1360.12s:  Yeah, meta six six forty seven
1362.68s:  Let's take a look at the at the money the six fifties
1366.28s:  The six fifty call in the same expiration cycle is 29 85 and 30 10. What do you notice
1374.76s:  Way more expensive
1377.56s:  So the first input that's relevant to us
1381.64s:  Is the underlying itself and it's because the underlying itself will have different values that are important to us
1390.52s:  The next one is the type of option that we're looking at
1395.56s:  Is it a call or is it a put the reason why that matters is because the pricing relative to both of those is going to be slightly different which will explain later
1410.76s:  We also care if it is a US or American style option or European style option the reason why this matters
1421.16s:  Is because early exercise
1424.36s:  applies here does not apply here that impacts our pricing models
1430.28s:  Early exercise is a risk
1433.32s:  So this one doesn't have a risk that this one does that's why that matters
1439.24s:  The strike price which all of you are familiar with but when we pop open an option chain
1444.36s:  That's literally just the price that the contract is tied to
1449.56s:  That's essentially if you're talking about a house
1454.12s:  The contract price for the house is whatever the buyer and seller agree that the house is worth and they're gonna
1459.56s:  transact that that's that's what this is that's what the strike price is
1465.32s:  Next up
1467.88s:  We have days to expiration
1470.52s:  The reason why this is an input is because in option is a contract between two people
1478.12s:  The duration of the contract matters a lot
1482.52s:  Imagine if you were going to go to an insurance provider for a car
1488.04s:  And let's say that you were going to get a car and you needed to have you know
1492.76s:  Automobile insurance in order to be able to drive it around
1495.00s:  But you only needed insurance for two days just work with the example
1498.20s:  I know it doesn't work like that but work with the example here
1501.56s:  Do you think that the insurance that you would pay for two days
1506.36s:  Is more expensive or less expensive than insurance that would last a year
1513.32s:  Kind of straightforward. I imagine you probably know the answer
1516.92s:  But what's more expensive the two-day insurance or the one year insurance and I'm not talking on a relative basis
1524.60s:  I'm talking as at a gross dollar amount
1527.64s:  You
1530.52s:  Recess on it one year pretty simple why because it's a longer contract that's exactly why
1537.72s:  So
1538.76s:  Days to expiration is important because the length of the contract will impact the price associated with it
1547.80s:  The current risk-free rate
1551.24s:  The reason why the current risk-free rate isn't input to models is because
1557.56s:  It tells us
1559.64s:  What price we need to have integrated into the pricing model where a participant could go get that risk-free rate somewhere else
1568.52s:  So there needs to be a reason for us to trade an options contract which has additional risk
1576.28s:  If you don't integrate the risk-free rate and let's say that the pricing is completely off where you could get the risk-free rate
1583.64s:  Somewhere else for free and then an option happened to be cheaper on a relative basis
1588.28s:  Who wouldn't go for the risk-free rate? I would it's risk-free
1593.64s:  So the risk-free rate is a really important input into the model
1597.56s:  The next one is any dividend yield to the underlying
1603.32s:  The reason why yield is so important is because it impacts the stock price movement
1611.64s:  volatility
1612.84s:  It impacts the propensity for early assignment risk
1618.36s:  So the yield really is important from two different perspectives a call
1624.84s:  Has early assignment risk if you're short a call a short put doesn't have early assignment risk from a sales side perspective
1631.56s:  However, the short put has the risk on the market dropping after the dividend
1637.96s:  So both calls and puts are impacted by the dividend yield
1642.04s:  And then there's the last one that is in gold
1647.16s:  volatility
1648.92s:  The reason why
1650.92s:  volatility is in gold is
1653.32s:  Because when we look at a pricing model
1656.92s:  All of these things are known every single one of these details are known definitively
1663.32s:  It's not I'm taking a guess. I know them definitively
1667.00s:  I can look at the underlying and see what the price is the price for matter right now is 647 49
1673.48s:  I can see the price right now the type of option I can see
1678.44s:  If I'm talking about calls or puts I can see it right now
1682.76s:  If we look at the type of contract that it is US
1687.80s:  American versus European you can see those pretty simply by looking up the contracts
1692.20s:  The strike price we already talked about you can see that right in the middle there. There's your strike price
1697.80s:  I can see all of these things right now days to expiration
1702.36s:  That's the length of the contract if I move this over
1705.40s:  I can see the days to expiration the risk free rate
1710.12s:  You can look that up on any sort of platform that shows you bond prices or the sulfur rate or the library
1716.36s:  Depending on the duration of the contract that you're looking at the dividend yield
1721.16s:  This is also a known we can see this up here
1724.84s:  So the point is
1728.28s:  All of these are known right from the jump
1732.60s:  The only one that we don't know is this to be technically correct
1740.84s:  Is implied
1749.32s:  The reason why implied volatility is not known is why why is this one input
1758.20s:  Into the pricing model not known any guesses
1762.36s:  Why is implied volatility not known we know everything else here
1776.92s:  Why not known
1779.80s:  Talk to me
1782.20s:  Talk to me goose
1784.20s:  Can't predict future price
1786.36s:  You can predict but your point is well made
1791.80s:  implied volatility
1793.64s:  Deals with the future which is unknown we can predict it right we can come up with estimates based on where we think it's gonna go
1801.80s:  And we actually can predict pretty well
1805.24s:  But that part aside to why not specific point you can't predict what
1812.28s:  Meta is going to be next Wednesday
1815.64s:  We can have ideas, but we can't predict it that's
1819.64s:  Unknowable until next Wednesday we can come up with an expected range
1824.84s:  But remember
1826.60s:  implied volatility is just an expectation of price movement
1831.64s:  That's all it is
1833.32s:  So we do not know the implied volatility element of a pricing model
1839.48s:  This very very important point as we go through the rest of
1846.20s:  The session together
1847.80s:  So I will take a pause there where's my other little sheet my little croissant
1854.92s:  Input to an options premium
1857.72s:  Do you feel
1859.96s:  Comfortable with the inputs to an option price
1865.96s:  Based on what we just talked about those are the inputs to an option price
1875.88s:  I'm just updating our timestamps
1880.76s:  And 54 is good
1882.76s:  Capital ape says the standard deviation play a factor that's what implied volatility is tracking the standard deviation
1890.28s:  It's looking for deviation of future price
1897.64s:  Reese says
1899.64s:  So how do we arrive at
1903.40s:  Input or I'm sorry at implied volatility
1906.92s:  Which is a great question. We're going to talk about that more in a minute
1912.52s:  So good so far it seems okay cool
1916.04s:  Don't worry Reese we will get we will
1918.92s:  Touch on that when we get into the pricing model inputs specifically
1923.56s:  So to pivot now over to premium premium fortunately is really really simple
1930.60s:  premium is broken down into two buckets
1934.28s:  So let's do a little bit of drawing together
1938.04s:  We got a you know sometimes you like you just got to draw you just got to express yourself
1942.44s:  The funniest thing about all this drawings I really actually hate drawing. I don't like it at all
1947.64s:  So
1949.08s:  This is always entertaining to me
1951.32s:  But let's talk about the premium
1953.40s:  Of
1957.88s:  An option which is
1960.20s:  Spanish for the price
1964.52s:  There are two elements that equal the premium there's x-transic
1974.36s:  And intrinsic
1976.52s:  In
1981.56s:  intrinsic is simply
1985.32s:  The strikes relationship
1992.84s:  To price
1995.88s:  X-transic is made of volatility imply vol
2002.44s:  And time
2006.60s:  So one of the notes here is that there you go you can see the
2012.04s:  fly volatility there
2013.64s:  One of the notes here is that implied volatility lives within time
2020.68s:  There are two different things you can isolate them
2023.64s:  But the more time we have the more time implied volatility has to be volatility
2031.80s:  So
2033.80s:  implied volatility doesn't exist without time
2037.80s:  So what that means is if time is zero
2041.24s:  What does that mean
2043.24s:  It means that we're talking about a contract and I'm saying zero ad exploration
2048.20s:  I'm not saying like a zero dt that still is the rest of the day
2051.40s:  I'm talking ad exploration zero
2054.12s:  The reason why you need time for volatility is because we're talking about implied volatility
2060.44s:  It's forward looking
2063.24s:  If you are at time zero at exploration
2066.84s:  There is no more forward looking the contract is now expired
2070.92s:  It's all historic at this point none of that is forward looking the contract is gone
2077.64s:  So that's why implied volatility lives within time as soon as time is zero
2082.44s:  implied volatility is gone for that contract it needs time
2087.00s:  Now
2088.44s:  The relationship between strike and stock is relative to whether or not we're talking about a call or put
2099.96s:  So let's take a quick look at these
2103.00s:  I actually think it might be in this yeah here
2107.88s:  So we can take a look at calls versus puts
2112.76s:  The type of option
2114.44s:  And we can see that this gray I don't even know what color is that
2119.88s:  What color is this the shaded area it almost looks purple
2123.72s:  I have no idea what color to call that you're gonna have to help me out here
2127.00s:  This shaded area
2129.40s:  represents in the money for calls this shaded area
2133.08s:  Everybody says purple okay. Yeah, so we'll go purple albertos is violet albertos going
2139.32s:  Alberta is going real specific
2141.56s:  Which you guys will have to
2143.88s:  Confirmer to nigh if this is actually violet
2146.44s:  In the money for calls is simply when
2150.92s:  The stock price is above your strike
2155.24s:  Or puts it's the inverse the reason why moneyness matters
2160.76s:  Is because it impacts the probability of the option being in the money which impacts the overall value of that option
2170.12s:  Options that are expected to have intrinsic value are worth more than options without intrinsic value
2178.84s:  So super important point
2181.64s:  Okay, so now we take a pause with respect to premium
2189.48s:  And see if you have any question what questions do we have on
2194.76s:  on
2196.76s:  premium
2198.36s:  Of options. Do you understand?
2201.48s:  How it's broken down into intrinsic and extrinsic value and the differences between intrinsic and extrinsic value
2216.68s:  Do we feel good about this?
2220.28s:  Lauren says it's plum I think plum is let's see
2224.20s:  I don't know I feel like Lauren's bullshit me right now
2235.24s:  Yeah, I think Lauren is playing games. It's not fucking plum
2242.20s:  That's straight bullshit
2248.84s:  Unbelievable Lauren
2251.48s:  I thought that we actually had a decent relationship built on trust and respect
2257.48s:  And come to find out you straight up fucking lie to me about the color unbelievable
2263.32s:  Okay, so now we have a pretty good understanding of
2268.36s:  premium what premium is now we update our
2275.80s:  Time stamps now we're going to talk about pricing models
2278.36s:  So
2280.36s:  So pricing models as we go back to this
2284.52s:  We already know and we belabor the point
2287.08s:  All of this stuff is known except this so then the question becomes
2292.36s:  How do we get this where does this come from?
2296.12s:  I don't know if you guys have seen I was about to make a joke
2298.20s:  I feel like literally nobody would have gotten
2300.92s:  If you would have gotten this joke let me know
2304.44s:  But I was I was gonna say
2307.08s:  Where does this come from and then the joke was going to be but where do I come from
2312.12s:  And then the response to that is get a journal low again
2315.72s:  If you haven't seen those clips which I imagine is the majority of people
2319.64s:  You won't get that joke at all, but if you do you'll actually probably get a chuckle out of that
2324.52s:  But where does this come from? Let's take a look
2330.28s:  good
2332.20s:  Volatility
2336.36s:  So I actually have a video that talks about volatility
2343.08s:  In detail
2344.84s:  So I am going to
2347.88s:  Share that video with you here
2355.56s:  Right there so volatility
2362.44s:  Uh, we don't need to add it here
2365.24s:  Volatility is the only input that we're missing
2368.04s:  So that video goes through volatility in depth
2372.04s:  The way that we price an option
2374.92s:  Effectively is through pricing volatility
2380.20s:  There are a lot of different kinds of volatility
2385.48s:  And if you'll notice back on this
2387.88s:  We literally have an entire session about volatility by itself
2392.68s:  That's how important it is as an input to this entire thing that we do as options traders
2399.56s:  One of the things you are doing whether you realize it or not
2403.88s:  Every single time you are trading an option is you are expressing
2410.12s:  In opinion on volatility whether you mean to or not you are
2414.92s:  So you have to understand that because it changes the way that we frame and make decisions on position sizes
2424.20s:  Types of positions the way we structure our trades which will get into in a future session
2430.84s:  So
2432.04s:  Here
2433.40s:  We have forecast volatility
2436.92s:  forecast volatility is how we determine expected volatility
2443.64s:  And there are all different kinds of tools people use
2449.48s:  The entire world of forecast volatility
2453.80s:  Is where you see all of the advanced institutions market makers that's where they're all playing
2461.88s:  They're all trying to be the best
2465.32s:  At figuring out what volatility
2469.08s:  Should be priced at
2471.56s:  So the way that that works are people using all kinds of pricing models
2478.20s:  And it's not pricing models simple as black sholes
2484.28s:  We use black sholes merton model as a way to understand and simplify options
2491.72s:  However
2493.16s:  The world of pricing the volatility input itself is exceedingly complex
2499.16s:  And that's where you will come across different models like
2503.56s:  Garsh e garsh ej garsh
2506.36s:  Including jump diffusion
2508.52s:  The cliff notes version of forecast volatility is from a retail trading perspective
2514.52s:  You're not you're not going to use it
2517.00s:  You're not going to forecast volatility
2519.64s:  The reason why you're not going to forecast volatility more often than not you could do it as a scholastic
2524.92s:  Exercise right just to learn and to try it
2528.12s:  You're not going to price fall better
2530.20s:  Then all of these other entities that are then expressing these opinions in the market
2538.76s:  So when we're trying to figure out the price of an option
2542.20s:  This
2543.40s:  This is the biggest and most important input that exists
2550.04s:  If a implied volatility calculation is mispriced
2554.12s:  It can lead to significant opportunity
2557.40s:  For other traders to capitalize on that misprice valve
2561.08s:  The way that that can work from a theoretical perspective to give you an overview of
2565.08s:  What the fuck this means that i'm saying
2567.32s:  Let's say that we're not retail traders. Let's say that we're both
2572.52s:  Institutions let's say that we're both i-frequency traders
2577.64s:  If i'm a market maker and i'm providing these quotes on what i think this option is worth
2585.64s:  This quote literally just represents vol
2588.84s:  That's what when people are talking about
2592.52s:  Options in a technical perspective. We just refer to them as vals
2596.68s:  We talk about the volatility because none of this other ship matters. It's all known
2601.16s:  So the only thing we care about is the vals
2604.20s:  So we can take a look at something like this and we can determine
2609.08s:  What the current implied volatility being priced into the option is now a lot of platforms do it for you
2616.44s:  But that's primarily what we use the black shul's merton model for
2621.72s:  Is it allows us to use the differential equation
2625.88s:  To pull out the individual inputs and isolate the individual inputs so that we can see what this is
2635.24s:  So
2636.44s:  This 615 put right now is being priced at 41.75 all
2642.84s:  Now going back to the example
2644.84s:  You and i are both institutions were both high frequency trading firms
2649.72s:  And we see this being priced at 41.75 vol
2655.48s:  According to our model
2658.04s:  Which they're competing with one another
2660.44s:  According to our model which we've spent tons of time in rnd
2666.04s:  We literally have a fucking army of phd's that man the model and update it
2671.96s:  They come in and they say oh wow that 4175's way off
2676.28s:  That's super high compared to what our model says
2680.28s:  So then what do we do we come in and we sell this volatility
2685.72s:  That's the cool part about consensus driven markets
2690.76s:  Because there are so many really smart entities interacting here
2697.16s:  You're going to get a pretty good example of what volatility is priced at
2702.84s:  Because as soon as that one high frequency trading firm comes in and says that this is priced too high and they start selling it
2708.76s:  Then there's going to be others that will probably arrive at a similar conclusion and also sell it
2713.64s:  There's going to be a bunch of people selling it that's going to drive the price down
2717.00s:  Now there's a really good chance that one the market maker would catch on really really fast
2722.92s:  But two from a retail trading perspective
2726.28s:  You're not involved in this game. This is shit that's happening
2729.88s:  Way outside your purview especially as a beginner as an intermediate to advanced trader
2736.76s:  You can absolutely I've tried forecasting volatility just that curiosity and sometimes it's right
2743.40s:  But it rarely is anything worth the effort of trying to maintain a forecast model that actually would have enough edge
2753.64s:  Priced into it to be able to just isolate vol like that and then compete on this
2758.68s:  Space because the mispricings that we're talking about now are dramatized
2763.80s:  Just to make it easier to understand
2765.88s:  The mispricings that they might be looking for on the market. It's not even out to two decimal points
2771.08s:  It could be out to six decimal points
2773.32s:  And they would put the trade on at such scale and they can also more directly isolate volatility through hedging activities
2780.92s:  Because they have lower transaction costs that they can actually isolate this thing and put it on scale to take advantage of much much smaller
2789.80s:  Price discrepancies that
2792.28s:  We just don't have access to
2795.32s:  so
2797.32s:  All of these different pricing models that you see floating around
2801.72s:  binomial trees black sholes merton these are theoretical pricing models
2806.92s:  They're designed to help us
2808.92s:  Understand
2810.20s:  Options and they're used as simplifying functions in no way
2815.96s:  Are these the way that options are actually being priced
2821.72s:  in the context of volatility
2825.48s:  Because once we price volatility we can use something like black sholes merton
2831.32s:  Because we can adjust for some of the simplifying assumptions it makes with respect to
2836.84s:  This stock distribution and we can use log normal
2840.76s:  We can change those small inputs to make it pretty accurate, but pretty fast
2845.24s:  The thing about getting really accurate with stuff like this is that these kinds of pricing models are close enough
2852.84s:  Provided that the implied volatility calculation is very accurate
2858.04s:  So to use more advanced pricing models typically introduces latency
2863.72s:  pricing models use simplifying functions so that they're one consumable
2868.44s:  But two so that not consumable to be clear for you and I they don't give a fuck about you and I it's so that when they're programming them they're fast
2875.96s:  And this is typically good enough
2879.80s:  So the way to think about pricing is far as a retail trader
2884.92s:  Options are priced
2887.56s:  by institutions
2889.24s:  They're priced by institutions that are playing these games that I'm outlining for you here
2894.68s:  The pricing that we participate in is whether or not we think the current price is fine for whatever we're trading
2903.08s:  but to answer our first question
2907.64s:  From this is how do you quickly identify misprice options you fucking don't
2913.48s:  As a retail trader you absolutely do not you have no fucking idea
2918.20s:  And it's because this game is happening at a level that you don't even see
2922.60s:  So the game of identifying misprice options it's not for you
2927.80s:  There's going to be other entities that are much smarter faster well-equipped to do that actual thing
2934.76s:  You will not know if it's priced correctly or not because think of what this represents
2940.76s:  If you are able to identify a misprice option as a retail trader that means
2947.72s:  Every other active market participant missed it and didn't do anything about it
2954.20s:  Probably not going to happen
2956.20s:  So
2957.40s:  This one super simple you don't quickly identify it nor do you typically identify it much at all
2963.64s:  You've just taken opinion on what volatility might be or what you think volatility might be
2969.96s:  But to go as far as calling something mispriced
2973.88s:  Way off
2975.16s:  The other thing to keep in mind is that there's a really important relationship between puts and calls
2982.12s:  Called put call parity
2984.12s:  If put call parity parity is violated in any way
2988.44s:  There are high frequency trading algorithms that are hunting for that exact
2994.36s:  Scenario and the reason why they're hunting for that scenario is because there's an arbitrage opportunity
3000.12s:  Or there's different kind of positions that can be put on to even have a risk-free trade potentially
3005.56s:  So there's an arbitrage opportunity
3008.12s:  So
3009.32s:  That's again going to happen so fast you you literally won't even see it
3015.96s:  So there are structures that maintain the relationship between puts and calls from an efficient market perspective
3022.60s:  And then when it comes to the pricing of options we as retail traders
3026.20s:  We simply go through and we accept
3029.48s:  Whatever the market is pricing the volsad
3032.28s:  so right now
3034.28s:  For meta pricing the six 20s at 41.66 I take that as accurate
3041.56s:  I don't have a better estimate than vol on that and me running anything through a black sholes martin model doesn't fucking matter
3048.36s:  Unless I have a different volatility input
3051.80s:  So then the question is where do you get your volatility from we as retail traders we derive it from the market
3059.16s:  We take that's why it's called implied
3062.04s:  vol were implying it from the market
3066.20s:  But the input that's actually used in pricing models is called forecast
3071.08s:  vol
3071.88s:  That's when we decide what volatility should be in what we're going to price volatility act
3079.64s:  Okay, big big section
3083.24s:  So I'm going to take a pause there and I want to see how we feel about pricing models
3090.28s:  And pricing model inputs if we have questions we can do that now
3096.52s:  I'm just updating our timestamps quick
3108.68s:  Okay
3111.00s:  Let's see
3113.72s:  Any questions on what we just talked about
3116.44s:  Any questions about pricing models pricing model inputs
3123.64s:  Anything like that
3126.28s:  Why not says I'll get full off of the market crumbs that's the thing is just because volatility is priced
3132.52s:  correctly or accurately
3134.68s:  That's that's not the way that we're making our money
3137.80s:  the way to think about
3139.96s:  market pricing of options
3142.68s:  Is if options were mispriced or priced to rich or too cheap
3148.20s:  If that were the case then there's the ability to capitalize and to monetize that
3154.20s:  And that's where you hear of things like variance risk premiums
3157.64s:  Because we know an indices that volatility tends to be priced rich
3163.72s:  That's for a bunch of different reasons and there's literally a known phenomenon around that that people can monetize
3169.72s:  So that's one way to make money that's one profit mechanism
3175.40s:  As you will hear me refer to it as
3178.28s:  But just because there's not a bunch of mispricing and options for us to go around and try to trade all the time
3183.32s:  There's a bunch of other ways we can make money and options. It's that's just not our game
3191.24s:  Recess in retrospect can we say an option was mispriced
3197.32s:  I mean yeah
3199.32s:  But it doesn't really mean anything
3201.80s:  So the way that we would infer that an option was mispriced is if we price volatility and then something moves
3209.72s:  Either too far within that volatility band or too far outside of that volatility band
3215.24s:  But looking at it in retrospect doesn't really matter that much from an IV perspective
3221.40s:  But you can I think that's that's an okay to wait a phrase it
3225.16s:  But say it says what's the difference between IVR and IVX the fuck is IVX where's that from I don't know that one
3241.48s:  Any
3243.80s:  Re says if everything was priced perfectly, I wouldn't have any 100% winners. That's incorrect
3248.44s:  Again, you're you're focusing on the wrong thing
3251.08s:  Let me explain this because I can tell that this part's confusing people
3264.68s:  Okay, we have two scenarios
3269.88s:  I
3278.04s:  Give me one second looks like
3282.52s:  I ordered mel she really like salt so I ordered mel a bunch of there's this drink brand called element ELM and T or some shit like that
3293.24s:  and they just do like
3296.44s:  hydration stuff like
3299.24s:  Liquid IV and whatnot, but there's stuff like super it tastes like drinking fucking saltwater
3303.72s:  I have no idea how she could possibly like if at any way she was just talking to me about that
3308.12s:  scenario one
3309.72s:  We have a house
3313.48s:  Got two windows and then scenario two
3317.40s:  We also have a house this one also has two windows pretend that these are the same and that the windows both look good
3323.80s:  So house one this is priced at 100k
3328.76s:  House two
3331.56s:  Is priced at 80k
3334.04s:  Let's say that they are the same
3338.36s:  House one house two they're the same house in the same neighborhood
3342.12s:  They're the same these are just two alternate universes different dimensions
3346.84s:  And dimension two this was from an estate sale
3353.64s:  And this is just being sold on the normal market
3356.84s:  And let's say after five years
3362.20s:  The house is now worth 500k
3370.84s:  Just because this house wasn't quote-unquote mispriced
3377.56s:  Doesn't mean you can't still make tons of money
3381.64s:  The
3382.84s:  Differences the margin you make might look a little bit different
3389.48s:  So the way to think about options being priced
3393.00s:  Properly doesn't mean that you can't make money if you absolutely can make money
3399.24s:  It just means that you're not making money from an inaccurate or mispriced basis itself
3406.76s:  And again, I'm using an estate sale as the example for the mispricing here
3410.60s:  Everything else being the same
3412.68s:  You can still make money
3414.68s:  It's just priced appropriately
3417.72s:  So even though it's priced appropriately at 100,000 if it goes up to 500,000 you you make money
3423.08s:  The difference here is that if this is mispriced
3425.80s:  You might be able to make more money or you might be able to make money in a different way
3430.76s:  And it doesn't work well with the real estate example because you can't really arbitrage of this
3434.28s:  But in options you could arbitrage it
3436.76s:  So let's pretend that this is an options contract now
3439.24s:  Which I don't know why I drew that little face. It looks kind of funny
3441.88s:  Pretend this is an options contract now
3444.04s:  And if this was mispriced for whatever reason
3448.52s:  We actually don't want to trade it up to 500,000 anymore
3451.96s:  Because we actually think it's worth 100k
3454.76s:  This is the mispricing as far as we're concerned
3457.40s:  So what we want to do is isolate this difference through hedging activities
3462.60s:  To capture that differential
3464.44s:  That's all
3465.96s:  So the pricing of an option being priced correctly doesn't mean that you can't make money
3471.40s:  And it being reflective of priced correctly or incorrectly
3476.44s:  There are just different profit mechanisms
3479.00s:  Completely different profit mechanism
3481.24s:  So that's the that's the lesson there
3484.76s:  Let me pop the door for Thor real quick and we'll be back
3496.84s:  So because options are priced correctly
3500.92s:  It does not mean that you just get bread crumbs
3503.48s:  It does not mean that you have to be the peasant out in the market
3507.08s:  You have to be the peasant out in the market anyways because we're retail
3510.92s:  There's nothing to do with the pricing of options. They're completely different things
3514.92s:  So the way to think about the pricing of options is that they offer
3519.40s:  specific elements that can enhance things they offer a different profit mechanism
3524.20s:  But as I mentioned in the beginning
3526.04s:  You don't have access to that profit mechanism. It's just the reality of it
3532.84s:  Okay, let me get back to the questions
3535.56s:  We can spend literally as much time on this section the rest of these are going to be super fast
3540.20s:  And this is the the heart and soul of this session so feel free to throw literally anything you have
3545.88s:  At the the questions that's exactly what we should be talking about right now because this is the important element
3551.88s:  Okay
3554.04s:  Recess so making money comes from the risk assumed because it've gone another way
3558.92s:  Doesn't mean it was mispriced. Yeah, that's exactly correct
3562.76s:  Yep
3565.16s:  James says it's super confusing trying to figure out which IV to go by as it's different from different brokers
3572.36s:  um
3573.96s:  I don't imagine I don't know I don't look between brokers that much but I don't imagine imply volatility is going to be that different
3581.64s:  between most of them
3583.16s:  But if it is you could always just split the difference between the two assuming that they're not that different
3588.44s:  If there's a big difference somehow
3590.44s:  I would go to a third broker and then see which of the cluster between two out of three looks most correct to you
3598.12s:  And it also depends on what volatility they're providing to you
3601.32s:  There's implied volatility which the implied volatility should not be different
3604.68s:  The implied volatility is pulled directly from the option prices that are resting on the market
3609.48s:  If they have a theoretical volatility that's their own volatility calculation
3616.68s:  James says IV IVR IVX IV is implied volatility IVR is implied volatility rank completely different things
3624.92s:  IVX I'm really not sure what that is. I'm assuming that might be a newer thing. Let me see
3631.16s:  I'm wondering if that's like from TastyTrade's platform or something. I just I don't use that one
3639.40s:  Oh
3644.20s:  Oh
3646.20s:  It's so if I'm understanding what you're talking about correctly you're talking about the implied volatility index
3655.64s:  Is that correct
3659.88s:  Yeah, so it's from Tasty. Yeah, so I so implied volatility index is a slightly different thing
3665.32s:  But the the way to think about volatility and again, we have a whole session that will go through all of these different things
3672.12s:  And if you check out that video that I shared above
3675.48s:  it's literally
3678.60s:  It literally talks about all this stuff
3680.68s:  but implied volatility is a different function
3685.72s:  implied volatility tells us how volatile something is as a percent basis
3691.40s:  implied volatility rank or percentile take the implied volatility and they make it relative to itself
3700.84s:  So let's take a look see if we can find an example and share we can
3705.80s:  So right now meta has a 43% vol and a 73% implied volatility percentile and a 76% implied volatility rank
3717.96s:  I almost always use implied volatility percentile because it's much less prone to skew
3725.56s:  Which implied volatility rank is the way to think about these two implied volatility percentile and implied volatility rank
3732.76s:  They're very similar to one another they look to take this volatility and make it relative to the underlying
3739.40s:  Not just a gross amount
3741.88s:  So just let's remember these numbers implied volatility 43% and implied volatility percentile at 73%
3750.20s:  Let's just click through let's see if we can find something else
3756.92s:  Great example I knew it instincts right on fleek
3761.32s:  implied volatility in GameStop is 78.25
3765.80s:  So almost double what you saw in meta but take a look at the implied volatility percentile
3773.88s:  8%
3778.04s:  What's going on here? Why is this the case?
3782.12s:  There's a distinct reason
3784.12s:  So the implied volatility in GameStop is much higher
3788.92s:  But the implied volatility percentile and rank both are much lower
3794.12s:  Why is that the case? What does that tell you
3799.48s:  Uh, Rointiti says did you see my question? I did not feel free to dump it back in and we can circle back on it
3807.72s:  Rointiti says market cap that's not it. That's an okay guess
3811.08s:  Reese says gme is usually higher implied volatility
3815.08s:  Compared to meta. I think is what you meant
3818.04s:  And oh, I see you're talking about the same. Yeah, same same
3821.96s:  So what Reese is saying is correct
3824.76s:  What he's saying is that generally speaking GameStop has higher volatility than what it has right now
3832.36s:  Even though the volatility in GameStop is already double what it is in meta
3839.48s:  So that tells you that GameStop is more volatile of an underlying
3846.12s:  Think of this is another way of viewing beta
3849.16s:  If we view beta of the s and p 500 it's typically 1.0
3853.24s:  If you look at things that move around more you'll have beta of 1.3 1.5 2.3 you can have beta that's in excess of it
3861.56s:  This is a similar way of looking at that
3867.24s:  Um
3868.52s:  Rointiti says do option premiums have more volatility
3873.80s:  buyers and sellers at half in whole dollars like stocks do
3879.24s:  I think you're mixing a bunch of things here
3882.28s:  So if we look at
3885.72s:  The number of buyers and sellers which we would refer to as liquidity then absolutely I actually talk about that quite a lot
3894.60s:  So if we look at
3897.08s:  So if we look at
3900.60s:  The number of buyers and sellers which we would refer to as liquidity then absolutely I actually talk about that quite a lot
3908.92s:  Where if we look at the open interest and if we look at the volume
3913.56s:  For half strikes compared to whole strikes and even whole strikes compared to whole number whole strikes
3921.80s:  You will nearly
3923.88s:  Almost always see this
3929.48s:  Where the implied I'm sorry we're the open interest and the volume for those options is way more
3939.24s:  So it's way more liquid one using whole strikes as compared to half strikes
3945.00s:  The next factor to that is whole numbers
3948.52s:  So it's typically things that end in five there's zeros
3952.20s:  That will have more open interest than the surrounding options right example of that is here if you take a look at the 20s
3961.40s:  There's 2900 of them
3963.88s:  If you take a look at the 21s there's 23 so there's still more of the 20s
3968.04s:  Then if we look through all of these there's like nothing
3971.00s:  35 166 10 137 nothing until we get to this one
3975.40s:  That's 3600 what number do you think that is 25
3979.32s:  So normally zeros and fives will have the bulk of volume and open interest
3986.28s:  Now your inclusion of implied volatility in that statement is what makes it confusing
3991.96s:  Because the implied volatility is a completely separate factor
3995.40s:  And it has less to do with whether or not it's a half strike or a full strike
4000.44s:  And it has more to do with if it's closer to or further out of the money
4007.56s:  That's the difference here
4009.16s:  So the half strike whole strike whole number round number whatever
4014.44s:  For volatility has way more to do with where it is
4020.04s:  In terms of relationship to the underlying price
4023.16s:  So you'll notice that the tails of volatility tend to be priced higher
4028.68s:  Then the at the monies
4030.44s:  So if we take a look at this 20 data expiration we look at the 28s these are at the money
4035.40s:  The volatility on these is 68
4038.84s:  Then if we go super far in the money the implied volatility here is 261 percent
4045.24s:  Then if I go super far out of the money
4047.72s:  It's 150 percent
4050.44s:  Notice how much higher the tails are compared to the at the monies
4054.28s:  That's part of
4055.96s:  Option pricing which has a lot to do with expectation of in the money versus out of the money kind of keep it at a simple level
4065.08s:  Okay
4067.08s:  Next question from Amadeus
4069.96s:  If two same price stocks have the same iv in the same underlying price
4076.20s:  And similar liquidity will they be priced the same
4080.36s:  Or does their historical volatility and price performance come into play
4084.04s:  The historical volatility and price performance comes into play in forecasting volatility
4089.40s:  So if we're saying that they have the same implied volatility
4093.24s:  We're inherently saying they have the same historical price performance
4099.72s:  Because that's an important factor for forecasting future volatility is what something has done previously
4106.12s:  A great way to think about that and put it into into similar context is think of the weather today
4112.76s:  And think about what you expect in general the weather to be tomorrow
4118.52s:  Probably pretty close to whatever it was today
4122.52s:  So volatility very much functions the same volatility clusters
4129.48s:  And that's when it goes through its transition phases
4132.60s:  It tends to hang out for a little while once it hits an extreme
4136.20s:  And it'll stay there for a little bit called clustering
4138.76s:  So you can think of it similar to the weather in that contact
4142.36s:  So based on your example Amadeus
4145.56s:  By saying that they have the same iv
4148.84s:  You are inherently saying that their historical volatility and price performance is the same
4154.04s:  So it definitely does come into play that's how one of the major tools we use to forecast volatility
4162.28s:  Of Rointitis says maybe I'm asking wrong
4164.28s:  I mean if premium is at 35 cents are there psychological levels at 50 and one dollar and so on
4172.20s:  Oh, I see you mean for the actual premium itself
4176.60s:  Not really
4179.08s:  That's
4180.28s:  The the pricing of an option in that way is going to be determined by the market maker
4185.24s:  so
4186.36s:  That is
4187.56s:  much less
4188.68s:  done or as a
4190.28s:  factor of like human entries now there typically is a
4195.24s:  slight natural lean
4197.56s:  Versus some like I would prefer to sell something at 40 versus 39
4202.12s:  But I would rather sell something at 41 versus 40
4205.56s:  Right, so it's it's less so of just trying to be at an even number on the premium that it's just a matter of what's the better price relative to what you're trying to do
4214.52s:  You
4219.48s:  That's relative to the premium itself
4225.00s:  Great questions. I'm stoked. It feels like you guys are
4229.24s:  Feels like you guys are crushing this
4231.72s:  So let's talk this one's easy. Let's talk about that as spread
4237.80s:  So we're at 45
4240.20s:  bid ask spread and then we'll also do bid as spread in order books
4247.96s:  We don't really have to talk about layering. That's more of a hft thing
4252.04s:  So bid as spread
4254.76s:  Simply represents the current market offered or an option. That's all
4261.96s:  So the bid as spread are these two numbers you see the bid here the ask here the bid here the ask here for calls inputs
4269.40s:  The bid is the most somebody is willing to pay think of the people that do the
4274.84s:  I've got to do have a 40 and they they the auction people
4280.20s:  So the auction people essentially as they do that rambling which I think I just did a excellent job mirror
4286.44s:  and if I do say so myself
4288.12s:  They're essentially providing a market and the person when they raised their little thing
4294.44s:  They raised their
4295.64s:  They raised their thing
4298.44s:  And they have you know their their fancy hats on and shit
4305.48s:  When we
4307.40s:  Go through that kind of pricing is the same thing as the market
4311.32s:  There is a person that's sitting in a chair that says I will pay $10 for that item then the auctioner will say
4318.68s:  Well, do I have 12 and then they're going to try to find somebody to pay $12 and so on and so forth
4325.16s:  So the bid is the most somebody is willing to pay at this time the ask is the cheapest somebody is willing to sell
4332.04s:  Now the cool part about markets is you typically can get filled between these words the mid price
4339.16s:  And things that are liquid
4341.48s:  Meaning there's a lot of people transacting in there. They will have narrower bid ask spreads
4348.68s:  Bid ask spreads are super important
4353.56s:  Because they represent your ability to get into and out of something at a fair rate
4361.16s:  And we did a focus topic a while ago on how to calculate liquidity bid ask spreads
4368.68s:  And before you ask you already know I have a video on it
4372.12s:  So
4374.28s:  I will share this video that goes in depth on
4380.84s:  assessing option liquidity bid ask spreads all of those kinds of things
4386.28s:  but the
4388.28s:  The main takeaway is for you to know
4391.08s:  That there are two
4393.72s:  prices that you will see
4395.72s:  You typically can transact in between these prices
4399.40s:  These prices are typically set by market makers
4402.68s:  One of the games for market makers is they obviously have to make markets
4408.84s:  There's certain requirements
4410.84s:  For their quote book being turned on or the quote machine being turned on for certain durations of time in certain things
4420.04s:  And if they violate those rules then they can lose some of the benefits that they have as market makers
4427.96s:  The reason why that matters is because it impacts then
4433.24s:  What they might rest on the order book
4436.44s:  The reason why it might impact what they rest on the order book is because they still
4442.84s:  Have an entire inventory of stuff
4447.64s:  They have tons of positions on already
4450.44s:  So they might not want to take a whole bunch more of game stop at either of these on the buy side or sell side
4456.84s:  If they can avoid it
4458.44s:  So they might price them a little less aggressively or they might offer different sizes at that price
4467.80s:  So that's why you typically can transact towards the middle is because the fair price is generally
4474.92s:  Towards the middle now you can actually use something like the black sholes merton model
4481.80s:  To figure out what the price
4484.76s:  Should be
4486.52s:  Because right now this is telling you dollar 92 by 202
4491.24s:  What should it be well guess what you have an implied volatility input right here which is 6794
4499.48s:  So I actually have a tool I can tell you right now. I just got to grab my thing. I have a tool built in my
4505.96s:  Trade log
4507.72s:  That does this for me in two different ways
4510.20s:  It does it through the black sholes merton model to give me a theoretical price
4513.96s:  And then it also gives me a binomial tree
4516.60s:  I have like a couple different versions of the binomial tree, but it gives me the delta the gamma all that stuff
4522.44s:  So we can run through
4525.16s:  An input the ticker the underlying price the expiration the IV the
4532.84s:  The yield if there is one the current risk-free rate relative to the duration that you're looking at
4538.76s:  And you can figure out specifically what the call should be priced at what the put should be priced at that's called the theoretical price
4547.56s:  Travel ursil says is there an online calculator? I'm sure there is the the fact of the matter is
4554.52s:  Whatever the whatever the price is shown to you as
4560.28s:  Doesn't really matter that much in all honesty
4564.68s:  Because regardless of what the theoretical price is
4568.28s:  You still if you want to put the trade on are going to have to transact at the prices that they're showing you
4575.48s:  And the idea generally though is to try to transact towards the middle if we can that is
4582.20s:  much more preferable
4584.60s:  Then trying to transact obviously towards
4588.52s:  The bid or the offer we generally can do better than that
4593.16s:  So let me take a pause on bid-ass price
4596.36s:  I'm gonna take a second and see if
4599.16s:  What Mel wants for dinner
4603.16s:  And if you have any questions on this stuff perfect time throw it in and we can take a look
4617.88s:  Frank says do you have any tips for setting a stop loss on contracts that I have a wide bid-ass spread
4621.96s:  I feel hesitant to set one because I'm not maximizing gains
4624.68s:  Well, it depends on what the what the stop losses for
4628.20s:  So that one is a slightly different question. We can save time for the very end for those
4633.32s:  I just want to handle stuff right now that's more specific to this feel free to bring that back up
4637.72s:  Though at the very end and we can take a closer look
4641.88s:  Together, but in the meantime just so that I'm not leaving you hanging
4647.00s:  This video
4649.16s:  Goes into that on using stops
4652.60s:  We're going to be says I find they don't fill me often at the midpoint takes forever to get filled
4658.20s:  Yep, that's exactly correct
4659.80s:  And it depends on what you're trading if you're trading something that's less liquid or more volatile
4664.60s:  More volatility typically leads to less liquidity than you will find that exact thing
4669.40s:  If you're trading something that's super liquid you'll almost always transact at the mid
4674.12s:  So if you're trading stuff like game stop, which is notoriously volatile
4677.64s:  If you're trading smaller float stocks cheaper stocks that have less overall volume
4683.96s:  Then those tend to have wider bit us spreads the probability of being filled right in the middle is
4691.24s:  Yeah, not not very high, but that's just kind of normal
4703.96s:  Cool
4705.16s:  So I think we have one more thing on our agenda
4712.28s:  Which is the order book the Greeks will get into in a standalone session
4718.28s:  I'm actually going to make sure let me find that really fast
4722.52s:  Let's make sure that we have the Greeks as it's own we do
4726.20s:  So the Greeks will go into more in depth what I was going to talk about with the Greeks with respect to today
4733.16s:  Is simply that the fact that the Greeks help us understand how things are priced like that's that's pretty much it
4739.72s:  It gives us a little context on the pricing of what we're looking at
4744.20s:  You
4761.72s:  Warringtony says so when we buy and sell options
4764.84s:  We are basically negotiating with the market maker not the actual buyer sell that's correct
4768.92s:  The vast majority of instances the probability of you stumbling across
4773.40s:  Another retail trader that's looking to trade a single lot five lot ten lot like a small position
4779.40s:  And being able to line up with them at the right time at the right price and a gree on a price is very low
4785.64s:  So the market makers in that context they provide liquidity and they essentially say sure
4791.16s:  I'll sell this to you at the this price whatever that price is they'll take the inventory on
4796.60s:  They'll hold it until they have the ability to offload it to somebody else that wants the other side of the trade
4801.48s:  That's what they're trying to do
4803.16s:  But they in the process through providing liquidity is they will take on inventory
4809.48s:  Which is actually a great segue into a quick look at the actual order book
4814.60s:  And the order book there's different things level two data again
4818.36s:  This is the order book here for the underlying and then you can look at the actual order book
4823.40s:  For individual options if you're so inclined so we could take a look at the 28th year
4831.64s:  And you can see
4833.64s:  What the current sizes are
4836.28s:  What the current bids and offers are at those sizes. So this lets you take peak at
4843.88s:  What's what this specific option for example is being traded and offered at
4849.88s:  So the order books let you see what's in there and how much depth there is
4856.52s:  There's an entire world around trying to use the order book to make trading decisions
4861.56s:  Which can be done, but it's a little bit difficult the reason why it's a little bit difficult is because there's a lot of games that are played in the order book
4869.32s:  so
4871.56s:  I don't want to spend
4873.40s:  Too much time on that just because it's not it's not really that applicable
4879.08s:  To most people
4880.68s:  but
4881.56s:  most
4882.76s:  traders at some point will come across
4885.88s:  Somebody or some entity that says like yo i can show you how to trade the order book or something
4893.40s:  There's like a bunch of edge that you can extract out of here and the
4898.28s:  The summary of that is no that that's not what's happening
4901.96s:  There's not a ton of edge that you're going to extract out of the order book. I mean, that's just the reality
4907.48s:  so
4909.88s:  You can look at it. You can use it for context. You can use it for intraday trading decisions all of that is fine
4916.20s:  All of that is possible all of that is applicable
4919.00s:  But it's not like this this giant source of edge, you know being able to view the order
4924.68s:  Oh boy, there was a solo
4928.52s:  Richie scratch on the door
4933.40s:  Nuts
4934.92s:  All right, let's update this we're at 122
4940.52s:  20 30
4943.56s:  Q&A
4944.92s:  We'll talk about anything now anything that you want to hit anything that you're curious about
4949.64s:  Anything that we didn't fully cover
4953.16s:  We can talk about now
4955.40s:  Oh
4956.44s:  Rointitty says is order book the same as the tape no
4960.44s:  The tape is showing you what trades have occurred
4963.96s:  So the tape is something over here time and sales and the tape really refers to a much older thing
4971.32s:  Which is like the the things that are sliding on the screen of well when you're on the pits like on the floor
4977.08s:  They have these screens that show transactions that are happening so
4982.04s:  And it used to be like a physical tape but
4985.72s:  The the tape are transactions that have occurred so the equivalent of that would be TNS time and sales
4992.04s:  The order book are things that have not happened yet
4994.84s:  The order book are things that are resting so slightly different
4999.32s:  Darkmarks is what a type account do you recommend for a beginner options trader in regards to taxes liquidity as a maybe brokerage account
5006.52s:  Until things get to a certain predefined number than adjust then adjust to what
5013.00s:  What you mean willis
5016.52s:  And let me pop the door for Thor
5021.48s:  You
5031.72s:  Here he is he's ready
5034.28s:  I told him that he has to answer some questions. So where were you last night
5041.64s:  Nothing
5043.24s:  Very
5044.36s:  Very suspect
5046.84s:  Very suspect
5048.68s:  Why why won't you say where you were last night that doesn't make sense to me. What's your alibi
5055.40s:  Unsure what his alibi is you guys will have to let me know if it's legit or not but
5060.92s:  It seems it seems you see like he can't even look straight
5065.72s:  So I just don't know about this
5068.92s:  I'm trying to see dark marks dark marks says adjust as in start in account that may have more fees but better tax breaks IRAs and stuff
5082.12s:  Kind of different right like
5084.84s:  Your your IRA versus a standard brokerage account shouldn't have more fees. So I would call those different but
5093.72s:  The the simple answer to that question is literally just about everybody
5098.92s:  should absolutely whoa
5101.00s:  Jesus
5103.00s:  I'm trying to turn that down. It's like nuking my eyes just about everybody
5108.20s:  Should have a retirement account and having a Roth IRA
5114.20s:  And a traditional IRA typically makes sense
5118.28s:  Roth IRA you will get priced out at some point
5122.44s:  It will mean that your income means that you don't get
5126.28s:  a deduction from contributing your Roth IRA money which is
5132.20s:  Not the end of the world
5133.64s:  But there are other ways you can contribute to the IRA through what we call a backdoor contribution sounds illegal
5139.80s:  It's not completely fine
5141.64s:  But it's essentially when you input money into an IRA which again once you're at a certain income level
5147.40s:  It's not tax deductible you get no tax break from it
5149.96s:  But then you can put that as a larger dollar amount into a Roth IRA and trade that
5155.64s:  so
5156.84s:  to do
5159.00s:  GC says 7k I think GC you're talking about the
5163.72s:  maximum limits to contribute
5165.72s:  I'm talking about your income level and your ability to contribute
5170.84s:  What ends up happening is when you make too much money. It's not even that much money
5175.56s:  Once you get over a certain amount of money as your income they literally won't let you contribute which is
5182.04s:  Honestly also super annoying to be clear because it's like if you want people to retire
5187.16s:  Why the fuck are you penalizing people that save well, but I digress
5191.08s:  So let's take a look at Roth IRA income limit
5197.88s:  Here
5199.96s:  So
5201.40s:  You can see in 2024 the Roth IRA income limits are 146 for single filers or 230
5208.28s:  For married filing jointly
5211.48s:  So what that means is if you make over this amount of money you can't contribute to one
5215.64s:  Directly and there's no tax benefit to doing so and then let's take a look at
5221.72s:  Just regular IRA
5232.12s:  Yes, it looks the same. So if you're 230 or less you get a deduction of up to 7k
5238.60s:  Um, and then as soon as you're over 240 there's no deduction
5242.76s:  So essentially the money you put into an IRA
5246.68s:  From your income is taxed nominally, but then you can do a conversion from traditional into Roth. So
5255.64s:  slightly different
5258.12s:  Darkmark says I guess I'm asking can we trade options in certain retirement accounts the same way you can in a brokerage account
5263.48s:  Definitely. Yeah, you absolutely kind. I trade my IRA
5266.28s:  I also traded a 401k that I had from
5270.68s:  When I was working at the loit and stuff
5272.76s:  So yeah, you you definitely can it's some of it will depend on the IRA is easy
5278.68s:  Uh, it'll depend on where you open it. There are typically slightly different rules that they apply
5283.40s:  so that means that like
5285.24s:  You can't trade naked strategy so you have to keep your clothes on
5289.24s:  Um, which is
5291.24s:  Lying
5292.60s:  The other one is for your 401k's you can trade those as well depending on who your provider is and like what they're all about
5303.40s:  I also realize I have one like this which is pretty like at me dad center in the middle middle and big
5310.20s:  Cool, I'm very glad this is decent for Q&A
5316.20s:  eHodge says some 401k will not allow you to trade options. Yeah, that sounds right. It'll be based on whatever the plan is
5324.20s:  Um, it says how did your position in any go today after sharp rise it had today do you mean nne
5331.48s:  For n e e two different tickers
5336.12s:  So we have
5337.88s:  n e
5340.28s:  The key which I still have a position in
5343.48s:  And then n e e which
5346.52s:  Oh
5348.04s:  Looks like the streaming thing
5351.00s:  Hold on one second. I don't know if I'm still on other there it goes
5357.88s:  Uh, Mateus says n e e uh, I don't think I have anything in any e anymore
5365.88s:  Yeah, I don't have anything in that
5368.68s:  I have nne but not n e e
5375.24s:  So I have nothing that did anything. Yeah, uh, GCA says any just had earnings which it definitely did
5382.60s:  We were looking at this from an earnings play perspective
5388.68s:  Is the that like super blurry for you guys? Oh, no, that looks okay
5395.72s:  NBM
5398.84s:  NBM
5402.52s:  Uh, Trevor Ursula says can we talk about stock consolidation what it is what it looks like what not yeah for sure absolutely
5408.76s:  So thank you for bringing this up again during a stream because I remember if I'm not mistaken
5412.76s:  This is something that you brought up in the discord somewhere. I don't remember where but I remember seeing this before
5418.44s:  So let's talk about that one really quick because it's super easy
5421.72s:  so
5423.08s:  The way to think about consolidations is that
5426.12s:  consolidations are
5428.84s:  Just a form of price action. That's it now. I can tell that you're
5435.56s:  You're incorrectly assigning
5438.36s:  consolidation to break out
5440.36s:  There's a relationship between them, but it's not an inherent relationship a breakout is a very specific
5447.80s:  Uh profit mechanism that has very specific signals that has very specific behaviors
5453.00s:  Underline conditions. There is a relationship between consolidations and breakouts
5457.96s:  But it's not consolidations and breakouts automatically are tied together. There's more to the equation than that
5463.80s:  Let's talk about consolidation consolidation and really anything else related to
5470.68s:  Actually sorry one sec. I just want to update the stuff that we've talked about in the q amp a little log
5476.04s:  We talked about retirement accounts
5478.28s:  I
5482.28s:  Have to get better at updating this thing
5486.36s:  Um, we talked about
5493.32s:  I think that's the main thing
5495.96s:  Yeah, okay cool. So we talked about that and then we now are talking about
5501.24s:  consolidation
5503.88s:  Cool
5504.84s:  So for consolidation. It's really simple. It's relative to the time frame just about
5510.52s:  everything that we've looked at so far
5514.36s:  when
5517.00s:  We're trading options or analyzing and underlying it's highly relative to the time frame
5523.48s:  So if I zoom this out to a three-year daily
5526.68s:  I can find periods where the stock was consolidating
5531.16s:  Consolidation is just a generally sideways range bound price action
5537.48s:  So a consolidation would be something like this here
5541.32s:  So this range from here to here
5546.68s:  This area is consolidation. It's when an underlying is bouncing between a range
5553.72s:  And generally it will be flat
5557.32s:  Now the caveat is it's highly
5563.40s:  highly relative
5565.56s:  To the time frame you're looking at
5569.32s:  So if we switch this to a five-minute daily
5575.24s:  This is a consolidation on a five-minute time frame this much smaller range right here
5581.72s:  And then this is a breakdown out of the consolidation
5585.00s:  And then this is a rally back up into another consolidation
5588.36s:  Which is a consolidating in between this level
5591.40s:  So on and so forth
5594.28s:  So the way to think about consolidation is just sideways trending price action
5599.24s:  It tends to be when we're accumulating
5603.40s:  People that are transacting at a specific level keeping it within a range
5607.40s:  But it's highly relative to the time frame
5609.80s:  You can have things like this that on a five-minute fit on a five-day 15-minute chart is consolidating
5616.68s:  But then if we zoom this out to a 30-day
5619.72s:  We can see that it was actually moving in that time frame was going up
5623.32s:  But then if we zoom out further from a 30-day time frame
5626.12s:  This is not consolidating. It's going down. This is consolidation here
5630.36s:  But then it's going down
5631.72s:  So if I'm looking at a 30-day four-hour chart and then I go out to a six-month
5635.48s:  Well, that's not really consolidating much. It's still going down
5639.40s:  So it's relative to the time frame, but consolidation simply is generally sideways price action
5646.44s:  Now when it comes to breakouts, that's a whole other bag
5649.64s:  Breakouts have a lot to do with underlying conditions
5654.28s:  Meaning specific earnings criteria that have been met specific relationship to prior earnings
5660.68s:  specific fundamental conditions that set something up
5664.92s:  That when it does breakout of a consolidation phase it tends to be a stronger move kind of like what we saw here
5674.20s:  This was consolidating it did try to break out. This is a false breakout
5678.20s:  Because the consolidation area really is from here
5682.44s:  To here
5683.88s:  So I tried to pop out here didn't work consolidated consolidated consolidated try to break out to the upside
5689.32s:  Then got shot down broke out to the downside
5692.28s:  also break out to the downside then it finally broke out to the upside through here
5697.56s:  so
5698.84s:  The conditions though that lead to the subsequent breakout is a very specific profit mechanism pretty pretty different
5707.32s:  All right gang. I got me in 90 minutes in it's about time for me to go grab my dinner sitting here
5712.20s:  If you guys have anything else feel free to hit me up in the discord happy to catch up tomorrow
5716.68s:  We have the gm e stream
5718.76s:  Sunday we have
5720.76s:  the
5721.72s:  Market prep probably for the pro members and then we'll keep on keeping on from there
5726.60s:  So our your homework almost forgot your homework
5730.76s:  For the session today about option pricing model is to build your own
5737.08s:  Black sholes merton pricing model in excel
5739.96s:  If you have no idea how to do that
5744.36s:  Use chat gpt. It can tell you exactly how to do that. It's very very simple
5749.56s:  Black sholes merton model. It sounds more
5752.68s:  Overwhelming than it is which is why that is your homework
5756.36s:  So for those that are doing the homework you can post it in the discord
5762.92s:  There's a section in the learning lab. There's a thread
5766.68s:  That is the beginner workshop
5772.20s:  Here
5774.20s:  And this is exactly
5777.16s:  Where I'll grab the link to it. I'll tag everybody in the discord really quick
5783.56s:  At everyone
5789.00s:  Here you can post your homework
5794.28s:  from the not our options trading
5798.20s:  basics
5801.16s:  So I just tagged everybody there so that you can
5806.68s:  Drop your homework in there for any review from people
5810.60s:  GCA says what do we call all type it in here. So homework
5816.68s:  build your own black
5820.28s:  goals
5821.80s:  Merton model in excel or google
5825.88s:  There we go
5829.88s:  And
5831.88s:  Be careful
5833.88s:  What you type in
5836.12s:  Because bdsm is not far off
5842.12s:  Homework is and I'm putting it in the timestamp as well homework is build your own
5848.12s:  Black sholes
5850.12s:  Merton model in excel or sheets
5854.20s:  Use chat gpt for help as needed
5859.40s:  And post the results in the discord
5866.36s:  And to
5868.68s:  Wait, we don't really have to standardize it
5872.04s:  Now I'm not going to standardize it you can use whatever underlying you like
5875.88s:  I don't I want you to be able to look at the stuff that
5879.80s:  That you feel like looking at so that's the gameplay
5884.36s:  All right gang, I'm off for tonight. If you need anything hit you boy up
5888.76s:  Be an outlier. See you later
