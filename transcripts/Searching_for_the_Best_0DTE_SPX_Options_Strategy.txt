0.04s: let's talk about the best zero DTE
3.12s: options trading strategy do you know
5.64s: what it is my guess is you probably
7.68s: don't because I don't either the fact is
10.28s: nobody knows there's not enough time in
12.64s: zero DTE to have a definitive answer but
15.32s: we have some pretty good ideas on what's
17.20s: working so far so the goal of this video
19.00s: is to walk you through some of the
20.36s: research I've been doing from my data
22.84s: set as well as my actual trading data
25.84s: and talk you through what I'm seeing
28.44s: that's working and what's not working
30.04s: and then most importantly I want to give
31.92s: you some ideas on how you can apply a
34.92s: similar methodology to figure out an
36.88s: approach for yourself that might work
38.56s: really well for you and your trading
40.88s: book based on your specific needs what's
43.92s: up everyone Eric here welcome back to
45.48s: the outliers shout out to the patreon
47.20s: family consider signing up for weekly
49.08s: workshops on this exact kind of stuff
51.96s: and let's dig right in okay so what's
54.20s: the profit mechanism for these trades
56.76s: well it's variance risk Premia and if
59.60s: you're unfamiliar with that concept I'll
61.40s: throw a link in the description below
64.00s: that goes through it in detail but to
65.56s: summarize it simply put it's the
68.24s: propensity for implied volatility to
70.08s: track above historic volatility which
72.76s: means that we're pricing options more
75.20s: richly than what they're ending up
77.04s: moving and we can make money off of that
79.68s: and because of that that's why I
81.16s: actually prefer sell style strategies
84.12s: for these time frames so things like
85.72s: short straddles strangles primarily
87.80s: strangles which you'll see in a little
89.16s: bit now let's get a quick visual on
92.72s: variance risk premum and essentially
95.76s: these yellow lines are implied
97.24s: volatility the white lines are historic
99.68s: volatility and we make money when the
102.52s: yellow line is above the white line and
105.24s: when the white line crosses above the
107.00s: yellow line those are typically periods
108.68s: that we would have a losing trade that
110.72s: means that in these instances the
113.16s: Market's priced in a lower implied
115.60s: volatility which we would have sold then
119.00s: accounted for the overall movement which
121.84s: was much larger than that implied
124.84s: volatility so let's take a look then at
128.16s: some of the structures that I found to
130.44s: work now this is kind of a cliffnotes
132.36s: version if we want a really in-depth
134.44s: version I can share something like that
136.08s: it would be a long video because to
139.08s: summarize I've traded these and tracked
142.32s: them both live since launch and I have a
146.16s: massive data set where I have
147.88s: essentially looked at different
149.40s: permutation down to single Delta
151.56s: variances and 5 minute entry windows and
155.48s: I want to share some of the high levels
158.08s: or the highlights of that at a high
160.56s: level for you so this is looking back
163.76s: around the launch of daily expirations
166.68s: in SPX and there's a couple reasons why
169.56s: I prefer SPX for this tax advantages is
172.20s: a big one but also sizing so I don't
174.76s: have to put on as many positions so I
177.32s: can decrease the number of transactions
179.56s: I have have to make because it's very
181.52s: expensive I have a video that dives into
183.44s: the world of zero DTE with a bunch of
185.72s: different studies in depth I'll also
187.52s: throw that in the description but
189.84s: Traders don't fully appreciate how
191.96s: expensive it is to trade zero DTE and
194.44s: it's because the transaction costs are
196.56s: kind of hidden from you it's on the back
197.88s: end not the commissions you're paying up
199.76s: front it's the fills that you get the
201.76s: markets you have exposure to and the
203.80s: slippage on entries so it's really
206.56s: important to consider that we want to
207.92s: decrease how much we're interacting with
209.48s: this stuff
210.52s: the other thing that I've noticed that's
212.16s: not in this video but if you're
213.68s: interested I can bake it into a future
215.88s: video is a targeted frequency to entry
219.08s: so what we're going to review today are
221.16s: more of a systematic approach that looks
222.96s: at a broader data set so that we can
224.68s: make informed decisions using as much
226.48s: data as possible but what I have found
229.52s: is we know that volatility tends to
231.52s: Cluster right so if you notice this
233.44s: period right here that crossed above the
235.72s: implied volatility uh historic
237.96s: volatility crossed above implied this
239.92s: was on 22 February then on 23 February
242.76s: it was also above and then it came back
244.56s: down so there was a 2-day period there
246.84s: in this case it crossed above on the
248.64s: 13th stayed up for the 14th and then it
250.88s: came back Below on the 15th we'll kind
253.84s: of right even with it so what I'm
256.16s: highlighting is that you can actually
257.76s: apply a little bit of a momentum factor
260.12s: to deciding when you choose to enter as
262.00s: compared to just mechanically entering
263.80s: but you don't have to do that that's
265.52s: kind of the beauty of this stuff because
267.12s: again if we look at this in the
268.80s: aggregate it's kind of like like dollar
270.16s: cost averaging more often than not
274.00s: implied is above historic so you can get
277.84s: more specific with it like I like to
280.28s: mostly because I'm a nerd about this
281.88s: stuff but a general rule that's
283.84s: applicable is it's normally there until
286.12s: it's not and then it generally comes
288.20s: back pretty quickly that being variance
291.08s: risk premum so let's take a look at a
293.88s: couple trade examples here we have
296.20s: different Deltas for short calls long
299.36s: calls short puts long puts these are all
301.88s: one lots for ease and the times of Entry
305.40s: are in Eastern Standard Time so this is
307.32s: 0935 right after the open and again
310.16s: we're looking at from when zero dte's
312.24s: daily expirations were launched until
314.68s: the 4th of June 2024 so we're not
318.00s: applying any profit or loss protocols
321.52s: and let's take a look at what we see up
324.08s: front right out of the gate I noticed
326.20s: that the 15 Deltas definitely perform
328.84s: stronger than everything by quite a lot
331.08s: I also noticed that if you add wings to
333.44s: things it helps and doesn't help what
336.04s: that means is it helps for straddles
340.16s: which have persistently underperformed
343.20s: so it makes sense that it would decrease
345.48s: the loss profile of those so you can see
347.80s: our Max loss goes from essentially 12
349.64s: Grand down to six that helps this a lot
352.64s: however for something like the 15 Delta
356.32s: short strangle which if you're not fully
358.80s: sure what that looks like
360.52s: like essentially we would come in here
362.84s: we would find the option closest to a 15
364.92s: Delta on the put side so in this case
366.48s: there's a 16 Delta and then there's a 17
369.08s: Delta right here so we would sell those
371.68s: now this is one DTE that's only because
373.88s: the Market's closed right now so the
375.32s: zero DTE have expired there's no premium
377.72s: in them just so you know why I'm looking
378.92s: at a one but I just want to show you
380.72s: what the structure looks like which is
382.12s: this right here so a couple things to
384.96s: keep in mind as we look at this it has
387.52s: nice big profit zones which is great but
389.88s: you'll notice a kind of Nefarious
392.00s: component to this if you look at the
393.76s: purple line the unrealized loss before
398.24s: expiration at this point right at your
400.32s: break even isga ,200 bucks but you
403.92s: actually would make two bucks if you
405.88s: held it and essentially time decayed out
408.52s: and it stayed right there that matters a
410.48s: lot the reason why it matters a lot is
411.92s: as we look at applying management
414.20s: protocols you have to be careful about
416.40s: stopping yourself out too early so a
419.28s: couple other things to note here the
423.08s: super small Deltas specifically the
425.08s: fives they seem to outperform the 10
428.28s: Deltas ever so slightly and it looks
430.44s: like that primarily derives from reduced
434.12s: Max losses and a pretty high premium on
437.64s: the win rate so notice there's a five
440.00s: Delta variance between these but the win
442.56s: rate is pretty meaningful as compared to
445.44s: if you look at the variance between the
446.88s: 10 and 15 and the difference between the
449.60s: win rates there so the five Deltas have
452.84s: a little bit of an edge for the win rate
456.00s: however they're just not collecting that
457.56s: much which is why they don't perform
458.80s: well so next if you're looking at data
461.88s: sets like this one of the first things
463.12s: we should be eyeballing is okay where
465.04s: the extremes and we found the extremes
468.00s: pretty simply right it's these losses
469.76s: they're massive compared to the average
472.12s: wins or even the max wins on all of them
475.76s: so if I'm building a strategy the first
477.88s: thing I want to do is look at a really
479.04s: big data set then I want to start seeing
481.92s: what themes I can find and Tinker
484.04s: managing those and see what it does and
486.04s: then we need to segment the data set to
487.68s: make sure that we're not overfitting too
489.36s: much because right now we're looking at
491.16s: all historic data whatever we see in
493.56s: these tests is not going to be what
495.76s: happens in the future so what we need to
498.08s: see is how much does our management
500.96s: approach impact the performance of the
503.92s: strategies and the robustness we don't
506.00s: want to see a bunch of variant
508.00s: year-over-year
509.56s: because then that means that we're
510.92s: getting to a point where we're grossly
512.20s: overfitting and when we go to out of
514.60s: sample data set meaning going forward
518.12s: your performance will probably change
520.40s: drastically from what you back tested so
522.48s: we're looking for robustness here now
524.88s: this idea of cutting off the tails is
526.44s: nothing novel I'll actually throw
528.56s: another video in the description below
530.52s: that talks about this exact process and
533.00s: what I'm doing is looking for extremes
534.64s: so in this case I tinkered with a bunch
538.20s: of different stop loss losses and 200%
541.24s: tends to work generally well across time
544.04s: frames again without grossly overfitting
546.52s: so in this case this is essentially a
548.08s: three times credit received loss and
551.16s: let's take a look at what happens across
552.68s: the entire data set first thing that
554.12s: jumps out at me is everything performs
556.60s: better across the board that matters
559.68s: quite a lot even down to the straddles
563.20s: with the five Delta Wings they still
565.48s: lose but it's a little bit less than
567.56s: over here the fact that this
570.40s: positively impacts everything across the
572.52s: board to varying degrees it tells me
574.64s: that we're on the right track in terms
576.08s: of what adjustments we're applying now
578.28s: Cliff Notes if we looked through the
581.60s: difference that it makes for these
583.20s: different strategies pay attention as we
585.20s: look at some of the different
586.12s: permutations going forward but right now
589.20s: at this point the 10 Deltas have grossly
592.24s: grossly outperformed the fives as
594.08s: compared to what we saw earlier why is
595.84s: that because we're controlling the Tails
598.36s: so what this is telling telling us is
599.88s: that if we looked at each trade in the
601.52s: data data sample that there are a
603.72s: handful of extremes that were greatly
606.76s: skewing our overall performance and what
609.44s: we cut those out specifically to the
612.08s: downside all of a sudden this has become
614.96s: a really high performing strategy the 10
617.84s: and the 15 Deltas so now let's take a
620.92s: look at another thing which is the time
622.48s: of Entry again I look at essentially 5
625.32s: minute increments throughout every
627.08s: single day but I'm giving you a slightly
630.72s: a bridged version for ease of following
634.08s: and I want you to notice a couple things
635.96s: we look across this data set what do you
637.80s: see the first thing I notice again is
640.80s: that everything across the board
644.04s: performs way better way better so this
648.80s: tells me again that we're on the right
651.36s: path and you can Tinker with all
652.88s: different kind of time entries but I
655.72s: noticed that the afternoon within a few
657.48s: hours of the close performs very very
659.56s: well so what do we see Happening Here
662.68s: well interestingly enough our straddles
666.24s: now are the top performing strategy so
668.84s: what's that what that's telling me is at
670.28s: the beginning of the day the volatility
673.04s: that are being priced into the straddles
674.44s: aren't enough to keep up with the
675.72s: movement throughout the day but towards
677.20s: the end of the day it's obviously pretty
679.96s: lucrative which is a very interesting
681.76s: find in my opinion so let's move this
685.32s: over one more and I want to show you the
688.88s: next logical look which is combining the
692.80s: later dat entry with the stops and what
695.48s: do we see well we see a couple things
697.48s: one the profitability on most of them
701.40s: actually comes
703.00s: down why would that be because in this
707.12s: case we're managing a lot of the
709.20s: volatility by time when you layer on
712.72s: something else on top of that in this
714.60s: case stops what's happening is
717.36s: throughout the end of the day you're
719.00s: getting getting stopped out on way too
721.00s: many trades that actually come back in
723.32s: to become winners so what this tells me
725.92s: is this stop is actually probably too
728.80s: tight so we can look at actually
731.64s: expanding the stop loss from 200% out to
735.64s: 300% and again notice what happens here
739.20s: we see a total expansion across the
742.72s: board because now we're not prematurely
745.72s: stopping ourselves out for trades that
748.72s: end up coming back in to be winning
751.44s: positions so the last thing I want to
753.76s: highlight is zooming in on this sample
756.76s: now where we're entering at 2 p.m.
759.28s: eastern time exiting at 300% Max Credit
763.88s: received and I guess it's Max loss um on
768.32s: the credit received but looking at this
770.76s: year-over-year I want to look for
772.76s: robustness and one of the things I'm
774.60s: looking for is how crazily do things
777.36s: tend to flip and it's kind of a really
781.40s: important thing to consider right so
783.60s: this is a partial year this is 2022 the
785.76s: second half of the Year this is all 2023
787.92s: and then this is 2024 notice what at
791.32s: least I see is if I look at the
794.28s: performance of the stradal it
796.16s: essentially flip-flops almost
797.92s: tremendously so we have it being top
800.36s: performer to being second to worst and
802.92s: the worst with the wing and then back
805.04s: towards the top so far this year and if
807.64s: I look at kind of the solid performance
809.80s: across the board it's the 15 and the 10
813.76s: Delta short strangles so you have to
816.44s: figure out what's right for you a couple
818.08s: things to consider though are for me I
821.88s: vary size based on how much I can
825.08s: quantify the risk Premia and what looks
827.64s: more attractive I've also started
829.84s: instituting a intraday volatility
832.24s: sampling to help me forecast what it
834.36s: might be throughout the rest of the day
835.76s: and that also uses kind of that moving
837.60s: average uh thesis I was talking to you
840.20s: about a little bit earlier if there's a
842.20s: big Catalyst sometimes it's worth
844.76s: downsizing because you're going to
846.28s: collect more premium anyways because of
848.64s: the implied volatility being so elevated
851.16s: and the last thing is I've started
853.40s: instituting a Delta rebalancing protocol
856.44s: in another sample of this trade it's way
858.88s: too early to really derive anything from
861.08s: that but so far that also looks
863.12s: promising so what's the best strategy in
865.96s: my opinion it would be either short
869.24s: premium via short straddles or short
872.16s: strangles you can modify the risk
874.92s: protocols based on what you want it's a
876.64s: little too early to see but for me and
879.52s: what I'm looking to expose myself to
882.88s: it's primarily looking more like short
885.20s: strangles although they slightly
887.20s: underperform there's much less
889.44s: year-over-year volatility in the
891.32s: performance of the strategy so we'll see
893.48s: let me know what you think in the
895.04s: comments below be an outlier I'll see
897.04s: youall later
