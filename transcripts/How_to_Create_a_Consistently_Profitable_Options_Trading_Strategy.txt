0.24s: do you have a defined process for
2.44s: creating an option strategy do you even
5.28s: know where to start the goal of this
7.12s: video is to walk you through end to end
9.76s: and then to give you an example on what
11.76s: this can look like in a simple scenario
14.32s: but the punchline is if you're going to
16.08s: trade for hopefully a long time you have
19.32s: got to define a process for this while
22.00s: strategies are different and they vary
23.76s: based on circumstances the process to
26.40s: create one is not that different and we
28.88s: can define a well thought out process
31.68s: that we can multiply and apply in a
34.84s: bunch of different scenarios so that
36.80s: this isn't a painful thing that we're
39.20s: forgetting pieces because we're just
41.68s: kind of cobbling it together as we go
43.88s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
45.48s: back to the outliers shout out to the
47.00s: patreon let's get right in so don't be
49.04s: this guy that's kind of the starting
50.68s: point so you can see we have a person
52.80s: here that they put on a trade and
55.88s: they're asking a Reddit Community should
58.52s: I hold on to expiration what's the
60.48s: problem here the trade's on like we are
62.64s: a day late dollar short you should
64.80s: already know what you're doing before
66.44s: you put the trade on don't be this guy
68.36s: this guy says I sold a put 5'11 expires
71.48s: today it's trading below but now it's
73.44s: above why didn't I get assigned so
75.96s: clearly they don't even understand the
79.64s: risk that they're taking with the
81.00s: strategy that they put on because again
83.20s: they didn't build a strategy they just
84.52s: put a trade on and they're hoping that
86.36s: it works out okay I think that Point's
88.24s: been made so how does this work as you
90.64s: could tell we have kind of 11 broad
93.04s: steps here we're going to run through
94.16s: all of them pretty quickly here's the
95.88s: thing one of the most common mistakes I
99.24s: see new Traders make when it comes to
101.16s: building a strategy is they pick a
103.92s: structure and then they just start
106.40s: trying to Cobble together a strategy
108.64s: around the structure the difference
110.28s: between a structure and option structure
111.96s: is a short call Long put those are
114.00s: structures it's an iron Condor it's just
116.44s: a configuration of options a strategy is
119.52s: how you use that configuration what
122.36s: rules are applied so the idea of saying
125.76s: I sell puts is superus because sometimes
129.72s: it might make sense to sell puts and
131.40s: other times it might not there's no
132.92s: reason to be a put seller there's a good
135.16s: reason to be a Trader and trade what
137.84s: makes sense so as we go through this
139.68s: process you'll see the very first step
141.64s: here is pretty clear Define a purpose
143.88s: what are we trying to do notice how this
145.80s: isn't pick a structure we need to figure
147.96s: out what it is we're trying to
149.32s: accomplish so what is the goal of this
152.20s: strategy are we trying to trade a
154.40s: bullish thesis directionally up are we
157.48s: trying to trade a bearish thesis when
159.20s: something's going down are we trying to
160.64s: trade volatility are we trying to
162.84s: develop something that allows us to have
165.32s: short beta weighted spy Deltas you got
168.12s: to start with what we're even looking
169.76s: for here then once you do that we should
174.04s: outline what the money making mechanism
177.40s: is this is a core competency in trading
181.40s: that shockingly a lot of people have a
183.56s: giant Gap I have a video that talks
185.88s: about this a bit more I'll throw in the
187.40s: notes below but here's what this comes
189.40s: down to a vertical doesn't make money a
192.04s: long stock share doesn't make money long
195.64s: options don't make money they need a
198.44s: condition to occur to make money so the
201.44s: idea here is we're trying to identify
204.56s: the conditions that lead to making money
207.68s: so is that you're going to TR things
210.20s: directionally to the upside okay that's
212.32s: a condition we know if we buy low and
214.52s: sell High we make money we know that
216.60s: there's risk Premia in SPX options for
220.04s: example that is a money-making mechanism
222.32s: you have to Define what this thing is
226.20s: and then how it makes money so from here
229.20s: we move on to then determining what
232.04s: structures make sense so based on if
234.64s: we're trying to trade a bullish thesis
237.72s: where if something is going up we want
239.56s: to Trad it to the upside directionally
241.52s: what structures make sense for that list
244.36s: them out and I would start from simplest
246.96s: and move to more complex so for example
249.16s: if we want to trade something that we
250.84s: think is going to go up you can buy
252.32s: shares that's the simplest then maybe
254.36s: you can buy a call then sell a put so on
256.52s: and so forth you can list out these
258.32s: different structures that work in this
259.68s: scenario this is going to help us later
261.96s: then we need to create a basic rule set
265.08s: So based on this idea of we want to
267.48s: trade something directionally to the
269.00s: upside what are the rules that we want
270.80s: to apply on entering the trade exiting
274.00s: the trade and then how long are we
275.64s: looking to hold these trades again if
277.44s: you trade options guess what you don't
279.28s: have the luxury of just picking a
281.52s: Direction all options have an expiration
284.04s: so not only do you need to pick a
285.48s: direction you also need to understand
287.36s: the severity how much it's going to move
289.16s: or have an idea on that and then you
290.80s: also need to have a Time bound component
292.76s: this is actually why options aren't
294.12s: always the right answer it adds a lot of
296.36s: complexity that may not need to be there
298.84s: but in any case these are kind of just
300.84s: three basic rules that you can start
303.44s: with to develop a strategy So based on
306.72s: this rule set I would then test those
309.28s: rules with a few things in mind the
311.84s: first one is I would start with a very
313.44s: big sample I would use the largest
315.72s: sample I could find so for example if
318.04s: I'm trying to trade something in the SPX
320.48s: that goes all the way back to the 20s I
322.32s: will literally run a test from the 20s
324.16s: until the nearest data I have does that
326.28s: mean I'm going to treade all that data
327.64s: the same no but that doesn't mean that
330.28s: I'm not going to acknowledge it because
332.04s: it's so far gone old data still is
334.88s: relevance so when I look at how do I
337.96s: then make this make more sense I segment
340.72s: the data so let's say I'm back testing
343.56s: 10-year period I'll run a 10-year back
345.92s: test then I'll run two five-year back
348.96s: tests then I'll do five 2year back tests
352.76s: then I'll do 10 one-ear back tests why
355.48s: do I do that because this helps me see
357.76s: the path of the strategy stry so for
360.64s: example you can have something like this
362.48s: in tle Q's where let's say you were just
364.84s: buying tle Qs and if you just test this
367.76s: broad data like Wow you went from 36
370.04s: Cents to $59 that's a great return
372.36s: that's perfect meanwhile at one point
374.36s: you were all the way up at $92 and it
376.96s: fell all the way down to $16 that's the
380.40s: path of something so you might have
383.04s: something that has a crazy good return
385.20s: but then once you analyze it closer you
386.80s: might realize like okay this actually
388.20s: has like a 98% % draw down am I going to
391.24s: hold for that is that viable are there
393.56s: rules I can apply during that draw down
395.76s: that make it easier who knows but you
398.04s: have to be aware of the path that your
400.88s: returns take then from here we start
403.80s: identifying more closely out of those
405.84s: different structures that worked what
408.00s: are the best for our use case so an
410.76s: example of this is let's say that you
412.32s: want to trade directionally and you
414.88s: actually want to use leverage well that
417.12s: right out of the gate will probably get
418.72s: us away from using long shares so you
421.40s: can apply kind of selection criteria
423.92s: like that and once you finish doing so
426.20s: we now codify it in its current form
429.72s: you're going to be taking a bunch of
431.36s: guesses some of them might be good some
433.28s: of them might not be good that's okay
434.84s: that's part of the process but what we
436.56s: need to do is track them so we use
438.64s: things like strategy outlines and
440.36s: trading logs and specifically for the
443.64s: patreon members the outlier Pro folks
445.80s: you have free access to the shop that I
448.32s: have so you can download templates for
450.32s: both of those from there and if you
452.04s: aren't in the patreon that's okay you
454.24s: can check out this video in the notes
455.84s: below that walks through an outline on
458.28s: how to create a strategy so that you can
460.32s: make your own without that but the point
463.24s: being is unequivocally you need to
465.24s: Define what you're doing and then you
467.28s: need to track how that goes this is how
469.36s: we objectively see what works by
472.64s: repeatedly testing and changing specific
475.44s: variables so that we understand their
477.44s: effect and then we can optimize them now
479.76s: you have to be careful between
481.64s: overfitting but in general if you're
484.56s: using a large sample than a segmented
487.16s: sample and then you're even getting into
488.84s: this next step where we're going to back
490.32s: test and forward test again you're going
492.04s: to limit that inherently so we want
494.40s: things that are robust we want things
497.08s: that hold true in large samples and then
499.44s: also generally hold true in the smaller
501.40s: samples as much as possible or at least
504.12s: have observable patterns that we can
506.60s: then calculate different approaches off
509.28s: of
510.00s: so once we get through this cursory back
512.16s: test I think of it like working down a
513.92s: funnel I want to start with the biggest
515.76s: funnel and then get more and more
517.52s: specific because you get more specific
519.12s: it takes more time to analyze these
521.40s: things so this next stage of back
523.76s: testing forward testing it's not super
525.72s: time consuming but it gives us a chance
528.00s: to take a look at the rule set now you
529.80s: might be thinking how do we even back
531.80s: test this stuff there's different ways
533.60s: you can do that you can either jump in a
535.68s: platform I'm a affiliate of two of them
538.20s: o rats and options Omega they're both in
540.60s: the links below for discount codes but
542.84s: that's if you don't want to get your own
544.16s: data but you are completely capable of
547.08s: getting your own data from sibo and you
549.32s: can either run back tests in something
551.32s: like python it's up to you how you want
553.96s: to back test if you don't want to do any
555.76s: of that you could consider doing
557.52s: something like on demand in think or
559.24s: Swim which is free but the thing is is
561.60s: people feel like this data should just
563.40s: be available to them and it's not right
566.60s: like think about if you're a
567.80s: professional athlete you need stuff to
570.20s: do your job and as a professional
572.12s: athlete you're not necessarily paying
573.56s: for that stuff but somebody does it's
575.72s: not free it doesn't just fall out of the
577.48s: sky somebody still has to buy the stuff
579.16s: that they use it's the same thing here
581.04s: but in this case as a sole proprietor
582.68s: you're by yourself you have to buy it
584.32s: you have to procure it so I wouldn't
586.16s: come into this thinking that you're
587.20s: going to be able to just get fantastic
588.96s: data easily for free it's just not
591.52s: reasonable so then you can also paper
594.52s: trade with different variations I do
596.64s: this anyways but this is also free but
599.48s: it takes time you only get to paper
601.36s: trade what the markets show you and for
603.64s: example I started trading in 2007 from
606.32s: 2007 till now 2024 there's only been
609.16s: three bare markets and two of those have
611.56s: been in the last four years what that
613.64s: means is if you just paper Trad this
615.76s: you're really getting a skewed view of
618.56s: the path something takes so I really
621.84s: believe in paper trading I do it with
623.64s: live strategies kind of actually in this
626.28s: sustained optimization stage as well but
628.92s: this stage page here step nine is when
631.12s: we're actually trading it exactly as we
634.12s: think we would and at the same time we
637.00s: have different variations that we're
638.80s: also paper trading so I kind of segment
640.80s: this into two buckets I have the paper
642.80s: trading I'm doing to simulate my actual
644.76s: account and then I have the paper
645.88s: trading I'm doing to collect data so the
648.32s: way I do that is the stuff I'm using to
650.00s: collect data I'll put on tons of
651.68s: different trades thousands of them and
653.56s: track them right I'm creating a data set
655.36s: I'm not worried about actually doing
657.20s: that exactly as I would but in the
659.48s: trading account that I'm testing as if
661.76s: it were live I'm going to size things
663.96s: exactly as I would I'm going to manage
665.52s: them exactly as I would because it gives
667.56s: me the best view of how this actually
670.20s: would work then we have our live test is
672.80s: when you start using real money none of
674.72s: this testing is ever going to be the
676.76s: same as using live Capital that's all
678.36s: there is to it but the idea is we want
679.92s: to make as many mistakes as we can and
682.08s: get as much Headway as we can before
684.76s: we're throwing Capital at things I know
686.72s: for the impatient people I was in the
688.44s: beginning this seems really painful and
690.64s: a waste of time but the fact of the
692.28s: matter is is you are far more likely to
694.20s: lose money than make it as a Trader so
696.56s: by not losing money unnecessarily and
698.96s: setting your account back further than
700.40s: it needs to go you're actually moving
702.80s: faster in terms of compounding your
704.88s: Capital so going slow up front actually
707.76s: will get you a speedier result in the
709.72s: long run so what does this actually look
711.68s: like I kind of outlined what this in
714.80s: large steps goes down like and here's
718.12s: kind of a quick flow so in number one
721.00s: here I'm saying I need long beta
723.24s: weighted spy Deltas so that means I need
725.20s: something that goes up when the s&p500
727.44s: goes up this can be whatever you want
729.12s: this could be you need negative beta
731.32s: weighted spy Deltas so that you have
733.00s: some uncorrelated or non-correlated
735.20s: returns you could also say that I need
737.16s: non-correlated returns to the S&P 5
739.16s: whatever it is whatever the use case is
740.96s: that you need for your portfolio in this
743.88s: stage here what I recommend to Traders
746.48s: is have a specific use case in mind
749.24s: don't just think about building
750.64s: strategies for the sake of it think
752.12s: about what the market does the market
753.52s: goes up I need a strategy for that
755.52s: things go down I need a strategy for
757.56s: that if I trade volatility I need a
759.76s: strategy to trade volatility when it
761.36s: goes up down sideways so as I look
763.64s: across the toolkit you can start to see
765.72s: that you don't need 35 different
767.44s: strategies you kind of just need a
768.76s: handful because you be need to be able
770.68s: to trade directionally up down you need
772.88s: to be able to trade volatility up down
775.16s: maybe there's a couple risk premum
776.72s: strategies in there momentum premum
778.28s: strategies in there news announcement
780.00s: strategies in there stuff like that but
782.00s: they're not all unique the way that I
783.92s: trade earnings is the very similar to
785.72s: the way that I trade fomc meetings I'm
787.72s: using the same structures just modifying
789.68s: them slightly so really think about how
792.48s: many strategies you need and what for we
794.80s: shouldn't just have a laundry list of
796.44s: stuff then I go through the rest of
798.68s: these stages to codify what I'm doing
801.08s: now getting down to kind of testing
803.92s: things this is from using Python and the
807.64s: cool part about this is it lets you test
810.68s: simple thesis and if you wanted to test
812.84s: something like options it starts to get
814.36s: a little more complex you have to
815.84s: calculate them yourselves or by historic
818.20s: data so maybe if that's too prohibitive
820.48s: for you you actually just see maybe a
823.32s: directional assumption and then you can
825.20s: use logic to reason through the rest for
827.24s: example let's say that you don't have
828.96s: data to back test and you wanted to
831.08s: understand which one would make you more
832.60s: money let's say that's one of the
833.68s: questions you have would it be long
835.68s: stock or long options well if you put
838.44s: the same amount of money in both and you
840.52s: get the move in your favor you're going
841.68s: to make money with long options so you
843.92s: can also reason through some of this if
846.60s: you don't have access to the data when I
849.40s: start pairing down these different
851.88s: choices I think about the structures
854.72s: because is a long call the same thing as
857.48s: a short put no long calls have defined
861.08s: risk they have undefined profit
863.20s: potential so if the thesis that I'm
865.20s: trying to trade is directional momentum
869.20s: meaning I want it to move a lot would I
871.20s: prefer a long call or a short put
874.24s: probably the long call that's a better
876.16s: fit for that thesis a directional
879.04s: momentum trade if you trade a short put
880.92s: in that scenario it could still make
882.80s: money but you have a defined risk right
885.52s: at or defined profit right out of the
887.40s: gate and undefined risk so by
890.48s: understanding the qualities of the
891.72s: options you can then use that to further
893.56s: narrow down what best fits again what
896.80s: money-making mechanism you are trying to
899.08s: capitalize on then we go down to these
902.60s: last steps we're going to test multiple
905.52s: variations we're going to use something
907.12s: like this a strategy outline to document
910.16s: what we think we're going to do and then
912.00s: we iterate on this process a good
914.48s: example of this iteration and I'll throw
916.72s: a link in the notes below that talks
918.68s: about this exact thing where for zero
920.60s: DTE and even earnings for a long time I
923.36s: favored straddles made more money but
926.08s: with the markets over the last four
927.52s: years or so I've actually started moving
929.24s: to strangles more frequently because I
930.88s: need the Delta offset based on how the
932.72s: markets are behaving so how did I come
934.52s: to that conclusion by this down here by
937.36s: continually to optimize what I'm doing
939.28s: because if I just used the original
941.08s: analysis that I did and stopped I
943.12s: probably would actually be losing money
944.44s: on some of those as compared to making
945.84s: money you have to continue to adapt your
948.32s: strategies to what the markets are doing
