0.00s: Three reasons options traders lose money. I'm going to walk you through one by one and then I'm also going to
4.96s: attach it to what you can do to overcome the problem. Now, I'm not going to go into my usual
11.04s: spiel of planning or having a trading planner or trading log. Although I will throw videos to those
17.12s: in the notes below, I think that is an absolute necessity. I'm even talking about the first order
23.04s: hurdles that these people run through that they're unable to overcome to even start making money
28.08s: let alone optimize it and become super successful. I want to be super clear trading options is
33.28s: difficult, but it's not insurmountable. It really is a doable prospect, but the problem is a lot
38.96s: of people approach it with the wrong mindset. So we're going to talk about that right now. And before
42.88s: we get into that, a shout out to the Patreon members. Thank you guys so much for the support. And
47.28s: let's get straight into the video. The very first one is going to be no surprise to anybody. It's
51.20s: the yellow traders. These are the folks that are looking for a lottery. These are the people that you see
55.92s: on Wall Street bets. And they're looking for those really crazy asymmetric payouts. They're going to
60.32s: have very low wind rates with a high expected payout. This is typically a negatively expecting
68.56s: strategy. It's just as if you were to go to the lottery store or to the gas station and buy
73.36s: a lot of tickets. It's the same exact thing. So the problem with this is people want an out. They want
79.76s: the idea or the potential to win regardless of how small it actually is, but they don't want to
85.44s: put in the effort to build strategies to actually create success. It gives them an out. They have the
90.48s: ability to try to make some money, but they're not putting in any effort. And then if they lose,
94.56s: well, it's no skin off their back. They don't really care because it was just a lot of, they didn't
97.92s: really care. And that creates this really insane cycle where we're literally just throwing money away.
103.28s: Want to be clear, you can actually have asymmetric risk strategies. You can have strategies that
108.40s: have really big payouts, low wind rates, but are still positively expecting. It still just requires
113.36s: a little bit of effort to get there. And most people don't want to do that. So this is exactly what we see.
117.44s: Now, when we're thinking about the way we can overcome these lottery trades, like I said,
122.32s: scaling into strategies, again, you can be aggressive, but they have positive expectancy. You're
128.24s: scaling into successful strategies as compared to not even bothering to create a strategy. And then
133.60s: you're wondering why you're just bleeding money. Then next one is the Greeks, the evil Greeks,
138.24s: the reasons why everything happens in the markets, right? No, not right. When we're talking about the
142.88s: Greeks, we're talking about Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, Ro, and then even the second order Greeks,
147.28s: well, technically, third order Greeks, charm, things like that. Vanna, but when we're talking about
151.92s: the Greeks, it's important to kind of clarify things. The Greeks measure stuff. They don't do
157.36s: anything. So when people say, oh, Theta's killing me. Oh, whatever's killing me, Theta is just a
162.80s: measure of, I'm decay. I'm decay is killing you. Now, when we're talking about, though, kind of
167.92s: this idea of the Greeks, the Greeks in and of themselves, there's nothing wrong with them. Theta
172.64s: isn't a problem. Theta is the boogie man for long options traders, but there's nothing wrong with
178.16s: Theta because Theta gives you exposure to long gamma, which is actually good. The issue is people
183.76s: don't understand how options work to figure out the correct balance for their dispositions.
190.00s: This is not the Greeks problem. It's your problem. It's your lack of understanding of how options
196.00s: work. So how do we overcome this? Well, there's a couple things. The first thing is I'm actually going
200.48s: to throw a video in the notes below on an introduction to options that goes through all of the Greeks
206.88s: and how they impact your options, which is a really important concept. But let's talk at a few
211.20s: other things. The first one is I want you to take a look at your strategies and identify how each
217.60s: Greek impacts your strategy. So if you are long an option and you're long gamma, that's part of your
225.12s: strategies risk profile. If you're long an option, what's happening with Theta? What happens with
230.72s: Vega? And it's not just going to be whether you're longer short, it's going to depend on other things.
234.64s: Like what is the delta of your option? How far out in time is your option? Those sorts of things.
240.40s: Do that for all of the Greeks. Once you understand how the changes in the Greeks impact your position
245.60s: or your strategy, the next thing we need to take a look at is what impacts those Greeks. So if we
250.48s: know that we're long gamma, what does that even mean? What happens? What what makes gamma move?
255.52s: You've got to be able to answer those questions so that you can actually create strategies that work
260.08s: because going back to this. Most of the lotdos that we see out there are super short days to
264.88s: expiration far out of the money options. It is no wonder why they don't work. That is an awful
271.36s: structure. Those kinds of trades have really awful risk profiles. They're expensive. All sorts of
277.20s: things make them unattractive. And if you go through this exercise, you'll start to see some of
281.68s: that. And then the second thing for kind of overcoming this, placing on holes. I think too many times
286.72s: traders, they're looking at what makes a strategy great. Why does the strategy seem so awesome for
291.60s: them? And they're not looking what's the problem with this strategy. Where's the risk in this strategy?
296.40s: That's what we need to be focusing on when we're looking at the Greeks in relation to an option
301.28s: strategy and how we're trading in general. We're not trying to essentially trick ourselves into
306.40s: thinking that this is perfect and everything's going to be okay. We need to identify where the risk is
311.28s: so that we can work around it. Identify what we need to do to manage the risk to create a successful
316.48s: strategy. Next, the good old 99.9% repeating win rate. I hate these. And it's because what happens
323.76s: if we have an astronomically high win rate? Can anybody answer that question? And if you can't,
328.64s: your average win size is going to be pretty fucking small. So the problem with this is this is an
334.16s: ego trade. Traders don't like to lose. Look up the disposition effect. This is a super commonly
341.44s: studied trader behavior where traders will allow loser trades to grow and get bigger because they
348.00s: don't want to realize the loss, but they cut winners super short instead of letting them move
352.88s: because we like the experience of a winning trade that's the disposition effect. That's what this
357.44s: is. So whenever you see these insane win rates, you can immediately throw this out as a grossly
363.36s: inexperienced trader or strategy because a sophisticated options trader is focused on
369.92s: positive expectancy, not win rate. So what's the fix here? Focus on positive expectancy, not win rate.
378.64s: And if you're not sure what positive expectancy is, don't worry. I got you. I will throw a link in
383.52s: the notes below so you can check that out as well. The last thing that I want to talk about is kind
387.68s: of a trickier one. So I think it bears mentioning. And this is where retail traders want to try
393.28s: to do what institutions do. This is where you're going to see the retail traders that want to scowl
398.24s: or they're trying different strategies that they think are successful from the institution side.
404.00s: A couple of things. It's a good mindset. Your mind is in the right place because typically we want
408.48s: to try and emulate people or entities that are successful at what we're trying to do. That's good.
413.44s: The problem in this instance is that the worlds between retail trader and institutions are vastly
420.16s: different. That's the tricky part. So I think it's good to absorb some of the approach of institutions.
426.56s: Having very clear risk profiles, having well thought out strategies, testing things, all of those
432.00s: sorts of things are great to integrate into a retail trader strategy. The reason why I bring this
436.24s: one up as an addition at the end is because it's really nefarious because there is a structural gap
442.56s: between the two. You will never have the resources that institutions have. You will never have the
448.32s: commission or cost structure that institutions have. So whenever retail traders are trading,
454.40s: there's a lot of friction, meaning that there's a lot of cost associated and it's not relegated to
459.36s: just the commissions you see. It's things like bid-ask spread slippage, so on and so forth. The
463.84s: institution side doesn't deal with a lot of that or the ways to circumnavigate it, aka block trades
469.12s: for giant orders. They have specific ways to circumnavigate a lot of that stuff. That's not to say
473.84s: that retail traders don't have any advantages. We actually do have some, but the point being is if
478.48s: you try to emulate exactly what institutions are doing, it's not going to work for you as a retail
482.64s: trader. So that's not the right way to focus your energy. And if you're curious about the differences
486.32s: between the two, you guessed it. I have a video that I will throw in the notes below that talks about
490.08s: the difference between Wall Street and retail traders because it's important to understand that
493.84s: difference. So let me know what I missed. If you liked, please like the video, subscribe, share with
498.08s: some friends. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
