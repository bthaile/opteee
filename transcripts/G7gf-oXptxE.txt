0.00s: So we use the Black Sholes Merton model when we're pricing options.
5.40s: You've heard that before, all good.
8.16s: Now once we understand options a little bit more, we come to find out that all of the
12.64s: assumptions in the BSM are not exactly correct.
17.44s: One of which is how it integrates implied volatility into the pricing of options, primarily
24.12s: how it assumes implied volatility.
27.08s: So this video is going to talk about the implied volatility surface and the implied volatility
33.84s: smile so that anybody that trades options that's interested in the inner working can have
39.76s: a better understanding on how premiums are actually calculated because they're not
45.36s: calculated in a textbook fashion as the Black Sholes model would assume.
51.48s: So what's up everybody?
52.96s: Eric here.
53.96s: Welcome back to all the outliers.
55.76s: And again, we have a little more of a technical session here, but I aim to make this video
60.72s: consumable.
61.92s: We're going to keep it to less than 10 minutes, but I'm hoping to share some useful information
66.00s: so that you can understand the under side of options a little more holistically.
70.88s: So let's jump over and get to it.
73.28s: So as I already mentioned, the Black Sholes Merton model, it comes with a whole list of assumptions
80.00s: and not all of them are accurate.
82.84s: One of which is the pricing of an underlying security and the reason why that matters is
89.84s: because it impacts how implied volatility is assumed to be.
94.84s: So when we're talking about the BSM, it normally assumes a log normal distribution, which in
103.24s: this scenario, I'm specifically referring to the cumulative distribution of a log normal
108.00s: distribution.
109.16s: I mentioned that because a log normal distribution can look very different depending on what level
115.12s: of statistics you've taken and how often you use this stuff.
119.28s: So really when I'm saying log normal or normal distribution in this context, I'm referring
126.08s: to the cumulative distribution of a log normal distribution.
129.64s: Okay, so got it.
131.56s: I just said the same couple of words a few times.
134.24s: What the hell does it mean?
135.48s: Let's talk about it.
136.56s: So down below, right below those words, I have what a cumulative distribution of a log normal
143.36s: distribution can look like.
144.96s: And what you're seeing here is also what is commonly referred to as a normal distribution,
150.72s: where we have the mean in the middle and then we have symmetrical tails to both positive
158.04s: and negative sides of the mean.
161.52s: However, this is not how price is actually observed in the marketplace.
167.76s: And because that is not how price is actually observed in the marketplace, that is also
172.68s: not how implied volatility is calculated.
177.08s: Because again, implied volatility is essentially just our assessment of future price movement
184.60s: and deviation off of a mean.
187.00s: So when we talk about options, implied volatility and price, they both do not exhibit a normal
195.36s: distribution.
196.76s: They have both either or or both kurtosis and skew.
202.20s: So what is kurtosis and what is skew?
206.04s: Essentially both kurtosis and skew lead to fat tails in our data.
213.64s: And I don't know about you, but nothing gets me going like a good ol fat tail in statistics.
221.60s: But on the left hand side here, I'm showing you two things.
224.12s: I'm showing you what kurtosis looks like and then I'm showing you what skew looks
227.96s: like.
228.96s: So kurtosis, which is this bit up here, we have three different kinds.
232.88s: This is in the statistics course.
234.24s: I'm not going to go into all of them.
236.00s: The punchline here is as we see different styles of kurtosis, an important function
242.80s: is occurring.
243.92s: The tails represent the far ends of the data set.
249.44s: And typically speaking, as you can see over here, when we're looking at a normal distribution,
255.28s: it assumes that there is a very, very small amount, small number of occurrences that take
261.92s: place as we get to the extremes of the data set or the tails.
266.68s: However, when we have kurtosis, we increase likelihood of occurrence in a tail.
273.84s: So for example, if you look at just regular stock market prices and you plot them out,
279.32s: it is not a normal distribution.
280.84s: We exhibit and experience moves that statistically would be unsound in a normal distribution
287.56s: more frequently than we should.
290.24s: So part of that is due to kurtosis.
293.24s: And that's just a function of the pricing of the markets and the way things that move.
298.28s: The other function that we see sometimes is skew, where normally if we have a symmetrical
304.92s: distribution, again, both sides of the distribution would have the similar shape, just like you
311.56s: see here.
312.88s: Although this looks like it has cancer and a lot of growths because I can't draw straight
317.12s: with the mouse, but you get the idea.
319.48s: And then on the positive skew, negative skew, essentially again, what you're seeing
325.12s: is an increase or decrease likelihood of occurrences within a tail.
330.32s: So if we look at this example of a negative skew, we see that the tail actually raises
335.64s: up on this side compared to this side, which means that we experience additional outsized
342.28s: moves that are not priced into a normal distribution curve.
347.60s: So why did I just go into an impromptu session on basic statistics?
353.76s: Well, it's because all of this leads to what I'm about to talk about, which is the
359.84s: vaultally surface.
361.60s: So this in and of itself is not the funnest stuff to go through.
366.68s: So if you made it, be sure to like the video, let us know that you got through at least
370.84s: the first half.
372.32s: Now let's transition over to the output.
375.28s: So we now understand what the blacksholes model assumes.
381.20s: Now we also understand that that's not actually what the market exhibits.
385.40s: So let's talk about how we compensate and what we use is the vaultally surface and
392.80s: vaultally smiles.
395.32s: So on the center of the screen there, this is a chart I pulled from Investopedia, which
399.64s: pulled from Wikipedia, which I have no idea who the original author is, but it's a very
403.32s: reasonable chart.
404.32s: So I didn't bother making one.
406.32s: And it shows you the implied vaults, letty surface.
409.20s: So what I want to highlight is there are a couple different aspects to it.
413.92s: We have time to maturity over here on this axis.
418.36s: Then we have moneyness.
419.68s: How far something is in or out of the money on this axis?
423.52s: And then we have the implied volatility on this axis.
426.92s: The blacksholes model would essentially assume that the implied volatility surface would
431.76s: be flat.
432.76s: And we use the same implied volatility for the same series time expiration of options across
439.76s: the different series.
441.16s: But that's not what we do.
442.92s: What happens is if we open up the trading platform and we take a look at, let's pick this
451.88s: options change.
452.88s: So this is in the spy.
453.88s: And I'm looking at the 19 August 31 options change.
457.72s: I want you to notice something.
459.64s: If I take a look at this column right here on the put side, this is implied volatility.
465.28s: The furthest one I have listed here as of right now is a 12 delta.
469.20s: And it's a 29.23 implied volatility.
473.44s: Then if I go to the at the money option, I see 22.9 22.8.
480.00s: And then if I go further in the money, I see 22.7.
484.84s: And then I see a period a little further in that's 20.31.
490.84s: All of that is just on the put side.
493.76s: If we look at the implied volatility for this options chain, which means this specific
499.76s: expiration, it's 24.78%.
503.20s: If I look at the implied volatility for spy in general, it's 24.69%.
509.08s: If we go back into the 19 August and we look at the call side and let's find a 12 delta
517.08s: call.
519.08s: So that would put us out here.
522.08s: The 12 delta call implied volatility is 18.51%.
529.56s: So what you're seeing is the same delta out of the money option for calls and puts is different.
536.08s: But there's a couple important trends that you should have noticed as I ran through that,
540.40s: which is the smile, which we'll get into in just a second.
543.44s: But essentially by looking at the moneyness for different options, the different times
548.32s: to expiration, time to maturity, DTE, we're seeing that there are different implied
553.84s: volatility, which is why it's called a volatility surface because it's taking in multiple
557.84s: inputs and it's giving you exactly this.
560.76s: It's a surface profile where we can experience different implied vultilities for different
566.72s: series of options in the same expiration or different expirations.
571.64s: The main punchline is it's not the same as the blacksholes model would assume.
576.92s: So I showed you that the call implied volatility was different than the put implied volatility
582.84s: for the same out of the money delta.
585.00s: Why?
586.00s: That's because of the volatility smile.
588.44s: So essentially on a vertical axis here, we have implied volatility.
593.12s: And then on the horizontal axis here, we have the strike price.
597.84s: So whether it's in the money or out of the money, and we're looking at puts here, but essentially
603.16s: we see a little bit of a smile unless there's a skew in the smile or kurtosis, which can
609.44s: occur.
610.60s: But essentially what it means is that again, the implied volatility for different series,
615.96s: different strikes is not flat.
618.08s: It's not equal.
619.72s: We have at the money typically be seems to be lower implied volatility, whereas deep
626.84s: out of the money or deep in the money tends to have increased implied volatility.
631.40s: As you saw in that example, I just showed you it's not always the case, but very frequently
635.96s: is the case.
636.96s: It is product specific.
638.84s: So to recap, because I got 10 minutes and 40 seconds, I want to keep my promise.
645.00s: After all, the blacksholes model in a vacuum assumes a log normal distribution, which is
653.08s: the cumulative distribution of a log normal distribution.
657.12s: That has certain series of assumptions that I showed to you are not the case.
662.72s: So what that leaves us with is people that interact with the markets create implied volatility
670.16s: services for the individual securities that they're trading based on their series of
675.92s: assumptions to arrive at what they perceive to be the correct implied volatility for that
681.12s: product.
682.52s: And that leads to different implied volatilities for various strikes within the same expiration
690.04s: and within different explorations.
693.12s: So all of this is to say that the market, at least at this point, is pricing in different
699.76s: volatility than the blacksholes model would assume.
703.28s: And it is because the market does not move the way that the blacksholes model assumes
709.12s: that it does.
710.32s: We have fat tails.
711.68s: We have more outlier cases than we would expect to see.
715.08s: And that is exactly why the volatility surface is not flat in why we have a volatility
720.84s: smile.
721.92s: So if you made it all the way through this video, make sure you comment with what you
726.80s: learned or what you would add so that we could crowdsource some information.
730.64s: Plus, I'm just curious to see who makes it through the entire videos on these.
734.48s: I know they're kind of heavy, but I am fascinated by this stuff because even though that the
739.28s: model that we primarily used to price options wasn't perfect, the markets found a way to
744.32s: still make it all work based on real information as we got it.
748.16s: And that's fascinating to me.
749.44s: So as always, keep on being an outlier, keep expanding our knowledge.
754.48s: I'm joined the community.
755.48s: If you haven't checked out our discord, it's completely free.
757.68s: You can find the link in the video description below.
760.48s: And until next time, be an outlier.
762.48s: See y'all later.
