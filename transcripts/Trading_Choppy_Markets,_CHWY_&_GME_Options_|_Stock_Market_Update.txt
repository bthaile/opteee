0.80s: what's up outliers time for another
2.32s: market update and figure to share a few
4.76s: pictures but I want to talk about the
7.00s: indices I want to talk about the Fed
9.16s: rate I want to talk about how I think
11.60s: about trading the indices when they're
13.44s: behaving as they are where to find some
16.00s: opportunities I want to talk about
17.72s: earnings quickly and then I want to
19.84s: touch on some chewy options activity and
22.72s: then same for GameStop so we have a few
24.48s: things to cover I am standing up because
26.32s: my leg is still bothering me and we have
29.48s: our boy the big white wolf to help us
32.04s: out get through this thing but this is
34.96s: uh a picture from Portage Lake which
38.56s: there's kind of a bunch of different
39.64s: glaciers that run off into this which is
41.48s: kind of a cool spot so figured I'd share
44.12s: a few of these with you guys there's a
45.72s: tunnel right here actually that brings
47.80s: you down into another tunnel that gets
50.28s: you on the other side of this mountain
52.84s: this is on the other side of that
54.96s: picture just another Glacier with all
56.60s: this runoff that leads into that Lake
59.00s: that I was just showing you this is the
60.52s: top of that mountain right here so you
62.28s: can see this area up here that's what
64.56s: this picture is and I just I don't know
67.36s: the movement of Glaciers are fascinating
69.68s: to me like the coloration of them is
71.20s: super cool the fact that they
72.84s: essentially carve their way through
75.48s: mountains is kind of neat this rock was
80.04s: also on the other side of that mountain
82.32s: Whittier and I just thought it looked
84.44s: kind of like the bow of a ship and it's
86.88s: crazy to me now there's just all these
88.96s: giant trees that grow off of this little
91.00s: tiny thin piece of rock this reminds me
93.84s: of like the Pacific Northwest and then
96.44s: this was another Glacier while we were
98.24s: going back from Whittier into Portage
100.72s: through that same tunnel I thought this
102.44s: one was cool because there's a lot of
103.68s: these different little runoff shoots of
105.36s: water kind of running over the Black
107.28s: Rock which is a a pretty sure volcanic
109.64s: kind of neat and there's still a lot of
110.96s: this green moss growing which I think is
113.48s: fun this is a closeup of a glacier in
115.20s: case you've never seen one the
117.24s: coloration is really neat the dark area
119.92s: is this kind of sediment from it
121.72s: burrowing through and pulling through
123.68s: Rock and landscape and then the blue is
126.64s: a function of the compression of water
129.80s: and ice and it gets to a point where it
131.96s: filters out light differently and that's
133.96s: kind of what leads to this which is kind
136.28s: of
137.16s: cool this was a spot that we stayed it
140.08s: was right over here this was our uh
142.64s: cabin and it was in just on another one
145.08s: of these glacial lakes just thought it
146.88s: was kind of neat this is a bunch of
150.12s: glacial runoff actually from a park
151.76s: we're going to go check out today and go
153.44s: hike and fly the Drone a little bit this
155.72s: is where we're staying now this is
156.92s: Seward and our spot is like right down
159.44s: here on the bay this is a glacier over
162.84s: there this was where we were staying
164.40s: yesterday which was you had to take like
166.20s: an hour boat ride to some yurs it's
168.56s: completely off the grid very cool spot
170.68s: but there's a chance to go kayaking
172.24s: check out some of these waterfalls and
173.56s: stuff which is really really cool so
176.08s: that's what we've been up to now let's
177.72s: get into the markets what's happening
179.60s: well I haven't been trading much
181.36s: obviously yesterday I had no service all
182.92s: day and today I traded some Zero D to
185.80s: that went pretty well I find when the
188.20s: market has slightly higher volatility
190.36s: like this it can be appealing but the
193.80s: trades need a little bit of room and I
196.12s: actually tend to go a little further out
198.72s: of the money to accommodate some
201.64s: additional movement now I also find the
206.60s: behavior between all the indices
209.04s: interesting in terms ter of how
210.72s: essentially they're in lock step
213.12s: everything from the shape of the candles
215.60s: it like they're almost IND discernible
218.44s: and that happens periodically but not
221.32s: very frequently you can even see the the
223.84s: constitution of the downside is
225.52s: different right so the Russell on the
229.28s: first started to sell off then it had
231.92s: this gap down day that actually was a
233.96s: slightly positive day and when you look
236.32s: at the cues and the S&P 500 that was not
238.92s: the case but then the behavior from
243.28s: essentially the fifth until today has
245.52s: been almost lock step which I find
248.16s: interesting now my broad sense here of
251.20s: the indices is I feel like this selloff
253.84s: needed to happen I think that this is
255.96s: something again that I'd kind of talked
257.72s: about for a little while I think that we
259.88s: had a really really aggressive ascent
263.52s: and sooner or later that has to come to
266.04s: a head and mellow out just a little bit
269.52s: so so that's kind of what I'm seeing
271.28s: here now this decline was a little
273.68s: steeper and faster specifically in this
276.20s: phase than you know a normal selloff
278.96s: might include but there was some
280.60s: additional events that led to it
282.76s: accelerating to a pretty strong degree
285.00s: but one thing I noticed almost
287.64s: uniformally is that as we got down to
289.76s: this value area and towards the point of
292.08s: control I mean it literally bounced
293.76s: right off of it and that's because when
296.88s: it got to this level lots of people
299.00s: became super interested in transacting
301.76s: and you can see that reflected in the
304.44s: buy volume just going off the shelf here
307.88s: right so the average volume as of the
312.08s: fifth was 57 million and the total
315.40s: volume on that day was 146 million so
319.60s: what that tells me is that it got to a
322.56s: point where massive buying pressure
325.16s: started to step in and support it here
327.32s: so the way I personally would look at
329.04s: this is as a near-term support line now
332.76s: again support turns into resistance as
334.84s: Things fall through there's there's no
336.76s: real function that keeps things where
338.76s: they are outside of supply and demand
340.68s: and I think sometimes people get too
342.08s: wrapped up around that idea of I I view
344.40s: this as like a support line and then if
346.36s: it falls right through then people are
348.48s: shocked and to me it's not shocking
350.64s: again I view technical analysis in the
353.32s: lens of a probabilistic assessment not
356.80s: deterministic so the fact that this
359.64s: behave the way it did again doesn't
360.96s: surprise me and I would view this to be
363.92s: an area that it would be more likely to
366.28s: behave like this than not but that
368.04s: doesn't mean if new information comes
369.92s: out new bad news whatever that it would
372.24s: fly right through it absolutely can it
374.08s: always can so just important to keep
376.04s: that in mind and I don't know if you
377.24s: guys can hear those seagulls in the
378.84s: background if you can they're kind of
382.00s: part of the content I guess because
383.48s: there's no way I can stop them so say
386.08s: hello to them I guess so that's what I
389.20s: see in the S&P 500 it looks like we kind
392.08s: of came off this top a little bit then
395.12s: we got to a point where the market
396.52s: became really interested in transacting
399.04s: and even with this heavy sell-off volume
402.00s: on the 7th it picked right back up it
404.84s: with near total buy volume today it was
407.08s: 93% buy volume yesterday was 96% sale
410.92s: volume so there's just a lot of people
412.76s: countering one another which is what you
414.64s: want to see in a two-sided Market that's
416.64s: a good thing but it means that there's a
418.96s: mix of opinions on where things are now
422.20s: my opinion is this selloff probably
425.36s: found a little bit of a ground here now
428.44s: what would need to happen in order for
430.28s: it to continue in my opinion would be a
432.32s: change of information now when I think
434.56s: about trading these kind of things to
436.32s: answer the question that I got in the
437.92s: Discord it really comes down to the
440.16s: broader position that I'm looking to
441.60s: build for me personally and anybody that
444.24s: follows the way that I trade something
445.64s: like the coverage strangle you guys
447.48s: already know that when I see the market
450.28s: near all-time highs or near-term highs
452.20s: as I like to refer to it more
453.64s: specifically I'm already lighter on what
456.56s: I'm offering and that's not because I
458.72s: don't think it's going to go down but it
460.36s: just means that's not where I want to
461.80s: add a bunch of risk if I have trades on
464.32s: I'm not going to take them down because
465.64s: it's at Highs but if I don't have trades
468.40s: on I'm not going to pile into a bunch of
470.28s: them when we're sitting at highs that's
472.20s: just asking for trouble so in this kind
475.40s: of scenario I had already rotated out of
477.88s: the indices and for me personally I'm
480.28s: looking to trade them more so via ratio
482.36s: diagonals at this point specifically
483.92s: ratio call diagonals as compared to
486.28s: trading something like the coverage
487.40s: strangle and that's just because I'm
488.88s: trading the coverage strangle already on
490.44s: tle Q's so I have leveraged exposure
494.04s: that I'm running with a smaller subset
495.48s: of capital that's why I'm using tle Q's
498.00s: is because the leverage you don't have
499.08s: to add as much and I'm trading more so
502.84s: the the stronger directions in the
505.12s: market not just maintaining positive
507.16s: drift exposure and that's just because I
509.80s: think we're in a generally tumultuous
512.20s: time and I don't want to get stuck kind
515.00s: of holding too much overall Market
518.36s: Deltas here so what that all summarizes
521.68s: too is one volatility is very high and
524.92s: that's why I'm trading zero DTE you can
527.16s: trade anything really that includes some
529.68s: sort of variance risk premiums because
532.20s: the the market is priced so rich right
534.28s: now and I think that that's an
536.64s: interesting trade I think earnings is
538.64s: another really interesting space right
540.28s: now going to start slowing down soon but
542.52s: there's been really good releases that
544.72s: we've seen so far that offer pretty good
547.44s: opportunities for the markets themselves
550.24s: I would probably use something like this
552.64s: point of control again depending on when
554.76s: I would want to get into something like
556.48s: a diagonal for me I'm more interested in
560.00s: something like the Russell for a
562.48s: diagonal and it's just because I think
564.60s: it's still undervalued compared to the
566.76s: other indices and I think that the
568.92s: movement we've seen in the FED leads us
571.92s: to a scenario that obviously had a pted
574.68s: us back down and it would not surprise
576.60s: me to see another positive drift up
578.48s: towards the previous high that it posted
581.00s: was at just above or right at like 2,300
584.20s: so I like the the relative opportunity
586.40s: in Russell Mo and again I'm already
588.04s: playing tle Q's so that gives me quasi
591.96s: S&P 500 exposure already via the tech
596.56s: overlap heavy Tech overlap and also some
598.56s: of the other companies
599.92s: just a little more
601.56s: concentrated so when I'm looking at
605.16s: something like the Russell though I do
607.16s: like this to the upside still and when I
609.56s: look at where it seems to be basing it's
613.76s: already hit actually let me grab iwm so
616.24s: that you can see where the points of
617.96s: control are this is an example that just
620.64s: plummeted right through the point of
621.92s: control couldn't have cared less and
624.00s: then it did run off of the 200 and start
626.88s: rebounding up off of that so for me this
629.72s: starts looking interesting from that
631.88s: perspective using something in there as
634.72s: the downside control depending on how
636.92s: much room you want to give it that
638.56s: obviously will depend on the book
639.88s: specifically but you could use something
642.28s: really really tight like this 2011 202
645.44s: handle or you can use something looser
647.60s: like the 200 day ma but I think the 200
650.16s: day ma is a is a really really
653.44s: wrong base to use because it really
657.04s: doesn't drop down through the 200 day
659.72s: overly frequently it did this year and
662.08s: you would have gotten chopped up a
663.40s: little bit but not a ton if you're using
666.44s: really short-term Mas moving averages in
668.92s: markets like this you're going to get
670.64s: you're going to get destroyed because
672.48s: things are G just going to move around
673.92s: way too much and it's going to be really
676.48s: really annoying to try to maintain a
678.08s: position if you're trying to hold things
679.88s: too tightly so one of the things I think
682.28s: about is giving stuff a little bit of
684.00s: room to breathe sizing things down just
686.40s: a little bit in case it turns back over
688.32s: so that if you you decide to use
690.08s: something that has a wider margin right
692.40s: like the 200 day ma versus this 202
695.08s: handle that takes you again this is down
697.76s: at like 197 198 so it's a much bigger
701.28s: drop that you would potentially absorb
703.40s: if you use the 200 day and in that kind
706.16s: of scenario I would want to size things
708.84s: that would allow me to withstand that
710.60s: kind of drop if I were to use it for me
713.12s: when I look at this I think that's fine
714.84s: I think using the 202 handle is okay I'm
717.16s: just expecting to get stopped out all of
719.04s: that is fully on the table at this point
722.80s: so the really punchline Cliff Notes
727.12s: version of this is when markets are
728.84s: trending sideways like this if you're
730.84s: using things that are too tight you're
732.24s: going to get chopped up that's just how
733.88s: it goes and it's difficult to trade at
737.00s: least a lot of the things that I like to
738.44s: trade in markets like this like ratio
740.44s: call diagonals unless you give them more
743.40s: room to move and just size them more
746.08s: appropriately so that's kind of my two
748.20s: cents on that now the other thing I
749.96s: wanted to take a look at with you are
751.56s: the sectors and it's because I'm still
753.48s: seeing strength and I think a lot of
755.88s: times people forget that there is
757.92s: strength out there in markets like this
760.92s: so right now the S&P 500 coming down
764.84s: obviously xlb coming down still but
768.20s: there's a couple things that actually
770.36s: are hanging in there and providing a bit
773.28s: of strength xlu utilities is one of them
776.12s: XLV is another one XLR real estate is
780.16s: finally coming into favor whereas
782.00s: earlier this year I was fading real
784.28s: estate but this so far looks good xlp
787.56s: looks good so what I'm trying to
789.48s: highlight to you is whether you want to
790.76s: trade something to the upside to the
792.16s: downside there's opportunities and what
794.00s: I like to do is find the sectors that
795.68s: are doing what I want in a corresponding
798.40s: time frame and then overlay trades maybe
801.60s: look within the sector and find the more
803.52s: specific strong performing components to
805.96s: it something like that tends to work
808.04s: pretty well for me so just wanted to
809.64s: share that with you because there are a
811.36s: lot of opportunities and I'm actually
812.92s: really excited to start trading a bit
816.16s: more actively because of that now for me
819.08s: a lot of the things that still look way
821.16s: way way more interesting are these
823.12s: Varian risk premium plays because
825.20s: they're just they're just so rich right
828.52s: now ivp I uh IV percentile in the S&P
833.00s: 500 is at 99% it's so high it's
837.76s: extremely elevated
839.68s: which offers a lot of really interesting
842.48s: opportunities to capture volatility and
845.84s: this is one of the one of my favorite
847.36s: times to trade stuff like that if we
849.16s: take a quick look at the vix it is
852.28s: coming down it peaked all the way up at
855.40s: what 65 this ran over some of my trades
859.48s: but I always have defined risk this is
861.80s: an example where I typically talk to you
864.00s: guys about not liking vertical spreads
865.48s: there's no chance you're going to see me
867.04s: short calls in vix it's always going to
869.80s: be spread off so that I can withstand
871.48s: stuff like this and they're now making
873.44s: money but the cool thing about vix mean
876.72s: reverting product it has a lot of very
878.92s: standardized behaviors and this still is
882.08s: slightly elevated compared to longer
884.28s: term time frames and averages so to me
887.64s: this actually offers a really
890.04s: interesting opportunity but it would be
892.84s: generally long Deltas that I would want
894.52s: to put on Long spy beta weighted Deltas
897.68s: it would be short vix but that can be a
900.68s: tough trade to hold especially if it's
902.32s: not working well all right so now let's
904.68s: take a quick look at the
908.00s: FED I fixed the screen darkness by the
910.76s: way it should be a little bit better
911.88s: today that's what this is but let's take
914.00s: a quick look at the FED now the FED is
916.44s: now still over 50% probability of a half
920.64s: Point rate cut which is kind of telling
923.64s: that tells us that the market got a
926.76s: little bit over done and they're kind of
931.40s: concerned that's what I see here right
933.72s: so if we look at the probability a week
935.68s: ago of a 50 basis point C it was like
938.84s: 22% and then a month ago it was 4 and a
941.28s: half% essentially now it's all the way
943.64s: up to 56 it was as high is 69 look at us
946.32s: go so the market is now definitely
950.88s: paying closer attention to economic data
954.32s: as it's coming out and we're seeing a
957.08s: bit of a mixed bag so if we take a look
959.60s: at consumer credit that actually came in
961.56s: kind of light surprising to me but the
963.56s: linqu are going up which I find
965.56s: interesting so the consumer is using
968.52s: less credit but they're also defaulting
970.64s: on credit still so that leads to a
973.12s: pretty constrained environment and then
974.64s: initial jobless claims came in kind of
976.36s: light it was expected at 241 came in at
978.88s: 233 this is an interesting one because
981.20s: this is kind of like good news is bad
982.52s: news bad news is good news it's a mixed
984.24s: bag because we want to see jobless
986.32s: claims actually a little bit higher to
989.00s: again start pushing the fed's hand but
991.72s: their hand is already kind of pushed as
993.36s: you could tell from the bond market so I
996.52s: I don't actually know if this matters
998.52s: quite as much at this point based on
1000.20s: what we've seen over the last couple
1002.28s: weeks so that's kind of like a broad
1004.92s: Market perspective of what I'm seeing
1007.56s: what I'm thinking now let's take a quick
1009.60s: look at chewy this was asked because
1013.24s: apparently there was some options
1014.60s: activity in here that was sticking out
1017.00s: to you all so I'll take a peek I haven't
1019.36s: looked at this yet so I don't have
1020.48s: anything prepared I'm kind of going to
1022.04s: look at it real time with you guys so
1025.12s: just from a general chart perspective
1027.20s: very sideways very very sideways and
1031.16s: this doesn't look great for rk's
1034.64s: position if he still has it on which I'm
1037.04s: completely unsure of personally I have
1039.48s: no idea what he's done now the reason
1042.68s: why I say that is because I I think his
1044.64s: average is what like 24 something uh you
1047.48s: guys will have to correct me I I don't
1049.08s: have the um I don't have all the
1051.60s: information at the top of the dome right
1053.48s: now CU we're still a little disconnected
1055.68s: but I think it was like 24 something so
1058.04s: here it's down 23 and he had a big
1060.32s: position it was like 9 million, shares
1063.12s: so I
1064.92s: think if he's still holding it's
1067.08s: interesting and I don't know what he'd
1068.36s: be doing but let's take a look at the
1071.48s: options chain and I also have unusual
1075.28s: whales H up for us to take a look at
1077.88s: together so let's see so in the options
1083.16s: chain volume is still very call
1086.80s: heavy and it's 261,000 calls against 199
1091.04s: puts so this is contracted quite a lot
1093.60s: this used to be a much wider spread with
1096.24s: calls very much
1098.52s: leading
1100.12s: now from Trading activity today in terms
1104.04s: of
1104.92s: quantity there's some nine OG calls
1108.88s: going out I see blocks of like 500 so
1114.24s: decent Siz positions but nothing massive
1116.52s: let's take a look at unusual
1119.80s: whales and we will grab uh
1123.84s: chewy and then I'll take a look at it
1126.20s: for this week so and
1128.96s: see what's popping
1131.08s: up I do see a block of 5,000 of the
1135.92s: 30s that's a interesting one
1139.36s: because it
1142.08s: does so this says was about to
1147.16s: open this is interesting so the reason
1149.64s: why I think this is interesting is that
1152.36s: a couple things come to my mind the
1154.28s: first one is if this is
1157.16s: RK then it would lead me to believe that
1160.08s: he
1160.96s: closed the rest of his stock position
1165.84s: because I don't see why he would put
1168.44s: these on unless he's just using options
1171.52s: to play the move which is not outside
1173.60s: the realm of possibility we've seen him
1175.24s: do
1176.56s: that I know a lot of times people seem
1179.40s: to assume that he's using options always
1181.84s: to acquire shares but I've been spending
1184.56s: more time going through his history and
1186.92s: again I want to be very clear I still do
1189.32s: not consider myself any sort of
1191.12s: well-versed source of information I'm
1192.88s: still learning a lot myself but it seems
1196.24s: like he uses options to trade
1199.04s: directionally and not necessarily always
1200.96s: with the intent based on the fingerprint
1203.32s: that I've kind of built for him so far
1205.48s: he kind of has a profile now the fact
1208.32s: that it's 5,000 I actually don't think
1210.68s: that's as telling as people think I
1212.64s: don't think he's attached to the number
1214.72s: 5,000 I think it has everything to do
1217.40s: with the size of the trade that's going
1219.56s: on so when he was building his gme
1222.68s: position I don't think he was using
1224.24s: 5,000 Lots because he likes 5,000 Lots I
1226.88s: was thinking I think he was using 5 ,000
1229.00s: Lots as a way to scale into a trade to a
1232.32s: size and a premium that makes sense for
1234.48s: him and this does still fall into this
1237.68s: because this 5,000 lot trade is
1241.64s: $270,000 but it's also at the ask so
1246.24s: buying
1247.60s: more which could be I mean that really
1250.72s: could be something he would do it's very
1253.44s: hard to say but I wouldn't immediately
1256.60s: assume it is simply because it's 5,000 I
1260.40s: think we would need to see a little bit
1262.36s: more than that now as far as strike
1264.60s: selection with Chewy at 23 this seems
1267.44s: like it would be a little far out of the
1269.08s: money for him based on what I've seen
1271.12s: but again that doesn't mean it can't be
1272.52s: him and then the other thing I see is
1274.56s: for the DTE 22 DTE a little shorter
1277.68s: dated than what I see him buy typically
1280.20s: but again it could be him and just going
1282.84s: off of historic stuff and trying to
1284.68s: connect what I can but the other thing I
1287.32s: find let's take a look at that options
1289.12s: chain specifically which is the 30th
1292.80s: 30s so let's go
1295.84s: to
1297.68s: these and
1301.20s: these so there's
1303.56s: two
1305.56s: 125 oi and 11,000 volume today so that
1311.08s: is somebody making a concerted position
1313.32s: like if I was watching the market today
1314.96s: all day this would have popped up on my
1316.32s: scan without a doubt because it's the
1318.88s: exact kind of activity that I look for
1321.04s: so this is somebody doing something very
1322.88s: specific now it's hard for me to tell if
1325.92s: this is spread across let's take a quick
1327.92s: look at that if we go to the volume we
1329.76s: can see what happened today let's look
1331.88s: in that 30 Aug expiration cycle so we
1334.20s: can see those 30s perched up way up here
1337.16s: what are these these aren't 30s yeah
1339.08s: okay these aren't 30s good if these were
1340.96s: 30s that was going to be a problem uh
1342.88s: just in terms of making a guess at what
1344.40s: they are but I mean the overwhelming
1347.24s: majority volume today in the 30s in 30 a
1352.72s: was the 30s so that's a very specific
1355.76s: position that's being built out and you
1357.16s: can see the 30s are still here
1359.48s: overwhelmingly the leader of all volume
1363.48s: which
1364.24s: is
1366.00s: interesting and when is
1369.88s: earnings oh it's the
1372.80s: 28th so this could be somebody making a
1375.44s: bet on earnings this makes more sense
1377.80s: now
1379.12s: so that could be another thing this yeah
1381.40s: this trade makes a lot more sense to me
1383.04s: now so because I was curious why we
1387.36s: would go to the 30s right as I typically
1389.48s: talk to you guys these weekly
1390.84s: expirations won't be as good as the
1393.16s: monthlies in terms of liquidity
1395.64s: but if you explicitly want to be exposed
1399.36s: to earnings this is this is the cycle
1401.64s: you pick so if I had to guess now
1404.44s: knowing that this is somebody that wants
1406.00s: to play earnings to the upside this is a
1407.76s: speculative upside play and earnings and
1411.96s: who is it we don't know could it be
1414.12s: somebody like RK it could be it
1415.92s: absolutely could be but I have no idea
1418.64s: all right now let's take a quick look at
1419.96s: gme because there was another trade that
1423.76s: I want to highlight quickly today which
1426.20s: was actually on the put
1429.32s: side
1433.36s: uh let's sort this it should have been
1436.68s: up at the top
1439.28s: I want to make sure I'm not filtering
1440.52s: anything else by
1442.16s: accident yeah so let's take a look at
1444.64s: this to this I'm looking at the 7th to
1447.28s: the
1449.12s: eth and then I'm looking at calls and
1452.40s: puts the bid or the
1457.08s: offer wait is this just picking up
1463.44s: GM I don't know why this is just saying
1465.64s: GM there cuz that's also not the price
1468.84s: this is showing 42 bucks but I did gme
1471.92s: let me refresh
1473.84s: this yeah okay I did just pick up GM I
1476.20s: was wondering because the trade I was
1477.48s: looking at wasn't there and there it is
1479.84s: okay good so this is what I wanted to
1481.44s: show you I'm keeping the dates open on
1485.08s: purpose because something really weird
1488.68s: is happening right now with these 125s
1490.92s: something really really weird so you can
1493.00s: see on the
1494.52s: SI there was a bunch of 125 p
1498.84s: that were sold to open then we can see
1501.88s: on the 7th there was more 125s that went
1505.20s: out a
1506.40s: bunch and then if we look at the
1511.12s: 125s for today 110 of them were at the
1516.56s: ask so this to me looks like somebody
1520.00s: that sold to open here and then bought
1523.04s: to close here now why this trade went
1526.24s: the way it did I really don't know it's
1529.40s: very weird to me the reason why it's so
1531.88s: weird is I don't know why we would waste
1535.64s: the time and effort to put on 110 of
1537.76s: these 125s if this is the same person
1540.60s: which I'm speculating it's a guess just
1542.64s: guessing but it seems like it's probably
1544.60s: the same person and I see this total
1548.80s: size going on and then I see it going on
1552.56s: again and then a day later essentially
1556.08s: coming off at 103
1558.36s: 80 so the position would have been sold
1560.96s: to open for about 104 and a half there
1563.40s: 10410 there so like 104 and change 104
1566.56s: and a quarter on average probably and it
1569.08s: looks like some of it came down today
1570.44s: for 10380 so if we sold to open here
1573.36s: bought to close here that's actually
1574.52s: making a few bucks interestingly so I I
1578.84s: I'm keeping a closer eye and I really
1580.44s: need to spend a little more time digging
1581.96s: into those to try to figure out what the
1584.28s: overall behavior is but I just found
1585.96s: that really interesting to go through
1587.76s: the effort of building this position and
1589.20s: then essentially taking it off after a
1590.72s: few pennies of a move it seems like this
1593.12s: position went on to serve another
1594.48s: purpose and I don't know what but that
1597.44s: is partially what seems to be going on
1600.04s: there because guessing a good part of it
1602.76s: came down today so that's 1.14 million
1606.04s: in premium so yeah that's what I'm
1608.72s: seeing from gme I wanted to update you
1611.32s: on that trade now let's take a quick
1613.00s: look at the gme option te just to see if
1616.80s: anything interesting is going on in
1619.16s: here if we take a look at open interest
1621.72s: 724k against 366 love that so we are now
1625.72s: just about at 2:1 which again is that
1628.44s: more bullish configuration that I
1630.04s: typically see and the overwhelming
1632.20s: majority is out there at 160 so to me
1634.84s: that's really where this gets more
1636.16s: interesting it seems like next week's
1638.16s: expiration is becoming much more engaged
1641.96s: and we're seeing the critical mass of
1644.48s: options hanging out there the 125s are
1647.84s: busy as per usual but we also see a
1650.68s: couple other cycles that are pretty
1653.72s: aggressive here so the 30s have what is
1656.60s: that
1658.24s: 32,600 contracts so that's a big strike
1661.68s: the 25s have
1664.16s: 22,800 and then the what is this the 40s
1667.52s: yep the 40s have almost 20,000 so
1669.72s: there's a lot of exposure out there for
1673.88s: next week and what does that look like
1675.80s: in terms of total yeah it's like 250
1678.16s: ,000 calls against 100,000 puts
1682.04s: so it makes me really interested I'm
1685.16s: very very interested in what we see
1687.44s: going on there if we take a quick look
1689.52s: at the chart it's good to see GameStop
1693.08s: starting to base and move up a little
1696.28s: bit but it has a way to go before I
1699.24s: would call this any sort of a return to
1701.32s: value or kind of trending back towards
1703.24s: the short-term price mean because this
1707.16s: now looks like like a bit of a floor
1709.36s: that's baked in but we have to keep a
1711.56s: really close eye on it it did hit this
1713.76s: value area and people were interested in
1716.24s: it quite a lot there and then if we take
1719.12s: a look at the volume today volume is
1722.12s: still really really light but there's
1725.08s: more buy volume but there's just it's so
1727.96s: light there was
1729.72s: 55.4 million with 88% being buy which is
1734.32s: great but the buy volume is pretty light
1737.52s: now based on averages that I see that's
1739.92s: like
1740.68s: 70% plus are being routed off exchange
1744.32s: so that volume isn't obviously hitting
1746.76s: here it's not helping us understand
1748.16s: price Discovery near real time but I
1751.60s: would be interested to see if on
1753.72s: Exchange volume starts to Peak back up
1756.80s: but that's what we're seeing so far for
1758.76s: GameStop as always if there's anything
1760.56s: that you want me to take a look at you
1761.68s: have any questions just let me know be
1764.04s: an outlier see you guys later
