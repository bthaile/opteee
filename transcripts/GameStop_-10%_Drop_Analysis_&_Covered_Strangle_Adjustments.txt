0.72s: what's up Alli time for a quick market
2.52s: analysis on GameStop specifically
4.76s: because man was there a day today I want
7.40s: to talk about the overall price action
9.80s: where it seems to be sitting at the end
11.84s: of the video I'll go through POS some
13.60s: position updates for the coverage
14.76s: triangle I don't imagine most people are
16.28s: super interested in that but I'm sharing
18.32s: that just because I said I would so I'll
20.16s: save that towards the end and we'll
21.84s: spend most of the time just talking
23.28s: about the stock the movement what things
25.76s: look like because this is a note worthy
30.88s: day I did a little
33.12s: homework and I went back essentially to
37.00s: the Inception of GameStop and I wanted
40.36s: to look at what's the Frequency that we
42.76s: saw 10% plus down moves
46.36s: specifically and as you can see is a
48.52s: total representation of days it's just
51.28s: over 1% this is rounded down because
53.36s: it's like 1.02 or something like that so
55.88s: you can see that this is a hyper rare
60.44s: 75 instances as a gross count so you
65.08s: would think this would be
68.56s: necessitated or follow some sort of big
72.76s: news cycle maybe Ryan Cohen steps down
77.36s: maybe this could
79.44s: be um GameStop decides that it's going
82.60s: to file for
84.04s: bankruptcy none of that's happening
86.96s: Cohen is still doing his job he's doing
89.36s: a great job
90.72s: we're not seeing any underlying change
93.88s: in the company at all so the fact that
97.28s: there's this big of a move on literally
101.20s: no news that I can
103.08s: find is
105.88s: exceedingly
108.04s: suspect then we take this article from
112.04s: yesterday funny enough this is from
114.32s: benzinga and you can see that there was
117.32s: a bit of a a bearish series of trades
121.32s: that came in for GameStop yesterday
125.56s: literally
128.00s: yesterday did that activity cause this
131.48s: sort of movement personally don't think
134.08s: so did that activity front run a
137.80s: potential movement maybe I don't know I
141.00s: can't prove it one way or the other but
143.36s: what I can tell you objectively is that
146.08s: when I look across the other tickers
150.04s: that are most closely associated with
152.52s: this and we grab
155.76s: xrt xrt had a inside day today what is
160.84s: this down
162.84s: 0.86% it's showing us so open here at
166.20s: 7852 closed at
169.36s: 7759 so the broader sector that it's a
173.04s: part of didn't experience this move then
176.04s: if we take a look at small caps
180.56s: small caps literally had an
182.92s: upd so what happened here now I did take
186.36s: a look at AMC just out of curiosity
189.28s: because it is frequent that you will see
193.00s: somewhat sympathetic moves between these
195.64s: now you can see the lead in to the
197.88s: previous drops looks different in AMC
200.40s: than it does for GameStop but both of
202.52s: them do have four consecutive drops that
204.88s: culminated with a much larger drop
208.28s: today interesting is that not
212.76s: so it starts to beg the question what
215.72s: the is going on why would this
218.24s: happen what's causing this because it's
221.28s: already fallen out the 10day is rolled
224.84s: over 20day rolled over it punched right
227.72s: through the 50 and now it's charging
229.84s: towards the 150 I'm going to change this
231.80s: to a 200 out of curiosity to see how
235.32s: this Stacks up still got a a long ways
239.28s: before
240.44s: it gets to a 200 day ma which is still
243.12s: shockingly positively
245.28s: sloping so I don't see anything I I
248.96s: haven't seen any sort of news that would
251.24s: explain this move now the other thing
253.92s: that we were talking about before though
256.08s: was the expectation that this week was
258.12s: going to be volatile and we can see that
260.72s: the front vult here is literally
264.44s: 136% now it's really important when
267.12s: we're quoting volatility like this to
269.88s: differentiate between upfront V for this
272.68s: front expiration and V for the
274.52s: underlying itself when people standardly
277.56s: quote volatility they'll standardly
279.72s: quote this 102 or you know it was a
282.48s: little bit lower earlier today that it
284.32s: was sub 100 but that's for 30-day Vault
287.52s: that's forward looking and it's using a
290.00s: month we can get more specific than that
293.12s: with options chains by looking at
295.52s: internal expirations from that standard
299.84s: expiration cycle about 30 days out
301.84s: somewhere in here and you can see that
312.09s: [Music]
315.80s: 136.28 th000 calls against 153,000 puts
321.28s: that expire this week this is expanded
324.68s: day over day as compared to Contracting
326.92s: which is really interesting because
329.12s: expiration is a few days away here the
332.52s: over half of the total call oi is in
336.52s: this Friday's expiration that is
339.32s: unequivocally a recipe for volatility
342.24s: you're going to see it and we are seeing
345.24s: it it is what it is so that being said
349.52s: when I see the movement here in GameStop
352.68s: I see literally nothing that I can
354.92s: directly point at other than some
357.00s: interesting sympathetic moves with some
359.08s: interesting other names this is why I
362.44s: talk about technical analysis being
364.76s: something that you can Loosely apply to
366.96s: GameStop you cannot apply standard
369.80s: technical analysis to GameStop because
371.44s: it does not follow the
374.24s: standard behavior of supply and demand
378.20s: because for this to happen there has to
381.08s: be an excess of Supply that is built up
385.12s: typically driven by some sort of news
387.24s: event overall volume today was 11
392.24s: .76 11.77 mil which
396.68s: is a little bit over the 5day average
400.48s: which is 8.8 and over the 20-day average
403.76s: which is
404.76s: 10.6 so big
407.52s: expansion in volume on a relative basis
410.52s: mostly sell side no surprise and this
413.76s: thing just got absolutely punished on
415.96s: what looks to be absolutely no news now
419.12s: the good part volatility is alive that's
422.60s: not all bad the reason why that's not
425.40s: all bad is because it offers a lot of
428.04s: different opportunities for positioning
430.68s: and adjusting existing positions
432.44s: especially for us options Traders I made
434.32s: a bunch of adjustments to my GameStop
436.40s: position today that we will talk about
437.84s: in just a few seconds I want to take a
439.68s: look at this front expiration cycle
441.76s: though look at the buildout the net
443.96s: change in oi over yesterday into today
446.16s: is massive we're seeing lots and lots of
449.64s: new options flowing into this thing on a
453.60s: really shortterm basis we are not seeing
455.68s: anywhere near that scale on the put side
459.20s: so then who stands to benefit from this
461.56s: there's not a bunch of open options in
463.60s: the front exploration that are set to
465.88s: take advantage of this so then that begs
467.88s: the question what was opened recently
470.56s: was there anything that stuck out to me
472.56s: from a recent options entry
475.88s: perspective and not really because is if
479.96s: we isolate this to puts over the last
483.00s: couple days there really wasn't that
484.76s: much going on there really wasn't
486.44s: there's obviously some being bought but
488.08s: nothing big nothing that would lead me
490.12s: to believe that somebody knew something
491.84s: and is trying to front run a big order
493.36s: via derivatives at least in the short
495.20s: term so that part's also kind of
498.36s: interesting I'm not seeing any big
499.92s: artifacts popping up from the options
502.08s: chain that would indicate that so what
504.84s: do we do from here well first it's
507.80s: always good to understand what we're
509.12s: Trading and the behavior of GameStop and
512.00s: the fact that it does not comply with
514.56s: normal supply and demand rules because
516.60s: part of it is we can see that there are
519.08s: some clear signs of manipulation we also
521.40s: know that this is a highly volatile
523.16s: stock we also know that this is coming
525.20s: up on one of the biggest options
527.12s: expirations that it's had in some time
529.80s: with over 500,000 calls expiring this
532.48s: week that's going to cause a certain
535.16s: level of volatility what I also found
537.92s: interesting is if we take a look at at
539.92s: just overall gamut exposure we can see
542.24s: that there's obviously a tremendous
545.08s: amount of exposure at the 30s and we can
548.56s: see that dealers are likely net long
552.52s: gamma so their hedging Behavior really
555.52s: shouldn't be adding massively to Market
558.44s: volatility here but on a big sustained
560.76s: move like this it's going to cause some
563.48s: larger changes in their book but we can
566.20s: also see as we go further up that
568.96s: there's bigger concentrations of gamma
572.04s: and down by where we are now 27 28
575.84s: really light they really isn't a whole
578.52s: lot there so that also is slightly
583.32s: interesting and anomalous to me so I
586.40s: don't see a clear reason and I wish I
588.84s: could discreetly identify something for
590.72s: you but as you know I'm not here to give
594.08s: you bad information I'm here to tell you
596.32s: what I see from my experience in markets
598.76s: and then to decide what you think is
600.92s: going on but this to me doesn't look
603.92s: like it's news driven it doesn't look
605.84s: like I haven't seen any sort of big
608.00s: reports by any big funds that are
610.64s: prospectively selling out their Holdings
612.48s: of the stock but that is one thing we
614.00s: should track going forward is
615.64s: institutional Holdings and if there's
616.88s: any big changes on that side of things
620.52s: so fascinating movement today in
622.44s: GameStop now to talk quickly about a few
626.08s: of those adjustments that I made you'll
628.08s: notice now that we're actually down 100
630.72s: shares so we're sitting on 200 shares
633.84s: with the basis of 2827 so the first
636.64s: adjustment that was made was actually
638.16s: unwinding some of the shares I had a 100
642.24s: that came out from an original basis
644.84s: realistically this should be uh 2431
648.60s: what I do in for this one is I'm using
652.24s: um fifo
653.92s: accounting and literally the only reason
656.72s: for taking some of this down today was
659.44s: to wait and see what the stock does
662.08s: because for this coverage strangle I
663.88s: still only have $225,000 allocated to
666.64s: the trade so it's not much money and I'm
668.68s: still already sitting at 54% utiliz now
672.68s: and you can see that I'm about split
675.04s: evenly with a little Edge in terms of
678.36s: cash secured put requirement and that's
680.48s: because of the volatility I'm purposely
683.00s: getting a little more exposure via cash
686.24s: secured puts at this juncture because
688.76s: volatility is so high so this is
691.44s: designed one to capture hopefully some
695.08s: of this movement but it also will
698.52s: capture some of the V and what I do to
701.72s: manage the equity side of it you can see
704.40s: I already have alerts set so these
707.88s: alerts are just like hey it's starting
709.64s: to go back the other way start buying
712.04s: outright that's the cool part about
714.76s: being a Trader is I can come in and out
717.80s: of things to manage my BAS basis because
720.68s: here's the scenario let's just say
722.80s: GameStop comes all the way back down
725.32s: into this area down here where the point
727.32s: of control is and it's in the 22s I'm
729.52s: not saying it's doing that I just don't
730.72s: know but if it does there's no reason
733.28s: for me to hold on to it at a basis of 28
735.80s: as it comes down here when I can exit on
738.40s: the way down and then regain my exposure
742.32s: at a better basis where I can accumulate
744.44s: a larger position for the same amount of
746.20s: money and then conversely if it starts
749.28s: rocke and go in the other direction just
750.64s: buy it outright and then take it to the
752.28s: upside so this is the difference between
755.04s: a Trader's approach with GameStop is
757.48s: what I'm trying to do is capture profits
760.20s: based on these movements which
761.92s: subsequently allow me to build larger
764.76s: positions without adding any more money
768.00s: I'm I'm literally creating money out of
769.96s: the movement so that's what's going on
772.24s: right now the other thing that you'll
774.04s: notice in addition to those puts I took
777.76s: off I think both of these yeah so I took
780.88s: off the 32s and the 28s and then I
782.92s: essentially Consolidated them into these
786.12s: and then the other thing that I did was
787.84s: take these calls down for about 19 cents
792.32s: and then I offered new calls and the new
795.56s: calls are out in 21 Feb same as the new
798.80s: puts puts are at 26 calls are at 35 35
803.16s: strike is well still well above my basis
804.96s: and I'm still at a 1 to2 ratio so in
807.48s: terms of uh a vault perspective this is
810.56s: in a just really really healthy spot
813.68s: some of these when I copy and paste it
815.40s: over from my primary sheet are wrong
817.20s: like the stock p&l it's because I lock
819.72s: cells but then I move it and it's it's
821.96s: in a different spot on this one which is
824.24s: why um you'll see some of these showing
826.12s: up wrong but I adjusted it because this
828.32s: would be locking in a profit if I ended
830.52s: up getting assigned at 35 with the basis
832.76s: of this so that's the that's the
835.16s: near-term game plan here is to continue
837.52s: running the coverage triangle I took
839.44s: some of the shares down seeing which way
841.84s: the stock decides to go I don't really
843.84s: care which way it goes in the near term
845.40s: to be honest because if it goes up I buy
847.36s: if it goes down once it looks like it's
848.88s: finally setting I I buy so the the game
852.16s: plan is very very simple but what I'm
854.92s: doing is I'm monetizing the movements
857.36s: that we're seeing because if you don't
860.44s: do this from a trading perspective you
863.72s: kind of just hold through these
865.68s: movements and your p&l will change but
867.60s: it's unrealized you're not able to start
870.96s: building a larger position and
873.36s: compounding the position that's really
875.16s: the the whole point here but this break
877.24s: is no good in my opinion it is now in
879.96s: this really big volume node it's the
881.80s: second largest volume node that's on
883.52s: here but to me the level to be beat is
886.36s: here now because once if it falls below
891.76s: this there's nothing there's very very
895.40s: very little support all the way down
897.64s: until it gets down towards here so I
900.52s: don't necessarily foresee that happening
902.64s: just yet I I never know I also didn't
904.76s: foresee this move today happening so
907.04s: just cuz I don't see it coming doesn't
908.76s: mean it won't happen but I do think that
911.76s: there's a pretty good chance that it'll
914.48s: consolidate in here for a while just
916.08s: because there's a lot of people that are
917.32s: willing to willing to transact at these
919.04s: levels so it will be a really really big
922.32s: big open tomorrow to see where this
924.92s: thing sits after hours it ticked up
927.16s: about 10 10 cents so not a big up move
929.72s: at all but it's better than seeing it
931.88s: continuing down in the after hours so
934.92s: that that might show a little bit of
936.64s: strength tomorrow but based on a big
938.72s: move like this they tend to go one or
940.92s: two ways none of this is revolutionary
942.76s: it'll either tend to accelerate
944.24s: massively or it'll likely consolidate
947.16s: one of those two they can come out with
950.24s: like a V and shoot up and out but
952.32s: typically you need news for that and
953.72s: there's no news for this new Jump so we
956.84s: will have to see how it goes as always
959.20s: if there's anything you want me to take
960.20s: a look at let me know be an outlier see
963.40s: you later
