0.68s: what's up everyone quick GameStop update
3.80s: taking a look at the expiration that's
5.84s: coming up primarily because we are
8.32s: nearing the 5th of July and we do have a
12.16s: handful of options that are set to
14.60s: expire so what's been going on here well
17.88s: a lot as you guys know I'm actually
19.64s: doing a live stream with Richard Newton
22.52s: this Saturday at 500 p.m. Pacific time
25.68s: and the goal of that is to spend a
28.08s: little more time learning about this
29.44s: thing and diving into the details we're
31.56s: going to explore some of the cycle
33.76s: theories I have a couple pieces of
35.76s: research that I want to discuss with him
39.24s: as far as the grand Theory of Everything
42.40s: because this is still way too
44.40s: interesting to me so the last couple
47.56s: days we did see some upward drift in
51.48s: price it's nothing super crazy but
55.44s: essentially we had a close two days ago
59.40s: at 20 333 then yesterday we went up to
62.96s: 2398 and then today 2437 so we are
66.04s: getting a little bit of positive drift
68.08s: obviously everything here is so
69.24s: suppressed because of this recent move
71.80s: but volume is anemic which is behind my
75.44s: head so let me move out of the way there
77.36s: you can see volume is just so light in
80.40s: here which is really interesting this
83.00s: also tells me from a broader perspective
85.76s: that if there were a bunch of people
88.36s: trying to short this thing into the dirt
91.24s: they would not have a whole lot of
93.04s: resistance ahead of them because the
94.96s: volume is so light here so the fact that
98.72s: we're basing in here is just very
100.96s: intriguing to me and it's essentially
102.56s: been within this very very tight range
105.28s: from back here on the 10th of June which
108.44s: is very close to ring Kitty's last
111.20s: update which I think if I'm not mistaken
112.80s: was on the 13th here and but we're
117.60s: essentially at like 29 to the upside
119.64s: there and then to the downside here 22
122.08s: is something like that so very very
123.96s: tight range now if we take a look at the
127.60s: options chain here there's a ton of call
133.24s: activity the majority of it is at the
136.72s: ask or higher so these are people that
138.80s: are buying calls there are also people
141.64s: that are buying puts and when I look at
144.60s: the volume for today this is a little
146.52s: bit slower than what we've recently seen
149.08s: so if I kill off this 3 July we look at
151.84s: the 2 July here we were below
154.80s: 200k on the call site for the first time
157.68s: in uh at least a week then on 3 July
161.28s: it's still sub
163.76s: 200k but kind of a little bit lighter
166.56s: than what we saw on 2
168.80s: July so when I look at this I see a
172.08s: couple things I see a a really big
174.12s: position cropping up out here in the
176.84s: 19th July the 125s and this looks again
181.96s: like a very much giant quantity of Lotto
186.20s: buying so if we kill off this quantity
189.28s: restriction and then if we go
191.36s: specifically to the 19th July series and
193.84s: then let's take a look specifically at
196.88s: the
198.96s: 125s what I want to show you is the size
201.12s: of these trades and again they're
202.84s: they're all just very very small the
205.04s: reason why the size of the trade matters
208.12s: is because it gives you some insight as
210.60s: to the entities that might be placing
212.88s: them because it's very rare to have
216.96s: really large institutions placing one
220.32s: Lots five Lots 10 Lots it's kind of a
223.00s: waste of time for them so the majority
226.64s: of volume that I see in here are pretty
229.00s: small positions there are a couple like
230.96s: this here which is 1,28 but it's still
234.52s: only at 13 cents so it's still not a
239.84s: very large dollar value trade is just a
242.32s: lot of contracts because it's so cheap
245.40s: so I'm not sure that there's a ton to
248.16s: read into just yet on these 125s other
250.68s: than there are a gajillion participants
253.96s: that are in it that's very clearly the
256.68s: case here and the most transactions I
259.24s: see definitely are on the on the buy
260.96s: side so again nothing that I write home
264.84s: about but something that I keep an eye
267.40s: on now as far as other larger
271.12s: transactions for today it's really
275.56s: smaller positions now the one issue with
278.48s: time and sales on thinker swim is that
280.48s: it just uses the quantity really it's
282.52s: better to use like a dollar Delta of
284.32s: some sort because there are positions in
286.76s: here that as a dollar value are actually
288.64s: bigger than this one but smaller lot
290.48s: sizes but even with that there's not a
293.32s: ton of them like this one right here
295.40s: this
296.60s: 125 in 16 August if if we grab our handy
301.56s: dandy calculator we take a look at the
303.44s: size so that's 598 time 65 it's a 38
308.24s: $39,000 position so still I would
312.32s: consider that on the small side that's
315.36s: again I
316.48s: like until we start getting over like
319.44s: $150,000 in a position like we're we're
321.64s: talking still pretty small trades
324.00s: especially in something like this now
325.92s: the good part though is with all these
328.00s: different orders coming in at all these
329.72s: different strikes a lot of these are
331.44s: still in the five July unfortunately and
333.32s: the reason why that's unfortunately is
334.64s: because we are very quickly coming up on
337.40s: expiration here and my guess is a lot of
341.00s: this
341.80s: oi that's out here in 5 July is going to
347.08s: just get eviscerated so there's
350.08s: 192,000 calls in here right now GameStop
354.12s: is at 2437 so if we look at everything
357.40s: that's essentially below that a decent
360.52s: bulk of these positions are going to
364.92s: come off and there's a lot of the larger
367.64s: positions here kind of like in this zone
370.88s: now we're not fully building out
373.20s: followon expirations just yet so if we
375.24s: clear these off we look at 12 July
377.12s: that's only 70k 19 July is the next
380.36s: primary this is where most people look
383.44s: like they're moving into and then 16
385.48s: August is still lagging behind so I'm
388.48s: still seeing the overwhelm majority of
390.20s: people playing these really short-term
392.04s: time frames in here I don't think that's
394.40s: anything overly novel at this point now
396.80s: what I think we should do though is
398.04s: check out time and sales but I think we
400.88s: should take a look specifically at the
404.28s: 12 or the 19 July expiration and see
408.52s: what's happening out there and what
410.52s: trends are emerging like
414.76s: that
416.36s: so if we sort these by size so that we
420.04s: can kind of parse through a little more
421.96s: quickly we do have those 125 blocks we
426.36s: do have some in the money 24s these are
429.24s: kind of interesting because again this
431.40s: is a much smaller position here in terms
434.28s: of contract size but in terms of dollar
436.48s: amount this also is not trivial and I
440.32s: want specifically though 19 July let me
443.28s: get that series there we
447.24s: go 125s those are are the busy ones we
450.48s: have that 24 block 125s tons of tons at
453.60s: 125 so unfortunately this is what we've
458.32s: seen a lot of people kind of speculating
460.52s: super far out I'm seeing some in the mid
463.64s: 20s and 30s which is good so if we come
466.00s: out here and we take a look at those
468.04s: standard strikes 25s still relatively
472.16s: heavy oi moderate volume people are
476.00s: building into this though because over
477.80s: yesterday 3500
479.76s: contracts were opened up same thing for
481.88s: the 30s so I'm seeing net positive flows
484.76s: over the last day at least and my
486.48s: assumption would be that that would
487.56s: generally
488.72s: continue interestingly enough that
490.68s: actually surprises me that so many of
492.40s: the 125s came
494.32s: down that's curious makes sense because
497.36s: there's still enough time left in these
498.88s: positions though to to get some of your
500.80s: money back but there hasn't been any
502.40s: sort of massive moves yet and there's
504.48s: still 355,000 contracts out here I find
507.92s: that really interesting with the that's
509.92s: trading options in cir is that they keep
511.56s: going to these super far out of- the-
513.16s: money strikes again they can pay out
516.28s: great if you get your move but if you
518.16s: don't get your move it's just lighting
520.00s: money on fire and it's a generally low
522.24s: probability play so for me it's not how
525.36s: I'm playing it you can see like I'm out
527.12s: here in the 18 October that is by Design
530.84s: the way I trade options is very
532.36s: different than I think a lot of people
534.84s: that are trying to make a quick Buck
536.40s: here last note though take a look at
539.68s: this flattening of open interest this is
542.80s: interesting so we've gone essentially
545.64s: from call oi being at least two two and
548.32s: a half times that of put oi it's
551.16s: flattening massively we're seeing 852k
553.92s: calls against
555.52s: 52 Kuts so we need to see what's going
559.92s: on with this net flow my expectation is
562.88s: that as soon as Gamestop start showing
565.08s: some significant signs of life again
567.76s: that these will start popping off
570.08s: and I also think there's been a moderate
572.08s: amount of distractions if we think about
573.72s: it with everything that was going on in
575.32s: cost today we had chewy going on we have
578.40s: sir like there's just a just a ton of
580.88s: different names getting thrown around
582.60s: and people bouncing all over so I think
584.60s: once this becomes a little bit more of
585.92s: the focus again we'll see more flow into
588.72s: this but overall generally quiet here on
592.60s: the Western Front not a whole lot
595.24s: sticking out to me as always though if
596.72s: anything does I will give you guys an
599.00s: update and if there's any questions
600.32s: anything I should go over let me know be
602.16s: an outlier see you guys later
