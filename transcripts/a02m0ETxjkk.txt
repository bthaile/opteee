0.00s: When good just is not good enough, today I got three things on our agenda.
5.76s: The first one is Nvidia.
7.56s: The second one is chewy because they both had earnings today.
10.60s: And then the third one is the hometown favorite.
13.04s: We'll take a quick look at GameStop, although it's still pretty quiet in there.
16.76s: So what's going on in Nvidia?
18.60s: Well, it is all over the map.
21.08s: And this is kind of a really good example for earnings.
24.76s: If you've been watching my videos over the past couple days, last two days specifically
28.12s: where I've been highlighting Nvidia, one of the things I talked about was the importance
32.16s: of Nvidia to deliver near perfectly.
36.00s: And what that meant is even though it had a great quarter, if we take a look at its EPS,
44.00s: it came in at $0.68 against $0.59 expectation.
49.04s: It beat on EPS.
50.88s: If we take a look at its year-over-year revenue, gross margins, operating income, income,
56.56s: diluted earnings per share, everything, it's up.
58.88s: It's up massively year-over-year.
61.68s: Quarter-over-quarter, it's up.
63.56s: It's done exceedingly well.
65.68s: Gross margins came down a little bit, but operating income came up, net income came up.
69.68s: So what's going on here?
72.04s: Well, this is again a good case study in earnings and how they work because I think a lot of retail
78.12s: traders mistakenly believe that if a company beats earnings, it should go up.
83.36s: And that's not at all the case.
84.72s: This is a company that beat earnings that absolutely smashed it, both on a quarter-over-quarter
88.96s: and year-over-year perspective.
90.80s: And it's down.
92.00s: It closed at $125.61, announced trading just below $1.18.
96.40s: So what's happening here?
97.80s: This is a couple things that are really important to understand.
101.00s: And this is a good product to look at it through the lens of.
105.12s: So first thing is when we're looking at earnings, it's important to understand the ratings
109.68s: system.
111.08s: And there are a ton of conflicts of interest baked into a stock or earnings rating system.
117.68s: Stock analysts that typically work for big banks that often hold the stocks that they're
123.60s: rating are the ones that come up with these numbers.
128.60s: They say, okay, based on what it's doing in its history, it should come in at $59.07
134.20s: estimated EPS.
136.20s: Cool.
137.20s: Six story, bro.
138.72s: So then why is it all the time that if we take a look at a density of S&P 500 earnings
144.32s: releases, and we take a look at the percentage of those releases over the last 10 years,
149.92s: and we say, what's the percentage of earnings releases in S&P 500 stocks over the last 10
155.40s: years?
156.40s: Where we have either a beats expectation, meets expectation, or is less than expectation,
162.80s: why is it that the overwhelming majority beat expectation?
166.88s: I don't really think it's because we're that bad at guessing.
171.64s: We're not not great, but we also can figure out how to put a rocket ship on the moon when
177.72s: things are all moving together somehow magically, and then also get it back.
182.04s: We can do that.
183.44s: But somehow if we look over the entire history of all these stocks, we overwhelmingly see
189.60s: beats instead of meets expectations.
192.44s: I think we could be a little bit more accurate if we wanted.
194.60s: So why aren't we?
196.24s: It's because we're not incentivized, we being the analysts.
200.92s: So two things go on.
202.72s: The first thing is again, that conflict of interest I highlighted from the beginning,
206.52s: where they're straight up incentivized to make the stocks look better, because a lot of
211.20s: them hold the very stocks that they're reporting on.
214.64s: So they wanted to look better, so it goes up.
216.72s: The second thing is there's no benefit to being the more accurate analysts.
222.28s: They're actually incentivized to be around the herd, to be around the pack.
226.76s: Otherwise you end up like Kathy Wood, who is obviously somebody that got skylined for
233.00s: all of her great ideas and all these really cool things she's doing.
236.60s: And then when whatever she's doing stops working, she's now the laughing stock of the town
240.96s: nobody can take her seriously.
242.84s: You know who's not in that scenario?
245.56s: The hedge fund manager that's been there underperforming the S&P 500 for 40 years, but he's
251.20s: kind of just underperforming by 2%.
253.96s: So he can take his cut, go grab his yacht.
256.20s: He's not incentivized to outperform.
258.12s: It's the same thing when it comes to analyst accuracy.
261.16s: They're not incentivized to be super accurate.
264.08s: They're actually highly incentivized to group around one another.
267.88s: So then if there's a big giant miss, everybody get it wrong.
272.44s: Something crazy happened that nobody saw coming.
274.56s: Whereas in this, if somebody tried to be super accurate and then that one person was
278.20s: wrong, they've just skylined themselves.
280.56s: They've just put them in the scenario to be the laughing stock of the town instead of
283.72s: just being able to collect their money and move on.
286.12s: What I guarantee you is that if they were paid based on their accuracy, these numbers
290.88s: would be a lot better.
292.08s: But this goes all the way back to the earning system.
293.96s: It's kind of like a game of softball.
295.96s: So when we're recounting the past quarter, we already have a lot of ideas on how we've
302.00s: done.
303.00s: We again, being the business itself.
305.48s: We have some ideas.
307.00s: Usually we can see the footprints of a well performing business, the way that it's impacting
311.64s: the way it's selling, how prevalent it is, yada, yada, yada.
314.28s: Like there's a lot of cues that tell us how a company is doing.
318.56s: And we have analysts that tend to continue providing update on the life cycle of the company
323.96s: throughout the quarter.
325.36s: So when we're going through an earning cycle, understanding the incentive structure,
329.92s: really what we care about are two things.
333.76s: Big deviations from expectations, so big surprises that somehow slip through, forward guidance.
342.80s: Forward guidance is new information.
345.16s: It's hot off the press and it's information that now helps us discount the future value
351.76s: of a stock.
353.08s: So all of this coming back to Nvidia.
356.32s: As I've talked about in the past two videos, if we look over the last two years on an
360.48s: adjusted basis, the stock has gone from 1081 to $140 and no, it's not a penny stock.
367.24s: This is a mega cap stock.
370.12s: It's huge.
372.68s: This kind of movement is very cool to see.
375.72s: As you start getting into these more parabolic phases like this here, there is now a new mandate.
383.72s: You have to deliver near perfectly in order to be considered still on track.
392.80s: They have to be perfect.
395.20s: And as we look through in via earnings while they were damn good, they're not perfect.
402.52s: And there's a couple things in here that start to cause some concerns like this here.
408.76s: So you can see that investors are concerned over how strong AI is going to persist and
414.80s: obviously Nvidia's ability to continue delivering against that.
420.96s: So it's small things like that.
423.04s: Like literally when you're looking at something like this company that has had the growth
427.20s: that's had that is if you look through all of this, it looks so good.
430.16s: It's got a $50 billion share buyback coming out.
433.84s: Like it's crushing it.
436.00s: Market doesn't care.
437.12s: The market had priced in this absolutely insane trajectory that was obviously sooner or
444.36s: later going to have to slow down in order for this stock to reasonably consolidate to deliver
450.68s: the value that we're now discounting out into the future so that it kind of like makes sense.
455.84s: So again, we close at 125 61 and now we're down in the 116.
459.80s: It's still not a big prop, right?
461.68s: It's a hundred twenty dollar product and it's down about ten points.
464.72s: So not even ten percent yet.
466.92s: However, if I look at the overall story here, it's a great lesson in earnings, how to
475.28s: think about earnings and how to interpret earnings because I think so many people get
481.16s: it wrong and they look at this plainly and they say, wait a minute, 68 is higher than 59.
486.76s: Why would this crash for all of those reasons I just explained?
489.88s: Now during the live session later today, we'll go way deeper into the earnings release itself.
493.96s: I'm going to pull up the earnings presentation so that we can learn because this is a fascinating
498.52s: company at a fascinating point in time that I think is worth deep diving a little bit into.
504.04s: Now another company with another example is Chewie and this is another fascinating one
510.24s: because let's take a look at this.
512.64s: Its previous earnings came in, it was expected at four cents and it came in at thirty one.
520.88s: Huge beat, that's way off, not even close.
524.16s: And in that scenario, we saw this massive gap up from sixteen essentially to nineteen
530.72s: and then it ran all the way up to over twenty.
534.24s: Big move following this giant earnings beat.
538.24s: Then we have another very interesting scenario where we were expected at three cents and we
544.52s: came in at twenty four cents, another massive EPSB massive yet we're up eleven percent
553.32s: today.
554.64s: That's it.
556.32s: To me, I was entirely underwhelmed by the movement today for this, that's a huge beat,
563.08s: that's huge.
564.08s: A recent versus twenty four, again, not even close, this massive beat.
569.64s: But again, this shows you the incentive structure.
572.52s: If you look at this past when you're like, okay guys, well, we guess it was going to
575.48s: be four and it came in at thirty one.
577.20s: We probably got to get that a little better next time.
579.36s: Okay, boss, well, for this one, I think it's going to be three cents, right?
585.16s: Now I want to be clear, you can't compare quarter over quarter directly.
590.64s: There is a difference between the circumstances in a quarter over quarter versus a year over
596.00s: year comparison.
597.00s: That's why it's really important to look at both because the environment where we're
600.88s: at in an economic cycle, all of that impacts the earnings, which is exactly why you'll
606.48s: generally see both of those quarter over quarter in year over year.
611.08s: So quarter over quarter, we still did a great job here.
613.68s: We came in at twenty four cents.
615.00s: I actually haven't come back this far, but let's see, this was expected at negative six
618.40s: cents came in at fifteen.
620.12s: And this came in at negative three cents and positive fifteen, right?
623.92s: Like how is an analyst that off that regularly?
629.60s: Imagine if this was anybody else's job and you, whatever you did, depended on being even
634.88s: marginally close to this and you were this far off, a weatherman would get fired faster
640.20s: than this and a weatherman or person, sorry, is never right anyways.
644.24s: They're always wrong too, because they're trying to get the weather.
647.28s: So this is just another really fascinating example of markets and all these small intricate
655.20s: nuances about how they behave, how we frame things, these conflicts of interests and the
661.12s: way that underlying move in response to what seems to be in this case a massive outperformance.
669.16s: But the market just did not really care about it on this again, twenty cent outperformance,
676.52s: even higher than that, twenty cent plus outperformance.
679.80s: The market gave us eleven percent move and of that eleven percent, if we look at the
684.08s: volume today, forty three percent of that volume was sale volume.
689.56s: So it's like to me, it's comical really is what it boils down to.
693.80s: It's comical and it makes sense to me why so many investors would look at this and be
698.16s: confused because again to the uninitiated, it makes no sense and I got to be honest with
703.44s: you.
704.44s: Even for the initiated, I've been a market is my seventeenth year.
707.44s: It still doesn't make sense dog.
709.16s: I don't know how we could be this off for this long, but again, joking aside, it goes
713.68s: back to the incentive structure and it goes back into why it's so important to have a keen
719.16s: eye and a discerning interpretation of things.
722.84s: You cannot take much of life let alone the stock market at face value.
728.04s: And I noticed that as I continue to get older and older that there's so much nuance that
733.64s: I used to miss as a younger dude that's kind of just taking things at face value and
738.24s: trying to process a lot of stuff super fast.
740.96s: This is another great example of that.
743.12s: So I thought the earnings in here was also interesting again on the live session later
747.04s: today.
748.04s: We'll pull up the actual earnings report and go through it.
750.44s: So the last thing I want to take a look at is GameStop and it's for two reasons.
754.32s: One, we broke down below the support which I don't love at all.
758.04s: We did see volume tick up just a little bit 5.1 mil against the 20 day average of 5.3
764.52s: which still slightly below but still a tick up at the vast majority of the sale volume
768.52s: 98%.
769.52s: So what this looks like to me is now we're entering a bit of a value area.
773.88s: I would fully expect this to drift down towards this 18 handle unless again, there's some
779.40s: sort of catalyst or news.
781.56s: This looks like the likely direction for us to go because I'm just using where I'm seeing
786.24s: people wanting to buy the stock and there's a giant gap here.
790.04s: So when there aren't bidders coming in to move the stock up that typically leads us to
794.04s: fall down and that's kind of what I'm expecting here.
797.88s: And then the next volume node that's series that all is down here at like 15 25 15 50
803.32s: somewhere in there.
805.04s: So we'll see how it goes as per usual I always say something like GameStop is fascinating
809.24s: because it doesn't abide by normal rules and as soon as there's some sort of meaningful
814.64s: catalyst that we completely can undo every little bit of this down move and you can run
822.20s: up and literally start moaning just because of a change in circumstance, which is again,
829.32s: it's kind of what makes things like GameStop or other meme stocks.
834.44s: So interesting is how fast these small to mid cap companies can pivot, which is more
840.44s: akin sometimes to much smaller cap stocks, but these things can start flying again.
845.24s: We went from nine to 65.
848.16s: So it's like, yeah, this thing can move as soon as it wants.
851.04s: It's a month timeframe that it made that move.
853.64s: So keep an eyeball on it.
856.48s: That's all I can say.
857.48s: That's what I see here.
858.48s: Now the other thing I do want to highlight because I finally feel vindicated is this
863.24s: here.
864.24s: So earnings is now confirmed for the 10th after the market closed.
868.32s: And this is what I was talking about on Sunday.
