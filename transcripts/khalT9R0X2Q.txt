0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.00s:  Hey yo, what's up our
120.00s:  Just got one of these.
122.04s:  No idea how it works, but my hope is to be able to use this during some of these live
127.68s:  streams to make it easier to come up with timestamps since I don't have the time to watch
132.62s:  through a live stream and come up with timestamps.
135.32s:  And I haven't found a AI tool that does a good job at it yet that's like accurate and
141.48s:  not more time consuming than me doing it myself.
144.80s:  So we have this little nifty thing and a lot of languages, I only speak one of them,
153.76s:  a lot of languages.
155.00s:  So should be fun.
156.60s:  I'll tinker with this a little bit later.
158.80s:  How is the first trading day of the year for everybody pretty solid?
163.28s:  I did not spend a lot of time trading today, although I did put on a couple positions.
170.12s:  I was actually cruising around this really, really cool spot that's local to us.
177.00s:  It's called Lions Tigers and Bears.
180.00s:  And it's like a massive animal sanctuary.
183.76s:  And we actually got to hang out with two tigers, well, a bunch more than that.
188.96s:  But these two tigers specifically are from the Tiger King.
194.56s:  So when Tiger King got shut down, this sanctuary ended up helping and grabbing a couple of
201.84s:  the tigers and not a lie, I thought it was kind of hilarious that it's from the Tiger
207.36s:  King.
208.36s:  I did watch that series on Netflix.
209.36s:  It was pretty damn, pretty damn entertaining.
213.36s:  For better or for worse, it was pretty entertaining.
215.24s:  That dude's, that dude is something.
218.48s:  So pretty neat, excited to see if I can figure out how to use this new thing.
222.80s:  That's one of the fun things actually, to be honest, about me doing YouTube and trying
226.52s:  to be a content creator for everybody is I enjoy trying to learn new stuff about what
237.80s:  I'm doing and new tools, new technology like this thing doesn't seem like it's going
244.68s:  to be too crazy, but it's all new and it's all a continual learning process, which is
249.24s:  I think pretty fun.
250.24s:  So yeah, kind of stoked on that.
253.36s:  So that is where we are at today.
258.08s:  Now let's get over to the main screen.
260.88s:  We'll run through our standard market update and then we'll pop over to like a focus topic
267.56s:  for today.
268.56s:  And then at the end of the stream, this was actually one of the recommendations from
272.60s:  the recent round of feedback that I was soliciting from everybody to help me make this whole
278.12s:  thing better.
279.12s:  Because I'm actually going to start including a trading tip of the day.
284.04s:  So the very first trading tip of the day will be at the end of the stream.
288.84s:  So you'll have something specific to walk away with hopefully that's useful.
292.84s:  They're not going to be like huge things because I have to come up with one of them for
295.72s:  every single one.
296.72s:  But I hope it will be generally useful to you.
302.00s:  So let's see who we got.
303.80s:  It's like we got Tommy, compelled cat Andrew James and we got why not great to see everybody.
313.40s:  Cool.
314.40s:  Let me grab this chat.
315.92s:  Pop it up out the way so that I can keep an eyeball on you guys here.
323.60s:  And let's dig through the market.
327.44s:  I did, by the way, grab some more lunar finally.
334.68s:  So I wanted to get it obviously on this down tick, but wasn't in a spot to do so.
340.44s:  So I grabbed it today and we need to set an update alert here.
346.24s:  Run that below.
347.56s:  All right.
348.56s:  Now, oh, interesting.
350.04s:  The market's up quite a lot a little more than I would have expected.
354.52s:  So let's take a stroll and see.
356.56s:  I said, P500 down day, well, down day across the board, I WM via Russell 2000 about flat
364.40s:  on the down day.
365.40s:  It's actually up just a little bit over the prior day.
367.76s:  So even though it did have a down day, it's showing a little bit more relative strength.
371.12s:  And that's probably because it's already been pushed down to a relative extreme it.
375.60s:  It at least says it sits now.
377.80s:  Vix did pop just a little bit, but it's still pretty light, bond sideways, Bitcoin, slight
384.24s:  up tick generally sideways.
386.76s:  Then we have, oh, interesting.
388.60s:  These guys hit a new load today.
390.20s:  XLB hit a new load today.
393.28s:  That's actually kind of interesting.
395.80s:  XLB.
396.80s:  Yeah.
397.80s:  So materials is, this is breaking out to the downside, like pretty massively.
406.04s:  Right.
407.04s:  So it was consolidating here, broke down to the downside and it's accelerating.
412.32s:  So this is still, it's seemingly early stages of the fade.
417.64s:  It's running into this point of control here, which is pretty light.
422.96s:  And then on a shorter term time frame, they're just ain't much.
426.72s:  That's interesting.
428.20s:  Pretty significant weakness in materials, builders kind of call it, whichever you feel
433.32s:  like.
434.40s:  But a little weaker than I would have expected.
438.76s:  Some services, outflat, energy, gap up, smaller up move, financial sideways, industrial sideways,
450.92s:  starting to break out to the downside as well.
454.60s:  And then technology starting to break out to the downside as well.
461.16s:  That's actually not great.
462.84s:  This is not great.
467.68s:  People's new three month low real estate sideways, you till yeah.
474.32s:  So this, this is very similar to what we've talked about quite a few times now.
483.00s:  And in a broad nutshell, it still looks like the market is in a rotation component.
492.64s:  We have some things that are starting to stabilize.
496.72s:  We do not have large representation of that so far.
501.52s:  So really, really interesting beginning of the year price behavior.
505.72s:  So I actually need to update one of my trackers really quick with all of the open prices
510.48s:  for the first day of the year.
512.60s:  So we opened at 589 39 in spy.
517.12s:  So 589 39.
520.16s:  Then in I W M, we opened up at 2293 to two.
529.12s:  Oops.
530.12s:  So up 2293 and then in cues.
538.12s:  We opened up at 514 30.
542.56s:  514.3.
545.12s:  What I do is in a Google sheet, I have a small little calculator for market performance.
551.08s:  And I just run that.
553.56s:  And it allows me to track how we progress over the course of a year like a 1721 open on
559.36s:  VIX is actually pretty high for January or those that don't know.
564.08s:  It's less time specific, but January is actually a little more mellow than that.
568.88s:  Interestingly enough, then TQs.
573.12s:  TQs opened at 8054.
576.36s:  That's literally double what it opened at last year.
580.76s:  And then you pro opened up at 9007 and then diamonds, which I don't care about at all.
603.48s:  423.8 or 23.8.
609.96s:  And then last is TLT for the tracker, TLT and TLT opened up pretty low here 878 over
620.40s:  10 points lower than last year's open.
623.72s:  Interesting on that, huh?
625.32s:  So if we look at TLT over a year period, I mean, it had a pretty nasty rollover from
636.08s:  its start around 98.
638.52s:  So if you're a holder of TLT for the year, it just did not, did not look that great.
645.80s:  And I don't think anybody was surprised by that.
648.04s:  I played a couple of the moves in TLT opportunistically, but we just know that bonds right now,
655.12s:  not the place to be in general.
657.84s:  Now the other thing I wanted to look at was SSO because I'm looking at running the coverage
668.84s:  triangle and here rotating a small section.
672.20s:  I'm figuring out how I want to configure the portfolio.
675.28s:  It's either going to be spy and you pro.
678.08s:  It might be that combination.
679.52s:  The reason why I do it that way is I can still gain the amount of leverage that I want
684.08s:  for the total sum of money, but they're both way more liquid.
687.80s:  So what I can do is I can trade, let's say, two thirds in spy one third, a little more
693.80s:  than that one third in you pro.
697.36s:  And for that aggregate amount of money, it essentially will behave as two times leverage
704.00s:  versus three times leverage.
705.24s:  Now you don't get rid of the individual risk you run in the product itself.
711.40s:  In this case, you pro being three times leveraged.
714.08s:  If there is a massive down move, it can go insolvent.
718.88s:  That is a thing.
720.28s:  Now I don't think it would be the case for something like you pro because it holds such
724.36s:  a massive amount of assets under management, but that doesn't mean that it's impossible
730.40s:  to happen.
731.40s:  So that's the way that I try to balance gaining the liquidity that I want, but then also
738.36s:  gaining the overall exposure that I want in terms of leverage for the coverage strangle
744.72s:  without stepping too far in front of the bus by going all in on you pro, all in on TQs
752.64s:  or whatever it is.
754.00s:  I just wrapped up the coverage strangle portfolios for last year from when I started for
760.76s:  like the last quarter or so.
762.76s:  And I'll do an update video at some point that walks through everything for the coverage
770.20s:  strangle that I ran in TQs and you pro.
773.16s:  And I'll still run like I said, a portion of it, but I'm probably going to be scaling
778.60s:  them down in favor of something that I can run a little longer term because I prefer
788.24s:  to gain leverage via options versus the product itself when the leverage is built into the
793.84s:  product itself, there's a little more costs associated.
796.52s:  It's just not as simple or efficient because you have to maintain it via options.
802.12s:  So that's the leverage stuff that we're looking at right now.
807.32s:  Let's get back in here and take a look through anything else that sticks out to us specifically.
814.56s:  Back was definitely interesting utilities about flat.
820.28s:  And then this is interesting actually discretionary discretionary is finally starting to roll over.
826.64s:  So the reason why that matters is discretionary had been holding things up for a while as
833.72s:  something like staples was rolling over preemptively.
837.88s:  And now we see discretionary holding the line a little bit here.
843.24s:  And then as of what the 27th of December, it's really starting to accelerate to the downside.
849.00s:  It's had five consecutive down days.
851.48s:  So that looks like general weakness to me.
856.56s:  That's what I pick up here.
857.92s:  Now I am interested that from a futures perspective that the futures are up a little bit here
864.72s:  that just surprises me.
866.60s:  Also, I think I need to make sure I save this grid before we move, update that.
872.08s:  And then let's take a look at the truth.
875.92s:  Yeah, so e-minis are grabbing a little bit, seeing with cues, rustle, vix is coming down
884.36s:  just a little bit not much.
888.56s:  Ten year, thirty year, about flat, bit coins still, crude oils, picking up just a little
898.72s:  bit and that gas came down.
900.80s:  That's the short term move that I traded.
903.40s:  I think when we did the pro livestream, whenever that was, I literally put the trade on while
908.28s:  we were on the stream together.
910.44s:  And that was a pretty robust trade that just happened to move quite a bit actually
918.04s:  interestingly enough.
919.48s:  So looking over my portfolio and where things sit now, I'm still long overall market
926.36s:  deltas.
927.36s:  So it is time to start shopping.
930.52s:  Now I also owe you all that video about the GameStop covered strangle.
936.68s:  The only thing that I haven't fully dialed in is the size of the trade that I'm going
940.76s:  to use.
941.76s:  I was originally using 10k that was based on the poll that I did during one of the GameStop
949.48s:  live streams where we essentially ask like what's the average holding.
952.60s:  So in the whole point of me creating this portfolio, that's not really a portfolio, but
956.80s:  this allocation is so that people can see how to trade a typical amount of money for
965.04s:  a GameStop which again when I saw it was like 10k or something like that.
969.20s:  Now it's flexible because the way that I'm doing it is I already have a small allocation
975.00s:  of GameStop.
976.00s:  It's definitely quite a bit more than that.
978.12s:  But I'm just pulling some shares essentially and tracking them separately than the shares
983.88s:  that are just buy and hold into perpetuity.
987.24s:  So for anybody that trades GameStop, those are, I'm just looking to get your preference
994.40s:  for the covered strangle strategy that I'm going to trade in GameStop and specifically
1001.84s:  what amount of money or what size do you prefer it to be.
1006.92s:  And it's really, it can be anything.
1009.72s:  But the goal we're doing a small amount of money is for it to be more accessible and
1018.00s:  relevant to people that are holding GameStop.
1021.28s:  So see, and this is the thing, right?
1024.76s:  So like TCM King is saying 100k, which is fine, but the problem is I just don't think
1029.92s:  most people have $100,000 with a GameStop.
1031.92s:  Do you even have $100,000 with a GameStop?
1034.44s:  Lauren says 5k, like that's the thing is based on the couple polls that I did already,
1040.80s:  it seemed like a smaller allocation.
1044.76s:  Rantiddy says full port, like a true DGEN.
1047.96s:  And that's the thing is like for people that are, what, again, I don't care what the allocation
1053.56s:  is because I don't, I don't think anybody would have honestly an allocation in GameStop
1057.52s:  at least here other than Ruin Kitty, Ruin Kitty definitely is the Trump card.
1061.28s:  But I don't think anybody in the chat would have an allocation in GameStop that's bigger
1065.28s:  than the portfolio.
1067.00s:  So yeah.
1068.00s:  Alex says I got 3,500 in calls.
1072.40s:  Yeah, so that's more like a ratio of diagonal, which is fine.
1077.92s:  BW says we'll make a lot more money shorting GME than playing calls on it.
1081.76s:  That's a great way to get caught in burnt alive.
1086.84s:  Lauren says GME is more than half my portfolio.
1088.92s:  Well, when it comes to whatever allocation makes sense to you, that's okay.
1092.40s:  But that's why I'm asking for a dollar amount because here's the thing is I want it to be
1096.88s:  something that people, when they look at it, they're like, oh, yeah, I could do something
1100.60s:  like this.
1101.80s:  If it makes sense for me and the whole point is to show an example by doing very similar
1107.60s:  to what I was doing with the coverage strangle on the leveraged ETFs.
1111.08s:  Now, it's boring.
1112.08s:  There's not a lot to talk about because the way that I built the coverage strangle is
1116.36s:  a strategy for myself is that it's not that intensive.
1119.20s:  You don't have to do that much with it.
1120.44s:  That's literally by design.
1122.92s:  But I don't want the coverage strangle to be something that's just kind of like random
1130.56s:  and stuff that people would look at and be like, okay, yeah, that's cool or whatever.
1135.04s:  Yeah.
1136.84s:  So the idea is the same way that we train people in the military, right?
1141.48s:  It's like show by doing, not by telling.
1144.24s:  So that's what I'm trying to piece together for this.
1147.76s:  So James says 2k, or into these 200 shares.
1153.00s:  Guys says 5700 shares.
1156.76s:  Lauren says relatable is good.
1158.08s:  It's how I learn best.
1159.08s:  And I think that would be the case for something like this.
1161.92s:  Definitely.
1162.92s:  Yeah.
1163.92s:  BW says, I made money 20k on shorting unity because of the dumb GameStop people who piled in easy
1171.04s:  money.
1172.84s:  I mean, that's just objectively false.
1177.12s:  You might have gotten lucky on a trade and had something go in your favor, but I don't
1181.96s:  know much about unity, but just about anything can go in any direction for any reason.
1186.28s:  So you could have easily just gotten ripped apart to the other direction.
1190.08s:  Actually, unity continues to go up.
1192.44s:  So I have no idea how you made 20k on this unless you top ticked it and bottom ticked it,
1200.12s:  which I just doubt from a statistical perspective, super, super unlikely.
1206.72s:  26.
1208.52s:  So you're, hold on, you're in here talking about a $3 move.
1213.16s:  Oh, boy.
1215.96s:  Here's.
1220.96s:  Okay.
1223.96s:  All right.
1224.96s:  Whatever floats your boat.
1227.96s:  Now, back to actual trading.
1236.96s:  Roryntady says, still got my eye watching serve looks like make or break time.
1241.96s:  Let's take a look.
1242.96s:  You mean, SRV, yeah.
1246.96s:  SRV.
1249.96s:  I don't think so.
1250.96s:  I don't think this is make or break at all.
1253.96s:  This looks like it's just continuing to consolidate.
1256.96s:  That's what I'm, that's what I'm seeing here.
1258.96s:  It's been consolidating for some time now.
1260.96s:  It's still posting higher lows.
1263.96s:  So I actually feel differently about it.
1266.96s:  I feel like this looks generally okay here.
1273.96s:  I mean, it's not doing anything special, but stocks will always go through these periods of consolidation.
1279.96s:  It's super normal.
1282.96s:  Yeah.
1284.96s:  I don't think that there's anything in here that strikes me as necessarily good or bad.
1289.96s:  I think it's just a little too early.
1292.96s:  It's how, but.
1295.96s:  I think this has, I definitely think this has time.
1298.96s:  I would give it, I would give it a little more time to cook.
1302.96s:  It's definitely running on.
1304.96s:  Runtidy says what I'm saying is if it breaks below a trend line.
1307.96s:  This one, not really now.
1309.96s:  I still wouldn't say that that's a giant deal to be completely honest with you.
1313.96s:  Here's a good example of this.
1317.96s:  In video.
1318.96s:  When you first draw the original trend line in Nvidia, of course, I just changed the tool.
1324.96s:  One second.
1326.96s:  If you draw the original trend line in Nvidia.
1330.96s:  Off of these lows down here.
1333.96s:  Right.
1334.96s:  It's broke down below.
1338.96s:  Pop back up and started running sideways.
1341.96s:  Right.
1342.96s:  So.
1344.96s:  The those kinds of trend lines, they don't, they're not dictatorial.
1349.96s:  Right.
1350.96s:  So when Nvidia pop below this longer term trend line, again, that I just showed you this one.
1355.96s:  It didn't fall off a cliff and like disappear into nothing.
1359.96s:  It just fell down, found support, came back up and has been consolidating since.
1364.96s:  So more importantly for something like serve, it doesn't strike me as like really weak in this region.
1374.96s:  Right.
1375.96s:  There's a ton, a ton of support and resistance in here.
1385.96s:  So that kind of congestion generally leads to continued price activity, just because people are interested at that level.
1394.96s:  So yeah, I, this to me is still something I would want to monitor.
1399.96s:  Right. Like how does it behave around this trend line?
1401.96s:  But yeah, I don't, I don't think so.
1405.96s:  I think it's still okay in here.
1407.96s:  The thing I would be more interested in and personally for serve is if it starts breaking below,
1414.96s:  like all of these different levels, essentially, I'll show you.
1420.96s:  If it starts breaking below all of this, this, this, this, that's bad.
1425.96s:  That would be bad.
1426.96s:  That would be breaking down and running out of the consolidation phase here.
1433.96s:  So I wouldn't be surprised at all to see it continue to chop sideways for some time,
1438.96s:  because that's what it's been doing.
1440.96s:  Even on the up moves, it's been pretty light.
1443.96s:  So it's, it's ran from 11 to 16 big move to be clear for something like this,
1449.96s:  but still a five point move, not like, you know, insane big move, but not insane.
1454.96s:  Then it fell from 16 down to 12.
1458.96s:  Right. So if you look from low to low, it's netting about a dollar.
1462.96s:  That's about what it made here.
1464.96s:  Then it ran from 12 73 to 13 70, so about another dollar, you got out of it here on the rallies.
1474.96s:  So when stocks are moving like this, unless there's a new catalyst or some sort of new information,
1479.96s:  it means that people are interested in accumulating it, but it's just not having parabolic one-sided moves.
1485.96s:  It's likely to continue in a general stairs that pattern like this until we see some sort of news or catalyst
1493.96s:  that might propel it a little more aggressively.
1496.96s:  But it's still definitely, I would consider here, trending up, right?
1500.96s:  It's just not massive.
1502.96s:  You're seeing nice rallies, you're seeing pretty steep pullbacks, but that's normal and stuff like this.
1507.96s:  But net net, it's still trending positive.
1510.96s:  So just might be a little bit slower.
1512.96s:  It's nothing, nothing too crazy.
1514.96s:  I don't think yet.
1516.96s:  But I agree with you though, is that especially because volume is pretty light.
1522.96s:  It's starting to ramp up.
1525.96s:  What's the institutional ownership on served?
1527.96s:  Do you guys know?
1529.96s:  Let me see.
1532.96s:  Let me see if we can find out.
1537.96s:  Look at serve.
1551.96s:  Institutional 19.6 insiders 12.
1555.96s:  This is good.
1556.96s:  So that kind of stuff is actually really, really important because it means like the whole float of the stock is in held up, which is great.
1567.96s:  So yeah, I mean, I think it looks good.
1569.96s:  I think it's slowly, slowly making its way, but I think it looks good here.
1575.96s:  It just needs to maintain.
1577.96s:  I really think the like the really important levels is it needs to maintain this rally in here.
1582.96s:  If it starts falling back through this rally, then that's fair weakness, meaning not something I would be overly eager to step in front of.
1591.96s:  You can already see where I would want to see it start breaking above.
1594.96s:  And this would be the initial break above level, something like this 1770 ish.
1600.96s:  I would want to see it break above that on volume, but it's just taking its time.
1609.96s:  And that's okay.
1610.96s:  As long as it continues to move in the correct direction, that is genuinely ultimately what what matters here.
1618.96s:  BW says I like so far.
1620.96s:  So far was interesting because so far is getting punished a little bit.
1624.96s:  Yeah, I like this.
1626.96s:  I really didn't like.
1628.96s:  But I agree with you BW in general, I this surprises me, be honest to see this kind of pull back because this is starting to be out in no man's land like there's just not much here.
1640.96s:  And we can see the point of control the next volume note is down here.
1646.96s:  And it's pretty light.
1649.96s:  So generally I agree with you I was actually eyeballing trying to get back into so far.
1655.96s:  But I just did not like this this pull back here, you can already see where I had an alert resting for what I need to see it do before I become interested to the other direction again.
1669.96s:  But yeah, this surprised me a little bit.
1671.96s:  I didn't expect to see this kind of weakness in here.
1674.96s:  It seemed it seemed well positioned because here's the thing again pull back for stocks like this.
1682.96s:  They're really, really normal and part of the overall process, but but it's within it's within reason when we start seeing pullbacks that deep and and steep and too far.
1696.96s:  That's what this is starting to do because it's gone from a high of 17 and now it's closing down at 14.
1705.96s:  That's a little too far.
1709.96s:  So we want to see this slow down because 20% plus pullbacks here that's that's literally an internal bear market now again for something like this it holds a slightly different weight because you can see the average true range is 6.2%
1724.96s:  the average for a five day period for a 90 day period it's 4.2%.
1730.96s:  But that's still that's massive compared to its standard moves.
1735.96s:  So VW says market always over reacts.
1740.96s:  I personally don't love generalizations like that.
1743.96s:  I don't fully disagree with you, but from a trader's perspective the market does whatever it does whether it's under react over react properly react.
1752.96s:  It's the market determines the price.
1755.96s:  So whatever the market does we can we can say whatever we want about it, but it doesn't matter that the market is always going to dictate the price whether we think it's over reacted or under reacted.
1766.96s:  I always say that is because that leads to the you know the commonality for traders when they get they feel like oh this thing is pushed down too far this things push down too high or whatever the case is and again the reality is it doesn't matter what we think about it right like it is whatever it is and the market is going to make a decision on it.
1790.96s:  VW says mid cap low cap or more in panic mode completely agree completely completely agree mid cap not so much mid cap is doing fine but yeah small cap completely agree small cap is in the danger zone right now I think small cap it and you can see that represented in
1811.96s:  I WM but again here's the problem for that theory BW says that's why high solve and so fights not it's not from the small cap perspective the reason why say that is because it didn't move sympathetically today with small caps right I WM was down today but modestly so open at 23 closed at 21 so a small move 1% move
1840.96s:  this is and it's consolidating what so far is showing you is that it's doing its own thing it's doing something different and it was consolidating but then essentially from here it's been falling and it's been contracting from the 27th on its own I WM is not doing this right now small caps are not doing this right now so
1862.96s:  so far is doing this right now so this is when we need to pay attention for the like comparing the individual stocks compared to the sector the industries and things like that because it does become relative because I would agree with you if so far had a little bit of a down day
1881.96s:  and I WM was also the same that's normal for stocks to move sympathetically with the index but the fact that this is accelerating a little bit on its own just surprise me.
1894.96s:  BW says I think it could recover tomorrow easily good it could do whatever it wants whatever it wants but again what it what it could do doesn't necessarily matter a whole lot I don't think when we look at potentials here the
1909.96s:  it's just what it's doing right now and I want to be clear like I like so far I think it's a strong company I think that they're a cool company but there's always two parts of my brain there's the trading part of my brain where I'm trying to find things that I can interact with and monetize to make money and then there's the underlying business component which I might like or dislike that's actually one of the reasons why I like trading lunar is because I just really like what they do I think it's cool
1938.96s:  and there's a handful of names like this that I just find the underlying business really really interesting.
1945.96s:  Tyler Stone thank you so much for the five bucks says I'd love to hear your opinion on the QS side chart it is a penny stock not going to be happy okay it's a penny stock but what the fuck did you do to me?
1969.96s:  Shit like this is so hard to give a good answer and it's because it is all over the damn map the problem with stocks like this is the underlying intrinsic value of them is not agreeable at all meaning there's somebody that thought it was worth 61 cents back here 19 in 19 November
1997.96s:  and it's gone from 61 cents to 426 so the problem again the problem with this is when you have stocks like this that are so widely disagreeable in terms of what the intrinsic value the fundamental value of the company is you're going to see moves like this where the five day average true range is 32% and the 90 day is 5%
2025.96s:  so this is I mean I just I don't personally love it so let's do some quick math it has 175 898 692 and it's trading for 426 26 equals this times this
2056.96s:  yeah it's a 750 million dollar company
2062.96s:  so it's I mean it's small it's a really really small company so I yeah from from it so let me summarize my thoughts here because I know that I'm processing a lot so I sound quiet but it's because I'm processing but I want to make it clear
2091.96s:  as to what my position is and why it is what it is so with this kind of company the the technical analysis in my opinion doesn't really matter the reason why technical analysis in something like this doesn't really matter is because the company is so small that it's going to be whatever a small constituent of people decided to be so
2118.96s:  from that perspective you can't apply standard technical analysis to it just like stuff that like GameStop that is definitely driven by like normalized market forces supply and demand constraints and things like this
2136.96s:  because GameStop behaves like that you applying standard technical analysis to GameStop also has to be done really cautiously so like right now I would argue you can apply standard technical analysis to GameStop
2151.96s:  but I would also argue that when it's going through it's really big massive moves you cannot because it has a completely different pricing function associated with it
2162.96s:  so when we're talking about technical analysis I think it's important to go back to the basics on what it's doing and technical analysis helps us understand and identify what the underlying supply and demand is for a company and that supply and demand has to be across a broad marketplace meaning consensus driven pricing
2191.96s:  so for something that's very small like this as you can tell there is no consensus now it looks like something happened on the 20th maybe we could see what that was just at a curiosity
2205.96s:  and let's see what happened with QS let's start from the beginning on
2212.96s:  QS you partner on Proteus I don't know what that is
2218.96s:  I'm planning innovation and they will partner on the development and manufacturing of the quantum size novel pro
2230.96s:  proteomics is that you see this word proteomics proteomics platform proteus
2240.96s:  let me know if I'm saying that right plan innovation has a team of over 400 people and expertise across design development manufacturing and scientific instrumentation and medical devices
2256.96s:  interesting this is the cool part about trading is you get to stumble across companies like this and learn about them but yeah going back to Tyler says agreed I got in around a dollar and was going to hold for long term but the volatility is insane and they recently just partnered to get chips from Nvidia yeah so it's like you kind of do I think whatever whatever you like and whatever fits best but that's always going to be the best
2284.96s:  game with small companies like this it's a numbers game you could put on 50 of these small cap kinds of trades and you hope to win on five of them like that's essentially what it boils down to I generally avoid really low cap companies like this specifically like this small and it's just because standard analysis and standard rules don't really apply and more importantly than all of that
2312.96s:  you run out of liquidity really fast and insider information is going to dominate the price movement of something like this it's going to dominate and you will never be inside you will always be on the outside
2328.96s:  so you're competing against pretty difficult market forces now it looks like it's very bullishly positioned which looks good and again there's nothing wrong with speculating on stuff if you like it but yeah I would just be really really cautious with something like this make sure that it's sized appropriately and you know all that kind of stuff because yeah this just as it doubles
2356.96s:  essentially in price today can half the other way and that will always be the case for small cap stocks like this they're always fun to look at and the other thing I like about looking at stuff like this is some of this is the fun part in my opinion is some of these are going to be the next round of really big successful companies it's just going to be a really small minority of them but some of them will be which is very very cool I always find that fascinating because if we go back to something like apple
2384.96s:  apples one of my favorite favorite long term charts to look at because it's so fascinating we go all the way back and we take a look at what it was back in 85 on a relative basis it was a 10 cent stock
2398.96s:  that's pretty cool that's pretty damn cool that this was a penny stock essentially up until 2000 and then it started to rally up and out and it didn't really start gaining favor until 05 or so this is always very cool to me to look back in eyeball so who knows for something like QSI
2426.96s:  QSI if this is one of those against statistically no because from a statistical perspective the majority of them were not going to but still interesting nonetheless
2440.96s:  Tommy says apple really have to lock up cap and wait yeah and that that's the cool part again for like different approaches to trading and investing because there are absolutely are people who aren't as interested in trading super
2455.96s:  short term and they're okay actually investing for the long haul and the process of investing is exactly what you're talking about Tommy it's being super patient and giving stuff enough time to approximate to whatever the ultimate value is that you think that thing is going to be now the cool part about investing as well is that it generally favors the kind of economy that we have in the US
2483.96s:  which is just expansion based I'm getting my little my little pad things set up I'm excited to mess with this it's an expansion style economy so companies that survive and continue to grow that's why investing tends to work so well investing would work really poorly if we were positioned differently in terms of an economic force but the the basis of what we do and what we have is that it's expansionary and if you want to invest in the
2512.96s:  market and if that changes and that's one of the big concerns with 2025 is does that continue we already looked over an overview yesterday in GEP looks like it's starting to slow down so from that perspective that can that will strongly bleed over into a lot of this stuff including things that are going through IPOs whether or not they choose to IPO
2540.96s:  if they decide to even seek to go public and to try to grow from there it just becomes more oppressive for smaller companies at least and this is why from the thing yesterday it talked about specifically pricing power because things that do have pricing power become very very resilient in markets like this so for QSI looks interesting it looks like it has sponsorship it looks like it's starting to run pretty hard
2568.96s:  it looks like from an options perspective as massive calls you and that's typically going to be insiders because this is super small that most institutions head funds definitely are not going to be playing in this too heavily even larger retail traders like me are not going to be playing in something like this too heavily because it's too small
2586.96s:  and you move the market on yourself but seeing 80,000 calls against what 10,000 or 18,000 puts whatever it was that's massive calls you so people are betting to the upside and see that clear as day
2604.96s:  and I would feel pretty confident guessing that the people that are betting there are institutional insider side of things that kind of know what's going on that would be my guess
2614.96s:  so the next thing we have to look at though is Hindenburg Research came out with a new study today
2625.96s:  this and I want to look through this so let's update this really quick to QSI Hindenburg Research
2645.96s:  just update in the title so people can have an idea of what's going on here
2651.96s:  James says what's the pad thing do that's a great question I have to be honest I don't really know but I was asking chat you PT last night in bed as I was wondering how to make these live streams more navigable for people
2666.96s:  so what I'm doing is my understanding is all these little buttons you can program them to do different things so I'm going to program hopefully
2679.96s:  so that if I press one of these buttons that it will open up a text file and drop a timestamp in there and leave a placeholder for a topic that I could very quickly type in myself during the stream
2693.96s:  so that for anybody that wants to go back and watch prior live streams it would be much easier to navigate because I would love nothing more than to have super accurate timestamps for people because I personally find them very valuable in YouTube
2709.96s:  I just recently this is whole areas I just recently got YouTube premium I didn't have it for the longest time which is weird because I definitely use YouTube a lot
2722.96s:  and it's very reasonable for me to but it's funny to me how the brain determines certain things that are just expensive or cheap and even if you have the means to afford it still primed that way in your brain
2737.96s:  but the process of making timestamps just for me is really arduous because I'm a single person to go back through and you know scroll through a whole live stream to then insert timestamps is just super inefficient is just not worth my time at all
2753.96s:  so it's the kind of thing that I would like to hire out but the problem is is when I try to hire stuff like that out at what I would consider to be a reasonable rate you just get a fucking terrible output it's just not good
2764.96s:  so then that ends up taking the same amount of time to go back through and unfuck everything and there hasn't been a good AI solution yet that's accurate fortunately I've tried a bunch of them so I'm really hopeful that sooner or later that will be a thing
2779.96s:  but until then we have this little black box that hopefully I can just press button it'll open up that thing drop a timestamp and they're automatically I can type in hopefully super fast whatever the topic was and then it will be generally I hope easy to implement copy and paste into the YouTube video description so that you have the timestamps and you guys can find things more easily
2806.96s:  this is also specifically in mind for the pro members because for the pro live streams we cover a lot of like very niche topics and it would be I think really efficient for because a lot of folks from the pro side they'll watch the recordings because a lot of them can't make the streams so yeah we'll see we'll see how it goes there's also a chance that I might set this up so that when I press a button my computer blows up or some shit like that which would be generally unfortunate but I wouldn't pass my I wouldn't put it past the
2835.96s:  myself for that to be potential yes it's it is a potential James says could you do it in Google Sheets and have a cell for time now and then a quick blurb yeah so I think you can program it to essentially hot key to anything I'm just going to use a text file like the notepad but you can set it up I'm going to try to set it up so that it automatically does it in the correct format
2860.76s:  Rointitie says do you use final cut pro I don't use shit I normally just click the button put my ugly face somewhere on the screen and then start rumbling my fat face about stock market stuff I don't use shit so if I can't do it in pre and all people call it post and it sounds really refined and stuff I don't know if you can call it pre but I do zero post anything now I did just hire a new editor
2888.96s:  so I'm a try to work with this new editor a bit and see how it goes actually the first edited video I would love your guys's feedback on I think it comes out the fifth of the Sunday beyond be on the lookout below be on the lookout for an edited video the problem with video editors is there really primed to do things in a way that I actually
2911.96s:  understand from their perspective that it works and it makes sense and they like it but from my perspective I don't like that's just a reality and the reason for that is because they will
2929.72s:  most of them make stuff for like super short term attention span people so the folks that have really really short attention spans and they
2941.16s:  don't know like I just I find that to be more disruptive and distracting than something useful so I have to like dial all that back a lot but then there's also the part of me that understands that in order to continue growing the channel and if I have any chance whatsoever
2958.08s:  hitting my 40k target for the end of this year that's super super aggressive for at least the way my channel grows I'm going to have to do shit differently and continue to experiment with new stuff so
2970.20s:  we'll see how it goes
2971.32s:  for instance he says do it old school burn a hole in the top corner of the screen or throw up a gang sign they can skim and see
2976.76s:  so they know where the time stamp is yeah well then that's it right it's faster for me to click the button
2982.04s:  then to throw up a gang sign and then to make sure that they do it right it's literally quicker for me
2988.36s:  sooner or later my hope is to hire like a full-time assistant once the brand and the platform and all that stuff grows enough
2995.64s:  to help with a lot of this stuff so that I can focus more on hopefully the things that are more meaningful to you guys
3001.56s:  but we are not there yet we still need to grow specifically the patreon a lot because the patreon is really what supports all of this
3008.76s:  the the youtube ad revenue and stuff is negligent I don't even have ads turned on for this so youtube ad revenue doesn't really help me much at all
3017.56s:  so
3019.96s:  um harvies says how did Tim Sykes and his student make their millions then compared to what
3025.64s:  because yeah I'm not sure with actually have no idea what that's in reference to
3035.24s:  all right let's go through this parvana is a 44 billion online car dealer founded in 12
3041.72s:  despite facing bankruptcy risk in 223 stocks by 280 four
3049.08s:  our research including extensive document review and 49 interviews with industry experts
3056.36s:  joe kavanaugh's turnaround is a mirage well let's take a look at carvana and see how it did today a lot of
3061.32s:  times i will fade stuff when this kind of research drops yep that's why because it it almost always does this
3069.56s:  almost always does this we need this
3075.96s:  and uncovered 800 million in loan sale to a suspected undisclosed related party
3081.40s:  all while insiders cash out billions in stock even before considering the findings of our investigation
3088.20s:  carvana is exorbitantly valued trading at 80 845 hits the area code that i'm from in New York
3097.56s:  eight four five a higher sales multiple relative to online car peers car max and auto nation
3104.12s:  and 754 percent premium on forward earnings basis the company has 4.8 billion in net debt
3109.80s:  and is junk rated by ratings agencies interest there really interest
3117.08s:  use vehicle prices declined 20 percent past three years
3123.08s:  sold 3.6 billion in stock after he stopped selling the stock plunge 99 percent
3129.16s:  both three seem trend
3137.40s:  um with carvana shares up to 42 times father earnus garcius sold another 1.4 billion
3147.40s:  has insiders unload stock the company's solvency risks remain almost 26 percent of gross profit
3155.48s:  consistent of sales of consumer auto loans to third parties largely in the risky subprime
3161.96s:  and deep-sumprime space
3167.80s:  you can diversify its on its relationship with ally
3171.08s:  and
3172.44s:  he's
3185.64s:  i don't have an opinion here
3189.64s:  i don't really have an opinion here
3191.80s:  you
3197.80s:  i want to know what like their so what it first the this we think our c is we'll leave shareholders with
3208.76s:  them up at any point carvana's first incredible run they could have de-risked the balance sheet
3218.76s:  by raising significant capital at its then lofty valuations instead they hyped their
3224.04s:  prospects and raised modest capital while garcia the second sold 3.6 billion
3230.84s:  has the numbers tamed they seemingly pulled accounting livers to make them even worse
3239.16s:  interesting i i'm actually very curious how
3243.80s:  effective their researches
3245.40s:  i wonder if we can go back like pretty far go back here
3256.84s:  let's go here
3260.84s:  and i'm actually going to move this out of the way so i can just flip through some charts real quick
3264.68s:  and see opk o
3271.16s:  gone for opk
3275.88s:  and this is from 2018 which is in here
3283.48s:  so plummeted from there
3286.36s:  riot is from 2018
3290.68s:  they
3294.68s:  they can sue for the sole c s s e
3302.76s:  they're gone
3306.04s:  mera
3313.24s:  this is from 18
3315.96s:  they're dead wrong on mera
3320.52s:  so that's what one right three no one wrong three right
3328.20s:  one and three so many keep track for me one and three so far
3331.48s:  the are you the are i u f
3337.40s:  from 2018 yes so they went they went away i don't know why that looks like they got bought out
3344.44s:  or something because in 2018 they were actually doing okay
3355.00s:  i don't know what happened without
3356.60s:  t g l c
3362.52s:  this is also 17 and here's let's another right one
3368.04s:  was that four and one
3376.36s:  l t s
3381.08s:  this one is from 18
3383.56s:  in
3385.56s:  September
3387.56s:  going here
3391.24s:  this also looks wrong it looks like they got bought
3397.48s:  before in two
3399.56s:  and each
3406.28s:  i don't know what happened with them
3408.44s:  mpx
3414.20s:  from 18
3419.80s:  cracked another
3422.12s:  bought on they're super accurate i m px
3427.72s:  from what i've seen so far
3429.48s:  yeah
3431.32s:  super accurate
3433.24s:  aph qf
3436.28s:  aph qf
3439.56s:  i'm going to see if that gpt in summarize a list of tickers for me
3444.76s:  because i mean that's super accurate
3449.56s:  rontady says they put out stock articles and then the stocks tank i don't really think that's the case
3463.40s:  they definitely do tank after they put the articles out but some of them that we looked at
3468.44s:  already that the stock was already declining before the article goes out but i agree with you at
3475.48s:  unequivocally ads fuel to the five mean i shia i told you about today that i
3481.08s:  specifically
3483.40s:  well fade the moves on the day that these come out like a really easy trade
3488.20s:  all right so i'm going to have gpt
3492.04s:  let's run
3495.56s:  create a list
3497.72s:  no i want not four
3500.20s:  book
3500.92s:  i want to use oh one okay create a list of
3510.28s:  pickers that hindenburg research as reported on from their website i'm waiting for these to be
3521.80s:  able to like actually
3524.52s:  web crawl that would be sick
3530.52s:  okay let's see what gpt comes up with
3542.28s:  okay
3542.68s:  so this is giving me page seven so i look like i have to go page by page
3556.28s:  let's try it again
3560.44s:  add this page
3573.08s:  you
3581.08s:  now they have blocked that's interest sq
3587.48s:  add this page
3591.48s:  i'm just going to have it compile it off for us so we can do a little bit of an analysis on
3596.52s:  hindenburg at this page
3612.04s:  there's only 11 page we're already on four at this
3616.68s:  update the list you include all pages so far then add this one
3630.92s:  so what i'm doing is i'm having it collate all of us so that i can dump it in a google sheet
3637.96s:  and then we will take a look together
3646.36s:  sk public
3648.28s:  And this is the bug seal if we are to insert the bug.
3666.28s:  This is six and we already have eight.
3678.92s:  This will be nine, this and then one more at the.
3693.36s:  And KLA was trash.
3704.36s:  Well, Rwant to be says the firm often takes a short position in the companies at targets,
3708.48s:  which has led to accusations of engaging in short and distort campaigns.
3713.28s:  This involves spreading false, serious leading information to drive down a company stock
3717.36s:  price and profiting from the decline.
3719.24s:  The problem with that perspective in my opinion is that we know they're short.
3724.16s:  So if they weren't disclosing positions, I would agree with you.
3728.16s:  But because they are disclosing their positions, you to me, it's just a company, at least
3735.50s:  from what I'm seeing so far, that is finding stuff that's not looking good, taking a short
3742.36s:  position to trade it to the downside and then subsequently trading it to the downside
3747.68s:  because it doesn't look good, which I mean, I don't think that there's anything inherently
3754.48s:  wrong with that provided they're disclosing their positions.
3757.96s:  But now if they weren't disclosing their positions, then I do think that that's no bono.
3764.68s:  Like that would be lame.
3766.16s:  That would be bad.
3768.20s:  But I don't think that's the case.
3770.72s:  I think we're going to do Italian tonight.
3776.76s:  What do you guys think?
3778.76s:  Roasted salmon?
3779.76s:  That sounds good.
3782.76s:  A little bit of roasted salmon.
3789.76s:  All right.
3793.36s:  So it looks like this should be consolidated by here.
3798.76s:  Yeah, okay.
3800.76s:  So then I'm going to have it create a numbered list of each ticker.
3811.76s:  And then I'm just going to lift and shift the ticker.
3814.76s:  Well, at the date it reported on the stock and the stock price close of the day of the
3842.76s:  year.
3849.76s:  And then we'll grab our workbook.
3856.20s:  And then this will be our focus topic for today since we're already pretty deep into it.
3862.76s:  Exploring.
3864.76s:  And then Berg research.
3870.76s:  Today is two.
3877.76s:  You two.
3882.76s:  All right.
3885.76s:  Let's see how accurate this is.
3888.76s:  It has TIO.
3891.76s:  And it reported on TIO 2023.
3897.76s:  No, we need not that.
3902.76s:  We need like five year daily.
3907.76s:  And now we need to go back.
3919.76s:  This doesn't look right.
3922.76s:  The folks going on here.
3926.76s:  Let me try IEP.
3931.76s:  They reported on two May 23 years 23 years May.
3940.76s:  Here's two May.
3946.76s:  This is the closing prices 50 oh six.
3951.76s:  Okay, so it's not adjusted.
3953.76s:  So we'll have to do the closing prices.
3958.76s:  That's okay.
3959.76s:  There's only 34 tickers.
3961.76s:  So I won't take that long.
3966.76s:  So this is the kind of thing that I normally would just run through Python Xerity.
3970.76s:  I don't know if I have all of these stocks.
3972.76s:  Some of these are.
3976.76s:  So let's go back.
3981.76s:  We'll just do like the adage.
3985.76s:  This would be in and Berg research.
3990.76s:  And then let's dump all these.
3996.76s:  All right.
3999.76s:  This will just be this.
4001.76s:  This will be.
4004.76s:  I actually haven't reformatted reformat as a table.
4014.76s:  Eats.
4017.76s:  All A is the ticker.
4022.76s:  Is company name.
4026.76s:  All C is a reported.
4033.76s:  I don't know where my thing go.
4043.76s:  All right.
4045.76s:  So I was about to reformat all this, but then I realized that.
4050.76s:  We have AI at our disposal.
4052.76s:  I'm literally just going to have AI do it for us.
4055.76s:  So I'm having it reformat.
4059.76s:  The list is a table.
4064.76s:  Reformat the list is a table.
4071.76s:  Okay. So it looks like it's trying to download it.
4077.76s:  I don't want it as a CSV.
4089.76s:  Let's try one more time.
4101.76s:  I'm just trying to get it to populate the list in here.
4106.76s:  So that we can easily pull it over.
4109.76s:  A little faster.
4110.76s:  If it actually does it.
4112.76s:  Be a little faster of it.
4116.76s:  So the entity says the firm has been involved in several SCC fraud charges,
4120.76s:  indicating the investigations have also led to significant regulatory actions.
4124.76s:  Yeah.
4125.76s:  That makes sense.
4132.76s:  This doesn't look like it's formatted.
4140.76s:  As code as a table.
4155.76s:  Jesus.
4158.76s:  I'm going to turn it into the.
4171.76s:  The call.
4172.76s:  Dan says candy technologies and a good example of Hindenburg being wrong.
4175.76s:  Yeah.
4176.76s:  Well, like we were just kind of eyeballing it quickly.
4179.76s:  There were a handful that they clearly got it wrong.
4183.76s:  Just because they get it wrong doesn't really mean anything, right?
4187.76s:  Because everybody's going to have instances that are wrong.
4191.76s:  So what we're doing now is actually going to see how frequently it's wrong.
4198.76s:  So this will be ticker.
4201.76s:  And then this will be date.
4205.76s:  So here.
4210.76s:  We just need what right one, two, before six.
4216.76s:  They're going to be different.
4222.76s:  Faster.
4223.76s:  Three.
4224.76s:  You may.
4226.76s:  Three.
4236.76s:  Please.
4245.76s:  Please.
4254.76s:  Leveling.
4284.76s:  7, 8, 10, 6, 8, 8, 15, 15, 8, this is just a little bit of a little bit of a
4314.20s:  this just says 20, 18, 18, 18,
4322.28s:  now we need and I need a different
4346.28s:  behind you on truck
4350.06s:  and
4352.20s:  Jinan
4353.24s:  and
4355.70s:  of
4361.78s:  the
4365.98s:  private on 5 bucks room before is the tip I was given like a standard
4367.12s:  can
4370.50s:  Give him a little.
4372.50s:  All right.
4377.50s:  And then this will be today.
4381.50s:  Now some of these won't have a price.
4385.50s:  Okay.
4387.50s:  And then ticker.
4389.50s:  We need what left.
4391.50s:  Or are there any five?
4398.50s:  This one will kill.
4401.50s:  Delete.
4405.50s:  The.
4410.50s:  And we want.
4420.50s:  Or.
4432.50s:  And just have a.
4437.50s:  Update the list.
4439.50s:  Be ticker.
4441.50s:  Save.
4443.50s:  And then we can just.
4453.50s:  This is like typically I would just use formulas take.
4456.50s:  Oops.
4457.50s:  I would just use formulas to get rid of the excess stuff.
4461.50s:  But.
4462.50s:  We can just use.
4465.50s:  And then we can just use.
4471.50s:  Something is miss ordered though.
4488.50s:  And then we can just use.
4498.50s:  Oh, I deleted that road.
4502.50s:  All right.
4503.50s:  So now the reason I did that.
4507.50s:  Is now.
4510.50s:  This looks like not a ticker.
4513.50s:  So I'm going to get rid of this one as well.
4517.50s:  And now I can do equals.
4521.50s:  We need to Google.
4527.50s:  Google sheet.
4532.50s:  Not used to Google sheets though.
4535.50s:  All right.
4536.50s:  This equals.
4540.50s:  Equals Google finance.
4543.50s:  And we want it up this ticker.
4546.50s:  And then we can.
4556.50s:  And then for the NAs we'll go through and figure out.
4562.50s:  What happened.
4564.50s:  Well, let's do.
4568.50s:  For price of stock at a specific date.
4572.50s:  Imagine it can do this.
4575.50s:  So let's have this do the formula for us.
4581.50s:  So in F.
4585.50s:  Right a Google sheet formula.
4590.50s:  You.
4591.50s:  For now in D to.
4594.50s:  And D to.
4598.50s:  And D to write a Google sheet formula.
4604.50s:  To obtain the price of the ticker in.
4614.50s:  E to.
4616.50s:  Let's do the closing.
4617.50s:  No, let's do the opening price.
4620.50s:  The opening.
4623.50s:  B to on the date.
4626.50s:  In.
4627.50s:  And we'll have to.
4632.50s:  Figure out.
4635.50s:  What the specific date were, but there's no.
4639.50s:  All right.
4646.50s:  Let's see if any of these work.
4649.50s:  Okay.
4650.50s:  And then we'll do like a variance.
4663.50s:  So then.
4664.50s:  It will be equals.
4668.50s:  The day minus original divided by original.
4673.50s:  And then.
4681.50s:  And then let's add a couple.
4684.50s:  Here.
4691.50s:  And then this is where I like to do.
4695.50s:  Some summary statistic.
4697.50s:  And then we'll do.
4700.50s:  Out of.
4703.50s:  A's return.
4705.50s:  Neg return.
4709.50s:  Average.
4711.50s:  A's return.
4714.50s:  Rich.
4715.50s:  And then let's do.
4717.50s:  Median.
4720.50s:  Median.
4726.50s:  Here.
4730.50s:  Average.
4732.50s:  Median.
4753.50s:  And then.
4763.50s:  All right.
4765.50s:  So now the next step we need to do is to run through and see if we can identify.
4770.50s:  Some of these.
4772.50s:  And a's.
4773.50s:  So is Tio not a thing.
4776.50s:  Let's do.
4786.50s:  This was Tio stock bought out.
4802.50s:  So is D listed.
4807.50s:  Okay.
4808.50s:  So then for that, we would just track the last price that we traded.
4815.50s:  So.
4817.50s:  You.
4818.50s:  You on six June 23.
4820.50s:  One was Tio.
4827.50s:  And then.
4832.50s:  Six June.
4834.50s:  This looks like it.
4837.50s:  So the open.
4840.50s:  So we'll do the close on the day before.
4845.50s:  255.
4850.50s:  And then it was last traded at 69 cents gigat.
4856.50s:  Okay.
4861.50s:  And then I'm actually going to update this formula.
4865.50s:  So that it does.
4868.50s:  One day before.
4873.50s:  So.
4875.50s:  Update this formula.
4878.50s:  So it uses the clothes from one day earlier from the input.
4884.50s:  So.
4891.50s:  So this is just to capture.
4894.50s:  To move from before.
4901.50s:  Okay.
4904.50s:  All right.
4905.50s:  Now we go on to.
4918.50s:  Maybe try trading view.
4921.50s:  Maybe.
4923.50s:  A little bit better.
4930.50s:  Right.
4942.50s:  Okay.
4945.50s:  So.
4947.50s:  Right.
4950.50s:  This.
4953.50s:  12 March.
4956.50s:  Of 21.
4965.50s:  March.
4968.50s:  I said 12 March.
4972.50s:  I said 12 March.
4975.50s:  I said 12 March.
4978.50s:  Wait.
4979.50s:  Why is it given to me as.
4982.50s:  Weekly.
4983.50s:  I don't want weekly.
4986.50s:  Wait.
4987.50s:  What the fuck is happening right now.
4991.50s:  I'm so confused.
4996.50s:  Only.
4998.50s:  I'm going to exclude this one.
5002.50s:  The reason why I'm filtering these is I don't want to get rid of them from the data set.
5007.50s:  But.
5008.50s:  Like some of them are just weird.
5011.50s:  So.
5012.50s:  I also don't want it to create a problem from the data set.
5017.50s:  So this let's get rid of ride.
5025.50s:  And then I'm also going to sort these alphabetically.
5028.50s:  It'll easier.
5030.50s:  ALDS.
5041.50s:  Okay.
5043.50s:  So ALDS was done in 2018.
5048.50s:  I would have to guess here.
5051.50s:  Yeah.
5052.50s:  This is set up.
5054.50s:  To do like weekly or something.
5062.50s:  Let's just use the clothes from here.
5068.50s:  Which was two pennies.
5074.50s:  And then the last price we see.
5079.50s:  Was 1.23.
5086.50s:  Okay.
5087.50s:  Next we have.
5093.50s:  And that was 2019.
5095.50s:  We'll probably be able to see why it came.
5098.50s:  Here.
5099.50s:  The clothes.
5101.50s:  1368.
5105.50s:  And then the last price traded.
5108.50s:  889.
5111.50s:  Okay.
5113.50s:  Next.
5114.50s:  Rose.
5118.50s:  That was 5 June 19.
5128.50s:  This looks like.
5134.50s:  This would be the last clothes before.
5143.50s:  8094.
5146.50s:  2.61.
5149.50s:  8094.
5152.50s:  And then the last price we see is 13.713.
5158.50s:  13.713.
5160.50s:  19.1.
5163.50s:  10.913.
5166.50s:  15.
5170.50s:  15.20.
5178.50s:  If.
5181.50s:  What have been a close here.
5184.50s:  3.615.
5186.50s:  19.
5189.50s:  615.
5192.50s:  And then the last.
5194.50s:  Created.
5197.50s:  Here.
5199.50s:  Close.
5202.50s:  31.769.
5205.50s:  31.
5208.50s:  34.
5218.50s:  Next.

5630.50s:  the close on the 12th 3628 3628 6 last to WTRH nothing for that and then why are
5651.78s:  the WTRH from our sample and then why I or V was from 60s
5671.14s:  close was 1179
5681.54s:  they actually go fully bankrupt
5686.98s:  yep they did and gone okay but now we have some data look at and now we'll do average
5700.50s:  this as it goes the negative numbers
5709.46s:  right maybe I need to get rid of let's clear these out
5728.66s:  so I think it is still picking up the
5748.66s:  game
5758.66s:  let's do
5766.58s:  if I think I'm just going to do count it
5776.66s:  let's have judges so we'll do
5780.02s:  L3
5784.34s: камиu 2. a side of the first
5789.06s:  let's start
5789.54s:  okay
5794.02s:  3D
5803.70s:  But I got a question that's one of
5821.68s:  other please
5829.82s:  No.
5836.82s:  Each number of I, I, I, 30, and so, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, if,
5849.82s:  You, 30, and so, if, if, oh, that's super easy.
5879.82s:  There are extra prints.
5889.82s:  Ah.
5891.82s:  Yo, what the f is difficult?
5909.82s:  I'm gonna see the way that Google would or chat you be to you and do it but it just made it so much more difficult.
5939.82s:  I mean they have a really good hit rate, 75% for this.
5959.82s:  This I don't care about.
5980.82s:  So we want to average this if it is greater than zero.
5996.82s:  And then we need to do median f.
6010.82s:  There's no median f.
6024.82s:  This was told to be nine.
6030.82s:  The median of I.
6036.82s:  30 if the number are greater than zero.
6052.82s:  That's definitely not.
6058.82s:  So then the other thing I need to do is duration equals.
6066.82s:  Let's do today minus this.
6086.82s:  And this one will just do one June or so.
6096.82s:  And this will do the same thing like one June.
6106.82s:  I'm just picking like a default.
6110.82s:  Most of these are pretty long term.
6117.82s:  So the average duration for these.
6122.82s:  1644.
6125.82s:  So really long time.
6133.82s:  About six trading years, six and a half.
6137.82s:  So what do we know?
6141.82s:  After running through all of that, we now know that Hindenburg is pretty damn accurate.
6149.82s:  We know that of the observable tickers that we could find data for pretty easily.
6157.82s:  That 22 of the time they have a negative return and 22 count and seven count had a positive return.
6167.82s:  So it's 75% hit rate over a longer term duration.
6172.82s:  So we also have a pretty high like if we were to do a distribution of negative moves compared to positive moves as a count.
6182.82s:  It would really lean heavily to the negative moves, meaning the severity, which is really interesting.
6188.82s:  So stock can only lose up to 100%. So we'd have to normalize it.
6192.82s:  So very, very interesting.
6194.82s:  Now back to where we are today with Carvana and this clearly looks like Carvana is in fucking trouble.
6204.82s:  That's what this looks like to me.
6206.82s:  So then let's sort by near term to longer term and let's just see how accurate they've been.
6212.82s:  Let's do it since like 21.
6216.82s:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5 cracked, 2 and cracked.
6222.82s:  Crazy.
6224.82s:  Rantidi says they caused the moves market manipulation, shortened distorting, seller boxing.
6228.82s:  I don't agree with you.
6230.82s:  The reason why I don't agree with you is because if it was just them reporting bad information, the market wouldn't go along with it because I as a trader stand literally to my heart.
6245.82s:  Literally to make more money by squeezing Hindenburg research if they are wrong.
6253.82s:  So the market is literally incentivized to buck what they're putting out if it's not accurate.
6264.82s:  So I think from a market consensus standpoint, if Hindenburg put research out that I thought was superficial didn't really mean anything, nothing behind it.
6278.82s:  And they're just trying to force the price down and that and I know that to be their M.O. I would buy because then I know as more buyer step in, it will literally squeeze them.
6292.82s:  And that would be in and of itself enough to make some money.
6298.82s:  I would retort that it looks like they do a good job of identifying companies that are failing that are not doing well.
6309.82s:  And I mean that that's what this would lead me to believe.
6316.82s:  But as we know, there definitely are bad actors in the market, but it's just that the market would be incentivized to run the other way if they were running that way.
6330.82s:  Lawrence says it seems like manipulation to an extent many people will play just to make money. It's the name of the game.
6338.82s:  Again, I think the problem I have with it is like the size of the moves. If there was a lot of this here, where we're seeing a company down 5% 3% 2%, I would agree with you.
6351.82s:  But the fact that the majority of these companies, as I can see that when they are negative, they're down over 50%.
6360.82s:  And like that shows a company that's not doing well. That's just what that is.
6366.82s:  It's very difficult for a company to especially to be pushed down into bankruptcy or down greater than 50% without without fundamental underlying issues present.
6381.82s:  Because again, that's the cool part about markets being consensus driven. If people thought Hindenburg was just coming out with superficial hit pieces that they would, you know,
6397.82s:  fade a company to try to put out this news piece to then play on the down tick, whatever, how big the down tick is, why would anybody else participate?
6405.82s:  You're literally disincentivized from doing so. So Lauren saying the company isn't doing well and they push them off the cliff. I fully agree with that. I completely agree with that.
6417.82s:  And I don't I genuinely don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think it's okay. Again, as long as they're disclosing their positions because again, here's the deal.
6425.82s:  If Hindenburg is known to have a short position on the tickers that they're putting out research, then one, they're putting their money where their mouth is to we understand they're baked in incentive already.
6442.82s:  So if the market doesn't agree with their perspective, which clearly it doesn't always agree with their perspective.
6449.82s:  Genus is one of them that sticks out to me. Be is another one sticks out to me. TGLS is another one sticks out to me.
6457.82s:  So we can like the market doesn't perpetually agree with them.
6461.82s:  But it does look like they're pretty good at identifying failing companies and shorting them and also putting out research that absolutely does help their cause if it's accurate.
6473.82s:  And if people think the research is good, if the people if people don't think the research is good, then there's no reason to pile on because we don't agree with the research of the conclusion.
6486.82s:  But that's not what it looks like here.
6489.82s:  Super interesting.
6492.82s:  All right, gang, time for me to sign off. I'm about to make a video about the game stop covered strangle.
6499.82s:  So we will take a look at how we're setting that up.
6504.82s:  Tomorrow's live stream will still do the options trading basics.
6509.82s:  I just don't know what time just yet because we might be going out either up to the mountains or to the desert for a day just to go hang out.
6516.82s:  So TBD on when but there will be something.
6519.82s:  As always, if you guys need anything, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
