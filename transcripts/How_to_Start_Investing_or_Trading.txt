0.80s: what's up everybody eric here welcome
2.56s: back to all the outliers it is back to
4.80s: the basics today i want to run through
7.36s: how i would start trading if i were to
9.60s: start all over again and really i built
12.24s: this to have a conversation with a
14.08s: family member so this is kind of the no
16.64s: frills no bs no fluff
19.12s: breakdown on what i think is truly
21.76s: important to get started early and then
24.24s: obviously there is just a tremendous
26.48s: amount of information that we accumulate
28.88s: over time so this is kind of the minimal
31.04s: viable product in my opinion to get
33.68s: started successfully specifically as it
35.52s: pertains to the markets in general
37.76s: analysis and then also some option
40.24s: strategies
41.52s: the other thing i want to know is at the
43.28s: end of the video i'm going to go through
45.28s: four steps so i'm going to break down
47.28s: everything we go over in the first part
48.72s: of the video into four actionable steps
51.52s: on what i would be looking to do and how
53.76s: i want to do it so let's jump over and
56.64s: get right to it the very first thing is
58.56s: i'm going to be linking to a bunch of
60.80s: supporting videos because we're not
62.40s: going to go super far into detail on all
64.56s: the concepts i bring up because the
66.40s: video would never end so with that
69.04s: i'm not going to link them via cards
71.04s: just because there's going to be too
72.00s: many of them they're going to be in the
72.96s: video description below so that's where
74.48s: you can find them as i mentioned them
77.04s: so let's start with kind of this general
78.72s: orientation section the very first thing
81.12s: that i think anybody especially again my
83.92s: family member that's looking to start
85.92s: trading needs to sort out is this they
89.04s: need to define their goals why are they
91.20s: trying to do this and then get their
93.76s: savings in order this is
96.56s: finance basic financial management 101
99.60s: but you do not want to start investing
101.68s: or even more so trading
103.92s: money that you need in the next three to
106.72s: five years and it's because there's a
108.56s: lot of volatility and i mean let's be
110.64s: honest so you might suck at it and you
112.80s: might lose it so we have to accept that
115.76s: risk but it's easier to accept that risk
118.56s: and operate with that healthily
121.36s: if we know that we're not depending on
124.72s: that money for something that's really
126.48s: important to us
128.48s: so
129.20s: a favorite saving saying of mine is from
131.76s: stephen covey's um seven successful
135.04s: habit or seven habits of highly
136.48s: successful peoples begin with the end in
138.96s: mind and that really ties to both of
140.96s: these the reason why i think it's so
142.40s: important is because if you want to
143.76s: start trading you can get pulled in
146.96s: countless different directions there's
148.88s: going to be tons of information that's
150.24s: thrown at you all different points in
151.84s: time but some of it might be useful some
154.24s: of it might not you might be interested
156.48s: in it and want to learn about it later
158.00s: but if you begin with the end in mind
160.16s: you know what you're working towards you
162.24s: can always pull yourself back onto the
165.20s: right path so you're not going down this
167.52s: random rabbit hole about implied
170.48s: volatility surface calculations if you
173.20s: don't even need to trade options or if
174.96s: it's not something you're interested in
176.64s: not saying that i think it's fascinating
178.48s: i think it's cool for most people to
179.84s: check out but to make sure that we're
182.08s: not getting inundated and overwhelmed
184.32s: and essentially paralyzed by the amount
186.88s: of information i think this is extremely
188.88s: important and it's also going to help
191.04s: you feed what your risk approach is
194.32s: going to be
195.52s: if your end in mind like was for me when
198.40s: i first started in high school which was
199.92s: to rapidly grow my account that meant i
203.68s: needed to accept heightened risk
207.20s: if i truly couldn't accept heightened
209.20s: risk i would have made innumerable
211.92s: mistakes that probably would have zeroed
213.68s: the account out
214.96s: so begin with the end of mine i think is
216.88s: a great first step here i would clearly
219.04s: define what you're trying to achieve you
221.12s: might not know the right route to get
222.64s: there but define it
224.88s: the next thing is very early on start a
227.68s: trading plan this will mean nothing to
230.00s: most people especially again the family
232.64s: member i'm going to share this video
234.08s: with this will be nothing to you but
236.40s: what i want you to do is literally just
238.80s: open up a word doc
240.40s: and start with your goals your savings
243.60s: plan to make sure that your savings are
245.12s: healthy that you have what you need for
247.12s: six months of expenses is a is a typical
249.52s: approach if you have a good secure job
252.56s: and start there what this trading plan
255.36s: will turn into is a comprehensive wealth
258.48s: management document that applies not
260.88s: only to investing not only to trading
262.96s: but also hopefully when you get into
264.96s: real estate when you get into angel
266.80s: investing when you get into franchises
269.20s: when you get into all different ways of
271.20s: making money this helps us flush out our
275.20s: thoughts so the very first video i'm
277.68s: going to link to is this right here and
279.68s: that is in the video description below
281.76s: the next one some general resources
283.68s: obviously youtube is one of them that's
285.28s: where this video is going to be
286.32s: available to you but then also i have
288.96s: the discord that i run it's completely
290.56s: free it's
291.52s: the outlier trading dojo and it's just
294.64s: like-minded people who want to become an
296.80s: outlier who want to become financially
299.04s: successful and we know in order to do
301.76s: that statistically speaking you have to
303.20s: be an outlier so we're working towards
305.12s: that or working to maintain that
308.24s: i also host live sessions and again
310.72s: that's available to you and everybody
312.08s: else who's interested so the live
314.16s: sessions right now they're mondays but
316.24s: then i also do uh trading workshop once
319.20s: a month with the outlier community i do
321.76s: one-on-one giveaways on twitter the
323.44s: first of the month for a 45-minute
325.04s: conversation obviously you just hit me
326.48s: up whatever i'll talk to you but for
328.08s: anybody else listening this would be
329.68s: useful
330.72s: then a couple other important tools
333.68s: investopedia is great and options as a
336.08s: strategic investment is also great
338.72s: again there is probably an infinite
341.44s: number of resources out there for
343.04s: learning i think these two are probably
346.24s: two of the greatest starting points
348.96s: because you can get what you need and
351.36s: then kind of distill through that
353.68s: information again don't get stuck in
356.72s: analysis paralysis because there's 96
359.68s: websites you bookmarked that all look
361.76s: interesting to you but you can't make
363.52s: any progress because you're overwhelmed
365.12s: because there's too many start with
366.40s: those two
367.52s: now the last thing is i do think
370.40s: leveraging the community is super
372.72s: important but i think this has served me
375.68s: very well especially with the trading
377.92s: mentor i've told you all about
379.76s: but the only reason why i was able to
381.92s: maintain a relationship with him is
383.28s: because i wasn't ever asking for a pure
386.24s: handout i didn't want the answer handed
388.32s: to me i wanted direction so that i could
390.64s: figure it out myself and what that did
392.88s: was show a certain level of investment
395.04s: that i was giving this experience so
397.60s: that it didn't feel like to him i was
400.08s: just taking advantage of literally 40
402.72s: well now 60 plus years of trading
405.60s: experience
406.96s: so look for direction look for help but
410.08s: understand that
412.24s: you're going to come across people who
414.32s: aren't going to want to help you now
416.00s: when i think about communities that are
418.64s: helpful
419.60s: i think about places where anonymity is
422.56s: limited so places like twitter can be
424.80s: useful if it's a named account
427.12s: i i'm relatively new on there and i
429.04s: enjoy it i also think places like the
431.92s: youtube comments is another decent place
434.88s: reddit is a good place but you have to
436.48s: understand reddit is brutal
438.96s: people are completely anonymous on there
441.60s: and you will find the worst versions of
444.48s: human beings in those settings
446.48s: especially in the trading community
448.00s: especially in the finance community
449.44s: people typically aren't nice so you're
451.44s: gonna have to grow from thick skin which
453.44s: is a good life skill anyways
455.36s: all right so let's move on now down to
457.52s: some conversations about the markets
458.88s: quickly
459.92s: what are the markets in short the
462.32s: markets are built of exchanges things
465.44s: like the nicey the new york stock
467.52s: exchange which you likely have heard
469.36s: before places like that
471.12s: and they provide access to securities
473.68s: there are different kinds of securities
476.40s: there's a couple major buckets we have
479.28s: equities debt derivatives technically
482.40s: there's another one over here called
483.68s: hybrids which we're not going to get
484.80s: into because it doesn't matter for the
486.00s: conversation right now
487.68s: but for equities think stocks individual
490.96s: stocks and companies you've heard that
492.56s: before that is what equities are there's
495.92s: also etfs that can be considered in
498.16s: there things like that
499.92s: debt is bonds cds things of that nature
504.16s: it's essentially something where money
506.00s: was loaned and it's going to get paid
507.84s: back with interest and then derivatives
510.00s: this is what i do i've talked to you
511.44s: about this before which is derivatives
513.76s: being options and futures so these are
516.56s: contracts
517.92s: that their value is derived from
520.56s: something else
522.24s: so
523.28s: we'll get into a little bit more about
525.28s: some general market concepts down here
527.76s: but it's really important to note that
530.08s: the markets are large there are a ton of
532.96s: players in it and we make up retail
535.12s: traders make up a small part of that
537.36s: okay we need a brokerage account
539.12s: essentially this is the middleman you
540.56s: need them as you know tim or john or
543.68s: eric i directly cannot access individual
547.44s: stocks on the stock market so i need a
550.40s: broker the brokerage service does that
552.88s: for you they provide you access in
554.80s: exchange for commissions so a lot of
557.36s: brokerage they will advertise free
560.40s: commissions on stocks which is typically
562.96s:  because it's going to be
564.48s: captured in order routing anyways which
566.80s: we'll get into via another video
569.04s: but more importantly
570.80s: don't skimp out on your brokerage
573.20s: places like robinhood have just so many
576.72s: people who thought it was the greatest
578.56s: thing because it was attractive and
580.16s: gamified investing and trading but then
583.04s: when you really need market support when
585.04s: things are volatile things aren't going
587.04s: well
588.24s: bid-ask spreads liquidities going out
590.24s: the door places like robin hood become
592.16s: crippled whereas larger established
594.48s: brokerage firms don't have quite that
596.72s: same level of impact so again
600.88s: giving
601.92s: general feedback would be shop around
603.92s: and i have a video in the in the
605.36s: description below that you can see how
607.44s: we can shop around some things to look
609.04s: for but the main message here is don't
611.44s: skimp i use td ameritrade i'm not
614.32s: sponsored by them or anything i
615.84s: literally randomly picked them when i
617.44s: was starting in high school and i just
618.88s: have liked them they have good platform
620.32s: good trading platform so i stuck with
622.40s: them but don't skimp out here
625.28s: next thing portfolio risk management so
627.52s: i have a couple videos again in the
629.20s: description below that talks about both
630.80s: of these when we think about portfolio
633.44s: management your very first job is you
635.28s: are a risk manager most people start
637.68s: trading thinking that they're going to
638.80s: be there to make money make fat stacks
641.68s: make a pool full of gold coins like
644.16s: scrooge mcduck that you can jump in and
646.16s: dive and swim through all your money but
648.96s: the problem is you're not going to get
650.48s: there if you don't have an account
651.52s: because you blew it up so the very first
653.76s: thing is learning risk management and
656.24s: what goes into that understanding the
658.84s: relationship between risk and reward
661.76s: here's the punch line you've heard this
663.52s: before if something seems too good to be
666.40s: true it probably is sometimes in the
669.60s: markets there will be
671.92s: something that's mispriced or there
673.60s: truly will be a gift in the markets but
676.40s: it is so rare so in general applying
679.60s: that skeptical mindset is super
681.84s: important if you ever look at something
683.44s: especially early on in your trading
685.60s: career and you're like wow this seems so
687.60s: great there's like no risk here but
689.60s: great reward you're probably not looking
691.92s: at it right risk and reward are
694.24s: intimately tied to one another when we
696.48s: want to accept or pursue
699.04s: greater reward we are going to
701.44s: inevitably accept higher risk so you got
704.32s: to find the balance that works for you
708.24s: speaking of finding that balance
710.24s: let's talk about how we should first get
712.40s: started
713.92s: in my opinion what i would do if i was
716.08s: starting all over again is i would
717.84s: establish a buy and hold portfolio to be
720.88s: working in the background while i was
723.60s: paper trading to learn
725.92s: so i have a video in the description
728.40s: below on the best buy and hold portfolio
731.84s: i think exists
733.28s: you literally can set it up in less than
734.96s: seven minutes and it no outperforms
737.28s: the market so it's a no-brainer to me
739.60s: it's something that i would do in the
740.96s: background because unless you are
743.36s: looking to trade for income
745.60s: if you can't beat your buy and hold
747.60s: portfolio via trading you're not gonna
750.24s: make money faster you're gonna make
751.68s: money slower so
754.24s: i think it's prudent to have that
756.40s: working in the background while you
758.24s: learn the skill set make all the stupid
760.80s: mistakes we all make make it via paper
763.36s: trading make your trade plan built out
766.00s: so that you have an idea where you're
767.52s: starting so that you're not pissing away
769.92s: money unnecessarily while you're
771.60s: learning
772.48s: if you hear people say oh paper trading
774.88s: stupid it's not real money all that kind
776.88s: of stuff they're right it's not real
779.12s: money but if you can't take paper
781.76s: trading seriously you've already
783.36s: identified a much larger problem that is
786.80s: going to plague you through your entire
788.80s: trading career which is a discipline
791.12s: issue
792.00s: if you do not have discipline you will
794.64s: not be successful trading and that is
797.28s: just how it's going to play out because
798.88s: there's going to be plenty of times
800.40s: where you need to control
802.56s: your emotions your own thought process
805.20s: and even though you want to go left you
807.28s: got to go right and you got to make
808.96s: yourself go right so
811.12s: i think paper trading is good for a lot
812.64s: of those reasons all right let's move on
814.88s: to some market concepts and analysis
817.76s: like i said before retail we're the
819.36s: small fish we make a very small amount
821.68s: of order size and at the end of the day
824.00s: we are small fish swimming with big fish
826.72s: that are known as institutions so
829.20s: institutions are things like banks hedge
832.24s: funds pensions
834.08s: they are very large groups of money
837.60s: and there are plenty of other market
839.44s: players out there that classifies
841.36s: institutions high frequency trading
844.00s: firms market makers all those kinds of
846.32s: things again to not get too
849.36s: sucked down a rabbit hole it's just
851.44s: important to note that we are
853.84s: essentially the small fish we get
856.24s: information as retail traders the very
858.88s: last
859.92s: but
860.72s: overall there's still enough
862.88s: space in the market for us to make money
865.44s: as well
867.04s: now when we talk about market efficiency
869.04s: there's all different kinds of
870.00s: hypothesis out there and one of the
871.84s: first pieces of homework would be good
873.60s: for you to do is go over here to
875.52s: investopedia and look up the efficient
877.44s: market hypothesis it's a really useful
880.32s: concept to understand but essentially
882.40s: there's different forms that data and
884.56s: information permeates throughout the
887.28s: markets according to the efficient
889.28s: market hypothesis
890.80s: again the punch line here is the markets
893.28s: in my opinion are not purely efficient
895.68s: we find instances where there are
897.60s: inefficiencies which leaves us room to
899.84s: develop edge to make money edge is super
903.68s: important to our ability to make money
905.68s: long term there's lots of different ways
907.68s: you can find or create edge but it's
911.28s: important to note that edge doesn't
913.36s: necessarily remain consistent it changes
916.56s: over time the market changes so we are
918.88s: continually looking for different styles
922.40s: that meet our objectives that can find
924.64s: and develop edge in the marketplace
927.12s: now down to analysis
929.36s: technical analysis is essentially when
931.04s: we're looking at charts and we're trying
932.88s: to use the information we see on charts
935.20s: to develop ideas on where things are
937.36s: going to go
938.56s: fundamental analysis is when we're
940.00s: looking at the qualitative and
941.36s: quantitative aspects of a company we're
943.04s: looking at earnings statements we're
944.32s: looking at products we're looking at
945.76s: leadership we're looking at analyst
948.48s: recommendations analyst revisions all of
950.88s: those sorts of things
952.56s: so for some really important deeper
956.00s: information on market concepts technical
958.40s: analysis and fundamental analysis i have
960.96s: videos
962.16s: in the description i share my top five
965.12s: technical analysis tools and my top five
968.08s: fundamental analysis tools that if i was
970.88s: starting over again i would focus on
973.28s: those first
975.44s: now the last thing don't get sucked into
978.16s: this stupid-ass argument of is technical
981.20s: analysis better than fundamental
982.72s: analysis or vice versa it's as
985.60s: a retail trader we're at the very end of
987.44s: the information spectrum you should use
989.76s: everything at your disposal to make the
991.60s: best possible decisions you will start
993.92s: to understand what makes the most sense
995.76s: for your trading style for me
998.24s: i weight technical and fundamental
1000.48s: analysis differently based on what i'm
1002.56s: doing so you'll start to understand a
1004.80s: little bit more about that as you
1006.32s: practice different strategies
1009.12s: perfect segue
1010.48s: into strategies
1012.80s: in my opinion anybody who's interested
1015.12s: in actively trading should absolutely
1017.68s: take a look at options i have an entire
1020.48s: playlist on options it's a little dated
1022.48s: so i apologize for that but i'll link to
1024.72s: that in the video description anyways
1026.16s: because i think there's still some good
1027.52s: information in there plus you'll get to
1029.36s: see me in my early youtube days which is
1031.52s: kind of hilarious
1033.20s: more importantly i want to give again
1035.76s: specific direction on where i would
1037.60s: start the very first thing is the
1039.44s: coverage strangle the second thing is
1041.52s: diagonals the third thing is the naked
1044.08s: short put i do think naked short calls
1046.88s: should be added shortly thereafter but
1048.56s: not early on again just my general
1050.84s: opinion so as you probably would expect
1054.08s: i have
1055.12s: videos in the description for all three
1057.84s: of these providing you an overview of
1060.24s: what they are how i use them
1062.16s: specifically what to look for how to
1064.24s: scan for them everything
1066.40s: so
1067.28s: when we think about getting started
1069.92s: trading the right way these are the i
1072.56s: lied to you all i guess there's five
1074.08s: steps
1075.20s: on how i would get started
1077.52s: we need to save money so that we have
1079.76s: something to start with define our
1081.28s: objectives and begin our research using
1083.12s: those resources i shared then we need to
1085.60s: find a brokerage account open up the
1087.60s: account open up a margin account ideally
1090.80s: don't forget you can do this for your
1092.24s: iras that's what i do but you got to get
1095.12s: something opened up in order to get
1096.72s: access to the markets then we need to
1098.56s: put some money in there and set up that
1100.24s: buy and hold portfolio
1102.32s: step four is begin paper trading some of
1105.04s: those options strategies that i shared
1107.44s: while you're building out your trading
1109.20s: plan in your trade logs which again i
1111.92s: have links in the video description
1113.20s: below for you to check those out and
1115.04s: then before you choose to go live with
1118.48s: whatever you're practicing paper trading
1121.68s: validate those results
1124.24s: do they make sense meaning are you
1128.08s: beating are you able to beat your buy
1131.04s: and hold portfolio if the answer to that
1133.84s: is no then you either need to keep paper
1136.88s: trading to develop your skill set so
1139.12s: that that is the case or
1141.76s: you should be paper trading something
1143.44s: that's designed more for income
1146.32s: because that's the only other reason
1148.48s: if you're trying to trade but you can't
1150.96s: outperform the market would be for
1152.72s: income or to reduce risk but that all
1155.44s: comes with defining your objectives
1157.60s: early on so that's exactly what i would
1159.84s: do like i said i got a bunch of videos
1161.68s: in the description for you to check out
1163.52s: if you found this helpful subscribe to
1165.36s: the channel like share with some friends
1167.36s: that might benefit from it especially
1168.88s: those people that have been on the fence
1170.72s: about trading it has literally changed
1173.20s: my life in a very meaningful way that's
1175.92s: why i started this to try and share some
1177.68s: of that experience with everybody
1178.88s: without all the so hope it was
1180.96s: helpful and if you have any questions or
1182.88s: anything that you want to see me go over
