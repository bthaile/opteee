0.00s: You know, it's so funny that you're asking that question because honestly, this has been
9.92s: top of mind for me for the last decade.
13.44s: Like I don't really talk about this at all because I don't want to talk about this particular
22.08s: question because I don't want to get off track most of the time.
27.20s: This is different.
28.20s: It's podcast.
29.20s: I don't talk about this the network, but this is a question that I've been battling
35.76s: in turn myself and trying to try and decide how to address it for a long time.
44.52s: What's up everyone.
45.52s: Welcome back to the outlier podcast.
47.12s: We have a familiar face.
48.52s: I mean, a familiar face from a bunch of places at this point.
51.00s: People see you every single day, but we have a Tom back.
53.92s: Great to see you again.
55.40s: Thanks.
56.40s: Thanks for having me.
57.40s: So last time we spoke, I was a few months ago, I tried to catch up with you like every
62.04s: few months just to see how things are going and what's materializing.
65.16s: And we were obviously talking about the new, just dynamic of markets economy, that kind
71.88s: of stuff.
72.88s: And I know you're not like that into the economy, like a data perspective in terms of how
77.08s: it informs your trading, but I still find this stuff fascinating.
80.88s: So I'm going to drag you through it for a few moments anyways at a high level, 2025.
86.64s: How is it playing out in your general world view and the economy might the way I look
92.72s: at it is they're intertwined.
94.24s: They're different, but they're still intertwined and they reflect one another in different
97.24s: ways.
98.24s: The stock market is playing out surprisingly a lot like I thought it would.
103.36s: I thought it'd be the first half of this year.
106.24s: And I didn't think we were going much of anywhere this year.
109.20s: So I think that the lows surprised me, the lows surprised me, but being down on the
116.20s: year.
117.20s: And I thought we'd kind of, you know, between 5,500 and 57, 50, I thought that's kind of
124.80s: where we're going to spend most of the year.
126.04s: So that part of it doesn't really surprise me.
129.84s: So stock market wise, I think I'm in line.
132.56s: I think that's pretty wise.
137.96s: I guess I'm not sure that that I mean, thinking about the economy just as from just a very
149.84s: like the 500 foot view, I'm surprised how well we have settled for the insanity of this
160.48s: administration.
162.08s: Like I'm surprised for how accepting we've been of a self-inflicted trade war and the
170.36s: pure, you know, just the incredibly high level of stupidity coming out of Washington.
176.88s: It's bothersome that we have accepted it the way we have.
181.28s: So for me, that's the biggest surprise.
183.36s: I don't think, I don't, I wouldn't say it's like an economic surprise.
188.20s: If I had to pick one part of the markets that probably is a surprise, maybe it's maybe
193.16s: it's where the bond market is, maybe it's interest rates right now more than it stocks
196.32s: or anything else.
197.48s: But I think in general, it's that the markets held up reasonably well given the amount
204.20s: of I think self-inflicted concerns and conflicts that I have about, you know, what's happening
213.44s: in what's happening in politics.
215.92s: Got it.
216.92s: Now talk to me about the initial drop, the way that that played out because I, the news
226.12s: component to its interesting, you're talking about some of the polls, you know, elements
230.16s: who, which is interesting.
231.24s: So did anything stand out about that drop, velocity, duration, recovery, anything like
236.04s: that?
237.04s: Well, of course, I mean, anytime you get a move of that, I mean, that was basically a crash.
241.52s: You know, we're talking about late March to early to mid April was essentially a crash.
246.60s: And anytime you get, you know, a once in every seven years, you know, volatility expansion,
252.28s: once you get a drop of, you know, a thousand points in the S&Ps, you know, you're talking,
257.76s: you know, this is major stuff.
261.00s: There was, there was a lot of money lost.
265.24s: There was, you know, there was a lot of damage.
269.44s: And so anytime you get that kind of a market move for whatever the reason is, I think it's
275.00s: really bad.
276.16s: And you get that kind of a market move and you feel like it's more self-inflicted.
281.44s: It's even more troublesome or bothersome.
284.92s: Straighting, yeah.
285.92s: Yeah.
286.92s: And frustrating, yeah.
287.92s: Because you kind of think this could have been avoided.
290.72s: And so I think that, you know, I don't like when people mess with the integrity of free
296.80s: markets that bothers me.
299.08s: And so, you know, that's my biggest issue.
301.12s: I don't like people messing with mother nature.
303.64s: Right.
304.80s: Now, one of the things I found interesting is like a couple of the recent drops that
309.20s: we've had in like the last five years or so have seen to follow not the same script,
314.24s: but a similar script just in terms of the qualities of the down move.
319.40s: We're not seeing like the same compression of like a standard bear market.
324.44s: Maybe that we saw in 22.
326.48s: That was a little more normal.
328.88s: I would say.
329.88s: I think 22 was a more traditional bear market.
334.20s: You know, I mean, the pandemic, I think you can look at that as, you know, that was another
340.24s: kind of an outlier.
341.56s: I wouldn't say it's self-inflicted, but I would say that it was just, it was something
346.16s: new and something very strange.
347.84s: And I think that that was, you know, I mean, it was short lived as well.
352.96s: This opens up another question.
355.52s: Markets typically trying to discount into the future.
359.16s: And I'm curious from your background in like actual markets being in the pit and whatnot.
366.80s: With the kind of news driven cycle that we're in right now, what like what kind of impact
371.24s: does that have in the pit style environment?
374.92s: I know again, things have changed a lot, but I'm just curious from an information digestion
378.60s: positioning perspective because you could see it on the day to day, right?
382.76s: Teriffs around market crashes, tariffs are off, market go.
385.60s: It's like that seems so difficult to try to position.
389.40s: So I'm wondering from your background, how these kinds of environments play out in that
394.56s: world?
395.56s: Well, you can't position for, you know, there's no such thing as positioning for a tweet.
401.00s: You know, but we've only had, you know, essentially one president in history of this country
407.76s: that that you've had to position for that.
409.56s: So, you know, I mean, that's where we are.
412.88s: I don't think as a pit trader or as an active trader that you do position for any of that
418.88s: stuff.
419.88s: I don't think that that's part of what's in your, you know, I don't think you try to prepare
426.76s: for, for something that's not quantifiable.
431.68s: I think that you have to prepare the way we look at the way we look at the world, or
436.60s: I shouldn't say we, the way I look at the world is I am prepared for anything within
442.72s: two standard deviations.
445.12s: And when you get into three standard deviations, I'm not prepared.
449.56s: So I live in a world of two standard deviations or less, which is essentially the world that,
457.12s: you know, you're protected by randomness, not fooled by randomness.
463.08s: And that is essentially, you know, where I live and where I thrive in.
467.80s: So inside of two standard deviations, I like that outside of two standard deviations,
472.44s: where it gets into three and four standard deviations, five standard deviations, where
476.00s: you can't quantify it.
477.32s: I don't do well there.
480.84s: And again, that's a matter of preference.
485.80s: And I think when people start to understand that, I think that that's, you know, I think
492.40s: that's, I think that's an interesting, that's an interesting discussion to have.
496.24s: Because I think there are certain people that, like, you know, that, that, that live their
501.92s: whole life playing for an outlier move.
505.32s: And it's a, it's a very lonely place.
508.92s: Do you, do you play crafts?
510.76s: I do.
511.76s: That's actually funny.
512.76s: It's like, okay.
513.76s: Yeah.
514.76s: Well, if you play crafts, it's like, it's like, you're the only person at table betting
517.08s: that don't.
518.08s: You know, and that's, that's, that's essentially, like, I'm not going to say that,
522.28s: like, I don't like people that bet that don't.
524.76s: Not, is it anything wrong with it?
526.08s: It's just like, you know, what, we're there to have fun.
528.40s: Nobody wants to bet that don't bet against everybody.
530.80s: I, I, I don't like playing for outlier moves.
535.92s: The same way I don't like betting that don't.
537.48s: I think that, you know, up to two standard deviations is a very reasonable expectation.
544.72s: One standard deviation has a high probability of a touch.
546.92s: Two standard deviations has a much lower chance, but that's where the whole financial
552.00s: industry lives.
553.00s: And I think that that's a reasonable place to set expectations inside of.
558.28s: When we get outside of that, it gets confusing.
561.04s: And that's, I think, you know, anytime, like what recently happened in April, we got
564.68s: outside of two standard deviations, that's confusing.
568.08s: Now talks to me about the confusion, though, because we know, we know it's going to be
572.84s: confusing.
573.84s: And I imagine that there's got to be some sort of approach that you would take to at
577.92s: least moderately adapt, given the circumstance.
581.68s: So you certainly, you certainly can try, but you have to give it a fair analogy.
586.32s: Anytime you're in a kind of like a crash, you know, just think of yourself in a, in a
590.92s: bad, in a bad situation, you're driving down the road and there's a patch of ice, you
596.36s: know, it's black ice.
597.36s: You can't see it.
598.64s: So your car spins.
599.96s: There, there's not a lot you can do.
602.20s: That's a, that's a three or four standard deviation event.
606.00s: And when something's outside of your control, you spin on black ice, a tire blows up,
610.92s: you know, you know, something happens on the road that you couldn't see.
615.84s: You know, there, there's all these different things that, that it's very hard to control,
620.68s: because you just, you don't have the upper hand.
623.32s: You can't really, you can, you can make adjustments, but you don't actually know if they're going
627.48s: to work.
628.48s: And in all the other times, you can make adjustments and you know that they're going to help.
633.80s: But in a outlier move, you really don't know.
636.16s: So what we saw earlier this year, and we, what we saw in April, I'm sorry, in April,
640.72s: is, you know, something that was in outlier where you could, you could do the things you
644.64s: think you needed to do to protect yourself, but you really don't know if they're going
647.76s: to work.
648.76s: Sure, sure.
649.76s: Yeah.
650.76s: And I think for that move specifically, I follow the, the logic well now, how does this
655.20s: translate though to the way that you think about trading the market more broadly given the
659.52s: fact that we know to your point before that a tweet does move things now.
664.68s: And we don't know what's going to be in the tweet or when the tweet is coming.
668.16s: But yeah, I mean, that's, that's, that's the challenge.
671.00s: I mean, you know, that's the challenge.
674.84s: It also, it presents a longer, it presents a much more actually interesting question, which
682.32s: is, you know, does that?
686.44s: Is there risks to the integrity of the market because of that?
690.88s: See what bothers me about the, the Trump antics or the Trump way that he goes about, you
697.32s: know, governing whatever you want to call it, is not that, not what he does because I couldn't
702.04s: care less.
703.44s: It's the impact that it has on the integrity of the, of the financial markets and market
709.12s: structure as we know and respect it.
712.00s: And we, we, we require that integrity to be in place to make everything else work.
716.88s: And that's what scares me is when that comes into question.
720.28s: So it's, it's like this unintended consequence of, you know, of idiocy and that's what bothers
727.24s: me.
728.76s: Now one positive consequence of idiocy is, well, it's, it already goes up.
735.64s: So one opportunistic.
738.04s: So I do agree that it's positive for me.
741.40s: It's positive for you.
743.04s: It's opportunistic for everybody.
744.56s: There's no question about that.
746.08s: But again, it's not opportunistic.
749.48s: It's not because it was intentional.
751.40s: It's just opportunistic as it's a, it's a correlated side effect.
755.28s: And you write chaos and noise create opportunity.
761.32s: So opportunity is really good for all of us as traders, you know, stocks get cheap,
766.16s: right stocks get expensive.
767.96s: Great.
768.96s: You know, like opportunity is there.
770.48s: So chaos creates opportunity.
773.48s: One of the things I also find and I don't know if you'd agree with this.
776.12s: I'm actually genuinely curious what you would think.
778.32s: But when I find things are as unpredictable as they are, I almost feel like I use the
787.84s: term loosely, but like levels the playing field because I feel like if we're in a standard
793.36s: bull market, you have really smart analysts, really big institutions able to position
797.04s: super well, not that you're directly competing with them all the time.
800.16s: But there is a level of competition and compression.
802.88s: Whereas now that you have a dude that says, we're going to go easy on the tariffs.
807.00s: And then the first thing he says during the presentation of the tariffs is everybody
810.20s: gets a 10% tariff and the whole market's like, yo, what?
814.28s: That's not what anybody thought.
815.76s: It feels like everybody is caught off guard equally.
819.44s: So do you think that these kinds of markets actually lead to a little bit more dislocation
827.16s: that people can take advantage of?
828.60s: And if so, how would you go about taking advantage of it?
831.92s: Well, they lead to, they, yeah, they lead to, they lead to what we call destabilization
840.20s: much more so.
841.88s: And I like the term to destabilize markets because in certain cases, you're right.
849.28s: I am more comfortable in when the noise gets loud and the markets get destabilized.
855.80s: But I don't like when markets get destabilized by a single person or somebody has a singular
868.28s: ability to destabilize markets.
870.12s: I think that's very different from economic destabilization.
874.52s: And it's a much more dangerous situation because it can be, it can be manipulative.
879.24s: It's a feeling.
881.00s: So I think that that's a challenge.
883.96s: Definitely.
884.96s: But given that that is the reality, what are some of the ways that you think people could
890.20s: get along with it and take it for what it is and try to pull?
893.48s: Well, well, you try to, you know, I mean, I'm a contrarian.
896.56s: So the way, the way you deal with that is, you know, in, in my opinion, the way you
902.00s: deal with that is by staying relatively small and, and taking a, taking a contrarian
908.20s: approach.
909.20s: You know, what's, what's contrarian now?
914.00s: Because it's, it seems like there's a lot of, you know, micro contrarian takes you
918.28s: can come up with.
919.28s: But I feel like having like a broader contrarian view can be difficult.
923.52s: Yeah, it's, it's sometimes if the markets are crashing, it's next to impossible.
929.52s: Because the last thing you want to do is to buy anything because, you know, you're
932.24s: already getting killed.
933.92s: If the markets are rallying, it's a little easier because it's easier to sell into strength
938.16s: than it is by weakness.
940.00s: It's just, it's human nature.
941.48s: So, so that's it.
944.00s: But there are lots of other asset classes that I think, you know, you can take a little
948.68s: bit of a contrarian view.
949.84s: I mean, other than that, you know, there's two ways to take advantage of a destabilized
955.56s: market.
956.56s: A, you know, you can take a directional shot as a contrarian or as a trend trader or
960.60s: B, you know, you can sell premium.
962.72s: I mean, that's it.
963.48s: I mean, there are, there's nothing else you can really do.
966.04s: And a lot of people aren't that familiar with selling premiums.
968.28s: So, most people take a directional shot.
971.00s: Now for those that might be interested in, I imagine people that would be listening to
975.12s: this would be quite familiar with selling premium from our audiences.
979.44s: Are there specific kinds of approaches that you like to try to leverage now?
982.24s: I know you guys typically do 45 days out, managed close to 2021.
986.68s: Is there any adjustment or is it just straight across the board continuing?
991.64s: No, we never change really.
995.04s: So everything we do pretty much always stays the same regardless of market condition.
998.72s: I mean, we will trade different underlines and we will be a little bit, I mean, I'll
1006.04s: be a, I will look at different underlines, you know, subjectively depending on whatever
1013.08s: my opinion is of price extreme, there is no way of actually knowing if something's
1017.04s: at a price extreme.
1018.04s: I mean, it's just that's your, that's your gut, you know, but I think, I think, you
1022.84s: know, that's, that's essentially the big difference is we just, I look at the world that way.
1028.16s: I see.
1029.16s: Now, if you were to think about so far this year, like for you personally, anecdotally,
1033.76s: not, you know, from a massive data lens, but like what's been working for you this year
1037.96s: and what hasn't?
1044.84s: I would say this year, earnings plays, you know, being short some premium on the earnings
1052.20s: place has been probably, has been very good and sticking with sticking with some, contrarian
1064.68s: directional place has also been very good for me.
1069.56s: So like in other words, you know, like I was just as an example, I was bearish on a
1073.28s: dollar.
1074.28s: So from the beginning, from last year, and so sticking with those positions and, you
1080.12s: know, not giving up on things like that have been, have been probably the best trade of
1084.36s: the year.
1085.36s: In addition to like various earnings, short premium earnings plays things like that.
1089.84s: The most challenging thing this year has been trying to recover from being short a lot
1096.16s: of premium going into the whole meltdown in April.
1098.92s: Yeah, that's, yeah, that's been the challenge.
1103.00s: Watch me more about that.
1104.00s: So going into the meltdown again at a high level was the portfolio, I assume for you,
1111.36s: probably net short deltas and short premium or I was short delta and short premium, but
1116.44s: you don't need a very big down move to lose your short deltas.
1120.64s: So you know, I was short deltas at at 6,000 at 57 or 5800, you end up long deltas.
1128.64s: We went down to 4800.
1130.00s: So the challenge was trying to stay relatively neutral and it's very difficult to do when
1136.16s: Valetold is exploding because your short calls don't really help you against your short
1141.70s: puts.
1142.78s: So that was, that was the biggest challenge of the year so far.
1146.60s: And you know, coming back from that has been, you know, that's, we're still, we're still
1151.60s: fighting that battle.
1152.60s: Who kind of clawed out through what, what have you been doing to two phases specifically
1158.12s: in my mind during the more parabolic drop component?
1161.80s: And then what have you been doing since we started on, I don't know if you call it a
1165.30s: V or not yet, but since we started rallying back out.
1169.40s: Well the parabolic drop, that was, you know, I mean, I thought we got to 50, at first
1177.28s: I thought we got to 5500 that that would be probably pretty good level.
1181.68s: And then at 5200, I thought that would be a pretty good level at 5,000.
1187.44s: And I thought that would be a pretty good level.
1189.44s: So I think I nibbled all the way down 55, 52, 5,000.
1195.84s: And I did buy some stuff around 49 because that was just a spite trade.
1202.52s: But I, I think that I'm not a big double down person.
1207.40s: I don't really add to losers generally, but this time I thought there was an opportunity
1211.44s: there.
1212.44s: So, you know, so that was kind of, there was challenges there, but that kind of worked
1218.52s: out.
1219.52s: I think just the pure short premium was the was the ones that we could get back.
1225.00s: Got it.
1226.00s: And for those do you just caught them at some point or are you just still trying to roll them
1229.52s: out, roll them down, roll them where you can?
1236.56s: I hate taking losses, but sometimes there's nothing, you know, like I'll roll calls down.
1244.96s: And then on the rally back, the position just closed out.
1248.24s: So like, you know, it locked in losses.
1251.00s: But there's no way you can anticipate, you know, a thousand point rally, you know, or
1256.56s: you know, 800 point rallies.
1258.04s: So, you know, I mean, I played it like any other trader, I just wanted to get back, you
1263.64s: know, 30 to 60% because then I'd be happy, you know, that, you know, I'll just trade
1269.32s: around the rest.
1270.32s: And so I think that's how we played it.
1272.00s: So I think, you know, statistically or probabilistically, we played it pretty good.
1276.84s: You know, we played for, let's call it a 50% retracement.
1280.04s: We got it, you know, most of our positions got, you know, got taken away at that point
1284.36s: because we're short in the money calls and puts at that point.
1288.68s: And so I think that we did about as good as you can do because with that rally helped
1294.76s: obviously, but the last 300 or 400 points have been pretty tough.
1299.20s: Got it.
1300.20s: And when you're nibbling on the way down, what kind of scaling do you play with is it
1306.04s: same trade size on the way down?
1307.88s: Are you increasing size for like, you know, like, it's very difficult to increase size
1313.24s: because because the losses start to pile up.
1317.28s: And so you're very reluctant to increase size.
1320.28s: So no, I don't increase size.
1322.96s: If anything, you know, I might reduce my size, but I don't increase size.
1328.00s: No chance.
1329.00s: I want to be around.
1332.60s: What?
1333.60s: So like this, this is a big giant game to me.
1337.24s: It always has been.
1338.24s: It's never from 40 some odd years as a giant game.
1341.60s: And early on, I learned that because I watched people lose everything, you know, like on
1347.92s: the trading floor, people I knew, stuff like that, because they had a bug up their ass,
1351.84s: you know, they were like, this thing can't go any higher, can't go any lower.
1354.88s: And next thing, you know, they're like, hey, do you got 100 grand for me?
1357.84s: You know, like, you know, I'm like, this, I'm not playing that game.
1361.20s: Like I'm not playing that's not going to be that is not going to be my life.
1365.08s: And so I'm, I'm always in play.
1368.52s: Like I never put myself in a position.
1371.04s: We, I definitely learned this a long time back.
1374.28s: I'm never going to put myself in a position to, to blow myself out.
1379.48s: Speaking of what was your account utilization before the drop?
1385.04s: And how do you strike the balance, especially from a short premium side to, yeah, it's
1392.24s: definitely tough.
1393.24s: I was probably around before the drop.
1395.92s: I'm guessing I was in the 40s, you know, I tried a fairly large account.
1399.80s: So I was in probably the 40s, maybe, maybe mid 40s.
1405.04s: And during the drop, I got into the high 60s low 70s, which is a lot for me.
1413.12s: Honestly, I'm actually that seemed a little lighter than I was, I thought you were going
1416.24s: to say like 70 to 80.
1418.96s: I got into the low 70s.
1420.36s: I don't, I'm not usually like in the low 70s.
1422.52s: I'm like, right, right now I'm probably sitting around, you know, 30 something percent.
1429.76s: Right.
1430.76s: Yeah.
1431.76s: Yeah, that makes sense.
1432.76s: I'm especially given the rally that we've seen.
1434.72s: Yeah.
1435.72s: One more question on the move specifically.
1439.60s: So for the second phase, where you start to see some sort of recovery, how do you play
1445.64s: the account at that point?
1446.96s: Because obviously you're saying that we were about 60 or I'm sorry, like 30 to 40 to
1451.48s: begin 60 to 70 towards the bottom, but now we're lightened back up.
1456.24s: So what's going on during that recovery phase?
1458.64s: I mean, you're just trading them.
1460.20s: I mean, there's not like, I don't think you're thinking that much about, you know, once
1464.68s: you start to, once we start to come back a little bit and you're starting to make some
1468.60s: money back and, and you know, you're starting to have some good, finally, some, some positive
1474.20s: outcomes, I don't really think that much about, you know, I'm not somebody that lights
1479.60s: up necessarily.
1480.84s: I'm not pressing, but I'm not lighting up.
1483.48s: I'm trying to stay, keep those positions pretty consistent because, you know, I, I, I feel
1488.12s: like the market owes me and I want to get back.
1492.12s: Now with the recovery that we've had, a lot of this came from over the past weekend,
1498.24s: the news with Chinese tariffs and the talks.
1502.56s: Now that essentially exists for 90 days.
1507.00s: How do you play the rest of these 90 days?
1509.80s: Is it just business usual and then we'll see what happens.
1512.00s: Oh, yeah.
1513.00s: Yeah, you have to play business as usual.
1514.72s: You can't start to think, you know, like the, if you, if you try to, if you, if you think
1522.20s: you're going to out guess or out logic, something, it's never going to happen.
1527.72s: I mean, then you have to assume that the 90 days is perpetuity.
1532.72s: I mean, you have to assume that it's not, you know, it, I don't see it.
1537.00s: You see how it benefits anybody to, you know, to put the market back into a tailspinner.
1543.40s: And I mean, I just don't, you have to assume that this is, you just have to assume that
1551.12s: this is the way it's going to be for, for ever.
1554.56s: And then you deal with other situations that come up.
1557.08s: You can't start thinking about, you know, we never think about what happens if they don't
1561.28s: pass this or what happens if they don't get the bill signed or what happens if they don't
1566.48s: solve, you know, the budget crisis, you know, like you can't think about that stuff.
1569.84s: You have to assume, hey, it's all going to work out.
1571.80s: It always works out.
1572.80s: And let's just go forward.
1574.24s: Well, it's interesting because also, I think you could argue from the options markets,
1578.84s: the options markets probably have most of it figured out, you know, quote unquote to
1581.80s: that one.
1582.80s: Well, you can just look at, you can look at implied volatility and it basically tells
1586.28s: you, you know, right now implied volatility, it could not be any more clear.
1592.28s: You know, this is, it's not an issue right now.
1594.92s: If that's not what I think there, I think there are plenty, let's not, let's not, you
1601.88s: know, sure, quote this, you know, I mean, I mean, I just, I wrote about this, this weekend
1608.16s: and it was more like, you know, hey, hey, hey, the world just called what the hell are we
1612.08s: doing?
1613.08s: You know, like this is not, let's not make this out like this is normal behavior.
1617.60s: You know, America has put themselves in a very dangerous long term position as far as
1625.64s: our credibility and trust is concerned.
1628.00s: You know, we spent a hundred years building goodwill or over a hundred years building
1631.48s: goodwill, you know, and, and did we destroy that in less than six months?
1635.92s: That's a big question.
1637.16s: And so I think that, you know, and, and we don't know the internal damage that's been caused,
1643.52s: you know, by this trust factor because there's no way that the rest of the world looked
1649.84s: at us like we had their back no matter what.
1653.08s: It's clear now we don't have their back and they're never going to look at us that way
1656.68s: again.
1657.68s: So the question becomes how much money flows into America, you know, how much, how much
1662.68s: goodwill flows into the US and our markets, can our markets sustain these levels without
1668.08s: the same level of goodwill and capital and everything else.
1671.08s: And I don't know the answer yet.
1672.36s: Nobody does.
1673.36s: It's interesting.
1674.36s: That's an interesting perspective because I definitely don't share part of it.
1679.88s: The part I'd like to double click into is the idea because I do agree completely with
1684.36s: the destabilization by the way and just the way that this whole thing is gone has caused
1689.20s: a bit of a ruckus.
1690.48s: Sure.
1691.48s: But even through that, it does seem like there's a clear line that we're trying to negotiate
1696.92s: and talk with partners.
1699.52s: So to that end specifically though, when you look at the way that markets are likely to
1705.36s: evolve based on this new thing that's going on, what does that look like to you?
1711.04s: I mean, that's a, that's, that's kind of the million dollar question.
1716.20s: You know, I love the answer.
1717.84s: I wish I knew the answer.
1721.04s: You know, I, there's going to be many schools on many people are going to look at this
1726.32s: thing lots of different ways.
1728.04s: You know, I, I feel like we have done internal damage.
1734.80s: It is very difficult.
1736.44s: If there's no integrity, markets don't work.
1740.80s: And I worry about that probably more than anything else.
1744.36s: And I don't know if that's the way everybody else looks at it.
1747.64s: I think, you know, integrity is not a tweet saying, hey, we've got, we bought 90 days.
1753.84s: 90 is something that is, is much deeper and requires much more consideration.
1759.40s: And I worry about the integrity, you know, I mean, America is the, the single greatest
1766.88s: pull of liquidity and capital pull in the world a hundred times over.
1771.28s: Nobody's even close.
1773.16s: And so as we go, so goes everything else.
1777.48s: But we're also the engine that drives everything.
1781.72s: And we need everybody to play in our, in our playground.
1786.04s: And if everybody doesn't want to play in our playground, then we have kind of our own,
1791.36s: you know, isolated ecosystem, which cannot thrive and grow.
1797.72s: And I feel like that's essentially what we're telling the rest of the world is, hey, you
1801.84s: know what, we've got this ecosystem.
1803.28s: We don't need any of you.
1805.04s: But if you want to come and play, here's the toll.
1807.84s: And to me, that's, you know, incredibly short-sighted and stupid to other people.
1813.64s: They're like, hey, it's America first, whatever.
1817.00s: You know, I mean, I understand there's different sides.
1819.16s: But that's, that's where we are right now.
1820.92s: I think your perspective holds a lot of merit.
1823.68s: I, and I think there's a lot to it.
1825.80s: Now pivoting a little bit to there was a podcast I was listening to you a little while ago
1834.76s: that was talking about the necessity of taking risk.
1838.00s: You talk about risk a lot, which is always like, I'm a risk freak.
1841.84s: I love risk.
1842.84s: Yeah.
1843.84s: And one of the things you mentioned that I find, and I think it's just part of who you
1848.56s: are, even from the stories you told me when you were, you know, betting on the golf course,
1854.36s: it, to me, it seems like you have a very novel relationship with risk.
1859.32s: And you've mentioned before that you're not really worried about losing.
1863.48s: However, a lot of people that are investing or new traders, they're trading a small account.
1870.04s: So like a loss can be big deal to them.
1873.44s: Yeah.
1874.44s: Do you have any thoughts on like that person's paradigm and how they might be able to adopt
1880.32s: a little bit more of your paradigm, which largely I think is the better one to onboard?
1886.52s: You know, it's hard.
1888.52s: I wrote about it this weekend.
1890.44s: I ran into an old trader and a floor trader that I used to know.
1894.24s: We were buddies when we both traded, you know, on the seabull years ago.
1898.56s: And he said, you know, part I miss about trading is that I felt like no matter what was
1904.48s: happening anywhere in the world crashing, whatever we were doing, I controlled my own.
1909.92s: Like I felt in control.
1911.96s: So like I never, I never worried about it.
1914.04s: And I feel still feel like that today.
1916.48s: But he said as a retail investor now, I'm kind of like passive.
1921.24s: You know, I have to do something else and I don't follow my investments as much.
1926.24s: And I feel like I'm nervous as a passive investor because I don't control everything anymore.
1932.04s: And it's much more difficult for me.
1933.96s: And I go, yeah, that's definitely, you know, the kind of the feedback I get from lots of
1940.48s: people and from, and that's the impression I get from the whole kind of retail space.
1946.88s: It is much more challenging and a lot scarier when, you know, when you don't control, you
1953.52s: know, what's happening next?
1955.52s: Or we don't, when you don't control what you can do.
1958.04s: And so I get it, you know, that's that's scary part.
1962.96s: And that's why I think the integrity of the markets is so important.
1967.20s: So talk to me about some of the ways that you think retail trader though could get more
1972.12s: comfortable with taking risk and accepting of losses.
1976.20s: I mean, one thing you can do is you can control your own investments as opposed to letting
1983.32s: somebody else do it because when somebody else does it, you have no control over the
1987.44s: correlation risk in your portfolio.
1990.08s: So all you, all you know is that that person may put you into 10 different stocks, but
1994.72s: they all might be highly correlated to an extent of that it doesn't matter, you know,
1999.52s: markets going to do whatever the market does, it goes down, you're going to lose on all
2002.40s: of them.
2003.40s: If the market goes up, you're going to make on all of them.
2004.40s: But, but point being is that, you know, there is, there's nothing you can do to control
2010.52s: their risk.
2011.52s: The alternative is that if you do it yourself, you can put yourself in a handful of different
2017.40s: investments and you can keep your size so you can control whatever it is.
2023.40s: You control the decision making when you open the trade.
2028.60s: So you control what you put your money into and after that, market forces take over.
2033.76s: As opposed to the only thing you control is just who you give your money to, which I
2038.24s: think I don't like that.
2040.48s: So it sounds like there's a baked in element here though because my assumption would be
2045.08s: for people a lot of times when they're seeking external controls that they're seeking
2048.88s: external expertise because they're not comfortable with their own awareness or knowledge around
2056.92s: the thing.
2057.92s: Right, right.
2058.92s: Right.
2059.92s: It's exactly it.
2060.92s: There's a certain amount of, you know, they're nervous.
2065.32s: There's, they're nervous about their level of know-how.
2069.24s: And that's, you know, I mean, I understand that.
2072.40s: And I, you know, that's one of the things that we do, you know, with tasties, we try to,
2077.56s: you know, bridge that a little bit and create, you know, create a path or create ideas or
2082.96s: create engagement to get you over that fear thing.
2085.56s: But yeah, I totally get it.
2087.84s: There's two other things that actually you and I have talked about a similar topic before
2091.56s: that I'll throw out on your behalf and you can tell me if these were way off.
2095.56s: One of them is you guys talk a lot about sizing things, controlling risk on the onset, which
2102.04s: I think helps a lot with that.
2104.00s: And the other thing I've heard you talk about is just the overall utility gained from
2108.52s: taking risk and how sometimes that can overwhelm a temporary financial setback of some sort
2114.68s: in the context of what you learned through taking risk and making decisions.
2118.56s: Those two, I mean, that seems so, so obvious, doesn't it?
2122.44s: I mean, it seems so, it seems so simplistic and so obvious.
2128.08s: And yet I don't think that it's, it's commonplace, you know, I mean, you know, I mean,
2133.88s: when we think about all the decisions that we have in life that go into ultimately determining,
2143.24s: you know, who we are, what kind of wealth we create, what kind of opportunities we create
2148.28s: for ourselves, it all involves around risk taking.
2151.48s: And if you've never done it before, you'd likelihood that you're going to, you know, you're
2155.52s: going to nail it the first time is really hard.
2159.00s: And so, yeah, risk taking, you know, risk taking is huge.
2164.76s: And, you know, and you can see it when you just, when you, when you look around, you can
2169.64s: see how risk takers, you know, succeed.
2176.52s: Put yourself in enough positions that sooner or later, a couple of them can act.
2180.24s: Yeah, I mean, when you look around and you look at people that, you know, that they, when
2186.68s: you look at people that, that you think are, that you look up to, that you look at role models.
2193.16s: I don't care if it's, I don't care if it's the president, the president, I don't care if
2197.96s: it's the CEO of some, you know, huge company.
2200.64s: I don't care who it is.
2201.68s: I don't care if it's a sport star, whatever.
2204.56s: But, but when you look at different role models, I guarantee you every single person that
2210.28s: you're looking at as role models or risk taker.
2213.12s: It's not possible.
2214.12s: Like, nobody looks at a role model as somebody that was, that was handed it from generational
2221.64s: wealth.
2222.64s: Like, I don't think people, here are the best example I can give is like the royal family.
2228.20s: Okay.
2229.20s: And nobody looks at a younger member of the royal family, like whoever it might be, you
2235.92s: know, whatever, friends or whatever they are.
2239.04s: Whatever.
2240.04s: I don't even know.
2241.04s: I don't care.
2242.04s: But, but nobody looks at members of the royal family and goes, wow, that's what I aspire
2246.36s: to be.
2247.96s: Because you're not going to get that job.
2250.12s: Okay.
2251.12s: That's, that job is not for sale.
2252.20s: That job, you can be the greatest trader in the world, risk taker, whatever business person.
2256.92s: You're never going to be the principal whales.
2259.12s: Okay.
2260.12s: That's not going to happen.
2261.12s: So, so that kind of, you know, wealth that gets passed down, you know, that doesn't matter
2267.40s: to anybody.
2268.40s: That doesn't mean a damn thing to anybody.
2270.20s: But then you'll look at somebody, you know, and it could be, you know, any, it doesn't
2274.60s: matter who it is.
2275.60s: It could be like a base dose or something.
2277.84s: It could be, you know, it, it could be anybody that you that, and I'm not saying Jeff
2284.08s: basis, but it could be any CEO that got there that made it on their own, that worked their
2288.28s: way up through the ranks that started off as, you know, a dishwasher and ended up as
2292.44s: the CEO McDonald's, who knows?
2295.48s: Most of the people that you respect and you understand that the risk they took very few
2300.48s: of those people that get that level never or they built some amazing company got there without
2306.64s: taking ridiculous amounts of risk along the way.
2309.28s: You know, very few people just skated in the back on through the back door and it just
2313.52s: doesn't happen that way.
2314.84s: So I think that, you know, in my life, the most interesting people and the most incredible,
2321.88s: you know, minds they've ever got to sit down with and have dinner and I don't care
2325.40s: what they think about politically.
2326.68s: I don't care what they, you know, and we'll care about anything just like just sitting
2329.88s: there, bullshitting with people.
2332.08s: The most incredible entrepreneurs are always self made crazy risk takers.
2338.24s: Always everyone, fast decision makers, crazy risk takers, put it all out there.
2344.00s: Now how do you, how do you think about the the survivorship bias that goes into that?
2351.44s: Right?
2352.44s: One of those people you're sitting down with, there's a hundred that tried the same thing
2356.44s: that night might not have grown up in the right place like Bill Gates and had access to
2360.44s: the computer and they failed miserably because they didn't have the same thing.
2364.56s: So like how do you, how do you think about that element of it?
2367.72s: Because that's totally cool.
2370.08s: That's, that's exactly what the way it should be.
2372.72s: There's, there's got to be, you know, it's, it's just a normal distribution curve.
2382.44s: Okay.
2383.20s: And when you look at the outliers who have had crazy success, you know, the, the ones that
2389.16s: have started from nothing and built something through risk or whatever, you know, you're
2393.00s: talking about, you know, a fraction of, a fraction of a tenth of a percent.
2400.08s: So it's just, you're really looking, you know, you're just looking deeper into a very
2404.44s: detailed distribution curve, you know, but I can guarantee you that the people that try
2409.84s: and fail are much more likely to be successful than the bottom 50% of the people in that distribution
2418.32s: curve.
2419.32s: So if you start off with a hundred people and you have maybe one tenth of one person that
2424.60s: gets to a crazy level, okay, there are going to be 16 people in there that do really
2432.00s: well.
2433.00s: And there's going to be, there's going to be 34 more people that are above average.
2437.88s: So 50% are going to be of the risk takers are going to outperform.
2443.36s: That's great odds.
2445.32s: You know, world where everybody thinks everything's against them and all this crap and blah,
2449.32s: blah, blah and everything.
2450.56s: The reality is if you could put most people in a situation where you said, listen, you
2454.40s: got a one and two chance.
2456.16s: They would take it, but they don't understand that.
2459.44s: So I don't buy into the, hey, you know, 95% of the people don't make it.
2464.16s: No, not 95%.
2465.64s: 95% of the people don't become, you know, multi millionaires or billionaires or that.
2470.80s: But 50% of the people are way better off than everybody else.
2475.84s: And because they've learned how to take risk and take shots and do whatever.
2480.20s: The other thing I honestly would expect you to say and I don't know if this is accurate,
2484.52s: but I also would imagine that you would think that the people in the bottom 50 that took
2489.72s: the shot and failed still would probably be better off after taking the shot and failing.
2495.48s: Of course.
2496.48s: Yeah.
2497.48s: And listen, there's going to be, there's going to be a certain percentage.
2502.44s: Maybe it's 15% or whatever that take the shot that learned the risk that never recover.
2509.48s: That we would be, it would be foolish for us to sit here and say that that doesn't happen
2513.60s: because it absolutely does.
2515.72s: And you know, that's the unfortunate part.
2518.44s: You know, this is, this is a, we're a capitalistic society.
2526.04s: Okay, this is a free market.
2528.20s: You know, this is not, we're not living in North Korea or something like that.
2536.04s: We're not living in a place where, you know, we're guaranteeing everybody everything.
2540.20s: We're living in a place where, where it is a relatively fair free market.
2546.84s: And that's always been the greatest thing about America.
2550.28s: And that's why everybody wants to come here.
2551.96s: That's why, that's why we are, you know, that's why we have the most money and, and the most
2559.88s: efficient markets.
2562.20s: Based on that conversation, a lot of new traders, they start with their $5,000 count.
2568.12s: And their aspirations are to turn this into their future wealth.
2572.28s: Yeah, that's ridiculous.
2573.56s: And if you were to give that group of people some guidance in terms of what instead to focus on
2580.36s: in order to leverage the experience of taking the risk, but to turn it into something more practical
2586.28s: longer term, what kind of guidance would you give that person?
2589.72s: Well, because the, the $5,000 is, I mean, there have been people that have turned $5,000
2598.04s: into our ridiculous amount of money.
2600.20s: But the statistical chance of doing that is, is minuscule.
2603.96s: I did an interview with somebody once he turned, he was, he was,
2611.96s: an engineer and he turned a $3,000 count into about, I think, about seven and a half million.
2621.80s: Literally a $3,000 count.
2624.12s: And over, over a very short period of time, like maybe two or three years.
2630.28s: And I'm like, he's like this, and he showed me everything.
2633.24s: And I looked it up, like looked at everything we had all is wrecked.
2636.52s: It was amazing.
2637.56s: And I'm like, you know, I go, I've never seen anybody do this before, a $3,000 count.
2642.60s: It goes really?
2643.24s: And I go, yeah, he's like, it's like, oh, okay, that's kind of cool.
2647.64s: You know, then I'm like, yeah, it's amazing.
2649.40s: But the reality is that most people with a $5,000 count,
2654.68s: you know, they end up in a couple of years with either a $3,000 count or an $8,000 count.
2662.76s: You know, whatever, whatever, normal.
2664.52s: Right.
2665.32s: So, but the people that don't end up with a $3,000 count or an $8,000 count are infinitely
2673.00s: better positioned to articulate everything from financial strategies to how markets work,
2680.76s: to how the economy works to just be able to talk about things that most other people can talk
2686.60s: about to differentiate themselves to make that experience so valuable that they're
2695.00s: in an infinitely better spot than the person that never opened that $5,000 count, period.
2700.84s: And so that's where I am on that.
2703.24s: Yeah, I think it makes sense.
2705.00s: You're coming about that interview also reminds me.
2707.24s: I saw like a live stream with Keith Gill, the dude from GameStop roaring kitty that he was
2713.24s: almost a billionaire on this talk.
2716.68s: It's just so crazy to see those numbers thrown around.
2719.64s: So it's it's fun to see that was a different.
2722.12s: That's a different situation.
2723.32s: But yeah, definitely the broader point being that it some people do find that path,
2729.72s: which is always cool to see.
2730.92s: So it's cool to hear about that other interview that you were talking about.
2734.68s: Now taking that advice of being better off, what then is the next step for those traders to then
2743.48s: take the experience side of it, but then actually turn trading into something that is like true
2749.64s: value add and like a wealth generation vehicle for them.
2754.84s: You know, it's so funny that you're asking that question because honestly,
2761.48s: this is this has been top of mind for me for the last decade.
2767.32s: Like I don't really talk about this at all because I don't I don't want to talk about this
2775.72s: particular question because I don't want to get off track most of the time.
2780.84s: You know, this is different.
2781.80s: It's podcasts.
2782.44s: So it's a little different.
2783.24s: I don't talk about this on network.
2785.00s: But this is a question that I've been battling in turn myself and trying to
2794.12s: try and decide how to address it for a long time.
2798.12s: I'm in the process now of building software to literally to address that question because
2806.52s: because I think that that's the holy grail.
2811.16s: I'm surprised you asked it because honestly, I don't know if I've ever been asked the question.
2816.20s: I thought this was just something that sat in the back of my head and it's just been
2821.24s: it's been eating away at me for the last decade.
2825.48s: But I'm spending a lot of time and money trying to answer that question.
2834.04s: Like how do we how do we create how do we create wealth without necessarily creating wealth?
2848.04s: How do we create wealth through know-how and how do we create wealth through experience and
2852.36s: how do we create wealth through differentiation and how does how does somebody monetize that know-how?
2859.96s: And I've gotten to the point where I feel pretty confident that for the first time
2866.68s: in the last like 18 months we're making progress on building technology to help answer those
2872.12s: questions because if I was 22 years old or I was 18 or I was 25 or 30, like that's what I'd want to
2880.76s: know. Like I'm not foolish enough to think that I'm not foolish enough to think that I'm going to
2886.44s: walk into Caesar's palace with $2,000 and change my life. Okay.
2893.56s: And I'm not foolish enough to think that I'm going to open an account at Tasty and with
2898.84s: $2,500 and change my life financially. But there has to be something there.
2907.96s: There has to be. And what's there, what's real world, what's street smarts, I can get out of that.
2914.92s: You know, it has to be a way to for me to understand that and how to utilize that. And I think,
2923.56s: that's what we're working on. I'm sure you can't go into detail so I won't probe on it. But do you
2929.40s: have any high level thoughts you can share around the thing that you're working on in terms of
2937.48s: potential use case or like when people might expect it? Later this year.
2945.24s: And the use case, the use case is really, the use case is interesting. The use case is, is
2955.00s: I think for way too long, we kind of take what we do for granted, like whatever it is that we do,
2963.56s: whether you're in technology or you're in finance or you're a professional something or you're,
2970.68s: or you're in manufacturing, you know, you're a laborer, whatever it is. There's a lot of things
2976.60s: that we do in life that we, I think we don't realize what the,
2986.44s: the know how that comes with those with those roles. I think we don't utilize it because we
2991.80s: because we have very narrow, we have a very narrow vision. And in order to, in order to expand on
2999.80s: that vision, we need help. And so I think there are technological solutions and I think there are
3008.12s: quantitative solutions. And I've been spending like, it's basically been the last year and a half
3013.40s: of my life, you know, focusing on that kind of, you know, because, because I'm like you, you know,
3019.56s: I want somebody with a $5,000 account to understand the value of selling a vertical spread.
3028.20s: You know, I want you to understand, you know, how the world works by selling and out of the money put.
3035.72s: I don't give a crap if you make, you know, $30. You know, that doesn't mean anything to me. I want
3041.64s: you to understand what just happened. And, and how do you, how do you turn that into $3 million,
3047.72s: $20 years from now? And this tool will help with that. Yes, I think so. I believe so.
3058.84s: That's so exciting. Yeah, no, I will follow up with you when we're ready to roll out stuff. You
3064.12s: will hear about it. It's really fascinating. But, um, I'm, I'm just, you know, like, you know, I mean,
3071.40s: we have tunnel vision. We all have tunnel vision. And it's just, it's cool to think that there's,
3076.12s: you know, what you can do today with technology is pretty wild.
3080.04s: That's so cool. One of the things I find, especially when I talk to a lot of traders is the
3085.32s: over emphasis of like the outcome of individual trades versus like the process behind it. So,
3092.04s: it sounds like this can help frame some of that, which is really cool, I think.
3096.36s: Yeah, we get hung up on on P and L.
3099.56s: You know, we get, which is, which is right, like getting hung up on, you know, wins and losses and
3104.68s: all that kind of stuff, which is totally understandable. But you can understand now why I care so much
3111.24s: about the integrity of what we do, you know, because, because I don't want to jeopardize that.
3119.16s: You know, I don't want any person or any administration or any government or anybody to,
3126.04s: to jeopardize kind of this free market machine that lets us be creative and innovative and
3134.20s: lets us do things that you can't do anywhere else. And that's what we're protecting.
3140.28s: Right. Yeah, it makes tons of sense. Couple last questions before we get you out of here.
3146.52s: Sure. Looking forward for the rest of the year, I actually thought it was really fascinating that
3152.12s: you said that you were expecting lows in like the first half. That's like quite
3156.68s: pressing and receptive of you. So what led you to think that? And then what are you thinking then
3165.16s: broadly for the rest of the year? I mean, look, what do I know? Last year, I thought we were
3175.16s: going to close at 4800 and we closed at 6100. So I was only off by 1300 points.
3186.04s: And yes, like running error. Yeah, yeah, just 25 to 30% and you know, rounding error. Exactly.
3192.68s: So what do I know? I know nothing. I've been doing this my whole life. I know nothing.
3197.00s: Before the year started, I thought we would close the year at about 5700. We're at 5859,
3202.84s: not 5900 tonight. But and I only felt like that because I thought that after, you know,
3210.36s: a crazy run up to the last, whatever you want to say, 15 years, you know, maybe we needed a little
3215.16s: bit of a pullback. I expect, I think the damage has been done this year, meaning the Vol spike in
3223.96s: April, I think was a very important, you know, high in volatility and a high in risk and probably
3232.28s: a low in the market. So I don't think the 4800, 5000 levels going to be going to be retested
3238.84s: this year. And I also think that there's enough skepticism out there and and valid reasons for
3248.76s: that skepticism. And I also think with the bonds at 113 right now, there is, you know, I don't see
3255.32s: us going to new highs anytime soon. So I think we're in a trading range. I think the worst, we've
3260.84s: seen the worst of volatility. And and I, I would expect that, you know, suggesting that we could
3268.52s: be range bound between 6000 and 50400 is probably pretty reasonable. And what do you think of
3276.92s: all hanging around the 18 handle? Because I mean, obviously it's a far cry from being in the 56,
3283.00s: but that's still elevated slightly compared to longer term averages. What do you think about?
3288.20s: It's about, it's about 10% elevated right now. I mean, I, I think that all traders prefer
3295.72s: 20 to 22 in a perfect world, 20 to 25, but 2022 is cool. 18 is the low end of the preferred range,
3304.04s: but it's way better than 16. You know, in, in Trump's first term, 2017, which was the first,
3310.28s: which would be like an equivalent year till 2025, we didn't even have a 1% move all year.
3316.04s: It was the worst year ever for volatility. So I was worried this year, you know, that there
3320.92s: might be a low in volatility, but clearly that has not been the case. I think now that there's a
3327.00s: better chance for the second half of the year to have some a little bit, you know, lower expectations
3331.64s: in volatility. Got it. Well, you heard it here first. If Tom is wrong, you just shoot him some
3337.80s: hate mail or something like that, but oh, just don't worry. I don't, I don't read the hate mail
3342.60s: because I get plenty of it. So, you know, like somebody said to me once they go, because I,
3346.52s: because I'm talking every day and I never shut up and, and, and I, I drive, I piss a lot of people
3352.36s: off and I, you know, I make a lot of people really happy and I piss a lot of people off. I haven't
3356.28s: found it, but I don't read like I will not go on Twitter. I don't read any Instagram. I mean,
3362.84s: I watch TikTok, but not my own stuff. Like I won't look at any social media feedback. I mean,
3367.64s: I read my own emails and, and I, and I love the, some guy told me today to essentially curl up
3374.36s: and die and you know, like there was, there was, I get those occasionally. Yeah, yeah, that was fun.
3379.88s: But I, but I also get a lot of, you know, really, you know, it's about probably 20 to one positive.
3386.36s: So I'm okay with that email wise. So this easy. That's life. You know what? You got to, you know,
3392.20s: it's, it's totally, I love the fact that we create engagement and I think that's cool.
3398.60s: Well, hopefully we'll not do the curl up and die one, but
3403.24s: as well, by the way, was the name of a hairdressing salon in Chicago. And I thought it was a great name.
3410.04s: A great name curl up and die. That's great. Well, it's spelled die. D-Y-E.
3414.76s: That's better. Yeah. Okay. That adds a lot of clarity. I was going to say that's an
3418.76s: insane place. Yeah. It was right down the street from my first apartment in Chicago. So I,
3424.60s: I never forget that place. It's not business anymore. But it was curl up and die. I'm like,
3428.60s: well, that's a great name. Did you ever get your hair down there? No, I didn't.
3433.56s: I thought you might have. Now, sorry. All right. Well, maybe next time. Super fun conversation.
3440.52s: Thanks for the time as always, Tom. I'll follow up with you and look him forward to catch up again.
3445.96s: Until next time. Thank you.
