 You know, it's so funny that you're asking that question because honestly, this has been top of mind for me for the last decade. Like I don't really talk about this at all because I don't want to talk about this particular question because I don't want to get off track most of the time. This is different. It's podcast. I don't talk about this the network, but this is a question that I've been battling in turn myself and trying to try and decide how to address it for a long time. What's up everyone. Welcome back to the outlier podcast. We have a familiar face. I mean, a familiar face from a bunch of places at this point. People see you every single day, but we have a Tom back. Great to see you again. Thanks. Thanks for having me. So last time we spoke, I was a few months ago, I tried to catch up with you like every few months just to see how things are going and what's materializing. And we were obviously talking about the new, just dynamic of markets economy, that kind of stuff. And I know you're not like that into the economy, like a data perspective in terms of how it informs your trading, but I still find this stuff fascinating. So I'm going to drag you through it for a few moments anyways at a high level, 2025. How is it playing out in your general world view and the economy might the way I look at it is they're intertwined. They're different, but they're still intertwined and they reflect one another in different ways. The stock market is playing out surprisingly a lot like I thought it would. I thought it'd be the first half of this year. And I didn't think we were going much of anywhere this year. So I think that the lows surprised me, the lows surprised me, but being down on the year. And I thought we'd kind of, you know, between 5,500 and 57, 50, I thought that's kind of where we're going to spend most of the year. So that part of it doesn't really surprise me. So stock market wise, I think I'm in line. I think I'm not sure that I'm thinking about the economy just as from just a very like the 500 foot view. I'm surprised how well we have settled for the insanity of this administration. I'm surprised for how accepting we've been of a self-inflicted trade war and the pure, you know, just the incredibly high level of stupidity coming out of Washington. It's bothersome that we have accepted it the way we have. So for me, that's the biggest surprise. I don't think, I wouldn't say it's like an economic surprise. If I had to pick one part of the markets that probably is a surprise, maybe it's maybe it's where the bond market is, maybe it's interest rates right now more than it stocks or anything else. But I think in general, it's that the markets held up reasonably well given the amount of I think self-inflicted concerns and conflicts that I have about, you know, what's happening in what's happening in politics. Got it. Now talk to me about the initial drop, the way that that played out because I, the news component to its interesting, you're talking about some of the polls, you know, elements who, which is interesting. So did anything stand out about that drop, velocity, duration, recovery, anything like that? Well, of course. I mean, any time you get a move of that, I mean, that was basically a crash. You know, we're talking about late March to early to mid April was essentially a crash. And anytime you get, you know, a once in every seven years, you know, volatility expansion, once you get a drop of, you know, a thousand points in the S&Ps, you know, you're talking, you know, this is major stuff. There was, there was a lot of money lost. There was, you know, there was a lot of damage. And so anytime you get that kind of a market move for whatever the reason is, I think it's really bad. And you get that kind of a market move and you feel like it's more self-inflicted. It's even more troublesome or bothersome. Straighting, yeah. Yeah. And frustrating. Yeah. Because you kind of think this could have been avoided. And so I think that, you know, I don't like when people mess with the integrity of free markets that bothers me. And so, you know, that's my biggest issue. I don't like people messing with mother nature. Right. I see. One of the things I found interesting is like a couple of the recent drops that we've had in like the last five years or so have seen to follow not the same script, but a similar script just in terms of the qualities of the down move. We're not seeing like the same compression of like a standard bear market. Maybe that we saw in 22. That was a little more normal. I would say. I think 22 was a more, more traditional bear market, you know, I mean, the pandemic, I think you can look at that as, you know, that was another kind of an outlier. I wouldn't say it's often flicked, but I would say that it was just, it was, it was something new and something very strange. And I think that that was, you know, I mean, it was short lived as well. This opens up another question. Markets typically trying to discount into the future. And I'm curious from your background in like actual markets being in the pit and whatnot. With the kind of news driven cycle that we're in right now, what, like what kind of impact does that have in the pit style environment? I know again, things have changed a lot, but I'm just curious from an information, digestion positioning perspective, because you could see it on the day to day, right? Like tariffs around market crashes tariffs are off market. It's like that seems so difficult to try to position. So I'm wondering from your background, how these kinds of environments play out in that world. Well, you can't position for, you know, there's no such thing as positioning for a tweet. But we've only had, you know, essentially one president in history, this country that's that that you've had to position for that. So, you know, I mean, that's where we are. I don't think as a pit trader or as an active trader that you do position for any of that stuff. I don't think that that's part of what's in your, you know, I, I don't think you tried to prepare for, for something that's not quantifiable. I think that you, you have to prepare the way we look at the way we look at the world. Or I shouldn't say we the way I look at the world is I am prepared for anything within two standard deviations. And when you get into three standard deviations, I'm not prepared. So, so I live in a world of two standard deviations or less, which is essentially the world that, you know, you're protected by randomness, not fooled by randomness. And that is essentially, you know, where I live and where I thrive it. So inside of two standard deviations, I like that outside of two standard deviations where it gets into three and four standard deviations, five standard deviations where you can't quantify it. I don't, I don't do well there. And, and again, that's a, that's a matter of preference. And I think when people start to understand that, I think that that's, you know, I think that's, I think that's an interesting, that's an interesting discussion to have. Because I think there are certain people that, like, you know, that, that live their whole life playing for an outlier move. And it's a, it's a very lonely place. Do you, do you play crafts? I do. That's actually funny. It's like, okay. Yeah. Well, if you play crafts, it's like, it's like, you're the only person at table betting that don't. And that's, that's, that's essentially, like, I don't like people that bet that don't. Not, is it anything wrong with it? It's just like, you know, what, we're there to have fun. Nobody wants to bet that don't bet against everybody. I, I don't like playing for outlier moves. The same way I don't like betting that don't. I think that, you know, up to two standard deviations is a very reasonable expectation. One standard deviation has a high probability of a touch. Two standard deviations has a much lower chance, but that's where the whole financial industry lives. And I think that that's a reasonable place to set expectations inside of when we get outside of that, it gets confusing. And that's, I think, you know, anytime, like what recently happened in April, we got outside of two standard deviations, that's confusing. Now, talk to me about the confusion, though, because we know, we know it's going to be confusing. And I imagine that there's got to be some sort of approach that you would take to at least moderately adapt, given the circumstance. So you certainly, you certainly can try, but you have to give it a fair analogy. Anytime you're in a kind of like a crash, you know, just think of yourself in a, in a bad, in a bad situation, you're driving down the road and there's a patch of ice, you know, it's black ice. You can't see it. So your car spins. There, there's not a lot you can do. That's a, that's a three or four standard deviation event when, when something's outside of your control, you spin on black ice, a tire blows up, you know, you know, something happens on the road that you couldn't see. You know, there, there's all these different things that, that it's very hard to control, because you just, you don't have the upper hand. You can't really, you can, you can make adjustments, but you don't actually know if they're going to work. In, in all the other times, you can make adjustments and you know that they're going to help. But in a outlier move, you really don't know. So what we saw earlier this year, and when we, when we saw in April, I'm sorry, in April, is, you know, something that was an outlier where you could, you could do the things you think you needed to do to protect yourself, but you really don't know if they're going to work. Sure, sure. Yeah. And I think for that move specifically, I follow the, the logic, well, now, how does this translate though to the way that you think about trading the market more broadly given the fact that we know to your point before that a tweet does move things now. And we don't know what's going to be in the tweet or when the tweet is coming. But yeah, I mean, that's, that's, that's the challenge. I mean, you know, that's the challenge. It also, it presents a longer, it presents a much more actually interesting question, which is, you know, does that. Is there risks of the integrity of the market because of that. See what bothers me about the, the Trump antics or the Trump way that he goes about, you know, governing whatever you want to call it. Is not that not what he does because I couldn't care less. It's the impact that it has on the integrity of the market of financial markets and market structure as we know and respect it. And we, we, we require that integrity to be in place to make everything else work. And that's what scares me is when that comes into question. So it's, it's like this unintended consequence of, you know, of idiocy and that's what bothers me. Now one positive consequence of idiocy is, well, it's a little he goes up. So one opportunistic. So I do agree that it's positive for me. It's positive for you. It's opportunistic for everybody. There's no question about that. But again, it's not opportunistic. It's not because it was intentional. It's just opportunistic as it's a, it's a correlated side effect. And you're right. Chaos and noise create opportunity. So opportunity is really good for all of us as traders, you know, stocks get cheap. Great. Stocks get expensive. Great. You know, like opportunity is there. So chaos creates opportunity. One of the things I also find and I don't know if you to agree with this. I'm actually genuinely curious what you would think. But when I find things are as unpredictable as they are, I almost feel like I use a term loosely, but like levels the playing field. Because I feel like if we're in a standard bull market, you have really smart analysts, really big institutions able to position super well. Not that you're directly competing with them all the time. But there is a level of competition and depression. Whereas now that you have a dude that says, we're going to go easy on the tariffs. And then the first thing he says during the presentation of the tariffs is everybody gets a 10% tariff in the whole markets like, yo, what? That's not what anybody thought it feels like everybody is caught off guard equally. So do you think that these kinds of markets actually lead to a little bit more dislocation that people can take advantage of? And if so, how would you go about taking advantage of it? Well, they lead to, yeah, they lead to, they lead to what we call destabilization much more so. And I like the term to destabilize markets because in certain cases, you're right. I am more comfortable in when the noise gets loud and the markets get destabilized. But I don't like when markets get destabilized by by a single person or somebody has a singular ability to destabilize markets. I think that's very different from economic destabilization. And it's a much more dangerous situation because it can be it can be manipulating. So I think that that's as a challenge. Definitely, but given that that is the reality, what are some of the ways that you think people could get along with it and take it for what it is and try to pull. Well, well, you try to, you know, I mean, I'm a contrarian. So the way the way you deal with that is, you know, in my opinion, the way you deal with that is by staying relatively small and and taking a turn, taking a contrarian approach. What's what's contrarian now because it seems like there's a lot of, you know, micro contrarian takes you can come up with. But I feel like having like a broader contrarian view can be difficult. Yeah, it's sometimes if the markets are crashing, it's next to impossible because the last thing you want to do is to buy anything because you know, you're already getting killed. If the markets are rallying, it's a little easier because it's easier to sell into strength that it is buying the weakness. It's just it's human nature. So, so that's it. But there are lots of other asset classes that I think, you know, you can take a little bit of a contrarian view. But other than that, you know, there's two ways to take advantage of a destabilized market, a, you know, you can take a directional shot as a contrarian or as a trend trader or be, you know, you can sell premium. I mean, that's it. I mean, there are, there's nothing else you can really do. And a lot of people aren't that familiar with selling premiums. So most people take a directional shot. Now, for those that might be interested in, I imagine people that would be listening to this would be quite familiar with selling premium from our audiences. Are there specific kinds of approaches that you like to try to leverage now? I know you guys typically do 45 days out, manage close to 2021. Is there any adjustment or is it just straight across the board continuing? No, we never change really. So everything we do pretty much always stays the same regardless of market condition. I mean, we will trade different underlines and we will be a little bit. I mean, I mean, I'll be a, I will look at different underlines, you know, subjectively, depending on whatever my opinion is of price extreme, there is no way of actually knowing if something's at a price extreme. And I think that's just that's your, that's your gut, you know, but I think I think you know, that's, that's essentially the big differences we just, I look at the world that way. I see. Now, if you were to think about so far this year, like for you personally, in a totally not, you know, from a massive data lens, but like what's been working for you this year and what hasn't. I would say this year, earnings plays, you know, being short some premium on the earnings plays has been probably has been very good and sticking with sticking with some contrarian directional plays has also been very good for me. So like in other words, you know, like I was just as an example, I was bearish on the dollar. So from the beginning from last year. And so sticking with those positions and, you know, not giving up on things like that have been, have been probably the best trade of the year in addition to like various earnings, short premium earnings plays things like that. And so, you know, I think that's the biggest difference between the two of you that I think is the most important thing this year has been trying to recover from being short a lot of premium going into that the whole meltdown in April. Yeah, that's been the challenge. Talk to me more about that. So going into the meltdown again at a high level was the portfolio. I assume for you, probably net short deltas and short premium or I was short delta and short premium. And then you're very big down move to lose your short delta. So, you know, I was short delta is it at 6000 at 50 7 or 5800 you end up long delta. We went down to 4800. So the challenge was trying to stay relatively neutral. And it's very difficult to do when Val to is exploding because your short calls don't don't really help you against your short puts. So that was that was the biggest challenge of the year so far. And, you know, coming back from that has been, you know, that's we're still we're still fighting that battle. So, you know, I think we're going to be going on out through what what have you been doing to two phases specifically in my mind during the more parabolic drop component. And then what have you been doing since we started on I don't know if you call it a V or not yet, but since we started rallying back out. So that was, you know, I mean, I thought we got to 50 at first I thought we got to 5500 that that would be probably pretty good level. And then at 5200 I thought that would be a pretty good level at 5000 I thought that would be a pretty good level. So I think I nibbled all the way down 5552 5000. And I did buy some stuff around 49. Because that was just a spite trade, but I I think that I'm not a big double down person I don't really add to losers generally, but this time I thought there was an opportunity there so, you know, so so that that was kind of there was challenges there, but that kind of worked out. I think just the pure short premium was the was the ones that we could get back. Got it. And for those do you just caught them at some point or you just still trying to roll them out, roll them down, roll them where you can. I hate taking losses, but sometimes there's nothing, you know, like like I'll roll calls down. And then on the rally back, the position just closed out so like you know it locked in losses, but there's no way you can anticipate, you know, a thousand point rally, you know, or you know 800 point rally. So, you know, I mean, I played it like any other trader, I just wanted to get back, you know, 30 to 60% because then I'd be happy, you know, I'll just trade around the rest. And so I think that's how we played it. So I think, you know, statistically or probabilistically, we played it pretty good. You know, we played for let's call it a 50% retracement. We got it, you know, most of our positions got, you know, got taken away at that point because we're short in the money calls and puts at that point. And so I think that we did about as good as you can do because with that rally helped obviously, but the last 300 or 400 points have been pretty tough. Got it. And when you're nibbling on the way down, yeah, what kind of scaling do you play with is it same trade size on the way down, are you increasing size for like the way down it's very difficult to increase size because because the losses start to pile up. And so you're very reluctant to increase size. So no, I don't increase size. If anything, you know, I might reduce my size, but I don't increase size, no chance. I want to be around. So like this, this is a big giant game to me. It always has been, it's never from 40 some odd years as a giant game. And early on, I learned that because I watched people lose everything, you know, like on the trading floor, people I knew, stuff like that, because they had a bug up their ass, you know, they were like this thing can't go any higher, can't go any lower. And next thing, you know, they're like, hey, you got 100 grand for me. You know, I'm like, this, I'm not playing that game. Like I'm not playing that's not going to be that is not going to be my life. And so I'm always in play. Like I never put myself in a position. I definitely learned this a long time back. I'm never going to put myself in a position to blow myself out. Speaking of what was your account utilization before the drop and how do you strike the balance, especially from a short premium side to. Yeah, it's definitely tough. I was probably around before the drop I'm guessing I was in the 40s, you know, I try out fairly large accounts. So I was in probably the 40s, maybe, maybe mid 40s. And during the drop, I got into the high 60s low 70s, which is a lot for me. Honestly, I'm actually that seemed a little lighter than I was, I thought you were going to say like 70 to 80. I got into the low 70s. I don't, I'm not usually like in the low 70s. Like right. Right now I'm probably sitting around, you know, 30 something percent. Right. Yeah, which yeah, that makes sense. It's essentially given the rally that we've seen. Yeah, one more question on the move specifically. So for the second phase, where you start to see some sort of recovery. How do you play the account at that point? Because obviously you're saying that we were about 60 or I'm sorry like 30 to 40 to begin 60 to 70 towards the bottom. But now we're lightened back up. So what's going on during that recovery phase? I mean, you're just trading them. I mean, there's not like, I don't think you're thinking that much about, you know, once you start to, once we start to come back a little bit and you're starting to make some money back and, and you know, you're starting to have some good. Finally, some, some positive outcomes. I don't really think that much about, you know, I'm not somebody that lights up necessarily. I'm not pressing. But I'm not lighting up. I'm trying to stay keep those positions pretty consistent because, you know, I, I feel like the market owes me and I want to get back. Now, with the recovery that we've had, a lot of this came from over the past weekend, the news with Chinese tariffs and the talks. Now, that essentially exists for 90 days. How do you play the rest of these 90 days is it just business usual and then we'll see what happens. Yeah, you have to play business as usual. You can't start to think. You know, like, if you, if you try to, if you think you're going to out guess or out logic, something, it's never going to happen. Then you have to assume that the 90 days is perpetuity. I mean, you have to assume that it's not, you know, it, I don't see how it benefits anybody to, you know, to put the market back into a tailspinner. I mean, I just don't, you have to assume that this is. You just have to assume that this is the way it's going to be for, for ever. And then you deal with other situations that come up. You can't start thinking about, you know, we never think about what happens if they don't pass this or what happens if they don't get the bill signed or what happens if they don't solve, you know, the budget Christ, you know, you can't think about that stuff. You have to assume, hey, it's all going to work out. It always works out and let's just go forward. Well, it's interesting because also I think you could argue from the options markets. The options market is probably have most of it figured out, you know, quote unquote to that one. Well, you can just look at, you can look at implied volatility and it basically tells you, you know, right now implied volatility. It could not be any more clear. This is, it's not an issue right now. Like that's not what I think there, I think there are plenty. Let's not, let's not, you know, sure, quote this, you know, I mean, I mean, I just, I wrote about this, this weekend and it was more like, you know, hey, hey, hey, the world just called what the hell are we doing? You know, like this is not, let's not make this out like this is normal behavior. You know, America has put themselves in a very dangerous long term position as far as our credibility and trust is concerned. You know, we spent a hundred years building goodwill or over a hundred years building goodwill, you know, and did we destroy that in less than six months? That's a big question. And so I think that, you know, and we don't know the internal damage that's been caused, you know, by this trust factor because there's no way that the rest of the world looked at us like we had their back no matter what. It's clear now we don't have their back and they're never going to look at us that way again. So the question becomes how much money flows into America, you know, how much, how much goodwill flows into the US and our markets can our markets sustain these levels without the same level of goodwill and capital and everything else. And I don't know the answer yet. Nobody does. It's interesting. That's an interesting perspective because I definitely don't share part of it. The part I'd like to double click into is the idea because I do agree completely with the destabilization by the way and just the way that this whole thing has gone has caused a bit of a ruckus. But even through that, it does seem like there's a clear line that we're trying to negotiate and talk with partners. So to that end specifically though, when you look at the way that markets are likely to evolve based on this new thing that's going on, what does that look like to you? I mean, that's a that's that's kind of the million dollar question. I love the answer. I wish I knew the answer. I there's going to be many schools on many people are going to look at this thing lots of different ways. You know, I I feel like we have done internal damage. It is very difficult. If there's no integrity, markets don't work. Right. And I worry about that probably more than anything else. And I don't know if that's the way everybody else looks at it. I think, you know, integrity is not a tweet saying, hey, we've got we bought 90 days. Integrity is something that is as much deeper and requires much more consideration. And I worry about the integrity, you know, I mean, America is the single greatest pull of liquidity and capital pull in the world 100 times over. And so as we go, so goes everything else. But we're also the engine that drives everything. And we need everybody to play in our in our playground. And if everybody doesn't want to play in our playground, then we have kind of our own, you know, isolated ecosystem, which cannot thrive and grow. And I feel like that's essentially what we're telling the rest of the world is, hey, you know what, we've got this ecosystem. We don't need any of you. But if you want to come and play, here's the toll. And to me, that's, you know, incredibly short-sighted and stupid to other people. They're like, hey, it's America first, whatever, you know, I mean, I understand there's different sides. But that's where we are right now. I think your perspective holds a lot of merit. And I think there's a lot to it. Now pivoting a little bit to. There was a podcast I was listening to you a little while ago that was talking about the necessity of taking risk. You talk about risk a lot, which is always like. I'm a risk freak. I love risk. Yeah. And one of the things you mentioned that I find, and I think it's just part of who you are, even from the stories you told me when you were, you know, betting on the golf course. To me, it seems like you have a very novel relationship with risk. And you've mentioned before that you're not really worried about losing. However, a lot of people that are investing or new traders, they're trading a small account. So like a loss can be big deal to them. Yeah. Do you have any thoughts on like that person's paradigm and how they might be able to adopt a little bit more of your paradigm, which is. What's your paradigm, which largely I think is the better one to onboard. You know, it's hard. I. I wrote a road about it this weekend. I ran into an old trader and floor trader that I used to know we were buddies when we both traded, you know, on the seabow years ago. And he said, you know, part I miss about trading is that I felt like no matter what was happening anywhere in the world crashing whatever we were doing. I controlled my own like I felt in control. So like I never I never worried about it. And I feel still feel like that today. But he said as a as a retail investor now, I'm kind of like passive. You know, I have to do something else. And I don't follow my investments as much. And I feel like I'm nervous as a passive investor because I don't control everything anymore. And it's much more difficult for me. And I go, yeah, that's that's definitely, you know, the kind of the feedback I get from lots of people and from and that's the impression I get from the whole kind of retail space. It is much more challenging and a lot scarier when, you know, when you don't control. You know, what's happening next? Or we don't when you don't control what you can do. And so I get it, you know, that's that's scary part. And that's why I think the integrity of the markets is so important. So talk to me about some of the ways that you think retail trader though could get more comfortable with taking risk and accepting of losses. I mean, one thing you can do is. You can control your own investments as opposed to letting somebody else do it because when somebody else does it, you have no control over the correlation risk in your portfolio. So all you all you know is that that person may put you into 10 different stocks, but they all might be highly correlated to an extent of that it doesn't matter, you know, if the market is going to do whatever the market does, it goes down, you're going to lose on all of them. If the market goes up, you're going to make on all of them, but but point being is that, you know, there is there's nothing you can do to control their risk. The alternative is that if you do it yourself, you can put yourself in a handful of different investments. And you can keep your size so you can control whatever it is you you control the decision making when you open the trade. So you control what you put your money into and after that market forces take over as opposed to the only thing you control is just who you give your money to, which I think I don't like that. So it sounds like there's a baked in element here though, because my assumption would be for people a lot of times when they're seeking external control, it's that they're seeking external expertise because they're not comfortable with their own awareness or knowledge around the thing. So it sounds like it's exactly it. There's there's a certain amount of, you know, they're nervous. There's there's there's they're nervous about their level of know how and that's, you know, I mean, I, I understand that and I, you know, that's one of the things that we do, you know, what tasty is we try to, you know, bridge that a little bit and create, you know, create a path or create ideas or create engagement to get you over that fear thing, but yeah, I totally get it. There's two other things that actually you and I have talked about a similar topic before that I'll throw out on your behalf and you can tell me if these were way off one of them is you guys talk a lot about sizing things controlling risk on the onset, which I think helps a lot with that. And the other thing I've heard you talk about is just the overall utility gained from taking risk and how sometimes that can overwhelm a temporary financial setback of some sort in the context of what you learned through taking risk and making decisions. I mean, that seems so so obvious doesn't it? I mean, it seems so it seems so simplistic and and so obvious and yet I don't think that it's it's commonplace, you know, I mean, when we think about all the decisions that we have in life that go into ultimately determining, you know, who we are. What kind of wealth we create, what kind of opportunities we create for ourselves. It all involves around risk taking it if you've never done it before you'd likelihood that you're going to, you know, you're going to nail it the first time is really hard. And so yeah, risk taking, you know, risk taking is huge. And, you know, and you can see it when you just when you when you look around, you can see how risk takers, you know, succeed. You put yourself in enough positions that sooner or later a couple of them connect. Yeah, I mean, when you look around and you look at people that, you know, that they, when you look at people that that that you think are that you look up to that you look at role models. I don't care if it's I don't care if it's the president. I don't care if it's the president. I don't care if it's the CEO of some, you know, huge company. I don't care who it is. I don't care if it's a sport star, whatever. But, but when you look at different role models, I guarantee you every single person that you're looking at as a role models or risk taker. It's not possible. They got there like nobody looks at a role model as somebody that was that was handed it from generational wealth. Like I don't think people here are the best example I can give is like the royal family. Okay. And nobody looks at a younger member of the royal family like whoever it might be, you know, whatever friends or whatever they are. Whatever. I don't even know. I don't even know either. But, but nobody looks at members of the royal family goes, wow, that's what I aspire to be. Because you're not going to get that job. Okay. That's that job is not for sale. That job. You can be the greatest trader in the world, risk taker, whatever business person. You're never going to be the prince of Wales. Okay. That's not going to happen. So, so that kind of, you know, wealth that gets passed down, you know, that doesn't matter to anybody. That doesn't mean a damn thing to anybody. But then you'll look at somebody, you know, and it could be, you know, any, it doesn't matter who it is. It could be like a base those or something. It could be, you know, it could be anybody that you that, and I'm not saying Jeff basis, but it could be any CEO that got there that made it on their own that worked their way up through the ranks that started off as, you know, a dishwasher and ended up as the CEO McDonald's who knows. Those are the people that you respect and you understand that the risk they took very few of those people that get that level never or where they built some amazing company got there without taking ridiculous amounts of risk along the way. You know, very few people just skated in the back on through the back door. And it just doesn't happen that way. So, I think that, you know, in my life, the most interesting people and the most incredible, you know, minds they've ever got to sit down with and have dinner and I don't care what they think about politically. I don't care what they, you know, and don't care about anything. Just like just sitting there, bullshitting with people. The most incredible entrepreneurs are always self made crazy risk takers. Always everyone best decision makers, crazy risk takers put it all out there. Now, how do you, how do you think about the the survivorship bias that goes into that right because for every one of those people you're sitting down with, there's a hundred that tried the same thing. That night might not have grown up in the right place like Bill Gates and had access to the computer and they failed miserably because they didn't have the same thing. So like, how do you, how do you think about that element of it because that's totally cool. That's, that's, that's exactly what the way it should be. There's, there's got to be, you know, it's just a normal distribution curve. Okay, and when you look at the outliers who have had crazy success, you know, the ones that have started from nothing and built something through risk or whatever, you know, you're talking about, you know, a fraction of, a fraction of a tenth of a percent. So it's just you're really looking, you know, you're just looking deeper into a very detailed distribution curve, you know, but I can guarantee you that the people that try and fail are much more likely to be successful than the bottom 50% of the people in that distribution curve. So if you start off with 100 people and you have maybe one tenth of one person that gets to a crazy level. Okay, there are going to be 16 people in there that do really well and there's going to be, there's going to be 34 more people that are above average. So 50% are going to be of the risk takers are going to outperform that that's great odds. You know, world where everybody thinks everything's against them and all this crap and blah, blah, blah and everything. The reality is if you could put most people in a situation where you said, listen, you got a one and two chance, they would take it, but they don't understand that. So I don't buy into the hey, you know, 95% of the people don't make it. No, not 95%. 95% of the people don't become, you know, multi millionaires or billionaires or that. But 50% of the people are way better off than everybody else. And because they've learned how to take risk and take shots and do whatever. The other thing I honestly would expect you to say and I don't know if this is accurate, but I also would imagine that you would think that the people in the bottom 50 that took the shot and failed still would probably be better off after the shot and failing. Of course, yeah, there's going to be there's going to be a certain percentage, maybe it's 15% or whatever that take the shot that learned the risk that never recover. That that we would be it would be foolish for us to sit here and say that that doesn't happen because it absolutely does. And you know, that's the unfortunate part, but you know, this is, this is a, we were a capitalistic society. Okay, this is a free market. You know, this is not, we're not living in North Korea or something like that. We're living in a place where, you know, we're guaranteeing everybody everything we're living in a place where where it is a, it is a relatively fair free market. And that's always been the greatest thing about America. And that's why everybody wants to come here. That's why that's why we are, you know, that's why we have the most money and and the most efficient markets. And based on that conversation, a lot of new traders, they start with their $5,000 count and their aspirations are to turn this into their future wealth. Yeah, that's ridiculous. And if you were to give that group of people some guidance in terms of what instead to focus on in order to leverage the experience of taking the risk, but to turn it into something more practical longer term, what kind of guidance would you give that person? Well, because the $5,000 is, I mean, there have been people that have turned $5,000 into our ridiculous amount of money. But the statistical chance of doing that is, is minuscule. I did an interview with somebody once he turned. He was, he was an engineer and he turned a $3,000 account into about, I think about seven and a half million, literally a $3,000 account. And over over a very short period of time, like maybe two or three years. And I'm like, he's like this, and he showed me everything and I looked it up, like looked at everything we had all is wrecked, it was amazing. And I'm like, you know, I go, I've never seen anybody do this before, a $3,000 account. It goes really? And I go, yeah, he's like, it's like, oh, okay, that's kind of cool. You know, then I'm like, yeah, it's amazing. But the reality is that most people with a $5,000 account, you know, they end up in a couple of years with either a $3,000 account or an $8,000 account, you know, whatever, whatever, normal. Right. So, but the people that don't end up with a $3,000 account or an $8,000 account are infinitely better positioned to articulate. Everything from financial strategies to how markets work, to how the economy works, to just be able to talk about things that most other people can't talk about to differentiate themselves to make that experience so valuable that they're in an infinitely better spot than the person that never opened that $5,000 account. Period. And so that's where I am on that. Yeah, I think it makes sense that you're coming about that interview also reminds me I saw like a live stream with Keith Gil, the dude from GameStop roaring kitty that he was almost a billion hair. It's just so crazy to see those numbers thrown around. So it's it's fun to see that was a different. That's a different situation. But yeah, definitely the broader point being that it some people do find that path, which is always cool to see. So it's cool to hear about that other interview that you were talking about now. Taking that advice of being better off what then is the next step for those traders to then take the experience side of it, but then actually turn trading into something that is like true value add and like a wealth generation vehicle for them. You know, it's so funny that you're asking that question because because honestly, this is this has been top of mind for me for the last decade. Like I don't really talk about this at all. Because I don't I don't want to talk about this particular question because I don't want to get off track most of the time. And it's different. It's podcasts. So it's a little different. I don't talk about this the network. But this is a question that I've been battling in turn by cell and trying to try and decide how to address it for a long time. I'm in the process now of building software to literally to address that question because because I think that that's the holy grail. I'm surprised you asked it because honestly, I don't know if I've ever been asked the question. I thought this was just something that that sat in the back of my head and it's just been it's been eating away at me for the last decade. But I'm spending a lot of time and money trying to answer that question. Like how do we how do we create. How do we create wealth without necessarily creating well, you know, like, like, how do we create wealth through know how and how do we create wealth through experience and how do we create wealth through differentiation and and you know, and how does how does somebody monetize that know how. And I've gotten to the point where I feel pretty confident that for the first time in the last like 18 months were making progress on on building technology to help answer those questions because if I was 22 years old or I was 18 or I was 25 or 30. Like that's what I want to know. Like I'm not foolish enough to think that I'm not foolish enough to think that I'm going to walk into Caesar's palace with $2,000 and change my life. Okay. And I'm not foolish enough to think that I'm going to open an account at tasty and with $2,500 and change my life financially. But there has to be something there. There has to be. And what's there, what's real world, what's street smarts, I can get out of that, you know, it, it, it, there has to be a way to for me to understand that and how to utilize that. And I think, you know, that's what we're working on. You can't go into detail. So I won't probe on it. But do you have any high level thoughts you can share around the thing that you're working on in terms of potential use case or like when people might expect it. Later this year and the use case, the use case is really, the use case is interesting. The use case is is, I think for way too long. We kind of take what we do for granted, like whatever it is that we do, whether you're in technology or you're in finance or you're a professional something or you're, you know, or you're in manufacturing, you know, you're labor or whatever it is. There's a lot of things that we do in life that we, I think we don't realize what the, the know how that comes with those, with those roles. I think we don't utilize it because we, because we have very narrow, we have a very narrow vision. And in order to, in order to expand on that vision, we need help. And so I think there are technological solutions and I think there are quantitative solutions. And I've been spending like, it's basically been the last year and a half of my life, you know, focusing on that kind of, you know, because, because I'm like you, you know, I want somebody with a $5,000 account to understand the value. Of selling a vertical spread. You know, I want you to understand, you know, how the world works by selling and out of the money put. I don't give a crap if you make, you know, $30. You know, that doesn't mean anything to me. I want you to understand what just happened. And, and how do you, how do you turn that into $3 million, 20 years from now? And this tool will help with that. Yes, I think so. I believe so. That's so exciting. Yeah, no, I will follow up with you when we're ready to roll out stuff. You will hear about it. It's really fascinating. But, um, I'm, I'm just, you know, like, you know, I mean, we have tunnel vision. We all have tunnel vision. And it's just, it's cool to think that there's, you know, what you can do today with technology is pretty wild. That's so cool. One of the things I find, especially when I talk to a lot of traders is the over emphasis of like the outcome of individual trades versus like the process behind it. So it sounds like this can help frame some of that, which is really cool. I think. Yeah, we get hung up on on P and L. You know, we get, which is, which is right like getting hung up on, you know, wins and losses and all that kind of stuff, which is totally understandable. But you can understand now why I care so much about the integrity of what we do, you know, because, because I don't want to jeopardize that. You know, I don't want any person or any administration or any government or anybody to, to jeopardize kind of this free market machine that lets us be creative and innovative and let's us do things that you can't do anywhere else. And that's what we're protecting. Right. Yeah. It makes tons of sense. A couple last questions before we get you out of here. Sure. Looking forward for the rest of the year, I actually thought it was really fascinating that you said that you were expecting lows and like the first half. That's like quite pressing and receptive of you. So what led you to think that? And then what are you thinking then broadly for the rest of the year? I, I mean, look, what do I know? Last year, I thought we were going to close it. 4800 and we closed it 6100. So I was only off by 1300 points. And yes, like running error. Yeah, yeah, just 25 to 30% and you know, rounding it exactly. So what do I know? I know nothing. I've been doing this my whole life. I know nothing. But before the year started, I thought we would close the year at about 5700. We're at 5859, 5900 tonight. But and I only felt like that because I thought that after, you know, a crazy run up to the last. At whatever you want to say 15 years, you know, maybe we needed a little bit of a pullback. I, I expect I think the damage has been done this year, meaning the ball spike in April. I think was a very important, you know, high in volatility and a high in risk and probably a low in the market. So I don't think the 4800 by 1000 levels going to be going to be retested this year. And I also think that there's enough skepticism out there and and valid reasons for that skepticism. And I also think with the bonds at 113 right now, there is, you know, I don't, I don't see us going to new highs anytime soon. So I think we're in a trading range. I think the worst we've seen the worst of volatility. And I, I would expect that, you know, suggesting that we could be range bound between 6000 and 50400 is probably pretty reasonable. And what do you think of ball hanging around the 18 handle because I mean, obviously it's a far cry from being in the 5060s. But that's still elevated slightly compared to longer term averages. What do you think about? It's about it's about 10% elevated right now. I mean, I, I think that all traders prefer 20 to 22 in a perfect world, 20 to 25, but 2022 is cool. 18 is the low end of the preferred range, but it's way better than 16. You know, in, in Trump's first term, 2017, which was the first, which would be like an equivalent year till 2025. We didn't even have a 1% move all year. It was the worst year ever for volatility. So I was worried this year, you know, that there might be a low in volatility, but clearly that has not been the case. I think now that there's a better chance for the second half of the year to have some a little bit, you know, lower expectations and volatility. Got it. Well, you heard it here first if Tom is wrong. You just shoot him some hate mail or something like that. But. Oh, just don't worry. I don't, I don't read the hate mail because I get plenty of it. So, you know, like somebody said to me once they go, because I, because I'm talking every day and I never shut up and, and I, I drive, I piss a lot of people off and I, you know, I make a lot of people really happy. I'm not going to be able to get people off. I haven't. But I don't read like I will not go on Twitter. I don't read any Instagram. I mean, I watch TikTok, but not my own stuff. Like I won't look at any social media feedback. I mean, I read my own emails. And, and I love the. Some guy told me today to essentially curl up and die. And you know, like there was, there was, I get those occasionally. Yeah, yeah, that was fun. But I also get a lot of, you know, really, you know, it's about probably 20 to one positive. So I'm okay with that email wise. So this easy. That's life. You know what you got to, you know, it's, it's totally, I love the fact that we create engagement. And I think that's cool. Well, hopefully we'll not do the curl up and die one, but. By the way, was the name of a hairdressing salon in Chicago. And I thought it was a great name. A great name curl up and die. That's great. Well, spelled die. D.Y. That's better. Yeah. Okay. That adds a lot of clarity. I was going to say that's. It was right down the street from my first apartment in Chicago. So I never forget that place. It's not business anymore. But it was curl up and die. I'm like, well, that's a great name. Did you ever get your hair down there? No, I didn't. I thought you might have. Now, sorry. All right. Well, maybe next time. Super fun conversation. Thanks for the time is always Tom. I'll follow up with you and looking forward to catch up again. Until next time. Thank you.
