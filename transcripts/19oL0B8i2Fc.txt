0.00s: What's up, outliers?
1.50s: Welcome back to Outlier Options Trading Tips,
3.94s: where you learn some new things in three minutes or less.
6.84s: Today, we're going to talk about three tips
9.50s: to survive as a new options trader.
11.10s: The first one is to target returns
13.50s: that are commensurate with your skill.
15.14s: So here's a conversation I had on Reddit,
17.42s: and this person was talking about their coworker,
20.34s: who apparently is able to make $500 a day trading
24.38s: spy zero-dte options using only $5,000.
28.42s: So that represents a 10% return daily.
31.94s: If this person traded even $63 total trading days,
36.94s: they would have a 40,000% plus return.
40.94s: It is complete bullshit.
45.06s: Trading is the only skill I can think of,
48.78s: where people regularly believe that you can get
54.26s: out sized returns with no skill.
58.42s: Think of anything else that requires a lot of skill.
60.70s: How long it takes you to get really good at it.
62.58s: It's not like months.
64.14s: It's literally years and years.
66.82s: Trading is no different.
68.02s: It's no different than being really successful
70.10s: at anything else.
71.18s: So my approach would be my first two years of trading
75.58s: greater than zero is great.
79.30s: That's a great target to start.
81.78s: And the reason why greater than zero is a great target
84.14s: is not trying to rapidly grow your $5,000 account
86.90s: is because it saves you from making stupid mistakes.
90.50s: Trying to grow your small account into a large account
93.18s: tracing a gene that really doesn't exist.
96.26s: Okay, the next thing here is focusing more
100.30s: on the loss side of the equation.
103.14s: You'll come across posts like this literally all the time.
106.02s: Where traders put on trades,
107.82s: they're too worried about how much money they're going to make,
110.98s: what they're going to do with all the money they're going to make,
113.02s: and they don't even consider what they're going to do
115.42s: if the trade goes against them.
116.98s: And then when the trade goes against them,
119.10s: they come on well, place like Reddit asking for help.
122.58s: It just doesn't make sense.
125.26s: So you have to spend even more time looking at the risk
129.38s: side of your trade than literally the profit side.
132.38s: And the last thing is focus on building a robust process
138.70s: rather than trying to scale your small account
140.90s: into your future wealth.
142.02s: Because the probability of you scaling your small account
145.22s: into your future wealth super fast is about zero.
148.02s: However, your probability of becoming a millionaire
150.82s: if you focus on maintaining a really good savings rate,
153.78s: investing your money and growing your income source,
156.74s: then all of a sudden it becomes much more realistic.
159.82s: Any questions?
160.66s: Let me know.
161.50s: Be an outlier.
162.34s: See you later.
