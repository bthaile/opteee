0.00s:  What's up outliers?
1.52s:  Welcome back to outlier options trading tips where you learn some new things in three
5.70s:  minutes or less.
6.70s:  Today, we're going to talk about three tips to survive as a new options trader.
11.14s:  The first one is to target returns that are commensurate with your skill.
15.24s:  So here's a conversation I had on Reddit.
17.76s:  And this person was talking about their coworker who apparently is able to make $500 a day
23.58s:  trading spy zero DTE options using only $5,000.
28.56s:  So that represents a 10% return daily.
32.12s:  If this person traded even 63 total trading days, they would have a 40,000% plus return.
41.08s:  It is complete bullshit.
45.48s:  Trading is the only skill I can think of where people regularly believe that you can get
54.22s:  outsized returns with no skill.
58.54s:  Think of anything else that requires a lot of skill.
60.78s:  How long it takes you to get really good at it?
62.58s:  It's not like months.
64.26s:  It's literally years and years.
67.14s:  Trading is no different.
68.18s:  It's no different than being really successful at anything else.
71.26s:  So my approach would be my first two years of trading greater than zero is great.
78.90s:  That's a great target to start.
81.86s:  And the reason why greater than zero is a great target, not trying to rapidly grow your $5,000
86.54s:  account is because it saves you from making stupid mistakes, trying to grow your small
91.80s:  account into a large account, tracing a gene that really doesn't exist.
96.02s:  Okay, the next thing here is focusing more on the loss side of the equation.
103.10s:  You'll come across posts like this literally all the time where traders put on trades.
107.90s:  They're too worried about how much money they're going to make.
111.02s:  What they're going to do with all the money they're going to make.
113.06s:  And they don't even consider what they're going to do if the trade goes against the
116.50s:  against them.
117.50s:  And then when the trade goes against them, they come on well, place like Reddit asking
121.10s:  for help.
122.62s:  It just doesn't make sense.
125.38s:  So you have to spend even more time looking at the risk side of your trade than literally
130.98s:  the profit side.
132.46s:  And the last thing is focus on building a robust process rather than trying to scale your
140.14s:  small account into your future wealth.
142.26s:  Because the probability of you scaling your small account into your future wealth super
146.38s:  fast is about zero.
147.98s:  However, your probability of becoming a millionaire, if you focus on maintaining a really good savings
152.94s:  rate, investing your money and growing your income source, then all of a sudden it becomes
158.26s:  much more realistic.
159.90s:  Any questions?
160.90s:  Let me know.
161.90s:  Be an outlier.
162.90s:  See you later.
