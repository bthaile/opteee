0.68s: what up outliers quick market update we
3.36s: have two things on the agenda for today
5.44s: the first one is going to be Wells Fargo
7.76s: the second one is going to be Adobe and
10.64s: then I guess there's a third bonus item
12.44s: which I want to take a look at GameStop
14.40s: because on the dark pool side of things
16.52s: there are just a lot of transactions
19.16s: that I find slightly curious and topical
21.56s: that I want to share with you so let's
23.32s: start with Will's Fargo what's going on
24.64s: in here the stock dropped 4% today for
28.08s: probably the most classic Wells Fargo
30.44s: reason on Earth which is it continues to
34.72s: you know break the law feel it's kind of
38.16s: like part and parcel for Wells Fargo
39.96s: it's one of the best reasons to be in
42.48s: Wells Fargo is because you know that
44.88s: they don't care about the rules that
46.64s: they're just going to kind of do
47.52s: whatever they want they might open
49.04s: accounts to show account openings that
51.48s: don't exist they might in this case not
54.36s: really care about the internal
55.44s: mechanisms that they need to you know
58.12s: fight Financial crimes I just they're
60.04s: just doing whatever they want out here
62.08s: and you got to respect a bank that
63.64s: somehow stays in business behind you
66.32s: know a Litany of different
68.68s: investigations and pretty much
70.96s: continuing to get in trouble for
72.72s: breaking the law it's just I find it
74.64s: hilarious so shout out to Wells Fargo
77.12s: for continuing to do whatever it is that
79.36s: they do but right now they are in a
81.48s: steep decline which funny enough it's
83.68s: not super fortunate cuz I do have a long
85.76s: position right now in Bank of America
87.44s: that's not exactly playing ball as as I
90.16s: wanted but the financial sector as a
92.20s: whole is starting to turn over a little
94.72s: bit here so if we jump over to XLF we
98.72s: can see that it's grabbing a bite which
100.48s: is good but you know I for a while
104.84s: financials were really holding things up
106.56s: but now it looks like it's rotating over
108.04s: a little bit so yeah got to love us some
111.84s: Wells Fargo news we'll see where this
113.96s: one goes as always absolute blast the
117.68s: next thing I want to take a look at is
118.80s: Adobe and this is because it feeds into
122.88s: the broader Tech picture so they had
125.64s: earnings today after the close and they
129.32s: had a massive massive beat so if you
132.92s: take a look they came in 363 was
135.88s: estimate 465 actual and then let's take
138.60s: a look at the old Adobe price and it's
142.00s: closed at 586 and is trading at 532
145.04s: another example of where good is just
148.84s: not good enough
150.52s: so if we take a look at some of the news
153.64s: here specifically in Adobe there's a
156.64s: couple things that stuck out to me first
158.84s: one is it crushed on Revenue so that
163.00s: seems great news but this is one of the
165.96s: issues I think it didn't really like uh
168.92s: it being the market is the forecast and
171.92s: again I try to remind people when we're
173.28s: coming into earnings
175.48s: forecasts are so important and it's
178.24s: because we have a sense of the
180.08s: performance of a company coming into
181.64s: earnings we can kind of see how they're
184.60s: broadly doing but the forecast is new
188.56s: information to us and it's the first
191.12s: time that we get a glimpse at how a
193.32s: company is expecting to perform for the
195.20s: remainder of the year for the next
196.56s: quarter and that gets priced in pretty
198.84s: heavily and you can see how tight these
201.28s: margins are right because you can see
203.48s: that the company says it's forecasting
206.20s: 5.5 Bill to
207.84s: 5.55 for um Q4 and it's just shy of
213.92s: 5.6 and they they just don't like that
217.08s: so these kind of softer forward guidance
219.68s: I think is really important for us as
221.64s: both investors and Traders because we've
223.92s: seen this in a few companies now and in
226.28s: technology companies specifically we're
228.48s: getting to a really interesting part of
230.12s: the market where as we're coming up on
232.56s: rate cuts which will be very soon at
234.72s: least for the first round those are
236.60s: generally priced in at this point the
238.60s: market is trying now to figure out how
240.84s: do we proceed through this rate cut
242.52s: picture and I think one of the bigger
243.76s: risks we have if we start cutting rates
245.96s: too fast which it doesn't look like
247.92s: that's going to be the case upfront
249.48s: we're still looking at a pretty
250.64s: conservative starting cycle at least but
254.04s: right now to me it looks like the market
255.64s: is grasping to see how this thing plays
258.40s: out like we all are very curious about
260.72s: and the reason why I say grasping is
262.24s: because we have no period in history
265.84s: that's like a really close reference for
268.68s: what we've seen starting from the covid
271.04s: drop then the overall fiscal policy
275.20s: deployed by the FED during that period
276.72s: to combat that drop like we we've not
279.00s: seen what has happened before to this
281.48s: degree so this is very much a first ofit
283.68s: kind kind of scenario so from a trading
286.20s: perspective I continue to do what I
287.72s: always do which is remain sensitive to
290.08s: current information trading the market
291.68s: as it is not how I think the market
293.68s: should be that leads us into the fan
297.60s: fave GameStop so a couple things jump
300.92s: out to me here with the new offering we
304.80s: can see that volume definitely has
306.60s: spiked over the last couple days and
309.80s: part of this is also because of earnings
311.60s: but a really big contraction in volume
314.12s: here so I think right now A lot of
316.60s: people are curious how far does this go
319.32s: when are we going to be done with the
321.36s: shares because that obviously will
322.92s: suppress Price ever so slightly but
325.64s: again what I find most intriguing here
328.72s: is following its earning release we beat
331.04s: on earnings we came down we also have
333.36s: news of the offering and it's still
336.20s: holding tight here this is not a new
338.40s: line that I've drawn at the 1981 handle
340.72s: this has been here for some time and I
343.04s: do think that this is kind of meaningful
344.60s: support at this point we've been hitting
346.24s: it a few times recently so we have to
350.56s: see how the overall behavior of GameStop
353.44s: flows here but again I find myself
356.28s: looking at it the same way I typically
357.80s: look at it looks like we're coming into
359.08s: a more Qui quiet period and it's quiet
361.52s: until it's not so the other thing I
364.04s: wanted to take a look at with you is the
365.44s: options because we haven't done this in
366.72s: a in a little while so if we take a look
369.84s: at the overall volume for today it's
374.04s: 119,000 against 54,000 calls to puts so
377.36s: very very quiet on a relative basis but
380.52s: this strikes me different there's
383.32s: 700,000 calls against 350,000 puts
387.16s: that's a lot of calls and it's still
390.48s: at barely at a 2:1 ratio which is good
393.68s: but the other thing that I is very
395.52s: striking to me about the way that the
397.56s: options chain looks right now is that of
400.24s: those 700,000 the majority clearly is
402.96s: not in this front expiration this front
404.80s: expiration is 146,000 of those so it's a
407.28s: lot but not all of them and this
410.48s: represents a shift what the shift
413.24s: ultimately means I don't know yet I have
415.60s: to keep an eye on it but from an options
417.68s: trading perspective I noticed changes
420.20s: like this and typically speaking when
422.88s: we're looking at the front expiration we
425.32s: tend to see really really heavy option
427.84s: concentrated option value as a
429.60s: percentage of the total oi that's not
431.88s: what I'm seeing right now the other
433.72s: thing I'll notice uh I'll point out is
435.92s: that there is decent exposure already in
439.20s: this 20 step expiration 135,000 that
442.16s: makes sense to me 20ep is the next
444.80s: primary expiration options are typically
446.80s: more liquid there very very normal so
449.60s: the main anomaly I see here is just the
452.28s: variance across all these different
453.96s: expiration cycles for the call side I
455.96s: find that interesting not a direct
457.88s: takeaway just yet but interesting when I
461.00s: look at the overall
463.84s: volatility we're still very front heavy
467.08s: right so we have 121% for this week
469.80s: drops down to 98 96 95 95 99 so
474.36s: obviously 18 o becomes slightly
478.04s: interesting because that fourpoint Vol
481.20s: increase here it could just be because
483.84s: this is the next
485.24s: primary expiration cycle or it could be
488.24s: that the market is starting to
489.32s: anticipate something coming out here so
491.08s: that's an expiration cycle I'm keeping a
492.80s: close eye on because that is anomalous
495.52s: to go from 95 99 uh 95 99 95 essentially
499.96s: that's strange then it plummets right
502.48s: after that to 69 giggity back up to 90
505.04s: so this is also really interesting to me
507.44s: how soft the volatility is here so far
510.20s: in one no so this continues to lead to a
514.00s: massive massive host of crazy
517.40s: opportunities to trade relative
519.12s: volatility and something like GameStop
521.20s: it's something that I've ran for some
522.64s: time now we can see for the first time
525.24s: in sometime that for the 20-step
527.68s: expiration we have massive massive call
531.72s: implied volatility skew again normally
534.32s: you'll see the put side priced more
536.00s: heavily than the call side but that's
537.52s: not what's happening right now we're
539.16s: actually seeing everything out typically
541.32s: the 50s would be the highest still but
543.16s: like this Kink is tradable to there to
546.20s: there relative to here there's a lot of
548.36s: different ways that that can be traded
549.88s: but the main note is that volatility as
552.28s: an outright asset class is very tradable
555.40s: in GameStop even though the price so far
558.12s: has been a little bit slower going all
561.36s: right so the last thing I want to show
562.64s: you is what I alluded to at the
563.76s: beginning of the video and it's this we
567.72s: have almost
569.76s: 100 transactions today across the entire
573.40s: day separated by very very little time
576.12s: frames if any of 5,000 share buy blocks
581.72s: tons of them and if we go back in time I
584.96s: wanted to actually open this up a little
586.68s: bit and like let's look over the last
588.56s: month together and let's see what this
591.40s: looks like so if we start uh oh sorry I
594.96s: want to do for the last 30 days not last
596.44s: month out right here we go so if we
598.68s: start from the of September you'll
600.72s: notice again that there's almost a
601.92s: hundred of these that that's a ton and
604.92s: it's like throughout the entire day so
607.16s: again it's hard to tell who or what this
609.64s: is or what series of entities this is
612.40s: there's never anybody that outright owns
615.76s: 5,000 share contracts or not contracts
619.40s: uh purchases because this is shares not
621.40s: options obviously used to talking about
623.68s: options but what I find most interesting
626.84s: is this if we look there's about 90 High
630.72s: 90s here then if we go to the 11th we
633.84s: see that that's about cut in
636.28s: halfish so the 11th there's still a ton
638.88s: of them if we go to the 10th there's
641.16s: maybe a third of that there's much less
643.88s: then if we go to the ninth even less
645.72s: still we go to the sixth it opens back
648.12s: up the fifth like none fourth like none
651.48s: well not like none but very far less so
654.20s: what I'm highlighting is that this is
655.52s: undulating these purchases are
657.08s: undulating and I can't quite put my
659.56s: finger on why there's no real answer to
663.00s: this it's very difficult to tell as to
665.72s: why we're moving in 5,000 share blocks
669.44s: because here's the other thing I find
670.60s: interesting is that if we sort this by
673.40s: size we can move way more right if
676.68s: somebody wanted to take all of those
678.68s: 5,000 share blocks and essentially throw
680.60s: them at once or twice or three times
682.36s: meaning across a few orders they can if
684.52s: they're so inclined because if you look
687.08s: at this the size that we're Trading for
689.40s: the larger uh positions here 150,000
692.28s: 145,000 100,000 even 93 87 so on and so
695.40s: forth so there's really big transactions
696.92s: flowing through here no problem so the
699.00s: fact that there's so many of those at
700.60s: the five I find just interesting because
703.04s: I also don't see that same kind of
705.72s: repeat buying behavior in any other
708.68s: relative size so far so yeah hard to say
713.68s: is per usual but something I just can't
715.96s: help but find interesting and that's one
717.76s: of the things I try to do do for all of
720.40s: us here on the channel is find things
722.60s: that look interesting to me that does
724.04s: look interesting I don't have a direct
725.36s: conclusion yet perhaps we can dive a
727.40s: little bit further into it on the gme
729.16s: live stream on Saturday at 5:00 p.m.
731.24s: Pacific time looking forward to that
732.64s: actually we have a couple things to get
733.84s: into which is the rest of roaring Kitty
736.60s: old trades we have maybe about a quarter
739.12s: to a third left of them to go last
741.40s: weekend we got super far in detail on
743.32s: them which I'm actually pretty excited
744.56s: to get back into those that was very fun
747.04s: so yeah interesting stock Behavior
750.12s: generally quiet options behavior and it
753.56s: is a continue to monitor for me right
756.56s: now I am trading it very conservatively
759.72s: I I've already told those I think it was
761.60s: during a live session I already paired
763.28s: down my stock position a little bit and
765.96s: it was just because of essentially we
767.68s: were getting to a decent spot I was
769.20s: making okay money based on what I had
771.48s: and then this is kind of like an
772.64s: accumulation Zone depending on how it
774.20s: behaves but for me I will always
776.20s: continue to remind everybody like I'm a
777.84s: Trader I participate in holding GameStop
780.72s: stock to participate cuz I like the
782.84s: community and I want to support it but
784.84s: this is not where I know a lot of people
786.56s: are parking like all of their money it's
788.28s: not even close for me and it's simply
791.52s: because I I trade the markets
792.80s: differently and I have to my livelihood
795.60s: so yeah interesting thing to follow
797.24s: along though I am really eager to see
799.48s: how it handles kind of this High 19 low
802.88s: 20 handle and see what it does in here
805.00s: especially when the offering abates and
808.20s: then I want to see if we start start
809.28s: springing from there TB D also still
812.76s: waiting to hear if we get any guidance
815.08s: soon on what the master plan is behind
818.44s: the capital that's raised still very
820.20s: very eager to hear that as well so as
822.60s: always anything I should look at let me
823.96s: know be an outlier see y later
