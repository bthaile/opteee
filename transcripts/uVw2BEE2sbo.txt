0.00s: Newsflash, if you trade or invest, you're going to lose.
5.00s: We all lose.
6.40s: The point, though, is that you don't want to lose in the aggregate.
10.72s: You want to lose in individual circumstances
14.24s: so that you can get smarter about your strategy
17.68s: and thus make more money.
19.52s: If you get into this investing and trading world
22.64s: with the idea of never losing any money,
25.04s: you're not going to make any money.
26.72s: So in the video today, I want to walk us through an example
30.72s: on what this can look like pretty frequently
33.52s: and then most importantly, at the end of the video,
36.28s: I'm going to walk you through exactly how to maximize
39.84s: your losing trades because there is an opportunity
43.08s: in every single one of them if you know where to look.
47.16s: What's up, everybody?
47.84s: Eric here.
48.36s: Welcome back to all the outliers.
49.72s: And if what I do helps you in any way,
51.72s: consider signing up for the Patreon.
53.48s: I really appreciate your guys' support.
55.48s: Okay, let's get to it.
56.56s: How to maximize losing trades.
58.84s: So here we have a post from options.
62.64s: I purposefully went to the options subreddit
66.08s: versus Wall Street bets or something like that
68.44s: because people on Wall Street bets,
69.96s: they're just slinging money.
71.76s: What I call them?
73.04s: Fun coupon.
74.44s: Yeah?
75.28s: Hoping that something works.
76.76s: And what I mean by that is you're not really getting a great sense
79.84s: of people who are attempting to manage
81.88s: reaSkin make money.
83.28s: You're just seeing people who are trying to hit the lottery.
85.44s: Oh my God.
88.12s: Jackpot, baby.
89.40s: So I'm calling that from the group in its entirety.
92.80s: And we're focusing on people who think
95.08s: they're trying to make money in a sophisticated manner.
97.96s: Yep, options trading.
99.44s: So with that, I want to highlight a few things
102.20s: from this excerpt and what you can learn from this person
106.44s: so that you don't have to make the same exact mistakes
110.52s: if in life, but trading specifically,
113.56s: you are one of those people that has to touch the stove
117.04s: in order to realize it's hot.
118.48s: If you say, oh, I only learn from my personal experience,
121.72s: you're not going to make any fucking money in this business.
124.16s: There is too steep of a learning curve to be that ignorant,
127.60s: to not be able to learn from other people's mistakes
130.72s: and successes.
132.16s: So get rid of that right out of the gate.
134.08s: Let's learn from a mistake.
135.88s: So this week might be the end for now to my trading career.
139.24s: I have key triple Q calls that expire this week.
142.60s: We dove hard at the moment.
144.40s: I'm still holding on to them to salvage what I can.
146.96s: But I have essentially hit about $400 left in my account.
150.72s: So let's see what this person has done to put into context.
154.44s: I've been trading for almost a year.
156.20s: That's the first thing that keys out to me almost a year
158.84s: that's a very short duration starting in September of 2019.
162.88s: I had plenty of success going up and even success on the way
166.04s: down after the COVID crash in March.
168.48s: I started out with about 7,000 in September.
171.44s: The account peaked a little over $90,000 by April of 2020.
177.12s: For those that have the bullshit detectors going off
180.08s: that's smart.
180.88s: That's not to say that this didn't happen.
182.52s: But that is a insane return.
185.36s: How insane of a return?
187.04s: Well, let's take a look from September 2019 to April 2020.
190.56s: That represents a 1,100 in 85.71% return
196.04s: or an 8,000% annualized return.
199.32s: That's what this person did.
200.40s: Now, they probably were saving adding money to the account.
203.52s: But right out of the gate,
205.12s: we have this crazy expectation that's now been set
209.72s: after a very short time frame.
212.64s: This is a blink of an eye in the time frame of trading.
218.00s: Okay.
218.84s: So now let's take a look at what happened subsequently.
222.28s: We see fast forward to July.
224.88s: And I'm down to $400.
226.72s: That represents a negative 99.56% return on their money.
231.04s: So recap.
232.20s: They went from 7,000 to 90,000 down to 400.
235.96s: There is so much you can learn from this.
238.96s: It's not funny.
239.96s: Let's take a look at a couple of these things.
241.68s: The first one.
242.72s: It says, over the past day and weekend,
244.72s: I've been sick mentally.
246.80s: Feel like throwing up.
248.40s: I want to know how I can cope with these losses mentally.
251.92s: Although my initial principle is money
253.64s: I was willing to lose.
255.16s: The idea of getting out of the game
256.76s: and the fact that I lost 99% of my portfolio
259.00s: is hard to swallow.
260.12s: All right, let's talk about it.
261.16s: The very first thing I see here obviously
263.08s: is a insanely emotional human being in general.
266.40s: This is not good.
267.48s: Not even just in trading, but in life.
270.20s: If you go through these emotional roller coasters,
273.40s: one, you gain nothing from it.
275.20s: Two, you detract your ability to think rationally
278.56s: and make good decisions.
280.12s: Three, you go through this awful cycle.
283.20s: There's no benefit from going through
285.84s: this kind of emotional cycle.
287.24s: Now, to be clear, I'm not saying don't have emotions.
290.12s: We all have emotions.
291.72s: It's ignorant to think that you could just,
294.08s: whatever, I don't have emotions anymore.
295.92s: You do, but you can acknowledge the emotions
298.68s: like this person is trying to,
300.40s: how can I cope with these losses mentally?
302.72s: So they're trying to, there is really late to the punch.
306.08s: They're waiting until it's super painful
308.24s: and now they're trying to figure out how to cope emotionally.
311.44s: So right out of the gate,
313.08s: I can see a contradiction in what they said.
315.44s: My initial principle is money I was willing to lose.
317.60s: Then they're saying the fact that I lost 99%
319.60s: of my portfolio is hard to swallow.
321.16s: This is a contradiction inherently so.
323.04s: Here's the deal.
323.96s: It is okay.
324.92s: The reason why it's okay is because guess what?
327.72s: We say things all the time that we think at the time we mean,
332.44s: but then when it happens, we don't mean.
334.84s: Humans are notorious for that kind of behavior.
338.52s: So this is where actually visualizing
341.88s: how you think you will feel
343.88s: and actually putting yourself in the scenario
346.96s: and saying to yourself genuinely, what do I think?
350.80s: Because what they are trying to do here
352.88s: is money I was willing to lose.
353.96s: They were trying to distance themselves
355.80s: and create psychological separation
357.44s: from their investing principle, which is very wise.
360.24s: They didn't take this seriously.
361.84s: The reason why I know they didn't take it seriously
363.92s: is literally in the same sentence.
366.16s: They say, I lost 99% of my portfolio is hard to swallow.
369.48s: If you were willing to lose the money,
371.24s: why is it so hard to swallow?
372.76s: Again, it's because we don't want to lose.
374.72s: We don't want to lose that money.
376.08s: So being honest with yourself about this first part,
379.12s: meaning you were not willing to lose this amount of money
382.24s: because you're obviously having a huge problem coping with it.
385.52s: This tells me we weren't honest in this step,
388.92s: which most of us aren't.
390.28s: This is the same thing you see with the New Year's Resolutioners.
393.32s: Oh, this year's different.
394.52s: I'm gonna be fit.
395.56s: I'm gonna go to the gym.
396.64s: I'm gonna clean up my diet.
398.24s: Humans say all sorts of shit in the moment,
401.20s: in the comfort of that moment,
403.32s: that they immediately drop as soon as it becomes slightly difficult.
407.36s: You think you're gonna wake up early
408.60s: until the alarm goes off at five and you're like,
410.76s: well, I'll do it tomorrow.
412.04s: I don't want to do it today.
413.20s: The problem with these kinds of things
414.60s: is you create this insanely slippery slope
417.72s: that then sets you up not even for a trading slash investing
421.88s: failure, but a lifetime of this vicious cycle.
425.56s: So we need to plan efficiently,
427.24s: which I'm gonna get into in just a second.
428.96s: And then there's greed.
429.92s: Here's the deal.
430.76s: Greed is not inherently bad.
432.76s: Oh, what?
433.60s: You're not supposed to like greed.
434.52s: What do you mean, greed's not bad?
435.96s: Greed is a huge motivating factor.
439.16s: I am greedy.
441.04s: I have enough money to live comfortably
443.56s: for the rest of my life if I so choose.
445.96s: However, I still want more because I want more opportunity.
450.56s: It's not just that I want to make more money
452.72s: so that I can be Scrooge McDuck.
454.44s: I like having more money because it allows me
456.60s: to also help more people to benefit more businesses
460.04s: by being a patron of them.
461.44s: Things like that matter a lot.
463.40s: So don't inherently dismiss greed is bad.
466.12s: Now where greed becomes bad is when it's oppressive.
469.64s: When you make poor decisions
471.44s: because your want of money is so great.
474.92s: If my greed, for example, was so excessive
477.76s: that I couldn't be happy unless I had a hundred million dollars,
481.72s: that is awful greed.
483.60s: Because then I'm essentially dismissing
485.32s: an entire possibility for a healthy, fulfilling life
488.56s: because I don't have this one super greedy metric.
491.40s: So you have to figure out what level of greed you have
494.68s: but then you have to be comfortable with the outcome.
497.00s: This person had an 8,000% annual return looking at them.
501.40s: Then they had a 100% draw down.
503.68s: This is what greed gets you in a lot of instances.
507.04s: Then this guy walks into my office and says,
510.28s: those same banks got greedy.
511.92s: They lost track of the market and I can profit off of their stupidity.
515.72s: So what I recommend for overcoming greed
518.44s: is again, this planning phase,
520.88s: which we're going to get into actually right now.
523.44s: Let's talk about growing from losses.
526.20s: Learn to lose well.
528.88s: What does that mean?
530.00s: We walk through a bunch of things from that scenario
532.40s: that can help us understand this idea of losing well.
535.04s: But here are some questions to help you with this idea
538.00s: of losing well.
539.12s: How do you feel after that losing trade, losing week, losing month?
543.40s: Again, bear yourself to yourself.
546.24s: All of this is useless unless you are honest.
549.48s: If you feel some type of way that's telling you something,
553.44s: if you genuinely do not feel perturbed in any way, that's where we want to be.
558.76s: If you have winning trades, you should not be elated.
562.44s: You should not be ecstatic.
564.04s: It just means you're going to be emotional to the other degree.
566.28s: We want to be even keeled.
568.12s: That is a much better way to live your life.
570.28s: Then as part of losing well is we have an opportunity
574.04s: to see how this fits into our system.
577.84s: So if we have this losing trade,
580.24s: we get to ask ourselves some more questions.
583.28s: Like, did I maintain proper sizing?
585.76s: Did I manage the trade according to my plan?
588.28s: Again, going back to this comfort seeking side of our mind,
591.76s: there's a lot of times when we have a trade plan that's written out,
595.00s: that's logical, that makes sense, that we then immediately want to violate
598.88s: because of all of these emotional forces.
601.60s: Sometimes even if you don't fully believe in your trading plan,
605.44s: as long as it involves managing risk,
607.72s: you are far better off managing the risk,
610.60s: following the trading plan,
611.84s: than updating the trading plan as needed.
614.40s: Because if you start to allow yourself to violate your trading plan
618.52s: to early, one, it's useless,
620.16s: two, you are opening up again, this very slippery psychological slope
625.00s: that is very difficult to reel back in later down the line.
628.52s: So did you manage it correctly,
630.20s: not only pertaining to did you follow your management plan,
633.20s: but did you as the operator behind the keyboard do the right steps?
638.60s: That matters almost equally as much as the actual edge development side of the strategy.
644.24s: How does this losing trade fit into the broader strategy performance?
647.56s: Guess what?
648.40s: Any strategy is going to have losing trades.
650.48s: We should be able to assess each of those losing trades and say,
653.36s: yes, I expected this.
655.16s: This is within the risk control parameters that I set.
657.68s: I said, I'm going to have an 8% stop loss.
659.56s: It's time for me to get out done and done.
661.32s: If you had a trade where you said,
663.28s: I had an 8% stop loss, but the loss is way bigger than I thought it was.
667.72s: That tells us something.
668.84s: We need to make some adjustments,
670.48s: which leads us into optimization.
673.72s: This is where we get to feed the cycle of information.
678.88s: So if we look at the performance of the strategy by itself,
682.84s: and then the portfolio, are you happy with it?
685.32s: Are you satisfied with your performance as the trader?
688.84s: Is there anything you missed that led to a losing trade?
692.68s: For example, if you were selling premium and then earnings popped up
695.68s: that you didn't know about, you missed something.
698.00s: That means you could have done something better.
699.96s: You need to integrate something else into your process.
702.88s: Are there new ideas that I want to test as a result of this loss?
706.72s: The name of the game here is looking at your process as a trader
711.68s: as feeding a system that we want to optimize over the long run.
716.96s: We're not looking at each individual losing circumstance
720.08s: as the end all be all because it's not unless you have
723.72s: awful risk control metrics.
725.44s: You have to control risk first and foremost.
727.52s: You can't invest no money.
729.56s: So risk control has to come first.
731.60s: But beyond that, every single data point you get to collect
734.88s: from both winning and losing trades allows you
737.28s: to optimize with the correct mindset.
740.04s: Remember, the obstacle is the way.
743.60s: Losing trades are difficult for our ego.
745.76s: We don't want to look at them.
747.08s: We want to exhibit the disposition effect
749.16s: where we cut winning trades too quickly,
751.48s: let losing trades run too long.
753.60s: But all of that is an opportunity for you
755.52s: to get better as a trader and optimize your system.
758.16s: If there's anything that I left out here,
759.60s: don't forget to throw it in the comments
761.04s: or share what your favorite one is.
763.24s: Like, subscribe, be an outlier.
764.84s: I'll see you guys later.
