0.64s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.36s: today I specifically want to talk about
5.16s: the FED watch tool and the reason why I
6.88s: want to talk about this is because the
8.84s: markets are all over the place right now
12.44s: and I think Traders may or may not fully
16.04s: comprehend what's going on behind the
18.20s: scenes so I actually want to talk about
20.80s: what I'm seeing behind the scenes so
23.04s: first let's grab the Futures and let's
25.64s: take a look first at Bond Behavior so we
29.76s: have ZN ZT both down pretty
33.56s: significantly and trailing down hard and
37.16s: if we pop over to the chart and we take
39.52s: a look at the corresponding yields
41.76s: you'll notice exactly what you would
43.80s: expect to see something like the 10-year
46.64s: is now up over 4% again this is not good
51.04s: from a broad Market perspective this is
52.88s: not good and I as hope as you hopefully
56.60s: know I'm not in the game of Doom and
58.96s: Gloom hyper
60.48s: I really avoid those kind of like
62.92s: language patterns so that what I say
65.88s: means what I'm trying to say this is not
68.80s: good the reason why this is not good is
71.28s: because it really starts to call into
73.28s: question what terminal rates will look
75.20s: like and what this whole inflation and
79.04s: rate cutting picture is going to look
80.72s: like and it's changing rapidly so let's
84.16s: take a look at the FED watch tool and I
88.20s: want to show you something if if we look
90.52s: back a week ago there was a 0%
94.52s: probability of no
96.60s: change then we look back a day ago it's
100.32s: 15% we look at it today it's down to
104.16s: 14% if we take a look at the probability
106.72s: for a 50 basis point cut a week ago it
109.64s: was over
111.28s: 36% now it's been zero for yesterday and
115.44s: today the probability of 25 bips is 85%
120.68s: what I want to show you is if we take a
123.16s: look at the historical price pattern of
126.20s: this movement and what this means for us
129.20s: is that the market is quite literally
132.16s: all over the board we do not have this
136.56s: priced in yet it's not priced in
138.68s: accurately it being whether or not we're
141.36s: going to get another cut how big the cut
143.28s: is the impact to the cut this is all
147.20s: completely up for grabs right now
149.28s: because if you take a look at the
150.92s: probability here of us essentially
155.28s: remaining no no change the probability
159.64s: for that hit zero starting on what the
162.72s: 19th that's this green line by the way
164.96s: if this is a little too noisy for you
166.48s: that's the current probability for no
167.88s: change is the green line and we can see
171.12s: that if we go back to 22 July it was
176.08s: 53% and then it cratered in the
180.56s: early August during that decline to what
184.12s: 5% skyrocketed back up over the next two
187.12s: weeks to
188.52s: 61% and then another month or so and
192.04s: crater to zero and now it's back up to
196.76s: 15.6% this is all over the place so what
202.20s: does this mean for markets well it tells
204.80s: me two really important features the
208.28s: first one this is the same exact trade
211.72s: that I reviewed not too long ago in the
213.60s: Russell where I made over $100,000 like
215.76s: the course of a week and it was
217.76s: essentially playing a single move based
221.16s: on some of what I'm seeing here and it's
225.24s: entirely about when does this get priced
227.60s: in when does the start when does the
229.36s: market start moving off of this
231.36s: information which right now it's all
234.28s: over the map when you see this kind of
236.92s: change and you see this being all over
238.92s: the map it tell tells me that this is
240.96s: not priced inefficiently and that we are
243.40s: bouncing based on every little bit of
246.00s: new data that's coming in causing near
248.32s: 20% swings over the course of a couple
250.72s: days that's huge so when I think about
253.92s: trading the market in a broad
255.28s: perspective it's we're hanging near
257.12s: highs yet I see 10-year yield up over 4%
261.60s: so it's it's this is a series of red
265.20s: flashing signs that are kind of all over
267.00s: the place to me so the way I look at
270.36s: this is keeping the cards really close
273.00s: to the chest that's exactly how I'm
275.12s: positioning because if you look at small
277.28s: caps they're not showing you this 25 or
280.60s: even 50 bips cut they've been running
282.80s: flat after a decline from the previous
285.72s: cut it's not showing us anything we are
288.96s: however seeing volatility expand we are
291.52s: seeing Tech run sideways now for what is
294.96s: this a a month almost I mean depending
298.40s: on where you want to call it starting to
299.84s: Peak it's been about a month that we've
302.04s: started this rally and then it's slowed
303.88s: down essentially from the 19th on it's
305.96s: just been rolling sideways and then we
308.96s: see e minis S&P 500 hovering right near
313.08s: all-time Highs but also massively
316.44s: consolidating all of that is indecision
320.32s: this is people are not necessarily
322.56s: wanting to weigh to heavily right now
324.68s: one way or the other let's take a look
328.16s: at the cop report
331.52s: if we flip through
333.52s: here you can see a couple really
336.84s: noteworthy things again we're focusing
339.48s: primarily not on commercials but we want
342.12s: large speculators the green line take a
344.56s: look at the movement in their
346.32s: positioning they we hit an extreme in
349.60s: 2023 about the summer they started
352.84s: rolling up positioning net positive
355.96s: April and we've been hovering net
359.08s: positive net negative but take a look at
361.00s: the change from 16
364.52s: September this was running at-
367.20s: 35,000 and then if you look at it
370.44s: today 70 or I'm sorry 7500
374.28s: 7550 so speculators are very very
377.84s: clearly positioning here now again this
380.96s: is for The e- Minis so this is difficult
384.04s: to use you kind of have to use it when
385.52s: it's at extremes but this kind of
388.40s: movement pattern again look how Jagged
390.52s: this is this is large speculators
393.20s: flipping positions very very readily and
396.44s: it's not a defined Trend right so you
398.52s: can see periods where they'll flip their
400.32s: positions but it's almost like a stair
401.72s: step there's still a defined tread in
403.60s: there that's not what we see in their
405.04s: positioning right now it is quite
406.88s: literally all over the map and this is
410.44s: the last we saw again when I say today
412.56s: this is for the the 30th it lags a
414.76s: little bit so I am really eager to see
419.72s: how this ends up resolving in the near
421.64s: future the name of the game is keep a
423.52s: really close eye on this probability
426.00s: because based on how this goes based on
428.16s: some of the inflation data that we're
430.04s: seeing coming up soon it is going to be
433.08s: supremely topical one other thing that I
435.08s: want to show you is if we pop up the vix
438.28s: it doesn't look that busy right it's
440.28s: definitely popping a little bit low 20s
442.32s: there's nothing here that really jumps
443.80s: out at me but then if we go into the
447.08s: options let's take a look at the volume
449.68s: today 430,000 calls against 233,000 puts
455.72s: take a look at where most of these calls
458.96s: are they're short dat we have 16 o 25s
464.68s: there's 33,000 of those that traded then
467.76s: we have the same 16 o 45s 22,000 of
471.76s: those gone this is really interesting
475.44s: front positioning in options that you do
478.44s: not typically see
480.44s: it is very strange so if we look at the
483.68s: open interest and we take a look at the
485.76s: 16 o there's 3.6 million calls against 2
490.32s: million puts and if we look at all
492.88s: series it's about 9 A5 million so a
496.00s: critical density of that is shortterm
499.04s: options which again is a little less
501.28s: common a lot of times you'll see it like
502.84s: this where if we go further out in time
505.24s: you'll notice that on the primary
506.80s: expiration this January it'll typically
509.04s: pretty be pretty high and then I'm
511.68s: guessing we'll see around the election
513.92s: also very high 2.4 million so this is
518.44s: expectation of a near-term movement like
520.36s: that's that's really what this boils
521.76s: down to and we have CPI PPI coming up
525.52s: this looks like it's hard to tell if
527.04s: it's speculating pure downside or people
529.00s: hedging but this looks like something's
530.76s: going on so I am preparing my portfolio
533.64s: for that scenario and then again if
534.92s: nothing happens great that's beautiful
536.80s: roll on and simply reposition but right
539.80s: now is not a time that I'm adding a ton
541.24s: of risk I'm keeping what I have out very
544.80s: very close to the chest meaning ready to
547.08s: move exit flatten adjust as needed just
550.00s: because all of this looks very strange
551.56s: to me so any questions anything I should
553.60s: take a look at let me know be an outlier
555.56s: see you later
