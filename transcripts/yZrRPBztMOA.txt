 What's up everyone Eric here welcome back to the ally or podcast and I have my relatively new friend Wes here from Alfarchitect what's up Wes thanks for joining me. Hey you got it Eric appreciate being here. So obviously I did a little bit of homework on your background and I realized that you decided to be a gross overachiever did a MBA PhD. I'm just curious to you like how many letters do you have after your name at this point and are we missing something. I was just tell people I used to be really motivated when I was younger and I just for whatever reason kept grinding and did a bunch of shit but I'm a lot lazier now so that's in the past I'm I'm living on legacy. I'm not that cool as like I used to be is what I would say. So you really had a fascinating background I ended up catching one of your podcasts with I think our mutual friends Michael Gaiehd and a lot of what you guys were talking about really resonated with me and literally as I was just talking to you a little bit before we started recording the way that you've gone about essentially your entire career and then entrance into finance is kind of anomalous where you started education took a break wouldn't been did the Marine Corps thing for a bit and some time I think it was in Iraq advising and then you came back and decided to do the big brain stuff and you just talk a little bit more about how that all molded into your entry into markets eventually because I think one of the things a lot of people from my audience may or may not understand is that a lot of people find their way into markets from all different kinds of crazy backgrounds and I think you represent that to a pretty pretty significant degree. Yes, let me give you the nickel tour on how the hell I ended up where I am right now. So this coat so I grew up on a cattle ranch in the middle of nowhere in the Colorado mountains and we were broke as shit right and when I was a kid he just has to go hang out with Jaime and work irrigation ditches flipping hay bells and like just doing all this manual labor and I hated it and I kept asking my dad I was like I don't want to do this for us in my life I'd rather have money you know because this sucks like it was just that blatant and he's like well you know he's a he's a freaking cowboy he doesn't know anything about finance but I had a grandmother who who actually had a San Diego over your base who was into like this guy called Warren Buffett and and my dad's like hey you should go talk to Gramma Ginny because she's in the investing and like knows all this stuff so I talked to her and she got me into the whole like bin gram Warren Buffett thing so I started literally when I was a kid like you know not not five at that time you know but probably like 10 or 12 where I was like oh man this is really cool like you could take money and make more money and I don't have to do any work duh and so I just initially it was purely financially motivated to not be broke and it seemed like finance was like a good way to do that like I can't it's just was that grotesque I just wanted to get rich and then what happened is I went to college and I started you know is that at this fancy undergrad business school and I just started actually liking the topic right like I started getting obsessed with I re like every book everything that I could even get my hands on related to investing and it became like more like an intellectual obsession like obviously I still wanted to get rich in the back of my head but really was just interesting right and then then what happened is I did really well in one of these classes and the professor was like hey you know you should consider doing research which was code word for hey be my data monkey programming bitch and like you know do all the nasty stuff and then I'll put my name on it the looks mark but at the time it sounded great professors asked me to do something and Indian it was great but like then I got my hands dirty and like the deep research like programming data stuff and I was like and I just kept getting more and more interested in it as a topic and then what happened is as all the staff there the professor said hey you know you should consider doing a PhD and I was like great how does that work they're like well apply to this place code University of Chicago I was like great I'll never get in they're like we'll get you in because it's very like close-hold deal and all them were Chicago PhDs so then I got in a PhD program and then you know I spent two years there and then I actually always wanted to do the service but I couldn't get the timing right so then I took a sabbatical to go join the Marines right I was in the 040 yeah 0408 and then I came back to finish my PhD 08 to 10 and I had to kind of like relearn finance obviously and and you know then it was great I was like I'm like already like all in on finance I still wanted to make money but then I got I got a professor job which I don't know if you know much about professor jobs but it's not a real job right your job is to get paid a lot of money to sit around and think about things this is pretty awesome and so that's what I did and then simultaneous to that like way back in the day like this was probably I don't remember 2009 2010 time frame you know I was doing a blog like it used to be blogger blog spot some ghetto Google thing that I don't even have exist anymore and like for whatever reason that this was again like there was like five blogs in the world back then and no one was doing like geeky quant finance oh yeah I said we had I had literally I had a billionaire co-call me and said hey west I've been reading your blog I read your dissertation can we talk it like just dumb luck man from a stupid blog like I'm sure somebody like on your youtube channel might call you up someday that's like that's how what happened and and then I was like oh my god this is my first opportunity to maybe start a business because I finally met a billionaire who's interested in what I have to say and you know one thing led to the next we got seated 2012 of 50 mill and now the rest is history I quit my professor job and then we just built you know our business to not even know what we got now 10 or 11 billion dollars or something I mean so that was my journey now how do you even track it all you know exactly my whole life I was just worried about trying to get one million or like hey well some of please give me 10,000 bucks you know I'm eating ramen noodles here this sucks and then now now we're at a stage where like you know we get a hundred billion or a hundred million a day and I'm like yeah whatever rounding air like it's you know it's crazy that you're how your perspective changes but I'm still close enough to be in broke that I still kind of remember this struggle but but I'm you know I'm kind of getting soft and it's not keep going into more and more AUM you know I got to I got to stay humble and grounded somehow I need to figure that one out so I don't don't worry I'm here to bring the poor did you yeah good yeah yeah make sure we get I got to keep the humble pie going you know I'm gonna get too big for your bridges so first follow question from that is why PhD you obviously had finished the original prerequisites to go yeah essentially start the workforce why do more education instead of another workforce to me like obviously wasn't a monetary thing because I could have just left with the NBA and go made a lot more money for me it was just the challenge and like you know PhD is kind of considered like the pinnacle of what you can do and I just like hey I've already done most of the work let's just bang this out and and that's what I just thought it's just like I just want to try to get the highest you can get in in this world and so that's what I just did that you know and obviously that probably was a better financial decision in the long game because I've said you'd know a lot more you got a lot more credibility but you know it's also a lot easier to like not be a slave student labor force for some professors whether your PhD make a 10 grand a year probably been smart to go make a 150 200 K you know in the short run but the long game I think it's worth it just go for it which is why I did I can't really justify it from a financial perspective makes total sense then the next thing you mentioned that I was actually had a written down as a question because I find it so fascinating one of the things I find interesting about life is that a lot of times there is to your point with your billionaire friend a healthy dose of just pure dumb blind luck that tends to co less with some sort of skill set that has you primed to take advantage of the opportunity so when that billionaire cold called you what was your approach to take advantage of the opportunity because I feel like a lot of people they might see those kinds of opportunities but either get frozen and not do something about it fuck it up and not take advantage of it the right way what did you do yeah so again going back to the luck component so this was this was right after oh eight right so so what happened after oh eight is that everyone got smoked out and no one believed in the unicorn anymore right like all the hedge funds all the fancy stuff got vetted as saying like wait a second all you hedge fund people that were paying all this money to they were supposed to protect my money you actually are down 30% you know at a market is down 50 but you know you're not supposed to be down any percent and and so and then not only that but I don't know you probably don't know this but possessions 910th the law so in those partnerships what happens is during stress you say I want my money and they say you know what just joking we're gonna gate the fund you know for forduce your obligations we can't give you your money and you're like well I want my money and so you you start like 2008 was like a great wake up call to the world that paying too much on fees you know not having to control your money paying too much in taxes is a way of the dodo bird there's got to be a better way so I was coming in right after that were said billionaire basically was tired of dealing with Wall Street and started reading blogs and he finds this idiot called West Gray with his PhD he's innocent enough and he's not like he's not uh he's not poisoned by the culture of Wall Street right he's seen so so he reaches out and he's like listen ma'am I read all your stuff I love your background we need help to transition our families business from these over price hedge funds to transparent scalable low cost like factor or index type strategies and obviously I'm a quant by background and this is all I think about and all I do so so that that luck of just I haven't have that quant skill set and a billionaire guy just got smoked out by all the hedge fund idiots and he's like I want your skill set I mean it was just easy right and and and I was just at the time this is what I always wanted to do is start my own business but as you know in asset management you need a lot of money to start a month start the business because no one wants to invest with someone that has ten bucks it was perfect so it was just I was ready uh going there um so yeah and then I'll give you another one which is does that one I kind of was waiting for I don't question on that one though yeah did you said it was easy did when you started going down that path were you like super confident I know exactly what I'm going to do I know this is how it's going to work out and you executed a plan or was it a kind of building the plan as it's flying kind of scenario uh that one because I've been obsessed with what I was going to do every time I could even think about it in my head I knew exactly what I was going to do but it's more about dragging the client along right so we we actually that was 2010 and actually we didn't get seated till 2012 because the other thing I ran into is is the dad of the family who's not technically control for tax reasons but you know you know dad made all the money he's kind of action control you know they just got out of the seating business they're like you know they're just like we just got smoked by all these hedge funds that we we would give them money and then then we get a piece of their business we're not doing that ever again and so while I was coming in with the exact sort of capabilities they also said we're not seating a new fund operation ever again and so what I said is like listen okay cool give me two years we'll do consulting we'll do work and and if and if we show our you know if we show our value add can you please please beg and plead and and like can we work a deal if we do the right thing to get seated so so it wasn't automatic it took like two years of grinding it out you know showing hundred capabilities and I knew exactly what I wanted to do I wanted to get seated and I wanted to get track records in our strategies as soon as possible but I you can only move as fast as the billionaire is going to move right so all that stuff was premeditated murder and I was just waiting for the opportunity but let me give you another example that that wasn't like that so you know and now where I am right now we're on this massive infrastructure business how the hell does a quant finance PhD end up being a used car salesman for like infrastructure that makes no damn sense and now this business is way bigger than our other business well what happened here is you know and this again just dumb luck like we're doing Alphargetek we're launching our own ETFs and we're you know I'm marine my one of my business partners marine as you know it's all about do more with less we don't need big army we'll go figure out this this stuff on our own and so that culture kind of like was with us so being idiots we said oh we'll just DIY all this ETF infrastructure and you know which obviously looking back was idiotic but at the time you know when you don't know you don't know you just figure it out and so you know we did that for 10 years and then you know five years ago a gal hit us up she's like why don't you guys let other people use your infrastructure because you guys do it so much more efficiently and cheaper than everyone else in the public market it would be really nice if you'd like rent your your your infrastructure to me and we're like we're not going to do that we don't we don't do like monkey work we're just we're portfolio managers and we only do like the good stuff right the rock star job she's like well you guys would be really good at this and anyways long story short we find it said okay fine we'll do it like you know not because we wanted to like who wants to be the garbage man for someone else and and that lucky decision not even planning on being in this business kind of just being nice to a friend that end up being an explosive business opportunity where when we just took our cost center turned it into a business and now everyone in the world wants to start an ETF and everyone in the world wants to do it low cost easy and transparently like we created this monster and I and I was never even close to being in the business plant that is crazy like I would never in a million years have thought about I'd be in this business and now this business like I said makes more money is a bigger business than the asset manager business ever thought of being you know you just these things happen in life well I find they happen but it takes a certain temperament for it to happen right like there's even to your point at first you're resistant to the idea but then you turn around you're like yeah sure we'll give it a shot right even the fact that you me uh that first phone call we had right like you chose to just give me a shot to talk to you I find that people that tend to have that at why not you know what like what's it going to hurt like just give it a shot tend to have interesting results because sooner or later I feel like that's what it takes to start seeing some forward progress now yeah going back to your first fund you talked about this strategy that you built and that essentially you were waiting for a chance to deploy it how did you build that strategy yeah so this is a really long story uh I'll try to make it quick so yeah yeah yeah go way back in the day so just because everyone has their start in their world and that shapes their rest of their investment experience right so my first real investing was in like 98 99 when there was an internet bubble which was really weird because there's so much deja vu I get in today's market where all these tech stocks are going crazy like it's insane and like all the value kind of boring stuff is like that'll never work they're never going to have a business it was literally the same story in 98 99 and I just happened to be school I was trained because it was my only training in Warren Buffett value investing so so obviously when I got started I was like god am I just an idiot because like I'm not making any money in every of these other idiots gambling on tech stocks are making thousand or percent a year but because I hadn't had enough time to change my mind I got lucky because you probably recall like in 99 the Nasdaq triple q went down 80% or whatever it was maybe it's 90% I came remembers insane and value stocks made money and I was like damn and I was stock picking I thought I was gonna be Warren Buffett I didn't know what a computer was for doing this stuff right anyways so I start off as a fundamental funny dutty value investing you know loser type guy like what most people consider loser so that was that was my original training and then just over time you know I just got I was interested in scalability making it easier so naturally you gravitate through like well can we do this with a computer it seems a lot more efficient and so I had always tried to systemize the value philosophy with a machine because it's a pain he asked to read 10k's and like call people up it's just annoying and then like in my grad school during PhD kind of one of the things I kind of proved to myself is that yes a computer can for all intensive purposes replicate you know 95% of what the people can do anyways and so I kind of just there's more to this story but I just totally threw stock picking you know with my brain in the trash can and I just became a quam if it's not if I can't code it up can't put it in the system with rules I ain't doing it and so and and so I just had cooked these different strategies up and another interesting story which is another which is a as a bad story in in the end is right when I got out of service my original tempt is we launched a hedge fund I launched it in september 08 which is literally the pinnacle exactly perfect timing just bad luck in this case and and so I launched this damn want value like like systematic value strategy long short in september 08 of course the first month I launched they say it's basically illegal to short like like they they were recalling short positions on like Russell 2000 it like like things you would ever think you wouldn't be able to you could short all the time literally like the interactive brokers are like there's no short available I'm like well how am I going to run a long short fund yeah yeah if I can't short and and so I was like well fuck I just started this thing and I can't even implement the very strategy so then then because of an idiot I talked to the partners I'm like well we can't do that we go back to stock picking and they're like sure if you think there's and so I did that you know blah blah blah and then that funded up being a disaster as you can imagine because I did stock picking it should just been a quomp and then you know an adventure I had this whole convoluted path right kept I was a value investor fundamental but then I didn't systematic and I had a few permutations of it and then I wrote a book where it's basically a book about this is how I would go about computerizing what value investors do it's called quantitative value right and then that so that book is is the strategy effectively we've obviously tweaked it over time and that's what we ended up getting seated so so this was like probably a 10 year you know strategy experience development to finally get there and we still run those strategies to this day but but that that's how I eventually kind of bob and weave to you know doing this systematic quantitative value thing I was just obsessed with it talk to me about the focus behind that I think a lot of thing for traders and I imagine especially going through your background there's got to be a pretty significant period of time where you're like testing different things coming across new ideas different approaches but you've kind of stayed centered on your thing value investing slightly different permutations and whatnot so how did you stay so focused on that and were you testing other things and you kept coming back to home base or what did that look like? Yeah so I always just like anybody like human nature is to anchor on what you first see what you think is good and then once you get anchored on something it's very hard to accept new ideas right but luckily you know I was trained in the depths of University of Chicago which the culture of that place is it's an idea like violent idea exchange and like if you post an idea our job is not to tell you how great your ideas our idea is to tell you how stupid you are and how screwed up it is which is not exactly a fun culture to be in to be frank but it's a great way to kind of just be open to new ideas and never think you have a monopoly on what works right but of course being a human start off as a value picker it works great at the end of 99 and it worked great through the early 2000s thought I was a genius then I have you know the systematic value book use those systems all good except you know being an academic and being so exposed to academic research where all you have there is just PhDs turning data all day to figure out ideas you know I was always aware of things like trend falling momentum and like gazillions of strategies right it's just I was resistant because I knew and had confidence and had ego tied to value and then it was only just I guess actually one that especially that billionaire like with respect to trendfall like if you would have asked me before 2010 if I thought trend falling was a good idea I had to told your fucking insane right because trend falling as you can imagine in value investor circles it's crazy like you're a devil worshipper if you think you're gonna move out a market like he used to trend like price trends to like like you it's literally insanity it's literally like being a devil worshipper if you're in the value religion camp and then I had this billionaire guy telling me like hey man I because he's also interested in our value stuff he's like he's like I've been to a trendfall for like 30 years man like why don't you do that like it's common secret I'm like well because professors say it's stupid and you're an idiot he's like well I appreciate you telling me I'm an idiot even on my billionaire but you know you should investigate it more and so I was like all right whatever you know he's a client I gotta do it and I started yeah exactly all a piece of but I know he's gonna be wrong and ensure enough as I dug in I'm like holy shit this is one of the greatest ideas ever why did all these damn professors shit on this my whole life you know and then after the fact like the last 20 years has been a lot more research from academics to say oh wow trend falling works to which most people are like well no shit like we've known that for 50 years but it's a but it just takes time right so I had to adapt because sometimes you just need a trigger point to get you to think outside of your own box and that I've been around for so long I'm open to any idea at some level I just want to make sure is it evidence based is it robust is it is it grounded in like some sort of financial economics or behavioral issues like it's got to pass the sniff test but I'm open to a lot of ideas which is why we do value we do momentum we do trend I do you know anything you name we probably do some element of it now where that wouldn't have been the case maybe 10 or 15 years ago that means it's honest sense that's actually going to be one of my follow-up questions because I do find a lot of times there's a really interesting valley between theoretical application and then actual like in market application of ideas and to me that's actually one of been one of the the benefits of being a retail trader is you do have the luxury of looking at something and saying I like this or don't like this throw this out try something new and I mean you obviously are super smart I know I'm an idiot so I don't trust any my own ideas I'm not really sent on anything I am very receptive now yeah one of the follow-ups to that though is when you look across your time in academia compared to like practically interacting with markets what are some of the largest disparities you see in terms of truths held in academia that does not cross over into markets yeah so so the good thing about academia is there's not like a financial incentive per se right it's an idea place but but obviously if you're just an idea place slash ivory tower you think about ideas but you obviously don't really consider like the practicalities of these ideas right so I really loved academics because it teaches you how to be like a researcher and try your best use like the scientific method you know in theory come up with a theory and then you have you have different hypotheses you use data to test hypotheses to validate it you know blah blah blah and it doesn't work like that perfectly but at least you don't have the financial incentive of like selling someone a product or selling someone a back test so they give you money to make money on right so I like the purity of it but of course that's nice from an ideas generation component but then we need to also consider to your point well that's great mr ivory tower but you know you can't do that because you can't short you can't use the margin you can't trade penny stocks with a billion dollars without moving the stock whatever right so obviously the practitioners are very good at understanding the nuance of implementation but there's enough the biggest challenge I think is academia is great because it's basically trained researchers trying to develop new ideas that go through the fire of peer review and of course they got bias and of course they got issues like saying trend falling stupid and eventually they'll change their mind which they've done but they don't they have clean incentives generally practitioners the issue there is they're good at implementing strategies but they have to deal with other people's money so one of the biggest economies is retail investors have this amazing advantage of the system that's their money and they want to maximize presumably their benefits right we're third party managers in the business of managing money you're now managing money on behalf of someone else and you need to look good and and how do you look good well in the short run you have benchmarks and so there's massive constraints on professionals and investors to conform to the status quo because imagine if I have a strategy it does the following it's underperform seven out of 10 years and it compounds one dollar to say a hundred dollars but it underperforms seven out of 10 years and I'm managing other people's money the other strategy basically beats the market call it eight out of 10 years but it ends up doing one dollar to say ninety five dollars so over 10 year periods actually worse however the path is a lot more marketable and it's a lot easier to collect more money to charge fees and other people's money than a strategy that loses seven times out of 10 right so so professionals have this very constrained thing that they have to deal with which is called other people's money whereas retail people can literally do whatever the hell they want however retail people can do whatever the hell they want but now they also suffer a lot of times from behavioral biases over confidence and all these other problems so there's no there's no right answer it's all about like what are the incentives what are the behaviors and then that's going to be the best solution for that particular circumstance and yeah makes a ton of sense and there's a lot of edge in there like like retail people like you know hey you want to go you want to go do some trend falling strategies on game stop I think that's a great strategy same thing like crypto like if someone if I didn't have so much compliance and I could go do like a three-month trend falling strategy and crypto I'd be doing that all day long I can't there's too much compliance there's too much everything like no no professional could go gamble on game stop or even do a smart gamble on game stop because it's too constraining whereas retail if you can click the button in Robin Hood you can do it every one right so so there's a lot of opportunities to as a retail investor if you can contain you know your behavioral issues which which is because there's not so many rules on you sometimes that can actually make you make bad decisions as well so it's all about trying to weigh those cost benefits yeah you I think did just huge service to analyzing some of the retail perspective and I think that's super important because I tried to remind retail traders that in general you are disadvantaged in the marketplace that doesn't mean you're totally disadvantaged and you're literally hiding some of the key advantages I think most of us may or may not capitalize on so following that thread a little bit more leaning into the retail perspective and some of the strengths they have you highlighted some of the weaknesses being behavioral biases if you were a budding retail trader how would you approach trying to be a successful long-term retail trader yeah so what I would do is do do weird stuff right like for example like I'll give example like kind of what we do in the business because we're one of the weird people that that we just do weird stuff because I originally built strategies because I wanted to do it for my own money frankly even though it's not like anyone else did it right so generally but let's say we do a signal that we have a lot of profits and call it factor X let's just say the value factor just because everyone knows kind of generally what that is and you're a retail trader and you're like all right everyone probably knows that buying cheap stocks is a good idea over the long haul but what's the institutional other people money guy going to do they're gonna be like wow God if you buy cheap stocks over like the next 50 years in general you get like three or four percent of the market great that's what they're going to look at how much money can I make on this damn thing and you can do that because a retail trader can actually think 20 30 years out and they don't you can't fire yourself the institutional traders can be like wait a second let's not we got to be careful here because we know value can lose its ass over many year stretches we can't run like buy the top 10% cheap stocks even though that algorithm looks amazing well we're gonna do is we're gonna go up by all 500 S&P stocks and do little tits where it's 99% the same as S&P but we're gonna call it value and carry on in life because we're just in the marketing business we're not in the investing business where as a retail person could be like I'm not trying to sell my stuff to other people I did the back test and just buying the 10% cheapest P E stocks makes 3% more than the market over long horizons and yeah it underperforms and looks like puke sometimes who cares roger that I'm in like and I'm just giving out as a simple example I'm not saying it has to be value but anytime you identify strategies that you know institutional professional investors with puke on you know you're on the right track and to the extent that they're hard to hold and if you had to show your statement to your mom every day she'd be like you know what planet do you live on like even though that's not doesn't sound good that's actually the perfect because that's where all your edges is doing weird stuff that the institutional guys can't really do and you have horizon you can't fire yourself so any opportunity that high level is weird and hard to do and looks ugly in the short run is usually a great strategy and something that we have competitive edge as retail trader effectively it's funny you say that have you read the book what works on Wall Street by a shionist source yeah yeah it's a great book it's funny because he talks a lot about the multifactor models and a lot of the components that you're referencing there which is it's funny because a lot of what I've done on the retail side is I've kind of built my own data set that I can track various factors and essentially conduct similar analysis I find it interesting that you and eightly go to kind of long run performance though is that your typical leaning yes I'll tell you why I've hung around a lot of rich people and the number one thing that rich people are good at is avoiding fees and avoiding taxes right it doesn't matter if you're going to try to scoop the markets are extremely competitive in general and so if you think over any sort of long duration period you're going to be able to edge out more than a couple percent without taking extraordinary risk you're wrong because it's just too competitive right however what can you control fees and taxes and what is the destructor and what is the generator of fees and taxes trading a lot so necessarily you have a huge disadvantage as a retail investor unless you don't have any money because you're going to have high marginal tax rates and you're usually going to have high frictional costs compared to like how the cost for me to trade and so you have to in general if you want to compound and you're not you know it's just the math right like let's say your your compounding rate is 10 percent well one plus 10 percent but you got a minus off fee cost minus off tax costs that might be five one plus 0.05 to the 50th is way lower than say 1.07 to the 50th where let's say you can do a strategy that makes 7 percent but you can do a low turnover and not have to pay a lot of taxes that's better than something that makes 10 percent but after fees and taxes you make 5 percent it's just math so so I've just noticed over the long haul that rich people the reason they're rich is not because of genius investors frankly they're usually okay or good enough for government work but they're great at avoiding taxes and they're great at minimizing fees so that that's why I so focus on long duration when you're an individual because it's the only edge you got interesting yeah I find that absolutely fascinating because to me I think one of the things retail traders can do to really amplify returns at least as far as I've attempted to do is right along and try to pace market as best as possible during up years and then when the market is having draw downs do my very best to not participate at all and I've found by essentially having a slightly more active approach and then it sounds like you would lean towards I've found that actually has worked super well for me because so I don't have too many like crazy knockout of the ballpark years I've had two negative years my first two I'm both less than 5 percent so there's you just got to solve the fees and taxes problem so if you can if you can somehow put this in qualified accounts or get like buy real estate to shield it you just you got to get the tax man off your back or you're never going to be able to compound at the appropriate rates even with a lot of edge and then as always your your cost the frictional cost you got managed because you know which I'm sure you do I'm not saying you can't do this you just want to be very very painfully aware of how do I do this strategy while minimizing tax hits and fee hits because that that's what that's like the way in fact it'll drag you down into the mud at some point well and I also think that's one of the things that retail traders in general they don't really acknowledge because especially with the decline of commissions right I think real traders still don't understand all of the friction in each of their transactions especially now that it's essentially hidden and it's behind the payment for order flow and stuff like that they're not seeing it upfront so the fact the fact that you highlight that and that's been one of the most common threads across professional traders that I've spoken with I think it's something that people should really key into even though it's not something you can directly see it's there yeah so but going to your point like you're basically outlining a trend falling strategy trend falling is actually the ultimate strategy that institutions and professionals will generally avoid because as you probably know like most trend strategies over the long haul give you the same performance with half the drawdown just generic quick the problem is you get whips on a lot which is not a big deal like if you're a trend follower that's trend falling you're going to lose price six or seven out of ten but that's not the point the point is I participate most of the time and win and I avoid the big drawdown but can you imagine and unfortunately I've lived this but you could imagine being a professional managing other people's money and you're trend falling and like the market goes rip in and you're flat you know like you need a full cycle to actually see if it's actually working for you and it's just that's a strategy just generically that fits in that mold of extremely painful to do and it looks weird in the short run and that and most professionals just can't do it so I I mean I think that's a retail haven you now you just got to manage the taxes and the fees and you got a home ding it I'm all in on that that's a great idea yeah it well and it's funny too because I primarily trade derivatives so you can add leverage to some of it and you know be a real generate out there but that's you know that that's have the fun is I pretty much have to report to my board member which is my dog sitting right here and he does it exactly yeah yeah I love it and you and you can do smart things just because you want to do them you're not you don't got boards constituencies you're not trying to impress somebody so retail individuals like I retail is kind of got like a negative connotation what I would say is direct capital owners because you can be retail and have ten bucks or you can be retail and have a billion bucks like I know guys that have billion dollars they don't have any advisors they just trade their money and you know they're retail it's it's really just are you do you care about maximizing your own wealth and managing your own behavioral issues or are you managing other people's money which means you got a whole another set of incentives and then just those different groups have different ways of going about it but retail is not necessarily bad or good it's just a different incentive structure they are you're dealing with which has advantages and disadvantages yep I think that makes a lot of sense and I'm glad that you brought up the behavioral thing as well because it's something that I refer people a lot I actually try to get people on SSRN as much as humanly possible and put them in front of different kind of studies like one of my favorites is the behavior of individual investors by Lee and Odin Barbara Lee and Odin and it talks about a lot of retail trader tendencies because to your point I think the autonomy is good but it's almost like when you give some people too much autonomy they don't know to do with it and then they try a strategy for two weeks it's a good path so now they think they have a crack then there's bad path and now they abandon it and so on and so forth so it's that's actually something I'd love to follow up with you on sometime a little bit more about regulating more of the behavioral side of trading for retail investors I think that would be super super fun but we are at time less and I am committed to getting you out of here on time to enjoy the rest of your day I genuinely value you come in to hang out for a little bit obviously I feel at a media since a chroma camaraderie with you so thanks for kicking it for a little bit if people want to get a hold of you or do you want them to hop over to your Twitter page or X or whatever I'm supposed to call it or say yeah yeah I still call it Twitter too yeah I'm just Alpharctic on Twitter I'll throw a link in yeah and just you know our websites Alpharctic we post blog posts and do all kinds of research ideas that you could try to actually implement a lot like we're always posting new ideas we don't do them all I'm sure some of these blogs you know if someone had the time they could code it up and start trading on it probably makes them money so yeah I appreciate what you're doing too like it's very important that retail and individual investors just get it straight and don't aren't get don't get told that like money grows on trees it's so easy you know that's just the worst situation and getting rich quick is never going to happen reliably so so people like you then kind of like say hey you got to be honest with it do the right thing work hard all that you know I think that's a very important message for the investing public yeah I appreciate that I always think of it as the like the traders paradox because pretty much all traders I know we start trading in the attempt to make money fast and this is one of the worst possible places to try to do it it's literally a paradox it's the funniest thing and the best part about it is everybody that I meet that's super successful in the business they're all super fucking hard working go figure so yeah that's how it works man that seems to be the case in in every business like if it was so easy everyone would do it and everyone would get rich but unfortunately to make money you can always get lucky but in general you just got a work hard and add value and you know it's just unfortunately part of the deal that's it man head down get to work everybody so thanks for hanging out to the end and we'll see you guys on the next one
