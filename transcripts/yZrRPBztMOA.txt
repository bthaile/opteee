0.00s: What's up everyone Eric here welcome back to the ally or podcast and I have my relatively
8.06s: new friend Wes here from Alfarchitect what's up Wes thanks for joining me.
12.96s: Hey you got it Eric appreciate being here.
16.04s: So obviously I did a little bit of homework on your background and I realized that you
20.70s: decided to be a gross overachiever did a MBA PhD.
24.80s: I'm just curious to you like how many letters do you have after your name at this point
28.16s: and are we missing something.
30.60s: I was just tell people I used to be really motivated when I was younger and I just for
35.48s: whatever reason kept grinding and did a bunch of shit but I'm a lot lazier now so that's
41.40s: in the past I'm I'm living on legacy.
44.60s: I'm not that cool as like I used to be is what I would say.
49.08s: So you really had a fascinating background I ended up catching one of your podcasts with
56.04s: I think our mutual friends Michael Gaiehd and a lot of what you guys were talking about
62.20s: really resonated with me and literally as I was just talking to you a little bit before
65.76s: we started recording the way that you've gone about essentially your entire career and
71.24s: then entrance into finance is kind of anomalous where you started education took a break
77.36s: wouldn't been did the Marine Corps thing for a bit and some time I think it was in Iraq
82.44s: advising and then you came back and decided to do the big brain stuff and you just talk
90.48s: a little bit more about how that all molded into your entry into markets eventually because
97.96s: I think one of the things a lot of people from my audience may or may not understand is
101.92s: that a lot of people find their way into markets from all different kinds of crazy backgrounds
107.68s: and I think you represent that to a pretty pretty significant degree.
112.04s: Yes, let me give you the nickel tour on how the hell I ended up where I am right now.
117.32s: So this coat so I grew up on a cattle ranch in the middle of nowhere in the Colorado mountains
122.60s: and we were broke as shit right and when I was a kid he just has to go hang out with Jaime
128.60s: and work irrigation ditches flipping hay bells and like just doing all this manual labor
134.28s: and I hated it and I kept asking my dad I was like I don't want to do this for us in my life
140.04s: I'd rather have money you know because this sucks like it was just that blatant and he's like well
146.28s: you know he's a he's a freaking cowboy he doesn't know anything about finance but I had a grandmother
152.20s: who who actually had a San Diego over your base who was into like this guy called Warren Buffett
157.72s: and and my dad's like hey you should go talk to Gramma Ginny because she's in the investing
161.64s: and like knows all this stuff so I talked to her and she got me into the whole like bin
166.28s: gram Warren Buffett thing so I started literally when I was a kid like you know not not five at that
172.28s: time you know but probably like 10 or 12 where I was like oh man this is really cool like you could
177.32s: take money and make more money and I don't have to do any work duh and so I just initially it was
184.28s: purely financially motivated to not be broke and it seemed like finance was like a good way to do
191.40s: that like I can't it's just was that grotesque I just wanted to get rich and then what happened
197.56s: is I went to college and I started you know is that at this fancy undergrad business school
205.96s: and I just started actually liking the topic right like I started getting obsessed with I re
210.04s: like every book everything that I could even get my hands on related to investing and it became
215.48s: like more like an intellectual obsession like obviously I still wanted to get rich in the back of
219.64s: my head but really was just interesting right and then then what happened is I did really well
225.00s: in one of these classes and the professor was like hey you know you should consider doing research
229.64s: which was code word for hey be my data monkey programming bitch and like you know do all the nasty
235.80s: stuff and then I'll put my name on it the looks mark but at the time it sounded great professors
240.52s: asked me to do something and Indian it was great but like then I got my hands dirty and like the
245.80s: deep research like programming data stuff and I was like and I just kept getting more and more
250.04s: interested in it as a topic and then what happened is as all the staff there the professor said hey
257.72s: you know you should consider doing a PhD and I was like great how does that work they're like well
263.48s: apply to this place code University of Chicago I was like great I'll never get in they're like we'll
267.32s: get you in because it's very like close-hold deal and all them were Chicago PhDs so then I got
273.00s: in a PhD program and then you know I spent two years there and then I actually always wanted to
278.84s: do the service but I couldn't get the timing right so then I took a sabbatical to go join the
284.92s: Marines right I was in the 040 yeah 0408 and then I came back to finish my PhD 08 to 10 and I had
293.48s: to kind of like relearn finance obviously and and you know then it was great I was like I'm like
298.36s: already like all in on finance I still wanted to make money but then I got I got a professor job
304.36s: which I don't know if you know much about professor jobs but it's not a real job right your job is
309.32s: to get paid a lot of money to sit around and think about things this is pretty awesome and so that's
314.52s: what I did and then simultaneous to that like way back in the day like this was probably I don't
320.60s: remember 2009 2010 time frame you know I was doing a blog like it used to be blogger blog
326.84s: spot some ghetto Google thing that I don't even have exist anymore and like for whatever reason
332.92s: that this was again like there was like five blogs in the world back then and no one was doing like
337.56s: geeky quant finance oh yeah I said we had I had literally I had a billionaire co-call me and said hey
344.68s: west I've been reading your blog I read your dissertation can we talk it like just dumb luck man from
351.08s: a stupid blog like I'm sure somebody like on your youtube channel might call you up someday that's
356.92s: like that's how what happened and and then I was like oh my god this is my first opportunity
363.08s: to maybe start a business because I finally met a billionaire who's interested in what I have to say
368.60s: and you know one thing led to the next we got seated 2012 of 50 mill and now the rest is history I
375.08s: quit my professor job and then we just built you know our business to not even know what we got now
380.84s: 10 or 11 billion dollars or something I mean so that was my journey now how do you even track it all
386.44s: you know exactly my whole life I was just worried about trying to get one million or like hey
392.84s: well some of please give me 10,000 bucks you know I'm eating ramen noodles here this sucks and then
398.44s: now now we're at a stage where like you know we get a hundred billion or a hundred million a day
403.16s: and I'm like yeah whatever rounding air like it's you know it's crazy that you're how your perspective
408.52s: changes but I'm still close enough to be in broke that I still kind of remember this struggle but
414.84s: but I'm you know I'm kind of getting soft and it's not keep going into more and more AUM you know I
420.76s: got to I got to stay humble and grounded somehow I need to figure that one out so I don't
426.52s: don't worry I'm here to bring the poor did you yeah good yeah yeah make sure we get I got to keep
433.08s: the humble pie going you know I'm gonna get too big for your bridges so first follow question
439.24s: from that is why PhD you obviously had finished the original prerequisites to go yeah essentially
446.20s: start the workforce why do more education instead of another workforce to me like obviously
452.36s: wasn't a monetary thing because I could have just left with the NBA and go made a lot more money
457.48s: for me it was just the challenge and like you know PhD is kind of considered like the pinnacle of
462.68s: what you can do and I just like hey I've already done most of the work let's just bang this out
468.76s: and and that's what I just thought it's just like I just want to try to get the highest you can get
474.04s: in in this world and so that's what I just did that you know and obviously that probably
478.44s: was a better financial decision in the long game because I've said you'd know a lot more you got
483.24s: a lot more credibility but you know it's also a lot easier to like not be a slave student labor
490.44s: force for some professors whether your PhD make a 10 grand a year probably been smart to go make
496.84s: a 150 200 K you know in the short run but the long game I think it's worth it just go for it which
503.16s: is why I did I can't really justify it from a financial perspective makes total sense then the next
509.40s: thing you mentioned that I was actually had a written down as a question because I find it so
513.72s: fascinating one of the things I find interesting about life is that a lot of times there is to your
519.96s: point with your billionaire friend a healthy dose of just pure dumb blind luck that tends to co
526.64s: less with some sort of skill set that has you primed to take advantage of the opportunity so when
533.40s: that billionaire cold called you what was your approach to take advantage of the opportunity because
538.84s: I feel like a lot of people they might see those kinds of opportunities but either get frozen and
544.04s: not do something about it fuck it up and not take advantage of it the right way what did you do yeah
549.72s: so again going back to the luck component so this was this was right after oh eight right so
555.80s: so what happened after oh eight is that everyone got smoked out and no one believed in the unicorn
561.24s: anymore right like all the hedge funds all the fancy stuff got vetted as saying like wait a second
567.72s: all you hedge fund people that were paying all this money to they were supposed to protect my money
573.08s: you actually are down 30% you know at a market is down 50 but you know you're not supposed to be
578.60s: down any percent and and so and then not only that but I don't know you probably don't know this but
584.84s: possessions 910th the law so in those partnerships what happens is during stress you say I want my
590.44s: money and they say you know what just joking we're gonna gate the fund you know for forduce your
596.36s: obligations we can't give you your money and you're like well I want my money and so you you start
601.40s: like 2008 was like a great wake up call to the world that paying too much on fees you know not
608.68s: having to control your money paying too much in taxes is a way of the dodo bird there's got to be a
614.28s: better way so I was coming in right after that were said billionaire basically was tired of dealing
622.12s: with Wall Street and started reading blogs and he finds this idiot called West Gray with his PhD
629.16s: he's innocent enough and he's not like he's not uh he's not poisoned by the culture of Wall Street
636.28s: right he's seen so so he reaches out and he's like listen ma'am I read all your stuff I love your
641.24s: background we need help to transition our families business from these over price hedge funds to
647.80s: transparent scalable low cost like factor or index type strategies and obviously I'm a quant
655.80s: by background and this is all I think about and all I do so so that that luck of just I haven't
661.40s: have that quant skill set and a billionaire guy just got smoked out by all the hedge fund idiots and
667.16s: he's like I want your skill set I mean it was just easy right and and and I was just at the time this
673.40s: is what I always wanted to do is start my own business but as you know in asset management you need
678.28s: a lot of money to start a month start the business because no one wants to invest with someone that
682.12s: has ten bucks it was perfect so it was just I was ready uh going there um so yeah and then I'll
690.12s: give you another one which is does that one I kind of was waiting for I don't question on that one
694.84s: though yeah did you said it was easy did when you started going down that path were you like super
703.80s: confident I know exactly what I'm going to do I know this is how it's going to work out and you
708.84s: executed a plan or was it a kind of building the plan as it's flying kind of scenario uh that one
715.16s: because I've been obsessed with what I was going to do every time I could even think about it
720.28s: in my head I knew exactly what I was going to do but it's more about dragging the client along right so
725.96s: we we actually that was 2010 and actually we didn't get seated till 2012 because the other thing
731.72s: I ran into is is the dad of the family who's not technically control for tax reasons but you know
738.36s: you know dad made all the money he's kind of action control you know they just got out of the
743.08s: seating business they're like you know they're just like we just got smoked by all these hedge funds
747.80s: that we we would give them money and then then we get a piece of their business we're not doing that
752.60s: ever again and so while I was coming in with the exact sort of capabilities they also said we're
758.60s: not seating a new fund operation ever again and so what I said is like listen okay cool give me two
765.32s: years we'll do consulting we'll do work and and if and if we show our you know if we show our
771.16s: value add can you please please beg and plead and and like can we work a deal if we do the right
777.56s: thing to get seated so so it wasn't automatic it took like two years of grinding it out you know
783.72s: showing hundred capabilities and I knew exactly what I wanted to do I wanted to get seated and I
788.76s: wanted to get track records in our strategies as soon as possible but I you can only move as fast as
794.84s: the billionaire is going to move right so all that stuff was premeditated murder and I was just
800.84s: waiting for the opportunity but let me give you another example that that wasn't like that so
807.32s: you know and now where I am right now we're on this massive infrastructure business how the hell
811.72s: does a quant finance PhD end up being a used car salesman for like infrastructure that makes no
818.60s: damn sense and now this business is way bigger than our other business well what happened here is
824.12s: you know and this again just dumb luck like we're doing Alphargetek we're launching our own ETFs
830.76s: and we're you know I'm marine my one of my business partners marine as you know it's all about
835.24s: do more with less we don't need big army we'll go figure out this this stuff on our own and so
840.28s: that culture kind of like was with us so being idiots we said oh we'll just DIY all this ETF
846.84s: infrastructure and you know which obviously looking back was idiotic but at the time you know
851.80s: when you don't know you don't know you just figure it out and so you know we did that for 10 years
857.80s: and then you know five years ago a gal hit us up she's like why don't you guys let other people
863.64s: use your infrastructure because you guys do it so much more efficiently and cheaper than everyone
867.56s: else in the public market it would be really nice if you'd like rent your your your infrastructure
873.16s: to me and we're like we're not going to do that we don't we don't do like monkey work we're just
877.64s: we're portfolio managers and we only do like the good stuff right the rock star job
883.48s: she's like well you guys would be really good at this and anyways long story short we find
887.64s: it said okay fine we'll do it like you know not because we wanted to like who wants to be the
892.28s: garbage man for someone else and and that lucky decision not even planning on being in this business
899.88s: kind of just being nice to a friend that end up being an explosive business opportunity where
907.08s: when we just took our cost center turned it into a business and now everyone in the world wants
913.48s: to start an ETF and everyone in the world wants to do it low cost easy and transparently
918.92s: like we created this monster and I and I was never even close to being in the business plant
925.24s: that is crazy like I would never in a million years have thought about I'd be in this business
929.80s: and now this business like I said makes more money is a bigger business than the asset manager
935.08s: business ever thought of being you know you just these things happen in life well I find they
942.68s: happen but it takes a certain temperament for it to happen right like there's even to your point
947.88s: at first you're resistant to the idea but then you turn around you're like yeah sure we'll give it a
951.64s: shot right even the fact that you me uh that first phone call we had right like you chose to just
957.32s: give me a shot to talk to you I find that people that tend to have that at why not you know what like
962.68s: what's it going to hurt like just give it a shot tend to have interesting results because
967.40s: sooner or later I feel like that's what it takes to start seeing some forward progress now
974.68s: yeah going back to your first fund you talked about this strategy that you built and that
981.48s: essentially you were waiting for a chance to deploy it how did you build that strategy
986.20s: yeah so this is a really long story uh I'll try to make it quick so yeah yeah yeah go way back
995.48s: in the day so just because everyone has their start in their world and that shapes their rest of
1001.48s: their investment experience right so my first real investing was in like 98 99 when there was
1008.04s: an internet bubble which was really weird because there's so much deja vu I get in today's market
1013.24s: where all these tech stocks are going crazy like it's insane and like all the value kind of boring
1019.32s: stuff is like that'll never work they're never going to have a business it was literally the same
1023.32s: story in 98 99 and I just happened to be school I was trained because it was my only training
1030.20s: in Warren Buffett value investing so so obviously when I got started I was like god am I just an
1036.76s: idiot because like I'm not making any money in every of these other idiots gambling on tech stocks
1041.72s: are making thousand or percent a year but because I hadn't had enough time to change my mind I got
1047.96s: lucky because you probably recall like in 99 the Nasdaq triple q went down 80% or whatever it was
1054.76s: maybe it's 90% I came remembers insane and value stocks made money and I was like damn and I was
1062.52s: stock picking I thought I was gonna be Warren Buffett I didn't know what a computer was for
1066.84s: doing this stuff right anyways so I start off as a fundamental funny dutty value investing
1074.04s: you know loser type guy like what most people consider loser so that was that was my original
1079.00s: training and then just over time you know I just got I was interested in scalability making it
1085.24s: easier so naturally you gravitate through like well can we do this with a computer it seems a lot
1089.16s: more efficient and so I had always tried to systemize the value philosophy with a machine because
1096.12s: it's a pain he asked to read 10k's and like call people up it's just annoying and then like in my
1103.00s: grad school during PhD kind of one of the things I kind of proved to myself is that yes a computer
1108.84s: can for all intensive purposes replicate you know 95% of what the people can do anyways and so I
1115.40s: kind of just there's more to this story but I just totally threw stock picking you know with my brain
1121.56s: in the trash can and I just became a quam if it's not if I can't code it up can't put it in the system
1126.84s: with rules I ain't doing it and so and and so I just had cooked these different strategies up
1132.60s: and another interesting story which is another which is a as a bad story in in the end is right
1139.08s: when I got out of service my original tempt is we launched a hedge fund I launched it in september
1146.44s: 08 which is literally the pinnacle exactly perfect timing just bad luck in this case and and so I
1154.04s: launched this damn want value like like systematic value strategy long short in september 08 of course
1161.96s: the first month I launched they say it's basically illegal to short like like they they were
1166.92s: recalling short positions on like Russell 2000 it like like things you would ever think you wouldn't
1171.96s: be able to you could short all the time literally like the interactive brokers are like there's no
1176.44s: short available I'm like well how am I going to run a long short fund yeah yeah if I can't short
1183.32s: and and so I was like well fuck I just started this thing and I can't even implement the very
1188.28s: strategy so then then because of an idiot I talked to the partners I'm like well we can't do that
1193.56s: we go back to stock picking and they're like sure if you think there's and so I did that you know
1198.28s: blah blah blah and then that funded up being a disaster as you can imagine because I did stock
1203.16s: picking it should just been a quomp and then you know an adventure I had this whole convoluted
1208.68s: path right kept I was a value investor fundamental but then I didn't systematic and I had a few
1213.96s: permutations of it and then I wrote a book where it's basically a book about this is how I would go
1219.88s: about computerizing what value investors do it's called quantitative value right and then that
1226.60s: so that book is is the strategy effectively we've obviously tweaked it over time and that's what we
1232.44s: ended up getting seated so so this was like probably a 10 year you know strategy experience development
1238.52s: to finally get there and we still run those strategies to this day but but that that's how I
1244.12s: eventually kind of bob and weave to you know doing this systematic quantitative value thing
1250.52s: I was just obsessed with it talk to me about the focus behind that I think a lot of
1256.20s: thing for traders and I imagine especially going through your background there's got to be a pretty
1261.56s: significant period of time where you're like testing different things coming across new ideas
1265.88s: different approaches but you've kind of stayed centered on your thing value investing slightly
1271.32s: different permutations and whatnot so how did you stay so focused on that and were you testing
1276.84s: other things and you kept coming back to home base or what did that look like?
1280.60s: Yeah so I always just like anybody like human nature is to anchor on what you first see what you
1286.76s: think is good and then once you get anchored on something it's very hard to accept new ideas right
1292.44s: but luckily you know I was trained in the depths of University of Chicago which the culture of that
1299.72s: place is it's an idea like violent idea exchange and like if you post an idea our job is not to tell
1307.32s: you how great your ideas our idea is to tell you how stupid you are and how screwed up it is
1312.68s: which is not exactly a fun culture to be in to be frank but it's a great way to kind of
1318.28s: just be open to new ideas and never think you have a monopoly on what works right but of course
1324.12s: being a human start off as a value picker it works great at the end of 99 and it worked great through
1330.60s: the early 2000s thought I was a genius then I have you know the systematic value book use those
1336.84s: systems all good except you know being an academic and being so exposed to academic research where all
1343.40s: you have there is just PhDs turning data all day to figure out ideas you know I was always aware of
1349.08s: things like trend falling momentum and like gazillions of strategies right it's just I was
1354.84s: resistant because I knew and had confidence and had ego tied to value and then it was only just
1362.04s: I guess actually one that especially that billionaire like with respect to trendfall like if you
1367.48s: would have asked me before 2010 if I thought trend falling was a good idea I had to told your
1372.36s: fucking insane right because trend falling as you can imagine in value investor circles
1378.36s: it's crazy like you're a devil worshipper if you think you're gonna move out a market like he
1384.12s: used to trend like price trends to like like you it's literally insanity it's literally like being a
1389.40s: devil worshipper if you're in the value religion camp and then I had this billionaire guy telling me
1394.84s: like hey man I because he's also interested in our value stuff he's like he's like I've been to a
1399.48s: trendfall for like 30 years man like why don't you do that like it's common secret I'm like well
1404.52s: because professors say it's stupid and you're an idiot he's like well I appreciate you telling me
1409.80s: I'm an idiot even on my billionaire but you know you should investigate it more and so I was like
1414.92s: all right whatever you know he's a client I gotta do it and I started yeah exactly all a piece of
1420.92s: but I know he's gonna be wrong and ensure enough as I dug in I'm like holy shit this is one of
1427.64s: the greatest ideas ever why did all these damn professors shit on this my whole life you know and
1434.04s: then after the fact like the last 20 years has been a lot more research from academics to say oh
1439.00s: wow trend falling works to which most people are like well no shit like we've known that for 50 years
1444.76s: but it's a but it just takes time right so I had to adapt because sometimes you just need a
1450.84s: trigger point to get you to think outside of your own box and that I've been around for so long
1456.20s: I'm open to any idea at some level I just want to make sure is it evidence based is it robust
1461.48s: is it is it grounded in like some sort of financial economics or behavioral issues like it's got to
1467.08s: pass the sniff test but I'm open to a lot of ideas which is why we do value we do momentum we do
1472.60s: trend I do you know anything you name we probably do some element of it now where that wouldn't
1477.32s: have been the case maybe 10 or 15 years ago that means it's honest sense that's actually going to be
1482.12s: one of my follow-up questions because I do find a lot of times there's a really interesting
1487.00s: valley between theoretical application and then actual like in market application of ideas and to
1496.04s: me that's actually one of been one of the the benefits of being a retail trader is you do have the
1502.20s: luxury of looking at something and saying I like this or don't like this throw this out try something
1507.72s: new and I mean you obviously are super smart I know I'm an idiot so I don't trust any my own ideas
1513.24s: I'm not really sent on anything I am very receptive now yeah one of the follow-ups to that though
1520.68s: is when you look across your time in academia compared to like practically interacting with markets
1528.04s: what are some of the largest disparities you see in terms of truths held in academia that does not
1535.40s: cross over into markets yeah so so the good thing about academia is there's not like a financial
1543.32s: incentive per se right it's an idea place but but obviously if you're just an idea place slash
1549.80s: ivory tower you think about ideas but you obviously don't really consider like the practicalities
1555.56s: of these ideas right so I really loved academics because it teaches you how to be like a researcher
1562.12s: and try your best use like the scientific method you know in theory come up with a theory and then
1567.48s: you have you have different hypotheses you use data to test hypotheses to validate it you know blah blah
1572.04s: blah and it doesn't work like that perfectly but at least you don't have the financial incentive
1577.64s: of like selling someone a product or selling someone a back test so they give you money to make money
1582.76s: on right so I like the purity of it but of course that's nice from an ideas generation component but
1589.48s: then we need to also consider to your point well that's great mr ivory tower but you know you
1594.52s: can't do that because you can't short you can't use the margin you can't trade penny stocks with a
1599.08s: billion dollars without moving the stock whatever right so obviously the practitioners are very good
1604.36s: at understanding the nuance of implementation but there's enough the biggest challenge I think
1611.24s: is academia is great because it's basically trained researchers trying to develop new ideas that
1616.28s: go through the fire of peer review and of course they got bias and of course they got issues like
1621.72s: saying trend falling stupid and eventually they'll change their mind which they've done but they
1627.00s: don't they have clean incentives generally practitioners the issue there is they're good at
1631.56s: implementing strategies but they have to deal with other people's money so one of the biggest
1636.60s: economies is retail investors have this amazing advantage of the system that's their money
1643.96s: and they want to maximize presumably their benefits right we're third party managers in the
1650.28s: business of managing money you're now managing money on behalf of someone else and you need to look
1657.48s: good and and how do you look good well in the short run you have benchmarks and so there's massive
1663.56s: constraints on professionals and investors to conform to the status quo because imagine if I have
1670.68s: a strategy it does the following it's underperform seven out of 10 years and it compounds one dollar
1678.36s: to say a hundred dollars but it underperforms seven out of 10 years and I'm managing other people's
1683.00s: money the other strategy basically beats the market call it eight out of 10 years but it ends up
1690.28s: doing one dollar to say ninety five dollars so over 10 year periods actually worse however the path
1697.32s: is a lot more marketable and it's a lot easier to collect more money to charge fees and other
1702.28s: people's money than a strategy that loses seven times out of 10 right so so professionals have this
1708.92s: very constrained thing that they have to deal with which is called other people's money whereas
1714.52s: retail people can literally do whatever the hell they want however retail people can do whatever
1720.92s: the hell they want but now they also suffer a lot of times from behavioral biases over confidence
1726.84s: and all these other problems so there's no there's no right answer it's all about like what are
1731.40s: the incentives what are the behaviors and then that's going to be the best solution for that
1736.12s: particular circumstance and yeah makes a ton of sense and there's a lot of edge in there like
1741.32s: like retail people like you know hey you want to go you want to go do some trend falling strategies
1745.88s: on game stop I think that's a great strategy same thing like crypto like if someone if I
1750.84s: didn't have so much compliance and I could go do like a three-month trend falling strategy and
1754.76s: crypto I'd be doing that all day long I can't there's too much compliance there's too much
1760.28s: everything like no no professional could go gamble on game stop or even do a smart gamble on
1766.68s: game stop because it's too constraining whereas retail if you can click the button in Robin Hood you
1772.84s: can do it every one right so so there's a lot of opportunities to as a retail investor if you can
1778.68s: contain you know your behavioral issues which which is because there's not so many rules on you
1785.24s: sometimes that can actually make you make bad decisions as well so it's all about trying to weigh
1789.24s: those cost benefits yeah you I think did just huge service to analyzing some of the retail
1798.52s: perspective and I think that's super important because I tried to remind retail traders that in general
1803.88s: you are disadvantaged in the marketplace that doesn't mean you're totally disadvantaged and
1808.76s: you're literally hiding some of the key advantages I think most of us may or may not capitalize on so
1815.64s: following that thread a little bit more leaning into the retail perspective and some of the strengths
1821.56s: they have you highlighted some of the weaknesses being behavioral biases if you were a budding retail
1829.24s: trader how would you approach trying to be a successful long-term retail trader yeah so what I
1837.40s: would do is do do weird stuff right like for example like I'll give example like kind of what we do
1844.92s: in the business because we're one of the weird people that that we just do weird stuff because I
1849.96s: originally built strategies because I wanted to do it for my own money frankly even though it's not
1855.08s: like anyone else did it right so generally but let's say we do a signal that we have a lot of
1859.88s: profits and call it factor X let's just say the value factor just because everyone knows kind of
1865.48s: generally what that is and you're a retail trader and you're like all right everyone probably knows
1870.36s: that buying cheap stocks is a good idea over the long haul but what's the institutional other people
1876.84s: money guy going to do they're gonna be like wow God if you buy cheap stocks over like the next 50
1881.64s: years in general you get like three or four percent of the market great that's what they're going to
1886.84s: look at how much money can I make on this damn thing and you can do that because a retail trader can
1892.12s: actually think 20 30 years out and they don't you can't fire yourself the institutional traders can
1897.88s: be like wait a second let's not we got to be careful here because we know value can lose its
1903.56s: ass over many year stretches we can't run like buy the top 10% cheap stocks even though that
1909.96s: algorithm looks amazing well we're gonna do is we're gonna go up by all 500 S&P stocks and do
1915.96s: little tits where it's 99% the same as S&P but we're gonna call it value and carry on in life
1923.16s: because we're just in the marketing business we're not in the investing business where as a retail
1927.48s: person could be like I'm not trying to sell my stuff to other people I did the back test and
1933.72s: just buying the 10% cheapest P E stocks makes 3% more than the market over long horizons and yeah
1941.24s: it underperforms and looks like puke sometimes who cares roger that I'm in like and I'm just
1947.72s: giving out as a simple example I'm not saying it has to be value but anytime you identify strategies
1953.08s: that you know institutional professional investors with puke on you know you're on the right track
1959.08s: and to the extent that they're hard to hold and if you had to show your statement to your mom every
1964.28s: day she'd be like you know what planet do you live on like even though that's not doesn't sound good
1969.48s: that's actually the perfect because that's where all your edges is doing weird stuff that the
1974.60s: institutional guys can't really do and you have horizon you can't fire yourself so any opportunity
1980.52s: that high level is weird and hard to do and looks ugly in the short run is usually a great
1987.16s: strategy and something that we have competitive edge as retail trader effectively it's funny
1993.80s: you say that have you read the book what works on Wall Street by a shionist source yeah yeah it's a
1999.88s: great book it's funny because he talks a lot about the multifactor models and a lot of the components
2004.92s: that you're referencing there which is it's funny because a lot of what I've done on the retail
2010.04s: side is I've kind of built my own data set that I can track various factors and essentially conduct
2016.04s: similar analysis I find it interesting that you and eightly go to kind of long run performance though
2023.00s: is that your typical leaning yes I'll tell you why I've hung around a lot of rich people
2029.48s: and the number one thing that rich people are good at is avoiding fees and avoiding taxes right
2037.24s: it doesn't matter if you're going to try to scoop the markets are extremely competitive in general
2043.40s: and so if you think over any sort of long duration period you're going to be able to
2047.64s: edge out more than a couple percent without taking extraordinary risk you're wrong because it's just
2052.68s: too competitive right however what can you control fees and taxes and what is the destructor and
2061.32s: what is the generator of fees and taxes trading a lot so necessarily you have a huge disadvantage
2068.36s: as a retail investor unless you don't have any money because you're going to have high marginal
2072.60s: tax rates and you're usually going to have high frictional costs compared to like how the cost
2077.24s: for me to trade and so you have to in general if you want to compound and you're not you know it's
2084.92s: just the math right like let's say your your compounding rate is 10 percent well one plus 10 percent
2091.72s: but you got a minus off fee cost minus off tax costs that might be five one plus 0.05 to the 50th
2100.36s: is way lower than say 1.07 to the 50th where let's say you can do a strategy that makes 7 percent
2107.72s: but you can do a low turnover and not have to pay a lot of taxes that's better than something that
2112.52s: makes 10 percent but after fees and taxes you make 5 percent it's just math so so I've just noticed
2119.32s: over the long haul that rich people the reason they're rich is not because of genius investors
2125.00s: frankly they're usually okay or good enough for government work but they're great at avoiding
2129.96s: taxes and they're great at minimizing fees so that that's why I so focus on long duration
2137.80s: when you're an individual because it's the only edge you got interesting yeah I find that
2143.56s: absolutely fascinating because to me I think one of the things retail traders can do to really
2149.24s: amplify returns at least as far as I've attempted to do is right along and try to pace market
2156.20s: as best as possible during up years and then when the market is having draw downs do my very best to
2161.48s: not participate at all and I've found by essentially having a slightly more active approach and then
2167.08s: it sounds like you would lean towards I've found that actually has worked super well for me because
2173.24s: so I don't have too many like crazy knockout of the ballpark years I've had two negative years my
2180.84s: first two I'm both less than 5 percent so there's you just got to solve the fees and taxes problem
2189.08s: so if you can if you can somehow put this in qualified accounts or get like buy real estate to
2194.28s: shield it you just you got to get the tax man off your back or you're never going to be able to
2198.52s: compound at the appropriate rates even with a lot of edge and then as always your your cost
2203.48s: the frictional cost you got managed because you know which I'm sure you do I'm not saying you can't
2208.28s: do this you just want to be very very painfully aware of how do I do this strategy while minimizing
2214.60s: tax hits and fee hits because that that's what that's like the way in fact it'll drag you down into
2219.56s: the mud at some point well and I also think that's one of the things that retail traders in general
2225.08s: they don't really acknowledge because especially with the decline of commissions right I think
2231.24s: real traders still don't understand all of the friction in each of their transactions especially
2236.36s: now that it's essentially hidden and it's behind the payment for order flow and stuff like that
2241.08s: they're not seeing it upfront so the fact the fact that you highlight that and that's been one
2246.44s: of the most common threads across professional traders that I've spoken with I think it's something
2250.76s: that people should really key into even though it's not something you can directly see it's there
2256.12s: yeah so but going to your point like you're basically outlining a trend falling strategy
2261.32s: trend falling is actually the ultimate strategy that institutions and professionals will generally
2267.72s: avoid because as you probably know like most trend strategies over the long haul give you the same
2272.44s: performance with half the drawdown just generic quick the problem is you get whips on a lot
2278.84s: which is not a big deal like if you're a trend follower that's trend falling you're going to lose
2282.76s: price six or seven out of ten but that's not the point the point is I participate most of the time
2287.88s: and win and I avoid the big drawdown but can you imagine and unfortunately I've lived this but you
2293.88s: could imagine being a professional managing other people's money and you're trend falling and like
2299.64s: the market goes rip in and you're flat you know like you need a full cycle to actually see if it's
2305.08s: actually working for you and it's just that's a strategy just generically that fits in that mold
2309.88s: of extremely painful to do and it looks weird in the short run and that and most professionals
2316.76s: just can't do it so I I mean I think that's a retail haven you now you just got to manage the taxes
2322.36s: and the fees and you got a home ding it I'm all in on that that's a great idea yeah it well and
2329.00s: it's funny too because I primarily trade derivatives so you can add leverage to some of it and
2334.28s: you know be a real generate out there but that's you know that that's have the fun is I pretty much
2339.56s: have to report to my board member which is my dog sitting right here and he does it exactly
2344.28s: yeah yeah I love it and you and you can do smart things just because you want to do them you're not
2350.84s: you don't got boards constituencies you're not trying to impress somebody so retail individuals
2357.72s: like I retail is kind of got like a negative connotation what I would say is direct capital owners
2365.08s: because you can be retail and have ten bucks or you can be retail and have a billion bucks like I
2369.72s: know guys that have billion dollars they don't have any advisors they just trade their money and
2375.96s: you know they're retail it's it's really just are you do you care about maximizing your own wealth
2381.80s: and managing your own behavioral issues or are you managing other people's money
2386.68s: which means you got a whole another set of incentives and then just those different groups have
2390.76s: different ways of going about it but retail is not necessarily bad or good it's just a different
2395.48s: incentive structure they are you're dealing with which has advantages and disadvantages
2400.76s: yep I think that makes a lot of sense and I'm glad that you brought up the behavioral thing as well
2405.56s: because it's something that I refer people a lot I actually try to get people on SSRN as much as
2409.48s: humanly possible and put them in front of different kind of studies like one of my favorites is the
2413.72s: behavior of individual investors by Lee and Odin Barbara Lee and Odin and it talks about a lot
2420.04s: of retail trader tendencies because to your point I think the autonomy is good but it's almost like
2424.20s: when you give some people too much autonomy they don't know to do with it and then they try a
2427.88s: strategy for two weeks it's a good path so now they think they have a crack then there's bad path
2432.92s: and now they abandon it and so on and so forth so it's that's actually something I'd love to follow
2437.96s: up with you on sometime a little bit more about regulating more of the behavioral side of trading
2443.40s: for retail investors I think that would be super super fun but we are at time less and I am committed
2449.80s: to getting you out of here on time to enjoy the rest of your day I genuinely value you come in
2454.92s: to hang out for a little bit obviously I feel at a media since a chroma camaraderie with you so
2460.12s: thanks for kicking it for a little bit if people want to get a hold of you or do you want them to
2464.92s: hop over to your Twitter page or X or whatever I'm supposed to call it or say yeah yeah I still
2470.52s: call it Twitter too yeah I'm just Alpharctic on Twitter I'll throw a link in yeah and just
2476.36s: you know our websites Alpharctic we post blog posts and do all kinds of research ideas that you
2481.80s: could try to actually implement a lot like we're always posting new ideas we don't do them all
2486.92s: I'm sure some of these blogs you know if someone had the time they could code it up and start trading
2491.80s: on it probably makes them money so yeah I appreciate what you're doing too like it's very important
2497.56s: that retail and individual investors just get it straight and don't aren't get don't get told
2504.76s: that like money grows on trees it's so easy you know that's just the worst situation and getting
2511.00s: rich quick is never going to happen reliably so so people like you then kind of like say hey
2517.00s: you got to be honest with it do the right thing work hard all that you know I think that's a very
2521.80s: important message for the investing public yeah I appreciate that I always think of it as the like
2526.68s: the traders paradox because pretty much all traders I know we start trading in the attempt to make
2532.04s: money fast and this is one of the worst possible places to try to do it it's literally a paradox
2539.08s: it's the funniest thing and the best part about it is everybody that I meet that's super successful
2544.20s: in the business they're all super fucking hard working go figure so yeah that's how it works man
2552.60s: that seems to be the case in in every business like if it was so easy everyone would do it and
2557.00s: everyone would get rich but unfortunately to make money you can always get lucky but in general
2564.04s: you just got a work hard and add value and you know it's just unfortunately part of the deal
2570.92s: that's it man head down get to work everybody so thanks for hanging out to the end and we'll see you
2576.04s: guys on the next one
