0.00s: What's up everyone?
1.56s: Quick market update.
2.80s: I am going to talk about GME in just a second.
5.92s: I want to talk about a couple other broad market things
8.56s: really fast, specifically.
11.64s: If we take a look at CPI, it came in pretty light today.
16.32s: So this starts to become interesting as we move forward
20.40s: because the market immediately took this to mean
23.60s: that we are going to be moving into a period of rate cuts.
29.40s: That's exactly what the market shifted today.
32.84s: Because you could tell large caps came down SPX,
36.80s: then if we take a look at the Russell,
39.04s: that blew off the handle to the upside.
42.56s: It had one of its biggest gaps and days,
45.96s: year to date for sure, and in the near term.
49.52s: So the market is starting to pivot a little bit here,
53.80s: and I just think it's important for people to be aware of that.
57.16s: We also saw bonds see a bit of an update here as well,
61.80s: as a lot of folks know I have positions
64.68s: in a lot of the different indices themselves, even TLT,
68.12s: had a pretty significant gap up here.
70.88s: So from a broader perspective outside of the individual product
75.88s: that I typically talk about on the updates here,
78.48s: I do want to let everybody to know that this is happening.
81.80s: And this will trickle down to the sectors
84.36s: and it offers a ton of trading opportunities.
88.28s: So just for general consumption.
90.60s: Now let's get back to what most people
94.20s: are more interested in hearing about which is GameStop.
96.68s: And today unfortunately, it was kind of a quiet day.
99.40s: Actually, the reason why I'm making this video
101.00s: is because I'm trying to maintain the cadence
103.64s: so that we essentially have an archive day by day
107.64s: of what happened in this thing.
109.60s: So what did I notice today?
110.96s: Well, a couple things.
111.92s: The first thing is we did crack 25.
114.28s: There were a lot of people talking about how they felt
117.80s: the algos just wouldn't allow above 25.
122.00s: I honestly don't want to touch that
123.56s: because I can see the perspective that people have with that
127.20s: and the potential manipulation.
128.92s: But I really want to stick to the things
131.16s: that I can decisively prove.
133.04s: And what I can decisively prove here is this is above 25.
137.60s: So it did break above there, which is cool to see.
140.52s: The other thing I noticed here is we are still
143.04s: on this scent.
144.64s: What I mean by that is we're seeing slight drift
148.20s: on each of these days, right?
150.88s: So if we go back to the term low of one July,
156.32s: that was where we hovered right on this, what is this?
159.60s: The 50.
161.00s: And we've been slowly drifting back up
163.20s: towards the point of control.
164.56s: And that's kind of where we're hanging out.
166.32s: Now in terms of volume today, it was light,
169.68s: not supremely strong volume,
173.24s: but there was a lot more by volume.
176.80s: As you can see right behind my head there,
179.04s: this was yesterday.
181.04s: And then this is today, obviously.
184.16s: Yesterday was vast majority sale volume.
186.84s: Today it's almost even split, it's like 50.50.
189.40s: It's 45 by volume, 55 sale volume.
192.60s: So that is kind of telling to me again,
194.68s: like I go back to this thing where I feel like
199.28s: even though the vast majority of people
203.16s: that are shorting this stock would love nothing more
206.40s: than to push this way back down to sub 10.
210.00s: And again, I try to talk about things that I can prove
212.88s: and from a short seller's perspective
215.48s: that's advantageous to their position.
217.00s: They would want that.
218.36s: So the fact that it's not being pushed down there,
222.12s: even on this really light by volume,
225.44s: again, it's kind of telling to me,
226.92s: it looks like we are building in a little bit of a floor.
230.44s: Now a floor can fall out at any point for any reason,
233.64s: but the fact that it's been drifting in here
236.68s: tells me that there is at least some semblance of strength
239.04s: in the stock from a price perspective
242.08s: because otherwise with such light buying volume,
245.72s: if there was heavy selling,
247.84s: there would be nothing to support it here,
249.68s: but the fact of the matter is that's not happening.
252.12s: So that's been really interesting to keep an eyeball on.
256.16s: Pivoting over now to the options, a couple things.
259.68s: Volume today, cratered.
262.56s: Yesterday this was over 300,000.
266.08s: And today it's now sub 200,000.
269.36s: So it's back down to a pretty low point.
272.12s: And when I look at what we're seeing most of the volume,
274.68s: again, we're starting to see more exposure
277.44s: to other expiration cycles.
279.76s: I see exposure to the 12 July's, which is the purple,
283.20s: 19 July's, which is the blue.
285.40s: And then the 26 July, which is kind of like this pinkish red,
289.40s: whatever this color is, I'm not good with colors,
291.32s: but whatever this is, that one.
293.76s: So we're still very, very centralized
296.64s: in the front explorations, right?
298.20s: That's the next three in the cycle.
300.00s: So if we take a look at the OI by these cycles
304.56s: and we take a look first at 12 July,
307.44s: there is 157,000 that are coming down tomorrow.
311.04s: There's 325,000 in 19 July,
314.72s: which is pretty massive.
316.64s: And then in 26 July, we're just starting to build out.
320.44s: This is now at 58,000.
322.32s: So again, as per usual,
324.12s: all of the activities in these front two explorations,
326.24s: that is without a doubt.
328.12s: Now, a couple of things did stick out to me here.
331.80s: The very first one is going back to volume.
334.36s: If we take a look at this,
336.48s: this is the 19 July 30s.
339.56s: They're active again.
341.48s: They're very active.
342.68s: We saw activity in these 30s not that long ago,
346.80s: and they're definitely being transacted at again.
349.08s: So if we pop in,
350.36s: there's over 20,000 transactions there.
353.40s: So if we come out here to the 30s,
355.68s: right now the OI was 59,000.
359.60s: Now it's up to 20,500.
361.28s: That's a big, big change.
363.76s: So it's hard to say, right?
368.24s: Because this is really big volume for this,
372.72s: and it's eight days out.
374.40s: I sometimes you feel like I talk into the wind
377.36s: when I'm trying to help people think about buying options
380.72s: slightly differently.
382.32s: This isn't a terrible trade if you're expecting big upside,
386.40s: but it kind of just feels like people are going back
388.60s: into the abusive relationship,
390.72s: where it's not necessarily changing
392.80s: in the shortest timeframe that we might want.
395.24s: And it's taken a little longer,
397.36s: and these people are just getting chewed up.
399.92s: Because here's the deal, 26 Delta is not bad,
402.88s: but take a look at the price of these options.
405.20s: It's essentially 79.5 cents.
408.24s: On a daily basis, they're losing 11 to 12 cents.
412.56s: So let's take a look at that on a percentage basis,
416.12s: 11 cents on something that's 79 cents,
419.16s: 79.5 I guess, 0.795.
422.96s: It is 13.8% of the option premium
427.08s: that's decaying each day.
429.32s: It's just a lot.
430.96s: Again, I have no problem adding kicker options
433.40s: or something where I think that there's going to be
434.96s: some sort of big move,
435.96s: but this is just, it's tough to make money this way.
439.04s: So as you can tell, it always pains me.
441.76s: If we were getting a lot of like really big upside,
444.44s: or if this is a really small subset of people's positions,
447.44s: I would feel differently.
448.96s: But again, I can tell it's not,
451.20s: because if I look at the open interest
453.12s: across these different explorations,
455.28s: it's all in these super short-term options.
458.20s: If I go out here to 16 August,
459.96s: which still isn't that far out, 36 days,
462.68s: that's only at 140,000.
464.84s: And I think I've already told you guys,
466.16s: but I'm out here in the 20 September
468.52s: with like 10 other homies.
470.24s: So I have much further expiration exposure,
474.92s: and it's for a bunch of different reasons.
476.12s: I'll link to that same video I've shared a bunch of times
478.04s: so far on how to think about buying call options.
480.52s: Let's try to help some folks.
482.04s: Now, when I look at the disposition of the transactions today,
486.68s: call side was definitely sale heavy,
489.60s: but only by three points, right?
491.36s: So 32% transacted at the bit or below.
494.08s: And then on the put side,
495.52s: the vast majority here was buys.
497.80s: So 26% was selling puts, 34% buying puts.
501.56s: So definitely some heavy, heavy buying activity
504.68s: on the put side, which obviously would favor
507.20s: the downside a little bit.
509.08s: Another important thing I'm noticing here,
511.08s: take a look at the difference between the call and put ally.
517.24s: We're starting to get very close to one another.
519.64s: Not one to one yet,
522.08s: but and we still have definitely a call skew,
524.64s: but this is getting tighter and tighter
526.08s: than what it used to be.
526.92s: This used to be easy, two times, three times,
529.72s: four times what we saw on the put side,
532.60s: not so much anymore.
534.60s: Right now we have 900,000 calls to 500,000 puts.
538.32s: So that gap is closing.
539.60s: More people are transacting on the put side.
541.92s: And you can tell another thing that's really interesting
544.04s: in terms of where we're centralized on the put side.
547.28s: It's kind of all over the place, right?
549.00s: So we have the 19 July's, we have, what is this one?
553.16s: The 17 Jan 25,
555.08s: so people hedging long term positions, 16 August 24,
559.20s: I don't know what this one is, let's see.
561.56s: 18 August 24, so the point is these guys
564.36s: are all over the place.
565.96s: Where still the vast majority of the li
569.84s: on the call side is in the shorter term,
572.08s: explorations, again, the 12 July's, the 19 July's.
575.64s: There are some spikes that we can see here,
578.12s: like the 16 logs, as well as this one,
582.48s: which again is the 17 Jan 25's,
584.44s: but those are more the exception than the rule.
587.04s: So the last thing I want to take a look at
589.08s: is from the volume today.
591.60s: We did see again, a lot of transactions here
594.60s: at the 19 July 24, 30's.
597.12s: So I wanted to take a look at them and see what's going on.
600.72s: There are an interesting number of trades,
605.04s: but all of these essentially that transacted
608.00s: on what I would assume to be the buy side,
611.76s: especially these ones also that are coming in at the mid,
614.60s: like this one, right?
616.12s: It was bid at 71, offered at 75,
620.28s: so they flag it white as in coming in towards the mid,
624.20s: but it's almost certainly a buy.
627.68s: It's right by the offer.
630.04s: So I would assume that these are a purchase.
633.40s: Same thing with these, right?
634.80s: Bid at 72, offered at 75, came in at 74.
637.80s: I would also classify these as a buy.
640.48s: It's much closer to the offer than the bid.
643.88s: So when I look at kind of these series of purchase transactions,
647.64s: this actually isn't a small total position,
650.16s: but I also am not convinced that it's the same person,
653.76s: necessarily, because there's kind of a enough space
658.00s: between all of these transactions.
660.20s: So all I'm saying is it's inconclusive.
662.04s: You can't tell it absolutely can be the same person,
664.84s: but this also could be other people.
667.44s: That part is kind of hard to tell from this.
670.32s: Overall though, some decent size coming into these, right?
674.20s: Like these cumulatively equal up a pretty decent size position.
679.12s: So it's something to keep an eye on
681.16s: as we're moving into specifically the 19 July,
683.88s: but you can tell that this is becoming
686.92s: the way more interesting expiration, right?
688.80s: Like a lot of people were betting on some big activity here
691.40s: at the 12th of July, and it still may happen, right?
693.48s: Today's the 11th thing.
694.88s: We could see it on the 12th.
697.20s: Just right now, it's not leaning that way
699.72s: as far as we can tell.
702.12s: So what it's going to look like,
703.72s: at least as far as I can see so far,
707.08s: there are a lot of options with medium,
712.36s: oh, I, it's definitely not heavy.
713.88s: Oh, I for GameStop, right?
715.80s: Like as I look at this, the biggest is 16,000,
718.48s: which just isn't that much and people have been going out
720.80s: to these really far explorations for a while now.
722.88s: We did get a net change, which is actually kind of crazy to me.
725.92s: Yesterday I have positive 554.
727.68s: This could be locating.
729.36s: That wouldn't surprise me, but at this point,
733.68s: there's also a lot of single transactions in here,
736.12s: which again, to me, looks like a lot of lot of buying
738.76s: and hoping, which is a tough way again,
740.96s: to make money in markets.
742.72s: So the 12 July is kind of starting to slow down.
745.48s: It looks like, although we still see heavy activity here
748.56s: at the 26th, 14,788 volume against 11,000.
753.24s: So there's people opening positions there.
754.68s: That's definitive.
755.52s: There's no doubt about it.
757.24s: But the question is, do we get a big pull through move tomorrow?
761.64s: So if we look at this from an options pricing
764.04s: as a probability tool standpoint,
766.04s: we can come up with some ideas here.
767.96s: So if we go to this probability analysis,
771.28s: we can see what this might look like for tomorrow.
774.44s: And we can see what the probability of touching
776.12s: some of these different prices are.
777.44s: So if we take a look at the 12th,
780.52s: the probability of touching 2334
785.44s: is about 16% chance.
788.08s: And then 2777 is about 16.
790.68s: This is a one-standard deviation coin, by the way.
792.92s: So that's why they're both at 16%.
794.52s: But it just gives you an idea of range.
796.20s: Tomorrow it's a 16% chance of touching 27%,
798.72s: 16% chance of getting down to like 23 and a half.
804.04s: So not a giant range.
807.72s: Now the interesting part though is that if this does start
809.68s: drifting up towards this 27 handle,
813.12s: these 26s fall in the money.
815.36s: There's some, oh, I, not a ton.
819.48s: So I don't see this serving as some sort of massive gamma ramp,
823.48s: although I absolutely would expect
825.84s: to see some hedging activity coming into expiration
828.80s: if these do fall in the money.
830.08s: So it can get interesting,
832.08s: but this doesn't look like it would be the impetus
834.80s: for a massive, massive squeeze,
837.96s: whether it's a gamma squeeze, short squeeze either or,
841.76s: I don't really see that being the trigger here.
844.16s: You kind of need like really heavy, oh, I,
847.76s: and especially if it's stacked, right?
850.04s: So in this case, it's light across the entire expiration cycle.
854.08s: So we'll see who knows?
856.32s: You never know.
857.16s: That's the fun part with GameStop.
858.64s: It's kind of like watching heavy weights fight.
861.20s: They always have a puncher's chance.
863.04s: So because they have the power to put somebody to sleep,
865.28s: they can lose five rounds and then in the fifth round,
868.40s: essentially knocks somebody cold.
869.68s: So that could be the case here, but so far,
873.32s: it's looking relatively quiet
874.68s: until we see a little bit more of a catalyst.
877.68s: Interesting that price was not pushed down,
879.72s: but we will see how we follow through tomorrow.
882.36s: Obviously, I'm here keeping an eye on it.
884.04s: So any questions, let me know, be an outlier.
886.16s: See you guys later.
