0.00s: I've been trading for 16 years.
1.84s: That means I have made a ton of mistakes over my trading career.
7.08s: The goal of this video is to walk you through 14 of these.
11.16s: And there's a specific thing I want you to keep in mind during the video,
14.64s: which is how many of these honestly do you identify with?
19.40s: I'm curious for two reasons.
20.96s: The first one is I'm curious how well people can objectively evaluate their own performance.
26.40s: But then the second thing is I'm curious how far along you are in your trading journey.
32.28s: And how many of these things you've seen because the goal of the video is to walk you through
37.60s: how you can overcome each of these mistakes.
40.96s: What's up everybody?
41.88s: Eric here.
42.36s: Welcome back to the outliers.
43.48s: Shout out to the Patreon family.
44.88s: Consider signing up.
45.88s: Let's get right to it.
46.88s: We have the first five right here.
49.16s: And logically, we'll start with number one.
51.64s: Trading has a deceptively low barrier to entry.
57.08s: So I use the example of a martial artist, of a surfer, something that's a skilled behavior,
62.40s: a welder, whatever.
63.76s: The punchline is when you see somebody that's really good at what they do, they make it look easy.
70.16s: Meanwhile, when you first start doing that thing yourself, not really realize how hard it is.
76.68s: It's called a skill gap.
78.36s: It's when you falsely perceive the difference between where somebody who's really good at it
83.24s: is and where you are.
84.80s: The reason why this is such a problem in trading is because anybody can start trading.
90.12s: All you have to do is open up a brokerage account.
92.04s: And then obviously if you look at any social media, apparently everybody's always making
96.56s: boatloads of money somehow magically.
100.20s: And it's really defining your mental approach to the markets, which is a giant problem.
106.68s: The markets are difficult.
108.16s: The people that are really good at this stuff make it look easy.
111.36s: It's not.
112.36s: It takes time to pick it up.
113.80s: I like to use the analogy of if you are going to climb Mount Everest, you have to acknowledge
119.64s: the mountain itself.
121.28s: It's the same thing in trading.
122.44s: If you want to be a successful trader long term, you got to get ready to climb that mountain.
126.16s: Number two, most people I know, myself included, when it comes to trading, we have a just
131.96s: haphazard approach.
133.92s: What this means is think about this.
135.60s: If you learned anything in school, how did that process go?
139.00s: You go in the first day, you get an outline of some sort of syllabus.
142.72s: Then on that syllabus, you're going to see all the different topics you're going to learn
145.96s: that are in a logical order.
147.52s: There's going to be some sort of homework associated projects tests, all of which culminate
152.08s: in a grade that evaluates your proficiency on mastering that topic.
156.52s: That doesn't happen in trading.
157.76s: You just start trading.
159.12s: And the problem with that is most people do kind of shoddy homework.
163.00s: Most people aren't testing themselves objectively.
166.00s: The issue you run into this is you kind of a really skewed perception and a really poor
170.60s: learning path with one of the most complex systems I can think of.
175.00s: An algebraic equation has a defined answer.
177.48s: A lot of stuff in the stock market is working with imperfect information, risking capital.
183.04s: So the note here is when you decide to start learning to trade, create a learning path
189.00s: for yourself.
190.00s: One of the things I recommend for option traders is to pick up a copy of options as a strategic
194.76s: investor.
195.76s: I'm not affiliated with Lawrence McMillan at all.
198.00s: Larry's a great dude, but he wrote a great home about options trading that serves as that
204.16s: structure source for you.
206.72s: Next one.
207.72s: Kind of ready hit on this.
208.96s: Markets are multivariate, essentially innumerable.
211.68s: You can't even count all of the inputs that the stock market has.
215.04s: This is just a Russell 2000.
216.44s: And if you think about it, each one of these as an individual company trying to do its business
221.12s: with all of its own little details associated with it.
223.96s: And there's interdependencies between them.
225.92s: And it just grows out to this massive, quite literally, global scale.
230.64s: There's a lot going on here.
231.92s: So the idea that you're going to just somehow bounce around picking up the right things magically
237.68s: and memorize it all because most people don't have a trading plan or a trading log is
243.16s: wild.
244.76s: Just as if you go to school, you have a notebook that you take notes in.
248.24s: You need something to take notes in whether you build out that trading plan to serve that
252.88s: purpose or to brainstorm ideas.
255.08s: You need to write your thoughts down.
256.60s: Otherwise, you're going to be all over the place.
258.64s: The next one here is completely perverting how we actually make money in the stock market.
265.00s: I call them money making mechanisms.
267.64s: And if you think about asking a trader, how do you make money in the stock market?
270.84s: A lot of them say like, oh, I day trade.
273.00s: Well, you can day trade and lose money.
275.60s: So no, that doesn't inherently make money.
278.68s: What makes money?
280.44s: Things like being good at trading directionally, whether it's up or down, being good at trading
287.68s: volatility, being good at picking good strong stocks that receive dividends or being good
293.92s: at picking companies that appreciate in value over time.
297.96s: It's kind of like trading direction, but on a longer time frame.
301.68s: The point being is it's really important to decouple the actual forces that make money
306.64s: versus the way you attempt to capture those forces via what products, whether you trade
311.20s: options, equities, if you trade bonds or your methodology, whether you're a day trader,
316.24s: swing trader, options trader, futures trader, yada, yada, yada, learn what makes money,
321.24s: then find ways to capitalize on that.
324.68s: Next up, this is a really hard pill to swallow for people.
328.52s: I started with a small account myself back in 2007.
331.84s: And right now I did a study and while I looked up the data in this scenario, and the average
336.28s: Robinhood account is $3,000.
338.52s: Very small account.
339.52s: The problem here is that if you're trying to trade with a $3,000 account, you are making
343.84s: a ton of concessions right out of the gate.
346.24s: You can't even sell naked options on a bunch of things because you don't have enough money.
350.00s: You don't have things like portfolio margin.
352.08s: You're also going to be flagged as a day trader.
355.04s: All of these different things lead you into this box that really forces you to trade certain
360.32s: structures that they might be all you have access to.
365.00s: Just because you have access to it doesn't mean it's optimal.
369.96s: You have to understand that.
372.32s: Rarely is a vertical spread optimal in any sense.
376.72s: There are times where it might be applicable, but if you have to trade verticals because
380.28s: you're a count of small finds, so be it that is what it is.
383.20s: But don't delude yourself into thinking that this is a good strategy that you're really
388.12s: able to scale over time.
389.64s: What you'll find is most experienced traders move away from verticals as soon as humanly
393.76s: possible, specifically when we're talking about options.
397.16s: Next grouping.
398.16s: When I see new traders, this is a common misconception.
402.32s: Here we have this trader that is successful.
405.12s: After 13 months of trading, and they just want to acknowledge their dedication and hardship.
412.48s: Dog, you've been trading for 13.
414.16s: You haven't even started trading yet.
416.12s: You literally, this is the infancy of trading.
419.68s: And what I mean by this is, let's take a look at this example down here.
422.64s: It's kind of blurry because it's squished down, but here's the punch line.
426.72s: If you take a look at this and you see that the last bear market right here was in 2009.
432.56s: And if you started trading after that, you didn't see another bear market for 11 years.
439.68s: 11 years.
440.92s: There's this reality about path.
444.36s: Path is how something moves from point A to B. We know equities tend to exhibit positive
450.64s: drift where they go up over time.
452.56s: But if you'll notice this chart of SPX over 10 years, there's periods where it goes down.
456.80s: And if you're trading something like this over here, T triple cues, I forget what time
460.64s: frame I tested this in.
462.52s: But in whatever this non-descript time frame was, it returned 39.5%.
466.88s: However, the path it took to get that 39.5% compound annual growth rate included a 79%
476.28s: drawdown on your capital.
478.28s: So if you see something that looks really, really good and you don't acknowledge the path
483.16s: it might take to get there, there's a good chance that path is going to slap you in
487.28s: the face and shake you out of what you're doing.
492.48s: The other thing is you cannot accept small samples in anything that you're doing.
497.52s: If you're a trader, you should be back testing, forward testing, live testing.
501.80s: Those are not negotiables in my opinion.
503.84s: And if you think that you've got this figured out after 13 months, meanwhile, you could have
507.92s: traded for 11 years and not seen a market condition, a bear market, that's a giant problem.
514.76s: And it's nobody's fault if you don't get a chance to see a bear market over 11 years.
519.12s: It's just a timing thing, but that is a relic of the environment that we operate within
523.80s: and you have to acknowledge the shortfalls that this person, even if they had traded for
527.68s: eight years, they might have blown up their account trading the first bear market they've
532.40s: ever seen because they reacted in a way that they didn't know because they've never seen
537.20s: this before.
538.28s: That happens all the time.
540.20s: Next up, Dunn and Kruger effect is kind of a contributing factor to what I consider
544.40s: to be the largest percent drawdown of my account that happened actually after several
549.20s: years of trading for me.
550.68s: And it's kind of like a learning curve where on the x-axis, we have your proficiency.
554.88s: And on the y-axis, you have your confidence how well you rate yourself at whatever this
560.52s: skill set is.
561.52s: And you kind of start at a healthy spot.
563.16s: You have no understanding and you know you know nothing.
565.32s: This is perfect.
566.32s: Then you start trading for a little while.
568.24s: You've been doing it for five years now.
569.88s: So even though you started right in this middle where we never even saw a bear market,
574.44s: you really feel like you know what's going on.
576.40s: You got your feet underneath.
577.40s: You know it all at this point.
578.40s: And you know most of it.
579.56s: And then all of a sudden risk reveals itself in some way.
583.56s: And then you kind of identify like, oh shit, I don't even know what I don't know yet.
586.92s: This is dangerous.
588.12s: This is where most of my audience comes into my world because I don't deal with these
593.64s: people too much because they're, you can't talk to them because they're too bright
597.68s: I'd bushy tailed they haven't seen enough yet.
599.68s: But these are the people that are like, okay, this is kind of serious.
602.92s: I think I can figure it out.
604.52s: But I know I have a long way to go.
606.92s: And then this is where the sustainable growth of the skill set occurs over time.
612.24s: But just know if you've been trading for anything less than five years, you don't know it
616.24s: yet.
617.24s: You're figuring it out.
618.24s: Hopefully you're crushing it.
619.24s: But don't get ahead of yourself because that's where mistakes happen.
622.84s: It's where my largest mistake happened.
624.60s: Next.
625.60s: This is a common disposition I see traders were they'll look at something and they'll
629.96s: try to see like, oh, you know, could this work?
632.68s: Could this be a good spot for my money?
634.80s: And what I try to recommend to people, at least the way I look at things, when I'm looking
638.16s: at trades, I'm looking for reasons to say no.
640.68s: I'm not looking for reasons to say yes.
643.52s: This is a key differentiator between how I look at markets and other people.
648.12s: I'm looking for the best possible place to put my money, not what could conceivably work.
655.48s: And you'll see kind of an example about this in a few minutes.
658.36s: The last thing here is a really great saying, I love this.
661.64s: It's strong convictions loosely held.
663.96s: This means you go through a lot of effort to build a conviction in something that's based
668.52s: on a lot of research.
670.12s: But you're receptive to new information.
672.72s: You are willing to abandon your position as soon as you receive information that leads
677.96s: you to do so, which means you are not getting entrenched in your argument.
682.76s: This is so common because human nature is prone to getting entrenched in our position.
688.68s: And that really doesn't benefit you in trading.
690.80s: You have to be willing to bounce around.
692.80s: Then we also have this kind of world where traders really forego taking responsibility.
699.16s: This is where you see things like Yolo traders or Lotto traders.
703.00s: If it's a lot of you're supposed to lose the trade.
705.04s: So if you lose it, who cares?
706.64s: That's just completely absolving yourself of ownership of that trade.
712.08s: It's okay to speculate.
713.08s: Speculate.
714.08s: It's okay to take highly speculative trades.
715.72s: Don't give yourself an out.
717.44s: If you speculate and lose, you didn't want to lose.
720.52s: You messed up somewhere.
721.92s: You weren't supposed to lose, otherwise you wouldn't put the damn trade on.
725.16s: So you got to abolish this kind of mindset from your approach in its entirety.
730.16s: Okay, the last group here.
732.00s: Be a trader.
734.16s: This one is really simple in my opinion.
737.32s: Traders all the time classify themselves.
738.96s: I'm a day trader, options trader, yada, yada, yada.
741.28s: So punchline, be a trader.
743.00s: Be whatever trader makes sense for what you're doing.
746.88s: Sometimes I'm a bullish trader.
748.92s: Sometimes I'm a bearish trader.
750.20s: Sometimes I trade options.
751.32s: Sometimes I trade equities.
752.64s: I trade whatever makes sense.
755.40s: Don't get wrapped up into identifying as a type of trader.
759.68s: Just be a damn trader.
761.24s: Next, these are four losing habits and you've got to read the study.
766.40s: It's called the behavior of individual investors.
768.24s: I cited all of the time.
770.24s: There's a couple of things you have to be aware of.
772.60s: Things like the disposition effect, things like naive reinforcement.
777.36s: These are your peers.
778.76s: These are, this is what's happening to all of the other swaths of traders.
782.16s: So if you want to be successful, it's important to look at what successful people do.
786.36s: It's also important to look at what unsuccessful people do and don't do that.
789.84s: So for example, disposition effect.
791.84s: When we cut winning trades too short and we let winners run, don't do that.
796.52s: naive reinforcement.
797.52s: This is where we focus on good experiences and try to block out the bad ones because
802.76s: your ego doesn't like that.
804.08s: Don't do that.
805.08s: Face the fucking music.
806.76s: Next, this is a really interesting thought process and I'm not sure a lot of people consider
811.60s: this.
812.60s: There are multiple ways to beat the market.
814.40s: You don't have to beat the top line performance every single year to outperform the market.
819.32s: I haven't done that, but I have outperformed the market almost by two times plus over the
824.80s: last 16 years.
826.16s: And it's by thinking through return path.
829.64s: So for example, portfolio one over here, it has a 7.4% average return.
834.52s: Portfolio three has an 8.6% average return.
837.40s: Portfolio three has a better return.
839.20s: However, portfolio one made more money.
841.80s: 142,000 versus 139.
843.80s: How?
844.80s: It had a 1.4% worse return.
846.88s: It's because it didn't have any big drawdowns.
848.88s: Didn't have any crazy great years.
850.40s: The best year was 10%.
851.76s: So worst positive year on this side was 12%.
855.76s: But this 125% drawdown was all the difference.
859.32s: So think about the different ways you can outperform the market.
861.84s: It doesn't all have to be to the top line.
864.36s: Next, you have to abolish your normal thought patterns.
867.16s: This bargain buying thing where if you wanted to buy deodorant, yeah, buy that on sale,
871.48s: makes total sense.
872.48s: As a consumer, you're taught to bargain hunt.
874.96s: That's actually why marketing is so smart and everything is on sale all the time.
880.16s: The value of something's whatever the value is.
882.24s: But those are just marketing employees because everybody knows that's how you're wired
885.32s: to think about things where if it's on sale, then you should buy it because you're getting
888.52s: a good deal and that's part of your experience.
890.88s: It's all bullshit.
891.88s: But in the markets, it really doesn't work well because for example, in Nvidia, if you
896.48s: were waiting for a pullback because it's up too high and you wanted it on sale, guess
900.44s: what?
901.44s: You're still sitting on the sidelines.
902.76s: Then if it inadvertently has a big pullback, you're like, oh, wow, this is great.
907.16s: I want to get in here.
908.40s: There's a reason why it's dropping at that point.
910.68s: Maybe it's not a great time to buy.
912.60s: This is just one example.
914.04s: Other things like getting wrapped up in these new tools like options flow when dark pools
919.72s: and algo trading, newsflash retail traders, we are the tip of the tail of the dog.
925.84s: By the time you're seeing this stuff, it's been out for decades.
929.20s: You can use these tools, nothing wrong with that.
931.40s: You're not going to find some sort of crazy edge in these kinds of things.
935.16s: You still have to make it yourself.
936.44s: The last one, avoid simple explanations.
939.56s: We went through a bunch of things here.
941.08s: Markets are complex.
942.28s: We have a disposition to discreetly summarize things.
946.84s: It is satiating to us.
948.68s: We as humans want that to happen.
951.32s: Sometimes you can do that.
952.40s: If a company has a great earnings release and then it skyrockets after earnings, you
956.00s: could probably point at that and say, yeah, it went up because of earnings.
959.52s: But never let that go too far because as soon as you start thinking that you can connect
964.48s: all of these dots.
966.00s: You run into a problem where you're now creating these different kinds of thesis that may
970.64s: or may not play out because you're dealing with an insanely complex system.
974.40s: And the only thing that matters is price.
977.80s: Where does price go?
980.04s: That's what you care about.
981.28s: So it's cool.
982.28s: Try to develop relationships with the products.
984.24s: Try to get an idea of how things move.
986.00s: Never get too wrapped up in your own narratives because it's probably only partly true.
990.32s: There's anything I left out.
991.64s: Throw it in the comments.
992.64s: Like, subscribe, share, be an outlier.
994.52s: I'll see you guys later.
