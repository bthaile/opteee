0.12s: do you know the difference between good
2.32s: and bad risk as a Trader my guess is
5.44s: most Traders out there have an idea on a
7.76s: spectrum but it's not really well-
9.88s: defined so the goal of this video is to
12.20s: walk you through in detail good risk
15.24s: versus bad risk with examples and then
17.92s: at the end of the video I'm going to go
19.88s: through some best practices that I've
21.80s: learned from Trading over the years
24.04s: what's up everybody welcome back to all
25.72s: the outliers and a shout out to the
27.08s: patreon family you guys make content
28.92s: like this Poss for everybody else so
31.36s: thank you for the support let's get
33.24s: straight into it so first let's start
35.52s: with level setting how do we make money
37.28s: in the markets well really there's these
38.92s: two broad buckets you can either earn
41.52s: the risk-free rate so kind of Government
43.48s: Bond investing something like that which
45.44s: is seen as very very low risk which
48.80s: typically will correspond to pretty low
51.12s: returns or you can take risk of some
54.32s: sort you can take speculative risk and
56.72s: guess on a direction you can offload
58.96s: risk for another Trader by assuming
60.80s: their risk via selling cash secured puts
64.20s: where somebody's buying puts for
65.80s: protection and you're selling them there
67.56s: are lots of different ways to take risk
70.40s: but the idea here is for us to
72.16s: understand the difference between good
73.56s: and bad risk and then most importantly
76.64s: to understand what our individual risk
79.76s: profiles are so for the next part of
82.08s: this I want you to think about yourself
84.76s: how do you think about risk because most
87.56s: people fall closer to one of two
89.92s: spectrums either you're very risk averse
93.12s: you don't want to take risk you look to
95.36s: hedge risk at most opportunities and
97.80s: unfortunately this typically means
99.36s: you're not going to make any money
100.92s: because as you hedge all of this risk
103.56s: all of that incurs cost which pretty
105.64s: much moves you closer to this risk-free
107.16s: rate or you could be the kind of person
109.24s: that's very risk open you don't really
111.20s: think about it probably not as much as
113.28s: you should and sooner or later you put
116.28s: on risk that you didn't fully think
118.16s: about and it runs you over in
119.84s: eviscerates your account the idea here
122.56s: is to fall somewhere in the middle
124.32s: because notice here how I have R to R
127.32s: this is risk and this is reward risk and
130.28s: reward are intimately tied to one
132.24s: another it's not a onetoone relationship
134.40s: you can find really great risk
136.24s: opportunities which we're we're going to
138.16s: talk
139.16s: about here I come oh here I come oh but
142.56s: in general you would do well to assume
146.04s: if you see a big reward there's probably
148.64s: a correspondingly excise risk somewhere
151.88s: close by that you may or may not see so
154.44s: the idea here is to see where you fall
157.12s: on this scale and then to create
159.76s: structures that allow you to operate
163.00s: effectively given how you feel about
165.80s: these two extremes so remember as we go
169.36s: through this not all risk is created
172.16s: equal and the markets are indifferent to
175.48s: your perception your preferences none of
178.20s: that matters the risk is going to to be
180.04s: whatever the risk is so let's talk about
182.56s: bad risk the very first thing I have for
185.08s: you here is undefined risk so what does
187.88s: that mean does that mean that I think
189.80s: every trade you put on has to be a
192.12s: vertical spread or something that has
194.20s: structurally defined risk no that's not
196.84s: what I mean so take for example this
199.00s: vertical that we have in AMD instead of
202.44s: trading a vertical spread which if you
204.64s: know anything about me you know I
205.80s: actually don't like these why do you
207.68s: hate me you can manage risk a lot of
210.12s: other ways you could Define a period
213.96s: that if it gets to that point you get
215.84s: out so let's say in this example you
218.20s: sell this short putut let's say it's not
221.24s: cash secured and you're not wanting to
223.88s: take assignment you can pick a point
226.24s: that you say okay if it gets below 80
228.48s: I'm going to get out and then you can
230.16s: validate that point you could say okay
232.04s: if I look at a chart do I think this
233.92s: gives the trade enough room to move and
235.52s: if it gets down here do I think that I'm
237.72s: adequately proven wrong this happens to
240.16s: be below six-month lows in that case
242.36s: that would probably be a really
243.52s: effective place to Define your risk so
246.08s: even in undefined risk trades you can
249.04s: Define your risk the next is unknown
252.20s: risk using AMD again let's say in this
255.68s: trade you wanted to put on this 24
258.76s: November vertical short put whatever it
261.32s: is but you didn't know a had earnings
264.00s: today that is an unknown risk that you
267.56s: exposed yourself to so we have to work
270.16s: around that we have to think about
271.96s: different common sources of risk that
274.60s: you might not know about and make sure
276.60s: we check for them you can create a
279.28s: trading checklist that allows you to
280.96s: look for these things another great
282.96s: example of unknown risk is let's say
285.48s: that you wanted to trade intraday SPX
288.80s: options and you didn't know fomc was
292.08s: that day that's another unknown risk
294.84s: that you are stepping in front of that
297.04s: you're not acknowledging you don't know
298.64s: it's there that's a problem so we have
301.16s: to make sure that in our trading process
303.68s: we have a way to identify most sources
307.92s: of risk there's going to be risk you
310.00s: cannot control that's okay that's part
312.60s: of the game but the idea is we want to
314.84s: know about almost all of it if possible
318.68s: then we have misunderstood risk this
320.56s: comes in many different forms so for
322.76s: example a common misunderstood risk is
326.40s: that if we look at this vertical in AMD
329.88s: people will assume that this is a safer
333.32s: trade than just selling the short put
336.72s: that's not necessarily the case because
339.60s: the cost to hedge via this long put in
343.40s: the long run this trade might actually
346.40s: not even be positively expectant meaning
350.36s: it can lose money in the long run
352.16s: compared to this one so when we're
354.20s: thinking about risk you have to think
356.64s: about this idea of catastrophic risk if
359.24s: there's a big move but then also the
361.40s: systematic risk what does this do if we
364.28s: deploy it in the long run this is also
366.72s: very akin to the common idea that really
369.32s: high probability strategies make money
371.92s: that's also not so much the case you can
374.32s: have something with a 90 plus% win rate
377.32s: but if the metrics of the trade in terms
379.80s: of average win size versus average loss
382.96s: size don't make sense even with the 90%
385.96s: win rate you can still lose money so
389.88s: that leads us to this idea of good risk
392.44s: I kind of was sprinkling this in as we
394.48s: ran through the other scenarios so the
397.12s: very first thing a good risk is one that
400.08s: is defined so if we're to trade this
403.56s: cash secured put or naked short put in
406.68s: AMD defining that risk that's a good
410.52s: risk to take because then we can analyze
413.72s: that defined risk that we're setting
416.24s: compared to the profit potential and see
418.24s: if it makes sense next is unknown risk I
422.04s: call this researched risk but
423.92s: essentially this is just where we don't
426.00s: have things sneaking up on us so again
428.60s: if I'm trading AMD I know to look when
431.32s: does it have earnings does it have any
432.84s: big news that's on the road map that's
435.20s: going to happen while I'm in the trade
437.40s: and then we have misunderstood versus
439.92s: accepted risk you can have for example
443.64s: risk in an earnings play where there's
446.00s: an overnight move that's really big if
448.68s: you accept that risk as part of a
451.32s: broader system and it still makes sense
454.56s: that's a great example of accepted risk
457.52s: it's something that you've analyzed even
459.88s: if that risk is realized in a broader
461.92s: system it still works out okay it still
464.72s: makes sense that is an example of good
467.44s: risk another great example of good risk
471.48s: is when you can create an asymmetric
474.52s: return profile I have a recent trade
477.20s: that I talked about in another video in
479.40s: the vix that was a vix ratio called
481.88s: diagonal where I was trading this to the
484.12s: upside when I was placing this trade it
486.52s: was on the 15th of September just as the
489.40s: market started fall well the market was
492.28s: very very relaxed but the vix fell below
494.68s: 13 so to me that was a spot I was
497.08s: interested in getting long long story
498.92s: short I looked at the upside potential
501.96s: compared to what I considered to be the
503.76s: near-term downside potential where I was
506.28s: defining the risk in the trade and this
509.04s: was essentially the downside risk I was
511.52s: accepting about a dollar move in the vix
513.44s: to the downside compared to what I
515.48s: thought could be an $8 plus move to the
517.84s: upside that's an asymmetric return
520.80s: profile that was created by defining the
523.60s: risk that is another great example of
525.64s: good risk so let's talk about some best
527.36s: practices first probably guess this
530.04s: every single trade that goes on needs to
532.24s: have risk defined it doesn't always have
534.64s: to be structurally defined but you have
536.92s: to Define it as a Trader the second
538.88s: thing is we researched the potential
541.44s: risks to the trade so that we know about
543.64s: them at least and then we can assess the
546.96s: overall risk-reward profile of the trade
549.20s: to make sure it makes sense that is an
552.60s: idea that most Traders forgo because
555.80s: they will look at something like a high
557.60s: win rate and they're automatically on
559.64s: board because they just think it's a
561.16s: high win rate how could you lose you can
563.52s: still lose money long term that's why it
566.56s: is so important to look at the risk
569.44s: reward profile and the expected return
572.44s: of that strategy over the long run so
575.76s: that's a general rundown of good versus
578.32s: bad risk if there's anything I missed
580.00s: throw it in the comments below don't
581.76s: forget like subscribe be an outlier I'll
584.04s: see you guys later
