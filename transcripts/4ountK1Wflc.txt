0.00s: What's up everyone? Welcome back to the L.I.
4.00s: podcast. I got Duneberg here yet again. We are going to talk about all things macro economic
10.80s: geopolitical and as we were talking about just for a few moments before we started the recording,
14.96s: there is literally no shortage of things to talk about. So before we dive in, welcome back.
19.52s: Great to have you. Hey, I would great to be back with you. I always enjoy our conversations and
23.76s: looking forward to another great one today. I always have an opportunity like I was telling you
28.56s: right before we started to selfishly learn a lot. So I fully intend to take advantage of that.
33.52s: The first thing I wanted to start with, I don't know, we don't have to go super far in the weeds
38.40s: depending on how you guys like to dance around the topics. But did you catch the debate last night?
43.60s: And was there anything in there that stuck out to you? And then just for the listeners really
47.76s: quick, we're recording right now on the 28th of June. So there was a debate last night between Biden
53.68s: and Trump. Yeah, look, we haven't written about the presidential election directly. We're not a
58.88s: political newsletter, although on various podcast appearances, I have made the case, which I think
65.68s: is just an obvious statement of fact that Joe Biden is seen up. And the man is not there. That's
74.32s: shame for Joe Biden. And it's a scandal, I think, for the Democratic Party. And for the
82.16s: cadre of enablers that have surrounded the president and have decided that they thought that they
89.04s: could trick the American people into thinking that a man who is obviously suffering from
94.08s: serious cognitive decline could not only be president, but run for another four-year term.
100.88s: And I think, you know, Epsilon Theory, Ben Hunt put out a great piece this morning, which basically
109.76s: said that this was a narrative shifting event. It was a watershed moment in US political history.
117.28s: And look, this is not a partisan statement. Like Joe Biden's mental decline, even in the four
127.28s: years, I mean, the signs were there in 2020, but in the past year, it's become undeniable.
134.32s: And he is unsuited to be president of the United States. And if you disagree with that,
141.52s: then that's like on you. Like you could be a lifelong and many lifelong Democrats were
146.72s: panicking last night based on the reporting that we've seen the commentary on CNN and MSNBC.
152.64s: You know, I didn't watch the debate. Again, we're not a political newsletter. I'm far more
155.92s: interested in what's going on in the energy world, but of course, who is president of the United
160.40s: States impacts US energy policy in a significant way. And the US is the world's largest energy
166.40s: gigapower. And so the presidency of the United States, of course, matters to the work that we do.
171.76s: But I say this, like as an outraged citizen, like, who did they think they were like, this was
178.08s: obvious to you. I assume long before last night that Joe Biden has, is not fit to be president.
184.64s: Like, how is it that in 2024, it took a nationwide televised debate, and forget nationwide,
193.20s: worldwide televised debate, for what has been obvious to anybody who's being attention to suddenly
198.48s: become the thing that everybody already knows, to put, you know, Ben Hunts' language on the
203.52s: situation. And so I think it's very sad night. Sad for the president. Sad for the party. Sad for
211.84s: the country. Sad for the world. What a joke. I mean, there's no other way to describe it.
216.88s: Last night was a fiasco, and the enablers who allowed it to happen ought to be ashamed of themselves.
225.28s: Now, if I'm not mistaken, the debate last night actually got shifted originally. And I was seeing
232.24s: something, and again, I'm really not interested to go super far down the political rabbit hole myself,
237.20s: but there's a specific macroeconomic tie-in that I'm going to lead us to.
244.08s: One of the the thesis I've seen floating around is that we, the debate was shifted to potentially
251.20s: highlight Biden may or may not be suitable, and to provide time for a replacement,
258.08s: if the Democratic Party wants to look for a replacement for him. Now, from macroeconomic view,
266.16s: who are the people that you think can have the largest impact on the energy sector that would
273.60s: potentially replace him? Have you guys gone down that rabbit hole yet? Are you kind of waiting to
277.68s: see what happens first? Oh, sure. Of course. And we've seen those. I don't want to use the word
283.60s: conspiracy theory because I don't like that phrase, but I've seen those hypotheses, which would
290.32s: explain why this debate was so early. It's pretty rare to have presidential debates before the
296.88s: conventions. And it was odd that Biden insisted on having this debate, or the people around Biden,
305.28s: based on last night, it's pretty clear, who isn't making various critical strategic decisions
312.24s: around the Biden campaign. So I don't doubt. And by the way, the coordinated response from the
320.40s: sort of left part of the media, sort of universally saying that Biden needs to step aside was,
328.16s: was interesting, although who could argue based on that performance that isn't the the only logical
334.48s: conclusion that you could make? Now, I'm seeing reports today that Biden has just dead-facely insisted
339.68s: that he will remain on the ticket. And absent intervention, 25th amendment, or whatever it is,
347.12s: there's no legal way for the Democrats to switch jockeys at this point in the electoral process.
354.48s: And if Biden insists that he will continue to run for president, then I don't understand
362.40s: absent intervention and sort of involuntary intervention. How anything happens? And in fact,
372.48s: I was talking to a few friends, you know, obviously everybody just grouped texting and so on.
379.36s: I don't know how it can be that you are unfit to run for president, but you're still fit to be
385.52s: president. And so if he's unfit to run for president, doesn't he kind of have to resign? And he's not
392.40s: going to want to resign. And so he's going to run for president. That was kind of my deductive reasoning.
399.04s: At least as a hypothesis to sort of share with my group of friends as to how to game theory this out.
404.96s: Like, how can you not be capable mentally of running for president, but still be capable of being
411.92s: president? I don't think anybody is thinking about that right now. They're all just thinking about,
416.08s: well, he could just pull out of the race and, you know, they'll have an open convention. Not so fast.
421.28s: He's still the commander of chief of the United States of America. Right? Like, that's actually more
425.92s: important than running for president, being president for the next seven, eight months or whatever it is.
431.20s: Matters. We're, by the way, we're in the Cusp of World War three. Like, if it ever were to matter,
437.12s: it would be now. So I don't understand like the logic either he can run for president. And
441.76s: based on last night, I don't know how anybody absent blind partisans could agnastically observe what
449.28s: occurred last night and come to a conclusion that this man is prepared to be president and then leave
453.36s: him in office until January. So like, if he's not going to resign, he's going to run out that I don't see
459.92s: the state in which he pulls back, but stays president. And I think because of that as a constraint,
466.32s: I'd be shocked if he pulls back. They may try to pull it off. But again, if you would,
470.96s: like that, that's why I think the team Biden, whether it's Jill or whoever is making the decision,
477.44s: you know, behind the scenes, they know that if they don't run, they can't stay president.
485.20s: Now, the steel man, the same argument, do you think that their focus on staying president
492.96s: would be so powerful that they would risk a higher probability of losing a Democrat in office?
502.24s: I think if there's anything that we have seen from these 80 plus something year old politicians
508.08s: as they never want to leave. It's actually, it's funny you bring up that point on the age because
514.48s: the other thing I was going to ask you about is again, kind of tying it back to the evolution of
520.72s: energy. To me, it seems really interesting that we continue to have older minds, even because
527.84s: Trump's not young either. So, yeah, like we have a series of older people that are
534.56s: vying for presidency. And I'm curious if that kind of just function of age and paradigm that
541.76s: comes with that age has an impact on the way you view the next four years of energy as compared to
549.52s: what it could look like if somebody more, I don't want to say progressive necessarily,
553.28s: except as a bunch of different connotations. But it's more just temporal in terms of their
558.16s: views of energy and the evolution of energy. Do you think that the age bracket, even that we're
562.88s: talking about, has a pretty significant shaping function on what the energy picture looks like
568.96s: for the next four years? I think the age bracket, the dominant feature of the age bracket is
573.92s: impossible for anybody who's been in Washington for that long to not be corrupt. And so,
580.32s: you know, in my ideal world, and look, I get that there's a whole half of the country that
585.44s: think Trump won the 2020 election. I think it's important to acknowledge that
590.16s: that there are important questions in this regard. And many people hold strong views that
594.96s: the election in 2020 was not on the up and up. And that if that's true, if you believe those
599.44s: things, and I'm not saying that I do, but I'm acknowledging that some people do. And if they believe
603.36s: those things, they think Trump deserves another shot. And I think if you just look at the
608.40s: dominant way in which he run, he won the Republican nomination. It's pretty clear that a fair
613.52s: number of Republican primary voters must believe that because they sent him back to the ticket,
618.96s: despite all of the baggage, real invented, fabricated, or otherwise, that the man undeniably has.
625.04s: And so he's the Republican nominee. And I think that needs to be respected. Now,
629.76s: in my ideal world, which can't exist, wouldn't exist, we would have had a three-way race between
635.92s: Gavin Newsom, Ron DeSanto, and Joe Manchin as an independent. And from an energy perspective,
641.60s: they all have different views. Although even Gavin Newsom has sort of come around to being
646.56s: pro-Nuclear, and I think is just playing footsie with the Renable Movement in California because
650.32s: of political necessity, and that if he were to be the selected candidate to replace Joe Biden,
656.72s: that he would move to the center, I mean, he's, I wouldn't underestimate Gavin Newsom as a
660.72s: national political actor. I think he's a very talented politician. Do I agree with
665.68s: more than 10% of what he proposes in California? No. But again, as an agnostic observer with no
671.84s: skin in the game, I think he's a formidable political candidate. And in fact, there's a bit of a
676.88s: contrary in view that last night was bad for Trump because it makes it obvious that Biden needs to
681.44s: be replaced and his replacement can only do better. But a three-way race between Newsom, DeSanto's,
688.88s: and Joe Manchin, would have done two very positive things for the country. One, it would have
694.80s: presented the country with a choice among sort of that next generation of political leaders. I mean,
700.88s: they're not the youngest crowd, but they're certainly not in their 80s, but also two. All three of
708.64s: them can complete a sentence. And they have well-articulated and formed views on important topics like
714.00s: energy. And we could have had a civilized debate and give the people a set of three relatively
722.32s: talented next generation by presidential candidates to choose from. And we don't have that right now.
730.08s: We have Trump, who have to country believes should be president and have to country believe
735.92s: should be in jail. And we have Biden, who is basically, I think, the victim of elder abuse.
742.32s: And how is this the choice is really defuddling?
748.40s: Yeah. I really share the same sentiment that you do in a lot of different ways.
755.92s: You mentioned a little bit earlier, and I wanted to ask you about this because the last time we
759.92s: spoke, you discussed this concept of World War III here, you're talking about that were on the
765.84s: Caspavet. And then I think last time we were talking, you were of the opinion that we might be
770.88s: even a little bit further potentially might have kind of already kicked off. I would just love
774.88s: an update on that perspective and see if that's still your view, if there's new inputs that factor
782.00s: into your assessment of that, because obviously for me with a military background, the concept of
785.92s: World War III is very scary. Scary too. I hope, yeah, because you're a sane person who doesn't
791.20s: want to see you or your friends die. Well, and just a quick caveat off that as well. Even as you
797.60s: look at the evolution of warfare from a practitioner standpoint, it starts to get kind of terrifying.
803.28s: Everything that you see going on with Russia and Ukraine, the capabilities of these drones,
807.68s: the idea that you can have an infantry battalion out there that just gets swarmed by a few hundred
814.80s: drones that cost pretty cheap relative to what they are is terrifying. Yeah, look, look, here's,
820.32s: I think we're way way way closer to World War III than is being reported in the West. I'm not
825.84s: sure if you saw this or know this, but last week, there was an attack on the missile that appears
832.88s: to have been partially deflected and exploded and the cluster munitions, at least some of them
840.72s: fell onto a beach where civilians were enjoying the sun in Kramar, which Russia claims to be part
847.52s: of Russia and Ukraine claims to be part of Ukraine. And so it is contested territory to be fair.
852.08s: And Russia accused the US of directly being involved. And I think it's pretty clear that those
859.44s: attackums missiles require US guidance systems and drones to help pinpoint targeting and so on.
866.16s: And an amazing thing happened that has been completely ignored by the Western media.
872.32s: The Russian foreign ministry summoned the US ambassador and said in their official readout that
879.84s: they told the US ambassador that they believe the US is now an official party to the conflict
886.24s: in Ukraine and that the US had helped Ukrainian leaders facilitate a war crime and that they should
894.56s: expect swift retaliatory measures on the part of the Russians. When the Cuban Missile Crisis was
903.76s: unfolding and the world was on the edge of a nuclear exchange, it was wall-to-wall coverage.
909.76s: And the West, how many people listening to this know what I just said would you guess?
915.44s: That-
915.92s: Yeah, I would imagine the vast majority do not.
918.40s: Correct. Everybody in Russia knows it. And in fact, the feeling in Russia is that Putin is being
925.84s: too weak and too slow to respond to this event. And that once again, he is not being as hard
931.12s: line as many in Russia would like him to be. Now there's this belief in the West that Russia is
935.36s: a one-man show. I think that's a false belief. Putin has his own political constraints. And by the
941.60s: way, like if there were to be a quote-unquote regime change, which many in the West would like to see
945.52s: in Russia, I suspect that the person who replaces Putin would be hardered line. And that would accelerate
950.88s: sleepwalking into the abyss as we seem to be doing. So we have this situation. We have reports of
955.76s: North Korean troops being sent to fight alongside Russia and Ukraine. The Russians have warned
962.96s: that because the U.S. is arming and the West and NATO are arming Ukraine with advanced
969.36s: missile systems that they will do the same to enemies of the U.S. in various proxies around the
974.80s: world. North Korea would be on that list, for example, given the tensions with South Korea and
979.92s: the U.S. bases that are just over that border. The Houthis, the Iranians, pick your favorite.
986.48s: There's an important Iranian election happening today. And depending on who wins, it looks like
992.08s: there might be a similar treaty signed between Iran and Russia that has recently been signed
997.60s: between North Korea and Russia. I wonder how many people listening even know that.
1003.04s: The rest of the world knows it. The rest of the world sees it. They're treating it like World War
1007.04s: 3. If you read the Russian propaganda, if you read the Chinese propaganda, they believe and talk
1011.28s: as though they were already in World War 3. And they are explicitly saying they're fighting the
1016.40s: U.S. and NATO, the Atlantisists, as they would call. You may think that's nonsense,
1023.04s: but that's not what they're telling their citizens. And I think it's important to know what's
1027.36s: being told to the citizens of our geopolitical adversaries. Look, if the president of the United
1033.04s: States, which is kind of funny to say, after our first discussion, honestly believes that the U.S.
1039.04s: should declare war against Russia over the Dombas, then we should have a debate in Congress and
1042.88s: declare war and send our troops in treasure over there and fight for it. This sleepwalking our
1047.84s: way in and sort of partially doing things, but pretending as though we're not directly involved
1052.32s: is only escalating the situation. I would like for my Congressperson to cast a vote before my
1059.84s: draft eligible children are pulled up and sent to war. The U.S. Constitution was designed
1065.84s: such that Congress declared war. You need the approval of Congress to go to war. We are in a war
1072.00s: with Russia today. I mean, we are in a direct kinetic conflict with Russia today in nuclear
1076.64s: superpower. And they're warning us that nuclear arms are not out of the question. And that if we
1082.88s: don't pull back from the brink, there will be an escalation, which could lead to an uncontrolled
1088.80s: explosion, literally. And that's fine if the president believes that U.S. should formally go to war
1098.56s: over the Dombas. Then let's make the case. Let's have the debate in Congress. We're going to end
1105.04s: up in a war without having had declared war because we're kind of already are. And that's what's
1109.84s: really amazing to me. We blew up the Nord Stream 2. We blew up the Nord Stream pipeline. Let's just
1116.88s: call it like it is. We want them we destroyed a ten or a decade dollar energy infrastructure
1124.00s: owned 50% by the Germans. And then pretend it as though we didn't do it. And everybody is sort
1129.36s: of winking and smiling and saying we did no we blew up those. Do we have conclusive evidence of that?
1135.28s: I mean, you know, how much evidence do you need Eric? I mean, the president said he was going to do it.
1140.56s: It happened. And magically all of the intelligence agencies around the world is like the
1145.52s: immaculate destruction. Nobody can quite pinpoint who did it. Everybody knows who did it. And I
1149.28s: could assure you, who didn't know who did it? Xi Jinping knows who did it. The Iranians know who did it.
1154.88s: We didn't. I mean, I think it's pretty conclusive at this point. I mean, the U.S blew up Nord Stream.
1159.76s: If you look at Seymour Hersches reporting on the matter and the complete lack of the ability to
1164.88s: pinpoint who did this dastardly thing, I think the evidence is there that we did it.
1170.32s: So just at a curiosity though, like obviously it's a super bold claim. And the evidence that you're
1175.60s: citing there is a lack of evidence. Me that isn't a
1178.64s: illusion. Like I get the inference. So just to be clear, just be clear.
1183.04s: Okay, let me give you the full evidence. In the weeks before it happened and when the war broke out,
1188.08s: Joe Biden explicitly said at a press conference that Nord Stream will not happen and we'll make
1192.32s: sure that it doesn't happen. And when pressed as to why that would be the case, he specifically said
1198.88s: it won't happen. Okay. Suddenly the pipeline gets exploded. And there's reports
1208.80s: by reasonably credible people that the U.S. did it. The Dinos have been relatively flaccid.
1215.44s: And in the end, if we had strong evidence that any other actor was actually involved in this,
1220.64s: don't you think we would have seen it by now? I mean, I think if there was evidence of another actor,
1225.52s: I would agree with you. But again, like I wouldn't at least just in my personal opinion and you get
1229.84s: more informed than I am, I just I don't disagree with the inference you're making. I just think it's a
1235.60s: leap to say this conclusively happened. I mean, I just think that at some point you have to decide
1241.76s: that at least all the players involved believe this would be true. I think it is conclusive
1245.84s: that Russia believes U.S. will have the pipeline and you could draw that conclusion by what Putin said
1250.80s: to Tucker Carlson in their interview. And if Putin believes it, the Chinese believe it and the
1256.16s: Iranians believe it. And so we may as well just assume we did it as the the you know in the scientific
1262.00s: method, the theory that that is consistent with the evidence and is not nullified is actually a
1267.68s: real thing. That's how science works. You propose a hypothesis, you test it against the evidence.
1273.12s: If nothing nullifies it, that hypothesis becomes a theory. And unless and until there's definitive
1278.00s: evidence against that theory, that is the operating assumption of science. And so I'm sort of coming
1283.28s: at this from a scientific perspective, which is I've been waiting for somebody to nullify the
1286.56s: hypothesis that the U.S. will and to the Nord Stream pipelines and there is no evidence that we didn't.
1291.12s: And the theory that we did fits all of the observable data. And so until somebody comes up with
1295.68s: a nullification of that, I think we need to operate on the assumption that we did. And so maybe I was
1300.40s: a little looser with my original characterization of it when we first went down that road, but I think
1304.88s: it matters. I think like everybody sort of wings and smiles and knows that we did it. And certainly
1310.80s: the Russians believe that we did it. And if we had any evidence that anybody else had an
1314.32s: else did it, and certainly one of our adversaries did it, then we would be screaming that evidence
1319.60s: loud and high and we're not. And so I don't know, I think it's a pretty safe assumption for an
1324.24s: analyst like you and I to have as an axiom for further game planning.
1329.92s: Yeah. And I think it's a fair logical thought process. I think like the way that you assess it
1336.56s: in the logical flow, no debates there. But I think the only other thing to notice is who killed
1343.12s: JFK. I mean, at some point, I mean, did you kill JFK? It's actually defined to be unknowable,
1350.56s: which is a probably a whole other podcast. Yeah. But that's in that's kind of the point because I
1355.36s: also think it's really dangerous to predicate a lot of the thought process on like what Russia is
1359.68s: messaging or what Russia says to have happened. Because if you listen to that same Tucker-Cross
1364.88s: and podcast, who I actually think Putin was very articulate. And I learned a lot about their
1370.56s: perspective, but after a fair amount of digging, there's also a fair number of inaccuracies that he
1375.68s: very writes. So all I'm saying is that for people listening, I think it's important. I think it's
1382.40s: completely okay to look at a breath of evidence and to come up with a hypothesis about it. But
1388.64s: when we move into the realm of theory, this is something that's like repeatedly tested and
1392.96s: observable with multiple tests that yield to seem resolved. But right now the primary tests are
1399.44s: somebody said something, it blew up. Other people say something that are all aligned with their
1403.76s: individual incentives. Yeah, from a skeptic standpoint. If I put you on a lie detector test and
1409.68s: said, do you think the US blew up the pipeline? I mean, I think you would probably have to say yes
1413.12s: at this point. My genuine answer is I genuinely don't know. Well, my genuine answer is I would say yes.
1421.20s: Yeah, and that's fair. And that's totally fair. Yeah. And the only reason why I like going down
1426.24s: that thought process anyways is because I really respect the way that you form a hypothesis and the
1431.60s: way that you guys look at these different dots. Because I think it's good for people to see
1435.52s: different thought processes and how you connect them. So that I think is really informative.
1440.40s: So anyways, thank you for diving into the realm of two. Of course, I enjoyed it. And by the way,
1444.72s: like I get if credible evidence nullifies our current working hypothesis, I would call it a theory
1451.68s: that the US did this. We would be the first to write it, but we're wrong. Understand how we got
1455.36s: it wrong and try to learn from it. So I mean, we have a philosophy that mistake should be
1459.20s: rare admitted to correct it and learn from. If you told me I had to bet my mortgage on a
1464.40s: who don't it, I think I would I would sleep pretty soundly on the back. That's a that's a fun see,
1473.12s: that's different than like who do you think? And I think who do I think share go with my genuine
1479.52s: feeling? But if that was you have to pick somebody and bet on it, that's a different scenario.
1484.56s: I like that framing better. That's the that's the trader's mindset, right?
1487.68s: Of course, as a decision. Yeah. Well, the goal part about a trader's mindset is I get to pass on
1492.24s: anything that I don't have a formed idea on. I can say that looks weird, but that I'm just going
1497.68s: to something else. But anyways, really, really interesting. So going all the way back though,
1503.04s: to kind of this escalation you were talking about Nord Stream before I kind of derailed us.
1508.16s: And you were talking about this just growing breadth of escalations and tensions between
1516.56s: Russian US. So going back to this broader war three hypothesis, I have to then preemptively ask,
1524.56s: like, do you still do you still view mad as a theory or working theory? Or do you think that that's
1533.52s: potentially going by the wayside here? Because you're talking about nuclear escalation, but
1538.16s: to me, obviously, then the next logical inject there would be mad.
1543.44s: Yeah. So for those that aren't familiar, mad stands for mutually assured destruction,
1549.04s: which was a core foundational sort of strategic ambiguity between the two sides,
1558.24s: allowed that to become the foundation of Daytona until the Soviet Union fell apart.
1566.16s: And I think as per versus it sounds, it was a system that worked rather well
1571.76s: as evidenced by the fact that we have not blown the planet up in a tactical nuclear exchange or
1578.08s: strategic nuclear exchange. I get the feeling that the Russians are far more serious about war,
1588.32s: well, look, the war is on Russia's doorstep, not on our doorstep. The Ukrainians and the Russians
1594.56s: have a very long history. Ukrainians and the Americans have far less of a history.
1600.96s: From the Russian perspective, as articulated by Putin and everyone else in the sort of Russian
1607.20s: sphere of influence, this in their mind is an existential struggle. And the US certain leaders,
1615.68s: who I find there are comments to be rather dangerous and reckless, are saying things like,
1619.76s: hey, it's a great return on investment because the Ukrainians are fighting the Russians and
1624.72s: we're weakening the Russians, but no American soldiers are involved and so on and so on.
1628.48s: What's the Russians? This sounds all very rather cynical. And we saw the Russian Navy sail to Cuba
1636.40s: this time and dance around a little bit outside of Miami. And who knows how serious that was.
1640.88s: It didn't seem to make much news here. But let's think step back, Eric.
1647.52s: Why do we care about nuclear proliferation? Why do we have international treaties and we have
1654.88s: huge diplomatic efforts to make sure that countries don't become nuclear power as well?
1660.56s: The primary reason we care about nuclear proliferation is once a country obtains nuclear powers,
1665.68s: you have to treat them differently. They hold within their capability
1672.08s: the potential of doing existential damage to the United States. The reason we don't want
1680.80s: Iran to get the bomb and the reason we don't want North Korea to get the bomb is because once they
1684.64s: do, we have to treat them differently. Russia has the largest and most sophisticated nuclear arsenal
1689.60s: of the planet. It's beer than ours. It's more modern than ours. There's no scenario where if we
1696.88s: escalate to a nuclear, we're going to shoot all these things out of the sky. In my view, I'm not
1700.56s: an ultra expert. I think it's not certainly not a risk worth aching.
1709.04s: Give me another example. The dangerous analogy that I see going around is that this is akin to
1714.16s: Chamberlain appeasing Hitler in 1939. Hitler didn't have nuclear weapons. Neither did France.
1721.36s: Neither did the UK. And if the three of those countries had massive nuclear arsenals,
1726.40s: I suspect World War II might have developed differently. This is not Chamberlain. You might think
1733.68s: Putin is Hitler, but Putin is Hitler with the world's largest nuclear arsenal. If Hitler had the
1739.04s: world's largest nuclear arsenal, I don't think the war would have been resolved kinetically.
1746.08s: I just don't. That is a really important thing that people in the West, I believe,
1753.68s: are being quite flippant about. The Russians are not being flippant about it. The messaging is
1758.80s: very clear. This is existential to them. They have nuclear weapons for a reason. If NATO keeps
1763.84s: interfering or participates directly, they are not ruling out using nuclear weapons. Why have them?
1769.36s: If you can never use them, we're launching. We gave approval for Ukraine to launch Western
1775.20s: missiles into pre-2014 Russian borders. That was a big nodow for decades. We wouldn't tolerate it.
1785.84s: Imagine Russia was providing missiles to Mexico when they were launching them into Texas.
1790.16s: Now, look, if you're from Ukraine, all this is very enraging to you, what I'm saying. We don't
1794.64s: have a treaty with Ukraine. They're not a NATO member. We might like Ukraine, we might think that
1799.36s: Putin is acting in a gastro-ly way. But unless and until Putin overtly attacks an article five country,
1808.00s: it then gets back to my earlier point. All fine and good. Let's declare war, but let's have the debate.
1813.44s: Let's present it to Congress. Let's decide as a country that we're going to avert the embark on a
1818.40s: kinetic war with the nuclear superpower over the Donbass. People say, oh, well, if you appease
1825.12s: in there, he's going to roll on Poland and not great. Let's have that debate. If we're going to have a war
1830.80s: with Russia to preemptively defend Europe, then we need to have that debate. We're not having
1838.08s: that that's in that look at might sound like I'm a stickler for the rules, but we have rules.
1843.44s: We have a constitution. We have Congress. We have separation of powers.
1848.00s: There's a process. When Japan attacked Bill Harper, what did Roosevelt do? He gave speech to Congress,
1852.64s: asking for a declaration of war, which Congress do, did. Great. The Swede's supposed to work.
1858.80s: Why are we doing that now? We kind of want to have it both ways. We're going to send money over there,
1863.68s: but we're going to do things that the other side is openly telling us is the equivalent of
1868.40s: declaring war on them. The US ambassador of Russia was summoned by the Russian foreign ministry and
1873.44s: told that there will be retaliation against US military. That's a major thing. We ought to be
1879.60s: discussing it. That's a partisan thing. It doesn't make us pro-Putin. It doesn't make us pro-Russian.
1884.88s: It makes us pro-American. What are we doing? Last night's debate is the lens through which we
1894.48s: watched last night's debate is this lens. How could we... What does Russia and China and North
1902.72s: Korea think when they watch that debate? We are living in very historic times.
1909.52s: It's amazing to me. We watched CBS, ABC, NBC News, CNN, even Fox. Nobody's talking about
1917.92s: what happened at the foreign ministry in Russia. Everyone in Russia is talking about it. Why aren't we?
1923.76s: We're just going to wake up one day and there's a carrier sunk. What do we do then?
1928.72s: It's not impossible, by the way. I don't know. Call me crazy. I think before we embark on a
1936.00s: kinetic war with a nuclear superpower, we ought to at least have an open, honest,
1939.76s: public debate about the risks and rewards and the consequences of our actions.
1946.96s: I think it's a fair point. It's one of those things that,
1950.72s: kind of generally imagine, a lot of those conversations are happening, but to your point,
1955.36s: they're not known. And, addicuriosity, when you were talking about that derailed missile over the
1965.52s: beach, I just googled it out of curiosity to see what would come up. And I didn't see any US news
1972.16s: media in like the first 15. Yeah, so blackout. Yeah. I think it really eludes the dates
1980.48s: your point on where the conversation is happening and where it's not. It's. I actually, what I believe
1987.20s: happened in that event is Ukraine launched a series of attackings missiles into Crimea, into
1993.52s: Crimea at military targets and Russian air defense system either partially deflected or caused the
2000.32s: missile to deflect and unintentionally exploded over civilian targets, which happens in war.
2006.56s: I happen to believe that's what happened. The Russians are openly stating that this was a deliberate
2011.12s: act of terrorism by the Ukrainians, facilitated by the Americans. Now, I don't happen to believe
2015.44s: that's true. I'd be shocked, for example, if US were to allow the attackings missiles to be used
2022.16s: in that way. But that's what the Russians are telling themselves and we at least know that
2029.60s: and ponder what that means. Right? And so I want to be very clear. I'm not judging good guy, bad guy.
2037.20s: I'm just observing a developing situation that is very ominous and then observing at the same time
2042.96s: as you just proved with your Google search that nobody over here is talking about it. That's the part
2047.12s: that amazes me. Like Putin, this Hitler, Ukraine is worthy of our treasure and troops and our blood.
2053.68s: Great. Like that those are positions I could even be convinced on. But we're not having that debate.
2059.44s: We're just sleepwalking into the abyss. Yeah, into your point, I'm looking at an article from the
2067.12s: Moscow Times and it says Russia's defense ministry said Wednesday and Kiev bore responsibility for
2076.00s: deliberate missile strike on peaceful residents, which it said used US missile, US supplied missiles.
2084.16s: Yeah, that cannot be targeted without US drone technology and satellites and so on. And I also
2091.20s: saw that he has apparently given that go ahead to shoot American drones out of the sky in the
2096.16s: Black Sea, which the US would probably say is an act of war because they're flying in international
2101.68s: waters. And so you could see the very clear steps in the ladder of escalation.
2107.92s: It's coming. But again, the thing that's the most amazing part to me is I would guess less than
2112.32s: 2% of the people listening to this podcast know new of anything that we're talking about before today.
2118.56s: That's the part that scares me.
2121.60s: Well, and I think that's one of the interesting components about just general narratives
2125.68s: is you're talking about both from Russia's perspective, but also the US perspective. I think
2130.08s: that's the one of the difficult parts when trying to keep track with stuff like this is you guys
2135.92s: probably know better than just about anybody is how intensive it is to actually identify true
2142.32s: information from wherever media sources surround you because this is something I mean reading
2149.68s: further on this article, it starts talking about a terrorist attack and they're opening an
2153.84s: investigation. So to your point, very clear narrative being told on their side.
2158.64s: Yeah, interesting. Well, we wrote a piece called mapping the war where we address this issue.
2164.48s: Like, look, propaganda is thick all around the world. And especially during times of war,
2170.32s: right? When emotions get very high, look, I don't know that many Ukrainians. I don't know that many
2176.24s: Russians. I have no particular emotional, you know, tie to the war. I know war is terrible.
2184.88s: And I think what's going on as we said in a piece recently that I think like Russia,
2188.32s: wanting to be bombing Ukrainian and NNG infrastructure is an act of war is a war crime, sorry.
2193.76s: But, you know, wars are basically nothing but the integral of the series of war crimes.
2200.88s: But just objectively, yeah, like the nobody's going on, right? And you can't know what's going
2204.56s: on by reading the economist or the New York Times. And you can't know what's going on by reading
2209.28s: the Moscow Times. But there is a whole series of pro-Russian, pro-Ukrainian and
2216.56s: ostensibly neutral mappers who are following the day-to-day Edson Flows in the battlefield
2221.04s: using geolocations aided by AI and satellite data and, you know, reporting on the ground and
2227.92s: telegram channels and soldiers, social media and all that. The information is leaking out of
2232.40s: here. So you can see every day what's going on. And then you compare the reality of the truth that
2237.92s: you begin to assemble, correcting for various biases. Look, bias doesn't mean not useful,
2244.72s: as long as you understand what the bias is going in. You might assume to a burger's bias towards
2249.36s: the fossil fuel industry and you read our pieces accordingly. Of course, that's fine. Like that's
2253.60s: normal. Everybody's biased. Nobody's free from it. Not the least a bit bus. But once you get an
2259.84s: assemblance of what the truth actually is, and then you could observe how it's being reported,
2264.08s: and then you see what happens in the weeks ahead where the early truth that you learned
2267.92s: becomes reality and sort of conventional wisdom at some point, then you could begin to trust certain
2272.40s: sources. And we've developed a cadre of sources that we used to follow the war. And we're only
2278.24s: following the war because of its impact on the energy sector and also the potential that my
2284.24s: house could get destroyed in the nuclear holocaust. So that's kind of important to me too.
2288.96s: But like after a while, you begin to see like, yeah, like this paper is nonsense. Like the
2294.96s: economists and the financial times are reporting just does not reflect reality sometimes. And then
2299.68s: when they actually do reflect reality, that's data too. Like, oh, why is it okay to say that now?
2304.40s: Right? Like because again, we're submitted to propaganda. Propaganda is a legitimate tactic of war.
2309.68s: Like we had huge propagandas in all the wars that we fought. And that's perfectly normal.
2313.84s: This perfectly sensible. But as a free thinking person as an analyst, your objective is to try to
2318.48s: sort of cut through that propaganda and find out what the truth is to the extent that you can.
2322.00s: And in many ways, the internet has made that easier and harder.
2326.72s: There's an enormous amount of signal and there's just as much more noise. And so the ability to sort of
2332.08s: separate the two is a skill worth learning. Yeah, what a great point. And I'm glad that you walk
2339.28s: through a little bit about the process you use to navigate that because I think that that does
2345.20s: become a daily skill set for people. So thank you for kind of going into that a little bit.
2351.68s: Pivoting over more now to the energy side, I was listening to a couple of your recent
2357.20s: conversations and pieces about decarbonization and the path you think we're taking.
2366.88s: When you look out over the next 18 to 24 months, it might be a little too short term, but starting
2373.52s: there, what's your perception of the current roadmap we're on and the potential impact there of?
2382.40s: So the world is not decarbonizing. Interesting thing happened this week. June 20th was kind of like
2388.40s: a holiday for us here because the energy institute released its
2394.08s: statistical review of world energy for 2024, which is encompassing of data from the 70s all the way
2399.68s: up to 2023. And we learned some very interesting things. One of the things we learned is that
2406.40s: the consumption of oil set a new all time record. The consumption of coal set a new all time record.
2412.96s: And the consumption of natural gas basically tied a record from a couple of years ago,
2417.60s: but is sitting at an all time high. And in fact, this is a stat that will blow people's minds,
2426.72s: especially when measured against the propaganda around renewables that we have been fed.
2431.36s: The world added 7.5 exit jewels of fossil fuel energy in 2023 compared to 2022. And only added
2440.56s: five exit jewels of renewable energy in 2023 versus 2022. In other words, we added 50% more fossil fuel
2449.60s: energy than we did renewable energy, which is not something you would conclude from reading the
2453.92s: economist or the New York Times. Why is that? Our long-held view is energy is life.
2461.12s: All humans everywhere want a better life. It takes energy to improve your standard living.
2466.64s: Therefore, every molecule of fossil fuels produced will be burned by somebody somewhere and
2472.40s: local restrictions against such activities. Only change who gets the benefit from it.
2478.32s: Most of the western countries, well, all of the European countries in the European Union,
2485.36s: like they've not produced any meaningful amounts of fossil fuels. So the, I mean, Norway and the UK
2490.72s: aren't in EU and they both produce a meaningful amount of fossil fuels to be fair.
2496.24s: But the balance of the EU produces no fossil fuels. Therefore, their behavior is irrelevant
2501.52s: to carbon emissions because every molecule of fossil fuels produced will be burnt. And since Europe
2506.56s: doesn't produce any, they can't stop producing and therefore they can't really bend the arc of
2510.56s: carbon emissions. Indonesia, China, India, Pakistan, Brazil, they're going to develop. And if we don't
2518.00s: burn oil, they will take that oil at a slightly lower price than would otherwise be and burn it
2522.96s: themselves. And they are. And that's what we're seeing. The world watched what Europe did and stopped
2528.08s: listening to what Europe says when the energy crisis hit Europe and they reverted back to the coal
2533.44s: with a speed and efficiency of the evacuation of Dunkirk. And they took the appropriate
2539.36s: lessons. And so they're burning more coal or burning more oil. Natural gas is, you know,
2546.88s: and by the way, the US is like the total hypocrite on this. We produce 20% of the world's oil and
2551.20s: 25% of the world's natural gas in 2023. Who are we to tell the rest of the world? We know that
2557.52s: demand is gated by production and we're producing. And so I think it's a farce. I think the world
2563.36s: is not going to decarbonize. We might slow the rate of growth of the consumption of fossil fuels,
2569.44s: but we're not going to decline. We're not going to stop consuming fossil fuels. There's
2574.80s: seven billion people that don't live in the G7 that would like to have standards of living that
2579.04s: are comparable to the G7. And unless we're going to forcefully stop their development, which I don't
2584.40s: know how we could even do, they're going to develop. They're going to burn more. They're going to
2589.44s: use more nuclear. They're going to maybe install some winter bonds and solar panels, but if they do
2593.12s: it's just going to be additive, it's not going to displace any fossil fuels. It might displace, look,
2598.24s: Ireland could cut its emissions to zero and it would be a measurement error. Like what Ireland does,
2603.92s: what Germany does, what France does, really easy relevant, what matters is what China does,
2609.44s: and what India does, and what Pakistan does, and what Brazil does. And they have been made
2614.80s: and very clear that they're not signing up for preemptively stunting the development of the
2622.08s: standards of living in their country in the name of climate change. And so there will be no
2627.36s: decarbonization. You could mark that down. So what do you think about the policies that we're
2634.88s: seeing coming out that obviously are messaging that angle? Do you think that they're just kind
2642.64s: of positioning statement more of China virtue signal almost, or do you think that there's any world
2650.16s: where eventually we get to a point where we do try to pivot away from fossil fuels?
2657.20s: Well, there is no scenario where we pivot away from fossil fuels. I mean, that is, in our view,
2661.36s: it's not going to happen. And I think most of the people involved who have only ever worked in
2666.16s: government or at a university believe what they say, I just think they're wrong. I mean, I think
2672.96s: there's a core group of hardcore mouthingians who would like the world to use less energy and
2676.72s: for the world to have less people on it. That's nowhere near the majority. I think majority of people
2681.92s: were brainwashing school, went to university, worked for government, or worked in public affairs
2688.08s: at a BDC company where branding is all that matters and they're not trained in science.
2692.48s: And they haven't really thought through the issues. And they believe the nonsense that we can
2697.20s: create a utopian world of energy abundance with just solar and batteries.
2703.04s: The grand perpetual motion machine where battery materials are magnetically appear and don't
2708.16s: need diesel to mind them. And so on. And you know, vast majority of people have no understanding how
2715.60s: the grid works, the difference between base load and intermittent. Why, you know,
2722.24s: inertia in the grid is being degraded by the forced introduction of solar and this is causing
2726.80s: not just the reliability but the quality of electricity to degrade and this is causing end consumers
2733.04s: to have serious problems in their manufacturing and so on. There's a giant fallacy which we're
2738.88s: reporting on next is that the grand sort of conflation that occurs is that we look at a temporary
2747.20s: period of the cost to produce solar when it's released sunny and there's too much electricity and
2750.96s: we don't know what to do with it and the price goes negative. And we can flake that with the
2755.60s: average delivered cost to consumers of electricity and anywhere where solar is not anywhere. But in
2761.36s: on average where there's more solar prices go up, solar is not cheap. It's expensive to incorporate
2766.16s: solar into existing grids and you can't create a grid based on just solar and batteries that
2771.04s: is economical because batteries are too expensive and the materials don't exist. And so we've reached
2775.28s: this point where we accept a degradation of the grid so that we can all sort of slap each other
2780.56s: in the back and pretend like we're doing something to save the planet. What in reality the
2785.04s: the arc is very clear and I think one of our predictions is that the energy institute will no longer
2789.52s: produce this data because it's too embarrassing to the green energy transition and they'll eventually
2793.92s: they'll stop doing it or start lying because like it's a truly embarrassing document for all the
2799.68s: trillions that we've wasted chasing these energy year-of-grumps. Did you see that? California is
2806.08s: exploring the idea of mileage tax versus a gas tax. Yeah they have to because look EV. EVs are great
2813.04s: for California. By the way, I lived in California and I didn't drive more than 100 miles a day. I
2817.04s: don't know the EV. It's sunny there all the time. It's not winter. Batteries don't do well in the winter.
2822.48s: But electricity is expensive in California. Again we're just running some analysis like California. If there's one
2829.36s: place in a rover solar should work as California. Right. Why? The North and Mount of Sun. Lots of land that people
2835.60s: don't live in. And the electricity demand scales with the solar cycle. In other words because it's hot
2843.44s: there most of the time people run their air conditions during the day and less so at night and that's
2848.80s: when the sun is shining. So it should work in California. California is the largest producer of
2854.72s: solar in the country as a percent of their generation of electricity like 40 percent plus or minus.
2861.84s: And they're the second most expensive place for electricity for consumers. Like it's solar
2867.52s: or cheap. Why are Californians paying the most for electricity when they have the most solar?
2873.68s: It's and that's where it should work. Look solar can never work in Maine because the energy needs
2879.52s: in Maine and the winter come at night when it's cold and the sun isn't shining. And so there are certain
2884.56s: spots of the country where an electric vehicle and even some solar makes sense potentially.
2889.76s: But like to say that Alaskan should be driving electric vehicles is to admit that you have no idea
2896.88s: what you're talking about. Like Canadians aren't going to be driving electric vehicles in the
2901.44s: dead of winter in Alberta. Are you kidding me? It's not going to happen. Right? It's just not going to
2906.08s: happen. And by the way these are very large states and provinces that people drive long distances
2911.52s: all the time and there's just no substitute for diesel or a long haul truck. Well maybe you could
2915.92s: do some hydrogen trucks and combustion and all that stuff but in reality it's not going to happen.
2921.28s: And and the next piece is tentatively titled No Solar is in cheap and we're just going to give
2928.16s: you the three arguments you could use at the holiday dinner table when that annoying relative
2932.64s: of yours struts their green bonafides. When you think about the evolution of solar do you think
2941.28s: that there comes a time where we could have enough storage capability acknowledging that that uses
2949.44s: a lot of fossil fuel to produce and maintain the storage capability. But if we do have the ability
2955.52s: to build enough storage capability that if we did set up really large solar farms that we could
2962.32s: offset a meaningful amount of fossil fuel usage. So there's a couple of ways in which it can work
2972.72s: in theory and it's important to acknowledge those because they demonstrate what's possible
2977.84s: and what's not. So Norway gets an enormous amount of its electricity from hydro.
2985.84s: And hydro is yeah they they are probably the country that has perfected their energy policy
2992.32s: more than any other. They have hydro a really green grid. They develop their oil resources for
2998.72s: export and they save the profits by developing those resources for future iterations in the
3003.12s: sovereign wealth fund in a very mature and conservative way. So Norway has enormous hydro
3012.88s: and one of the things about hydro it's relatively easy to load follow. And so hydrogen dam or
3021.12s: hydroelectric dams hydroelectric dams hydroelectric dams act as a giant battery. You can keep more water
3027.52s: behind the dam or let a little bit more water out as the ebbs and flows of the intermittency of
3032.56s: renewables demands. So that could work and to an extent it could work with some of Norway's neighbors
3040.96s: because they export electricity. But in a year of a drought they wouldn't want to export that
3044.96s: electricity and they would put their neighbors at risk if they were depending on this giant
3048.72s: battery. Now that's one snare work could work because that's a huge battery that doesn't require
3054.32s: materials. Having said that we're not going to go about damning all of these rivers in North
3059.52s: America. I think we did it in Quebec and we killed untold numbers of caribou and displaced people and
3066.48s: spoiled indigenous lands on a scale that would be impossible to imagine that anybody in the US would
3072.80s: sign up for today. So water storage behind a dam as a battery enables a certain amount of
3080.80s: intermittency renewables to be introduced into the grid with minimal description. So they see
3085.12s: that point. In a world where we make a meaningful dent on US for example we would need batteries.
3092.64s: Now there has been some instrument technologies developed that could again enable more renewables
3098.32s: which is thermal batteries which take excess electricity during times words being overproduced
3104.40s: and they stored in the form of heat in a relatively efficient way and industry could use heat.
3108.56s: So that is again an exception that proves the rule that it shows you certain narrow ways in which
3115.44s: you don't have to have expensive batteries with lithium and you know all the other metals that
3121.04s: go in them that are nickel and cobalt and so on. Where it there are scenarios where it could do
3128.48s: okay. And again in the Sun Belt it's called the Sun Belt. It makes sense to have some solar
3133.36s: and the Sun Belt. I think you could load follow a lot and your base load power plants are less
3138.64s: torqued around now if you add a bunch of wind that complicates things because the wind isn't as
3141.76s: predictable as the Sun. But there's room if you had to. Now I don't think we have to because if we
3149.84s: truly cared about carbon emissions we just build nuclear plants. But we don't. And so is there a
3156.72s: world where a certain amount of solar isn't all that disruptive and might even make a bit of sense
3161.12s: short. We're not absolutists. And might that be politically worth doing just to sort of appease
3167.60s: the carbon counters and move on and let industry do a thing maybe. But I don't see a scenario where
3174.08s: well let's put this way. One of the things we've called for and others have as well and I should
3177.36s: give credit to an outfit called the Manhattan Contrary and who writes a pretty interesting and
3182.00s: provocative blog. Why don't we just build a city of a hundred thousand people and run it just
3186.56s: on solar and batteries and wind and see how they do. Like let's do that before we decide we're
3190.72s: going to put the whole country down this path. Let's build a city and design it to run on just
3196.32s: solar and batteries with no imports from other regions like a standalone experiment. Can a city
3203.84s: of a hundred thousand people in a reasonable part of the country that gets good sun.
3209.52s: Run just on solar and batteries and what would that cost and what would the failure modes be
3214.88s: and could industry thrive there. Like I think we should do that. It doesn't even need to be
3218.32s: let's do a ten thousand person city. Like let's run the experiment before we do it on a three
3222.80s: hundred million person skip. Why won't we do that experiment? I'd like to see it as an adenio.
3229.92s: So when you think about then the future of energy obviously very firmly rooted in fossils
3241.12s: fossil fuels I should say. If you were to think about the other side of your argument
3249.84s: is there a point in time that eventually you think fossil fuels are outpaced by some sort of
3256.80s: some sort of other energies? No. I mean that'd be as simple as as look all primary energies
3265.92s: additive and if you look at the percent of global primary energy demand that has been
3270.88s: satisfied by fossil fuels is unchanged. I put a chart together the other day I haven't published
3276.64s: it yet which is the percent of primary energy satisfied by coal back to 1965. It's flat line.
3283.36s: It's a flat line. Like we set coal records and proportionally we're getting 28% of our primary energy
3289.92s: from coal. Period. We just are and we will. If you ask people that question right now. Of course.
3295.68s: How many would you ask? The US is burning the last coal. Right. Which means it's cheaper. But
3301.68s: the coal is solid. Put it on a cheap boat and you can send it all over the world at such a scale
3307.84s: that it costs nothing to ship it. Okay. We burn less coal in the US. True. So what happens to
3315.20s: that excess coal that is produced? The gating function of demand for fossil fuels is production.
3320.24s: Right. Who produces coal? Well the US produces coal and still exports it which is again not
3324.96s: something that most people know. Indonesia is a major coal producer. China, Australia,
3330.72s: Canada. All of these countries could say the Canada and the US and Australia could put a meaningful
3337.20s: dent on CO2 emissions from coal if they outlawed production. They didn't they haven't. It's a revenue
3343.44s: generator. It's a jobs creator. And since they're not burning it, wink, wink. It's not really their
3349.60s: emissions. Well, it is their emissions because the gating function of demand for fossil fuels is
3353.92s: production. Canada, the US and Australia could meaningfully dent. Global consumption of coal.
3362.56s: Now what would happen if we did that is we would see masturbation. We would see
3366.96s: grid-down scenarios in the developing world. We would see political people. We would see a catastrophe.
3374.24s: So we're not really walking. Park here, right? Like the US is a net export of coal. We produce
3381.52s: 20% of the world's oil and 25% of the world's natural gas. And we have 90 nuclear reactors and
3387.84s: all kinds of solar. And I don't see people consuming less energy because we're adding solar. We're
3392.16s: just living better lives because everybody ever wants a better life. So no, I don't think
3398.16s: again, the environmentalists are so opposed to nuclear that that's the only technology that I
3403.44s: think it really meaningfully dent things. But even then, the world has an insatiable appetite
3409.52s: for it. You look at AI. I mean, we're going to see major disruption to the world's elasticity
3414.72s: grids in the West in the coming years. I mean, it's going to happen because of demand.
3423.28s: Energy is life. AI radically improves. Some people's standard of living certainly helps with
3429.60s: our work. It's an amazing technology. And the demand for that is like saying like we're going
3437.44s: to limit the amount of iPhones. It's not going to happen. People are going to use AI. And
3444.80s: entrepreneurs are going to figure out ways to divert current energy resources to serve that by
3449.36s: offering a higher price. And that's going to price people out of the market. And that's just
3453.28s: going to create the demand for more energy. So now I had the global demand for fossil fuels is an
3459.36s: upward sloping line with a mild sort of sinusoidal wave aspect to it. It grew 1.5% last year off
3466.16s: of very large base. And if you look at the slope of that line, it's roughly 1.5 to 2% a year
3472.32s: for decades. And there's no evidence done that that trend is going to change anytime soon.
3479.28s: And anybody who claims it has already done so or thinks it will is dreaming.
3487.12s: I also think just from a behavioral standpoint, exactly as you're highlighting, it seems
3492.96s: humans in general expand to the space around them. So to your point, the probability of us
3499.44s: getting to a point where we say, OK, I'm good now with all of my energy use. I'll just
3504.64s: plateau here and stop so that we can slow down. Of course, look, we wrote a piece called a part
3509.20s: a part of the seams where we talked about how the energy crisis in Europe might blow the
3512.96s: European Union apart. And we said in the piece, like it is unpopular to force by dictate
3523.68s: that populations should voluntarily or involuntarily lower their standards of living in aggregate.
3528.64s: It's unpopular, which means the green energy transition is fundamentally incompatible with
3533.52s: democracy because elections are popularity contests. It's in the term populism. Populism is the
3540.88s: crowd's response to unpopular laws and rules imposed upon them by central planners. That's what
3548.32s: populism is. Now, the media could say it's far right. And it has to do about an immigration or
3553.36s: pick your favorite, you know, social issue. I believe it has everything to do with energy. Even
3557.36s: immigration is about energy. If you have a high degree of immigration, then the GDP per capita
3562.00s: goes down. Right. And so like there's no way like what did Joe Biden do at the first sign
3572.56s: of elevated gasoline prices in the USM to the strategic petroleum reserve ahead of the midterms?
3577.12s: This champion of the environment emptied the strategic petroleum reserves, which made gasoline
3582.32s: prices lower than it would have been, which meant the man was higher than it would have been.
3586.08s: If he was willing to lock the talk, he would have embraced $10 a gallon gasoline because in
3594.56s: some people's minds, that would have accelerated the shift to electric vehicles. He didn't.
3599.20s: He emptied the strategic petroleum reserve for political reasons. And he was
3604.32s: corrected due so as measured by the political outcome of the 2022 midterms.
3609.60s: Right. I mean, if gasoline was $6 a gallon heading into October of 2022, the Republicans would
3615.68s: be in charge of the Senate and the House by white margins. The emptied the strategic petroleum
3621.12s: reserve cut the price of oil in half, brought the price of gasoline to around $3 a gallon
3626.88s: nationwide, which is politically important and palatable. And the Democrats outperformed
3633.52s: in the midterms. I think there's a straight line. And that straight line, that example proves
3638.80s: what will happen. For example, this is a giant shale field in California called the Monterey
3644.96s: Shell that nobody knows about. And people don't even really know how much is there because nobody's
3650.32s: looking because everyone just assumes you can't really do that in California. At $300 a barrel oil,
3656.96s: we could do that California. The pressure to do so will be very, very high. So
3665.04s: ultimately, the elasticity of demand for life is infinite and energy is life. And all humans have
3673.44s: where I want to hire standard living. Even those of us in the US that are living a comparatively
3678.72s: pig-ish lifestyle compared to the six or seven billion people that are struggling to make ends
3683.12s: meet every day. I think the Btu per capita use in the US is number, amongst the large countries,
3691.20s: number one by a wide margin, a few small countries that out-consumers on a per capita basis. But
3697.44s: meaningfully, we are between four to 10 times bigger energy hogs than the average developing
3706.80s: country in a global south. Are we going to give that up? No. So I don't know. It seems like
3717.04s: an awful lot of wasted time effort and money to get to the answer that it's obvious and
3724.16s: dictated by physics. It almost goes back to that conversation we're having earlier about
3730.80s: going up multiple sources to sort out the truth, because the messaging you hear, especially
3737.04s: I'm in California, especially the message you hear here is all about how do we decrease energy
3744.00s: use and we're going green and all that stuff. But exactly as you lay out your case there,
3750.40s: it's very clear that there are lots of instances where people are having a dialogue about something
3756.08s: esoteric and then what we're doing is what we're doing. So you kind of have to collect data from
3763.12s: different sources to actually see what's going on. Yeah, I agree. Look in California is a unique case
3768.24s: for a lot of reasons. And blessed with a disproportionate amount of technology developments,
3776.56s: the Silicon Valley and a good tax base and so on. And an amazing set of resources. But you know,
3782.72s: California, as we said in our piece here recently, California has similar energy reserves,
3789.28s: oil and gas reserves to Texas. Texas is a global energy superpower and California is a
3794.48s: flaccid energy vessel. This is political choices. California benefits from Texas
3800.88s: directly and indirectly because Texas keeps the lid. The premium basin is keeping a lid
3808.72s: on global and national energy prices, oil being the former and natural gas being a lot in the US
3815.92s: as a latter. That's not anything California is done, but the Californians benefit from that.
3822.32s: That's fine. Texans benefit too because they make more money than they would if California was
3826.48s: developing the resources at the same rate. But California, the only difference between
3830.80s: California and Texas is politics, right? And so it's certainly an ideology.
3839.44s: We're about at time here, but last question I want to throw a while you was looking at the tail half
3846.56s: of this year. What are you keeping your eyes on? What's most interesting to you? I think the outcome
3852.56s: of the November election has to be top of mind. I think whether or not things escalate in Ukraine
3859.60s: or the Middle East or China also has to be top of mind. That's one of our concerns after
3864.48s: watching last night. Last night did not make such prospects less likely. I believe they made them
3869.84s: more likely. Both of those events are what we would call singularities. We're the laws of physics,
3875.04s: so the laws of economics break down. It's very difficult to model what comes on the other side of that.
3879.84s: If the US election is hotly contested in both sides or half the country believes the other
3884.72s: sides stole it, that is a risk. There's a successor risk in the US. Like the US isn't a very bad spot.
3892.48s: Like the democracy situation in the US is troubling. The disparity between the bloke and Washington
3898.64s: DC and independent minded states has never been larger except perhaps at the time of the Civil War.
3904.40s: We're understandable reasons. But we are here again today. I think Texas in particular,
3910.88s: the successor risk is a black swan event on our board of little higher than most analysts as
3916.08s: measured by probabilities. The election being a mess or war escalating are two very difficult
3927.20s: things to model what happens after you go down that path. We try our best to model the odds.
3935.28s: And hope and pray for the best. In our world, there would be an award. Everybody would have access
3942.40s: to ample amounts of energy. Humans would be allowed to flourish. It's a shame that we don't
3947.04s: live in that world and we're not, you know, not even enough to think that that's possible today.
3951.44s: But that should be the shared objective of all right-thinking people around the world.
3956.24s: Really interesting. I am so thankful for the opportunity to catch up with you again and thank
3964.32s: you so much for taking the time to share your perspective. I obviously will throw a link
3969.28s: to your sub-stack in the video description. Is there anywhere else you want people to be able to
3974.96s: look out for you? Yeah, the primary gate portal into all things duneberg is duneberg.com now.
3980.64s: We managed to acquire that domain name and objective of squatter from it.
3985.60s: For a really stupid price, but you know, or tidy some I bet. Yes, by you know, the market value of duneberg.com
3993.84s: grew as testimony to our work, I suppose, and so in a way it was a compliment, but it was a painful one.
3999.28s: Yeah, duneberg.com you'll find all of our written work, our pro tier. We have two tiers. We have
4003.84s: our subscribers who get our articles and then our pro tier get an extra webinar a month. We
4008.24s: just published our webinar on American Road Trip, a comprehensive tour of the US shale resources,
4014.32s: which was very well received. And then all of our podcast appearances, including this one,
4018.96s: you will find a link to all of them there. But look, Eric always enjoyed talking to you at the
4022.96s: hour. Just flies by. I'm happy to come back any of the time. You'll have me and I really enjoyed it
4026.72s: today. Awesome. Thank you so much. We'll catch you guys next time.
