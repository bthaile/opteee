0.00s: Hey everyone, Eric here.
2.16s: Somebody submitted a really good question.
4.80s: So figured we'd do a quick video on it.
7.56s: I realize that this is a little bit missized.
9.88s: Let's change that while we're on here.
11.36s: Perfect.
12.20s: So here's a deal.
13.56s: The question is on the screen here.
15.32s: I'll summarize it as always to make it a little easier
17.68s: to follow along.
18.88s: Essentially this person, whose name is also Eric,
21.60s: spelled with a K, which is exactly why I made sure
24.68s: to get to this question because they have a super dope name.
28.48s: But essentially they're saying that they came across
30.52s: a zero days to expiration SPX strategy.
35.48s: And this is a really common trade that's popping up more.
41.16s: And if you remember, this is actually one that I also personally
45.36s: tested.
46.52s: And there is a lot of hype around them
51.00s: because they're so appealing.
52.36s: It's just like anything else with money
55.28s: when you see things that seem really cool or advantageous
60.20s: or anything like that, it tends to draw a lot of attention.
63.60s: It's no different here.
65.12s: If I could tell you that you can make $1,000 in one day
69.16s: or 30 days, which one sounds better to you, one day.
72.92s: So that's really what this is playing on
75.36s: is people's lack of patience, essentially,
80.00s: where we think that if we can continue to make whatever
84.96s: amount of profit daily that we're going to be better off
88.52s: than if we establish a longer term trade.
91.08s: And to give a bottom line upfront bluff response to it,
96.80s: it's not as good as it sounds.
98.44s: And like I said, I tried it.
100.24s: This is a strategy that I wanted to work.
103.00s: And I found a hybrid of this strategy
106.52s: to be far more effective.
108.60s: Whereas instead of doing zero days to expiration,
111.96s: I will do something closer to seven or nine days
115.76s: with slightly different mechanics.
117.88s: And that performed significantly better for me
121.12s: than this zero days to expiration trade.
124.32s: So let's walk through the general setup
127.04s: just for those who aren't familiar with the trade.
129.48s: Generally speaking, people will trade the larger indices,
133.80s: SPX, NDX, things like that simply because they're larger.
138.64s: So you don't need to put on as many trades
140.84s: or as many contracts to still earn a decent amount of money.
144.72s: And the reason why that's so important
146.28s: is because most folks will trade this at a very low delta.
151.36s: As you can see, what they have highlighted here,
153.96s: something close to a five or 10 delta.
156.32s: So if we take a look at that,
158.48s: it technically would be a little bit lower
160.16s: than what you're seeing here,
161.16s: because this is for a one day.
163.32s: It should be a zero day.
164.40s: But nonetheless, if we look at a five delta,
167.60s: you're looking at something close to 90 cents
170.12s: on the index.
172.12s: And don't forget, it's a spread.
174.80s: So typically we're going to go out pretty far
177.76s: to buy something further out.
179.52s: And then you're really walking away with $0.55
183.68s: if you get hit at the mid.
185.28s: So that's why most folks will trade an index of some sort
189.92s: so that they can still collect some money
194.08s: without having to trade as many contracts.
197.36s: So the other thing that draws people to this trade,
200.60s: obviously the short duration is their limited risk.
204.48s: A lot of folks think and perceive limited risk
207.72s: because it is a spread, which is factual.
210.60s: Anything that's spread off like this
212.32s: will have limited risk.
214.88s: The reason why I say perceived
216.92s: is because there are some issues with that limited risk.
221.04s: And really, we'll get into that a little bit later,
223.80s: but what it's going to come down to is
227.32s: most will have that spread set up
230.72s: and most will not be willing to risk the entire spread.
235.76s: So most will set some sort of stop on top of that spread.
241.68s: So the spread serves is like, oh shit,
243.76s: if things go really, really sideways,
245.60s: that's my max loss.
247.48s: But then most folks will also set a stop on top of that
250.96s: so that they can have something
252.40s: returning a little closer to their profile.
255.00s: And what I mean by that is if we take a look again at this,
259.20s: let's go a little further out to at least make some money.
262.12s: Let's take a look at selling this 3460
265.68s: and then we'll buy something that's, you know,
268.72s: a lot of folks will do something like $50 fly.
271.20s: So something like this 3410.
273.16s: So in this trade, we'll make $1.55.
275.48s: And if we pull this over to an analyze,
280.64s: let me give it a my other trade.
282.76s: So for this trade and I have portfolio margins,
287.08s: so my margin requirements can be lower than folks who don't.
290.84s: The requirement for one of these trades for me is $4,800.
296.64s: So our max profit is 155.
300.08s: And then as we start decreasing our max loss skyrocket,
303.80s: it's very quickly.
305.24s: So if we zoom this out just a little bit more
308.32s: so that we can get some more numbers down here,
310.40s: what you see on the screen right here
312.16s: are our plus one and minus one standard deviation moves.
316.76s: So one of the things that people really like about this trade
321.64s: is that it starts seemingly very deep in the profit zone,
325.96s: whereas you would need a fairly meaningful move
328.60s: for it to fall out of profit.
330.84s: The problem with this is once you start adding the stop,
337.04s: you actually don't get this entire buffer.
340.36s: You know where the break even is on the spread.
342.08s: You're gonna get stopped out somewhere closer
344.12s: to where you're at maybe around here.
345.96s: And we'll explore that.
347.52s: Now the other thing I wanna highlight
349.12s: is the overall expectancy for the trade.
351.88s: You all can calculate it on your own.
353.52s: I've shared the formula, but if you take a look,
355.92s: this is $155 max profit.
359.28s: Max loss on this trade is $4,845.
363.40s: So we are risking a whole lot to make very little.
367.16s: And again, most folks don't just trade a one lot on these.
371.44s: They'll try to size it up at least five, 10 lot,
374.56s: something like that so that you can make
376.08s: some sort of actual money that would make $775.
379.92s: But then again, your max risk if it does go that way
383.04s: is $24,225.
386.36s: So that's why I say the spread is really an illusion
391.52s: in that most people are using it simply for buying power reduction
395.04s: because a lot of these accounts can't support
398.04s: taking the naked risk because if you were to just sell the puts,
401.16s: you would need $212,000 in margin.
404.56s: So first off, just like any other conversation I've had,
409.32s: if you can trade this strategy or a similar style strategy
414.36s: and not use the spread, you're gonna be far better off.
417.72s: You're gonna be safer not having to give any of that money back
422.20s: and just using the stop.
424.24s: So that's kind of the first no on that limited risk.
426.88s: For most people, it's simply a buying power reduction tool
430.60s: as compared to truly minimizing your risk.
433.68s: The other thing to remember is when we use a spread,
436.20s: our expectancy in and of itself changes quite a bit,
439.28s: especially when you choose to manage the spread.
443.80s: And I have quite a few videos on that as well.
447.80s: So the other thing that I have on here
452.12s: is the perceived margin of safety.
455.24s: And I was just kind of discussing that in some capacity
457.84s: when we look at the spread.
460.04s: But the most important point that I wanted to drive home
463.44s: on that component is the fact that if you set a stop,
469.48s: you're gonna find yourself in kind of much higher probability
474.16s: of being hit.
474.96s: So let's explore the overall probabilities on this trade.
479.36s: So first, let's say where is the earliest max loss realized?
484.36s: Let's call it 34-07.
489.56s: We'll call it 34-07, you're pretty much at max loss.
493.32s: So if we go to the probability analysis
495.44s: and we go to a one day trade, so that would be tomorrow,
502.56s: the probability of it going to 34-07 is something close
507.88s: to the fucking probability is off the goddamn.
512.64s: It's off the chart, that's kind of annoying.
517.76s: So the probability of it going to 34-07
520.68s: is something close to 10-11%, something like that.
525.52s: So it's 11% probability that you're gonna realize
529.48s: that max loss on the trade, which is still pretty high.
533.12s: Now, what again, what most people do is they'll set a stop
536.48s: two times your credit received, two and a half times your credit
538.88s: received, three times your credit received,
540.36s: something like that.
541.44s: Statistically, what I found for my seven days
544.04s: to expiration trade two and a half was the magic number for me.
548.04s: So if we received a dollar 55,
552.72s: that's gonna put a somewhere close to $5.43 for the spread.
557.64s: So that means that we would put a stop
560.00s: when this spread is trading somewhere close to $5.43.
567.08s: So we can take a look at that and notice this purple line,
574.08s: this is telling us today what this thing would be trading for.
578.00s: So again, if we're looking at a dollar 55
582.64s: and we're gonna allow that to expand to around $5.43,
587.64s: there are a few ways we can estimate that.
589.56s: First one is you can use this, which is a very reasonable tool.
593.20s: You can just see where that loss would occur.
597.44s: Again, to make this a little easier,
599.20s: you can zoom it down to a one-law.
601.64s: So you can see where you would be at $543 on your max loss,
606.88s: which would occur somewhere around $34.76,
611.20s: call it $34.78, because there's a higher probability as well
615.44s: that if the underlying is moving down like that,
617.76s: buying power expansion is going to occur.
619.92s: So let's call it $34.78.
622.04s: We go to our probability analysis.
623.80s: Let's take a look at the probability of seeing $34.78
628.04s: and you are much closer to 40%.
632.48s: It's looking like it'll be $38 or so.
636.84s: The reason why I have it off the date
638.52s: is because when I put it on the date itself,
640.44s: if fucking is off the chart,
643.48s: like I can't actually see the percentage,
645.40s: which is super annoying, but it is what it is.
648.60s: But you get the point.
649.48s: So it's about a 40% chance, just shy of a 40% chance
655.76s: of getting stopped out at your stop
658.68s: if you're using two and a half times credit received.
661.36s: So what that means is 60% of the time,
664.36s: you'll make something close to your max profit of $155.
669.28s: And then so more close to 40% of the time,
671.80s: you are going to lose that $500 in $43
674.96s: on that zero-day-stakes variation trade.
677.12s: You can work that out yourself,
678.60s: but again, you see the issue with the trade.
682.20s: Okay, so we already talked about the allure
684.32s: in some capacity, it's quick money.
685.88s: So it's just, anytime you see that,
688.08s: you need to approach with the skeptical mind.
691.36s: So we've been walking through the constraints
695.12s: as I was walking through the general setup
696.92s: and kind of correlating it to the trade off.
699.80s: In general, this trade does not work very well
703.88s: when the market is too sided.
706.84s: If we have a floating bull market like we did,
710.96s: this strategy works very well.
713.24s: I used it myself for some time during the bull market,
716.56s: but my biggest recommendation,
718.64s: this isn't like a set it and forget it,
720.52s: this is your one-trec pony,
722.16s: you can do this one trade
723.84s: and be successful into perpetuity, this isn't that.
726.92s: It is very much conditional.
729.00s: So setting up different environments
731.92s: where you will employ this trade
734.32s: becomes increasingly important,
736.04s: particularly the shorter the timeframe.
737.76s: That's why I like the seven to nine data exploration
740.20s: because that allows me a little bit more of a buffer
743.48s: for some movement in the underlying itself
746.40s: so I don't exit the trade too frequently.
749.72s: Because most of these trades will work out,
752.76s: but it's also gonna test your pain tolerance.
754.96s: If you see something that your max profit is $775
760.16s: and you're looking at a $15,000 loss temporarily,
763.36s: that's not easy.
764.52s: Not to mention again,
765.44s: that most would be stopped out before that point.
768.88s: So in general, this is an interesting strategy.
772.48s: It is definitely conditional,
774.36s: it's useful in kind of perpetual bull markets,
778.00s: but again, the biggest drawdown in that
780.44s: is there's no volatility.
781.68s: So you really can't make a lot of money on the trade,
783.88s: you have to size up even more
786.00s: on top of a really wide spread
787.52s: or if you're trading naked
789.20s: and then you have to deal with the fallout from that.
793.24s: In general, I think that it is a, again,
797.04s: a fun one to paper trade.
798.44s: If you set good criteria around it,
801.36s: it is absolutely one that I would revisit in the future
804.76s: if my certain circumstances are met.
807.20s: But the seven day, seven to nine day version
810.20s: that I employ is a lot more utilitarian
813.48s: and it has a far better expectancy than what you see here.
817.12s: So the punchline is anybody that is selling this trade
821.04s: as the end all be all one trick pony
823.84s: or this is a super successful strategy,
826.36s: it's just statistically not there.
828.92s: So if that is the case for them,
831.40s: there's likely other things they're doing on top of it,
834.48s: whatever that looks like, I don't wanna dive too far
837.36s: into other folks strategies simply
839.48s: because I don't know them well enough to comment on all of it.
843.36s: But I am sharing my personal experience testing this
846.40s: because I was interested in it myself.
849.24s: I tend to accept higher probability, higher risk trades
856.84s: because it's a higher probability.
858.80s: That doesn't scare me off per se.
861.00s: But there is a balance.
862.40s: And in general, this trade does not hit that balance.
865.44s: So I really like this conversation.
867.36s: This is a fun one to check out.
869.20s: If anybody else has anything else they want me to take a look
872.20s: at in terms of strategy or trades, send them in.
874.76s: That's kind of a fun thing to take a look at
877.20s: and talk to folks about and I will catch everybody later.
