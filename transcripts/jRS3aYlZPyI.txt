0.00s: What's up, outliers? Welcome back to the
4.14s: Alar podcast. We have David Hunter back for our
8.18s: quarterly or so catch up to talk about the
10.98s: latest in the world. I think a couple things
12.98s: that have happened. We started seeing a bunch of
15.18s: rare earth fights, more terrifying fights. We've
19.52s: been seeing increased activity in South America
23.26s: off the coast there. We have a government shutdown.
26.26s: So we have gold going through the roof. I
28.86s: imagine there's got to be a lot of things on
30.42s: your radar right now. So I'm really interested
33.02s: to see first to start us off like a general
37.46s: overview of how you things have progressed
40.06s: from the last time we spoke until now, which is
42.14s: probably about three months ago. Yeah, I are
44.90s: great to you. Yeah, it's we're snowing what I
49.20s: considered the last leg of a 43 years
52.58s: secular bullmark and the leg really began
56.06s: back in that April soon when we had
58.70s: liberation day and it's been you know,
61.98s: the S&B's up I think 46% since then. So since
67.10s: we talked in July, it's you know, it's
69.42s: run further. It just keeps plugging away.
72.62s: My as a man asked me today because I've been
75.38s: saying we're in the parabolic or you know,
77.82s: probably are in the parabolic and I think
81.30s: people see it kind of trend sideways for
84.02s: trade sideways for a looping and it's like
87.90s: that can't be the parabolic and I go, you
90.10s: got to wait for this thing to finish when you
92.42s: go back and look, you'll see the slope is, you
95.86s: know, a steep and it's basically we're in the
98.34s: final steepest leg of this long bull market.
103.46s: I it's amazing. All the things you listed off
106.90s: are things that should trouble the market and
109.10s: you're at the market basically at all time
112.18s: eyes and shows no signs of slowing down.
114.98s: You know, of course you get a little back tracking.
118.18s: The semi has just got hit a little bit this week.
121.54s: And they seem to be a start to move up again.
126.98s: You know, industrial look, good, the finance area.
131.14s: You know, if I have some questions about credit,
135.54s: but I think that's more one off things. They don't
139.54s: look systemic to me and from what I've heard, it's
143.38s: more fraught in a couple of instances. I hit a couple
146.34s: regional banks. So I think financials look good,
151.62s: industrial look good. I think even some of the consumer
155.86s: area is going to start as it has rates come down here.
159.30s: I think you're going to see housing pick up a little bit.
162.10s: Not that's often races for a long cycle, but for the next
166.18s: two or three months, you could see pretty good trades
170.42s: and in consumer stocks, consumer discretionary areas.
175.54s: GM had a pretty good performance recently.
179.86s: So I think you are seeing across the board, some broadening out in the market.
185.22s: Small caps have done very well in the last several months.
189.14s: They've out before M.S. and P from last April.
192.50s: And I think they are, you know, hitting much higher.
195.78s: So market looks good. You know, you're going to have some
200.18s: backing and filling every once in a while as it gets ahead of itself.
203.86s: But frankly, my number in July, I think we talked
208.42s: right after that. My number in July was 8700 and then in my
215.70s: September actually October letter. My raise my target again to
220.82s: 9,500 on the S&P. So from 87 to 9,500 in just a few months,
227.14s: that's how bullish I am. I raised my NASDAQ target 32,000 raised my
233.38s: the Altarget 65,000 from 60 and raised my Russell target from
239.70s: I think it was 3400 to 3800. So I've gotten even more bullish
245.38s: and the biggest bull on street, I guess. But it just looks to me like we've got
250.18s: legs here. So, you know, I hear people worrying and
255.94s: concerned about our tariffs coming back on the, you know, the
259.94s: worry wagon or, you know, are we going to have problems in terms of
265.06s: Ukraine, etc. I just looks like steady as we go here and more than
273.46s: steady, probably pretty sharp rally from here into the
277.22s: Iran, the maybe beyond. When you think of the current work
283.14s: it positioned as you noted, there's a lot going on that might be
289.78s: interpreted as trouble as things slowing down. I'm generally interested in
295.54s: your take on how the market behaves at points like this is compared to
301.30s: prior highs. My brain typically looks at it as
305.14s: or definitely hovering around highs now. The market is hit new highs in
310.50s: previous periods and I'm always curious like what were the conditions when we
314.02s: hit those highs? What did things look like? Very often it does seem like
319.22s: conditions looked at least moderately better than they do now. There's a lot
324.58s: going for the market especially through
327.30s: deregulation technological advancements and stuff like AI so they're definitely
331.54s: or tailwinds for sure big tailwinds but then there's also some decent
335.78s: headwinds. How do you think the market is posting highs here?
342.02s: And do you think that it is like what do you think the primary driver is of it?
350.66s: We're in a very strange period because in some ways you can look at that
355.30s: this as almost the beginning of a cycle. Now we're at all five highs with
362.42s: huge runs. Certainly we're up big from 3500 and October of 2022 so we're
370.50s: approaching a double and yet I can look at the market in some ways
376.02s: saying because the Fed is beginning a new easing cycle, the street and because
382.98s: the institutional investor fought this thing all the way up.
387.46s: They are now starting to warm up to the market. They missed almost the double in the
392.58s: market, didn't miss it because they're in stocks but they were skeptical of this
396.74s: thing all the way up and they're getting more bullish here.
400.74s: That's the unusual situation. I mean that's not where we normally would be at all
405.46s: time highs but we are. Even though a little cell-off we've had in the last week
410.58s: particularly in the metals but in the market too some used to get stuck back etc.
418.34s: Even that caused the wall worry to climb again. The institutional investor is just starting to
425.46s: jump on the formal wagon and say we miss this but it looks like it's going to run and that
431.38s: all of a sudden you get a little week. That's not very much but a couple of percent and they're
437.78s: right back to worrying again. The sentiment is unusual because at all time highs you usually see
444.74s: the sentiment as way too bullish and right now it's still very skeptical, still very cautious
451.78s: and we've got the Fed. My thing is pretty obvious the Fed is beginning. It wasn't a one-off
458.26s: break we're going to see several break cuts in the months ahead and in fact you know polls you
464.02s: can talk about the end of QT and the polling money out. Those things are typically things you see
475.22s: after a market sold off you're a bear market bottom or certainly a correction bottom and you're
481.54s: getting the beginnings of a market. We're at all time highs and far beyond what almost anybody
489.06s: saw coming except me and so it's a very unusual time but I think what you can see in the months
495.62s: ahead meaning the next two or three months certainly and maybe a little longer is a sentiment moved
503.22s: towards the Fed is beginning and a long easing cycle that could carry this market for a couple of years
510.58s: and so I think that's what's going to pull a lot of people back in from the sidelines or get them
516.02s: to move from a defensive position to a more aggressive stock position. Retails bend there since April
524.10s: they've been really driving this I think they'll continue to get on board so it doesn't mean you're
531.38s: without risk. They're certainly risk in there and certainly I think we are moving towards a global bus
538.10s: next year so it's a really funny period where things look like they can run
545.30s: 30 or 40% upside in the market from here and yet still have a situation where
555.54s: the other side of the mountain isn't very far away. What do you make of the moving goals?
564.26s: Yeah I'm not in the camp that says gold is signaling some big event because frankly I'm looking
576.10s: for a big event next year you know global bus the worst financial crisis in maybe history
583.22s: but certainly the worst downturn in 80 to 90 years it's great to pressure in a lot of ways
588.82s: bigger than 2008 so I'm looking for something like that. I don't think that's what the gold
594.90s: sniffing out. I think gold is sniffing out that the dollar is even though it's been strong of late
602.50s: the dollar is basically headed lower. I think gold is sniffing out that there's
608.10s: you know there's certainly still turmoil geopolitically out there with Ukraine and Russia and
613.62s: we're not sure what's going to come out of Gaza. I think gold is more than anything
620.66s: probably technically strong and so it brings in a lot of buyers. I think that's
627.46s: everybody tries to make you know try to read so much into these moves but gold broke out and
634.10s: it's continued to be very strong and when you look at the charts it looks very strong and the
639.38s: institutions again have very little gold. I mean the central banks am buying it but
645.86s: institutional investors did not help okay to gold you know they said oh no it's you know it's
651.14s: not really where we want to be it's yeah and now you're starting to hear just in the last month
657.06s: some big investors saying you should have 10 or 20% of your portfolio gold because of the momentum
662.74s: I mean they can come up with the rationale but why are they interested in it because it's up
669.62s: and that's I think the momentum's going to be get momentum and you can see a lot higher I raised my target
675.70s: on gold in my October letter from 45,000 and that's a pre bus target so the next three to six
683.94s: months I raised my target on silver from 75 to 100 I was already pretty high on the street at 75
693.70s: and I raised it 200 and again in that same timeframe so they're particularly strong they have
701.06s: big run that obviously got hit very hard this week I see this is nothing more than when you're in a
708.50s: steep rally your corrections are also steep what I call short and sharp and I think we I think
717.46s: we probably have seen the full correction already it's possible you could get us a good
723.70s: shoe dropping but more than likely that that event on what was one day or two is day was was all you're
732.50s: going to get speaking of the event on well recent events but yeah speaking of near-term
740.74s: volatility I found it really interesting I was running a study on shorter duration
746.90s: index realized volatility obviously I'm an option of straighter so I spent a lot of time looking
751.70s: at forward ball but I find it really interesting to see volatility on average is increased pretty
761.46s: massively over the last decade or so just on average and this isn't looking at necessarily
769.62s: vix outright which again is more forward but looking at realized ranges what do you make of that
776.90s: effect just this general change in the way that the market seems to react to information
784.26s: and it seems like it can really get pretty jittery off of just about anything and then it's kind
790.42s: of like trying to attach a talking point to it right like a Zion bank had a couple you know fraudulent
797.14s: credit lines that they're mitigating for so now financials crater it seems really really
805.46s: volatile comparatively to 10 15 years ago yeah well you're talking to somebody who back in
812.42s: in the early years of my point for the management times you know we didn't get news
819.86s: so quickly and I was you know I was just a social money manager but we didn't even have
824.66s: quote machines on our desk you know I had to go out and all the look at one and it was really a time
832.18s: when you poured through you got I think you and they came quarterly there was a technical analysis
839.46s: service out of Boston that said a bound book of charts and it came once a quarter and you poured
846.58s: through those because it was fun to look at the look for stocks you know all that stuff set your
851.94s: fingertips today so and it's at the retail investors fingertips and there's you know the the
859.22s: retail brokers have all kinds of trading tools that you can use etc there's trading services out there
867.14s: the news is is right there to the minute you know you can get it on Twitter you can get it on
872.42s: Bloomberg you can get it somewhere else so you know for somebody who kind of grew up in the time when
879.22s: we really weren't so attached to news it has this been happening all at once you know it's been
884.82s: getting faster and faster but it's also I think because of where we are in the cycle you know you're
891.70s: you're so late in the cycle and it's been literally 43 years in a bull market the
897.14s: cycle of bull market cycle and certainly you know a long stretch from 2008-19 even though we did have
906.02s: a short bear market in 2022 I just think it's the nature of the beast and as you get steeper
912.90s: you're going to see more volatility you know in a lot of ways if you remember there was a lot of
917.86s: talk about how there was so little volatility just a year ago or whatever and it was just kind of
924.98s: almost every day it was up I think it's we're going to see volatility in a big way over the next year
933.14s: you know it was one thing I will say is the fix the way the fix acted here while the market was moving up
940.42s: the fix was moving up and that's unusual and I'm not sure exactly what that was about you probably
946.34s: have a better handle on that than I do but I you know I don't read too much into that I don't think it
953.06s: means danger sign I just think you know volatility has gotten at least the fix index has gotten so low
961.38s: and when we got a little nervous in a scenario it translates pretty quickly into the fix.
967.06s: It's actually really funny because when I was looking at the analysis a big thing that I that I compare
973.54s: is variance was premiums so the relationship between implied vault over looking then realize
979.46s: all what what's happened and it is ironic because realized vault is trended high and VIX
987.78s: forward looking vault specifically for S&P is trended low so we find ourselves in this very
995.46s: weird scenarios I definitely actually spend a lot of my time trading vault because it
1000.82s: is at least to me that can be a little bit more predictable than other stuff but I the other thing
1007.14s: I find really interesting and what your thoughts are on our the correlation between
1013.78s: specifically gold but I would say metals in general and the indices a lot of people build port folios
1021.62s: on these really long term standard relationships that sometimes can get skewed but what do you think
1028.98s: of the relationship right now between gold and S&P or you know pick it index of your choice?
1034.82s: Yeah because we have talked pretty much quarterly for the last year anyway and talk for last
1041.06s: couple of two or three years but but quarterly really this year I think you know I've been pretty
1047.38s: consistent saying everybody thinks stocks and the metals have to move opposite or stocks and
1054.66s: gold have to move opposite or inverse relationships and I've consistently said what we're going to
1060.34s: see in this last run to the top is that they're all going to play stocks are going to play the metals
1066.74s: are going to play the bonds are going to play another thing everybody so the bond market
1073.38s: move up when the stock market moves down they should know you're going to have rates coming down
1078.18s: the metal propel stock market it also propel the metal's market and that's what I think you're seeing
1083.54s: I think you can see it in the space here in a much bigger way in the next few months I mean
1089.94s: I'm expecting that 10 year to fall to 3% or below in the next 3 or 6 months
1096.26s: probably closer to 3 but I don't know and the metals you know I think my target could be hit
1102.90s: as early as January you know $100 on silver 5,000 gold maybe even sooner you know if it really
1110.18s: gets going here so so I think you're going to see what we've seen in recent months is only going to
1116.90s: get more dramatic and obviously my stock market calls for the signal parabolic and basically vertical
1126.42s: now another thing I'm interested in I don't know what kind of analysis you've done
1132.42s: in a relationship you have with it but the concept of government shutdowns generally just
1137.54s: interesting to me I experienced one when I was on active duty which was very entertaining
1144.18s: because the beautiful part is like when you're marine it's just like shut up bitch go to work like
1148.42s: no one here nobody cares but you know being on the other side of it
1155.38s: you start to realize like there's interesting impacts that actually start to trickle through to a
1162.10s: lot of different things do you think that the government shutdown has potential impact on your
1169.54s: broader analysis or is that kind of secluded to its own little sphere expected to stay under the
1176.18s: long-term average the long-term maximum which is 35 days the average is much shorter than that
1182.74s: or do you think that there could be more interplay yeah we're coming up a lot of months now I think so
1188.18s: it's getting to you know long in the tooth type of based on history you know it surprises me
1197.06s: because I don't think the Democrats gain anything out of this and you know you have a continue
1202.58s: resolution so that they can continue talking it really tells me the Democrats don't have any
1209.46s: leverage anywhere else so they're doing doing something I think is suicide but you know the
1215.78s: Republicans push the bill today to pay those that are at work you know all the so-called unnecessary
1224.02s: workers who are not essentials are are not going to get paid but they said we'll pay everybody else
1231.70s: and I think it pretty much was by party lines and all the Democrats voted against it almost all of them
1238.02s: I mean how does that look here what are you gaining because you know a continuing resolution is
1244.98s: just to keep the government functioning while you continue to negotiate whatever your differences are
1250.98s: and what what the Democrats are trying to do is undo the you know the big beautiful bill that you know
1260.42s: yes you guys lost the election you don't have a you know the Republicans although it's
1266.90s: slam have a majority in both houses and they have the presidency so of course your agenda is not the
1273.38s: one that's that's playing right now we tell you win election and you can you can do your thing
1279.38s: but but they as keeps being repeated I think by the Republican side you know this is this is
1286.50s: Schumer basically cow-towing to the O.C. you know this is this is the far left taking
1293.46s: holding the rest of the Democrats hostage and makes no sense but you know they can be
1300.34s: irrational for a while just like markets can I guess so yeah I'm not sure I am not at least at this
1308.10s: point thinking it's gonna alter the markets whatsoever it certainly hasn't yet and I think the
1315.94s: Democrats run the risk that what I'm not sure where it's at right now but a rest of all
1323.06s: the rest of all in the was one that basically was pushing the idea that we can we can because they're
1332.10s: giving us this because they won't play ball we have the ability to actually have permanent layoffs
1339.78s: you know we can we can cut government and Republicans would like nothing more you know we have
1346.50s: huge deficits we have huge debt problems and so if the Democrats want to play that game I think they
1354.18s: are gonna run the risk of losing a lot of their government workers that are basically Democrat
1361.78s: yeah the political side of it is it really is always interesting to see especially I always find
1367.46s: the starting point at least of both sides completely and directly blaming the other
1374.34s: you look at that and you're like okay this is not gonna go smooth there's no smooth sailing
1379.54s: when both is like not buck this other guy so it's like okay well we'll see how that circus goes
1384.82s: the the interplay with markets is really really interesting to me because in the beginning when
1391.54s: it first happened the market reacted we saw not a lot of change involved but a small a very small
1398.74s: change and then that's just about been fully abated by now and I'm really really curious if there
1406.66s: is a tipping point where at some point this this effect being the shutdown does have some sort of
1415.54s: impact I have very little historical reference I didn't analysis of literally all prior shutdowns
1421.86s: there's just not that many of them and there's a lot of stuff that was going on in most of them
1426.26s: and most of them were like five days or less yep it's just very little like and extract from it
1431.70s: from a data lens from a more global lens if the shutdown eventually whenever that is resolved
1442.66s: one thing I did notice is that almost every single time it resulted in a up day in the market
1450.02s: on the day of reopening almost always do you think that when the government does eventually reopen
1458.34s: does that provide a tailwind for the pairbalk move up or again is that completely desperate
1465.30s: it probably has more interest to you guys on the trading side you know to me anything it does
1473.70s: day to day doesn't matter to me and it's just whatever it is I don't think it really matters a
1481.06s: lot to the bigger picture obviously if if they can never reach an agreement and then things start
1488.82s: really hitting the fan in terms of you know people not being able to get food people not being able to
1496.74s: get paid and their bills are being paid etc you know somewhere along the line if they are that
1503.62s: they are if the Democrats are that irrational you know a bit rough but I don't think that's the story
1509.70s: I think we'll see something probably not until November which isn't very far away now but you know
1517.46s: what is different this time is it's usually the Republicans are shutting the government down or the
1522.18s: Republicans who are trying to have some leverage and in this case Democrats have no leverage and
1530.90s: yet they this is all they've got in their mind and maybe they don't care if they mess up the economy
1536.98s: because they'll think they're hurting Trump that's what it feels like to me is this is all more of
1542.10s: the Trump's arrangements in their own type stuff you know but in the end to me since I don't think
1548.58s: it's really holding the market back now it's hard for me to argue that when they when they do open
1553.54s: up it's going to have some big effect on the upside yeah I think that logically flows with the
1561.94s: regional banks we what you alluded to it a little bit earlier but there were two different banks
1569.38s: that had dealings with an entity that seemingly is committing fraud to some degree the regional
1577.78s: banks obviously well the really exile f in general just the entire financial sector had a pretty big
1583.86s: negative reaction to that in anticipation of more widespread it looks to be contained but did that
1592.10s: reaction mean anything to you did the way that the market reacted there highlight anything about
1600.26s: positioning risk tolerance that leads into your broader thesis longer term what I would say is
1608.42s: that it had it did no technical damage to the charts when I look at a KLA when I look at the banking
1615.54s: indexes everything looks fine and bullish the brokers look you know stock brokers look bullish
1622.58s: I just don't see on the horizon the warning signs that were there and this is from the guy that
1628.74s: believes next year is going to be all hill breaks loose but it's just not there yet you know there are
1635.62s: there are warning signs you know you're seeing some primal downloads to winquincey rates or I think
1641.86s: it all time eyes you know you're seeing you know problems in private credit they're beginning to see
1649.86s: strains but nothing other you like you say what we had this book the market really look like a one-off
1657.94s: it was fraud it was you know a couple banks it is not systemic at this point I think we'll move
1665.86s: towards the systemic but it's probably still several months away I think the point I was
1671.22s: alluding to there and wondering if this factor is in the the fact that the market reacted that negatively
1678.74s: to that small of a thing to me leads me to believe that when your your thesis if and when it plays out
1688.02s: much bigger gravity I can only imagine the kind of reaction that that would spur if this small
1695.70s: isolated thing caused what it did well I think you saw here is and I view this is a bullish ironically
1704.18s: but what you saw here is how I'd let's say for a long time you know institutional investors in
1710.42s: particular have one foot out the door you know they've been nervous all the way up they never thought
1716.10s: this was a bull market coming out of 22 they thought it was a bear market rally when I went to new
1721.70s: highs it said yeah but the valuations are too high for it to have legs so they've been really
1727.86s: behind the able on this all the way up and they've been nervous about you know maybe maybe
1733.22s: he's because I've been talking to goalable bus for several years but there's there's enough
1738.26s: nervousness out there that they viewed this as confirmation that we're in trouble you know there's
1744.50s: there's still a huge wall of worry of people who you know institutions investors who think
1753.38s: do at least I think institutional investors think more like my scenario for next year
1759.54s: but certainly Trump administration isn't thinking that way Congress isn't seeing that the
1766.34s: Fed isn't seeing that so the people the policymakers are have nothing like that on their radar
1772.82s: but that doesn't mean the institutions don't I think yeah sell side wall street doesn't have that
1777.78s: on their radar really but I think there are plenty of institutional portfolio managers who do
1784.42s: worry that there's you know there's warning signs of something bigger that you know we're just
1789.30s: so over leveraged et cetera so I think what they what they got from the Zion this thing
1796.82s: was something that sparked a confirmation in their mind that oh yeah see we're not far away from
1803.46s: this thing all coming undone but I view that as bullish because that just shows how skittish they
1810.50s: still are you know how how sentiment is still very much on the bearer side they had to be in the market
1819.46s: because they fought it for so long and in the momentum was killing their performance that they were out
1824.66s: so they're they're not out but they're not in there with any kind of bullishness more and that's
1832.26s: change yeah I mean they are getting more bullish but there's they're just nowhere near what I call
1837.38s: the all-in sentiment that you're going to see at the top that's that's probably the biggest reason
1842.58s: why I raise my targets there's just still a huge wall of worry out there I see yeah I follow
1850.34s: you had mentioned before you know about the global bust and you definitely have been
1856.98s: been talking about it for a while at least since you and I have connected as the timeline for it shifts
1864.74s: is there a conditional environment that would lead you to no longer believe that the bust is on the
1872.58s: horizon yeah it's not really time driven I mean what I said long is when this cycle ends it will
1882.18s: end in global bust a global bust is something we haven't seen in 90 years so the fact that it stretches
1889.86s: and goes a few years beyond in the scheme of 90 years you know it's something that rare it's just not
1896.74s: going to be a precise point in time it's not there's no deadline and there's no what I what
1904.26s: it's could happen maybe is if the Trump administration policy has really proved
1911.62s: so successful that all that money coming in from overseas you know investment in this country
1918.18s: you know getting tariffs to kind of level the playing field and trade arena
1923.94s: well if all those things offset what I think is a coming recession that morphs into a bust
1931.94s: then that's what would change my mind or that's what would shift the the reality of what we get but
1940.10s: I don't have any sense that that's the case yet I really believe that we are as I say
1948.18s: it's the huge leverage far beyond 2008 and nine far beyond anything we've ever seen in the
1954.74s: world before in terms of 330 trillion and debt you know quadrillions and no shall value of derivatives
1963.14s: that that morning anything else is why I think you've got a recession that morphs into something
1968.74s: far worse and then you still have under the surface a lot of fragility I mean there's just
1976.66s: we can look at the fact that you know so so called GDP now estimates are at 3.8% for the fourth
1986.02s: quarter you know I think we're we're going to go back and pretty date this period now and say we
1992.34s: started the recession before this that's the engine saying if you're talking about the close to 4%
1997.22s: GDP but under the surface they're just again that's a have and have not economy and they have
2004.34s: not to at least 50% economy maybe more or the population and they are barely getting by so we're
2013.30s: in a period I mean it's it is the roaring 20s in a lot of ways you know we're in a period where we're
2019.46s: not far from you know in that case the great depression and yet it's party on folks everything looks
2025.70s: great that is the similarity I mean there are a lot of differences but that is the similarity and I
2032.02s: think that's that's the way it goes is when you get these events we saw it in 2008 you know
2039.38s: right up until um in fact they're early September of 2000 I can I can remember distinctly
2046.82s: I was I was saying hard landing ahead and you know financial crisis and you had all of the
2055.14s: street economists almost all of them saying no recession site was off landing and we were a month or
2062.34s: less than a month from Lehman brothers and the ultimate crash so that is the reality is that when these
2070.42s: things if it's safe and angel break when these things break they oftentimes come out of nowhere or at
2077.54s: at least there's not a lot of pre-warning that everybody sees coming it's yeah those
2084.74s: inner dependencies are also really interesting and it leads me to one more question for you
2092.10s: something that I think is common among a lot of your critics with your with your idea is the
2100.66s: timing element of it a lot of them say like always been saying this for a long time
2105.70s: but can you dive a little deeper just to explore this this difference because I understand their
2113.78s: lens their lens is always like somebody said this is gonna happen by this it didn't happen so it is
2119.06s: not a thing your lens is I'm talking about literally almost a centrally long thing when we're talking
2126.66s: about one or two years in that duration it's same same so can you talk a little bit about that
2134.02s: paradigm and the window that you're playing with yeah it's two things it's a misunderstanding of what a
2140.50s: cycle call is so you know I get myself into trouble because I am I'll say this could happen by a certain
2147.78s: date and I just expect people to understand the difference between could and will so you know but
2156.42s: they don't they hear could and they hear will you know this will happen by I have never in my life
2163.06s: as a forecaster said this will happen it's good by mail with a time frame and so then if you if you
2172.50s: explain that the the trader side of them says oh you're just playing games with us you know
2180.10s: you're just using semantics you called this thing and it didn't happen when you said it's a lot
2186.18s: of it is because for the retail public they've they've come in without really understanding
2194.10s: investing versus trading or really understanding what they're doing you know they're they're kind of
2199.78s: brought up in a whatever they're training some have gone to you know these trading shops or
2209.62s: services or whatever so they are learning the trading and others just kind of don't know what
2215.38s: investing is but so part of it is that and part of it is yes this is a I mean we're talking about
2224.02s: something that's unprecedented in terms of what we've already seen and what we're going to see
2230.02s: you know this market I had somebody the other day saying this has been a normal market I said
2235.30s: you realize what the S&P has done from from 2020 you know it's tripled it's tripled in five years
2243.94s: five and a half years and you consider that normal you have no idea what you're you know what you're
2249.94s: talking about but that's their that's their experience level is that's all they've seen I guess
2257.30s: so but the other side of it is why why does it keep stretching or why can you not pinpoint it
2265.54s: and why is this cycle stretching more than most part of that is again we tend to underestimate
2274.34s: five trillion dollars was pumped into the system in 2020 and 2021 in Wall Street and in the markets
2285.54s: we're used to money going into the system it gets pumped in and it might impact for the next year
2291.38s: or maybe two when you pump in we had never you know we pump 3.7 trillion into the economy after
2299.38s: 2008 nine over the course of seven or eight years we had never pumped five trillion in in less than two
2306.58s: years and that money doesn't all and along with the pumping of the money from the Fed along with
2313.78s: that came all these programs we had never seen before you know the stabilize the bond market to
2320.34s: provides well business loans in to the tune of millions of dollars to people you know just
2327.06s: things to try to stabilize the system that was totally shut down I mean we we shut the economy down
2333.30s: the world wide economy down for a quarter because of the pandemic you know the fears of what
2338.50s: the pandemic was so so we were willing to do all kinds of things that were unprecedented that
2344.58s: were never done before in magnitudes never done before what I think and I didn't you know this is
2351.70s: hindsight because I didn't see it all and for sight but five trillion dollars and all the programs
2358.82s: ago with it just don't go through the system in two years they've helped keep this thing going
2367.30s: for a lot longer but it's drying up you can see it in the repo you know the repo
2373.46s: the Fed's repo has moved down towards zero it's low as something's gone so you see it there you
2382.58s: seeing that in terms of some of the credit numbers that are starting to show strain so it's getting
2389.14s: there but yeah you know if you if you look back from say 22 to now you know it's three and a half years
2397.14s: and you know I thought it would happen a lot faster but it's I think it's a lot of it's because
2404.98s: of all that as I say we went from an eight and a hundred seventy five billion dollar Fed balance
2411.94s: she in October of 2022 that had that was a largest it had ever been from from 1913 on
2420.90s: and we've gone from that to nine trillion in the 2021 now we backed it off to six and a half trillion
2428.98s: but we're we're talking about trillions we're talking about numbers that are just beyond any
2434.98s: of our ability to really get our heads around and we talk about it and we act like it's normalcy
2441.70s: it's not normalcy and that's that that my opinion is probably a simplistic way what the bus will be
2448.42s: all about is you know you've got the combination of policy makers like Paul saying we're never
2454.50s: going to do that again we're not going to print money like that again we're not going to support
2458.82s: the stock market like that again we're not going to zero-interfer policy again I think I think
2465.38s: they are but they don't know they are and they're going to be reluctant to do that so that's
2470.58s: going to be a delay this you know at a time when things are falling apart they're not going to be
2476.66s: nearly in the mindset that we're going to save the system we've got to do they won't know the
2481.94s: magnitude that they need and they're going to be reluctant to do it because they don't want to repeat
2487.06s: to mistakes of the last cycle that all those delays in a very leveraged situation is why things
2495.54s: can fall apart because I'm sure you hear it I get a lot is oh Trump won't let that happen or
2503.54s: Paul won't let that happen I go this isn't going to happen because they want it to this isn't
2509.62s: going to happen because they aren't trying to stop it it's just the combination of all the
2515.38s: things have come before lead to this kind of environment where they're going to be slow to react
2523.30s: the leveraged is going to mean you have to be faster to act the size of the leveraged means
2528.98s: the magnitude of the leveraged means the magnitude of the unwind is going to be huge and
2536.34s: and they're doing baby steps I mean it just all that put together whether happen the first half
2542.58s: an extra or later next year or right after the new year I have no idea but I think it's coming and
2549.14s: I think it'll come fast when it does well as usual we will we will see we will find out one of the
2558.34s: beautiful parts about being a trader is my world is pretty simple I don't have to do all the
2563.70s: big brain stuff and try to inject all these different things and come up with an idea I just look
2569.06s: it what's happening and do my best to fit to it but hearing the way that you're analyzing stuff
2574.66s: is always interesting to me and it's fun because it really is a dichotomy to like most of my world
2580.34s: which is much much shorter term in nature so as always love love chat and love pick your brain a
2586.90s: little bit I know folks can find you on X and if they're interested in your newsletter which is
2593.38s: by subscription they can DM you there is there anywhere else you would like to direct people
2600.50s: yeah no I don't think so I would just say you know stay tuned here on you know I am on on X every day
2609.38s: I think these next three months are going to be history in the making for sure I mean I think this is
2615.06s: going to be maybe the most exciting time we've ever seen in markets so just stay tuned
2622.98s: I am looking forward to it David a pleasure is always thank you thanks Eric
