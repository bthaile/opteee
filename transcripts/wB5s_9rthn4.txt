0.00s: What's up, everyone? We just wrapped up episode four of analyzing this man's trades and all
8.16s: of his yellow updates on Reddit. We're almost done. We have to get through 2024 yet, but
14.40s: we've gotten through everything leading into it. So what I want to do in this video is
18.60s: just kind of summarize what we've found so far. And it's because it's fascinating to
24.76s: me. It genuinely is fascinating to me. So I need to start with a couple general disclaimers,
30.92s: because I know that all of this stuff is super sensitive with people. The reason why I'm
35.76s: doing this is because I've been trading for a long time. And it's not common that you
41.36s: come across really uncommon things in markets. And what I mean is when I look through a lot
48.48s: of what he's done, there are multiple displays of really uncommon behaviors that are fascinating
56.08s: to me. It's as if I'm looking at nature and I see an anomaly and it's there. I can see
62.36s: what it's doing loosely. I don't understand what it's doing, but I can see it. So it's
66.76s: fascinating to me. I am not doing any of this in the context of trying to replicate what
73.04s: he does. I don't think anybody can replicate what he does. And I think that's by design.
77.20s: And I think that's part of why he's been successful is because there absolutely is an element
82.48s: of survivor ship bias in what he does. It is what it is. So the last thing I want to offer
89.88s: here is I'm still relatively new to this. So I am not going to pretend like I know everything
95.00s: that's going on because I don't. I've traded GameStop a lot through its movements from
99.64s: an options trading perspective. But with respect to getting into the story, the background,
104.68s: understanding the catalyst, the characters, all of those kinds of things. I'm brand new
108.64s: to this thing. I really started digging in back in May. So I've probably spent a few
114.12s: hundred hours on it at this point, which is really insignificant compared to a lot of
118.20s: other people. I want to make all of that super clear. I am applying the analysis from
122.84s: the perspective of a trader first and foremost. And I want to talk about that. Now let's
129.28s: start with a quick overview of what we've done and what we found. And when I say we,
135.48s: it's because I've done most of these on not most all of this on the Saturday night,
140.36s: GME live stream. So I've purposefully done it with the community so that you all can
145.16s: help me understand what I'm looking at because there's a lot of context that I don't have.
151.16s: So what we did is literally go all the way back to the very, very first post we went
155.52s: all the way down to the bottom. Then I started logging a few data points. And this is
160.68s: all duplicative. I'm not looking for anything to be like nicer, pretty here. This is literally
164.52s: just for my eyes to track what's going on. The entire objective of this exercise was
170.92s: not to generate a large data set for later manipulation. It was literally for me to go
177.48s: line by line, understand each change when it happened. What did the market look like
183.44s: when it happened? What did the commentary look like around when it happened to fully understand
188.36s: stuff? Because it's easy to share things that we've heard second hand. We might loosely
193.20s: understand, but I demand firsthand information is close as I can get to it because there's
199.60s: a lot open for interpretation and there's a lot of things I can get lost in the details.
203.76s: And the devil is in the details. That's where I focus. So that's why I did this. I wanted
209.36s: to get a really good sense of what this whole thing looked like literally post by post.
215.80s: So what do we notice? A lot of things. Now I started tracking this on the first of
222.84s: September of 2020. That's not the first update that he has. I started tracking them a little
229.36s: bit further in because we were going line by line previously and kind of getting a qualitative
234.88s: assessment of some of the changes. So from this point forward, he already had built a little
241.60s: bit of an account. He didn't start with his $100,000, but there's a few things that shocked
246.88s: me right from the beginning. And the very first one is I always thought that Royne Kitty
253.12s: was primarily a stock trader. And this is my own naïve today. I thought that because of
258.24s: things that I've heard the way I've heard people talk about him, communities that are
262.44s: actually like I didn't know this, but quite against options. So I had just assumed that
268.04s: he was a stock trader. And that's why all of those artifacts were in place. But funny
272.04s: enough, the very first position that I see for him in his yellow updates and Wall Street
276.12s: bets. And this is from five years ago. This is his first post on 8 September 2019. It's
282.12s: actually all options. And it's about a $100,000 account. Now one of the things I identified
287.84s: here again from the live stream last night is that he obviously had other stuff at this point
294.08s: in time. And we know that from some of his live streams, which is also very interesting.
299.68s: So for example, if we compare this date, again, this is the 8 September, we can see the portfolio
305.44s: as it sits. This is showing the what's in the portfolio, right? And we can see the total values
310.88s: and all that kind of stuff. And this all lines up. So this tells me that this isn't like a snapshot
314.96s: of what's in his portfolio. This is what he's currently holding it. It's a 1,000 total calls across
320.16s: these different explorations, different strikes. Okay. Now if we go to his YouTube channel and we grab
325.52s: one of these live streams, it doesn't really matter which one. Let's grab this one. So in the
331.20s: different live streams, he shows different elements of his tracker that actually show his percent
337.44s: of portfolio. I'm not sure if it's in this one. It's probably this one or this one, maybe. I just
343.84s: want to see if I can find the yeah. Okay. Here it is. So if I get rid of this and you can take a
348.88s: look at the percent of portfolio as he's scrolling around a little bit. And this is clearly after
354.72s: that, right? So this is three aug 2020. So we already know that he has other stuff on at this point
362.88s: because he posts this one portfolio. That's just game stop. But at a later point in time,
368.08s: that he clearly has other positions on. So again, don't mean anything one way or the other by it,
374.24s: but just general information. So as we go through the remainder of all these different trades,
381.28s: there's a couple things that I picked up pretty discreetly. The first thing is there's this thought
389.36s: process, right? Fleeceau, the dude's been tremendously successful. But there's been this thought
394.48s: process that he's essentially like this, this perfect timing machine that he's like pinpointing
401.52s: individual days that he knows something's going to happen. And he's going to get in right before
406.00s: and then right after it or that he knows something's going to happen at this point in time. So he's
410.40s: going to get in super early and wait until it happens. And it's all fair ideas because we're all
416.16s: guessing. What I can tell you definitively is that the value of his portfolio does not line up
424.56s: with that kind of timing premise. It generally shows elements of timing for sure.
432.08s: It does not line up with that kind of timing premise. What I mean is this, if we take a look at
439.12s: 5 Jan 2021, the total portfolio value at that point was 2.8 mil. It rises up to 3 point or I'm sorry,
448.72s: to 7 point 368. Then it gets all the way up to 22 mil. Then it gets up to 48 mil. Then it gets
455.68s: down to 33. Then it trickles all the way down to 17 mil. Then it gets, so what I'm highlighting is
462.56s: as this is moving around, the portfolio value here is exhibiting massive volatility. That's not
472.56s: an artifact of really careful timing. What this is an artifact of is somebody that has supreme
479.92s: conviction in what they're doing. And they're exceedingly comfortable taking massive size trades
488.64s: and writing it out. And again, that's an entire skill set in and of itself. But what I want you to
494.72s: look at is this portfolio that went from 11 mil to almost 50 mil to 17 mil. How many of you would
501.20s: go through that path probably? Like most of us, if you have something that goes from 7 to 50,
507.28s: let's say you were even good enough to ride it to that kind of peak, there would have been exits
511.84s: for the overwhelming majority of that's life changing money. But it's very clear that this is not
518.56s: what it's all about to him. And this actually, I think bolsters the idea that there are other
524.00s: accounts because one of the ways that you can let something like this do this is if your livelihood
531.52s: doesn't depend on this, right? Because we know that he has a family. And obviously, he likes to
536.24s: play around. He likes to have fun. But I don't see him as an irresponsible husband or father. I see
542.32s: him as somebody who's trying to take care of his family. So if I'm trying to take care of my family,
548.24s: and I have an account that probably isn't doing this, but is doing pretty well, then it gives me
552.96s: the leeway to kind of let this be whatever it's going to be. The other thing that we have to
558.00s: identify when we look at his overall approach is from this video. And it's not all the way in here.
563.20s: It's actually up here in the why I'm not a value investor section. But he talks about his willingness
568.40s: to accept lumpy returns, which makes a ton of sense. Sometimes it's going to be up, sometimes it's
573.84s: going to be down. And he phrases it a big down big, right? And as I look across his portfolio,
579.68s: it's exactly what I see him executing that exact idea. So from a trading perspective,
586.72s: I see a few things. The first thing is I see somebody that is not setting profit targets. And again,
593.20s: for most of us traditional full-time traders, we absolutely would set profit targets. And it's
598.96s: so that we don't go through this kind of volatility. And it's again, it's because most of us are
604.24s: taking a slightly slower but higher probabilistic approach to the outcomes, whereas it's very clear.
610.16s: In his case, this dude is very convicted. And again, even this, he doesn't even bulk at this.
617.92s: $48 million worth of the account. Don't care. Clearly, don't care. Just let it go.
624.24s: Next day, it's down 10 plus mill. Don't care. And again, we can see this as we get closer in time
628.96s: in the 2024 time frame where he's down over $200 million. So from a trading perspective,
634.80s: he has a different roadmap. And it's kind of like the idea behind trading squeezes that you can't
640.64s: really apply a standard methodology to them. You have to understand the profit mechanism of a squeeze,
646.00s: the traits of squeezes, how they behave, their periodicity, their severity, their frequency,
652.16s: the precursors such as volume, all of those things. Once you have like a fingerprint, I call them,
658.24s: of the tendency, then you can create an approach around it. Well, for him, he's clearly trading
665.04s: this really concentrated approach. But it's highly specific to him. Because as I look at these things,
671.52s: the other thing I notice is he has a very strange way to manage these options.
677.44s: So when I went back to this video, he talks about the ways that he uses options very openly.
685.04s: He uses things that are typically leaps, meaning greater than a year out further out in time.
690.16s: And there's a couple of things that he talks about that clearly let me know. He knows exactly
695.68s: what he's doing, right? Because obviously he trolls sometimes. He posted that meme where it was like
700.16s: the banana that had like options 101 or whatever, right? Like joking that he doesn't know what he's
704.72s: doing with options. But like clearly he does because he talks about the siphoning of liquidity.
709.60s: He talks about essentially becoming an agent that's making your own markets. That's fascinating.
715.60s: Because again, this is happening four years ago back in 2020 when he had a
720.96s: tiny relative size account to what he had when he came back in 2024. So it tells me that this isn't
728.80s: somebody that's just bumbling through options. He knows what he's doing. He knows how they operate.
734.00s: He even talks about the pricing of them a little bit earlier on where he says he finds a lot of
738.80s: them to be too expensive. Again, that's probably some of the value investor methodology that he's
743.36s: also imparting on the options, which I totally get we care about pricing of options. We don't want
747.36s: to pay too many vals for something because then it just puts you at a disadvantage.
752.00s: The fact that he's doing all that is interesting to me. The broader fact that I find so interesting
760.88s: is he seems to be managing these options based on time, not by value, not by return, not by price
772.40s: target, not by new catalyst, by time. And that I can't help but find truly fascinating. Because there's
781.20s: artifacts of him holding options all the way into expiration. There's artifacts of him holding
788.00s: options very close to expiration, seemingly exercising right before. That's the example of 16
793.36s: April of what is this 2021. Then there's artifacts of him closing options greater than 45 days out.
802.00s: Now from this video, he says his average holding time is from three to 24 months, which while that
807.92s: might seem like a crazy large range, it again elucidates what he's doing, which is not specifically
815.92s: pinpointing something. But it's him playing a general idea. In this case, stock go up for X, Y, and Z
824.08s: reason. And he has a ton of different reasons, obviously. But it's not this like perfect pricing
830.40s: mechanism. So as you've noted, I got us through 2021. So we still have to go through 2024. And I am
841.44s: super eager to get into the 2024 updates. And I am dying to know what kind of changes if any
851.04s: occur in his approach, because I think we'll see it because I can see a lot of what he's doing here,
857.04s: which is fascinating to me. So when we start up again on next Saturday, we'll go through in depth
864.40s: just like this step by step update by update. We'll take a look at what GME looked like at the time
870.08s: of the update to get a sense of essentially what it looks like is going on. And if there's a
875.76s: change in his methodology, because again, from what I see from 2019, essentially through 2021,
882.48s: I see somebody who's using a tremendous amount of leverage backed by a tremendous amount of conviction
889.68s: that is not managing trades based on standard approach things again, like return profit
895.28s: target zone and so forth. But most of these are being managed by time. Because again, I use
900.64s: examples like this where the account is up 46,000,000, 47,000, 40 million, and he doesn't care. He just
908.40s: kind of floats right through that looking for seemingly more. But I actually don't know if there's
914.40s: a specific dollar target that he's holding out until it gets to. It seems like he's just trying to
920.32s: ride this thing up, which again, I just can't help but find so very curious. So I want to see if
928.08s: when we get into 2024, if there's any changes to some of these metrics that I can see in terms of
933.76s: when money is being put into the account versus coming out of the account, we can see that versus
938.24s: seeing what kind of volatility he allows in the portfolio, which again, I already know most of 2024
943.60s: because I started that's why I started looking at this stuff. And he allows a lot of volatility. But
947.84s: I want to see exactly how much. And so far, we're dealing with a true anomaly and I am having
956.40s: literally so much fun trying to figure out what's going on here because it is so damn interesting.
963.60s: So I'm sure a lot of you have ideas that we should take a look at or have some thoughts on what's
970.00s: going on here. I would always love to hear it because most of you are what have allowed me to
976.16s: understand more of what's going on here. So I would love to hear your ideas on essentially what
981.44s: I'm sharing here because again, I don't know. I'm just guessing. I'm going off of what I can see
985.76s: coming up with the best conclusions I possibly can based on information. So if you have information
991.28s: that can help with that, I would love to see it. Now, as always, if there's anything you need,
994.96s: hit me up, be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
