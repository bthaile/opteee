2.48s: what is going on everybody i am here
5.60s: with my good friend
7.60s: best friend ever dave welcome back i
10.80s: think this is what the third time or
12.40s: yeah i think this is third time
13.84s: yeah yeah
15.20s: well we're we're gonna have to set up
16.64s: like your own playlist soon
19.36s: first off you know thanks for thanks for
21.20s: joining me again i always look forward
23.36s: to talking with you because you are
25.84s: truly one of the the few people that are
29.36s: very vocal for retail traders and you
32.72s: are obviously incredibly savvy about
36.00s: just the financial markets in general
37.60s: their structure which i think would
40.16s: benefit a lot more retail traders if
42.32s: they you don't have to become an expert
43.60s: but as long as you start to understand a
45.12s: little bit more
46.40s: the pieces start to fall in place a
48.16s: little bit better and you kind of know
49.36s: how to more effectively interact with
51.04s: the market so thank you again for coming
53.20s: to hang out and spend some time sure
55.04s: yeah thanks for having me eric i always
56.40s: enjoy it and uh you know look forward to
59.52s: talking about markets and it's just
61.36s: great that people are interested in it
63.28s: and uh so you know i'm always happy to
64.96s: talk about it
66.16s: which is it it is such a funny point
68.16s: because like a lot of my friends that i
69.68s: talk to i try to talk to you about
71.04s: trading they couldn't care less yeah and
73.28s: then you know like you start i was
75.44s: talking with somebody on the internet
77.76s: about uh volatility smiles and they were
81.44s: geeking out on it as hard as i was and i
83.36s: was just like how cool is this that you
85.04s: could just find somebody that's
86.64s: interested in a super niche thing that
89.12s: nobody you know cares about but you know
90.96s: this person across the country likes it
93.52s: i love that i know i know i mean that's
95.76s: it's the same thing with market
96.96s: structure you know for and for a long
98.64s: time again like nobody in this world
101.04s: cared about it and there were like 10
102.64s: people on wall street that were obsessed
104.72s: with it we all know each other and you
106.40s: know we all even
107.76s: you know half of us disagree with the
109.20s: other half but they're we're always
111.44s: arguing and debating and it's always
113.28s: super fascinating but it you know it is
115.12s: it's funny it's like this this thing
116.64s: that just nobody would ever think to
118.64s: care about and yet it's so important
122.08s: to the economy and to to everything same
124.40s: with trading right you know i think
125.92s: people underestimate the importance of
128.00s: even the speculation which helps to you
130.64s: know bring prices in line and if you buy
132.64s: any version of the efficient market
134.08s: hypothesis you know speculators are are
136.24s: important
137.52s: as part of that
138.72s: right yeah
140.40s: and so that's actually like a really
142.32s: good starting point because the last
144.64s: couple times we were talking there was
146.24s: this
147.12s: um you know we are the investors and it
150.00s: you know as a started as it looked like
152.16s: a hashtag on twitter i don't know if the
153.76s: petition came before that and it was
155.28s: part of it maybe you could tell me a
156.56s: little bit about like the timing of it
158.00s: but more importantly
159.92s: you kind of started this movement that
162.00s: is definitely interested in you know
165.92s: retail traders place in the market
169.60s: and some of the structural components of
172.16s: the markets that in a lot of ways
174.32s: they're kind of sold to retail traders
176.40s: like good things but then when you start
178.64s: understanding it a little bit more it's
180.00s: kind of like
181.04s: is this a good thing
182.88s: so yeah well i you know it it originally
185.68s: came about you know as i've
187.92s: gotten more immersed in the retail
190.48s: investor and trader community which is
192.72s: more recent for me you know i've sort of
194.48s: been in the professional trading
196.24s: community for for a long time but you
198.32s: know the retail trading community is is
200.16s: new to me for for the last you know a
202.40s: year and change
203.84s: and it's almost the wild west we just
206.48s: we're just winging a fascinating space
210.64s: but
211.68s: you know
212.64s: i i was used to
215.68s: encountering firms like citadel and
218.88s: virtue and
220.72s: robin hood and td ameritrade in in the
223.76s: market structure debates that were
225.28s: happening um both in congress and at the
228.88s: sec
230.00s: and
231.20s: i was used to encountering them
233.36s: holding themselves up as representing
235.92s: retail
237.12s: and
237.92s: the absurdity of that
240.56s: was it was never really lost on anyone
243.28s: but there was no one to really question
245.92s: it and there was really no one else
248.08s: who could step in to represent retail
250.48s: and so the the reason it's absurd is
252.64s: because these are companies who profit
254.88s: from retail who productize retail right
257.68s: you you get free commissions i mean
260.24s: nothing's for free we all know that
261.68s: right especially on wall street but you
264.16s: know even on social media nothing's for
265.92s: free if you're not paying for something
267.60s: you're the product and since when does
270.08s: the firm that has productized you get to
272.88s: represent your interests and who in the
275.52s: right minds would think that they're
276.80s: representing your interests as opposed
278.88s: to their interests so that was really
281.68s: where this this all began was to say
284.40s: wait a second you know if if retail
288.32s: can can can get educated on these issues
291.52s: and and has been educating itself on
293.76s: these issues you know everyone cares now
296.08s: about market structure and they're
297.20s: fascinated by it which is the only
298.96s: reason like i have
301.20s: this twitter following and and you know
303.44s: reddit communities that care to interact
305.60s: and they want to learn more and
307.76s: you know if they can learn enough then
309.84s: retail should be able to represent
311.28s: itself and and retail should be able to
313.44s: represent its interests and understand
316.96s: the trade-offs that it's being presented
318.72s: with in the current
320.48s: structure
321.52s: and decide for itself is a is a better
324.40s: one possible and would there be a bet is
326.16s: there a better structure that could
327.68s: better advantage retail investors over
330.40s: this extr system of extreme
332.88s: intermediation
334.40s: and middlemen that has cropped up around
337.76s: retail right it's like you know if
339.52s: retail or the schools of fish you have
341.28s: all these sharks coming in
343.52s: profiting from it um and it's just it's
346.56s: an unnecessary sort of
348.64s: middle layer
350.40s: in the market and you know so a big part
352.64s: of what we're pushing for with we the
354.08s: investors is getting rid of that middle
356.32s: layer getting rid of all this
357.68s: intermediation and and letting retail
360.40s: access markets directly and letting
362.40s: retail interact with institutions
364.24s: directly
365.76s: which so
367.20s: talk to me a little bit more about that
369.04s: the
369.84s: you know getting rid of the intermediary
371.84s: can you share a little bit more on like
374.24s: the primary entities
376.48s: um or functions that those entities
378.96s: provide now and why you think they
382.16s: shouldn't be there and that retails
383.60s: should be able to go kind of vfr direct
385.68s: past them yeah so today when you enter
388.64s: an order in as a retail investor or
390.80s: retail trader uh nearly universally
394.56s: that order is going to go to what's
396.56s: called a wholesaler so
398.72s: yet you use td ameritrade or schwab or
401.76s: e-trade or robinhood um even to a
405.28s: certain extent interactive brokers but
407.04s: not not quite the same um
410.00s: you know but all of these
411.92s: all the biggest brokers in the world
414.56s: sell their order flow
416.48s: or even if they don't sell it like
418.08s: fidelity doesn't sell equity order flow
420.40s: they do sell options order flow but they
422.24s: still send it all of those orders to
425.60s: mostly citadel and vertu so those are
427.76s: called wholesalers and so that order
431.20s: you know marketable orders go to these
433.12s: wholesalers and they internalize it they
435.36s: fill those orders they send the fill
437.04s: back
437.84s: and what your broker will tell you is
440.08s: well look they're paying for that order
442.16s: flow so that's why we can offer you zero
444.56s: commissions and you're getting all this
446.80s: great price improvement you're getting a
448.48s: better fill than the mbbo you should be
450.56s: on your knees thanking us not getting
453.44s: upset at this great price improvement
456.32s: and free trading you know what could be
458.08s: better uh and of course you know like i
460.88s: said
461.68s: nothing's for free in this world um so
464.32s: you know first of all there's a good
465.44s: amount of academic evidence that shows
467.52s: that if your order is being handled by a
469.52s: broker that accepts payment for order
471.04s: flow you're going to get a worse price
473.04s: than if your order is being handled by a
474.64s: broker that doesn't so you know like
476.40s: flat off that's
479.28s: that's hardly even a controversial
480.96s: statement at this point uh so that part
483.92s: first of all that means that your
485.20s: broker's not getting best execution
487.36s: right right the broker is a duty of best
489.12s: execution above and beyond its interest
491.84s: in accepting payment for order flow and
494.00s: brokers are not meeting that duty and so
496.88s: that's a that's a big problem in markets
498.80s: today and you don't know
500.88s: how much it's costing you because you're
502.80s: not seeing it
504.48s: uh it's all sort of baked into the
506.56s: execution price now the other side of
508.72s: this is
510.24s: this great price improvement that they
512.16s: talk so much about but price improvement
514.72s: is
516.96s: that's the nicest way i can put it
519.44s: because it's completely theoretical
521.84s: right it's not an actually a real thing
524.88s: okay price improvement is them saying we
527.76s: gave you a better price than the mbbf
529.84s: but does that mean they give you a
531.12s: better price than the hidden orders that
533.04s: were out there were the midpoint orders
534.96s: that were out there that they didn't
536.08s: even bother to look for no it doesn't
538.08s: mean that did they give you a better
539.60s: price than the odd lots out there which
541.60s: don't count in the mbbo no they didn't
544.32s: do that and so much of retail trading
547.12s: today is in odd lots and so much
549.20s: liquidity out there is in odd lots
551.20s: because of these high-priced names so
554.64s: the
555.84s: and then finally it's because
559.12s: when they take all of this order flow
561.76s: and they gobble it up into these two
564.72s: big companies
566.24s: they are damaging the market
568.64s: so it actually widens spreads
571.60s: for the entire market
573.36s: the best estimate i've seen of the
575.36s: impact of that is that it widens spreads
578.40s: by 25
580.16s: or more
581.36s: that's a huge multi-billion dollar cost
584.64s: to the economy and to the industry and
587.76s: nobody's even talking about that and so
590.64s: that's like saying you know okay i'm
593.20s: going to raise my price by 25
597.44s: and then oh you look nice i'm going to
599.52s: give you 10 off that price aren't i so
602.08s: nice right there is your price
603.28s: improvement that's what you know so it's
604.64s: all um and so the the the
607.52s: entire sort of ecosystem that has
610.16s: cropped up around the discount brokers
613.04s: and wholesalers is a really corrupt one
615.84s: and it's one in which brokers are not uh
618.00s: getting best execution and there it's
620.24s: one in which the markets are being
622.08s: damaged by its very existence and so
624.00s: that's what we're pushing to get rid of
626.56s: and to get those retail orders either
629.04s: onto the exchange where
631.68s: hundreds of people can compete for them
634.96s: or into some kind of transparent venue
636.96s: that allows for open competition for
638.80s: order flow so that's it the most
640.96s: important part of all this is today it's
643.36s: essentially a duopoly it's an
645.20s: anti-competitive system
647.20s: and i just believe in competition you
649.44s: know i'm i'm funny that way i'm a
651.28s: capitalist you know i believe in open
653.28s: competition and that leads to optimal
655.20s: outcomes and so that's why we believe
657.44s: that we should get rid of the middlemen
659.04s: and let everyone compete over these
660.56s: orders
661.92s: so
662.88s: just for the people
665.20s: um
666.24s: that might not be familiar with what
668.00s: that could look like so let's say best
671.04s: case scenario is granted and you know
674.80s: the
675.60s: petition that you guys are working on is
677.20s: accepted and they you know take on board
679.84s: all of the suggestions
682.08s: what would the markets look like on the
684.32s: back end of that
686.08s: i think the markets would look a lot
687.84s: simpler
688.96s: that's the most important thing that
691.20s: that i believe in is
693.04s: today markets are very complex you have
695.12s: 16 stock exchanges 40 dark pools and
698.08s: atss you've got
700.16s: things that are called sdps single
701.84s: dealer platforms being run in in an
704.24s: almost unregulated way
706.88s: you know it would get rid of a lot of
709.28s: that and it would really simplify things
711.28s: and i think that if we can get closer to
714.72s: a market that is not as fragmented and
717.92s: gives everyone an opportunity to sign up
720.16s: sort of find each other in a in a more
722.08s: efficient way that would be a better
723.84s: outcome um and you know we hear a lot
726.80s: that the us has the deepest most liquid
728.96s: markets in the world it's not even close
731.04s: to true that's that's you know that's
733.04s: like a political slogan or something
734.56s: it's just a very u.s thing to say you
736.32s: know we just got to mess everything
738.80s: right exactly it's just quantitatively
741.52s: not true like you know you can look at
744.64s: many other markets that have better
746.72s: liquidity and and lower execution costs
750.00s: when you adjust for things like company
752.32s: size you know yeah the us has the
753.84s: biggest companies
755.68s: but not the best markets and you know
758.64s: they they always say well retail has
760.16s: never had it better and you know even
762.16s: that i'm not even convinced that's true
764.72s: but even if it is it doesn't mean that
767.20s: it's a we we've arrived at a good
769.04s: outcome you know
770.56s: we retail could have way better uh
773.12s: institutions could have it way better
775.28s: and that should matter to every retail
777.20s: investor because
778.48s: you know the majority of the wealth
781.44s: of the united states and many other
783.44s: countries is concentrated in pension
785.76s: plans and mutual funds and etfs and that
789.76s: is the institutional
791.76s: money that we should want to be able to
794.32s: execute as efficiently or more
796.64s: efficiently than the retail speculator
799.28s: and and so you know i think that when i
801.36s: think of what a better market structure
803.60s: would look like it's a simpler one in
806.08s: which retail and institutions can hit
808.56s: each other directly without all of this
810.96s: unnecessary intermediation
813.52s: now would you
814.96s: still advocate for dark pools would they
817.92s: still exist in this world or would you
820.00s: completely want to get rid of them and
821.60s: if so where do block orders go
824.24s: oh yeah i i i believe that dark pools
826.72s: should exist i think they have you know
828.48s: an important function in markets um i
831.12s: think it's important to understand and a
833.60s: lot of people tend to confuse the point
835.76s: that retail orders pretty much never go
837.92s: into a dark pool dark pools are for
840.00s: institutions like you said have big
842.56s: blocks and they want to see if they can
845.84s: find a counterparty to that trade
848.08s: without hitting the exchange and without
850.08s: impacting the price significantly
852.64s: i think again there should be far fewer
854.80s: dark pools but dark pools are
858.00s: a place for
859.60s: innovation and for you know creativity
862.64s: and i think that that's a good thing
865.04s: i just think it should be
866.72s: harder
868.56s: to
869.36s: create one if you have a conflict of
872.64s: interest and and so today a lot of dark
875.52s: pools are operated by institutional
877.68s: brokers
878.80s: and they are routing the orders of asset
882.16s: managers and operating dark pool and
885.04s: that's a huge conflict of interest
886.64s: because they are they are incentivized
888.72s: to preference that dark pool over other
890.88s: potential better sources of execution
893.28s: quality because it's a way for them to
894.96s: save money so anytime there's a conflict
897.36s: like that i think it it's really
899.68s: important for us to identify the
901.44s: conflict and make sure that it's the
903.76s: kind of thing that we get rid of um you
906.08s: know i prefer to get rid of conflicts
908.72s: uh versus disclose them away and that's
911.76s: you know the the regulatory instinct is
914.88s: to
915.68s: focus on disclosure and i think
917.20s: disclosure can be important um but
920.40s: you know disclosure does not fix
922.56s: conflicts of interest and
924.88s: it's a it's a big problem when you think
926.72s: you can you can fix it with just with
928.96s: disclosure
930.16s: right which leads me to like a genuine
933.36s: personal question that i've had is why
936.64s: don't dark pools why isn't there more
938.84s: cannibalization among them i was always
941.28s: curious why there's so many that are
942.88s: able to operate
944.64s: against one another why how does that
946.72s: work yeah i think it's a huge problem
949.68s: for markets i think fragmentation is a
952.32s: huge problem for markets and the fact
955.12s: that you have all of these dark pools
957.36s: and they don't seem to go away
959.52s: it again it a big part of it is because
962.56s: they don't really need to make money
965.60s: you know they when they're operated by a
967.60s: broker
968.64s: the point is that it's saving the broker
970.88s: a lot of money anytime it finds a fill
973.04s: in its own dart pool
974.80s: right um and so that
977.20s: you know they'll just operate because
979.28s: it's a cost avoidance mechanism and
981.20s: that's the problem so you get a ton of
982.88s: them and it's like you know you have
984.88s: these big blocks and their ships passing
986.80s: each other in the night they can't find
988.32s: each other because one is in the ubs
990.40s: dark pool and one's in the goldman dark
991.92s: pool and another one might be over in
993.44s: credit suisse and you know narrow the
995.36s: twain shall meet and so it's it's a big
997.36s: problem
998.72s: got it yeah that makes a lot of sense i
1000.80s: hadn't really thought of it that way
1002.24s: yeah i was
1003.20s: because i i like to follow dark pool
1005.68s: flow it's more just out of curiosity i
1007.36s: just think it's interesting but
1009.28s: i was always wondering why there are so
1010.88s: many of them able to exist
1012.08s: simultaneously it seemed
1014.00s: strange to me but yeah
1016.40s: and and it's it's symptomatic of
1018.48s: something which is that
1020.88s: you know the the entire sort of ats
1022.88s: structure is not really set up for
1024.96s: regulators to say no to things
1027.76s: um so i think that's part of the problem
1029.76s: but it's the same thing is true
1032.16s: in the exchange space you know we have
1034.32s: 16 stock exchanges why
1037.20s: why why do we need 16 stock exchanges
1040.00s: and they don't they compete over nothing
1041.76s: but fee structure
1044.08s: and and they're all subsidized by the
1046.16s: public right so hundreds of millions of
1048.80s: dollars every year
1050.96s: goes from public the public into the
1053.60s: stock exchanges and these are for-profit
1056.32s: publicly traded companies and they're
1058.56s: getting a hundred million dollars a year
1060.32s: each the three major exchange families
1062.32s: nisei nasdaq and cboe and all because
1066.24s: they are the ones in charge of setting
1068.00s: the fees
1069.12s: of the securities information process or
1071.04s: the public market data feed so they set
1073.12s: the fees very high because it brings in
1074.88s: a huge subsidy to them it makes it so
1077.28s: unprofitable exchanges can be operated
1081.28s: because that's what subsidization does
1083.12s: it allows inefficiency to thrive
1086.96s: and it's it's it's a crazy outcome and
1089.60s: it's a problem it's a real problem for
1091.44s: us markets and so you know part of what
1093.76s: the change that i'd like to see
1096.00s: from regulators is them to start saying
1097.92s: no to exchanges i'd like them to get rid
1099.92s: of the sip subsidy
1102.48s: or at least dramatically reduce it it's
1104.32s: just supposed to be the cost of
1105.68s: operating the sip not this massive 100
1107.92s: million a year subsidy that goes to each
1110.16s: exchange family
1111.76s: and i'd like to see far fewer stock
1113.92s: exchanges who can innovate and compete
1116.24s: on real features and execution quality
1119.04s: rather than you know who can give the
1120.40s: biggest rebate to which firm
1123.04s: so
1124.64s: aligning two different kind of
1126.64s: contrasting concepts when we're talking
1129.68s: about
1130.80s: um payment for order flow there's a bit
1132.88s: of a duopoly there and then when we're
1134.80s: talking about the exchanges there's
1136.40s: fragmentation
1138.08s: so what's the middle ground what what uh
1140.72s: should there be four should there be two
1142.88s: should there be five like what what do
1144.56s: you think the right number of exchanges
1146.24s: is to find that balance all right i
1148.32s: think there should be like three
1150.08s: exchanges and three dark pools but you
1152.24s: know i i don't i don't think we should
1154.32s: live in a world in which
1156.72s: someone
1158.32s: picks a number and says this is it right
1161.76s: like you know the fed does um i you know
1164.32s: i i kind of believe in in markets but i
1167.60s: again i i think that
1169.44s: um
1171.44s: both structures the extremely
1173.68s: concentrated
1175.20s: you know wholesaling and payment for
1176.80s: order flow system and the extremely
1178.48s: fragmented exchange system
1180.96s: they both have something in common which
1183.36s: is you know they're sort of the
1184.80s: consequence of regulation
1186.96s: and so
1187.92s: you know often
1189.84s: what i will get accused of is wanting
1192.40s: way more regulation and it's just it's
1194.40s: not the case at all i i want better
1196.56s: regulation but you know i i want to peel
1199.36s: back regulations right like the the the
1202.72s: duopoly that exists in the payment for
1205.28s: order flow and wholesaling world
1207.84s: only exists because of regulation we
1210.16s: should get rid of that we should say
1212.24s: that you know trades should take place
1214.80s: on exchange that should be sort of the
1216.96s: guiding light in u.s markets as it is in
1219.60s: many other markets you know that's
1221.28s: that's a principles-based approach trade
1224.00s: should take place on exchange
1226.00s: there might be exceptions to that rule
1227.76s: like for block trades but generally
1229.76s: speaking trades should take place on
1231.92s: exchange right and on exchange they
1234.16s: that's where you can get competition
1235.68s: open competition
1237.44s: um and then the other side of it is we
1239.60s: should not subsidize inefficient
1241.92s: companies right a subsidy from the
1244.16s: public of hundreds of millions of
1245.52s: dollars a year that results in you know
1248.40s: this crazy fragmented uh exchange you
1251.36s: know set of exchanges is the other it's
1253.76s: a different problem um and so
1256.32s: again you get rid of that kind of
1257.92s: subsidization and then you let market
1260.08s: forces uh you know find the optimal
1263.52s: outcome
1264.96s: i love that part that's such a great a
1267.60s: great sentence to end on allowing market
1270.08s: forces to find that because that's
1272.16s: that's really what i believe in um
1274.80s: to add my completely unsolicited opinion
1277.92s: is i i think that that's just a really
1280.96s: effective way to go about it if the back
1282.72s: end structure is there
1284.56s: it seems like that medium would be found
1287.28s: um
1288.16s: so another related topic that's in the
1292.16s: uh petition which i will absolutely make
1295.04s: sure i throw in the link in the video
1298.48s: description so that people can go check
1299.84s: that out um right now it looks like
1302.16s: there's 71
1304.04s: 118 people
1306.16s: that have signed out of 75 000 and
1308.80s: there's uh
1310.24s: 20 what 32 hours left to go there's a
1312.56s: day and eight hours something like that
1314.00s: yeah so
1315.92s: there's still a little time for people
1317.36s: to get involved i'll make sure i get
1318.72s: this video i'll i'll probably try to
1320.16s: dump it out later today
1321.68s: so that today's the 23rd just so that
1323.60s: people have time to synthesize and
1325.20s: hopefully check this out but
1327.28s: another interesting thing
1329.28s: that you call out
1330.88s: in the petition
1333.36s: is kind of this concept of price
1336.08s: discovery
1337.52s: so
1338.32s: i wanted to hone in on that specifically
1340.72s: because i think that price discovery is
1343.28s: one of those things that people
1345.28s: i mean a lot of this is things that
1346.80s: people don't think about but i i view
1348.88s: price discovery as even like a further
1350.48s: subset of that
1352.08s: and i think it has an outsized impact
1354.48s: for the level of attention it gets
1357.28s: so i would love to get
1360.40s: your
1361.28s: take on why you know you guys
1363.20s: specifically called price discovery out
1365.20s: in here and kind of the status quo as it
1367.76s: is right now for price discovery yeah
1371.04s: you know i so
1372.40s: markets exist for two reasons and and
1374.56s: it's very easy to lose sight of this you
1376.96s: know we we like to trade we like to you
1379.20s: know they they can feel like casinos
1381.12s: often you can say gamble that's for a
1382.96s: lot of people
1384.08s: you know there's no way around it right
1385.84s: and and
1386.80s: you know i believe me i've been on wall
1388.16s: street long enough that it attracts
1390.08s: gamblers right it's the it's gambling
1392.32s: with leverage and it can be fun right
1394.72s: especially when you hit one um
1397.12s: but
1397.92s: markets do not exist to facilitate
1399.92s: gambling and casino-like behavior
1402.80s: for two reasons
1404.40s: capital formation
1406.00s: price discovery right fund good
1408.80s: companies
1409.92s: and figure out what those companies are
1412.32s: worth over time as the world changes and
1414.64s: as those companies change
1416.72s: and so capital formation happens
1418.88s: generally in the primary market that's
1420.56s: when you go public
1422.08s: you raise a ton of money and you list
1424.88s: your company publicly and then your you
1427.52s: know your your shares are floating in
1429.28s: the public they are being traded and the
1431.60s: price should reflect supply and demand
1434.48s: and it's that
1436.00s: sort of you know random walk over time
1438.56s: that is what determines what the company
1440.40s: is worth on the secondary market and
1443.44s: helps companies to raise money down the
1446.16s: line you know issue secondary offerings
1448.88s: issue compensation to their employees
1451.04s: reward you know have their early
1452.64s: employees rewarded as that grows over
1454.48s: time all sorts of things are sort of
1456.72s: tied up in this price discovery process
1459.52s: that is what is this thing worth
1462.24s: and
1463.28s: the most important part of the price
1465.20s: discovery process is that the the nbbo
1468.72s: the national best bid and offer in the
1470.72s: market reflects the supply and demand of
1474.72s: that stock
1476.48s: and so when you first of all
1478.72s: when you take all of this
1482.16s: buying or selling activity from retail
1484.40s: and siphon it off to citadel and vertu
1487.36s: the mbbo stops reflecting that supply
1490.16s: and demand
1491.20s: right
1492.00s: and so part of the effects are that the
1494.56s: spread widens like we've talked about
1497.52s: but it is very plausible to think that
1499.84s: one of the effects of that can be
1502.64s: uh that the direction of the price can
1505.04s: be altered um and so you know when i
1508.88s: send a buy order in
1510.80s: as a retail investor
1512.72s: and it gets internalized by citadel or
1515.92s: vertu and i get my fill back
1518.32s: you know that trade prints to the tape
1520.24s: everyone knows that that buy happened
1522.16s: but what that buy order didn't do
1524.48s: is it didn't hit the offer
1527.04s: right it didn't actually hit the orders
1530.08s: that are out there being broadcast in
1532.16s: the market so it didn't impact the nbbo
1535.28s: in the same way
1536.96s: as if that order had been sent to an
1538.96s: exchange and hits the nbvo and so that
1542.48s: that really can serve to hinder the
1544.56s: price discovery process as well and so i
1547.36s: do think that that's a problem
1549.52s: that internalization and wholesaling
1551.92s: lead to
1552.96s: um and
1554.40s: then you know there's an entire other
1556.24s: side of this that gets into short
1557.76s: selling
1558.72s: and
1559.84s: what the impact of short selling is on
1562.64s: the market
1563.84s: and i'm not someone who will argue
1565.92s: against short selling
1567.60s: broadly speaking i think you should be
1569.36s: able to short something just like you
1571.28s: should be able to go long something i
1572.80s: think it has an important
1574.64s: um you know impact and it's an important
1578.08s: force in markets to keep things in line
1580.40s: and i think i've seen enough research to
1582.72s: know that short selling bans either have
1585.12s: negative effects on the price discovery
1586.96s: process or no effect and you know it's
1590.48s: not entirely clear but again
1592.48s: um it's it's enough to tell me that it's
1594.96s: an important feature of markets but when
1597.92s: when someone shorts something
1601.36s: they are
1602.56s: creating more supply
1605.04s: right that's the nature of short selling
1607.28s: i'm borrowing 100 shares from investor a
1610.56s: and i'm selling them to investor b and
1612.72s: now investor a and b both are holding a
1614.88s: hundred shares
1616.48s: uh but only
1617.92s: 100
1619.36s: exist
1620.56s: um and they're being borrowed and and
1622.88s: then replicated essentially and and you
1625.44s: know so to a certain degree that's a
1627.76s: that's fine but when it starts to exceed
1630.32s: certain thresholds or when there are
1632.56s: failures to deliver that don't get
1634.08s: remediated
1635.52s: that creates you know this idea of
1637.28s: synthetic shares which increases the
1639.20s: supply of shares in the market
1641.44s: and and again that conserved it you know
1643.36s: what what happens when supply increases
1645.28s: price drops that's you know we very
1647.04s: straightforward uh you know impact on
1649.52s: supply and demand and i and i don't know
1651.52s: that it's something that regulators are
1652.88s: paying enough attention to
1655.12s: that's awesome and i appreciate the
1656.80s: explanation it's just something that i
1658.40s: think again
1660.64s: i think that the effects are subtle
1662.96s: enough that a lot of people don't really
1665.12s: you know synthesize them totally but i
1667.12s: do think that they're profound over time
1669.84s: and
1671.04s: another kind of dovetail off of that
1675.04s: i saw
1676.88s: a tweet that you put out always always
1679.68s: my favorite to see
1681.44s: what what tweets you got going on
1684.00s: and there was one that you put out on
1686.40s: the 19th
1688.24s: about breaking up the google and
1690.40s: facebook ad exchange monopolies
1692.96s: so a little bit of a change in gear but
1695.04s: i would be remiss if i didn't bring up a
1696.80s: chance to talk about facebook and your
1698.40s: love for them
1699.84s: and
1700.80s: and for anybody that's just listening
1702.64s: that's just not true at all
1704.80s: not a big fan
1706.16s: so um
1707.92s: but anyways can you talk to me a little
1709.84s: bit about you know that that tweet and
1712.00s: then specifically
1713.52s: um what you what you're targeting you
1716.32s: know when we're talking about the ad
1718.64s: monopoly between google and facebook and
1720.40s: the reason why i bring it up now
1722.32s: is a lot of the conversation we've had
1724.24s: so far has been very centered on this
1726.80s: same kind of concept it's different
1728.64s: space not exactly markets but two very
1730.96s: big market players
1732.48s: and they're exerting their power so i'd
1734.56s: love to hear you know just your take on
1736.48s: what is going on between google and
1738.08s: facebook the ad exchanges
1740.48s: and then kind of where you where we're
1742.56s: trying to go with this
1743.76s: yeah
1744.56s: thanks for bringing it up you know it's
1746.00s: it's a it's a thing that i'm i'm so
1748.96s: fascinated by and passionate about and
1751.60s: it's not what i do on a day-to-day basis
1753.52s: but
1754.24s: um you know i was fortunate enough to to
1756.80s: get to work
1758.08s: uh with you know some folks in the
1760.24s: senate who were
1762.16s: writing this bill
1763.84s: um and the idea was that
1767.28s: google and facebook
1768.96s: and other firms as well
1772.32s: run these ad exchanges and it's become a
1776.16s: really substantial economic force
1779.76s: it's responsible for a giant chunk of
1783.20s: each of those firms revenue and those
1784.88s: are two of the most valuable firms in
1786.40s: the world
1787.52s: and
1788.72s: not only do they operate in exchange but
1791.52s: they also operate
1793.52s: the brokers so they have
1795.92s: brokers that that they operate to buy
1798.40s: ads brokers they operate to sell ads
1801.04s: they operate the exchange and then from
1803.12s: a trading perspective who even knows
1804.96s: what's going on there's no transparency
1807.68s: into these operations whatsoever
1811.36s: sorry just a quick note i i pulled it up
1813.68s: for um
1814.80s: for facebook well meta right now
1817.36s: advertising is 94.9
1820.64s: essentially of their you know value
1822.40s: duration for market cap so it just you
1824.56s: know bolsters your point that they're
1826.48s: very interested in yeah yeah that's
1828.80s: right and and so they operate these
1830.64s: exchanges
1831.92s: and they have complete control
1834.32s: almost over every
1836.72s: aspect of what's taking place on those
1839.12s: exchange exchanges and there's no
1841.04s: transparency at all so the idea
1844.56s: that i was approached with was can we
1847.44s: take these ad exchanges and kind of fit
1851.44s: them into
1853.04s: the current framework of financial
1855.44s: regulation and because
1858.08s: in in financial regulation you know
1860.32s: you've got
1861.44s: decades of established precedent and
1864.08s: case law and you know regulatory
1866.32s: approaches and and a lot of experienced
1868.56s: people out there and and i thought wow
1871.76s: what what a great idea it was so
1874.08s: fascinating to me and and so i said yeah
1877.04s: i'd love to sort of think about how you
1879.28s: could do that and does it make sense and
1881.04s: what can we focus on and you know so i
1883.28s: worked with them and
1885.52s: i'm very pleased with the bill that came
1887.52s: out of it and it's a bill that has a lot
1889.12s: of bipartisan support i mean it's you
1891.44s: know it's being co-sponsored by um both
1894.88s: like
1895.68s: senator mike lee from utah and amy
1897.68s: klobuchar of minnesota right like the
1900.24s: you know both sides are interested in
1902.24s: this bill amongst other anti-trust bills
1904.96s: aimed at big tech and this is the kind
1907.12s: of thing that would first break up the
1909.28s: monopoly so that's that that's part part
1912.88s: of what i think is the most
1914.16s: revolutionary about this particular bill
1916.88s: it is taking aim square at these these
1919.52s: firms and it is saying you know they
1921.60s: need to be broken up which is a very
1923.52s: standard approach to antitrust but it's
1925.92s: really the first time that congress at
1927.92s: least that i'm aware of has said you
1929.68s: know we support that kind of
1931.68s: intervention because it's the only thing
1933.76s: you can really do with firms of this
1936.00s: size
1937.12s: so you start by breaking them up and you
1939.20s: don't let them operate
1941.12s: both brokers and the exchange you
1944.08s: you know provide disclosure and
1945.60s: transparency around how brokers are
1948.16s: routing to different ad exchanges and
1950.56s: what kind of execution quality they're
1952.64s: getting so very analogous to u.s
1954.72s: financial markets you put a duty of best
1957.12s: execution onto these brokers
1959.44s: and in fact the duty of best execution
1961.28s: in the bill would be stronger than the
1963.36s: one in u.s financial markets it would be
1965.52s: an order by order standard which is one
1967.84s: that i've advocated for in u.s markets
1970.16s: for many years now
1971.60s: um and you know so there are all sorts
1973.68s: of other details in the bill uh one
1977.04s: another one is about data ownership that
1978.88s: people will own their own data which is
1981.20s: it might seem like a really minor thing
1983.20s: but today in the stock market when you
1985.92s: send an order
1988.48s: you don't own that that order
1990.40s: information the exchange actually ends
1993.36s: up owning it and then they turn around
1995.84s: and they sell that
1997.60s: with these high-speed data feeds and
2000.16s: proprietary data feeds for exorbitant
2002.32s: amounts of money
2003.92s: so just that little detail of weight you
2006.32s: should own your data and not the
2007.76s: exchange could also prevent a huge set
2010.80s: of problems and conflicts of interest in
2012.48s: the ad market that we already see
2014.72s: in financial services so you know i
2016.88s: think it's great i think that big tech
2018.72s: monopolies are one of like the most
2020.64s: destructive forces in
2022.88s: in the us in the world um and and i
2025.84s: think again i i believe in competition
2028.48s: and i believe that when you get
2029.84s: concentrated corporate power you have to
2032.16s: intervene in order to try and break
2034.32s: things up and try and increase
2035.68s: competition
2037.28s: that's awesome yeah i i had a chance to
2039.68s: go through um the post and then the the
2042.24s: publication and i thought that that was
2044.00s: very educational i'll i'll link to those
2046.88s: two as well um in case anybody wants to
2049.92s: check it out and then for those that
2051.60s: don't know dave also wrote kind of a
2055.12s: i would almost call it like a burn piece
2056.88s: on on facebook's model in terms of the
2059.44s: way that they
2060.80s: um
2062.16s: create space for people to have uh
2064.88s: passionate disagreements
2067.36s: um
2068.32s: really you know the the argument to
2070.80s: summarize you know it seems like the the
2073.04s: argument is that there's
2074.64s: they use conflict as a way to
2077.28s: try and yeah drive engagement so that's
2079.52s: another just fascinating read and it's
2081.28s: another perspective that i honestly
2084.16s: i don't use social media that way
2086.08s: personally so i don't see a lot of that
2088.40s: but once you pointed it out it makes a
2090.96s: ton of sense because you know drama
2093.92s: is just a big thing you know that that
2096.32s: draws a lot of people's attention
2097.84s: whether it's good or bad it sells same
2100.16s: thing news agencies stuff like that use
2101.76s: that so i thought that was a really
2102.88s: interesting
2104.08s: um
2105.04s: take on it so we have a couple minutes
2107.04s: left
2108.00s: we've got to be efficient with our time
2109.76s: and there's a couple things that i want
2111.36s: to go over still so the first off last
2113.52s: time we spoke was
2115.28s: a couple of months ago maybe and you
2117.84s: were talking to me about avalanche
2121.28s: talk don't worry i'm letting you off the
2122.72s: hook on the other one
2124.16s: talk to me i was sure we were going to
2126.08s: talk about that that's okay we can talk
2127.84s: about it oh no
2129.68s: you know what i'm i'm leaving that one
2131.44s: alone i'm just kind of letting the tape
2133.04s: speak for itself
2137.12s: yeah i you know i
2138.88s: i think i still think that um
2142.24s: we are in some extraordinary
2143.36s: circumstances but you know i probably uh
2146.00s: underestimated the force of the fed
2149.12s: um in those circumstances but but when
2151.68s: you look at oil
2153.04s: as a result of this you know stupid war
2156.08s: um hard to argue that some structural
2158.88s: inflation isn't in place right now yeah
2161.09s: [Laughter]
2165.20s: i didn't say anything
2169.12s: back to avalanche
2172.72s: um but i am genuinely curious like
2175.52s: i look at the crypto market and i
2178.16s: continue to struggle to place
2181.20s: what it does
2182.64s: like and i i mean that just in terms of
2184.72s: how does it fit into the broader markets
2186.88s: there's lots of people it was an
2188.32s: inflation hedge
2190.40s: that edge ain't working you know it's
2192.88s: it's the new gold and you know
2194.88s: apparently gold is extremely volatile if
2197.92s: that's the you know what i mean it's
2198.80s: just like i see a lot of different
2200.72s: arguments on what it does
2203.60s: and beyond the aspirational side of
2206.16s: things
2207.20s: um i had a chance to look at a little
2209.28s: bit more like specifically avalanche and
2211.60s: some of the current technology and stuff
2213.12s: like that but i would just love to get
2215.28s: an update from you on you know just what
2217.92s: you think about avalanche today
2220.64s: and what your general disposition is
2224.16s: towards it in terms of how does it fit
2225.92s: into the broader cryptocurrency slash
2228.48s: blockchain space
2230.24s: sure and and you know i think um
2233.36s: crypto is a space so i
2235.68s: i i mean i was i think i've talked about
2237.60s: it before i bought bitcoin now 11 years
2240.00s: ago um i did not hold on to that bitcoin
2243.28s: of course but
2244.64s: i i have been in this market for as long
2247.92s: as you know most others um i it is not
2250.48s: my full-time job there are plenty of
2252.40s: people that have done that for much for
2254.32s: a very long time now but you know i have
2256.64s: been through i don't know this will be
2258.48s: the fourth i think crypto winter
2261.04s: um and so
2263.04s: the the price drops
2265.04s: they don't mean much to me um they they
2267.84s: happen
2268.84s: regularly uh
2270.56s: and so you know it is it's a brand new
2273.20s: asset class it's extremely volatile
2276.08s: um
2277.76s: is it potentially a long-term store of
2280.24s: value
2281.28s: um
2282.88s: i think so i think i and i think you
2285.68s: different cryptos serve different
2287.12s: purposes so right bitcoin
2289.92s: is is what i would call you know a
2292.08s: potential
2293.44s: long-term store of value a potential
2296.08s: inflation hedge
2297.60s: it has become highly correlated to
2300.80s: equity markets
2302.32s: um for all sorts of reasons but
2305.76s: um
2306.80s: you know if if you do believe that
2308.88s: inflation is problematic in the long run
2312.56s: um and you are looking for something
2314.96s: that is you know controlled from that
2317.52s: perspective bitcoin is is very appealing
2320.00s: in that way right
2321.27s: [Music]
2322.88s: as
2323.68s: from for avalanche i when i first
2326.48s: learned about it first i was looking to
2328.96s: better understand proof of stake
2331.20s: and i was looking for
2333.68s: um
2335.36s: something that had the flexibility for
2337.52s: broad adoption
2339.44s: and avalanche really fit the bill
2342.88s: it's proof-of-stake and consensus
2344.56s: algorithm i thought were so innovative
2347.04s: when i first learned about it that it
2349.04s: was almost enough for me just to jump in
2351.52s: based on that
2352.80s: um but but the the some of the features
2355.52s: that the the
2357.44s: network have said and it's it's it's
2359.68s: complicated but you know there's a thing
2361.36s: called subnets which allow you to sort
2363.52s: of stand up another chain on the
2365.44s: avalanche network and completely control
2368.00s: the the characteristics of that chain so
2369.76s: that you can have completely regulated
2373.04s: systems
2374.16s: that are perfectly compliant on top of
2376.72s: the avalanche chain for example
2379.60s: and so i do think that over time it's
2382.40s: one of the few that will win out and and
2385.52s: you know i've been a big fan of it for a
2387.68s: while
2388.56s: you know look the price has been
2389.92s: extremely volatile um a year and a half
2393.52s: ago it was trading you know for almost
2396.00s: nothing
2396.96s: now it's in the 30s it was trading at
2399.36s: high as high as like 160 at one point
2401.36s: which was crazy um
2403.76s: fun but you know crazy uh but you know i
2407.28s: i think that
2408.84s: what what you're looking at
2411.76s: what you're looking for in a crypto
2413.52s: currency is you're looking for something
2415.20s: that is
2416.16s: actually decentralized
2418.80s: and especially relative to some of the
2421.20s: other proof of stake systems out there
2424.00s: avalanche is far more decentralized
2425.76s: you're looking for something that is
2426.96s: being used today and the fees being
2429.68s: generated on avalanche are are like the
2432.72s: you know
2433.60s: top four or something behind bitcoin
2435.92s: ethereum and binance
2438.32s: and you're looking for something that's
2439.76s: cheap and fast
2441.60s: and that's what avalanche is it's
2442.88s: extremely cheap and extremely fast and
2444.88s: so to me that means that it can form the
2447.76s: basis of a future financial system right
2450.16s: it can disintermediate
2452.08s: uh large financial institutions it can
2455.44s: help to collateralize or securitize
2457.68s: things um without needing those kinds of
2460.80s: institutions it can facilitate loans
2464.00s: without needing those kinds of
2465.44s: institutions
2466.40s: you can use it for you know
2468.80s: mortgages and real estate transactions
2470.88s: eventually you can use it for you know
2473.20s: uh
2474.00s: offerings like token offerings
2475.76s: litigation offerings so
2477.68s: um i i think that the problem is you're
2480.72s: looking for okay well what does it do
2482.08s: today what is it really fixing or
2484.40s: changing and the problem is again it's
2486.48s: early days like avalanche has hardly
2488.08s: been around a year and a half now right
2490.80s: and so it's
2492.32s: you know it's still growing into
2494.56s: what it will be and a lot of crypto you
2497.04s: can say the same thing but i think that
2499.60s: there's some fascinating stuff in smart
2501.68s: contract technology that can help to
2504.40s: address issues in u.s equity markets for
2507.04s: example and the settlement and clearing
2508.80s: side of the business i think there are
2511.68s: some really interesting things in terms
2513.68s: of like tokenization and securitization
2516.88s: that
2517.76s: you know you can get
2519.52s: rid you know functionally of a lot of
2521.84s: counterparty risk in in systems like
2524.08s: this so you know i i i think that crypto
2527.28s: has a use case it has functionality um
2530.48s: but up until now it's still been the
2532.64s: purview of of a small set of people
2535.20s: because the user experience isn't there
2537.60s: and the interfaces aren't there to make
2539.28s: it accessible to the average person and
2542.32s: and you know think what you will of nfts
2544.24s: for example but nfts have helped to
2546.32s: address that
2547.52s: because they've helped to make crypto a
2549.68s: bit more accessible
2552.00s: and you know i i i love art i love
2555.20s: artwork and i think that nfts are a
2558.00s: fascinating new medium of art um and i
2561.44s: think that you know people that kind of
2562.96s: dismiss it are sort of missing the point
2565.76s: right like they're like oh well i can
2567.12s: just right click and download an nft
2568.80s: it's like yeah i can go take a picture
2570.00s: of the mona lisa but you know like
2572.08s: that doesn't mean that i own the mona
2573.84s: lisa right there's there's a difference
2576.32s: and that difference has always been sort
2578.24s: of a characteristic of visual art um and
2580.96s: i think always will be so
2582.88s: you know i i think that um
2585.28s: i'm i don't know i love it and i love
2587.68s: the space that it's creating and it's
2589.28s: like but i also see
2591.60s: crypto rediscovering a lot of securities
2594.48s: law
2596.72s: and it's it's very funny to see it's
2598.96s: like wait we didn't have investor
2600.48s: protection or you know like this this
2602.48s: luna ust thing happens like wait we
2604.72s: didn't have depository insurance what's
2607.04s: going on here and and so you know i i
2610.32s: think that that's gonna happen and the
2612.56s: space is going to recognize the value of
2614.48s: securities laws uh in a lot of ways but
2617.44s: maybe
2618.32s: eventually the the two worlds will come
2620.24s: together in a more efficient
2622.00s: decentralized disintermediated way which
2624.32s: is again sort of thematic of a lot of
2626.08s: the stuff that i like to talk about
2628.48s: yeah that's awesome i'm i'm definitely
2631.12s: i'm one of those people that i don't
2633.28s: personally understand nfts in terms of
2635.76s: like the appeal but i get the appeal for
2638.40s: other people and i could see how you
2641.04s: know i was watching people
2643.12s: you know talk about like what he does
2645.04s: and i think the stuff he makes is wild
2647.04s: which is kind of cool yeah but then
2650.08s: yeah i like i i can i can see that i'm
2652.96s: not very artistic myself i don't have
2655.04s: that part of my brain but yeah
2658.08s: i think my favorite part about the nfts
2660.08s: i gotta be honest with you is when
2661.84s: somebody has you know the nft and then
2663.68s: they come up with like a digital display
2665.44s: for it
2666.72s: that i because then i'm thinking like
2668.32s: that's that's just art just get a
2670.40s: painting man like you're right there but
2672.16s: then you know it doesn't have lights and
2673.68s: all that cool stuff so i get
2675.60s: i get a lot of people like it but i do
2676.96s: just get such a kick out of that you
2678.40s: want like a digital piece of art to
2680.00s: display physically that sounds like a
2681.76s: physical piece of digital art
2685.52s: you know but i mean people like people
2688.40s: were dismissive of you know pop art and
2690.96s: street art and banksy and that kind of
2693.12s: stuff and you know in the end
2695.28s: they were wrong and and art is art right
2697.76s: like it's like i don't pretend to
2699.12s: understand it uh i know a good piece
2702.08s: that like speaks to me and resonates
2704.08s: with me and i've seen nfts like that and
2706.16s: i've seen real art like that and yes you
2708.40s: know that's what can you do i think
2711.28s: it's easy to not understand this world
2713.92s: uh and to be dismissive of it um but you
2716.72s: know i just think that's
2718.96s: that's probably you know a boomer thing
2721.92s: i think so too yeah i really do and i
2723.76s: also think that
2724.96s: you know that's like one of the
2726.24s: downfalls of a lot of people is you know
2728.40s: if they don't immediately understand
2729.92s: something that they dismiss it yeah you
2731.84s: know like because i honestly think nfts
2733.92s: are actually going to be kind of
2735.60s: prolific for at least you know until
2737.68s: there's a new iteration of them or
2738.96s: something but just because
2740.56s: i don't personally understand them
2742.16s: totally it doesn't mean you know that
2744.32s: their effectiveness or their audience
2745.92s: isn't there because i think it's exactly
2747.44s: as you said
2749.12s: a lot of it comes down to the individual
2751.68s: interaction with that art and
2754.08s: people react to different pieces of art
2756.16s: in different ways and i think that
2758.08s: that's where it comes from yeah it does
2760.00s: seem like a lot of people though
2761.68s: are hesitant because it's like
2764.08s: it's just a money grab there's so many
2765.84s: people you know just piling into the
2768.00s: space but what art doesn't do that right
2770.32s: it's the same thing yeah same thing
2772.32s: right same like that same thing with
2773.84s: crypto like everyone's like oh it's just
2775.36s: a scam it's a ponzi it's like well you
2777.20s: know like welcome to markets right how
2778.96s: many scams and ponzis are there markets
2781.60s: you know it's this isn't a shock to
2783.60s: anyone you know that's what i mean it's
2785.28s: like crypto rediscovering securities
2787.04s: laws you know all these this these
2789.36s: frauds and scams that's just sort of
2791.20s: human nature to try and you know commit
2793.28s: crime and rip people off and it's human
2795.04s: nature to you know want easy money or
2797.44s: want to get rich quick
2798.96s: and uh you know so just because you can
2801.04s: do it online versus do it you know i
2803.28s: don't know over email or do it you know
2805.52s: in a physical place i don't know if
2807.20s: there's a big difference there
2808.88s: yeah yeah
2810.16s: i agree well i know that we are at time
2812.72s: i appreciate you hanging out with me for
2814.16s: a while i definitely am looking forward
2815.44s: to connecting with with you again in the
2817.12s: next you know a couple months
2818.88s: to take a pulse check on how things are
2820.96s: going i'm really excited to see you know
2822.88s: the terminal continue to grow which is
2824.56s: the platform
2825.76s: um that that you're working on and i
2828.32s: think that that's going to be such a
2829.68s: great tool for retail traders so i am
