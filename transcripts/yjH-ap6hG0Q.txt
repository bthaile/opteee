0.00s:  What is up apes outliers outlier apes, whoever we have coming to hang out.
8.16s:  I wish I could show you this setup I just got in place for the session tonight because
12.60s:  we have, we got a lot to talk about.
17.32s:  So I got I got seltzer waters.
20.04s:  I have drugs.
21.88s:  I got a set of medicine ready to rock and roll.
24.64s:  I got my other prescription anti inflammatory.
27.20s:  I even brought a snack for those that don't know.
30.00s:  I only eat once a day, which is normally around now, but I hold off.
35.40s:  So you know, whoever, who knows where this goes?
38.52s:  So I have my little protein pouch thing.
41.00s:  I don't really care about eating.
42.16s:  I'm one of those weird people.
43.24s:  I like, I couldn't care less if there is a pill that I could take that would give me
47.76s:  everything I need.
48.76s:  I would be all about that.
50.48s:  I would waste zero time with it, but that's not how life is.
54.80s:  So we, we're about to get stuck in like a tick.
59.16s:  That's the goal.
60.16s:  Let me grab this chat and we are going to be off to the races.
63.76s:  All right.
64.76s:  So what's the game plan for today?
65.76s:  I have a couple things that I really want to do.
68.36s:  And then everything else that pops up along the ways you all know I'm here for it.
72.76s:  We can go left, right upside down, sideways, down for whatever we want to cover.
78.04s:  So feel free to throw in the chat.
79.52s:  If there's anything you want to take a look at any ideas, it's all, it's all fair game.
83.68s:  So now what I would like to cover today though is my original game plan is to go back
89.96s:  through more of roaring kiddie's old trades.
94.24s:  And I want to use the on demand feature fingers crossed that it's working.
99.60s:  And I want to use the on demand feature and think or swim so that we can like actually
103.52s:  look at the market based on the differences in his portfolio.
107.76s:  So the first one that we're going to do it will be his portfolio as it was that first
111.64s:  post I think it was what in 20.
114.52s:  I don't remember 22.
115.52s:  No, it wasn't 22 is 2020 maybe whatever it was.
118.60s:  Well, I have the the Reddit thread up with all this stuff.
122.28s:  So I want to go through those and I want to take a look and funny enough.
127.92s:  It's actually even more important now to do this in my opinion with the trades that we
133.32s:  saw last week.
135.68s:  So my thought is we start with what happened last week.
140.48s:  And then we can dive into his historic trades and stuff like that.
144.92s:  But you know, we got to say hello to everybody.
147.08s:  So we got co co yo why why that's a hell of a name.
153.08s:  They say going to be a good one.
155.16s:  Love me some speculation.
156.16s:  Yeah, there's going to be some heavy heavy speculation in this one.
160.64s:  So that's straight up.
163.56s:  No capitals says tinfoil hats on.
165.56s:  I have mine ready to go.
167.40s:  The Viking tin hat is ready to it's ready to rock and roll whenever we need it.
174.32s:  Probably not much need up front, but we'll I mean, we'll see where we go.
177.64s:  Who knows it's going to get weird in here.
178.96s:  I think we all kind of know that it's it's it's about to get real.
185.12s:  We got roaring clitty probably one of the best names on planet earth.
190.04s:  One fact I have dryer sheets in my pocket because I was in the process of throwing them
194.12s:  out earlier.
195.12s:  But then my wife was like organizing stuff and there was a perfect opportunity for me to
200.60s:  grab her phone and then take a bunch of pictures of the dog.
204.24s:  I love doing that.
205.64s:  So I mean, like normally I can get like 50 to like 150 photos done before she realizes
210.36s:  which is kind of fun for me.
212.16s:  So that's why there's dryer sheets in my pocket.
214.12s:  In case anybody was wondering.
217.32s:  We got dark mark.
218.32s:  I wonder where light mark is.
220.60s:  Aviator geek.
222.00s:  I mean, that's kind of a good.
223.84s:  I would I would like my aviators to be geeks.
226.56s:  So that's good.
227.56s:  Threshold solutions is here.
229.56s:  Reese raptures.
230.56s:  That's kind of a heavy name.
232.04s:  Dirt Shlup.
233.28s:  What up?
234.28s:  Dirt Shlup Ricky Selgato says Eric, how would you recommend trading the downside of GME
238.96s:  after big runups?
239.96s:  Yeah, we can talk about that in a little bit.
241.44s:  I know some people get really weird about that conversation.
244.40s:  I was actually talking with a few folks in the discord about stuff like that.
248.08s:  But I'm I mean, I'll talk about it, right?
250.88s:  Like it's it's still a tradable product.
253.36s:  It's still going to exhibit movements.
255.24s:  I personally won't short stock in GameStop and I really don't like taking downside like long
261.04s:  term downside positions really in anything.
264.80s:  Because for me, carrying a bearish position is kind of like betting against the success
269.52s:  of a company, which I never really like that vibe.
271.52s:  Unless it's Robin Hood.
272.72s:  I'll fade the shit.
274.32s:  I'll add a Robin Hood into the fucking dirt.
277.12s:  That one I'm okay with.
278.12s:  I will.
279.12s:  Yep.
280.12s:  No problem.
281.12s:  I will I'll take a mortgage out on the house to take the capital out and then use that
285.96s:  to fade Robin Hood.
287.52s:  Like that's straight up.
288.80s:  Don't care about that one.
289.80s:  But most other companies, I prefer not to fade them.
292.28s:  However, I'll trade anything in any direction if it's moving.
296.80s:  Because again, like for me, I'm a trader.
300.16s:  That's literally how I make a living is by trading.
303.28s:  I need things to move.
304.28s:  Otherwise, your boy can't get his cool little protein pouch thing and then I'll die.
310.00s:  Right?
311.00s:  That's kind of what it boils down to.
312.00s:  And by the way, in case you were wondering, I did get an MRI last Friday, whoever built
317.12s:  those tubes.
318.76s:  I don't know what size human being they were planning on putting in those, but it's not
322.24s:  like in a normal size and adult.
324.08s:  But anyways, those are expensive.
325.88s:  So with that, need to trade.
328.68s:  Otherwise, there's no way to fit in the fucking MRIs.
332.00s:  It's all a giant problem.
333.60s:  So that is the way I think about markets.
336.96s:  We can absolutely talk about trading the movements in GameStop because that's one of the coolest
341.40s:  things about the stock is that it moves all over the fucking place.
345.84s:  And I traded it last week and I'll talk about some of those trades if we want because
350.60s:  I mean, I still have my carry position in GameStop.
354.28s:  But I started using options again, really short term because I've seen this movie before.
361.72s:  I know and we'll take a look at it in a second.
364.32s:  Let me finish saying hello to everybody.
365.68s:  So Ricky bring that back up in a few minutes after I say hello to everybody and we'll get
369.44s:  right into it.
371.24s:  Chewie says everybody gives him, give him a thumbs up.
373.96s:  I mean, it wouldn't hurt, right?
375.48s:  It's kind of like it's a nice thing to do.
377.48s:  I wouldn't blame you if you did it.
379.44s:  I think it would be appropriate.
381.32s:  Joe Tatos in the house, Marcus Trader says question, if I know the link of option, but
386.84s:  overwhelming where to start over 60 strategies, any video where to start from, come on, big
393.40s:  dog.
394.40s:  You know I have a million videos.
397.12s:  So I'm going to drop you two videos to playlists with a bunch of videos.
403.28s:  So who's this for?
405.08s:  Marcus.
406.08s:  So Marcus, this first link is my options 101 playlist.
409.36s:  So you can kind of poke through that.
410.80s:  See what's applicable to you.
412.48s:  And then the second one is my options 201 playlist, which kind of builds on some of
418.40s:  the things adds a little bit of complexity to it.
421.92s:  And then this playlist, this is a video I launched today about how I trade options,
427.52s:  which I actually think is a really good synopsis specifically for your scenario.
432.40s:  And then this last video is a options trading for beginners live stream.
439.24s:  So this literally goes back.
441.28s:  We've been doing this options trading for beginners thing every Friday.
445.32s:  I think we just finished episode 13, right?
448.36s:  So it's like three plus months that we've been doing a beginner session every single
452.72s:  Friday.
453.52s:  So that last playlist is essentially that.
456.08s:  And the first couple of videos in that playlist is straight up for beginners.
459.84s:  It is starting from the fucking basics and working all the way through how to place
463.76s:  traits.
464.76s:  And then the last few videos have been more so like practical application and stuff.
468.40s:  So a bunch of resources in there for you.
471.24s:  Absolutely, absolutely happy to help with that.
475.60s:  Now the cliff notes version though for you, Marcus Trader is here's what I would tell
480.20s:  anybody and let me grab this really quick, quick side note.
485.12s:  This is more so just for options trading in general.
487.72s:  But I think this is such an important message to get out to anybody interested in trading
491.48s:  options.
492.48s:  This is my giant ugly PowerPoint that I've been building forever.
496.84s:  And I just kind of well, not forever.
498.20s:  That's super dramatic.
499.20s:  I've recently started building it.
500.40s:  But this is what I think for any new options trader, this is the way to learn in my opinion.
507.56s:  Start with defining a profit mechanism.
510.08s:  Stock goes up.
511.32s:  Stock goes down.
512.32s:  Volatility goes up.
513.32s:  Volatility goes down.
514.64s:  Stock pays dividend.
516.32s:  Stock gets added to S&P 500 and there's a litany of studies that display that there's
521.76s:  typically drift over the next three months.
525.04s:  There's a million things.
526.84s:  How do I know how far it might go up?
528.80s:  If it goes down how far does it typically go down when I think it's going to go up?
531.92s:  How long does it take?
533.32s:  All of those details have to be ironed out.
535.32s:  That's the idea of measuring.
537.32s:  Then we fit options into the picture.
540.76s:  So notice when I talk about this idea of learning options, the first two steps, I
545.36s:  think it's going to go up.
546.68s:  How long does it take?
548.36s:  All of those details have to be ironed out.
550.36s:  That's the idea of measuring.
552.36s:  Then we fit options into the picture.
555.36s:  The first two steps have nothing to do with options.
559.48s:  Nothing to do with options.
560.48s:  You don't inject options until step three and step four in my opinion.
566.48s:  And it's because so many people start trading options kind of like this, right?
569.68s:  You said that you know 60 strategies or you're familiar with 60 strategies.
573.72s:  Technically there's unlimited strategies.
576.48s:  Options are literally just a way to trade things, but you have to identify what you're
582.04s:  trading first and be good at identifying what you're trading first.
586.36s:  People blame options all the time for losing money.
588.64s:  It's not the fucking options.
590.16s:  Options are agnostic.
591.16s:  They're not there to help you or hurt you.
593.04s:  Options don't care.
594.36s:  Options just do what options do.
596.16s:  What probably is missing from the picture is these two steps because here's what I can
600.92s:  tell you.
602.04s:  If you're good at trading things directionally, let's say you're good technical analyst,
607.24s:  you're good fundamental analyst, whatever it is, Nancy Pelosi.
610.60s:  They're out here crushing it and they're doing mostly longer term trades with options for
614.84s:  leverage.
616.16s:  So they have the profit mechanism down which inside are trading.
620.28s:  Who knows?
621.28s:  I mean, it's all above board, right?
622.28s:  I'm sure that they're good.
624.12s:  Or maybe fundamental analysis comes into the picture who really knows?
630.64s:  Really jokes aside, the point being is even in their scenario, they're just using options
634.76s:  to amplify the position.
636.36s:  So if you don't have a solid method to trade something profitably, whatever that mechanism
642.92s:  is, options don't magically fix it.
645.60s:  They exacerbate it.
647.28s:  So they enhance what you're doing both if you're good at picking something to the right
651.68s:  side or whatever your methodology is.
654.16s:  These will amplify it.
655.56s:  Hence roaring kitty.
657.00s:  When I was going back through his all his previous options positions, when I was looking
660.44s:  at his original trackers, he used to track stocks, equity positions and stocks, then he
664.24s:  started layering options.
666.04s:  Why is that?
667.04s:  Because they amplify this underlying tool that he's developed, which is profit mechanisms.
673.48s:  So that is what I would recommend for anybody that's interested in learning about options,
680.36s:  how to start learning about them is literally don't even fucking worry about options until
685.84s:  there's something you can reliably with some degree of accuracy, identify and predict.
691.96s:  If you do not have that, then these won't fix anything.
696.04s:  They will just make it worse.
697.80s:  So that is my point 02.
701.40s:  Tanner says Saturday nights are UFC nights.
703.44s:  So you usually have to watch these live streams after the fact, but I had to catch this one
707.08s:  live after the recent Deavision Inn against yeah, for sure.
709.68s:  And I mean, let's be honest, for the UFC live streams, you could probably skip the pre-lims
713.44s:  and be okay.
714.44s:  By the way, cheers.
715.72s:  We got to get my first drug out of the way.
718.08s:  We have them kind of phased out.
722.76s:  I think that one I just took is to help with broad inflammation or some shit.
727.60s:  I don't know.
728.60s:  Kind of like what I survive off of right now.
730.00s:  I just got my MRI though.
731.16s:  So we'll see what's up.
733.76s:  So yeah, Tanner, skip the pre-lims dog.
736.56s:  There's nothing in there.
737.56s:  Damn says I have some jam.
741.16s:  Jam 2 of 2025 45 covered calls.
744.84s:  I think see expected more volume and volatility.
752.08s:  How would you manage those?
753.68s:  Sam, I'm not going to lie, dog.
756.12s:  You just completely fucked me up.
759.00s:  I'm aware that you have some I'm assuming Jan 2025 45 covered calls that I'm same page
765.52s:  here.
767.32s:  I can I think C can expect more volume and volatility.
774.08s:  C can is GME.
776.20s:  I think GME can expect C. But I don't understand how somebody would type in C like this and mean
782.72s:  GME unless it's spell check.
784.84s:  Maybe you're on your phone for the people that are watching the live streams.
789.20s:  What device do you typically watch from?
791.04s:  Is it like a phone, a laptop, a TV?
794.56s:  I'm just trying to understand Sam and whether or not we need to call an ambulance for
798.64s:  Sam.
799.64s:  All right.
801.64s:  All right.
802.64s:  So Tanner's down the phone Vladimir iPad PC PC PlayStation 3 curveball didn't expect that.
808.80s:  So a lot of people on the phone.
810.88s:  Archduke PC.
812.52s:  How do you have a name like Archduke PC?
816.56s:  And that's confusing.
818.68s:  Okay.
819.68s:  So it's a lot of PC phones.
822.00s:  Aviator Geek has me an iMacs theater.
824.08s:  That's terrifying.
825.08s:  Honestly, if I'm in an iMacs theater, you're going to have to I'm literally going to go
828.56s:  to a faceless channel.
830.20s:  I think the last thing anybody needs to see in anything like that is my fat freaking head.
836.68s:  Yeah, that's terrifying.
838.40s:  All right.
839.40s:  So did Sam chime in?
840.40s:  All right.
841.40s:  So most people on the phone.
842.40s:  Okay.
843.40s:  So maybe.
844.40s:  Maybe Sam is on the phone and we don't have to call an ambulance or not necessarily having
849.88s:  a stroke.
852.88s:  Um.
853.88s:  Well, Sam, if you let me know if you reiterate what that is, just so I can understand better.
861.84s:  Okay.
862.84s:  Here we go.
863.84s:  Sam is on the phone.
864.84s:  Everybody.
865.84s:  Sam's here.
866.84s:  Don't worry.
867.84s:  Sam is here.
868.84s:  Sam says, sorry on the phone.
869.84s:  I have GN 2025 covered calls.
870.84s:  I don't know if to wait for the pop and roll up or buy now sell higher volume.
873.32s:  Okay.
874.32s:  So Sam, you boy needs a couple more details here.
877.08s:  The first detail is I need to know what the basis is in the underlying.
880.72s:  Again, assuming we're talking about GME.
882.84s:  If it's not that's fine, I just need to know what the basis is.
885.64s:  The second thing I need to know is what you sold those calls for between both of those.
891.40s:  I'll be able to at least try and help.
895.44s:  That's the idea.
897.48s:  Warring clitty says I'm in VR.
898.96s:  Oh, God.
899.96s:  That's even worse.
900.96s:  I don't man.
903.20s:  I do not like looking at myself.
904.88s:  So I cannot imagine like VR like right there.
908.76s:  That's terrifying.
911.40s:  Sam says I'm down 100% on the calls.
914.04s:  That's okay.
915.04s:  So Sam, appreciate the answer.
916.72s:  I'm going to reiterate the question though, because they still need to know that.
920.32s:  It's very helpful.
921.56s:  Those details are important.
925.12s:  Because we can look at some different ways to manage the position.
928.92s:  So I need to know basis of the underlying and I need to know what we sold the short
935.20s:  calls at.
936.20s:  Okay.
937.76s:  While Sam is hooking us up with that, Nick says I really should because I'm pretty good
944.28s:  at picking them, watch every fight usually.
946.92s:  Sports betting is the thing.
948.80s:  Sports what I would, I don't really sports bet personally, but I do know quite a few
953.06s:  options traders that are also sports bettors.
956.24s:  You and Sinclair is not so much of a big sports bettor, but he likes it a lot.
960.88s:  He just wrote a new book with some sort of well-known sports bettor from Twitter, X,
968.00s:  whatever the platform's called now.
969.56s:  So it's absolutely applicable because if you, sports betting is probabilities, right?
974.16s:  There's a bookie assigning probabilities to different events.
976.52s:  That's all it is.
977.52s:  That's really funny because when I would bet sports with my friends, they would come up
980.46s:  with these crazy ass parlays and I literally would just play the probabilities and crush
985.00s:  most of them for a sporting event that I don't fucking know anything about.
989.40s:  So if somebody's playing football and they're doing goal touch score units, I don't care
993.94s:  at all.
994.94s:  I'm just trying to play the probabilities.
997.22s:  So yeah.
999.22s:  All right, so let's take a look now.
1001.88s:  I think we can get, I think we can get started.
1005.12s:  Okay, so Sam hooked us up.
1006.60s:  All right.
1007.60s:  Sam said he sold him at 147.
1010.64s:  Sam, you are, I think now you're starting to break my balls because I thought I've been
1015.66s:  pretty clear with the details on the need.
1017.76s:  I'll try again.
1019.36s:  The details I need are what is the underlying value that you got in at the underlying.
1025.24s:  So the covered call part got the call part, which is great.
1027.92s:  And now need what we got into the underlying at.
1032.36s:  That's the next part.
1033.36s:  Those are two pieces of details I need underlying basis, short call basis.
1037.72s:  We got the short call basis out of the way, which is fantastic news.
1041.68s:  Now we need the underlying parts still.
1045.08s:  I'm literally going to model your trade in here and then we can talk about it together
1048.92s:  because I think it's a good exercise.
1053.88s:  Sam says, shit, sorry, I'm completely fucking with you.
1057.24s:  There's nothing to be sorry about literally at all.
1059.80s:  We're just poking some fun in just perfect Sam.
1065.76s:  And then the last question I'm throwing a curve ball here is for the basis that we got
1073.00s:  in at how many shares are we talking about?
1076.28s:  Do we have 100 shares against one call, 200 shares against two calls or one call?
1083.40s:  What does that look like?
1084.40s:  Because again, that's also going to influence what I would do.
1089.88s:  Everybody we all know roaring Titi just popped in.
1092.48s:  So we have to give a giant shout out to roaring Titi.
1095.80s:  Roaring Titi and roaring clitty make my day.
1098.48s:  And then Vladimir off Putin that I don't know why, but that is just fucking hilarious.
1102.96s:  To me, big fan of off Putin as well.
1108.44s:  Having a great time, 2000 shares, nine call sold.
1110.92s:  Okay, perfect.
1111.92s:  So there's a really important lesson here.
1114.24s:  So let's start with this.
1115.80s:  We'll start with 2000 shares at $19.
1120.76s:  And obviously that'll be an average basis I presume just going off of guessing.
1125.96s:  And so here's what that would look like now.
1130.00s:  And then we have nine of these 20.
1133.84s:  Oh, there it is.
1137.92s:  17, Jan 25.
1138.92s:  I think he said the 45s.
1141.32s:  45s, 45s.
1142.92s:  Yeah.
1143.92s:  So 25, 45s.
1148.12s:  These were sold originally for dollar 47, 147.
1158.72s:  And let's analyze those.
1159.72s:  We need nine of those.
1162.16s:  So here's the trade as it was placed.
1164.96s:  So here is roaring Titi says, LOL, there's a roaring clitty.
1170.80s:  Roaring clitty says, yo, I don't know if we've ever been in the chat at the same time.
1174.16s:  So I don't, this is a, this is a magical moment.
1177.00s:  I think we all need to just revel in the chat for a second because roaring Titi just meant
1181.96s:  roaring clitty.
1183.68s:  And I mean, to me that, that feels like fireworks of some sort like this.
1192.16s:  That feels like a magical moment to me.
1194.00s:  So I just want to celebrate that with you all that we now have roaring Titi, roaring clitty
1198.96s:  and they just met one another for the first time.
1201.12s:  Fantastic.
1202.60s:  Okay.
1205.76s:  Now that that beautiful moment is aside.
1210.28s:  Make says, what if roaring Kitty joined the chat with roaring clitty, roaring Titi?
1214.44s:  To be honest, to be honest, big fan of the cat and his work, love it.
1221.00s:  Love D.F.E.
1222.00s:  But I have to be honest, I still like the name, roaring clitty and roaring Titi more.
1226.88s:  I just keep it in a buck.
1228.44s:  Love roaring Kitty.
1229.44s:  Nothing but respect for him.
1231.44s:  But I would like that name even.
1234.80s:  I just saw simple Rick's chat, which completely derailed me.
1243.96s:  Complete thought process.
1247.96s:  Come on.
1253.16s:  Shout out to simple Rick.
1256.20s:  Oh, simple Rick.
1260.60s:  I feel you brother.
1262.44s:  Okay.
1266.76s:  Okay.
1267.76s:  Back to this.
1270.24s:  So let's talk about a couple of really important concepts here.
1274.04s:  First, what do you guys think about this ratio?
1277.36s:  If we have 2000 long calls against nine short calls, what do you think?
1284.64s:  What are your thoughts?
1285.64s:  Good, bad, like that, don't like that.
1287.84s:  But do something different.
1288.84s:  Talk to me.
1289.84s:  Sam says, two, did I not say 2000 shares?
1301.48s:  My bad.
1302.48s:  I have 2000 shares in there that might have just been a little bit dyslexia.
1307.28s:  Give your boy a break.
1308.28s:  I just got my entire, my entire brain just got derailed by a comment.
1313.24s:  Come on, man.
1314.24s:  Fucking cut me some slack here.
1317.04s:  But yes, Sam, I got the 2000 shares at 19 and then I have the nine short calls 45
1322.56s:  at $1.47.
1323.56s:  All right.
1324.56s:  So let's talk about these quick.
1325.76s:  The first thing, I love that it's essentially less than a two to one ratio.
1331.24s:  This is good.
1332.56s:  So the reason why this is good is because these short calls, there's nine of them, which
1340.40s:  can take up to 900 total shares.
1343.44s:  So you notice how there's still upside potential in this trade.
1347.32s:  So we're collecting a little bit of money upfront, but we have a lot of upward runway.
1353.76s:  So that part, I like a lot.
1356.04s:  Now here's the problem I see.
1360.28s:  Even if GameStop goes above 45, then back down or above whatever GameStop does, doesn't
1367.00s:  really matter.
1368.44s:  What matters in my opinion is that this is going to take forever.
1374.20s:  We are now going to have to make sure that we hold at least 900 shares as long as this
1379.52s:  short call is on, which is very likely to stay underwater for a large duration of the
1386.16s:  trade before it starts showing a profit.
1388.96s:  That is everything to do with the way that options behave.
1392.48s:  If you look at the theta on these options, it's three cents a day.
1396.92s:  So three dollars per day will come out of this and it will slow down as more of this
1402.88s:  theta comes out and there's less theta to come out of it if they stay far out of the
1407.84s:  money.
1408.84s:  So one of the things that I would think about if this were my trade, first of all, is
1414.40s:  not selling those short calls that far out in time.
1417.64s:  I personally would keep them within 60 DTE.
1422.20s:  And the reason why I would keep them within 60 DTE, if we go to the handy dandy notebook,
1427.52s:  the handy dandy outlier PowerPoint doesn't sound as good as the handy dandy notebook.
1432.92s:  You'll see theta decay starts to really accelerate within 60 days.
1437.72s:  So with those being out 132 days, kind of out in this zone, they're just kind of losing
1444.52s:  a little tiny bit each day in tying things up.
1448.76s:  So that's just one note.
1450.44s:  The other thing is because again, in this same scenario, if you do a shorter term trade,
1454.36s:  you can cycle them faster and you will make way more money doing that than selling something
1459.64s:  that that's that is that far out.
1461.84s:  So just a general admin note.
1464.08s:  Now in terms of the risk of these falling in the money, obviously there's a risk if
1468.96s:  GameStop goes above 45.
1470.96s:  What I can tell you is at least in the near term, the probability of GameStop going above
1477.04s:  45 and then staying there for an extended duration, it seems lower to me.
1482.16s:  That doesn't mean GameStop can't get there.
1484.44s:  I think especially as we start to understand more about what Cohen RC is thinking about
1490.68s:  doing with this poor Billy that they're sitting on, that will be really informative to
1495.56s:  how they choose to transform the business.
1498.12s:  So when I look at something like this, I think it's fine, but I think that this is just
1505.92s:  going to tie up a lot of the trade unnecessarily.
1510.04s:  That's my opinion.
1511.40s:  So going back to the original question though, hold on.
1519.40s:  There was a very specific question before we got into all these.
1522.48s:  I don't know if I should wait for a pop and roll up or just buy now to sell later at
1527.08s:  a higher premium or just buy some calls.
1530.08s:  So Sam, in that context, what I can tell you is literally dude, you're talking about
1534.64s:  completely different strategies, right?
1537.88s:  The idea of buying a call versus selling a call in that context, they're completely
1542.32s:  different.
1543.32s:  So my biggest recommendation there would be start by defining what you're trying to do.
1549.24s:  That's what I would say because selling short calls versus buying calls in this scenario,
1553.20s:  they're literally completely different.
1555.88s:  So I would try to understand what the goal is and then make adjustments off of that personally.
1563.92s:  That's what I'm thinking of.
1566.60s:  So yeah, in this case, I wouldn't bother doing, well again, it's like for one, I wouldn't
1573.52s:  put that trade on.
1574.84s:  Two, if I put that trade on, the entire premise would be to just wait, to just leave those
1579.56s:  sit until I can make money on them.
1582.32s:  So the last thing I would do is sell them and then as soon as they're not making money,
1587.96s:  buy them back for a loss.
1590.48s:  Because then I've accomplished nothing other than losing money.
1593.44s:  So obviously this isn't to point fun or anything.
1596.36s:  It's to try to talk about the way that I would conceive of a position like this so that
1602.32s:  it makes sense.
1604.00s:  Because you have to know at the onset of the position that this is going to show a loss
1608.52s:  for the overwhelming majority of the life cycle of this trade, just how she goes.
1614.36s:  So yeah.
1615.68s:  All right.
1618.36s:  Let's talk about what happened this weekend.
1623.84s:  By this weekend, obviously I mean yesterday.
1627.64s:  Don't know why I said this weekend.
1628.64s:  I was kind of stupid.
1629.64s:  Sorry.
1630.64s:  Why happened yesterday?
1632.84s:  Well, Roryn Kitty comes alive and he drops this.
1638.00s:  Ha, drops.
1639.84s:  I didn't even mean to do that, but it fits so well.
1642.92s:  He drops this.
1644.72s:  So here's the funny thing that happened with this.
1651.88s:  When I first, before I saw this come up, this was posted right at 0900 Pacific time.
1660.28s:  Right when this came up.
1662.76s:  Before this, I got hit on a few alerts in GameStop.
1667.40s:  I actually placed the trade based on those alerts because I expected something to happen.
1673.48s:  It didn't play out precisely as I anticipated, but it wasn't that far different from what
1678.64s:  I anticipated.
1679.92s:  This is one of those rare kind of scenarios where I did something and I wasn't completely
1684.44s:  wrong within the first three seconds of doing what I did.
1688.16s:  It's you got to really relish in those moments because the vast majority of the time, at least
1693.72s:  for me, the stock market finds a way to just perpetually make me wrong, which I really
1698.84s:  appreciate what the stock market's trying to do.
1700.68s:  It's trying to build me some character, I suppose, but I feel like I have enough of that
1704.64s:  at this point.
1705.64s:  Also a giant shout out to the apes.
1708.40s:  There's 140 people hanging out right now getting ready to dive into the background of
1713.92s:  Rohingya Kitty.
1714.92s:  So shout out to you guys.
1716.24s:  Absolutely stoked to go down this path with everybody.
1723.48s:  Generational Campbell says, what alerts do you use?
1726.56s:  I use a bunch of different scans.
1728.80s:  So I use a few different platforms to help me identify abnormal movement.
1734.36s:  So one of them is this.
1738.40s:  And I'll use this is kind of like the homepage that I use for this.
1743.08s:  And it essentially lets me identify things that are moving a lot and then it identifies
1748.04s:  unusual options activity essentially real time.
1751.28s:  So that's one of the primary things that I will keep an eyeball on.
1754.84s:  And what I do is I add filters to look at specific stocks because otherwise if you don't
1760.28s:  do that, you'll get a bunch of stuff like this like Apple and they're using unusual options
1766.04s:  essentially to look at big trades and whatnot.
1768.36s:  But it's like Apple in video like this.
1771.16s:  You'll see these on the board all the time because they're massive.
1775.20s:  They're going to move all the time.
1777.36s:  So to me, that's actually kind of just noise.
1780.12s:  So I create filters so that I can see the stuff that I want to see.
1784.40s:  And then the other thing that I do is I scan through think or swim the platform itself
1789.76s:  so that I can have a clear sense of what's popping up, what's moving.
1794.80s:  And that's essentially how I see it.
1796.32s:  I'm looking for expansion in individual contracts.
1799.24s:  I'm looking for large trades.
1801.16s:  I'm looking for persistent trades that add up to a big, big value, those kinds of things.
1809.20s:  So yeah, that's like the general concept behind what I try to do.
1815.00s:  And again, I can show you in here what that might look like.
1818.16s:  It obviously won't look like much in here because the market's closed.
1821.40s:  But if we drop in here, I can look for stuff that's looking for the options itself that
1827.64s:  they've increased at least x percent.
1830.12s:  This is the volume for the specific strike price.
1835.36s:  And 50% is still way too low.
1837.36s:  Normally I'll do like 100, 150, 200 as a minimum.
1841.92s:  And again, I don't know, yeah, so there will be a bunch of like, and you'll notice that
1844.96s:  like there's millions of returns.
1847.08s:  So for something to grow by 100%, isn't actually a ton.
1851.36s:  So what I'll do in this context is I'll look for stuff that has at least a certain amount
1856.44s:  of downside volume.
1858.68s:  And then I'll look at volume counts on the day.
1862.60s:  And I'll say, okay, well, clearly something strange is going on in AG.
1867.44s:  What's going on?
1868.44s:  I have no idea.
1869.44s:  But what I can tell you is that the one day relative volume in it is absurd.
1875.16s:  Something's going on.
1876.16s:  So then I go look, that's kind of the idea.
1878.76s:  I just go through and I look for ideas following that kind of path.
1885.28s:  So then that's how I catch the initial trade.
1889.36s:  And if we come in here, we can take a look at that initial trade together.
1896.20s:  Let's take a look at, I'll look at the last week in total just because I think it paints
1902.00s:  a clear picture.
1903.00s:  And then let me get rid of this.
1905.64s:  So for GameStop, as you all know, I literally do a daily video and I look at GameStop every
1912.12s:  day.
1913.12s:  And in my daily video, I don't always cover GameStop, but at least for the last like
1918.28s:  three months, I almost always cover GameStop.
1922.16s:  At least a little bit.
1923.64s:  Part of it is just because I feel a level of commitment to you all.
1926.60s:  Like I've said this a million times.
1928.28s:  Once I start doing something, I continue doing it.
1932.36s:  And I don't want anybody to feel like I'm bailing.
1934.52s:  Now if there's a video without GameStop, it's not obviously that I'm bailing covering
1938.04s:  it.
1939.04s:  It's just that sometimes it's just not doing a whole lot.
1941.36s:  And I'm kind of focusing the time elsewhere.
1943.96s:  Also, cheers next round of drugs.
1945.92s:  This is the drug time of day.
1947.20s:  I have like three periods where I got to take a bunch of drugs.
1950.12s:  Next down the hatch.
1954.20s:  Hey, there she goes.
1959.36s:  So I got alerted for these yesterday.
1965.96s:  And essentially at 842, 0842, this is Pacific time.
1973.60s:  842 37 and 38.
1976.04s:  I see these two trades come through.
1980.40s:  And I see these two trades coming up to be a pretty significant sum of money.
1990.88s:  They were bought right around where GameStop was trading.
1994.84s:  So if we take a look, I'll slide this over here, I guess.
1999.08s:  Yeah, this is fine.
2000.60s:  This is a daily five minute chart.
2004.96s:  So this is looking at the specific day.
2007.20s:  So if we go to 0840 and 45 in here, you can see where GameStop is trading.
2017.16s:  I realize that you can't because that's in the way.
2019.72s:  So it's trading right around at the money.
2021.52s:  So those 22 and a half were like literally right at the money, which makes sense.
2027.04s:  That's not outside of what I've seen the cat do previously.
2030.80s:  Seems completely, completely in line.
2032.92s:  He typically seems to go a little further out of the money.
2036.20s:  Now all of this is predicated on this trade coming through, which is really interesting.
2043.84s:  There is absolutely nothing that directly ties him to this.
2050.56s:  Because in terms of strike selection, I think it's weird that it was 22 and a half.
2055.84s:  I haven't seen him use those kind of strikes before the have strikes.
2059.60s:  The other thing is this was a really short dated option.
2062.98s:  This was expiring in 13 set.
2066.46s:  That's also really weird to me.
2068.36s:  And that's part of the goal for today's session is to go back through all of his old trades
2073.08s:  to see if what I think is weird is actually weird.
2077.32s:  Because again, my goal in looking at this stuff is to share some of the analysis skill set
2084.72s:  that I've built over the last 16 plus years of trading.
2088.72s:  So what that means is I have ideas.
2090.92s:  I have hunches on what may or may not have happened.
2093.64s:  It's kind of swirling around the back of my head.
2096.16s:  But I don't just take those at face value.
2098.32s:  I force myself to validate things.
2101.04s:  So that's actually part of the session today is to go back and validate some of these
2106.28s:  things.
2107.28s:  Because to me, that's strange.
2109.04s:  The amount of money that has the cat written all over it.
2111.96s:  No doubt.
2112.96s:  The size of these trades in terms of lots also has the cat written all over it.
2117.16s:  This exploration does not have the cat written all over it.
2120.32s:  This strike selection does not have the cat written all over it.
2123.88s:  These just don't make a lot of sense to me.
2127.16s:  So this happens at 0 842 37 38 again Pacific time.
2132.88s:  Then if we take a look, this comes out at 0 900.
2138.56s:  So this is what I infer from these.
2142.56s:  And again, I don't think I need the tin foil hat just yet.
2146.64s:  Because when I look at this, I see this obviously is talking about the dog stock.
2153.40s:  And I think if I'm not mistaken that 13G, let me find that one second.
2158.12s:  Keith Gil 13G filing.
2162.80s:  Chewie.
2164.12s:  Yep.
2165.12s:  Here.
2166.36s:  Yep.
2167.36s:  Here.
2170.60s:  So there's one important note to keep in mind here is as we look at when these tweets come out,
2179.08s:  there's some sort of correlation in terms of time.
2183.88s:  Right?
2184.12s:  So this came out 10 a.m. flat.
2186.20s:  This also came out on June 27th.
2188.60s:  Now from the SEC filing, this tells me that he crossed the 5% ownership threshold
2195.48s:  on June 24th, crossed the threshold.
2198.60s:  The reason why I emphasize that part crossed is because you don't have to file this until
2206.24s:  you cross that 5% threshold.
2208.68s:  So he technically could have been building a position leading into this.
2214.92s:  And the way that we would deduce from that is like, okay, June 13, he had this sometime
2222.04s:  between 13 June and 24 June, this happened.
2230.52s:  It's not a giant window.
2232.12s:  You can kind of see when that happens.
2233.80s:  You can even see it when we look at Chewie and we analyze the stock.
2241.24s:  And again, I don't know with certainty, but what I do know that if I go to 24 June,
2247.08s:  I see a massive, recent, outsized bybar, 78% by volume with total volume coming in at 23.7
2259.96s:  mill, where the 20 day average was 14 mill and the 5 day average was 16.6.
2265.80s:  It's a pretty big deviation.
2267.56s:  Would not surprise me in the least if he bought all of that here.
2272.36s:  Wouldn't surprise me in the least.
2273.72s:  Not guaranteed, but it wouldn't surprise me.
2276.76s:  Now, my thought is when he posts this, this is obviously after he already bought the dog stock.
2285.64s:  He was in Chewie in some capacity, what he did with his GME shares.
2291.00s:  Nobody knows.
2292.60s:  Based on basic math, I know unless he took in money from another account, which again,
2299.00s:  pure conjecture, no idea.
2300.36s:  Almost going to have to get the tinfoil hat soon because we're getting close.
2303.48s:  But I still think this is a very reasonable thought pattern to follow is he would have had to sell
2310.68s:  some of this position because he had 268 million total with just 6.3 million in cash.
2318.12s:  When I look at this trade, that again is likely to have occurred in my opinion on 24 June looking
2324.60s:  at the chart.
2325.72s:  If we give him even a favorable entry on 24 June, something around like mid price lower mid,
2332.36s:  which again is probably not the case.
2334.76s:  26 was the price.
2336.84s:  So we have 9 million 1000 shares,
2340.76s:  9 million 1000 shares times 26.
2344.28s:  He needs 234 million dollars.
2347.96s:  234 million dollars got to come from somewhere.
2351.08s:  In this account, I see 268.
2353.24s:  He has enough.
2354.12s:  He does not have enough in cash.
2356.20s:  So the theory in my opinion, and I think it's time for the tinfoil hat.
2362.68s:  We'll see how long I can keep this on for because it's pretty damn hot in California right now.
2374.28s:  I do have the air going, but not only do I think that it's a sick costume, but I also just
2381.16s:  think it's important for people to know when I'm like straight up speculating, which this is now
2387.24s:  getting into speculation.
2388.92s:  So in my opinion, the probability that he has another 200 million dollars just sitting in
2400.28s:  another account that he wouldn't have started with in this when he came back, I find that to be
2406.60s:  unlikely. I just find it to be highly unlikely.
2410.20s:  So could it have happened?
2412.04s:  Absolutely.
2413.64s:  I just would think it would be an unlikely scenario personally.
2418.04s:  So then that leads me to believe that the higher probability scenario is unwinding all,
2425.56s:  if not the majority of this position to free up the cash, to then move into dog stock.
2432.52s:  The main thing I see here, I think there's everybody's eyeing in on like which way the eyeballs
2438.68s:  are facing. And to me, I don't know, I think it's a shout out to the Kansas City Shuffle thing,
2447.32s:  but my main takeaway is I just see green here, which is very typical for buying.
2454.76s:  And then I see red here, which is very typical for selling.
2459.48s:  So whether or not there's something weird on his holster, like with that little logo,
2464.12s:  I have no idea. I don't even know what that is.
2466.36s:  I think other people probably will know what this is, but that's the main thing I see is eyeballs,
2473.40s:  green eyeballs, red by cell. So this leads me to believe it's likely that he unwound all,
2483.96s:  if not some of his chewy position. That's my guess. He's putting the dog down in this case,
2489.64s:  putting the toy down, putting the dog down, red cell, green by. Now,
2495.40s:  the interesting part here is this was a like not right after, which I find fascinating,
2504.04s:  right? Because we can see based on the filing, it was 24 June that he crossed the threshold.
2508.68s:  He waited two days to post this. Whereas in this, he posted it again, if this is him,
2516.36s:  which we don't know, if this is him, which we don't know, he would have posted it like 15 minutes
2522.84s:  after he got in. So now the other thing that again, this is like straight tin foil. I need to
2531.72s:  bring this on my head a little bit more. So by seating this on the head more, the one thing I
2538.04s:  remember from this movie is that when he put this, this toy away, he was moving on to Buzz Lightyear,
2545.32s:  like the new or fun toy, but he went back to Woody. I personally don't think that's what he
2552.60s:  means by this, but that would be a thing, right? Putting the dog toy away with some sort of expectation
2558.60s:  to go back to it because Andy, I think that's this little bastard's name goes back to Woody later
2564.28s:  in the movie. So I have no idea. But anyways, all right, let me get to the chat. I see you guys
2570.04s:  are going off here. Let me see. Snehael says this name should be taken only at face value. I
2576.52s:  agree. I completely agree. I think that in my opinion, this is just saying bought sold. That's
2583.48s:  what I see. So yeah, completely agree. All right. What were we at?
2593.32s:  CDJ says his name about you were billionaire. He had money and more. No, I think you saw him in his
2600.76s:  primary account. His primary account literally almost had that. Yeah, I forgot where there was a
2607.72s:  point that he shared on the stream. Like he was right at billionaire. So yeah, I think I think he
2615.80s:  was just referring to his account. But now when it comes to him having other accounts, I'm sure he
2620.76s:  has other accounts. How much money he has in those? I have no idea. But I don't think like
2626.60s:  to me, I don't think there's a good explanation as to why he would come back here
2632.76s:  with only, again, we're talking insane world now, but only 210 million. If he has another 200
2641.72s:  million that he's wanting to trade with, he would, I would just, I would bet dollars to donuts.
2648.36s:  He would come back with all of it. I see no reason why he would only come back with this if
2653.24s:  he was expecting to trade with more. I just don't see it. So could it be absolutely, but I just don't,
2660.60s:  I just don't see it personally. It's not a bad thesis though. It could be.
2670.04s:  Ricky says for us non-apes, how do you think the best way to trade the downside of GME is after
2675.56s:  big run-up thinking about buying puts if it goes up a crazy, yeah. So with something like that,
2680.44s:  you're kind of damned if you do, damned if you don't. If you buy puts, it will work. That's the
2685.08s:  way that I would do it. But they're going to be way expensive and you have to be really thoughtful
2691.40s:  about the way that you buy the puts. So for those kinds of things, I would go a little further
2696.28s:  out in time. That's the way I do it typically, like at least greater than 60 days on the long options.
2701.64s:  And then I go like at if not in the money for something like GameStop at the money is typically
2706.52s:  planning because it'll cascade. So yeah, that's like the high level overview.
2712.60s:  Roryntitty says we don't know if Chuyi was in its own account.
2718.28s:  All we know is the filing happened. He didn't show his port with Chuyi.
2722.28s:  I again, I would think he uses account because it's, the reason why I think he uses account is
2728.68s:  because he says this.
2737.24s:  Like we've we've listened to this before together quite a few times. But in this section,
2742.60s:  and I'm just highlighting it to you because we don't have to listen to it now. Let me share
2747.16s:  like the specific start point here. Here you go. So from this start point, he says this is his
2754.52s:  only account. Like that he explicitly says that. I believe him. I like I don't think he would lie
2761.08s:  about that. So I believe him that this is his only account. So could he have another portfolio
2770.36s:  that he's trading in? He could. But I believe this. Zacharias says his wife's IRA. Yeah,
2780.20s:  the problem is is that there's no way to get that amount of money in the IRA.
2787.48s:  Yeah, I don't see that.
2791.16s:  Hot nitrogen says he said it's his only positionless we count cash as a position two.
2796.12s:  Yeah, the reason why he said count cash as a position two is he he hovered over the cash in
2801.24s:  as account as he said that. He says it depends on your position. But he was like explicitly calling
2805.96s:  out this cash because some people would say, well, cash is a position and he's trying to
2810.52s:  the point in my opinion that he's trying to make is that this is the only thing he's holding.
2814.76s:  So that's why he makes the point to call that out.
2823.08s:  Zacharias says I mean he started at 53. He did. But the other thing that again, as I was going
2827.96s:  through some of his background in terms of like his start, which we have to I don't know if there's
2832.52s:  a way to like save this down part instead of having to do this each time. I haven't figured that
2837.32s:  out. Any smart people know how to do this instead of having to like drag this bar down each time,
2843.32s:  which is super annoying. I haven't figured that out. But anyways, he started with this, but I
2854.04s:  the way that he grew his money is literally through YOLO's and it looks like he started down here.
2859.56s:  Again, I don't know what he had from the get go just from like the first position that he posted
2863.64s:  here with like 113,000 is what I see.
2870.52s:  Roaring Titty says up and down arrows. Roaring Titty,
2874.76s:  well, I already told you you could do no wrong. So normally I would have
2879.08s:  jousted back there, but yeah, like the page down doesn't work. It just takes me to the bottom of it.
2885.24s:  But Brad says for the sake of the discussion at this point, how about we assume this was his
2890.84s:  only account being come back to it? Yeah, well, and I mean, really there's nothing else to cover
2894.68s:  there, right? It's just everybody will have their opinion rightfully so on like what they think
2898.76s:  may or may not have been there. And we we won't know what it is. Like we just unless he chooses to
2907.32s:  share or tell us which again, in my opinion, he did that when he talked about it on that live stream,
2913.72s:  but I mean, who knows that's that is the that is the straight up part. Nobody will know.
2919.40s:  All right. Oh, gotta take this off for a few minutes. In case you guys are wondering,
2925.88s:  aluminum foil is not like a really breathable material and your boy runs hot real hot. So
2935.08s:  okay.
2938.76s:  That Lawrence is sorry, did you say how much he would have made on chewy calls?
2942.84s:  I didn't because I've seen nothing. I've seen nothing that indicates that he bought chewy calls.
2948.76s:  Like I haven't seen that anywhere. The only thing that I see is this which can be options,
2957.40s:  but I looked through and we did this actually when I did one of the live streams with Newton,
2961.72s:  we looked through we combed through all of the chewy options trades leading into this. And I just
2968.36s:  I don't see it. So I don't I don't I haven't seen anything. I know a lot of people were
2977.48s:  immediately assuming that he had options positions so that he was trading options, which is fair. He
2981.32s:  does that a lot, but I didn't see anything in here that led me to believe that there's an options
2988.04s:  position. Sneheel says I'm pretty sure there was some 5K blocks around the 24th. Let's take a quick
2994.12s:  look. I mean, we'll get to the bottom of it right now. So, he's the WI. And then you're telling me
3000.76s:  around June 24th. I mean, we can look at the whole period between his updates, right? What is it?
3009.08s:  June? Is that right? Let me find this thing. I don't want to scroll up. Hold on, let me grab another
3014.92s:  version of this. And by. Okay. Yeah, this will be like our up top version. So June 13th was the
3029.96s:  last. So then we can start after June 13th. We've done this exact exercise before. So go June 13th
3037.08s:  until the 24th, which was the date that it happened. We'll look at just the calls. And then we'll
3043.64s:  look at just call buys. And I see the 30s come through in two blocks for 19 July. So it's not that
3058.12s:  because he just posted the picture of dog stock. And this doesn't equate to that size of a position.
3065.24s:  Let's do the math. So he has 10,000 at 30 is the basis. $300,000. So this represents 10,000,
3081.24s:  obviously, times 100. Yeah. It's only a million shares. This shows me nine.
3095.32s:  Nine million. It's like, it's not even close. So we did this exercise again with new not too long
3104.68s:  ago. We're like, I looked at each day because there was another theory that Newton had that maybe he
3110.92s:  just traded enough options in order to essentially double his account in that time frame. And again,
3115.96s:  like, you could tell by the way I'm framing that, I just think that that's like insanely improbable.
3121.40s:  But who knows? So we looked at it. And I took it seriously when we were looking at it. And yeah,
3127.24s:  I don't see that happening either. So again, just using like simplest explanations here. I think
3134.12s:  that that's kind of one of the important things to do with these is use the simpler explanations.
3139.88s:  And the simpler explanations is when this happened, he probably unwound his game stop position.
3145.48s:  All if not some if some some if not all. And then here it looks like he's unwinding the chewy
3152.92s:  position. Again, my guess is it probably didn't happen on the sixth because there was a delay between
3159.32s:  these. Roryntady says if you own six point six of chewy nine million shares, one me shares isn't
3166.04s:  a small amount. No, no, no, it's not small at all. It's just not the nine million shares.
3169.32s:  She's not even close.
3172.76s:  Salty says, did you research further dates back just in case you built a position before in it? No,
3177.16s:  I didn't because again, we don't have to because he told me this is his only account. So the last
3183.48s:  date that he provided an update is 13 June in this account. So yeah, I think the the theory of him
3192.04s:  trading this in his wife's account coming up with nine million. It's two hundred million dollars.
3198.20s:  I genuinely so there's a way that you can do. It's called a mega back door Roth IRA conversion
3206.28s:  or an IRA conversion. But you run you run out of the ability to pile money into the product or
3212.76s:  into the account. If it's a standard IRA, I guess he could funnel more into it. But I just yeah,
3218.84s:  I would struggle to see that as the case here.
3220.92s:  Rointit he says at the beginning of the stream, he said accounts plural about 12 minutes and yeah,
3231.16s:  Rointit he if you can grab me the exact time spot in there, I'm happy to play it again,
3235.40s:  I'm just going off with what he told me like in this, he says this is his only account with his
3239.80s:  only positions. So in the beginning, my guess is if he said the word accounts, he probably was
3244.92s:  using it just in a conversational phrase. Whereas this, he's explicitly talking about the accounts
3250.36s:  that he's trading again, in my opinion. So yeah, he could have other accounts. There's no doubt.
3255.48s:  But if there's another account, it would require essentially another two hundred million dollars,
3261.64s:  which again, as good as Roaring Kitty, that is, that's double the amount of money that's in this
3266.44s:  account two times that amount of money. This amount of money took him obviously some time to build.
3272.84s:  He could obviously compound pretty quickly here, but it's just a ton, a ton of money.
3279.16s:  So yeah, I always will acknowledge that we don't know and it could be. But again, I think the way
3287.80s:  that I try to analyze it is follow the highest probability paths as I can. That's the way I think
3294.92s:  about analyzing it. So yeah, this is what I'm thinking about it. Brad says what his GME ownership
3304.12s:  show up in a Bloomberg terminal because other individual positions do and he hasn't been on it.
3308.52s:  No, it depends on a Bloomberg terminal. It limits the kind of entities that show up.
3314.84s:  Everybody doesn't get to see your position on Bloomberg. Otherwise, nobody would use a Bloomberg
3318.76s:  terminal. That's like given away your hands. So whatever you're seeing in terms of other people's
3324.68s:  positions, you're seeing reported positions in terms of required filings. But it's not like showing
3331.32s:  a real time tap into his portfolio. Literally nobody would use a Bloomberg terminal, which is crazy.
3336.20s:  Yeah. So anyways, back to this because I do think it's important to talk about. And I talked a
3346.84s:  little bit about this in the video from yesterday. I get confused with the videos because I do a lot of
3356.92s:  videos. Oh, let's say the seventh. So we'll just do this week again. So here, I'm going to grab both
3369.32s:  sides. I this confounds me. This absolutely confounds me. I do not know what happened here.
3381.96s:  Now, I'm going to walk you through the basic analysis based on again, following the simplest
3393.32s:  explanation first. Somebody don't know who bought these at 0842. Somebody looks to have sold
3406.84s:  about a half hour later, the same position. So this looks like somebody bought here, held for 20,
3419.16s:  30 minutes, and then sold here. CDJ says those trades were done on the floor. What does that mean?
3424.84s:  Like walk me through what you think that means. I've seen that circulate a little bit. And I'm
3431.56s:  trying to understand what people think that means because the floor is probably being misused.
3438.12s:  I would guess because it actually doesn't make sense. So yeah, talk me through what you think.
3443.24s:  Because what I've kind of heard people saying is that they're thinking that this is like the market
3449.16s:  makers, which for those that don't know they wouldn't be on the floor. In this case, for this kind of
3454.92s:  position likely, this would be a quantitative position. But a bunch of well, first let me ask.
3462.44s:  And before I start going down that example, there's a flag reference to the designation
3472.36s:  while hanging on the floor with your laptop.
3479.32s:  On the stock exchange floor is what I read. Yeah, but what does that mean? I need to know what that
3483.72s:  mean again, and it's really dangerous, right? So CDJ, do you notice what you said in the beginning?
3488.04s:  You said it like definitively. Those trades were done on the floor. And then here you're just saying
3493.16s:  that you read it somewhere. And again, I'm not picking on you. But I'm just saying like when we're
3496.84s:  trying to follow a logical process, it's so important to try. And like if there's data that says
3504.76s:  that somewhere up, I'm obviously open to it. But like, yeah, Jonathan says, look farther right. Okay.
3513.56s:  So this makes a ton of sense then. So this trade here, which is this purchase was done on the floor.
3536.76s:  So do we know what that means? That's what this one that's flagged that, the 6399.
3543.64s:  Brad says that's the theory. How do you get a laptop from that? The theory you're referencing
3548.12s:  DFC walked in the Boston Exchange itself. That's funny. Ben Price says, I'm going to guess somebody
3554.92s:  read him and traded the event. I mean, I opened a long Jimmy position when I saw Chui's sale volume.
3561.48s:  Speculation was that it was placed from the floor of a stock exchange from the pits. Not sure if
3565.56s:  that would make it logical for it to be the cat or more likely than not. The flag was on you. Yeah, okay.
3574.44s:  I yeah, I think that that's unlikely for a lot of reasons. The primary reason why I think
3581.72s:  that's unlikely is because my guess is this trade went to the floor because of the size.
3588.04s:  I think that's where they processed it. I don't think I have to double check. I don't want to
3592.36s:  speak out of term. Let's actually see what that means. I'll look it up just so that we can learn
3598.36s:  together. Okay, so on the unusual Wales platform, when a transaction is labeled as floor,
3612.60s:  what does that mean?
3617.32s:  Refer to trades that are executed on the trading floor of an exchange as opposed to being done
3622.36s:  through an automated system electronically. These trades are often negotiated manually by
3627.96s:  traders on the floor, involving large institutional order blocks of trades.
3632.76s:  So this the fact and that's exactly what I expected it to be, but I just didn't want to go off
3639.00s:  have cocked. So in this case, my guess is this was a big trade that was being routed and that's how
3649.64s:  they chose to execute the block trade. So all I'm saying is could this be another entity?
3654.76s:  Absolutely. This could be anybody. We don't know who it is. Could this be roaring kitty?
3658.52s:  Absolutely. The fact that it was executed on the floor doesn't mean that it's not a retail
3665.88s:  trader. This one was 200, 200 lots that came through on the floor. Like you'll find floor on a lot
3673.96s:  of these. So bigger orders typically so that you don't because the process of trying to fill this
3680.92s:  kind of order at once would push the price pretty meaningfully. So my guess is they probably were
3687.24s:  going to fulfill a large order through a broker. They call the broker and say, Hey, I have a big,
3691.48s:  again, a retail trader can do this. I have a big order that's going to come through. I want to buy
3695.80s:  X Y or Z. And then at that point, the the broker can say, Okay, let me connect you with the floor
3702.20s:  or the broker can say, I'll talk to the floor and see what they can do. What size they can accommodate.
3706.36s:  Because when we look at resting orders, we can see the depth. So if I get rid of these examples
3716.76s:  and we take a look. So if we take a look, you see this column that's called size. This tells me
3723.48s:  what is offered at this point. So here, if I would love for it to pop up,
3732.44s:  me and I don't want to unscrew it. There goes. So here on this one, you'll see that it's essentially
3742.60s:  bid for 509 at this price to a one. And then it's offered to 29 for 230 lots. So when you have a
3754.60s:  really big order that you have to fill like 6,000 contracts and you don't want to get chewed up on
3761.56s:  like on moving the market yourself. Because a big difference between this and the previous stuff
3766.76s:  we've seen. Again, if this is roaring kitty, this is under that big assumption bubble of if, if
3772.44s:  it's roaring kitty, when we've seen this behavior before, it's establishing a position similar to
3777.80s:  this size over a period of time. Right. This was done in a couple minutes, it's single day, literally
3784.28s:  within seconds of one another. So in order to fulfill that kind of position, that's my guess. My
3790.20s:  guess is they chose to split up the order. And I think that's why it's flagged that way. So
3796.68s:  here's what we can conclude objectively from this. We don't know who it was. We know that one of
3804.84s:  them was executed on the floor. And it wouldn't surprise me at all if these were again discussed in
3811.32s:  tandem. And it wouldn't surprise me at all. If the broker says, okay, you can launch this order for
3816.60s:  $36.60 from whatever. And then you you'll send the rest $63.99, whatever the size desired size is
3823.96s:  through the floor. And they'll take the trade. That's one other thing we can conclude from this.
3833.00s:  The other thing we can conclude is we don't know that this is the same as this. We don't know.
3841.88s:  It seems overwhelmingly likely to be the case, but we don't know. Now the slightly ugly part here is if
3856.60s:  hat back on if this was the cat and if he bought in here, then if he posted this at 09,
3868.04s:  we know that we're in kitty. Absolutely would know posting this is going to move game stop.
3874.92s:  There's no way he doesn't know that. He knows that. So it looks like places trade post that on x
3885.72s:  sell the trade into the volume. That's what it looks like. I don't think that's what happened.
3890.52s:  Not for a second. Not for a lot of reasons. First reason. This is a lot of money.
3897.96s:  This is peanuts compared to what I've seen him hold during this live stream.
3905.40s:  Down $225 million. Doesn't give a fuck. This is peanuts for this dude.
3916.12s:  Peanuts. I cannot see him in any way, shape or form. One, thinking this is a good idea in terms of
3924.84s:  regulation. He would overwhelmingly have to expect that he would get caught for this. Two,
3933.00s:  what a trivial amount of money for this dude. We're talking tens of thousands of dollars here.
3939.88s:  Maybe a few hundred thousand dollars here. I just do. I just don't see it. I just don't see it.
3948.36s:  So could it be? It could. But my guess is if that happened, it would have happened for a reason
3956.60s:  completely different than to try to make a few hundred thousand dollars here. That's my opinion.
3962.04s:  If he did it. If this is him, if the sale is him, which those are all ifs. We have no idea.
3969.16s:  If any of that is the case, my best guess is that it would have been done for some other reason,
3977.16s:  which I really don't know what it is. But what I can tell you is that from a monetary motivation,
3985.80s:  I do not think he could have cared less about this kind of movement. I just don't think he could
3993.00s:  possibly care less. So that's why if this was him, I assume it's for another reason. And that's why
4002.68s:  I highly, highly, highly question what this all is. Because it's really hard to tell. Because if you
4009.64s:  think about this, all of this is from the origin of just this, which this doesn't even mean that he
4018.04s:  moved into GameStop. And again, the other thing I want to remind people is that when he posted this
4023.88s:  on 27 June, he made the trade into Chewie several days before. So this would be a departure from that
4034.44s:  where he apparently would have exited dog stock whenever maybe this was lagging a certain amount of
4041.56s:  time and then transition into GameStop right after he posts this. I think that would be weird.
4048.44s:  I think that would be real, real weird. So when I look at this, I am
4057.64s:  the one thing I feel fairly confident in is that he bought Chewie. And this was him telling us.
4063.64s:  And I think this is him saying he sold Chewie. That's what I think here. Now with respect to this,
4070.76s:  I literally have no idea. I have no idea. And I also have to take a pause because
4076.60s:  Mel hit me up. Ooh, dinner order time. We can take the tin foil off for this.
4086.12s:  So last night we did Indian. I'm thinking Mexican.
4093.40s:  She's voting for barbecue.
4098.68s:  So we'll see if I can, we'll see if we can get Mexican. That learns as barbecue. That's a good idea.
4106.20s:  Sneals as Chinese. I like Chinese once in a while. The problem I have with Chinese is that it's just
4110.84s:  so damn salty, so damn salty. High food is good. It's just a lot of noodles and stuff though.
4119.64s:  Vladimir off-put and I don't know if there's like decent Japanese here.
4123.48s:  Generational capital says Korean barbecue. We're gonna order it so I don't really like Korean barbecue
4127.56s:  ordered here.
4129.88s:  So the other thing that I do want to highlight though is I've seen a couple other theories.
4137.96s:  One of the theories I saw people say is like, is this him again assuming that this was him just
4143.08s:  in this hypothetical? Is this him like selling or exercising the calls? That's not this.
4149.00s:  And it's one, it wouldn't be reported as this. Two, this would be, it would be literally
4156.28s:  lighting money on fire, which I've seen him hold through some movement and not care. So
4163.40s:  he has that part to him, but I don't exactly think that would make any sense. Again, that's not what
4170.76s:  this is. I can tell you that. But the idea of buying these calls on an exercising them is literally
4178.28s:  just lighting money on fire. So I do not believe that that's what this is.
4185.88s:  Lance says, Chili Mac, Chili Mac's always good. I did like Chili Mac. It's not bad.
4192.76s:  Jay card says, do you if you will not be the buyer and a quick seller to open the door and pump
4197.56s:  and dump exactly? That's and that's my that's my gut feeling too. I really agree with that. Again,
4203.24s:  and I don't know. I'm guessing. It's just it's pure speculation. I'm guessing. But I just don't see
4213.16s:  unless he's testing something. I don't see anything in this for him. Like I don't see why that would
4218.60s:  make sense. Oh, sick. We're doing Mexican. Oh, yes. It's been, it's been a minute. It's been a
4228.20s:  minute since I've had Mexican. I ordered the same thing. I'm like I said, when it comes to like
4235.24s:  food, I'm so boring because I just don't care that much. Like obviously I can taste good food,
4241.80s:  but I just really want the nutrients. That's about all I care. All right. So that's this. Now,
4254.68s:  the other thing I wanted to do is to go back through some of his old traits and let's take a look.
4261.88s:  G 30 series says maybe he's just saying Chewie is dropping. I don't see that. That wouldn't really
4266.60s:  make sense, right? Because Chewie moved a bit before that and people can see the chart. So
4273.96s:  H says, could he have pieced into the calls and smaller sizes over previous weeks to fly
4278.20s:  under the radar? Don't think he would have sold on the pump to be honest, but curious to see
4282.28s:  I could be, but I don't think so. And it's because I look at the GME options every day. And for him to
4289.08s:  build anything even resembling what would make sense for him would literally take an eternity
4296.60s:  buying in like smaller 500 lot entries. And even even 500 lot entries, I would see those
4308.28s:  still essentially pop up for me. It's the stuff that's like, you know, if you're trading sub 10
4315.64s:  lots, I would miss, but I literally go down to 10 lots. Also, cheers, more drugs. Now we have a set of
4320.84s:  medicine. And I think we're good with drugs now.
4334.76s:  Days says, now this is my theory. I think he hasn't bought back GME as he want to hype,
4341.64s:  he want to hype to die out. The meaning posted had no correlation with GME, even one of his tweets.
4347.88s:  He said when I moved, yeah, I and for I think I read that as days, but I don't know how to say that
4354.52s:  name, DASID days, but I agree with you. Like that absolutely could be that absolutely could be the case.
4361.72s:  I wouldn't doubt it at all. You have to give me one second. I have to go let the dog in.
4369.72s:  Be back in like 32 second, no less than 32 seconds. You guys can time me. We'll be back in 27
4377.32s:  seconds. I bet 27 seconds. Time 27 seconds time starts now.
4399.64s:  How do we do? I felt like that felt like those pretty good.
4421.16s:  34. Damn. That was much slower than I thought. Yeah, that was seriously 34 seconds.
4434.92s:  I move and slow. I move and slow my old age. Listen, I have a fucking pernated disc. Give me a
4442.60s:  break here. Apparently I need a break because I really thought that that would have been like a
4447.08s:  27 second movement. That's unbelievable. Shame on me. All right, I'll do better next time.
4454.52s:  Hopefully not next time, but generation of capitals says it was the hat. The hat does add a lot of
4460.20s:  drag and these move a little bit. So you have to be kind of careful. Maybe you have to tighten these
4466.36s:  down, batten down the hatches. Don't like that. You guys can't see the amount of detail that went
4474.36s:  into this because there's even little pebbles like rocks that go around the top like this,
4481.56s:  which I think is pretty sick. I like my hat. It literally breathes terribly though.
4491.48s:  Masha says, don't do better next time you might tweak your back dog. I mean, I look at it as the
4495.96s:  back's already fucking tweaked. I just got I would show you guys the MRI. I've never seen one before.
4501.08s:  But the MRI thing was actually really, really cool. They gave me a disc and I like I could see my
4504.76s:  fucking organs and shit. I can see my whole spine. I mean, I don't know what I'm looking at. So I
4509.24s:  can't tell what's good. What's not. But it was super cool. Like I literally have it here.
4515.32s:  It's really cool to look at.
4519.56s:  Ricky says Eric Ronnie Coleman can barely walk. You don't see him using his back as an excuse shaking
4524.04s:  my DM head. No. And I tell you what, Ronnie Coleman is like 10 million times the dude that I will
4531.00s:  ever be. I aspire to be like somebody like him. I've I've never seen somebody maintain such an
4538.12s:  amazingly positive disposition through like a pretty rough go. So yeah, that dude is that he
4547.72s:  literally is an inspiration to me. That guy's incredible. I think I actually do like think about him
4552.20s:  in a couple other people like that a lot every time I'm feeling sorry for myself. Like I was at
4555.56s:  the gym earlier today trying to do. I mean, I still work out every single day. Like there is no
4560.76s:  missing. I just have to modify. But the like I'm sitting there doing this bullshit stuff for my
4567.08s:  legs. Like I have to go so light. I can't I'm not using a barbell at all. And I'm doing like these
4572.20s:  little step down things. And I'm just sitting there, you know, again, feeling sorry for myself. Like
4576.28s:  fuck like I wish I could squat. I wish I could do this. And then I literally think about people
4580.36s:  like that. And I just think like what do I have to complain about? Yes, I have a leg. Yes,
4585.48s:  it doesn't work super great now. And it's in pain. But I have a leg. So yeah, people like Ronnie
4591.16s:  Coleman are straight up like literally inspirational. The dude isn't he's literally incredible. I
4596.52s:  I have nothing but respect for that guy. Incredible, dude.
4602.44s:  Ryan, whoa, I'll literally buy that book right this second. I've never heard of that book.
4608.20s:  Ryan just recommended a book. I'm always always looking for good books. The gift of injury.
4613.56s:  Gift of injury. Who is this?
4623.48s:  Brian Carroll? Yeah.
4628.36s:  $30. And expensive book.
4632.44s:  I still grab it. Damn, it's a big ass book too. What am I getting into?
4646.04s:  I just ordered it. I will. Who gave me that recommendation? Who was that?
4652.68s:  Rye, Rye Cack. Thank you for the recommendation. I will read it and then I will report back.
4661.40s:  I'm always always looking for new books. I have to be honest though, I essentially only read
4670.44s:  the vast majority of stuff that I read is trading books. So
4676.20s:  there's that. But yeah, okay, back to GameStop. Enough about me. Nobody cares.
4686.12s:  Ricky says Eric, are you like a millionaire? Just buy it. The I think that think, well,
4691.48s:  okay, couple things. The first thing is just because I have money now, doesn't mean that all of my
4697.16s:  habits from not having it are gone. The second thing is you don't lose your value propositions in life.
4703.96s:  There's a way that you become wealthy and it's by having value propositions.
4708.52s:  So and I did buy the book. It apparently was slightly enough value to to win me over.
4715.64s:  But yeah, I'm still a discerning consumer. The stuff that I don't care about or don't really track
4721.24s:  or things that I need. Right? So like the door dash, I'm about to order. I like, I have no idea
4727.96s:  what it costs and I don't care. I'll obviously leave a decent tip and send it up the door. That's
4734.60s:  it. Like don't even look at a gas. Don't know what it costs. Even here in California, really don't
4738.76s:  know what it costs. Grocery shopping. I don't do it. So it's stuff like that. I don't really care.
4744.04s:  But the yeah, stuff like that when I'm when I'm buying things like that, I still am of course
4749.56s:  I'm a discerning consumer. If you're not, you're not going to have money for very long. It will,
4753.24s:  it will go away.
4758.52s:  Days said lend me a fiber. I don't think so. That's not the way to get money. It's like,
4767.56s:  I don't think that would help anybody.
4770.44s:  Masha says he has that car in the wall behind him. Yeah, that's one of the cars right there.
4775.48s:  Right there. So my mother-in-law painted that actually here. Take a look. It's, she's like super,
4782.76s:  super talented. Take a look at that thing. She literally, she literally painted that,
4789.48s:  which is incredible. But yeah, I love cars. I have that. I have the, I have a McLaren that is like
4797.08s:  my first mid-engine car I've never had one of those before. That's been really fun to tinker with.
4802.44s:  And then like for a truck, I have a Ford, I'm a gear head. So like I like cars. I like automotive
4807.56s:  is a lot. So Masha says I wish I wish I was half as talented. It's nuts. The, the things that
4815.32s:  artists can do just straight up blow my mind. Absolutely blow my mind. Champion of roses says,
4822.60s:  I have a, oh, sick. What kind of Corvette do you have? It's, so the story behind the Corvette's
4827.64s:  kind of funny. I've told it before, but I'll say it again, because I think it's interesting,
4832.92s:  at least for me, the, I did grow up poor, but the first time that I was ever around like a cool
4840.44s:  car, I was working my uncle, let me work with him on some of his cars that he was restoring.
4846.68s:  And one of the cars I got to work on was a 64 white Corvette Stingway Stingray. And as soon as I saw,
4854.92s:  I was sitting there thinking like how cool it was. And I literally told myself, I was like, I'm
4858.52s:  going to get one of those one day. Like that was the, the new target. And I ended up getting it like
4863.72s:  four years ago, five years ago, something like that.
4873.00s:  Colonel says, I'll swap you for my Bentley. No, I don't like Bentley's. To me, they're, yeah,
4881.00s:  to me, the Bentley's are silly cars. Some of them look kind of cool, but they're not for me.
4886.20s:  James says, I have a 1989, oh, that's sick. What is that? Like a C4?
4891.32s:  19 or C3?
4896.28s:  C4, I think.
4906.84s:  Yeah. These are what the flip up headlights. These are super cool. Yeah, that's a C4. That's awesome.
4913.64s:  I love that. What a fun grab. Sweet. All right. So now let's take a look at some of
4922.36s:  roaring kiddie's old trades. So what I wanted to do is go through some of these. And I actually
4928.20s:  wanted to look at the market, like what it looked like at the time that he had these positions on.
4935.16s:  And I want to get a sense of kind of like what he was seeing. I literally want to rebuild
4939.24s:  these positions. So first things first, let's go into on demand. And hopefully it works.
4945.88s:  Gotta pause. Okay. So it looks like a good start. It's buffering. So this might take
4950.92s:  them in. And we can kind of bullshit in the middle. Braimus says, hello, I actually say hello
4956.52s:  back to Braimus. And we've been hovering around like 200 people, which is incredible.
4961.88s:  Absolutely love that for those that are in the chat. I would love to know where you're chatting
4967.48s:  from. Last time we did this was super, super fun. What I want to do is find a way if there's like an
4972.20s:  app or something that can like as people say where they're at, I can poke like tap it in. And then
4979.08s:  I could drop pins. I want to, is there something like that? Hold on. Is there a website that I can
4988.68s:  type in locations that drops in on all of them? Google My Maps?
5005.16s:  I've never heard of Google My Maps. Just try that. Google My Maps.
5010.44s:  I've never seen this. Create new map. Create.
5028.84s:  GME live stream. Dave. I guess I just dropped stuff in. Is that right?
5037.24s:  All right. So first one I see is Las Vegas.
5044.28s:  And a marker. Next one I see is Ohio.
5054.20s:  Does he, it doesn't keep the other one though.
5059.00s:  Oh, you have to add it as another layer. That right?
5067.96s:  Oh, oh, oh, as you can tell, I have no idea what I'm doing.
5076.28s:  So there's one in Ohio. Let me get rid of this.
5081.96s:  Delete. And then so the first one was Las Vegas.
5086.60s:  There we go. Is that right? Yeah. Yo, technology is sick. All right. Now I'm excited.
5101.80s:  Massachusetts. Add to map. We have Portugal. Add to map.
5110.76s:  To add Portugal. Got it. Portland.
5121.32s:  Oregon. Portland's dope. This is sick area. Hollywood.
5129.80s:  Johnny, you're right by me. I'm in San Diego. What am I doing? I'm like talking and typing,
5135.64s:  which didn't work. Hollywood, California. Add. I guess I'll do mine. Believe in hate.
5151.96s:  Add. This is cool. So I can save this and then I can add to it over time. This will be super,
5159.80s:  super fun.
5166.52s:  Bonner's fairy.
5170.20s:  Idaho. Yeah, that's cool. I never heard of that place. Idaho is pretty high on my visit list.
5178.76s:  I really want to go to Idaho. New Jersey. Where in New Jersey? New Jersey.
5184.68s:  Add to map. We got Kansas City. Add to the map. Arkansas. Add that,
5200.76s:  Bish Ottawa. Add that. Yo, this is nuts literally everywhere. T.C. M. King is from Earth.
5211.64s:  And then we're reminded that Earth is flat, which is good. And we have Edmonton, Alberta.
5219.40s:  Where is that? What's the weather like there? Oh, it's North of Calgary. Interesting.
5225.88s:  I see Ventura. Okay, so we had a couple California peeps in here.
5233.72s:  Mission, Viejo. Yo, that's like super close to me.
5237.24s:  We literally drive through there. Like going up to the mountains and stuff.
5244.84s:  Mr. Off Putin, you're literally right by me. And there's two of you in Ventura. In case you
5249.40s:  guys didn't know, there's Alicia, who's in Ventura and Chris is also in Ventura.
5258.28s:  Brahmis says, do you think there are two more parties using swaps to keep the price of GME
5262.12s:  down? I don't know if they would be using swaps to keep the price down necessarily. But I
5266.44s:  definitely do think that they're using swaps likely for an assortment of reasons. It's hard for
5271.64s:  me to like fully tell the purpose of the swaps because we can't fully see what's in them
5278.68s:  or how they're structured. But yeah, I definitely think swaps are being used. And I do think that
5283.88s:  they affect the price of GME. I just don't know how. Aviator Geek from Denver. I think
5290.92s:  Aviator Geek, I think my wife and I might be going out to Denver some time in the next few weeks.
5297.48s:  See, Adel, we were out there not too long ago. Lost Luna's New Mexico.
5305.08s:  Dick. Alabama. Yo, this is crazy. There's literally, we have people from everywhere.
5313.72s:  Raptors is from Clifton. We already hit that one and we got Maryland. Nobody from New York. Interesting.
5323.48s:  Vladimir off-pune says, if you don't go to Northern Idaho, Idaho, don't mention being from California.
5328.12s:  I'm not from California. I'm from New York, which might be even worse. But that's where I'm at.
5334.28s:  What the fuck, Brahmis? What is this? Esther Hasey?
5339.88s:  This catch a one? What the fuck? Where is that?
5348.60s:  Oh, you're like way up there. I've never heard of that place. Edmonton. I think we have that
5357.72s:  already up. Hungary says, I'm curious why RK would drop dog without moving to GME, though,
5364.68s:  considering the timing, the emoji chain and his awareness of the community.
5368.36s:  One guest he's going to cash getting ready for after ER. Yeah, I think that that's a really fair
5373.96s:  guess, to be honest. And it's because I agree with you. I think that it would be strange for him
5380.12s:  to rotate out of Chewy into something and this something I would likely imagine would be GameStop.
5386.84s:  But I'm not exactly, I'm not exactly sure why he would make that movement. There's a lot of
5397.00s:  have their lease way more than I thought. I thought that was going to be way easier to find.
5401.96s:  Yo, there's two of you from Saskatchewan in case you guys are friends. If you guys aren't friends
5407.96s:  and you probably don't want to meet one another, I guess that's kind of a dumb statement because
5412.44s:  the sketch one is also massive. So not great. Niaq, yo.
5420.60s:  Derschlup says, I seem the only person not being from North America. Yeah, I didn't expect that
5425.32s:  either. It's kind of nuts. All right, cool. So it looks like we got most of the participants in
5433.48s:  here. Let's take a look at our map. Check us out. So here's what we need to do. In order to complete
5440.76s:  this map, I think we need to get some people from South America. If you know any friends, we need to
5446.68s:  get some people from Africa. I would love to get somebody from the Swedish or Icelandic areas.
5454.52s:  That would be sick. That'll be on my hit list. This is perfect. And it literally saves our map.
5460.52s:  This is super cool. You see, I have a save that is GME livestream. So we Gucci.
5466.92s:  Paul says I'm in Brazil. Hell yeah. Paul, I'm in Brazil. You
5473.88s:  brainless says last question for me or swaps used as quote unquote as a ladder attacks.
5484.92s:  That's tough. So they're not necessarily used for that exact purpose.
5493.64s:  For you, day, generic. Add that. Perfect. So we got our first South America representative,
5503.40s:  which is perfect. We need that. Check out our map. This is where we're all from. This is sick.
5511.80s:  Love this. Whoa. Nick is here. Nick. That's perfect. And Shandy Netherlands. Sick.
5523.32s:  That's what I needed. That's exactly what I needed. The Netherlands, that honestly doesn't pop
5530.92s:  up on my radar too much. Maybe that's another spot I need to go. Because we really, really,
5536.20s:  really, really like Norway and we really, really liked Iceland.
5541.16s:  On a Lulu, we got why? Yeah. So back to the ladder attack thing though,
5549.00s:  is could they be used as part of it potentially? But I don't, yeah, I don't really think that there's
5557.08s:  a massive likelihood that that's the primary driver or the primary input to what moves
5563.96s:  games stop. Holy shit. Yeah, there's no way I can pronounce that. Hold on. Let me see if I can
5572.04s:  throw that into like chat GPT. Who are? Hua Hin? Don't, no, don't, don't do that. Don't do that.
5580.84s:  Don't Americanize your name. I'm gonna find, I'm gonna see how to say that. Hold on. You
5587.08s:  gotta tell me what's the enunciation of that? Oh shit. Okay. Hmm. I'm over my head. Try to
5603.08s:  search it. Oh, cool. I got it right. Hua Hin, sweet. So we got Thailand.
5617.24s:  Thailand is a incredible spot. Amsterdam is sick. So there's two of you from Amsterdam,
5623.64s:  by the way, in case you didn't know me, to neighbor. We got Dallas. I was actually looking at moving
5630.28s:  to Dallas for a little while when we were exploring places. It got axed from the list for the weather.
5636.68s:  But yeah, sweet. Well, cool. I love where our map is at. We have really solid coverage.
5645.48s:  We just need some African folks, which I still have some friends from Tanzania. We just have
5655.48s:  to get them in into GameStop, I suppose. Roaring Titi says do you have Missouri? I don't think so.
5663.00s:  I have Kansas City. We have Missouri in here. We'll add Missouri. Wait, I missed Oklahoma. Let me
5685.64s:  get me Oklahoma people. Perfect. Perfect. Wait, this will be fun. Oh, if we can get somebody in
5698.68s:  fucking Antarctica, how sick would that be? All right. Now, on demand has loaded. So now let's go
5709.16s:  back in time. So the first position that I see from him way back in time, this is from 8 sep 2019.
5719.56s:  8 sep 2019. Let's see if we can go back that far. Damn it. We can't. That's annoying. So we can
5727.88s:  only go to 2021. Well, let's see. Is there do you do you guys know if there is another charting tool
5740.28s:  that lets you go back to like a historic point in time and just look at the chart?
5745.40s:  historic is there a website that lets you go back to a specific time on a chart?
5758.20s:  Vintage jeeps says Michigan. We got to add our Michigan people.
5767.80s:  I have a buddy that's in Minneapolis.
5774.44s:  Trading view, I don't know if I have. I don't know if I have a trading view account. I do have a
5782.60s:  Yahoo Finance account though. So this is telling me Yahoo Finance. Let's me do that.
5789.64s:  So we need a game stop and it says you can define a date range for the chart. Is that right?
5795.80s:  I don't use this.
5807.40s:  Not all I just want to. Here we go date range. Perfect. This is perfect.
5813.00s:  All right. So I said 8 sept 19. Is that right?
5819.32s:  8
5822.12s:  stop 19. That correct? That's August. I'm so used to doing military. So for me, this would be
5833.80s:  correct. But I forgot this is the correct way. Okay. And then we'll go from there to
5846.36s:  it doesn't let me go past it for some reason, which is interesting. Let's see what it looks like there.
5851.32s:  And then I don't want to do mountain. I would like to do candles. And then let's do like a one-year
5859.00s:  daily. Oh, this is cool. We don't need that. We don't need that. Sick. Vladimir off Putin says,
5873.16s:  toss does it with on him. And yeah, definitely just the toss doesn't let me go back far enough.
5879.96s:  Toss one only lets me go back to 2021. I want to see even though I won't be able to look at the
5885.40s:  options specifically that he had, I do want to see like just what things looked like when
5894.44s:  he was posting and like establishing these these different positions. So the first question I do
5901.08s:  have for you guys though is this is the earliest position I can find for him. Is there anywhere else
5911.72s:  that he's posted that you know of that shows previous positions? Because if not, I'll start from
5918.44s:  here. But if we know somewhere that has earlier positions, I would love love love love to go to
5924.04s:  those if they're available. And then in the meantime, it looks like we need to add New York. Good old
5929.88s:  where I'm from. I will just do New York state. That we got Lancaster. EA. We'll add that in Omaha.
5945.64s:  There's a Omaha's a vibe. Omaha is a vibe. So we're very US heavy. We have representation out in
5961.72s:  the North Pacific. We have representation in the Southern hemisphere through our friends in Brazil.
5967.88s:  So it looks like this is the earliest that we have at least to go off of. We know at this point,
5980.44s:  this is where I mean, he already started scaling in here. So I see that he had a thousand shares at
5989.32s:  this point and then a bunch. Oh no, then not a thousand shares. That's my bad. This was a thousand
5995.48s:  lots total across all these different things. So his recent his latest ad to this position was on
6003.40s:  three. Step. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Yeah, no, it does. Three. Step. Let's go to three. Step.
6012.52s:  Is there a way to draw there is? Oh, perfect. So we'll be able to this is perfect. So this can go here.
6032.20s:  This I can scoot over here. And I can look at each day that he entered. So the earliest was seven
6042.36s:  June. So that's as far back as we need to go.
6051.00s:  Yeah, this is perfect. So then here we'll just go back like six months. Three months.
6057.48s:  Six months. Okay. So seven June is here. I don't know how the drawing works. You have to forgive
6068.36s:  me for a second. There goes. There's seven June. There were way to
6082.76s:  whatever it's fun.
6086.68s:  Vladimir off Putin says wouldn't a spreadsheet of historical data be easier? No, no, no, no. What I
6091.64s:  mixed. Okay. So takes what I'm explicitly trying to do right now is see what he saw
6099.24s:  when he was putting the positions on. So what I'm doing is I'm flagging these different days
6104.44s:  so that I can like literally look at what things looked like. Wait, I'm in 2024.
6113.80s:  No, I'm not. Nick, why are you doing me dirty like this? Or did I not apply it?
6123.24s:  Ah, wait. Now I'm super confused.
6130.20s:  I see. I understand now. Holy shit, I'm stupid. I get it. I get it.
6139.08s:  So we want 2019. And then this is from the eighth of September. So we want this.
6154.52s:  And then we want it. Let's just go back to like June, which is like the beginning of that year.
6159.96s:  Or the beginning of his purchases. So we'll just go back to like May. There we go. Thank you.
6166.12s:  Zacharias says, do you not have Newton's docs? I do. Yeah, I haven't, I mean, I don't know where to find
6174.04s:  everything in there. If this is in there, this would be even easier. I'll grab his.
6184.52s:  Are you saying that this is in there?
6185.72s:  Yeah.
6193.64s:  Yeah, I'm happy to.
6200.60s:  Is this still wrong? This looks right. So I see one May 2019 to eight SAP.
6210.84s:  Yeah, this looks correct.
6215.72s:  Down at the bottom on the little pop up on the y-axis. It shows me
6221.64s:  65 2019. So I think this is correct.
6226.12s:  So it looks like his first buy was on the seventh.
6234.04s:  Here. I need the drawing.
6239.48s:  Seven.
6244.60s:  And then the 20th. Here.
6251.80s:  Oh, that's annoying. You have to like click the box each time.
6261.64s:  Okay.
6264.04s:  And then the 17th.
6269.32s:  So this dude was averaging down hard.
6274.84s:  And the other thing that this tells me is that I mean, some of this is actually kind of
6281.88s:  fascinating to be honest because if you take a look at this buying behavior,
6288.44s:  it, oh, man, this is fascinating. This is like standard trader behavior, man. So we
6295.24s:  bought it on both of these days. The 17th to 18th. And then he waited until the 14th
6303.08s:  all the way down here. Wow, this is, I don't know how cool this is for you guys,
6312.12s:  but I have to be honest, this is very cool for me. The 20th.
6316.04s:  The 20th.
6327.80s:  Here.
6332.76s:  The 22nd twice.
6337.00s:  Interesting.
6340.76s:  The 27th.
6345.80s:  And then the third of set.
6350.68s:  Here.
6360.68s:  Interesting. Robo's, hold on, I'm confused.
6367.80s:  I'm confused.
6373.80s:  BH Murdoch says his initial buys were based on the notion that GameStop was planning a share buyback.
6379.00s:  It was in one of his YouTube vids. Yeah, that makes a ton of sense.
6382.20s:  So here's, here's what I'm seeing. And this is kind of just like a starting point. But
6389.72s:  when I look at this, he bought it after a drop. And it looks like he waited for the drop a
6399.08s:  couple days. And then it looked, it looked like he maybe have bought it when it looked like it was
6404.76s:  starting to consolidate, right? So kind of running sideways here. Then it kind of runs this gap up
6411.16s:  as it's coming down. He's buying again. Then as it's coming down more, he's averaging down
6418.84s:  and here is when he starts putting on some of his, you know, closely timed,
6424.12s:  trades day over day. And then here's when he starts putting on some of his bigger positions
6429.32s:  in terms of lots, right? So here on the 14th, I can see that he put on 200 down here.
6436.52s:  So he was averaging down hard. Now the other thing I see is he started really light with his
6445.48s:  sizing 50, 50, 50, 50, 200. So that's a really, really, really massive, massive average down
6458.92s:  from where he started. Then he added another 100 here. And then he added 100, then 200. So 300
6467.88s:  total, two separate trades. The 200 was added as it was going back up. So what I'm seeing here
6474.52s:  is a trader that's both averaging down and then averaging up, which is really interesting because
6485.24s:  I have to be honest, that's something that I also do very carefully though. It's not something that
6493.16s:  I think works well for a lot of people. But what this tells me is that with whatever money he had in
6500.20s:  the account, $100,000 of the account, it tells me that obviously he was very convicted in what he
6508.44s:  was doing. And he thought he was getting even better value on his original thesis as it was down.
6518.68s:  So what I can tell you from that, that is still an investor mindset. That's less of a trader mindset.
6528.04s:  Way more of an investor mindset. And the other thing that tells me is that this is more of an
6534.04s:  investor mindset is these options were out in 2021. So he's buying these really far out in time.
6545.08s:  And then if you take a look at what his strike is, these are the eight calls. So eight for reference
6554.36s:  is here. Can I draw like a price line? No, I draw a price line. Oh, it's there. There's our price line.
6568.44s:  So here's where he's buying. And then let's go back further in time. Well, this let me.
6574.60s:  This takes me back to today. Hold on, let me go back here. I'm going to take this 2019 back to the first
6581.32s:  apply. And then I want to go back like six months. I think I broke it. Let me do this.
6594.92s:  Maybe I'll just do like six months. And then let's go to 19 again.
6613.24s:  And then this will go.
6618.12s:  There. And then here, let's go to 19. And this is fine. We'll go to like September 30th.
6625.08s:  Weird.
6636.12s:  Not letting me. I don't know what the problem is with that.
6646.76s:  I feel like I'm asking it a fair request. Maybe I'll go back to May. It worked when I did it in May.
6654.60s:  Oh, was it before the stock? When did the stock launch? That's probably I'm an idiot. When did
6660.44s:  wait, when did game stop go public? Maybe that's what it was. It's like I was probably just going back
6665.56s:  before it was even a thing. No, game stuff's been around for a while. In 2002.
6676.44s:  Weird. Yeah, that's super weird. Anyways, it works when I do this. So I'm just going to go from the
6681.40s:  first of May to the 30th of September. It seems to like that. Just fine. Also shout out to the
6687.16s:  apes. There's 200 of you right now learning about roaring kitty. We got a new ham sure. All right,
6693.32s:  let me add that to my list really quick. New ham sure. I have a buddy that lives in Vermont.
6700.60s:  Okay. So this tells me with certainty, right? Conviction in the trade and doesn't care really what
6713.32s:  the price is as long as it's below whatever he thinks the price is going to be, which is obviously
6718.92s:  much higher. Okay, great. So the big takeaways for me when it comes to this one start scaling in small
6726.92s:  then gets bigger when the underlying gets to his eyes a better perceived value, right? This is
6734.84s:  still very much an investor mindset. So now let's scroll up and see if there's any changes in
6740.52s:  the position and there's not. So now the day is September 11th. So let's go there.
6749.24s:  Which is we already have that September 11th is here. He posted on this day with his update.
6760.68s:  So now let's go up again see if there's any changes. Nope, same same. This is end of September.
6767.48s:  This release came out the 30th, which is here. So this is another, another really interesting thing.
6776.84s:  Is that he established this entire position all through here. And one, he was
6784.28s:  directionally correct to a pretty significant degree. And the market doesn't actually fully reward
6790.44s:  him for it. And some of that I think is because his options are actually decaying a bit. He has a
6796.60s:  lot of smaller options in here. So the ones that he really started getting in at cheap are obviously
6804.60s:  showing really massive profits, right? So these ones he got for six grand and they're showing 23 grand.
6811.24s:  But one of the problems he's facing is that even though these options essentially doubled still,
6817.08s:  right? They he got in at 60 and they're trading for $1.20 or so. So still about doubling. But they're
6825.88s:  much, much, much smaller positions. So here, even he was very correct. I'm surprised that he didn't
6834.20s:  use more of his money in here though. Let me double check that because something weird.
6842.68s:  Okay, that's weird. So I don't see any change in these positions. I have to make sure I'm looking
6850.12s:  really closely. But I notice his cash goes down. This is the same.
6862.60s:  This is not the same. You see? So did any of these change that I'm not missing 50 50 50 200 100 100 200 100 100
6875.24s:  50 50 50 200 100 100. Yeah. Okay. So there's no changes to any of these.
6883.64s:  So it looks like cash came out of the account for some reason.
6890.44s:  Yeah, saddric. I think he's on the I think he's on the I think you're on the right path.
6895.56s:  Yeah, like he just that's a withdrawal. That's cash coming out of the account. Okay. So now
6902.76s:  let's go here. Still no changes. This is October 31st. So now let's go to October 31st.
6914.52s:  It still likes it. Great. So here, next update, no change.
6922.68s:  More money.
6930.68s:  117.
6936.44s:  What?
6940.44s:  So part of my confusion here is there's 1124 1117K. A month later,
6951.40s:  he's still at 1117 solid with 11 added.
6959.64s:  So he has he added cash.
6965.64s:  But it's still up a ton.
6972.52s:  That confuses me.
6973.64s:  Oh, never mind. Okay. That makes more sense. So it's yeah. Okay. Sorry. That makes
6983.08s:  the ton of sense. My bad. I was really confused because this looked like obviously a big run-up
6988.44s:  from here. But that's why the position looks so similar to his September update is because
6995.24s:  if we look at the end of September here, it's essentially flat with worries at the end of
7001.24s:  October. Okay. Makes sense. So now we go up. No trade still. End of November.
7009.32s:  Cash is out. And I see no new trades. So there's a withdrawal. So now let's update this.
7023.00s:  November.
7023.88s:  Okay.
7032.44s:  So here we had cash come out. And then here we had cash go in over the course of the month,
7043.48s:  not on that day specifically. Okay. Here we go. So now we have a new trade on 11 December.
7053.80s:  We now have a new trade. So again, on a big gap down. He likes to buy when it's dropping.
7066.84s:  What I don't understand though is why wouldn't... Man, I just don't fully understand this.
7074.44s:  Now let me go one more day so that I can at least highlight this damn candle.
7078.36s:  Oh.
7083.40s:  Ah, that's so interesting. I don't...
7090.76s:  Is that zooming in? That is.
7095.80s:  I'm just... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What have I done? All right.
7102.52s:  This is...
7108.36s:  Yo, hold on. I've just messed everything up. There we go. Okay.
7114.44s:  So now it drops and he buys another hundred. And here's another thing I see.
7124.60s:  The account value is up to 230K. And if fucking drops to 63,000 dollars, it gets murdered.
7134.84s:  So a big reason, and it's funny because again, this is the world of options, is because even though
7142.36s:  on 11 December, it's still much higher than where it's been for him. Right? So if we look at 11 December,
7155.16s:  it's essentially higher than all of the bulk of his buys.
7159.56s:  Vladimir Offputin says April 2020, I'm trying to save you time. We talk about.
7165.08s:  Save me time with what? This is Mr. Offputin. This is what I'm trying to do with my time. I'm trying to...
7173.00s:  The, again, I'll reiterate, the whole point of doing this is to look at the movements he's making
7179.48s:  and what it looked like when he made those movements. Like, I'm... This is something I call
7185.56s:  fingerprinting. So the whole idea behind this is, again, I have zero intention, personally,
7193.32s:  of trying to model any specific trade after roaring Kitty. I would never trade off of somebody else
7200.04s:  personally. I'll use some of their movements or research to fuel my ideas, but I wouldn't necessarily
7206.76s:  just try to follow him. What I'm interested about though is the way and the buying behavior that he
7215.24s:  has because roaring Kitty as a character is absolutely unequivocally fascinating to me.
7223.48s:  The things that he does and the reasons why he does it is crazy. It's just so interesting. So
7230.84s:  that's the whole point here. There's honestly no... This is what I'm trying to do. There's not
7236.28s:  saving me time. This is precisely how I want to spend my time in this instance. Is to take a look
7241.48s:  at these exact things. So... Let's actually read some of these in between these. I haven't been doing
7252.92s:  that. What do you think it should be? Let's see. Let's add that. I'm going to get rid of...
7261.08s:  Let me close some of these. Just let it have some room to move.
7276.20s:  Okay. Okay. So that's gone.
7285.32s:  Zachary says, when did the CARES Act allow you to pull from retirement? I don't know much about that.
7291.96s:  Mike Welles says, roaring Kitty started July 13th, 2020 on YouTube. In
7298.36s:  Nove on X, he breaks it all down for you if you have 100 plus to watch.
7310.44s:  Oh, you mean like in terms of his methodology? Yeah. I've watched some of his videos. I haven't
7317.08s:  watched all of them yet. Thanks. So he's talking about, again, he's still talking value investor
7325.24s:  standpoint, trigger a version to fair value. Still free cash flow positive. Again, that is
7335.72s:  very, very standard value investor. Console refresh can't save GME, but should help slow stabilize
7342.12s:  decline. So this is one is this one's a December 11th. So he's obviously talking about this drop here,
7349.24s:  right here. What's a better name to be long? So obviously supremely, supremely convicted.
7361.80s:  What kind of chart looking all the time? I'm a fundamental value investor through and through.
7368.04s:  Aha. So this starts to make sense to me because it says I'm a fundamental investor through and
7375.72s:  through, but I've come to appreciate how charts can telegraph information to investors. I use
7379.88s:  mostly for screening and timing, which is really interesting because this also lines up a little
7385.08s:  bit with some of the behaviors I saw with respect to the some of his videos that talk about
7391.80s:  specifically his move from being a value investor, quote, unquote, which happened in the more
7398.68s:  recent YouTube videos. So this is fascinating to see even this starting to creep in, right? Like
7405.40s:  so fundamental value investor, but now we're talking about an appreciation for charts, which makes
7411.16s:  a ton of sense, but this is on 11 December. So very, very cool. I look at charts of many companies,
7419.08s:  not just GME. So this is the 12th. So still around this time frame. So far, but that's a relevant
7427.64s:  yell at me for being dumb or being tell voted who cares what it's done since 2018. What matters to
7433.08s:  me is what it does in 2020. Since August, GM is up more than all of those companies. So he's up here,
7439.64s:  he's still defending and talking about his thesis, which also tells me a lot to be honest. It tells me
7445.40s:  that he's still, let me see if I can see the top comment here. He's still diving into a little bit
7457.08s:  of like why he's doing. I've always respect for iron hands, no matter how retarded they may be.
7466.44s:  This guy does there's some kind of flair. Buries top or bottom.
7476.28s:  So you belong here. You're real determined to make that wow. This is fascinating. I didn't
7484.52s:  realize that people were like like this towards him. This is interesting. Perfect.
7500.04s:  Oh no, child. What is you doing? That's a great comment. That's hilarious.
7507.80s:  Do just what the fuck so many names to be long and you do this.
7512.28s:  They cut EPS guidance by 90% what the hell is your both thesis here? This is actually a great question
7517.80s:  though to be completely honest. Like this part is, you know, whatever. But this I, this I think is
7524.36s:  interesting. What's a better name to be long? SPX, Goog, Apple, Tesla, all these names.
7530.36s:  Who cares what it's done since 2018? What matters? What it does going forward?
7535.32s:  GME will be lucky to make it through 2020 without receivership.
7542.36s:  You believe bankruptcy is on the table for GME?
7552.28s:  Interesting.
7554.76s:  You know, this is fascinating.
7567.40s:  The thing I'm really enjoying right now is seeing the way he still discusses
7574.52s:  like his thoughts.
7579.64s:  Vladimir says arcade didn't move the stock then. He was distanced. Yeah. Yeah. It's crazy.
7584.84s:  Because the thing is I get Wall Street bets is what it is. And again, like the other thing
7591.72s:  that I absolutely would poke fun. Again, like not knowing the future, but I would poke fun or,
7596.52s:  you know, identify for somebody like Rory and Kitty is like, it is nuts to put your entire portfolio
7602.12s:  into calls in something like GameStop at this time. Like that is such a wild thesis.
7609.00s:  Again, it can work out, but to be that concentrated, I think it does make sense for Wall Street
7614.36s:  bets, right? Like that is truly a yellow bet. But I think the difference is is when I see the cat
7620.12s:  talking about his ideas, he's like really getting into detail on like the background. It's not like
7628.36s:  he's just throwing money into some shit, right? Like he saw something that he truly felt was an
7633.80s:  opportunity. Now again, for everybody else that looks at this and they start thinking like,
7638.68s:  oh, you know, like I'm going to be the next Rory and Kitty. I think it's cool to think that way
7643.00s:  and it's cool to desire that kind of stuff. The problem though is that it's a really, really,
7651.40s:  low problem. It's kind of like trying to follow somebody into winning the lottery. It's very
7656.12s:  difficult to do because again, like I look at this and I see Rory and Kitty was really convicted.
7663.80s:  And the thesis played out. It worked beautifully. Super high risk though. Like super high risk.
7670.36s:  There's no, there's no other way about it. It's just interesting. All right, so let's see.
7678.68s:  What degrees is priced in? Yeah. Okay, let's get to the next one. Okay. So we added more here.
7685.80s:  This is perfect. So this was 31D's 19. And on shit, it doesn't tell me.
7699.80s:  Damn it, Kitty. He added a bunch of shit. Damn it.
7708.36s:  So he has 21 Fab. So he got busy here.
7719.16s:  He got real busy here. So I can't tell exactly what the timeframes are just yet.
7730.36s:  Jonathan says, remember it's 401 stocks split when looking at the price. Yeah.
7734.28s:  The main thing I'm just talking about is I can see the total number of contracts changed drastically.
7740.20s:  So I see 600 here, 600 here, 400, 400, 200. Whereas down here, I see 1100 total. So when I say that
7748.28s:  he got busy, he just started putting on a bunch more options trades in different explorations.
7754.04s:  Now the slight downside is he doesn't have those open. So I can't see exactly what happened.
7761.56s:  So what I will do is fast forward us a little bit more. We'll go to like the end of January.
7768.12s:  And then essentially from this point in December,
7775.32s:  this region, I know that he bought a bunch of options. I don't know when what went on. But
7784.92s:  again, looking at this from his perspective, as this is moving, we're buying in as it goes down,
7792.60s:  it goes down, then it's rallying up as soon as it drops again, he starts buying again.
7797.96s:  And then if I had to guess when he was adding more to this, I would guess it's on these days.
7803.48s:  That's my guess based. And again, this is just part of fingerprinting. This is starting to get a
7808.20s:  feel for when he's putting on these bigger positions. That's my guess. And then my guess is we'll see him
7813.96s:  transact more in mid Jan 2020. That's just a guess I don't know yet. So let's actually see.
7822.60s:  But let's see some of these updates in the meantime. How do you question?
7831.40s:  There it is. Finally, I was wondering how to just see the top comment for these things.
7836.36s:  What's your read on last earnings release? I know you added more after they cut EPS for, wow,
7842.68s:  look at this. He's down to 112. He absolutely got crushed here.
7854.28s:  Damn, I didn't look at the cash. I'm just looking at the cash real quick. So like,
7860.36s:  less than a grand, 20 grand. And then we're here now, six grand. So he used a bunch of it.
7869.00s:  All right. So let's take a look at
7874.28s:  day swags. It's just stopping in and I'm out celebrating my friends wedding. But I love you.
7877.80s:  I'll have a good night. Great to see you. Day swag. Have a killer time. My dude. Enjoy it.
7884.44s:  Uh, freemak free or since I like your muscle man, it's just a tank top.
7889.64s:  It's like a standard, a standard tank top. It's hot here in California right now, man. It's like
7894.44s:  90 degrees plus.
7900.20s:  Okay. So back to this though. What you read on last year are cut EPS guidance from like
7906.52s:  115 to 0.2. So this is where we're talking about like a really, really, a really big drop.
7914.04s:  And then it says, okay, so let's see. Sandbagging, yes, it's possible. 30 to 40% chance. Okay.
7922.92s:  So what they're talking about here in terms of sandbagging it is trying to guide down and to
7927.24s:  try to slow things down. Based on the incredibly aggressive share repurchasing Q2 sentiment expressed
7934.52s:  on the latest CC the decision to sell their, their corporate jet management is now shown their
7941.40s:  cards. They're on the side of the shareholders. Yeah, I agree. This is, this is man, very, very
7946.68s:  pressing of him. So this tells me with like again, we are like full, deep, fucking value. Like that's
7955.88s:  this is the, this type of conversation is completely, completely wrapped in value investing.
7964.68s:  Reclassification latest 10 Q. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course, it's possible. Simply underestimate the
7971.08s:  degree of cyclical secular design such an extreme fashion. Yeah, yeah. Next gen consoles won't be released
7977.88s:  until 2020 Q4. Okay. So just talking about general general picture there, fascinating.
7986.36s:  Okay. So we know this period he got, he got busy. He built a lot.
7992.84s:  Take a look. So mostly this is so funny. So like to see the mutation of his character is just
8001.40s:  epic, right? Like a lot of discussion points, a lot of like arguing, so to speak back and forth.
8007.08s:  Right. So fair point, but I'm sure you'd agree it's not uncommon for analysts to forecast poorly.
8010.84s:  Right. So he's like talking about his things and then like take a look, it just starts going
8016.28s:  more and more into just memes and gifts. Okay. So what happened? Oh, damn. Got murdered.
8027.64s:  Jan 2020, end of month. 31, Jan. Okay. So that's where we are now. Did he do anything? I would
8036.44s:  really think he would do something in here. 4 4 6 6 5. He did. He did. No, he did not. Wait,
8047.08s:  he did or did these come off? The 17 Jan's rolled off. I see. Okay. So 17 Jan's, my guess is those
8056.52s:  just probably came down for. Yeah, these were worth nothing at the point. They were worth like a
8063.32s:  hundred bucks. So it looks like these we just kind of took into expiration. And then I realized I
8068.20s:  have to have to send our dinner order off. Perfect. All right. So we got a little bit before that
8080.20s:  shows up. I am thoroughly enjoying going through this. This is absolutely incredible to me.
8087.96s:  Yeah. So it looks like he just let those go. And he didn't do anything here that shocking. So 64
8100.60s:  hundred bucks there, 64 hundred bucks there, just sat on the cash. Very surprising.
8107.08s:  And a feb. Here we go. So now we can finally see where some of these others came on.
8113.00s:  So now he's down to 183 bucks. So let's go to the end of feb.
8122.36s:  And I see 4 6 6 1000. So then obviously these febs came down for a loss. And then we were left
8130.76s:  with these like the April's the July's the Jan's and then the April's of the next year.
8136.12s:  Should be right. So April's July's Jan's April the next year. Yep. And it looks like he built
8141.08s:  into this. So when did he buy buy into this the 31st? Oh, okay. Yeah. So he did start buying
8150.52s:  in when I thought he would. I was really, really surprised that it didn't look like he did. So
8156.04s:  these 16 April's started going on the 31st of December, which is here.
8166.84s:  And then on this tiny little candle, you literally can't even see it. And then
8171.16s:  he started scaling in more on the third, which is here. On a down day.
8183.56s:  And then in 2020, we have
8186.68s:  February 18th with three separate transactions all at 20.
8200.20s:  February 18th. I gotta grab the box. Look at
8206.36s:  the
8211.16s:  February 18th. Okay. So the account is not doing well. These longer term options that he got back here
8225.96s:  are decaying. Okay. So let's see. A bunch of gifts started at a Hyundai. He was up
8236.12s:  over 200 200 now. He's down to 40.
8245.16s:  Okay. So he's kind of defending himself a little bit there. Okay. So April of 2020.
8254.92s:  We'll go to the end of April.
8257.00s:  Michael says, can you add RSI and MAs? Yeah. What? Well, I don't know what it will let me add
8268.60s:  indicators.
8272.20s:  Oh, wrong one. My bad. Click out.
8276.60s:  Nope. My bad. RSI.
8283.40s:  How do I remove this one?
8286.60s:  There we go.
8291.56s:  Mac, do you kill that?
8297.32s:  Generational timing says, how many options do you think expired worthlister in this time?
8301.00s:  That's a great question. So a lot. So if we do like a quick stroll through, we had 17 Jan,
8308.76s:  21 Fab and then April of 20. And that was 244. And we got in for eight plus 16 grand there.
8325.64s:  So the Jans came off for probably nothing. The 21 fabs are about to come off for nothing. And then
8333.48s:  the 17 Aprils will be coming up soon, probably for nothing. Yeah. So those are gone for nothing.
8346.60s:  So at least at least 16 to 20 grand, something like that. I think like that.
8356.44s:  Yeah, because the interesting part is some of these were showing a really healthy profit.
8360.52s:  Okay, so let's see what happened in here on the 30th of April. We have 17 July, 17 July,
8368.76s:  and then April 16 April. And then let's go here.
8377.32s:  July, Jan April. Oh, did I just miss read that? Is that Jan?
8381.24s:  No, interesting. So, oh, interesting. So these came off. So he has 15 Jan 21, eight calls.
8402.12s:  Those aren't here. So he sold them.
8404.04s:  And these are for 2021. That's interesting. So was it just to unlock this money? Yeah,
8414.52s:  because he had the bulk of his capital in this 26 grand.
8420.28s:  Of lot of me says there's another position post you need to click on start of short squeeze. Okay.
8426.04s:  Where's that at up here?
8429.88s:  This one.
8434.44s:  Okay. Yep. Thank you. So April, July, July. Okay. So we still got rid of that jam position though.
8445.00s:  So this is 14 April. This is 30 April. So now I know. Oops.
8457.08s:  Now I know that between here, which is Feb.
8474.04s:  Here, somewhere in here, the end of Feb, he had these 15 Jan 21s. So the end of Feb, which is here.
8483.48s:  Let me zoom in.
8490.76s:  And if Feb is right here. So at the end of Feb, he still had these 15 Jan 21s.
8500.04s:  And then I know within what the 14th was there not a March update? Did I miss a March update? Feb.
8513.40s:  So there's no March update. It's just April. So then by the 14th of April,
8521.40s:  here, he sold some.
8533.00s:  And this is still a little bit before I can look in on demand and think or swim. I can figure out.
8540.20s:  I can figure out if we want you tell me if we want to know what the options we're trading for here,
8547.72s:  I can I can find what those Jan.
8560.20s:  I can find what these were at.
8564.12s:  So we got them for 47 cents or 44 cents.
8570.04s:  Yeah.
8570.92s:  So we got in at 44 cents.
8582.60s:  One of these Jan's get added though. 15 Jan, they're there. 15 Jan, they're there. So this is one
8591.08s:  of those first tranches, I think. Yeah. 15 Jan, they're there. 15 Jan, they're there. So this
8600.36s:  goes all the way back. These are like some of the first positions you got into 11 December 19.
8607.80s:  15 Jan. Yep. So this might be like one of those literally the first positions you put on. Yep.
8612.76s:  These are the first positions I see. So these are from all the way back September 8th. So the reason
8618.60s:  why that matters is because we've go back to September 8th wherever these were added.
8630.84s:  He would have made some money, but he actually wouldn't have made a ton of money on those January calls.
8639.24s:  So I'm actually really interested in understanding a little bit more about the
8644.20s:  the sale decision there.
8647.88s:  Because he's still at time left on those options. So that's just an interesting point.
8657.08s:  That's a really interesting point.
8663.48s:  You server still, we still got to catch up here. Okay.
8667.32s:  And 2025, 2020 were a prior. Man, we made it through a lot of these April, May,
8676.20s:  this is all. Okay. So this is where we're at now.
8683.64s:  Interesting. We can kill that.
8686.76s:  So a couple of things surprise me here. One of the things let's see. So this is,
8696.84s:  we've added shares at 406.
8703.40s:  End of May. Okay. So we'll have to get to the end of May. Let's move this. May 31.
8710.12s:  We'll go. Oh, fuck my bad. That's fine. We have to go to May here.
8735.80s:  Okay.
8740.12s:  Yeah.
8750.36s:  This looks like, yeah, this is 2024. Yo, let me go back.
8754.92s:  Oh, it's doing this weird shit again. June. Let's try June to June.
8762.52s:  Damn it.
8769.96s:  It was going so well. I had the, I had all the rules quirks figured out.
8775.96s:  So from 2019, we'll start from there. That's fine. Start from right there.
8781.64s:  And then this will be 2020 now. And we need to go to May.
8793.32s:  Not let me do it. Damn it. Maybe I'll try just doing 2020.
8801.80s:  Yeah. So maybe we'll try like 0101 2020. I have to put the slashes in there.
8809.48s:  Keep bastards. Let's try that. And then we'll try to go to 2020 here.
8818.60s:  And let's try to go to like the end of June.
8822.92s:  Well, let me. What the hell?
8833.96s:  Damn it. Why don't you let me do this? Maybe I'll go to like May?
8844.04s:  Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
8847.88s:  All right. So then I guess what I'll just do is see if it'll let me look at like 2020 in total or something.
8861.96s:  No, I'll just refresh and go back in time.
8873.00s:  Yeah. And then I can just scroll on zoom in. This is fine.
8877.80s:  And I not do one daily interval.
8889.40s:  All right.
8892.76s:  All right. So let's go back. I think we're on and now 22 21 20. Okay. Cool. We're back at it.
8900.76s:  A little technical difficulties with this platform, but we got it. Okay. So now it's the end of May.
8911.16s:  And we have shares now at 406. And as we pointed out, this is obviously before we had the split.
8920.20s:  So this would be split adjusted. And we have July 20 calls at 6 and 12.
8930.76s:  So he's still going really far out of the money. He's buying cheap options.
8936.76s:  150 grand 88K and cash. So he's over half cash. So here you go. Yes, I took some profits the same day.
8947.48s:  Burry as it turned out, been buying the recent dip, new strikes, explorations.
8956.76s:  Robo says that he exercised. I don't think so.
8959.32s:  So the thing is is for people that buy calls, it is generally inefficient to exercise.
8966.76s:  You normally don't want to. There's only like specific circumstances where it would be logical
8972.36s:  or makes sense to exercise. So now end of June.
8979.24s:  Interesting. All right. I'm going to take a note so that I can pause us here and then we'll pick up
8988.92s:  on this. The last thing because I have to hop off in a few minutes. But what I want to do is just
8994.44s:  take a quick look at GameStop as it sits today so that we don't run out of time for that.
9001.40s:  So then I'll take a note on June 2020, Yolo update left off,
9011.48s:  RK positions, part two. So then I'll set a note for myself that essentially come back here.
9021.40s:  And then next weekend we'll finish going through this. But I do want to make time
9035.48s:  at a link. There you go. Cool.
9042.20s:  Chris says, how many viewers did you have at your peak on this live stream? Yeah, let's see.
9047.24s:  It looks like we're a little bit lighter now because we've gone through for a hot minute.
9051.80s:  It looks like like 230 I think is what we hit at the max. Mr. Demel. Great to see you by the way.
9059.96s:  It's been a minute. Yeah, we had 230. All right. So oh boy. That was a mistake. Sorry.
9067.16s:  So now let's take a look at what this looks like.
9080.44s:  Let's take a look at what this looks like today.
9084.04s:  Because the options chains now we're coming into earnings.
9089.32s:  BH Murdoch says you miss like seven Chicago peeps. Yeah, let me add them really quick. I have
9098.76s:  don't you worry. I have our handy dandy map ready to go.
9103.72s:  Chicago. Oops, didn't mean the airport. We don't want that one. We want Chicago.
9113.56s:  Got it. And then Toledo got it.
9118.84s:  Holy Toledo. I don't really know where that saying comes from.
9124.12s:  Perfect. So we got those two added. Thanks for the heads up. All right, let's take a look at some
9129.64s:  GameStop as it sits today. So it has earnings coming up. It's still currently holding for 10th after
9139.32s:  the close. And right now for me, it's in a very heavy consolidation. Now I did tell you that
9148.76s:  I would talk a little bit about how I traded it for this move. So essentially what happened when
9156.20s:  we started seeing those trades come through it like 840 to 850. I started building a position
9164.04s:  not for the front week because I actually was expecting to run this position for a little bit
9169.00s:  longer than I ended up running it. But what I wanted to do is gain exposure to the near term
9174.92s:  momentum that I was expecting in GameStop after seeing those two trades come through. So it was
9180.36s:  like the very, very beginning part of building a position. So what I ended up doing, this is my
9186.12s:  pass through account. So there's nothing in here. But what I ended up doing was going out past
9191.56s:  past earnings, but not out too far because I really wanted to try to just let these options
9198.84s:  compound a little bit because I already have a little bit of a longer term position.
9203.48s:  So what I did was I went out into the 20-sep and I went slightly in the money.
9208.76s:  So I bought two different tranches of those like right around like 850, 855.
9215.88s:  And then I sold one of those tranches essentially 915 when I saw this start coming down and I still
9223.56s:  have another one of those tranches that I'm expecting to hopefully hold on to for a little bit.
9231.08s:  But it's mostly going to be a like tightly managed trade because they're still showing a profit
9237.48s:  right now. And if we have a gap down, I probably would exit those because they're a little short
9242.36s:  term for me. I prefer slightly longer term options. But that's essentially how I played this
9247.72s:  like just near term pop that was relatively small.
9255.80s:  Dom says Eric YouTube ringdinger. I have sciatica 2 and it's supposed to help tremendously.
9260.36s:  Yeah, I'll definitely take a look. Thank you. Yeah, like I said, I had that MRI
9265.72s:  Friday. So I think I'm probably going to try to get that quarterstone shot or something.
9270.44s:  That's the idea right now. So we have Minnesota that we have to add.
9274.92s:  And then we also have Arizona. My brother is in Flagstaff.
9279.96s:  We have to add that. Then we have Ireland. That's actually on our travel list.
9285.88s:  I had a road trip planned out for us essentially going from Belfaster, Dublin and going along
9291.64s:  all the way along the coast down here. So that might be on our radar.
9300.84s:  Inder says Vancouver. Yeah, let's grab Vancouver. I was just there not too long ago.
9307.64s:  I like Vancouver quite a lot. A lot of drug people.
9310.52s:  Maria. You could tell you.
9319.08s:  We got our Mexican peeps here.
9322.76s:  Sweet. Building our chart out. All right, so
9328.04s:  earnings coming up. Let's take a look at these options.
9331.00s:  240. So massive, massive, massive, massive call skew right now, massive call skew.
9339.00s:  And it looks like a lot of them now are just from a volume perspective, just tons of calls traded.
9348.04s:  This is obviously on Friday. And then open interest. We had left off at 537 to 266. So we had a lot
9356.92s:  come out. But my guesses will see a lot coming in because when I look at this, my guess is most of
9364.44s:  these 13-sep trades were probably opening positions to gain exposure for the next trading week.
9371.40s:  That's what I'm expecting most of these to be opening up. So then looking at the vol,
9378.36s:  we have pretty high vol 18837 for the front expiration. It's not astronomical. And then it drops
9386.44s:  off 155133. So definitely seeing some earnings vol being priced in. And if we take a look at this
9393.56s:  chain before everything from last week cycles over, we have a bit of depth at the 24th. The 22 and a
9401.00s:  half got hit with a lot of volume previously, not a lot of change in OI. So this will be a lot of
9410.44s:  building volume, I think. And then I see. Same thing for the 23s. There's more volume than OI. So
9420.04s:  people are building into those. I see the same thing here for the 24s. Definitely the same thing
9425.72s:  for the 25s. So there are a lot of people building out in this 13-sep expiration. And if I take a look
9433.40s:  from the put side, it's not quite the same style of build out, but they're definitely as put build out
9438.60s:  as well. So let's take a look at just the vol surface really quick at a curiosity.
9447.32s:  And then I want to use just these front ones. So I'm still not seeing that same style of really,
9457.16s:  really massive volatility skewed to the upside. So that will happen sometimes in GameStop specifically,
9464.36s:  but I'm not necessarily seeing that here. I do see this kind of peak. This is just again like a
9473.80s:  tradable relative value thing at 1550. So that would be on the put side. And yeah, so the
9485.00s:  vol otherwise looks fairly normal with a little bit more tail side. But if you take a look at 20
9491.08s:  sep, it's the inverse. This is actually the interesting thing. So normally, this is what you'll see
9497.40s:  for a volatility smile. This is kind of a surface because there's multiple lines, but this is more
9501.88s:  of a smile. And this is just looking at the put side because we're looking at the out of the
9509.16s:  monies. And you'll see that the put side is pretty high. And the highest put side is higher than
9515.40s:  the highest call side, right? So then when I look down this, though, I can see for the what is this?
9523.64s:  The 20 sep expiration. It's actually a slightly different story. And we see that the call side
9531.56s:  actually exceeds the put side, which is just generally interesting. That's typically the market
9538.92s:  pricing in a bit more of an upside move. And we can see that the strikes out here right now are
9543.80s:  going out to the 50 on the 20 seps. So it doesn't look like they have the, let me do all of these
9551.24s:  really quick. Yeah. So that right now the strikes out there are only going out to 50. They're not
9555.96s:  doing like the 125 to the 150s again. So Tanner says regarding potential DFV pump and dump is
9564.44s:  a reasonable to think that the participant with short exposure that doesn't want it to pop would
9569.56s:  short those calls are not. No, they wouldn't short the calls because by shorting the calls themselves,
9578.36s:  they kind of put themselves if they don't want something to pump, quote unquote, they really would
9585.40s:  put themselves in a disadvantageous spot. And it's also not enough to really offset that because
9592.04s:  when somebody buys those calls that are at the money, the market makers are going to see the order
9598.36s:  come through before it's on, right? So the ones fulfilling the order. So they would either decide
9603.96s:  do they want to run with them or do they want to hedge the trade and they probably would hedge the
9608.04s:  trade. And because it was a short term thing, they probably would have used stock. But right now,
9613.56s:  there's still an abundance of stock in GameStop. So yeah, I don't really think that that's what we
9622.60s:  saw on the opposite side there. I my best guess is from that trade. It looks like whoever bought
9628.04s:  them unwound them. That's what it looks like. And again, that's why it's slightly confusing to me.
9636.28s:  Because the person I would assume to buy them would be roaring kitty, but that I wouldn't assume
9641.40s:  that to be his move just looked insignificant at best for somebody like him. So not so sure.
9651.32s:  Now coming into earnings, though, if we take a look at some of GameStop's previous earnings moves.
9660.28s:  And we can see that it tends to maintain some level of risk premiums. And I see, so from this is
9670.36s:  me talking as Eric the options trader, this is a normal event that I try to trade earnings releases.
9679.08s:  And this earnings got all messed up. This earnings has pretty elevated vol 120 percent,
9687.16s:  but it's not as high as some of these other vols. 140. So my guess is the vols here might
9696.68s:  come up a bit. But it typically maintains risk premiums through. So yeah, this is interesting from
9708.28s:  a volatility trading perspective. Let me look at one other tool really quick.
9726.68s:  They have like a slightly tricky login process. So I have to get like a verification.
9739.56s:  I we in let's take a look at GameStop. Then let's take a look at earnings.
9747.64s:  Okay, so it's average implied move is 12.9 percent. And it's average actual move is 13.5. This is
9754.68s:  for the past 12 earnings releases. And it tends to fall within range for the expected move,
9763.64s:  except for the last one. Because the last one got so contorted with the timing in June. So right now,
9773.08s:  it's implying what do we see like almost an 11 or 12 percent move, something like that.
9785.08s:  So I mean, this looks like a really interesting earnings trade. For me, the approach here is kind
9791.40s:  of standard fair. It'll be maintained exposure via the long shares, play the options if they
9796.92s:  start coming alive. It's a little early, but I see a few things going on that make me happy.
9802.76s:  I see a big, big bump in buy volume, right? If you take a look at this candle, take a look at
9809.40s:  the volume on that day. Again, when we go back to all of these prior really big moves,
9815.32s:  there are things like this. So if I look at the volume that we saw on Friday, it was 24 million,
9823.88s:  right? And the 20 day average was 6.5 million. The five day average was 12 million. So it's
9830.52s:  essentially double the average volume for five days. And a droople almost not quite triple plus.
9839.00s:  On the average for 20 for 20 days. So if we take a look at some of these preceding kind of jumps
9845.32s:  that we've seen just in terms of volume that's starting to get interesting. So I'm really,
9851.72s:  really curious how this volume plays out. Some of it will be for earnings. Some of it will be
9856.52s:  from that news, but it wouldn't surprise me to see some level of follow through because again,
9863.72s:  these kinds of jumps in volume mostly by side volume starts to, again, peak my interest.
9869.88s:  I also see from a general oscillator perspective, all the oscillators are starting to ascend.
9875.80s:  So it looks like it is starting to grab a little bit of traction just in terms of developing a level
9882.44s:  of momentum. So yeah, I mean, it looks interesting. I need to see what the options look like
9891.48s:  once the volume from last week is factored in, but it looks like most of the people are
9896.44s:  positioning for this coming week. So we have to see how earnings go, but I am absolutely excited
9902.68s:  to see it. All right, gang, I think this is my longest stream I've ever done almost three hours,
9908.60s:  but it goes by in a blast for me. I love talking about this stuff. I love exploring the market
9915.16s:  and specifically GameStop with the apes out there. So thank you for taking the time to teach me
9921.32s:  a little bit more about this and help me explore it. It's super, super fun. I love doing it. So
9926.36s:  thanks everybody for hanging out. We had over 200 people, which is so sick. Love that.
9932.20s:  Hope everybody has an absolutely awesome weekend. And as you know, I do live streams every single day
9937.48s:  at 5 p.m. Pacific time. So I will see you at another live stream. Catch you all later. Be an outlier.
9944.20s:  See you guys.
