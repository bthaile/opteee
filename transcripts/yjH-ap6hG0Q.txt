0.00s: What is up apes outliers outlier apes, whoever we have coming to hang out.
8.16s: I wish I could show you this setup I just got in place for the session tonight because
12.60s: we have, we got a lot to talk about.
17.32s: So I got I got seltzer waters.
20.04s: I have drugs.
21.88s: I got a set of medicine ready to rock and roll.
24.64s: I got my other prescription anti inflammatory.
27.20s: I even brought a snack for those that don't know.
30.00s: I only eat once a day, which is normally around now, but I hold off.
35.40s: So you know, whoever, who knows where this goes?
38.52s: So I have my little protein pouch thing.
41.00s: I don't really care about eating.
42.16s: I'm one of those weird people.
43.24s: I like, I couldn't care less if there is a pill that I could take that would give me
47.76s: everything I need.
48.76s: I would be all about that.
50.48s: I would waste zero time with it, but that's not how life is.
54.80s: So we, we're about to get stuck in like a tick.
59.16s: That's the goal.
60.16s: Let me grab this chat and we are going to be off to the races.
63.76s: All right.
64.76s: So what's the game plan for today?
65.76s: I have a couple things that I really want to do.
68.36s: And then everything else that pops up along the ways you all know I'm here for it.
72.76s: We can go left, right upside down, sideways, down for whatever we want to cover.
78.04s: So feel free to throw in the chat.
79.52s: If there's anything you want to take a look at any ideas, it's all, it's all fair game.
83.68s: So now what I would like to cover today though is my original game plan is to go back
89.96s: through more of roaring kiddie's old trades.
94.24s: And I want to use the on demand feature fingers crossed that it's working.
99.60s: And I want to use the on demand feature and think or swim so that we can like actually
103.52s: look at the market based on the differences in his portfolio.
107.76s: So the first one that we're going to do it will be his portfolio as it was that first
111.64s: post I think it was what in 20.
114.52s: I don't remember 22.
115.52s: No, it wasn't 22 is 2020 maybe whatever it was.
118.60s: Well, I have the the Reddit thread up with all this stuff.
122.28s: So I want to go through those and I want to take a look and funny enough.
127.92s: It's actually even more important now to do this in my opinion with the trades that we
133.32s: saw last week.
135.68s: So my thought is we start with what happened last week.
140.48s: And then we can dive into his historic trades and stuff like that.
144.92s: But you know, we got to say hello to everybody.
147.08s: So we got co co yo why why that's a hell of a name.
153.08s: They say going to be a good one.
155.16s: Love me some speculation.
156.16s: Yeah, there's going to be some heavy heavy speculation in this one.
160.64s: So that's straight up.
163.56s: No capitals says tinfoil hats on.
165.56s: I have mine ready to go.
167.40s: The Viking tin hat is ready to it's ready to rock and roll whenever we need it.
174.32s: Probably not much need up front, but we'll I mean, we'll see where we go.
177.64s: Who knows it's going to get weird in here.
178.96s: I think we all kind of know that it's it's it's about to get real.
185.12s: We got roaring clitty probably one of the best names on planet earth.
190.04s: One fact I have dryer sheets in my pocket because I was in the process of throwing them
194.12s: out earlier.
195.12s: But then my wife was like organizing stuff and there was a perfect opportunity for me to
200.60s: grab her phone and then take a bunch of pictures of the dog.
204.24s: I love doing that.
205.64s: So I mean, like normally I can get like 50 to like 150 photos done before she realizes
210.36s: which is kind of fun for me.
212.16s: So that's why there's dryer sheets in my pocket in case anybody was wondering.
217.32s: We got dark mark.
218.64s: I wonder where light mark is.
220.60s: Aviator geek.
222.00s: I mean, that's kind of a good.
223.84s: I would I would like my aviators to be geeks.
226.56s: So that's good threshold solutions is here Reese raptures.
230.64s: That's kind of a heavy name.
232.04s: Dirt slup.
233.28s: What up?
234.28s: Dirt slup Ricky Selgato says Eric, how would you recommend trading the downside of GME
238.88s: after big run ups?
239.88s: Yeah, we can talk about that in a little bit.
241.44s: I know some people get really weird about that conversation.
244.40s: I was actually talking with a few folks in the discord about stuff like that.
248.88s: I mean, I'll talk about it, right?
250.84s: Like it's it's still a tradable product.
253.28s: It's still going to exhibit movements.
255.28s: I personally won't short stock in GameStop and I really don't like taking downside like long
261.00s: term downside positions really in anything because for me carrying a bearish position is
267.32s: kind of like betting against the success of a company, which I never really like that
271.16s: vibe.
272.16s: Unless it's Robin Hood, I'll fade the shit out of Robin Hood into the fucking dirt.
277.04s: That one I'm okay with.
278.04s: I will, yep, no problem.
279.96s: I will, I'll take a mortgage out on the house to take the capital out and then use that
286.00s: to fade Robin Hood.
287.56s: Like that's straight up.
288.80s: Don't care about that one.
289.80s: But most other companies, I prefer not to fade them.
292.36s: However, I'll trade anything in any direction if it's moving.
296.68s: That because again, like for me, I'm a trader.
300.16s: That's literally how I make a living is by trading.
303.28s: I need things to move.
304.28s: Otherwise, your boy can't get his cool little protein pouch thing and then I'll die.
310.00s: Right?
311.00s: That's kind of what it boils down to.
312.00s: And by the way, in case you were wondering, I did get an MRI last Friday, whoever built
317.12s: those tubes, I don't know what size human being they were planning on putting in those,
321.76s: but it's not like in a normal size and adult.
324.08s: But anyways, those are expensive.
325.88s: So with that, need to trade.
328.68s: Otherwise, there's no way to fit in the fucking MRIs.
332.00s: It's all a giant problem.
333.60s: So that is the way I think about markets we can absolutely talk about trading the movements
339.68s: in GameStop because that's one of the coolest things about the stock is that it moves
343.36s: all over the fucking place.
345.84s: And I traded it last week and I'll talk about some of those trades if we want because
350.60s: I mean, I still have my carry position in GameStop, but I started using options again,
358.56s: really short term because I've seen this movie before.
361.72s: I know and we'll take a look at it in a second.
364.32s: Let me finish saying hello to everybody.
365.68s: So Ricky bring that back up in a few minutes after I say hello to everybody and we'll
369.32s: get right into it.
371.20s: Chewie says everybody gives him, give him a thumbs up.
373.96s: I mean, it wouldn't hurt, right?
375.48s: It's kind of like it's a nice thing to do.
377.48s: I wouldn't blame you if you did it.
379.44s: I think it would be appropriate.
381.32s: Joe Tatos in the house, Marcus Trader says question, if I know the link of option, but
386.84s: overwhelming where to start over 60 strategies, any video where to start from, come on, big
393.40s: dog.
394.40s: You know I have a million videos.
397.12s: So I'm going to drop you two videos to playlists with a bunch of videos.
403.28s: So who's this for?
405.08s: Marcus.
406.08s: So Marcus, this first link is my options 101 playlist.
409.36s: So you can kind of poke through that.
410.80s: See what's applicable to you.
412.48s: And then the second one is my options 201 playlist, which kind of builds on some of
418.40s: the things adds a little bit of complexity to it.
421.92s: And then this playlist, this is a video I launched today about how I trade options,
427.52s: which I actually think is a really good synopsis specifically for your scenario.
432.40s: And then this last video is a options trading for beginners live stream.
439.24s: So this literally goes back.
441.28s: We've been doing this options trading for beginners thing every Friday.
445.32s: I think we just finished episode 13, right?
448.36s: So it's like three plus months that we've been doing a beginner session every single
452.72s: Friday.
453.52s: So that last playlist is essentially that.
456.08s: And the first couple of videos in that playlist is straight up for beginners.
459.84s: It is starting from the fucking basics and working all the way through how to place
463.76s: traits.
464.76s: And then the last few videos have been more so like practical application and stuff.
468.40s: So a bunch of resources in there for you.
471.24s: Absolutely, absolutely happy to help with that.
475.60s: Now the cliff notes version though for you, Marcus Trader is here's what I would tell
480.20s: anybody and let me grab this really quick, quick side note.
485.12s: This is more so just for options trading in general.
487.72s: But I think this is such an important message to get out to anybody interested in trading
491.48s: options.
492.48s: This is my giant ugly PowerPoint that I've been building forever.
496.84s: And I just kind of well, not forever.
498.20s: That's super dramatic.
499.20s: I've recently started building it.
500.40s: But this is what I think for any new options trader, this is the way to learn in my opinion.
507.56s: Start with defining a profit mechanism.
510.08s: Stock goes up, stock goes down.
512.56s: Volatility goes up, volatility goes down.
514.64s: Stock pays dividend.
516.32s: Stock gets added to S&P 500 and there's a litany of studies that display that there's
521.76s: typically drift over the next three months.
525.04s: There's a million things, profit mechanism first.
528.52s: Then we need to be able to define and measure said profit mechanism.
532.84s: Stock goes up, when does it go up?
535.36s: How can I tell if it's going to go up?
537.28s: How do I know how far it might go up?
539.76s: If it goes down, how far does it typically go down when I think it's going to go up?
543.08s: How long does it take?
544.44s: All of those details have to be ironed out.
547.36s: That's the idea of measuring.
549.16s: Then we fit options into the picture.
552.88s: So notice when I talk about this idea of learning options, the first two steps have nothing
557.56s: to do with options.
559.48s: Nothing to do with options.
560.48s: You don't inject options until step three and step four in my opinion.
566.48s: And it's because so many people start trading options kind of like this, right?
569.68s: You said that you know 60 strategies or you're familiar with 60 strategies.
573.64s: Technically there's unlimited strategies.
576.48s: Options are literally just a way to trade things.
580.20s: What you have to identify what you're trading first and be good at identifying what you're
585.40s: trading first.
586.40s: People blame options all the time for losing money.
588.64s: It's not the fucking options.
590.16s: Options are agnostic.
591.16s: They're not there to help you or hurt you.
593.08s: Options don't care.
594.36s: Options just do what options do.
596.16s: What probably is missing from the picture is these two steps because here's what I can
600.88s: tell you.
602.04s: If you're good at trading things directionally, let's say you're good technical analyst,
607.28s: you're good fundamental analyst, whatever it is.
609.32s: Nancy Pelosi, they're out here crushing it and they're doing mostly longer term trades
613.84s: with options for leverage.
616.16s: So they have the profit mechanism down which inside are trading.
620.28s: Who knows?
621.28s: I mean, it's all above board, right?
622.28s: I'm sure that they're good.
624.12s: Or maybe you know, fundamental analysis comes into the picture who really knows?
630.60s: Really jokes aside, the point being is even in their scenario, they're just using options
634.72s: to amplify the position.
636.32s: So if you don't have a solid method to trade something profitably, whatever that mechanism
642.88s: is, options don't magically fix it.
645.32s: They exacerbated.
647.24s: So they enhance what you're doing both if you're good at picking something to the right
651.68s: side or whatever your methodology is.
654.16s: These will amplify it.
655.56s: Hence roaring kitty.
656.96s: When I was going back through his all his previous options positions, when I was looking
660.44s: at his original trackers, he used to track stocks, equity positions and stocks, then
664.16s: he started layering in options.
666.04s: Why is that?
667.04s: Because they amplify this underlying tool that he's developed, which is profit mechanisms.
673.48s: So that is what I would recommend for anybody that's interested in learning about options,
680.36s: how to start learning about them is literally don't even fucking worry about options until
685.84s: there's something you can reliably with some degree of accuracy, identify and predict.
691.96s: If you do not have that, then these won't fix anything.
696.04s: They will just make it worse.
697.80s: So that is my point 02.
701.40s: Tanner says Saturday nights are UFC nights.
703.44s: So you usually have to watch these live streams after the fact, but I had to catch this one
707.08s: live after the recent Deavision Inn against yeah, for sure.
709.68s: And I mean, let's be honest, for the UFC live streams, you could probably skip the pre-lims
713.44s: and be okay.
714.44s: By the way, cheers.
715.72s: We got to get my first drug out of the way.
718.08s: We have them kind of phased out.
722.76s: I think that one I just took is to help with like broad inflammation or some shit.
727.60s: I don't know.
728.60s: Kind of like what I survive off of right now.
730.00s: I just got my MRI though.
731.16s: So we'll see what's up.
733.76s: So yeah, Tanner, skip the pre-lims dog.
736.56s: There's nothing in there.
737.56s: Damn says I have some jam.
739.76s: Jam.
740.76s: Jam 2 of 2025 45 covered calls.
744.84s: I think see expected more volume and volatility.
752.08s: How would you manage those?
753.68s: Sam, I'm not going to lie, dog.
756.12s: You just completely fucked me up.
759.00s: I'm aware that you have some I'm assuming Jan 2025 45 covered calls that I'm same page
765.52s: here.
767.32s: I can I think C can expect more volume and volatility.
774.08s: C can is GME.
776.20s: I think GME can expect C. But I don't understand how somebody would type in C like this and mean
782.72s: GME unless it's spell check.
784.84s: Maybe you're on your phone for the people that are watching the live streams.
789.20s: What device do you typically watch from?
791.04s: Is it like a phone, a laptop, a TV?
794.56s: I'm just trying to understand Sam and whether or not we need to call an ambulance for
798.64s: Sam.
799.64s: All right.
801.64s: All right.
802.64s: So Tanner's down the phone Vladimir iPad PC PC PlayStation 3 curveball didn't expect that.
808.80s: So a lot of people on the phone.
810.88s: Archduke PC.
812.52s: How do you have a name like Archduke PC?
816.56s: And that's confusing.
818.68s: Okay.
819.68s: So it's a lot of PC phones.
821.92s: Aviator Geek has me an iMacs theater.
824.08s: That's terrifying.
825.08s: Honestly, if I'm in an iMacs theater, you're going to have to I'm literally going to go
828.56s: to a faceless channel.
830.24s: I think the last thing anybody needs to see in anything like that is my fat freaking head.
836.48s: That yeah, that's terrifying.
838.44s: All right.
839.44s: So did Sam chime in?
840.44s: All right.
841.44s: So most people on the phone.
842.44s: Okay.
843.44s: So maybe.
844.44s: Maybe Sam is on the phone and we don't have to call an ambulance or not necessarily having
849.88s: a stroke.
851.88s: Um.
852.88s: Well, Sam, if you let me know if you reiterate what
860.08s: that is, just so I can understand better.
861.76s: Okay.
862.76s: Here we go.
863.76s: Sam is on the phone.
864.76s: Everybody, Sam's here.
865.76s: Don't worry.
866.76s: Sam is here.
867.76s: Sam says, sorry on the phone.
868.76s: I have GM 2025 covered calls.
870.00s: I don't know if to wait for the pop and roll up or buy now sell higher volume.
873.32s: Okay.
874.32s: So Sam, your boy needs a couple more details here.
877.04s: The first detail is I need to know what the basis is in the underlying.
880.64s: Again, assuming we're talking about GME.
882.80s: If it's not, that's fine.
883.80s: I just need to know what the basis is.
885.60s: The second thing I need to know is what you sold those calls for.
889.76s: I mean, both of those, I'll be able to at least try and help.
895.44s: That's the idea.
897.44s: Warring clitty says I'm in VR.
899.08s: Oh, God, that's even worse.
900.68s: I don't, man.
903.20s: I do not like looking at myself.
904.88s: So I cannot imagine like VR like right there.
908.76s: That's terrifying.
911.44s: Sam says I'm down 100% on the call.
914.04s: So that's okay.
915.04s: So Sam, appreciate the answer.
916.72s: I'm going to reiterate the question though, because they still need to know that.
920.32s: It's very helpful.
921.32s: Those details are important.
925.12s: Because we can look at some different ways to manage the position.
928.92s: So I need to know basis of the underlying and I need to know what we sold the short
935.20s: calls at.
936.20s: Okay.
937.20s: While Sam is hooking us up with that, Nick says I really should because I'm pretty good
944.28s: at picking them, watch every fight usually.
946.96s: Sports betting is the thing.
948.80s: Sports what I would, I don't really sports bet personally, but I do know quite a few
953.04s: options traders that are also sports bettors.
956.24s: You and Sinclair is not so much of a big sports bettor, but he likes it a lot.
960.88s: He just wrote a new book with some sort of well-known sports bettor from Twitter, X,
967.92s: whatever the platform's called now.
969.52s: So it's absolutely applicable because if you, sports betting is probabilities, right?
974.12s: There's a bookie assigning probabilities to different events.
976.52s: That's all it is.
977.52s: That's really funny because when I would bet sports with my friends, they would come up
980.44s: with these crazy ass parlays and I literally would just play the probabilities and crush
984.96s: most of them for a sporting event that I don't fucking know anything about.
989.36s: So if somebody's playing football and they're doing goal touch score units, I don't care
993.92s: at all.
994.92s: I'm just trying to play the probabilities.
997.20s: So yeah.
999.20s: All right.
1000.20s: So let's take a look now.
1001.88s: I think we can get, I think we can get started.
1005.12s: Okay.
1006.12s: So Sam hooked us up.
1007.12s: All right.
1008.12s: Sam said he sold him at 147.
1010.72s: Sam, you are, I think now you're starting to break my balls because I thought I've been
1015.64s: pretty clear with the details on the need.
1017.76s: I'll try again.
1019.36s: The details I need are what is the underlying value that you got in at the underlying.
1025.24s: So the covered call part got the call part, which is great.
1028.16s: And now need what we got into the underlying at.
1032.24s: That's the next part.
1033.08s: Those are two pieces of details I need underlying basis, short call basis.
1037.68s: We got the short call basis out of the way, which is fantastic news.
1041.60s: Now we need the underlying parts still.
1045.16s: I'm literally going to model your trade in here and then we can talk about it together
1048.92s: because I think it's a good exercise.
1053.76s: Sam says shit, sorry, I'm completely fucking with you.
1057.28s: There's nothing to be sorry about literally at all.
1059.24s: We're just, we're just poking some fun in just.
1064.96s: Perfect Sam.
1065.80s: And then the last question I'm throwing a curve ball here is for the basis that we got
1073.00s: in at how many shares are we talking about?
1076.28s: Do we have 100 shares against one call 200 shares against two calls or one call?
1083.40s: What does that look like?
1084.40s: Again, that's also going to influence what I would do.
1089.64s: Everybody we all know roaring titty just popped in.
1092.48s: So we have to give a giant shout out to roaring titty.
1095.80s: Roing titty and roaring clitty make my day and then Vladimir off Putin that I don't know
1101.00s: why, but that is just fucking hilarious to me.
1104.00s: Big fan of off Putin as well.
1108.44s: Having a great time 2000 shares nine call sold.
1111.00s: Okay, perfect.
1112.00s: So there's a really important lesson here.
1114.24s: So let's start with this.
1115.80s: We'll start with 2000 shares at 19 dollar.
1120.76s: And obviously that'll be an average basis I presume just going off of guessing.
1125.96s: And so here's what that would look like now.
1130.04s: And then we have nine of these 20.
1133.88s: Oh, don't, oh, there it is 17, Jan 25.
1139.16s: I think he said the 45s.
1142.52s: 45s 45s.
1144.36s: Yeah, so 25 45s.
1147.96s: These were sold originally for dollar 47, 147.
1158.72s: And let's analyze those.
1159.92s: We need nine of those.
1162.16s: So here's the trade as it was placed.
1164.96s: So here is roaring titty says, LOL, there's a roaring clitty.
1170.80s: And clitty says, yo, I don't know if we've ever been in the chat at the same time.
1174.16s: So I don't, this is a, this is a magical moment.
1177.00s: I think we all need to just revel in the chat for a second because roaring titty just meant
1181.96s: roaring clitty.
1183.68s: And I mean, to me that, that feels like fireworks of some sort like this.
1192.16s: That feels like a magical moment to me.
1194.00s: So I just want to celebrate that with you all that we now have roaring titty, roaring
1198.64s: clitty.
1199.64s: And they just met one another for the first time.
1201.40s: Fantastic.
1202.40s: Okay.
1205.72s: Now that that beautiful moment is a side.
1210.28s: Nick says, what if roaring kitty joined the chat with roaring clitty, roaring titty?
1214.44s: To be honest, to be honest, big fan of the cat and his work, love it, love D.F.E.
1222.40s: But I have to be honest, I still like the name roaring clitty and roaring titty more.
1226.88s: I'm just keeping it a buck.
1228.48s: It's like a roaring kitty, nothing but respect for him.
1231.48s: But I would like that name even, I just saw a simple Rick's chat which completely derailed
1242.76s: me, complete thought process.
1253.24s: Shout out to simple.
1258.08s: That's simple Rick.
1259.08s: I feel you brother.
1265.08s: Okay.
1266.64s: Okay.
1267.64s: Back to this.
1270.24s: So let's talk about a couple of really important concepts here.
1274.04s: First, what do you guys think about this ratio?
1277.36s: If we have 2000 long calls against nine short calls, what do you think?
1284.64s: What are your thoughts?
1285.64s: Bad like that, don't like that.
1287.88s: Would do something different.
1288.88s: Talk to me.
1289.88s: Sam says, tooth, did I not say 2000 shares?
1301.48s: My bad.
1302.48s: I have 2000 shares in there.
1304.08s: That might have just been a little bit dyslexia.
1307.28s: Give your boy a break.
1308.28s: I just got my entire, my entire brain just got derailed by a comment.
1313.12s: Come on man, fucking cut me some slack here.
1317.04s: But yeah, Sam, I got the 2000 shares at 19 and then I have the nine short calls 45 at
1322.68s: $1.47.
1323.68s: All right.
1324.68s: So let's talk about these quick.
1325.76s: The first thing, I love that it's essentially less than a two to one ratio.
1331.24s: This is good.
1332.52s: So the reason why this is good is because these short calls, there's nine of them which
1340.40s: can take up to 900 total shares.
1343.40s: So you notice how there's still upside potential in this trade.
1347.32s: So we're collecting a little bit of money upfront, but we have a lot of upward runway.
1353.76s: So that part, I like a lot.
1356.00s: Now here's the problem I see.
1360.28s: Even if GameStop goes above 45, then back down or above whatever GameStop does.
1366.84s: Doesn't really matter.
1368.44s: What matters in my opinion is that this is going to take forever.
1374.20s: We are now going to have to make sure that we hold at least 900 shares as long as this
1379.60s: short call is on, which is very likely to stay underwater for a large duration of the
1386.16s: trade before it starts showing a profit.
1388.92s: That is everything to do with the way that options behave.
1392.48s: If you look at the theta on these options, it's three cents a day.
1396.92s: So three dollars per day will come out of this and it will slow down as more of this
1402.88s: data comes out and there's less theta to come out of it if they stay far out of the
1407.40s: money.
1408.72s: So one of the things that I would think about if this were my trade, first of all, is
1414.40s: not selling those short calls that far out in time.
1417.68s: I personally would keep them within 60 DTE.
1422.20s: And the reason why I would keep them within 60 DTE, if we go to the handy dandy notebook,
1427.56s: the handy dandy outlier PowerPoint, doesn't sound as good as the handy dandy notebook.
1432.92s: You'll see theta decay starts to really accelerate within 60 days.
1437.72s: So with those being out, 132 days kind of out in this zone, they're just kind of losing
1444.52s: a little tiny bit each day in tying things up.
1448.76s: So that's just one note.
1450.44s: The other thing is because again, in this same scenario, if you do a shorter term trade,
1454.32s: you can cycle them faster and you will make way more money doing that than selling something
1459.60s: that that's that is that far out.
1461.84s: So just a general admin note.
1464.08s: Now in terms of the risk of these falling in the money, obviously there's a risk if
1468.92s: game stop goes above 45.
1470.96s: What I can tell you is at least in the near term, the probability of game stop going
1476.72s: above 45 and then staying there for an extended duration, it seems lower to me.
1482.16s: That doesn't mean game stop can't get there.
1484.44s: I think especially as we start to understand more about what Cohen or C is thinking about
1490.68s: doing with this poor Billy that they're sitting on, that will be really informative to
1495.56s: how they choose to transform the business.
1498.12s: But when I look at something like this, I think it's fine, but I think that this is just
1505.92s: going to tie up a lot of the trade unnecessarily.
1510.04s: That's my opinion.
1511.40s: So going back to the original question though, hold on.
1519.40s: There was a very specific question before we got into all these.
1522.48s: I don't know if I should wait for a pop and roll up or just buy now to sell later at
1527.08s: a higher premium or just buy some calls.
1530.08s: So Sam, in that context, what I can tell you is literally dude, you're talking about
1534.68s: completely different strategies, right?
1537.88s: The idea of buying a call versus selling a call in that context, they're completely different.
1543.20s: So my biggest recommendation there would be start by defining what you're trying to do.
1549.24s: That's what I would say because selling short calls versus buying calls in this scenario,
1553.16s: they're literally completely different.
1555.92s: So I would try to understand what the goal is and then make adjustments off of that personally.
1563.84s: That's what I'm thinking of.
1566.64s: So yeah, in this case, I wouldn't bother doing, well again, it's like for one, I wouldn't
1573.56s: put that trade on.
1574.88s: Two, if I put that trade on, the entire premise would be to just wait, to just leave those
1579.60s: sit until I can make money on them.
1582.44s: So the last thing I would do is sell them and then as soon as they're not making money,
1588.00s: buy them back for a loss.
1590.48s: Because then I've accomplished nothing other than losing money.
1593.44s: So obviously this isn't to point fun or anything.
1596.36s: It's to try to talk about the way that I would conceive of a position like this so that
1602.36s: it makes sense because you have to know at the onset of the position that this is going
1607.08s: to show a loss for the overwhelming majority of the life cycle of this trade, just how
1612.48s: she goes.
1614.36s: So yeah.
1615.36s: All right.
1618.36s: Let's talk about what happened this weekend.
1623.84s: By this weekend, obviously I mean yesterday.
1627.68s: Don't know why I said this weekend, I was kind of stupid, sorry.
1631.44s: Why happened yesterday?
1633.04s: Well, Roryn Kitty comes alive and he drops this.
1637.96s: Ha, drops.
1639.84s: I didn't even mean to do that, but it fits so well.
1642.92s: He drops this.
1644.68s: So here's the funny thing that happened with this.
1651.84s: When I first, before I saw this come up, this was posted right at 0900 Pacific time,
1660.20s: right when this came up.
1662.76s: Before this, I got hit on a few alerts in GameStop.
1667.40s: I actually placed the trade based on those alerts because I expected something to happen.
1673.48s: It didn't play out precisely as I anticipated, but it wasn't that far different from what
1678.64s: I anticipated.
1679.92s: This is one of those rare kind of scenarios where I did something and I wasn't completely
1684.44s: wrong within the first three seconds of doing what I did.
1688.16s: You got to really relish in those moments because the vast majority of the time, the
1693.40s: at least for me, the stock market finds a way to just perpetually make me wrong, which
1698.16s: I really appreciate what the stock market is trying to do.
1700.68s: It's trying to build me some character, I suppose, but I feel like I have enough of that
1704.64s: at this point.
1705.64s: Also a giant shout out to the apes.
1708.40s: There's 140 people hanging out right now, getting ready to dive into the background of
1713.92s: Roryn Kitty.
1714.92s: Shout out to you guys.
1715.92s: Absolutely stoked to go down this path with everybody.
1723.48s: Generational Campbell says, what alerts do you use?
1726.60s: I use a bunch of different scans.
1729.08s: I use a few different platforms to help me identify abnormal movement.
1734.72s: One of them is this.
1738.72s: I'll use this is the homepage that I use for this.
1743.20s: It essentially lets me identify things that are moving a lot and then it identifies
1748.04s: unusual options activity, essentially real time.
1751.80s: That's one of the primary things that I will keep an eyeball on.
1754.96s: What I do is I add filters to look at specific stocks because otherwise if you don't do that,
1761.40s: you'll get a bunch of stuff like this, like Apple.
1764.36s: They're using unusual options essentially to look at big trades and whatnot, but it's
1768.52s: like Apple in video like this.
1771.16s: You'll see these on the board all the time because they're massive.
1775.20s: They're going to move all the time.
1777.68s: To me, that's actually kind of just noise.
1780.36s: I create filters so that I can see the stuff that I want to see.
1784.56s: The other thing that I do is I scan through Thinkorswim the platform itself so that I can
1790.64s: have a clearer sense of what's popping up, what's moving.
1795.20s: That's essentially how I see it.
1796.36s: I'm looking for expansion in individual contracts.
1799.24s: I'm looking for large trades.
1801.20s: I'm looking for persistent trades that add up to a big value, those kinds of things.
1810.88s: That's like the general concept behind what I try to do.
1815.12s: Again, I can show you in here what that might look like.
1818.16s: It obviously won't look like much in here because the market's closed.
1821.64s: If we drop in here, I can look for stuff that's looking for the options itself that they've
1827.84s: increased at least x%.
1830.12s: This is the volume for the specific strike price.
1835.36s: And 50% is still way too low.
1837.32s: Normally, I'll do like 100, 150, 200 as a minimum.
1841.92s: And again, I don't know.
1843.16s: Yes, so there will be a bunch of like and you'll notice that like there's millions of
1846.00s: returns.
1847.08s: So for something to grow by 100%, isn't actually a ton.
1851.32s: So what I'll do in this context is a look for stuff that has at least a certain amount
1856.44s: of downside volume.
1858.68s: And then I'll look at volume counts on the day.
1862.28s: And I'll say, okay, well, clearly something strange is going on in AG.
1867.40s: What's going on?
1868.40s: I have no idea.
1869.60s: But what I can tell you is that the one day relative volume in it is absurd.
1875.12s: One's going on.
1876.12s: So then I go look.
1877.44s: That's kind of the idea.
1878.76s: I just go through and I look for ideas following that kind of path.
1885.28s: So then that's how I catch the initial trade.
1889.36s: And if we come in here, we can take a look at that initial trade together.
1896.20s: Let's take a look at the last week in total just because I think it paints a clear picture.
1902.76s: And then let me get rid of this.
1905.64s: So for GameStop, as you all know, I literally do a daily video and I look at GameStop every
1912.12s: day.
1913.12s: And in my daily video, I don't always cover GameStop, but at least for the last like three months,
1919.96s: I almost always cover GameStop.
1922.20s: At least a little bit.
1923.60s: Part of it is just because I feel a level of commitment to you all.
1926.60s: Like I've said this a million times.
1928.28s: Once I start doing something, I continue doing it.
1932.36s: And I don't want anybody to feel like I'm bailing.
1934.52s: Now if there's a video without GameStop, it's not obviously that I'm bailing covering
1938.04s: it.
1939.04s: It's just that sometimes it's just not doing a whole lot.
1941.36s: And I'm kind of focusing the time elsewhere.
1943.92s: Also cheers next round of drugs.
1945.88s: This is the drug time of day.
1947.20s: I have like three periods where I got to take a bunch of drugs.
1950.32s: Next down the hatch.
1954.32s: Hey, there she goes.
1959.36s: So I got alerted for these yesterday.
1965.96s: And essentially at 842, 0842, this is Pacific time.
1973.60s: 842, 37 and 38.
1976.04s: I see these two trades come through.
1980.40s: And I see these two trades coming up to be a pretty significant sum of money.
1989.32s: They were bought right around where GameStop was trading.
1994.84s: So if we take a look, I'll slide this over here, I guess.
1998.96s: Yeah, this is fine.
2000.60s: This is a daily five minute chart.
2004.96s: So this is looking at the specific day.
2007.20s: So if we go to 0840 and 45 in here, you can see where GameStop is trading.
2017.16s: And realize that you can't because that's in the way.
2019.72s: So it's trading right around at the money.
2021.52s: So those 22 and a half were like literally right at the money, which makes sense.
2027.00s: That's not outside of what I've seen the cat do previously.
2030.80s: Seems completely, completely in line.
2032.88s: He typically seems to go a little further out of the money.
2036.20s: Now all of this is predicated on this trade coming through, which is really interesting.
2043.84s: There is absolutely nothing that directly ties him to this.
2050.56s: Because in terms of strike selection, I think it's weird that it was 22 and a half.
2055.84s: I haven't seen him use those kind of strikes before the have strikes.
2059.60s: The other thing is this was a really short dated option.
2063.00s: This was expiring in 13 step.
2066.48s: That's also really weird to me.
2068.36s: And that's part of the goal for today's session is to go back through all of his old
2072.20s: trades to see if what I think is weird is actually weird.
2077.32s: Because again, my goal in looking at this stuff is to share some of the analysis skill set
2084.72s: that I've built over the last 16 plus years of trading.
2088.68s: So what that means is I have ideas.
2090.80s: I have hunches on what may or may not have happened.
2093.64s: It's kind of swirling around the back of my head.
2096.16s: But I don't just take those at face value.
2098.32s: I force myself to validate things.
2101.00s: So let's actually part of the session today is to go back and validate some of these
2106.24s: things.
2107.24s: Because to me, that's strange.
2109.00s: The amount of money that has the cat written all over it.
2111.96s: No doubt the size of these trades in terms of lots also has the cat written all over it.
2117.16s: This expiration does not have the cat written all over it.
2120.32s: This strike selection does not have the cat written all over it.
2123.88s: These just don't make a lot of sense to me.
2127.12s: So this happens at 0 842 37 38 again Pacific time.
2132.88s: Then if we take a look, this comes out at 0 900.
2138.52s: So this is what I infer from these.
2142.52s: And again, I don't think I need the tin foil hat just yet.
2146.64s: Because when I look at this, I see this obviously is talking about the dog stock.
2153.40s: And I think if I'm not mistaken that 13G, let me find that one second.
2158.16s: Keith, 13G filing, chewy.
2164.64s: Yep.
2167.64s: Here.
2170.88s: So there's one important note to keep in mind here is as we look at when these tweets
2177.80s: come out, there's some sort of correlation in terms of time.
2184.20s: So this came out 10 a.m. flat.
2186.32s: This also came out on June 27th.
2188.76s: Now from the SEC filing, this tells me that he crossed the 5% ownership threshold on
2195.76s: June 24th, crossed the threshold.
2198.92s: The reason why I emphasize that part crossed is because you don't have to file this until
2206.32s: you cross that 5% threshold.
2208.76s: So he technically could have been building a position leading into this and the way that
2215.68s: we would deduce from that is like, okay, June 13th, he had this sometime between 13 June
2225.04s: and 24 June, this happened.
2230.80s: It's not a giant window.
2232.36s: You can kind of see when that happens.
2233.96s: You can even see it when we look at chewy and we analyze the stock.
2241.48s: And again, I don't know with certainty, but what I do know that if I go to 24 June, I
2247.44s: see a massive, recent, outsized bybar, 78% by volume with total volume coming in at 23.7
2259.56s: mill, where the 20 day average was 14 mill and the 5 day average was 16.6.
2265.00s: It's a pretty big deviation.
2267.88s: Would not surprise me in the least if he bought all of that here.
2272.72s: Wouldn't surprise me in the least, not guaranteed, but it wouldn't surprise me.
2276.88s: Now my thought is when he posts this, this is obviously after he already bought the
2284.44s: dog stock.
2285.84s: He was in Chewy in some capacity, what he did with his GME shares.
2291.24s: Nobody knows.
2292.96s: Based on basic math, I know unless he took in money from another account, which again,
2299.24s: pure conjecture, no idea.
2300.76s: Almost going to have to get the tinfoil hat soon because we're getting close.
2303.24s: But I still think this is a very reasonable thought pattern to follow is he would have
2308.96s: had to sell some of this position.
2313.44s: Is he at 268 million total with just 6.3 million in cash?
2318.40s: When I look at this trade, that again is likely to have occurred in my opinion on 24 June
2324.36s: looking at the chart.
2326.00s: If we give him even a favorable entry on 24 June, something around like mid price lower
2332.16s: mid, which again is probably not the case.
2335.04s: 26 was the price.
2337.24s: So we have 9 million 1000 shares, 9 million 1000 shares times 26.
2344.28s: He needs 234 million dollars.
2347.16s: 234 million dollars got to come from somewhere.
2351.32s: In this account, I see 268, he has enough.
2354.32s: He does not have enough in cash.
2356.36s: So the theory in my opinion, and I think it's time for the tinfoil hat.
2368.24s: We'll see how long I can keep this on for because it's pretty damn hot in California
2373.84s: right now.
2374.84s: I do have the air going, but not only do I think that it's a sick costume, but I also just
2381.24s: think it's important for people to know when I'm like straight up speculating, which this
2386.96s: is now getting into speculation.
2389.16s: So in my opinion, the probability that he has another 200 million dollars just sitting
2400.24s: in another account that he wouldn't have started with in this when he came back, I find
2406.20s: that to be unlikely.
2407.36s: I just find it to be highly unlikely.
2410.44s: So could it have happened?
2412.48s: Absolutely.
2413.72s: I just would think it would be an unlikely scenario personally.
2418.24s: So then that leads me to believe that the higher probability scenario is unwinding all
2425.64s: if not the majority of this position to free up the cash to then move into dog stock.
2432.76s: The main thing I see here, I think there's everybody's eyeing in on like which way the
2437.72s: eyeballs are facing.
2441.68s: And to me, I don't know.
2443.52s: I think it's a shout out to the Kansas City shuffle thing, but my main takeaway is I
2449.84s: just see green here, which is very typical for buying.
2455.00s: And then I see red here, just very typical for selling.
2459.68s: So whether or not there's something weird on his holster like with that little logo,
2464.20s: I have no idea.
2465.20s: I don't even know what that is.
2466.48s: I think other people probably will know what this is, but that's the main thing I see
2472.36s: is eyeballs green eyeballs read by cell.
2477.40s: So this leads me to believe it's likely that he unwound all if not some of his chewy position.
2487.32s: That's my guess.
2488.32s: He's putting the dog down in this case, putting the toy down, putting the dog down, red cell,
2493.12s: green by now.
2495.56s: The interesting part here is this was a like not right after which I find fascinating,
2503.92s: right?
2504.92s: Because we can see based on the filing, it was 24 June that he crossed the threshold.
2508.84s: He waited two days to post this.
2511.76s: Whereas in this, he posted it again, if this is him, which we don't know, if this is him,
2519.36s: which we don't know, he would have posted it like 15 minutes after he got in.
2524.76s: So now the other thing that again, this is like straight tin foil.
2530.52s: I need to bring this on my head a little bit more.
2534.36s: So by seating this on the head more, the one thing I remember from this movie is that
2540.12s: when he put this, this toy away, he was moving on the Buzz Lightyear like the new or fun toy,
2547.32s: but he went back to Woody.
2550.24s: I personally don't think that's what he means by this.
2554.12s: But that would be a thing, right?
2556.36s: Putting the dog toy away with some sort of expectation to go back to it because Andy,
2560.64s: I think that's this little bastard's name goes back to Woody later in the movie.
2565.88s: So I have no idea.
2567.92s: But anyways, all right, let me get to the chat.
2569.60s: I see you guys are going off here.
2570.80s: Let me see.
2573.04s: Sneyhill says this name should be taken only at face value.
2576.40s: I agree.
2577.40s: I completely agree.
2578.24s: I think that in my opinion, this is just saying, bought, sold, that's what I see.
2585.16s: So yeah, completely agree.
2587.88s: All right.
2591.88s: What were we at?
2596.28s: CDJ says his name about you were billionaire.
2598.60s: He had money and more.
2599.80s: No, I think you saw him in his primary account.
2602.12s: His primary account literally almost had that.
2604.56s: Yeah, I forgot.
2607.12s: There was a point that he shared on the stream.
2609.68s: Like he was right at billionaire.
2613.44s: So yeah, I think I think he was just referring to his account.
2618.16s: But now when it comes to him having other accounts, I'm sure he has other accounts.
2622.08s: How much money he has in those, I have no idea.
2624.36s: But I don't think like to me, I don't think there's a good explanation as to why he would
2630.60s: come back here.
2633.00s: If only, again, we're talking insane world now, but only 210 million, if he has another
2641.20s: 200 million that he's wanting to trade with, he would, I would just, I would bet dollars
2647.32s: to donuts.
2648.56s: He would come back with all of it.
2649.92s: I see no reason why he would only come back with this if he was expecting to trade
2654.32s: with more.
2655.32s: I just don't see it.
2656.72s: So could it be absolutely, but I just don't, I just don't see it personally.
2662.56s: It's not a bad thesis though, it could be.
2670.40s: Ricky says for us non apes, how do you think the best way to trade the downside of GME is
2675.36s: after big run up, think about buying puts if it goes up a crazy, yeah.
2679.00s: So with something like that, you're kind of damned if you do, damned if you don't,
2682.94s: if you buy puts, it will work.
2685.08s: That's the way that I would do it.
2687.20s: But they're going to be way expensive and you have to be really thoughtful about the
2691.88s: way that you buy the puts.
2693.80s: So for those kinds of things, I would go a little further out in time.
2697.40s: That's the way I do it typically, like at least greater than 60 days on the long options.
2701.84s: And then I go like at if not in the money for something like GameStop at the money is
2706.16s: typically plenty because it'll cascade.
2708.52s: So yeah, that's like the high level overview.
2712.92s: Roryne Titty says we don't know if Chuy was in its own account.
2718.52s: All we know is the filing happened.
2719.84s: He didn't show his port with Chuy.
2722.36s: I again, I would think he uses account because it's the reason why I think he uses account
2728.64s: is because he says this.
2737.48s: Like we've we've listened to this before together quite a few times.
2741.16s: But in this section and I'm just highlighting it to you because we don't have to listen
2744.60s: to it now.
2746.12s: Let me share like the specific star point here.
2749.20s: Here you go.
2751.24s: So from this star point, he says this is his only account like that he explicitly says
2756.72s: that.
2757.72s: I believe him.
2759.36s: I like I don't think he would lie about that.
2762.36s: So I believe him that this is his only account.
2767.64s: So could he have another portfolio that he's trading and he could.
2772.72s: But I believe this Zachary says his wife's IRA.
2780.08s: Yeah, the problem is is that there's no way to get that amount of money in the IRA.
2787.44s: The yeah, I don't see that.
2791.44s: Hot nitrogen says he said it's his only position was we count cash as a position to.
2795.92s: Yeah, the reason why he said count cash as a position to is he he hovered over the
2800.88s: cash and is account as he said that.
2803.08s: He says it depends on your position.
2804.52s: But he was like explicitly calling out this cash because some people would say, well,
2809.04s: cash is a position and he's trying to the point in my opinion that he's trying to make
2812.88s: is that this is the only thing he's holding.
2815.00s: So that's why he makes the point to call that out.
2823.28s: Zachary says I mean he started at 53.
2825.12s: He did.
2826.12s: But the other thing that again, as I was going through some of his background in terms
2829.84s: of like his start, which we have to I don't know if there's a way to like save this down
2834.88s: part instead of having to do this each time.
2836.76s: I haven't figured that out.
2838.04s: Any smart people know how to do this instead of having to like drag this bar down each
2842.76s: time, which is super annoying.
2845.64s: I haven't figured that out.
2847.76s: But anyways, he started with this, but I the way that he grew his money is literally
2857.32s: through YOLO's and it looks like he started down here again.
2859.88s: I don't know what he had from the get go just from like the first position that he posted
2863.68s: here with like 113,000 is what I see.
2870.96s: Roaring Titty says up and down arrows.
2872.96s: Roaring Titty, well, I already told you you could do no wrong.
2876.68s: So normally I would have jousted back there, but yeah, like the page down doesn't work.
2883.12s: You have to it just takes me to the bottom of it.
2887.44s: Brad says for the sake of the discussion at this point, how about we assume this was
2890.76s: his only account being come back to it?
2892.16s: Yeah, well, and I mean, really there's nothing else to cover there, right?
2895.32s: It's just everybody will have their opinion rightfully so on like what they think may or
2899.08s: may not have been there.
2900.84s: And we we won't know what it is.
2904.16s: Like we just unless he chooses to share or tell us what you get in my opinion, he did that
2911.16s: when he talked about it on that live stream, but I mean, who knows that's that is the
2916.76s: that is the straight up part.
2917.68s: Nobody will know.
2918.92s: All right.
2919.92s: Oh, gotta take this off for a few minutes.
2923.88s: In case you guys are wondering aluminum foil is not like a really breathable material
2930.64s: and your boy runs hot real hot.
2933.68s: So okay.
2939.08s: That Lawrence is sorry, did you say how much he would have made on Chewie calls?
2942.92s: I didn't because I've seen nothing.
2945.72s: I've seen nothing that indicates that he bought Chewie calls like I haven't seen that anywhere.
2951.28s: The only thing that I see is this which can be options, but I looked through and we did
2959.04s: this actually when I did one of the live streams with Newton, we looked through we comb
2963.48s: through all of the Chewie options trades leading into this and I just I don't see it.
2969.04s: So I don't I don't I haven't seen anything.
2976.40s: I know a lot of people were immediately assuming that he had options positions so that he
2980.00s: was trading options, which is fair.
2981.36s: He does that a lot, but I didn't see anything in here that led me to believe that there's
2987.60s: an options position.
2990.04s: Sneheal says I'm pretty sure there was some 5K blocks around the 24th.
2993.76s: Let's take a quick look.
2994.76s: I mean, we'll get to the bottom of it right now.
2996.88s: The HWI and then you're telling me around June 24th.
3003.28s: I mean, we can look at the whole period between his updates, right?
3008.84s: What is it June?
3009.84s: Is that right?
3010.84s: Let me find his thing.
3012.16s: Fuck, I don't want to scroll up.
3013.68s: Hold on, let me grab another version of this.
3016.08s: Stand by.
3018.08s: Okay.
3020.08s: Okay.
3021.08s: Yeah, this will be like our up top version.
3028.76s: So June 13th was the last.
3030.48s: So then we can start after June 13th.
3032.80s: We've done this exact exercise before.
3034.52s: So go June 13th until the 24th, which was the date that it happened.
3041.44s: We'll look at just the calls and then we'll look at just call buys.
3046.36s: And I see the 30s come through in two blocks for 19 July.
3056.12s: So it's not that because he just posted the picture of dog stock.
3062.92s: And this doesn't equate to that size of a position.
3065.48s: Let's do the math.
3066.80s: So he has 10,000 at 30 is the basis.
3073.52s: $300,000.
3078.20s: So this represents 10,000, obviously times 100.
3083.24s: Yeah.
3087.48s: It's only a million shares.
3091.20s: This shows me nine.
3093.48s: Nine million.
3095.44s: It's like, it's not even close.
3098.16s: So we did this exercise again with new knots who long ago were like, I looked at each
3106.40s: day because there was another theory that Newton had that maybe he just traded enough options
3112.84s: in order to essentially double his account in that time frame.
3115.72s: And again, like, you could tell by the way I'm framing that, I just think that that's
3119.24s: like insanely improbable, but who knows.
3122.28s: So we looked at it and I took it seriously when we were looking at it.
3125.88s: And yeah, I don't see that happening either.
3129.00s: So again, just using like simplest explanations here, I think that that's kind of one of
3135.28s: the important things to do with these is use the simpler explanations and the simpler
3140.44s: explanations is when this happened, he probably unwound his game stop position all if not
3147.20s: some, if not all.
3150.04s: And then here it looks like he's unwinding the chewy position.
3153.88s: Again, my guess is it probably didn't happen on the sixth because there was a delay between
3159.36s: these.
3161.60s: Roryntady says, if you own 6.6 of chewy nine million shares, one of me shares isn't
3166.16s: a small amount.
3167.16s: No, no, no, it's not small at all.
3168.16s: It's just not the nine million shares.
3169.52s: She's not even close.
3173.16s: And he says, did you research further dates back just in case you built a position before
3176.80s: in it?
3177.80s: No, I didn't because again, we don't have to because he told me this is his only account.
3182.24s: So the last date that he provided an update is 13 June in this account.
3188.00s: So yeah, I think the theory of him trading this in his wife's account coming up with nine
3195.24s: million, it's $200 million.
3198.72s: I genuinely so there's a way that you can do.
3202.00s: It's called a mega back door Roth IRA conversion or an IRA conversion, but you run out of the
3210.28s: ability to pile money into the product or into the account.
3213.72s: If it's a standard IRA, I guess he could funnel more into it, but I just, yeah, I would
3219.24s: struggle to see that as the case here.
3225.24s: Rowing Titty says at the beginning of the stream, he said accounts plural about 12 minutes
3229.28s: in.
3230.28s: Yeah, Rowing Titty, if you can grab me the exact time spot in there, I'm happy to play
3234.76s: it.
3235.76s: Again, I'm just going off with what he told me like in this, he says this is his only account
3239.56s: with his only positions.
3241.24s: So in the beginning, my guess is if he said the word accounts, he probably was using it
3245.44s: just in a conversational phrase.
3248.00s: Whereas this he's explicitly talking about the accounts that he's trading again, in my
3251.68s: opinion.
3252.68s: So yeah, he could have other accounts.
3254.68s: There's no doubt, but if there's another account, it would require essentially another
3260.40s: $200 million, which again, as good as Rowing Kitty, that is, that's double the amount of
3265.68s: money that's in this account two times that amount of money.
3269.72s: This amount of money took him obviously some time to build.
3273.04s: He could obviously compound pretty quickly here, but it's just a ton, a ton of money.
3279.32s: So yeah, I always will acknowledge that we don't know, and it could be.
3286.28s: But again, I think the way that I try to analyze it is follow the highest probability paths
3293.32s: as I can.
3294.48s: That's the way I think about analyzing it.
3296.96s: So yeah, this is what I'm thinking about it.
3302.60s: Brad says what his GME ownership show up in a Bloomberg terminal because other individual
3306.60s: positions do and he hasn't been on it.
3308.56s: But no, it depends on so on a Bloomberg terminal, it limits the kind of entities that show
3313.68s: up.
3314.68s: Like everybody doesn't get to see your position on Bloomberg.
3317.04s: Otherwise, nobody would use a Bloomberg terminal.
3319.32s: That's like given away your hands.
3322.44s: So whatever you're seeing in terms of other people's positions, you're seeing like reported
3326.76s: positions in terms of required filings, but it's not like showing a real time tap into
3332.64s: his portfolio.
3333.64s: Literally nobody would use a Bloomberg terminal, which is crazy.
3337.24s: Yeah.
3340.40s: So anyways, back to this because I do think it's important to talk about.
3346.44s: And I talked a little bit about this in the video from yesterday.
3353.72s: I get confused with the videos because I do a lot of videos.
3357.68s: Oh, let's say the seventh.
3360.60s: So we'll just do this week again.
3364.20s: So here, I'm going to grab both sides.
3371.00s: I, this confounds me.
3375.12s: This absolutely confounds me.
3379.24s: I do not know what happened here.
3382.24s: Now I'm going to walk you through the basic analysis based on again following the simplest
3393.44s: explanation first.
3396.00s: Somebody don't know who bought these at 0842.
3403.40s: Somebody looks to have sold about a half hour later, the same position.
3413.64s: So this looks like somebody bought here, held for 20, 30 minutes and then sold here.
3421.60s: CDJ says those trades were done on the floor.
3423.84s: What does that mean?
3425.16s: Like walk me through what you think that means.
3427.28s: I've seen that circulate a little bit.
3430.76s: And I'm trying to understand what people think that means because the floor is probably
3437.32s: being misused.
3438.32s: I would guess because it actually doesn't make sense.
3441.32s: So yeah, talk me through what you think because what I've kind of heard people saying is
3445.84s: that they're thinking that this is like the market makers, which for those that don't
3451.60s: know they wouldn't be on the floor.
3454.12s: In this case for this kind of position likely, this would be a quantitative position.
3458.68s: But a bunch of well, first let me ask.
3462.68s: And before I start going down that example, there's a flag reference to the designation while
3472.68s: hanging on the floor with your laptop.
3479.56s: On the stock exchange floor is what I read.
3481.16s: Yeah, but what does that mean?
3482.76s: I need to know what that mean again, and it's really dangerous, right?
3485.44s: So CDJ, do you notice what you said in the beginning?
3488.24s: You said it like definitively.
3490.40s: Those trades were done on the floor.
3492.40s: And then here you're just saying that you read it somewhere.
3494.44s: And again, I'm not picking on you, but I'm just saying like when we're trying to follow
3498.40s: a logical process, it's so important to try.
3502.16s: And like if there's data that says that somewhere up, I'm obviously open to it.
3507.48s: But like, yeah, Jonathan says, look farther right.
3513.24s: Okay.
3516.24s: And what?
3519.72s: Okay, so this makes a ton of sense then.
3526.48s: So this trade here, which is this purchase was done on the floor.
3536.96s: So do we know what that means?
3539.48s: That's what this one that's flagged that, the 6399.
3542.92s: Brad says that's the theory.
3545.48s: How do you get a laptop from that?
3547.24s: The theory you're referencing, DFC walked in the Boston Exchange itself, that's funny.
3553.32s: Ben Price says, I'm against somebody read him and traded the event.
3556.80s: I mean, I open a long Jimmy position when I saw it, should we sail volume speculation
3562.24s: was that it was placed from the floor of a stock exchange from the pits.
3565.04s: Not sure if that would make a logical for it to be the cat or more likely than not.
3569.56s: The flag was on you.
3570.96s: Yeah.
3571.96s: Okay.
3572.96s: I, yeah.
3576.40s: I think that that's unlikely for a lot of reasons.
3580.16s: The primary reason why I think that's unlikely is because my guess is this trade went to
3586.04s: the floor because of the size.
3588.20s: I think that's where they processed it.
3590.40s: I don't think I have to double check.
3592.08s: I don't want to speak out of term.
3593.24s: Let's actually see what that means.
3595.48s: I'll look it up just so that we can learn together.
3600.04s: Okay.
3601.52s: So on the unusual Wales platform, when a transaction is labeled as floor, what does that
3614.64s: mean?
3617.88s: References that are executed on the trading floor of an exchange as opposed to being done
3622.40s: through an automated system electronically.
3624.96s: These trades are often negotiated manually by traders on the floor involving large institutional
3631.20s: order blocks of trades.
3632.96s: So this, the fact, and that's exactly what I expected it to be, but I just didn't want
3638.28s: to go off have cocked.
3640.36s: So in this case, my guess is this was a big trade that was being routed.
3649.24s: And that's how they chose to execute the block trade.
3652.12s: So all I'm saying is, could this be another entity?
3655.00s: Absolutely.
3656.00s: This could be anybody.
3657.00s: We don't know who it is.
3658.00s: Could this be roaring kitty?
3659.00s: Absolutely.
3660.00s: The fact that it was executed on the floor doesn't mean that it's not a retail trader.
3666.44s: This one was 200, 200 lots that came through on the floor.
3671.72s: Like you'll find floor on a lot of these.
3675.44s: So bigger orders typically so that you don't, because the process of trying to fill this
3680.92s: kind of order at once would push the price pretty meaningfully.
3685.20s: So my guess is they probably were going to fulfill a large order through broker.
3689.76s: They call the broker and say, hey, I have a big, again, a retail trader can do this.
3693.20s: I have a big order that's going to come through.
3694.96s: I want to buy X, Y or Z.
3697.44s: And then at that point, the broker can say, okay, let me connect you with the floor or
3702.48s: the broker can say, I'll talk to the floor and see what they can do.
3705.00s: What size they can accommodate.
3706.84s: Because when we look at resting orders, we can see the depth.
3715.56s: So if I get rid of these examples and we take a look.
3718.56s: So if we take a look, you see this column that's called size.
3722.44s: This tells me what is offered at this point.
3727.88s: So here, if I, I would love for it to pop up.
3735.64s: Man, I don't want to unscrunch it.
3737.64s: There it goes.
3738.64s: So here on this one, you'll see that it's essentially bid for 509 at this price to a
3746.76s: one.
3747.76s: And then it's offered to 29 for 230 lots.
3753.68s: So when you have a really big order that you have to fill like 6,000 contracts and you
3759.80s: don't want to get chewed up on the like on moving the market yourself.
3764.44s: Because a big difference between this and the previous stuff we've seen.
3767.52s: Again, if this is Roryn Kitty, this is under that big assumption bubble of if, if it's
3772.88s: Roryn Kitty.
3774.16s: And we've seen this behavior before.
3775.88s: It's establishing a position similar to the size over a period of time.
3781.28s: This was done in a couple minutes, it's single day, literally within seconds of one
3785.72s: another.
3786.72s: So in order to fulfill that kind of position, that's my guess.
3790.12s: My guess is they chose to split up the order.
3793.52s: And I think that's why it's flagged that way.
3795.96s: So here's what we can conclude objectively from this.
3801.68s: We don't know who it was.
3803.64s: We know that one of them was executed on the floor and it wouldn't surprise me at all
3809.04s: if these were again discussed in tandem.
3812.44s: And it wouldn't surprise me at all if the broker says, okay, you can launch this order
3816.48s: for 3660 from whatever.
3818.56s: And then you'll send the rest 6399, whatever the size, desired size is through the floor
3825.52s: and they'll take the trade.
3828.28s: That's one other thing we can conclude from this.
3833.24s: The other thing we can conclude is we don't know that this is the same as this.
3840.44s: We don't know.
3842.04s: It seems overwhelmingly likely to be the case, but we don't know.
3848.00s: Now the slightly ugly part here is if, cat back on, if this was the cat and if he
3861.60s: bought in here, then if he posted this at 0.9, we know that we're in Kitty absolutely
3872.48s: would know posting this is going to move GameStop.
3874.92s: There's no way he doesn't know that.
3876.60s: He knows that.
3878.32s: So it looks like places trade post that on X sell the trade into the volume.
3887.72s: That's what it looks like.
3889.20s: I don't think that's what happened, not for a second, not for a lot of reasons.
3894.04s: First reason, this is a lot of money.
3898.24s: This is peanuts compared to what I've seen him hold during this live stream down $225
3906.88s: million.
3909.40s: Doesn't give a fuck.
3912.96s: This is peanuts for this dude.
3916.52s: I cannot see him in any way, shape or form.
3921.64s: One, thinking this is a good idea in terms of regulation.
3926.28s: He would overwhelmingly have to expect that he would get caught for this.
3931.40s: Two, what a trivial amount of money for this dude.
3936.80s: We're talking tens of thousands of dollars here.
3940.52s: Maybe a few hundred thousand dollars here.
3943.88s: I just do, I just don't see it.
3946.28s: I just don't see it.
3948.60s: So could it be, it could, but my guess is if that happened, it would have happened for
3955.48s: a reason completely different than to try to make a few hundred thousand dollars here.
3961.48s: That's my opinion.
3962.48s: If he did it, if this is him, if the sale is him, which those are all ifs, we have no
3967.96s: idea.
3969.44s: If any of that is the case, my best guess is that it would have been done for some other
3976.12s: reason, which I really don't know what it is.
3981.20s: But what I can tell you is that from a monetary motivation, I do not think he could have cared
3988.88s: less about this kind of movement.
3991.56s: I just don't think he could possibly care less.
3995.20s: So that's why if this was him, I assume it's for another reason.
4002.00s: And that's why I highly, highly, highly question what this all is because it's really hard
4008.28s: to tell because if you think about this, all of this is from the origin of just this,
4015.92s: which this doesn't even mean that he moved into GameStop.
4019.96s: And again, the other thing I want to remind people is that when he posted this on 27 June,
4025.80s: he made the trade into Chewy several days before.
4032.30s: So this would be a departure from that where he apparently would have exited dog stock
4039.16s: whenever maybe this was lagging a certain amount of time and then transition into GameStop
4044.92s: right after he post this.
4047.00s: I think that would be weird.
4048.60s: I think that would be real, real weird.
4051.44s: So when I look at this, I am the one thing I feel fairly confident in is that he bought
4061.68s: Chewy and this was him telling us and I think this is him saying he sold Chewy.
4066.20s: That's what I think here.
4067.80s: Now with respect to this, I literally have no idea.
4072.36s: I have no idea.
4074.76s: And I also have to take a pause because Mel hit me up.
4078.56s: Ooh.
4079.56s: Dinner order time.
4081.24s: We can take the tin foil off for this.
4086.32s: So last night we did Indian.
4088.80s: I'm thinking Mexican.
4093.72s: She's voting for barbecue.
4098.88s: So we'll see if I can, we'll see if we can get Mexican.
4103.00s: That learns as barbecue.
4104.52s: That's a good idea.
4106.64s: Sneals as Chinese.
4107.64s: I like Chinese once in a while.
4109.28s: The problem I have with Chinese is that it's just so damn salty, so damn salty.
4115.48s: High food is good.
4116.48s: It's just a lot of noodles and stuff though.
4119.80s: Vladimir off-put and I don't know if there's like decent Japanese here.
4123.88s: Generation of capitals says Korean barbecue.
4125.24s: We're going to order it so I don't really like Korean barbecue ordered here.
4132.88s: So the other thing that I do want to highlight though is I've seen a couple other theories.
4138.28s: One of the theories I saw people say is like, is this him again assuming that this was
4142.72s: him just in this hypothetical?
4144.72s: Is this him like selling or exercising the calls?
4147.80s: That's not this.
4149.28s: And it's one, it wouldn't be reported as this.
4152.84s: Two, this would be, it would be literally lighting money on fire, which I've seen him
4159.56s: hold through some movement and not care.
4163.28s: So he has that part to him, but I don't exactly think that would make any sense again.
4170.48s: That's not what this is.
4171.40s: I can tell you that.
4173.04s: But the idea of buying these calls and exercising them is literally just lighting money on fire.
4181.80s: So I do not believe that that's what this is.
4186.16s: Lance says, Chili Mac, Chili Mac's always good.
4188.36s: I did like chili Mac.
4189.96s: It's not bad.
4192.92s: Jay card says, do you if he will not be the buyer and a quick seller to open the door
4197.28s: and pump and dump exactly that's and that's my that's my gut feeling too.
4200.96s: I really agree with that again.
4203.00s: And I don't know.
4207.48s: I'm guessing it's just it's pure speculation.
4210.76s: I'm guessing, but I just don't see unless he's testing something.
4215.72s: I don't see anything in this for him.
4217.84s: Like I don't see why that would make sense.
4219.84s: Oh, sick.
4220.84s: We're doing Mexican.
4222.92s: Oh, yes.
4225.72s: It's been it's been a minute.
4228.00s: It's been a minute since I've had Mexican.
4232.08s: I ordered the same thing.
4233.64s: I'm like I said, when it comes to like food, I'm so boring because I just don't care that
4239.56s: much.
4240.56s: Like obviously I can taste good food, but I just really want the nutrients.
4246.00s: That's about all I care.
4250.84s: All right.
4253.20s: So that's this now the other thing I wanted to do is to go back through some of his
4257.92s: old traits and let's take a look.
4262.08s: G 30 series says maybe he's just saying Chewie is dropping.
4264.92s: I don't see that.
4265.92s: That wouldn't really make sense, right?
4267.76s: Because Chewie moved a bit before that and people can see the chart.
4271.80s: So.
4273.12s: H says, could he have pieced into the calls and smaller sizes over previous weeks to
4278.08s: fly under the radar?
4279.08s: Don't think he would have sold on the pump to be honest, but curious to see I could be,
4283.32s: but I don't think so.
4285.24s: And it's because I look at the GME options every day and for him to build anything even
4290.48s: resembling what would make sense for him would literally take an eternity.
4297.04s: Buying in like smaller 500 lot entries.
4300.96s: And even.
4304.48s: 500 lot entries I would see those those still essentially pop up for me.
4311.40s: It's the stuff that's like, you know, if you're trading sub 10 lots, I would miss, but
4317.36s: I literally go down to 10 lots also cheers more drugs.
4320.28s: Now we have a set of medicine.
4326.08s: And I think we're good with drugs now.
4332.08s: Um, days says, now this is my theory.
4337.72s: I think he hasn't bought back GME as he want to hype, he want to hype to die out.
4344.28s: The meaning posted had no correlation with GME, even one of his tweets.
4349.12s: He said when I moved.
4350.12s: Yeah, I, and for, I think I read that as days, but I don't know how to say that name.
4355.04s: Dasted days, but I agree with you like that absolutely could be that absolutely could
4360.72s: be the case.
4361.88s: I wouldn't doubt it at all.
4363.88s: Um, you have to give me one second.
4367.84s: I have to go let the dog in be back and like like 32 second, no less than 32 seconds.
4374.28s: You guys can time me.
4375.28s: I'll be back in 27 seconds.
4377.80s: I bet 27 seconds.
4380.52s: Time 27 seconds time starts now.
4410.52s: How do we do?
4417.52s: I felt like that felt like those pretty good.
4424.52s: 34 damn.
4425.52s: That was much slower than I thought.
4428.52s: Yeah, that was seriously 34 seconds.
4434.52s: I move and slow.
4436.52s: I move and slow my old age.
4439.52s: Listen, I have a fucking pernated disc.
4442.52s: Give me a break here.
4444.12s: Apparently I need a break because I really thought that that would have been like a 27 second
4448.12s: movement.
4449.92s: That's unbelievable.
4450.92s: Shame on me.
4451.92s: All right, I'll do better next time.
4454.76s: Hopefully not next time, but.
4457.36s: Generation of capables says it was the hat.
4458.80s: The hat does add a lot of drag and these move a little bit.
4463.20s: So you have to be kind of careful.
4465.24s: Maybe I have to tighten these down, batting down the hatches.
4468.40s: Don't like that.
4470.68s: You guys can't see the amount of detail that went into this because there's even little
4477.16s: pebbles like rocks that go around the top like this, which I think is pretty sick.
4483.28s: I like my hat.
4485.56s: It literally breathes terribly though.
4491.68s: Mashed and says, don't do better next time you might tweak your back dog.
4495.04s: I mean, I look at it as the backs already fucking tweaked.
4497.24s: I just got I would show you guys the MRI.
4499.56s: I've never seen one before, but the MRI thing was actually really, really cool.
4503.08s: They gave me a disc and I like I could see my fucking organs and shit.
4506.04s: I can see my whole spine.
4507.44s: I mean, I don't know what I'm looking at.
4509.16s: So I can't tell what's good.
4510.16s: What's not, but it was super cool.
4512.08s: Like I literally have it here.
4513.44s: It's really cool to look at.
4516.72s: Ricky says Eric Ronnie Coleman can barely walk.
4521.88s: You don't see him using his back as an excuse shaking my DM head.
4524.68s: No, and I tell you what, Ronnie Coleman is like,
4527.20s: 10 million times the dude that I will ever be.
4531.72s: I aspire to be like somebody like him.
4533.56s: I've I've never seen somebody maintain such an amazingly positive disposition through
4541.44s: like a pretty rough go.
4546.40s: So yeah, that dude is that he literally is an inspiration to me.
4549.12s: That guy's incredible.
4550.36s: I think I actually do like think about him and a couple other people like that a lot.
4553.92s: Every time I'm feeling sorry for myself.
4555.32s: Like I was at the gym earlier today trying to do, I mean, I still work out every single
4559.56s: day.
4560.56s: Like there is no missing.
4561.56s: I just have to modify.
4563.84s: But the like I'm sitting there doing this bullshit stuff for my legs.
4567.56s: Like I have to go so light.
4569.12s: I can't I'm not using a barbell at all.
4571.64s: And I'm doing like these little step down things and I'm just sitting there, you know,
4574.64s: again, feeling sorry for myself like fuck.
4577.12s: Like I wish I could squat.
4578.12s: I wish I could do this.
4579.12s: And then I literally think about people like that.
4581.28s: And I just think like, what do I have to complain about?
4584.40s: Yes, I have a leg.
4585.40s: Yes, it doesn't work super great now.
4587.08s: And it's in pain.
4588.08s: But I have a leg.
4590.04s: So yeah, people like Ronnie Coleman are straight up like literally inspirational.
4594.24s: The dude is he's literally incredible.
4596.44s: I have nothing but respect for that guy.
4600.12s: Incredible dude.
4602.72s: Ryan, whoa, I'll literally buy that book right this second.
4606.04s: I've never heard of that book.
4608.60s: Ryan just recommended a book.
4609.68s: I'm always, always looking for good books.
4612.20s: The gift of injury, gift of injury.
4620.12s: Who is this?
4623.64s: Brian Carroll.
4625.64s: Yeah.
4626.64s: 30 dollars.
4628.64s: An expensive book.
4638.48s: I still grab it.
4640.04s: Damn, it's a big ass book.
4642.12s: I just ordered it.
4643.12s: I will.
4644.12s: Who gave me that recommendation?
4645.12s: Who was that?
4646.12s: Ryan, Ryan, hack.
4647.12s: Thank you for the recommendation.
4648.12s: I will read it.
4649.12s: And then I will report back.
4651.12s: I'm always, always looking for new books.
4655.12s: I have to be honest though.
4658.12s: I essentially only read the vast majority of stuff that I've been doing.
4664.12s: I'm not going to be able to read it.
4666.12s: I'm not going to be able to read it.
4667.12s: I'm not going to be able to read it.
4668.12s: I'm not going to be able to read it.
4669.12s: I'm not going to be able to read it.
4670.52s: The vast majority of stuff that I read is trading books.
4675.12s: So there's that.
4681.12s: But yeah, okay, back to GameStop.
4683.12s: Enough about me.
4684.12s: Nobody cares.
4686.12s: Ricky says Eric, are you like a millionaire?
4688.12s: Just buy it.
4689.12s: The I think that think, well, okay, couple of things.
4692.12s: The first thing is just because I have money now doesn't mean that all of my habits from
4697.80s: not having it are gone.
4699.92s: The second thing is you don't lose your value propositions in life.
4703.92s: There's a way that you become wealthy and it's by having value propositions.
4708.92s: And I did buy the book.
4710.92s: It apparently was slightly enough value to win me over.
4715.92s: But yeah, I'm still a discerning consumer.
4718.92s: The stuff that I don't care about or don't really track are things that I need.
4722.92s: So like the door dash, I'm about to order.
4726.92s: I have no idea what it costs and I don't care.
4729.92s: I'll obviously leave a decent tip and send it up the door.
4733.92s: That's it.
4734.92s: Like don't even look at a gas.
4735.92s: Don't know what it costs.
4736.92s: Even here in California.
4737.92s: Really don't know what it costs.
4738.92s: Grocer shopping.
4739.92s: I don't do it.
4740.92s: So it's stuff like that.
4741.92s: I don't really care.
4742.92s: But the yeah, stuff like that when I'm when I'm buying things like that, I still am.
4748.92s: Of course, I'm a discerning consumer.
4749.92s: If you're not, you're not going to have money for very long.
4752.92s: It will it will go away.
4756.92s: I don't think so.
4758.92s: That's not the way to get money.
4760.92s: It's like, I don't think that would help anybody.
4763.92s: Masha says he has that car in the wall behind him.
4766.92s: Yeah, that's one of the cars right there.
4768.92s: Right there.
4769.92s: So my mother-in-law painted that actually here.
4773.92s: Take a look.
4774.92s: It's she's like super, super talented.
4777.92s: Take a look at that thing.
4779.92s: She literally.
4780.92s: I don't know if you're going to be able to see it.
4782.92s: I'm not going to be able to see it.
4783.92s: It's super talented.
4784.92s: Take a look at that thing.
4785.92s: She literally.
4786.92s: She literally painted that, which is incredible.
4791.92s: But yeah, I love cars.
4792.92s: I have that.
4793.92s: I have the I have a McLaren that is like my first mid engine car.
4797.92s: I've never had one of those before that's been really fun to tinker with.
4801.92s: And then like for a truck.
4803.92s: I have before I'm a gear head.
4804.92s: So like I like cars.
4806.92s: I like automotive is a lot.
4808.92s: So.
4809.92s: Masha says I wish I wish I was half as talented.
4812.92s: It's nuts.
4813.92s: The things that artists can do just straight up blow my mind.
4817.92s: Absolutely blow my mind.
4820.92s: Champion of roses says I have a sick.
4822.92s: What kind of Corvette you have?
4825.92s: It's so the story behind the Corvette's kind of funny.
4827.92s: I've told it before, but I'll say it again, because I think it's interesting at least for me.
4834.92s: I did grow up poor, but the first time that I was ever around like a cool car.
4840.92s: I was working.
4841.92s: My uncle let me work with him on some of his cars that he was restoring.
4846.92s: And one of the cars I got to work on was a 64 white Corvette stingway stingray.
4851.92s: And as soon as I saw it, I was sitting there thinking like how cool it was.
4856.92s: And I literally told myself I was like, I'm going to get one of those one day.
4859.92s: Like that was the new target.
4861.92s: And I ended up getting it like four years ago, five years ago, something like that.
4872.92s: Colonel says, I'll swap you for my Bentley.
4876.92s: No, I don't like Bentley's to me that they're, yeah, to me that Bentley's are silly cars.
4883.92s: Some of them look kind of cool, but they're not for me.
4886.92s: James says I have a 1989.
4888.92s: Oh, that's sick. What is that like a C4?
4891.92s: 19 or C3?
4895.92s: C4, I think.
4906.92s: Yeah.
4907.92s: These are with the flip up headlights.
4910.92s: These are super cool.
4911.92s: Yeah, that's the C4.
4912.92s: That's awesome.
4913.92s: I love that.
4914.92s: What a fun grab.
4917.92s: Sweet.
4918.92s: All right. So now let's take a look at some of roaring kiddie's old trades.
4923.92s: So what I wanted to do is go through some of these.
4927.92s: And I actually wanted to look at the market.
4929.92s: Like what it looked like at the time that he had these positions on.
4934.92s: And I want to get a sense of kind of like what he was seeing.
4937.92s: I literally want to rebuild these positions.
4940.92s: So first things first, let's go into on demand and hopefully it works.
4945.92s: To pause.
4946.92s: Okay.
4947.92s: So it looks like a good start.
4949.92s: It's buffering.
4950.92s: So this might take a minute.
4951.92s: We can kind of bullshit in the middle.
4953.92s: Braimus says hello.
4954.92s: I actually say hello back to Braimus.
4957.92s: And we've been hovering around like 200 people, which is incredible.
4961.92s: Absolutely love that.
4962.92s: For those that are in the chat.
4964.92s: I would love to know where you're chatting in from.
4967.92s: Last time he did this was super, super fun.
4969.92s: What I want to do is find a way if there's like an app or something that can like
4974.92s: as people say where they're at, I can put like tap it in.
4978.92s: And then I could drop pins.
4980.92s: Is there something like that?
4982.92s: Hold on.
4984.92s: Is there a website that I can type in locations that.
4992.92s: Drops.
4993.92s: Inns on all of them.
4998.92s: I'm not going to go through that.
5004.92s: Google my maps.
5007.92s: I've never heard of Google my map.
5010.92s: Just try that.
5011.92s: Google my maps.
5018.92s: I've never seen this.
5022.92s: Create new map.
5024.92s: Create.
5027.92s: I've never seen this.
5030.92s: GME live stream.
5033.92s: Dave.
5035.92s: I guess I just dropped stuff in.
5037.92s: Is that right?
5039.92s: All right.
5040.92s: So first one I see is Las Vegas.
5044.92s: At a marker.
5046.92s: Next one I see is Ohio.
5053.92s: I'm going to go through this.
5056.92s: I'm going to go through this.
5059.92s: It doesn't keep the other one though.
5063.92s: Oh, you have to add it as another layer.
5065.92s: That right.
5068.92s: Uh oh.
5071.92s: Uh oh.
5072.92s: As you can tell, I have no idea what I'm doing.
5076.92s: There's one in Ohio.
5079.92s: Let me get rid of this.
5081.92s: I'm going to go through this.
5084.92s: I'm going to go through this.
5087.92s: I'm going to go through this.
5090.92s: Delete.
5093.92s: And then so the first one was Las Vegas.
5097.92s: At the map.
5101.92s: There we go.
5103.92s: Is that right?
5105.92s: Yeah.
5107.92s: Yo.
5108.92s: Technology is sick.
5109.92s: Add to map.
5112.92s: To add.
5115.92s: Portugal.
5118.92s: Portland.
5120.92s: Oregon.
5122.92s: Portland's dope.
5124.92s: This is sick area.
5126.92s: Hollywood.
5129.92s: Johnny, you're right by me.
5131.92s: I'm in San Diego.
5133.92s: What am I doing?
5134.92s: I'm like talking and typing which didn't work.
5137.92s: I'm like, you know, you're not going to be able to do that.
5140.92s: I'm going to go through this.
5143.92s: I'm going to be able to do that.
5146.92s: Hollywood California.
5150.92s: I guess I'll do mine.
5153.92s: Leave in hate.
5156.92s: And.
5161.92s: This is cool.
5162.92s: So I can save this.
5164.92s: I can save this.
5167.92s: I can save this.
5170.92s: Boners fairy.
5173.92s: I don't.
5174.92s: Yeah, that's cool.
5175.92s: I never heard of that place.
5177.92s: Idaho is pretty high on my visit list.
5180.92s: I really want to go to Idaho.
5183.92s: New Jersey.
5184.92s: Where New Jersey.
5186.92s: New Jersey.
5188.92s: At the map.
5190.92s: We got Kansas City.
5193.92s: We got the map.
5196.92s: Arkansas.
5199.92s: That beach.
5201.92s: Ottawa.
5204.92s: That.
5206.92s: You know, this is nuts.
5208.92s: Literally everywhere.
5210.92s: TCM King is from earth.
5212.92s: And then we're reminded that earth is flat, which is good.
5215.92s: And we have Edmonton Alberta.
5219.92s: Where is that?
5220.92s: What's the weather like there?
5222.92s: I think that's the wrong position.
5224.92s: So let's go back.
5225.92s: Beef.
5227.92s: The easy right we want.
5233.92s: Me he got the cold newspaper.
5234.92s: I know what he was蹈 start.
5236.92s: I used to go.
5238.92s: Iيل mentioned that community frizzing playing.
5240.92s: Well, then we were talking about the favorite.
5249.92s: To say your soul these days around.
5250.92s: who's in Ventura and Chris is also in Ventura.
5255.52s: Bramis says, do you think there are two more parties using swaps to keep the price of
5261.76s: GME down?
5262.76s: I don't know if they would be using swaps to keep the price down necessarily, but I definitely
5266.84s: do think that they're using swaps likely for an assortment of reasons.
5271.28s: It's hard for me to like fully tell the purpose of the swaps because we can't fully see
5277.48s: what's in them or how they're structured.
5280.68s: But yeah, I definitely think swaps are being used and I do think that they affect the
5284.80s: price of GME.
5285.80s: I just don't know how.
5287.12s: Aviator Geek from Denver.
5289.80s: I think Aviator Geek, I think my wife and I might be going out to Denver sometime in
5295.20s: the next few weeks.
5297.64s: See, Adel, we were out there not too long ago.
5300.56s: Lost Luna's New Mexico.
5305.12s: Dick.
5307.12s: Alabama.
5308.92s: Yo, this is crazy.
5310.76s: There's literally, we have people from everywhere.
5313.84s: Raptors is from Clifftland.
5316.08s: We already hit that one and we got Maryland.
5320.24s: Nobody from New York.
5321.08s: Interesting.
5322.60s: Vladimir Off-Tuin says, if you don't go to Northern Idaho, Idaho, don't mention being
5327.64s: from California.
5328.64s: I'm not from California.
5329.64s: I'm from New York, which might be even worse.
5331.84s: But that's where I'm at.
5334.36s: What the fuck, Braimus?
5336.32s: What is this?
5338.20s: Esther Hasey.
5340.12s: Does ketchup one?
5342.96s: What the fuck?
5344.76s: Where is that?
5346.76s: Oh, you're like way up there.
5351.24s: I never heard of that place.
5355.56s: Edmonton.
5356.56s: I think we have that already up.
5360.44s: Longry says, I'm curious why RK would drop dog without moving to GME, though, considering
5365.24s: the timing, the emoji chain and his awareness of the community.
5368.56s: One guest he's going to cash getting ready for after ER.
5371.96s: Yeah, I think that that's a really fair guess, to be honest.
5375.36s: And it's because I agree with you.
5377.20s: I think that it would be strange for him to rotate out of Chewy into something and
5383.68s: this something I would likely imagine would be GameStop.
5387.12s: But I'm not exactly, I'm not exactly sure why he would make that movement.
5396.56s: There's a lot of Heather Lease way more than I thought.
5398.92s: I thought that was going to be way easier to find.
5401.20s: Yo, there's two of you from Saskatchewan in case you guys are friends.
5407.24s: If you guys aren't friends and you probably don't want to meet one another, I guess that's
5410.72s: kind of a dumb statement because the sketch one is also massive.
5413.64s: They're not great.
5417.80s: Niaq, yo, Dursh Lups says, I seem the only person not being from North America.
5424.08s: Yeah, I didn't expect that either.
5426.36s: It's kind of nuts.
5428.48s: All right, cool.
5431.64s: So it looks like we got most of the participants in here.
5434.00s: Let's take a look at our map.
5436.28s: Check us out.
5437.80s: So here's what we need to do.
5439.96s: In order to complete this map, I think we need to get some people from South America.
5445.16s: If you know any friends, we need to get some people from Africa.
5448.76s: I would love to get somebody from the Swedish or Icelandic areas.
5454.76s: That would be sick.
5455.76s: That'll be on my hit list.
5457.16s: This is perfect.
5458.16s: And it literally saves our map.
5460.76s: This is super cool.
5463.16s: You see, I have a save that is GME livestream.
5465.92s: So we Gucci.
5466.92s: Paul says I'm in Brazil.
5468.92s: Hell yeah.
5469.92s: Follow, we're in Brazil.
5474.08s: Braimus says last question for me or swaps used as quote unquote as a ladder attacks.
5486.28s: That's tough.
5487.28s: So they're not necessarily used for that exact purpose.
5493.92s: Are you day, genera?
5498.64s: Add that perfect.
5499.64s: So we got our first South America representative, which is perfect.
5504.56s: We need that.
5508.40s: Check out our map.
5509.92s: This is what we're all from.
5510.92s: This is sick.
5511.92s: Love this.
5512.92s: Whoa.
5513.92s: Nick is here.
5514.92s: Nick.
5515.92s: That's perfect.
5517.76s: And Shandy Netherlands.
5521.64s: Sick.
5523.64s: That's what I needed.
5526.48s: That's exactly what I needed.
5528.60s: In Netherlands, that honestly doesn't pop up on my radar too much.
5532.32s: Maybe that's another spot I need to go.
5534.56s: Because we really, really, really, really liked Norway and we really, really liked Iceland.
5541.40s: On a Lulu, we got why?
5544.48s: Cool.
5545.48s: Yeah.
5546.48s: So back to the ladder attack thing though, is could they be used as part of it potentially?
5552.56s: But I don't, yeah, I don't really think that there's a massive likelihood that that's
5560.28s: the primary driver or the primary input to what moves.
5564.28s: Game stop.
5565.28s: Holy shit.
5567.28s: Yeah, there's no way I can pronounce that.
5571.28s: Hold on.
5572.28s: Let me see if I can throw that into like chat GPT.
5575.64s: Who are?
5576.64s: Hua Hin.
5577.64s: Don't.
5578.64s: No, don't do that.
5579.64s: Don't do that.
5581.16s: So, Americanize your name.
5583.16s: I'm going to find, I'm going to see how to say that.
5586.48s: Hold on.
5587.48s: You had to tell me what's the enunciation of that?
5591.52s: Oh, shit.
5596.00s: Okay.
5597.00s: Hmm.
5598.00s: I'm over my head.
5600.00s: Try to search it.
5601.00s: Oh, cool.
5602.00s: I got it right.
5603.00s: Hua Hin.
5604.00s: Sweet.
5606.00s: So, we got Thailand.
5609.00s: Thailand is a incredible spot.
5619.64s: Amsterdam is sick.
5622.28s: So there's two of you from Amsterdam, by the way, in case you didn't know, me to neighbor.
5626.92s: We got Dallas.
5627.92s: I was actually looking at moving the Dallas for a little while when we were exploring
5632.88s: places.
5633.88s: It got asked from the list for the weather.
5637.08s: But yeah, sweet.
5639.08s: Well, cool.
5641.08s: I love where our map is at.
5643.48s: We have really solid coverage.
5646.84s: Really, really solid coverage.
5649.48s: We just need some African folks, which I still have some friends from Tanzania.
5655.44s: We just have to get them in into GameStop, I suppose.
5660.28s: Rory Titty says, do you have Missouri?
5662.40s: I don't think so.
5668.64s: I have Kansas City.
5676.88s: We have Missouri in here.
5680.68s: We'll add Missouri.
5683.52s: Wait, I missed Oklahoma.
5685.12s: Let me get me Oklahoma people.
5690.28s: Perfect.
5693.88s: Perfect.
5695.08s: Wait, this will be fun.
5697.48s: Oh, if we can get somebody in fucking Antarctica, how sick would that be?
5703.08s: All right, now on demand has loaded.
5708.08s: So now let's go back in time.
5710.28s: So the first position that I see from him way back in time,
5715.28s: this is from eight, Sep 2019, eight, Sep 2019.
5722.48s: Let's see if we can go back that far.
5725.08s: Damn it, we can't.
5726.48s: That's annoying.
5727.48s: So we can only go to 2021.
5733.88s: Well, let's see.
5735.88s: Is there do you, do you guys know if there is another charting tool that
5740.48s: lets you go back to like a historic point in time and just look at the chart?
5745.68s: Historic.
5748.28s: Is there a website that lets you go back to a specific time on a chart?
5758.28s: Vintage jeeps says Michigan, we got to add our Michigan people.
5762.08s: I have a buddy that's in Minneapolis.
5774.48s: Trading view, I don't know if I have.
5780.88s: I don't know if I have a trading view account.
5782.28s: I do have a Yahoo finance account though.
5785.08s: So this is telling me Yahoo finance.
5786.48s: Let's me do that.
5788.48s: So we need game stop and it says you can define a date range for the chart.
5795.28s: Is that right?
5799.48s: I don't use this.
5807.08s: Not all I just want to, here we go date range.
5809.28s: Perfect.
5810.28s: This is perfect.
5812.28s: All right.
5813.28s: So I said eight, Sep 19.
5816.08s: Is that right?
5818.48s: That's August.
5819.48s: I'm so used to doing military.
5822.48s: So for me, this would be cracked, but I forgot.
5827.48s: This is the correct way.
5830.48s: Okay.
5831.48s: And then we'll go from there to.
5836.48s: It doesn't let me go past the chart.
5838.48s: I'm going to go back to the chart.
5840.48s: I'm going to go back to the chart.
5842.48s: I'm going to go back to the chart.
5845.48s: I'm going to go back to.
5847.48s: It doesn't let me go past it for some reason, which is interesting.
5850.48s: Let's see what it looked like there.
5852.48s: And then I don't want to do mountain.
5854.48s: I would like to do candles.
5857.48s: And then let's do like a one year daily.
5861.48s: Oh, this is cool.
5864.48s: We don't need that.
5867.48s: We don't need that.
5869.48s: Sick.
5871.48s: Vladimir off Putin says toss does it with on a man.
5873.48s: Yeah, definitely.
5874.48s: Just the toss doesn't let me go back far enough.
5877.48s: Toss one only lets me go back to 2021.
5881.48s: I want to see even though I won't be able to look at the options specifically that he had,
5888.48s: I do want to see like just what things looked like when he was posting and like establishing
5896.48s: these these different positions.
5899.48s: So the first question I do have for you guys though is this is the earliest position I can find for him.
5910.48s: Is there anywhere else that he's posted that you know of that shows previous positions?
5916.48s: Because if not, I'll start from here.
5919.48s: But if we know somewhere that has earlier positions, I would love, love, love to go to those if they're available.
5926.48s: And the meantime, it looks like we need to add New York good old where I'm from.
5931.48s: I will just do New York state.
5936.48s: That we got landcaster.
5940.48s: EA.
5941.48s: We'll add that.
5944.48s: And Omaha.
5948.48s: There's a.
5951.48s: Omaha's a vibe.
5953.48s: So we're very US heavy.
5956.48s: We have representation out in the North Pacific.
5960.48s: We have representation in the Southern hemisphere through our friends in Brazil.
5967.48s: All right, so it looks like this is the earliest that we have at least to go off of.
5974.48s: We know at this point.
5977.48s: This is where he I mean, he already started scaling in here.
5982.48s: So I see that he had 1000 shares at this point and then a bunch.
5988.48s: Oh, no, then not a thousand shares.
5990.48s: That's my bad.
5991.48s: This was a thousand lots total across all these different things.
5995.48s: So his recent his latest ad to this position was on three.
6001.48s: So this position was on three.
6004.48s: Set.
6007.48s: Wait, that doesn't make sense.
6009.48s: Yeah, no, it does.
6010.48s: Three set.
6011.48s: Let's go to three set.
6018.48s: Is there a way to draw there is.
6022.48s: Oh, perfect.
6024.48s: So we'll be able to.
6026.48s: This is perfect.
6028.48s: So this can go here.
6032.48s: This I can scoot over here.
6035.48s: And I can look at each day that he entered.
6039.48s: So the earliest was seven June.
6044.48s: So that's as far back as we need to go.
6051.48s: Yeah, this is perfect.
6052.48s: So then here we'll just go back like six months.
6055.48s: Three months.
6057.48s: Okay.
6059.48s: So.
6061.48s: Seven June is here.
6066.48s: I don't know how the drawing works.
6068.48s: You have to forgive me for a second. There goes.
6071.48s: There's seven June.
6073.48s: There were way to.
6083.48s: Whatever it's.
6086.48s: So it's.
6092.48s: We're off Putin says wouldn't a spreadsheet of historical data
6096.48s: be easier? No, no, no, no.
6098.48s: What I'm.
6099.48s: Okay.
6100.48s: So takes what I'm explicitly trying to do right now is see what he
6103.48s: saw when he was putting the positions on.
6106.48s: So what I'm doing is I'm flagging these different days so that I can
6111.48s: get a lot of things.
6114.48s: Wait, I'm in 2024.
6117.48s: No, I'm not.
6120.48s: Nick, why are you doing me dirty like this?
6123.48s: Did I not apply it?
6125.48s: Ah, wait.
6127.48s: Now I'm super confused.
6130.48s: I see.
6131.48s: I understand now.
6135.48s: Holy shit.
6136.48s: I'm stupid.
6137.48s: I get it.
6138.48s: I get it.
6140.48s: I get it.
6141.48s: I get it.
6142.48s: I get it.
6143.48s: I get it.
6144.48s: So we want.
6145.48s: 2019.
6147.48s: And then this is from.
6150.48s: The eighth of September.
6153.48s: So we want this.
6155.48s: And then we want it.
6157.48s: Let's just go back to like June, which is like the beginning of
6161.48s: that year.
6162.48s: Or the beginning of his purchases.
6164.48s: So we'll just go back to like May.
6166.48s: There we go.
6167.48s: Thank you.
6168.48s: So this is the end.
6169.48s: We're all, well, we go to next year.
6171.48s: Now, Zach.
6172.48s: Zacheri says, do you not have newton's docs?
6174.48s: I do.
6175.48s: Yeah, this.
6176.48s: I haven't.
6177.48s: I mean, I don't know where to find everything in there.
6178.48s: If this is in there.
6179.48s: This would be even easier.
6181.48s: I'll grab his.
6183.48s: Are you saying that this is in there?
6186.48s: Yeah.
6195.48s: Is this still wrong?
6201.64s: This looks right.
6204.92s: So I see one May 2019 to 8 set.
6209.80s: Yeah, this looks correct.
6215.92s: Down at the bottom on the little pop up on the y-axis.
6219.60s: It shows me 65 2019.
6223.28s: But I think this is correct.
6226.36s: So it looks like his first buy was on the seventh here.
6237.32s: I need the drawing.
6242.32s: Seven.
6244.72s: And then the 20th here.
6248.64s: Oh, that's annoying.
6252.60s: You have to like click the box each time.
6261.60s: OK.
6264.12s: And then the 17th.
6269.36s: So this dude was averaging down hard.
6275.00s: And the other thing that this tells me is that I mean,
6280.52s: some of this is actually kind of fascinating to be honest,
6283.88s: because if you take a look at this buying behavior,
6288.80s: oh, man, this is fascinating.
6291.48s: This is like standard trader behavior, man.
6294.84s: So we bought it on both of these days, the 17th to 18th.
6299.76s: And then he waited until the 14th all the way down here.
6304.32s: Wow, this is, I don't know how cool this is for you guys,
6312.24s: but I have to be honest, this is very cool for me.
6314.76s: The 20th.
6322.16s: The 22nd.
6327.92s: Here.
6328.44s: The 22nd twice.
6334.84s: Interesting.
6338.44s: The 27th.
6342.76s: And then the third of set.
6347.76s: Here.
6359.44s: Interesting.
6361.44s: Robo's, hold on, I'm confused.
6367.44s: BH Murdoch says his initial buys were based on the notion
6376.44s: that GameStop was planning a share buyback.
6378.44s: It was in one of his YouTube vids.
6380.44s: Yeah, that makes a ton of sense.
6381.44s: So here's, here's what I'm seeing.
6385.44s: And this is kind of just like a starting point.
6388.44s: But when I look at this, he bought it after a drop.
6395.44s: And it looks like he waited for the drop a couple days.
6399.44s: And then it looked, it looked like he maybe have bought it when it
6404.44s: looked like it was starting to consolidate.
6406.44s: Right.
6407.44s: So kind of running sideways here.
6408.44s: Then it kind of runs this gap up as it's coming down.
6413.44s: He's buying again.
6414.44s: Then as it's coming down more, he's averaging down.
6418.44s: And here is when he starts putting on some of his, you know,
6422.44s: closely timed to trade day over day.
6425.44s: And then here's when he starts putting on some of his bigger
6428.44s: positions in terms of lots.
6430.44s: Right.
6431.44s: So here on the 14th, I can see that he put on 200 down here.
6436.44s: So he was averaging down hard.
6440.44s: Now the other thing I see is he started really light with his
6445.44s: sizing 50, 50, 50, 50, 200.
6452.44s: So that's a really, really, really massive, massive average
6457.44s: down from where he started.
6460.44s: Then he added another hundred here.
6463.44s: And then he added 100, then 200.
6467.44s: So 300 total, two separate trades.
6469.44s: The 200 was added as it was going back up.
6472.44s: So what I'm seeing here is a trader that's both averaging down
6479.44s: and then averaging up, which is really interesting because I
6485.44s: have to be honest.
6487.44s: That's something that I also do very carefully though.
6491.44s: It's not something that I think works well for a lot of people.
6495.44s: But what this tells me is that with whatever money he had in the
6500.44s: account, $100,000 of the account, it tells me that obviously he was
6506.44s: very convicted in what he was doing.
6509.44s: And he thought he was getting even better value on his original
6514.44s: thesis as it was down.
6518.44s: So what I can tell you from that, that is still an investor
6523.44s: mindset.
6525.44s: That's less of a trader mindset.
6528.44s: Way more of an investor mindset.
6531.44s: And the other thing that tells me is that this is more of an investor
6534.44s: mindset is these options were out in 2021.
6540.44s: So he's buying these really far out in time.
6545.44s: And then if you take a look at what his strike is, these are the
6549.44s: eight calls.
6552.44s: So eight for reference is here.
6557.44s: Can I draw like a price line?
6561.44s: No, I draw a price line.
6564.44s: Oh, it's there.
6567.44s: There's our price line.
6569.44s: So here's where he's buying.
6571.44s: And then let's go back further in time.
6573.44s: Well, this let me.
6575.44s: This takes me back to today.
6577.44s: Hold on.
6578.44s: I'm going to take this 2019 back to the first.
6582.44s: Apply.
6585.44s: And then I want to go back like six months.
6589.44s: I think I broke it.
6594.44s: Let me do this.
6605.44s: I'll just do like six months.
6609.44s: And then let's go to 19 again.
6613.44s: And then this will go.
6618.44s: There.
6619.44s: And then here let's go to 19.
6623.44s: And this is fine.
6624.44s: We're going to like September 30th.
6632.44s: So I'm going to go back to the game.
6639.44s: Not letting me.
6644.44s: I don't know what the problem is with that.
6647.44s: Feel like I'm asking it a fair request.
6651.44s: Maybe I'll go back to May it worked when I did it in May.
6655.44s: Oh, was it before the stock?
6658.44s: When did the stock launch?
6660.44s: Wait, when did GameStop go public?
6662.96s: Maybe that's what it was.
6664.36s: It's like I was probably just going back before it was even a thing.
6667.16s: No, GameStop's been around for a while.
6672.56s: In 2002.
6676.44s: Weird.
6677.28s: Yeah, that's super weird.
6678.56s: Anyways, it works when I do this.
6680.08s: So I'm just going to go from the first of May to the 30th of September.
6684.08s: It seems to like that.
6685.08s: Just fine.
6685.76s: Also, shout out to the apes.
6687.52s: There's 200 of you right now learning about
6690.36s: roaring kitty.
6691.36s: We got a new ham sure.
6693.20s: All right, let me add that to my list really quick.
6695.56s: New ham sure.
6697.84s: I have a buddy that lives in Vermont.
6703.64s: Okay.
6704.68s: So this tells me with certainty, right?
6709.48s: Conviction in the trade and doesn't care really what the price is as long as it's
6715.00s: below whatever he thinks the price is going to be, which is obviously much higher.
6719.76s: Okay, great.
6720.72s: So the big takeaways for me when it comes to this one, start scaling in small,
6727.04s: then gets bigger when the underlying gets to his eyes, a better perceived value.
6734.36s: Right.
6734.60s: This is still very much an investor mindset.
6737.84s: So now let's scroll up and see if there's any changes in the position and there's not.
6742.96s: So now the day is September 11th.
6747.80s: So let's go there.
6750.68s: Which is we already have that September 11th is here.
6756.20s: He posted on this day with his update.
6760.68s: So now let's go up again, see if there's any changes.
6764.48s: Nope.
6764.68s: Same same.
6765.80s: This is end of September.
6767.48s: This release came out the 30th, which is here.
6770.68s: So this is another, another really interesting thing is that he established this entire
6779.24s: position all through here.
6781.64s: And one, he was directly correct to a pretty significant degree.
6787.88s: And the market doesn't actually fully reward him for it.
6791.08s: And some of that I think is because his options are actually decaying a bit.
6795.56s: He is a lot of smaller options in here.
6800.84s: So the ones that he really started getting in at cheap are obviously showing really massive profits.
6806.12s: Right.
6806.76s: So these ones he got for six grand and they're showing 23 grand.
6811.32s: But one of the problems he's facing is that even though these options essentially doubled still, right.
6817.76s: They he got in at 60 and they're trading for $1.20 or so.
6823.48s: So still about doubling, but they're much, much, much smaller positions.
6828.84s: So here, even he was very correct.
6832.04s: I'm surprised that he didn't use more of his money in here though.
6836.92s: Let me double check that because something weird.
6842.08s: Okay.
6843.88s: That's weird.
6845.12s: So I don't see any change in these positions.
6848.32s: I have to make sure I'm looking really closely, but I notice his cash goes down.
6856.52s: This is the same.
6861.80s: This is not the same.
6864.64s: You see?
6867.40s: So did any of these change that I'm not missing 50 50 50 200 100 100 200 100 100 100?
6877.84s: 50 50 50 200.
6879.56s: Yes.
6880.04s: Okay.
6880.28s: So there's no changes to any of these.
6883.56s: So it looks like cash came out of the account for some reason.
6890.28s: Yeah.
6891.12s: Sadrick, I think he's on the, I think he's on the, I think you're on the right path.
6895.40s: I like you just, that's a withdrawal.
6898.20s: That's cash coming out of the account.
6900.48s: Okay.
6901.60s: So now let's go here.
6904.44s: Still no changes.
6906.52s: This is October 31st.
6910.16s: So now let's go to October 31st.
6914.72s: It all likes it.
6915.20s: Great.
6915.76s: So here next update, no change.
6925.52s: More money.
6930.80s: 117.
6936.52s: What?
6937.60s: So part of my confusion here is there's 1124 1117 K a month later.
6951.48s: He's still at 1117 solid with 11 added.
6959.80s: So he has he added cash.
6962.12s: But it's still up a ton.
6972.68s: That confuses me.
6978.68s: Oh, nevermind.
6979.40s: Okay.
6980.32s: That makes more sense.
6981.00s: So it's, yeah.
6981.68s: Okay.
6982.16s: Sorry.
6982.96s: That makes the sense.
6984.08s: My bad.
6985.64s: I was really confused because this look like obviously a big run up from here.
6989.12s: But that's why the position looks so similar to his September update is
6994.52s: because if we look at the end of September here, it's essentially flat with
7000.16s: worries at the end of oct.
7001.84s: Okay.
7002.32s: Makes sense.
7003.76s: So now we go up.
7006.32s: No trade still end of November.
7009.32s: Cash is out.
7013.64s: And I see no new trades.
7015.72s: So there's a withdrawal.
7020.12s: So now let's update this.
7023.12s: November.
7028.84s: Okay.
7032.44s: So here we had cash come out.
7037.20s: And then here we had cash go in over the course of the month, not on that day
7044.12s: specifically.
7044.84s: Okay.
7045.12s: Here we go.
7045.88s: So now we have a new trade on 11.
7049.12s: December.
7056.80s: We now have a new trade.
7057.80s: So again, on a big gap down, he likes to buy when it's dropping.
7067.00s: What I don't understand though is why wouldn't, man, I just don't fully understand
7072.36s: this.
7073.76s: Let me go one more day so that I can at least highlight this damn candle.
7083.76s: Oh, it's so interesting.
7086.28s: I don't.
7091.00s: Is that zooming in?
7092.96s: That is.
7096.04s: I'm just, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what have I done?
7099.00s: All right.
7099.64s: This is.
7107.92s: Yo, hold on.
7109.24s: I've just messed everything up.
7111.08s: There we go.
7111.72s: Okay.
7114.08s: So now it drops and he buys another hundred.
7121.88s: And here's another thing I see.
7124.68s: The account value is up to 230 K.
7128.20s: And if fucking drops to $63,000, it gets murdered.
7134.88s: So a big reason.
7136.48s: And it's funny because again, this is the world of options is because even though
7142.36s: on 11 December, it's still much higher than where it's been for him.
7150.68s: Right.
7150.96s: So if we look at 11 December, it's essentially higher than all of the bulk of his
7157.80s: buys Vladimir off Putin says April 2020.
7161.52s: I'm trying to save you time.
7163.28s: We talk about.
7166.96s: Save me save me time with what?
7168.28s: This is Mr. off Putin.
7170.52s: This is what I'm trying to do with my time.
7172.20s: I'm trying to the whole again, I'll reiterate the whole point of doing this is
7176.64s: to look at the movements he's making and what it looked like when he made those movements.
7183.40s: Like I'm, this is something I call finger printing.
7187.36s: So the whole idea behind this is again, I have zero intention personally of trying
7194.16s: to model any specific trade after roaring kitty.
7197.96s: I would never trade off of somebody else personally.
7201.16s: I'll use some of their movements or research to fuel my ideas, but I wouldn't
7206.04s: necessarily just try to follow him.
7209.08s: What I'm interested about though is the way and the buying behavior that he has
7216.04s: because roaring kitty as a character is absolutely unequivocally fascinating to me.
7223.56s: The things that he does and the reasons why he does it is crazy.
7229.00s: It's just so interesting.
7230.56s: So that's the whole point here.
7232.12s: There's honestly no.
7234.32s: This is what I'm trying to do.
7235.60s: There's not saving me time.
7237.24s: This is precisely how I want to spend my time in this instance is to take a look at
7241.72s: these exact things.
7244.92s: So.
7250.36s: Let's actually read some of these in between these.
7252.36s: I haven't been doing that.
7254.00s: What do you think it should be?
7257.48s: Let's see.
7259.16s: Let's add that.
7260.04s: I'm going to get rid of.
7264.56s: Let me close some of these.
7270.16s: Just let it have some room to move.
7275.68s: OK.
7277.36s: OK, so that's gone.
7285.16s: Zachary says, when did the CARES Act allow you to pull from retirement?
7288.88s: I don't know much about that.
7291.88s: Mike Well says, we're in Kitty started July 13th, 2020 on YouTube and
7298.16s: Nove on X. He breaks it all down for you if you have a hundred plus to watch.
7308.08s: Uh,
7310.28s: um,
7312.28s: Oh, you mean like in terms of his methodology?
7314.88s: Yeah, I've watched some of his videos.
7316.72s: I haven't watched all of them yet.
7318.24s: Thanks.
7321.88s: So he's talking about again, he's still talking value investor standpoint,
7325.88s: trigger a version to fair value.
7328.88s: Mm hmm.
7330.88s: Still free cash flow positive.
7332.88s: Again, that is very, very standard value investor.
7337.88s: Consul refresh can't save GME, but should help slow stabilize decline.
7341.88s: Right.
7342.88s: So this is one is this one's a December 11th.
7345.88s: So he's obviously talking about this drop here, right here.
7351.88s: What's a better name to be long?
7353.88s: So obviously supremely supremely convicted.
7360.88s: Uh, what kind of chart looking all the time?
7364.88s: I'm a fundamental value investor through and through.
7368.88s: Uh,
7369.88s: so this starts to make sense to me because it says I'm a fundamental investor through
7375.88s: and through, but I've come to appreciate how charts can telegraph information
7378.88s: to investors.
7379.88s: I use mostly for screening and timing, which is really interesting because this also
7383.88s: lines up a little bit with some of the behaviors I saw with respect to the,
7388.88s: uh, some of his videos that talk about specifically is move from being a value
7395.88s: investor, quote, unquote, which happened in the more recent YouTube videos.
7399.88s: So this is fascinating to see even this starting to creep in, right?
7405.88s: So fundamental value investor, but now we're talking about an appreciation for
7410.88s: charts, which makes a ton of sense, but this is on 11 December.
7413.88s: So very, very cool.
7416.88s: I look at charts of many companies, not just GME.
7420.88s: So this is the 12th.
7422.88s: So still around this time frame.
7425.88s: So far, but that's irrelevant.
7427.88s: Yellow at me for being dumb or being tell voted who cares what it's done since 2018.
7432.88s: It matters to me is what it does in 2020.
7434.88s: Since August, GM is up more than all of those companies.
7438.38s: So he's up here.
7439.88s: He's still defending and talking about his thesis, which also tells me a lot to be honest.
7444.88s: It tells me that he's still, um, let me see if I can see the top comment here.
7451.68s: He's still diving into a little bit of like why he's doing.
7458.88s: I've always respect for iron hands, no matter how retarded they may be.
7465.88s: This guy does, there's some kind of flare.
7469.88s: Buries top or bottom.
7475.88s: So you belong here.
7478.88s: You're real determined to make that wow.
7480.88s: This is fascinating.
7483.88s: I didn't realize that people were like like this towards him.
7493.88s: This is interesting.
7498.88s: Perfect.
7501.88s: Oh no child, what is you doing?
7503.88s: That's a great comment.
7505.88s: That's hilarious.
7507.88s: Dude, just what the fuck so many names to be long and you do this.
7511.88s: They cut EPS guidance by 90% what the hell is your both thesis here?
7515.88s: That's this is actually a great question though to be completely honest.
7518.88s: Like this part is, you know, whatever, but this I this I think is interesting.
7524.88s: What's a better name to be long SPX, Google Apple, Tesla, all these names.
7529.88s: Who cares what it's done since 2018.
7531.88s: What matters what it does going forward.
7534.88s: GME will be lucky to make it through 2020 without receivership.
7541.88s: You believe bankruptcy is on the table for GME?
7551.88s: Interesting.
7560.88s: This is fascinating.
7567.88s: The thing I'm really enjoying right now is seeing the way he still discusses like his thoughts.
7579.88s: Vladimir says arcade didn't move the stock then he was distanced.
7582.88s: Yeah, yeah, it's crazy.
7586.88s: The thing is I get Wall Street bets is what it is.
7589.88s: And again, like the other thing that I absolutely would poke fun again, like not knowing the future,
7594.88s: but I would poke fun or identify for somebody like Rory and Kitty is like, it is nuts to put your entire portfolio
7601.88s: into calls in something like GameStop at this time.
7605.88s: Like that is such a wild thesis.
7608.88s: Again, it can work out but to be that concentrated, I think it does make sense for Wall Street bets, right?
7614.88s: Like that is truly a yellow bet.
7617.88s: But I think the difference is is when I see the cat talking about his ideas, he's like really getting into detail on like the background.
7627.88s: It's not like he's just throwing money into some shit, right?
7631.88s: Like he saw something that he truly felt was an opportunity.
7635.88s: Now again, for everybody else that looks at this and they start thinking like, oh, you know, like I'm going to be the next roaring kitty.
7641.88s: It's cool to think that way and it's cool to desire that kind of stuff.
7645.88s: The problem though is that it's a really, really, really low problem.
7651.88s: It's kind of like trying to follow somebody into winning the lottery.
7654.88s: It's very difficult to do because again, like I look at this and I see roaring kitty was really convicted.
7663.88s: And the thesis played out.
7664.88s: It worked beautifully.
7666.88s: Super high risk though.
7668.88s: Like super high risk. There's no, there's no other way about it. It's just interesting.
7675.88s: Alright, so let's see.
7678.88s: What degrees is priced in?
7680.88s: Yeah, okay, let's get to the next one.
7683.88s: Okay, so we added more here.
7685.88s: This is perfect.
7687.88s: So this was 31 D's 19.
7692.88s: And on.
7695.88s: Shit, it doesn't tell me.
7699.88s: Amit kitty.
7702.88s: He added a bunch of shit.
7706.88s: Damn it.
7710.88s: So he has 21 Fab.
7713.88s: So he got busy here.
7718.88s: So I can't tell exactly what the timeframes are just yet.
7725.88s: Jonathan says, remember it's 401 stocks split when looking at the price.
7732.88s: Yeah, the main thing I'm just talking about is I can see the total number of contracts changed drastically.
7738.88s: Right.
7739.88s: So I see 600 here, 600 here, 400, 400, 200.
7742.88s: Whereas down here.
7744.88s: I see 1100 total.
7746.88s: So when I say that he got busy, he just started putting on a bunch more options trades in different explorations.
7753.88s: Now the, the slight downside is he doesn't have those open.
7757.88s: So I can't see exactly what happened.
7760.88s: So what I will do is fast forward us a little bit more will go to like the end of January.
7767.88s: And then essentially for from this point in December.
7774.88s: This region, I know that he bought a bunch of options.
7779.88s: I don't know when what went on.
7783.88s: But again, looking at this from his perspective as this is moving.
7790.88s: We're buying in as it goes down, it goes down.
7793.88s: Then it's rallying up as soon as it drops again, he starts buying again.
7797.88s: And then if I had to guess when he was adding more to this, I would guess it's on these days.
7803.88s: And then again, this is just part of fingerprinting.
7806.88s: This is starting to get a feel for when he's putting on these bigger positions.
7810.88s: That's my guess.
7811.88s: And then my guess is we'll see him transact more in mid Jan 2020.
7817.88s: That's just a guess I don't know yet.
7819.88s: So let's actually see.
7821.88s: But let's see some of these updates in the meantime.
7826.88s: How do you question?
7830.88s: There it is.
7831.88s: Finally, I was wondering how to just see the top comment for these things.
7835.88s: What's your read on last earnings release?
7837.88s: I know you added more after they cut EPS for wow, look at this.
7842.88s: He's down to 112.
7845.88s: He absolutely got crushed here.
7853.88s: Damn, I didn't look at the cash.
7855.88s: I'm just looking at the cash real quick.
7857.88s: So like less than a grand.
7861.88s: 20 grand.
7863.88s: And then we're here now six grand.
7865.88s: So he used a bunch of it.
7867.88s: All right.
7868.88s: So let's take a look at.
7871.88s: Dayswags is just stopping in a month celebrating my friends wedding.
7876.88s: But I love y'all have a good night.
7877.88s: Great to see you.
7878.88s: Day swag.
7879.88s: Have a killer time.
7880.88s: My dude.
7881.88s: Enjoy it.
7884.88s: Free McFree or since as I like your muscle man, it's just a tank top.
7889.88s: Like a standard, sustainer tank top is hot here in California right now, man.
7893.88s: It's like 90 degrees plus.
7899.88s: Okay.
7900.88s: So back to this though.
7901.88s: What you read on last year, cut EPS guidance from like one one five to point two.
7907.88s: So this is where we're talking about like a really, really, really big drop.
7913.88s: And then it says.
7915.88s: Okay.
7916.88s: So let's see.
7917.88s: Sandbagging yes, it's possible 30 to 40% chance.
7920.88s: Okay.
7922.88s: So what they're talking about here in terms of sandbagging it is trying to guide down and to try to slow things down.
7928.88s: Based on the incredibly aggressive share repurchasing Q2 sentiment expressed on the latest CC the decision to sell their.
7939.88s: Manage management has now shown their cards.
7941.88s: They're on the side of the shareholders.
7942.88s: Yeah, I agree.
7943.88s: This is this is man, very, very prescient of him.
7947.88s: So this tells me with like again, we are like full, deep fucking value like that.
7955.88s: This is this type of conversation is completely, completely wrapped in value investing.
7964.88s: Reclassification latest 10 Q. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
7968.88s: Of course, it's possible simply underestimate the degree of cyclical secular design such an issue fashion. Yeah, yeah.
7975.88s: Next gen consoles won't be released until 2020 Q4.
7980.88s: Okay.
7981.88s: So just talking about general general picture there, fascinating.
7985.88s: Okay.
7986.88s: So we know this period he got he got busy.
7990.88s: He built a lot.
7992.88s: Take a look.
7993.88s: So mostly this is so funny.
7995.88s: So like to see the mutation of his character is just epic, right?
8001.88s: Like a lot of discussion points, a lot of like arguing, so to speak back and forth.
8006.88s: Right. So fair point, but I'm sure you'd agree it's not uncommon for analysts to forecast poorly, right?
8010.88s: So he's like talking about his things and then like take a look.
8014.88s: It just starts going more and more into just memes and gifts.
8019.88s: Okay. So what happened? Oh, damn.
8024.88s: I murdered.
8026.88s: Jan 2020 end of month.
8030.88s: 31 Jan. Okay. So that's where we are now.
8033.88s: Did he do anything?
8035.88s: I would really think he would do something in here.
8039.88s: 4 4 6 6 5. He did.
8043.88s: He did. No, he did not. Wait, he did.
8047.88s: 4 or did these come off? The 17 Jan's rolled off. I see. Okay.
8052.88s: So 17 Jan's.
8054.88s: My guess is those just probably came down for.
8059.88s: Yeah, these were worth nothing at the point.
8062.88s: They were worth like a hundred bucks.
8064.88s: So it looks like these we just kind of took an expiration and then I realized I have to.
8069.88s: I have to send our dinner order off.
8075.88s: Perfect.
8078.88s: Alright, so we got a little bit before that shows up.
8082.88s: I am thoroughly enjoying going through this.
8085.88s: This is absolutely incredible to me.
8089.88s: Um,
8091.88s: Yes, so it looks like he just let those go.
8095.88s: And he didn't do anything here that.
8098.88s: Shocking. So 64 hundred bucks there.
8101.88s: 64 hundred bucks there. Just sat on the cash.
8104.88s: Very surprising.
8106.88s: And a feb. Here we go. So now we can finally see where some of these others came on.
8113.88s: So now he's down to 183 bucks. So let's go to the end of feb.
8121.88s: And I see 4 6 6 1000.
8125.88s: Or so then obviously these febs came down for a loss.
8129.88s: And then we were left with these like the April's the July's the jams and then the April's of the next year.
8135.88s: Should be right. So April's July's jams April the next year.
8139.88s: And it looks like he built into this.
8142.88s: So when did he buy buy into this the 31st.
8147.88s: Oh, okay. Yeah. So he did start buying in one I thought he would I was really, really surprised.
8153.88s: That it didn't look like he did. So these 16 April's started going on the 31st of December.
8161.88s: Which is here.
8166.88s: And then on this tiny little candle you literally can't even see it.
8169.88s: And then he started scaling in more on the third.
8174.88s: Which is here.
8178.88s: And then on a down day.
8183.88s: And then in 2020 we have
8191.88s: February 18th with three separate transactions all at 20.
8200.88s: February 18th.
8203.88s: I got to grab the box.
8210.88s: February 18th.
8213.88s: Okay.
8216.88s: So the account is not doing well.
8220.88s: These longer term options that he got back here are decaying.
8229.88s: Okay. So let's see.
8231.88s: A bunch of gifts started at a Hyundai.
8235.88s: He was up over 200 200.
8238.88s: Now he's down to 40.
8244.88s: Okay. So he's kind of defending himself a little bit there.
8248.88s: Okay. So April of 2020.
8254.88s: We'll go to the end of April.
8259.88s: Michael says can you add RSI and MAs? Yeah. What?
8263.88s: Well, I don't know what it will let me add indicators.
8271.88s: Oh, wrong one. My bad. Click out.
8275.88s: Nope. My bad. RSI.
8282.88s: I don't know.
8287.88s: I've removed this one.
8290.88s: There we go.
8294.88s: Mac. Do you kill that?
8299.88s: General timing says how many options do you think expired
8302.88s: worthless during this time? That's a great question.
8305.88s: So a lot.
8307.88s: So we got 17 Jan 21 fab and then April of 20.
8314.88s: And that was two, four, four.
8317.88s: And we got in for eight plus 16 grand there.
8325.88s: So the Jans came off for probably nothing.
8330.88s: The 21 fabs about to come off for nothing.
8333.88s: So we got 17 Aprils.
8337.88s: We'll be coming up soon probably for nothing.
8344.88s: Yeah. So those are gone for nothing.
8347.88s: So at least at least 16 to 20 grand.
8350.88s: Something like that.
8353.88s: I think like that.
8356.88s: Yeah. Because the interesting part is some of these were showing a
8359.88s: lot of things.
8362.88s: So we got 17 July.
8364.88s: Okay. So let's see what happened in here on the 30th of April.
8369.88s: We have 17 July 17 July.
8373.88s: And then April 16 April.
8377.88s: And then let's go here.
8380.88s: July Jan April.
8381.88s: Oh, did I just miss read that? Is that Jan?
8385.88s: No. Interesting.
8388.88s: So these came off.
8391.88s: So he has 15 Jan 21 eight calls.
8401.88s: Those aren't here. So he sold them.
8407.88s: And these are for 2021.
8409.88s: That's interesting.
8410.88s: So was it just to unlock this money?
8413.88s: Yeah. Because he had the bulk of his capital in this 26 grand.
8417.88s: So he's going to be able to get the money.
8420.88s: So he's going to be able to get the money.
8423.88s: Of lot of me says there's another position post you need to click on
8426.88s: start of short squeeze. Okay.
8429.88s: Where's that at up here?
8432.88s: This one.
8435.88s: Okay.
8438.88s: Yep. Thank you.
8441.88s: So April July July.
8443.88s: Okay. So we still got rid of that jam position though.
8446.88s: So we're going to go to the next one.
8449.88s: And then April.
8452.88s: This is 30 April.
8456.88s: So now I know.
8459.88s: Oops.
8463.88s: Now I know.
8466.88s: That between here.
8470.88s: Which is fed.
8475.88s: Somewhere in here.
8478.88s: The end of fab he had these 15 Jan 21s.
8481.88s: So the end of fab, which is here.
8486.88s: Let me zoom in.
8490.88s: End of fab is right here.
8493.88s: So at the end of fab, he still had these 15 Jan 21s.
8500.88s: And then I know within.
8503.88s: The 14th.
8506.88s: Was there not a March update?
8509.88s: Did I miss a March update?
8512.88s: So there's no no March update.
8514.88s: It's just April.
8516.88s: So then by the 14th of April.
8520.88s: Here.
8522.88s: He sold some.
8532.88s: And this is still a little bit before I can look in on demand and think or swim.
8538.88s: I can figure out.
8541.88s: I can figure out if we want you tell me if we want to know what the options were trading for here.
8548.88s: I can.
8550.88s: I can find what those Jan.
8560.88s: I can find what these were at.
8564.88s: So we got them for 47 cents.
8568.88s: For 44 cents.
8578.88s: Yeah, so we got in at 44 cents.
8583.88s: When did these Jan's get added though 15 Jan?
8586.88s: They're there.
8589.88s: So this is one of those first tranches.
8592.88s: I think.
8593.88s: Yeah, 15 Jan.
8594.88s: They're there.
8598.88s: 15 Jan. They're there.
8599.88s: So this goes all the way back.
8601.88s: These are like some of the first positions he got into 11 December 19.
8607.88s: 15 Jan.
8608.88s: Yep.
8609.88s: So this might be like one of those literally the first positions he put on.
8612.88s: Yep.
8613.88s: These are the first positions I see.
8614.88s: So these are from all the way back September 8th.
8617.88s: So the reason why that matters is because we go back.
8622.88s: The September 8th wherever these were added.
8630.88s: He would have made some money, but he actually wouldn't have made a ton of money on those January calls.
8638.88s: So I'm actually really interested in understanding a little bit more about the sale decision there.
8647.88s: Because he still had time left on those options.
8651.88s: So that's that's just an interesting point.
8656.88s: That's a really interesting point.
8663.88s: We still have to get a catch up here.
8667.88s: Okay.
8668.88s: And 2025 2020 or a higher.
8670.88s: Man, we made it through a lot of these April.
8673.88s: May.
8675.88s: This is all.
8678.88s: Okay, so this is where we're right now.
8683.88s: Interesting.
8685.88s: We can kill that.
8691.88s: So we're going to have to get to the end of May.
8694.88s: Let's move this.
8696.88s: May 30th.
8699.88s: We'll go.
8701.88s: Oh, fuck.
8703.88s: My bad.
8705.88s: That's fine.
8707.88s: We have to go to May.
8709.88s: Okay.
8710.88s: So we'll have to get to the end of May.
8711.88s: Let's move this.
8712.88s: May 30th.
8714.88s: We'll go.
8716.88s: Oh, fuck.
8717.88s: My bad.
8718.88s: That's fine.
8720.88s: We have to go to May here.
8735.88s: Okay.
8749.88s: Okay.
8755.88s: This looks like.
8757.88s: Yeah, this is 2024.
8759.88s: Yo, let me go back.
8761.88s: Oh, it's doing this weird shit again.
8764.88s: June.
8765.88s: Let's try June to June.
8768.88s: Damn it.
8772.88s: It was going so well.
8775.88s: I had the I had all the rules quirks figured out.
8778.88s: I'm sure the plan is going to be in the next one.
8781.88s: I'm sure it's going to be in the next one.
8784.88s: And then that's fine.
8787.88s: Start from right there.
8789.88s: And then this will be 2020 now.
8792.88s: And we need to go to May.
8796.88s: Not let me do it.
8797.88s: Damn it.
8800.88s: Maybe I'll try just doing 2020.
8807.88s: What the slash is in there.
8809.88s: You bastards.
8811.88s: Let's try that.
8812.88s: And then we'll try to go.
8814.88s: To 2020 here.
8817.88s: And let's try to go to like the end of June.
8822.88s: Well, let me.
8825.88s: What the hell.
8833.88s: I'm going to do this.
8839.88s: Damn it.
8841.88s: Why won't you let me do this?
8844.88s: Maybe I'll go to like May.
8846.88s: Damn it.
8847.88s: Damn it.
8849.88s: Damn it.
8851.88s: Damn it.
8852.88s: Damn it.
8853.88s: All right.
8854.88s: So then I guess what I'll just do is.
8857.88s: See if it'll let me look at like 2020 and total or something.
8861.88s: Nope.
8862.88s: I'll just refresh and go back in time.
8872.88s: Yeah.
8873.88s: And then I can just scroll on zoom in.
8875.88s: This is fine.
8885.88s: And I not do a one daily interval.
8888.88s: Okay.
8891.88s: All right.
8892.88s: So let's go back.
8894.88s: I think we're on a now.
8896.88s: 22.
8897.88s: 21.
8898.88s: 20.
8899.88s: Okay.
8900.88s: Cool.
8901.88s: We're back at it.
8902.88s: A little technical difficulties with this platform.
8905.88s: But we got it.
8906.88s: Okay.
8907.88s: So now it's the end of May.
8910.88s: And we have shares now.
8913.88s: At 406.
8914.88s: And as we pointed out, this is obviously.
8917.88s: Before we had the split.
8919.88s: So this would be split adjusted.
8921.88s: And.
8923.88s: We have July.
8926.88s: 20 calls at six and 12.
8930.88s: So he's still going really far out of the money.
8932.88s: He's buying cheap options.
8936.88s: 150 grand 88K and cash.
8939.88s: So.
8941.88s: He's over half cash.
8944.88s: So here you go.
8945.88s: So.
8951.88s: Yes, I took some profits the same day.
8954.88s: Burry as it turned out.
8955.88s: Been buying the recent dip.
8956.88s: New strikes.
8957.88s: Explorations.
8959.88s: Robo says that he exercise.
8961.88s: I don't think so.
8962.88s: The thing is is for people that buy calls.
8965.88s: It is generally inefficient to exercise.
8968.88s: You normally don't want to.
8970.88s: There's only like specific circumstances where it would be logical
8974.88s: to get a new one.
8977.88s: So now end of June.
8982.88s: Interesting.
8984.88s: All right.
8985.88s: I'm going to take a note so that I can pause us here.
8988.88s: And then we'll pick up on this.
8990.88s: The last thing because.
8991.88s: I have to hop off in a few minutes.
8993.88s: But what I want to do is just take a quick look at GameStop as it
8997.88s: sits today.
8998.88s: So that we don't run out of time for that.
9001.88s: And I'll take a note on June 2020.
9006.88s: Yolo update.
9008.88s: Left off.
9011.88s: RK positions.
9014.88s: Part two.
9015.88s: So then I'll set a note for myself.
9019.88s: That essentially come back here.
9021.88s: And then next weekend.
9023.88s: We'll finish going through.
9026.88s: This.
9028.88s: I do want to make.
9031.88s: Time.
9034.88s: At a link.
9037.88s: There you go.
9039.88s: Well.
9041.88s: Chris says, how many viewers did you have at your peak on this live stream?
9045.88s: Yeah, let's see.
9046.88s: It looks like we're a little bit lighter now because we've gone through for a hot
9051.88s: minute.
9052.88s: Looks like like 230.
9053.88s: I think is what we hit at the max.
9056.88s: So now.
9062.88s: Mister, Mr. Demel.
9066.88s: Great to see you, by the way.
9068.88s: It's been a minute.
9069.88s: You have a 230.
9070.88s: All right, so.
9071.88s: Oh boy.
9072.88s: That was a mistake.
9073.88s: Sorry.
9074.88s: So now.
9075.88s: Let's take a look at.
9077.88s: What this looks like.
9079.88s: Um.
9082.88s: Let's take a look at what this looks like today.
9085.88s: We're a lot lighter now.
9087.88s: We're a lot lighter now.
9091.88s: I'm going to make sure that we have a couple of options.
9095.88s: Chains.
9096.88s: Now we're coming into earnings.
9099.88s: A BH Mordox says you miss like seven Chicago peeps.
9103.88s: Yeah, let me add them really quick.
9105.88s: I have.
9107.88s: Don't you worry.
9109.88s: I have our handy dandy map ready to go.
9112.88s: Got it. And then Toledo got it.
9118.88s: Holy Toledo. I don't really know where that saying comes from.
9124.12s: Perfect. So we got those two at it. Thanks for the heads up.
9128.48s: All right, let's take a look at some GameStop as it sits today.
9133.04s: So it has earnings coming up. It's still currently holding for 10th after the close.
9141.08s: And right now for me, it's in a very heavy consolidation.
9147.56s: Now I did tell you that I would talk a little bit about how I traded it for this move.
9153.24s: So essentially what happened when we started seeing those trades come through it like 840 to 850.
9162.28s: I started building a position not for the front week because I actually was expecting to run
9167.80s: this position for a little bit longer than I ended up running it.
9171.32s: But what I wanted to do is gain exposure to the near term momentum that I was expecting in GameStop
9177.88s: after seeing those two trades come through. So it was like the very, very beginning part of building
9183.64s: a position. So what I ended up doing, this is my pass through account. So there's nothing in here.
9188.12s: But what I ended up doing was going out past past earnings, but not out too far because I really wanted
9196.92s: to try to just let these options compound a little bit because I already have a little bit of
9201.96s: a longer term position. So what I did was I went out into the 20 step and I went slightly in the money.
9208.76s: So I bought two different tranches of those like right around like 850, 855.
9215.88s: And then I sold one of those tranches, essentially 915 when I saw this start coming down and I still have
9224.44s: another one of those tranches that I'm expecting to hopefully hold on to for a little bit.
9231.08s: But it's mostly going to be a like tightly managed trade because they're still showing a profit right
9237.72s: now. And if we have a gap down, I probably would exit those because they're a little short term
9242.60s: for me. I prefer slightly longer term options. But that's essentially how I played this like just
9248.28s: near term pop that was relatively small. Um,
9255.88s: Dom says Eric YouTube ringdinger, I have said I could too and it's supposed to help tremendously.
9260.36s: Yeah, I'll definitely take a look. Thank you. I yeah, like I said, I had that MRI
9265.72s: Friday. So I think I'm probably going to try to get that quarterstone shot or something.
9270.52s: That's the idea right now. So we have Minnesota that we have to add. And then we also have
9276.68s: Arizona. My brother is in Flagstaff. We have to add that. Then we have Ireland. That's actually
9283.32s: on our travel list. I had a road trip planned out for us, essentially going from
9289.48s: Bell faster Dublin and going along all the way along the coast down here. So that might be
9296.60s: that might be on our on our radar.
9298.76s: Uh, Inder says Vancouver. Yeah, let's grab Vancouver. I was just there not too long ago.
9307.64s: I like Vancouver quite a lot. A lot of drug people. Um, Maria, you could tan.
9319.16s: We got our Mexican peeps here. Sweet. Building our chart out. All right. So
9327.88s: so earnings coming up. Let's take a look at these options. 240. So massive, massive,
9333.72s: massive, massive call skew right now, massive call skew. And it looks like a lot of them now are
9344.76s: just from a volume perspective, just tons of calls traded. This is obviously on Friday.
9349.80s: And then open interest. We had left off at 537 to 266. So we had a lot come out, but my guesses
9358.04s: will see a lot coming in because when I look at this, my guess is most of these, you know,
9366.52s: 13-septraids were probably opening positions to gain exposure for the next trading week. That's
9371.64s: what I'm expecting most of these to be opening up. So then looking at the vol, we have
9380.04s: pretty high vol 18837 for the front expiration. It's not astronomical. And then it drops off 155133. So
9388.68s: definitely seeing some earnings of all being priced in. And if we take a look at this chain before
9394.52s: everything from last week cycles over, we have a bit of depth at the 24th. The 22 and a half
9402.04s: got hit with a lot of volume previously, not a lot of change in OI. So this will be a lot of
9410.44s: building volume, I think. And then I see same thing for the 23s. There's more volume than OI. So
9420.04s: people are building into those. I see the same thing here for the 24s. Definitely the same thing for
9425.80s: the 25s. So there are a lot of people building out in this 13-sept expiration. And if I take a look
9433.40s: from the put side, it's not quite the same style of build out, but they're definitely as put
9438.12s: build out as well. So let's take a look at just the vol's surface really quick at a curiosity.
9447.32s: And then I want to use just these front ones. So I'm still not seeing that same style of really,
9457.16s: really massive volatility skewed to the upside. So that will happen sometimes in GameStop
9463.72s: specifically, but I'm not necessarily seeing that here. I do see this kind of peak. This is just
9473.24s: again, like a tradable relative value thing at 1550. So that would be on the put side. And
9484.36s: yeah, so the vol otherwise looks fairly normal with a little bit more tail side. But if you take a
9490.36s: look at 20 sep, it's the inverse. This is actually the interesting thing. So normally, this is what
9496.92s: you'll see for a volatility smile. This is kind of a surface because there's multiple lines,
9501.16s: but this is more of a smile. And this is just looking at the put side because we're looking at
9508.60s: the out of the monies. And you'll see that the put side is pretty high. And the highest put side
9514.76s: is higher than the highest call side, right? So then when I look down this, though, I can see for the
9521.88s: what is this? The the 20 sep expiration. It's actually a slightly different story. And we see
9530.36s: that the call side actually exceeds the put side, which is just generally interesting. That's
9538.04s: typically the market pricing in a bit more of an upside move. And we can see that the strikes out
9543.08s: here right now are going out to the 50 on the 20 seps. So it doesn't look like they have the
9549.88s: let me do all of these really quick. Yeah. So that right now the strikes out there are only going
9554.92s: out to 50. They're not doing like the 125 to the 150s again. So Tanner says regarding potential
9562.92s: D.F.V. pump and dump is a reasonable to think that the participant with short exposure that
9567.96s: doesn't want it to pop would short those calls are not no, they wouldn't short the calls because
9575.00s: by shorting the calls themselves, they kind of put themselves if they don't want something to pump
9582.76s: quote unquote, they really would put themselves in a disadvantageous spot. And it's also not enough
9589.88s: to really offset that because when somebody buys those calls that are at the money, the market
9596.84s: makers are going to see the order come through before it's on, right? So the ones fulfilling the order.
9602.68s: So they would either decide do they want to run with them or do they want to hedge the trade and
9606.84s: they probably would hedge the trade. And because it was a short term thing, they probably would
9611.00s: have used stock. But right now there's still an abundance of stock in GameStop. So yeah, I don't
9619.24s: I don't really think that that's what we saw on the opposite side there. I my best guesses from
9626.44s: that trade. It looks like whoever bought them unwound them. That's what it looks like. And again,
9631.16s: that's why it's slightly confusing to me. Because the person I would assume to buy them would be
9638.84s: roaring kitty, but that I wouldn't assume that to be his move just looked insignificant at best
9647.08s: for somebody like him. So not so sure. Now coming into earnings though, if we take a look at
9655.32s: some of GameStop's previous earnings moves. And we can see that it tends to maintain some level
9666.52s: of risk premiums. And I see so from this is me talking as Eric the options trader.
9673.48s: This is a normal event that I try to trade earnings releases. And this earnings got all messed up.
9683.16s: This earnings has pretty elevated vol 120%. But it's not as high as some of these other vols.
9691.32s: 140. So my guess is the vols here might come up a bit. But it typically maintains risk premiums
9704.20s: through. So yeah, this is interesting from a volatility trading perspective. Let me look at one
9711.24s: other tool really quick.
9720.68s: They have like a slightly tricky login process. So I have to get like a verification.
9739.56s: I we in let's take a look at GameStop. Then let's take a look at earnings.
9747.48s: Okay, so it's average implied move is 12.9% and it's average actual move is 13.5. This is for
9754.76s: the past 12 earnings releases. And it tends to fall within range for the expected move.
9763.64s: Except for the last one. Because the last one got so contorted with the timing in June.
9768.92s: So right now it's implying what do we see like almost an 11 or 12% move something like that.
9785.08s: So I mean, this looks like a really interesting earnings trade. For me, the approach here is kind of
9791.96s: standard fair. It'll be maintained exposure via the long shares. Play the options if they start
9797.16s: coming alive. It's a little early, but I see a few things going on that make me happy. I see a big,
9804.28s: big bump in buy volume, right? If you take a look at this candle, take a look at the volume on that
9810.20s: day. Again, when we go back to all of these prior really big moves, there are things like this.
9818.36s: So if I look at the volume that we saw on Friday, it was 24 million, right? And the 20 day average
9826.36s: was 6.5 million. The five day average was 12 million. So it's essentially double the average volume
9833.32s: for five days and a drop almost not quite triple plus on the average for 20 for 20 days.
9841.88s: So if we take a look at some of these preceding kind of jumps that we've seen just in terms of volume
9847.88s: that's starting to get interesting. So I'm really, really curious how this volume plays out.
9854.44s: Some of it will be for earning. Some of it will be from that news, but it wouldn't surprise me
9860.20s: to see some level of follow through because again, like these kinds of jumps in volume mostly
9866.20s: buy side volume starts to again, peak my interest. I also see from a general oscillator perspective,
9873.08s: all the oscillators are starting to ascend. So it looks like it is starting to grab a little bit of
9879.40s: traction just in terms of developing a level of momentum. So yeah, I mean, it looks interesting.
9888.84s: I need to see what the options look like once the volume from last week is factored in,
9894.68s: but it looks like most of the people are positioning for this coming week. So we have to see how earnings
9899.88s: go, but I am absolutely excited to see it. All right, gang, I think this is my longest stream I've
9906.68s: ever done almost three hours, but it goes by in a blast for me. I love talking about this stuff.
9911.96s: I love exploring the market and specifically GameStop with the apes out there. So thank you
9919.56s: for taking the time to teach me a little bit more about this and help me explore it. It's super,
9924.36s: super fun. I love doing it. So thanks everybody for hanging out. We had over 200 people, which is so
9930.20s: sick. Love that. I hope everybody has an absolutely awesome weekend. And as you know, I do live streams
9936.76s: every single day at 5 p.m. Pacific time. So I will see you at another live stream. Catch you all
9943.00s: later. Be an outlier. See you guys.
