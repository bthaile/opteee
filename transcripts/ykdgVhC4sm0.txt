0.00s: No position update from roaring kitty, but a fascinating day in the options chain.
7.40s: I want to walk through the position that he has and what it looks like today, even though
11.08s: we haven't seen the latest.
13.00s: I'm going off of what he shared previously, but then I definitely want to dive into what
17.36s: I'm seeing in the options chain because there's some really, really interesting activity
21.08s: that can have some pretty significant implications for what we're seeing in GameStop.
25.76s: So let's dive right in.
27.56s: Right now what I've done is kind of crossed out the last prices and updated with what they
32.28s: are as of now, even though technically GameStop is right around 26 after hours.
36.48s: It closed at 2546.
37.96s: So left it there.
39.48s: And then the 20 calls that he has, they're trading for 635.
43.84s: This is the mid price.
45.64s: This is really important to drive home.
47.68s: This mid price is not what he would get if he chose to close all 120,000 of these calls
56.40s: because as he starts unwinding this, the market would start to move.
62.12s: So what that means is I'm quoting it at the mid point.
66.88s: That's not what he actually would be able to execute at.
69.96s: That doesn't mean that he would be completely eviscerated and not be able to make a market.
74.60s: Obviously, the market makers will provide a market, but it's just important to note that
78.08s: this would look slightly different if he chooses to liquidate the position all at once,
81.80s: which I don't imagine he would do.
84.04s: He's done things in phases so far and it also seems like he seems to prefer to exercise
89.48s: his options, which is another interesting layer to this.
92.72s: So taking a look at the 5 million shares at 21274.
98.12s: Right now, those would be worth about 20.9 million and these long calls would be worth
104.56s: about 8.1 million.
106.96s: So that takes his PNL to about 29 million bucks unrealized on these positions.
112.72s: And he still would presumably have the 29.4 million in cash.
118.36s: So we did get to see a couple hilarious memes from him today.
122.12s: We got this one from the office.
124.28s: We have the GameStop logo and then the kitty in the pocket over here and then a sweet
128.04s: mullet.
129.04s: And then over here, we have the unbelievable humor of breaking news on CNBC with our boy,
139.32s: her and kitty just chilling in his chair.
141.32s: And the beginning of this video is epic.
143.56s: It's the clip from Inglorious Bastards where the dude says, you know, this might be my
148.24s: masterpiece.
149.24s: It's, yeah, couldn't agree more.
151.72s: This is a masterpiece.
153.56s: So let's take a look at the options chain because this is where things start to get a
159.84s: bit interesting.
161.68s: If we take a look at the volume, which to be clear, volume is different than open interest.
167.20s: Then interests are contracts that are currently open.
171.08s: It means that there's a buyer and seller on both sides of that contract.
176.56s: Volume are the number of contracts traded in a day.
180.20s: So this volume could represent buying contracts and opening new ones.
184.52s: This can also represent closing contracts where volume can lead to a decrease in OI, which
191.40s: is actually what I think might be happening here to some degree.
194.76s: Now, the 21 June 24th, this is where I'm kitty's chain right now.
199.80s: And I do believe it's his chain.
202.04s: And if you look through the volume for today, let's take a scan down together.
205.88s: I see 21, 339, 797, pretty big number, 761, 93,266.
217.40s: Keep going.
218.40s: 588, 5892, so on and so forth.
222.88s: The next largest volume for today was at 27182 volume, which is at the 30.
232.44s: And then we see out to the 35, 8628.
236.96s: Now from an options trading perspective, this is always funny because this is anchoring.
241.28s: Human beings like round numbers.
242.76s: So you'll notice that the 30s have more volume in OI.
246.00s: That's kind of standard fare.
249.32s: Humans are pretty predictable in that sense.
251.32s: It's kind of interesting.
252.64s: It's actually what makes options so interesting is that you can pick up on a lot of these
256.32s: small behaviors and actually trade them.
258.80s: Now this is interesting.
260.72s: This amount of volume is anomalous.
263.00s: And if we take a look at the existing open interest, it's 169,963 contracts.
271.36s: So it's really difficult to say whether or not this is Kitty starting to unwind, even
277.52s: if this was all his volume, which I absolutely do not think it is, it still would leave a
281.92s: lot of his position open.
283.68s: My guess is this would be a mix of people involved, transacting.
288.24s: And what could be happening here is some of that cashless exercise that we talked about.
294.68s: And really all that is is a method for him to capitalize on some of the PNL of his
300.00s: options position because even though it's not a massive PNL, he's still up $8.1 million.
306.04s: So he could always essentially trade even half of this position, 60,000, he could then
312.96s: take the 4 million that he would generate from that and use that 4 million to buy shares
319.28s: at spot price.
320.88s: Now we can confirm a little bit more of that if we take a look at the stock volume for
325.36s: today, which is mostly sale volume.
328.56s: The vast majority of the volume that we saw today was on the sell side.
334.20s: So if we zoom in on this bar, it looks about 140 of that is sale volume.
342.64s: So again, kind of the majority there.
345.84s: So what does this mean for roaring Kitty's position?
349.32s: Well, as far as I can tell, a few things could be happening.
354.40s: The first one, like we talked about, cashless exercise, I do think that could be on the
359.40s: table for him because we know he does not have the free cash in order to generate probably
364.96s: the size of the long shares he would want to hold.
368.68s: The other thing that could be happening that I'm not convinced is happening yet is if
374.72s: we look through the other options chains, I don't see corresponding volume.
381.64s: So even if we take a subset of this 93 and assume 30 or 60 of it is his, if I go out
388.20s: to the 19 July expiration and I look at the volume for today, I don't see enough volume that
394.52s: would add up to anything kind of close to his size unless he's a much smaller subset of
399.80s: that, which he could be.
401.04s: He could be unwinding in 10,000 lot blocks.
406.48s: And that actually seems to be probably what he did to enter, although he definitely had
410.40s: some larger blocks to get into the position.
413.04s: Now you might be asking, why am I using these expiration?
415.76s: These are the standard expirations as compared to the weekly.
418.32s: There's more liquidity in here.
420.20s: So to prove that point, if we come here to this nine days to expiration, we go to the
426.60s: at the money strike right now, the 26 is there are 58 delta and there are five cents wide.
434.00s: If we go out here to the next expiration, we use the at the money.
438.68s: You'll notice how much wider all of these are.
442.08s: And that's for a reason.
443.28s: It's because there's less people in these expiration cycles.
446.72s: If you take a look at the open interest, it's still, there's still open interest there
450.44s: to be clear, but it's nowhere near as much as you'll see in the primary expiration cycles.
454.72s: And that's almost always going to be the case.
456.60s: Unless there's an event or something like that that would funnel people into a specific
460.08s: expiration, people are looking for liquidity, especially larger traders.
463.96s: They're trying to transact at the fairest prices available.
466.92s: So now, if we go out here, we looked at the 19 July, if we go out here to the 16 aug,
471.88s: and I start looking through, the volume for today is still not that impressive.
477.52s: Now these two block trades, these are interesting to me.
483.00s: And it's because they're a very similar size, 1,786, 1,785.
488.16s: However, based on what I've seen so far from roaring kitty, he kind of keeps his position
492.64s: super simple.
493.64s: If you'll notice he has two positions.
496.20s: He has a shares and then one expiration.
498.64s: So I'm not convinced that this would be him either.
501.52s: He doesn't seem like he was going to go to the 26 and the 27.
504.56s: Again, not outside the room of possibility, but it's just not what I'm seeing so far.
508.56s: All I can say definitively, as of this point, is something's happening here.
513.00s: There's no doubt.
513.76s: 93,000 volume in these contracts is not insignificant.
519.68s: And if we just do the math on this, we know 120,000 of these were his.
525.92s: So just following the logic here, that means some of these probably are his.
535.24s: If this turns out to be a mix and a mix of buy and sell volume, there could be the alternate scenario
545.24s: where this is just a bunch of buys could be.
551.48s: And if this is a bunch of buys, that means none of this might be unwound.
557.00s: And that means most of this might be positive change in open interest adding to the position.
563.40s: So what I'm trying to highlight here is that you can't definitively tell from what you see
568.36s: from at least this picture so far.
570.80s: Again, what I can tell, something's happening in this strike, which is interesting,
575.28s: because it's his, this is a giant amount of volume relative to what I've seen at least so far.
582.40s: This could be a mix of buy and sell volume, which means it could be kitty unwinding some of his position
590.00s: to either buy more shares, or it could be him rolling out in time, or it could be a bunch of people
595.48s: getting into the trade, or it could be a mix of both of those where most of that volume is a bunch
599.68s: of people getting into the trade.
600.72s: And maybe he's unwinding some of it, or maybe he just bought a bunch more.
604.92s: We won't know until tomorrow. It's too early.
607.00s: But we were following the bread crumbs, eagerly awaiting his next update.
611.52s: I got to say because it would make all this investigative work much easier,
614.56s: but I am just too interested to not continue following this long on a daily basis.
618.44s: It's way too fascinating.
619.60s: So I want to thank you all again for sharing your community with me.
622.44s: The apes have been so cool.
624.16s: I'm getting a chance to learn so much about this saga.
626.44s: It's a blast.
627.36s: I've been in markets for 16 years.
629.00s: There's just not too many instances to see really, really interesting things like this happening,
633.92s: especially with options, which is kind of where I tend to operate.
637.20s: So I'm having an absolute ball learning alongside you guys.
640.84s: If you have any questions, throw them in the comments.
643.08s: I'll see you guys later.
