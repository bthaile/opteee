0.84s: what's up everyone quick market update
3.04s: then I'm going to talk about some gme
5.44s: updates as well we did have an
7.24s: expiration cycle today that we need to
9.04s: take a look at because we have some
11.36s: interesting options activity nothing and
14.20s: I'm really against being hyperbolic and
16.96s: what I talk about it's nothing insane
19.20s: but there are things that I kind of
22.36s: caught which we have a handful of large
25.24s: transactions coming through so we'll
27.04s: take a look at that in just one second
29.48s: but I want to show you some broader
31.48s: economic data really fast I did this
33.80s: yesterday and it's mostly because I am a
37.00s: Trader RIT large I'm very interested in
39.08s: what's going on with GameStop obviously
41.48s: but I also think it's important to share
43.68s: some of the other Market effects going
45.68s: on right now because there's just a lot
48.92s: going on and it's good to be aware
50.44s: whether you just want to trade GameStop
51.96s: or you want to learn about other things
53.76s: I think it's worthwhile so long story
56.48s: short we're seeing a couple big things
58.88s: happen primarily
60.56s: CPI came out yesterday and it came in a
64.32s: little bit hot then we have PPI come out
67.24s: today and it was forecasted at 2.3% came
70.76s: in at
71.76s: 2.6% and we also had the Michigan
74.64s: sentiment come out this is kind of like
76.20s: a macroeconomic assessment and that came
78.92s: in light so it was expected at 68 and a
81.20s: half came in at 66 all of this matters
84.16s: because right now from a broad Market
85.96s: perspective we care so much about the
88.56s: right environment and when we think we
91.64s: might be seeing a cut so there's
94.52s: actually a really cool tool you can use
96.48s: Bond Futures and bonds themselves if
98.64s: you're inclined to calculate the
101.44s: Market's perception and probability of a
105.24s: perspective cut but you can also use
107.08s: this tool here and it's called the FED
108.92s: watch tool it's very very cool and
111.52s: really I just want to show you this
112.76s: really quick if you compare the
114.88s: probabilities it shows you uh different
117.44s: time frames so this shows you the
119.36s: current probability this shows you from
121.20s: a day ago a week ago a month ago and
124.56s: this is specifically what I want to show
127.12s: you if you go to 18 September the
131.24s: probability of a cut has
134.16s: skyrocketed this is something to be
136.32s: aware of because if we do get a cut the
139.84s: probability is for you to see things
142.44s: like small caps in bonds go up and
146.48s: that's what we're already starting to
147.96s: see so you can see that the Russell
150.52s: which is the Russell 2000 Index has gone
153.76s: off off the chain this is a freaking
157.52s: index and it's gone up essentially from
161.12s: 2036 to 2163 in 3 days that is a massive
166.60s: move you do not see things like this
168.52s: happen frequently this is a huge
170.88s: money-making opportunity that's what it
172.68s: boils down to and if we take a look at
174.08s: TLT it's a similar story over the last 3
176.96s: days it's had relative to what it is a
179.92s: very big move so I just want you guys to
182.04s: be aware of those things as you go
184.52s: throughout the rest of your weekend
186.52s: planning trades and stuff like that but
188.32s: let's get into the bell of the ball what
190.44s: most people are interested in which is
192.52s: GameStop so let me Zoom this in a little
195.08s: bit like 6mon daily a couple things this
198.88s: positive drift continues I talked about
201.60s: this not too long ago if I go into like
203.88s: a 30-day 4H hour chart notice again I
208.40s: keep talking about this term low that we
210.36s: saw on the 1st of July and we've just
212.52s: kind of been slowly building up now
215.20s: there was a couple comments in my last
216.68s: video where people are like don't look
218.04s: at the price the price is fake and I
220.36s: understand their perspective I know why
221.80s: they think that it's still important to
223.76s: look at the price now as I always say I
227.16s: think attempting to apply standard
229.00s: technical analysis in something like
230.44s: GameStop is silly because that's not
233.12s: what makes it special and I've said that
234.64s: a million times I'm not going to belabor
236.28s: that point further but I don't think
239.36s: it's good to get too binary in your
242.84s: assessment of information as a Trader so
245.36s: what that means is because some people
247.76s: think the price is so heavily
249.32s: manipulated that it's it's fake what
252.04s: they miss is that while the manipulation
254.60s: of those things might be happening it it
256.04s: doesn't mean just throw the price out
257.88s: entirely never look at it I get their
260.40s: perspective but like I try to remind
262.92s: people in general kind of finding a
264.80s: balance is really useful I find in
267.68s: trading so I just encourage people to
269.44s: kind of consider that even with
271.20s: something like GameStop which again I'm
273.16s: on the same page as you guys with a lot
274.72s: of things there are a lot of very
276.52s: squirly things going on and it's
279.16s: actually something that Newton and I are
280.44s: going to talk about more tomorrow during
282.80s: our next live stream together which will
284.68s: be at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time same time
286.60s: same place as last week and this one
289.28s: will be probably like a 2our long
290.84s: session so I'm excited to get further
292.36s: into detail because there is a lot going
294.36s: on here I'm just encouraging people
296.32s: don't just throw out information because
298.68s: you think it's so manipulated that it's
300.80s: completely fake you miss some details
303.04s: which are kind of useful to see which
305.00s: another interesting detail we saw volume
309.48s: die off today yet price didn't crater
313.24s: yet again so this floor still continues
316.52s: to be respected to some degree and when
318.96s: I say floor I'm not saying any sort of
320.64s: price or line on the chart I just mean
322.92s: that again if people really wanted to
324.92s: bury this thing and try shorting it into
326.80s: the dirt they're not doing it because
329.96s: I'm not seeing any volume stepping up to
331.68s: a big degree here and I'm not seeing
333.32s: massive sale volume even today it was
336.28s: what
337.32s: 39% sale volume it it's I it's just not
342.64s: an overwhelming amount of sale volume
344.48s: coming in which I still continue to find
346.36s: slightly intriguing and we're coming
348.08s: into a really important expiration cycle
350.44s: way more important in my opinion than
352.48s: today's and the reason being is because
354.16s: these weekly expirations as I've said a
355.84s: lot tend to be quiet and notice what
358.40s: happened here the volatility for next
362.20s: week's expiration cycle is jacking way
366.88s: up way up it's now up to almost 140%
370.88s: this was down not that long ago so the
373.96s: market is starting to build a little bit
376.32s: of an anticipation for this coming
378.60s: expiration cycle not so much out here in
382.20s: the 16 Aug just yet that's still
384.16s: hovering around like 121 it's still much
386.60s: higher than the surrounding expiration
388.32s: Cycles again like this is telling
390.32s: information from a trading perspective
392.04s: from a it's specifically an options
393.64s: trading perspective you can pull out a
395.76s: lot of details of what the market is
397.96s: expecting to happen based on how it's
399.60s: pricing volatility volatility is an
401.72s: expectation of movement so when we see
404.96s: volatility on a relative basis to this
406.80s: time frame being this much higher than
408.32s: these other two that tells you Market is
410.96s: saying H I'm expecting bigger movement
414.08s: in this expiration cycle as compared to
416.28s: 9 Aug or 23 Aug well sometimes you might
419.76s: infer well maybe there's earnings in
421.12s: there well we know that's not the case
422.20s: it just had earnings so that tells you
423.96s: the market is seeing something here what
426.48s: exactly we don't know yet of not knowing
430.56s: there was a big old trade that came
432.76s: through today so the 16 a 2430 calls we
436.84s: saw 998 of those and this was a sale
441.36s: they came in they were uh picked up at
444.04s: 263 and that's where the bid was so it
446.76s: came in right at the bid again the
448.68s: expectation there
450.08s: is that this is a sale position but the
452.88s: notional value of this trade is over
456.96s: $200,000
459.16s: $262,000 so this is somebody collecting
461.76s: a decent amount of money is what this is
464.28s: and it could be part of covered calls
467.04s: that's not a bad Payday for essentially
470.44s: a month of perspective holding even up
473.52s: to 30 it's A4 million dollars right
476.04s: there so somebody is kind of picking up
478.68s: a decent chunk of ch there you can
480.40s: speculate who or what that might be I
483.88s: genuinely don't know that's not like
485.04s: some sort of hidden message I know you
486.44s: guys are really good at looking for
487.64s: those that's not to infer I think that
489.28s: that's RK although it absolutely could
491.56s: be I genuinely have no clue who that is
495.20s: this is also a fascinating trade so we
498.68s: had
500.56s: 546 come in at the 20 call 16 Aug so
504.60s: again 546 *
507.20s: 675 it's a 36 $8,000 trade same
512.04s: expiration same sell side so again
515.92s: expectation of downside and then take a
517.52s: look at these the 16 Jan 26 20 calls
523.04s: 483 of those and those came in at
527.56s: 1330 it's a
529.40s: $642,000 position what I'm showing you
531.36s: is that there's money moving in here
533.52s: it's very clear and look there's even
534.92s: more down here at the 16 Jan 26's so
540.12s: there's activity this is pretty Lively
542.80s: in terms of total position sizing that
544.72s: we've seen lately so I think that that's
547.52s: worth at least highlighting again
549.88s: inferring what this precisely translates
552.20s: over into it's a little bit early to
554.32s: tell in my opinion but there's activity
556.76s: which to me in and of itself is pretty
558.56s: good so you can see from unusual whales
562.20s: here they kind of a breakdown of the
564.68s: premium transactions I'll get rid of the
566.68s: bids for now which means uh transactions
569.88s: that we think occurred somewhere on the
573.28s: cell side and just take a look at the
575.32s: pickups so we do have those 16 genan 26
579.48s: that one we were just talking about
580.76s: $642,000 at the 20s we have the 177 Jan
585.40s: 25s the 20s again that's a $500,000
588.72s: trade we have the 20s again in 16 gen 26
593.08s: this is another
594.88s: $333,000 trade you start looking at the
597.52s: numbers between these they're not far
600.08s: apart at all in terms of when they were
602.16s: filled 85450
605.44s: 85450 slightly different sizes almost a
609.32s: million
610.80s: dollar Furious to me pretty far out
614.00s: though so these are definitely long
617.28s: Runway style trades but the 20s are
619.40s: getting hit across a bunch of different
622.44s: expirations there's a lot of expectation
625.72s: to the upside occurring here so if we go
628.76s: down now now to see our open interest
631.72s: the call side is opening up a little bit
633.44s: compared to the put side again the puts
635.20s: were about 500,000 yesterday it's a
636.84s: little bit higher like 525 now whatever
639.36s: but these ticked up 94,000 as compared
642.52s: to the 800,000 so this is starting to
644.60s: widen out again into that kind of more
646.72s: persistent call leaning relationship
649.36s: that we've seen and if we take a look at
651.24s: the volume today we're back over
653.00s: $300,000 yesterday was very quiet it was
655.16s: under 200,000 contracts I think I said
657.40s: $300,000 I didn't mean that I meant cont
659.32s: contracts if I did who knows who knows
661.40s: what I'm saying anymore it's so hard to
663.16s: keep track of reality when you're
665.32s: looking at something like this because
666.80s: so much of this is just so so crazy um
671.64s: today 999,000 puts went out and the
675.84s: overwhelming majority of volume you can
678.60s: see is centered on today and then 19
681.96s: July take a look at these 19 July 30s
684.80s: 3,469 of them going off so there is this
688.92s: stand rotation that we've talked about
690.92s: before coming out into the next primary
692.92s: expiration cycle this here is becoming
695.92s: interesting to me the 30s now have
699.52s: 60,000 oi with an additional 30,000
703.04s: volume today over yesterday was
705.64s: 15,700 net positive ads to the contracts
708.52s: meaning opening positions so that's not
712.56s: an insignificant amount of activity we
715.24s: also have some of these further in the
717.20s: monies these 28,000 at the 25s with
719.84s: another eight coming in and then we have
722.08s: our homie out here that we picked up a
724.56s: little while ago all the way down at the
726.04s: 10 and he's still hanging out I can see
728.24s: his position right there so he's been
730.92s: kind of riding solo I just been keeping
732.68s: an eye on him because you know trying to
734.52s: keep him some company he's in all the
735.88s: way in there by himself and let's open
738.40s: this up all the way let's check the
739.52s: superar strikes and we see the same
742.04s: thing as usual the
745.16s: 125s have uh
747.32s: 56,000 contracts on them with
749.80s: 5600 traded today net positive over
753.20s: yesterday was 2700 So people still
754.88s: building a position here as I hear
756.96s: myself talking about this it almost
758.12s: sounds like I'm talking about the
759.12s: weather it's kind of funny but I'm
761.08s: literally talking about tens and
763.08s: hundreds of thousands of dollars being
764.64s: thrown around with uh a week to go and
768.32s: if they're out of the money they're
769.60s: worth nothing which is always always
771.88s: pretty fun about options if we think
773.60s: about it that's what makes them the
775.80s: special little things that they are so
778.12s: for me I took a few of my positions down
781.76s: today I had the 16 augs those came down
784.80s: because there was a decent price
786.76s: accommodation and then I have exposure
789.80s: now still via shares and then I'm out in
792.20s: 20 September and 18 October is where
794.48s: where I'm looking I didn't get a fill on
796.68s: the 18 Octobers it was a little too
798.52s: liquid but that's where I'm looking to
799.76s: go next so you know I'm playing along
802.68s: with it as it's continuing to move in
804.28s: this direction again I'm I'm a Trader
806.44s: I'm fascinated by the story but there
807.96s: are two different parts of my brains the
809.56s: Trader part of me is here to make money
811.00s: nothing more nothing less and then
812.84s: there's the just fascination with this
814.96s: whole Saga and the interest in the story
818.48s: itself which I don't see that dying off
820.84s: anytime soon but that's kind of the way
822.92s: I think about this thing the way I'm
824.64s: trading it is the way I trade anything
826.32s: which is with the pure intention of
828.16s: making money on the product so as always
831.76s: if there's any questions or anything you
833.16s: want me to take a look at people have
834.28s: been sending me emails with all
835.44s: different kinds of interesting things
836.80s: some of them are pretty crazy but I them
839.40s: all the same like I tell anybody I think
842.24s: it's important to be open to new
844.32s: information but that doesn't mean that
845.64s: we fully believe everything we see we're
848.40s: really good at looking for patterns the
850.44s: brain is primed to do those kinds of
852.28s: things that's actually why some people
853.44s: are really good at trading is because
854.72s: you can start to identify patterns but
858.00s: we have to at least for me I try to
861.28s: remain as objective as I possibly can in
864.08s: the evaluation of things so I love
867.08s: taking a look at the stuff that you guys
868.16s: are sending me I'm really really
869.36s: appreciative thank you so much for
871.40s: sharing more of the story and
872.84s: information with me if there's anything
874.04s: you want me to take a look at as always
875.36s: let me know be an outlier tune in
877.48s: tomorrow to the live stream with Newton
879.72s: I'll see you guys later
