0.00s: What's up outliers?
1.68s: We're going to talk about five options selling myths that are going to crush your returns
6.72s: or have been crushing your returns.
9.56s: We have five things on the docket.
11.40s: Now the main point of the video is to expose you to some really important concepts and
16.12s: more importantly to give you frameworks on how to think about them and how to approach
20.16s: them.
21.16s: So let's jump right in.
22.16s: The first thing is sell options when volatility is high.
25.80s: This is probably one of the most commonly used and misused concepts that exists and we
32.00s: need to talk about it.
33.72s: This entire idea is baked in this idea that options and specifically option volatility
40.92s: is mean reverting and I want to show you a little bit about what this mean reversion
47.68s: concept is.
49.80s: If I draw a plot of volatility and let's say that this line is going to be implied
57.40s: volatility and let's say that it runs like this and then it goes up here and then it's
61.68s: high.
63.40s: The issue with this idea of volatility being mean reverting is depending on the trade that
71.20s: you're running.
72.20s: Let's say it's a 30 day or a common 45 day strategy.
78.72s: This mean reversion doesn't have to happen in that timeframe.
84.92s: volatility does something we refer to as clustering.
88.72s: That means it can go through durations where it looks a lot like what it recently looks
95.64s: like before it goes through some sort of reversion process.
100.72s: The other thing to keep in mind is that if you are selling premium and some people will
107.92s: think that you're playing this Vega, meaning if implied volatility goes down, then some
113.60s: of your profit will come from this Vega, which is correct.
116.84s: But the dominant force in your strategy is still direction.
122.80s: It doesn't matter if IV collapses here and your Vega P&L looks good, but then the underlying
129.68s: just blasted right through your short strikes.
133.76s: You're still loose.
135.28s: Even though you got the movement involved that you wanted, you didn't get the price movement,
140.80s: which is a really, really common focus when we're two folks from the volatility side of
144.32s: this equation, which is important.
146.60s: But you have to remember the thing that makes or breaks your short premium strategy at the
150.52s: end of the day is not what Valdas, even if Vald for example, spiked and your Vega P&L
156.96s: looked bad.
158.44s: Evolves spiked, but price still, let's say price is this plot.
165.12s: And let's say price just trended sideways after that spike.
170.32s: You still would make money once this abates.
174.32s: So it's super important to keep that into context.
177.60s: Now the last few things that I want to mention with this idea of when Valdas High is a lot
183.64s: of times when Valdas High, it's actually not priced effectively.
190.04s: The thing that you are typically trading when you're selling premium is not Valdi-Rackley.
196.36s: You are trading the relationship between implied and realized volatility.
204.60s: Realize volatility is how much something actually moves and implied volatility is how
207.88s: much it's expected to move.
210.60s: In this case, we can see a period here.
212.76s: This is a great example.
213.96s: Look at these yellow lines.
216.28s: This represents implied volatility.
218.64s: Notice how if I just wiggle my mouse, you notice how this range that I'm in right here,
223.44s: it's kind of high compared to everything else on this graph.
226.32s: This period back here is the only period that's even remotely close.
229.56s: Everything else in this center zone is lower.
232.00s: This period here, volatility was high.
235.12s: But what do you notice about the purple lines?
236.88s: The purple lines measure variance risk premiums, where implied volatility stays elevated
245.04s: relative to realized.
246.32s: It actually flips negative.
248.64s: What that means is if you sold during this period, even though volatility was good,
253.72s: you got ran over by direction.
255.24s: You lost your money.
257.88s: That is the crux.
260.40s: That's the main issue when you stay too emphasized on vault.
264.32s: So to give you some resources so that you're not just trusting some random dude on the
268.64s: internet, I encourage you to go to SSRN.
271.32s: There's a lot of research out here about the variance risk premium, VRP, which is what
276.00s: you're actually trying to capture.
278.12s: And a lot of these studies give you fantastic information about where it is and how it performs
284.72s: the best to give you a cliff notes version of this.
289.00s: When you're trading something like variance risk premiums, you actually want to avoid
293.96s: the extremes.
295.44s: So if I draw, let's say, like a thermometer version, let's say that this is 100% as high
302.00s: as it can go 0%.
303.80s: You actually want to avoid this top level and you want to avoid this very bottom level.
308.52s: You want to be in here.
310.72s: So this is the sweet spot.
313.40s: It's not when vault is super high and it's definitely not when vault is super low.
317.24s: But some of the best possible times to sell is actually when implied volatility is low
323.44s: because very frequently during those durations realize volatility is even lower.
329.92s: That's how you make money selling.
332.12s: It's not by seeing something with a high IVR and just selling something because you think
338.02s: vault is elevated and it should contract.
340.16s: There's a good chance it might not.
342.36s: Okay.
343.36s: Next item on the docket.
346.68s: Selling options is not your edge.
350.56s: This is a really common misconception.
352.80s: Same thing where people say like, oh, theta is an edge.
355.48s: It's not selling options can certainly be an edge.
360.84s: But there's a lot of bad statistics around this.
362.84s: You'll hear people say like 90% of options expire worthless.
366.00s: It's literally completely wrong.
367.64s: You can go to the OCC options clear and corporation.
371.56s: In there, you'll find that the overwhelming majority of options are traded before expiration.
377.40s: And of that small subset that goes to expiration, the remainder of that we have options
385.40s: expire worthless more frequently than options expiring in the money that probably logically
390.92s: flows.
392.20s: So selling options is fine.
395.52s: But it's not this magic thing where if you just do this, you're going to make money.
400.20s: It's not how it works because again, if I just sold options in this timeframe because vault
406.26s: facility was high, I lost.
409.34s: This also goes into a nuanced slash correlated concept of premium chasing.
417.06s: It's when we want to sell and get these really, really high return on our premium, which
421.90s: logically makes sense.
423.38s: But you just have to remember a lot of times it's going to put you into supervoltaile
426.50s: names and going back to what we said before.
429.18s: A lot of times they can move outside your range, which will then cause you to lose.
435.78s: The next thing is using spreads to reduce your risk.
438.66s: There's nothing wrong inherently with using spreads adding tales if you have to.
442.82s: The thing to note though is that if you add tales, you are massively decreasing whatever
447.06s: edge you may have.
449.06s: The other thing to note is that if you're doing this for any sort of income-based activity,
455.30s: you'll find that this itself will unwind a lot of your potential gains when you do lose.
462.66s: Let's take a look at this section here.
464.78s: This sample expectancy, Elzumusin, to make it a little easier to see.
468.50s: There's a lot of noise on here.
469.50s: We'll focus on this.
471.30s: Here I'm showing you this was actually priced on spy.
476.14s: I'll show you the exact trade that I was looking at so that again, you can follow along
480.22s: at home.
481.22s: If I go into spy and I go into the option chain, let's say I go to the 19Ds and let's
488.38s: say go to like this 30Ds of the 665s on the put side.
493.14s: I want to run a vertical.
494.30s: Let's say that I don't have the capital to just run a short put.
497.14s: Run a vertical.
498.18s: This vertical is going to give me about $1.
500.74s: I get that $100.
502.50s: It's $5.5.
504.26s: That means that I have $400 of risk.
506.78s: I collected a dollar.
507.94s: I'm risking the rest of that spread.
510.50s: What's the probability of this thing making money?
513.34s: I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt and I'm saying the probability is 70%.
517.42s: I'm using that 30Ds.
518.42s: It's not quite.
519.74s: The probability of the entire spread falling in is a little different as well.
523.22s: It's slightly lower.
524.46s: I want to focus on the core concepts here, which the core concepts are if you have something
531.74s: with an average one of $100 and you have something with an average loss of your spread
536.38s: being consumed, you're now entirely negatively expecting.
540.62s: It means it net loses money.
542.74s: What means that this by itself doesn't have edge.
545.30s: It means that you have to have something else going in your favor, meaning you're good
548.50s: at picking direction.
549.74s: This can make money.
551.58s: The main thing I want to write, like mention here, is that if you just blindly sell and
557.06s: then you add wings to help yourself, you're setting yourself up in a pretty poor instance.
561.98s: You have to have something else working in your favor.
565.98s: I have an issue that goes over this issue, more in detail, I'll link to that in the
571.98s: notes below.
572.98s: This is why I mentioned this one, it's just because it's in a fairies.
575.34s: A lot of people think that, oh, if I add a spread, I'm reducing my risk.
580.10s: It sounds logical, it does technically reduce your risk on any one individual instance.
585.18s: But in terms of your profitability and long-term profitability, it can be really difficult
588.90s: to be super profitable trading spreads unless you have something else going in your favor.
593.98s: But what that means is, let's say in this scenario that you actually are good at picking
600.30s: direction.
603.02s: Let's say in spy that you find that you're able to get a really, really good win rate,
609.90s: because you have some sort of secret strategy that works well.
613.02s: A lot of those instances, you're going to be better off by not capping your returns.
620.50s: What I mean by this is if we plot on a risk graph, how our short put spread would work,
627.70s: it means that if we're directionally correct, the most we can win is a hundred bucks.
632.34s: If you're good at picking direction, there can be other strategies that might work
636.26s: well.
637.26s: Some of them include buying options instead of just selling.
640.54s: Now, again, this isn't just to say selling is bad.
643.42s: It's not.
644.42s: I saw all the time, a lot of times it's over half of my volume.
647.98s: But the issue is when traders just become entrenched into thinking that like selling is the
652.30s: only thing.
653.62s: Again, for this specific example, this trader could be better off if they're good at
658.66s: picking direction, trading something that doesn't cap their profit potential, because
663.54s: they might be cutting really big winners off that they otherwise would have gotten.
669.22s: Next, rolling doesn't avoid losses.
672.62s: Period, full stop point blank.
674.70s: It doesn't avoid losses.
676.42s: This confuses the crap out of people I have a ton of videos that go through this in detail.
681.30s: The easiest way to think about rolling is that it literally is just multiple trades that
686.46s: the accounting is tied together.
688.18s: I'll give you an example.
690.42s: Let's say that I sell to open something, so sell to open, and let's say I got it for a dollar.
698.06s: And then let's say I buy to close for two dollars.
703.46s: What I just did, this trade for a one-lot took in a hundred dollars.
708.50s: This trade here sent out two hundred dollars.
713.38s: What is the net profit here?
715.90s: The net profit here is negative one hundred dollars.
719.98s: You just realized a loss.
722.98s: This is a realized loss on your books.
726.74s: Now what confuses people is when you do it as a rolling transaction, and this is tied to
732.54s: another trade, let's say that you got it for three dollars.
736.66s: And then you walk out out of this transaction up, right?
741.98s: Because in this case you got a hundred dollars, you lost two, but then you got three.
746.98s: So in this case you walk out up a little bit of money.
751.34s: What's the problem?
752.74s: The problem is that little bit of money is tied to an open position.
760.02s: So if we look at the rest of this example, this trade just gave us plus three hundred dollars.
767.38s: So what's our net?
768.38s: We're plus two hundred dollars.
770.54s: What's the issue?
771.54s: This two hundred dollars is in an open trade.
775.94s: This open trade could also be a loss.
780.90s: The issue with all of this is the accounting side of the equation and how it confuses people.
786.70s: Because you can at the end of a long rolling campaign, walk out net positive.
792.62s: I've done it myself.
794.50s: It's entirely doable.
796.38s: But the issue typically at the end of one of those campaigns is that very frequently,
801.22s: you would have been better off just taking the trade down, putting your money and something
803.66s: else.
804.66s: If you look up what the actual return on that time is, sometimes people get way too wrapped
808.70s: in into just not booking a loss.
811.18s: Whereas the fun fact here is you're booking a loss the entire way just at the end that
815.98s: might net positive.
818.26s: So I have a video that goes through all that way more in detail.
820.98s: Again, this isn't to demonize rolling.
822.38s: I do it literally all the time, but it has to be taken in context and at face value for
827.14s: what it is.
828.14s: It's closing a losing trade.
830.22s: If you're rolling a loser, you can roll winners as well.
833.38s: If you're closing a losing trade and rolling a losing trade, you've realized the loss.
837.26s: You're now opening a new trade that can overwhelm that loss or can become a bigger loss.
843.30s: Just have to go into it.
844.30s: Don't try to get yourself.
846.30s: Last thing here, high win rate does not equal a great strategy and we actually already
853.30s: looked at this example.
854.30s: The main reason why I'm calling this out specifically is because a lot of traders will
857.50s: tout high win rates as if it's some sort of demonstration of skill or something that's
862.82s: good.
864.22s: It's not.
865.22s: It's actually a really easy way to spot an experienced trader.
869.42s: So fun fact, if you see some sort of goveru, a YouTuber or somebody else that's like,
875.26s: hey, I have a 90% win rate.
877.14s: You immediately know something's wrong with that person, meaning they're probably full of
881.66s: shit or they just don't know what they're doing.
884.86s: And it's because of this exact reason back here.
887.82s: I just showed you a strategy that it has a 70% win rate much higher than the loss rate,
893.86s: but it's net loss over time.
896.94s: It loses money over time.
900.26s: So just because something has a high win rate does not mean it's super profitable.
905.46s: This is a concept called expectancy or expected return.
909.46s: I have a video that goes through that as well.
911.50s: The cliff notes version of that is you can have strategies that actually have very low
916.42s: win rates that net positive over time.
919.90s: So let's say instead we have something that has a 35% win rate.
925.54s: Let's do something like 50 trades, but let's say your average winner is 1500 bucks.
931.66s: Notice what happened down here.
933.26s: You're now massively net positive.
935.58s: So you can have something that has a terrible win rate.
939.66s: But if the wins are big enough relative to the losers, you're still massively profitable.
946.10s: Let's jack this up.
947.14s: Say that you lose 600 bucks.
948.66s: What happens?
950.06s: You are still net positive.
953.58s: So do not ever take somebody that says, oh, I have a high win rate.
957.58s: This is a high win rate strategy.
959.34s: That means nothing.
960.34s: It can still lose money.
961.74s: What you care about as positive expected return.
965.66s: This is another massive trap when it comes to selling strategies.
969.46s: Selling strategies generally and ignorantly over emphasize win rate where they shouldn't.
976.66s: We should focus on our expected return.
979.66s: All of this is not to say that selling is bad.
982.34s: It's good if you're interested comment below and I can make a video to talk about how
988.22s: to turn option selling into something productive for your account because it can be done.
993.54s: But again, you have to take all this into account and just apply some basic logic.
998.70s: Be an outlier.
999.70s: See you later.
