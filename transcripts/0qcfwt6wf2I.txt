 I got a DM asking what happened to the volatility in GameStop today. And the goal of this video is to walk you through exactly that. My hope is to try and help share more details on how we can interpret volatility from the options chain and review it for information and potentially some ideas and where the markets might be pricing and things to move. Options markets are very smart. Now another thing is if you haven't seen the video I put out earlier today on how to buy options smarter specifically in something like GameStop, you should check that out. I will throw it in the description below because volatility is such an important part of trading options and a lot of people got burned today because of that. So let's do a quick recap on the 20th of June. Volatility was up to 247%. This is very high. And as we got closer into the expiration, typically you will see volatility can do a bunch of different things. But unless there's a perception of a big move that remains there, typically you'll see the expected move kind of contract volatility kind of contract because as there's less time, there's typically a smaller expected range. The way to think about that is if you were to guess about the total price range of GameStop over the next day or 100 days, which of those do you think would have a bigger price range? 100 days, right? Now what we do with this volatility is we adjust it based on the amount of time that's remaining. So that's why you'll see in this instance, this volatility is 247 with only an expected move of $2.70. But if we go super far out here, this only has a 95% vol but a 40 point expected move. That's why that is. This is adjusted for time. So what ended up happening today? Well this, we fell off a cliff. When I looked at the expiration volatility for today, right before the close, it had contracted massively after the close it dropped off. So I don't have the figure for you in this screenshot at least. But what I do want to look at with you is this actually, which is next week's expiration and there's a couple of things that I want to highlight here specifically. This essentially we've gone from 189 down to 155. Big drop, really big drop. The other thing that I want to highlight that I was talking about yesterday that we've now gone back on again is the rest of the chain has declined precipitously. So if you take a look at the volatility that we saw yesterday, it went 247, 189, 163, 166, 158, 155, 158, so on and so forth. Now if we look over here, it's at 155 for next week, then 139, 139, 139. The fact that these three are the same is actually very informative to me. And it's because this is the first time we've seen the volatility surface here start to flatten out this much. This is essentially 139 to 134 and this takes us all the way out essentially 60 days to expiration to the 16 August something like that. So there's been a huge, huge contraction in volatility. So if we pop open the platform, let's take a look at how to visualize this, what this looks like. You can see the volatility for the next couple of weeks here. I have us out to 28 June 5, July. If I tick off this 28 June and we look at July, so 5 July, 12 July, 19 July, 26 July, look how close all of those are. There's not that much going on here. Now there are some really interesting inversions that I see that are tradable events for our volatility traders out there, but not diving super far down that rabbit hole. Let's take a look over the next two weeks what volatility looks like. And I've already gone over a lot of detail about what you're looking at here, the volatility smile. And I want to focus your eyes on the 28th of June 1st next week's expiration. The very first thing that I notice, we talk about these out of the money options, right? And a lot of you have actually gotten really good at reading this. It's very cool. People are shooting me messages saying, hey, I'm seeing this. What does this mean? And that's honestly awesome. From an options trading perspective, this is a great tool to have. So when I look at next week, one of the very first things I noticed that's again unique is we see the call side actually have more total vol for these super far out of the money options than the put side. And that's represented right above my head. Notice how the call side breaks up above this line, whereas on the put side, I guess I can't show you because my arm gets cut off, but the put side over there that's essentially at the top of the put side. My expectation would be as next week goes, this put side will probably grow unless we start to see some sort of big move that warrants the volatility that we're seeing here, but that's not a given. That's the other thing that I have to highlight for you guys. A lot of people were like, yo, what happened? There was a million of these calls all the way out here at the 125 handle. Let's see if we can find them. 132,000. What happened? Is this big call wall? Here's what's happening here. First thing, this volatility, I mean, you can see at the close, it was 66, 600, 6,600 percent IV. As you get closer to the close, especially on really far out of the money options on something like GameStop, that could for whatever reason go parabolic if roaring kitty puts out something or if Cohen puts out something that gets everybody up and just moving like crazy, this poses an insane risk for whoever's making the market in this product to get ran over into a close on expiration. That's why for something like this, you will see the volatility jacked up so freaking high because I call it a puncture's chance. If you kind of like martial arts, I'm a martial artist myself. There's always a puncture's chance. You can be against somebody that's grossly underscaled compared to you. But if they have enough power, one shot literally can knock you out. It could be the luckiest shot on earth and it can knock you out. It's devastating. You lose the fight. You could win the entire fight and lose it right at the very end. Kind of the opposite of actually what happened with Holloway and Gachy where Holloway won the entire fight and then at the end called him out for a slug fest, which was awesome, by the way. Back to this. This is a puncture's chance. The reason why these are priced so expensively is because in the crazy off chance that there was a massive parabolic up move, a market maker could get ran over by that order flow. So that's why they jack up the implied volatility on these things so much. And if we look on the put side, it's even higher. The put side is 11,900%. Absolutely chaos here. If we take a look at Apple again, I use this as a comparison just to give you some ideas. The put side here is 15,206%. So this is not novel to just GameStop. This on this side is 1,756%. What you'll notice though is that the relative volatility between the call and the put side is very different between these two products. You can very clearly tell an apple there's definitely more fear for a perspective move to the downside because this is at 15,000 compared to 1700. Whereas if we go to GameStop on the put side, it's 12,000 ish. And then on the call side, it's essentially half of that, right? Very different than what I just showed you in Apple. But that's what that is. They're pricing in a puncture's chance. So this doesn't mean that anybody really thinks that this is going to go to the moon. Now for all of these buyers, it's the same puncture's chance. They're taking a puncture's chance. These are insanely cheap options that are going to decay away essentially to nothing as they did. Far more often than not. This is a lottery and then some. This is playing the lottery with the expectation of also getting struck by lightning in the same day. That's the kind of probability that's being baked into this move. But for some people, it is just so cheap to put these on for a penny or two pennies that they don't care because you could put on thousands of those. And if you get one that hits all of those thousands can be paid for, not a great investment approach in general in my opinion. This isn't the way that I personally trade. It's a great way to throw money away. Again, check out that video I talked about earlier. It talks about this exact thing and trying to structure these options trades a little bit more smart so that we're not just bleeding money. Last thing, let's take a look at it next week. And there's not a lot going on in these options, chance objectively. This is interesting to me. This is probably the most interesting thing I see in here where the 30s have 17,500 OI with 14,600 transacted today. I do want to see if these continue to build out. But this is still all just a just small, small, small spec of what we've been seeing. The other thing I want to show you is take a look at kind of the right out of the money call, OI as compared to the put side. And this at down here probably is another great view for that. We grab the OI and we look at it the out of the monies. You can see if we go over here to like 24 in here where the centralization is, let me grab next expiration cycle only. And we're trading right about 24 so like right around in here. And again, you'll notice that most of the depth is definitely out here in the put side in terms of like average size. But take a look at this on the call side. There are some crazy bastards out there at the 120 something. Actually, let's see what those are. We have to add more strikes here. And again, this goes back to what I was just explaining to you guys the punchers chance. These are really cheap options all the way up here in nosebleeds. These look like what the 128s. There's 32,000 of them all the way up there. And it's because there's seven pennies. The people that are buying these are paying through their freaking nose in terms of implied volatility, how expensive these are for what they are. They're going to decay away exceedingly fast. Again, as a percentage of the premium look at this right now, they're bid off or seven and a half wide, something like that or seven and a half total, the mid. And if you take a look at the faded decay, it's four cents after a couple days past, these are zero. They're worth nothing. So again, it's that puncher's chance. It's a tough way to make money in here. So as always, if there's any questions, let me know. I'm going to keep following this as I see anything interesting going on right now. This looks like it's dying out to me. That's what I'm seeing. But if we get a pop and fall or something that draws my eye, I'm back in here with you guys. But otherwise, if there's any questions, always let me know. Be an outlier. See you guys later.
