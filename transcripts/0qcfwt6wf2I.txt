0.00s: I got a DM asking what happened to the volatility in GameStop today.
7.16s: And the goal of this video is to walk you through exactly that.
9.40s: My hope is to try and help share more details on how we can interpret volatility from the
15.08s: options chain and review it for information and potentially some ideas and where the
20.64s: markets might be pricing and things to move.
23.68s: Options markets are very smart.
25.88s: Now another thing is if you haven't seen the video I put out earlier today on how to
30.88s: buy options smarter specifically in something like GameStop, you should check that out.
35.80s: I will throw it in the description below because volatility is such an important part of
41.22s: trading options and a lot of people got burned today because of that.
47.12s: So let's do a quick recap on the 20th of June.
50.36s: Volatility was up to 247%.
51.80s: This is very high.
54.24s: And as we got closer into the expiration, typically you will see volatility can do a bunch of
59.72s: different things.
60.72s: But unless there's a perception of a big move that remains there, typically you'll see
67.12s: the expected move kind of contract volatility kind of contract because as there's less
71.96s: time, there's typically a smaller expected range.
75.92s: The way to think about that is if you were to guess about the total price range of GameStop
81.84s: over the next day or 100 days, which of those do you think would have a bigger price
87.56s: range?
88.56s: 100 days, right?
89.72s: Now what we do with this volatility is we adjust it based on the amount of time that's
94.40s: remaining.
95.64s: So that's why you'll see in this instance, this volatility is 247 with only an expected
101.04s: move of $2.70.
102.64s: But if we go super far out here, this only has a 95% vol but a 40 point expected move.
109.84s: That's why that is.
110.84s: This is adjusted for time.
112.68s: So what ended up happening today?
114.88s: Well this, we fell off a cliff.
118.36s: When I looked at the expiration volatility for today, right before the close, it had contracted
124.36s: massively after the close it dropped off.
127.24s: So I don't have the figure for you in this screenshot at least.
130.80s: But what I do want to look at with you is this actually, which is next week's expiration
139.72s: and there's a couple of things that I want to highlight here specifically.
143.68s: This essentially we've gone from 189 down to 155.
148.68s: Big drop, really big drop.
150.64s: The other thing that I want to highlight that I was talking about yesterday that we've
153.76s: now gone back on again is the rest of the chain has declined precipitously.
161.28s: So if you take a look at the volatility that we saw yesterday, it went 247, 189, 163,
168.40s: 166, 158, 155, 158, so on and so forth.
173.24s: Now if we look over here, it's at 155 for next week, then 139, 139, 139.
181.30s: The fact that these three are the same is actually very informative to me.
187.68s: And it's because this is the first time we've seen the volatility surface here start to flatten
192.44s: out this much.
194.48s: This is essentially 139 to 134 and this takes us all the way out essentially 60 days to
201.88s: expiration to the 16 August something like that.
205.24s: So there's been a huge, huge contraction in volatility.
210.00s: So if we pop open the platform, let's take a look at how to visualize this, what this
213.92s: looks like.
214.84s: You can see the volatility for the next couple of weeks here.
218.60s: I have us out to 28 June 5, July.
221.76s: If I tick off this 28 June and we look at July, so 5 July, 12 July, 19 July, 26 July,
230.04s: look how close all of those are.
232.52s: There's not that much going on here.
235.08s: Now there are some really interesting inversions that I see that are tradable events for our
241.74s: volatility traders out there, but not diving super far down that rabbit hole.
246.52s: Let's take a look over the next two weeks what volatility looks like.
250.24s: And I've already gone over a lot of detail about what you're looking at here, the volatility
254.92s: smile.
256.68s: And I want to focus your eyes on the 28th of June 1st next week's expiration.
262.30s: The very first thing that I notice, we talk about these out of the money options, right?
267.10s: And a lot of you have actually gotten really good at reading this.
269.84s: It's very cool.
270.84s: People are shooting me messages saying, hey, I'm seeing this.
273.32s: What does this mean?
274.32s: And that's honestly awesome.
275.64s: From an options trading perspective, this is a great tool to have.
278.80s: So when I look at next week, one of the very first things I noticed that's again unique
284.04s: is we see the call side actually have more total vol for these super far out of the money
290.40s: options than the put side.
292.14s: And that's represented right above my head.
293.80s: Notice how the call side breaks up above this line, whereas on the put side, I guess I
298.48s: can't show you because my arm gets cut off, but the put side over there that's essentially
301.96s: at the top of the put side.
303.68s: My expectation would be as next week goes, this put side will probably grow unless we
310.00s: start to see some sort of big move that warrants the volatility that we're seeing here,
314.08s: but that's not a given.
315.92s: That's the other thing that I have to highlight for you guys.
319.52s: A lot of people were like, yo, what happened?
323.84s: There was a million of these calls all the way out here at the 125 handle.
328.48s: Let's see if we can find them.
330.12s: 132,000.
331.60s: What happened?
332.60s: Is this big call wall?
334.44s: Here's what's happening here.
336.20s: First thing, this volatility, I mean, you can see at the close, it was 66, 600, 6,600
344.24s: percent IV.
345.96s: As you get closer to the close, especially on really far out of the money options on something
350.56s: like GameStop, that could for whatever reason go parabolic if roaring kitty puts out something
356.84s: or if Cohen puts out something that gets everybody up and just moving like crazy, this poses
365.32s: an insane risk for whoever's making the market in this product to get ran over into a close
371.64s: on expiration.
372.84s: That's why for something like this, you will see the volatility jacked up so freaking high
379.48s: because I call it a puncture's chance.
381.84s: If you kind of like martial arts, I'm a martial artist myself.
385.40s: There's always a puncture's chance.
386.84s: You can be against somebody that's grossly underscaled compared to you.
391.24s: But if they have enough power, one shot literally can knock you out.
396.60s: It could be the luckiest shot on earth and it can knock you out.
399.36s: It's devastating.
400.36s: You lose the fight.
401.36s: You could win the entire fight and lose it right at the very end.
403.48s: Kind of the opposite of actually what happened with Holloway and Gachy where Holloway won
408.76s: the entire fight and then at the end called him out for a slug fest, which was awesome,
412.64s: by the way.
413.96s: Back to this.
415.24s: This is a puncture's chance.
416.72s: The reason why these are priced so expensively is because in the crazy off chance that there
421.72s: was a massive parabolic up move, a market maker could get ran over by that order flow.
427.92s: So that's why they jack up the implied volatility on these things so much.
433.00s: And if we look on the put side, it's even higher.
436.08s: The put side is 11,900%.
440.32s: Absolutely chaos here.
443.24s: If we take a look at Apple again, I use this as a comparison just to give you some ideas.
447.00s: The put side here is 15,206%.
452.12s: So this is not novel to just GameStop.
456.68s: This on this side is 1,756%.
460.96s: What you'll notice though is that the relative volatility between the call and the put side
465.96s: is very different between these two products.
467.76s: You can very clearly tell an apple there's definitely more fear for a perspective move
472.40s: to the downside because this is at 15,000 compared to 1700.
476.64s: Whereas if we go to GameStop on the put side, it's 12,000 ish.
483.64s: And then on the call side, it's essentially half of that, right?
488.04s: Very different than what I just showed you in Apple.
490.12s: But that's what that is.
491.52s: They're pricing in a puncture's chance.
493.44s: So this doesn't mean that anybody really thinks that this is going to go to the moon.
497.64s: Now for all of these buyers, it's the same puncture's chance.
501.24s: They're taking a puncture's chance.
503.16s: These are insanely cheap options that are going to decay away essentially to nothing as
507.44s: they did.
508.76s: Far more often than not.
510.20s: This is a lottery and then some.
512.56s: This is playing the lottery with the expectation of also getting struck by lightning in the
516.68s: same day.
517.84s: That's the kind of probability that's being baked into this move.
520.16s: But for some people, it is just so cheap to put these on for a penny or two pennies
524.52s: that they don't care because you could put on thousands of those.
528.12s: And if you get one that hits all of those thousands can be paid for, not a great investment
534.00s: approach in general in my opinion.
535.56s: This isn't the way that I personally trade.
537.52s: It's a great way to throw money away.
538.76s: Again, check out that video I talked about earlier.
540.72s: It talks about this exact thing and trying to structure these options trades a little
545.04s: bit more smart so that we're not just bleeding money.
548.08s: Last thing, let's take a look at it next week.
550.80s: And there's not a lot going on in these options, chance objectively.
554.36s: This is interesting to me.
555.64s: This is probably the most interesting thing I see in here where the 30s have 17,500
561.14s: OI with 14,600 transacted today.
563.80s: I do want to see if these continue to build out.
567.04s: But this is still all just a just small, small, small spec of what we've been seeing.
573.64s: The other thing I want to show you is take a look at kind of the right out of the money
577.44s: call, OI as compared to the put side.
580.60s: And this at down here probably is another great view for that.
584.20s: We grab the OI and we look at it the out of the monies.
587.68s: You can see if we go over here to like 24 in here where the centralization is, let me
593.80s: grab next expiration cycle only.
597.96s: And we're trading right about 24 so like right around in here.
601.84s: And again, you'll notice that most of the depth is definitely out here in the put side
607.72s: in terms of like average size.
609.24s: But take a look at this on the call side.
611.56s: There are some crazy bastards out there at the 120 something.
617.28s: Actually, let's see what those are.
619.40s: We have to add more strikes here.
620.80s: And again, this goes back to what I was just explaining to you guys the punchers chance.
625.16s: These are really cheap options all the way up here in nosebleeds.
628.44s: These look like what the 128s.
629.72s: There's 32,000 of them all the way up there.
632.28s: And it's because there's seven pennies.
634.64s: The people that are buying these are paying through their freaking nose in terms of implied
639.48s: volatility, how expensive these are for what they are.
642.48s: They're going to decay away exceedingly fast.
645.20s: Again, as a percentage of the premium look at this right now, they're bid off or seven
649.68s: and a half wide, something like that or seven and a half total, the mid.
653.44s: And if you take a look at the faded decay, it's four cents after a couple days past, these
659.36s: are zero.
660.36s: They're worth nothing.
661.36s: So again, it's that puncher's chance.
663.52s: It's a tough way to make money in here.
665.24s: So as always, if there's any questions, let me know.
667.12s: I'm going to keep following this as I see anything interesting going on right now.
670.92s: This looks like it's dying out to me.
672.32s: That's what I'm seeing.
673.32s: But if we get a pop and fall or something that draws my eye, I'm back in here with you
676.44s: guys.
677.44s: But otherwise, if there's any questions, always let me know.
679.48s: Be an outlier.
680.48s: See you guys later.
