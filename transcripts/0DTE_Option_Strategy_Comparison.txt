0.16s: boom we're back at it today I want to
2.36s: talk to you about zero DTE option
4.92s: structures and which one is the best
7.68s: there are a lot of different ways you
8.96s: can trade these things and you might not
11.40s: even know why we trade these things so
13.84s: the goal of the video is to briefly
15.80s: overview why we trade them and then I'm
18.28s: going to walk you through 5 years of
20.68s: back tested results of trading different
23.52s: zero DTE structures with different rules
25.84s: applied to them so that you can start to
28.12s: understand what performs best and what
29.96s: market conditions and then going forward
32.44s: if you guys are interested I can make a
34.56s: couple follow on videos that dive really
37.24s: deep into detail on the top performers
40.32s: so if you watch to the end and drop in
42.56s: the comments what your preferred
44.92s: strategy is for me to take a look at
46.84s: might be able to throw it in the next
47.96s: video for you so what's up everybody
49.96s: Eric here welcome back to all the
51.12s: outliers and a shout out to the patreon
52.64s: family you guys make content like this
54.40s: possible and pay my editor so he thanks
56.88s: you as well thank you let's get into
60.36s: details so what's the premise of these
62.32s: zero DTE strategies now for most people
64.88s: it's probably because they think they're
66.20s: going to get rich quick which is
67.48s: arguably probably the worst possible
69.44s: reason to start trading these for a lot
71.64s: of different reasons if you haven't seen
74.24s: this previous video that I did called
76.32s: Master zero DTE options which you should
78.96s: it dives into these really far into
81.32s: detail and this is the punchline most
83.60s: people lose money doing these like
85.40s: that's what it comes down to so a lot of
87.16s: people start trading these with the
88.44s: wrong idea in mind is that it's fast
90.96s: easy money and it's genuinely not that
93.56s: like at all so let's take a look at why
96.72s: we do this it's really to capture
98.44s: variance risk premiums if you're
100.04s: unfamiliar with what that concept is
101.88s: I'll throw a video in the notes below
103.72s: for you so that you can take a look but
106.04s: in short it's the propensity for implied
108.64s: volatility to be overstated compared to
111.16s: Historic volatility that's it so with
113.52s: that knowing that we want to capture it
115.40s: and we think that there's an opportunity
117.00s: to do that on zero DT expirations
119.28s: because there is let's take a look at
120.80s: what structures we're going to analyze
123.04s: we're going to look at the short
123.92s: straddle the short strangle the short
125.88s: iron Condor and then the short iron fly
128.12s: notice how these are all short the
129.64s: reason why this is short is because to
132.20s: capture this effect these are the
135.80s: specific strategies that lend the best
138.88s: you could consider half of the iron
141.20s: Condor being short call or put vertical
143.84s: spread something like that if you were
145.16s: so inclined or even butterflies could
147.52s: absolutely have an honorable mention on
149.32s: this video but I want to focus on these
151.60s: for a few reasons and you'll see why in
153.68s: a couple moments so now let's take a
155.96s: look real quick at the structures for
157.92s: each of these so that you are on the
159.92s: same page as me so the short straddle is
161.76s: going to be short a call short a put at
163.44s: the same strike this is the p&l graph
165.48s: notice how there's kind of this really
167.04s: sharp Point here that is whatever that
169.52s: same strike is and then it has unlimited
172.56s: loss potential both to the upside and
174.56s: downside then we have the strangle which
176.24s: is very similar short of call short of
177.96s: put but these are typically at the same
179.80s: Delta they can be skewed but a lot of
181.88s: times you'll see something like short a
183.72s: 30 Delta call short a 30 Delta put and
186.40s: then it gives you this kind of picture
189.08s: for the p&l graph and this just gives
191.56s: you a wider range what's the difference
193.56s: between these well these typically will
195.84s: have a lower win rate but a higher
199.36s: average win that may or may not be your
201.64s: style and it's kind of the inverse for
203.36s: these now another note is that when we
205.84s: look at something like a short straddle
207.60s: this is typically considered to be much
209.44s: more more of a pure volatility risk
212.12s: premium play and there's a bunch of
214.08s: reasons for that that I'm not going to
215.24s: go into detail on this video you can
216.56s: check out those other videos for that
218.32s: however sometimes the Delta offset
221.92s: provided by strangles and being further
223.96s: out of the money can still help you more
226.68s: than this so there's kind of a debate on
229.28s: whether it's best or not to trade the
231.88s: most pure expression of this as possible
234.20s: and what I try to remind people is the
236.72s: goal at least for me is to make money so
239.24s: I will flow between things as I need to
241.88s: make the most money that's really what
243.20s: it boils down to then we have the short
244.92s: iron Condor which in this case it's
247.00s: essentially a short strangle but you're
248.52s: buying further out of the money Wings
250.52s: both on the call and the put side and
252.48s: that gives you defined loss as compared
255.48s: to the undefined loss here and then we
257.36s: have the short iron fly which is kind of
259.04s: doing the same thing for the short
260.56s: straddle so now we have defined losses
263.24s: both of these will have lower average
265.80s: profitability and again that's the
267.60s: trade-off you make for something like
269.16s: this so so these are the structures the
271.20s: specific legs that I want to cover now
274.28s: let's get into the meat and potatoes
275.92s: which are the results this first looks
279.08s: at 2018 to 2023 and we're looking at
282.12s: zero DTE positions that we enter at
284.76s: 10:00 a.m. and we are not applying any
287.76s: profit management or Loss Management
290.00s: this means that we're just taking it
291.32s: into expiration this is all in SPX so
295.04s: these are cash settled European style
298.08s: options and we look at a few things
299.60s: things so here we have a 15 Delta
302.60s: strangle 20 Delta 30 Delta 40 Delta
305.84s: strangles then the 50 Delta which would
308.56s: be a straddle notice a bunch of
310.44s: different of the metrics here I have
312.36s: them colorcoded because I am a simple
314.52s: man and I like colors that's great but
317.72s: we does have to do anything but it kind
319.32s: of highlights some of the easier things
320.76s: for you to see the very first one is
323.08s: interestingly the further out of the
325.60s: money series actually performed the best
329.24s: when you compare it to things that are
330.80s: closer to the money like 30 or 40 Delta
332.92s: now the 15 and 20 Delta are very similar
335.92s: it's essentially the 20 delta made
337.56s: $1,000 more if you take a look at the
339.48s: max loss the 15 Delta had a much better
342.40s: Max loss compared to everything else so
344.60s: what's going on here well interestingly
346.72s: because the market has experienced a
348.56s: pretty significant uptick in volatility
350.96s: and what I mean by that is typically
352.84s: people will say oh if volatility is high
355.00s: you should sell right because you make
356.84s: more money well sort of the way you make
359.20s: more more money is if implied volatility
361.44s: is tracking over historic volatility and
364.12s: look at this handy dandy IV HV graph
367.24s: that I have here and you'll notice quite
369.36s: a few periods where historic is actually
372.08s: much higher than implied this happens in
374.68s: higher volatility regimes so this whole
377.48s: idea of when things are high you just
379.80s: default to selling may not work out the
382.04s: best in every single strategy because
383.84s: what I want you to look at is the size
385.44s: of the candles this is preco this is
388.40s: 2019
390.12s: early of 2020 notice the size of these
392.64s: candles if you look at the average and
394.80s: this is for a whole week if you look at
396.36s: the average weekly move here compared to
398.76s: pretty much everything postco notice how
401.40s: massive these moves are and you can see
403.60s: that again represented in the sizes of
405.44s: the candles the reason why that matters
407.92s: is that in a higher inv volatility
411.20s: environment these perform very
413.48s: differently than you might expect
415.12s: because in a lower volatility
416.68s: environment typically the short straddle
419.60s: would actually perform better so now
421.56s: let's take a look at some of those other
423.44s: structures that we talked about if
425.08s: you'll notice here we're now adding the
427.44s: long leg of the option to all of these
430.64s: so instead of just being the 15 Delta
433.68s: short options we're now adding a five
435.84s: delta wing and then a 10 delta wing so
438.16s: that we can compare the width of these
440.64s: different wings and the overall
442.16s: profitability and then what we also have
445.28s: is the same style movement for the iron
447.80s: fly except for I did a bunch for the
451.48s: iron fly where we had the same 50 Delta
454.36s: colum put but then we went everything
456.40s: from a 10 to a 45 Delta so what do we
459.04s: learn here well first there are a couple
461.96s: big highlights the 20 Delta short
465.36s: strangle worked the best With No Wings
468.76s: then when we're looking at what worked
470.52s: the best with wings you have two choices
473.36s: you have a really narrow fiveo wide
476.20s: spread at Short 15 Deltas long 10 Delta
479.28s: delas which gave you
480.64s: $36,000 or you could do the 20 Deltas 10
483.68s: Deltas which got you to
485.52s: $37,000 but notice the difference in the
487.60s: max losses here a 11,000 versus 9400 and
493.16s: then the average loss here is 2200
495.84s: compared to 2700 so you have to figure
498.16s: out which of those might be right for
499.60s: you and let me take a quick pause here
501.64s: because if you look at this data and all
503.36s: of a sudden you just start trading one
505.04s: of these blindly going forward you're
507.12s: doing what's called overfitting and it's
509.28s: important to be cognizant of this and
511.00s: that's essentially when you're
511.96s: cherry-picking the best combinations of
514.36s: things and then expecting that to hold
516.20s: going forward so that's actually why
518.12s: maintaining a live data set is so
520.16s: important it's one of the things I did
521.68s: this year I have another video in the
523.28s: description for you to check out on a
524.92s: pivot that I made because in the
526.48s: beginning of the year I was telling you
528.12s: guys and in the beginning of this video
529.48s: I was telling you how the 50 Delta
531.24s: straddles outperform in lower volatility
534.20s: environments but it necessitated a move
536.84s: and it's because we're in a different
538.04s: environment so if I had just
539.88s: cherry-picked using the 50 Delta
542.24s: straddle and ignored all other data
544.56s: going forward expecting that to continue
546.28s: to be the case I would have been in a
548.40s: bad position so you have to be careful
550.40s: when you look at back tests for
551.76s: overfitting which is when you just
553.12s: cherry-pick the best possible things and
554.96s: then that is the expected outcome going
556.56s: forward you have to stay very sensitive
558.20s: to new information and then down to the
561.04s: iron flies the best choice here the only
563.88s: profitable Choice here was actually
565.96s: fivepoint wide iron fly what does this
568.20s: tell you well it means in this case that
571.00s: implied volatility was still tracking
573.80s: below historic volatility too frequently
576.28s: and the only reason why this did okay is
578.28s: because it reduced so much of the
580.84s: outsized moves so it took our average
583.36s: loss in pretty meaningfully so this is
586.52s: the first step for us to analyze these
590.08s: different structures so in the comments
592.08s: below let me know what structure you
594.72s: think is the best and then based on
597.16s: those I'm going to make a follow-up
598.80s: video so that we can actually dive into
601.28s: even more detail on some of the
603.60s: specifics here so that we can see not
606.08s: just in an aggregate 5-year period but
608.64s: year over-year how the best performers
611.20s: behaved then I want us to look at the
613.48s: optimal entry time what time of day
615.72s: works the best then I really want to get
618.48s: us to this where we test slightly
621.92s: different time frames this will be a
625.44s: really important test because there are
627.72s: some much better configurations than
631.52s: zero DTE in terms of overall
633.20s: profitability I still trade most of them
635.28s: in a lot of different permutations but
637.32s: this I think will be very interesting to
639.12s: us however we need to figure out what
640.96s: we're going to use for this and that's
642.40s: going to be based on what you guys throw
643.76s: in the comments below so let me know and
645.52s: we'll take a look like subscribe share
647.44s: be an outlier see you guys later
