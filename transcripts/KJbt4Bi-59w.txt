0.00s: What's up, outliers? Happy Monday, quick market update. I got three things on the agenda
5.68s: for today. I want to talk a little bit about Oracle earnings because as you can tell,
11.56s: it looks really, really good. They close today at $139.89 and they're trading at $152. And
18.04s: we'll talk about why that's important. The next thing I want to talk about after that
21.24s: is the iPhone and Apple because, well, you know, it's always nice to see us get pitched
27.72s: the same thing over and over again, you're over here and then go buy it for sure. So I
33.48s: want to take a look at that. And then I want to take a look at GameStop because it has
37.24s: earnings coming up tomorrow. So I want to see how we're positioning leading into earnings.
42.84s: So what's going on with Oracle and why does this matter? Well, to me, I think this is
47.64s: really, really important because we can see that it's reporting really, really well. We'll
53.88s: go through some of those metrics in just a minute, but essentially for expectations,
58.44s: this is the funny part about markets. It was expected at $1.00 and a nickel and it came
64.60s: in at $1.39. So that's a really big EPS beat as we've seen with a lot of other tech companies,
71.64s: but the market is rewarding them. And a lot of what they're rewarding them for again,
77.48s: as per usual, are actually the way that we're forecasting out into the future. And the
83.56s: potential growth opportunities for Oracle, which look really, really robust. So I absolutely
91.32s: recommend taking a look. We can take a look through the earning release a little bit later during
95.96s: the YouTube live session if we want. But I took a cursory overview and I mean, they're overall
101.56s: performing really, really strong. So they are opening this here that I think is really interesting
108.44s: that there's going to be a new partnership that they're launching with Google.
113.56s: They really are seemingly being well received here. So what this all means in my opinion is,
121.24s: it's kind of a breath of fresh air, especially after the last week that we had in the markets.
126.84s: We saw tech get a little bit of a bump today, but not much. We saw the S&P make a little bit better
132.36s: of a rally, but still not much. And same thing with small caps hanging near the lows here.
137.64s: All up on the day, but not massively, VIX came down closing at 1945. So the market is still
144.76s: in my opinion at a very tenuous phase. We can see this standard deviation channel as days drop off
152.20s: the back here and new days are added. You can see that the slope of this is actually gone from this
159.40s: about flat almost on a three month. So what that tells us is that the near term price action
163.96s: has been not great. So if we don't start seeing spy rotating up and out from here,
170.60s: it starts to look more and more like consolidation sideways action until there's some sort of big
174.68s: catalyst. And tech just looks down from here, even on this little tiny update, it was really
181.00s: well bought. There was really strong by volume, but it's just not that significant just yet.
188.76s: So I feel like the market is at kind of an important inflection point, but seeing this come
194.36s: through from Oracle, I think is kind of a good sign because we're seeing a company that reported
199.08s: really well for earnings. And so far, the market likes it, which is solid. Next thing we have is Apple.
207.56s: So if we take a look, it looks kind of the same. How cool. Look at that. Got three little cameras.
217.00s: How many of those mine have I think I have the 15. Yeah, looks about the same. It does have a
221.40s: really cool function button apparently that's supposed to be a big deal. I'm not going to pretend
225.96s: to be some sort of expert on all the nuance differences between these. I really spend very little
232.04s: time. I actually have a buddy that's really interested in them. So this is not like a tech
236.20s: gadget review going through the differences and stuff. But yeah, here's some of the differences
241.72s: for you. The reason I bring that up is just because Apple is always at part of the conversation.
249.48s: And we can see that it didn't move a lot. And again, this isn't necessarily a big shock to me.
256.44s: Feels like the market is kind of used to this annual renewal of things. And unless it's a really,
261.80s: really big upgrade, it doesn't always lead to this big giant movement. That's kind of what I see
267.64s: here. Now let's run over to GameStop. And GameStop is starting to catch a bid here. So we can see that
278.20s: it hit this kind of term low. The low of this day was 1988 in here. Actually, I guess I can
285.96s: delete this old one. That's a little, a little aged as it were. We can update it. And it's been
292.84s: rowing up up since. And right now it's at 2425, which again, for GameStop, that move might not
298.20s: seem huge. But if you think about it, that's essentially like a five point move for a little less
304.04s: four point move. It's that's not insignificant for a product that's priced as GameStop is. So
310.04s: for the people that are out there trading movement, there's some movement here. It's just not what
314.04s: we're kind of hoping to see, which is obviously to the moon. Now, it does have earnings coming up,
320.52s: which I feel is important to talk about. So if we take a look at what we saw today in total net
327.24s: premium, it was 1.3 million. So what that tells me is obviously we have people that are coming into
335.72s: buy. Obviously. And if you look at the put volume call volume, it's kind of light. Right? So put
342.28s: volume was 52. Call volume was 168. There's not a lot in here that necessarily jumped out at me.
350.60s: So if we take a look now inside the trade tab, we can see
357.16s: current open interest. We have to update this. So you can see current open interest is 596K versus
363.24s: 279. Little bit light. And if we take a look at open interest specifically for this series,
368.92s: it's also very light. It does have calls you heavy. So I'm seeing 105,000 calls versus 31,000 puts.
376.04s: That's a big ratio between those. And normally when you're going into earnings, a lot of people
381.00s: are actually hedging the downside because you're kind of holding the stock fearful of a gap down.
387.80s: So you buy some puts. That's super normal. And I just I don't see a massive concentration in here.
395.16s: Yet. But again, we can see that there were way more calls traded today, except it's a really
400.76s: even split between the bid, the offer, and then between the market, which we can't tell necessarily
407.48s: if those are bought or sold. So looking through here, there's nothing that's, I don't know,
412.76s: like really jumping out at me, the same things you'll always see beginning the day busier than end
417.08s: of day or beginning of the day and end of day busier than middle of the day. Typically, that's kind of
423.08s: common. But let's take a quick look at any large trades that came through. I didn't see a whole lot
430.36s: that stuck out to me. Yeah, it's typically for stuff like this. I have a bunch of scans that I
436.04s: typically run. And there was nothing that popped today like last week. I'll even look between no
441.00s: side, meaning things that are in the mid. So to see if there's any like big, big premium trades
446.52s: that roll through. And I just didn't see a lot of those. So far as I could tell right now,
451.48s: it looks like pretty quiet positioning leading into earnings. We can see some put transactions
457.48s: coming in at the ask. So people are buying some puts, but it's still not much right. 491. It's
463.88s: insignificant at best. So something to keep an eye ball on. I'm excited for earnings. I'm really,
470.12s: really, really curious to see one, if we're going to come across any interesting information that
476.36s: people tell me that is not coming. So I'm not really expecting it. But I am still hopeful that maybe
482.04s: GameStop will release a little bit of a outline or game plan on how we're thinking about the capital
488.28s: that's on hand because obviously I'm very interested in that. And then the other thing I'm interested
494.20s: in is if we pop in here for earnings, we can see that it's had decent earnings. And what I mean by
500.44s: that is just in terms of Q2. If I look back over the past Q2s, it's obviously had some down ticks.
507.48s: But it's nothing like catastrophic and Q2 and 22 actually rallied up. So I don't think Q2 is
514.36s: necessarily like some sort of really bad quarter from what I can see here. But it does look like
521.16s: there's an expansion in volatility leading into this earnings release, which is kind of interesting.
527.16s: We won't really know what this will look like until the market gets closer to the close tomorrow. But
532.60s: it looks like an interesting earnings play. I'm definitely eyeballing it from an
536.12s: option trading perspective to look at it for earnings specifically. Just a little bit harder to
540.76s: structure than I typically like to and something like this, which we can spend some time talking
544.68s: about during the live stream. So exciting to see. As always, if there's any questions, anything you
551.48s: want to take a look at, let me know. The entire live stream schedule is now out. You can see it on
556.36s: the YouTube channel. We got stuff most days at five o'clock. So come hang out, be an outlier. So you
561.72s: guys later.
