0.76s: GameStop is showing some signs of Life
3.44s: get ready for your Tuesday update on the
7.32s: crowd favorite GameStop we're going to
9.12s: just take a look at the stock take a
10.44s: look at the options we'll talk about
11.56s: some position updates and uh to kick us
14.68s: off just like I have been doing on these
16.20s: Tuesday videos I just want to recap what
18.56s: we covered in the GameStop analysis live
22.48s: stream from this last Saturday it's
24.96s: every Saturday at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time
26.60s: and we kind of ran through uh the DD
29.60s: Library again so we looked at a few
31.68s: things we had um there was essentially
35.32s: one or two of them that I would consider
37.20s: to be like true research one of it was
39.96s: likening us to the' 08 crash and
42.48s: obviously that hasn't really played out
44.32s: cuz the broad idea is that we're due for
46.52s: like another big crash but I like the
48.44s: research specifically related to the' 08
51.56s: crash now the the parallel and the
55.32s: transition from the 08 crash into
57.16s: GameStop I thought was a little bit weak
60.36s: in terms of the you know the actual
62.72s: correlation but I still thought it was
64.76s: interesting nonetheless and then the
67.28s: rest of the stuff we were looking at was
69.68s: a game of funny memes there was somebody
72.00s: that really enjoyed doing Lego memes so
73.84s: they made like a whole book of it which
75.72s: is pretty funny and then there was uh
78.72s: General magazine it was like a National
80.52s: Geographic design almost which was
82.72s: pretty neat so we are still working
85.44s: through the top theories and Analysis
87.84s: this is we wrapped up part 14
91.00s: so this is over 20 hours now just
93.80s: looking at the top theories not
95.56s: including the overall GameStop analysis
97.60s: that's been on stream for now 32
99.44s: episodes which is pretty fun cool so
102.00s: that stuff aside let's take a look at
104.56s: the stock itself because it's in a very
107.96s: interesting spot here so as everybody
110.52s: knows GameStop absolutely had been
113.28s: contracting for quite some time now a
115.28s: lot of it actually looked to be in my
117.72s: opinion some type of institutional
120.72s: selling and again I don't go into the
124.00s: world of whether that's institutional
125.60s: selling to suppress the price or
127.16s: anything like that I'm just talking from
128.60s: a standard Market Behavior perspective
131.12s: this that's what it looked like because
132.48s: it wasn't tied to any specific news
134.96s: there was a slight uptick in overall
137.48s: average volume and that to me looks like
141.28s: some sort of entity that's looking to
143.60s: unwind a long position that they might
145.96s: have in it now that's complete
147.24s: conjecture I don't know that's just
150.28s: fairly common based on this kind of
152.60s: pattern configuration so then that move
155.32s: digested out we came into a couple
157.80s: really important levels the first one
160.24s: was the 26 and 1/2 level which we fell
163.04s: right down through that and then we were
165.00s: hovering at 25 and 1/2 and I was
168.16s: actually pretty nervous if we were to
170.20s: fall below 25 1/2 and we did now the
175.84s: cool part about this is on the fall
178.64s: through 25 have you can actually see
181.76s: that there's really nothing in here as
183.64s: far as a volume profile there's just not
185.60s: a lot of transactions now the reason why
188.24s: that's so important is because that
191.08s: means there is there's not a lot of
193.48s: Legacy buying at that level it's kind of
196.20s: No Man's Land and if we Zoom this into a
198.16s: 3-month daily you can see the same thing
200.64s: here there's just not a lot of volume
202.88s: being transacted at however it did come
206.04s: to find some pretty Firm support on the
208.60s: 200 day moving average and then it had a
211.56s: really strong day yesterday on the 10th
214.24s: you can see that it rallied pretty hard
217.36s: through this overall descending Channel
220.72s: which is good now I don't think we're
222.44s: out of the woods yet because if you take
224.76s: a look again just from a standard
226.64s: technical analysis uh perspective let me
229.12s: get rid of that one and grab the line
230.88s: for you guys like the trend line so I
232.32s: can show you what I'm seeing which is
234.80s: from
235.76s: here down to here it's still very much
240.04s: in a pretty confirmed downtrend it's
242.76s: just starting to lighten up in terms of
245.84s: the slope at least in the near-term time
247.76s: frame in a long-term time frame it's
249.08s: still unequivocally upward sloping you
251.64s: know um appreciating so this was really
255.48s: well received and essentially it gapped
258.12s: up to 25 A2 and then it rallied all the
261.00s: way up to 27 so that was a really really
264.08s: big day again on relatively light news
267.36s: but this is again it looks to be
270.52s: institutional sponsorship of some sort
272.68s: that looks that is exactly what that
274.72s: looks like to me now this is the broader
277.96s: value area as far as I see it and now
282.40s: this becomes near-term support on the
285.48s: downside and it still looks like it's
287.64s: generally descending so it's a game of
290.60s: wait and see we have to see from a price
292.28s: action perspective how it behaves but it
295.12s: is good that it found some support on
296.72s: the 200 day ma there's definitely some
298.72s: interest there now to the upside there
302.84s: is a really significant volume node in
305.96s: here which I'll highlight it for you so
307.92s: that you can see so it doesn't surprise
310.32s: me at all to see the price Meander up
313.60s: into that and then get pushed back down
315.40s: the reason being is very frequently when
318.20s: we get into this kind of price area
322.64s: people that were in at these levels
325.36s: after it fell down to
327.16s: 24ish they're happy to get out at a
330.48s: break even so that's for the people that
332.84s: are more actively trading it so this
336.00s: still looks like GameStop is near-term
339.44s: downtrend it looks like it's
341.48s: decelerating the downtrend a little bit
343.40s: which is good these are starting these
345.12s: channels are widening out and now the
348.28s: game is to see if it starts to approach
351.32s: this prior high and then this prior High
354.16s: to get above right now what will
357.08s: essentially be a supply zone for people
359.08s: to to offload now in terms of volatility
362.76s: volatility really hasn't moved that much
364.96s: so you can see implied volatility
366.36s: percentile is still just down at 6%
369.20s: which is very very light for GameStop
373.08s: the implied volatility itself is at 77 a
376.60s: half which again on a gross basis that's
379.52s: still quite High and the reason why
381.52s: that's important is because for people
382.88s: like me and the position I've been
384.80s: showing you trading the coverage
386.68s: strangle in GameStop this volatility
389.88s: even though it's relatively low to
391.84s: GameStop it's still very very high so to
394.84s: give you an example of what I mean by
396.60s: that let's say if you wanted to sell a
398.56s: put and let me grab a worksheet here so
402.00s: that we can just kind of look at it
403.52s: together so if I wanted to sell a put
406.16s: here and
408.20s: it's the 24 strike so the 24 strike and
414.20s: we're looking at a 0.27 Delta
418.24s: 0.27 and then and if we take a look at
420.44s: the premium we get it's kind of really
424.12s: wide but let's call it like
427.60s: 908 cents something like that 0.98
431.96s: that's the premium you get so a very
434.40s: standard calculation here is essentially
437.12s: to take the premium receive divided by
438.80s: the strike and then to turn this into a
440.92s: percent so this means that if you sell a
443.24s: if you sell a cash secured put you're
444.68s: going to put up 2400 bucks you're going
446.12s: to get 98 bucks and it's essentially a
448.60s: 4.1% % return on your money and if you
451.44s: have no context on if that's good bad or
454.20s: indifferent this will won't mean that
456.12s: much to you so that's actually why I
458.64s: want to help give you some context so
460.52s: let's take a look at an equivalent I'm
463.48s: now going to Pivot over to spy we're
465.56s: going to stay in the same expiration
466.92s: that 38 days to expiration I'm going to
469.80s: find the same Delta so that we can look
472.40s: at uh the commenor it so this one's
474.32s: GameStop this one will be uh not spt in
478.24s: fact this one will be spy so let's take
482.32s: a look now at spy so the strike for a 27
487.80s: Delta here is like the 590 so 59027
491.96s: which is great that it lines up
493.28s: perfectly and at that 27 you're going to
496.44s: get $4.99
498.60s: 4.99 so then if we take a look at this
500.80s: as a percentage to compare take a look
504.32s: at the
505.12s: difference so because GameStop is so so
510.80s: volatile in general even though right
513.84s: now it's relatively not compared to
516.80s: itself you're getting
519.88s: 3.24% more money on a relative basis so
524.44s: that's why right now trading something
526.24s: like GameStop is so attractive even
528.88s: though the volatility is low and this
530.32s: leads to another important Point again
532.52s: from a Traders lens which as most of you
536.60s: probably know by now that's the primary
538.80s: lens that I apply when I'm looking at
541.28s: markets because it's how I make a living
543.36s: I I am a Trader so if we take a look at
549.72s: what you can make in something in
551.20s: GameStop what I'm doing is I'm grabbing
553.84s: the coverage strangle as it sits in the
556.88s: portfolio right now here so I can show
560.32s: you what we have so this is the coverage
564.32s: strangle as it sits in
567.28s: GameStop and what this means is on a
570.40s: relative basis you can collect a lot of
573.60s: money relative to how much money you're
576.00s: putting up so right now I still have
579.60s: just 250 shares so that puts me at
583.52s: 28% of my exposure of this 78% in total
587.88s: 28% of it is in shares and this is
590.92s: actually an ideal time for me to start
593.72s: scooping up some more shares now what I
596.68s: don't like to do is buy shares and
599.76s: things as it's Contracting too quickly
601.92s: right cuz I need to see where it goes
604.04s: but now's actually a pretty good
606.08s: accumulation zone now that we see that
608.96s: it's behaved around here pretty well and
612.00s: I actually started looking to buy shares
614.56s: at this breakthrough but I didn't in
617.96s: this model section of the portfolio
620.56s: simply because we don't have that much
623.40s: left meaning we only have 20% of the
625.40s: capital left of an allocated amount the
627.92s: reason why that's so important is
629.08s: because because through the cash secured
631.76s: put side of the equation even as
634.72s: Gamestop is having these kinds of moves
637.92s: it can be really lucrative you can make
639.64s: a lot of money and then again when it
641.76s: looks good you can roll that money into
644.00s: buying shares when you are prepared to
647.56s: so the reason why I'm talking about this
650.24s: opportunity is for this right here this
652.48s: is looking at volatility and you can see
655.00s: that overall implied volatility this is
657.04s: looking at 30-day VA it's absolutely
659.76s: Contracting massively it used to be up
661.80s: to you know 130% now it's down to
665.04s: 93% in this reference range and you can
668.92s: see though that realized volatility
670.68s: which is the Gray Line don't worry about
672.04s: the purple line at all pretend it's not
673.48s: there the gray line is one month
676.12s: realized B so 21 days technically or 20
678.68s: days and you can see that they're
680.48s: starting to converge on one another but
682.08s: there's still so much excess V compared
685.20s: to the realized volatility that leads to
688.72s: Strong opportunity from short premium
690.92s: perspectives which is exactly what the
692.88s: coverage strangle is so now let's take a
696.56s: quick look at GameStop related news and
701.12s: I want to take a look at it starting
702.84s: from here because I saw it come through
706.76s: on a handful of different things so we
710.48s: can see that there was the picture from
713.08s: Ryan Cohen with the former micro
715.56s: strategy CEO Michael sailor which was
718.32s: put the internet of blade
720.04s: lots of people were really really
721.36s: curious about what that all means and
724.44s: GameStop started moving on that I think
727.80s: a lot of people are starting to become
729.24s: curious if GameStop potentially might be
731.80s: getting involved in Bitcoin and you can
734.40s: see they didn't comment on anything I
736.56s: think that right now GameStop is playing
738.44s: their cards pretty close to their chest
740.72s: so you can see that this came across a
744.08s: bunch uh different news sources and it
747.04s: likely is a significant reason behind
749.36s: the price behavior that you see because
752.08s: if there are institutions that see
754.44s: GameStop continuing to make its pivot
756.32s: and they really like the potential
758.04s: Direction it might go then this starts
761.04s: to become really really interesting so
764.76s: overall it looks like the movement
768.68s: towards Bitcoin is really well received
772.68s: it's something that a lot of people have
773.88s: been talking about but we have to wait
775.20s: and see if that's what materializes or
778.00s: not again it looks they're playing the
779.76s: cards really really close to the chest
782.44s: so as always if you have any questions
784.88s: anything you want me to take a look at
786.00s: let me know be an outlier see youall
787.88s: later
