0.68s: what's up outliers our Market recap
3.04s: today is grown to three items because of
6.52s: a requests from somebody in the Discord
8.16s: which I'm happy to accommodate so today
11.24s: we are going to look at chewy we are
13.88s: going to look at Nvidia and we are going
16.80s: to look at GameStop in that order so the
20.00s: reason why I want to start with Chewy is
21.60s: because some of the things we're going
22.92s: to talk about look really interesting
24.60s: for chewy but then as soon as you put it
26.80s: in the context of something like Nvidia
28.76s: it kind of you know you'll see so let's
32.24s: start off with Chewy AKA this is NVIDIA
35.88s: so we have to pull up
37.24s: chewy maybe I can click the box there we
40.28s: go let's start off with Chewy so as
43.92s: expected chewy started just kind of
46.20s: oscillating sideways into this earnings
49.40s: release generally in line with
51.88s: expectations for me I actually had a
53.96s: short strangle on it once I saw this
56.88s: third day really short-term trade but my
59.56s: full expectation was that we were going
61.80s: to start just moving sideways so we kind
64.56s: of continued to see that behavior and
66.80s: now today we are right before earnings
70.84s: which is on the 28th so what's been
74.04s: going on in here well a few things we
76.32s: did see volume expand pretty
79.20s: meaningfully over the last 3 days so if
82.56s: we go back to the 23rd volume was 4.8
85.60s: mil if we go to the 26 6 mil and then if
89.16s: we go to the 27th today 7.8 mil so lots
94.44s: of volume that we saw in chewy so why
100.08s: why is that happening what's going on
101.28s: here my guess is mostly earnings and we
103.72s: saw some options coming out that I want
107.24s: to take a look at that actually do peque
109.84s: my interest a bit because they are
112.52s: relatively interesting for something
114.88s: like chewy and we'll get to those in a
116.84s: second but right now they're expected to
120.00s: report tomorrow and it's before the open
124.40s: so these before the open style reports
127.24s: can be kind of interesting depending on
129.08s: the broader market and what things look
131.68s: like if we look at historically what
135.44s: chewy is done around earnings you can
137.48s: see over its past several Cycles um it's
140.36s: been a mixed bag we had a bit of a gap
142.64s: up in q1 of 24 we ran down in Q4 of 23
149.12s: down again q323 down again q223 Gap up
154.32s: q123 and so on and so forth I'm sure
156.52s: you're able to continue reading uh to
158.64s: the left there so this from a general
162.24s: trading perspective for me is an
165.16s: interesting one because I don't like
167.64s: trading volatility and stuff like this
169.40s: that's all over the map it's both I'm
172.12s: seeing periods where implied as being
175.32s: exceeded like historic post move and
177.56s: then I can't identify near-term clear
180.04s: Trends in terms of How It's behaving
182.84s: after the implied volatility gets beat
185.24s: by historic meaning are we continuing to
187.28s: see positive drift and things moving to
189.20s: the upside as again I said over the last
191.80s: like three quarters it's kind of a mixed
193.24s: bag so I don't like it from in general
196.80s: options trading earnings
198.92s: perspective but I do think that there's
202.28s: some interesting Behavior going on in
204.44s: here that's worth discussing so let's
207.84s: take a look at the options
210.56s: and the first thing before we get into
212.24s: the individual options and stuff let's
213.60s: take a look at the volume today we had
215.40s: 96,000 calls against 44,000 puts and the
219.68s: bulk is for 30 Aug I see these 32s came
223.56s: in at 31,000 contracts and then I see on
227.20s: the put side the 25s came in at just
229.92s: 12,000 so this actually popped up on one
233.00s: of my scanners because these 32s were
235.40s: getting hammered today quite a few times
238.04s: and we'll take a look at that a little
239.36s: bit more inth but what does that mean
242.52s: for General positioning well it's tough
245.96s: to say because it's not a massive amount
248.28s: of money so this could just be a couple
251.12s: medium-sized traders that are out there
253.72s: sharking thinking that something's going
255.56s: on I don't actually attribute a lot of
258.24s: the volume we saw today to any sort of
260.28s: institutional purchasing or anything
261.76s: like that necessarily it could be some
263.20s: of it for sure but it's small enough
266.72s: that it looks like a glorious mix of r
270.00s: people getting involved that's kind of
271.48s: the way I look at it and there were a
272.72s: couple bulk positions that were put on
275.40s: so for
276.48s: example I see these aren't the 32s by
279.20s: the way these are the 34s but I'm seeing
282.48s: these 30 a expirations getting hit in
286.40s: multiple ways so if I filter this really
289.68s: quick and I want to just look at this
293.48s: upcoming series for the 30th of Aug and
297.44s: I want to look at the essentially the
299.72s: 30s to like the 35s or 36s something
303.16s: like that we'll go to the 35s and let's
305.80s: see kind of the the 10 of what's going
308.12s: on here you'll see
309.96s: this so one of the things I picked up
312.76s: here is that at the
315.12s: 32s there's some pretty big volume going
318.48s: on I see 5,000 there I see 5,000 there
322.36s: then I see
324.16s: 3765 here then I see a a smattering of
327.80s: other numbers going on here and what I
329.40s: mean by that is just other strikes that
333.68s: are around these options that these
337.16s: appear to be singles to me so what that
339.76s: means is kind of more of a directional
341.52s: disposition so if we grab something like
344.72s: this unusual whales we can see a few
347.20s: things going on here this is again just
349.80s: kind of looking across the board but
351.16s: it's focusing on just general options
354.08s: activity both bid and offer side calls
356.88s: and puts but you'll see that the top of
358.64s: the board here are these 32s and we see
361.20s: them getting hit at the offer meaning
363.28s: people are buying them now again going
365.48s: back to what I was saying before these
367.60s: 5,000 lots have become
370.04s: very heavily associated with the cat and
374.16s: we also know the cat is in chewy so this
377.16s: would not be surprising at all to me if
380.60s: Roar and kitty is playing some of this
383.40s: earnings
384.60s: release pure speculation I have no idea
389.08s: and the other thing that's really
390.40s: important for everybody to remember is
392.56s: that he's not the only dude that has
394.60s: 5,000 shares or 5,000 lots that they
397.56s: like to move in the people like round
399.56s: numbers one of the things that would be
402.48s: much easier to detect if it's the cat
404.48s: versus somebody else is if he did like
407.84s: 5,9 that would be like a a calling card
410.52s: cuz that's weird but moving larger sizes
414.84s: in round Lots that's it's it's just
417.44s: normal it is just normal so this is
420.72s: super open to speculation really like it
423.16s: would be so easy to argue for or against
426.40s: tremendously so now the one thing I can
428.92s: say based on what I've seen roaring
430.56s: Kitty do previously is that he doesn't
432.88s: seem to buy options that expire in three
434.92s: days I haven't seen him do a lot of that
437.84s: most of his options plays that I've seen
439.52s: him run tend to be a month out give or
441.80s: take which is again a pretty pragmatic
444.08s: approach to trading options especially
446.32s: at the sizes that he tends to run in so
450.00s: is it him I have no idea could it be him
452.36s: absolutely now a couple other notes
454.72s: though is that even for him this is a
458.04s: relatively smaller size but this does
460.36s: start to look more like his size right
462.80s: so if we say for example that he started
465.48s: phasing in in the morning I don't think
467.48s: I've seen him trade at this time
469.52s: previously most of what he's done again
471.40s: in the other fingerprinting I've done
473.08s: for him is towards the end of the day so
475.40s: whether or not this first trunch is him
478.32s: super tough to say I I don't know
480.72s: definitively but I do see some other
484.04s: interesting transactions here that
486.48s: definitely seem to align with standard
488.56s: practice for him which is towards endof
490.16s: day transactions and if you look at the
492.36s: size here it's almost half a million
494.04s: bucks which is small for him but a
497.16s: really large position for just about
498.76s: everybody else that is again if it's the
503.04s: cap I don't know I really don't know
505.76s: it's super hard to say now we spent a
508.16s: little time on the last live stream
509.72s: going through what his position could
511.28s: look like what kind of cash could he
513.24s: have depending on different scenarios
515.44s: and what I do know is that if he bought
518.52s: into chewy and let's just say that he um
521.96s: Unwound his GameStop position to do so
524.12s: and again that's Up For Debate I don't
525.36s: know I'm just using it as a discussion
527.36s: point to try to understand what the
529.20s: account could look like he had about
531.32s: like 260 or 70 million dollar in the
534.60s: account and the day that he bought chewy
537.44s: giving him like the mid price which is
539.12s: about fair for 9 million 1,000 shares
542.48s: that essentially would take up like 232
544.36s: million so all I'm highlighting is that
546.60s: he still has 25 plus million dollar left
550.00s: to play with does that mean that he kept
552.08s: some of his gme stock does that mean
553.80s: that he had more money somewhere else
554.88s: that he ported in none of that I'm not
556.36s: even trying to discuss that I don't know
558.80s: but I'm just trying to give you one
560.28s: scenario where it could be like this
562.60s: would be relatively small if that is the
566.00s: scenario because we know he likes to put
568.16s: on some big freaking trades but this is
570.60s: not tiny right somebody putting on half
573.36s: a million dollars expiring in 3 days
575.76s: again that's nuts so that leads me to
578.64s: believe with some probability that it
581.44s: could be him again I have no idea but
585.36s: this is very interesting to me now what
588.64s: we do know is those options are going to
591.36s: do something tomorrow whether it's good
593.16s: or bad something's going to happen so if
595.48s: we take a look at these 32s which are
597.96s: about a 20 Delta which again based on
600.04s: the cat's fingerprinting that I've done
601.96s: which is fallible I don't know him
603.60s: inside and out but I did take a look
606.08s: pretty in depth at his previous options
607.60s: trades to better understand kind of like
609.24s: his behaviors and 20 Delta is a little
611.48s: bit light for what I've seen him do
613.04s: historically typically it's like a 30
614.64s: Delta something around there but again
616.60s: this still very well could be within the
618.76s: realm of
619.84s: possibility so yeah it is a a really
624.16s: interesting series of Trades that I see
627.44s: going on the volume today in that that
629.44s: expiration was wild 31,000 contracts so
634.16s: what that also tells me is that this is
636.52s: not just the cat if it's him this is
639.80s: more people and if it's not the cat it's
642.24s: a ton of other people because even if we
645.36s: attribute you know these larger block
647.48s: trades to him and let's say that he
649.36s: could have built up 15 20,000 of this
652.84s: that still means probably 15 20,000
656.60s: would be other people so that's much
660.32s: larger even on the residual than all of
662.36s: these others so people are building into
664.52s: these calls heavy really heavy and then
668.24s: when I look at the volume on the put
670.00s: side it's nowhere near what we're seeing
672.56s: on the call side so it tells me that in
675.60s: general the options Market is playing
677.16s: this to the upside now how informed it
679.52s: is or how indicative it is I don't
681.84s: really know but I thought that this was
683.60s: a really interesting call out happy to
685.84s: take a look at it it is going to be
688.32s: something to follow tomorrow
689.96s: that's without a doubt and this is kind
691.36s: of the fun part about earnings is I know
693.32s: that there's other theories right now
694.76s: about FTD cycles and stuff with respect
697.12s: to chewy but honestly that that could be
700.12s: in play here I'm not discounting it but
702.72s: what we're seeing here is dominated in
704.64s: my opinion by options and specifically
707.28s: with respect to earnings this I've
709.60s: looked at previous chewy earnings this
712.32s: here and this is kind of common to see
715.64s: this expansion in volume this expans
719.24s: ition and options activity around the
721.12s: product at least recently so if there is
724.36s: an FTD cycle that happens to coincide
726.40s: with a good earnings look out look out
729.56s: above I mean it can start flying I have
732.68s: no idea TBD we'll find out tomorrow
735.04s: morning not too long all right next we
737.44s: have to take a look at Nvidia again and
739.76s: it's because this is this is the story
743.04s: right now everybody is fascinated by
746.28s: what happens with Nvidia myself included
748.40s: and again the same exact pattern this
751.04s: sideways Trend into earnings quieting
753.68s: down daily ranges Contracting if we take
756.92s: a look at the 5day ATR average true
760.56s: range which is um including gaps or if
763.16s: we want to isolate it down to the ADR
765.68s: which is probably even better we can see
767.72s: that the 5-day ADR is now down to 4.3%
770.60s: whereas the 20-day was over 6% so it's
773.52s: just gotten way quiet intraday relative
776.36s: still moving for sure but relative quiet
778.84s: and
779.64s: the big thing about Nvidia is that it
781.36s: makes up a lot of the market it it's
784.04s: everywhere it's in the semiconductors
786.72s: ETFs which are going to be highly
788.48s: dependent on what happens here it's in
790.28s: the S&P 500 is a pretty big percentage
792.20s: almost 10% it's in the q's also so it's
795.64s: like this is going to be a really
798.00s: important release and it's wild to say
800.64s: but we have one stock One stock that can
804.52s: move the whole market right now that and
806.88s: that that is not being hyperbolic which
809.44s: I was practicing yesterday hopefully I'm
810.84s: getting better at it so that I can rake
812.44s: in all the views I realize that I got to
814.28s: get more hyperbolic in my speech in
815.64s: order to get my rep up so that's about
817.72s: as hyperbolic as I get but it's honestly
820.20s: not even a hyperbole like this really
822.16s: can move the entire Market by itself so
825.80s: if we take a look at the options and and
827.72s: I want to show you why I wanted to start
829.32s: with Chewy because we're talking about
830.76s: cool stuff right we're talking about
832.32s: half a million dollar position and then
834.80s: if you grab Nvidia it's just like
840.20s: you don't even get below a million until
842.60s: you hold on let's see what let's see how
844.24s: far we have to scroll you have to get
846.28s: down here before you drop below a
847.96s: million the top position is a $10
851.52s: million position
854.72s: so it's just a different scale it's just
858.28s: different and this I absolutely believe
861.56s: is an earnings play it's just a smart
863.60s: earnings play because they're going far
866.04s: out in time and they're going deep in
867.72s: the money this is an institution clearly
870.44s: this is somebody who knows what they're
871.80s: doing that are really trying to position
873.68s: for an explosive upward movement
876.24s: hopefully for them because this is a
879.20s: it's a huge position bro and there's a
882.40s: possibility that this is the same person
885.76s: because we have the 80s being hit pretty
887.88s: close to one another at size and then
890.40s: some and I mean this easily could be $20
893.80s: million position that you're looking at
895.32s: right here from somebody just looking to
897.60s: run this thing up it will be uh just
901.28s: fascinating because if you want to talk
903.28s: about money moving this is it man this
906.64s: is some of the most money you can find
909.96s: in an intraday or in a daily basis of an
913.08s: options chain that's not like a big
914.80s: index itself if you're looking at SPX
916.72s: and stuff like that they're typically
917.92s: pretty large but Nvidia here is this is
920.72s: just wild man like this is tens of
923.72s: millions of dollars just today literally
926.72s: just today so if take a look at the
931.12s: positioning as we get into oh my God
934.48s: look at that just it's man it's lit up
940.08s: like a Christmas tree all of this green
942.40s: means that it's net ads over yesterday
945.00s: in terms of the volume and then if you
947.08s: look at the volume today it's massive
950.08s: new volume blowing up again 35,000 here
953.84s: 20,000 here 53,000 here 38,000 here like
957.36s: this is just massive position
960.56s: 61,000 here 43,000
964.60s: 85,000 so there there is just massive
968.44s: massive buildout happening right now on
970.76s: this product which is just honestly kind
972.44s: of fun to see to see this much money
974.48s: moving this is a massive amount of money
978.08s: that's flowing through here and if you
980.12s: take a look at the volume just today 1.4
983.88s: million calls against 886 th000 puts and
988.52s: earnings in here is not until after the
990.28s: close tomorrow which is also interesting
992.84s: there's a really good chance that I will
994.76s: try to play this directionally almost
997.36s: because I don't know how you can't it's
1000.48s: just it's just that interesting to me we
1003.08s: have some really really really big put
1006.16s: transactions
1008.44s: 16,850 of these 90 puts so this is
1011.72s: obviously some sort of uh hedging
1013.80s: activity for probably somebody that I
1015.60s: imagine has a big old stock position
1018.04s: that they're looking to
1019.40s: hold through the
1021.00s: release I mean just an incredible amount
1024.76s: of money moving in here so for this
1026.60s: upcoming expiration cycle
1029.92s: 78,000 against 423,000
1033.20s: volume um calls to puts respectively
1035.80s: open interest right now just for this
1037.60s: expiration cycle is 1 million calls
1039.28s: against 921,000 puts so not a clear
1042.24s: disparity here yet I think we need to
1044.68s: see the volume from today get integrated
1046.96s: into the oi before coming up with many
1049.40s: uh firm decisions there but yeah
1051.60s: tomorrow is going to be interesting
1052.96s: because from a General market
1055.40s: perspective it's kind of quiet there's
1056.76s: not a whole lot I think there's uh a Fed
1059.36s: speaker if we take a look really quick
1061.16s: we can see uh What's happen yeah so for
1063.60s: the 28th we have crude oil inventories
1066.64s: and bastage is speaking so it's like not
1069.04s: not a whole lot crude oil is semi-
1070.80s: topical now but like not massively big
1073.48s: so it's kind of all eyes on
1075.48s: Nvidia and then the crowd favorite the
1078.20s: hometown favorite the mascot GameStop
1080.84s: and another down day
1084.48s: so kind of have to expect it at this
1087.04s: point again it's still marking earnings
1089.12s: right now for the 4th of September and
1091.76s: actually in a video that I did because a
1093.56s: lot of people based on the video
1095.16s: yesterday they're like yo what do you
1096.56s: think about earnings maybe not being on
1099.52s: the fourth which is actually one of the
1102.20s: hypothesis that came up on Sunday I
1104.00s: talked about that there because when I'm
1106.16s: looking at the implied volatility in
1108.88s: here this still doesn't line up to me we
1111.52s: are seeing this ball stand up for the
1114.28s: six a little bit but the fact that this
1116.52s: is still 78 to 96% in 13 step one of my
1121.00s: underlying hypothesis right now is still
1123.00s: that earnings might
1124.20s: move uh the the the reason why I'm not
1128.40s: fully confident in that is cuz like
1130.68s: we're we're coming up on time here right
1133.00s: so the fourth is next Wednesday we're
1135.96s: essentially a week out you can't wait
1138.12s: forever before you actually confirm when
1140.84s: your earnings is going to be released so
1143.40s: I can't help but find that a little
1145.36s: intriguing but it does look like there's
1148.76s: a pretty significant discrepancy here so
1151.20s: if it does move it wouldn't surprise me
1153.00s: but if it does move I would also expect
1155.32s: that to happen soon because again we we
1158.08s: are coming up on time here now the last
1161.80s: thing when I was looking at GameStop I
1163.64s: was taking a look at the open interest
1165.28s: which this is now starting to contract a
1167.28s: little bit so for total calls there's
1170.28s: 550,000 against 273,000 puts so this is
1175.08s: now moving away from the 2:1 ratio that
1178.12s: I typically like to see in something
1179.52s: like this so my My overall idea here is
1182.52s: the same as it's been my my guess is we
1184.76s: are going to be relatively quiet into
1187.24s: earnings that's my guess if we take a
1189.72s: look at this front expiration it's
1191.92s: 114,000 calls against 26,000 puts so
1194.72s: still massive call skew on the front
1196.88s: expirations but
1199.52s: it's just not that much so relatively
1203.28s: quiet from an options front now when I
1205.68s: look at the chart here again this down
1207.96s: move is kind of continued you can see
1210.20s: the levels I'm interested in I think
1212.44s: that we offer at least a first look at
1216.40s: some level of support where it's kind of
1218.28s: bumping up to here coming up on 20 35ish
1221.40s: something like that and then below that
1223.96s: there's a longer term volume node that
1226.12s: I'm anchoring this off of kind of this
1227.96s: value Gap
1229.44s: and it's starting to coincide with the
1231.56s: 200 day moving average so we have to see
1235.76s: if GameStop grabs a footing here now for
1238.12s: me a couple other breath indicators that
1240.16s: I don't love is the RSI both moving
1243.36s: average and RSI itself have now tucked
1246.64s: below the 50 line which is kind of
1249.96s: bullish bearish separator on a broad
1251.92s: scale and we also have the uh let me
1255.96s: Zoom this up for you you can see that
1259.44s: the RSI is now kind of peaked below
1262.96s: negative sloping below the EMA which in
1266.48s: this case I'm using a 4-day EMA which is
1268.24s: pretty fast so it does look like a bit
1270.96s: of negative momentum here from a volume
1273.32s: perspective it's still quiet out there 4
1275.24s: million shares so a little bit higher
1277.96s: than the 5day average still below the 20
1280.48s: and it looks like some sideways action
1282.92s: slight downtrend leading into the
1285.48s: earnings release or until we have
1287.12s: another Catalyst whatever that looks
1288.72s: like so that's what it's looking like
1290.88s: today there's no live stream later today
1293.00s: cuz I'm doing a podcast that uh I'm
1295.44s: lining up with somebody on a different
1296.80s: time zone so I have to consume the uh
1299.24s: the later time but as always anything
1302.24s: you want me to take a look at let me
1304.12s: know hit me up be an outlier see you
1306.16s: guys later
