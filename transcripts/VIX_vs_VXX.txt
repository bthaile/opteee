0.36s: everybody as promised I have another
2.97s: video comparing the VIX to the VXX
6.89s: volatility is awesome their products
9.21s: that I really enjoy
10.50s: they're very nuanced I'm actually
12.93s: talking with one of my friends right now
14.61s: who spent a lot of time learning about
17.67s: volatility so I'm hoping to have him
19.74s: come on and talk to us a little bit
21.24s: about what he's learned bring some of
23.43s: his experience to the table as well
24.75s: because I absolutely respect his opinion
27.03s: on on this stuff but to kind of prep us
31.05s: for that conversation and settle up on a
32.91s: couple you know basic I don't know
36.78s: similarly similarities and differences
38.76s: between the two I figure this is a good
40.44s: place to start so first we have the VIX
43.83s: and then the VXX
45.84s: they are different they are similar but
48.93s: they are different let's start with the
51.33s: similarities and then I'll branch into
53.31s: the differences so both of them have
55.83s: options available to trade on them they
58.74s: both track in some capacity the
62.87s: volatility of the sp500 they both are
67.89s: mean reverting and they both find
72.92s: expansion with heightened volatility and
76.17s: then they both you know tend to fall
78.53s: with lower volatility and another thing
82.41s: that's not on here but is just velocity
84.39s: of movement if I pull one up just for
88.20s: general context let's do the VIX I'm
92.91s: going to zoom out a little bit this
94.08s: church will close so you can see it went
97.83s: from you know essentially 14 dollars to
101.01s: 85 that is a parabolic style move and
105.71s: both of these products will have
108.30s: movements like that
110.58s: due to their structure they rise and
112.98s: fall rapidly with changes in volatility
115.70s: so now let's shift over to the VIX some
118.71s: traits that are specific to the VIX the
121.44s: VIX has no underlying so what that means
124.44s: is there's there's no stock you can't
126.30s: you can't trade the VIX itself and I can
129.66s: show you this because if I pull up the
132.00s: VIX
133.80s: there are options but notice how there's
138.58s: no bid there's no ass there's no size
140.38s: there's no volume there's no underlying
143.02s: here the only thing that VIX does is
145.87s: track the S&P 500 implied volatility and
151.60s: we can check that out pretty easily
152.80s: because so right now the VIX is at 28 22
155.62s: so if I type in the SPX and then I go to
159.52s: its volatility we see 28:13 so it tracks
168.97s: the sp500 in this instance the SPX
173.38s: volatility it does have vro settlement
177.67s: on Wednesdays which is a little bit
179.68s: different than most options and you know
183.73s: ETF CPM stuff like that so not really a
186.76s: truly impactful one but one that's good
189.46s: to know
190.05s: so then if I move over to the VXX
193.98s: unlike the VIX the VXX
197.17s: has in underlying there is stock so if I
201.07s: pull this up we can see that there's a
203.08s: bid there's an ass there's a size
204.49s: there's volume there's all these the
206.17s: components of an ETF MTM the difference
210.19s: between between that is the fact that
215.97s: part of your strategy depending on your
218.95s: disposition towards it you can include
221.29s: holding an underlying now VXX is a
226.17s: forward-looking projection of the VIX so
230.62s: VX VIX the VIX tracks the current sp500
236.92s: volatility v XX is a forward-looking
241.38s: projection of fix like a lot of other ET
246.37s: ends that we see it's a futures based
248.92s: product so that means that it's in a
251.20s: portfolio that uses futures to track the
255.28s: price of the VEX
256.87s: so it uses /vx futures and what that
261.07s: means is it's very susceptible to drag
263.44s: the reason being is that means
266.79s: every single month it'll look at two
268.62s: different futures so I can actually show
270.60s: you so if I poke the Dex we can see that
274.50s: there's the front month which is the
276.78s: closest to expiration contract and then
280.05s: it uses the next month so the following
283.98s: expiration in is you'll see there's the
286.62s: difference in price here so right now we
289.95s: actually see a little bit of
290.94s: backwardation where the further out
293.40s: futures are a little bit cheaper than
295.56s: the current futures so there's no drag
297.69s: here however if these are switched which
300.57s: they typically will be because we are
302.13s: generally in a state of contained up
304.29s: which is where the further dated futures
309.54s: contracts will be priced more
311.79s: expensively like these so what will
315.39s: happen will more in contango is we one
318.87s: weight gets to expiration we have to
320.91s: close out this front month pay whatever
323.34s: it is to close and then we have to
326.25s: establish a new position in the further
329.88s: out month so if you can see the
332.19s: difference here in this exact scenario
334.41s: with the VXX we would have the portfolio
337.05s: will have these May 20 features and then
341.79s: it'll also be dispersed expiration for
344.28s: June 20 features so as soon as it's time
347.40s: to roll these May 20 out we have to buy
349.92s: the next June expiration which we're
353.01s: trading for 3125 so if we're going to
355.80s: close our current position at 2995 and
357.96s: then establish a new one buying at 31 25
361.29s: you can see were paying more than what
364.47s: we're getting over time that erodes the
366.57s: value of the product so that's why
368.94s: you'll see reverse splits and stuff like
371.52s: that over time to keep the product in
374.16s: existence essentially the VXX because
377.40s: it's a TT n it settles Friday so normal
379.65s: normal settlement there and then
382.29s: something else that is of know is that
385.26s: the VXX
386.28s: tends to have slightly lower volatility
389.19s: than the VIX and the reason for that is
393.03s: because if we're talking about the same
394.98s: Delta option and the reason for that is
397.53s: because the VXX
398.76s: is made up of
400.62s: both front month and the following month
403.86s: futures so there's a little bit of a
406.11s: buffer decreasing some of the you know
408.57s: typical gamma risk and things like that
411.00s: and is specifically Vega risk in this
413.31s: instance which is you know changes to
416.28s: implied volatility so vixx has a little
418.62s: bit of a dampened sensation for that due
421.74s: to being spread across two different
423.18s: explorations so I like to trade the vixx
426.51s: personally it's got really good
427.71s: volatility it does suffer from decay so
430.71s: you've got to make sure you plan that
432.09s: into your you know strategy I would
434.85s: never ever ever just be long shares of
437.22s: vixx for any period of time simply
440.94s: because if you sit there and you hold it
444.20s: while you're waiting for some sort of
446.43s: big pop involved Billy a lot of people
448.47s: try to do that well if it goes from 13
450.39s: up to 78 you know that that's a ton of
452.94s: money you can make it's absolutely true
454.29s: and if you time it right there's no
456.09s: doubt you would do well but the problem
458.19s: is is you can find yourself holding it
459.75s: for extended periods of time every
461.88s: single month every voice really every
464.07s: week when we're rolling you'll just see
465.90s: those options or the futures rolling out
469.20s: causing decay eroding the value of the
471.81s: position so realistically you're paying
474.54s: for it you're not really having any sort
476.37s: of free lunch they're just waiting for
477.93s: this big pop to happen and then this is
480.51s: also the same exact reason why I always
482.67s: caution people against being short any
485.76s: sort of volatility product without
487.28s: coverage meaning a spread I like to sell
490.08s: calls right if I'm bearish I think
491.91s: something's going to come down and we
493.71s: know that this is a mean reverting
495.99s: product so you would better believe that
497.37s: when I see vixx have certain levels I
499.65s: immediately take short positions in it
501.39s: but it's always a short credit spread so
504.30s: I sell and buy and the reason is because
507.33s: of these binary movements these huge
509.28s: movements can really hurt an account
511.92s: even though you'll know to come down at
513.60s: some point in time if you're accounting
515.58s: a margin call and you can't successfully
517.29s: you know add enough money to meet the
520.26s: margin requirement they're going to
521.40s: force you to neutralize it at that time
522.78s: so you're gonna have to close those
523.65s: positions at a bad loss so I just don't
526.92s: want to expose myself to any of that
528.21s: whatsoever so I am always interested in
532.29s: shorting
534.27s: up like the VXX and the VIX when I see
536.55s: them you know at certain levels certain
538.74s: highs and that's great however always
543.75s: always always highly recommend keeping
546.66s: some sort of coverage to the upside risk
549.39s: because those binary moves can really
551.28s: like I said caused a tremendous change
553.20s: in your buying power requirement or your
554.79s: margin requirement so that's kind of the
557.01s: big difference between the the VIX vixx
559.29s: in terms of the structure how we can
560.70s: trade them I absolutely like I said
562.92s: prefer the VXX I find that the liquidity
565.98s: is good and I like that there is an
569.58s: underlying involved and I can also count
572.40s: on the decay or the drag over time when
576.21s: we're in contango and I can see when
577.50s: that's going to happen in queerly
578.82s: increase the likelihood of it returning
581.61s: to Ameen so I can use some of those
583.56s: components to help inform my strategy
585.78s: and decision making so if you have any
588.03s: questions on either of these let me know
589.35s: great products to add to your tool kit
591.00s: there are some nuances that you got to
592.80s: be mindful of but that doesn't mean we
594.30s: shouldn't try them alright catch you
595.89s: guys later
