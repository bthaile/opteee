0.00s: What's up, outliers? If you are not using AI as a trader, you are so far behind the
5.46s: ball. The goal of this video is to walk you through a no frills tutorial on how to
11.10s: use AI as an options trader. As you can see, that there's three steps we're going to go
15.78s: over right above my head. Then I'm going to walk you through a list of prompts to give
21.06s: you some ideas for how to approach this thing. We're going to talk about comparing different
27.46s: AI tools. Then we're going to spend time doing an actual practical application together
34.26s: live. I'm going to go through without anything pre-generated so that you can see how to
40.02s: do this alongside me. As you know, I don't edit my videos, so this will be straight
44.66s: all the way through. What's up, everyone? Eric here. Welcome back to the outliers. Let's
47.82s: talk about this. AI is literally changing everything. It accelerates quite literally
54.38s: everything you do, but you have to be thoughtful about how you approach this thing because
59.62s: it's very easy to get lost in the sauce and go all over the place. We're going to start
63.58s: with always a template. Just like in the Marine Corps, we tend to start with what we call
69.02s: an orientation. This is a landscape analysis. This is where you provide an overview of
74.74s: what things look like as they sit today. This is normally after we do something called
80.30s: reconnaissance. We're going to do all the same things just in a slightly different, less
85.46s: fun sense, but all still very cool. Before we start anything, we have to start thinking
94.10s: through what we do as traders. What are the tasks we perform? What are the steps we take
101.66s: to do things? How do we find ideas? Where do we conduct our research? These are just things
106.42s: to have in the back of your mind because as we go through the step on prompt engineering,
111.98s: understanding what you do and then some of the capabilities will then inform how you
117.10s: might phrase things. Now, it's important to understand that AI is not omnipotent. It
123.82s: very frequently is wrong. You have absolutely got to be still the ultimate decision maker,
130.94s: the thinking part of things, the way to look at AI is that it is an accelerator. It is
137.26s: not the end all be all. It will say things very confidently that sometimes are wrong. So
142.94s: you have to be ready to fact check what you're seeing to make sure that you're comfortable
147.06s: with the responses that you're getting. There's a couple ways we can go about that which
150.70s: we'll talk about. Now, landscape analysis. This is where we have a chance to take a look
156.02s: at different AI tools as they exist and what they're capable of. So again, my preference
163.30s: is not to answer things for you but help you figure out how to answer things for yourselves.
169.02s: And we can jump into Google. We can throw into something like AI comparison chart or AI
174.02s: comparison or whatever you want. I just grabbed two of them from literally the top. I think
178.06s: I normally skip the top one because I normally assume that it's a sponsored post. Go to
183.46s: the second one and I haven't looked through this yet but you can see that it absolutely
187.62s: is giving you some high level overview of all of these different language models. And then
194.06s: same thing for this one, we can see what different tools exist and what they can do. So things
199.70s: like chatchipity and llama definitely are a little more diverse. Now to give you the cheat
208.34s: code version of all this for what I personally like to use, it's actually what you see on
212.66s: the thumbnail. I like to use chatchipity for general reasoning and back and forth dialogue.
219.78s: I like to use perplexity for researching things in terms of I want you to go find research
225.58s: on this or provide background studies on this perplexity is good at that. And then I like
232.46s: to use GROC for what happened in the stock market today. Look through X and look through
240.78s: Wall Street bets and see what the most commonly talked about tickers were that kind of stuff.
246.70s: Now part of this is you just have to tinker figure out what you like. There are other tools
251.30s: like clawed which can really help with things like programming, which is one of the accelerators
257.50s: that we'll talk about. The main note is you have to start with this process, understanding
264.94s: the landscape, meaning what tools there are, what their capabilities and limitations are.
270.38s: So that you know when you're going through and you're doing your prompting, you can find
274.50s: things that work best. Again, I already gave you the Cliff Notes version of what I found
278.98s: to work so far. I'll use chatchipity for reasoning and that's kind of my go to unless I'm doing
283.78s: something like research. Let's now move on to the execution step. How do we use them?
291.34s: Well, first, after we go through the information we find in step one, what I think makes sense
298.66s: is to think about those things that you do as a trader and create categories. So here's
305.10s: some categories to get your mind started learning for a lot of people learning how to trade,
311.26s: learning how to be better traders is a significant focus. So that's the very first thing you can
317.54s: use AI for. It can be your teacher to look at news for you to synthesize the markets as
326.70s: they sit to synthesize economic data as it's coming out for general analysis. The next one
333.78s: here is researching. So you can start thinking through maybe I want to run a strategy that does
339.66s: this. I can help you with that. Helping you build a trading plan, strategy outlines, log
347.46s: developments. This is what you will find on my YouTube channel and I have videos about creating
353.46s: trading plans and stuff like that, creating strategies. I have all of this stuff for you,
358.10s: but you can use AI to help you frame your ideas, things through different ways to set up
363.38s: how you want things to sit. And then one of my favorite ways to use it is as a process
369.20s: auditor. One of the really big things that I'm a massive advocate of is external audits.
374.94s: This is where you provide information to somebody that's not yourself to take an objective
378.98s: look through what you're doing, what you're thinking, how you're processing things. And
383.06s: not necessarily to give you direct feedback, although that's always great, but even just
386.82s: to ask you questions, why are you doing it this way? Why are you doing it this way? That
390.86s: can be a really beneficial process just from a general learning perspective. So now that
396.90s: we know what AI can help us with, we know what kind of AI tools there are, we know how
403.30s: the different AI tools behave. We know the different areas that we want to use AI to
409.94s: help us. Well, now we get into the process of actually using AI. So I want to walk you
415.06s: through prompt engineering at a high level. I'm going to walk you through some basic
418.50s: prompts. And then we're literally going to go into the Prack app right after that.
422.02s: Now, one other AI tool that I did not list that I do think is worth your time, especially
427.10s: if you use Google's Gemini, because one of the cool things about Gemini is you can use
431.54s: it in conjunction with all of the files that you have on Google Drive. So I have a giant
438.82s: category of research that I've downloaded from all different places like SSR and I literally
444.34s: can use Gemini to query against all of it at once, which is insanely useful. And for those
451.06s: that are in the outlier pro Patreon, you already have a file with all of those different studies,
456.58s: and you literally can do the same thing. It's one of the cool things about Gemini's integration.
462.26s: It's just something you should be aware of. All right. So let's get into prompt engineering.
467.62s: Prompt engineering is an iterative process. Sometimes you're going to ask it things or tell
472.50s: to do things and it's not going to do what you want or it's going to give you different results.
475.62s: And you have to coach it. So think of it not as whatever you get is the answer, but be ready to
483.14s: walk it onto target so that it actually is giving you the information you need. You have to be
489.54s: very, very thoughtful in how you're phrasing things. You're literally talking to a robot.
495.62s: So don't be lazy in your language. Don't take it as it's going to understand
502.18s: anything that you're saying the subtext of what you're trying to teach it. Now,
506.58s: one of the things that's useful is some models provide a space where it can learn you,
512.74s: and then over time it can become more efficient, which is actually very helpful.
517.30s: You should always use it to teach you what to ask it. So you can start a process,
524.50s: and then you could be stuck and you could say, huh, I don't know what to ask yet. So you could say,
530.50s: give me five questions. Do you think I should ask you next? That kind of thing.
534.90s: And then another thing that's super important is always make it give you sources. Again,
539.38s: this is so that you can verify what it's giving you because it's not always going to be correct.
543.78s: Actually very frequently, unfortunately, it'll have errors. So here are a list of prompts. And if
550.18s: you'll notice that these prompts are actually tied to these categories over here. Guess what I did?
556.10s: I went into perplexity and I said, create a list of five questions for each of these topics.
566.02s: I'm not going through all these with you. I'm just showing you an idea on how you can use it.
570.50s: And then these should give you some inspiration. But I actually want to move to the practical
576.02s: application part of this because I think that's what's going to be most useful to you.
581.14s: So I want to go through each of these at a very high level to give you ideas on what you can ask,
588.26s: how you can ask it so that you can get the information that you want. So first things first is to
594.34s: prime the AI. So this is the only question I asked in this chain is you can tell them scrolling
599.86s: up scrolling down. This is in perplexity. One of the things that I like about perplexity is that
604.66s: you can tell it to use different AI engines. So right now, even though I'm in perplexity,
610.26s: I'm actually using chat GPT Omni. So the first thing I tell it is I am an options trader. You are
618.10s: going to perform all these functions for me. Are you ready to rock and roll? This was more just
623.86s: much just for fun. Ask if it's ready to rock and roll. So let's start. Let's say that we are a new
630.34s: options trader and we are trying to learn how to trade options. Let's use AI to assist with this.
638.42s: Now if you're an advanced trader, you literally can apply the same thing. What you were all learning.
643.70s: So the only difference is the question you ask might be slightly different. We'll go through two
648.34s: variations to give you two different levels beginner and advanced. So let's say I'm a new options trader
656.50s: looking to learn more about options and how they work.
664.98s: Create an outline similar to a class syllabus on what you think I should focus on.
678.90s: Use units and topics for each unit.
688.34s: So you can see I'm actually purposely making this a little sloppy. This isn't that descriptive.
694.82s: But let's see what it comes up with and it's actually exactly what I want. So it's giving me a general
700.98s: unit for the topic and then subtopics for each. So now what I want to do is scroll through this.
708.18s: It looks okay. And I want this to be more comprehensive. Make this more in depth and include
716.82s: outlines for each subtopic and item. So now I'm telling it to go deeper. I want it to be
727.54s: further in depth. And I want it to give me more information about each of these. So far,
734.90s: this is giving me a perfect outline. So what I do after this once it finishes,
743.70s: I'm going to tell it to create lessons for all topics in unit one. Create lesson, create a lesson
754.74s: for one dot one. And I didn't do all just because it'll take a little while.
762.26s: So now I'm literally having it teach me. It's teaching me. Pretty cool, huh?
770.50s: Now after you go through learning about the basics of options like this, as with any class you've
777.22s: ever taken, we need to verify what we learned. Help me verify what I've learned.
788.10s: Create a quiz with 10 multiple choice and true false. Five paragraph or five scenario based.
807.62s: Open responses. And one deeper case study with a more comprehensive response.
822.34s: Prepare an answer key. But do not show it to me until I ask. Now we can use chat GPT to help us verify
841.46s: what we've learned after what it just gave us. Now there's other really cool prompts you can do
848.18s: with this once it finishes going through this. And the point that I'm trying to illustrate here is
856.26s: this is literally restricted only by your imagination. And something that I'm building right now for
864.82s: the Patreon folks is a really big list of prompts. The cool part is you don't need that. You literally
872.50s: can make your own using this. It's just a process of iterating and thinking of different things.
878.42s: You can ask it. So here it is. It's giving us our multiple choice questions. It's giving us our
884.02s: true false questions. It's giving us our scenario based questions. And then it's giving us an actual
889.22s: case study. So there we go. So now if you're a more advanced options trader, maybe we're trying to
897.62s: learn how to build our own volatility surface. So let's switch this up. I am an advanced options trader
909.22s: and want to build my own volatility surface model.
916.18s: Walk me through how to build one in could be Excel Python whatever you want in we'll start with Excel.
931.78s: So you can see even as a more seasoned investor, you can have it walk you through slightly more
939.78s: complex data points so that you can create your very own surface model if you were so inclined.
948.66s: So this is learning. Now I already told you that I like to use GROC for news and market analysis,
954.82s: but let's just stick in here for now. And let's start with something basic like summarize
959.46s: the stock market news for today include any key economic data points
971.06s: and
974.90s: US based news
980.98s: trending individual stocks crypto currencies
992.50s: and upcoming events for tomorrow.
996.90s: Now what I've definitely noticed is I like to input dates now. So 16d 24 because a lot of times
1006.18s: it will mess up on the dates. So now first we're just giving it a general thing we haven't given
1013.30s: it a format. We haven't really told it what we wanted to do. And this is how it's summarizing it,
1019.14s: which so far this looks good. So we can see it's talking about EVGO and video,
1024.18s: balance here, SMCI, dropping 12 points, which is kind of funny. And this looks completely fine
1032.02s: for a summary, but you can have it go further in depth. So let's say that we wanted to track US
1040.98s: manufacturer and PMI. We could have it give us historic PMI figures or we can open up the source
1049.06s: that shows it to us and go find it for ourselves. What I like to do is outline a specific template
1056.34s: that I want it to use. And I tell it to save it so I can tell it remember this format as stock market
1067.38s: update for today. We'll throw that in quotes for it. And we're essentially telling you remember
1074.66s: the format. Now sometimes it'll save it, sometimes it'll go through and run the analysis again
1081.78s: like it's doing right now. But now when I ask it again, it will default to that. Now again,
1088.50s: depending on if you use GPT, which is very good at this, use Proplexive. It's a little less
1093.30s: rememberful. So I just save the actual prompts that I want and then I can just copy and paste them in.
1100.02s: Okay, so now let's check out researching an idea. So let's say I want to trade earnings releases
1107.46s: with options. Help me build a strategy. First, research, first find any research
1121.38s: regarding trading options around earnings and summarize the key themes for me.
1133.54s: We're off to the races. Now, if you don't know about a specific thing that you might want to do
1137.54s: like this, you could zoom it up and you could say, I'm interested in trading options. Give me ideas
1144.10s: on how I can trade options for blank trade options for things going up, trade options for things
1152.34s: going down trade options for earnings trade volatility. So this is walking you through with
1158.10s: citations from different places about what happens around earnings and how you can place different
1166.58s: ideas. Next one. Now that we know that there's an effect around earnings that we might want to
1173.06s: trade, let's say I wanted to create a strategy outline for me to test you trade options around
1186.26s: the IV contraction of earnings. So now I'm having it skip us down to this. I'm having it going to
1200.74s: outline a strategy for us to test. Now, notice I say for me to test because you should not take
1205.62s: whatever whatever it gives you. That's not good. We need it to give us some ideas like this,
1213.78s: but then we're going to have to test it. So then that's actually the next step. I'm going to have it
1220.34s: outline a trade log template for Excel that I can use to test this strategy.
1232.18s: So now I don't even have to think about what format might make sense in Excel if I don't know how
1236.02s: to do it. I can have it give me something to start with. And there you go. Notice how it gives you
1246.02s: specifically the elements that are most important for the trade itself. Now we can also have it
1253.46s: build me a pre-trade checklist that applies to all trades I place.
1263.62s: Then for this specific strategy, build the unique things I should check before entering the trade.
1281.94s: So what I'm doing is I'm having it build a standardized trade checklist that I comply to everything.
1288.10s: And I'm having it build the specific things that matter for this individual strategy.
1293.46s: So that's exactly what I do in my own stuff. I have a standardized template for a pre-trade checklist.
1298.58s: I don't fill it out anymore. It's kind of mental. But then for each individual strategy that I have,
1303.06s: there are things that are specific to the strategy itself. And notice how it's finding the specific
1308.74s: things that matter to the strategy itself. Perfect. So now let's ask it for this last part.
1317.78s: Process audit can be done in a lot of different ways. You can upload documents to it. You can explain
1324.66s: out a trade that you put on in detail and ask it for points of feedback. So process audit has
1332.98s: everything to do with using it to help you optimize what you're doing. So let's say for my earnings
1343.46s: strategy, evaluate the process as it sits and give me ideas on how I can improve it.
1355.46s: So now I'm having it literally audit what it gave me pretending that I made up elements of it.
1365.30s: And it's literally given me very specific actionable things that I can do to make this better.
1372.42s: So I can look at better historical data analysis, which is really good. Analyzing expected move versus
1378.26s: actual move, which is super important. This is literally exactly how you can use this.
1384.34s: So there are so many opportunities. The last thing I want to show you is this.
1391.14s: What other questions should I ask you about the earnings strategy?
1399.06s: So I'm literally teaching it or telling it to tell me what I should ask it,
1406.74s: aka teaching myself to know what I don't know.
1411.78s: So it's giving me exactly one of the, that's why I'm smiling. One of the first questions I think
1417.30s: is important to ask is when should I enter? It's telling you you can have it then go down this
1424.10s: thread of teach me more about the timing. Take time, tinker with this. This is probably the
1430.26s: biggest accelerator that's right in front of you. This has the ability to literally transform
1438.42s: a regular traders approach into something that's much closer to a professional with very little
1444.98s: effort. It'll never replace the experience, but I wish I had this. As always, if there's any
1450.74s: questions, anything you want me to talk about, make a video on, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you
