 All right, man, we're live. Chris, what's up, man? How much are you doing? Doing awesome. Thank you. I always love like the video intro after the introduction conversation that goes on for 10 minutes. They're always good. But it's always super stoked to have a conversation with you. I really enjoy your perspective. We were talking a little bit about that. I think that's one of the the funnest parts about having you on the channel is a chance to offer, at least my side of the house, a completely different perspective on a lot of things. Even though I do think that a lot of the bases of where we approach the market is pretty similar. So with that being said, I would love to start with kind of that first conversation we're just talking about. Something that my viewers and general are curious about and rightfully slow is just the idea of inflation. When we first started seeing it happen, it seemed like the Fed was really into it being more transitory. Something that's not necessarily going to be super persistent. They didn't want to necessarily have a big hand in it, those kinds of things. But we'd love to hear just your general thoughts on it. Don't need to go in any specific detail on policy or anything like that. But just your thoughts on inflation environment right now and then more importantly, what it looks like maybe for the next six months. That's a really difficult question. First of all, I'm not a macroeconomic expert by any means. But I do listen to a lot of podcasts and one thing that I've basically the general message that I've picked up from all the conversations that I've looked at is that everyone kind of has their own specific inflation rate. But one of the big things to point out I think is when we started to see the high inflation prints, a lot of people are saying that it was from the base effect, which is basically like if you look at a year prior to the current readings, when inflation was super low and then you go a year forward and prices are normalizing, the disparity between those numbers gets distorted because you're comparing a high number to the low point. Right. We're going to pass that and the CPI number. I think it's around like 5% right now, which is obviously really high. All I know generally is inflation and the super low rate environment that we have right now basically forces everybody into higher risk positions. Right. If you can eat chance whatsoever at having positive return. Right. So for me, just seeing the higher levels of inflation and even like the fear of higher inflation going forward, that's pushing more people into things like the stock market, real estate and crypto I think are like the three big things. I would say gold but gold is down this year. Yeah. Interestingly, I actually think it's very interesting that gold's down 8% this year and gold is supposed to be the inflation hedge. Right. So like when inflation starts to pick up, gold's supposed to be the asset that everyone turns to to protect their purchasing power. Right. And gold is actually down this year. So yeah, it started what at like 1960 something and now it's like covered right around 18. I'm looking at GLD right now. So GLD started the year at 180, 182 and now it's at 168. So if you parked your money in gold, then you're down 8% but if you parked your money in digital gold, aka Bitcoin, you're up 100%. So I think a little bit of that could be a rotation out of gold and into Bitcoin. Do you think they serve the same purpose to people's portfolios? Because like at least from my perspective, I would argue they don't. I would argue that they do. Okay. And well, first of all, the reason that the reason that Bitcoin is referred to as digital gold is that if you look at the properties of money, gold and Bitcoin have very similar properties except Bitcoin excels in many categories. Like for example, if we're talking about divisibility, Bitcoin is more divisible because you can divide one Bitcoin 100 million times into the smallest unit, which is called a Satoshi. Or Sat. And if you want to, if you actually have physical gold to divide it into super small units, it's just not practical because you basically have to shave off the goal, which is what everyone says, but like that's not that's not something you're going to want to do. And portability, it's way more portable because I can send a billion dollars across the globe via the Bitcoin network and it reaches final settlement in less than an hour and I could pay less than $10 and transaction fees. And that is far superior to gold because if I had a billion dollars worth of gold. First of all, I need to load it up onto some armored trucks and pay security guards to guard it. I have to get it to the airport and I have to fly it across the globe. And obviously that's super expensive. And cost aside, it just takes a really long time to get that across the globe. So in terms of portability, Bitcoin is far superior. And in terms of scarcity, gold has a very low inflation rate. I think it's like 2% a year. If I'm not mistaken. And that's very close to what Bitcoin is right now. But the difference is if gold's price surges, then gold miners can come online and increase or search for gold and discover more gold and bring it into supply. Faster and that would basically dampen that increase in price because new supply will come on the market faster than it was before given the higher price. So as price increases, it's more profitable to mine it. So they mine it more supply comes along online faster and that helps bring the price back down. With Bitcoin, you don't have any of that mechanic because no matter what, on average, every 10 minutes, the same amount of Bitcoin comes into the market. So right now it's 6 and a quarter Bitcoin on average every 10 minutes. And if Bitcoin's price doubles, then the difficulty adjustment kicks in, which basically makes it harder to find new blocks of transactions. And that increase in difficulty keeps it so that even though the price doubled, the supply can't increase faster and therefore bring the price back down. But the same is true on the other side, whereas like if gold's price collapses, then gold miners can shut down. And therefore we have less supply coming online becomes more scarce. And therefore that helps bring the price back up. So it's it basically dampens the volatility. Whereas Bitcoin, there are there's no assistance if it drops. So if Bitcoin's price goes down 50% then basically the difficulty is going to drop and it's going to keep the new issuance of Bitcoin right around 10 minutes on average over the long term. Right. And the side as I described if Bitcoin's price doubles, then more miners are going to fire up and it'll be faster momentarily, but it'll be less than two weeks or whatever because basically every like 2000 blocks or approximately every two weeks. There is a difficulty adjustment, which basically gauges how fast new blocks are being added to the ledger. And if it's faster than 10 minutes, then the difficulty increases. And if it's slower than 10 minutes, that means it's too hard. So they decrease the difficulty. So there's Bitcoin has so called like perfectly in elastic supply or almost perfectly in elastic, which basically just grabs it. Have laid out, which is that doesn't matter if the price increases or decreases supply issuance is the same. So yeah, that was that was a really long tangent, but I think when you look at gold versus Bitcoin, Bitcoin is better on many of the properties of money compared to gold. And I think that's probably why we're seeing gold suffer this year and Bitcoin is taking off because the future is digital right everything's moving digital. Right. And so now that we have this idea of digital scarcity or digital real estate, why would somebody want to have a gold bar in their house, as opposed to just information where you can take around the world with you and you can access your Bitcoin. You can send it anywhere in the world. You can verify it very easily. And yeah, it's fine at least scarce too. So yeah, I'm only going to be 21 million Bitcoins as opposed to you know, who knows how much gold we can dig out of the ground. So yeah, and I agree with a lot of those points. I think the especially when it comes to just the practicality, I think that's one of the conversations that we see around Bitcoin already right like is it a commodity is it a currency and a lot of folks struggle with that for a lot of those reasons that you just laid out right fully. So I think the perspective I have on gold probably differs in the purpose of it because for me. A lot of folks that I think that that purchase gold, they're probably not trying to, you know, get a thousand bricks of gold and then go make a purchase with it. I don't think that's really what most folks most folks with gold are trying to do. It seems like more of a place where people want to park their cash with lower volatility. And that's really where I see the big divergence between Bitcoin and gold is really derived more from the purpose that it serves in a person's portfolio as compared to anything because to me, I look at something, you know, like Bitcoin, which has what is it the monthly one standard deviation on it right now is like 11,000 plus or minus. So, yes, it's a very high it's a high volatility asset over time will it will become less volatile though and I know that very young it's a very young asset and it's like if you look at any high growth company right after their IPO, the volatility is insane. But then if you fast forward 10 years, the volatility is at a much more normal level, it could still be high in the case of something like Tesla, but the volatility is to the upside, you know, you can't you can't go from zero to a trillion dollar market cap with low volatility agreed. And so if if If your main goal is capital preservation and you're not interested in growth, you just kind of want to preserve your purchasing power, then you want something with low volatility and historically that could be something like US treasuries, but it's different historically because You would actually get a positive real return on that, which means the yield on the bond is higher than inflation, but right now I don't know what the 30 year treasury yield is but it's somewhere around one and a half percent if I'm not mistaken, one, one. 28% or something like that. And if you have inflation or like the CPI inflation, if you're going off that number and the yield on a 30 year treasury is less than 2% then your your losing the number is going to get back to the level of $10,000. You're you're losing more than 3% and purchasing power every year and that's if you're going off of that CPI number. But another thing about inflation too, I mentioned earlier, is like everyone has a different form of inflation. Michael sailor says this a lot in his podcast. He's he basically says like if if you're buying the S&P 500 and that's what you're trying to acquire and the S&P is up 23% this year, then your inflation rates 23% right because if you're holding cash and you just missed out on that 23% increase. Well, now you can buy far less of S&P 500 stock than you could before. And so the inflation rate isn't just it's not just based on the basket of goods that the government publishes. It's whatever you are trying to acquire. So if you're trying to buy real estate and real estate is going up at 15% a year, whatever the number is over the past 12 to 18 months. Then if you haven't yet acquired a house, then now it's gotten a lot more expensive to do that because house prices has gone up over 10% 15% right. Yeah, I agree with you and I think that your overall perspective anyways on like Bitcoin versus gold in general. Pretty much aligned with it, especially like the longer term prospect because for me, I think more as Bitcoin becomes more stable less volatile. It will serve a lot more of that capital preservation purpose. I think right now a lot of people are more interested in it for the growth rightfully so like you said, it is very much like a startup. It is also a form of capital preservation. I mean capital preservation, the name of the game is to not it's to grow more than inflation. Because if you're not growing more than inflation, then you're losing purchasing power. But like we we've discussed. If you're sitting in cash and CPI is 5% a year, then you're losing 5% purchasing power a year. If it goes higher than that. And there are countries around the world where they have double or triple digit inflation. If you're in cash, you you're getting annihilated right now. And there are there's over a billion people in the world that are living under double or triple digit inflation. And that's those are the people that are trying to acquire Bitcoin too. Like the countries that have the highest adoption rate for Bitcoin or the countries that have the most unstable currencies. The highest. Because their Bitcoin doesn't discriminate. It's an off ramp for anybody who needs to use it. And so if you're in a different country and you can access the internet, then you can access Bitcoin. Whereas maybe you couldn't get US dollars or something like that because there's capital restrictions or maybe you can't even open a bank account. And so if you can access the internet and those things are true, then you can access Bitcoin, which is like if you're living under 10% inflation, then owning Bitcoin and seeing it go down 50% in a few months is better than losing 100% on an annual basis. Yeah, I think if you're 100% I think if you're staying in the currency, yeah, I think that argument would hold true. The only the only counter I would offer you is, you know, if in your inflation example, if you hold gold or cash and at the end of the year you lose 5% with Bitcoin, there's a chance at the end of the year, it could be down. And you know, then you're down 30% plus the five or whatever. Right. So I think a lot of it comes from like your firm belief in the appreciation of Bitcoin, which I mean, I personally think is well founded. I also am generally bullish long term of Bitcoin. But I do think long term it's a long term game. Yeah, and I think it's just an important caveat to point out because a lot of the viewers, at least on my channel, some of them are 60, some of them are 70, you know what I mean? And yeah, I do think that's have a different. This is the most difficult thing about like when you when you think about the whole landscape of where you can put your money. Historically, if you had a normal environment, let's say you had a 30 year treasury at a 5% yield and inflation is 2% or 1.5% or whatever it is. Then if you're 60 years old, you can put your money in US treasuries and that's a very, you know, it's a very reasonable place. Especially if you like you've seen interest rates fall over the past few decades. And that's bullish for bonds because if you buy a bond at 5% and then the yield drops to 4%, you have a capital gain on your bond position. So you're you're earning the yield. You're earning the coupon rate, but you're also seeing your bond position appreciate. Right. But now you don't have like there's nowhere for someone to put their money that's really low risk because like I said, if you have all of your wealth and cash. It's a melting ice cube as Michael sailor would put it and in the scenario where inflation gets out of hand and cash position can be completely obliterated. Yeah, I think our 0% is basically cash and then US Treasury at 1.5% is better than earning 0% in a savings account. But at the end of the day, it's still a fiat currency based contract, meaning your coupon payments are in the fiat currency. And ultimately when the bond matures, you get your currency back. And so if the fiat currency is unstable, then ultimately the bond position is unstable because of your cash flows are coming from that currency. Do you know right now like there's you can't. You can invest in the lower risk asset classes or the traditionally lower risk asset classes because capital. Yeah, you're losing purchasing power in cash savings and bonds. Right. And so if you if you want any chance at earning a higher percentage than inflation, you have to go to something that's higher risk. Like the stock market, you know, I think that's what we're seeing. Yep. Because people understand exactly what we're talking about right now. Yeah. Yeah. There's really nowhere. I which is the it's very unfortunate for people who are older and have a conservative wealth preservation mindset. You mentioned a couple times double digit inflation. Do you think that's potentially in the cards for us? I don't know. I don't want to speculate on that. Fair enough. For me, I honestly think that it completely random guess, but I would guess maybe up to eight or nine percent. But after that, I couldn't imagine. I couldn't imagine the Fed doing too much of standing still after that. But I mean, again, who the hell knows. Yeah. Yeah. You have people like Kathy Wood of our convest. She has said recently that in 2008, when they start their printing money, she thought there's going to be hyperinflation. But the velocity of money was low and velocity of money is how quickly it's changing hands. Right. So if you have an inflow of them, if you basically have all this helicopter money. And the velocity of money is picking up. That means there's just a lot more trading activity than that's a scenario for higher inflation if I'm understanding it correctly. But what she was saying is that we did see an increase in the money supply in 2008, but the velocity of money was slowing. And so there wasn't that hyperinflationary event. And so she has stated that there's a very similar thing going on right now, which is that there's a big increase in the money supply. But the velocity of money is is slowing. I haven't personally looked at that stat recently. So I don't know if it's actually what the trajectory looks like, but that's what she said in a tweet the other day. So that's understanding that correctly. That's kind of her line of thinking. But I have no idea. What inflation is going to do. But like just the mere worry of high inflation is enough to make people move their money around. And that's, I think that's what we're seeing in the higher risk assets like the stock market is ripping real estate's ripping. Bitcoin's ripping. It's it's yeah, it's there's nowhere to put your money on the lower risk side of things, which is right fortunate as I've said. Yeah, yeah, I agree. I really agree with the overall sentiment. And it does create a very fascinating environment. Because of I don't know, even the the COVID recovery surprised me in a lot of ways, but just in terms of the influx of money and when it came in to the to the stock market. But I think that even right now I've been watching the volume in the eminies. And you know, just order flow in there. And that is also an interesting benchmark. I think for you know how many people are keeping more money in the in the markets of of a similar note slightly different though. Something that some of the viewers were kind of curious about is just do you think or do you think do you foresee any sort of like significant impact on the rest of the earnings cycle given the current inflation environment. I know for my perspective. The reason why I think that's just an interesting discussion is a lot of the the folks that we see reporting earnings war pull Partter gamble stuff like that they've been talking about essentially reason costs and it's like some of the folks they're talking about. I know like craft hines that they were talking about in order to get their their stuff around the world. It's almost like a 3x increase in price and they're talking about passing on on the customer. Those kinds of things. Do you think that that's like starting to get baked into the earnings cycle that that essentially inflation is like truly starting to have an impact on a lot of companies as they go through the end of the year. Honestly, I'm not sure I haven't I haven't been following this earnings cycle very closely. I've basically been watching Bitcoin and watching my positions that I have which are all the big ones are Bitcoin related more fun to watch. But yeah, that makes sense of if you have a rising cost of your inputs as a business. Then you basically you have to you have to pass that on to your customers otherwise your margins get annihilated right. Yeah. And we're kind of there are people who post on Twitter too where they'll go and buy. They call it shrink flation where they'll go and buy paper towels or something like that and then they'll go back and buy it a couple months later. And basically they'll be paying the same amount but there will be like a lower number of sheets in the paper towel or something. Oh, that's funny. I'm heard of that. They're instead of increasing the price for the same quantity. They're keeping the price the same and decreasing the amount of material that you get. You're expecting like 160 sheets and you're like now you get 158. Yeah, exactly. So yeah, if you're as a business, if your inputs the cost of your inputs are going up, you have to pass that off to the customer if you want to keep your margins the same. I think for me what I've found interesting in it so far is just how pervasive and how topical it is for a lot of different companies that I always find interesting to see if like there's one industry that's getting hammered really hard for whatever reason, but this seems pretty widespread at this point. I saw him on tweet the other day too. He was saying that they're seeing considerable increase in the cost of their goods. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it makes it makes a good sense. So we have been talking a little bit about Bitcoin and whatnot and as I'm sure you know there's a new kid on the block bit O. I recently did a video on it essentially just walking through the construction of it just suitability for holding slash trading those kinds of things. But I would love to get you know just your initial thoughts on bit O and its utility. Primarily I would argue primarily as a trader I think just like most commodity based ETFs they have a certain amount of drag that they're going to suffer and that just kind of is what it is so it makes long term holding a little more difficult but all that aside curious what your general thoughts are on bit O. Yeah I think as a trading vehicle I think it works. Thank you if you're trying if you're in your brokerage account and you have a stock and options trading portfolio and you don't want to go open up an account at a crypto exchange to trade elsewhere and have two separate accounts and you want to keep it all under one roof then using something like the ITO and using it as a trading vehicle I think is is fine. I am strongly opposed to owning it or buying in and owning it long term because you're not investing in the actual asset and this isn't just bitcoin this is any futures based ETF. You're investing in the changes in the futures contracts and depending on if they are at a premium or discount to the actual asset itself then that will change the expected returns for that asset. Right. Like for example in the case of BITO if bitcoin is at 60,000 the actual price of bitcoin and then you're looking at the December or the November futures contract in bitcoin and that's trading at 65,000 did I say 60,000 bitcoin. 60, yeah. If the November futures at 65,000 and bitcoin remains right at 60,000 through the November futures settlement date that November futures is going to slowly decay from 65,000 to 60,000. But I like to say as a futures contract with no future is equal to the asset. Right. Yeah. I feel like you have a futures contract with zero days to settlement or like one minute to settlement then the futures price is going to be essentially. Whatever the asset price is right but when you go further out in time it you know it depends on whatever asset we're talking about like if you're talking about oil. The futures contract it kind of bakes in the storage costs and stuff like that for oil so if you buy physical oil you have to put it somewhere. See the paper storage and so that's embedded in the futures pricing but for something like bitcoin I have noticed that. I haven't been watching the futures relative to bitcoin's price very closely but I have noticed that it is the futures are trading at a slight premium. So if you get a period of time where you're invested in a futures based ETF and the actual asset price is not increasing. Then you are investing in an ETF that's holding the futures contracts that are decreasing. Right. The asset prices remaining the same you're investing in this future here if the asset price remains the same you get this negative return in the future and then once this future settles they have to roll those funds into the next month which is could be here again and then if you get another flat period. So basically you're just perpetually holding the decaying futures and if you look at the XX that's exactly why the XX has this very predictable decay over time. Because the VIX index trades in a very predictable range like it's basically between like 15 and 30 95% of the time. Right. But when it's less than let's just say 20 or 25 the VIX futures are trading at a premium to the VIX index and during normal market market conditions the VIX index is going to remain fairly steady and those futures contracts are going to decay lower towards the VIX index as they approach their settlement date. And the XX is tracking the percentage returns in the VIX futures contracts, not the returns in the VIX index. So that's another example. But it is different because there's no expectation that the VIX index is going to go from 15 to 150. Very, you know, over time over the next few years, whereas in Bitcoin there is that expectation for the Bitcoin bulls because it has that number go up technology which basically just means that there's more money flowing into the Bitcoin ecosystem. And since there's only 21 million coins, if you have more and more people, what AKA money trying to flow into a limited space arena then. You know, the cost of a seat is going to go up so this fee so the cost of it go up. And so if you have that increasing Bitcoin price over time, even though the futures contracts could be trading at a premium to Bitcoin itself, it's not going to be the same return as simply holding Bitcoin. So there will be that drag, but it wouldn't be that like nasty bleed that VIX X experiences because that's because the VIX index is typically trading between 15 and 20. And the VIX futures are always at a premium to the VIX index in that scenario where go three, six, nine months where the VIX index is relatively neutral. And basically that means that like market volatility. There's not really many severe drawdowns market volatility is fairly normal. So to speak, then you're going to have that constant bleed and VIX X. So there are differences. You can't like comparing VIX X to the ITO is not the same, but overall, if you're investing in the ITO, just know that it's probably more of a trading vehicle and it's not suitable for long term holds. It's a, and I mean, I think the way that you explain like tracking error and things like that is it really really helpful lose today. It's the point quite a bit. Because I, I talked quite a bit about just the idea of Bitcoin in general, like something that I think some folks may not even understand is like tons of people trade Bitcoin itself, but you don't have to cough up the money for one entire Bitcoin. If you don't have the capital, right, you can trade partials of Bitcoin. So for me, what I think at least is if you're kind of a long term believer in Bitcoin and you want to trade Bitcoin itself as Bitcoin. Something like bit, oh, is a little tricky because it's for on surface level, people think, oh, great. You know, this how I can get exposure, but exactly like you said, it doesn't hold the product at all. And to me, there's no reason not to just go by Bitcoin if you're someone climbed to, you know, want to buy Bitcoin long term. Another big thing that I want to say is even if we had a real Bitcoin ETF, I would still oppose buying that unless you're only, unless your only goal is to isolate the investment aspect of Bitcoin. Because if you own, if you own a Bitcoin ETF, so you own 100 shares or whatever it is, you own shares of the Bitcoin ETF, like a real Bitcoin ETF. You can't use the Bitcoin payment network. You can't actually send that Bitcoin anywhere. And in a scenario where, you know, you wanted to like go to different countries, something, like take your Bitcoin with you. You can't use your Bitcoin ETF shares. Right. You're going to need the actual Bitcoin in that case. Another thing is if the tax treatment of Bitcoin were to change in the future, let's say you bought a Bitcoin ETF, you're comparing buying a Bitcoin ETF for $100,000 and actual Bitcoin for $100,000, not like per Bitcoin, but like just your investment. Sure. And both of those positions grow to 200,000 in a scenario where Bitcoin is recognized as currency. And you don't have to pay capital gains on any, any spending in Bitcoin. Then if you own the Bitcoin ETF, you would have to sell the shares to actually, you know, get any money out of that. Whereas in that scenario, I'm not saying this will happen. It's just something I'm thinking about in the scenario where you have the gain, but then it starts to be recognized as currency. Then you would have that gain, but you wouldn't have to pay capital gains when you spend it. Right. And I actually can have this taken. There might be some like one time taxation if they did do something like that. But that's just in my mind, when you're investing in an ETF, you're isolating the investment case. And another example, you know, we've been talking about gold. If you buy GLD, you're just isolating the investment aspect of investing in gold. But you can, like, you don't actually have the gold, you can't use it. Right. So I think that's a good thing. Like if you want to, if you see a future where you actually want to use the asset. And I think in Bitcoin's case, there's a higher probability you'd want to use it as payment compared to something like a gold bar. Right. And in that case, owning the ETF is not going to help you there. So I think that's a really good. It's the purpose because the purpose of Bitcoin is to remove all third parties from monetary value. Right. So if you're invested in a Bitcoin ETF, you own shares that are, you know, in your investment portfolio, that's how that essential party. So the only thing I would offer to the, to the other side of the discussion, because I totally agree with the ability to like use the currency. I think for me, when I look at things like Bitcoin futures or like a actual like Bitcoin ETF, is I do think that there's an opportunity to leverage the leverage that the marketplace offers you. And I think that there is something to that side of the discussion for kind of commonly trading the product. But yeah, in general, I agree with you that there's a certain utility that comes with being able to buy. Generally, in appreciating currency or whatever we're going to call it, you know, that you can then just use that currency to go. Make a purchase, go buy Tesla with it or something like that. Like I do think there's a lot of value in that. Yeah, I do think there's, there's going to be a lot of value when we get a real ETF. And it might be a GBTC because GBTC right now is a trust and they're filing to convert to an ETF. But from the conversations that I've heard that might not take, that might not actually go through for a year based on like the early assessments that I've heard from people who are much closer to the matter. But once we have a Bitcoin ETF, I suspect that it's going to be highly liquid, very actively traded. It'll have great option markets. And I think that'll be really good for people who are who are interested in making options trades. Like right now, one of my biggest positions that I talk about a lot is in micro strategy. Yep. Because they own like 120,000 Bitcoin. And it's basically a Bitcoin holding company. And so the stock price tracks very closely with Bitcoin movement. So if I buy call options and micro strategy, I'm doing that because it's a Bitcoin play not necessarily a micro strategy business play. But that has added, that has added risks because, you know, what if they sell their Bitcoin, you know, then, then my play goes out the window. Right. No longer going to track Bitcoin. And I would much rather have that trade on in a Bitcoin ETF, but we don't have one yet. So is there a reason why you would play something like micro strategy compared to like Bitcoin futures directly? Yeah. I think it kind of gets back to what we talked about earlier. And my options trades in micro strategy are long term. So they're a year of expiration. Got it. And if I did that same thing in the ITO, I don't even know if they have options yet. Do they? They do. Yeah, they, it's actually funny. Their, their options got cleared like pretty quick. Yeah, they're, they're pretty liquid too. Yeah. Yeah, that would. I could do it in BITO, but like we talked about, if we get a six month period where Bitcoin isn't really moving. Right. Then BITO is going to decay. And my strike price remains fixed. And so the problem with that is if I have a fixed call strike price and BITO is decaying because of the futures, then I need a bigger movement to get back to where it was before. And we've been bigger movement before my call option is in the money. So that's why that's why I was curious about the futures themselves, like something like the G22s that are 120 days out. What's the, what's the appeal for, you know, like, was a micro strategy versus the further dated future. And if I'm understanding correctly, responses just because it's the longer term play and you don't want to have that tracking error. Yeah. And also when you, when you're talking about futures contracts, longer term futures contracts are less sensitive to changes in the asset price. Compared to a shorter term futures contract. Or the shortest term futures contract, like I said earlier, a futures contract with no future is equal to the asset. Like the VIX index, when you look at how the VIX index moves relative to the VIX futures, if the VIX index goes from 17 to 30, the second most volatile asset that tracks the VIX is going to be the nearest term VIX future. So let's just say the VIX future with a, with 20 days to settlement is going to increase more than a VIX future with 100 days to settlement. That's the case of the, the VIX index and VIX futures structure. I'm not sure how it would be in Bitcoin, but I suspect if you had, if you had a really big blowoff top in Bitcoin, then the longer term futures might be trading at a discount to Bitcoin. Got it. But overall, they would move like the longer term future would move less than a shorter term future. Right. So that's kind of the problem with one of the mistakes that new options traders make is that they look at the VIX options. And they, if you're in a low volatility environment and the market seems like it's richly valued in your anticipating a market sell-off, instead of going to the 30-day VIX options, they'll go to like the 180-day VIX options. Right. But what you're doing when you do that is you're not trading the 30-day VIX futures, you're trading options that are tracking the 180-day and even if the VIX goes from 17 to 30, that 180-day VIX future might go up like a couple points. Right. It's not going to go up nearly as much as that 30-day VIX future. And since the VIX options are tracking those respective futures contracts, you're going to have a much more explosive movement in that shorter term VIX expiration cycle. Right. Yeah, yeah. I think that's a great point. And it's as opposed to just trading a 700-day call option in micro strategy, the stock price is going to track the actual changes in Bitcoin's price. It's not tracking the 700-day futures contract, which is less volatile than the actual asset. Right. That's a really, really good point. I think that that's something that I hadn't really considered myself is just the way that the product is going to move. I need to, like, I speak very confidently about that structure in like VIX-versive futures, but I need to pay attention to Bitcoin and Bitcoin futures. Right. I have only checked the prices occasionally, but I'm fairly confident that that same thing holds true in the Bitcoin futures markets. Like the longer term. I agree. It'll be volatile then the shorter term. So like the most volatile thing is going to be the actual asset itself, and then the longer term futures are typically way less volatile. Right. And the less time you have, the closer you get to the actual asset itself, the more volatile those futures contracts. Yep. Yeah, I think, yeah. Because I mean, I've been trading the Bitcoin futures quite a bit myself, and I think that that's completely accurate. So this leads us to kind of two different ways we can go at the conversation, but I think you were just talking a little bit about some of your positions in micro-strategy, what you've been in kind of playing. I feel like that, like, everything is Bitcoin related. I just feel, I know some people in my audience get annoyed at the whole Bitcoin thing, but it's like, that's where it's at right now in my mind. And so that's like, I feel annoying sometimes, just constantly talking about it. Almost every topic that we've talked about this far in this conversation has involved a Bitcoin in one way or another. But I think that's fair, because the conversations that we've been talking about, you know, intimately tied to it. So I think we can offer them an olive branch. And I think for your folks, the good conversation would be, what are some of your favorite strategies so far this year? So I think that even if it's tied to Bitcoin that you've enjoyed trading, I still think you can, you know, discuss a little bit the strategy, and then maybe they'll be a little more chill. Yeah, let's hope. Yeah, I've been using this strategy. My go to strategy is still, and I've used this, not just in micro-strategy, but also in, I've got one in square. You're that everybody? I did it in Tesla a bunch. I've got it in video. I've been using this strategy. Basically, since the pandemic started, and since I stopped shorting the market, which was in May or June of last year, basically, the play is to buy call options, long-dated call options. So like over a year to expiration, because I'm not confident enough in my directional place to make like a two-day, like a seven-day option play, I think the shorter term you go, especially when you get into less than a week, it's very, very close to a slot machine. So funny note on that. That's what our patrons are. Funny note on that is, I'm actually working on a study right now with my audience on price prediction, and we're tying in some like white papers we've read or out, price prediction, and accuracy over time. So I think it's just interesting you mentioned that, because that is like one of the most pervasive hypothesis in pretty much all of the studies. Is that you shorten the time frame? People are way less accurate. So I just really get point. It's like, well, throw back to binary options. I don't know if you remember buying. Yeah, buddy. I'm sure they still exist, but it's a dark corner of the object. It's like, do you think SPY is going to be above or below 250 in the next 90 seconds? It's just flip across. Yeah, it's nuts. Yeah, the short, I mean, you can make a lot of money. Like, when you see those, I hate to call them out, but if you see the Wall Street Bet Straders that make millions and millions of dollars from a few thousand dollars, they do that by buying a ton of short dated options. Right. Because when you go shorter term with options, the option contracts are cheaper, because the expected stock price movement over a shorter duration is much smaller, and therefore the options are much cheaper. And there's also less time value in the options. Yeah, you can afford a ton more contracts. Right. And so when you do that, if you write about a big movement in your favor, you'll have way more leverage by owning a thousand call options as opposed to going like 100 days out and owning 10 contracts for the same price. Yeah, I think for a day or a month, you only have seven days to be right, and then you lose 100 percent, whereas I prefer to go further out. And it takes a lot longer to lose all of my money in that aggressively bullish play. Right. So anyway, that's my strategy as I buy long dated call options, typically deep out of the money, depending on which product it was, but I did it successfully in Tesla, in video, basically tech stocks and micro strategy. And then once I initiate the long calls, once the stock price increases, hopefully it does, like if you're right and it increases substantially, then basically you'll have higher strike call options that'll be trading at or more than the premium you paid for the initial call option. So like for example, if you the stock price is 500 and you buy the 750 call option for $10, and then the stock price goes from 500 to 600, now your 750 call options going to be worth like 20 or $30. I don't know what it is, I'm just spit buying. But that means there is a higher strike contract that will be worth $10. So maybe that's the 800 call option. And so if you buy the 750 call for $10, stock price shoots higher, and now the 800 call is worth $10, you can short the 800 call and create a risk-free spread. And so that's my strategy that I've been doing for the past year or so now. So it starts pretty much a pretty directional play. Yeah, it starts very directional. You have to take a big risk initially to get a risk-free trade. Like to make a risk-free trade, you have to take risk first, you have to expose yourself to that lost potential, and then you have to be right about the direction. And then once you have a profitable long naked option, then you can kind of trade around it. And I like that strategy because in my example, let's say the stock price shot up, and now I have this 750, 800 call spread for free. If the stock price goes back down, then I'll have a profit on my short call, because if I sold it for $10 at the top, and then the stock price trades lower, then maybe now it's trading for $5. I can buy it back for $5, keep that $500 profit, and then if the stock price continues another leg higher, then I'm in a position where I can either resell that one or re-call it a higher strike. And that's just, it gives you a lot of flexibility, but the prerequisite for that strategy to work is that you have to be right about a big movement in the stock price. And you and I have talked about this a little bit, but you also have to be resolute enough to wait until you're right that much. Which I always think for a lot of people, because a lot of the, I like to call them the cool aid folks, but your people over at Tasty Trade, a lot of things that they talk about is just managing, managing winners, right? So taking winning trades down, but I think for something like that, it's counterintuitive to be disciplined enough to let go of. You got to have the diamond hands that is being hard, because there's a balance between, there's a balance between being too greedy and waiting too long and then never taking that risk off the table. You kind of have to have, I like to have like general stock price levels like, oh, if the stock price gets to this price, then I'm going to start looking at adjustments here. But the main thing for me, the most important thing with that strategy, like if you're going to take the risk, let's say you put 10 grand into and out of the money option that has two years to go and the stock rips higher. Yeah. You don't want to block your profits too soon. What I mean by that, if you buy the, let's just say another random example, let's say you buy like the thousand straight call for 10 grand. And then the stock price shoots higher like a couple days later. And then you short the 10 50 call for 10 grand. Now you have a $50 wide call spread with two years to expiration. Basically that 50 wide 50 dollar wide call spread with two years to expiration is basically going to be like a brick. Like it's not going to move very much. Right. It's not price goes up a lot or goes down a lot. The profit change on that spread is not going to be that significant because it has two years to go. And those strikes are so close together that it's almost like it's almost like having no position. Right. Yeah. One way to think of if you have a vertical spread like the wider the spread gets, the closer it is to a long option. Right. That's why for like really long term bullish plays, I like really wide call spreads. Like right now, in Tesla, I have the 900 1500 call spread. Which at this point is actually looking really good. I've had that on for for quite a while now. Yeah. I've had it on. I bought the 900 call 400 days ago for 10 grand and now it's trading for 30. Right. But then 238 days ago, I so I shorted the 1500 call for 12 grand. So I basically created the risk free 900 1500 call spread. And now it's looking really good because Tesla is above the 900 strike call. Right. So now I still have 450 days on that trade. And so I can continue to wait. And who knows in 450 days, maybe Tesla will be above 1500. That's a good amount of time. But the key there is that I waited 180 days between the long call entry and the short call entry. Not that the time frame necessarily matters, but I was able to wait long enough to where I could create a really wide spread because the stock price went parabolic. And then I took that opportunity to to short that 1500 call, which obviously even after Tesla's meteoric rise recently, it's still $500 out of the money. But since the stock price went vertical, so quickly, what happens is when that happens, the call options just explode because everybody rushes in to buy more call options. So not only are you making money on the stock price increasing via the delta, but everyone is trying to join in on that momentum trade and all that money is just piling into those calls. And so the implied volatility also explodes. And so that's why when you have, like typically if you're looking at the S&P 500 implied volatility or the VIX will increase as the S&P 500 goes down. But for some of these high growth stocks, the opposite happens where if they start to take off, then the implied volatility actually explodes when the stock price is increasing. So if you own call options in that environment, you're killing it because you're making stock price increase and also everyone flooding into the options and inflating their prices even more. And that makes it that's like a really good example and scenario for when you'd want to take that opportunity and short a call against your long call to create that risk-free spread, especially if you can get like a really wide spread. I think the other thing that I like to do because I kind of have a very specific leap diagonal strategy that I like to run normally it's on the call side. But one of my favorite things to do there anyways is to trade it at a ratio. So if you have 10 longs, whenever you have that chance for that risk-free spread, you can kind of calculate how much capital you need to take in to pay off that trade. So instead of maybe selling 10 calls against it, you sell eight. And you recoup most of the cost and yet you still don't cap your up, you know that kind of thing. But because it yeah, it seems the way that you and I enter that trade is actually pretty similar because when I'm going with the call-leap diagonal, I normally will establish the long position partial. So I always get ready to kind of add to it over time. I budget some capital to do that. But if I offer any sort of short call against the long call, it's always at a very small ratio to exactly to your point, give the trade time to work, right? That's the whole point of getting a leap is to put some time in the trade. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's what my favorite strategy has been going well. But I think one thing I really want to say that's important is that I have no confidence that I'll be able to do this forever because the stock prices and the stock market overall, they can't go up forever, right? Right. So that's why it was fortunate timing because last year when the stock market collapsed and then it started to bounce off at the lows, I started to get short and I was betting against further increases in the market because I thought we were just going to have a little bounce and then we were going to continue to plunge lower. So I was like buying all these, I was buying like 100 strike puts and spy when spy was at like 200 or whatever. And the market kept going up and I kept adding to my short position. And then eventually I was like, wait a second, I started paying more attention to monetary policy and the market response is to what the Fed was doing. And I flipped, which was a really hard decision because it's hard to lose money, start bleeding money being short and then flip long. But ultimately, I just came to the conclusion that the market is going to listen and basically trust the monetary policy and that was my basis for flipping. I feel like then that the market's been up so much over the past 12 plus months that like I would not, I would be careful to to enter the trades that I'm talking about at these current levels. Yeah, but I think that that's like pretty impressive on the flip because I feel like that's such a double edged sword, right? I mean, that's why it's as scary as because like I live, then the market's going to crash. Yeah, because I mean, it shows your ability to, because I do think that there's something to be said to look at a losing position objectively and make a decision about how to essentially approach it. And I think that there's a lot of value in that. But yeah, it seems like normally for me in those scenarios, I kind of just bail on that overall idea and I move on to something else. But I mean, with something as big as the broad market, I could totally get that. That's awesome that that worked out. That's a tough move to make. Yeah, at this point, I would rather like I've seen so many people lose tons of money betting against things. And at this point, I would rather have no position in something than short it. It's funny because especially like an uncapped upside short like shorting futures where you keep losing money as it continues to go up. If I'm going to short something, I'm going to buy puts because then if I'm wrong, I only lose the premium I paid for the puts. And as the as the asset continues to increase, I lose less and less because my put options are basically just losing all their value, becoming close to worthless. And then I at a certain point, I stopped losing money versus like a static stock short or a futures short where like as it continues to go up, you lose the same amount every dollar it goes. That's actually the beauty I think of options is that if you're going to short something, I would much prefer to use put options. But of course, they're outposing cons because if you buy put options, you're putting a time limit on it. And if it goes sideways, then you're going to lose money on the puts versus if you short something and it goes sideways, you're not going to make your things much money. So I mean, there's obviously tradeoffs, but I would rather not have uncapped upside risk for an asset continuing to increase against me if I'm shorting it. Yeah. And for that, I would much rather use a long put to. I totally agree with that because the other thing is just the the cost to carry. If you short stock outright a lot of place will, you know, you have some sort of daily interest that yeah, then you have it. Yeah. So yeah, to me that it generally is a no brainer to typically use derivatives for those sorts of things. So moving on to the next topic, I think that this is one that your audience was interested in discussing, which is kind of the idea of growing a small trading account. So for me, I've actually I did a study on my YouTube channel called Small Stacks where I literally did exactly that. I partitioned off a $5,000 account. And I just traded it essentially how I would if I was starting with that now. And one of the common themes throughout that conversation is realistically speaking, if I were to like truly have $5,000 and want to to grow that, the first thing I said in all the Small Stacks videos was, I wouldn't trade it. I would simply just put it in some sort of interest bearing account, even if it's a CD earning something, trying to combat inflation like we were talking about earlier and then paper trading in the meantime, because while I was going through that study, one of the things I kept saying every time I took a trade is like, well, I don't have enough money to afford this. And I don't want to be too directional because of, you know, X, Y or Z. And long story short, every single time I was putting on a trade, it was a series of compromises, no matter what. Now I buy this one product. I like to do cash-secured puts, which is really difficult, you know, with a small account. And really the purpose of trading that way in a small account is if you're directionally wrong and you're trading a cash-secure put on something that you like, where's the case scenario, you end up just owning it and carrying it going forward. But the downside in a small account is that could be one product and then you're fucking, you're tapped out. So there's a ton of trade-offs that go with trading a small account. So for me, my general position is if you have really a small account, I would consider that pretty much anything less than $10,000, $15,000 is like really small, in my opinion, just to like actively trade. I would either not trade and save or just start buying an index ETF, you know, VLO, spy, just something like that if you're so inclined. And, you know, paper trade while you go to learn, but curious what your approach would be. Yeah, I agree. I think the smaller the account you have, the less flexibility you have, and it's like way less flexibility. Like if you have $2,000, that's the bare minimum to open a margin account. And if you put, you basically are limited to low-price stocks because you need to be trading strategies that have low loss potential or small loss potential. But if you're, you know, if you're lost potential on a trade is $200, that's not a large, but it's like a, it's a very small max loss for an option position to have. And even at $200, that's 10% of your account. And if you're talking about a 30 to 60 day play, we're talking about losing 10% of your account in a month or two months if it goes against you. I remember. And so, yeah, like if you just held $2,000 and you deposit $100 a month, if you can, then that's a risk-free 5% growth. You know, it's going to be very hard to grow your trading account at 5% per month, especially as a brand new trader. And so I agree with what you're saying is if you have a, give $2,000, it's going to be very difficult. My kind of ballpark numbers that things start to, you get a lot more flexibility when you get closer to like 10 grand. But then as you say, like you can't trade actively until you have 25 grand because you need, you have to get past the pattern day trader rules, which is if you have less than $25,000 and you're trading stocks or options, you can only do so many round trip trades. So like, enter an exiting position. You can only do so many of those in a rolling, I think it's five day period. And if you go over that, then basically your account gets puts a closing only like 60 to 90 days. And the other important note on that is it's not even like you don't hit the 25,000 threshold and then you're good. You have to stay above that. And I think a lot of people make that mistake where they think, oh, I'm good now I can start doing this and then they find themselves in a bad spot. Yeah. But overall, it's interesting because trading a $20,000 account, you could trade a very similarly to a $200,000 account. You're just your position scale up. You just have the same percentage of risk. But that is exactly what I talk about a lot actually. I don't want to make any suggestions, but I don't know if I was trading in a very small account. I would probably, I would probably favor longer term, like naked option purchases because I'm trying to get out of that small zone. But at the same time, like you can't, if you have $2,000, you can't buy a 700 day call option in Tesla because those are tens of thousands of dollars. So you're in the limit. Now, regardless, it basically have to like, you have to trade lower price stocks. One thing could be you could allocate a certain percentage of that to like two year leaps in spy. And so you could buy like the 500 or like 550 calls in spy with 900 days of expiration. I don't even know if those are trading for us, check. But that would be a way like if you're bullish on the stock market overall, then putting your money into a position like that, just to see January 2024. You could buy the 815 day call options at the 600 strike price for $600 a piece. And when you do that, one thing I would say is you're not necessarily saying that the stock market's going to go to 600. But basically between now and let's just say like a few months from now, if spy goes from 450 to 500 over the next, let's just say six to nine months, like you're going to make money on those call options. And it'll be a much larger percentage return than the percentage increase in spy. And I think that that's a lean towards something like that. But at the same time, I don't want to I don't want to recommend that people put a large chunk of their account into deep out of the money options. Yeah. And it's but it's funny, though, and I think that's why I like these conversations so much because like you could tell how our perspectives on that differ. And I I really like your utilization of leverage, though, right? Like that's what it comes down to you. Like you definitely have a more directional approach in that sense than I would. But the big difference there is you would benefit from leverage. And like I think there's something to be said, that's actually something my mentor always said, he was funny. Like he was an older dude. And even when I first started trading and working with him a lot around 10 years ago, he was always like 50,000. And I didn't have the patience for that because I was I was literally in high school when I first started. And I was just like, man, the fucking old guy doesn't know what he's talking about, fuck that. But then I started to realize like why he said that. But one of the things that he also said very frequently. And I think I've come to realize it more and more over time is just the the purpose and almost necessity of leverage to traders. If you want to try to outperform the stock market, I find it's very, very difficult to do that without the presence of leverage in some capacity. So otherwise, unless you're really good at picking direction, I'm not. I'm like, I would probably start a paid service if I put on a trade to tell everybody to take the opposite side, because there's a pretty good chance that as soon as I enter, it's going to go against me. Yeah. And that's that's a good point. So like people ask me one another common question I get is, how do you screen stocks? And I don't screen stocks. It's like all of my trade ideas, they're at this point in time, my trade ideas are usually tied to fundamentals, especially like if I'm doing a two-year option play, then that's because I think there's some fundamental reason for that movement to occur. So you have to have yet to have some sort of prediction and a prediction comes from doing whatever research, like whatever realm you're in. Like if you follow the automotive market and then maybe you have like a, you know, you have an auto-stocks idea or something like that, or if you follow the debt markets, maybe you have a bond trading idea. But it has to come from somewhere, but I think the only like the only reason I've had deep conviction in my micro strategy play, it's not like I just like picked micro strategy in a screener and just said like, oh, I'm going to love it. Right. It feels long options in this stock. It's because my conviction in Bitcoin has stemmed from the last 18 months of spending most of my days and a lot of my working hours, like thinking about it in some capacity and listening to podcasts constantly. Like my 90%, 80% of my podcast listening is all about Bitcoin. And so like that trade idea didn't come from just like looking at a stock. It came from a deep conviction in this Bitcoin idea. And that's why I have this position on in my portfolio. But like if you don't have a good idea, you don't necessarily have to try to force anything. And I wouldn't, if you don't have any good ideas, then just stick to you know, those static positions, whether that's you know, owning shares of stock or whatever it is. Yeah. I think there's something, I think there's something to that, especially because I think for a lot of folks, well, for for people who've been trading like you and I at least for a while now, you start to build a relationship with different products. And like you kind of, it's not just trying to guess direction based on a chart. And I think that a lot of folks who ask that style question, that's essentially what they're trying to do is just, you know, how can I pick something that's going to go up? And I think that you do technical analysis, you can be a technical analyst. I'm not a TA guy. Neither am I. I use it. I always say at least to my folks, I use technical analysis for context. Like just to help me understand the current environment for something, there's a lot of tools that I do find useful. But at no point in my under the illusion, by my observation of a chart that I can have any predictive capacity over where something will go in the future. Yeah. Just I think that's a very difficult argument to make. So I feel like I feel like I let my viewers down in that regard too, because I feel like they want me to have a more active outlook and they want me to have more ideas. But at this day, this day and age, like I see options as a tool. Like if I, if I have a specific scenario, where I think they're valuable to use and I'll use them, but if not, then I won't use them. And I'll just I think, but I think that that just goes to show again, like just a certain level of authenticity, because I feel like I literally feel the same exact thing. A lot of folks will say, well, what do you think about X, Y, or Z? And I might have an opinion on like the the company itself or whatever, but I could always tell that generally they're trying to see like, do you think it's going to go up or go down? And my answer is literally the same thing my mentor always told me, which is nobody knows, literally nobody knows. So I agree with you though, because I feel like a lot of folks, they enjoy that kind of content because it's it's almost like when a fighter predicts their fight, like there's just a certain amount of confidence that goes into that that people find, I think, alluring. But I do think it would be a bit disingenuous at least, because I mean, especially with the stock market and how fickle things are, it's very, very difficult. Like we were just talking about before the studies that I that I've been reviewing and I'm starting to do myself, it's just very difficult for people to predict direction. And we know that favorably. Some people convey it with a ton of conviction, even in the study that I'm doing now, I'll ask folks, you know, in the Google form, like how confident they are. And some folks literally go all the way up as high as I have on the confidence scale, like supremely confident. And it exists. Some people are very, very convicted. But you bring in another really good point, something that you brought up earlier in our discussion is just the utility of options and different ways that we can use them. And I think something that one of or some of your folks have expressed interest in the discussion on is just, you know, ways to hedge a portfolio with options. And I actually find that to be a really fun conversation because I think for me, I very rarely have a lot of long stock or just long equity positions that are outright that I would be wanting to hedge with with derivatives. So when I think about that question to me, it's like just a really interesting scenario to view from because the vast majority of my trading is derivatives. And the vast majority of my trading is generally realized short term. I do have some long term positions. Most of those are super speculative. And I personally not hedging them. You know what I mean? Like if they work, they work, if they don't, they don't. But curious to hear your thoughts on hedging a portfolio with options. Because to me, a ton of choices available, very, very doable. And there's a lot of ways to go about it. So the clear choices for me would be using a broad index as kind of the vehicle. So an example of a few, you're trying to hedge against the market to client, you go to spy and you buy the puts there. But then the discussion of like what expiration and what strike you buy, like there's an unlimited combo of things and all the pros and cons. The big thing is you want to buy insurance when you don't need it. Yep. And so like right now, the VIX is at 17, which means things aren't too expensive. But if you don't buy insurance now in the form of spy puts, and then let's say the market starts declining and now the VIX is at 25, if you are trying to buy spy puts when the VIX is at 25, you're going to pay way more premium than you would have if you would have hedged right now at the VIX at 17. So looking at analogy would be you don't want to buy fire insurance on your house when it's burning down because you're going to pay basically the total value for house for insurance because it's burning down as we speak. But if it's fine, everything's good, then you can buy a fire insurance policy and you're going to pay significantly less than the value of your home. Yeah. Hopefully nothing happens. But you buy it when you don't need it because that's when it's cheapest. So in terms of hedging, it gets really expensive if you're trying to add the hedge when things start to move against you, you have to put them in place before anything bad happens and accept them as a cost of doing it. Yeah. Second thing is like if you have a perpetual hedge, that's I don't think that's a good strategy because it's going to be expensive regardless. It's just going to eat into your returns. It's just driving. If you have if you need a perpetual hedge and you probably should just have lower position size overall. I think that that right there is exactly what my mentor always hit on was in general. Like for me, the only time I hedge like no shit is if I have a big futures position on that if it goes wrong, it literally will blow me up. And in those scenarios, I always have some sort of hedge on and just accept the cost. But that's exactly what you always said. The primary hedge is risk management. And what do you means by that is exactly what you just said, which is controlling how much risk you offer. Another thing I was going to say, oh, sorry. What was I going to say? Another thing, I don't know if this is next in line in my thoughts, but another thing is if you have a portfolio of let's say 10 positions and two of the positions take up like 70% of the size, like for example, in my portfolio, in the main one, micro strategy is $170,000. And the next biggest position is square at 50,000. Right. So I don't need if I'm trying to reduce risk in my portfolio, I don't need to go out and buy spy puts. I could just go to my biggest portfolio positions and put on protective positions in the biggest portfolio positions, because those are the ones that have the most risk. Also, if you have a profitable position, for example, like if you buy, if you buy shares of stock for $100 and it goes up to $150 over a certain period of time, now you have a big profit on that stock position. And if you have stock that you're trying to hedge and you have more than 100 shares, you can do what is called a collar, you can buy a put in short a call. And basically the short call premium in the long put premium can offset so that you don't have any cost of hedging. So for example, if the stock price is at $150 and you sell the $160 call and you buy the $140 put for a net creditor like a scratch. So basically the $160 call is trading for the same amount as the $140 put. You can basically put that protective position on for free, doesn't add any risk to your portfolio, it actually reduces it, but you don't have to pay for that protection. But what you get there is you'll limit your upside on the shares above 160 and you'll guarantee that you can sell them at 140. And so since you bought the shares for 100 and they're at 150 and then you put on that collar where the put strike is 140, you're basically guaranteeing that the worst case scenario is that you lock in a $40 profit in the shares. So that's what Mark Cuban did when he sold broadcast.com to Yahoo, he got paid in Yahoo shares and he had a lock up period. I think it was six months, but he hired Goldman if I'm not mistaken and they did a six month collar for him. So since he got paid like a billion dollars in Yahoo stock and he had to hold it for six months, he wanted to basically lock in that gain. He didn't want to risk seeing Yahoo stock plummet while he had to hold it and therefore like the value of his payout just gets decimated. So what he did is he did a collar through that holding period so that he had some more appreciation potential in the shares, but he also guaranteed a like a worst case sale price, but he didn't have to pay for that protection because he did a costless collar. So that's a really good use case and a really savvy scenario where you can use options to not speculate or gamble, but you can use it strategically to reuse. I think he ruined it for the rest of us though because a lot of places, if you're in a lock up, a lot of them now specify that you can't even trade derivatives on it, which is really. Yeah, so there's been a couple endeavors, one of which I was just doing some angel investing for a company and I received shares for it and like very specifically, they said that can trade the product for expiry of time, can trade derivatives in the product and they even went so far as to list a handful of very highly correlated products that you couldn't trade either. Like pretty in time. Next case, you have to find a friend with a bunch of money to say, yeah, yeah, put on the hedge for you. They have to buy the protection for you and someone else's name. It was like crazy, but I literally, I get a kick out of that Mark Cuban story because I literally think that because everybody realized that he found a great way to, yep. The other thing that I would just mention for hedging a portfolio, another thing that probably worth mentioning is a lot of times people like to use volatility products themselves. So a lot of people like to hedge with VIX, a lot of people like to hedge with VXX. And for me, I think there's a ton of potential issues with that, depending on the environment, but curious to hear your thoughts on that. Yeah, we kind of talked about earlier, but if you're looking at VIX options, long-term VIX options are a no-go because they are tracking, they're not all the VIX expirations are not tracking the same thing. Each respect VIX options expirations tracking that corresponding futures contract. And the shorter-term futures contracts are going to be more responsive to changes in the VIX. So if you're trading a, if you buy calls on like a 180-day VIX option cycle and the market collapses, those calls are not going to increase nearly as much as a 30-day call option at the same strike would. And I actually, my project option website, I actually made a graph of this exact scenario and I plotted the prices of call options through the 2008 collapse and the long-term call options. They didn't increase nearly as much as the shorter-term options. Oh, that's pretty cool. That's a problem there. And then with VXX, as we talked about earlier, it has that very consistent decay. And so let's say VXX is at 30 and you buy the 30-stripe call option as a hedge because if VXX is tracking the near-term VIX futures, if the market collapses, VIX futures go up, VXX goes up. You can look at, you know, what happened in 2020 to see how that goes. VXX exploded. But the problem is if you buy the 30-stripe call and VXX continues to decay because there's a period where the market doesn't collapse and now VXX is at 25, now instead of needing like any volatility increase for your call option to be in the money, now you need a 20% increase in those near-term VIX futures just to get back to your call strike. So as time goes on and as VXX decays, you need a larger and larger volatility increase to get back to your call strike or above it because in the case of VXX, it tracks the daily percentage changes of the near-term VIX futures. And so it's not even just like holding those futures contracts like the ITO, it's tracking like the daily percentage changes so the closing value of VXX compounds based on the daily percentage changes of the futures. So as the dollar value of VXX gets lower, you need a higher percentage change in the near-term VIX futures for that lower dollar amount to get back to your call strike. So I don't know if that makes sense, but there's like a mathematical decay to it. The lower VXX gets relative to your call strike, the higher the volatility spike needs to be to get back to your call strike or above it. So if you're going to use VXX to combat that instead of doing a longer-term VXX call like 30 or 60 days, you could do a much shorter-term call option. So like maybe like a seven-day and then every time they expire, you can roll that call strike down and re-state it. So that stays closer to the actual VXX price itself. But again, it's going to be a very costly trade to put on. And like you said, especially in that's like, I always think the dichotomy of hedging where you don't want to hedge perpetually because it's expensive, but then you also don't want to hedge when your house is on fire. So it's a bit of a bit of a nuanced discussion, I think, when it goes to effective portfolio hedging. But I think for me, it comes down like the most effective ways, which is risk management in terms of what you're offering the market. It's the most effective. But to your point, I think that there are some reasonable ways to deal with derivatives for a period of time. My preferable ways are, number one, look at your largest positions and go into those. Yep. And number two, hedging ways that is not it's not costly. So an example would be like my call strategy. Yep. In my strategy, if I have those long calls and then the stock price rips higher, shorting those higher strike calls is a way of hedging because I collect premium into my account. And basically, if I create those risk-free spreads, then I take all the risk off the table. But I'm not paying any money out of my account yet that protection. I'm basically collecting premium by creating a spread and it's reducing my overall delta exposure and also resetting my cost overall. It's reducing the cost of my position because if I pay 10 grand for that first call option and then later in the stock price is higher, I collect 10 grand to short a higher strike call. Now I have a risk-free position. And that's a way to hedge my portfolio risk because then if both of those options expire worthless, I don't lose anything. Whereas if I didn't put on that hedge and now the stock price is below my initial long call, well then I lose the 10 grand. Right. So that's a way of hedging, but it's not like a hedge where I'm buying puts, which is just a pure expense. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a, and that's one of the fun discussions about hedging a really options in general. It's just a very fluid environment where you can, like you said, you can approach positions, you can approach portfolio, you can use correlations. Yeah. I think that that's a really fun way of looking at it. So we've obviously been chatting for a minute. There is kind of one other question that I want to make sure that we get to. And it's just talking about trading in lower implied volatility environments. Like I was telling you about before that's something that one of my viewers mentioned that you were talking about. I'm not exactly sure the context, so I don't want to frame it any other way since it's your words. But essentially I would be curious from my perspective just to understand what the fuck they're talking about just in terms of like what's the context behind that? And then also how do you arrive at that kind of thought process? The context around it is there is, there is a camp of people who they like high volatility trading. So they like, they like shorting options when volatility is high because when volatility is high, then you get higher and more expensive option prices, and then you short the more expensive options. And ideally you see a decrease in market volatility or your the increase in volatility actually allows you to sell options that are further out of the money. Right. So you're hoping that you don't have swings that exceed those strike prices. So the thought process is that you're selling more expensive options and therefore that's good because selling more expensive options is better than selling less expensive options. And I argue against it because option prices scale with realized volatility. So if you have, if you have a 15 VIX and you're shorting options and then you go to a 30 VIX and you're shorting options, you're going to have much more expensive options that you're selling in the 30 VIX environment. But you don't have the same level of realized volatility. If you had the same level of realized volatility, meaning like the actual fluctuations in the market and you compare to 15 to 30 VIX, then yes, it would be better to short the more expensive options given the same amount of market volatility. But that's not how it works because realized volatility and implied volatility, the AKA option prices, they move and lockstep. And there's a chart that I made that was basically a scatter plot that looked at realized volatility in the S&P and the VIX index. And basically it's like a perfectly correlated line. It's my favorite chart I've ever made for sure analyzed because it very clearly shows that as realized volatility goes up. So as the market starts to fluctuate more, option prices get more expensive because with larger price swings in the underlying asset, then there's a larger expected potential value for an option because if you have an at the money option with a $5 expected move versus an at the money option with a $15 expected move, that $15 expected move means that that option that at the money option has the potential to be worth a lot more than in the lower volatility scenario. And so the option price is AKA implied volatility. They're the same exact thing. Implied volatility comes from option prices. So like option prices increase with market volatility. And another thing that the other thing that it comes from is there's a book I think it's called volatility trading by Uons and Claire. I don't know if I'm saying his name right. But he basically did an in-depth study that showed selling options in lower implied volatility environments had a higher expectancy than shorting options in higher and higher volatility environments. And actually, what's the prices? He showed that the higher the more extreme the volatility gets, there's actually like negative expectancy. And he it's not expectancy, but volatility risk premium is what he's talking about. So basically in like lower volatility environments when the markets are calm, even though you're selling cheaper options, they had more of a more of an edge that you captured versus when the market was much more volatile and you were shorting more expensive options. And actually like flip negative. So like that's interesting. In the times where you had hyper market volatility and you shorted options, there was actually like a loss expectancy. I'm you have to read the book to get numbers because it's been a while since I read it, but that was the gist of it. And it basically showed that shorting options in lower volatility environments was more profitable than shorting options in higher volatility environments. The other thing is that we don't have we don't have a lot of data on like ultra high volatility market environments because they typically don't last that long. Right. And so we have much more data in the lower volatility camp as we that we do in the extreme high volatility. So like VIX above 50 for example. So for just a quick question for for context, when you say low IV versus high IV, like what what values are you assigning those low IV I'm thinking ballpark like 15 VIX. Okay. But I would say like less than less than 20. I think the historical average I haven't actually like 17 or 18. Yeah. So like I think the average is like 19 and the median is like 17 and a half. Yeah. So yeah, I would say probably like under 17 and a half, like close to 15 that would be really low. But then in the high regime, I would say probably over over 30, 35. Okay. I'm not saying that you can't make money shorting options in high IV. And I'm not saying it's easy to make money shorting options in low IV. I'm just saying that it's not like a clear no brain or holy grail answer like some people think it is. That part I agree with. Yeah. Because I think I think a lot of folks just in general try to come up with some sort of persistent rule that always applies. And I just think you know that really exists much in trading rules. Yes. Yep. And I think having guiding. I think having guiding. There's no holy grail. Like you can't like selling VIX above selling options VIX above 30 is like always a no brainer. Other than selling may go away. You know, that one's wrong. I'm just kidding. That one always works. But yeah, no, I really do agree with the points that you raised. I think some of the things that I think about would be just the overstatement of volatility and how that changes in different volatility levels. I think that's an important integration of the conversation. And then the other thing that I do think is worth mentioning because I do sell a lot of premium is just the risk that we're exposed to. Because if you sell implied volatility, well, really if you sell premium in a low implied volatility environment, one, you have the same directional risk. But then you also have the now the volatility risk. Yeah. In terms of, you know, the expansion. Yeah. Of course. So I think exactly like you said, it really for me at least it's very environment dependent. And I also agree with kind of the range that you give because I do think that once implied volatility in general or volatility in general exceeds a certain level, it does become a bit more of a crapshoot. And really in the same camp as you. Yeah. And the same camp as you. One of the things that I think a lot of people forsake, they're like sell premium when it's high volatility. Oh, I'm making all this, you know, all this money. And the thing that I always kind of let people know, it's like there's a reason for that because the expected moves are that much larger at this point in time. So it's not like you're just making more money. And I feel like a lot of people just feel that way arbitrarily. Getting back to the house example is like you can make a lot of money selling fire insurance when there's no fires. You just collect the premiums. That's low IV. But then if you're selling the premiums at low IV and then the house burns down, then you have a big payout and you're you're on the hook. Right. And so you have to control the risk. But then on the other hand, like if you're selling fire insurance on a house that's burning down, like that's that doesn't seem like a good idea. And a lot of cases because basically you're betting that you can put out the fire faster than the damages can accrue to the the premium that you sold that right. That's possible. You know, so it's yeah, it's all I'm trying to say is that there's it's not a holy grail. It's not like this is better than that. It's option prices scale with market volatility. And just because you're getting higher premiums when selling your options, doesn't mean that it's a no-brainer because you also have larger larger swings in the asset. Absolutely. And I like I literally couldn't agree more with that. And I think a lot of folks like we're talking about they kind of want something that's like simple concise and always the case. And unfortunately, other than just buying an index ETF or something like that and coming back in 20 years, it's all it's all a crapshoot. Well, I definitely just really enjoy the conversation. I don't want to take much more of your time. I know that good one. But yeah, I got to go here soon. I got to dinner and wind down. Yeah, for sure, man. So I mean, with love to do, you know, another one in the future is always I I think the the conversations at least are just really candid. I get a lot of value out of talking with somebody from a different perspective. That's most of the fun. Yes for me. So yeah, so thanks for hanging out for a bit and definitely looking forward to connecting again. For sure. Take care brother. Yeah, you too.
