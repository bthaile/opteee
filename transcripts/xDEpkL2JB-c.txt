0.00s: All right, man, we're live. Chris, what's up, man?
4.48s: How much are you doing?
6.52s: Doing awesome. Thank you. I always love like the video intro after the introduction conversation that goes on for 10 minutes.
14.08s: They're always good. But it's always super stoked to have a conversation with you.
18.76s: I really enjoy your perspective. We were talking a little bit about that.
21.56s: I think that's one of the the funnest parts about having you on the channel is a chance to offer,
26.96s: at least my side of the house, a completely different perspective on a lot of things.
31.04s: Even though I do think that a lot of the bases of where we approach the market is pretty similar.
36.44s: So with that being said, I would love to start with kind of that first conversation we're just talking about.
44.44s: Something that my viewers and general are curious about and rightfully slow is just the idea of inflation.
52.24s: When we first started seeing it happen, it seemed like the Fed was really into it being more transitory.
58.32s: Something that's not necessarily going to be super persistent.
60.64s: They didn't want to necessarily have a big hand in it, those kinds of things.
64.36s: But we'd love to hear just your general thoughts on it.
67.28s: Don't need to go in any specific detail on policy or anything like that.
71.52s: But just your thoughts on inflation environment right now and then more importantly, what it looks like maybe for the next six months.
78.88s: That's a really difficult question.
82.24s: First of all, I'm not a macroeconomic expert by any means.
86.40s: But I do listen to a lot of podcasts and one thing that I've basically the general message that I've picked up
94.56s: from all the conversations that I've looked at is that everyone kind of has their own specific inflation rate.
101.20s: But one of the big things to point out I think is when we started to see the high inflation prints,
109.28s: a lot of people are saying that it was from the base effect, which is basically like if you look at a year prior to the current readings,
116.88s: when inflation was super low and then you go a year forward and prices are normalizing,
122.64s: the disparity between those numbers gets distorted because you're comparing a high number to the low point.
130.40s: Right.
130.88s: We're going to pass that and the CPI number.
134.72s: I think it's around like 5% right now, which is obviously really high.
139.68s: All I know generally is inflation and the super low rate environment that we have right now basically forces everybody into higher risk positions.
152.32s: Right.
153.20s: If you can eat chance whatsoever at having positive return.
156.56s: Right.
157.60s: So for me, just seeing the higher levels of inflation and even like the fear of higher inflation going forward,
165.28s: that's pushing more people into things like the stock market, real estate and crypto I think are like the three big things.
174.00s: I would say gold but gold is down this year.
176.72s: Yeah.
177.20s: Interestingly, I actually think it's very interesting that gold's down 8% this year and gold is supposed to be the inflation hedge.
186.08s: Right. So like when inflation starts to pick up, gold's supposed to be the asset that everyone turns to to protect their purchasing power.
194.80s: Right.
195.76s: And gold is actually down this year.
197.68s: So yeah, it started what at like 1960 something and now it's like covered right around 18.
204.40s: I'm looking at GLD right now.
205.68s: So GLD started the year at 180, 182 and now it's at 168.
211.12s: So if you parked your money in gold, then you're down 8% but if you parked your money in digital gold, aka Bitcoin, you're up 100%.
220.64s: So I think a little bit of that could be a rotation out of gold and into Bitcoin.
228.32s: Do you think they serve the same purpose to people's portfolios?
231.44s: Because like at least from my perspective, I would argue they don't.
235.84s: I would argue that they do.
237.68s: Okay.
238.40s: And well, first of all, the reason that the reason that Bitcoin is referred to as digital gold is that if you look at the properties of money, gold and Bitcoin have very similar properties except Bitcoin excels in many categories.
256.72s: Like for example, if we're talking about divisibility, Bitcoin is more divisible because you can divide one Bitcoin 100 million times into the smallest unit, which is called a Satoshi.
268.24s: Or Sat.
269.60s: And if you want to, if you actually have physical gold to divide it into super small units, it's just not practical because you basically have to shave off the goal, which is what everyone says, but like that's not that's not something you're going to want to do.
287.12s: And portability, it's way more portable because I can send a billion dollars across the globe via the Bitcoin network and it reaches final settlement in less than an hour and I could pay less than $10 and transaction fees.
302.88s: And that is far superior to gold because if I had a billion dollars worth of gold.
309.12s: First of all, I need to load it up onto some armored trucks and pay security guards to guard it. I have to get it to the airport and I have to fly it across the globe. And obviously that's super expensive.
321.92s: And cost aside, it just takes a really long time to get that across the globe. So in terms of portability, Bitcoin is far superior.
331.84s: And in terms of scarcity, gold has a very low inflation rate. I think it's like 2% a year. If I'm not mistaken.
343.20s: And that's very close to what Bitcoin is right now.
347.60s: But the difference is if gold's price surges, then gold miners can come online and increase or search for gold and discover more gold and bring it into supply.
361.12s: Faster and that would basically dampen that increase in price because new supply will come on the market faster than it was before given the higher price.
372.24s: So as price increases, it's more profitable to mine it. So they mine it more supply comes along online faster and that helps bring the price back down.
381.84s: With Bitcoin, you don't have any of that mechanic because no matter what, on average, every 10 minutes, the same amount of Bitcoin comes into the market.
393.84s: So right now it's 6 and a quarter Bitcoin on average every 10 minutes. And if Bitcoin's price doubles, then the difficulty adjustment kicks in, which basically makes it harder to find new blocks of transactions.
407.04s: And that increase in difficulty keeps it so that even though the price doubled, the supply can't increase faster and therefore bring the price back down.
417.28s: But the same is true on the other side, whereas like if gold's price collapses, then gold miners can shut down. And therefore we have less supply coming online becomes more scarce.
427.44s: And therefore that helps bring the price back up. So it's it basically dampens the volatility.
434.08s: Whereas Bitcoin, there are there's no assistance if it drops. So if Bitcoin's price goes down 50% then basically the difficulty is going to drop and it's going to keep the new issuance of Bitcoin right around 10 minutes on average over the long term.
451.44s: Right. And the side as I described if Bitcoin's price doubles, then more miners are going to fire up and it'll be faster momentarily, but it'll be less than two weeks or whatever because basically every like 2000 blocks or approximately every two weeks.
467.76s: There is a difficulty adjustment, which basically gauges how fast new blocks are being added to the ledger.
474.96s: And if it's faster than 10 minutes, then the difficulty increases. And if it's slower than 10 minutes, that means it's too hard. So they decrease the difficulty. So there's Bitcoin has so called like perfectly in elastic supply or almost perfectly in elastic, which basically just grabs it.
492.56s: Have laid out, which is that doesn't matter if the price increases or decreases supply issuance is the same.
498.16s: So yeah, that was that was a really long tangent, but I think when you look at gold versus Bitcoin, Bitcoin is better on many of the properties of money compared to gold.
511.92s: And I think that's probably why we're seeing gold suffer this year and Bitcoin is taking off because the future is digital right everything's moving digital.
522.56s: Right. And so now that we have this idea of digital scarcity or digital real estate, why would somebody want to have a gold bar in their house, as opposed to just information where you can take around the world with you and you can access your Bitcoin.
538.32s: You can send it anywhere in the world. You can verify it very easily. And yeah, it's fine at least scarce too. So yeah, I'm only going to be 21 million Bitcoins as opposed to
549.32s: you know, who knows how much gold we can dig out of the ground. So yeah, and I agree with a lot of those points. I think the especially when it comes to just the practicality, I think that's one of the conversations that we see around Bitcoin already right like is it a commodity is it a currency and a lot of folks struggle with that for a lot of those reasons that you just laid out right fully. So I think the perspective I have on gold probably differs in the purpose of it because for me.
580.12s: A lot of folks that I think that that purchase gold, they're probably not trying to, you know, get a thousand bricks of gold and then go make a purchase with it.
590.00s: I don't think that's really what most folks most folks with gold are trying to do. It seems like more of a place where people want to park their cash with lower volatility.
599.52s: And that's really where I see the big divergence between Bitcoin and gold is really derived more from the purpose that it serves in a person's portfolio as compared to anything because to me, I look at something, you know, like Bitcoin, which has what is it the monthly one standard deviation on it right now is like 11,000 plus or minus.
622.52s: So, yes, it's a very high it's a high volatility asset over time will it will become less volatile though and I know that very young it's a very young asset and it's like if you look at any high growth company right after their IPO, the volatility is insane.
640.32s: But then if you fast forward 10 years, the volatility is at a much more normal level, it could still be high in the case of something like Tesla, but the volatility is to the upside, you know, you can't you can't go from zero to a trillion dollar market cap with low volatility agreed.
660.28s: And so if if
662.00s: If your main goal is capital preservation and you're not interested in growth, you just kind of want to preserve your purchasing power, then you want something with low volatility and historically that could be something like US treasuries, but it's different historically because
682.96s: You would actually get a positive real return on that which means the yield on the bond is higher than inflation, but right now, I don't know what the 30 year treasury yield is, but it's somewhere around 1.5% if I'm not mistaken, 1.8% or something like that.
697.72s: And if you have inflation or like the CPI inflation, if you're going off that number and the yield on a 30 year treasury is less than 2% then you're you're losing more than 3% and purchasing power every year and that's if you're going off of that CPI number.
714.72s: But another thing about inflation too, I mentioned earlier, is like everyone has a different form of inflation.
720.72s: Michael Saler says this a lot in his podcasts. He's he basically says like if if you're buying the S&P 500 and that's what you're trying to acquire and the S&P is up 23% this year, then your inflation rates 23% right because if you're holding cash and you just missed out on that 23% increase.
742.72s: Well, now you can buy far less of S&P 500 stock than you could before. And so the inflation rate isn't just it's not just based on the basket of goods that the government publishes. It's whatever you are trying to acquire. So if you're trying to buy real estate and real estate is going up at 15% a year, whatever the number is over the past 12 to 18 months, then if you haven't seen the S&P 500, you can see that the S&P 500 is going to be a lot of money.
772.72s: And yet, acquired a house, then now it's gotten a lot more expensive to do that because house prices has gone up over 10% 15% right.
782.72s: Yeah, I agree with you. And I think that your overall perspective anyways on like Bitcoin versus gold in general, I pretty much align with it, especially like the longer term prospect because for me, I think more as Bitcoin becomes more stable less volatile.
799.72s: And I think more of a lot more of that capital preservation purpose. I think right now a lot of people are more interested in it for, you know, the growth rightfully so like you said, it is very much like a startup.
811.72s: It is also a form of capital preservation. I mean capital preservation, the name of the game is to not it's a grow more than inflation.
818.72s: Because if you're not growing more than inflation, then you're losing purchasing power. But like we've discussed.
825.72s: If you're sitting in cash and CPI is 5% a year, then you're losing 5% purchasing power a year, if it goes higher than that.
836.72s: And there are countries around the world where they have double or triple digit inflation. If you're in cash, you, you're getting annihilated right now.
847.72s: And there's over a billion people in the world that are living under double or triple digit inflation.
853.72s: And that's those are the people that are trying to acquire Bitcoin too, like the countries that have the highest adoption rate for Bitcoin or the countries that have the most unstable currencies.
864.72s: The high sense is right because their Bitcoin doesn't discriminate.
869.72s: It's an off ramp for anybody who needs to use it.
874.72s: So if you're in a different country and you can access the internet, then you can access Bitcoin, whereas maybe you couldn't get US dollars and like that because there's capital restrictions or maybe you can't even open a bank account.
887.72s: And so if you can access the internet and those things are true, then you can access Bitcoin, which is like if you're living under 10% inflation.
896.72s: Then owning Bitcoin and seeing it go down 50% in a few months is better than losing 100% on an annual basis.
905.72s: Yeah, I think if you're 100%.
907.72s: I think if you're staying in the currency. Yeah, I think that argument would hold true. The only the only counter I would offer you is, you know, if in your inflation example, if you hold gold or cash.
919.72s: And at the end of the year, you lose 5% with Bitcoin. There's a chance at the end of the year. It could be down.
926.72s: And you know, then you're down 30% plus the five or whatever.
930.72s: Right.
931.72s: So I think a lot of it comes from like your firm belief in the appreciation of Bitcoin, which I mean, I personally think is well founded. I also am generally bullish long term of Bitcoin.
940.72s: But I do think long term. It's a long term game. Yeah.
943.72s: I think it's just an important caveat to point out because a lot of the viewers, at least on my channel, some of them are 60, some of them are 70. You know what I mean? And yeah, I do think that's have a different.
954.72s: This is the most difficult thing about like when you when you think about the whole landscape of where you can put your money.
962.72s: Historically, if you had a normal environment, let's say you had 30 year treasury at a 5% yield and inflation is 2% or 1.5% or whatever it is.
975.72s: Then if you're 60 years old, you can put your money in US treasuries and that's a very, you know, it's a very reasonable place.
983.72s: Especially if you like you've seen interest rates fall over the past few decades. And that's bullish for bonds because if you buy a bond at 5% and then the yield drops to 4%.
996.72s: You have a capital gain on your bond position. So you're you're earning the yield. You're earning the coupon rate, but you're also seeing your bond position appreciate.
1007.72s: But now you don't have like there's nowhere for someone to put their money that's really low risk because, like I said, if you have all of your wealth and cash.
1019.72s: It's a melting ice cube as Michael sailor would put it.
1023.72s: And in the scenario where inflation gets out of hand and cash position can be completely obliterated.
1031.72s: I think our 0% is basically cash and then US Treasury at 1.5% is better than earning 0% in a savings account. But at the end of the day, it's still a fiat currency based contract, meaning your coupon payments are in the fiat currency.
1050.72s: And ultimately when the bond matures, you get your currency back. And so if the fiat currency is unstable, then ultimately the bond position is unstable because you're cash flows are coming from that currency.
1065.72s: Right now, like there's you can't you can invest in the lower risk asset classes or the traditionally lower risk asset classes because capital.
1075.72s: You're losing purchasing power in cash savings and bonds.
1079.72s: And so if you if you want any chance at earning a higher percentage than inflation, you have to go to something that's higher risk.
1086.72s: Like the stock market, you know, I think that's what we're seeing.
1091.72s: Because people understand exactly what we're talking about right now.
1096.72s: And there's really nowhere. I which is the it's very unfortunate for people who are older and have a conservative wealth preservation mindset.
1106.72s: You mentioned a couple times double digit inflation. Do you think that's potentially in the cards for us?
1113.72s: I don't want to speculate on that.
1115.72s: For me, I honestly think that it completely random guess, but I would guess maybe up to eight or nine percent, but after that I couldn't imagine.
1127.72s: I couldn't imagine the Fed doing too much of standing still after that, but I mean, again, who the hell knows.
1133.72s: I have people like Kathy would of our confessed she has said recently that in 2008 when they started printing money, she thought there's going to be hyper inflation.
1144.72s: But the velocity of money was low and velocity of money is how quickly it's changing hands.
1150.72s: So if you have an inflow of them, if you basically have all this helicopter money and the velocity of money is picking up that means there's just a lot more trading activity.
1161.72s: It's a scenario for higher inflation if I'm understanding it correctly, but what she was saying is that we did see an increase in the money supply in 2008, but the velocity of money was slowing and so there wasn't that hyper inflationary event.
1175.72s: And so she has stated that there's a very similar thing going on right now, which is that there's a big increase in the money supply, but the velocity of money is is slowing.
1185.72s: I haven't personally looked at that stat recently, so I don't know if it's actually what the trajectory looks like, but that's what she said in a tweet the other day.
1193.72s: So that's understanding that correctly, that's kind of her line of thinking, but I have no idea what inflation is going to do, but like just the mere worry of high inflation is enough to make people move their money around and that's, I think that's what we're seeing in the higher risk assets.
1214.72s: So the stock market is ripping real estate's ripping, Bitcoin's ripping it's it's, it's, yeah, it's.
1223.72s: There's nowhere to put your money on the lower risk side of things, which is right fortunate as I've said.
1229.72s: Yeah, yeah, I agree, I really agree with the overall sentiment and it does create a very fascinating environment because of, I don't know, even the the COVID recovery surprised me in a lot of ways, but just in terms of the influx of money and when it came in to the to the stock market, but I think that even right now I've been watching the volume in the eminies and you know just order flow in there and that is also an interesting benchmark.
1258.72s: I think for you know how many people are keeping more money in the in the markets of of a similar note slightly different though something that some of the viewers were kind of curious about is just do you think or do you think.
1274.72s: Do you foresee any sort of like significant impact on the rest of the earnings cycle given the current inflation environment I know for my perspective, the reason why I think that's just an interesting discussion is a lot of the folks that we see reporting earnings war pull,
1291.72s: They found some really new people who, they found products that are wants to compare with domestic such as subsequent
1305.76s: do you think that like the crypto stocks or money that will see their investment on the economics of earnings fixed to it Hopefully you do have buy a margin on social.
1316.74s: So then I believe something we really get from the financials that are pulling off a bit and that it useful for them want to help make it really change.
1320.34s: I'm not sure. I haven't I haven't been following this earning cycle very closely. I've basically
1327.94s: been watching Bitcoin and watching my positions that I have, which are all the big ones are
1333.42s: Bitcoin related. More fun to watch. But yeah, that makes sense. So if you have a rising
1339.06s: cost of your inputs as a business, then you basically you have to you have to pass that
1344.38s: onto your customers. Otherwise, your margins get annihilated, right? Yeah. And we're kind
1349.74s: of there are people who post on Twitter too, where they'll go and buy, um, they call it
1354.26s: shrink flation, where they'll go and buy paper towels or something like that. And then they'll
1359.94s: go back and buy it a couple of months later. And basically they'll be paying the same
1366.26s: amount, but there will be like a lower number of sheets in the paper towel or something.
1370.94s: Oh, that's funny. I'm heard of that. They're instead of increasing the price for the same
1376.14s: quality. They're keeping the price the same and decreasing the amount of material that
1381.02s: you get. You're expecting like 160 sheets and you're like, now you get 158. Yeah, exactly.
1387.22s: That's. So yeah, if you're as a business, if your inputs, the cost of your inputs are
1393.54s: going up, you have to pass that off to the customer if you want to keep your margins
1398.94s: the same. So I think for me, what I found interesting in it so far is just how pervasive
1405.30s: in how topical it is for a lot of different companies that I always find interesting to
1409.74s: see if like there's one industry that's getting hammered really hard for whatever reason,
1413.42s: but this seems pretty widespread at this point.
1416.58s: It's on the other day too. He was saying that they're seeing considerable increase in
1423.46s: the cost of their goods. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it makes it makes both sense. Um, so we have
1430.02s: been talking a little bit about Bitcoin and whatnot. And as I'm sure you know, there's
1435.10s: a new kid on the block, bit O. I recently did a video on it essentially just walking
1441.74s: through the construction of it, just suitability for holding slash trading, those kinds of
1446.94s: things. But I would love to get, you know, just your initial thoughts on bit O and its utility.
1454.46s: Primarily, I would argue primarily as a trader, I think just like most commodity based,
1460.62s: you know, ETFs, they have a certain amount of drag that they're going to suffer and
1464.98s: that just kind of is what it is. So it makes long term holding a little more difficult.
1467.94s: But all that aside, curious what your general thoughts are on, uh, bit O. Yeah. I think, um,
1474.98s: as a trading vehicle, I think it works. Thank you for trying. If you're in your brokerage
1479.22s: account and you have a stock and options trading portfolio and you don't want to go open
1484.22s: up an account at a crypto exchange to trade elsewhere and have two separate accounts and
1489.42s: you want to keep it all under one roof. Then using something like BITO and using it
1494.94s: as a trading vehicle, I think is, is fine. I am strongly opposed to owning it or buying
1501.58s: it and owning it long term because you're not investing in the actual asset. And this isn't
1508.30s: just Bitcoin. This is any futures based ETF. You're investing in the changes in the futures
1514.78s: contracts. And depending on if they are at a premium or discount to the actual asset itself,
1522.78s: then that will change the expected returns for that asset. Right. So like, for example,
1528.62s: in the case of BITO, if Bitcoin is at 60,000, the actual price of Bitcoin, um, and then you're
1536.22s: looking at the December or the November futures contract in Bitcoin and that's trading at
1543.18s: 65,000. Did I say 60,000 Bitcoin? 60. Yeah. Yeah. If the if the November futures at 65,000
1549.58s: and Bitcoin remains right at 60,000 through the November futures settlement date,
1554.94s: that November futures is going to slowly decay from 65,000 to 60,000. But I like to say,
1561.34s: as a futures contract with no future is equal to the asset. Right. Yeah. I feel like you have
1567.18s: a futures contract with zero days to settlement or like one minute to settlement. Then the futures
1573.50s: price is going to be essentially whatever the asset price is. Right. But when you go further
1579.58s: out in time, it, you know, it depends on whatever asset we're talking about. Like if you're talking
1582.94s: about oil, um, the futures contract, it kind of bakes in the storage costs and stuff like that for
1588.62s: oil. So if you buy physical oil, you have to put it somewhere to pay for storage. And so that's
1594.22s: embedded in the futures pricing. But for something like Bitcoin, I have noticed that I haven't been
1601.34s: watching the futures relative to Bitcoin's price very closely. But I have noticed that it is
1607.82s: the futures are trading at a slight premium. Yep. So if you get a period of time where you're
1612.78s: invested in a futures base ETF and the actual asset price is not increasing, then you are investing
1621.02s: in an ETF that's holding the futures contracts that are decreasing. Right. They asset prices
1626.70s: remaining the same. You're investing in this future here. If the asset price remains the same,
1632.06s: you get this negative return in the future. And then once this future settles, they have to roll
1637.58s: those funds into the next month, which is could be here again. And then if you get another flat
1642.86s: period. So basically you're just perpetually holding the decaying futures. And if you look at
1649.74s: the XX, that's exactly why the XX has this very predictable decay over time. It's because the
1655.98s: VIX index trades in a very predictable range. Like it's basically between like 15 and 30,
1662.62s: 95% of the time. But when it's less than, let's just say 20 or 25, the VIX futures are trading at a
1671.58s: premium to the VIX index. And during normal market conditions, the VIX index is going to remain
1678.14s: fairly steady. And those futures contracts are going to decay lower towards the VIX index as they
1683.90s: approach their settlement date. And the XX is tracking the percentage returns into VIX futures contracts,
1690.78s: not the returns in the VIX index. So that's another example. But it is different because there's no
1697.18s: expectation that the VIX index is going to go from 15 to 150, very, you know, over time,
1707.26s: over the next few years. Whereas in Bitcoin, there is that expectation for the VIX
1712.38s: coin bowls because it has that number go up technology, which basically just means that there's more
1717.90s: money flowing into the VIX coin ecosystem. And since there's only 21 million coins, if you have
1725.42s: more and more people, where aka money trying to flow into a limited space arena, then, you know,
1732.06s: the cost of a seat is going to go up. So the cost of it go up. And so if you have that
1736.70s: increasing Bitcoin price over time, even though the futures contracts could be trading at a premium
1742.54s: to Bitcoin itself, it's not going to be the same return as simply holding Bitcoin. So there will
1748.62s: be that drag, but it wouldn't be that like nasty bleed that VIX X experiences because that's because
1756.22s: the VIX index is typically trading between 15 and 20 and the VIX futures are always at a premium
1763.58s: to the VIX index in that scenario. Right. Go three, six, nine months, where the VIX index is
1770.06s: relatively neutral. And basically that means that like market volatility, there's not really
1776.46s: many severe drawdowns. Market volatility is fairly normal, so to speak. Then you're going to have
1780.86s: that constant bleed in VIX X. So there are differences. You can't like comparing VIX X to VITO
1786.94s: is not the same, but overall, if you're investing in VIX X, just know that it's probably more of a
1794.94s: trading vehicle and it's not suitable for long-term holds. It's a, and I mean, I think the way that you
1803.02s: explain like tracking error and things like that is it really, really helpful lose the
1807.42s: dates to point quite a bit. Because I talked quite a bit about just the idea of Bitcoin in general.
1813.18s: Like something that I think some folks may not even understand is like tons of people trade
1819.42s: Bitcoin itself, but you don't have to cough up the money for one entire Bitcoin if you don't have
1824.54s: the capital, right? You can trade partials of Bitcoin. So for me, what I think at least is if you're
1830.94s: kind of a long-term believer in Bitcoin and you want to trade Bitcoin itself as Bitcoin,
1837.42s: something like BITO is a little tricky because it's for on surface level people think,
1843.18s: oh great, you know, this is how I can get exposure, but exactly like you said, it doesn't hold
1846.62s: the product at all. And to me, there's no reason not to just go buy Bitcoin if you're someone
1851.02s: client to want to buy Bitcoin long-term. Another big thing that I want to say is even if we had a
1858.86s: real Bitcoin ETF, I would still oppose buying that unless your only goal is to isolate the
1868.06s: investment aspect of Bitcoin. Because if you own a Bitcoin ETF, so you own 100 shares or whatever
1875.98s: it is, you own shares of the Bitcoin ETF, like a real Bitcoin ETF. You can't use the Bitcoin
1882.46s: payment network. You can't actually send that Bitcoin anywhere. And in a scenario where
1890.70s: you want it to go to different countries, something and take your Bitcoin with you, you can't use
1896.38s: your Bitcoin ETF shares. You're going to need the actual Bitcoin in that case. Another thing is
1903.58s: if the tax treatment of Bitcoin were to change in the future, let's say you bought a Bitcoin ETF,
1911.98s: you're comparing buying a Bitcoin ETF for $100,000 and actual Bitcoin for $100,000, not like per
1918.62s: Bitcoin, but just your investment. And both of those positions grow to $200,000. In a scenario where
1925.98s: Bitcoin is recognized as currency, and you don't have to pay capital gains on any spending in Bitcoin,
1935.82s: then if you own the Bitcoin ETF, you would have to sell the shares to actually
1943.50s: money out of that. Whereas in that scenario, I'm not saying this will happen. It's just
1947.90s: something I'm thinking about. In the scenario where you have the gain, but then it starts to be
1952.22s: recognized as currency, then you would have that gain, but you wouldn't have to pay capital gains
1956.54s: when you spend it. Right. And I actually can have this taken. There might be some like one time
1961.66s: taxation if they did do something like that. But that's just in my mind, when you're investing in an
1968.46s: ETF, you're isolating the investment case. And another example, we've been talking about gold.
1974.94s: If you buy GLD, you're just isolating the investment aspect of investing in gold. But you can,
1982.54s: like you don't actually have the gold, you can't use it. Right. I think it's a good. If you see
1989.82s: a future where you actually want to use the asset. And I think in Bitcoin's case, there's
1995.42s: a higher probability you'd want to use it as payment compared to something like a gold bar.
2000.78s: In that case, owning the ETF is not going to help you there. So I think it's a really good
2006.78s: piece of purpose because the purpose of Bitcoin is to remove all third parties from monetary value.
2015.10s: Right. So if you're invested in a Bitcoin ETF, you own shares that are in your investment portfolio,
2021.98s: that's how that essential party. So the only thing I would offer to the other side of the
2029.90s: discussion, because I totally agree with the ability to use the currency. I think for me, when I
2034.62s: look at things like Bitcoin futures or like a actual Bitcoin ETF, is I do think that there's an
2041.50s: opportunity to leverage the leverage that the marketplace offers you. And I think that there
2048.78s: is something to that side of the discussion for kind of commonly trading the product. But
2053.74s: in general, I agree with you that there's a certain utility that comes with being able to buy
2059.98s: generally in appreciating currency or whatever we're going to call it, that you can then just
2066.30s: use that currency to go make a purchase, go buy a Tesla with it or something like that. I do
2070.86s: think there's a lot of value in that. I do think there's going to be a lot of value when we get a
2078.38s: real ETF. And it might be a GBTC because GBTC right now is a trust and they're filing to convert to
2084.38s: an ETF. But from the conversations that I've heard that might not take that might not actually go
2089.42s: through for a year based on like the early assessments that I've heard from people who are
2094.94s: much closer to the matter. But once we have a Bitcoin ETF, I suspect that it's going to be
2102.86s: highly liquid, very actively traded. It'll have great option markets. And I think that'll be really
2108.22s: good for people who are interested in making options trades. Like right now, one of my biggest
2114.14s: positions that I talk about a lot is in micro strategy. Yep. Because they own like 120,000 Bitcoin.
2120.54s: And it's basically a Bitcoin holding company. And so the stock price tracks very closely with
2127.26s: Bitcoin movement. So if I buy call options and micro strategy, I'm doing that because it's a
2133.66s: Bitcoin play, not necessarily a micro strategy business play. But the reason that has added risk
2140.06s: because what if they sell their Bitcoin, then my play goes out the window and no longer
2147.98s: going to track Bitcoin. And I would much rather have that trade on in a Bitcoin ETF, but we don't
2155.02s: have one yet. So is there a reason why you would play something like micro strategy compared to
2159.34s: like Bitcoin futures directly? Yeah. I think it kind of gets back to what we talked about earlier. And
2168.46s: my option trades in micro strategy are long term. So they're a year expiration.
2175.42s: And if I did that same thing in BITO, I don't even know if they have options yet. Do they?
2180.78s: They do. Yeah, they it's actually funny. Their options got cleared like pretty quick.
2185.50s: Yeah, they're pretty liquid too. Yeah. That would I could do it in BITO, but like we talked
2193.82s: about, if we get a six month period where Bitcoin isn't really moving, then BITO is going to decay.
2202.70s: And my strike price remains fixed. And so the problem with that is if I have a fixed call strike
2207.98s: price and BITO is decaying because of the futures, then I need a bigger movement to get back to where
2214.30s: it was before and even bigger movement before my call option is in the money. So that's why that's
2219.74s: what I was curious about. That's why I was curious about the futures themselves like something like
2225.18s: the G22s that are 120 days out. What's the what's the appeal for, you know, like, was a micro strategy versus
2233.66s: the further dated future. And if I'm understanding correctly, response is just because it's the longer
2239.34s: term play and you don't want to have that tracking error. Yeah. And also when you when you're talking
2246.30s: about futures contracts, longer term futures contracts are less sensitive to changes in the asset
2254.70s: price compared to a shorter term futures contract or the shortest term futures contract, like I
2261.90s: said earlier, a futures contract with no future is equal to the asset. Right. Like the VIX index,
2267.42s: when you look at how the VIX index moves relative to the VIX futures, if the VIX index goes from 17 to 30,
2276.30s: the second most volatile asset that tracks the VIX is going to be the nearest term VIX future.
2282.38s: So let's just say the VIX future with a with 20 days to settlement is going to increase
2287.98s: more than a VIX future with 100 days to settlement. That's the case of the the VIX index and VIX
2296.46s: futures structure. I'm not sure how it would be in Bitcoin, but I suspect if you had if you had a
2303.34s: really big blow off top in Bitcoin, then the longer term futures might be trading at a discount
2309.34s: to Bitcoin. But overall, they would move like the longer term future would move less than a shorter
2318.06s: term future. Right. So that's kind of the problem with one of the mistakes that new options
2323.74s: traders make is that they look at the VIX options. And they if you're in a low volatility environment
2331.34s: and the market seems like it's richly valued in your anticipating a market sell off.
2336.22s: Instead of going to the 30 day VIX options, they'll go to like the 180 day VIX options.
2342.14s: But what you're doing when you do that is you're not trading the 30 day VIX futures.
2348.06s: You're trading options that are tracking the 180 day VIX future. And even if the VIX goes from
2354.38s: 17 to 30, that 180 day VIX future might go up like a couple points. It's not going to go up nearly
2361.58s: as much as that 30 day VIX future. And since the VIX options are tracking those respective futures
2367.02s: contracts, you're going to have a much more explosive movement in that shorter term VIX expiration
2373.90s: cycle. Right. Yeah. I think that's a great point. And it's as opposed to just making like trading a
2381.18s: trading a 700 day call option and micro strategy, the stock price is going to track the actual
2387.18s: changes in Bitcoin's price. It's not tracking the 700 day futures contract, which is less volatile
2393.74s: than the actual asset. Right. That's a really, really good point. I think that that's something that
2399.98s: I hadn't really considered myself is just the way that the product is going to move.
2405.66s: I need to like I speak very confidently about that structure in like VIX versus VIX futures.
2412.78s: But I need to pay attention to Bitcoin and Bitcoin futures. Right.
2417.18s: Right. I have only checked the prices occasionally, but I'm fairly confident that that same thing holds
2423.90s: true in the Bitcoin futures markets. Like the longer term. Yeah.
2427.50s: Yeah. It's all then the shorter term. So like the most the most volatile thing is going to be
2433.98s: the actual asset itself. And then the longer term futures are typically way less volatile.
2439.98s: And the less time you have, the closer you get to the actual asset itself, the more volatile
2445.42s: those futures contracts. Yep. Yeah. I think yeah. Because I mean, I've been trading the Bitcoin
2451.10s: futures quite a bit myself. And I think that that's completely accurate.
2455.98s: So this leads us to kind of two different ways we can go at the conversation. But I think
2462.54s: you were just talking a little bit about some of your positions in micro strategy. What you've
2467.02s: been in kind of playing. I feel like that like everything is Bitcoin related. I just feel I know
2477.58s: some people in my audience get annoyed at the whole Bitcoin thing, but it's like that's where it's
2483.26s: at right now in my mind. And so that's like, I feel annoying sometimes just constantly talking about it.
2491.02s: Almost every topic that we've talked about this far in this conversation has involved Bitcoin
2495.10s: in one way or another. But I think that's fair. Because the conversations that we've been talking about,
2499.82s: you know, is intimately tied to it. So I think we can offer them an olive branch. And I think for
2507.18s: your folks, the good conversation would be what are some of your favorite strategies so far this year.
2516.62s: So I think that even if it's tied to Bitcoin that you've enjoyed trading, I still think you can,
2521.42s: you know, discuss a little bit the strategy. And then maybe they'll be a little more chill.
2528.46s: Yeah, let's hope. Yeah, I've been I've been using this strategy. My go to strategy still.
2536.78s: And I've used this not just in micro strategy, but also in I've got one in square.
2543.26s: You're that everybody? Square. I did it in Tesla bunch. I've got it in in video. So I've been using
2550.86s: this strategy. Basically, since the pandemic started and since I stopped shorting the market,
2556.22s: which was in like May or June of last year. Basically, the play is to buy call options,
2564.14s: long dated call options. So like over over a year to expiration, because I'm not confident enough
2570.78s: in my directional place to make like a two day, like a seven day option play. I think the shorter
2577.02s: term you go, especially when you get into less than a week, it's very, very close to a slot machine.
2584.86s: So funny, no, that's funny note on that is kind of I'm actually working on a study right now with
2593.82s: my audience on price prediction. And we're tying in some like white papers we've read or out price
2599.50s: prediction and accuracy over time. So I think it's just interesting. You mentioned that because that is
2604.78s: like one of the most pervasive hypothesis in pretty much all of the studies is that you short in
2610.38s: the time frame. People are way less accurate. So I really good point. It's like, uh,
2617.10s: wow, throwback to binary options. I don't know if you remember. Yeah, buddy. I'm sure they still
2621.98s: exist, but it's a it's a dark corner of the object. It's like, it's like, do you think
2627.74s: S.P.Y. is going to be above or below 250 in the next 90 seconds? It's just flip a course. Yeah,
2634.14s: it's it's nuts. Um, yeah, the short, I mean,
2639.34s: you can make a lot of money. Like when you see those, I hate to call them out, but if you see the
2644.86s: Wall Street Bet Straders that make millions and millions of dollars from a few thousand dollars,
2649.82s: they're they do that by buying a ton of short dated options. Right. Because when you when you go
2656.86s: shorter term with options, the option contracts are cheaper because the expected stock price
2662.86s: movement over a shorter duration is much smaller and therefore the options are much cheaper.
2668.62s: And there's also less time value. You can yeah, you can afford a ton more contracts. Right.
2675.02s: And so when you do that, you if you if you're right about a big movement in your favor,
2679.82s: you'll have way more leverage by owning a thousand call options as opposed to going like a hundred
2685.74s: days out and owning 10 10 contracts for the same price. Yeah, I think for a day,
2691.10s: you only have seven days to be right and then you lose 100% whereas like I prefer to go further out
2696.78s: and it takes a lot a lot longer to lose all of my money in that aggressively bullish play.
2704.06s: Right. So anyway, that's my strategy as I buy long dated call options, typically deep out of
2710.46s: the money depending on which product it was, but I did it successfully in Tesla, um, in video,
2716.06s: basically tech stocks and micro strategy. And then once I initiate the long calls,
2723.10s: once the stock price increases, hopefully it does, like if you're right and it increases substantially,
2729.74s: then basically you'll have higher strike call options that'll be trading at or more than the
2736.38s: premium you paid for the for the initial call option. So like for example, if you the stock
2741.82s: price is 500 and you buy the 750 call option for $10 and then the stock price goes from 500 to 600,
2752.22s: now your 750 call option is going to be worth like $20 or $30. I don't know what it is, I'm just
2757.34s: spit buying it. But that means there is a higher strike contract that will be worth $10. So maybe that's
2763.74s: the 800 call option. And so if you buy the 750 call for $10, stock price shoots higher
2771.50s: and now the 800 call is worth $10. You can short the 800 call and create a risk-free spread.
2779.02s: And so that's my strategy that I've been doing for the past, past year or so now.
2785.42s: So it starts pretty much a like pretty directional plan. It starts very directional. You have to,
2792.06s: you have to take a big risk initially to get a risk-free trade. Like to make a risk-free trade,
2797.02s: you have to take risk first. You have to expose yourself to that lost potential. And then you have
2803.34s: to be right about the direction. And then once you have a profitable long naked option, then you can
2809.26s: kind of trade around it. And I like that strategy because in my example, let's say,
2814.54s: you know, the stock price shot up. And now I have this 750, 800 call spread for free. If the stock
2820.30s: price goes back down, then I'll have a profit on my short call because if I sold it for $10
2826.94s: at the top and then the stock price trades lower, then maybe now it's trading for $5. I can buy it
2832.22s: back for $5. Keep that $500 profit. And then if the stock price continues another leg higher,
2839.18s: then I'm in a position where I can either resell that one or re-call it a higher strike. And that's
2845.02s: it gives you a lot of flexibility. But the prerequisite for that strategy to work is that you have
2851.26s: to be right about a big movement in the stock price. And you and I have talked about this a little
2856.94s: bit, but you also have to be resolute enough to wait until you're right that much. Which I always
2863.10s: think for a lot of people because a lot of the I like to call them the cool aid folks, but your
2868.86s: people over at Tasty Trade, a lot of things that they talk about is just managing winners, right?
2874.22s: So taking winning trades down. But I think for something like that, it's counterintuitive to be
2879.74s: disciplined enough to let go and go. You got to have the diamond hands that is being hard because
2885.26s: there's a balance between being too greedy and waiting too long and then never taking that risk
2891.42s: off the table. You kind of have to have I like to have like general stock price levels like, oh,
2897.02s: if the stock price gets to this price, then I'm going to start looking at adjustments here. But the
2903.66s: main thing for me, the most important thing with that strategy, like if you're going to take the risk,
2908.86s: let's say you put 10 grand into and out of the money option that has two years to go and the stock
2913.74s: rips higher. Yeah. You don't want to block your profits too soon. What I mean by that, if you buy the,
2921.34s: let's just say another random example, let's say you buy like the thousand straight call for 10 grand
2927.18s: and then the stock price shoots higher like a couple days later and then you short the 1050 call
2934.54s: for 10 grand. Now you have a $50 wide call spread with two years to expiration. Basically that 50
2941.26s: wide $50 wide call spread with two years to expiration is basically going to be like a brick.
2945.66s: Like it's not going to move very much. Right. It's not price goes up a lot or goes down a lot.
2950.46s: The profit change on that spread is not going to be that significant because it has two years to go
2956.62s: and those strikes are so close together that it's almost like it's almost like having no position.
2962.46s: Right. Yeah. One way to think of if you have a vertical spread like the wider the spread gets,
2970.22s: the closer it is to a long option. Right. That's why for like really long term bullish plays,
2975.90s: I like really wide call spreads. Like right now, in Tesla, I have the 900 1500 call spread.
2982.14s: Which at this point is actually looking really good. I've had that on for quite a while now.
2987.66s: Yeah, I've had it on. I bought the 900 call 400 days ago for 10 grand and now it's trading for
2997.42s: 30. Right. But then 238 days ago, I shorted the 1500 call for 12 grand. So I basically created the
3006.86s: risk free 900 1500 call spread. And now it's looking really good because Tesla is above the 900
3015.66s: strike call. Right. So now I still have 450 days on that trade. And so I can continue to wait.
3021.34s: And who knows and 450 days maybe Tesla will be above 1500. That's a good amount of time.
3027.90s: But the key there is that I waited 180 days between the long call entry and the short call entry.
3035.98s: Not that the time frame necessarily matters, but I was able to wait long enough to where I could
3041.34s: create a really wide spread because the stock price went parabolic. And then I took that opportunity to
3047.90s: short that 1500 call, which obviously even after Tesla's meteoric rise recently, it's still $500
3054.46s: out of the money. But since the stock price went vertical. So quickly, what happens is when that
3061.58s: happens, the call options just explode because everybody rushes in to buy more call options. So not
3069.50s: only are you making money on the stock price increasing via the delta, but everyone is trying to
3076.86s: join in on that momentum trade and all that money is just piling into those calls. And so the
3082.14s: implied volatility also explodes. And so that's why when you have, like typically if you're looking at
3087.58s: the S&P 500 implied volatility or the VIX will increase as the S&P 500 goes down. But for some of
3095.18s: these high high growth stocks, the opposite happens where if they start to take off, then the
3101.34s: implied volatility actually explodes when the stock price is increasing. So if you own call options
3107.02s: in that environment, you're you're killing it because you're making stock price increase. And also
3112.86s: everyone flooding into the options and inflating their prices even more. And that makes it that's
3118.46s: like a really good example and scenario for when you'd want to take that opportunity and short a call
3124.54s: against your long call to create that risk free spread, especially if you can get like a really wide
3129.98s: spread. I think the other thing that I like to do because I kind of have a very specific
3136.22s: leap diagonal strategy that I like to run normally it's on the call side. But one of my favorite
3142.94s: things to do there anyways is to trade it at a ratio. So if you have 10 longs, whenever you have
3149.10s: that chance for that risk free spread, you can kind of calculate how much capital you need to take
3153.34s: in a payoff that trade. So instead of maybe selling 10 calls against it, you sell eight and you
3157.98s: recoup most of the cost and yet you still don't cap your up, you know that kind of thing.
3162.78s: But because it yeah, it seems the way that you and I enter that trade is actually pretty similar
3169.18s: because when I'm going with the call leap diagonal, I normally will establish the long position
3175.42s: partial. So I always get ready to kind of add to it over time. I budget some capital to do that.
3181.66s: But if I offer any sort of short call against the long call, it's always at a very small ratio to
3190.46s: exactly to your point, give the trade time to work, right? That's the whole point of getting a leap
3194.78s: is to put some time in the trade. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's what my favorite strategy has been
3200.94s: going well. But I think one thing I really want to say that's important is that I have no confidence
3208.78s: that I'll be able to do this forever because the stock prices and the stock market overall, they
3214.14s: can't go up forever, right? Right. That's why it was fortunate timing because last year when the
3220.78s: stock market collapsed and then it started to bounce off at the lows, I started to get short
3227.18s: and I was betting against further increases in the market because I thought we were just going
3232.30s: to have a little bounce and then we were going to continue to plunge lower. I was like buying all these,
3237.90s: I was buying like 100 strike puts and spy when spy was at like 200 or whatever and the market kept
3246.78s: going up and I kept adding to my short position. And then eventually I was like, wait a second,
3251.90s: I started paying more attention to monetary policy and the market response is to what the Fed was
3259.02s: doing. And I flipped, which was a really hard decision because it's hard to lose money,
3265.98s: it started bleeding money being short and then flip long. But ultimately I just came to the
3272.14s: conclusion that the market is going to listen and basically trust the monetary policy and that was
3279.58s: my basis for flipping. I feel like then that the market's been up so much over the past 12 plus
3286.22s: months that like I would not, I would be careful to to enter the trades that I'm talking about at
3293.10s: these current levels. Yeah, but I think that that's like pretty impressive on the flip because I
3299.58s: feel like that's such a double edged sword, right? That's why it's as scary as because like I
3305.10s: flipped, then the market's going to crash. Yeah, because I mean it shows your ability to, because I do
3309.18s: think that there's something to be said to look at a losing position objectively and make a decision
3314.78s: about how to essentially approach it. And I think that there's a lot of value in that. But yeah,
3319.58s: it seems like normally for me in those scenarios, I kind of just bail on that overall idea and I
3327.26s: move on to something else. But I mean with something as big as the broad market, I could totally get
3331.50s: that. That's awesome that that worked out. That's a tough move to make. Yeah, at this point I would
3335.66s: rather like I've seen so many people lose tons of money betting against things. And at this point,
3344.06s: I would rather have no position in something than short it. It's funny.
3347.58s: Especially like an uncapped upside short like shorting futures where you keep losing money as
3354.94s: it continues to go up. If I'm going to short something, I'm going to buy puts because then if I'm
3358.94s: wrong, I only lose the premium I paid for the puts. And as the as the asset continues to increase,
3365.34s: I lose less and less because my put options are basically just losing all their value becoming
3370.70s: close to worthless. And then I at a certain point I stopped losing money versus like a static stock
3376.22s: short or a futures short where like as it continues to go up, you lose the same amount every
3381.82s: dollar it goes up. So that's actually the beauty I think of options is that if you're going to short
3388.22s: something, I would much prefer to use put options. But of course, they're outposing cons because if
3393.26s: you buy put options, you're putting a time limit on it. And if it goes sideways, then you're going
3400.30s: to lose money on the puts versus if you short something and it goes sideways, you're not going to
3404.06s: make anything as much money. So I mean, there's obviously tradeoffs, but I would rather
3408.30s: not have uncapped upside risk for an asset continuing to increase against me if I'm shorting it.
3414.62s: Yeah. And for that, I would much rather use a long put to
3418.38s: I totally agree with that because the other thing is just the the cost to carry. If you short stock
3424.22s: outright a lot of place will, you know, you have some sort of daily interest that you have.
3427.58s: Yeah, yeah. So yeah, to me that it generally is a no brainer to
3433.66s: typically use derivatives for those sorts of things. So moving on to the next topic, I think that
3442.14s: this is one that your audience was interested in discussing, which is kind of the idea of
3449.02s: growing a small trading account. So for me, I've actually I did a study on my YouTube channel called
3457.02s: SmallStacks, where I literally did exactly that. I partitioned off a $5,000 account and I just
3462.86s: traded it essentially how I would if I was starting with that now. And one of the common themes
3469.18s: throughout that conversation is realistically speaking, if I were to like truly have $5,000
3476.86s: and want to grow that, the first thing I said in all the SmallStacks videos was I wouldn't trade it.
3483.26s: I would simply just put it in some sort of interest bearing account, even if it's a CD earning
3489.18s: something, trying to combat inflation like we were talking about earlier and then paper trading
3493.50s: in the meantime, because while I was going through that study, one of the things I kept saying every
3498.22s: time I took a trade is like, well, I don't have enough money to afford this and I don't want to be
3503.82s: too directional because of, you know, X, Y or Z. And long story short, every single time I was putting
3509.26s: on a trade, it was a series of compromises, no matter what. Now I buy this one product, I, you know,
3515.50s: I like to do cash-secured puts, which is really difficult, you know, with a small account and really
3522.38s: the purpose of trading that way in a small account is if you're directionally wrong and you're
3526.38s: trading a cash-secure put on something that you like, where's the case scenario end up just owning it
3530.94s: and, you know, carrying it going forward. But the downside in a small account is that could be one
3535.82s: product and then you're fucking, you're tapped out. So there's a ton of trade-offs that go with
3541.26s: trading a small account. So for me, my general position is if you have really a small account,
3546.86s: I would consider that pretty much anything less than $10,000, $15,000 is like really small in my
3551.02s: opinion, just to like actively trade. I would either not trade and save or just start buying an
3557.90s: index ETF, you know, VLO, spy, just something like that if you're so inclined. And, you know,
3564.54s: paper trade while you go to learn, but curious what your approach would be.
3569.34s: Yeah, I agree. I think the smaller the account you have, the less flexibility you have, and it's
3576.94s: like way less flexibility. Like if you have $2,000, that's the bare minimum to open a margin account.
3583.10s: And if you put, you basically are limited to low-price stocks because you need to be trading
3588.94s: strategies that have low-loss potential or small-loss potential. But if you're, you know,
3595.18s: if you're lost potential on a trade is $200, that's not a large, but it's like a, it's a very small max
3603.42s: loss for an option position to have. And even at $200, that's 10% of your account. And if you're
3611.58s: talking about a 30 to 60-day play, we're talking about losing 10% of your account in a month or two
3616.70s: months if it goes against you. And so, yeah, like if you just held $2,000 and you deposit $100
3628.38s: a month, you can, then that's a risk-free 5% growth. You know, it's going to be very hard to grow your
3636.38s: trading account at 5% per month, especially as a brand new trader. And so I agree with what you're
3642.94s: saying is if you have a, you have $2,000, it's going to be very difficult. My kind of ballpark
3647.50s: number is that things start to, you get a lot more flexibility when you get closer to like 10 grand.
3654.86s: But then as you say, like you can't trade actively until you have 25 grand because you need,
3661.26s: you have to get past the pattern day trader rules, which is if you have less than $25,000 and you're
3666.62s: trading stocks or options, you can only do so many round-trip trades, like enter an exiting
3673.02s: position. You can only do so many of those in a rolling, I think it's five-day period. And if you go
3678.94s: over that, then basically your account gets put to closing only like 60 to 90 days. And the other
3684.46s: important note on that is it's not even like you don't hit the 25,000 threshold and then you're good.
3690.46s: You have to stay above that. And I think a lot of people make that mistake where they think,
3694.62s: oh, I'm good now I can start doing this and then they find themselves in a bad spot.
3698.30s: Yeah. But overall, it's interesting because like trading a, trading a $20,000 account,
3708.86s: you could trade a very similarly to a $200,000 account. You just, your position scale up,
3714.46s: you just have the same percentage of risk. That is exactly what I talk about a lot actually.
3721.34s: I don't want to make any suggestions, but I don't know if I was trading in a very small account.
3730.46s: I would probably favor longer-term naked option purchases because I'm trying to get out of that
3739.50s: small zone. But at the same time, if you have $2,000, you can't buy a 700-day call option in Tesla
3747.42s: because those are tens of thousands of dollars. So basically you have to trade lower-price stocks.
3754.54s: One thing could be you could allocate a certain percentage of that to two-year leaps in Spy.
3762.46s: So you could buy the 500 or like 550 calls in Spy with 900 days of expiration. I don't even know
3770.06s: what those are trading for. Let's check. But that would be a way, if you're bullish on the stock market
3774.70s: overall, then putting your money into a position like that, just to see January 2024.
3787.58s: You could buy the 815-day call options at the 600 strike price or $600 a piece.
3796.70s: When you do that, one thing I would say is you're not necessarily saying that the stock market is
3806.06s: going to go to 600. But basically between now and let's just say like a few months from now,
3814.54s: if Spy goes from 450 to 500 over the next let's just say 6 to 9 months, like you're going to make money
3826.22s: on those call options. It'll be a much larger percentage return than the percentage increase in Spy.
3836.70s: At the same time, I don't want to recommend that people put a large chunk of their account into
3843.74s: deep out of the money options. But it's funny though, and I think that's why I like these
3848.30s: conversations so much because you could tell how our perspectives on that differ. I really like
3855.10s: your utilization of leverage though. That's what it comes down to. You definitely have a more
3859.74s: directional approach in that sense than I would. But the big difference there is you would benefit
3865.50s: from leverage. I think there's something to be said. That's actually something my mentor always
3870.38s: said. He was funny. He was an older dude. Even when I first started trading and working with him a
3875.02s: lot around 10 years ago, he was always like 50,000. I didn't have the patience for that because I was
3881.42s: literally in high school when I first started. I was just like, the fucking old guy doesn't know
3885.10s: what he's talking about. But then I started to realize why he said that. But one of the things that
3890.46s: he also said very frequently, and I think I've come to realize it more and more over time is just
3896.38s: the purpose and almost necessity of leverage to traders if you want to try to outperform the stock
3903.10s: market. I find it's very, very difficult to do that without the presence of leverage in some
3907.58s: capacity. Otherwise, unless you're really good at picking direction, I'm not. I would probably
3914.30s: start a paid service if I put on a trade to tell everybody to take the opposite side because there's
3918.62s: a pretty good chance that as soon as I enter, it's going to go against me. Yeah, and that's
3924.62s: that's a good point. So like people ask me, one another common question I get is, how do you screen
3929.82s: stocks? And I don't screen stocks. It's like all of my trade ideas, they're at this point in time,
3938.30s: my trade ideas are usually tied to fundamentals, especially like if I'm doing a two-year option
3944.70s: play, then that's because I think there's some fundamental reason for that movement to occur.
3951.90s: So you have to have, you have to have some sort of prediction and a prediction comes from
3957.26s: doing whatever research, whatever realm you're in. If you follow the automotive market,
3963.66s: and then maybe you have an auto-stocks idea or something like that, or if you follow the
3970.54s: debt markets, maybe you have a bond trading idea. But it has to come from somewhere, but I think
3977.34s: the only reason I've had deep conviction in my micro strategy play, it's not like I just picked
3983.18s: micro strategy in a screener and just said like, oh, I'm going to love it. It feels long options
3989.18s: in the stock. It's because my conviction in Bitcoin has stemmed from the last 18 months of spending
3999.42s: most of my days and a lot of my working hours like thinking about it in some capacity and listening
4005.10s: to podcasts constantly. My 80% of my podcast listening is all about Bitcoin. That trade idea
4015.02s: didn't come from just looking at a stock. It came from a deep conviction in this Bitcoin idea,
4021.42s: and that's why I have this position on in my portfolio. But if you don't have a good idea,
4027.42s: you don't necessarily have to try to force anything. If you don't have any good ideas,
4031.66s: then just stick to those static positions, whether that's owning shares of stock or whatever it is.
4039.02s: Yeah. I think there's something to that, especially because I think for a lot of folks,
4045.18s: well, for people who've been trading like you and I, at least for a while now, you start to build
4050.38s: a relationship with different products. It's not just trying to guess direction based on a chart.
4057.26s: And I think that a lot of folks who ask that style question, that's essentially what they're
4063.02s: trying to do is just, you know, how can I pick something that's going to go up? And I think that
4067.82s: you can do technical analysis. You can be a technical analyst. I'm not a TA guy.
4072.22s: Neither am I. I use it. I always say at least to my folks, I use technical analysis
4078.54s: for context. Like just to help me understand the current environment for something. There's a lot
4083.10s: of tools that I do find useful. But at no point in my under the illusion, by my observation of a chart
4089.90s: that I can have any predictive capacity, over where something will go in the future.
4094.78s: Yeah. Just I think that's a very difficult argument to make.
4098.30s: So I feel like I feel like I let my viewers down in that regard too because I feel like they
4103.58s: want me to have a more active outlook and they want me to have more ideas. But at this day,
4109.02s: this day and age, like I see options as a tool. Like if I if I have a specific scenario,
4115.58s: where I think they're valuable to use and I'll use them. But if not, then I won't use them.
4120.54s: And I'll just I think, but I think that that just goes to show again, like just a certain level
4126.14s: of authenticity because I feel like I literally feel the same exact thing. A lot of folks will say,
4130.78s: well, what do you think about X, Y, or Z? And I might have an opinion on like the company itself
4137.18s: or whatever, but I could always tell that generally they're trying to see like, do you think it's
4142.06s: going to go up or go down? And my answer is literally the same thing my mentor always told me,
4146.94s: which is nobody knows, literally nobody knows. So I agree with you though, because I feel like a lot
4153.98s: of folks, they enjoy that kind of content because it's it's almost like when a fighter predicts their
4159.10s: fight, like there's just a certain amount of confidence that goes into that that people find,
4164.38s: I think alluring, but I do think it would be a bit disingenuous at least because I mean,
4171.82s: especially with the stock market and how fickle things are, it's very, very difficult. Like we
4177.10s: were just talking about before the studies that I that I've been reviewing and I'm starting to do
4180.54s: myself, it's just very difficult for people to predict direction. And we know that favorably.
4186.46s: Some people convey it with a ton of conviction, even in the study that I'm doing now, I'll ask folks,
4193.02s: in the Google form, like how confident they are. And some folks literally go all the way up as
4197.58s: high as I have on the confidence scale, like supremely confident. And it exists. Some people are very,
4203.82s: very convicted. But you bring in another really good point, something that you brought up earlier
4210.14s: in our discussion is just the utility of options and different ways that we can use them. And I think
4215.50s: something that one of or some of your folks have expressed interest in the discussion on it's just,
4221.10s: you know, ways to hedge a portfolio with options. And I actually find that to be a really fun
4227.42s: conversation because I think for me, I very rarely have a lot of long stock or just long equity
4234.94s: positions that are outright that I would be wanting to hedge with with derivatives. So when I think
4241.74s: about that question to me, it's like just a really interesting scenario to view from because the vast
4247.90s: majority of my trading is derivatives. And the vast majority of my trading is generally realized
4256.06s: short term. I do have some long term positions. Most of those are super speculative. And I personally
4262.22s: not hedging them. You know what I mean? Like if they work, they work, if they don't, they don't. But
4266.78s: curious to hear your thoughts on hedging a portfolio with options because to me,
4272.30s: a ton of choices available, very, very doable. And there's a lot of ways to go about it.
4277.10s: So the clear choices for me would be using a broad index as kind of the vehicle. So an example,
4287.42s: be like, if you you're trying to hedge against a market decline, you go to spy and you buy the puts
4292.86s: there. But then the discussion of like what expiration and what strike you buy, like, there's an
4299.34s: unlimited combo of things and all the pros and cons. The big thing is you want
4306.06s: to buy insurance when you don't need it. Yep. And so like right now, the VIX is at 17, which means
4315.10s: things aren't too expensive. But if you, if you don't buy insurance now in the form of spy puts,
4321.66s: and then let's say the market starts declining and now the VIX is at 25, if you are trying to buy
4327.74s: spy puts when the VIX is at 25, you're going to pay way more premium than you would have if you
4333.90s: would have hedged right now at the VIX at 17. So like an analogy would be you don't want to buy
4342.78s: fire insurance on your house when it's burning down because you're going to pay basically the
4348.22s: total value for house for insurance because it's burning down as we speak. But if it's fine,
4354.94s: everything's good, then you can buy a fire insurance policy and you're going to pay significantly
4360.94s: less than the value of your home. Yeah. Hopefully nothing happens. But you buy it when you don't
4365.74s: need it because that's when it's cheapest. So in terms of hedging, it gets really expensive if
4371.02s: you're trying to add the hedge when things start to move against you. You have to put them in place
4378.46s: before anything bad happens and accept them as a cost of doing good. Yeah. Second thing is like,
4383.02s: if you have a perpetual hedge, that's, I don't think that's a good strategy because it's going to be
4388.54s: expensive regardless. And it's just going to eat into your returns. It's just driving. If you
4392.86s: have, if you need a perpetual hedge and you probably should just have lower position size overall.
4397.90s: I think that that right there is exactly what my mentor always hit on was in general, like for me,
4404.06s: the only time I hedge like no shit is if I have a big futures position on that if it goes wrong,
4409.82s: it literally will blow me up. And in those scenarios, I always have some sort of hedge on and just
4415.50s: accept the cost. But that's exactly what you always said. The primary hedge is risk management.
4420.62s: And what do you means by that is exactly what you just said, which is controlling how much risk
4424.62s: you offer. Another thing I was going to say, oh, sorry. What was I going to say? Another thing,
4437.58s: I don't know if this is next in line in my thoughts, but another thing is if you have,
4442.94s: if you have a portfolio of let's say 10 positions and two of the positions take up like 70% of the size,
4450.46s: right. Like for example, in my portfolio, in the main one, you know, micro strategy is $170,000.
4460.22s: And the next biggest position is square at 50,000. Right. So I don't need if I'm trying to reduce risk in
4467.82s: my portfolio, I don't need to go out and buy spy puts. I could just go to my biggest portfolio
4473.82s: positions and put on protective positions in the biggest portfolio positions because those are
4478.62s: the ones that have the most risk. Also, if you have a profitable position, for example, if you buy
4486.86s: if you buy shares of stock for $100 and then goes up to 150 over a certain period of time, now you have
4492.54s: a big profit on that stock position. And if you have stock that you're trying to hedge and you have
4497.82s: more than 100 shares, you can do what is called a collar, you can call this collar. So you could buy a put
4504.70s: in short a call. And basically the short call premium in the long put premium can offset so that you
4512.38s: don't have any cost of hedging. So for example, if the stock price is at 150 and you sell the
4519.98s: 160 call and you buy the 140 put for a net creditor like a scratch. So basically the 160 call is trading for
4528.62s: the same amount as the 140 put. You can basically put that protective position on for free. Doesn't add any
4534.86s: risk to your portfolio. It actually reduces it, but you don't have to pay for that protection. But what you
4541.42s: get there is you'll limit your upside on the above 160 and you'll guarantee that you can sell them at 140
4549.34s: and so since you bought the shares for 100 and they're at 150 and then you put on that collar where
4555.66s: the put strike is 140, you're basically guaranteeing that the worst case scenario is that you lock in a
4560.86s: $40 profit in the shares. So that's what Mark Cuban did when he sold broadcast.com to Yahoo, he got paid
4570.14s: in Yahoo shares and he had a lock up period. I think it was six months, but he hired Goldman if
4579.10s: I'm not mistaken and they did a six month collar for him. So since he got paid like a billion
4586.38s: dollars in Yahoo stock and he had to hold it for six months, he wanted to basically lock in that gain.
4592.62s: He didn't want to risk seeing Yahoo stock plummet while he had to hold it and therefore like the
4598.30s: value of his payout just gets decimated. So what he did is he did a collar through that holding
4603.74s: period so that he had some more appreciation potential in the shares, but he also guaranteed a
4609.82s: like a worst case sale price, but he didn't have to pay for that protection because he did a cost
4614.30s: this collar. So that's a really good use case and a really savvy scenario where you can use options
4621.26s: to not speculate or gamble, but you can use it strategically to reuse it. I think he ruined it for
4626.54s: the rest of us though, because a lot of places, if you're in a lock up, a lot of them now specify
4631.74s: that you can't even trade derivatives on it, which is really, yeah. So there's been a couple
4636.94s: endeavors, one of which I was just doing some angel investing for a company and I received shares
4642.70s: for it and like very specifically, they said that can trade the product for expiry of time, can trade
4649.34s: derivatives in the product and they even went so far as to list a handful of very highly correlated
4655.10s: products that you couldn't trade either. Like pretty in time. Next case, you have to find a friend with
4660.78s: a bunch of money to put on the hedge for you. They have to buy the protection for you and someone
4665.98s: else's name. It was like crazy, but I literally, I get a kick out of that Mark Cuban story because I
4671.58s: literally think that because everybody realized that he found a great way to, yep.
4677.90s: The other thing that I would just mention for hedging a portfolio, another thing that I
4683.66s: probably worth mentioning is a lot of times people like to use volatility products themselves.
4689.18s: So a lot of people like to hedge with VIX, a lot of people like to hedge with VXX.
4694.06s: And for me, I think there's a ton of potential issues with that,
4698.86s: depending on the environment, but curious to hear your thoughts on that.
4702.46s: Yeah, we kind of talked about earlier, but if you're looking at VIX options, long-term VIX options
4708.46s: are a no-go because they are tracking... All the VIX expirations are not tracking the same thing.
4714.70s: Each VIX options expirations tracking that corresponding futures contract and the shorter-term
4721.34s: futures contracts are going to be more responsive to changes in the VIX. So if you're trading a,
4727.26s: if you buy calls on like a 180-day VIX option cycle and the market collapses, those calls are
4735.26s: not going to increase nearly as much as a 30-day call option at the same strike would.
4740.54s: And I actually, my project option website, I actually made a graph of this exact scenario,
4747.90s: and I plotted the prices of call options through the 2008 collapse and the long-term call options.
4755.42s: They didn't increase nearly as much as the shorter-term options.
4758.38s: Oh, that's pretty cool. That's a problem there. And then with VXX, as we talked about earlier,
4764.30s: it has that very consistent decay. And so let's say VXX is at 30 and you buy the 30-stripe call
4773.18s: option as a hedge because if VXX is tracking the near-term VIX futures, if the market collapses,
4779.18s: VIX futures go up, VXX goes up. You can look at, you know, what happened in 2020 to see how that
4784.70s: goes. VXX exploded. But the problem is if you buy the 30-stripe call and VXX continues to decay
4793.18s: because there's a period where the market doesn't collapse. And now VXX is at 25.
4798.94s: Now instead of needing like any volatility increase for your call option to be in the money,
4803.98s: now you need a 20% increase in those near-term VIX futures just to get back to your call strike.
4810.86s: Right. So as time goes on and as VXX decays, you need a larger and larger volatility increase
4818.06s: to get back to your call strike or above it because in the case of VXX, it tracks the daily
4824.30s: percentage changes of the near-term VIX futures. And so it's not even just like holding those
4833.66s: futures contracts like the ITO, it's tracking like the daily percentage changes. So the closing
4840.30s: value of VXX compounds based on the daily percentage changes of the futures. So as the dollar value
4846.94s: of VXX gets lower, you need a higher percentage change in the near-term VIX futures for that lower
4853.58s: dollar amount to get back to your call strike. So I don't know if that makes sense, but there's
4858.22s: like a mathematical decay to it. The lower VXX gets relative to your call strike, the higher
4866.46s: the volatility spike needs to be to get back to your call strike or above it. So if you're going to
4872.54s: use VXX to combat that instead of doing a longer-term VXX call like 30 or 60 days, you could do
4880.94s: a much shorter-term call option. So like maybe like a seven-day and then every time they expire,
4887.50s: you can roll that call strike down and re-state it. So that stays closer to the actual
4895.10s: VXX price itself. But again, it's going to be a very costly trade to put on.
4900.30s: And like you said, especially in that's like I always think the dichotomy of hedging where you
4905.58s: don't want to hedge perpetually because it's expensive, but then you also don't want to hedge when
4910.30s: your house is on fire. So it's a bit of a nuanced discussion, I think, when it goes to effective
4916.78s: portfolio hedging, but I think for me it comes down like the most effective ways, just risk management,
4922.86s: in terms of what you're offering the market. It's the most effective. But to your point, I think that
4928.94s: there are some reasonable ways to deal with derivatives for a period of time.
4934.14s: My preferable ways are number one, look at your largest positions and go into those.
4940.14s: And number two, hedging ways that is not costly. So an example would be like my call strategy
4950.38s: in my strategy. If I have those long calls and then the stock price rips higher,
4955.02s: shorting those higher strike calls is a way of hedging because I collect premium into my account.
4959.90s: And basically if I create those risk free spreads, then I take all the risk off the table,
4964.22s: but I'm not paying any money out of my account, get that protection. I'm basically,
4970.14s: collecting premium by creating a spread and it's reducing my overall adult exposure and also
4976.94s: resetting my cost overall. It's reducing the cost of my position because if I pay 10 grand for
4983.34s: that first call option and then later in the stock price is higher, I collect 10 grand to short
4989.10s: a higher strike call. Now I have a risk free position and that's a way to hedge my portfolio risk
4995.26s: because then if both of those options expire worthless, I don't lose anything. Whereas if I
5001.18s: didn't put on that hedge and now the stock price is below my initial long call, well then I lose the
5006.54s: 10 grand. So that's a way of hedging, but it's not like a hedge where I'm buying puts, which is
5012.54s: just a pure expense. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a, and that's one of the fun discussions
5017.74s: about hedging a really options in general. It's just a very fluid environment where you can, like you
5023.10s: said, you can approach positions, you could approach portfolio, you can use correlations. Yeah, I
5027.74s: think that that's a really fun way of looking at it. So we've obviously been chatting for a minute.
5036.30s: There is one other question that I want to make sure that we get to.
5043.26s: And it's just talking about trading in lower implied volatility environments. Like I was
5049.82s: telling you about before, that's something that one of my viewers mentioned that you were talking
5054.62s: about. I'm not exactly sure the context, so I don't want to frame it any other way since it's
5060.46s: your words. But essentially, I would be curious from my perspective, just to understand like
5067.18s: what the fuck they're talking about just in terms of like what's the context behind that? And then also
5072.54s: how do you arrive at that kind of thought process? The context around it is there is,
5080.30s: there is a camp of people who they like high volatility trading. So they like, they like
5087.34s: shorting options when volatility is high because when volatility is high, then you get higher
5094.38s: or more expensive option prices and then you short the more expensive options. And ideally, you see
5100.46s: a decrease in market volatility or the increase in volatility actually allows you to sell options
5107.02s: that are further out of the money. So you're hoping that you don't have swings that exceed those
5111.66s: strike prices. So the thought process is that you're selling more expensive options and therefore
5119.26s: that's good because selling more expensive options is better than selling less expensive options.
5125.34s: And I argue against it because option prices scale with realized volatility. So if you have
5134.30s: if you have a 15-vix and you're shorting options and then you go to a 30-vix and you're shorting
5140.54s: options, you're going to have much more expensive options that you're selling in the 30-vix environment.
5146.70s: But you don't have the same level of realized volatility. If you had the same level of realized
5151.58s: volatility, meaning like the actual fluctuations in the market and you compare to 15 to 30-vix,
5157.74s: then yes, it would be better to short the more expensive options given the same amount of market
5162.54s: volatility. But that's not how it works because realized volatility and implied volatility, aka
5169.42s: option prices, they move and lock step. And there's a chart that I made that was basically a scatter
5175.90s: plot that looked at realized volatility in the S&P and the VIX index. And basically it's like a perfectly
5186.22s: correlated line. It's my favorite chart I've ever made for sure analyzed because it very clearly
5191.82s: shows that as realized volatility goes up. So as the market starts to fluctuate more,
5197.26s: option prices get more expensive because with larger price swings in the underlying asset,
5204.22s: then there's a larger expected potential value for an option because if you have an
5209.82s: at-the-money option with a $5 expected move versus an at-the-money option with a $15 expected move,
5217.34s: that $15 expected move means that at-the-money option has the potential to be worth a lot more
5224.86s: than in the lower volatility scenario. And so the option price is aka implied volatility. They're
5230.54s: the same exact thing. Implied volatility comes from option prices. So like option prices increase
5236.46s: with market volatility. And another thing that the other thing that it comes from is there's a book
5243.74s: I think it's called volatility trading by U1s and Clare, I don't know if I'm saying his name right,
5248.78s: but he basically did an in-depth study that showed selling options in lower implied volatility
5257.10s: environments had a higher expectancy than shorting options in higher and higher volatility environments.
5267.50s: So actually, what's the prices? He showed that the higher the more extreme the volatility gets,
5274.94s: there's actually like negative expectancy. And he, it's not expectancy, but volatility risk premium
5283.26s: is what he's talking about. So basically in like lower volatility environments when the markets are
5287.74s: calm, even though you're selling cheaper options, they had more of an edge that you captured versus
5295.58s: when the market was much more volatile and you were shorting more expensive options. And actually,
5301.34s: like flip negative. So like that's interesting. In the times where you had hyper market volatility
5307.10s: and you shorted options, there was actually like a loss expectancy. I'm you have to read the book
5313.66s: to get numbers because it's been a while since I read it, but that was the gist of it.
5317.42s: And it basically showed that shorting options in lower volatility environments was more profitable
5323.50s: than shorting options in higher volatility environments. The other thing is that we don't have,
5329.58s: we don't have a lot of data on like ultra high volatility market environments because they
5337.58s: typically don't last that long. And so we have much more data in the lower volatility camp as we
5345.50s: that we do in the extreme high volatility. So like VIX above 50, for example. So for just a quick
5353.26s: question for context, when you say low IV versus high IV, like what values are you assigning those?
5361.58s: Low IV, I'm thinking ballpark like 15 VIX. But I would say like less than less than 20. I think
5370.70s: the historical average, I haven't actually looked at it. It's like 17 or 18. Yeah. So like I think the
5376.30s: average is like 19 and the median is like 17 and a half. So yeah, I would say probably like under
5384.22s: 17 and a half, the closer to 15, that would be really low. But then in the high regime, I would say
5393.42s: probably over over 30, 35. Okay. I'm not saying that you can't make money
5400.38s: shorting options in high IV. And I'm not saying it's easy to make money shorting options in low IV.
5406.54s: I'm just saying that it's not like a clear no brain or holy grail answer like some people think it is.
5413.34s: That part I agree with. Yeah. Because I think I think a lot of folks just in general try to come up with
5418.94s: some sort of persistent rule that always applies. And I just think that really exists much in trading.
5425.82s: Yes. Yes. And I think having guiding, I think having guiding.
5432.62s: There's no holy grail. Like you can't say like selling vix above selling options,
5436.70s: vix above 30 is like always a no brainer. Other than selling may go away. You know, that one's wrong.
5441.90s: I'm just kidding. That one always works. But yeah, no, I really do agree with the points that you
5448.22s: raise. I think some of the things that I think about would be just the overstatement of volatility
5456.94s: in how that changes in different volatility levels. I think that's an important integration of
5463.82s: the conversation. And then the other thing that I do think is worth mentioning because I do sell a lot
5469.26s: of premium is just the risk that we're exposed to. Because if you sell implied volatility, well,
5477.74s: really if you sell premium in a low implied volatility environment, one, you have the same
5481.90s: directional risk. But then you also have the now the volatility risk in terms of, you know,
5486.94s: the expansion, herding position. So I think exactly like you said, it really, for me at least,
5493.74s: it's very environment dependent. And I also agree with kind of the range that you give. Because I
5500.62s: do think that once implied volatility in general or volatility in general exceeds a certain level,
5506.38s: it does become a bit more of a crapshoot. And really in the same camp as you, yeah, in the same
5512.14s: camp as you, one of the things that I think a lot of people forsake, they're like, sell premium when
5517.18s: it's high volatility, oh, I'm making all this money, you know, all this money. And the thing that I
5522.06s: always kind of let people know, it's like there's a reason for that because the expected moves are that
5527.58s: much larger at this point in time. So it's not like you're just making more money. And I feel like
5532.94s: a lot of people just feel that way arbitrarily. Getting back to the house example is like you can
5539.10s: make a lot of money selling fire insurance when there's no fires. You just collect the premiums.
5543.90s: That's low IV. Yeah. But then if you, if you're selling the premiums at low IV and then the house
5550.78s: burns down, then you have a big payout and you're, you're on the hook. Right. And so you have to
5555.66s: control the risk. But then on the other hand, like if you're selling fire insurance on a house that's
5562.22s: burning down, like that's, that doesn't seem like a good idea in a lot of cases because basically,
5568.78s: you're betting that you can put out the fire faster than the damages can accrue to the the premium
5575.74s: that you sold that right. That's awesome for you know. So it's, yeah, it's all I'm trying to say is
5582.62s: that there's, it's not a holy grail. It's not like this is better than that. It's option prices
5588.06s: scale with market volatility. Yeah. And just because you're getting higher premiums when selling
5594.14s: your options, doesn't mean that it's a no brainer because you also have larger, larger swings in the
5599.66s: asset. Absolutely. And I like, I literally couldn't agree more with that. And I think a lot of folks,
5606.14s: like we're talking about, they kind of want something that's like simple, concise and always the case.
5612.14s: And unfortunately, other than just buying an index ETF or something like that and coming back in
5617.58s: 20 years, it's all, it's all a crapshoot. Well, I definitely just really enjoy the conversation.
5625.66s: I don't want to take much more of your time. I know that good one. But yeah, I gotta go here soon. I
5630.06s: gotta dinner and wind down. Yeah, for sure, man. So I mean, with love to do, you know, another one
5636.94s: in the future is always I, I think the, the conversations, at least are just really candid. I get a lot of
5643.58s: value out of talking with somebody from a different perspective. That's most of the fun
5648.38s: for me. So yeah, so thanks for hanging out for a bit and definitely looking forward to
5652.22s: connecting again. For sure. Take care, brother. Yeah. Yeah, you too.
