2.32s: what's up everyone welcome back to the
4.40s: outlier podcast I am here with Nick it
8.32s: does say I think it's Alysa down there
10.12s: I'm assuming that is of sorts even
13.32s: though you might you I mean you look
14.88s: beautiful but I you for an Alyssa but uh
18.96s: welcome to the podcast man great to meet
21.32s: you yeah yeah for sure I had
24.12s: a I don't have any my main setup for
28.68s: like all my computers and screens I have
30.28s: no camera so and then I have a laptop
32.84s: but I used to do Quant stuff on it and
35.00s: it literally blew up so now I have to
36.52s: use my wife's stuff fair enough and then
39.32s: I mean at the end of the day if you blow
40.64s: up her stuff it's not yours right just
43.24s: then it's like all right yeah great I
45.72s: mean I mean I paid for it so I guess I
48.32s: guess it wouldn't be that great I have
49.56s: to buy a new one yeah well I like I was
53.04s: telling you right before we started
54.12s: recording and then for anybody watching
56.08s: I don't right now it looks like a little
58.32s: choppy for both of us but I'm recording
60.20s: it to the cloud so I think it'll come
61.44s: through okay the audio sounds great so
63.96s: um if it looks a little choppy don't
65.44s: sweat it it's on our end not ours or not
67.48s: yours but it should be um legible and
71.00s: you should be able to hear us anyways as
73.20s: I was tell right before we start I mean
74.96s: like I said you look great I don't so
76.88s: it's not like people watch this to look
78.76s: at me so I never really think that's a
80.76s: problem anyways but like I was saying
83.52s: right before we started I was introduced
86.04s: to you by a longtime viewer of my
89.04s: channel who I really respect his opinion
92.04s: of people markets those kinds of things
94.36s: because he takes a very scientific and
97.20s: programmatic approach to things and as
98.68s: you were talking about the Quant stuff
100.36s: it obviously immediately made sense to
102.04s: me why he's been keeping his eye on you
104.76s: so I was asking for a recommendations
106.36s: for podcast guests and he threw you up
108.92s: in my Discord he's known as uh dadbod
111.80s: Jelly Belly which you always got to love
115.08s: like a good Discord or it reminds me of
118.60s: like on XO box there's like the the
121.08s: random screen names and stuff it's
122.52s: always the craziest [ __ ] it's like Dad
125.80s: bought Jelly Belly but that's what he
127.92s: goes by so there you go he recommended
130.80s: you and I was super stoked I had a
132.32s: chance to look up some of your
134.08s: background and whatnot and obviously the
135.72s: fact that you started in well I don't
138.40s: know if you started in the UFC obviously
140.12s: you had a little bit of stuff preceding
141.44s: that I think you actually had a very
143.96s: non-traditional approach in that if I'm
146.48s: not mistaken at 13 you had dropped out
149.60s: of school and then you started going
152.68s: down obviously a very different route
154.92s: than a lot of standard people go down so
157.20s: I'm looking forward to dive into that
159.92s: but you have a very nonlinear pattern
163.72s: which is actually very linear for
166.64s: Traders all of us come from these crazy
169.16s: ass backgrounds some of us very very
171.36s: make sense and a bunch of us were just
173.56s: literally a band of Misfits so you had
178.20s: your early experience went to the UFC
180.96s: you were wheeling and dealing out there
182.84s: you fought people I think you fought
184.40s: Islam makev which is fascinating um I
188.80s: think I saw Charles Olivera another
191.44s: pretty big name in the sport I mean like
193.12s: you were definitely out there doing
195.44s: doing the thing and then in the meantime
198.40s: you decided that like some of us you
200.56s: have a a giant nerd inside of you got
203.04s: fascinated by markets so we have a lot
206.88s: to cover taking us back all the way to
209.60s: the beginning I want to focus
211.84s: specifically on the point that you
214.12s: dropped out of school because you
216.48s: mentioned something in another podcast
218.20s: that really stuck with me that I want to
220.20s: linger on for other people which is the
224.04s: way that that impacts our self
226.20s: assessment and the way that we think
228.76s: about ourselves and evaluate ourselves
230.56s: and you've been able to overcome that so
232.92s: yeah talk us through that point when
235.48s: 13-year-old you is like okay I'm done
237.84s: with this and then where did you go from
239.60s: there
241.32s: well what you're saying is not
243.76s: exactly correct it's it's actually
246.00s: opposite so when I was young when I was
248.56s: younger um I grew up in a house that was
251.80s: full of uh not so good people so drug
255.28s: drug lots of drug use lots of alcohol
257.44s: use and uh my stepfather was a evil
260.00s: person essentially and um he sort of
264.00s: dragged on our family and he kind of put
266.40s: my mom in a situation to where she
268.16s: wasn't functioning correctly either
270.52s: and so because of that like I went to
273.56s: school but not that often so really the
276.96s: the first the first 13 years of my life
279.84s: were that I had very little education so
282.44s: I had almost none and then eventually
284.80s: and then eventually what happened is I
287.32s: was taken away from that family and then
289.96s: I was shipped up to live with my father
292.56s: and then now I went from the ghetto into
295.48s: like a middle class neighborhood with my
297.40s: father who's a well adjusted proper
299.24s: business man and so then I had to get it
302.44s: initiated into school with no background
305.44s: really so did I go to school I did but I
307.92s: was abused and my parents didn't care
310.24s: and so so coming up that way it's like I
313.24s: was thrown in to high school with none
316.36s: of the requirements you know what I mean
318.28s: so so so that's the the lack of
320.72s: Education part and then my father put me
323.08s: in school and and then and then I I
325.96s: started to learn everything much faster
328.04s: that way so that's that's how that kind
329.84s: of initially started in the life so so
332.44s: it wasn't so I didn't drop out when I
335.00s: was 13 I that's like when I just really
337.48s: first got into it right okay and then
340.80s: before that's when you went through like
342.04s: the big transition you dropped out of
343.68s: like your previous cycle and then you
345.76s: moved into this new one yep um got it
349.52s: and I mean one of the things that sticks
351.80s: out to you or sticks out to me about you
354.00s: it's very similar to what we find in a
355.96s: lot of military people is just
357.60s: adaptability right like that right there
359.28s: is starting down the path of
361.04s: adaptability so you get into this better
364.00s: environment you start learning and you
366.44s: start building kind of your your Base
368.92s: education and then when do you what do
372.04s: you do after high school what's after
374.28s: that so I I ended up learning the stuff
379.00s: I needed to in high school very fast but
381.64s: I was a very depressed kid so I was very
384.84s: tough because I was used to fighting
386.20s: people my whole life my stepfather um we
388.60s: lived in a very rough neighborhood so I
390.40s: mean I fought all the time so I was a
392.44s: very tough kid but like deep down I was
394.56s: very depressed I was I was I was sad you
397.00s: know I didn't I I I hated myself I you
399.92s: know if I looked in the mirror I didn't
401.24s: see anything I liked because I've just
403.20s: been talked down to my whole life and so
405.84s: my father decided to to initiate me into
409.12s: sports and he started with wrestling and
411.88s: so he put me into wrestling is sort of
414.48s: like a way to for me to you know gain
417.08s: confidence to get in better shape like I
419.16s: wasn't super fat or anything but I I was
421.20s: in terrible shape I was just I was just
422.96s: an like a very sad kid and it turned
426.72s: into an obsession of mine essentially
429.00s: because I started to get really good at
431.20s: it and then I went from being an unknown
434.04s: to being a known I went from nobody
436.04s: caring about me to a lot of people
437.64s: caring about me and that's sort of that
439.92s: initiation into like if I work hard at
442.64s: this skill people will pay attention to
445.24s: me people will like me and it makes me
447.00s: feel better about myself and so I became
450.08s: a a a very good wrestler very quickly so
453.72s: I started very late but by the end of my
456.48s: senior year I was one of the best
457.80s: wrestlers in Minnesota and then I went
459.88s: to the University of Minnesota who had
461.48s: the best wrestling in the country at the
463.56s: time and so that's how I got into
465.92s: college so I essentially got into
467.84s: college to be a wrestler with the idea
470.00s: of like competing in the Olympics later
472.08s: in my life that was kind of the initial
473.92s: why I went to college and then
476.04s: eventually I tried to be a doctor that I
478.08s: was going to go to school to be a doctor
481.36s: but what I just College just I just
485.52s: didn't like it you know like I I didn't
487.52s: fit in um I had a hard time relating to
490.32s: a lot of people there uh the people on
492.28s: the wrestling team I always I was a very
494.24s: good wrestler but I didn't get along
495.92s: with the actual wrestlers on the
497.48s: wrestling team and and it was the first
499.96s: time in my life that I was really on my
501.60s: own again so it's like I was on my own
504.56s: when I was young but then I went and
506.12s: moved with my father and then when I
507.96s: went back to being on my own
510.68s: all this the this realization of
514.32s: everything I had dealt with as a child
516.08s: started to kick in so I had trouble
518.12s: sleeping I had trouble focusing and then
521.00s: my career in wrestling and my college
523.28s: career started to tank rather quickly
526.04s: because I needed to like deal with that
527.60s: kind of mental baggage that I had never
529.40s: really dealt
530.88s: with that's really interesting so that's
535.08s: actually a part of your story I didn't
536.48s: catch in the other podcast that is is
540.88s: really curious to me so how do you get
545.20s: out of that rut you go through this
547.68s: rapid learning phase you start seeing
550.08s: success you start seeing some of the
552.96s: social recognition of your work that's
556.28s: part of the fuel but then you start
559.00s: actually kind of going on this little
560.20s: bit of a decline which you wouldn't
562.48s: expect given what we know about the rest
564.52s: of your trajectory right like bums don't
567.20s: get into the UFC so something happened
569.72s: somewhere between those two points what
571.24s: was
572.20s: it uh it was just pretty much
575.64s: uh just my life just fell apart so
578.84s: essentially like I like I just I really
580.68s: crashed I became very depressed I became
583.32s: very frustrated with my father who had
585.24s: taken care of me for allowing me to go
587.16s: through that even though it really
588.28s: wasn't his fault it was taken away from
589.88s: him but but I got frustrated with him I
591.88s: got frustrated with my family and I sort
594.04s: of just went off the rails for about a
595.68s: year and I it it just I had to learn
599.40s: learn how to deal with it because
601.80s: because really what I did is is when I
603.60s: got to my father I just sort of like
606.24s: pretended that that that the previous
608.64s: life didn't happen and so like like it
611.32s: sounds ridiculous but I really didn't
613.12s: think about it for five years I just I
616.48s: just I just never thought about it I
618.20s: just like I it was it was like I was the
620.64s: released from a prison camp I was just
622.40s: like thank God that's over now I'm going
624.84s: on to the next phace but you can forget
627.92s: about something for so long but it
629.52s: starts to like it's like a shadow behind
631.28s: you it's always it's always there and if
633.44s: you don't take care of it it will start
635.24s: getting into your life so I started to
637.56s: like really struggle sleeping I was
639.24s: having lots of nightmares I started to
641.52s: to people would uh maybe someone would
645.36s: be slightly offensive to me but I would
647.52s: take it overboard like like he was like
650.00s: my stepfather trying to attack me or
651.64s: something you know and so then I would
653.32s: go overboard aggressive to them and it's
655.88s: very hard to have relationships in life
657.68s: when you when when someone says
658.96s: something small and you blow up you know
661.28s: and so essentially my life tanked very
664.40s: badly and about I ended up having to
667.92s: drop out of college and I ended up
670.28s: having to move back in with my father
671.96s: who I was constantly fighting with now
674.44s: and eventually for for whatever reason I
677.56s: had no money I had nothing I decided to
680.08s: try a fight because some guy offered
682.00s: that he would pay me 500 bucks to fight
684.36s: and I needed money and so I went to a
687.16s: bar and the guy gave me 500 bucks and I
689.08s: went out there and I knocked the guy out
690.32s: in like 5 seconds and so it's like he
692.16s: gave me the 500 and I was like okay well
694.80s: maybe we could do that again and I I did
696.80s: that again and again and again I did it
698.32s: five times and then I sort of I sort of
700.92s: had this realization that maybe my
703.92s: wrestling career in my background could
707.16s: could somehow make it so I could take
709.60s: this seriously and I could become a
711.20s: professional at this and it was trying
714.12s: to learn how to fight trying to do the
716.68s: business side that helped me to rebuild
719.24s: bu the relationships with my father that
721.08s: helped me to rebuild my family and and
723.72s: it gave me my personal worth back and
726.32s: then I was able to like deal with all
727.72s: the issues that I hadn't dealt with
729.36s: previously and then one day like I wake
732.40s: up and it's like this is my life like
735.00s: I'm a professional fighter you know like
736.72s: like I didn't plan it it it wasn't this
739.12s: grand plan my grand plan was to wrestle
741.24s: in the Olympics my grand plan was to
742.72s: become a doctor but I just crashed and
745.04s: burned so hard that one day I woke up
747.60s: and I had nothing again and didn't like
749.72s: that feeling and so I had to fix that I
751.96s: just didn't know how and then it
755.00s: probably could have been anything
756.60s: whatever job I picked you know it's just
758.92s: whatever I had focused on I could use
762.20s: that to pull myself out and when you and
764.44s: when you go through a depression like
765.88s: that and when you go through a life like
768.36s: I had and you have to examine it you
771.12s: really learn about yourself more than
772.96s: most people do and in that process of
775.08s: learning about myself the psychology you
777.40s: know like the things that I thought
778.88s: didn't bother me that did you know like
781.32s: it it was it was a great learning and it
783.92s: and it it gave me a base to really
786.92s: expand into fighting and into a business
790.28s: person and it gave me a lot of skills
792.44s: that I don't think a lot of people have
794.84s: definitely yeah I I actually think one
797.20s: of the best things about coming from
799.24s: adversity is the ability to work through
801.44s: it I think one of the
804.52s: largest it's a gift it's a gift in
806.76s: Disguise cuz I didn't probably come from
808.80s: the same background as you but I had a
810.92s: single mom I walk through metal
812.36s: detectors every day I was really bullied
814.96s: at school cuz um I was a minority there
817.60s: so I just look different and yeah it was
820.60s: that that whole thing right just which
822.16s: is funny because is I talk to people in
824.52s: this space so many of us have such a
827.04s: similar story um and but I think the way
831.80s: that you addressed the other component
834.48s: is something to linger on for people
836.16s: because just like a lot of military
838.08s: people when you're going through kind of
839.84s: the early stages of your career you're
842.40s: especially as like Marine officers
843.68s: you're supposed to be um kind of
846.28s: indifferent to everything right so
848.04s: you're not supposed to really show much
850.76s: and the whole idea behind that is to be
852.68s: a good example but much like you that
854.92s: leads to excessive
856.84s: compartmentalization and then you not
859.12s: really addressing things but it sounds
861.16s: like you were able to get to a solid
863.52s: point to start working through some of
865.68s: your background and actually turn it
867.16s: turn those experiences into a strength
868.76s: which is pretty massive I have to say so
872.32s: I have to ask obviously a little bit
874.12s: about your career in the UFC I've always
878.20s: been a hobbyist trainer I started back
880.84s: when I was in college for similar
882.60s: reasons as you and I've I've always
886.16s: enjoyed it a ton I actually had a chance
888.80s: I don't know I'm in San Diego so we have
892.28s: Victory MMA out here who has like Dean
894.56s: lisst who runs their um grappling
897.36s: Department which is super cool but yeah
900.40s: yeah yeah um but yeah so you make this
903.92s: pivot into the UFC talk to me about your
907.52s: UFC career what that's
910.36s: like uh so we could talk about that for
913.84s: hours but I'll disc condense it into
915.76s: like a small thing so
917.92s: so my first initiation into the UFC is
921.76s: um I'm very good at what I do I'm a very
924.12s: good fighter I'm very skilled I train
927.08s: extremely hard and so so the fighting
929.64s: part was never the aspect that I had
931.68s: trouble with so I did really well I I
934.68s: probably won I don't remember the exact
936.32s: but I think I won five in a row which is
938.40s: very rare and then I had a draw and then
942.00s: essentially I got fired because because
944.40s: I wasn't all that exciting and when they
946.44s: put the camera in front of my face I was
948.56s: very nervous so I I had all the fighting
951.84s: skills but I didn't have the
953.92s: presentation skills that are required to
956.16s: be an Entertainer and so
959.40s: so really what held me back in my fight
961.76s: career it has very little to do with my
964.12s: talent as a fighter it was the business
966.16s: side that held me back and I was able to
968.88s: do quite well you know I eventually I
970.52s: was ranked in the top five in the world
972.32s: and I had a fight with Chad Mendes you
974.60s: know if I would have beat him it was a
975.88s: very close fight but if I had if I would
977.48s: have beat him which I didn't but you
979.64s: know that I'm one fight away from a
981.56s: title shot you know but that was as far
984.44s: as I got and so but I made a long career
986.92s: I had I have almost 30 UFC f fights it's
989.32s: a very rare career to have that many
990.92s: fights and I did I did well for myself
994.20s: but the the fighting process
997.96s: involves so much more than just being
1000.40s: good at fighting and when I was younger
1002.84s: I didn't have the skills to interview
1005.44s: well I didn't have the skills because I
1007.52s: mean I come from a you know it's it's
1009.76s: it's it's funny to me and I don't feel
1012.12s: bad for myself but I come from like a
1014.12s: batshit insane life you know what I mean
1016.24s: like like it's like like I went through
1018.04s: a lot of things and when someone puts a
1019.92s: camera in your face and you're like well
1021.64s: what do you think about this it's like
1023.72s: you know like I you don't really want to
1025.72s: know what I think about this you know
1027.28s: what I mean like like like I don't I'm
1030.24s: just trying to survive you know I got
1032.16s: Delta bat hand and I'm just trying to
1034.04s: survive so this is a way for me to make
1036.64s: money and try my best and and stuff like
1039.28s: that so
1041.32s: uh my entire life I have been very good
1044.36s: at the process I've been very
1046.04s: disciplined I've been very good at the
1047.96s: actual Arts but the business side of
1050.40s: life is a little difficult for me I'm
1051.92s: not as personable as some people I have
1054.08s: a hard time with first
1056.32s: um like if I have a reason like here I
1058.88s: have a reason to talk to you like like I
1061.64s: I can be quite open I can be good at at
1063.88s: an interview but if we were to just meet
1066.24s: outside randomly I I'm terrible at that
1069.48s: you'd be like that dude's weird like
1071.64s: like like like if I were just out of bar
1073.24s: and like it was like me and my wife and
1074.72s: you and you're significant other if you
1076.36s: have one like and we're just sitting
1077.72s: there you'd be like that guy is not
1079.12s: social at all you know what I mean like
1080.88s: he's hard he's hard to talk to so I that
1084.00s: first impression in the fight game was
1086.80s: not good and that sort of held me back a
1089.08s: long time and it and it frustrated me
1091.64s: and it actually I actually lost some
1092.96s: fights because of the business side
1094.40s: frustrated me so much that it affected
1096.24s: my training it affected my stuff like
1097.88s: that but but the fighting skills itself
1100.96s: I've always been an exceptionally good
1102.72s: fighter but mixing those two Realms was
1107.16s: difficult for me until the end when I
1108.60s: got much better at it it makes a ton of
1111.56s: sense it's one of those things where I
1113.64s: guess like when a kid originally finds
1116.20s: out that something like wrestling or you
1119.80s: know like WWE wrestling you and you
1121.48s: realize that that kind of like skits
1123.24s: right and it's fake and that's super
1125.04s: crushing I I found a similar experience
1128.12s: when like you realize a big part of
1130.28s: fighting is obviously being a fantastic
1132.44s: fighter but you have to be able to sell
1134.52s: fights and I I always really respected
1138.00s: Mighty Mouse
1139.36s: and I read a lot about his career and
1141.20s: and he I feel like is another really
1142.96s: good example where he was in the UFC and
1145.64s: it seemed almost like they were not
1149.72s: fully respecting what he had done and
1153.88s: yeah it so it's it's it's a bummer right
1156.24s: because part of it is like you really
1157.68s: just want to see who's the just just the
1159.52s: best right like get rid of yeah I mean I
1162.00s: mean it's a it's it's it's it's it's a
1164.16s: bummer in a way but it's a business
1167.56s: right you have to sell the product and
1170.16s: and I and I and and I I'm not bitter
1173.12s: about it right like at some points I
1174.88s: didn't sell the product and so there
1177.56s: there but there were many situations in
1179.32s: my fight career where it's like oh
1182.56s: because a lot of fighting is about
1183.92s: matchups it like like like the top one
1186.76s: guy now might lose to the top 10 you
1189.60s: know what I mean just because they don't
1190.72s: match up well he might the top 10 might
1192.44s: smash him but he will never get there so
1195.44s: he that so like but and and the top one
1197.60s: can smash two three four five six and
1199.60s: make everyone look stupid but those last
1201.88s: four would smash him so it's a lot about
1204.44s: matchups and it was very difficult for
1207.36s: me to find the right matchups at the
1209.28s: right time because it's like it it was a
1212.28s: very dangerous game because they're like
1214.08s: if we put him versus Nick Nick might win
1217.04s: and we don't want that to happen so I
1219.12s: constantly had this like stream of
1221.40s: really hard fights but when I would win
1223.16s: them they didn't get me the credit that
1224.88s: I needed you know and so this I'm not
1227.12s: complaining because I didn't come
1229.00s: equipped to be a superstar I just don't
1231.68s: have the skills to be a superstar but I
1233.80s: am a very good fighter so I I in some
1236.24s: ways I underperformed in that
1238.60s: way right yeah and I mean well obviously
1241.48s: it's also an incredible perspective that
1243.68s: you take on it because it honestly
1245.92s: reminds me of trading where Traders I
1248.48s: find in general they like to find
1250.40s: something to blame the market did this
1252.12s: to me the market maker who by the way
1254.28s: doesn't care at all about you did this
1256.12s: to so you you obviously have
1259.20s: very just removed perspective of it's
1262.16s: very objective you're saying I'm good at
1264.04s: this part this part I needed to work on
1266.64s: and the fact that you can even reconcile
1268.40s: those two like that to me would lend
1271.36s: really well into something like trading
1273.32s: so as you're going through your UFC
1275.36s: career when did you start trading and
1278.28s: how did that come to the
1280.84s: picture so when I was young uh things
1285.40s: like investing saving these are not
1287.92s: things that poor people think about you
1290.12s: know what I mean so it's like it's it's
1291.56s: not something that was a part of my life
1293.40s: so it's something I knew nothing about
1295.12s: you know I didn't know anything about
1296.20s: stock market I didn't even know existed
1298.52s: and so as I was getting older um and I
1302.56s: was never rich but I was starting to
1304.16s: pile up some money and I need to do
1305.88s: something with it right and then that
1307.80s: was right in the time when after the
1309.92s: financial crisis so the GFC happened
1312.32s: right when I got into the UFC and so
1314.96s: like it's like I have a little money I
1316.68s: see everyone else's money evaporating in
1318.84s: the market like I don't want to put it
1321.72s: there you know I mean God I I would be
1324.56s: loaded if I just threw it all in you
1327.28s: know perfect timing yeah but but it but
1332.00s: it but instead I it instilled fear in me
1334.76s: because I saw so many people losing
1336.16s: their money and and I seem to be the
1337.72s: only guy with some money and so then I
1340.08s: thought about like well I could invest
1341.64s: in this and that but there was something
1345.12s: I one of the things I struggle with in
1347.24s: fighting is um
1349.16s: I'm so obsessive and I train so hard
1352.04s: that I overtrain I overwork so I need I
1355.12s: always needed some distraction in my
1357.56s: life and so what would fill that
1359.84s: distraction sometimes is I would be like
1362.16s: competitive in a video game or something
1364.04s: you know like I'd play Starcraft and I
1366.20s: became like very good at Starcraft like
1368.36s: I became a grandmas player in Starcraft
1370.56s: and it's like it's like I'm like ranked
1373.24s: a 100 on this ladder like I'm pretty
1375.72s: good but then like one day I was just
1377.44s: sitting there you know playing Starcraft
1379.44s: for like five six hours straight and I'm
1382.32s: like what is this getting me like it's
1384.48s: getting me nothing like like I mean it
1386.92s: keeps me from training which is good
1388.76s: because I overtrain I get injured I get
1390.68s: sick but like I don't I don't want to
1393.64s: play this freaking game anymore you know
1395.60s: what I mean like I want to do something
1397.20s: that matters and then I just sort of
1399.52s: thought like what what game can I play
1402.52s: that could that could make me money or
1405.08s: or could be beneficial to my family and
1408.04s: so first I thought poker Blackjack
1410.56s: things like this and so I tried it and I
1413.08s: you know I started like a poker stars
1414.72s: account and I did really well I did
1416.28s: really well like like I I was pretty
1418.52s: good at poker and but then I was like no
1420.84s: this isn't it it's just not it and then
1422.84s: I started to think about the stock
1424.24s: market and then I was
1426.56s: like I need to understand this because I
1429.00s: knew nothing about the stock market and
1431.08s: so like I literally put out like a study
1432.96s: schedule for like a year and I dedicated
1436.12s: pretty much eight hours a day every day
1437.80s: for a year to to studying stocks to
1440.60s: studying how markets work to studying
1443.08s: bonds and at first I was just a complete
1445.68s: idiot you know what I mean I like I
1447.68s: remember very clearly I'd read these
1449.28s: books and they would talk about
1450.44s: investing and they're talking about like
1453.12s: that you got to have this much of your
1454.60s: portfolio in bonds and I'm trying to do
1457.16s: the math and I'm like this makes no
1459.04s: sense you can't make 7% here and then
1462.52s: have this bond that pays nothing and get
1465.60s: to 15% and I'm like I'm like sitting
1467.72s: there like screaming at the books like
1469.56s: this makes no sense not realizing
1471.68s: they're just old and they're not in you
1473.76s: know we're not in a zerp atmosphere so
1476.08s: so it took a while but after I did that
1478.36s: for about a year I decided to start a
1480.52s: trading account and um thankfully when I
1483.64s: started trading I did really well I did
1487.04s: really well and so like I kind of got
1489.56s: hooked in it and I started studying more
1491.76s: and more and more and more and it just
1494.72s: it just led to like a lifelong passion
1496.72s: of a game I can play that can actually
1499.44s: do something valuable in my
1501.64s: life yeah that's absolutely awesome it's
1505.52s: it's reminiscent I think for a lot of us
1508.36s: but your angle on it is actually quite
1510.84s: unique in the sense of the original
1512.92s: intent which was to find something you
1515.36s: could kind of pour some of that
1516.96s: obsessive personality into to save some
1519.32s: of your other um craft that you were
1521.96s: working on at the time that's very
1523.56s: interesting because like you and like a
1527.96s: lot of Traders I know I also have a
1530.84s: highly obsessive personality except I
1534.20s: was introduced to the markets funny when
1536.56s: you were talking about like poor people
1538.20s: aren't really thinking about investing
1539.92s: or trading cuz I didn't know what it was
1542.72s: and I had a high school teacher that saw
1545.16s: that I was working a lot and he was just
1547.08s: like what are you doing with your money
1548.08s: I was like oh I'm saving it like that's
1549.20s: all I know what to do and he introduced
1550.96s: me to the stock market he was like you
1552.56s: should learn about investing go to the
1554.00s: library long story short that dude
1556.56s: changed my life because
1558.80s: he introduced me to something I didn't
1560.28s: know about early enough that it made a
1563.28s: massive impact on the rest of the
1564.84s: trajectory of my life now you came into
1568.64s: it not so much looking at it directly
1572.44s: from the perspective of I need to make a
1575.48s: lot of money doing this obviously that's
1577.04s: part of it but it sounded like a big
1580.36s: part of it also was I need another way
1582.92s: to direct some of this energy away from
1586.16s: this other thing I'm highly obsessive
1588.08s: about
1589.24s: which leads me to my f on question how
1591.76s: did you find symbiosis between the two
1594.48s: because at least for me I become
1597.04s: slightly myopic when I'm in like my
1599.56s: obsessive modes and I can't really
1602.96s: function in other things other than that
1604.84s: thing I'm obsessed on but you're doing
1606.44s: like two very skilled things
1609.16s: simultaneously how did you find a
1610.76s: balance
1612.40s: there
1614.40s: um I I I don't know how to describe it
1617.48s: but it's like it's it's like they both
1620.12s: filled the same purpose right like it's
1623.72s: like it's like it's like when it it
1626.60s: might sound weird but but the the work
1629.48s: the study and that it calm it calms me
1631.88s: down it doesn't make me stressed you
1633.68s: know what I mean and and and as an
1635.76s: athlete it's one of the rare situations
1638.76s: like my brain can go forever I have like
1641.36s: a very like I can think I can process
1643.48s: things very quickly for a long time I'm
1645.36s: not going to get tired that way but my
1647.36s: body can't can't compete with that level
1649.80s: of thing so with the fighting you can
1652.24s: only work out hard three or four hours a
1655.68s: day that's it that's Max now I would
1658.88s: work two three three two work out two or
1661.40s: three times a day and then like you have
1663.68s: a warm up yeah then you train hard then
1665.68s: you have a cool down then you got a diet
1667.88s: you got to go eat you know it's a
1669.20s: 24-hour job but that ability to be
1673.96s: distracted in a way that's positive
1676.36s: there are lots of ways to get distracted
1678.20s: as a fighter right women drugs partying
1682.52s: eating all these things you cannot do
1685.32s: because it'll it'll it'll suck the life
1687.00s: out of you right so I needed to stay
1689.60s: engaged and that's why I would go to the
1691.96s: video games but then that that stopped
1693.76s: producing the effort right like then
1695.80s: that it became like boring to me it
1697.52s: wasn't challenging enough it didn't and
1699.40s: it didn't get me anything and so the
1701.68s: market just it it it just sort of
1703.60s: provided that that right thing for me
1707.04s: and and and
1711.88s: I
1712.96s: think I don't look at it as a negative
1716.16s: right but obviously I dealt with a lot
1718.84s: of stuff in my past so
1721.84s: initially the the thought process of
1724.16s: staying busy is to stop myself from
1727.20s: thinking about that you know to like
1729.36s: stay ahead of of the demons that I'm
1731.80s: running from right like I don't feel
1734.36s: good about myself when I think about
1735.92s: that so what do I do I get obsessed
1737.80s: about to work and I I've been able
1740.76s: through the years to to to drop off the
1743.88s: bad feelings I'm not running anymore I
1746.48s: enjoy it but the initially when it
1748.64s: started it was me running from my past
1751.56s: it was me running from the things I
1753.76s: don't want to think about I don't want
1755.68s: to feel insecure I'm good at fighting so
1758.24s: that makes me feel good about myself I
1760.24s: don't want to think about finances
1762.32s: because I grew up so poor I don't want
1763.72s: to be scared about losing it so if I
1765.56s: keep winning fights I don't have to be
1767.16s: scared about money
1768.72s: so like like there was all the that's
1771.08s: initially how it started but I've been
1773.12s: able to just eliminate the bad parts and
1775.16s: keep the good parts as I've gotten older
1777.00s: and
1778.12s: wiser I see yeah and it sounded like you
1781.92s: found like a really good balance between
1784.24s: both of those crafts which is really
1787.28s: impressive I I think that that's kind of
1789.48s: difficult to do so walk me through a
1791.72s: little bit then of your trading career
1794.96s: when what year did you start trading and
1797.64s: what kind kind of things were you trying
1800.04s: in the
1801.44s: beginning well initially right I just
1804.32s: started investing and stuff just trading
1806.44s: like some index funds and stuff like
1808.24s: because that's what the books told me to
1809.40s: do but then one day I was just sitting
1811.48s: there and I was like I want to be a
1813.28s: Trader you know what I mean I want to be
1815.00s: like a hacker version of a Trader you
1816.80s: know like those two things always
1818.16s: appealed to me like that kind of like a
1819.92s: like a computer wizard hacker type thing
1822.36s: and like a day trader like those two
1824.36s: things like were appealing to me so like
1826.04s: that's what I'm going to and so I
1827.56s: studied to do it and I I mix up the year
1831.04s: sometimes but I
1832.76s: believe that where we had the big
1835.08s: Christmas Eve crash was 2017 going into
1839.12s: 18 I might have that backwards or
1840.84s: something but I believe that's what it
1842.64s: was because we kind of were in a bare
1844.04s: market and then we crashed in Christmas
1846.88s: Eve and I bought everything I could I
1851.36s: put my entire net worth in right as
1854.16s: January started into the market for
1856.72s: trading and the market did not go down
1859.40s: for months it went straight up and so it
1862.84s: was like holy crap like I'm good at this
1865.84s: thing and I'm not good I just got lucky
1868.32s: right I'm not good at all like I'm
1869.76s: terrible I have no idea what I'm doing
1871.92s: and so then it was
1873.48s: stocks so I started trading stocks and I
1876.08s: did I did quite well but I wanted to
1879.88s: like learn about how the world works and
1883.08s: stocks are Terri some people disagree
1885.56s: with me on this but I think stocks are
1888.56s: horrible macro assets they they don't
1890.80s: respond well to macro events it's not a
1894.16s: macro asset a bond is a macro asset a
1896.68s: currency is a macro asset the suur curve
1899.16s: is a macro asset these things adjust and
1902.04s: they make sense when you understand how
1904.44s: the world Works stocks are in their own
1907.04s: world all the time it's a different type
1909.20s: of trading and so I didn't feel like I
1912.52s: had as much of an edge in picking stocks
1915.48s: after I picked the good ones right it's
1917.44s: like it's like oh I I I picked I picked
1919.72s: some good stocks what am I going to do
1920.88s: sell it and buy there's no other good
1922.56s: ones I got the good ones and I'm doing
1924.76s: well but to really increase the alpha
1927.36s: the really to increase the chance at
1930.12s: higher returns I needed to go to other
1932.96s: markets and so I dissected and I and I
1935.56s: started learning about uh well there it
1938.80s: doesn't exist anymore but I started
1939.96s: learning about Euro dollars I started
1941.56s: learning about uh the volatility spreads
1946.04s: I started learning about when it turned
1948.36s: to Sofer Sofer curves and then I started
1950.52s: learning about how to trade bonds and
1952.40s: once I got those things together I was
1955.36s: able to use sort of this puzzle mindset
1959.28s: that I have to really piece together a
1961.12s: better trading system than just trading
1963.60s: stocks whereas stocks are very momentum
1966.68s: driven right they usually go up together
1969.00s: they usually go down together you can
1970.72s: pick the right ones you know you can
1972.16s: kind of adjust it but just to trade
1974.12s: stocks is a very very difficult thing to
1976.28s: do it is very difficult ult to beat S&P
1979.36s: if you're just trading stocks because
1981.28s: S&P is essentially built as a trend
1983.36s: following system so if you're not in the
1985.36s: video this year you're screwed right I
1987.92s: don't own Nvidia and I'm and I got I'm
1990.00s: doing better than SPX this year right
1992.56s: because I just am not involved I just
1994.96s: chose not to be involved and then and
1997.28s: then I don't suffer from the the the the
2000.84s: fomo I don't suffer from the frustration
2003.40s: of missing a stock I I I have a lot of
2006.44s: ways to bet on the thing and then when I
2008.48s: see value in stocks I put it in my
2011.44s: long-term funds so I love looking at I
2014.64s: love breaking down stocks I love
2016.24s: breaking down Finance sheets I love to
2018.36s: find those hidden gems in the stock
2020.40s: market but that's a whole different game
2022.32s: and that's an investing game and I don't
2024.44s: think trading I don't think those two
2026.68s: line up as well at least not for my
2028.60s: personality so that's the that's how I
2030.44s: got there yeah well it makes a ton of
2032.84s: sense and I think a couple things really
2034.80s: stick out that thing you said actually
2036.76s: at the very end there about
2038.28s: personality I think that's actually a
2040.28s: really huge function of creating success
2044.56s: in markets is finding things that do
2046.44s: align with your personality which takes
2048.24s: some time because I I've had a really
2051.24s: interesting view of my trading career
2053.44s: because I started back when I was in
2054.84s: high school when I was in two
2056.80s: 2007 and I've seen even from all my
2060.76s: documentation on what I do how much it's
2063.76s: evolved as I change and as my
2066.16s: disposition as just a changes so I I
2069.96s: think that's a really important point
2071.44s: that you shared there about finding
2072.88s: things that align with your
2074.68s: disposition so you were talking about a
2079.40s: little bit of the evolution of how you
2081.48s: tried different things how did you start
2085.88s: realizing that you were finding the
2087.88s: thing that you liked the thing that did
2089.88s: align with your
2092.40s: disposition uh well there's two things
2094.96s: right one you make money if you make
2097.80s: money it seems to make everything feel
2099.64s: better right so if you're making money
2102.08s: it's hard to be upset about it and two
2108.28s: um when I'm in the right trade or I have
2111.36s: like a really idea with like a
2113.08s: fundamental backdrop and then a
2114.88s: technical backdrop and then I do a lot
2116.56s: of quantitative measures when those
2118.08s: three things come together and I put
2121.48s: that trade on I know very well I could
2124.24s: lose this trade but I don't care you
2127.40s: know I mean like I I I don't care like I
2129.64s: really I'm not stressed about it if it
2131.20s: stops me out it stops me out I'm not
2132.64s: stressed about it it's the trades where
2134.76s: you do care about losing that money that
2136.56s: you know you're not really in a good one
2138.40s: you know what I mean and I was finding a
2139.88s: lot of times with stocks that's how it
2141.96s: was I was good at trading stocks I was
2144.36s: good at trading options on stocks but I
2147.48s: always had just this level of stress
2149.72s: that like there that it it it ate me
2152.52s: away and it made my performance worse
2154.88s: and so a lot and especially with timing
2156.88s: stocks when you're trying to time stocks
2159.20s: on like with macro knowledge you're
2161.16s: trying to time stocks that it can go
2163.04s: very badly and so I I had like a stream
2167.04s: where like I had I had a stream where I
2168.56s: made relative to my money it's not a lot
2171.24s: of money relative but to me it was a lot
2172.92s: of money I made a lot of money and then
2176.64s: I started to lose it and I started to
2179.16s: pick stocks and it's like a stock would
2181.08s: just go down for no reason and I'd be
2183.08s: like this makes no sense and like one
2185.40s: time at one point I had 10 trades on
2188.40s: and the market was up and all 10 of my
2191.12s: things were down I seem to own the only
2193.80s: 10 things in the world that were going
2195.28s: down that day you know what I mean and I
2197.72s: in in a matter of weeks I lost so much
2200.48s: money I couldn't believe it like and
2203.56s: everything went up except what I owned
2205.84s: and then I realiz like you even if
2208.04s: you're great at this that's going to
2210.20s: happen to you you know what I mean it's
2211.60s: gonna happen to you and
2214.20s: so it just that feeling went away when I
2218.84s: felt like I found the right markets and
2220.84s: if I go in a draw down now I'm not too
2222.52s: worried about it because I feel like I
2223.96s: do have an edge and it's quantifiable
2226.12s: and I know that it exists whereas when I
2228.88s: was trading just the stocks itself i i r
2232.44s: i the the the luck wave seemed a lot
2235.68s: more present and so that's how I got
2238.04s: into the markets that I that I feel like
2240.16s: good as far as money goes I made a lot
2242.72s: of money with the stocks but the feeling
2245.56s: just wasn't that good and I felt like
2248.64s: I could lose it and I went through that
2250.64s: that that short-term stream Where where
2252.56s: I made a ton of money and then I lost
2254.32s: you know 75% of it in a couple weeks it
2256.76s: was like holy crap like that's I I mean
2260.68s: in the grand scheme of things I made 25%
2262.68s: more money so I'm still doing pretty
2264.24s: good but like that losing that money
2266.36s: hurt so bad that like I was like I
2268.84s: cannot trade like this and so I had to
2270.88s: find a better method and then once I
2272.60s: found the method that I liked now if I
2274.92s: win or lose money it doesn't affect me
2276.88s: as much
2279.52s: I think the other important Point you're
2282.40s: talking about there though is the
2284.08s: process of building something you
2285.96s: believe in and I think a lot of traders
2290.16s: that I talk to on on that kind of level
2292.64s: it's it's honestly it's uncanny
2295.60s: listening to you talk and just how many
2297.36s: parallels there are and one of the
2300.56s: things that I want to draw from what you
2301.96s: were just talking about is this process
2304.84s: of kind of testing ideas and then
2307.72s: finding things that you are comfortable
2309.44s: with because markets no matter what are
2311.96s: going to experience what we would call
2313.76s: Path they're they're path features and
2316.16s: they will go through phases of exactly
2318.52s: what you're experiencing and if you
2320.88s: don't have something that you really
2322.60s: believe in it's so easy to say oh this
2324.96s: doesn't work I need to switch to
2326.20s: something else and then as soon as you
2328.20s: switch what you were doing before starts
2330.04s: working and what you're doing now goes
2331.28s: through a bad path and you go through
2332.72s: this cycle that's pretty brutal now when
2336.16s: you're going through and building the
2338.12s: things obviously you're finding your way
2339.88s: into the segments of the market the
2342.56s: products that make sense to you how are
2344.48s: you devising what you doing in those
2347.64s: products I obviously took a look over
2350.32s: your ex Twitter what whatever bird or
2353.20s: thing I'm supposed to call this platform
2354.88s: now Big Daddy Elon has me super confused
2357.96s: Simple Man um but it obviously is very
2360.64s: clear that you also like to Tinker with
2363.56s: different momentum style strategies I
2365.80s: saw one on there using different moment
2368.08s: uh moving average momentum style trades
2370.24s: against the S&P 500 so walk me through
2372.88s: this process of how you consider
2376.08s: building your
2378.00s: approach okay so initially anytime I
2382.12s: found a market I wanted to know about I
2385.60s: reached out to people that were
2387.32s: exceptionally good at it on Twitter so
2390.40s: if I when I wanted to learn about Euro
2392.12s: dollars and Sofer I found all the best
2395.04s: people at that and I sent them DMS on
2397.08s: Twitter and I asked if they would teach
2398.72s: me and thankfully through this process
2402.12s: and I have a good end because I'm a
2403.60s: professional fighter um people were
2405.72s: willing to help me and when they tell me
2408.04s: hey do these things and then get back to
2410.12s: me and I come back as an expert in
2412.16s: everything they told me about they
2413.72s: they're like oh crap this guy's really
2415.44s: serious and he has the mind to do this
2418.12s: and so I've been able to get four or
2421.36s: five mentors that are exceptional you
2424.48s: know what I mean they these guys are
2426.28s: world class at what they do and so I
2428.80s: have that advantage that that I that I
2431.68s: have great teachers and so that's that's
2434.64s: number one you have to find good mentors
2436.80s: in life you have to find them and if you
2438.96s: don't you you know it's going to be more
2442.00s: difficult for you then the approach like
2445.44s: you said I do I do a mixture of uh
2447.88s: quantitative analysis and and like you
2449.96s: said Trend following right so a lot of
2451.96s: it is price-based I do a lot of I have a
2454.32s: lot of quantitative models that track
2458.32s: a variety of spreads so like asset
2461.40s: spreads versus each other stock spreads
2463.40s: versus each other you know if and very
2465.76s: simple terms you could use something
2468.12s: like es versus small caps right and you
2471.56s: can you can chart that you can see which
2473.60s: ones are outperforming well I do that on
2475.76s: a very more complex level but I use that
2479.48s: as to to to to create the the backdrop I
2482.92s: have like a quantitative scoring system
2485.60s: that tells me which assets
2488.16s: should be
2489.12s: outperforming during certain times and
2492.08s: then I only trade those assets if I have
2497.04s: uh backup so I use seasonality I use
2500.32s: like I said price action I use Trend
2502.52s: following and if the quantitative and
2505.76s: the technicals mix now I will trade that
2509.64s: asset for that period of time and now
2512.20s: I'm looking in a shorter time frame to
2514.36s: trade those markets and so that's that's
2517.36s: that's really how I how I've been able
2519.52s: to to to build that process right so I
2522.40s: have the quantitative part which is much
2525.08s: more complex than anything I could look
2526.84s: at personally I can get the computer to
2528.96s: do it and then I have the technical
2531.20s: analysis aspect more of like a trend
2533.76s: following system that I built it uses a
2536.04s: lot of different things moving averages
2538.04s: fractal measurements of time and stuff
2540.68s: like that but in its most basic sense
2543.40s: it's a trend following so when those
2545.80s: when everything aligns together then I
2548.28s: will trade that asset and I feel like
2550.12s: the wind is at my back and so if I have
2552.68s: a macro reason then to enter the trade
2555.88s: so that's the most uh discretionary idea
2559.16s: like like oh I think this currency go up
2561.16s: because of an election right maybe you
2564.28s: might be right right but if I have the
2566.60s: other backdrops I have it at my back and
2568.88s: then I'm able
2570.20s: to to actually come up with trade things
2573.68s: and when I come up with a trade idea if
2575.96s: it has the Quant ative measurements
2578.84s: behind me then I take the trade and so
2581.76s: that's sort of like how my system works
2584.32s: got it yeah I I kind of refer to that
2587.00s: general idea I call it stacking strength
2589.52s: which is exactly you're kind of
2590.64s: referring to it as like the wind at your
2592.00s: back I think that that's such a great
2594.16s: Point are you trading it looks like from
2598.92s: your again flying bird page X it looks
2603.44s: like mostly Futures is that primarily
2605.84s: the products you're Trading
2608.04s: uh yeah I well I trade Futures and then
2611.28s: I trade the options on either you know
2615.56s: the the ETF equivalent you know like
2618.24s: like so there if the option Market is
2620.52s: liquid you know in in the ETF equivalent
2623.80s: depending on which one I feel is the
2625.72s: better so with the Futures it's like
2628.16s: obviously you're leveraged so if if I if
2631.72s: I if I plan on holding something longer
2633.96s: I might look for an ETF alternative that
2636.28s: way I'm not in you know like that I'm
2638.44s: going to get blasted out for some being
2641.40s: overleveraged but in general I trade the
2643.64s: Futures I like the Futures products I
2646.20s: started with options I used to think
2648.08s: that was better because it's easier to
2649.64s: just if you want to bet $500 in an
2652.00s: option you don't need the stop right you
2653.88s: bet the 500 and then you're good it
2655.88s: either works or it doesn't whereas with
2657.76s: Futures you have to be very technical
2659.16s: you have to pick the stop you have to
2661.08s: pick when you're wrong you're going to
2661.92s: be wrong more often like
2664.96s: but the when you get better at trading
2667.80s: Futures it's like you have more control
2669.92s: I feel like over the the ending process
2672.24s: and you don't have the drag of
2673.64s: optionality of of theta and all that
2675.60s: other kind of stuff so I've really I
2677.64s: really like the futurist markets and I I
2681.32s: pretty much just trade those and I
2683.08s: spread trade them against each other
2685.64s: yeah I figured I I picked up that was
2687.20s: actually going to be the following
2688.04s: question is for the pairish trading but
2689.88s: yeah I could kind of tell based on what
2691.28s: you're saying that you're using spreads
2692.84s: and yeah I think the other beautiful
2695.28s: part about Futures is really it
2696.52s: simplifies things right it's a Delta one
2698.16s: product it still has an expiration
2699.68s: you're still going to deal with Kango so
2701.76s: there still will be drag holding super
2703.44s: long term but it does simplify a lot of
2707.20s: what's going on as compared to options
2709.04s: I'm primarily a derivative Trader so I
2710.76s: trade options and Futures I've I've done
2713.04s: that essentially my entire career but
2715.76s: Futures there's a specific Beauty to
2717.96s: them in that plus I mean a lot of them
2720.72s: are tax advantaged which is also pretty
2722.36s: sick you get Section 1256 so 6040
2726.08s: long-term shortterm capital gains tax
2727.96s: which is pretty dope you were talking
2730.88s: about though about the the periods of
2733.20s: your trading so you are spread trading
2735.52s: which makes a lot of sense especially
2737.12s: using
2737.96s: Futures what are the the typical time
2740.52s: frames that you're looking at for your
2745.16s: positions so it's
2747.36s: either I trade two time frames
2750.36s: essentially right I
2752.96s: trade one to three weeks essentially and
2757.52s: I trade three months to six months
2760.56s: essentially so those are like the two
2762.68s: time frames that I that I like I the
2764.64s: middle ground I'm not so good at you
2766.36s: know 45 days stuff like that I feel I
2768.40s: have a very hard time with that so if I
2770.36s: can push it out six months I'm pretty
2772.56s: good because sometimes I'm early like
2775.08s: I'm I'm always like I have good ideas
2776.88s: but I can be early and then on the the
2779.20s: the shorter time frames if I'm going to
2780.76s: use options if I want to do like if I'm
2783.04s: going to trade an option I'm looking at
2784.68s: 30 days 30 to 40 days out and then but
2787.72s: I'm looking for it to pop within a week
2789.36s: or two you know what I mean like and
2791.24s: then get out and so that's that's really
2793.84s: the time frame sort of that five days
2796.24s: you know if it happens in three great
2798.32s: but sort of that five to 10 trading days
2801.08s: is the short term maybe that can change
2803.40s: to 15 if I'm going to roll or I'm going
2805.04s: to have some futures or something and
2807.04s: then I cut it off completely until we
2809.40s: get over three months after
2811.28s: that got it and I mean even that makes a
2814.80s: ton of sense just in terms of assessing
2816.48s: correl
2817.52s: once you get into those middle grounds
2819.40s: which obviously from your research you
2821.12s: already know this but for everybody else
2822.96s: listening um almost perfectly with the
2825.60s: time frames that that you've selected
2827.44s: those midterm periods the correlations
2829.96s: can behave very strange in there for
2831.72s: various products so you're kind of
2833.68s: trading more persistent correlation and
2836.04s: then
2836.84s: shortterm um which is yeah that that
2840.32s: that's awesome I love that now when
2842.68s: you're looking at the way you manage
2844.48s: your book are you do you have a
2847.12s: preference for the shorter term or kind
2849.52s: of like your longer range time frames
2851.60s: like how do you split what you're doing
2853.28s: between those two
2854.76s: buckets uh I just have separate accounts
2857.12s: for it so it's like and and I do the
2859.32s: measurements every day and whatever is
2861.08s: hitting at the time I go for it so you
2863.24s: know the markets are they seem to go in
2865.68s: patterns right sometimes people are
2867.08s: thinking longer term sometimes they're
2868.92s: they're very hyper sensitive in the high
2871.52s: all times I'm going to be obviously on a
2873.00s: shorter time frame I don't need as much
2875.00s: uh length to get the juice that's
2876.48s: required to make money and so I'm going
2878.80s: to be shorter time frame and then the
2880.68s: longer really it just has to do with the
2882.24s: trade selection and the product you know
2885.04s: what I mean like
2886.68s: like let's say I want to short the I
2889.52s: want to short USD JPY right now right
2892.00s: because I think intervention risk is
2893.56s: high I think seasonality is is in the
2895.56s: right time frame like I have a very
2897.64s: small starter position in that short JPY
2900.04s: right
2901.52s: like the idea that I'm going to be able
2903.80s: to time that to a weak basis while
2906.84s: everyone has been getting stopped out
2908.32s: for years at this point you know trying
2910.56s: to do this trade right like the idea
2913.00s: that I'm going to just walk in and you
2915.28s: know nail it within five days probably
2918.40s: impos you know probably impossible right
2921.52s: I'm gonna be there when the number one
2923.16s: carry trade in the world blows up on in
2925.00s: the week it happens you know minimal
2927.08s: minimal chance right so so so I'm gonna
2930.44s: have to extend that trade I like the
2932.12s: trade but I gave my you know I'm going
2934.24s: to have I have one position that expires
2936.48s: and August and then I have another one
2938.04s: that's going to go you know as we go
2939.72s: into like you know kind of November type
2942.12s: range is what I'm thinking about right
2944.16s: so it's like it's like the August one
2946.40s: it's like I'm hoping they intervene but
2948.84s: it's a small position and if they don't
2950.60s: and if it doesn't crash well then I then
2952.20s: I'll lose and it's fine you know it's a
2953.76s: small amount of money it makes sense as
2955.36s: far as the risk reward and I'm willing
2957.48s: to take it but really the trade itself
2960.52s: is what decides the length right and so
2963.64s: so whatever I'm looking at I I just if
2966.32s: it fits in one of those two time frames
2967.84s: I take it I don't have a preference as
2969.60s: to one or the other the only thing I
2971.56s: have a preference for is if I'm going to
2973.40s: buy a stock like I want that to be years
2977.76s: that I'm going to hold it like if I'm
2979.32s: going to go for individual stocks I want
2981.20s: it needs to have you know uh the PE
2984.16s: needs to be right the cash flow needs to
2985.92s: be right I need to have some kind of
2988.76s: Reason To Own this thing I'm not trying
2991.20s: to trade it because I don't have an edge
2993.52s: in that market and so like I'm really
2995.56s: looking to invest in that and that's
2997.20s: going to go into a long-term account you
2999.12s: know that's going to go in my child's
3000.48s: college fund that's going to go in that
3001.88s: thing and I actually am very good at
3003.64s: those things but those trades don't come
3005.00s: along that often and so like if if every
3007.80s: day you're looking for those trades
3009.08s: you're going to overtrade and so the
3011.00s: macro products give me the the ability
3013.40s: to like really be in the markets every
3015.56s: day yeah yeah and to your point there's
3019.08s: there's a lot of movement in them as
3021.48s: well in terms of the relationships and
3023.28s: kind of what's hitting what's not so
3025.08s: that that makes a lot of sense when you
3028.44s: look at let's say last year last year's
3031.48s: a kind of a well maybe two years ago
3033.68s: would be a better example when you look
3036.12s: at the performance of your approach and
3039.44s: you kind of compare it over like
3043.40s: 2022 and
3046.08s: 2023 when you think when you think about
3048.56s: your general approach how does it fair
3051.28s: in those two different markets and for
3053.00s: everybody listening the reason why I'm
3054.72s: asking those two years specifically is
3056.32s: 20 to the it was a well almost a bare
3058.48s: Market I guess technically it hit TR but
3061.04s: the market landed down like 19 and a
3063.52s: halfish and then 23 it was up almost 24
3068.00s: so what I'm curious about is if you are
3072.00s: completely non-correlated to s smps or
3076.04s: if you have kind of a lead lag
3078.28s: relationship with them depending on how
3079.76s: s smps perform okay
3082.80s: so I hope I don't get lost in kind of
3085.92s: explaining my thought process here but
3087.80s: in
3088.72s: general my goal is to be uncorrelated to
3092.24s: S&P 500 right I have an allocation to
3095.04s: S&P stocks but I want to be uncorrelated
3098.08s: and you can like them or dislike them or
3100.56s: think he made it or not but you know
3102.04s: there's that Rayo type sense that that
3104.72s: the Holy Grail of trading is to have
3107.84s: essentially 10 to 15 uncorrelated asset
3111.96s: streams and then pretty much if you can
3115.32s: do that that's the trick to investing
3117.84s: because you're you're you're they're not
3119.92s: related it's very difficult to do that
3121.72s: it's almost impossible you know I mean
3123.76s: maybe Renaissance has done it but that's
3125.56s: about it and when it comes to like
3128.00s: that's the goal the goal is to have
3129.76s: uncorrelated asset streams that you can
3131.88s: trade that are not related to each other
3134.08s: and then you can look for the proper
3135.24s: trades because one's not going to screw
3137.48s: the other one and so that's really
3139.60s: that's that's always what I'm looking
3141.08s: for I'm looking for uncorrelated Assets
3143.20s: Now do I find that many no it's very
3145.96s: difficult and they change all the time
3148.00s: you know I mean you can have a certain
3149.28s: astero relationship that's worked for
3150.92s: years and it just falls apart you know
3153.00s: the most basic one is the stock Bond
3155.04s: comparison comparison right that has
3157.36s: totally
3158.64s: shifted from what it used to be now
3161.16s: they're
3161.88s: corelated right if you look at gold and
3165.00s: tips they're 70% correlated right now
3168.28s: that makes zero sense there's no reason
3170.84s: that real yields and gold should be you
3172.80s: know performing at the same thing that
3174.84s: it doesn't make any sense right you have
3176.96s: one that's a negative yielding asset you
3178.72s: have one that's paying you to own it
3180.88s: those things should not be the same
3182.72s: price but they are so you can either
3186.36s: fade that or go with it but I'm looking
3189.52s: for those asset streams to put into a
3191.88s: model that can tell me when's a good
3193.92s: time to own it and when not and then I
3195.84s: can figure out trades with that idea so
3198.96s: the the entire idea of everything I do
3201.92s: is to find uncorrelated asset streams
3204.68s: it's just an incredibly difficult
3206.16s: process to do and so do I have I
3209.08s: succeeded yeah I have succeeded but but
3211.92s: I'm certainly far from mastering the the
3216.48s: art sure and to your point it's
3218.92s: something that kind of continually
3220.68s: shifts anyway so I think the the way
3223.96s: that you talk about it really it sums it
3227.80s: up really well because I I also like to
3230.80s: Parish trade it's kind of a a slower I
3233.60s: use it almost as like a a smoothing
3237.04s: function of portfolio returns and
3240.52s: sometimes it's not so smoothing because
3242.48s: of that exact thing because I'll have
3244.56s: things that get blown out that I just
3246.64s: don't expect to and it's just kind of
3248.20s: like okay sick love that for me yeah um
3251.68s: yeah and I know that we're uh we're
3253.88s: coming up on time here but I have a
3255.84s: couple last questions for you one of
3258.16s: them is when you look across your
3262.84s: Evolution as a Trader from where you
3264.64s: started to kind of where you're at now
3266.96s: the very first question I want to ask
3269.00s: with respect to that is where do you
3270.68s: want to go next where do you think your
3273.28s: next stage of evolution
3275.80s: is
3277.84s: so the goal is going to sound rather
3281.84s: ridiculous but this is always how I've
3283.56s: op how I've how I've thought about
3286.08s: things when I started
3288.36s: wrestling I started very late it's very
3290.96s: rare for someone in Minnesota to start
3292.64s: wrestling in high school it's almost
3294.20s: unheard of and especially for them to do
3295.96s: good
3296.88s: but when I walked in the wrestling room
3299.48s: for high school I remember very clearly
3301.84s: telling those guys I said I will be the
3304.84s: best wrestler in Minnesota and they
3307.48s: laughed at me like I you know what I
3309.80s: mean they they totally laughed me out of
3311.36s: the room and I went into and then I
3313.48s: proceeded to get my ass kicked by
3315.52s: everyone in that room that day right so
3318.32s: they could prove the point that I don't
3319.72s: belong there well when I finished I was
3322.88s: the best wrestler in Minnesota I was and
3326.40s: when I started fighting they said you
3327.92s: can't drop out of school and start
3329.64s: fighting and make a career out of this
3331.56s: well I did very well right and with
3334.96s: trading I and and investing I feel like
3338.28s: it's the same thing and so I in 10 years
3342.84s: I think I will be one of the best at
3345.12s: this I will be up there I will
3347.84s: understand markets on a level that very
3349.80s: few people do I feel like I will be
3351.76s: successful I don't know where that path
3353.84s: will take me will it take me into an
3355.68s: analyst path path will it take me into a
3357.40s: hedge fund path will it will I just be
3359.16s: trading my own money I have no idea but
3362.40s: every year I have I have exponentially
3365.92s: gotten better I have gotten much better
3368.16s: and so the end goal is to be one of the
3370.72s: best I I plan on being one of the best I
3372.88s: have the capability of doing it I have
3375.08s: the support structure I have the the the
3377.92s: the the backdrop to do it it's just can
3380.84s: I do it can I fail I failed plenty of
3382.92s: times in my life the the the failure is
3385.52s: a real option
3387.08s: and in fighting as I learned uh just
3390.36s: being a good fighter wasn't enough right
3392.16s: A lot of the time so the business side
3395.12s: could be more difficult than I am
3396.56s: expecting but I really do feel like in
3398.40s: 10 years I will be one of the better
3400.60s: traders in the
3402.24s: world when you think about the idea of
3405.52s: being a better Trader what does that
3407.24s: mean to you is that the highest percent
3410.28s: returns is that the best risk adjustment
3412.88s: returns I I I I have many theories on
3416.52s: this you know you could talk about this
3417.96s: stuff all day you know like what what is
3420.68s: Alpha what what like are you just doing
3423.60s: leverage beta is it actually Alpha are
3426.84s: you if you make 100% like are the risk
3430.08s: adjusted returns like are they you know
3432.88s: and at the end of the day I think
3434.44s: trading is about making money and money
3436.20s: is the scoreboard and so if who who if I
3439.84s: can have an exceptional life and and
3443.24s: obviously everything I do is to to
3445.40s: reduce risk
3447.04s: right I don't want the risk and it drags
3449.32s: on the the the portfolio returns
3452.00s: obviously if you have less risk you're
3453.84s: going to make less money but I don't
3456.32s: want to blow up either I have children I
3458.28s: have a family right so so what makes it
3461.92s: the best I it's it's it's an
3464.44s: unquantifiable thing right for me what
3467.96s: will make me the best is I can come in
3469.96s: here every day and I can take care of my
3472.68s: family off of it I can I can we can have
3475.04s: an exceptionally good life and I don't
3477.52s: have to worry about money if we want to
3479.00s: go to a fancy restaurant we can do it if
3480.60s: I want to do this I can do it if I want
3482.36s: to do the things that are required of
3484.08s: life I can do it and so if I'm able to
3487.92s: turn the amount of money I have in now
3489.76s: into that I will be an exceptionally
3491.64s: good Trader so I mean that would be the
3494.00s: scoreboard well do I want to go down in
3496.44s: history and other people knowing that
3498.76s: I'm one of the best Traders I could care
3500.44s: less I could care less if a if a person
3503.32s: has no idea of who I am for the rest of
3505.12s: my life I I did that I was in that realm
3508.80s: and if I could fight in people's
3510.28s: basements and rich people would pay me
3512.44s: to fight in pits like in best of the
3514.28s: best or something I would have done that
3516.28s: over anything right I the the fame or or
3520.20s: or press of trading doesn't appeal to me
3523.00s: the idea that I can take me and the
3526.84s: background I come from and I can sit in
3529.04s: front of a computer and I can make money
3531.28s: that's very appealing to me and I feel
3533.72s: like the knowledge and the wisdom that I
3536.88s: will acquire in that 10-year period will
3539.40s: be noticeable and I will be able to
3541.68s: judge myself based on where I am in that
3544.32s: scale yeah I think it makes a ton of
3546.52s: sense and the reason why I asked that
3548.08s: question is because you you hit on an
3550.56s: important point I actually argue more
3553.16s: often than not that like what quantifies
3555.40s: success as a Trader really is defined by
3558.80s: the trader I really do believe that and
3561.88s: it's because there are different
3564.72s: objectives and different ways to
3566.64s: approach the game to hit those different
3569.52s: objectives and you know one of my
3572.24s: primary goals I I had like very specific
3575.00s: timelines and targets for things because
3577.32s: I knew that I was going to be my mom's
3579.24s: retirement so by the time I was in my
3581.56s: late 20s I needed to be at a spot where
3583.72s: I knew I could start taking care of her
3587.60s: and that was a big part of my trajectory
3590.20s: so you defining it for yourself I I
3592.40s: honestly think is is literally the the
3595.00s: pristine answer
3596.88s: the second question I had for you to
3598.80s: wrap up with is looking back over your
3603.16s: entire learning process so far if you
3606.72s: were to give yourself a piece of advice
3609.12s: starting over again what piece of advice
3611.68s: would you give
3614.96s: yourself
3618.64s: um the time
3621.52s: frame the time frame of what is possible
3624.96s: in the short term is much smaller than
3627.96s: you give it credit for so you come in
3630.84s: with dreams of making so much money you
3632.84s: come in with dreams of of making like
3635.28s: I'm going to make 10% a month or
3637.00s: something you know and you never really
3638.56s: think about the idea that like you would
3640.24s: own all the money in the world if you
3641.72s: could just do that you know you'd be the
3643.16s: rich like like like if you could just
3644.96s: compound 10% every [ __ ] week you know
3647.88s: like like it just it's not realistic
3650.04s: right so on the shorter time frame
3654.24s: relax but on the larger time frame where
3657.16s: we're talking years you you don't
3659.88s: understand what's possible if you just
3661.84s: keep the momentum going and so at the
3665.16s: beginning of my thing my my my my career
3667.44s: was like this and then it was like this
3669.28s: and then it was like this and then it
3670.32s: was like this and then it was like this
3671.48s: and it was like this and then all of a
3673.32s: sudden like you're a couple years in and
3675.00s: you realize that it just kind of looked
3676.64s: like this you know what I mean it kind
3677.92s: of It kind of just went like this right
3679.52s: and if You' have just did that you would
3680.84s: have had a much easier life and things
3682.08s: would have been better right and so in
3684.12s: the grand scale of life that comp
3685.92s: pounding if you do the right things it
3688.32s: feels like a long time but one day two
3691.00s: years five years from now you wake up
3693.00s: and if you did it all right you have a a
3695.52s: [ __ ] ton of money and you have a and and
3697.68s: you have a [ __ ] ton of freedom and
3700.08s: everything just comes together so I
3702.24s: would tell myself relax on the shorter
3705.08s: time frame don't be so stressed about
3707.24s: making money now but don't underestimate
3710.68s: what's possible because great things are
3712.92s: possible if you do the right path and so
3715.36s: just keep on that
3718.08s: trajectory I love that I literally love
3720.72s: that so much I think that's one of the
3723.12s: things actually on my website that I try
3725.20s: to build a visual for people to see that
3727.92s: exact thing you're talking about the
3730.08s: capacity of compounding returns and what
3732.00s: that actually looks like as compared to
3733.68s: highly volatile but very peaky returns
3736.00s: so I mean what what a what a great
3738.12s: message um I got to say man like I
3741.92s: absolutely love chatting with you I love
3743.64s: your disposition towards the world you

3765.36s: hold of you nope that's it perfect well
