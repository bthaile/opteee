16.56s: as i do and stalk people and um you have
19.76s: a lot of really interesting perspectives
21.20s: especially as it comes to kind of like a
22.88s: just macro market discussions and some
26.08s: of the other things that we're just kind
27.04s: of doing a preamble to some of the
28.40s: precious metals
30.40s: topics and things like that so i'm
31.68s: looking forward to diving into those
33.36s: with you for sure
34.72s: but first off welcome to the channel
37.92s: thank you yep second off i would love to
41.20s: start with just a little bit of your
43.52s: background so i saw that you're from
45.20s: what sao paulo
46.88s: yes i was born and raised in brazil i
49.52s: lived in
50.48s: the state of sao paulo for
52.88s: until my age of 20 i guess 19 um then i
57.76s: moved to the west to play tennis in
59.68s: college
61.04s: and then the rest is history i guess
63.28s: i've been here for for some time now
65.68s: yeah man so did you do jiu jitsu while
68.32s: you were there no uh believe it or not i
71.20s: am probably the only brazilian who
73.44s: doesn't know how to do jiu-jitsu or
76.00s: play soccer very well so
78.48s: what yeah so i i um i train a lot at
82.16s: victory mma down here in san diego i'm
84.40s: in san diego and um the grappling coach
87.44s: there is dean lister who spent a lot of
89.28s: time in brazil so he talks about you
91.60s: know just growing up there and whatnot
93.84s: so i had to ask but all right maybe we
96.16s: can convert you into jiu-jitsu you know
98.00s: i'm hopeful i would love to
101.04s: dude it's so fun it's physical chess is
103.20s: what it comes down to right now i'm like
105.64s: 235 pounds like i'm
108.48s: mediocrely strong but i've never felt
111.20s: like such
112.72s: just a wuss compared to like some of
114.88s: these 160 pound dudes that are just so
116.96s: well versed that's why i love jiu jitsu
119.04s: because you could be strong but it's
121.04s: very very mental well i am a huge fan of
124.08s: mma and ufc i'm not going to lie so uh
133.76s: certainly watch it a lot
135.84s: yeah well good jiu-jitsu is a perfect uh
138.40s: entrance into that there's no like face
140.16s: punching and stuff so it's a it's a
142.24s: gentle intro
144.24s: i need that
145.76s: yeah exactly
147.28s: so
148.48s: you came to the us
150.56s: was it was it the u.s for college you
152.48s: said
153.52s: yes so i i moved to uh liberty
155.52s: university um
157.20s: in virginia i was recruited to play
159.52s: tennis in college i played tennis
161.60s: started playing tennis when i was 14 and
163.60s: uh
164.40s: um and then when i was 18 or 19 i was
168.48s: started to move uh or look for
171.28s: universities in the us i knew there was
173.28s: ways of getting scholarships here um to
176.16s: play uh sports and and then perhaps get
179.36s: education uh in a you know cheaper way
182.64s: than in brazil and also learn english
185.36s: and so forth and i was
187.44s: i always loved the american culture and
189.68s: so
190.64s: it was a very easy move um when it comes
193.60s: to that and you know i fell in love with
195.76s: it and i'm still i'm still here
198.40s: yeah that's awesome so
200.16s: talk to me about how you got kind of
202.56s: started in the finance space
204.96s: um
206.48s: it's it's tough to pinpoint exactly when
208.72s: it all started but i think i've always
211.36s: been you know i've always seen money as
213.52s: as a
214.80s: not so much as as a as a glorious way of
217.76s: of showing off people but more as a
219.76s: security and safety
221.52s: um feature of my life given the fact
224.16s: that when i was 13 or 14 maybe at 14 my
228.56s: dad had a his own business he was very
230.72s: successful he did very well
232.80s: uh especially in the 90s and early 2000s
235.84s: and um and then things turned south and
238.64s: uh when eastern south
240.88s: um whereas uh you know i was i was a
243.84s: teenager and uh um it was very difficult
247.04s: to see everything um you know just
249.44s: literally going uh from everything to
251.84s: nothing and so
253.44s: for me i always helped him uh in in many
256.24s: different ways of being very dynamically
258.32s: involved in his business along with my
260.48s: parents and my mom as well and so the
262.88s: entire family had to really get together
265.68s: to uh to go through that pain of of of a
268.72s: downturn economically and financially
270.88s: and so
271.92s: um after that i think i've always been
274.80s: fascinated by
276.24s: uh financial markets and i think in
278.56s: college was really when i started to
280.48s: read a lot about finance and read a lot
283.12s: about the economy and
285.12s: then i started investing my own money
286.96s: and
287.76s: um lost some money and that was part of
290.40s: a lot of experience in that period and
293.52s: started to
295.12s: move forward and and really i mean i
297.76s: remember
298.88s: back in college i was i was just i had
301.36s: very good grades and i was studying for
303.84s: business administration but i was i was
305.92s: really not too focused on college as
308.32s: much as focus on learning about finance
310.64s: and uh i loved it i mean i just think
313.52s: the strategy side of it is is one of the
315.60s: most fascinating things of this industry
318.00s: and uh
318.96s: figuring out the markets is going to be
320.56s: an endless
321.84s: uh learning curve that i think um
325.20s: you know i mean i wake up every day
327.36s: extremely uh fortunate for the job that
329.92s: i have and and always happy to be part
332.48s: of this but then
334.08s: um let's see i think in when i moved to
336.48s: colorado after college
339.12s: i actually met kevin in a tennis court
341.84s: kevin is the cio and founder of crasque
344.48s: capital
345.92s: after working in finance and other
349.28s: as intern in other places i i really
352.96s: started working with him and got most of
354.80s: his principles uh when it comes to
357.36s: approach of investing and
359.60s: learning about quant models which he
362.24s: always used a lot of his proprietary
365.12s: models in order to run uh
367.68s: uh or uh really manage capital
370.72s: and so i began to learn from him and and
374.16s: started to apply the same uh principles
377.20s: in macro and so that is when i started
380.00s: to really um really add value to uh i
383.76s: think to uh to kraskat in and this is
386.64s: this was kind of the beginning of of me
389.12s: going from an analyst to a portfolio
391.20s: manager and then starting sharing some
393.44s: of my research uh to the rest of the
396.08s: world and so
397.52s: um a lot a lot of things a lot of turns
400.24s: in that and you know i'm just telling
401.68s: you the very short story but um there
404.48s: has been a lot that happened in that
406.16s: period but uh
407.76s: now after what 11 years maybe um i've
411.60s: been you know with kevin now working
414.08s: uh pretty uh you know pretty good
416.32s: relationship with him and and now
418.00s: quentin haney as well so the company has
420.24s: grown uh the fund is now we're managing
423.44s: um somewhere close to 300 million
425.76s: dollars uh of capital today so
428.96s: a lot of things have changed since the
430.56s: beginning i mean we went from a 50
432.24s: million
433.12s: uh you know aum to a 300 million aum in
436.64s: the course of three to four years so
439.36s: uh things have gone um a lot of a lot of
442.64s: big changes in my life and i think in
444.64s: the whole companies um you know since
447.12s: the beginning of it i think we've done a
449.12s: lot of changes and so
451.12s: very happy and very proud of it and now
453.68s: as a partner you know my goal is to uh
456.56s: to continue to grow here and and make
458.88s: this uh uh one of the best macro shops
462.24s: in the world that's the whole goal
465.12s: that's awesome man
466.64s: um
467.52s: so i want to talk to you a little bit
469.68s: about crest cap but before that
472.56s: you said something that
474.32s: really really resonated with me because
476.08s: it was i don't know just a a perspective
478.56s: that i've never really thought much
480.40s: about and it you were talking about that
482.56s: you had you know your dad was very
484.16s: successful in business
485.76s: and the economic downturn you know is
489.20s: really where you all went through like
490.88s: this adjustment period
492.64s: and
493.44s: i'm just personally curious about that
495.52s: because i find like most of my circle
498.56s: that i know most of us came from
501.92s: almost an inverse where we started like
504.24s: i had a single mom who was working two
506.80s: jobs trying to keep the lights on
508.40s: essentially so we kind of started from
511.28s: not quite the bottom you know it's not
512.64s: that bad but definitely a more
515.44s: impoverished state i am just very very
518.80s: interested to understand just i don't
520.72s: know
521.92s: what that transition was like for you
524.08s: all when you know your dad had this
525.68s: really successful business and then the
528.48s: out external forces right the market at
530.64s: large started to negatively impact that
532.72s: you were talking about some of those
534.48s: adjustments and whatnot i'm just really
536.16s: curious like uh
537.60s: your thoughts about that time period and
540.00s: how that has fueled the rest of your
542.88s: trajectory in the finance space i know
544.64s: you said it got you interested but you
546.16s: know just again from a personal
547.92s: perspective curious about that cycle in
549.92s: your life
551.04s: well i i think
552.80s: you know first off a wealthy or emerging
556.00s: and wealthy family in brazil would be
558.48s: considered perhaps
560.16s: in international standards more of a
563.04s: middle class especially in the u.s but
565.76s: okay i'm not sure what is worse what's
568.00s: worse is is if it's you starting
570.72s: from zero or starting from something and
573.44s: then going to zero when you were 14 15.
576.72s: i think yeah i haven't done the other
578.88s: side of it so i'm not sure but that was
581.20s: painful for the age and not being
584.00s: really knowing how to how to behave in
585.92s: in such a setup when you're a teenager
588.00s: but for me i think there are there were
590.80s: a lot of lessons that happened back then
593.52s: um number one is the lesson of
596.08s: leveraging up when
598.24s: um when you were against the secular
600.32s: trend so basically well my dad i think
603.04s: there's a lot of lessons and one of the
604.48s: mistakes was
606.00s: he started with a retail business that
607.76s: was doing very well
610.00s: and what um and then basically we
613.04s: started to see chinese um chinese
616.08s: products being imported today to brazil
618.08s: or imported to brazil uh reducing his
620.80s: margins um he didn't see that coming he
623.68s: thought this was going to be as you know
625.28s: kind of a short-term trend and ended up
627.84s: being a secular trend that was the
629.28s: beginning of it and so it completely
631.52s: took him out of business because he
632.88s: couldn't compete with them
634.48s: and at a time when he was leveraging up
636.56s: in the sense of opening uh multiple
639.76s: stores all over brazil um
642.72s: and the beginning he was killing it you
644.48s: know he really was making a ton of money
647.28s: um you know he was buying land in in in
650.64s: different parts of of brazil
652.88s: but then brazil also had a economic
655.52s: downturn
656.88s: and that kind of all caught up together
659.20s: those two secular trends uh along with
662.00s: leveraging up at the wrong time uh
664.16s: completely took him out of business and
665.84s: and put him in a lot of debt at the time
667.60s: and so we went through three to four
669.84s: five years
671.12s: working that out and you know and and
673.36s: that was tough we had to sell all the
675.12s: land that we had we had to sell all the
677.76s: you know the house that we're building
679.20s: we had to stop building and selling it
681.28s: we had nice cars we had to sell
683.20s: everything
684.24s: and go from there to you know driving
686.48s: the worst cars and um and so you know
689.44s: and going from the best schools to the
691.12s: worst schools and being a tennis player
693.36s: where it's a very rich kind of
695.60s: uh sport in brazil uh meaning
698.32s: only wealthy people play in and not
700.72s: being able to afford playing tennis
702.24s: anymore so right over through all that
704.80s: it was it was it was brutal but
706.64s: certainly absolutely necessary and now
708.96s: my dad is doing very well
711.12s: i think i'm doing just fine and and so i
713.52s: guess the rest is history
715.52s: man that's i honestly i think that's
718.80s: worse than like what i grew up with
720.64s: because i think
722.32s: yeah it's true the reason why i think
724.08s: that i did not mean to say what's what's
726.16s: no no no no not at all it just i for my
729.76s: mind i was like really empathizing
732.96s: with that experience because i think the
735.36s: part to me that would make it so
737.20s: devastating is obviously your dad had
740.24s: risked so much even to get to that point
743.60s: and then to have this huge unwinding
746.88s: essentially of all of it like that to me
749.44s: is just
750.80s: that's devastating so i mean i can't
753.68s: i mean
754.56s: and then your dad obviously just kind of
756.08s: bootstrapped it right like he decided
758.16s: like okay we got to make some changes
760.08s: here and we'll get back together and you
761.68s: said he's doing great now it's just
763.76s: that's a really inspirational cycle
766.00s: because that's tough that's one of the
767.28s: biggest issues i think people have with
769.20s: taking risk is that they're scared of
771.76s: that so they don't take the risk but you
774.08s: have somebody like your dad that took
775.44s: the risk
776.56s: got hit along the way but able to turn
778.64s: out of it and you know kind of emerge
780.32s: and like to me that is the true focus of
782.48s: that story that's incredible
784.24s: yeah i mean they always made sure i was
786.16s: in good you know a good education in
788.40s: brazil i always had very good i was
790.80s: always attending good places in terms of
793.68s: uh learning from from different people
795.92s: and that was always um i think a key
799.52s: part of of building up uh
802.08s: you know this foundation to where we are
804.32s: today however
805.84s: um yeah it messes with you
808.32s: especially psychologically and you know
810.96s: it's incredible that you know my parents
814.24s: marriage uh you know went through all
816.48s: that and and yeah they did really got
819.36s: together and things were fine and so
822.00s: but it was not it's so awesome you know
823.84s: it's it was
825.68s: very challenging and you know now it's
828.08s: it's like it's just like putting on a
830.32s: trade that you you're taking on too much
832.64s: leverage and then things
834.32s: don't go the way you expected and you
836.24s: know where do you go
837.52s: so
838.56s: it's tough that's
839.92s: well thank you for sharing like
841.04s: sincerely thank you for sharing that
842.32s: story because it's like that i haven't
844.96s: i've never personally thought about that
847.28s: cycle before so that was actually kind
849.28s: of
850.16s: interesting to explore that a little bit
851.76s: with you and it it really is kind of
854.00s: motivating to hear you know your dad was
855.84s: able to just face the risk got hit by it
859.04s: but then went past it like that's i
861.60s: think just really really cool
863.44s: um
864.56s: so then
865.60s: you you know we fast forward and now
868.88s: you're at um cresca you kind of started
871.76s: there
872.56s: and talk to me about
875.60s: just
876.72s: what crest cat kind of is all about you
878.80s: know we you've referenced more that as
880.88s: kind of a macro focus like i said i had
883.28s: a chance to go through
884.64s: um your sec filings and stuff like that
886.80s: but just for you know the elevator pitch
889.12s: version for everybody else
891.52s: what what are you guys all about well i
894.00s: guess learning lessons from what
896.08s: happened when i was younger i think the
897.76s: biggest goal of the firm has been
899.92s: nailing and figuring out identifying the
902.16s: big secular trends and being in front of
904.64s: them and really trying to capitalize
906.48s: from them as best as we can and so we
908.80s: started from a macro perspective we
910.80s: built build
911.76s: models and different tools in order to
914.32s: help us to get to those views
916.80s: um we are also using a lot of value
920.24s: principles of value investing and and
922.88s: and really figuring out whether the best
925.36s: ways of expressing those views when it
927.28s: comes to what are the companies we
928.72s: should be purchasing and or selling
930.64s: short and so forth um so it's really a
933.76s: mix of global macro with value
936.00s: principles where we use proprietary
938.72s: tools in order to reach to those
941.12s: conclusions and so we also bring
943.60s: expertise when we think it's time to be
946.64s: branching out and and and
949.04s: starting a whole new strategy so
951.20s: precious metals is a great example when
953.20s: 20 2018
956.40s: we we thought this was kind of the the
958.72s: right time to be investing in precious
960.96s: metals and we launched a new strategy
963.36s: and that was the separate manage account
965.52s: of precious metals and and then later on
967.84s: we launched the hedge fund and this was
970.56s: where we bought a partnership with
972.40s: quentin haney a geologist to help us
974.80s: navigate the space and so
976.64s: it's sort of um we do a lot i mean it's
979.52s: it's you know it's like a question we
981.44s: get the most how do you guys do it all
983.44s: you know i mean certainly starts from
985.20s: macro and you know as we
988.16s: it's it's great when you have very
990.00s: unbiased ways of of of
992.88s: validating your thesis and so in a lot
995.60s: of ways
996.48s: i think now the precious metals and the
998.88s: commodities companies now all score
1001.60s: really well in our in our quant models
1003.44s: or fundamental equity models and so now
1006.56s: that that is completely unbiased and
1008.72s: just happens to be the case that i also
1010.48s: am very bullish on tangible assets and
1013.52s: and commodities as a whole and so uh you
1016.80s: know a lot of so basically i think was
1018.80s: the idea was figuring out that the quant
1021.20s: models that cabin was building back in
1023.04s: the days was leading him to macro views
1026.24s: and so we kind of swapped
1028.24s: and started using the macro models to
1030.64s: then confirm those views along with the
1034.00s: the the fundamental equity models and
1036.32s: that really helps and and so
1038.56s: uh we were able to build a very
1040.72s: diversified portfolio uh with a lot of
1043.52s: you know big macro themes and then we
1045.44s: have sub themes within those those big
1048.48s: ideas um and you know our goal is to uh
1052.56s: find out what what are the best ways of
1054.16s: expressing those and that's uh that is
1056.72s: an ongoing conversation on a daily basis
1059.92s: and portfolio is always changing so it's
1062.40s: a lot of fun
1064.24s: yeah yeah so what are some of the like
1067.84s: common products that you
1070.64s: guys like to take a look at
1072.56s: okay so large cap it was when kevin
1075.20s: started so it we're one of the few funds
1077.44s: uh that go back to the 90s and so large
1080.48s: cap is our long-only strategy that was
1082.64s: basically built uh by selecting
1085.44s: companies part of this fundamental
1088.08s: equity model
1089.36s: that scores uh the most liquid companies
1091.92s: all over the globe and we only buy the
1094.72s: ones that scored the best and that rank
1097.12s: change on on a daily basis uh and that
1099.84s: helps us to manage risk okay but that's
1102.00s: one strategy and then in 2000 uh we
1105.44s: launched the long short um and this was
1108.32s: kevin smith at the time was running this
1110.72s: the long short is is you know very few
1113.20s: long shorts go back to 2000 it was
1115.52s: launched back then because he was very
1117.36s: concerned about the equity markets and
1119.60s: he wanted to be
1120.96s: flexible and able to short uh stocks at
1124.00s: that time and then in 2006 most of the
1127.60s: uh
1128.40s: well actually the the equity model was
1130.88s: telling us that we should be short most
1132.96s: of the home builders and some of the
1134.64s: banks in the u.s and so
1136.48s: that opportunistically speaking he was
1139.04s: like well i guess it's a
1141.20s: maybe a great time to be launching a
1142.80s: global macro fund that gives us even
1144.72s: further flexibility to uh now purchase
1147.68s: outside of
1148.96s: equity only instruments we can buy you
1151.84s: know fx we can buy commodities and and
1155.60s: you can really express any of your macro
1157.84s: views in any way you would like to and
1159.68s: so that was the beginning of the global
1161.52s: macro in 2006 and absolutely nailed the
1164.32s: housing bust um and then and then you
1167.60s: know from there uh it did other things
1170.08s: such as um the the oil markets when
1172.72s: things turned south uh or when we had
1174.96s: the commodities will market into 2011 or
1177.68s: 2000 2010 and 2011. um or
1182.00s: uh we've had uh shorts in the chinese
1184.72s: markets back in 2015-16
1187.68s: uh so a lot of themes that played out in
1190.32s: our favor uh since then and then 2018 uh
1193.52s: given the fact that we're so bullish on
1195.36s: precious metals we decided to then
1197.76s: launch a precious metals focus fund and
1200.56s: then by diving into that industry we
1202.72s: figure out as well we thought that the
1204.96s: the best way to be expressing that idea
1207.44s: was to be buying what everyone else is
1210.08s: not buying which is exploration assets
1212.24s: and so the majority of the industry
1215.84s: is really most of the capital is being
1217.76s: sucked into the big miners and so um you
1221.12s: know there's a a lot of issues that we
1223.04s: can get into from a macro perspective of
1225.52s: why we think the exploration assets are
1227.76s: going to be outperforming the entire
1229.92s: industry but that's really a macro trend
1232.64s: that we think you know will play it out
1234.72s: in the following years when it comes to
1236.32s: gold and silver prices uh moving higher
1238.80s: in allowing those companies to do very
1240.80s: well so i think that gives you a sense
1243.20s: of
1243.84s: of how uh we're basically positioned
1246.24s: right now
1247.52s: yeah definitely and yeah i think it's a
1249.36s: great recap i i can tell that you're
1250.96s: pretty familiar with uh running through
1252.56s: that stuff because that's very polished
1254.64s: um
1255.76s: so a following question i have for you
1257.92s: is
1258.80s: you mentioned really really briefly um
1263.12s: some of the you know exploration versus
1265.28s: minor stuff which we'll get into in just
1266.72s: a minute but i'm just generally curious
1268.72s: when you're talking about
1270.32s: all of these different funds what what
1273.04s: kind of time frames do you all like to
1275.04s: play in
1276.64s: uh we have definitely a more of a
1278.24s: long-term time frame in fact the
1280.56s: precious metals fund and the global
1282.08s: macro fund have a lock a partial lock up
1285.20s: for investors where
1286.96s: they can put their money into the funds
1289.28s: and they have one year lock up full lock
1291.68s: up they cannot take their money out
1293.52s: after a year they can take 25
1296.08s: after another they can take another uh
1298.80s: 25
1300.00s: they can take the whole uh and the
1301.44s: entire amount uh
1302.96s: they that they invested initially so
1305.84s: uh we're looking for long-term investors
1307.84s: our goal is to
1309.20s: you know especially this precious metals
1311.60s: uh thesis where we're dealing with more
1313.76s: liquid assets we have to have um
1316.96s: it's it's not just it's the goal is not
1319.60s: just to be big it's to be big with the
1321.52s: bright right type of capital with the
1323.92s: right mentality and mindset so and that
1326.56s: is the difficulty is to find long-term
1328.56s: investors that are willing to take that
1330.72s: back for the next five to ten years all
1333.52s: right and so it will depend i would say
1336.16s: the
1336.88s: most of the big macro themes may take
1339.60s: three to five years to play out but
1341.20s: there's a lot of sub themes within those
1344.16s: ideas uh that may play out in six months
1347.44s: to 12 months and so
1349.20s: um i would say uh the turnover of the
1352.32s: sub themes is much larger than the
1354.56s: turnover of the big themes um so
1357.84s: i think that gives you a sense of yeah
1359.76s: we're going if we get really you know uh
1364.00s: i guess optimistic about that theme or a
1366.40s: certain theme that we think uh will
1368.72s: really play out in the following years i
1370.72s: think you know the whole goal is to be
1372.88s: flexible enough
1374.48s: to launch a whole new strategy and bring
1376.88s: expertise from outside uh to partner
1379.76s: with us and then and then you know
1382.00s: hopefully i think hopefully this will be
1383.76s: a new business model for krasket so i
1385.76s: know we don't want to stop just in in
1388.00s: precious metals we've been doing that
1389.36s: with oil but it's not a separate fund
1392.24s: it's part of global macro and so right
1394.96s: there's a lot more to do here i think
1397.60s: right
1398.56s: um so then just another kind of ground
1402.32s: setting conversation i we obviously
1404.00s: don't have to go super far into detail
1405.52s: but
1406.24s: um i'm curious to understand the
1409.68s: quantitative models just a little bit
1411.60s: more in terms of
1413.20s: how they've been evolving over time and
1416.64s: i asked that question because i feel
1419.04s: like
1419.92s: we're going through different periods in
1421.84s: the markets and you know we were talking
1423.76s: a little bit about this before we
1425.20s: started just where things don't
1426.40s: necessarily behave as we might expect
1428.88s: them to
1429.76s: so i'm just curious about the evolution
1431.92s: of the quantitative models to kind of
1433.68s: cope with that
1434.80s: oh my goodness it's been a crazy
1437.28s: evolution i mean it as far as
1440.00s: you know we've been building models to
1442.08s: try to figure out the inflationary and
1444.16s: you know what is the real reason in the
1446.00s: system or
1447.28s: um or or especially where we are in the
1450.16s: business cycle i think
1451.92s: the correlations change over time and
1454.16s: what is the right
1455.84s: asset
1457.44s: asset uh connection that you need in
1459.76s: order to
1460.80s: uh to perform in this in this
1462.88s: environment so
1464.32s: uh it's been it's been a crazy uh
1466.88s: evolution period um and i would say the
1469.20s: fundamental equity model it's a lot of
1471.68s: back testing it's a lot of back testing
1473.52s: because the majority of the
1476.48s: quant indicators that have worked in the
1478.88s: past most likely will not work in the
1481.04s: future and you have to kind of link your
1484.32s: macro reviews along with the quant views
1486.64s: in other words
1488.16s: what are other times that the biggest
1490.32s: challenge for quant strategies today is
1492.80s: the fact that it's very very difficult
1495.68s: to find data going back to other macro
1497.92s: regimes such as inflationary regimes and
1501.12s: so
1502.08s: looking for company data from the 70s
1504.64s: and 60s good luck there's very very few
1508.00s: uh companies that provide that to you
1510.00s: and so right you know the granularity of
1512.96s: most of quant funds
1514.88s: entering this macro regime change that
1517.36s: we think we're in of inflationary
1519.68s: environment is
1521.36s: is going to be challenging for them as
1522.96s: well so
1524.64s: now i have my guesses of what i think
1527.28s: the factors that are gonna be
1529.28s: most uh useful in this in this setup
1532.40s: which i think it's gonna be
1533.36s: profitability um you know companies with
1536.48s: the cost of capital rising you're gonna
1538.24s: have issues with large balance sheets so
1541.76s: um companies are gonna get squeezed by
1544.16s: wages and salaries uh so by using those
1547.28s: models to search for what are the
1549.12s: companies that can get most squeeze in
1551.20s: in a you know let's say a company using
1554.16s: free cash flow relative to the amount of
1555.84s: employees uh a very thin margin business
1559.12s: that also have uh
1560.96s: issues with cost of capital and more um
1564.64s: i guess more reflective of of of of the
1567.92s: cost of capital in into their balance
1569.84s: sheets and and how much that can
1571.52s: potentially squeeze uh their earnings
1574.08s: and so i think there's a lot of ways to
1576.96s: uh to twist this and and you know we're
1579.76s: very open-minded but it's uh it's not
1582.24s: easy
1583.20s: it does help quite a lot to have models
1585.84s: we're building now
1587.36s: models in regards to exploration assets
1589.76s: and trying to figure out um
1592.24s: how do we how do we reach the ultimate
1594.48s: value of what is in the ground
1596.96s: of of a certain project and so
1600.00s: now empirically there are many ways you
1602.00s: can do that and so
1603.68s: we've been seeking for different forms
1606.24s: of of of when do we reach that peak uh
1610.72s: valuation of an
1612.72s: asset relative to what is uh in terms of
1615.60s: minerals in the ground and so
1618.64s: the the work in there is is endless i'm
1620.96s: not trying to say it's impossible but
1623.04s: you know there's certainly a lot of work
1624.88s: to do and curiosity will always drive
1627.28s: your this this process i guess
1630.56s: yeah and i mean that's it's a fair
1632.24s: statement and it's something i actually
1633.92s: talk a lot about on the channel for
1635.36s: anybody who's an active trader is back
1637.04s: testing and anybody who does it knows
1639.92s: it's
1640.88s: you even getting the data is expensive
1643.68s: and once you have it it can be really
1645.44s: time consuming to parse through so yeah
1647.76s: i i can only imagine you know what you
1650.00s: guys especially the level of detail i'm
1651.84s: sure you go into
1653.36s: trying to get that information just
1654.96s: gonna be such a pain in the ass i do not
1656.80s: envy you
1658.80s: it's it's fun if you like to
1661.36s: if you like to have a view i think it's
1663.20s: important to dive in the best ideas come
1666.16s: from
1667.20s: those those real uh analytical moments
1669.84s: in in in our models and so it's i think
1672.72s: it's very important
1675.12s: yeah and i think that there's also to
1677.04s: you know something to be said about
1679.52s: a lot of traders who've been around for
1681.04s: a while you know start to come across
1683.76s: this phenomenon where like you know
1686.24s: the markets are ever evolving but
1688.88s: there's a lot of things that repeat
1690.80s: themselves over and over and over again
1693.28s: across the market so taking the time to
1695.84s: kind of review some of the you know past
1698.40s: cycles and how the markets have reacted
1700.40s: to that to what we're seeing now i think
1702.48s: there's a lot of value in that which
1703.84s: kind of flows into my next question yeah
1706.72s: sure so um
1708.56s: kind of in the context of previous
1711.44s: market behavior
1712.96s: not necessarily dictating but
1714.80s: potentially informing future market
1716.96s: behavior especially during unprecedented
1719.60s: times at least in recent history or at
1721.68s: seven and a half percent inflation just
1724.32s: i'm curious your perspective on kind of
1726.48s: a broad level market overview of where
1730.32s: the markets are at today
1732.40s: and just your general thoughts on what
1734.64s: they look like throughout the rest of
1735.84s: the year
1736.96s: um
1738.40s: i think it's important to go back and
1740.08s: understand what what is happening with
1742.08s: the u.s especially i think it's the
1744.96s: first time in history that i know of at
1747.12s: least 120 years of history that we're
1749.92s: facing three macro imbalances all at
1752.32s: once
1753.20s: it's
1753.92s: that's the gdp problem that we had back
1755.92s: in the 40s um it's it's the inflationary
1759.04s: environment that we had in the 70s but
1761.12s: it's also the speculative environment
1763.04s: that we had in the late 90s
1764.88s: and the three those three issues are
1768.00s: certainly not only explosive in their
1770.40s: own uh but they also create a lot of
1772.72s: political constraints uh in regards to
1775.68s: what the federal reserve could do
1777.52s: in order to keep
1778.88s: keep a lead on inflation uh at the same
1781.76s: time is not allowing cost of capital to
1784.24s: rise and so
1785.84s: we're not able to
1787.60s: um to have interest rates rising too
1789.68s: much otherwise uh you you you cannot
1792.80s: justify uh the excessive valuations in
1796.56s: risky assets along with
1798.72s: uh the leverage in the system uh but at
1801.60s: the same time you've got an inflation
1803.92s: problem
1805.04s: where copper oil
1807.52s: agricultural commodities could not care
1809.68s: less if interest rates are at two or
1812.16s: three percent
1813.36s: in terms of the fed funds rate
1815.52s: and so
1816.80s: we're seeing uh uh on top of that a
1819.84s: chronic uh period of under investments
1823.44s: in natural resources that have created a
1826.72s: lot of imbalances when it comes to
1828.64s: supply constraints
1830.48s: that cannot be fixed in the short term
1832.80s: so
1833.68s: i think what we're seeing today is one
1836.32s: of the most bullish environments for
1838.80s: owning tangible assets that we've seen
1840.96s: in history and so
1843.20s: what are the big themes here so i think
1845.52s: one of the big themes is inflation is
1847.84s: here to stay
1849.04s: number one number two is if that's right
1852.32s: then you've got to be careful with what
1854.32s: is the leadership of the market gonna
1856.16s: look like when it comes to where most of
1859.04s: capital allocators have parked their
1860.80s: money into which is long duration assets
1863.52s: what does that mean it's mostly
1866.08s: technology related companies along with
1869.20s: fixed income
1870.80s: and so with we've seen most capital
1873.04s: allocators spreading money into
1874.56s: technology and in order to hatch that
1877.20s: risk they bought also a lot of
1879.12s: treasuries and other fixed income like
1881.60s: um uh
1883.12s: junk bonds and and investment grade
1885.44s: bonds and so forth and so most of the
1888.16s: portfolios in the world kind of look
1890.64s: like that technology and bonds and i'm
1894.48s: pretty sure what's going to happen in
1896.08s: the future here or i would say at least
1898.64s: my view is
1899.92s: um is that this macro puzzle is going to
1902.80s: cause a shift of capital allocation into
1906.88s: things that don't have such a long
1908.88s: duration meaning things that actually
1911.44s: make money today like
1914.08s: natural resource industries
1916.16s: where profitability is going to come
1918.08s: back where capital is going to be
1919.60s: chasing um businesses that actually make
1922.88s: a lot of money uh and don't have a lot
1925.12s: of debt and so
1926.96s: natural resource industries is one of
1928.96s: the places where i think most of the
1930.72s: capital is going to chase
1932.40s: um and it's going to be coming out of
1934.56s: the growth
1935.84s: stocks and so you're going to see very
1938.08s: likely the continuation of a
1941.52s: out of growth stocks into value
1944.00s: companies um kind of like what we saw
1946.80s: back in 2021 where
1948.96s: oil and gas companies emps exploration
1952.40s: and production companies had their best
1954.08s: year in 30 years and so
1957.52s: it's going to be a continuation of that
1959.52s: pattern i think um and you can add the
1962.80s: geopolitical problem with inflation uh
1966.40s: which which is the deglobalization
1968.72s: patterns that we're seeing that i think
1970.80s: will continue to
1972.48s: press on this inflationary pressure in
1974.80s: in the system and so
1976.48s: um
1977.84s: i
1978.56s: i don't think this is a bite to dip
1980.56s: environment in equity markets i think
1983.92s: a leadership change um and
1986.96s: with technology being almost 40 percent
1989.68s: of the s b 500 if i'm calling for
1992.64s: outflows of technology and inflows to
1995.36s: let's call it energy at 3.8 percent of
1999.44s: weight of the s b 500 you know you don't
2002.56s: even want me to get started on what's
2004.56s: gold weight or gold miners weight in the
2007.52s: s p there's only one of them you want
2009.76s: and so right you start thinking about
2011.84s: this right i mean global equity markets
2014.16s: at 120 trillion dollars today
2017.12s: if you look at natural resource
2018.80s: industries at about
2020.48s: 10 trillion dollars if you take out
2022.72s: energy it's only three trillion dollars
2025.60s: and so
2026.48s: there is a mismatch here that i think
2029.36s: will create an incredible opportunity
2031.28s: for investors
2032.64s: uh as money flows into um those less of
2036.88s: uh i would say natural resources but
2039.36s: also
2040.56s: more profitable uh business models and
2043.52s: that have been
2044.72s: you know that i think are very unloved
2046.96s: uh especially in in the last five to ten
2050.00s: years and are now in this beginning of
2052.48s: of a move here so
2054.24s: um you know obviously that is all linked
2056.80s: to the underlying tangible asset of each
2059.76s: of those businesses oil companies linked
2062.16s: to the oil prices and so is gold miners
2064.96s: with gold and so
2066.56s: i think we're at the beginning of this
2068.56s: outperformance of commodities relative
2071.12s: to overall equities that are extremely
2073.44s: expensive
2074.56s: and so
2075.52s: you know it's it's buying cheap and
2077.12s: selling expensive i think that's
2079.76s: that will continue to work and so
2082.32s: uh there's you know it's too many i
2084.24s: think there's a lot of ways to to play
2086.08s: this but i you know we we think that
2088.96s: i gave you some examples already i think
2090.88s: agricultural commodities look very
2093.12s: attractive i think there's a risk for
2094.80s: food
2095.76s: a food crisis this is the first time
2097.84s: we're seeing food and energy prices
2100.40s: rising at the same time and it's almost
2102.88s: like the 70s on steroids and so
2105.84s: right
2106.80s: it's it's an a very interesting
2108.40s: environment and central banks have zero
2110.64s: control over this so right
2113.76s: um
2115.04s: i it's not the end of the world i mean
2116.56s: there's a lot of very
2118.96s: uh opportunistic um themes
2122.16s: to capitalize on and i think
2125.04s: you know there's a lot of ways to do it
2128.32s: yeah speaking of that can you talk to me
2130.00s: a little bit about your thought process
2132.72s: on like
2133.68s: the gold exploration
2136.00s: versus you know actually just physical
2138.24s: gold or even the miners for example
2142.08s: well
2142.88s: i think there's a lot of things to
2144.32s: unpack there first of all the industry
2146.96s: is
2148.16s: you know is
2150.00s: is just left for that meaning it's you
2152.56s: know majority of capital has been
2154.32s: chasing the major companies and so
2157.04s: there's about 550 billion dollars of
2159.36s: aggregate market cap for public
2161.44s: companies in the in the gold and silver
2164.08s: space
2165.52s: and uh
2166.56s: uh what you find here is that companies
2168.80s: have been
2169.76s: um under investing in exploration
2172.72s: because of the fact that they have been
2174.32s: called you know they've been bleeding
2176.08s: capital for many many decades and lost
2178.24s: money uh and never made any money and
2181.12s: finally because of that conservatism
2183.20s: coming from management uh we're now
2185.52s: seeing this shift towards um you know
2188.72s: really becoming more profitable and
2190.64s: certainly that is shown in most of the
2193.44s: profitability measurements that you can
2195.68s: look at such as
2197.20s: median for cash flow yield or
2199.84s: aggregate for cash flow yield for the
2201.60s: overall industry
2203.04s: and which are some of the best ones
2205.04s: we've seen in history so there is a an
2207.52s: accumulation of of cash
2210.32s: uh balance uh and position from most of
2213.52s: the majors at a time when they've been
2215.68s: depleting their reserves in order to
2218.16s: generate free cash flow by producing
2220.48s: more
2221.28s: and so the lack of exploration and using
2224.56s: less and less of an exploration budget
2227.04s: um
2228.16s: and and i mean just think about when was
2230.16s: the last time we've seen any of the
2231.60s: majors uh build a whole new project in
2234.80s: precious metals
2236.08s: metals i mean we haven't seen any and so
2239.28s: all those issues are creating a setup
2241.92s: where companies are going to have to be
2243.92s: looking for exploration assets in the
2246.00s: future um
2247.76s: and quick question i'm sorry
2249.76s: no no go ahead
2251.28s: just a quick question on that like if
2253.20s: we're looking out ten years do you think
2255.28s: gold is more or less valuable in 10
2257.60s: years from now
2258.88s: i think it will be a lot more
2261.36s: valuable i the whole reason why you want
2264.48s: to be
2265.44s: in my opinion investing in
2268.72s: smaller micro cap stocks today in the
2272.08s: gold space is what is the risk
2274.96s: of gold being at lower prices 10 years
2277.36s: from now
2278.72s: i you know given the
2280.80s: reckless amount of fiscal and monetary
2283.52s: stimulus worldwide
2285.28s: ending balances in the constraints that
2287.28s: we have in the
2288.88s: in a place where
2290.40s: we do have this debt valuation and
2292.64s: inflation problem
2294.40s: you know where do we go from here so i
2296.40s: think it's going to be very difficult to
2298.24s: fl fight inflationary problems we're
2300.24s: going to have to run inflation
2302.08s: uh rates much higher than we saw in the
2304.64s: last 30 years
2306.16s: with financially repressed environment
2309.20s: of
2310.08s: trying to suppress interest rates as
2311.76s: much as we can at the same time and so
2314.16s: this in my view will create kind of a
2316.72s: supercharged environment for commodities
2319.68s: um it's it's very bullish
2322.16s: and so
2323.04s: i think if you have if you are of the
2325.28s: view that gold and silver
2327.28s: will be more valuable if you start with
2329.28s: gold and
2330.80s: think about what's happening with the
2332.24s: crypto market just just not to digress
2335.36s: but it's all yeah no i'm actually
2336.80s: curious about that yeah yeah so so it's
2338.88s: all linked the crypto market and and the
2341.60s: community of crypto in general is
2344.24s: started with a libertarian movement more
2347.04s: you know probably the biggest we've seen
2348.72s: in history i don't remember any other
2351.44s: one that was as popular as the crypto
2354.40s: uh market where
2356.40s: people were basically saying look i mean
2358.48s: fiat currencies have zero value um you
2361.52s: know and i'm saying mostly from the
2363.20s: bitcoin community that likes to say that
2366.40s: there's no anchor to the dollar there's
2368.96s: no anchor to euro or brazilian real or
2371.68s: the chinese you want and so
2374.24s: what is causing here is the lack of
2376.88s: credibility from central banks where
2379.84s: think about this i mean most of the
2381.76s: central banks in the world the mo the
2383.52s: ones that have the best credibilities
2385.92s: out there are the ones that hold
2388.64s: treasuries of the us u.s treasuries in
2391.52s: other words they basically own debt
2394.64s: right we've been we've went so far
2398.16s: on
2399.12s: going out of
2400.48s: the the gold standard to now giving
2403.20s: credibility to economies that buy debt
2405.76s: from another in data economy and so
2409.20s: at what point do we see such a
2411.28s: libertarian movement
2413.20s: which i think already you know already
2415.28s: crossed the rubicon in terms of that is
2417.60s: starting to pressure central banks
2420.64s: to improve the quality of their
2423.20s: international reserves a currency is
2426.88s: anchored by
2428.32s: the the quality of their international
2430.16s: reserves where today
2432.48s: international reserves are the majority
2434.16s: of that is
2435.44s: mostly on u.s treasuries and other
2437.28s: treasuries of other developed economies
2439.52s: and so at what point do we see
2441.52s: central banks are starting to buy gold
2443.84s: right so i think historically we i don't
2446.96s: think central banks would be buying
2448.64s: bitcoin personally i think bitcoin has
2451.20s: its own uses and demand that we're going
2454.08s: to drive it higher but central banks
2456.88s: probably will buy at least in the next
2459.28s: five to ten years maybe in 30 years
2461.04s: we'll be buying bitcoin or some other
2463.04s: crypto asset but i think in five to ten
2465.76s: years
2466.56s: we'll see gold playing that role again
2469.12s: and if you think that that's going to be
2470.56s: the case
2471.76s: that is really what drives gold let's
2473.92s: say 20 30 40 50 higher if you were of
2477.44s: that view
2478.56s: then what do you think silver is going
2480.72s: to be worth and so you start
2482.88s: extrapolating that domino effect of gold
2486.40s: moving higher and what are the most
2488.48s: leveraged ways
2490.16s: to belong that commodity or that
2492.16s: currency whatever you want
2494.56s: so that's where it started this whole
2496.32s: thing is thing balances drive and this
2499.04s: movement drives the
2500.56s: the need for a credibility uh
2502.80s: improvement from central banks
2505.20s: that would drive assets of things like
2507.68s: gold
2508.40s: silver and other commodities
2510.48s: significantly higher from here at a time
2512.56s: when any central bank needs to suppress
2514.64s: rates
2515.76s: and allow inflation rates to run hotter
2518.96s: than other times historically and so
2523.36s: i think you know and the different ways
2526.08s: to play this you can buy the big miners
2528.80s: that's that's there have consistent you
2530.80s: know consistently shown that they can
2533.04s: produce in a certain level uh uh and
2536.56s: also perhaps even have
2538.64s: very consistent free cash flow uh
2541.12s: profile for for many many
2543.60s: decades in depending on the company um
2547.44s: the issue with this is is that we're
2549.60s: also seeing a rise of energy prices and
2552.32s: a rise of wages and salaries where it's
2554.56s: going to also squeeze the miners you
2556.80s: know there's no way around this and so
2559.20s: in my view
2561.12s: i think that
2562.80s: you want to own
2564.40s: minerals that are in the ground minerals
2566.56s: in the ground have a levered way
2569.20s: not in the sense of debt but in a sense
2571.20s: of leverage to the price and so i think
2573.84s: this is the best way of empirically as
2576.80s: well has been the best way of playing
2579.36s: the bull market for gold and silver so
2582.64s: that is basically what we're doing at a
2584.32s: time when more than any other time in
2585.92s: history we've seen this
2587.60s: chronic under investments from the
2590.16s: majors onto exploration assets and so
2594.32s: i think you know this industry and the
2596.24s: exploration side is is tiny tiny and so
2599.84s: you know the smart capital is capable of
2602.32s: entering that market and and buying
2605.36s: large portions of those businesses you
2607.60s: know large states up to 20
2610.56s: and own the best high quality projects
2612.72s: in the world that can perhaps be
2614.72s: purchased by those big miners in the
2617.12s: future
2618.40s: right right yeah that makes a lot of
2620.32s: sense and it's it's interesting to hear
2622.32s: your perspective i actually echo a lot
2624.32s: of that just i was curious how you were
2626.48s: fitting it in terms of the role of gold
2628.40s: short term and long term because i
2630.72s: personally do question
2633.20s: even the value of gold in
2635.84s: 30 years because
2637.92s: for a long time you know we were using
2639.44s: it in manufacturing for a lot of
2640.80s: different components obviously super
2642.32s: precious but you know everything is
2644.72s: changing especially as you noted in
2646.56s: terms of how most countries are starting
2649.36s: to value their currencies and back their
2651.68s: currencies i mean look at china with
2653.68s: this whole business going on with
2655.44s: ukraine being invaded by russia china's
2658.08s: sitting there saying like hey let's find
2659.76s: a good solution here because china is
2661.92s: holding a ton of our debt
2664.72s: so i can't imagine you know that any
2667.04s: sort of significant escalation in the
2669.20s: war will benefit them at all which leads
2671.20s: me
2671.92s: to my next question which is you know we
2674.00s: have about less than 10 minutes left so
2676.24s: there's two big questions i want to ask
2677.84s: you the first one is talk to me a little
2680.08s: bit about your perspective on
2682.88s: russia invading ukraine as it pertains
2686.00s: to impacting just the economy both in
2689.28s: the u.s and globally
2691.20s: oh well i think first and foremost you
2693.60s: know just looking at i mean you you
2695.36s: you're
2696.16s: uh you come from the military
2697.84s: environment you know uh that spending in
2700.80s: that space has been declining in a
2702.80s: declining rate for many many decades has
2705.04s: been in a secular decline
2706.96s: all the way back to the 60s which is
2710.00s: um you know like it or not like it i
2712.64s: think it when we have geopolitical
2715.52s: tensions
2716.64s: one of the outcomes out of there is the
2719.12s: increase in spending in fiscal and
2721.44s: military spending
2722.96s: and
2723.84s: it's important to know that we're we're
2725.76s: going to probably see that in my view in
2728.08s: developed economies this is happening
2730.32s: across the world germany now just
2732.48s: announced they're going to be increasing
2734.16s: their military budget by about 100
2735.68s: billion dollars 2 percent of gdp right
2738.16s: which is the minimum
2740.00s: to being part of nato and so forth and
2742.56s: so
2743.84s: we're probably going to see this across
2745.28s: the board but what does that mean
2747.84s: to
2748.80s: increase your military spending when you
2751.36s: also have fiscal spending um already at
2754.64s: the levels that we have and i think this
2756.80s: is inevitable you know it's it's uh what
2759.44s: we're going to probably see is the
2760.56s: fiscal imbalance imbalance getting worse
2762.80s: and the fiscal agenda has never been so
2764.88s: extensive you've got peak inequality
2767.76s: happening at the same time you have
2769.44s: geopolitical issues you have the green
2771.68s: revolution um you have this
2774.00s: infrastructure
2775.44s: developments and need in the u.s and so
2778.88s: all that is going to feed into
2781.28s: also the military spending with
2784.08s: the fiscal being big
2786.00s: uh relative to the gdp
2788.48s: where it's going to need further uh
2790.88s: financing from someone to be financing
2793.68s: and purchasing the u.s debt and
2796.40s: after what we've seen so far with russia
2799.12s: in ukraine
2800.48s: i think it's going to be more and more
2802.00s: difficult for us to be funding uh
2805.52s: funding um things in general and so it's
2808.32s: going to create a role for the central
2810.32s: banks of the world to
2812.88s: start financing some of those operations
2815.84s: which just means
2817.20s: you know monetary delusion in general
2819.60s: and so
2820.96s: ultimately i think we're going to go
2822.40s: there um i think this is a big shift
2826.48s: geopolitically speaking uh and showing
2829.28s: how strategic commodities have become
2832.32s: in just the course of three to four
2834.16s: months uh and we've seen this small
2836.64s: history in the past but now more than
2838.80s: any other time
2840.24s: um oil is is such a strategic asset
2843.60s: today to have yep
2845.04s: and and food
2847.04s: you know who you know whoever country
2849.52s: that owns enough agricultural
2851.04s: commodities
2852.32s: um and oil and other uh even you know
2855.84s: copper and some other other things other
2858.56s: minerals that will play into a bigger
2861.36s: role uh in in the future i think uh are
2864.48s: going to be in in good hands and so you
2866.88s: have to think about you know china india
2869.84s: that are not in that position relative
2872.64s: to a place like brazil
2874.96s: um for instance and maybe even the u.s
2877.60s: and canada and so
2879.28s: um i think i think there's going to be a
2882.32s: lot of changes uh in terms of of of
2886.32s: fiscally what we're gonna see here um
2888.96s: you know i think there's no way around
2890.48s: this i have no idea what russia is gonna
2892.64s: do but it is questionable what you know
2896.40s: how much more dangerous uh you know the
2898.96s: leadership of russia becomes when when
2901.84s: you have one of the most perhaps the
2903.60s: most embarrassing moment for russia
2906.32s: of of poutine's career i think i mean
2909.52s: it's it's been a total failure so far
2912.08s: what he has done
2913.68s: so
2915.20s: in my opinion and so sure what is he
2918.00s: going to do now to restore the
2919.52s: credibility inside of russia and into
2922.56s: the rest of the world with a message
2924.64s: that he wanted to send but unfortunately
2926.88s: that
2927.60s: that message didn't come across yet and
2930.16s: so
2931.12s: it's it's a little scary in that sense
2933.84s: yeah um i hope we're not gonna see a
2936.16s: world that a lot of people think we'll
2938.24s: see
2938.96s: but um you know the best that i can do
2941.76s: as an investor is to continue to buy
2944.72s: and you know take advantage of that
2946.40s: volatility that we're seeing i think
2948.56s: rallies needs to be uh sold not not not
2952.64s: by the dip is is a strategy that i'm not
2955.28s: sure will work the same manner it
2957.68s: happened in the in the past
2959.52s: um
2960.40s: and i think there are places that are
2961.92s: uninvestable you know i've always
2963.76s: thought that i mean it's giving you
2965.84s: another idea of how principles are
2968.16s: important
2969.28s: and
2970.48s: even though china is cheap i do not we
2972.88s: do not invest in chinese assets i mean
2974.80s: we we can only
2976.40s: kraskat only shorts china
2978.64s: if makes sense and so we are not long
2981.68s: china and we're not long russia i don't
2984.24s: care how cheap it is um right it's not
2988.08s: you know
2989.28s: not part of our moral um uh views in
2992.72s: general and so
2994.64s: i think you know we don't we don't
2996.72s: finance communism across the globe i'm
2999.36s: sorry to get there but it's just not not
3001.28s: what we do and so
3002.88s: um we don't invest in russia we don't
3005.36s: invest in china um
3007.60s: we invest in in other places in the
3009.68s: world that we think
3011.04s: could potentially do well um and if they
3013.76s: ever start to become like russia and
3016.24s: china we'll we'll exit from those places
3018.88s: too and so
3020.40s: i think um
3022.24s: strategically we got to think about
3024.64s: um china in taiwan you know i think i
3027.68s: think there's
3029.12s: quite a lot of books about the situation
3031.28s: with taiwan i think currently has opened
3034.72s: the path for
3036.08s: such a
3037.68s: potential
3038.88s: invasion or takeover of taiwan i think
3042.48s: the best way to do that is since we
3044.88s: started those issues with ukraine we
3047.44s: have not seen the changes in fx in the
3050.72s: chinese market just yet and so
3053.52s: meaning the chinese currency has been
3055.60s: very stable so far
3057.84s: we added short
3059.36s: positions in the chinese currency we've
3061.36s: been short the chinese currencies for
3062.72s: many years
3063.76s: and sometimes it works sometimes it
3065.76s: doesn't work and um but we think it's
3068.72s: one of the most overvalued assets um in
3071.12s: the world today um and it is a
3074.32s: major imbalance when it comes to
3077.12s: banking assets relative to gdp i have a
3079.44s: very different view than most people
3081.04s: that think um china and russia are
3085.28s: you know are playing the long the
3086.72s: long-term game i actually don't
3089.12s: i'm sure they are but i think i think
3091.76s: you know
3093.76s: russia has been a total failure i mean
3095.52s: just look at the currency and just look
3097.12s: at the china the the
3098.64s: the russian market in general it's been
3100.32s: a total yeah
3101.68s: so well the ruble what dropped like 20
3103.68s: or something overnight when all the
3105.04s: sanctions started coming through what
3106.72s: type of loan long-term game is that i
3108.88s: mean that's been the worst performer in
3112.64s: one of the worst performing countries
3115.12s: in the world i think
3116.96s: and and and so and so have chinese
3119.68s: equities too and so
3121.84s: i don't know i i have a very different
3123.84s: view i find it difficult to see
3126.40s: large capital allocators going into
3128.72s: china
3129.68s: especially in the next five to ten years
3131.76s: given all that's happening and so you
3134.48s: have to question what is going to drive
3137.20s: those economies to continue to perform
3139.60s: very well in an environment where
3141.68s: commodity prices are rising you know
3144.00s: where is china going to keep up growing
3146.56s: at 10 whatever the number do they tell
3148.40s: you that they're growing at 10
3150.40s: rate every every year um
3153.28s: when
3154.08s: oil prices in in chinese you one terms
3157.12s: is that the most expensive has been in
3158.96s: like seven years or so and so
3161.84s: you know i think it's all questionable
3163.84s: no current accounts are going to become
3165.84s: more on the deficit side for china
3168.32s: relative to the rest of the globe that
3170.48s: is all very negative for china not
3172.48s: positive india is in the same spot by
3174.72s: the way
3175.76s: and so
3177.20s: i much rather belong brazil than belong
3179.36s: china by the way so
3181.52s: there's a lot of develop macro
3183.44s: developments here uh unfolding at the
3186.32s: same time but hopefully i shared some of
