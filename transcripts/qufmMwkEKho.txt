0.00s: Let's talk about the wheel versus my favorite the coverage
4.28s: triangle. I wanted to show you an example of why I tend to
8.20s: prefer the coverage triangle, not saying that the wheel is bad,
11.04s: but for the way that I trade, the coverage triangle tends to be
14.36s: a little more optimal. Now first, let's start with level
18.04s: setting. What's the difference between the two? It's really
20.76s: my new. The primary difference between the wheel and the
24.16s: coverage triangle is when we're selling additional short
28.92s: puts. So they both start with a cash secured put. You can
33.12s: manage this cash secure put however you like to manage puts. So
37.12s: for me, I have different profit and loss taking metrics,
40.00s: normally around 60% credit received, or if I'm within a certain
45.20s: time frame, I might look to manage the trade kind of like I
48.84s: have outlined in my main video on the coverage triangle. Now
53.68s: let's say we continue to deploy the cash secured put until
57.48s: we're assigned at that point, we would look to sell a covered
61.76s: call. That's the same in both strategies. However, this is
65.88s: where the difference emerges. Once we sell that covered call,
70.40s: in the wheel, we stay there. We continue to sell short calls
75.48s: against our long stock position that we were assigned on until
80.20s: it goes away. In the covered strangle, while that covered
84.60s: call is working, we would sell additional cash secured puts.
89.48s: And this is the primary reason why I like the coverage
92.68s: triangle because it allows us to remain a little more sensitive
97.92s: to price. It also allows us to be more active and get more
103.08s: trades on to realize more profits. So let's take a look at an
109.04s: example. What I did was I went into think back. This is
113.56s: December 2nd of 2015 right here. So that's what this chart is.
118.88s: And then this is where I just neutralized the position. It
122.72s: definitely would have gone on longer. I just made an assumption
126.16s: in terms of the short calls being assigned and coming off so
129.48s: that we could just kind of talk about it. Now, what I want to
132.88s: walk through is why I chose this time frame. One, it was
136.56s: random. I literally picked a random time frame because I think
139.04s: that's helpful. But I did look for something that I knew that
142.32s: there was a drop included because that's really where the risk
145.84s: lies in the strategy. So if I had just picked a scenario where
150.28s: you know, the price was just going up, we would just be
153.80s: essentially selling the same short puts. So I wanted to walk
157.56s: through when we're actually managing the trade taking stock
160.48s: and things like that. So this was the outcome. I will go
164.56s: through the details of the trades and whatnot in just a second,
167.80s: but I thought I would give you what happened up front. And as
170.92s: you can see, the total PNL for the covered strangle is 952
177.64s: bucks. This is assuming a $30,000 account. And that walks out
182.08s: at around a 3% return on invested capital from December 15
188.16s: until about May 16, 2016. And then this is the wheel. And they
196.24s: came out at about 788 and a 2.63% return. So not a big
201.08s: difference. But again, there's a really significant limitation
204.80s: in this study in that I didn't actually wait until the trade
208.56s: was neutralized. I just neutralized it at the end. So what that
211.88s: means is this strategy would have had additional cash
215.04s: secured puts tied on to it that this one didn't, but I didn't
219.56s: want to have this really long study that nobody could really
223.56s: have the attention span a little walk through. So this will
226.40s: serve the purpose for now of really displaying the point I made
229.88s: earlier in terms of being more active. So what we have here is
234.16s: the very first trade. So let's take a look at what this actually
238.76s: was. So what I did again, I went back to December, I think
242.16s: first or second, let's just go to the first. And this is on
244.84s: demand. So I'm literally flipping through time. So this is the
247.72s: day that we entered the position. And this is the first position
252.60s: that was entered on both sides. I WM was trading what around
257.52s: one, call it 119. And on both sides, I sold one of I'm sorry, on
267.80s: the coverage strangles side, I sold one of the 8 Jan 16 116
274.12s: puts collecting $1.38. And then the only difference on the
278.48s: wheel side is I did two. And the reason for this is that's kind
282.72s: of one of the primary differences between the wheel and the
284.84s: coverage triangle is we're going to use more capital up front
288.60s: because we're not necessarily planning on adding more short
292.04s: puts as the trade continues. So in order to really have any sort
296.76s: of near peer comparison here, you would need to use more money
300.12s: in this this strategy up front. Otherwise, it will just get
303.28s: completely blown away by what you can do with the coverage
306.40s: triangle. So that's why I went with a two lot there compared to
311.24s: the one lot that you see in the coverage strangle because on the
313.72s: coverage strangle side, we are anticipating part of our management
317.96s: plan is to scale into the trade as it goes against us via those
323.24s: additional cash secured puts. Okay, so this is the first trade.
327.96s: Now I am going to fast forward time. What I did since we have no
333.80s: existing position on right now, I literally just went straight to
337.16s: expiration. Now what I will mention is we could most certainly have a
343.84s: discussion around when we would manage the puts, how many of them
347.40s: we would get on and things like that. But again, just for the
350.32s: nature of the study, keeping it relatively simple for at least
353.48s: this iteration, I went to expiration on the first short put. So
358.08s: that led us immediately to getting assigned because again, we
361.84s: entered that trade before that drop as you will remember if we
366.48s: take a look here, right? So we enter here and then we go through a
368.80s: drop. So that's why we are already getting assigned. Now I'm
373.00s: going to bring over kind of my working Excel sheet that I made just
376.40s: for this. Like I said, it's kind of simple, but I didn't want to
380.80s: overcomplicated here for the sake of the conversation. So here's
385.36s: where we originally started and that was selling those short
389.92s: puts at this point, we just fast forward to 11 Jan, this is the
393.16s: week of expiration of or I'm sorry, this is after expiration. So
399.32s: our puts expired on 8 Jan, which was that weekend right here.
404.64s: And essentially, we would have been assigned on the 9th on Saturday
408.60s: and then this is the next trading day that we could take a look.
411.64s: So what we're going to do now is literally go through the trade
414.36s: essentially as I was comparing them. So now it's 11 Jan first
419.72s: trading day at this point in time, we are going to have 100 shares
426.20s: on the coverage strangle and then we're going to have 200 shares
429.84s: on the wheel. Now on the wheel side of things at this point in
434.92s: time, we would be looking to sell short calls, same thing for the
438.68s: coverage strangle. But what you'll notice is we're trading down at
443.96s: 102. So let's take a look at what possible short calls we have
449.20s: better at our basis, we're at the 116, we're going to get 9 cents.
453.68s: There's no short call to sell here in my opinion. If you wanted
456.96s: to make $9 on that short call, you could, but I do not think it's
460.60s: worth capping the upside, especially limiting what you could
464.68s: sell it for. If you get a move in your favor, it's just too
467.52s: little money. So in this instance for both, I chose not to sell
472.16s: a short call. Now it's worth noting, my protocol for selling
476.28s: short calls is essentially the same in both of these. I'm applying
479.04s: the same paradigm, the main difference here is I can sell two of
482.04s: them over here, and I can only sell one of them in the wheel,
485.24s: because I only have 100 shares. Alright, so that is this trade
491.16s: has now come off the table because we were assigned on those. And
497.84s: at this point in time, we have 100 shares here, 200 shares on
502.32s: the wheel, which is purple. Now what I had on was this, I added
508.92s: on 11, Jen, so that would be the day that we're looking at right
511.88s: now, I added the 26, fab 100 puts collecting $2.50. So the reason
518.12s: why I'm doing this is multiple fold. The first one is if I get
521.24s: assigned, we will reduce our strike significantly. We're going
524.84s: to come from 100 shares at 116 to 200 shares at 108. So we get
532.00s: a pretty good reduction in our basis, if we're assigned as
535.64s: compared to this scenario. The other thing is we're collecting
539.20s: another $2.50. We're continuing to realize profits, not just yet
544.24s: obviously if we sell that put it's open. But once we get to the
549.04s: point where we're going to realize the profits, you'll see what
552.56s: I mean. Alright, so now I'm going to fast forward to 26, fab.
557.32s: I'm going to go straight to the expiration here. Now the reason
560.12s: why I'm going straight to the expiration on this is because I
564.24s: before I did this video, I flipped through each week to see if there
568.48s: was a place to sell short calls against the positions and there
571.96s: wasn't. And you'll see why it continues to stay pretty much
576.60s: suppressed. So I'm just saving you all time by telling you, I
581.48s: looked each week, but there wasn't a great opportunity to sell
584.52s: short calls. And again, you'll see that in just a second. So we
587.96s: just fast forwarded now it should be 26, fab. So we got assigned
593.48s: originally over, let's double check the date just to be sure we
598.20s: got a sign on the 9th of January is where we saw the first. So
604.28s: somewhere in here. And as you can see, we didn't have a short
608.92s: call that looked good there. We definitely didn't have a short
611.84s: call that looked anywhere in here. It went lower and literally
614.32s: went lower. So this is now expiration of our short puts that we
622.36s: sold on the coverage stringle side. And on this day, they were
627.36s: trading, essentially, I could have let them expired, but I didn't
630.56s: I just decided to take them down for a penny. So at this point in
633.88s: time, quick trade recap, we are sitting on 200 shares at 116
638.72s: in the wheel. There is no short call available to us. So nothing
643.52s: to do here on the wheel. We now just secured profits on our
648.32s: second cash secured put. So this takes our realized gain, we
654.64s: have the 250 realized as well as the 138 from when we were assigned
658.92s: again. And that's where we're at right now. Quick caveat that I
663.20s: didn't go over before on the wheel side, we would have realized
667.56s: the $276 profit from those two short puts that we sold. So overall
675.56s: realized PNL in the wheel up until this point is 276. And then
681.52s: realized PNL is on the coverage stringle side is 387. So I just
688.56s: did the math right there real quick for you all. So we have 387
692.56s: realized here 276 realized here 200 shares out the door on the
696.88s: coverage stringle. Okay, so we've just realized the PNL
701.88s: there. Now I am going to scoot us forward to the next trading
706.88s: day. So that would have been Friday expiration. We're just
709.88s: going to fast forward real quick to 29 Feb. And on 29 Feb, I
715.88s: sold another cash secured put. So this time we put out the 8
720.88s: April 100s again collecting a $1.82. And now what I'm going to
725.88s: do is just show you what I'm looking at for selling covered
730.88s: calls because we still don't have any covered calls out. Now
734.88s: again, we're at the 116 basis. So let's say we're going out
737.88s: 46 days. We got to go to the 116 to see what we can get. And
741.88s: you can get a nickel. That's to break even on the stock. And
746.88s: then you would collect obviously the premium there again,
750.88s: simply not enough to make it worthwhile. So what I did was I did
755.88s: the same thing as before. I looked at when we could kind of have
759.88s: a viable point to add short calls, which I found on the 21st of
764.88s: March. So let's go to the 21st. And then I want to walk you
768.88s: through my thought process here. So now we're fast forward to
771.88s: the 21st of March. We were assigned at 116 on the 9th. So
777.88s: again, somewhere right in here. And now we're finally starting
781.88s: to get kind of improved on our underlying to our basis. The
788.88s: underlying at this point, trading for like 109 and change. So
792.88s: let's pause this and take a look. Let's say we got 60 days.
797.88s: And let's take a look at our 116s. At our basis, we could sell
803.88s: a call against our position for 51 cents, something like that.
809.88s: In my opinion, if I was deploying the strategy, I would not offer
814.88s: calls here yet. They are still very far out of the money. If
819.88s: I was trading the wheel, I might send these calls out because
824.88s: I'm not making any money at this point in the wheel. I'm just
827.88s: holding on to long stock, not the end of the world, but not
830.88s: making a bunch of money. Whereas on the on the coverage
833.88s: strangle, I'm still generating returns via the cash
838.88s: security put side of things. So I would be even less inclined
841.88s: to add short calls out because you're getting pennies on the
844.88s: dollar. Essentially, this is at our basis. There is an
848.88s: opportunity cost to be holding the stock for this period of
851.88s: time even so far. So in order to make any money here, we
855.88s: would essentially have to sell right at our basis. So what
859.88s: that means is on the wheel, you would make $100 and you
864.88s: would make no money on the stock. To me, that's not a great
867.88s: payout. I would prefer to wait. And this is one of the reasons
870.88s: why I trade something like I WM because I don't care about
874.88s: waiting. It's a good product. It has inherent diversification.
877.88s: So that is what I chose to do in this example is wait. So now
882.88s: I'm going to fast forward to eight April, which is the
886.88s: expiration for those short puts. Again, I did not see any
890.88s: really attractive short call offerings. And just to show
895.88s: that I'm not, you know, just picking and choosing random
898.88s: dates that look good, I will show you the chart. It went
901.88s: down afterwards. So the short calls that we just evaluated
904.88s: and we did got worse essentially. So let's take a look now
910.88s: at what we have going on. So it's eight April, we're going
916.88s: to collect this $182 because our short put is at $100 and
921.88s: the underlying is trading at 109. Again, you could
925.88s: conceivably just let them go into go to expiration, keep it
929.88s: all, but I closed them out. So now what I'm going to do is
933.88s: I'm going to move to the next trading day, which would be
938.88s: Monday. The 11th. So here I'm looking to see if I'm going
943.88s: to sell more short puts or if there's a covered call offering.
946.88s: Again, we already evaluated the covered call scenario.
949.88s: There isn't anything here that looks good to me. So what I
953.88s: did was add more short puts. So I did the 20 May 105
958.88s: short puts for $1.29. So at this point in time, I essentially
963.88s: will have realized profit on three rounds of short puts
967.88s: totaling $568. I have another $2128 out. And notice that
973.88s: all of these short puts that I'm doing would offer me the
977.88s: ability to lower my basis if I was assigned on the wheel.
982.88s: We are still waiting for a good point in order to sell short
987.88s: calls. So what I did was as I found a time to start looking
994.88s: at some short calls. So on 11 April, we already took a look.
999.88s: So let's go to 9 May. So again, what I did was as I just fast
1004.88s: forward time before I did the video to look for a period where
1007.88s: selling short calls started to look attractive. That turned out
1011.88s: to be 9 May. Again, you'll see the chart reflect that in
1014.88s: the first and second. As soon as it updates.
1018.88s: All right. So the chart is taking an eternity to update.
1021.88s: This is kind of one of the plagues of doing think back or on
1025.88s: demand. That's okay. Because we can see where it's currently
1028.88s: trading out, which is 117. So what I did was is actually evaluated
1032.88s: some short call options. And I think let's see what I actually
1037.88s: went with for both of them. I won with the 30 June's. So what
1041.88s: I did was is I went out 52 days. And then again, our basis
1045.88s: right now would be giving us a dollar and change. So I went
1049.88s: out $2 to get 58 cents. Now I know what you're saying.
1053.88s: You said you're saying Eric, you could have gotten 50 cents
1056.88s: before. Why didn't you do it? But you're doing it now.
1059.88s: It's because I'm giving the stock appreciation room. So when
1064.88s: it was trading at 50 cents before, it was at our basis. We would
1067.88s: make $0 on the stock. In this scenario, we're going to be
1071.88s: able to collect 50 something bucks. But then also we have two
1074.88s: dollars of capital gain space for the stock. So it's exactly
1079.88s: why I chose that scenario. Now to kind of wrap this thing up,
1085.88s: I just went fast forwarded to 20 May and essentially neutralized
1090.88s: everything assuming best case scenario. So let's say we go to
1096.88s: 20 May and what happened, what would have happened here if
1101.88s: this was expiration for everything is I would have made the
1104.88s: money on the short puts on 20 May. That is definitive.
1107.88s: It's simply because that's where I went and these would have
1110.88s: expired out of the money. So that leaves us overall a
1114.88s: short put PNL of $696. Now I went with the assumption that
1121.88s: on 30 June, these would have expired for a profit. We can take
1125.88s: a look right now. I'm pretty sure that they would have
1128.88s: expired in the money or close to it. And let's see.
1134.88s: So it looks like it was at 114. So we would have been slightly
1137.88s: out of the money. Essentially all that would have happened is
1140.88s: we would have collected money on both of these short calls,
1143.88s: realized that profit offered new short calls at a higher
1146.88s: point as well as offered additional short puts. But again,
1150.88s: I didn't want to go too crazy with the example here. It's already
1154.88s: a 20 minute long video. But I wanted to show you a really
1157.88s: important aspect, which is by trading the coverage
1161.88s: strangle, we can be a lot more active in realizing profits
1165.88s: and we offer the ability for us to reduce our overall basis
1170.88s: once we're assigned on subsequent short puts. Now the
1174.88s: one potential upside for something like the wheel is let's
1178.88s: say we're trading around where we are right now in the example
1181.88s: and it's 114. You could choose to only sell one short call
1186.88s: at your basis. So you could say I'm going to sell one short
1189.88s: call at 116. I'm going to leave 100 shares open. And then
1193.88s: you have the ability to appreciate more on the upside than
1196.88s: you would on the coverage strangle example. So there are
1201.88s: ways to optimize both of them. But again, just based on my
1205.88s: experience trading both of these strategies, the reasons
1208.88s: why I explained to you are explicitly why I gravitate to
1211.88s: the coverage strangle because bear markets are when we
1215.88s: crash tend to last for a pretty long period of time. It's
1219.88s: something like 290 something days. I just did a video on it
1222.88s: not too long ago. So they allow me to stay more active,
1225.88s: reduce my basis more effectively. And overall, I am a big
1230.88s: advocate, really, of either of these strategies. But I think
1233.88s: that the coverage strangle slightly edges it out for the
1235.88s: reasons I share. As always, if there's any questions or
1238.88s: anything that you all want to see me go over, let me know. Hit
1241.88s: me up in the contact info in the video description. And until
1244.88s: next time, be an outlier.
