0.00s: Hey everyone, Eric here.
2.00s: We got some small stacks updates to get through.
4.76s: So I wanted to jump into those very quickly.
8.32s: In short, the account is actually pretty allocated.
11.56s: A little more than I was expecting it to be,
12.96s: but I like what I have on.
14.68s: So let's go to the screen.
16.56s: Okay, so right now the account value is 59.17.
22.16s: Utilization is 40.92 and we're about 70% utilized.
27.16s: Total PNL not just over 900 bucks.
31.16s: That represents a 15.15.5% return.
35.16s: And right now we have $255 out, which is a 4.31% return on the account.
45.16s: So let's see the trades that have been made.
49.16s: First off, if you'll notice, forward is down.
52.16s: So I took that entire trade down.
55.16s: Total PNL in it was $124 after closing the short calls.
61.16s: And that's a 13.7% return on invested capital in that trade.
66.16s: So that was pretty much an easy win as far as I could tell.
71.16s: I do like Ford still.
72.16s: It's something that I might revisit,
74.16s: but just seeing the move that it made,
76.16s: it essentially made the move that I was looking for it to.
78.16s: So I didn't maintain exposure.
82.16s: So if we take a quick looking,
84.16s: kind of see what I'm talking about.
86.16s: When I first entered Ford,
88.16s: it was quite a bit lower,
90.16s: definitely in the sevens,
92.16s: like mid sevens and maybe yeah, definitely mid sevens.
96.16s: I don't totally remember what the price was on entry.
98.16s: I'd have to look at the date.
100.16s: But essentially after it made this high,
102.16s: I was getting ready to unwind and then just on the down day today,
106.16s: just made sense.
108.16s: To take the whole position down.
110.16s: That's where we're at in Ford.
113.16s: Then for.
116.16s: A croger,
118.16s: the only adjustment that I think that's this one.
121.16s: Yeah.
122.16s: So for in croger,
123.16s: it's pretty simple.
124.16s: All I did was take the short call down.
127.16s: At a profit.
128.16s: And I did not lay anything new out.
132.16s: And the reason for that is as things sit right now.
137.16s: I would, I could sell at the 35 five or at the 36 strike,
143.16s: but short calls,
145.16s: but it wouldn't make that much money.
147.16s: So I would rather just leave it uncapped for now.
150.16s: The trade itself is still returning well.
153.16s: I've realized $288 in profit with 1357 outlay.
158.16s: So overall, it's returning well.
160.16s: I'm not going to prematurely close off the potential profit.
165.16s: Now, one strategy I am looking at in here is maybe selling one call on a rebound.
173.16s: And then leaving it at a ratio, kind of like that.
178.16s: So if we take a look real quick at croger,
181.16s: you'll see it's made a move down.
185.16s: It's made a move back down to this minus two.
187.16s: And that's why I'm not really in a big rush to sell the calls.
191.16s: It could obviously continue down for sure,
194.16s: but just based on general, my general approach to trading,
199.16s: seeing it hold this 200 day moving average and be it a negative two standard deviation.
205.16s: I think overall,
207.16s: I probably would favor at least some sort of move to the upside,
211.16s: even if it's limited.
213.16s: So if I see that, that's when I'll start adding a couple short calls.
218.16s: There is definitely some premium in there,
221.16s: even at the lower deltas, like if I were to sell 35, 5,
225.16s: but it's just not enough.
227.16s: Compared to what I know I can get.
231.16s: So this is one that I intend to keep an eye on.
237.16s: And then finally, you'll notice a new diagonal in Intel.
243.16s: So this is actually a position that I'm mirroring a similar version in my margin account,
249.16s: not quite the same.
251.16s: Simply because I just want with short puts in there, but generally bullish.
255.16s: And obviously couldn't afford that realistically in the smallest acts accounts.
259.16s: So instead I went with the diagonal.
262.16s: And I took in the 18 June 21 37 and a half calls.
268.16s: And I paid $10.35.
270.16s: And then I sold the four D 47 calls.
274.16s: And I got $1.65 that of 48 delta.
278.16s: That's 165 credit.
281.16s: And almost a 16% return on invested capital, which again, would be completely happy with that.
288.16s: This is a slightly tricky position because I do not want it to take a third of the account.
296.16s: Third represent 33% of the account or so.
300.16s: And I say that because right now I have $2,000 allocated to it.
304.16s: That was more just kind of taking a look more probably than anything.
309.16s: I will not add to this trade unless it comes down significantly.
313.16s: And I could add something for like $600.
317.16s: That I would consider kind of taking that a lot of them down from $2,500 is probably the way forward here.
324.16s: And I really like Intel, but.
327.16s: Just general good portfolio management.
329.16s: I don't want this position to represent that much of the account.
333.16s: And then so in here I did sell the short call against it.
338.16s: And it's mostly because the premium was really good.
342.16s: I still think that.
344.16s: The propensity for this trade is for that short call to fall in the money.
349.16s: At least some point.
351.16s: Relatively in the future, I don't see Intel, you know, necessarily staying down here at 46.
356.16s: But nonetheless.
358.16s: I wanted to make sure that I kind of realized that premium upfront.
362.16s: So best scenario, just like any other diagonal is the short call falls on the money.
368.16s: And then I have to manage it that way, which would be totally cool.
371.16s: No sweat with that.
373.16s: But otherwise this trade will kind of be set and forget and more revisited in closer to December.
380.16s: And then lastly, I have a short put out in mosaic at 17.
385.16s: And this was honestly a really good trade for me because I like mosaic.
391.16s: And this bit of a down move has moved it closer to where I could reasonably enter.
397.16s: Now, there is earnings coming up, which I perceive to be a positive catalyst.
404.16s: This is not necessarily an earnings play outright.
407.16s: If you'll notice how far out in time I went, but I was using the earnings.
411.16s: I'm increasing volatility to try to increase the return on the position collecting 90 cents on a 17 strike is obviously really good premium.
419.16s: If I do get a bounce leading into earnings or, you know, bleed off of volatility, I will take the trade down.
426.16s: For a smaller profit, maybe 20% or so.
429.16s: But if it doesn't happen and I run this into earnings, I'm okay with it.
433.16s: We'll see, you know, how earnings goes, but this is a cash secured put for me.
437.16s: This is something that I would not mind owning longer term.
440.16s: It would utilize $1,700 and that's fine.
444.16s: So on all the account is relatively utilized at this point.
448.16s: I found a few trades to put on that I like.
451.16s: And we'll see big dependency really is croaker.
455.16s: I want to add those short calls when I pretty much soon as I can because that's realized money.
460.16s: You just don't want to do it down here for Intel and mosaic.
463.16s: Those are almost set it and forget just kind of check it in a few weeks and see what they're doing.
467.16s: But right now I like where the account is unlike my margin account small stacks to stay and allocated.
474.16s: It's too little money.
475.16s: Again, if there's some sort of big down move after the election, I don't really care because I'll hold the products that I have.
485.16s: And the small stacks account, I can't say it enough.
488.16s: It's not going to be the thing that's going to make anybody rich.
491.16s: You're not going to turn that 5,000 even 100,000 into your future, you know, wealth.
496.16s: This is working through mechanics and strategy and really proof of concept that we can implement a successful strategy.
504.16s: So that's why I'm not as concerned about preservation of capital in this account.
508.16s: As compared to what I'm doing in my margin account, which is more so scaling into the election just to limit exposure to that binary event.
516.16s: I'm not applying that same paradigm here.
519.16s: So we'll see what this looks like.
522.16s: I do think that this will be relatively quiet at least for a week or two.
526.16s: And the next trade I expect to make would be short calls and croaker to add some short premium there or closing mosaic out leading into earnings.
536.16s: Otherwise, we should be pretty static.
539.16s: As always, if there's any questions or anything anybody wants to work through, let me know and I will catch everybody later.
