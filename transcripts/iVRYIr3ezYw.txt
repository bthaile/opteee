192.00s: you
194.00s: you
196.00s: what's up outliers what's up
198.00s: apes happy Saturday today we are on our
202.00s: mean stock watch
204.00s: so today's focus will be primarily centered around game stop
208.00s: and
210.00s: but as always if there is other tickers that are in this world that you want to take a look at let me know always happy to take a look one of them
216.00s: that I do think is worth us talking about at some point is o and yes
222.00s: and it's because this company I actually think is in the very early stages of
232.00s: of
234.00s: likely a fruitful life cycle this is in the drone space and we can go through some of their financials and stuff
242.00s: I wouldn't say that like I'm a fundamental investor although I absolutely consider it's part of what I do
248.00s: but before we get too far off track I do want to start with game stop because there's a couple things that recently came out
256.00s: first thing is I had somebody asking about some of like the decision making in my positions in game stop specifically in the coverage triangle so
266.00s: I'm going to talk about that
268.00s: so that folks have an understanding of like what I'm doing and how and why
274.00s: again not suggesting anybody do what I do I actually would strongly advise against it I think you should do whatever works for you
282.00s: but I do try to share information and then people can choose to do whatever they want whatever makes sense for you
290.00s: I am just another random dude on the fucking internet so I am I'm not the guy to to base what you're doing after
298.00s: but you can learn different ways and then cobble stuff together that works for you okay
302.00s: so that's one thing the other thing that we do have to talk about that's actually very cool I was
310.00s: generally unfamiliar with this guy Roger James Hamilton I don't know him
316.00s: but it looks like he posted something about GNS which is genius group limited that's on the New York Stock Exchange
324.00s: which is an AI powered Bitcoin education group and it just filed a class action complaints
332.00s: in the Southern District of New York alleging Citadel in Virtue engaged in a long running market manipulation screen
342.00s: that includes spoofing and naked short selling of the company shares here I'll just read the
350.00s: redatch will press thing together because I think that it's it's certainly worth the conversation around
358.00s: and I think one of the tricks here is I know that those that are in the GameStop community are like
366.00s: really really really hyper sensitive to manipulation a lot of them think like everything is manipulation now
374.00s: which that's not good either to be completely frank but there is something going on
382.00s: and we can see it one of the cleanest examples of how I can see it literally in my day to day as a trader
388.00s: it's very simple it's this in the options markets if we have a bit of spread so let's say something is
398.00s: bid at a dollar and let's say at that dollar bid it's one by one hundred meaning that there's
408.00s: a hundred contracts that are willing to transact at the dollar for the bid and then let's say that the
418.00s: offer is a dollar ten and let's say that this is also one hundred this is what's referred to as
426.00s: the size so this size would be quoted as 100 by 100 this means that at the bid there's a
432.80s: hundred contracts ready to transact at the offer there's a hundred contracts ready to transact
438.80s: if you're speaking the way that this works is a it's a cue system there is some preferential
443.68s: order routing and treatment but it's generally speaking a cue system so what that means is that if there's
450.40s: three people that have grossly misshapen heads apparently and one that's not connected to their
456.96s: fucking body don't be these people but if you are in this cohort this person would submit their order
464.32s: first and let's say that they wanted to buy one hundred so they should be able to submit their order
476.80s: at the price of one ten at a size of one hundred lots and they should get a fill again
485.84s: this is if they are truly first in line the order that you're seeing resting there on the market
492.96s: should be available in another scenario well let's continue this scenario let's say that this order
500.24s: does go through as it's supposed to then typically what happens is we will see this order walk a little
510.00s: so maybe instead of being one ten at a hundred the next offering is one eleven at eighty
520.32s: whatever so then that means that if this person also had an order resting at one ten
527.60s: they won't get a fill it's below this now again this is assuming we're not
534.08s: getting fills between the bid and the ask and we're saying that we're only transacting at the bid
538.72s: or the ask that's just to prioritize the ordering because otherwise it gets a little more
545.68s: well way more confounding than this but this is the principle so this person if they had an order at
552.08s: one ten they wouldn't get a fill they would have to up it to one eleven and then if they had an order
558.64s: for one hundred they also wouldn't get a fill now if they have the election in their brokerage
565.92s: to allow for partial what that means is they will get eighty of these at one ten this will go away
574.64s: and then the next liquidity order I wouldn't say liquidity providers it could just be other traders
580.80s: but the next flow of liquidity would pop up here is the next order and it literally could go back
586.08s: down it could say well now it's going to be one ten at whatever it could go back down okay
591.36s: this is how the general queuing system is supposed to work here's what actually happens
597.52s: literally every single day that I trade ever I see this all the time
603.60s: in this configuration let's say that I want to sell options and I notice this is very frequently
612.40s: in my earnings place let's say that I want to sell options and I want to sell 50 straddles
620.16s: and I'm trading something that's not super liquid so I leg into the straddle what that means is
627.28s: the straddle is a short put plus a short call you could put this position on as one position
634.72s: and you can say that I want to sell to open 50 straddles if you're in a market that's not liquid
646.08s: you can't always get a great price doing this or you can't always get a fill at the size that you
652.56s: want so very frequently you have to break this up or accept a worse price if I break this up
659.44s: what that means is I'm going to sell to open 50 calls and then I'm going to sell to open 50
668.08s: puts just as single orders it's a same ultimate position that gets entered slightly differently
674.88s: well here's what happens like really really frequently I will go and I will attempt to hit the
684.64s: bit what that means is I am not bothering attempting to put an order at 106
693.28s: because when you trade at larger sizes you already know that's not going to happen the only thing you do
700.24s: when you put in that order for 106 is you ping these liquidity providers and now they know that
707.44s: there's fucking demand so what would they do make it more expensive for you if it's a relatively
713.76s: quiet market so for those that are trading at larger size going and trying to be cheap can actually
721.44s: be more expensive because now they know there's demand they saw the size that you were trying to
726.56s: transact at least for your first trunch so they'll readjust their books they don't have to make any
732.48s: sort of fill between these they don't have to do that here's the rub and here's the fucking problem
741.52s: very frequently as I mentioned I won't fuck with the mid I will immediately go to the bid
749.04s: and I will say oh I want to sell to open 50 of whatever the at the money call is
757.28s: and I will do it at whatever the bid price is now if this is functioning properly
766.00s: if there's somebody in front of me that could impact my order the cool thing is with level two data
777.68s: I can see if this is the case level two order data let's me see the resting orders in the queue
786.40s: size and price I can see both so I can clearly see if there's shit resting there and there isn't
796.48s: so then when I go to place this straddle starting by lagging in I'll submit this order
804.40s: and nothing will happen nothing and then you say to yourself well wait a minute
813.52s: why would nothing happen because I'm within the price I'm within the size that should be a fill
826.16s: what's actually happening is a smaller element of spoofing what happens is as soon as this order hits
838.32s: it's all automated the system will pull this back before you get a fill it'll pull it back
844.64s: and I'll say oh no I didn't want to do that psych just kidding jk didn't want to do that
850.80s: really my market is going to be 98 cents by a hundred and then you move your order down two
860.16s: pennies to try to hit it here and then all of a sudden it's fucking gone again and then you say
866.64s: to yourself what's going on here there's a game being played by these institutions the game is
876.00s: and this is in an options trading world in an option trading world without going too far into detail
885.60s: we have some key components to an options premium for the premium of an option we have stuff like
893.60s: the spot price strike price if there's a dividend if it's a call or put and so on and so forth we
902.72s: have some key inputs that go into this model one of these key inputs not days expiration but is
912.16s: implied volatility or really in this case is just volatility it's not implied in the distance
918.08s: is volatility well when a market is made and you're resting this option here at a dollar
927.20s: if I see this option at a dollar what can I do if I am a competitor of whoever is providing
940.16s: that liquidity and they typically know who's doing what we don't just because we're not as close to
944.88s: it as they are but what could I do is anybody have a guess we already know that there's some key
954.64s: inputs based on that order that's resting there dollar by a hundred one ten by a hundred what can I
966.24s: do with that information there's an important term in the options world that you're probably familiar with
974.24s: which is implied fall what is implied volatility implied volatility is the volatility
985.20s: we imply by extracting it out from the option price how does this work I know all of these inputs
998.24s: I know it's spot prices I know what the strike price is for the option I'm looking at I know what the
1002.64s: dividend is for the underlying I know if it's a call or put I know what the days to expiration are
1009.44s: the only thing that I don't outright know if I were to look at an option is what's the correct
1016.80s: volatility for it I have no idea that's where we get into the world of forecasting fall
1028.32s: in this world we're already playing in a game of fractions of pennies that's how money is made
1033.36s: and maintained if somebody has a slightly better forecast for volatility that is a definitive edge
1042.40s: over other competitors in that space let's tie this together I just told you that if you give me
1051.44s: this information I can extract what the volatility is that you forecasted for this option
1061.44s: I now know what you think the vol is for this then if I have a better model I can either decide
1069.76s: if I think your vol is wrong or if my model isn't as good I now can refine my model and be
1078.00s: priced appropriately this is literally showing information to competitors by offering a market
1086.08s: this is exactly why you see the bullshit that I refer to earlier
1092.16s: because by showing this dollar by a hundred what you're really doing is showing me your forecast
1099.84s: volatility and it's just sitting there everybody can see it everybody can derive it
1106.48s: so rather than your forecast being out on display you put out something that you know is a
1117.60s: little bit off just a little bit off and there's one of two things you can do you can either
1124.88s: under price or over price that gets into an entire deeper layer of gamesmanship
1132.56s: but that's a big element of what goes on in the options markets like I said I can see it
1139.20s: not just in game stop I can literally see it every single day we're motherfucking thing go
1145.20s: I'm playing with a penalized sit here in it fell apart ran away for me but I literally can see it
1151.52s: every single day genuinely this isn't like fear mongering this isn't tin foil like I can literally
1157.28s: see it I'm actually working with a couple of friends that are working on a case about this
1162.64s: separate from this because it is incorrect this is like the same thing that if you went to a store
1169.60s: and they have five turkeys and the printed price on the turkey is 20 bucks and then you go to pay
1176.80s: for your turkey and they're like ah damn this isn't 20 bucks man sorry about that's 35 35 for this
1186.48s: so sorry about that oh you wanted to there's not really five there's only one now that I think of one
1193.68s: maybe it's a $40 turkey now maybe give me a blow job I don't know but this turkey's fucking expensive
1199.68s: at this point I think right that's the that's the that's the equivalent of what's happening here
1208.08s: and they know it they know exactly what they're doing it's all very purposeful so
1214.48s: a pretty long small anecdote in preamble into this here's the problem with this
1221.68s: few things the first thing is we can see how frequently places like citadel are fine actually let's
1228.24s: turn grock on it right now out of again curiosity let's just eyeball it I'm going to ask grock
1234.80s: how many times in the last year or let's give it two years how many times in the last two years has
1244.80s: citadel the curities been fine that's funny the auto complete on grock that's the second suggestion
1255.60s: funny enough the first one is donated to a charity and then the third auto complete is securities updated
1262.32s: app the second auto complete is been fine I'm not the only person looking for this let's see what
1272.40s: grock says now in the meantime while that's running let's see what they're identifying
1282.40s: run of the engaged in long running market manipulation scheme that includes spoofing in naked
1287.92s: short selling of a company shares as it relates so these are two like very different but very big issues
1294.80s: the thing to remember about spoofing is that in general spoofing really isn't it really isn't
1302.80s: done to fuck you the retail trader you're a by-product I'm not saying you don't get fucked but it's
1308.40s: not meant to fuck you it is meant to fuck other people playing the same game as them so that one's
1314.88s: a little bit different the market the naked shorting that's a different bag that's meant to
1321.04s: fuck you fuck your grandma fuck everybody that that is literally meant to screw everybody but the spoofing
1328.64s: is there's a drive by going on you're not in the gang but you happen to be walking by just so that
1335.20s: you understand the broader context it still impacts you but it's not really directed at you
1342.48s: zubers says do you think anything will happen it feels like the powers that at B will not intervene
1349.28s: since these corporations are so massive I have to agree with you and more over than that I think if
1364.32s: anything were to happen it would be so unbelievably inconsequential to the bottom line P&L
1374.64s: that it would do nothing and that's actually one of the things that I'm waiting for
1377.92s: grow up to response here okay there we go so it looks like it was find once in the last two years
1384.96s: a one million dollar penalty for violations related to the consolidated audit trail okay so million
1393.20s: let's just again let's put this in the context so let's do Citadel
1399.84s: what is Citadel's quarterly net revenue let's see
1412.64s: so we know that there's a million dollar fine
1423.60s: okay
1432.72s: rock this is in your this is in your wheelhouse we're not asking anything crazy
1436.88s: okay so the most recent available for Q1 is 3.4 billion in net trading revenue so they made this is
1448.48s: for a quarter so 3 billion 400 million that's where they're at this is again for a quarter
1460.24s: so let's see how bad this percentages let's see how damaging this was to their quarter
1472.08s: that one million dollar fine represents 0.03% of their quarterly trading profit
1484.32s: that's the problem so even if something is done the penalties are I'll ask another question
1495.20s: to grow what was the worst penalty they ever paid what was the worst financial fine or penalty
1505.20s: Citadel as paid let's see what the worst is
1514.56s: so the the trick here is why would you even care about staffing the consolidated audit trail
1528.24s: if you're operating a business and this is what you're making in a quarter and this is what the
1534.80s: penalty is gonna be this is way cheaper than benefits salary
1542.32s: for however many people you need in order to complete the operation as it's supposed to
1549.52s: so it literally just becomes a I can't even call this a minor in can be it's a fucking rounding error
1557.68s: you don't even see this it's it's literally a rounding error
1564.64s: so yeah it's just so far off okay so here we go the largest penalty Citadel has paid was 97 million
1574.48s: with China's securities regular regulators CSRC in January 2020
1580.56s: resolving allegations of malicious short selling you don't fucking day
1588.24s: oh I love this I let me see if I can get around that I want to read this article but
1597.28s: they're too cool for school and have paywall
1601.36s: you're like there's got to be like a better series of tools I can get around these fucking things
1607.76s: if that works trying to 12 foot I'll and then I'll grab another article
1615.84s: these guys are nope that one's also paid SEC dot got here we go
1625.20s: and then Bloomberg but then well so we can only get it through SEC and you can see the title there
1638.64s: just so that you can again see the actual source
1646.56s: resolving allegations of malicious short selling and other trading irregularities during the 2015
1653.60s: Chinese stock market turmoil these involved high frequency trading activities by Shanghai unit
1659.36s: accused of contributing to market instability spoofing is probably in there
1664.64s: or context these dwarfs other notable US penalties such as the 22.6 million paid to the
1671.92s: SEC in 2017 for misleading clients on trade price and execution so let's just take a look at these
1680.24s: we know that there's a 22 million $600,000 penalty and then there's also what was it 96 million
1694.80s: and let's let's get some context this is the worst that they've paid the worst that they paid
1709.60s: was 2.8% again I want to be very very clear 2.8%
1720.64s: not of their annual revenue this is for a quarter this happens four times in a fucking year
1735.68s: let's see what that comes out to
1738.48s: and then let's see what these are now as a percentage of their annual
1756.56s: literally all of them are less than a single percent the highest is less than three quarters of a
1763.52s: single percent so this goes back to the original question from Zuber which is do we think anything is
1772.72s: going to happen I think something might happen because they've been fine before they've been actually
1779.52s: find not that irregularly but we know that whatever happens is not going to be anywhere near
1790.08s: damaging enough for them to even give a remote fuck about it you can combine all of these and they
1800.48s: still don't care it's literally arounding her it means nothing so
1807.68s: yeah boy let's continue with the latest the company believes the lawsuit sets a number of
1822.08s: precedents with regards to the protection of shareholder interest as a company company is taking
1826.88s: action to recover damages caused due to a large market manipulation it's awesome
1831.44s: lawsuit is a class action on behalf of all of its investors who sold
1836.64s: genius group stock at an artificially deflated prices as a result of the sentence alleged abuses
1843.12s: pursuing class action facilitate recovery but for all harm shareholders
1849.44s: so this it looks like they're saying that they were targeted or naked short selling which
1855.84s: this leads to kind of an interesting question why and I don't know the answer to this maybe you guys
1865.20s: maybe you guys know but genuinely like why hasn't game stop done anything like this
1874.00s: I really don't understand why not because like I do think that there's enough of a footprint
1882.24s: I maybe maybe once this maybe once this is fought and we see how it goes maybe there will be more
1889.84s: because maybe it's just a lot of people that are looking at it saying what the fucking I'm going to do here it's
1894.56s: not even gonna matter but well let's see what I'm curious what evidence I know they're not going to
1902.72s: go deep into it's the case is ongoing but uh spoof in manipulative illegal trading practice that
1911.12s: involves submitting and then canceling by or sell orders without any genuine intent to execute them so
1917.52s: again the example that I gave you with respect to making markets is a like a derivative of
1923.68s: spoofing it's not direct spoofing this is really meant to ping people's order books and stuff like that
1928.96s: it looked yeah okay it gives you a description the purpose of these baiting orders is to mislead
1934.56s: other market participants about the level of supply and demand or about the degree of price
1939.12s: volatility associated with the security thereby influence market prices for the security
1945.60s: so it alleges that from 22 to 2025 they entered thousands of spoofing trades designed to create
1952.80s: the false impression that there was both excess supply and excess volatility company confirmed that
1958.88s: the lawsuit seek at least the previously reported no less 250 million in damages again like
1966.48s: let's just let's just run this 250 million in damages
1974.80s: right like they still don't fucking care they don't care that's 1.8% of 1 years revenue
1988.88s: even at that number they don't give a fuck like sure you don't want a bunch of these I'm
1993.84s: not saying that this is completely negligible and you know whatever you just accumulate these but
1999.60s: that still isn't enough to make that big of a difference because here's the other thing that
2007.28s: you have to remember from the legal side of stuff a place like what is this genius group I can't
2014.64s: imagine that they make a lot of money because they're at the it's a penny stock it's at 86 cents
2021.20s: so I don't know what they're let's just see at a curiosity let's see what their financials are
2029.60s: and these are in what millions oh yeah it's so they're not making a lot of money
2040.32s: it looks like they're still in the process of like building their company which is fine
2047.52s: but the point that I'm making is that a place like this isn't gonna have some sort of
2053.60s: massive deep bench of lawyers whereas a place like Citadel will have an insanely deep bench of lawyers
2065.36s: why does that matter a big part of lawsuits isn't actually winning them a big part of lawsuits is just
2073.52s: slowly grinding down the people on the other side financially and the thing about
2081.44s: somebody like Citadel's lawyers is they will be used to fighting this in-house they're already on salary
2087.20s: so it's not like you're coming out of pocket additionally compared to what your annual expenses and
2091.28s: everything's already budgeted for that effectively gives you unlimited time and ammunition for those
2096.08s: that don't know this is a big reason why the U.S. government is so successful when it does decide to
2102.72s: go to trial it's not only you can think you know the games rigged in different ways
2107.68s: I genuinely don't know so I couldn't weigh in accurately that way but what I do know
2113.76s: is that they have people that are on staff to do that exact job so they can just slowly
2120.32s: erode people because when you hire an attorney their time is expensive and everything that they
2126.32s: file for you is expensive that's the broader problem here so let's continue
2140.08s: these orders were calculated to deceive or induce other investors to sell their holdings
2146.40s: artificially deflate prices and that 98% of all trading days they were repeatedly entered
2153.68s: spoofing trades they repeatedly built massive short positions through off exchange trading over a
2162.16s: few days so this is using stuff like dark pools the reason why you do that again
2168.72s: there's a few different ways that they might do this but a thing to remember
2173.60s: is that off exchange volume still does hit the consolidated tape so a lot of times people think that like
2181.52s: the order flow that goes through something like dark pools doesn't get integrated into
2187.68s: price and stuff it does so there's I mean execution incentives and stuff like that but I don't
2194.48s: know why they mention it here in particular other than maybe they're just like playing in a different
2198.72s: spot then bombarded the market with spoofing trades causing significant declines in the price
2206.00s: of the stock now another thing to note is smaller companies are highly susceptible to this
2211.92s: because again think about the damages that they're talking about $250 million that gives you a sense of
2218.08s: scope this isn't $250 million over the course of a few months this is $250 million over the course
2222.72s: of three years so what that tells you is that the overall movement in the stock is not that heavy let's
2231.68s: take a look let's go to GNS and let's just eyeball so the volume here is 11
2245.68s: $1.85 so we'll call it's 112 11 million 200000 the stock is 86 cents so your total dollar volume
2259.76s: over the course of a day is $9.6 million right it's like really really cheap these kinds of names
2273.12s: are much easier to manipulate for anybody so then again if you put this in the context of
2279.28s: Cedudel's trading book the total daily volume it's just so insignificant it's not even funny
2287.68s: they could literally mistakenly move the market in there if they wanted to so yeah that's entirely
2294.88s: entirely plausible and wouldn't even take a lot the defendants i think we already read that
2302.64s: less than a minute after the baiting orders place they sold significant volumes of stock short
2308.32s: through off exchange trading they engaged in short selling naked short selling in proper short sales
2316.56s: let me see are they hard to borrow they are hard to borrow what's their current short flow
2327.20s: GNS
2330.80s: short flow let's see
2334.08s: GNS
2342.80s: Jesus
2348.24s: I mean the short flow isn't
2351.92s: at big
2364.00s: that's weird
2372.56s: that's really weird
2377.20s: and let's take a look at the short interest volume
2380.16s: I mean that's high
2389.52s: share availability for short is pretty high
2395.68s: FTD isn't that crazy it went hey wire let's see what happened to price in June
2401.84s: yeah that's normal during stuff like this
2409.12s: well normal in air quotes you typically see that
2418.32s: and it was super shorted around then
2422.56s: that that really is very
2424.88s: very interesting to me because it like it really isn't that heavy
2437.52s: of course in terms of total volumes it's like half so that part is actually a bit excessive
2447.28s: but this isn't much the short interest flow does not much most of its
2453.04s: happening off exchange which again that doesn't just happen to manipulate it
2458.24s: does have a passive effect but that's also just for order execution
2468.00s: I mean I'm glad they're doing this and I think the way that this goes
2473.44s: at least provides a little bit of a playbook and foundation for others
2477.20s: is you ever said what do you guys think of this
2483.60s: like I'm genuinely curious like what's the general opinion of
2488.16s: what's being alleged here I imagine for most of you this is like
2492.08s: another fucking day at the office because I imagine most of you typically feel like this but
2497.92s: I'm curious like what's what are your what are your thoughts here
2501.68s: my instinct is also just like why this stock there's not even that much money that they
2508.08s: could make in this from shorting which I'm just not I just don't totally understand that
2516.64s: but I mean you also don't make as much money as you do by looking past easy opportunities
2523.52s: so it could be that
2525.28s: as you've ever said if the consequences of breaking the law are insignificant it won't deter
2530.16s: bad actors from repeating breaking the law definitely that's a completely agree I think with
2537.36s: yeah I mean with everything that we looked at there's effectively no incentive to stop them
2543.68s: from breaking the law this is all completely insignificant
2548.88s: now speaking of the recent price behavior in game stop we are now at what I consider to be
2559.36s: a really really important level the reason why I think this is again you can see like this was
2569.04s: drawn if you look on the past videos this line has been drawn for a while it's not because it's like
2573.52s: some magic line but it's just because this is where I balled prior perceived support and you can
2584.88s: see that it generally held up here and then realistically the prior level was here like the 22
2590.40s: handle I really did think that this 22 handle was going to be pretty strong and it proved
2597.44s: good here and it started okay here but then just flew through here I think part of that is
2605.84s: because of the broader market tailwind which is struggling right now but if we zoom out a bit further
2612.32s: you can see that this is kind of like the next major level that we've seen transactions occur
2619.12s: which leads to a fairly monumental time that I wanted to do with you guys which is draw the next one
2626.80s: we haven't needed to go below this yet but if I eyeball this and I try to figure out where the next
2635.52s: perceived support level is it immediately looks like something off of these here but I can also see a
2645.28s: really thick volume note here the problem with this volume note is that we're talking about like
2650.56s: years ago this is using really really old data so I wouldn't overemphasize that volume note much at
2657.20s: if but we do need to go out further than one year let's go to two years and let's see yeah so if we look
2663.84s: at two years the next primary volume note is here at the 15 handle so it looks like I would ballpark
2674.64s: this that 1877 ish as the next price level of interest which is a bit of a bummer because that gives
2690.32s: us a decent amount of downside potential if it does start to break through here which leads to
2698.08s: a quick overview of some of like the rationale and the decision making behind my trades and if you guys
2705.76s: haven't seen I gave you a video actually because somebody specifically asked for it about like what I'm doing
2713.28s: in in total that video I just threw into the chat for you guys and then I'll also throw it
2720.56s: in the video description for those that are watching them recording but the issue here is
2733.36s: the long equity side of the trade is struggling that being said one of the coolest things about
2741.36s: game stop is even as this is going on there's a lot of volatility so there's still a decent amount
2747.04s: of money to be made and I'll show you how. Brains says GME is within the regression other breaks
2753.20s: at support of resulted in breach of regression the problem there and you have to remember this is that
2759.60s: regression updates right regression is using the current data points that exist so this will change
2771.68s: it'll also change based on the time frame that we zoom in so if I look at this regression this is at like
2778.88s: 1929 the lower part and I'm just going to zoom in at three months let's see where it is now well
2785.52s: now it's below it this is at the 2113 so you see these are standard deviation channels by the way
2791.52s: but linear regression channels which you guys for those that familiar with my typical technical
2797.04s: analysis approach I used to use them a lot I flipped up between standard deviation and linear
2801.76s: regression channels but linear regression channels are literally meant to fit the data that's what
2806.96s: 100 and 50 means 50% of the data should be in there 100 means 100% of the data should be in there so they
2813.68s: move with respect to standard deviation channels it gives us a bit of a different lens and it's also
2822.00s: very skewed from this recent behavior that's why when we zoom in you actually see it's already below
2828.72s: the negative one-stem deviation so yeah anyways the main thing there is like I would
2836.16s: mentally bucket those more is like useful just for general context and trend then anything else there's
2842.00s: not like some sort of magical power with regression or standard deviation channels it just gives you a
2849.04s: sense based on the matching time frame that you're using where is our current price level
2855.20s: zubers says 30-day fall looks to have increased recently perhaps due to earnings I actually don't think so
2860.40s: I've been seeing it at 70 for a while let's take a look quick here and
2869.44s: yeah I mean it's been kind of hoverin sideways for a while the last time it had a decent uptick
2881.44s: was from here which was like a month ago is when we moved from like 50 into the 70s but otherwise
2894.56s: it's been it's been about what you see at least for about a month so I think one of the reasons
2908.08s: why you see volatility still remaining slightly elevated is because this decrease the differences
2916.72s: where vol is now is it's changed a lot if we take a look at some options and let's go like 30 days
2926.32s: out 30-40s out let's take a look at the out of the money put which is like a 38 delta that's at like
2933.60s: a 61.5% vol if I find the same 38 delta ish something over here that's at like 65
2943.20s: so to make these actually like purely same same what I can do is I can take the delta so we had like a
2948.96s: 38 delta and a 35 delta and I can literally create a percentage based on their vol's so the 34
2957.60s: delta is at 65.6 so this is 65.6% and then this one was 61.53 at the 38 61.5% and the the reason for
2978.88s: doing this is it just helps me understand like what's the ratio of deltas to vol and if we look at this
2989.60s: as a ratio we can see that the calls still have more vol relative that call skew is really important
3006.88s: to monitor because that's like a primary defining feature of game stop is call skew as compared
3016.48s: to put skew which is what most other options chains have but if you don't know this is one of the
3025.04s: easiest ways for us to normalize recesses can you elaborate on vol's effect on delta yeah well vol
3035.52s: well two things I if you're asking about what's going on here that's not the same so there's two
3043.36s: there's two pieces the question you ask Reese is still a valid question but that pertains to
3051.52s: how does implied volatility change delta that's one question if you're asking about what we did
3059.44s: here this isn't about what implied volatility impact is on delta this is just normalizing implied
3070.48s: volatility against delta the reason for this doing this exercise is there isn't the same delta
3079.20s: out of the money call and put they're at slightly different so what I'm doing is I'm creating a ratio
3085.44s: of the volatility against the delta so then this is essentially saying like how much vol is there
3092.64s: per unit of delta across both of these so it allows me to directly compare the put delta
3100.72s: and vol against the call delta and vol so then I can easily see for the first strike out of the
3108.56s: money what kind of skew exists now with respect to delta more broadly in the options chain
3117.04s: as volatility goes up your delta will be sensitive to it there's actually a Greek that measure this
3125.20s: so if we go to our handy dandy abomination of a deck that's why in the Greeks video we go through this
3134.80s: actually pretty far in detail let me grab I have like a video that's like
3141.60s: everything about the Greeks see
3152.88s: so this gives you pretty much everything
3165.52s: here there you go if we go and just poke through you can see that there's a relationship
3177.84s: between things like gamma and vol which gamma relates to delta the purpose of understanding
3186.96s: these specifically is because delta will still be what delta is but if things have higher volatility
3196.96s: that's why if we go further and further out in time you'll actually see your 50 delta option
3204.96s: isn't at the money let's compare this so in 16 October let's go further out just to make the effect
3213.52s: more pronounced let's go to jn27 jn27 your 50 delta option is somewhere between 27 and 30
3224.08s: somewhere in there if instead I take something like g e and I look at where the 50 delta is you can see
3232.48s: that it's a little further out but as a relative to the price of this it's not that far out
3239.60s: that's because of volatility because remember volatility scales with time if something has higher
3246.72s: volatility we expect it to have wider ranges so if you expect it to have wider ranges that's
3254.64s: going to lift your delta's you're typically going to see higher delta's because everything now
3261.20s: proportionally has a higher probability of finding itself either being challenged temporarily
3267.20s: or being in the money at some point zouver says is that because there's more upside potential
3275.92s: with the current price point and likely better earnings it's not actually that's a great guess though
3282.64s: so the reason why you typically see call skew as compared to put skew in game stop is actually
3289.04s: because of the squeeze potential it's because it is a meme stock in the sense that it has a lot of people
3296.48s: that are highly engaged and interested in this stock because of that it exhibits a anomalous behavior
3304.40s: compared to other standard names one of those anomalous behavior pieces is the fact that price
3313.68s: can go absolutely a wire if roaring kitty comes back if roaring kitty came back and posted a mean
3321.92s: you know for a fact this thing would go haywire that's just how it is because of that potential
3328.72s: that gets priced into the options chain they're not dumb they know that that's a thing
3334.32s: with something like this generally speaking as you see things also getting closer to a perceived
3341.92s: floor so something that's kind of been beaten down and it's seen as about as low as it's going
3347.04s: to go that's another time that you will see call skew tend to come in when it generally speaking
3354.88s: isn't expected for it to go down much more at all but we still see a decent amount of volume
3359.76s: puts it's just you can see where the floor is if we look at these 34-day options right if we go
3370.00s: one dollar from 20 to 19 we go from a 38 delta to a 29 then we go another dollar from 18 which is
3380.72s: now a 20 delta we go one more dollar we cut our delta's in half again so what this is telling you is that
3388.96s: it's really not expecting game stop to go down here it's not expecting game stop meaning the
3394.64s: options market is not expecting game stop to go down here to the 17 handle it has it right now price
3401.44s: there's less than 50% chance of hitting the 18 handle right now the general expected range for
3409.12s: this thing is like the 19 20 handle to the downside then to the upside if I figure out how far the
3417.60s: 50% probability is to the upside it's here which is at the 23 so think about that right now the
3426.16s: market is pricing in a the at least the maximum downside potential to be 5050 at 18 so down two points
3437.76s: what will two point six points for more we are now and then to the upside right now it's pricing it
3444.72s: at the 24 handle for it to be less than a 50% chance so that gives you like four points in change
3453.20s: that's the big difference that's called skew that's right now the market is favoring potential
3459.68s: severity to the upside the cool part is when we look at the way that I'm trading game stop I try
3468.08s: to capitalize on that if we go back to this little log and again this is using the sample portfolio
3476.08s: which is a subsection of the broader portfolio the main thing to note is how much you see in terms
3486.32s: of the annualized return on invested capital for these different options at different points
3492.56s: time and durations the DJ says I thought Delta was the percent chance of it going to that strike
3500.08s: it isn't that is a okay way to think of it in general let's take a look really quick what you're
3509.76s: referring to there is the probability of a touch or probability of in the money which is really
3514.88s: really important to know but let's clear all this out and let's learn together really fast
3521.44s: we have Delta which can be an approximation for probability of in the money it's not perfect
3531.76s: but it's a okay approximation under two conditions condition one is we're looking at a low
3539.28s: volatility stock which we know game stop is not condition two is that we are close in time
3546.88s: less than like 60 days to expiration these two conditions allow you to fairly accurately use Delta
3555.52s: as a probability of being in the money and then if you're talking about the probability of a touch
3561.44s: so the probability that a strike price is at some point breached and then either stays in the
3569.28s: money or the underlying reverse back the other way this is two times Delta and I have a video
3576.64s: that goes through this way more in depth so I won't bore you with it here you can look it up on
3582.56s: the channel just like Delta is a probability but the reason why this exists is because of shit
3593.04s: the fuck is this thing because there's a relationship between the calculation
3600.32s: of Delta being a probability of being in the money versus the actual calculation
3607.92s: of the probability of an option falling in the money I actually think that's probably in here somewhere
3614.64s: let's see really quick could be able to look up like what probability
3619.92s: it looks like it's not that looks like that was an older in older take sorry but
3642.00s: the reason why you can use Delta is a probability is because the calculation the actual
3653.84s: calculation for an options probability of falling in the money shares a lot in common with Delta
3661.52s: but it's just not a pure overlap so if I look up Delta on the YouTube channel here we go
3671.52s: oh yeah this isn't older video this is from like the middle of last year
3678.64s: look at that beard
3682.96s: all right in here somewhere we'll be there we go
3690.48s: let's get the whole thing out there
3692.40s: there there go you can take a screenshot of that this gives you a rundown of Delta is a
3708.96s: probability and how it exists and why the main thing to note is that when we're calculating Delta
3717.52s: Delta is ND1 what is ND1 it's this combination and don't let all it's just a differential
3726.24s: equation what it's taking is a log normal distribution and it's coming up with relative relationships
3734.16s: so there's a key difference between these both of them are scaled by volatility and the square
3742.40s: root of time that's very very normal but then there are some very important differences between
3749.84s: the denominator which is why these two are actually different so here's the video
3758.32s: here and yeah so feel free to check this out at your leisure but that's why Delta is a probability
3766.80s: is a slightly different thing then what you might think otherwise and I'm literally going to
3775.12s: throw that screenshot of shit I'm going to throw that screenshot in here so that next time somebody
3781.84s: is a question about it we can quickly find it we need to copy this bad boy
3797.76s: so yeah a little bit different not that different but a little bit different
3804.88s: this gives us Delta's a probability and then the relationships between things
3819.36s: there you go okay great question though and then I think I saw another one further up
3827.20s: Javelyam says knowing what you know about game stop and the last year and the half what low price
3831.76s: would make you say what the fuck or would you always be able to explain low price I guess that part
3839.04s: really depends on like what we mean by what the fuck because I am more of a general market
3848.72s: supply and demand trader so what that means is like if I saw a game stop down here at 15
3859.52s: I would be like that seems really fucking low for what game stop is I guess the easiest way to
3869.20s: describe that is the point that I would be like what the fuck is when game stop is trading
3874.80s: below its intrinsic value as soon as it's trading below intrinsic value and staying there that to me doesn't
3881.28s: make sense however like short of that it's always just an expression of supply and demand that's all
3894.48s: what that means is how many people are interested in the stock not interested in the stock and why
3902.96s: and then the impact of leverage more broadly laid on top of that so yeah I think
3911.20s: if I saw a game stop remaining below intrinsic value that would absolutely
3918.16s: cause me some some question like right now there's a reason why I still have a decent amount of cash
3925.92s: in my position on game stop right now I'm only using 76% of the total allocation that I gave
3935.92s: game stop and of that only 27 and a half percent is actually in stock what that means is my current
3944.24s: position is actually holding light stock the reason is the stock is going the wrong direction right now
3954.08s: when the stock is moving in this kind of direction I actually don't want to have a whole bunch of
3961.92s: shares I would prefer to move into shares when either the stock starts to stabilize to the downside
3971.60s: or if it starts to rally now I have been slowly nibbling on shares and I will continue to do so
3979.68s: the reason for that is because of that broader pulse cue that we're referring to
3987.84s: if we just take a look at commensurate options really quick let's take a look at the 19 December
3996.08s: and let's take a look at these so the 19 put which is a 29 delta is at 63.7 3V and again
4010.48s: you can make your own calculator that I showed you guys that I showed you guys here so that you
4016.40s: literally can do this on your own and have an understanding of what you're looking at the other
4023.76s: stuff that I would do here is just include the premium so that you can also look at premium
4028.48s: relative to delta let's do that if we look at this 19 strike so we need to normalize it over the
4037.12s: strike as well so our strike is the 19 our premium is like 0.8 and then I'll pull the
4051.36s: sheep back over so you guys can see delta is 0.29 and my ball is 63.7 the closest call that I can find
4069.28s: is actually also a 28 delta which is great it's this one right here it's the 23 so the 23 call
4082.32s: trading for 84 cents oh no I lied sorry the 24 my bad sorry guys the 24 this is trading for 66 cents
4096.24s: and this is at a point to a delta we can analyze this and figure out how things are being
4105.92s: priced so this is your strike this is your premium this is your delta this is your IV this is your IV
4117.36s: to delta ratio and then we can have a premium to strike ratio so in this case we would just take
4132.80s: our premium divided by the strike this gives us a rough understanding of how much money we make relative
4142.40s: and then we can also have like a premium to delta ratio the purpose like this should be delta to
4149.20s: premium the purpose of this is to figure out how much premium you're getting per delta
4155.60s: and the reason why that helps is because it can help contextualize your risk so you can
4165.60s: literally build your own version of like this little calculator here that's that's why I have all these
4172.80s: ridiculous excel sheets built out is so again you guys can hopefully find stuff that's
4182.00s: useful to you and make your own versions so this will be your type which is whether it's a call or put
4189.12s: and then yeah what I can tell is where is the best bang for my buck in terms of if I want to
4198.24s: sell puts or buy inventory and sell calls if I sell puts I'm effectively selling cash secured puts
4206.88s: already yet if we look at where you're getting better of all for your delta it's actually here
4217.04s: in the calls if we look at how much premium you're getting relative to the strike price
4224.40s: it's here if you take a look at where you're getting better premium for your delta
4230.08s: it's here so even though you're getting better premium per your strike that's because it's a
4238.16s: lower price here right like if that's because these are that 24 this is that 19 but let's say
4244.64s: that your basis on your shares is 20 just watch this number alone it closes that gap not enough but
4252.48s: it closes that gap some so the way that I think about this is by using this information I can
4260.96s: figure out do I want to buy shares and sell calls against it or do I want to just sell puts and
4267.20s: collect the money that way this is in the context of game stop doing what it's doing now which is going
4272.72s: down if game stop stops going down in baselines then is a different conversation or if it starts
4279.68s: actually accelerating to the upside right now as I was explaining the position itself is actually
4287.76s: quite light and it's literally just because I'm waiting to add more shares the way that this will work
4297.92s: is actually quite simple you can see that I have two different torrents of puts out these expire on
4305.76s: 19 December I have a five lot at the 22's and then a six lot at the 22's so if I look in the
4311.92s: the platform I just have 11 at the 22's but I track them separately because they're doing different
4316.96s: things one of these was actually rolled this one so this one's actually very important for me to
4323.76s: track this position itself and it's because this position needs to overwhelm this position and I have to
4333.36s: keep that in mind so if I take this down too fast I cannot do that and then I'm worse off than
4342.00s: where I would want to be but the the most important thing is if we take a look at game stops performance
4351.04s: on where we started for 2025 right now in terms of my performance versus game stops performance
4362.16s: I'm outperforming game stop now by 47% by doing what I'm doing versus just a buy and hold
4370.32s: equivalent in game stop because game stop is down like 35% on the year my position is not only not
4378.80s: negative but it's decently positive for something that's gone down 35% that's that's like the most
4388.00s: important thing here by far is by applying a slightly different approach here I can still maintain
4397.04s: exposure to something that has good volatility but not lose a bunch of money provided that I manage this
4406.40s: as I need to as you can see pretty much all of the money that's been made has actually come from
4414.48s: the option side of the equation and it's because of how much volatility is in here I can make a lot
4420.88s: of money now the trick is right now these 22's are in trouble so I'm going to have to manage those again
4428.40s: and they still have plenty of theta actually have the peak of theta so I won't do anything with
4434.80s: them yet they're effectively at the money even though there are a couple strikes in they're like a 58
4440.80s: so these I wait for now and I still have a decent amount of extrinsic value that's got to come out
4449.68s: so I have like a dollar 34 out of this that's going to have to come out at least if everything stays
4456.96s: the same and with 34 days left to go don't really want to roll out to 62 I could come closer to like
4464.00s: two jams or something like that and they're definitely is a roll available here if I need to but
4472.00s: right now I really don't need to this one was originally sold for a dollar 35 and then a dollar
4480.32s: 88 so both of these are underwater but not overwhelmingly so the way that I'll manage those is
4489.44s: allow more time to pass and if I can take them down and then roll them out and then down ideally
4497.92s: out of the money I will or for example this is what what that would look like for those wondering
4504.72s: and as always like if you have questions about what I'm saying if what I'm saying doesn't make sense
4510.00s: or anything like that like seriously please ask me that's why I do these on a live stream
4514.64s: so that I can hopefully give you information in a way that you can connect with and on a live stream
4521.04s: you can walk me on a target if I close these down for what they're currently trading at which
4529.04s: I already forgot what that is 236 so let's pretend we close both of these for $2.36 that means our
4540.96s: net loss is going to be we're going to lose 793 we could literally just take that loss and we will
4549.44s: still be net positive on our options component to this even the the short put component to this
4557.84s: that's entirely a choice and sometimes it's not a bad one because I don't necessarily expect
4563.76s: there to be a profound amount of additional downside in game stop I don't really care that much
4571.36s: so now what I can look at is well what would I roll these two so let's just eyeball it right
4578.00s: now the stock is at 266 and we can look at a couple different expressions but I'll go out to the 16
4585.12s: Jan and let's say that we wanted to try to get out of the money so we go to the 20s which we're
4594.80s: going to get a dollar 64 so at the 20 those are a 39 delta and we're going to get a dollar 60
4604.96s: I can now figure out how many of these I need to sell and you can see something right out of the gate
4609.44s: notice what I just did I put on the same position size 11 contracts and the position size here
4616.72s: nets out profitable however remember I have this world position that I have to contest with
4624.00s: so realistically I wouldn't make 967 I would make I would still be positive but only 32 bucks
4632.80s: which isn't bad but my preference here would actually probably be to offer a little bit less
4641.68s: give it 10 on these it will net me slightly negative at 128
4650.48s: but I just freed up another 100 shares and then what I can do with that is actually buy
4658.16s: outright to increase the stock position so then let's just say those came down
4665.92s: and right now I'm only using 67.4% so then let's say that I choose to buy some more today's 15
4673.68s: ove let's say that it's trading at $20 and 66 cents and let's just take a look at a couple
4682.32s: transactions let's say if I get 200 of those that takes me back up to 75 that brings my basis
4689.52s: down trivially down to 22 not much but it does take my basis down a little bit and it gives me 800 shares
4697.84s: so now I can sell more of these let's say that at the I'm at the 24 I wouldn't want to be too far
4708.40s: under the 24 I would either do it at well my basis is 22 not 24 so my basis is here which is
4715.28s: 47 delta I wouldn't want to do anything there I would be here at like the 24 so I can add another
4721.28s: like two of those for a dollar 21 so one 21 we get two of those that's going to be at the 24 again
4730.16s: now you can see that we're actually building profit on just holding these shares
4738.64s: that otherwise are underwater but I'm also coming up with the slack for this position
4745.84s: remember we were net loss a little over a hundred bucks this compensates for that and I
4752.00s: reconfigure the position a little bit more just says if when rolling covered calls my strike price
4761.76s: is passed what is the best way to manage the position to hold onto the shares do you keep rolling
4767.52s: and collecting premium until you get assigned or roll up that is a really really good question
4774.64s: and the reality is is it depends on when well we've really depends on what you're trying to do with
4782.56s: your inventory what I mean by that is if you don't want your shares to get called away
4793.20s: the first thing is genuinely don't sell covered calls against them and it's because your covered
4799.52s: your short calls can be assigned early they can be assigned for no reason somebody could literally
4805.28s: just click the button it's super unlikely but again this is why you have to weigh it against what
4810.40s: do you really trying to do with the shares so if you're like I would rather die then get rid of these
4815.36s: shares like I know some apes are which is completely fine don't sell calls against them because
4820.32s: there is a small but present probability of them being called away for some illogical reason
4826.96s: that can happen now that part of side if your position is I really don't want to lose the shares
4834.56s: if I did I wouldn't like it but I would still not die I would be okay that's a different scenario
4841.68s: then you can sell calls against them and the way that I think about selling calls against them is I
4847.76s: first protect myself by making sure it's at a ratio so notice how I have six calls here
4857.28s: against 800 long shares so I have 200 shares that are not covered by any calls whatsoever
4866.08s: that's smock insurance that's in case this thing decides to go parabolic haywire
4872.64s: while I have these short calls and let's say it goes into a short squeeze goes into a short squeeze
4880.24s: it's going to be next impossible for me to get out of these calls and there's a really good
4885.52s: chance that they're going to get assigned early by people trying to cover their positions okay that
4890.56s: means I'm going to lose 600 of this 800 don't want to but it'll be okay I still have 200 shares
4896.32s: that I can attempt to participate in the parabolic up move until I can just rebuild my inventory
4901.60s: a big difference between the way that I trade and a lot of apes trade game stops specifically
4907.28s: is when we go through these big price fluctuations I trade so what that means is when like this
4914.72s: squeeze here I had both long calls and shares I phased out of both of them as we were up not at
4923.76s: the peak of like 80 in change but I started exiting the position all through here and again the
4930.40s: reason for that is if I buy 500 shares when it's at 15 again let's just do an example together
4940.24s: 5 by 500 shares when it's 15 that means that I have spent a total of 7500 bucks
4950.80s: now let's say that I sell 500 shares when it's at 60 that means I just made 30 grand
4962.48s: so what's my total profit on the position it's $22,500 what does that equal in terms of a percentage
4977.04s: triple the money why do I care about this well it's because now when game stop let's say game
4984.88s: stop does go back down to 15 let's just say it went back down there the difference is now
4992.56s: rather than being able to get the 500 shares now I can get 2000 shares I can accumulate
5003.12s: way more inventory here so that's the reason why I don't just buy and hold through stuff like this
5012.08s: I actively trade it and it's because I'm really trying to maximize the total amount of
5018.72s: profit that I can take out of the trade itself so that one things do settle back down I now don't
5026.88s: have the capital for 500 shares I have the capital for 1500 additional shares to do stuff with
5035.68s: so anyways going back to the short call equation just remembered I would do it at a ratio
5043.36s: I would make sure that I don't sell calls if I'm not again you don't have to be happy about it
5048.00s: but if I'm not otherwise okay with the potential of my shares being called away and then the way
5053.52s: you can manage them is you just have to make sure that there's extrinsic value that remains in the
5058.80s: your options your short calls become really high risk of early assignment if there's not a lot of
5065.04s: extrinsic value and specifically in dividend paying stocks if there's a dividend coming up that exceeds
5072.80s: the remaining extrinsic value all that means is because remember if let's take a look at
5081.12s: scenario really fast let's say that somebody sold me these let's do in the money it'll be a better
5089.04s: example let's do these let's say one of you sold the 19 calls and you sold them to me for 305
5099.76s: let me grab my little pad so you sold these to me for 305 so I have the 19 calls for 305
5113.84s: okay now if I choose to exercise my option that means I get to buy to open let's just do it one
5124.16s: lot so I get 100 shares at 19 dollars what am I giving up I'm giving up the remaining value of the
5133.60s: option so in this case the option is worth $3.5 but some of that is intrinsic value we can calculate
5141.60s: our intrinsic value by taking the difference between our strike price and spot price
5151.68s: this is why going back to a longer term example from a while ago this is why Roring Kitty
5160.16s: didn't exercise as options is because he literally would have lit tens of million dollars
5167.20s: of money on fire he would have just lit it on fire which wouldn't make any sense at all
5174.08s: so here you have a dollar 66 so what we do is we can figure out how much of our premium
5183.36s: is intrinsic versus extrinsic value so we know that this is intrinsic value this is how far in the
5189.28s: money it is the next part of the equation is how much of that is extrinsic value so it's literally
5195.84s: the difference between these two numbers if I choose to exercise I give away my extrinsic value it's
5205.28s: just gone where is if instead I wanted to get out of the short calls if I wanted to monetize the
5212.08s: position I would just sell it again remember I originally bought this option but I would just sell it
5219.20s: because if I sell it I get both the intrinsic and extrinsic value I get this total value
5227.04s: whereas if I exercise it I only capture this value I don't get the total value so that's why
5237.12s: really exercises so rare because it just financially rarely makes sense the way that you can avoid that
5244.16s: is as you described as the underlying is moving and let's say it continues to accelerate to the upside
5252.80s: all I would do is try to roll out and up, out and up so what that means is if I let's say instead I
5261.68s: sold these 19s or let's say let's go close to time so that we can visualize a roll let's say that I
5268.16s: sold these 20s but I don't actually want to lose the shares what I would do is I would say okay
5275.92s: I can buy this back for $2. I buy these for $2 if I roll these out to something like this
5291.44s: the 22 strike or the 23 strike what I've done is I've increased my upside my basis to the upside
5300.32s: so rather than selling my shares at 20 now if I was forced to sell my shares I would sell them at 23
5307.84s: so it's $300 per one lot that gets unlocked and by repeating this by balancing how far out in time you're
5318.32s: going and stock movement you can wiggle yourself out of a lot of nasty positions so that's what I do
5329.04s: when the short call becomes swallowed. Zover says why not roll the in the money puts like 23 you can get
5336.00s: positive again and the implied move looks like for eight it's because it's I'm not worried about
5343.12s: getting positive on the puts if I roll to something that's in the money now I have another problem
5350.96s: unless it rallies up until that point I'm fucked I now have something that's fairly deep in the
5358.96s: money that's going to get deeper in the money it's going to collect less total value as we get
5365.04s: closer in time because it's going to be less intrinsic value remaining for me to collect and then
5371.36s: if I choose to attempt to manage it by rolling as you go further and further in the money
5377.92s: your rolling choices really get constrained very quickly so that's why I wouldn't roll to in the money
5386.32s: Joshua says
5391.12s: when rolling is that call credit spreads when rolling call credit spreads that are underwater
5398.80s: is there a mathematical equation involving theta to determine the best time to roll this no
5405.76s: there isn't a there again it's because when you think about what what that means what best is could you
5416.00s: define what best is best could mean I want to increase the total profitability of the position
5425.28s: or best could mean I want to collect as much theta as I can best could mean I want to do my best
5433.76s: to reduce the probability of my option getting exercised my point there is all versions of best in
5443.36s: all of those lead to different management decisions so the way that I would navigate that is
5450.88s: actually really simple I would just throw away the idea of like what's totality best and I would just
5457.76s: think of it in terms of like what's best for my current position and what I'm trying to accomplish and
5462.88s: then I would optimize off of that name says I'm a bit confused on how you adjust the basis down
5471.76s: and is the goal to not get assigned when selling cash secured put would we roll the cash secured put
5478.56s: if market falls good question the way that the basis is adjusted on the cash secured put
5487.68s: is through the rolling activity in this scenario that we just eyeballed we were taking what was it
5497.76s: our strike price was 23 or 22 and we took it down to 20 the way that we do that is we sacrifice
5512.48s: some of the premium that we otherwise would collect and instead were prioritizing a basis adjustment
5521.20s: now in the scenario whether or not you want to get assigned really is entirely up to the trader
5528.72s: and what your preferences what your inventory preferences so for example if I were to buy or let's say
5538.80s: that I wanted to buy a hundred shares of game stop and I want to buy on that 266 a lot of times
5548.08s: what I do in instances like this is actually come really close in time and sell something that's
5555.20s: in the money I collect the premium the extra and then I have a really high probability of being assigned
5562.88s: that's a way to make a few bucks to get assigned now there's a problem with that which is there
5568.24s: are plenty of instances where rallies and then you actually didn't get in at the price that you want
5572.80s: so I really only do that if I'm like 50 50 on taking on inventory if I'm like yeah I wouldn't
5578.88s: mind it but I'm not necessarily going for it otherwise I just buy in general the purpose of the
5585.36s: short puts for me at least is to collect the premium it can and a big management decision is
5593.92s: being able to take assignment if you have to but for me I typically don't
5603.04s: so yeah if the market falls my typical preferences to roll that's actually what you see me doing
5608.64s: already because you can see that my prior option here is a 25 and then the current position that's on
5616.00s: in-game stop I'm at the 22's so what I've done is I've already taken myself from the 25 strike
5623.52s: down to the 22's I've already decreased my total basis by 10% plus 15% really which is exactly
5636.00s: why I do that so yeah normally I favor the basis adjustment and it's because I think of it this way
5642.32s: if I get assigned at 25 and I want to sell calls against my shares at 25 how much premium do I get
5652.24s: here I get like 53 cents not bad but it's not really what I want because if I get assigned let's say
5660.64s: at 22 I make double that so I typically try to get basis adjustment over anything else
5670.56s: and it's because when I eventually choose to be assigned then I position myself so that I can
5682.32s: actually sell calls and make like a decent amount of money
5688.88s: adjustment says I meant covered calls in the situation rolling covered calls I want to make the amount
5695.92s: I want to make the most of premium when rolling got it yeah so then you would optimize for how
5702.24s: much premium you get the problem that that typically leads to for people is you don't actually
5708.96s: make that much in premium from rolling decisions especially as you go further and further out in time
5716.08s: so yeah I wouldn't really it's not the way that I typically do it I would typically try to get
5723.04s: out of the in the money stuff and then just open up a new one at the spot that I want but yeah you
5727.92s: could definitely optimize for whichever way you want Zubers says if you had a hundred k and a goal of
5735.68s: getting 50% return on investment in six months how would you best achieve this by trading volume
5741.44s: GME. I don't think it's there I don't think you're going to get 50% in six months based on the current
5756.32s: volume GME unfortunately the the best way to have a shot at doing something like that with like a
5763.44s: reasonable probability of successes if there's a directional play but with volatility
5769.36s: unless you leverage massively and if you leverage massively then obviously the risk of
5775.52s: completely blowing up is there so yeah that's with volatility as it is right now I don't think that
5781.36s: there's like a direct path to that that I would take personally.
5788.72s: No one says is there ever time you would choose to use short spreads or just shorting a call
5795.92s: put in what context do you mean in terms of my game stop position or do you mean in terms of like
5803.12s: trading options in general because they're very different things the way that I trade options
5809.28s: is based on what I call profit mechanisms which are like specific market effects that I'm trying to
5814.16s: capture in game stop actually is its own profit mechanism for me because of some like we'll not
5819.20s: some many of the unique qualities it has so with something like vertical spreads for example
5827.60s: when we're talking short spreads like I wouldn't bother with anything like that in game stop but there
5832.48s: are other strategies that sometimes do call for things like vertical spreads they're just rare
5839.84s: I don't really use them that much and it's because in general I don't prefer them they give you the
5846.64s: worst of like multiple worlds so I typically avoid stuff like verticals.
5855.76s: Not a good question though. Awesome super sweet hanging out with you guys it is time for me to
5863.36s: bounce go grab some dinner I will see you guys on the stream next Saturday we do these every single
5868.64s: Saturday and then for those that are in the Patreon tomorrow we have market prep to get ready for
5874.16s: the week ahead and then as always my Sunday video drop will be out tomorrow as well.
5878.80s: In the newsletter ton of stuff happened tomorrow be an ally see you guys later
