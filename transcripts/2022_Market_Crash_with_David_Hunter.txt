11.28s: yeah thank you eric glad to be back
13.76s: so we were talking before we started
15.76s: just a little bit about the stuff that's
17.28s: going on in you know ukraine and russia
19.36s: which is just a very fascinating
22.32s: start to 2022. um you know we were just
26.16s: talking a little bit about how that's
27.44s: looked so far but one of the things i'm
29.68s: curious to dive into
31.36s: dovetailing off of that initial
32.80s: conversation is how does that impact the
35.68s: markets in your eyes there's a lot of
38.40s: things that obviously russia contributes
40.80s: natural gas
42.40s: things like that just curious from a
44.08s: broad perspective what does that look
45.44s: like to you and
47.04s: how does this play out throughout the
48.40s: rest of the year
50.00s: yeah for sure i mean they've certainly
51.92s: pushed the commodity prices up higher
54.64s: you know oil obviously had the spike
57.20s: um and it just creates a lot of
59.76s: uncertainty which markets don't like the
62.24s: amazing thing is that almost
64.96s: to the day that russia invaded
67.76s: um ukraine
69.60s: the market started rallying so i mean
71.84s: this is a classic example of
74.64s: sell the rumor by the news you know and
78.16s: um and basically i think
80.96s: there there still is plenty of
82.40s: uncertainty but i think the market was
84.16s: able to wrap their arms around
86.48s: the fact that we kind of see what this
88.72s: is going to be
90.08s: um you know barring some unforeseen
92.72s: thing that drags us into some kind of a
94.48s: world war
96.32s: i think they pretty quickly kind of
98.24s: surmised yes we can deal with this
100.88s: yes it's going to cause an inflation
103.12s: spike and cause you know some shortages
105.44s: etc but
107.92s: you know markets are pretty amazing in
109.68s: terms of kind of discounting things very
112.08s: quickly
113.12s: and i think that's what they've done
115.12s: um unless this thing really escalates
117.60s: again
118.56s: uh i think you've seen you know the
120.80s: effect of ukraine and russia already
125.04s: and now the big thing is if they can get
127.20s: a negotiated settlement and i by no
129.52s: means say that's a given but if that
131.52s: happens over the next month
133.44s: next few weeks
134.80s: um i think you will see
137.28s: that will help the markets you know that
139.76s: it has
140.72s: even though we've rallied since they
142.80s: they went in there there was plenty
144.72s: holding the market back in you know
146.64s: january february prior to the rally that
149.84s: i think had something to do with the
151.44s: risks in ukraine so so i i think if we
154.40s: get ukraine
155.68s: resolved
157.04s: um and it's some sort of a solution that
158.88s: looks like it can last
160.72s: uh i think that will take us you know up
163.36s: sharply to maybe maybe to my my targets
167.84s: interesting and it leads to kind of a
169.84s: following question so and you alluded to
172.00s: some of it um being the
174.56s: quality of the peace talks but is there
178.24s: a scenario where you think you know
180.96s: russian ukraine have these peace talks
182.88s: and the market doesn't like the outcome
185.28s: what kind of thing would have to happen
186.80s: for there to be a negative reaction to
189.12s: that in your opinion
191.36s: yeah it's
192.32s: i think anything short of
194.56s: dragging nato into this
197.28s: probably the market just has handled and
200.24s: discounted got it if if it becomes
202.88s: something that widens to the point where
204.88s: it looks like the us is stepping in or
206.96s: nato's stepping in
208.88s: uh that is something i think the markets
210.96s: would be shaken up by and
213.52s: certainly possible but at this point
215.36s: doesn't look like the most probable
216.88s: scenario
218.16s: yeah and then the other just last part
220.24s: on that out of curiosity do you think
222.56s: the markets or how do you think the
224.48s: markets would react to china potentially
227.28s: interacting because obviously we've been
228.56s: talking about the us interacting with
230.80s: russian ukraine there's been some back
232.48s: talk of china but i'm just curious you
234.16s: know your thoughts on that
235.92s: yeah my my sense is china is smart
238.40s: enough to know that they'll they'll
241.44s: support russia in in kind of subtle ways
244.48s: or in you know back channel ways
247.20s: they're smart enough to know
249.04s: you know an awful lot of their their
250.80s: breath is buttered by us uh
253.60s: you know dollars and yeah and uh you
256.48s: know do we want to jeopardize our
258.40s: economy
259.68s: to support a situation like this i think
262.08s: they're probably you know if
264.40s: if they didn't have to worry about that
266.40s: they'd be in there probably very
268.40s: supportive i think they're trying to
270.00s: walk a line right now clearly they're
272.64s: you know they're cozying up to russia
274.72s: russia's closing up to them
276.80s: but they're still trying to appear like
279.68s: um you know they're not they're not
281.44s: pushing this um they're not vocally
284.00s: against it but they're certainly not you
286.16s: know coming in with both feet saying
287.68s: yeah we're we're here with you right
289.76s: so i i think they understand
292.24s: um we we have some leverage over them
294.32s: too
296.64s: yeah and i think that that's one of the
298.80s: things i was actually talking a couple
300.16s: friends about is there's a saying i'm
302.16s: sure you've heard it you know the enemy
303.76s: of my enemy is my friend
305.44s: and you know right now us isn't
307.84s: necessarily the first pick for either
310.08s: russia or china in a broad sense
312.56s: in terms of alliances and whatnot but it
314.80s: does seem like china's in this very
316.32s: precarious spot because i know that they
318.80s: again our economies are so intertwined
321.36s: and i find that to be such a
323.52s: interesting add-in to
326.40s: defense measures you know we're talking
328.48s: about one country invading another and
330.16s: then the global stance against that and
332.72s: then there's still this backdrop behind
334.40s: it um
336.08s: just for my own edification
338.48s: if china did decide to back russia more
342.88s: openly personally i don't see that
345.20s: really happening but if it were to
347.28s: happen what kind of you know
349.36s: follow-through do you think we would see
350.88s: across the economy and just the
352.64s: marketplace that whole at large
355.20s: yeah would certainly indicate that china
356.88s: was becoming more aggressive
359.12s: uh and not not
360.88s: you know sizing it up as you know
363.52s: what's the economic cost to us etcetera
365.76s: and they're basically i think they'd be
368.08s: coming
369.12s: uh be becoming more
371.60s: open
372.48s: about their alliance with russia i mean
374.72s: we all know
375.76s: you know two communist nations that
378.48s: are much closer to each other than they
380.32s: are to us but but i think they still
382.72s: want to appear to be that
384.88s: country that is not the aggressor that
387.04s: is yes they're building a strong defense
390.08s: and yes you know there are signs that
392.00s: they're getting more aggressive but i
394.00s: think that would be a crossing of the
395.68s: line that would
397.92s: the markets would take that pretty
399.36s: negatively
401.76s: yeah the other big the other big issue
405.04s: with all of this obviously are the
406.88s: sanctions and the fact that we're
409.92s: kind of
411.20s: you know pushing
413.28s: um these these large countries and
416.00s: countries that do a lot of world trade
418.80s: away from the dollar
420.64s: and you know we're we're really not
423.36s: necessarily i'm not sure if that was all
425.36s: well thought out
426.88s: uh in terms of when you know when they
428.88s: took the
430.16s: um the last steps
432.32s: um they're really you're seeing
434.08s: obviously
435.60s: russia's backing the ruble with some
437.92s: sort of a gold backing and yeah and
440.24s: china's
441.28s: i think
442.32s: celebrating the fact that the dollar is
444.00s: becoming
445.20s: uh
446.00s: you know under fire a little bit here
447.84s: and that you know some settlements even
450.00s: even
450.80s: saudi arabia is talking about settling
453.36s: uh you know oil contracts in china
456.72s: in in yuan so i mean i i think we are
460.96s: seeing some fallout from those sanctions
463.68s: that i think are not necessarily the
465.92s: smartest things we could have done
468.00s: um but you know again the market seems
470.72s: to be handling it so
472.48s: it's more i think that's more of a
474.80s: it may speed up
476.64s: an inevitable thing that was going to
478.08s: happen that the you know doll was going
479.76s: to lose some reserve status down the
481.52s: road i continue to say i think it's
484.24s: farther down the road than some of the
486.56s: you know some of the bears think i i
488.48s: think you're still probably several you
490.40s: know five years away from anything
493.28s: that really impacts our our um
496.80s: leadership as a reserve currency
499.76s: yeah and it's funny because that was the
501.68s: following point i was going to ask you
503.12s: especially as it pertains to the swift
504.96s: banking system and um some of those
508.00s: impacts do you think that if
510.96s: you know russia and ukraine come to
513.68s: a peace agreement do you think that
516.16s: those sanctions will be backed off
518.64s: and if so what would the impact to the
521.36s: market be in that scenario or do you
523.20s: think the sanctions would remain in
524.64s: place and kind of tailor it off over
526.40s: time
527.36s: yeah i think it's going to be probably
529.84s: um
531.20s: reduced over time i i think we'd be
534.56s: we'd be foolish to accept the you know
537.60s: any agreement
539.12s: in uh you know and swallow the whole
541.36s: thing all at once as if we we can trust
544.16s: putin we really can't right however i do
547.60s: think they will it'll probably be part
549.92s: of the settlement is that there will be
551.44s: certain give and take on the part of you
553.68s: know nato too
555.28s: um so i would think some of those
556.96s: sanctions will be you know pulled away
559.68s: and some some left in place and pulled
562.00s: away slowly um i i would think
565.68s: um
566.56s: you know the swift situation would be
568.80s: resolved
570.40s: early i i don't know that but i would
572.96s: think
573.68s: you know because that that hurts
575.28s: everybody so right
578.16s: yeah it felt like at one point it really
580.08s: did feel like putin was kind of playing
582.40s: chess while we were playing checkers i
584.00s: don't know if you saw the the video that
585.92s: he put out
587.04s: um you know
588.88s: he he he had a fascinating video i'll
591.28s: i'll throw it in the link to the video
592.64s: here for people want to check it out and
594.48s: you know i'm paraphrasing so definitely
596.24s: check out the source directly but um it
598.80s: was to the effect of this is why we
601.28s: can't trust the dollar because they
603.36s: choose to do things like this
605.36s: and it's you look at that and you're
607.36s: like
608.72s: the guy's not wrong you know what i mean
610.40s: like i could see a lot of people look at
612.32s: that saying well yeah how safe is this
615.20s: if they can just choose to
617.44s: react like this
619.04s: and i was like i was kind of you know
621.44s: it's like well well played because
623.36s: that's a really effective
626.08s: line of thought
627.44s: if you really think about it in the last
629.84s: several years we've chosen to say
632.64s: particularly with russia in particular
634.72s: russia
635.68s: we've chosen to say rather than get into
638.16s: any kind of armed conflict with these
640.00s: guys we're going to throw our weight
641.28s: around with the dollar and with with our
644.08s: economic weight right and you know we're
646.72s: going to sanction and hurt the oligarchs
649.12s: etc
650.48s: and i he probably had calculated some of
653.36s: this ahead of time in terms of saying
655.20s: you know i i think we can get them to
658.40s: move
659.36s: and actually in the long run hurt
660.88s: themselves here so we'll see
663.04s: but i i don't think what we did is
665.44s: without risk
667.04s: yeah i i think that's a literally a
669.12s: perfect characterization there
671.60s: um
672.64s: so
673.60s: that leads you were talking a little bit
675.52s: about your your forecasts how could we
678.64s: not talk about those
680.40s: so you know last time we were talking in
683.28s: early december you know you were
685.68s: messaging about uh the melt up you
689.84s: obviously had your levels in place there
692.72s: and then a preceding global bust of some
695.92s: sort you know potentially to the
697.68s: magnitude of you know an 80 drawdown
700.64s: obviously you know things change and new
704.00s: information comes in so i would be
706.72s: curious just to get an update on that
708.32s: i've seen a couple your twitter posts
709.92s: but obviously i always enjoy
711.84s: hearing the um you know the overall
714.64s: thought from from you directly so i'd
716.32s: love to hear just from a
718.32s: macro standpoint um what are you
720.64s: thinking about the markets here
722.56s: yeah the forecast hasn't really changed
724.40s: i still believe we're going to see a
726.08s: melt up to 6 000 on the s pe 20 thousand
729.60s: on the nasty actually i should say since
731.28s: we talked
732.64s: in my january letter which came out the
734.80s: first week of january
736.48s: i did raise my target so my target i
739.44s: think in december was 5300 s p
742.72s: yeah
745.92s: nasdaq and i'm now twenty thousand
748.00s: nasdaq
749.28s: six thousand s p kind of um forty forty
752.40s: five thousand dow
754.08s: um which had been 42 i think so so i
757.36s: definitely got more aggressive on the
759.12s: upside
760.32s: um my 80 bear market and global bust has
764.40s: not changed at all
766.24s: if anything
767.60s: um it has stretched out a bit because of
770.24s: ukraine you know the um you know the
772.80s: correction in the first couple months
774.32s: this year i actually forecasted that
776.64s: um but what i
778.40s: obviously didn't know
780.00s: back in december was that we were going
782.08s: to have you know the russia invaded
784.96s: ukraine so that
786.40s: that has
787.52s: probably changed the timing a bit not a
789.36s: lot i was kind of saying we could see
792.48s: the 6000 s p by mid-year this year
796.16s: um and
797.84s: that's still possible um i'd say more
800.80s: likely it pushes it out into the summer
802.88s: further
803.84s: um and
805.60s: the
806.40s: the bust is probably a fourth quarter
808.72s: event and again
811.12s: not that it all happens people on
812.80s: twitter will go well you're talking
815.12s: about 2023 now and i said well it starts
817.92s: in 2022 but it's a it's a year-long
820.64s: process you know you don't go through a
822.00s: bust which is a severe economic downturn
825.52s: in a couple months it's not the market
827.20s: it's the economy so it'll probably start
830.48s: later this year maybe fourth quarter and
833.68s: carry through
835.28s: at least mid-year next year maybe much
837.44s: of next year you know
839.44s: it's going to be in my opinion the worst
841.04s: downturn in the post-world war ii era so
844.64s: you know worst downturn since the great
846.40s: depression
847.68s: um but not a depression not something
849.92s: that lasts over many many years but
852.16s: rather something that probably is
854.00s: contained within about a year um and
856.72s: then the bear market uh peak trough is
859.20s: about 80 percent
860.88s: uh again we haven't seen anything like
862.64s: that in post-world war two era
865.12s: last time i think we were down 60 some
867.12s: odd percent
868.64s: in
869.60s: nine so this is worse than that
872.32s: um and i i think a lot of the problems
874.96s: are global
876.56s: uh are outside the us
878.80s: so whereas 2008 nine our banks were
881.84s: really the ones that took it on the chin
883.36s: and were in the worst shape
885.52s: this time around our banks kind of got
887.60s: religion because of what happened in
889.04s: 2008 nine
890.80s: and the real problems now are more the
893.28s: european banks are in you know rough
895.36s: shape
896.48s: particularly after what's happened in
897.92s: this first quarter of this year
900.24s: uh with ukraine um and the canadian
904.00s: banks are not you know they were much
906.32s: more pristine back in 2008 nine they're
908.96s: more like we were then they're kind of
911.44s: extended
912.80s: australia's got some issues um their
915.92s: real estate through the roof
917.68s: um so you've got i think lots of banking
920.88s: issues and financial issues
922.96s: uh that are outside this country so this
925.12s: people have to remember this is
926.96s: even though my focus is u.s
929.60s: this is going to be a global bust it's
931.52s: not it's not just the us
935.44s: obviously a ton to unpack there um so
939.36s: going into the overall flow of the
942.48s: market kind of this melt up and then a
944.48s: bust
945.60s: from a secular standpoint what do you
948.32s: think leads the melt up and then what do
951.28s: you think leads the bust
954.72s: yeah the melt up is i i've said for a
957.92s: long time i believe this is the
960.80s: culmination of a 40-year bull market so
964.48s: in august of 1982 the dow was at 780
968.40s: 786 maybe um
970.88s: and there's now you know in the mid 30s
973.92s: uh so it had a huge run in the last 40
976.64s: years you know uh s p endow and that was
980.08s: that same thing
981.60s: you know huge runs
984.16s: driven by the fact that we went from 15
986.48s: percent
987.52s: long bond 15 10 year 20 t-bill rates 20
991.68s: actually 21 t-bill rates back in the
994.32s: early 80s
995.60s: and we took it all the way down to last
997.92s: year we were at 40 basis points on the
1000.16s: 10-year
1001.36s: and basically zero on short rates
1003.76s: um so that big drop in rates over many
1006.72s: decades
1008.16s: was the wind at the back of the market
1010.48s: because that just pushed pe multiples
1012.48s: price earnings multiples up
1014.64s: we're at the point now where you know
1017.12s: not right now but within the next year
1019.68s: we're going to probably bottom out rates
1021.60s: for the cycle meaning for the last 40
1024.40s: years
1025.60s: and
1026.72s: um
1027.84s: pe multiples will be going in the
1029.28s: opposite direction
1032.24s: so
1033.12s: it's funny so yeah not to throw you off
1035.60s: sorry um two of the things you just
1037.28s: mentioned i just had a couple charts you
1039.04s: know that i pulled from uh long-term
1041.12s: trends but anyways
1042.64s: this top one is p e ratio just as you
1044.64s: were talking about and then this bottom
1046.32s: one looks at the s p 500 index to the
1050.08s: total bond return index so kind of two
1052.96s: two trends that you were talking about
1054.72s: just visualized here where we're seeing
1057.60s: sorry go ahead
1059.04s: yeah i said sure yeah the the rate is
1061.36s: coming down polishes stocks higher all
1063.52s: things being equal obviously you have
1066.00s: periods
1067.20s: of recession where earnings go down so
1070.48s: even though rates are low uh stocks go
1073.20s: down but overall it's been a circular
1075.60s: bull market since 1982
1078.24s: i think it comes to an end this year
1080.72s: um and i think the last leg of that um
1084.16s: bull market
1085.68s: will be parabolic so
1087.76s: you could argue we've been in a
1089.12s: parabolic melting up since
1091.12s: um you know 2020 since the march lows in
1094.80s: 2020 it's been a hell of a ride it was a
1097.52s: doubling in the market off those lows
1100.32s: um but this last leg which i think um
1104.00s: begins probably in the next month
1106.64s: uh will
1108.48s: take the s p up to 6 000
1111.12s: maybe higher than 6 000 even you know
1113.52s: not not a lot higher but it could go
1115.04s: higher than that
1116.32s: um
1117.20s: and will be pretty straight up you know
1119.12s: it's going to be a very vertical rally
1120.88s: so as steep as the run has been since
1123.76s: march 2020
1125.44s: this last two years this last run is
1128.08s: going to be steeper so it means you
1130.00s: cover more ground in a shorter time
1131.76s: amount of time type of thing
1134.40s: so a steep slope and and basically i
1137.60s: think it's a little hard for people to
1139.76s: understand
1141.20s: why when we're staring at a fed that's
1143.04s: talking about you know six or seven
1144.96s: hikes this year and pulling money out of
1147.20s: the
1148.24s: out of the economy you know um
1150.72s: uh shrinking their balance sheet it's a
1153.28s: little hard for people to
1155.52s: grasp why that would be bullish
1158.08s: and all i can say is history tells you
1160.56s: that
1161.84s: as the economy slows and i think we've
1163.76s: already done i keep saying this
1166.16s: the bond market has done the tightening
1168.00s: already everybody's acting like the fed
1170.56s: is just starting a tightening cycle
1172.88s: i think we're coming to the end of the
1174.32s: tightening cycle the bond market did it
1176.72s: uh over the course of the last several
1178.88s: months
1179.92s: uh you know we've got an inverted yield
1181.52s: curve can get a little bit more inverted
1183.84s: but i think
1185.20s: given the fragility in the system
1186.96s: because of the pandemic
1188.80s: and given the leverage in the system
1190.40s: that's been building for decades
1193.36s: i think this economy can
1195.60s: can be hurt
1196.88s: much faster
1198.80s: by rising rates than would be normal so
1201.12s: in other words a slightly inverted curve
1203.92s: might not have had the same impact in uh
1207.36s: the last cycle or the cycle before that
1210.08s: but i think you know given with that
1212.24s: what's
1213.36s: you know the fragility has been built in
1214.88s: by a pandemic
1216.56s: that this time around
1218.72s: that is enough tightening to really send
1220.96s: things negative and i think the surprise
1223.76s: may be that we'll see negative gdp in
1226.16s: the second quarter
1227.92s: and that the fed will look at that and
1230.08s: say hey maybe maybe we can't do all
1232.32s: these hikes that we're talking about
1234.88s: um
1236.16s: the other risk what i'm hearing lately
1238.88s: which i think could be
1240.56s: part of the story for the bust
1242.80s: is you're hearing the fed talk about
1245.36s: some fed officials anyway talking about
1248.16s: well maybe we'll pause on rates at some
1250.96s: point you know we'll hike for you know
1253.60s: a little bit here but that
1255.76s: you know maybe we shouldn't focus on
1257.60s: rates maybe we really need to
1259.60s: kind of shrink our balance sheet a
1261.12s: little bit bring that back down into a
1262.88s: more normal period
1264.88s: i'm a monetarist and i can tell you
1267.04s: that's
1268.24s: that's the message i would i would uh
1271.44s: not want to hear
1273.04s: um in terms of that could be what really
1276.56s: brings on a bust you pull money out of
1278.88s: the system and you're going to see it's
1280.96s: you know for some reason an awful lot of
1283.36s: economists think interest rates are the
1285.04s: key i think money is the key and if you
1287.44s: pull money out you're going to see it
1289.52s: reflected in a much weaker economy
1293.20s: it's interesting do you think that that
1294.64s: might be why jerome powell's been
1296.48s: messaging so hard around interest rates
1299.04s: because you bring up a good point they
1300.72s: did bring up you know potential
1302.80s: tightening of their their spending but
1306.24s: it always seems like that's i wouldn't
1308.16s: call it secondary but not the primary
1310.00s: focus of their conversations they really
1311.84s: seem to be centered on rates do you
1313.92s: think that's on purpose to try and like
1316.16s: steer the thought process a little bit
1318.48s: or just curious what yeah yeah i i think
1322.40s: forever for as long as i've been a fed
1324.32s: watcher which goes back to 1973
1327.44s: um
1328.56s: interest rates seem to be the focal
1330.32s: point uh
1332.16s: for most economists and for the fed
1334.80s: typically
1336.00s: um and they do they do mess around with
1338.24s: the balance sheet they do you know they
1340.08s: do understand
1341.52s: you know pumping money into the system
1343.44s: or pulling money out is tightening or
1345.44s: easing easing or tightening
1347.28s: um so that's not new
1349.52s: uh and i don't think he was trying to
1351.52s: you know i don't think what we're seeing
1353.28s: is anything different just remember
1354.88s: we've had a balance sheet grow
1357.04s: to
1357.76s: nine trillion dollars
1359.60s: from
1360.40s: you know 3.7 trillion
1362.80s: um back in march 2020 so it's growing
1366.40s: five trillion dollars
1368.08s: and
1368.96s: so of course and you know
1371.52s: in
1372.64s: 2008 october 2008 it was 875 billion
1376.72s: so we've gone up you know eight trillion
1379.52s: dollars from there
1381.36s: um
1382.24s: so we're we're looking at money in in
1384.48s: terms of the balance sheet of the fed
1387.04s: at levels that
1388.40s: nobody could have ever fathomed just a
1391.36s: couple of years ago
1393.44s: so of course they're saying maybe we
1395.28s: need to rein some of that in we did a
1397.04s: lot of that because of the
1398.96s: pandemic and and all the you know the
1401.84s: things we were worried about so i think
1404.24s: that's normal what they're doing it
1406.16s: makes sense
1407.44s: i just worry
1409.28s: that we may find out
1411.52s: and i use that word fragility a lot we
1414.16s: may find out that the economy is just
1417.28s: not resilient enough
1419.28s: to withstand even a little bit of that
1422.08s: kind of um
1423.92s: you know
1424.88s: tightening of money
1426.96s: and same thing with rates you know
1429.36s: normally when you've got inflation
1431.36s: pushing five six seven percent
1434.32s: normally you'd expect to see rates
1436.24s: pushing
1437.12s: five six seven percent to rain right in
1440.00s: and i don't think this economy can
1441.76s: withstand much beyond where we are so i
1444.96s: mean i think that's that's what's
1447.04s: different this time
1448.80s: um and those are dangerous words but i
1451.44s: really think we are a much more fragile
1453.76s: system
1454.88s: and fragile means we can unwind much
1457.52s: faster
1458.48s: and surprisingly and and in in a
1461.20s: surprising way
1462.88s: uh that you know we just don't have
1465.12s: precedent for
1468.08s: speaking of not having precedent for
1470.16s: what do you think about you mentioned it
1471.84s: already but
1472.96s: i wanted to talk about it explicitly
1474.80s: what do you think about just the overall
1476.80s: leverage that we see in the markets
1478.88s: right now obviously there's um a bunch
1481.52s: of different metrics out there that tied
1483.92s: to the essentially leverage right now
1486.40s: being at
1487.44s: untold levels before do you think
1490.24s: that plays into your rapid meltdown
1494.32s: bust concept or does it
1497.52s: draw things out potentially if they
1499.28s: start unwinding earlier and bringing
1501.36s: leverage down because we saw a little
1502.72s: bit of that too with real margin debt
1505.84s: plummeting a ton you know essentially
1508.64s: from late 2020 into this year so just
1511.76s: curious what the role of leverage in
1513.60s: your opinion has into your forecast
1516.40s: yeah i i mean it's key to my forecast my
1519.36s: my whole definition of bust comes from
1522.64s: the fact that we have as i say my
1524.64s: equation is
1526.96s: massive leverage
1528.80s: plus fragility in the system
1531.28s: um
1532.16s: equals bust i mean you basically
1535.04s: um you know we're we're off the charts
1536.88s: there's no even 2008 nine didn't have
1539.60s: the leverage we have today and i i use
1542.80s: leverage
1543.84s: i define leverage as two things one the
1546.48s: leverage of the economy which is debt
1548.48s: you know we've got 300 trillion by the
1550.80s: way we've gone from 250 trillion in
1552.96s: global debt to 300 trillion in two years
1555.84s: we've added 50 trillion because of the
1557.68s: pandemic that's a huge jump yeah well um
1561.68s: and so we've got 300 trillion in debt
1565.60s: and then we've got
1567.20s: uh quadrillion the notional value of
1569.36s: derivatives and derivatives are a form
1571.60s: of leverage on markets whether they be
1574.48s: fixed income markets whether they be
1576.24s: equity markets there's so many different
1578.08s: derivative products out there
1580.24s: and
1581.28s: an awful lot of counterparty risk etc so
1584.48s: what leverage is just
1586.40s: very much added risk to the system when
1589.28s: you have massive leverage to the degree
1591.04s: we do
1592.24s: it's just much higher risk
1594.48s: um and so i do think
1596.96s: um you know in business school you learn
1598.88s: that leverage
1600.32s: on the way up can enhance returns on the
1602.96s: way down it really exacerbates the
1605.04s: losses so
1606.48s: um what i think we'll see
1608.32s: is that you're not going to reduce
1609.76s: leverage in any meaningful way
1612.24s: deliberately
1613.92s: um
1614.80s: you know margin that's a different story
1616.40s: margin that when your market's correct
1619.36s: you know um some margin you see some
1622.32s: turnaround and margin because it's
1623.68s: pretty quick you know you get margin
1624.96s: calls you get you know that stuff gets
1627.04s: liquidated quickly and reduces the
1629.12s: margin so you did have a step down um
1632.80s: but in the overall debt
1634.80s: the way that gets liquidated is
1637.56s: involuntarily
1639.28s: right and downturns so and that's what
1642.00s: makes downturn so
1644.80s: so bad i mean that's why a downturn can
1647.20s: turn into something much worse when
1649.20s: you've got this kind of leverage on the
1650.64s: system so i do think you're going to see
1652.72s: a lot of involuntary debt liquidation
1655.44s: during this next down cycle
1658.32s: but it won't be
1659.92s: unlike a lot of
1661.84s: strategists and economists out there
1664.48s: i am not saying this is the high water
1666.48s: mark in depth
1667.84s: i believe the high water mark in debt
1670.40s: will be much higher than we are we're
1672.40s: you know if we're 300 trillion today in
1674.64s: global debt
1676.00s: i believe
1677.36s: in you know before the end of this
1678.80s: decade we'll probably be closer to 450
1682.72s: or 500 trillion
1684.64s: and the reason i can say that
1687.28s: is because i think the response to the
1689.84s: bust
1691.52s: keep in mind i'm talking about major
1693.04s: bank failures you know major banks in
1694.88s: europe and wherever else asia australia
1698.32s: canada wherever major bank failure is
1700.64s: coming at you all at once
1702.80s: there's only one tool they have
1705.36s: um to deal with that and that is to
1707.76s: print money like there's no tomorrow and
1710.64s: combined with
1712.08s: massive um fiscal
1715.12s: expansion so you get a lot of what you
1717.12s: saw in march
1718.56s: april of 2020
1720.40s: you'll get that times
1722.24s: you know what times five times 10.
1724.72s: so
1725.44s: i don't know if the printers can handle
1727.04s: that
1728.56s: right
1729.36s: no i don't know if any anybody's gonna
1731.36s: be able to handle this but it's it's the
1733.44s: only thing that's the only game in town
1735.92s: if they wait if they say okay we're
1738.56s: gonna we're gonna sit and deliberate you
1740.80s: know we're gonna go to congress and let
1742.32s: them figure this out
1744.24s: the system will be bust by the times you
1746.24s: get by the time you get something
1747.52s: figured out i mean they moved pretty
1748.96s: fast in march 2020.
1751.36s: uh the fed certainly did and congress
1753.36s: came along behind them fairly quickly
1755.36s: for congress yeah but but when you got
1757.92s: banks failing and and one after another
1760.40s: in a domino effect
1762.24s: you don't have time to say let's let's
1764.48s: deliberate and figure out what policy
1766.40s: makes sense here all you can do is shove
1768.64s: money out the door and hope you can
1770.16s: stabilize now they'll you know they'll
1771.92s: do what they can to declare moratoriums
1774.24s: and what have you
1775.84s: but
1776.64s: it's going to be money times 10 i mean
1779.12s: you know that's why i say we could see a
1781.44s: 30 trillion dollar
1783.44s: um fed balance sheet
1785.76s: and by the time we get to 2024
1788.64s: it's wild it's i like
1791.28s: that smile to even conceive
1793.60s: and so what that does is that just sets
1795.76s: you up for
1797.12s: you know
1798.16s: problems down the road it's not that it
1800.00s: fixes anything
1801.36s: it just it postpones the
1804.00s: you know the reckoning day
1806.48s: so do you think that's the game plan
1807.68s: here because again like i think it's
1809.84s: always easy to look at
1812.88s: what the government in general at large
1815.60s: is doing to solve problems and poke
1817.76s: holes and say you know there's a better
1819.28s: way to do this here a better way to do
1820.72s: that there do you i assume
1823.76s: the fed is wise enough to at least
1826.96s: perceive some of the proverbial kicking
1829.92s: the can down the road what do you think
1832.16s: their game plan is here is it just to
1834.24s: kick the can down the road as long as
1836.00s: they can postpone it until the bust
1837.76s: inevitably occurs or do you think that
1840.00s: they're hoping that there's a solution
1841.44s: along the way
1842.96s: yeah i i think they are doing
1845.36s: what they can within their models i mean
1847.60s: they get
1848.56s: you know they get data every day and
1850.48s: they're looking at you know when they
1851.84s: have their meetings they're looking at
1853.36s: reams of of
1855.28s: data and they're trying to read the tea
1857.92s: leaves like everybody else like every
1859.60s: economist try to figure out
1861.92s: um what's the path we're on
1864.56s: and what do we do to make sure we don't
1866.96s: you know fall off that path or you know
1870.08s: make things worse so they're
1872.08s: they're legitimately trying to do the
1874.56s: right thing
1876.32s: i know they have lost credibility with a
1878.96s: lot of people and you know there's
1880.80s: plenty of critics out there but frankly
1883.36s: if you were in there if you were in
1884.80s: powell's shoes
1886.80s: you'd
1887.60s: you can only do so much i mean you can't
1889.92s: say
1890.72s: hey let's let's just
1892.40s: throw this model away and start over you
1894.72s: can't do it you know as i say if you if
1897.44s: you did what the austrian
1899.60s: school
1900.56s: recommends
1902.08s: we'd all be living in caves i mean you
1903.92s: can't just say let's go on a gold
1905.52s: standard or let's do something to put
1907.92s: discipline in system you've got to deal
1910.08s: with the cards you've been dealt and
1912.40s: and the cards we've been dealt is
1914.56s: massive leverage
1916.40s: uh you know an economy that now is
1918.96s: showing inflation breaking out etc so
1921.68s: what they're what they're trying to do
1924.40s: and they are a consensus building um
1927.20s: operation the other committee is
1930.16s: you know they work it's not like one guy
1931.92s: dictates it's the whole committee and
1934.08s: what they're trying to do is sort out
1935.68s: all the data
1937.28s: and say okay
1938.48s: how can we kind of bring this down in a
1941.04s: way that's not going to disrupt
1943.28s: everything so that's why it's kind of
1945.60s: the gradual as you go quarter point
1947.68s: hikes maybe a half point hike here or
1949.76s: there
1950.56s: um yeah that's all nice i just don't
1952.88s: think it's gonna
1954.24s: they're gonna be able to live that out
1955.92s: you know i i think ultimately things are
1958.40s: gonna change
1959.60s: their expectations but they
1961.44s: i have no doubt they are sincerely
1963.28s: trying to do things
1964.88s: right
1965.84s: right but by everybody and they've got
1968.40s: obviously they've got to balance
1971.04s: unemployment or jobs
1973.36s: and inflation and right now inflation's
1976.24s: kind of
1977.28s: you know and we've got center court and
1979.84s: everybody's paying attention to that and
1981.36s: they're they're hearing from
1983.44s: lots of constituencies that
1985.52s: you know you've got to fix this
1987.12s: inflation so that's kind of taken
1989.28s: precedence
1990.40s: a little bit over you know worrying
1992.08s: about the economy uh my my forecast
1994.88s: basically is based on the fact that i
1996.56s: think within the next few months
1999.52s: the economy is going to take precedence
2001.12s: again
2002.40s: we're back at it small technical
2004.00s: difficulty but we work through it um
2007.20s: so conveniently we are coming up on time
2009.76s: here um i definitely don't want to
2011.84s: overkeep you got family and that always
2014.24s: comes first so there's two two last
2016.32s: things i wanted to talk to you about
2017.52s: quickly
2018.64s: um the first one is when i think about
2021.76s: your forecast kind of this melt up and
2024.16s: bust concept
2025.60s: i see a lot of
2027.60s: varying strength and weaknesses across
2030.24s: different sectors and i'm curious if
2033.20s: there are any sectors in particular that
2035.36s: you think will lead the melt up and if
2038.80s: there are any sectors that you think
2040.80s: will lead the bus you mentioned banks
2042.80s: financials before but i'm curious if you
2044.96s: have any specific thoughts on those
2047.52s: yeah first uh for the melt up i think
2050.32s: it's going to be a very broad melt up i
2052.24s: know
2052.96s: for a lot of people they've kind of been
2056.16s: told and are believing that we're going
2058.56s: to see a very narrow market any any
2061.20s: rally that's left is narrow i think
2063.28s: we're going to broaden out here so i
2064.96s: think a lot of things are going to play
2066.48s: growth is going to play value's going to
2068.24s: play
2069.12s: at the same time
2070.64s: uh large caps going to play so is small
2073.12s: cap i think the russell can go to 3 000
2075.84s: so that's you know that's a big move
2077.44s: from here
2078.48s: um
2079.44s: i think you're going to see you know the
2081.52s: big cap tech
2083.36s: you know the fang stocks do quite well
2086.80s: i think you're going to see small cap
2088.32s: tech you know
2089.84s: the kathy wood type stocks do
2092.40s: do okay maybe do quite well
2095.44s: i think industrials are going to play
2096.96s: for sure commodities are going to
2098.40s: continue to play
2100.08s: i think you can see some of the early
2101.84s: cycle things like autos and and airlines
2104.80s: play
2105.76s: uh as we you know focus on the fact that
2108.24s: the economy is reopening and
2110.80s: you know this new omicron strain isn't
2112.72s: shutting anything down and actually
2114.48s: we're opening up um so i think it's
2116.88s: going to be a broad base the areas that
2119.12s: probably will lag will be defensive
2121.76s: uh so utilities and maybe staples
2124.96s: um but otherwise i think the cyclicals
2127.84s: do very well
2129.20s: i love semis i think semis will do very
2131.52s: well again it's not straight from here i
2133.76s: think we've had a very nice rally in the
2135.68s: last three weeks
2137.28s: so you could see um
2140.00s: you know a pullback here
2141.76s: of you know five to ten percent
2144.32s: depending on the the sector
2146.48s: um
2147.44s: and uh
2149.12s: i think um
2151.44s: you know
2152.40s: the
2154.00s: the semis and the fangs will
2156.56s: pull back with everything else so
2158.96s: um but then on the other side of this
2162.08s: once you get to the top
2164.72s: with an 80 bear market
2166.96s: you're going to see an awful lot of
2168.72s: things get hit so it's it's going to be
2170.64s: broad-based on the other side too
2172.88s: i don't know that anything's going to
2174.80s: get hit worse if the whole if the index
2177.20s: is going down 80 percent pretty much
2178.72s: everything's going down
2180.40s: and going down hard um
2182.96s: though the one thing i would say is that
2185.84s: you know tech is so over owned you know
2188.48s: particularly the fangs and the the you
2190.80s: know the microsoft's in the big cap that
2192.64s: have been
2193.76s: um you know the ownership's been built
2195.60s: over many many years
2197.52s: i think we're at the top when we reach
2199.84s: this top it's the top of that cycle for
2202.16s: those stocks
2203.76s: and they will not be leaders in the next
2205.60s: cycle they will be laggards in the next
2207.36s: cycle so they're going to get hit hard
2209.68s: in the bust along with everything else
2212.16s: the big story of the next cycle is is
2214.24s: going to be an inflation cycle
2216.16s: that will favor
2217.84s: value stocks and
2219.76s: you know everything from energy
2222.32s: i think it's a huge commodity cycle so
2224.40s: everything from energy to metals
2226.48s: um to agriculture
2228.88s: uh and uh the things that will lag will
2231.60s: be the winners of this cycle which would
2233.36s: be you know your fangs
2235.60s: um your growth stocks
2237.68s: you know healthcare those things i think
2239.84s: are going to be laggards in the next
2241.52s: cycle so just understand once we go
2243.36s: through the bust and the bear market
2245.76s: coming out the other side
2247.52s: it's a very different cycle than the one
2249.60s: we've just come through
2251.60s: huge huge point right there and i think
2253.44s: that that's uh like a very important
2255.36s: nuance to your forecast because i think
2258.48s: at least most of my generations the
2260.16s: millennials you know we've just seen
2262.32s: tech that's really what we're so used to
2264.56s: seeing skyrocket tech goes up and other
2267.36s: things sometimes go up so that's a i
2270.48s: think a very interesting call out there
2272.40s: do you think that it's just because they
2273.84s: will become so overvalued they won't be
2275.60s: attractive anymore what do you think
2277.28s: leads tech to not necessarily
2279.68s: participate
2281.12s: that's a great question
2282.72s: the real answer to that is the next
2285.20s: cycle with inflation going from
2288.16s: basically negative i'm calling for a
2290.00s: deflationary bus so as as much as
2292.56s: inflation's on the
2294.08s: everybody's uh you know it's the talk of
2296.48s: the town right now a year from now we'll
2299.44s: be in deflation in my opinion because of
2301.60s: how bad the economy gets hit globally
2304.56s: so it will be a short-lived deflationary
2306.72s: cycle but we'll be in deflation and i
2309.04s: think the 10-year will be down at zero
2311.60s: zero percent tenure i think we're
2313.60s: peaking right now in the ten year at two
2315.60s: and a half could go to 260 but not a lot
2317.92s: above that
2319.28s: uh we'll be at zero in the bottom of the
2320.88s: bust
2321.76s: from there i expect the ten year to go
2324.32s: to 15 before the end of the decade 30
2327.44s: year to go to 15 treasury bills to go
2330.24s: from
2331.20s: negative rates probably in the bust
2333.28s: up to 20 21
2335.84s: that's a retrace of 40 years of declines
2338.72s: in rates if you have rates moving up
2341.36s: that dramatically and it's not going to
2342.88s: be right away but over the course of the
2344.80s: decade
2346.24s: that's
2347.20s: as i said rates coming down was a wind
2349.68s: at the back of the market
2351.20s: that becomes a wind a headwind
2354.40s: a fierce headwind that shrinks pe
2357.36s: multiples
2358.40s: so growth stocks depend on multiple
2360.64s: expansion
2361.84s: yeah they're growing steadily and what
2364.16s: moves them is the expansion in their pe
2367.36s: multiples whereas value stocks cyclical
2369.92s: stocks depend on big earnings spurts you
2372.96s: know when the economy gets going and
2374.48s: they're in favor they can have big runs
2376.96s: and earnings so you're going to need to
2378.88s: be in stocks that can outpace that big
2380.88s: jump in interest rates that's
2382.88s: commodities you know i i think oil is
2385.52s: going to go from
2386.88s: um i think oil can fall down into the
2389.84s: 30s maybe even into the 20s during the
2392.48s: bust
2393.52s: from where we are a hundred dollars um
2396.72s: but in the next cycle
2398.88s: uh before the end of the decade i expect
2401.12s: oil to be at four hundred dollars
2403.92s: that does a lot to earnings for oil
2405.92s: companies
2407.04s: so oil companies will have oil companies
2409.68s: will have tremendous earnings that's
2412.00s: what can outpace the big jump in rates
2416.88s: you know i expect gold i expect gold to
2418.96s: go to
2419.84s: ten thousand maybe twenty thousand
2421.60s: silver to go to four hundred
2423.60s: those are the kind of price moves that
2425.84s: can outpace inflation you know what what
2428.56s: that generates in terms of earnings
2431.44s: is where you're going to make your money
2433.52s: if you're in an index fund
2435.60s: if you're in an index fund um
2439.20s: you know you get you get squeezed
2441.44s: because interest rates are going up
2444.40s: you know you're not going to have
2446.00s: multiple expansion the reason indexes
2448.40s: did so well the reason people
2450.64s: could put their money in an s p
2452.88s: you know back in 1982 and just ride it
2455.12s: for 40 years
2456.48s: is because interest rates came down if
2458.72s: interest rates reverse and go the other
2460.16s: way
2461.12s: it works opposite
2462.88s: index funds are not going to be a place
2464.56s: to be so um the next cycle is going to
2467.12s: be you know for a lot of people they're
2468.96s: going to have to learn to
2470.64s: understand a different cycle
2473.12s: yeah and that that leads actually into
2475.44s: just a quick follow-on question there do
2477.20s: you think things like cryptocurrencies
2479.60s: and stuff like that change the role of
2482.00s: gold going forward i see a ton of
2484.88s: conversation about that i personally
2486.72s: think that there's still two different
2488.96s: things and a lot of people think that
2490.80s: cryptocurrency is ready to be like the
2492.48s: new gold i have a hard time
2493.76s: conceptualizing that um but be curious
2496.80s: your thoughts
2498.48s: yeah it's certainly a popular narrative
2500.32s: out there i i'm not in that camp either
2502.96s: i
2503.84s: think gold
2504.96s: and silver and the precious metals will
2507.68s: be
2508.64s: uh in favor again in a big way and in a
2511.76s: cycle unlike any we've seen
2514.16s: uh and crypto's not going to hold them
2516.08s: back
2517.04s: um it was it wasn't you know it was a
2520.32s: narrative that fit because
2522.72s: gold went you know peaked out in
2525.04s: 2011 and went sideways to down for
2528.16s: 10 years more than 10 years
2530.24s: um so people were trying to figure out
2532.00s: why and you know crypto was doing well
2534.00s: so it must be crypto well
2536.64s: that's not that's not my belief i don't
2538.72s: think crypto is going to stop the move
2540.80s: in the metals
2542.16s: um
2543.04s: and i think what i've always said i
2544.88s: don't follow
2546.08s: uh bitcoin or crypto
2548.24s: uh but what i always say is let's see
2550.32s: how it holds up in the bust
2552.56s: you know it's never really been tested
2554.24s: in a in a down cycle let's see what what
2557.04s: it does in in that period it's
2559.68s: you know it's easy to like it when it's
2561.20s: going up
2562.32s: we'll see what happens when i think most
2564.40s: assets are going to be going down
2566.00s: including crypto
2567.84s: that's a good it's a good point it would
2569.52s: be uh kind of an interesting observation
2572.00s: okay one last question as i promised to
2573.92s: get you out of here on time um what are
2576.72s: you looking at for the rest of 2022 what
2579.20s: kind of things are you keeping a close
2581.44s: eye on
2582.48s: that inform your analysis of you know
2586.88s: your forecast essentially
2589.44s: yeah well sentiment center plays a big
2591.52s: role in my forecast and right now
2594.08s: obviously we've had a 10 run off the
2596.96s: bottom in the in the indexes so short
2599.20s: term
2600.32s: i think they may be ahead of themselves
2602.48s: and
2603.28s: you know we may not be out of the woods
2605.04s: in terms of you know the worries about
2608.08s: what the fed's gonna do and inflation
2610.48s: etc so there's room here in the next two
2613.52s: or three weeks it's not a long
2615.68s: move but i see a setup where you could
2618.32s: see the s p down 68
2620.80s: and the nasdaq down 10
2623.12s: uh from these levels right here uh or
2625.84s: close to here um but then i do feel that
2629.04s: melt up probably carries us into the
2630.80s: summer
2631.76s: maybe through the summer i don't know um
2634.16s: but it you know something between three
2636.08s: and six months is what i kind of expect
2638.08s: for the rally and
2639.60s: to be and like i said it could be six
2641.92s: thousand it might be 62 or 300 but
2644.48s: somewhere in that range
2646.24s: on the s p and i suspect at that point
2649.84s: in time
2651.36s: uh i get told i'm crazy with my melt-up
2653.84s: call
2654.88s: at that point in time i think i'm gonna
2656.32s: be told i'm crazy to be talking about
2658.48s: the other side you know their people are
2660.48s: gonna be all in you're going to see the
2663.12s: the sentiment will have shifted from
2665.44s: you know what it was a month ago you
2668.00s: know the sky's falling we're going down
2670.08s: we've seen the top
2671.44s: i think at 6 000
2673.60s: everybody's going to be telling you how
2674.88s: there's many years to run in this bull
2677.36s: market you got to get in
2679.20s: and that'll be a sign of a top i think
2681.28s: if everybody's bullish
2683.76s: be a contrarian and look the other way
2686.32s: and and then i think the unwind
2689.20s: um will be
2691.68s: something to behold i mean i i think you
2694.08s: know 2008 9 is not that far behind us
2697.76s: that it's not fresh in some people's
2699.28s: minds anyway
2700.88s: i think this is going to be worse
2704.72s: well as always it's an absolute pleasure
2707.44s: you know chatting with you i think the
2709.36s: uh the experience and the perspective
2711.20s: you bring is really refreshing it's
2712.88s: enlightening to hear so thank you very
2715.76s: much for taking some time to to share
2717.60s: your wisdom with us and obviously
2719.60s: looking forward to chat with you again
2721.44s: in the future and for anybody that's
2723.36s: interested you can find
2725.68s: david on twitter i'll throw the link to
2728.80s: his profile in the video description
2730.80s: below there are a bunch of dave
2733.36s: imposters out there so make sure you pay
2735.28s: attention to the uh to the handle i give
2737.84s: you which will be the correct one and um
2740.08s: yeah unless there's anything else you
2741.28s: got a pleasure chatting with you
2743.68s: yeah let me just re-emphasize that
2745.60s: because thanks for mentioning that
2746.96s: because i
2748.24s: of late there have been i think probably
2750.80s: a couple dozen imposters and they just
2753.76s: changed one letter in and it might be
2756.88s: contrarian spelled wrong or they add a
2759.36s: letter or they do something
2761.36s: um make sure you're at
2764.32s: dave h contrarian spelled correctly um
2767.76s: because it is easy to get tripped up the
2770.56s: other thing is i've got 165 000
2772.72s: followers these imposters typically
2775.20s: you'll see they have
2776.48s: you know hundreds of followers or or
2778.48s: follow hundreds of people not thousands
2780.80s: so you should be able to discern that
2783.36s: but i've seen enough people
2785.20s: that will dm me and say
2787.68s: you know
2788.40s: i i heard from you you you told me you
2791.20s: have a service on
2793.28s: on telegram and i go i'm not on telegram
2796.00s: um so these guys are trying to take your
2797.84s: money be very aware that there are
2800.64s: these guys out there trying to scam
2802.24s: people so
2803.36s: um
2804.16s: you know it as long as you keep your
2806.00s: eyes open and look for dave h contreras
2807.92s: shouldn't have any problem you know
2809.60s: separating me out but just they have my
2812.08s: profile picture so it can fool you it
2813.84s: looks like it's me it's not
2816.40s: yeah thank you and like i said i'll make
2818.16s: sure i get the the you know obviously
2819.84s: your right profile in there so everybody
2821.36s: should be good fun and finding the way
