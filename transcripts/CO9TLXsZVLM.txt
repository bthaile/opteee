0.00s: What's up, Alias?
1.32s: Let's talk about four ways to trade options
4.28s: when IV is low.
6.08s: I want to start first with a couple of facts
8.76s: to keep in mind, then we'll talk about how we can trade
11.52s: during low IV.
12.36s: Okay, first thing.
13.96s: A lot of people will cite VIX and say VIX is low,
17.02s: and follows low.
18.28s: VIX does not equal all volatility.
21.44s: VIX is the S&P 500 volatility.
25.28s: So what that means is, if we look across the market,
28.40s: even if VIX is low, which right now is super low down at 14,
33.04s: this is mean everything is low.
34.72s: If I look at gold, gold is up at 56% implied volatility
39.44s: percentile.
40.12s: S-O-V is at 98% implied volatility percentile.
44.40s: Even if I look across the individual component sectors,
49.88s: I can find 33% implied volatility percentile in materials.
54.64s: I can find 17% in health care.
57.72s: I can see 23% in staples.
60.48s: The point that I'm making is even though implied volatility
63.32s: percentile in S&P is literally zero.
67.12s: That does not mean everything is low-vol.
70.28s: Even the sectors can have elevated vol.
73.60s: And then as you go one step further into the individual
77.20s: constituents, individual stock names, you can still find vol.
82.20s: So the most important thing to pay attention to in the sector
86.24s: is that VIX does not represent the entire market.
89.32s: And if vol is low, there's always vol that's high somewhere,
93.36s: which we'll talk about.
94.80s: The last thing that I want to talk about briefly
96.80s: is what you're actually trading.
98.96s: Number three, most people think that when you're selling
102.80s: options that you're inherently selling implied volatility
107.80s: going down, which is really not what you're trading.
110.88s: What's thing of a scenario?
112.44s: If I sell to open a straddle.
116.84s: And what ends up happening is, let's say I got in when
121.02s: vol was 30%.
123.68s: Let's say IV goes up to 35%.
127.96s: What happens to my unrealized P&L?
130.52s: It hurts, right?
131.84s: It would go down because vol got more expensive than what I sold.
135.56s: But what happens over time?
138.72s: If vol goes up in realized vol does also not go up,
144.04s: meaning it doesn't breach my short strikes.
146.12s: And it stays relatively range bound, even though implied
149.40s: vol has gone up, that means that implied volatility
152.48s: going up temporarily hurts me.
154.88s: But it's not going to kill me.
156.80s: The thing that kills you, pervably,
160.08s: is when realized vol exceeds whatever the implied vol
164.80s: was that you sold.
166.52s: So this thing works both ways.
168.52s: Let's say that you sold vol when it was actually high.
171.36s: Let's say it was 35%.
173.24s: And let's say vol goes down to 30%.
177.16s: Vol goes down.
178.60s: But let's say that realized vol trended in one direction
183.24s: albeit slowly, and it violates your short strike.
187.24s: Even though you got in accommodating move and vol,
189.44s: you're still going to lose money, because realized vol
191.88s: was too high.
192.96s: So remember, even though you're commonly told
196.60s: implied volatility is mean reverting
198.48s: and all this other stuff, remember what you're actually
201.12s: trading, which more often than not
203.08s: is not actually the mean reverting component
206.28s: of implied vol utility, but you're typically trading
209.04s: the relative relationship between implied vol
213.04s: and realizable.
214.28s: Now one quick admin note is you
216.56s: could tell this is primarily built around short options
221.24s: this video, but it's not relegated to short options.
226.24s: Because when you're trading long options in low vol,
229.24s: you can get torn up because you need enough movement.
231.60s: So some of these things will still apply to you.
234.16s: All right, let's talk about now how to trade them.
235.96s: I got four things we're going to review.
237.88s: We're going to talk about trading implied vol utility
240.04s: relative to realize, which we just covered at a high level.
243.32s: Then we'll talk about finding catalysts.
245.48s: We'll look for earnings plays and then trading relative vol.
248.92s: Let's start with trading implied vol relative to realize vol.
252.24s: As I literally just told you, implied vol utility
254.88s: right now in S&P 500, as you can tell,
257.44s: you might have to zoom in, but I'll read it to you.
259.76s: implied vol utility percentile is literally 0%.
263.40s: That means implied vol utility has not been lower
266.68s: than what it currently is in the S&P 500 over the last year.
270.04s: It's as low as it gets.
271.68s: But notice what's going on in this other graph down here.
276.60s: Notice how the yellow line, which is implied vol,
279.84s: is remaining elevated relative to realized vol.
284.64s: That means if you sell vol, you're still making money right now.
287.92s: Moreover, the net, if we look at a scale of implied
291.36s: volatility percentile, 100% here, 0% here,
295.20s: you're typically not well off trading the extremes.
299.12s: Let's say the top 20% or the bottom 20%.
303.56s: You want to try to avoid those.
305.40s: But if that's all you got, it's not the worst to be down here
310.88s: preferable to up here.
312.80s: If you're trading when it's up here, it's probably closer to fair value.
316.00s: Down here, more often than not, is where you will
318.16s: at least find some relative risk premium.
321.44s: So again, remember, when you're trading implied volatility
324.96s: relative to realized volatility, you're trading risk premium,
328.72s: which typically exists, you can find it in the indices,
332.12s: but you can find it in individual constituents and so on.
335.72s: So this is the first place you can look even if vol is low.
338.52s: Next, find catalysts.
341.28s: I looked for stocks that had weird moves in one of them
344.20s: that popped across the old desk was SOC.
348.16s: What happened here in SOC?
351.40s: Let's take a quick look.
353.28s: You can see that it literally had a gap up a few days ago
356.56s: and it had another gap up today.
359.08s: The SMP's been moving relatively sideways,
361.80s: but if we measure what's going on in SOC,
366.32s: what's happened over the last few days,
368.40s: if this is not tied to earnings, it ran up 44%
372.88s: effectively in a day and then from here to here,
375.60s: it's up another 10%.
377.40s: So there's absolutely volatility to be found here,
380.52s: and you can see it confirmed with implied volatility
383.32s: percentile at 98%.
386.08s: It tells you something's going on here.
387.32s: What is it?
388.16s: Well, they just had some news come out
391.00s: on two different pieces of their business.
393.84s: There's one catalyst that's driving the classification
397.20s: of their pipeline, and then there's another broader
400.48s: economic breadth impact for more energy
404.60s: is specific to this sector.
406.68s: So this is having a few things moving in its direction
409.88s: and then it also had a loss-fluorous pipeline
413.44s: approval to restart.
415.08s: So the point that I'm making is you can find things
418.36s: with high-vol, even when vol is low.
420.60s: The thing you have to not do is just bitch that vol is low.
423.64s: There's opportunities you're just being lazy
426.16s: in you're not looking.
427.52s: Next, earnings plays easy place to find vol.
430.56s: Now you'll see right now we're kind of outside
433.52s: of an earnings cycle.
434.84s: That just happens to line up sometimes,
437.24s: but others times it doesn't.
438.68s: So it's always a place that's worthwhile to take look right now.
441.88s: You wouldn't get much there, but earnings season's
444.24s: going to start again soon.
445.32s: So it all remains suppressed to a great place to look.
449.12s: The last thing, relative volatility.
451.88s: This is when we look at volatility across the volatility
454.96s: surface.
455.48s: We can look within the smile, which is within an individual
461.04s: expiration, where you can look at term structure
463.72s: across expiration.
465.36s: So in this example in SLV, we can find some really
468.76s: interesting relationships.
470.68s: So for example, here, I can see that the 16-jane
474.04s: vol in this level between like the 60 and 70
478.16s: is actually higher than the 31-deese vol.
481.64s: But I can see that it flips back and forth.
484.16s: Maybe I think there's a trade idea there.
486.52s: Maybe I can find these deep trials in the volatility
490.36s: surface a lot of times this won't be anything.
492.24s: But other times you'll find areas that are very
494.32s: picky compared to others.
496.32s: So then you can start running things like diagonals
498.64s: and calendars.
499.88s: You can trade term vol relative to other terms.
504.28s: And you might see that right now, the five-day or seven-day
508.52s: vol is actually waning as 60-day vols expanding.
512.40s: Maybe we think that relationship might normalize.
516.52s: The takeaway is that there are always a bunch of things
521.80s: that you can do.
522.80s: This is literally only four.
524.88s: There are x number of ways that you can actually
528.24s: trade vol during low volatility environments.
530.92s: It's always there.
532.44s: You just have to look.
533.36s: Don't be lazy.
534.16s: Be an outlier.
534.92s: See you later.
