0.00s:  you
30.00s:  you
60.00s:  you
90.00s:  you
120.00s:  Sala
150.00s:  And it's definitely been taken a little bit longer than I was originally anticipating
153.38s:  not that there's like a time hack that we have to stick to.
158.24s:  The chat just completely disappeared.
160.24s:  So okay, I guess I am, there it is, like playing Wacomoll.
166.48s:  There we go.
169.28s:  But we're getting a chance to go through kind of each position really, really far in detail.
177.64s:  And to start us off, we have to start with any updates to our ape outlier sheet.
185.52s:  So if you've already let me know where you're from, don't tell me again.
189.40s:  But if I've not added you, let me know.
194.00s:  And you can kind of check out the map and see what we might be missing.
197.60s:  In the meantime, I got to say hello to everybody.
200.56s:  So we got Samota, we got Lauren Lance, Derslup, roaring clitty, day swag.
207.56s:  Mark Chicken, case everybody's wondering it's mock chicken.
211.96s:  Pistol shrimp, that's a cool one.
215.40s:  I think we have, I don't know if we have Toronto, we definitely have Ottawa.
219.00s:  Let's see, do we have Toronto?
221.72s:  Lido?
229.36s:  We do not, now we do.
231.64s:  We have Toronto.
234.40s:  Beautiful.
236.24s:  I think we have Atlanta.
238.84s:  You got to be careful moving around Atlanta though.
241.44s:  You don't need to get, don't need to get shot.
244.64s:  Nope, we don't have Atlanta now we do.
247.84s:  Kyoto, Japan, I don't know if we have Kyoto on here.
253.08s:  We do not.
256.24s:  I think we have one other from, I guess we don't.
258.52s:  Now we have Japan on the map.
259.72s:  That's great.
260.24s:  That's a huge ad.
261.32s:  Big win for the team.
263.64s:  Salt Lake City, let's see.
267.88s:  That's one of the places that we were looking at moving originally.
271.88s:  Was not Salt Lake City, we were looking at I think North Ogden in the mountains here.
277.00s:  And then we were looking south somewhere in like Provo I think.
280.72s:  But yeah, we were originally potentially looking at moving there.
285.52s:  Then we got five H trades from Williams, Arizona, it literally never hurt that.
292.96s:  Where is Williams?
294.96s:  Oh, dude, no way.
299.76s:  That's hilarious.
300.76s:  So five H, fun fact.
306.16s:  My brother, he's in Flagstaff.
308.48s:  So I go out to Flagstaff every once in a while to go see him.
312.36s:  But we come, we go south, right?
314.80s:  Because I'm in San Diego.
316.56s:  Sooner or more we go out the eight and then up the 17.
321.60s:  So yeah, that's hilarious.
322.88s:  It just never been, yeah, Williams didn't click for whatever reason.
327.88s:  But yeah, that's been out there a bunch.
331.80s:  Then we got JD, do we have Iowa?
335.04s:  Let's see.
337.12s:  Do we have Iowa?
338.28s:  We do.
339.28s:  Yeah, we have a couple.
341.20s:  We can do Iowa proper now and round it.
343.52s:  We got them.
344.52s:  Oh, no, I don't think we did.
347.92s:  Yeah, perfect.
349.24s:  So we're we're rounding this thing out.
352.28s:  I think it would be so cool if we hit every US state.
358.56s:  That would be fantastic.
360.40s:  And then each continent, that's what we need.
364.40s:  Jato says, Winnipeg, Canada, that Canadians start to make me a little nervous because in
372.52s:  our discord, there's actually the guy that originally helped me set up the discord
378.36s:  from the jump.
381.12s:  He is from Canada.
382.40s:  He's obviously incredibly, incredibly nice.
385.16s:  This is way back when I first started the whole community.
387.56s:  I was moving us over from a Facebook group because I don't really like Facebook.
391.96s:  And he helped set the whole thing up for me.
395.16s:  But one of my underlying, one of my underlying ideas is that he's like slowly building a
401.12s:  Canadian army because there are a massive number of Canadians that I'm noticing popping
407.60s:  up around.
408.88s:  So and then we have Michael Solar from Mobile, Alabama.
413.80s:  On fact, my kind of I call my stepfather, but really he's kind of like my mentor.
420.48s:  He was the high school teacher.
421.56s:  He's the one that actually got me into, well, he introduced me to investing.
427.04s:  He has told me stories about his time down in Alabama.
431.36s:  No rumour, Australia.
432.36s:  I don't know where that is.
435.96s:  North, Southwest.
437.96s:  Where is this?
441.40s:  Where am I?
445.80s:  Oh, this is way south.
449.28s:  Okay, that makes sense.
452.00s:  Yeah, I had never been over there.
454.32s:  I've been to Canberra and then I did like the Gold Coast, which was sick.
460.08s:  When I was in Australia with the Marine Corps, we were up in Darwin.
465.04s:  And then there is a big movement down through the straight all the way down through here,
469.56s:  down to Adelaide, which was Adelaide was sick, really, really liked Adelaide.
473.56s:  And then I had some time to go over to the Gold Coast, which was sick.
479.40s:  Island Islands Finland.
481.04s:  J.Pock, is that like, are you two pox cousin?
484.44s:  Careful.
485.60s:  Because they're still out there.
491.72s:  It's hilarious.
496.96s:  We were looking at going here, but they looked really small.
500.60s:  So we opted out of it for now at least, but maybe we'll land there.
504.84s:  Cool.
505.84s:  So we got a couple new updates on our map.
508.36s:  I think we got the gang in here.
510.80s:  So we'll kill this off.
512.52s:  And then let's do a quick refresh on where we're at and what we're doing.
518.80s:  So I need to grab the bottom of this.
523.84s:  There we go.
526.08s:  So what we've been doing is going through each of his trade updates and essentially tracking
533.36s:  what the positions were.
535.52s:  And then I started adding some qualitative notes around when he's managing the positions
541.24s:  to close because I'm very, very interested in those personally.
546.00s:  And the primary reason why I'm so interested in those is because I think they're going
549.84s:  to be, I think we're going to see some common threads that we will start to learn from in
557.76s:  terms of how he's thinking about options.
560.20s:  Because I've said this before, I think right now when I look at his options positions,
566.32s:  I genuinely see them as just leveraged long exposure.
571.96s:  They're not seemingly predicated on a certain amount of time in the trade yet.
579.40s:  But my guess is that's what we're going to find is that they're going to be predicated
583.68s:  by time, not by some sort of price target.
586.84s:  So I told Newton that if you wanted to chattel a little bit during this one, he had a busy
593.84s:  week.
594.84s:  So he can't, but I told him I would shoot him a text with where we left off.
598.04s:  So I'm going to let him know that we're picking up from 22D's 2020 and that will follow
606.68s:  up, we'll follow up with where we land on our K trades.
616.80s:  So kind of a placeholder for me.
619.44s:  But let's take a look.
622.88s:  All right.
623.88s:  So now we have to do this thing that I do every time because I don't know how to do this
626.76s:  still.
627.76s:  And this is not any of your fault actually.
630.16s:  This is my own fault because I accidentally forgot how to like automatically scroll to the
638.52s:  bottom, which is kind of annoying.
640.24s:  So I have to like do this.
641.40s:  Somebody told me how to do this before.
645.20s:  But I don't remember.
647.52s:  There was like a hot key.
649.08s:  Anybody here know the hot key?
650.08s:  Otherwise, I'm just going to start scrolling.
652.52s:  But I wonder if I can be enlightened before I start the scrolling process.
658.56s:  And then I have two versions of this open on purpose.
663.48s:  And the reason I'm using two versions is because I would like to make sure that we can
670.88s:  look at near term stuff and then stuff that's from obviously all the way down at the bottom.
677.88s:  All right.
679.00s:  Everybody's leaving me out here hanging to dry.
683.12s:  So I'm going to start scrolling.
685.44s:  Here we go.
686.44s:  So it's not like the page down thing because that only gets you to the bottom of this.
691.00s:  It doesn't get us all the way to the very bottom.
697.08s:  Which actually I realized we don't even have to do that.
698.68s:  I'm an idiot.
699.68s:  My bad.
700.68s:  We literally can start further up.
702.04s:  Sometimes you guys got to keep an eye on me.
703.56s:  Like sometimes I just do really, really stupid shit.
707.44s:  Lauren says, sorry, you said it last week, but I forget to dammit.
710.56s:  Lauren, we were really leaning on you here because obviously I can't be trusted.
715.80s:  So I'm going to blame you now that now that you admitted that you at least were rudimentary
722.64s:  really familiar with it, I'm going to say that I expected you to keep us on track.
728.16s:  And then I think, yeah, as long as I can have escape go.
735.44s:  Lauren says we didn't leave off at the bottom there, but yeah, exactly.
740.40s:  No, the only reason why I like going down to the bottom is because there's good references.
743.84s:  I think and we're going to end up referencing it again.
746.52s:  I'm sure.
747.52s:  But anyways, let's get to where we need to be, which is somewhere right up here.
751.68s:  Yeah.
752.68s:  So I think we got through December.
754.68s:  What a fucking hilarious.
756.76s:  Yeah.
757.76s:  Okay.
758.76s:  So here's where we're at.
759.76s:  Let me grab my little handy dandy workbook.
761.32s:  And I think last time I put this over here, that worked well.
765.40s:  And then I can squish this.
767.52s:  I think so that you can see most of it.
769.88s:  You won't be able to see my notes.
771.24s:  I don't think, but I'll track them obviously.
774.12s:  And we left at 22 December.
777.96s:  Okay.
779.16s:  So.
780.84s:  And then the other thing I need to do is get into on demand because we were tracking his
786.32s:  individual trades in here.
789.16s:  And then I'm going to go back to the correct time.
792.24s:  So we need to go to 2020.
795.16s:  Is it 21?
797.44s:  Wait, no, 2020.
799.80s:  That's why.
800.80s:  Okay.
801.80s:  So we don't have the positions yet.
803.40s:  That's annoying.
804.40s:  Well, there we go.
806.20s:  Okay.
807.20s:  Cool.
808.20s:  So we need to go to December of 2020.
810.28s:  We'll go to the 22nd.
811.60s:  We'll look at the day as it sits.
813.04s:  And I saved all of his old positions, I think.
815.92s:  If not, I can reconstitute them really quick.
817.80s:  I might have reset the account at one point.
819.88s:  It's not a big deal.
822.28s:  No, we still have more.
828.88s:  So then we'll use this as a quick fact check.
833.24s:  I'm going to turn these ones off.
834.32s:  I think these were from an example that I was giving.
836.96s:  So let's mirror these really fast with exactly what he had.
843.00s:  So we need this.
845.16s:  And then I'm going to pull this over here just for a moment.
847.96s:  Let's go into 22 December.
849.60s:  And then let's mirror this account.
851.52s:  So we're long 10,000.
853.84s:  We have that.
854.84s:  Oops.
855.84s:  10,000 at 4,1133.
860.32s:  We have that good.
862.36s:  Next we need 15 Jan.
866.64s:  The tens in the 20s.
868.44s:  15 Jan's the tens in the 20s.
872.16s:  So I want to get rid of these other ones.
879.76s:  I'm just going to get rid of all this stuff.
884.08s:  We'll add that.
886.20s:  So now I need to go to 15 Jan, which is now 24 DTE.
890.32s:  I remember this being very interesting to me.
892.40s:  And then the way that he unwound those other options
894.64s:  was very interesting to me.
896.92s:  And then his paid price was 0.0726.
901.48s:  And he has 1,000 I believe.
903.00s:  Yep, 1,000.
905.84s:  And then he has 0.0726.
911.96s:  So we'll analyze that.
914.20s:  You got those other ones for 20.
915.48s:  Yep.
916.00s:  And then we have one other trade, 16 April, the 21 16 April 12.
922.76s:  So now we go to 16 April, again, super far out in time.
930.04s:  And he I'm sure it has 1,000 of these.
935.48s:  And then he's at $0.40 on these.
940.92s:  You're a 0.4.
944.96s:  So now we have his whole position.
947.44s:  We'll be able to see it day by day.
949.60s:  We have our little tracker ready to go so that we can monitor
955.64s:  any incremental changes.
958.52s:  So we are ready to rumble.
963.40s:  Let's take a look now at 23 D's.
967.56s:  So now this is 23 D's.
970.88s:  And just so you know, I'm being lazy,
972.68s:  these are all showing as 2024.
974.56s:  I obviously know that these are all 2021.
977.84s:  So I'll kind of color them in just so that we're all
980.40s:  on the same page.
981.60s:  And we were confident together.
984.04s:  But I just don't want to have to keep typing more than I need to.
986.92s:  So that's why that's set up as it is,
988.76s:  just so that you're aware that I'm aware.
991.28s:  Also a quick drug take.
997.08s:  I got my doctor's appointment set up for next Thursday.
1002.40s:  Your boys getting an epidural of steroids
1005.00s:  to help with the whole disc thing.
1006.56s:  So maybe, just maybe, I won't have to mainline drugs
1012.12s:  in order to at least be able to sit.
1014.16s:  OK, 23 December.
1017.76s:  We're off to the races.
1020.40s:  So we have no change in any of the positions.
1022.88s:  But let's take a look at our TG.
1025.60s:  So we're at 24 83 257.
1033.00s:  .63.
1036.96s:  Cash in the account is 1116796.64.
1048.84s:  And total value is 3709, 3709, 996.64.
1058.08s:  OK, same, same.
1061.56s:  And here, so he's still holding the tens and 20s.
1066.08s:  And now one day is past, which why is that?
1071.72s:  Why did he bother posting here?
1080.28s:  So let's take a look at the gaps between these just out of curiosity.
1085.92s:  OK, so if we look at, I'm actually, because I'm very specific
1095.28s:  with the way that I like to input data, I really don't like skipping things.
1102.48s:  So I'm going to put the post date here, and then I'll put the gap here.
1108.60s:  But what I don't understand is why this,
1115.44s:  like why?
1116.64s:  Why here?
1122.00s:  Yeah, because I noticed that right out of the gate is when I look at his posting frequency,
1128.28s:  a couple of things jump out at me.
1131.48s:  And one of the things that I noticed is like, he went not posting a lot.
1137.84s:  Then he was going about a week in between his updates, which makes a ton of sense,
1141.68s:  right?
1141.92s:  Like posting a weekly update, that's like a very normal cadence.
1146.16s:  But then I noticed this, it starts getting like really recent.
1150.96s:  And I don't know why.
1151.84s:  If any of you do, tell me why, please, so that I can wonder no more.
1156.64s:  But right now, I am wondering a lot because I don't actually get this.
1165.24s:  And then this, I'm just going to hold down a little bit further
1168.28s:  because we're going to keep going here.
1172.80s:  Dark Gensers, I think we get one more downturn before GME Moons,
1177.04s:  DFV, like unlikely in yet.
1178.80s:  Yeah, we'll definitely take time to bounce between different theories.
1183.48s:  You know I love looking at some of those theories.
1185.56s:  So I am 100% down to take a look.
1188.72s:  Because the other thing that I got from the discord is somebody was asking about
1193.20s:  the dark pool orders that we recently got, which I think is worth taking a look at.
1199.20s:  That one already says, was it in December 2021 that he posted a lot?
1202.68s:  Yeah.
1203.20s:  So what I noticed in December is that the frequency between posts went up a lot.
1208.04s:  Or like the latency between posts went down frequency of posts went up.
1212.44s:  So right now, like I'm typically seeing them do like once a month or once a week, sorry.
1217.24s:  Or you know, October, November, right?
1220.36s:  That's like a very steady cadence.
1221.80s:  It's about once a week.
1223.08s:  But then in December, I can already see that like he went from the eighth to ninth,
1228.20s:  the 2223.
1229.80s:  So I, and then there's a 25th.
1237.00s:  So I haven't like I don't understand why the uptick and frequency here.
1244.04s:  And then I'm actually going to shrink this one down a little bit.
1246.88s:  Let me know if that becomes not visible for you, but it just makes a little easier for me to move.
1252.20s:  So the total gain it and I got to move this mic a little bit so I can see my keyboard.
1256.60s:  Also shout out to the 75 apes that are in here hanging out, whether you're an ape, outlier,
1262.36s:  outlier, ape, all are welcome because as we all know, this story in and of itself is about
1268.84s:  as interesting as it gets.
1270.76s:  So let's take a look at this total gain.
1272.20s:  So 2393557.63.
1278.52s:  Total cash in the account looks generally unchanged.
1281.40s:  1116831.
1286.12s:  .85.
1287.88s:  And then value is 3620331.85.
1297.32s:  Did I mess something up?
1298.92s:  That looks correct.
1302.76s:  3620331.85.
1305.00s:  That looks correct.
1309.08s:  2393.
1310.76s:  Yep, I messed up.
1313.16s:  2393.
1316.76s:  55763.
1320.04s:  2393.
1321.00s:  55763.
1322.68s:  That's correct.
1331.56s:  Interesting.
1333.88s:  So I'm detecting a variance here.
1338.60s:  And I'm trying to
1342.84s:  positions haven't moved.
1346.76s:  .
1355.00s:  So what happened here?
1364.20s:  Wait, this looks
1366.52s:  is it just off by like
1371.56s:  this looks what is this doing?
1375.96s:  .
1380.28s:  89664.
1381.48s:  This matches.
1384.60s:  I don't know why this is showing is.
1388.60s:  It doesn't match.
1389.40s:  It does match.
1392.12s:  This and this are the same.
1397.64s:  Is it a Intel if there's like a formatting issue here?
1402.84s:  I'm just going to highlight this is green because this is
1405.80s:  this looks correct.
1412.28s:  Yeah, let me.
1415.56s:  I'm going to highlight this one is green because this is this is good.
1419.16s:  So there's no there's no problem.
1422.12s:  I think this one had the same issue with like a rounding discrepancies.
1425.88s:  So I'm going to flag this is green.
1430.36s:  Okay.
1431.72s:  And then here we're still holding these.
1434.36s:  And now we have.
1438.76s:  25 D's.
1442.28s:  And now we have 21 DTE.
1445.16s:  That we still hold those options.
1451.56s:  Interesting so far.
1452.52s:  And then this one is also good.
1454.28s:  I just realized that's incorrectly flagged.
1457.88s:  Okay.
1458.36s:  All right.
1460.52s:  So now let's take a look.
1466.28s:  Yeah, 31 D's.
1467.40s:  So this to me looks like he's just enjoying posting more.
1472.52s:  That's what I see here.
1473.64s:  Like it's got to be something to do with the account.
1477.08s:  Like take a look at the account.
1478.28s:  Well, he already saw $2 million.
1481.48s:  So this isn't anything about novel.
1483.48s:  This isn't novel about being above $2 million.
1486.20s:  He was already there.
1489.16s:  So it's not like he's like, oh yeah, you know,
1492.68s:  I you guys have been calling me fucking crazy and I'm right.
1497.48s:  So that's interesting.
1500.68s:  So total gain here is negative
1503.64s:  107 200.
1508.68s:  That's fucking crazy.
1511.88s:  That is fucking crazy.
1525.32s:  Wow.
1528.68s:  One man, I'm still like absorbing this.
1531.16s:  We have to take a look on the chart here because this is this is fucking crazy.
1537.96s:  31 83 or 60 99.
1552.28s:  I've moved the wrong column here.
1553.72s:  1953 or 57.
1558.60s:  Got 63.
1560.52s:  There we go.
1564.52s:  This makes way more sense.
1565.64s:  I was just being stupid.
1566.68s:  I was reading this is the total gain not the day gain him losing $100,000 in a day is kind of whatever.
1575.16s:  Ron clitty says I mean one million gain in a day still feels good even if you're ready to
1578.76s:  been there. Yeah, no, I agree with that.
1580.20s:  I totally agree.
1581.32s:  I think my point is is like for the lay person like a normal human being, I would expect them to,
1588.20s:  you know, if they're doing really this you can look at this on Reddit, right?
1591.96s:  Like if you go to any sub Reddit, you can take a look at like very, very clear lines.
1598.36s:  If people are doing well and there's actually literally studies about this that are really fun
1603.56s:  to look at.
1604.60s:  But if people are doing really well, they post a lot more frequently.
1609.32s:  And then if the market's not looking really good, I'm adjusting my chair because my
1615.24s:  stuff's all fucked up.
1618.36s:  And if things are not going well, people tend to post way less.
1624.76s:  So, but he doesn't like I can tell he doesn't subscribe to that, right?
1628.12s:  Like I don't think he's starting to post more here because he's making some money.
1633.88s:  Like I just don't see that.
1635.16s:  That doesn't seem to be his M.O.
1637.32s:  But what does seem to be interesting is that he's still holding these positions
1641.32s:  that now at 31D's 21, what did I miss up?
1651.00s:  31 December 21.
1657.88s:  Oh, I see.
1660.68s:  That's my bad.
1661.96s:  15 Jan 22.
1668.20s:  So, now he has 15 DTE.
1671.72s:  Vladimir says, Eric, with all due respect, there was a lot being added to the story that
1678.28s:  has spread. She based on numbers alone will not capture.
1684.28s:  I'm confused.
1685.24s:  What's the, what's your point?
1690.76s:  Because I'm not in no way what I'm doing now.
1693.72s:  Am I suggesting that this is like the GameStop story or Newton story?
1698.20s:  Noon.
1699.16s:  I don't know why I say Newton's on the brain.
1701.96s:  Sorry.
1703.56s:  Or Rory and Kitty's story.
1705.80s:  Yeah, I've not suggested that, Mr. Offputin.
1708.68s:  The point of this part of the series is very specifically to analyze his traits.
1716.44s:  That's the point.
1718.84s:  The reason why I look at this is because I think we can get way more information
1727.64s:  on his behaviors, habits, what he sees.
1731.80s:  And most importantly, I have not, I don't know anybody that I've heard talk about his previous
1739.08s:  traits that I personally would take at face value personally. And that's not that like I
1744.36s:  mistrust people because I think that they're trying to lie or, you know, mislead me.
1750.04s:  I think it's that people themselves tend to not understand how biased their recollection
1757.88s:  and analysis of things are.
1761.32s:  So the whole point of this is for me to see for myself. And as I'm seeing for myself,
1768.28s:  to show you again, what I'm seeing right now, specifically from the trade perspective.
1776.04s:  Now in terms of like going to the rest of the story and stuff, like I said,
1779.80s:  I love doing that. And I fully intend to, right? Like we've done 11 episodes of this now.
1785.00s:  And there's this is only the third one that we're like focused on the traits. I haven't done it
1789.16s:  yet. So yeah, I completely agree. And now off Putin to your point, if there are off shoots
1798.36s:  that you think we should, you know, take a break and go look at while we're doing this because
1802.68s:  it's temporally related, like the Edgar story or something, let me know, right? Because that's
1806.76s:  the point. You guys as a community will know more about this collectively than I ever will. And
1813.16s:  that's just how it is. So I fully lean and want to blend both of our collective intellect.
1822.20s:  So in this case, yeah, if there's something that you think we should jump over to that like helps
1828.60s:  elucidate where we're at in the timeline, I'm happy to. But yeah, right now my entire goal is to
1834.52s:  understand exactly what he's doing, what his habits are, what the trades look like. And again,
1841.24s:  the whole point of this whole thing is not to try to replicate what he's doing because again,
1848.28s:  that's not how I trade. I literally don't care to do that. It's because I've been in trading for
1853.88s:  so long and I am literally staring at a fucking anomaly and I can see it. I can watch the anomaly
1863.24s:  doing anomalous things, which is absolutely insane. So yeah, I am eager to figure out where this
1873.48s:  all goes, but step by step because right now again, I've already identified some really,
1881.08s:  really clear trends and themes that I can clearly identify. So when I look at this again,
1889.80s:  first I can tell that he takes massively leveraged positions to I can also tell that he takes
1896.20s:  massive amounts of concentrated risk that he leaves on three. I can tell you that he doesn't use
1902.68s:  stops of any sort or I can tell you that in terms of portfolio volatility, he is entirely null to it.
1910.28s:  Five, I can tell you that he doesn't manage his options trades based on any sort of perceived
1917.24s:  profit or lost target. So there's a lot of like very specific things that I can pick up from his
1923.88s:  habits from this exact process. So let's take a look. Sam, Sam Clements says, why would we not want to
1936.20s:  trade like the guy who made a billion? It's a great question. The reason why is because if as a
1941.80s:  trader, your model of trading is an attempt to copy somebody else, I literally have never seen
1947.96s:  it done successfully. And the reason being is because in order to like fully copy somebody else,
1956.12s:  you have to let you either have to know what they're doing before they're doing it to do it with
1962.36s:  them or you have to adopt their entire brain literally because again, we'll see and because we
1970.76s:  know as we go further into the future, we'll see periods. I mean, let's look at an example together.
1977.56s:  And I'll ask you this.
1988.68s:  So if we take a look at this,
1991.08s:  and let me make it so that the quality is at least decent. So here's a dude, I'm going to
2009.32s:  zoom in so you can see here's a dude that in an individual day, his trading account right now
2015.88s:  was at $350 million. He was down $235 million in a day, genuinely, genuinely. If you were thinking
2026.52s:  about being this guy, is this what you would do? The only person that would say yes,
2037.40s:  is the kind of person that says yes with the benefit of hindsight knowing what may or may not
2043.72s:  happen and really the benefit of hindsight is terrible, right? Because this went even lower from here.
2049.80s:  So the whole point is that his disposition, his mentality towards trading is so anomalous.
2060.76s:  It is literally contrary to human genetic processing. It's completely different.
2069.08s:  And I'm not saying that it's unique to only him. It's not. There are other people out there
2074.68s:  that have some of these similar tendencies. But what I'm saying is that they are so few and far
2081.40s:  between that for most of us, for example, me, if I had this position and I was trying to trade
2091.96s:  this position or whatever, there's no way that I wouldn't have a stop on these options. Why is that?
2101.08s:  Why would I worry about having a stop on the options? Because I know that these options will
2108.84s:  continue to decay. I know that. So I would rather capture the profit as it starts to realize,
2119.48s:  then let it turn into a loss. That's like a relatively normal trader's mindset.
2125.32s:  His mindset is obviously completely different, which is why it's so freaking cool. But it's also why
2134.52s:  the idea of trying to essentially adopt what he does and do it yourself would fail miserably,
2143.24s:  unless you have the ability to completely adopt his psychology, which again, reiterate the point
2150.44s:  is a pure anomaly. It's a pure anomaly because again, the other thing I can tell you is that this
2156.92s:  dude doesn't really care that much about money. Obviously, he probably cares about money to a degree.
2162.76s:  I know that he has a family and he wants to take care of his family and stuff like that. I know
2166.44s:  all of that, but he could have never opened up another trade and he could have lived the rest of his
2174.68s:  life with more money than he could ever need, but he chose not to. So it tells me something else
2181.56s:  about what motivates him and why he does this. So all of this is to go back to Sam's question on,
2187.32s:  why would we not want to trade like a guy who made a billion is because in order to trade like him,
2192.28s:  you have to adopt his entire world view, his entire paradigm. And I do not think the overwhelming
2199.96s:  majority of people can do that because it is so unique. It is so anomalous. That's why.
2208.84s:  Cedric says, maybe he sees something that gives him insane win rate if certain conditions are
2213.24s:  right potentially, but I can also tell you again, by looking at the data that it's not true,
2219.32s:  right? Because there's obviously he's a fantastic trader, but he's not great at timing things so far.
2228.28s:  So what it tells me is that he's good at taking repeated risks, highly concentrated,
2234.76s:  and then letting the numbers kind of work out, which again, there is a portion of this that is
2240.20s:  like a coin flip. There is a certain amount of luck that's tied to this because one of the things that I
2246.76s:  look at is this here, right? Like he was already over $2.2 million and then he contracts down
2254.12s:  eight days later in his total gain to 932. So he cut his value of his portfolio in half in eight days.
2264.92s:  If there happened to be a bad path for GameStop again for one of any innumerable reasons,
2273.08s:  then this account can literally be zeroed out because of bad path. So in this case, I think that again,
2283.08s:  brilliant, brilliant thesis, brilliant conviction, really good use of leverage, right? Like I can
2290.20s:  identify lots of really good things that happened here, but I continue to remind people that there
2295.48s:  is a healthy dose of luck that's included with this, which again is also important to remind people
2301.56s:  because when we look at somebody like Sam who asks a really normal question of why wouldn't we
2307.08s:  want to try to do this, well, it's because of all of these different reasons because it's not just
2314.52s:  skill that led to this. Again, skill, massive factor, luck, also, massive factor. So that's why I'm
2323.96s:  so eager to see how the rest of this goes because we're getting a chance, we're getting a glimpse
2329.40s:  inside of what this all looks like from a trading perspective, which I'm like really, really excited
2339.00s:  for. I'm going to just replace really quick. I want to find 2024 and I want to replace it with 2021.
2360.36s:  No, I don't want that. I want no one to use a formula.
2371.40s:  Why is there no 2024 in here? There is 2024. Don't lie to me.
2390.04s:  Oh, so it considers it a formula. Okay.
2398.76s:  Good to know. Okay. So now let's continue.
2408.04s:  And so we just did 31Ds. Now we are in 5GN.
2412.44s:  22. Okay. So we see a change. We can immediately see that he offloaded the tens,
2427.88s:  which again is not what I would have expected. That's not what I would have expected at all.
2433.24s:  8. That's crazy. 8.81.474.03.
2443.32s:  And the nuts.
2444.52s:  Passionale is 1128502.42.
2452.12s:  Value is 2803002.42.
2462.04s:  Confirm that these are correct. 88147403.
2465.48s:  1128502.42.
2469.64s:  2803002.
2473.32s:  Okay.
2475.80s:  So the first thing I notice is that he's missing a lot of money.
2483.88s:  There's a big variance between what should be in the portfolio right now and what is.
2496.44s:  So I find that.
2499.80s:  I find that very interesting.
2507.56s:  Because his cash is sitting at essentially up 8 grand.
2513.08s:  The total gain down a mill.
2517.32s:  Obviously because one of his positions came down, but it's not captured in the cash.
2525.88s:  So this here looks like he took some money out of the account.
2535.96s:  Offputin says you missed that he just added 40 KGME shares. Yeah, I haven't even gotten into the
2542.12s:  updated positions. Offputin, I feel like this process confuses you because you did the same
2546.44s:  thing last time. Every single change that is going to happen in the account is going to be
2553.00s:  captured in these metrics. I don't have to look at the individual positions to note changes
2560.12s:  because regardless of where they go, I can still see them. So because to your point,
2567.96s:  when I'm looking at the change in individual positions that's going to be captured in total gain
2573.80s:  cash relative to value. So I'm going to see all of that. Now to your point, I am going to go
2578.84s:  through and update all of his trades because I can also see that he unwound an options trade.
2583.48s:  But what I'm highlighting more specifically is that money moved. That's the point here.
2591.64s:  Is that a decent amount of money came out of this.
2598.68s:  So if I add another column to maybe help with this point,
2601.88s:  if we take a look at the overall value compared to what's in there. So in this case,
2617.56s:  there's like a $600,000 value variance here.
2622.36s:  Putin says from the previous statement to the one you're looking at, he went from 10 to 50K.
2632.20s:  Yeah, I know, dude. I know. I'm aware. I'm following you, bro. He also
2635.64s:  offloaded a thousand options. I am right there with you. Again, the point that I'm trying to
2645.24s:  make no mistakes as the spreadsheet is flawed, the stock price dropped. The account value dropped
2650.20s:  380K, which makes sense. It's not. So the reason why this isn't relative to the stock price,
2660.28s:  it doesn't matter what the stock price is. It doesn't change the variance that I see,
2668.04s:  right? Because the stock price moved here as well, right? And it didn't, these matched perfectly.
2677.80s:  The stock price also changed over the course of this month.
2683.24s:  And again, they matched perfectly. Rapture says lots of people must understand what you're looking at.
2689.16s:  Yeah, I'm definitely noticing that. And that's okay. But what, yeah, what, I don't know,
2697.80s:  I honestly don't know how it's to describe like what I'm looking at.
2700.60s:  I'm essentially trying to detect money variances within the account. And then in doing so simultaneously,
2709.16s:  I'm looking at when he's managing positions and how. So like, for example, on this 5JAN
2715.08s:  expiration, I can clearly see that he managed some of these calls, which we're going to talk about.
2722.52s:  But I need to update this really quick. This needs to be 5JAN,
2728.28s:  22. So with 10 DTE. Because I think that this matters. I don't know how it matters yet,
2735.08s:  but I think it does. So here he exited as well. We'll flag that and we'll flag that. And then here,
2744.52s:  oh no, he didn't exit here. I'm about, he exited here.
2752.28s:  So he, no, I was right. So here he exited
2761.32s:  the tens, which I just would not expect that 15JAN 21 tens.
2771.96s:  Just don't get.
2773.08s:  We have some, we have some homework to do. Gang, I need to figure this out.
2790.20s:  Why, why did he do this? Okay, so now let's update his position.
2795.96s:  He had them for 20. And he exited somewhere between 31 DEES and 5JAN. That shouldn't be too
2806.60s:  difficult to detect. So if we think about 20, what year are we in now? 22. And we look at 31 DEES,
2817.16s:  which is Monday. And then 5JAN is that Saturday. The market would have been closed. I think
2825.72s:  the first. So he would have exited either the second third or the fourth.
2832.52s:  So what's bizarre about this is let's go here. And then let's go to like the end of DEES of 21.
2847.56s:  Something like this.
2859.32s:  So there is a lot here that's, oops messed up my bet.
2870.04s:  I have to get the right options. We have to go to 2020. That's my bet.
2877.80s:  DEES 2020, the 31st. Because these will still trade.
2886.84s:  So now let's take a look at what charting we're reusing. We had a good charting tool that
2897.40s:  let us go back in time. Was Yahoo Finance? When I say good, I think that's relative because it
2901.88s:  seems to be annoying every time we look at it. But I think Yahoo Finance is what we've been using.
2907.32s:  For GameStop. And then let's take a look. We want the full chart.
2920.68s:  And then we need to go back further.
2924.68s:  Let's go to
2937.56s:  I don't want months. I want daily candles. And then let's go back to December 2020.
2955.48s:  So this is where we're at.
2961.00s:  Okay.
2965.40s:  So, what happened here?
2972.76s:  The fifth of Jan.
2981.24s:  So he would have gotten out somewhere in here. So the 31st he posted.
2991.80s:  And then the next trading day was the 4th of Jan. So he would have gotten out not here.
2997.80s:  But he would have gotten out on the 4th.
3003.16s:  Because the 4th or the 5th. I don't think it really matters that much.
3010.04s:  But it would have been the 4th or the 5th. This is
3017.16s:  January 21 right now.
3019.24s:  Cedric says we were looking at 22. No, we're looking at 21. So the positions that were kind of
3026.12s:  catching up on right now are these 15 Jan 21s, the 20s and the 12s in 16 April. But he obviously
3033.96s:  got out of the 10s. Now the thing that is just so strange. Rhino asks Eric what's off about selling
3043.08s:  the 10s. It's a great question. So what I find so weird about taking the 10s down is when we look
3050.92s:  at the movement of GameStop. And again, if we go to, so it wasn't the 31st that he did it,
3059.00s:  we know that for sure. It would have been like January what the 5th we said.
3066.60s:  Whereas that one is update was 5 Jan. So it would have been 4 Jan.
3072.68s:  So the thing that's so interesting about this is
3076.28s:  is the thing that's so interesting about this is that when I look at the options that he had,
3086.28s:  the 10s would have been in a better position to hold than the 20s. But by holding the 20s,
3097.08s:  like I, I, I, I, I, I, I don't know why he would do that. Okay, so let me explain. I know I'm not
3105.40s:  explaining. I'm still it is because I'm like, I'm trying to process at the same time. And by doing
3110.68s:  that, I'm explaining nothing. So I apologize. So let's, let's look at an example. This will probably
3116.04s:  make it a little more clear to you. So when I take a look at his position here. And let's go back
3124.44s:  one to 31 Ds. Okay. So we're looking at two different sets of options. We're looking at 1000 in both.
3134.60s:  Okay. So you don't have to know anything else other than these 10s will have, well, let me ask you,
3144.28s:  what will the delta of these 10 calls be compared to these 20 calls here?
3154.76s:  Why? Why is this?
3161.24s:  Where I know it says, is there more premium in the 10s and you probably wanted more contracts that
3164.68s:  will go in the money eventually, potentially, we'll, we'll be able to sift that out, but it's a great
3169.40s:  point right now. Roy and Clity says, 10 delta way higher. Dr. Zayas, 10 delta will be higher exactly.
3175.16s:  Okay. Great. So now if you had this position on and let's, let's think about another really
3186.04s:  important point. So the day that he's posting this, 31 Ds and then 5 Jan. So now his options expire 15
3198.52s:  Jan. Which of these options is going to have more Thaited a K, the 10s or the 20s? Right now in this
3210.60s:  last update game, stop was at 18 E4. If we go to this point, it's at 17. Which one of these options
3217.72s:  is going to have more Thaited a K? The 20s, blonde, swaisy is correct, the 20s.
3231.24s:  So then why? Why would we keep the 20s on and not the 10s?
3248.44s:  There's essentially one scenario I can think of. Which is confounding to me.
3264.92s:  Rapture says he's hunting for Gamma exposure technically he was still bullish.
3270.68s:  The Gamma exposure doesn't matter, right? So raptures walk me through that thought process.
3275.72s:  Why would he care about Gamma in this case? If he has, let's go back to this scenario where he has
3283.32s:  the 10s and the 20s. Why what does Gamma have to do with this in your mind?
3291.96s:  Roe and Clity says if you're very sure the stock is going to push significantly past the 20 strike,
3296.20s:  they would compound a lot harder than the 10s. They would compound harder. But which one would
3301.08s:  you actually make more money in? Roe and Clity is wrong. Roe and Clity's on a very good and fair
3309.16s:  thought process I understand it, but it's wrong. There's nothing to do with that. Because in this case,
3317.88s:  what I make more money with the 10s or the 20s, I have the same size in both. I have 1000 of both.
3324.68s:  We just said that the 10s are higher delta's.
3330.12s:  Cedric says the 20s, that's incorrect. The 20s would not make more money.
3334.84s:  Cedric says big money have bullish. Again, that's incorrect. The 10s pay more.
3342.28s:  This is a really, really, really important point. So let's, let's look at this together really quick.
3351.64s:  We're looking game stop and we'll just use today for an example. It doesn't really matter.
3358.92s:  And let's take a look. We can look at options that are going to come up in like, what is this?
3364.36s:  Like 10 days. So we'll use like the four ox or whatever. It doesn't matter. The example will be the same.
3369.96s:  So now, let's take a look at
3374.52s:  that.
3376.52s:  Make no mistake says if price drops, the 10 would lose value quicker because they have a higher delta.
3381.24s:  That's correct. Yep. So the 10s would lose more money. But again, I can already tell you that he
3389.16s:  doesn't, he doesn't care about the losing money part. We've already seen him go through this.
3394.60s:  So I don't think that's it either.
3397.48s:  Deswag says it's a guest lock in a known profit and keep the other for a yellow one big volatility.
3401.96s:  Both of them are showing a profit still. So I don't think that's it either.
3406.84s:  Ryan O'S says he's betting on the squeeze. So he's doubling down since you're ready.
3409.96s:  As 50 x is port, he's going for higher risk by losing the tens and going way out of the money.
3414.76s:  He already has this position though. So it's not that either. Right. So he's maintained this position
3422.36s:  for a long time. He established this back in like 25 November of even before that actually.
3432.36s:  So he's had this position for a long time.
3436.76s:  Now to drive this other point home, hopefully to its entirety. I want to show you something.
3445.40s:  So if we take something again, I'm just going to use the same scenario. GameStop was trading at
3451.16s:  1884. So he had options that were $8 in the money. So essentially we can do the same thing in
3459.56s:  this case. We can just pick options that are $8 in the money. So we can go to like these 13s.
3470.52s:  We could pretend that we bought these for whatever price. Let's just say that we got them for
3474.12s:  20 cents or the example and we have a thousand of them. This simulates his tens that are $8 in
3484.28s:  the money. I'm going to turn the other ones off for now so that we can just look at this example
3488.84s:  together. Then with GameStop at 1884, he also had options that were $1.20 higher. So that would
3499.56s:  take us to like these 23s. And again, he had a thousand of those. And then he would have got
3506.60s:  those again in this case for like seven cents. Not slash decimal zero seven. First, let me take a pause.
3516.92s:  Does what I'm doing right now make sense? Do you understand why I'm picking these options to show you?
3528.28s:  What I'm doing is I'm creating a current date example of what his position would look like.
3537.96s:  And what I'm going to show you is how these two different positions behave based on similar size
3545.72s:  moves because Reese says none of this makes sense. But yes, I'm following. That's that's not
3552.44s:  about right. Because I mean, this is all crazy. So what I'm showing you though jokes aside
3560.92s:  is I'm showing you what these tens and these 20s would have looked like for him. And I just want to
3569.24s:  show you the PNL difference because that's a big right. That's a big part of making decisions as a
3575.56s:  trader is understanding the movement of a position. So let's take a look at it. These tens were in
3581.88s:  the money. The 20s that he had were slightly out of the money. So we're using the 13s which serve
3587.08s:  as the tens, the 23s which serve as the 20s. So if I take a look at the 23s, which again look like
3595.80s:  the 20s. And we take a look at a 15% up move. The underlying goes up by 15%. And again,
3603.80s:  I'm using the same entry price that he would have gotten into. So it's literally as close to an
3609.00s:  apples to apples comparison as you can come up with options that are obviously offset by time.
3615.08s:  Apples apples otherwise. So now when I look at this, I see seven cents. And if he got a 15%
3624.60s:  up move in this case, he would have made $283,000. If he would have had a 15% down move,
3632.60s:  he would have still made $12,000 because there's so far in the money. That again is looking at the 23s
3639.72s:  which serve as the 20s. Let's take a look at the 13s. With the 13s, if he gets a 15% movement
3647.56s:  his favor, he makes $1.186 million. That serves as the tens. That's in comparison to 283,000. He would
3659.72s:  make 1.186. If the underlying goes down 15%, he would still make $567,556. So even if it goes down 15%,
3676.68s:  he still would make way more with these options than these other options.
3683.08s:  The other thing to add on top of this is the difference in X-Trensic value.
3689.56s:  These options, let's do the math. The 23s.
3692.76s:  The 23s are trading for, let's call it $1.05 and they're decaying at $6 a day.
3709.64s:  So $6 divided by 105 as a percentage is 5.7%. So again, in a surrogate sense,
3723.40s:  these 20s are decaying away daily at a rate of 5.7% of the options value. If we go to the 13s,
3736.04s:  these are trading for, let's call it 890. Beta on these is $3 divided by 890 times 100.
3749.80s:  These are decaying at 0.34%. These options are decaying light years slower than these.
3764.76s:  On a daily basis as a gross dollar amount, we can do that as well. Let's take a look. He has a
3771.32s:  1,000 contracts. So, and I'm walking you through the math so you could do it yourself. He has a
3777.00s:  1,000 contracts times 6 cents, times 100. He's losing $6,000 a day on this position here.
3787.08s:  If we take a look at this, he has 1,000 contracts at 3 cents. He's losing $3,000 per day.
3796.12s:  So even in a raw, faded, decayed perspective, he does way better holding the in the
3802.44s:  monies, offloading the out of the monies. Make no mistake. Says, what are we trying to prove here?
3808.60s:  Are cave made the wrong decision? No, no, no, no, I'm not saying he made the wrong decision at all.
3813.00s:  What I'm saying is he made a non-optimized decision, which to me means there's a reason why
3822.84s:  the decision was made. I have no fucking clue what it is. But I'm trying to understand the thought
3830.28s:  process behind it because as I look at the decision across every single threshold of managing
3836.60s:  an option straight, it's suboptimal across the board, each individual thing. But again, as they
3842.76s:  said in the beginning, there are like two things that I can think of that somebody would do this for.
3850.04s:  The first reason is because he wanted more dollars. So as we already identified, he went from
3859.00s:  10,000 shares and he expanded to 50,000 shares at 14897. The problem here is let's take a look at
3872.12s:  what that would cost. We can do some some quick math. So we know of 50,000 shares and his basis is
3881.08s:  14, 8,8947. So his cost here equals this times this. So total cost here is $744,735.
3900.92s:  Before he had 10,000 shares, and his basis was 41133, 41133.
3918.52s:  Same thing.
3919.08s:  So now equals this minus this.
3935.88s:  So he needed blood swasey says, my guess he could buy more shares with the premium from the 10
3943.48s:  at the fourth. Unfortunately, it's not true. He already had what he needed. So if you take a look,
3951.08s:  can you guys see the far right hand side over here? Kind of like where some of this scratch stuff is?
3956.36s:  If not, let me know. But that's that this is where the answer is, which is telling me that he
3962.92s:  didn't need it. Because what happened here is he went from 10,000, which was a total basis of 41K
3975.40s:  to 50,000, which is a total basis of 744. The delta between these, the variance is $703,602.
3991.88s:  So that's what he needed. He needed $703,602 in order to put on this new position.
3998.36s:  Take a look at his cash. What do you notice?
4003.56s:  Something very important. Do you see what I see?
4010.04s:  I see.
4020.28s:  Rhino says no cursing. There's children watching. Thank you for the heads up. Happy to call the
4024.84s:  cursing. You got it. Had cash, plenty. Five H is exactly correct. Five H is 100% correct.
4035.88s:  You already had enough money. So he didn't need to sell those options. It wasn't for cash,
4046.92s:  which for me, that would have been the primary reason. Rhino says, I'm talking about me.
4053.80s:  Oh, Rhino, how old are you? If you're on here looking at this stuff, then cursing is probably on
4059.88s:  the board. And I got to be honest with you. I normally curse, but I can easily turn it off if
4068.04s:  there's a good reason. Rhino says 32. Yeah, then you're fucking fine, homie.
4073.72s:  Unbelievable that you're going to cause me to audit and filter myself. And there's no
4079.72s:  fucking reason to unbelievable. So now, because that takes a lot of brain capacity for your boy,
4087.08s:  that's like it can be done, but I have to like really think about it. All right, so all of this stuff
4093.16s:  aside, what do we know now? There's a couple of things that we know with certainty. He did not
4100.60s:  need to sell either of these. He had the money to buy the shares that he wanted. He also across the
4106.28s:  board unwound a completely suboptimal position. And I don't know why. I do not know why. And the reason
4116.20s:  why is because across the board, it would have made so much more sense to take the 20s down.
4124.12s:  And then to leave the tens, he would have made more money in total either direction.
4131.72s:  And they decay way, way, way less quickly. So this is a question mark. This is one of those things
4140.28s:  that I kind of earmark as something weird happened. And I don't know what.
4147.24s:  Brett says, is it possible that he sold some but exercise 400 of them to get the 50k wouldn't
4152.12s:  make any sense to do that? No, he could have, but it would have made no sense. I know that people
4159.08s:  are like really interested in the exercise scenarios and it's fair. Let's talk about it. So let's
4164.68s:  see. These were trading for $8.90. So what's our extrinsic value? These are, let's go. We can use
4173.00s:  the same thing that we're looking at now. It's all the same. So 21, 85 minus 13 is 885. So in this
4185.08s:  scenario, he had 885 intrinsic value. And what I'm doing right now is I'm just showing you an
4192.44s:  example of something. This is obviously looking at the front expiration, meaning today, but it
4198.84s:  doesn't matter. The example will hold about the same. So let's say that he has about five to
4205.00s:  10 cents of extrinsic value. Let's call it 10 cents, which is $10 per contract times a thousand
4210.20s:  contracts. That's essentially lighting $10,000 on fire. I don't think he did that.
4218.60s:  So the reason why I don't think he exercised is because it doesn't, it, again, it's just
4231.88s:  tremendously, economically inefficient. He would be better by just buying. The other thing we can do
4240.52s:  actually is to just figure out essentially what the, what the, oh, let me see. So he added 40,000,
4251.88s:  give me one second. I need to do a little bit of math.
4271.00s:  What I'm doing is I'm going to take a look at the exact basis.
4280.20s:  Blancways, he said, so we sold them and took the cash out of his account. Cash moved for sure.
4300.28s:  I don't know where or why, but cash did move. And this looks like
4309.48s:  day swags says, citing 10,000 on fires when he lit 200 million on fire. I'm not thinking
4316.44s:  or carrying one with the other, but it's funny to think of something was done.
4319.64s:  Well, the thing is, where do you mean that he lit 200 million on fire? Where did that happen?
4324.36s:  Because here's what I can tell you.
4334.60s:  Here's what I, off Putin says from the DFV chat after the 5GIN was posted,
4340.04s:  Redditor, maybe you should use that 1.1 million to buy more shares. You've been sitting on the
4344.12s:  cash for a while. DFV, maybe I will. Yeah, well, that's after this, right? So he already did.
4349.48s:  So here it he bought more. So if we take a look at this, if we look at the total position here,
4360.68s:  here's what we would do. We would take equals. So we would take this times this,
4376.20s:  this, this times this divided by this minus this. So this tells me essentially, let me grab this.
4400.20s:  And then now we need to take the total cost of these positions.
4409.40s:  So this equals this minus this divided by this minus this. That's what he added the shares for.
4430.84s:  So the basis that he got into the shares for was 1759. So this also tells me, again, definitively,
4443.32s:  that he did not exercise because the basis is much higher than what his strike was.
4460.84s:  So,
4463.00s:  Cedric says, sorry for spam, but market makers aren't hedging for exercise for the tens. They are. Of course, they are. What are you talking about?
4473.48s:  That's exactly what they're doing. Uh-oh, Mills hit me up for dinner.
4479.40s:  I'm going to try Mexican. See if I can get Mexican through.
4487.32s:  Cedric says they already did. It's my point. Lauren says no Mexican. David Lauren. That's what I was going to go for.
4497.64s:  Fuck. Then maybe no Mexican. Cedric says for the 20s, they still have some hedging to go. Yeah,
4505.64s:  but it's not a big position. Like he's not going to create a gamma ramp for himself by,
4512.92s:  by that at all. There's nowhere near enough in that case. Yeah. So I don't think so.
4527.64s:  Caws on Mexican. Yeah, I'm going to try Mexican. I'll see what else she comes back with.
4531.56s:  It'll be a fight for the ages, but we'll see what we can do. I mean, I feel like Mexican would be great.
4541.48s:  Who is in the mood for some Mexican?
4547.40s:  Rapsha says, what if the 20s had a bunch of OI at the time? I don't think that matters. I don't think
4552.68s:  that would change anything here.
4559.64s:  Blancs ways. He says, how much did he sell the tens for? We could figure that out. I don't really
4563.88s:  care enough to if I'm being honest with you, but we could figure it out by looking at
4569.40s:  the change in the portfolio. It would just be a little bit annoying, I think, and not actually
4575.88s:  very elucidating. So yeah. Okay. So I think we've analyzed this enough at this point,
4588.60s:  though, that we know a few things happened. We know without a doubt that there's some really
4594.84s:  strange behavior here. We know that he clearly chose to take the in the monies down while holding
4600.68s:  that out of the monies, which are still decaying, we know that that doesn't actually make sense from
4607.32s:  a holding perspective. It just doesn't make sense because no matter what, he's going to
4616.52s:  he doesn't stand to make as much and he doesn't stand to make as much to the downside if things
4623.08s:  go against him. So this is just a very, very anomalous day and I'm actually going to add a note here.
4633.08s:  The 21, the 20s.
4643.00s:  Good to lose
4648.44s:  around 6K per day in theta. The tens were at 3K.
4658.28s:  I didn't need money by the 40k shares.
4667.40s:  Add enough in the account already. Just a couple notes for you boy because don't really know.
4681.88s:  Lauren, I don't know if you're on the same page is my wife, but Mel literally goes,
4686.84s:  is there anything that's not Mexican that you're open to this evening?
4695.40s:  Poor Mel. I've told you guys, I don't really care about eating so like I'll eat the same stuff
4700.68s:  over and over and over again and not really care. But I'll see maybe we'll try like Italian.
4708.44s:  Feel like Italian is an okay, compromise.
4716.28s:  Italian's always good.
4721.16s:  All right, so that Lauren, okay, so it looks like
4727.08s:  so Reese, fun fact. There was, we, we, Mel and I, after we have dinner, we always go for a walk
4733.72s:  because it's good for your digestive system and we started that a while ago.
4739.08s:  And one night she was telling me like on the walk that she literally tuned into the live stream
4744.52s:  at some point to figure out if I ordered dinner yet. And it was like right as I was ordering dinner,
4750.36s:  which is hilarious that she was using that is like the benchmark. I thought that that was hilarious.
4756.28s:  But yeah, I think, oh, there's also this other place that she really likes called Carl Strauss.
4767.96s:  I actually bet she'll go for Carl Strauss. Except I can't send it.
4777.48s:  I bet you she'll, she'll jump on this one.
4780.20s:  So here we'll do probably like a burger, a bet.
4794.76s:  And then I think we're good. All of the good chicken tacos, never mind.
4802.68s:  We gotta do chicken tacos. I don't know about fish tacos. That's never been my, my ish.
4812.04s:  I don't know if that's acceptable or not.
4818.68s:  Fish tacos, I feel like you're okay, but definitely not my preferred.
4825.64s:  Here we go.
4832.28s:  Rhino says, would you ever live in the Keys or Puerto Rico? No, definitely not the keys.
4839.56s:  The keys, they have just a disgusting amount of insects like flies and shit that tend to just
4849.24s:  destroy my life. So yeah, definitely not that. I would be down for,
4864.28s:  I don't know, I think something like Puerto Rico I would do temporarily or do it for periods of time.
4872.76s:  But yeah, I don't think that that would be my, I don't think that would be my go-to personally.
4877.48s:  It's a little, little not my climate as I consider it.
4887.24s:  Perfect. We are Gucci.
4891.72s:  These swags says does San Diego have a culture for a certain food specialty? Probably Mexican,
4896.76s:  I would say. Yeah, I don't, I don't really care for Californian food much. It's kind of,
4903.72s:  I don't know, I view it as like very whatever. I much, much, much prefer New York stuff. New
4909.64s:  York food is just light years better in general, I believe. But it's not like parable, but it's definitely
4918.12s:  not great. Sweet. All right, so we're on to the next.
4927.56s:  Rhino says I'll be in San Diego, Carl's bad February for a con, yeah dude, if you come out here,
4932.52s:  let me know. Hit me up. I am around. Sometimes the, it depends on when in February because hopefully my
4941.08s:  back will be better, well, the sciatica stuff will be back, will be better by then because I'm going
4945.00s:  to keep rehabbing with the disc stuff so that we're going to get back on our, our, our travel schedule.
4951.16s:  But all right, so now we need to go catch up and we need to move on. So now we did five JAN,
4960.60s:  so now we need 11 Jan.
4965.24s:  Long Sways says new guests kept his buying power increased the share position a lot.
4970.28s:  Uh, could have been a, but I don't actually see why. I mean, we'll find out.
4977.08s:  But I don't see why he would do that. All right, let's take a look now at we're in
4986.68s:  11 Jan 21. So 11 Jan 21. Total gain here is now 1236974.03. The cash on hand is about the same. So 1128842.2.
5013.96s:  And then the total value is 3158842.2. Same same. So I don't see the, the large variance at this point
5028.04s:  between the account value. So it does look like he previously pulled capital out. Again, I'm not sure why.
5038.44s:  And then he has the same residual positions. The fascinating part is he still has these 20 calls.
5049.56s:  That's crazy at this point. That's absolutely crazy. So he's still holding these 15 Jan 20s. They literally expire
5064.12s:  in nine days. 15 Jan, no, four days. My bad. What on earth?
5085.56s:  I just don't understand this.
5088.12s:  Fascinating. So same position now. We're long 50. Dr. Zay says, does him holding 20s the longer
5101.00s:  influence the gamma ramp now? Not really. Yeah, no, it's a fair speculation. I think it's totally
5106.04s:  fair. That's kind of the whole point is to, you know, take guess this here. I just do not see
5111.40s:  at all why he would do this. So 1, 2, 2, 7, 2, 3 on those.
5122.36s:  8723.
5128.28s:  153.
5129.56s:  183.
5133.56s:  Yeah, see like this is the problem. If you go back to December, even when so this is theta decay,
5141.40s:  this is literally a perfect, perfect, perfect example of theta decay for you. So let's.
5147.96s:  Yeah, this is literally perfect. So when we look at his position on these 20s, we can see that
5161.08s:  his total gain here is $289,000. This is when GameStop was trading at 2015. Now if we go to where we
5171.88s:  are now, 11 Jan, GameStop is trading at 1994. So about the same price, but these 20s are now
5181.24s:  only showing him $122,700. So that's like $150 grand almost that essentially went away just because of
5192.60s:  theta decay. And again, there's a slight delta component to it, but it's slight. The majority of
5198.44s:  this variance comes from theta decay, which is crazy. And again, it's it's why managing these 20s
5205.32s:  earlier just makes sense across the board. I just don't understand this 13th.
5214.60s:  I just don't get it. This is crazy. 13 Jan 21. Total gain is 3,
5225.32s:  6, 6, 3, 8, 6, 6, 3, 8, 6, 6, 9, 7, 4, 0, 3.
5235.88s:  Cash is 1128842.2. And then value is 5, 7, 8, 8, 8, 4, 2.2.
5252.44s:  So big accommodating move. Let me double check these numbers.
5262.12s:  I think I missed this one out. I'm going to move this over so I can see better. There we go.
5276.76s:  3866974. 3866. Yeah, this is wrong. 38669.
5294.36s:  And so before 03, that's correct.
5307.96s:  And he's still in these. And now he has two days of expiration. So he's taking them all the way in.
5325.32s:  Which is interesting because is a look back over this. I can see that he exited some of these longer
5336.60s:  term the 15 Jan 21s, the 17s and the 15s. And he got out of those like two months, a month,
5342.52s:  slash two months in advance. Which is nuts. Absolutely nuts. Okay.
5356.52s:  Another thing I'm noticing is we're now updating very close to one another. And I don't know why.
5372.52s:  But these are 21s. These are all these should all be 2020.
5387.96s:  Find 2021, replace with 2020.
5391.96s:  And then these should be 21.
5407.00s:  So now we're at the 14th. I don't. I also don't understand this or team Jan.
5414.52s:  And little gain 1, 2, 4, 5, 500.
5418.68s:  And then,
5420.68s:  hash 2, 6, 0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 3, 8, value, 7, 3, 6, 8, 6, 0, 1, 3, 8.
5439.32s:  Double check my numbers. No, I fucked up. I did the day gain. Man, your boys off tonight.
5445.64s:  39, 8, 2, 750, about 4, 3,
5453.00s:  39, 8, 2,
5456.04s:  754, 3, okay. 2600, 613, that's good. 7368, 613, that's good.
5465.24s:  And there's a slight variance between these,
5473.96s:  like a couple hundred bucks, so it could be a rounding, a rounding thing.
5483.72s:  Interesting. And so now,
5486.76s:  on the 14th, so he didn't exercise because the quantity is the same price is the same.
5496.84s:  So there's no exercise here.
5501.24s:  He didn't add any more options. He simply took more cash in,
5507.24s:  and he exited essentially with 1 DTE. So he exited the 20s, the 15 Jan, 21s,
5516.04s:  with 20 DTE, and he's holding this 16 April, 21, 12s. So this is 1 DTE is where he exited.
5529.64s:  So let's grab that formatting here, and then let's continue.
5538.68s:  And then I'll go through, let's finish out January, because it looks like there's a handful left.
5549.56s:  Yeah, let's get through January, release most of it, and then we can switch and pivot to seeing like
5558.92s:  recent news, recent tin foil, so we can spend a little more time on like recent stuff. We'll
5563.48s:  just spend the first part doing this, 21, because this is, I find this stuff interesting,
5570.44s:  but I also imagine some of you might not find it quite as enthralling, but I still do want to make
5576.60s:  sure that we get through all of this, even if it takes a little while, that I think it's really
5580.92s:  important. So the total gain is 3932 750.43, I messed up any there, 43, and then cash, 2600479.97, value,
5610.92s:  7318479.97.
5623.00s:  This looks like it matches. So I think that this is just a
5628.68s:  rounding issue that's okay. And then we're holding the 16 April, 21, I'll just do 16 April,
5644.52s:  12 calls. And now the expiration for these is 16 April, 21, and then today's 19 Jan, 21,
5657.00s:  these are 87 DTE. Okay. No change in shares, and still sitting on
5675.40s:  interesting. Still sitting on, man, why is that? So we still sitting on $2.6 million, but the part
5684.76s:  that I actually don't understand is why is cash went down. It's cash went down by $121, and I don't know
5691.72s:  why. Nothing else changed. The numbers all line up, so the variance in like portfolio value and
5700.68s:  stuff lines up. I just don't understand that. The 19th will do the 22nd, which shows
5715.96s:  no change again. This is 22 Jan, but he's posting way more frequently. Again, way more frequently,
5723.56s:  starting from December. Little gain is 7 7 9 0 250.43. I imagine some of it has to be him being like
5734.68s:  any of us would be, which is just being like, this is fucking crazy. And he's got to enjoy
5742.44s:  like showing people how nuts this portfolio is going. 1 7 5 9 7 9 9 7.
5759.16s:  So clear match there. And he's still holding those Aprils. And now 22 Jan.
5772.52s:  21 840 Te.
5780.76s:  And we ride on.
5786.60s:  We're going to need more of these. Let us continue.
5793.72s:  22 Jan.
5798.68s:  25
5804.52s:  25
5806.44s:  Everyone. Okay.
5811.00s:  And then
5823.16s:  22 Jan.
5826.04s:  Total gain here is 8269 353.71.
5834.20s:  Cash is 484 0638.96.
5843.64s:  Value is 13 880.138.96.
5853.16s:  So money moved again. Not much, but some is account value should have been 2.704. And it's 2719.
5869.16s:  Just in terms of account variance between those.
5876.04s:  So as account moved 2.7. It should have moved 2.719. So it looks like some cash came out.
5883.48s:  So we got those. And then now we went forward three days. So it's 81 DTE.
5893.40s:  And we continue. I have to move my little chicken scratch math here. Out of the way.
5901.56s:  And then cool. Well, I'll take a pause so far. And anything jumping out to anybody that maybe I'm
5908.20s:  missing because so far it looks like we're holding. I'm a little surprised that he's allowing the
5916.44s:  cash to come up as high as it is. Right. So if we take a look at the positions, we can see some
5923.72s:  of this was trimmed off. So we can see that the 16 the 16 April the 12s. They were at a thousand.
5934.68s:  So he's took he's taken 200 of those down. So that's why we see this change in that. So he's
5942.68s:  holding this, but it's a partial profit. So this would be partial profit on 16 April.
5954.28s:  12 calls. And he did 200. Lots sold. And this is 81 DTE. So really far out in time.
5965.64s:  So this is one of the great mysteries that I have in my mind when I look at him.
5973.16s:  Let's take a look at what this look like on the day. So this is 25, Jan.
5991.32s:  I want to zoom it in so that it's like just a month.
5994.92s:  So the 25th.
6007.72s:  It started popping up massively. So this looks like him taking profits. This is like the first time
6019.24s:  I've gotten a glimpse of him doing something that looks like taking profits.
6024.76s:  Which is really interesting because if I look at this from a timing perspective,
6030.84s:  I again, from like a standard trading line of thought, this is not at all where I would take
6037.72s:  profits personally. And it's because it's like it's been trending sideways for a while.
6043.48s:  And then it starts really exploding up. I mean to me, this looks like exactly where I wouldn't
6050.20s:  want to take profits. I would want to let them go. And the options still have over 80 days to
6055.16s:  expiration. So just yet another really, really interesting thing.
6066.92s:  RoeingClitty says getting up to 2.6 million wasn't taking profits. It not the same.
6074.20s:  So what I notice in these other trades here is these other trades like exiting the 17s and the 15s,
6084.84s:  I would call that taking profits because in this case, it's very clear that these still had
6091.24s:  plenty of time left. And he's taking some value off the table. Then we have this example with the
6097.80s:  10s and the 20s, which is not about taking profit at all. That's very clear because he holds them
6103.96s:  all the way in almost to 10 DTE for the 10s. And he takes those down again, which doesn't make sense.
6112.60s:  So this one is very confusing to me. Then he holds the 20s essentially up until one DTE,
6125.24s:  which also is not profit-taking. In that case, his hand is forced by time.
6131.00s:  So here, when he's managing further out in time, I consider that profit-taking because it's being
6136.36s:  done when the options aren't expiring. There's plenty of time left. That's also what I notice here
6142.04s:  is that there is still plenty of time left in these options. But the fact that he's choosing to
6147.24s:  take profits there tells me that it's based on something resembling to profit, it's not being
6153.80s:  based on time. This is the fun stuff to me. To be able to analyze this level of detail and to
6160.44s:  gather these kinds of components is so interesting to me. Future Whale 747, I literally love that name.
6168.44s:  Does have you ever investigated someone's trades the way you're doing with Keith right now? No,
6172.20s:  absolutely not. And to be honest, the majority of the reason why I'm doing this is because I'm doing
6179.40s:  it with you guys. I think that this adds a lot of color to the story. But I personally,
6186.84s:  like if I was doing this in my own research, I wouldn't go into this layer of detail. What I would
6192.60s:  do is just gloss over the trades. But since the entire GameStop story has a really critical component
6200.44s:  being Roryne Kitty, then I think that like understanding his movements here is really,
6210.84s:  really important. So yeah, no, definitely not to like going along by line like this. Because
6217.64s:  I've said it a million times, I really don't care what other traders do. Like it makes no
6223.80s:  difference to me. I'm going to trade the way that I trade, the way that I've been trading for
6228.52s:  almost 20 years now. And I'm going to keep doing just that. So what other people do is generally
6234.44s:  completely, I don't care. Now for him, it's very unique because he's also this strange actor in the
6243.72s:  space that does things so differently. That's very, very fun to watch. So yeah, it's definitely unique.
6251.72s:  The layer of detail I'm going here. Blancway, as he says, but at one DT, he still made the most
6258.28s:  profit. No. Let's double check. So at one DTE that was on the 14 Jan update,
6273.32s:  well, they were gone. 13, they were here. Yeah, definitely. So he, those are at 31, 40,
6290.04s:  30. Yeah. So he would have made over a million dollars on those calls here. So definitely,
6297.32s:  he ended up getting at the very, and again, like this is this is the stuff that I'm talking about.
6303.96s:  I personally do not view this as some sort of like really great timing. In this case, he got
6313.88s:  really lucky with respect to the pop happening when it did to drive the profit that much. Because,
6321.32s:  again, like if you go back to 11 Jan, his total gain was $122,000. And it popped to over a million
6330.92s:  in two days later. So like that is here, fucking luck. And the other component that these are tied to,
6341.96s:  you know, expiring four days from here. So what I can tell you is that Roy and Kitty, at this point,
6349.40s:  he was, these were going to be whatever they were going to be. Either he was going to take him in
6353.48s:  and he was going to lose this amount of money, which he didn't care about, obviously,
6356.84s:  or they were going to be something he wanted to take down. And that's why he chose to not take it
6361.16s:  into expiration, but take it down before expiration is because they had perceivably made enough that he
6366.76s:  cared enough. And he would have taken them down either the, well, not the 13th, he would have taken
6372.52s:  them down on the 14th. Because I think you guys have told me he posted these after the market closed.
6377.32s:  Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, in this case, in this case, it is without a doubt, just magical dose of luck
6391.24s:  that led to that kind of pop in that time frame, which is incredible. Super, super cool to see,
6396.84s:  but yeah, definitely very lucky. Because he would have taken them down here on the 14th.
6403.08s:  Blanc's ways he said he paid less than $1 and exited when it multiplied heavily. He just
6412.28s:  yellowed his money and got less sensitive with time. Sort of. Yeah, sort of. I think there's a
6425.00s:  little bit more to this than just that, but yeah, in this case, he, at least with those options,
6432.04s:  it was just very fortunate that they came in where they did. That's all.
6438.68s:  At least that's the way I look at it. That's not to say, again, that there's not
6445.16s:  some element of skill. Obviously, there's an element of skill, but the problem is with this
6450.36s:  specific scenario, it was within a couple days of expiration. And he essentially had a 10th
6457.08s:  of what these ended up showing. So that ended up just being really, really fortunate timing.
6464.84s:  But yeah, let's go to 25th. Yeah, we have like four left of these. So this is perfect.
6474.12s:  And then we can jump into the 10 foil. So now actually is a great time to start thinking about
6479.08s:  any of the 10 foil stuff or any theories or anything specifically that we want to take a look at.
6485.32s:  I think we should take a look at the movements on Friday for sure. But then if there's anything
6490.28s:  else that you're interested, this would be a good time to start jending that part of your brain up.
6495.64s:  17 234 853.71.
6502.12s:  4, 8, 4, 0, 6, 3, 8, .95.
6513.60s:  Value, 22, 8, 4, 5, 6, 3, 8, .95.
6526.36s:  And we're still holding the remainder. So we're holding
6532.12s:  816 April, 12 calls.
6539.12s:  And this is now 79 DTE.
6543.12s:  Well, no other change.
6546.12s:  Count value same, no change.
6552.12s:  This is now 20... wait, what?
6560.12s:  This is 26, Jan, I fucked up the date.
6563.12s:  So this is 80 DTE.
6566.12s:  And then now is on 27, Jan.
6572.12s:  27, Jan 21.
6574.12s:  Total gain, 3, 3, 3, 7, 8.
6582.12s:  Aha, 008.63.
6588.12s:  Ash 13, 840.298.
6592.12s:  840, what do you guys notice here?
6595.12s:  Value 47, 973.
6601.12s:  298.84.
6611.12s:  Oh, cash delta. I missed something up here.
6623.12s:  There's something very, very different here.
6627.12s:  So 33, 37, 8, 008.63 is correct.
6632.12s:  13, 840, 298.84 is correct.
6637.12s:  Then 47, 973.298.84 is correct.
6647.12s:  25, 12, 7, 25, 12.
6651.12s:  And you also pulled money out of the account.
6656.12s:  So here we had another partial profit,
6661.12s:  which was 300, 300 lots,
6668.12s:  holding 500 of the 16 April of calls.
6679.12s:  So this tells me something really important, actually.
6684.12s:  Of a lot of me says,
6688.12s:  January 27 was the day that the buy button was turned off
6691.12s:  for Robinhood users, got it.
6694.12s:  Yeah, so what this tells me is that he's scaling out,
6701.12s:  like he's absolutely scaling out.
6704.12s:  I can watch it real time.
6707.12s:  He first started scaling out on the 25th here.
6713.12s:  He let that run.
6716.12s:  Then on the 27th, he started scaling out more,
6721.12s:  but it was a relatively relatively light scale out.
6729.12s:  And then he kept the shares,
6732.12s:  and he kept still 500 of those contracts.
6737.12s:  But again, this tells me very much that this is profit taking again.
6743.12s:  This is not him looking for value.
6746.12s:  This is not him waiting for a specific amount of time to pass
6751.12s:  or just to see what happens over a course of time.
6754.12s:  These options still have 79 DTE.
6757.12s:  And he just opted to start scaling out.
6761.12s:  That's exactly what that tells me.
6765.12s:  Same amount of shares so far.
6769.12s:  That's the 27th, 28th.
6775.12s:  Total gain here, 18, 5, 7, 5, 0, 0, 8, 6, 3,
6785.12s:  hash, 13.
6790.12s:  It looks like exactly the same as this.
6792.12s:  So I'm just going to copy and paste it.
6795.12s:  And then value is 33, 17, 0, 29, 8, 8, 4.
6808.12s:  So he's also clearly leaving the majority of...
6815.12s:  He's leaving the majority of capital in the account,
6819.12s:  but he's taking like 10,000, 20,000.
6823.12s:  He's taking little bits of money out.
6825.12s:  Here, he took 15,000, which again, that's super clear to see.
6832.12s:  Here, again, like another 10,000.
6835.12s:  So he's taking normal amounts of regular people money out
6840.12s:  of these accounts.
6843.12s:  And now, so he's still holding...
6847.12s:  Holding 516 April 12 calls.
6853.12s:  And this is after another day's pass of 78 DTE.
6859.12s:  And then 29 Jan is the last one here.
6872.12s:  This is the same thing.
6874.12s:  28...
6875.12s:  Oh, I fucked this data.
6877.12s:  This is 28 Jan, 21.
6880.12s:  And then this is 29 Jan, 21.
6885.12s:  Okay.
6887.12s:  So total gain 31, 471, 258.63,
6897.12s:  Ash 13, 817.
6902.12s:  Again, more money moved here.
6906.12s:  No changes.
6907.12s:  So it looks like he pulled money out 295.47.
6913.12s:  Value 46, 043,
6919.12s:  545, up 47.
6924.12s:  Oh no, it lines up.
6928.12s:  No money out.
6936.12s:  Look at the last price on that.
6939.12s:  35.
6944.12s:  That's awesome.
6949.12s:  Offputing says over 10 million and unrealized gains on the 12 calls on the 27th
6953.12s:  of 500 remaining contracts cost him 10.26.
6957.12s:  Yeah, definitely.
6959.12s:  Red says crazy that he didn't sell any covered calls at those levels.
6962.12s:  Yeah, I actually agree with you.
6964.12s:  I would have been especially on 50,000.
6967.12s:  You could have absolutely offered.
6970.12s:  That's another thing that I think is important to know actually now that you mention it.
6974.12s:  Is the fact that I...
6976.12s:  People think, seem to think that he's like running covered calls a lot.
6981.12s:  I don't actually see that.
6983.12s:  I see essentially no evidence that he runs covered calls at all.
6988.12s:  But that doesn't mean that he doesn't.
6990.12s:  It just means that I don't really see it.
6992.12s:  So yeah.
6994.12s:  Cool.
6995.12s:  Well, we got through January of 2021.
7001.12s:  And our next one will be the first of Feb.
7005.12s:  I'm going to take a pause though on this part of things so that we can start taking a look at.
7014.12s:  Just some current date stuff if you guys want or any other like.
7019.12s:  I'm going to take a look at the series or thesis that we want to take a look at.
7023.12s:  And then we'll obviously pick back up with this next week.
7026.12s:  But I did tell Newton that I would give him an update.
7030.12s:  So I'm going to text him really quick.
7032.12s:  Alright, so ran through what should I tell Newton?
7037.12s:  The main things I noticed are running through January.
7042.12s:  So January 2021.
7045.12s:  So I'm going to take a look at the first of a few themes.
7050.12s:  The first theme that I noticed is that.
7055.12s:  Some well not even some one specific one particular.
7060.12s:  One particular.
7063.12s:  The options trade.
7066.12s:  Exiting in the money and keeping out of the money.
7074.12s:  Didn't make sense.
7078.12s:  But ended up.
7081.12s:  Working out of lucky price movement.
7088.12s:  Meading.
7090.12s:  Two days.
7093.12s:  Expiration.
7097.12s:  Pam says tell Newton that his hair is glorious.
7100.12s:  Okay. Pam says your hair is glorious.
7108.12s:  And.
7110.12s:  Okay.
7113.12s:  This is that previously, I can see a habit, so I can see some habit of profit taking, where
7130.88s:  options have longer timeframes remaining, but he takes either full or partial exits.
7147.04s:  I can also see there are several instances of smaller amounts of money,
7157.36s:  so around 10k, being withdrawn from the account a few times per month.
7178.56s:  What else do we see?
7179.36s:  Dark Mark says that the chat says hello.
7199.92s:  And what else do I see?
7202.96s:  The other thing I noticed is that he does hold large cash positions for a little bit longer than
7213.20s:  I would expect. So that's another thing I would note. He maintains relatively large cash positions
7225.52s:  and doesn't immediately reallocate capital to either existing trades or placing new ones.
7245.68s:  That's my report to our friend Newton. I'm going to grab a replacement sparkling water super
7265.28s:  fast and then we will dive in and we'll take a look at the movement on Friday and then we'll see
7274.48s:  if we have any ideas about that so we'll be right back.
7334.72s:  Right. We back at it and we have some Tylenol.
7349.04s:  I don't know, I'm bound.
7355.44s:  A rowing clitty says I want to see if our C's purchases in the past when dark pool or if they
7361.68s:  went lit. It doesn't really matter if they go dark pool or lit because you'll still see it in
7368.24s:  the volume. But yeah, let's take a look. So first to do that, I would need you to help me find where
7382.16s:  is that on Newton sheet? Do we have a log of RC purchases? I think so, right?
7392.00s:  I don't know where anything is on this. So yeah, I would need your help to help me see where those are
7407.92s:  on the sheet. Where on the sheet? Walk me on a target. Yeah, if you show me where this
7412.32s:  happy to take a look and then we can go through and try to identify where it would have happened.
7417.84s:  But I don't know off the top of my head personally where that would have been.
7426.24s:  Check the discord for link to RC's 13D filing. Okay, cool. Let me pop in there.
7435.28s:  Got it. Okay. Thank you.
7447.20s:  And then. Okay.
7456.40s:  13D. This is from 10 June.
7464.40s:  Wait, what am I looking at?
7472.40s:  What did you give me?
7478.08s:  Vladimiro, where do you get the, where do you get the, like, where are you getting those from?
7489.44s:  And then, Brookliddy says scroll down to aug 2020. Got it.
7494.08s:  Yeah.
7505.36s:  Here.
7511.44s:  Of Vladimir says Edgar. Okay, got it. Yeah, if you,
7516.16s:  if you have a list of the, the actual filings, that would be super helpful.
7529.60s:  RC Ventures. Yep. Okay.
7533.20s:  Okay.
7539.20s:  36, 847. This is from reason, though.
7544.56s:  This is 10 June, 2020. Is this the one that we want to look at or do we want to look at this one that was.
7554.24s:  Further back.
7564.16s:  Okay.
7566.40s:  Because we can figure out first filed, aug 20. Okay, cool. So then let's start here.
7572.48s:  So the first thing is let's see then.
7576.72s:  If I grab.
7578.72s:  Where is my stuff here? We go here.
7585.60s:  Let's see.
7586.56s:  I'll for back. We can go at this.
7589.28s:  You know me.
7591.20s:  And then this was.
7594.16s:  You told me 28 aug.
7616.56s:  Not a.
7628.24s:  I don't think that that's a limitation in terms of it didn't happen. We just might not know it.
7635.52s:  So it probably be easier to look at the, the more recent one.
7640.16s:  So the more recent one you gave me is from 10 June, 2024. So let's look at that one really fast.
7646.56s:  And.
7648.56s:  And June.
7659.36s:  And June, 2024.
7664.24s:  Nothing.
7669.52s:  This just doesn't sound right.
7676.24s:  I don't understand this. Weird.
7684.32s:  So I can't see here at least for the time being.
7688.24s:  I don't know why that part's kind of interesting to me.
7690.88s:  Yeah.
7705.04s:  Yeah, I don't.
7707.12s:  I don't get it.
7712.56s:  From this Friday. Yeah, I looked at it in Friday, but that's a good fact check to see.
7717.68s:  So what the 2020.
7721.04s:  Oh, great call.
7733.20s:  It's got to be something with.
7739.52s:  No, I mean, because this is.
7743.68s:  It's got to be something with the date tool.
7746.16s:  I think that's what it is.
7748.16s:  Because notice how.
7753.36s:  Wait a minute.
7758.56s:  What the fuck is happening right now.
7764.96s:  Something is.
7767.28s:  Hold on, something's wrong here.
7770.64s:  Because yesterday, I'm selecting yesterday.
7774.72s:  And it's showing me the 19th.
7778.00s:  And it's showing today is the what.
7784.48s:  What the hell is going on right now.
7793.36s:  I'm just going to kill this one.
7797.04s:  And then let's grab a new one.
7799.84s:  And let's see if we can fix this.
7802.56s:  So GME let's take a look at.
7805.76s:  The 20th and see if that filter.
7807.28s:  Okay, so that filter worked.
7808.56s:  Okay, great.
7809.76s:  Here we go.
7812.08s:  All right, so we're back at it.
7813.52s:  So here's the 20th.
7814.96s:  This filtered correctly.
7816.24s:  So that's good.
7817.84s:  So now let's take a look at.
7820.88s:  You told me it was.
7826.56s:  10 June.
7827.84s:  Let's go to 10 June.
7832.32s:  Okay, great.
7833.04s:  This is good.
7836.32s:  So I can see.
7839.12s:  This let's sort it by size.
7841.36s:  And see if his order went through.
7843.52s:  Because his order was.
7847.76s:  36, 847.
7853.76s:  So it looks like his order.
7855.76s:  If it went through.
7857.76s:  So it's going to be.
7859.76s:  So it looks like his order.
7861.12s:  If it went through the dark pool, it was broken up.
7863.68s:  It didn't go through as a solid order.
7870.08s:  That's the date that it went through, right?
7873.52s:  Yeah, date of yep.
7875.12s:  10 June 2024.
7876.64s:  10 June 2024.
7878.00s:  Yep.
7879.12s:  So this would have captured it.
7882.72s:  So it tells me that his order didn't go through.
7885.36s:  RC's order specifically.
7887.28s:  Didn't go through in a solid block.
7890.00s:  So that means it would have been broken up.
7892.08s:  To some degree for whatever reason.
7895.20s:  So yeah.
7900.56s:  36, 847 or as total holdings.
7902.80s:  Oh, okay, got it.
7903.68s:  Sorry.
7905.28s:  I wasn't paying attention.
7906.80s:  Where's the, I see the soul voting power.
7909.04s:  So where does it show the.
7912.32s:  I see this is just a standard update.
7914.32s:  Yeah, okay.
7916.32s:  Yeah.
7916.72s:  So where was his last transaction?
7920.32s:  That's what I need.
7922.40s:  Because I see what you mean.
7923.52s:  This is just talking about his total.
7925.36s:  This is just the standard amendment.
7926.80s:  Yeah.
7927.84s:  I went through it a little too fast.
7929.92s:  Sorry.
7933.28s:  So.
7936.08s:  Yeah, let's take a look at August.
7938.00s:  We can take a look at the August dates and see if anything pops up there.
7942.16s:  The problem though is I need to know how many shares
7944.72s:  from the Edgar filing.
7945.92s:  Can you guys drop that in the discord?
7948.00s:  So I can take a look.
7949.92s:  Dr. Zayas, is that what you dropped in here?
7953.28s:  No, that's from December.
7956.32s:  Ryven says 9 June 2023.
7959.20s:  Okay, let's take a look at that one.
7962.08s:  Okay, cool.
7962.72s:  253,000 shares.
7964.08s:  Thank you.
7965.20s:  So let's go to 2023.
7967.12s:  Okay.
7973.84s:  9 June 2023.
7982.00s:  Okay.
7983.68s:  And 253,000 shares.
7986.48s:  So yeah, here it got broken up as well.
7989.28s:  Not a solid.
7992.40s:  Not a solid transaction.
7994.16s:  So the only reason why this really matters is the fact that it's not like a solid transaction
8000.64s:  means we can't clearly delineate when they've happened is what it boils down to.
8008.96s:  So yeah, it's limited efficacy to tell whether it went through dark pool or let exchange.
8015.04s:  But again, remember, if it goes through a dark pool, it's still like if it's reported here,
8020.40s:  this isn't an internalized order.
8022.08s:  It's why we can see it.
8023.76s:  So the fact that we can see it tells me it's not internalized and it tells me this is still
8027.92s:  hitting the consolidated tape, right?
8030.16s:  Because that's another thing is I see people mix up what this volume thing means.
8034.00s:  That volume is cumulative.
8036.56s:  So you'll see if you sort by time and go down, the volume is always going to be less.
8041.76s:  And then as you go up, it's always going to be higher.
8044.48s:  And then the volume that you see here is going to match if we look at it on a chart.
8049.28s:  So if we go to, for example, we'll use the most recent one.
8053.84s:  So let's go to yesterday.
8058.48s:  That's doing the weird thing again, but whatever, go to today.
8061.20s:  And you can see that the volume here is 62 million, right?
8064.08s:  So that's telling me that the volume for GameStop over the day was 62 million or whatever
8069.04s:  at the point that that came in.
8070.16s:  If I look at the volume here, the volume is 61,919,000.
8076.32s:  The volume is 62 million.
8078.72s:  So I see a lot of people kind of confused by that.
8083.68s:  But that's the volume that you see here and the trades that you see here are going to hit
8089.92s:  the consolidated tape. That's why they're here.
8092.64s:  But the nature of a dark pool is that they're slightly delayed.
8097.52s:  That's the only reason why they exist is to try to prevent front running.
8101.84s:  But it's not the name is way more nefarious than what they actually are.
8106.80s:  I think most people confuse dark pool orders with internalized orders, which are very different.
8113.12s:  Internalized orders do not hit the consolidated tape.
8116.88s:  However, an internalized order at some point would have already hit the tape
8123.12s:  because of the original transaction that occurred.
8125.12s:  Now it doesn't help with any sort of sense of market efficiency,
8128.56s:  transparent markets at all.
8130.16s:  So that's the problem with internalized orders is that we're not seeing updated transactions there.
8135.92s:  So when we're looking at this, this is all stuff that still eventually hits the consolidated tape.
8144.88s:  That Lauren says on Friday, a lot of volume came in pre and after hours.
8148.24s:  Is that why?
8149.68s:  Partially, it's because a lot of larger institutions will access the market during pre and post trading
8155.76s:  hours. It's because there's also a tendency for larger trades to come in towards the
8164.72s:  beginning of the day and towards the end of the day. You'll find this almost any single day
8169.36s:  that you look at the market where if we do, let's do like a five day, five minute chart,
8174.80s:  if you take a look at the volume mid day, pretty much every day, even here where volume was really high
8181.28s:  on a relative basis, you'll still see volume slump towards the middle of the day.
8186.56s:  This is very, very common. Now there's always anomalies, right?
8190.08s:  So volume spiked up for this a little bit, but then still came down.
8193.92s:  That's just very, very normal to see volume towards the beginning and the end of the day.
8198.48s:  There's nothing really remarkable about that. That's just standard market activity.
8204.40s:  That's why professional traders like myself, most of my transactions are done towards the end of the day.
8210.56s:  I don't trade a ton intraday. I'll trade zero DTEs and stuff like that. Intraday or during more
8218.48s:  non-normal portions of the day, but even as a professional retail trader, I'm still trading at a size
8224.64s:  that doesn't really matter. I don't need a ton of liquidity to do most of what I do.
8232.48s:  Vladimir says, funds rebalance on Friday. Yeah, well, it's rebalancing. It was also
8239.20s:  triple-witching, but the problem is with stuff like triple-witching, it happens so frequently now
8244.40s:  that it's really not that big a deal. People I think it still matters to a degree, but it's not
8249.68s:  as big of a deal as it used to be because triple-witching or what used to be quad-witching,
8254.96s:  which essentially has gone away and is consolidated into triple-witching now, is there's so many
8260.48s:  explorations now that it really is, I don't want to call it superfluous. It's not quite that
8265.04s:  insignificant, but it's nowhere near as significant as we used to hold it in regard with.
8271.44s:  So it's a little more mellow. So yeah, awesome. Super, super fun. I love getting into the
8279.12s:  trades for Roryn Kitty. The last thing I wanted to talk to you guys about actually is I don't know
8283.28s:  if you are familiar with the dude named Peruvian Bull. I think that's his name on Twitter, if I'm
8292.24s:  not mistaken. I think that's the name on Twitter. And so he and I, we're going to do a live session,
8300.16s:  I think probably next Thursday is the current game plan. So I don't know if there's anything
8306.88s:  in particular that you think we should cover or I should bring up with him, but the game plan is,
8313.52s:  I don't know him. So the game plan is just to bullshit with him a little bit, understand some
8318.40s:  of his background, and then to hopefully talk a little bit about just game stop from his perspective,
8325.60s:  what he's seen, and then kind of analyze what's going on in game stop together. But I think the
8331.84s:  game plan is to do that on a live stream. I think so. It might be a recorded podcast that goes out,
8339.28s:  I'm undecided yet, but yeah, we'll see, we'll see exactly how it gets structured, but the plan
8349.44s:  is to do that, like I said, next week. So if there's anything that you think would be good for us to
8354.96s:  talk about or cover, just let me know. And then I can add it to an agenda, because that's the hope
8360.32s:  is to start just exploring the whole thing from different angles. I'm going to have Dave Lauer back
8367.12s:  on my podcast. I do like a monthly podcast for urban finance with them, but I'll have Dave Lauer
8373.44s:  on my podcast. I think next week or the week after. So we'll talk a little bit about market
8379.68s:  structure, kind of some of the anomalies of something like game stop and stuff like that. So
8387.20s:  that is the game plan. As always, absolute blast hanging out. Let me know if there's anything
8391.76s:  that we should take a look at. Be an outlier or an ape or both. I'll see you all later.
