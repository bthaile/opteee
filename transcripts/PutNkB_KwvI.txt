0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
90.26s: Oh well
102.10s: What's up outliers, apes, ape outliers, and everything in between.
117.54s: What's going on, everybody?
119.18s: I hope the weekend is off to a stellar start.
122.90s: And we have a solid agenda for today.
128.20s: The first thing that we're going to spend time going through is the hopefully get a
134.20s: little bit deeper into our case old trades.
138.40s: I think we last left off.
139.60s: I'm looking at the sheet.
141.24s: We were in like 22 December of 2020.
144.60s: So we have a little bit ways to go, but I'm excited.
150.20s: It's definitely been taken a little bit longer than I was originally anticipating not that
153.68s: there's like a time hack that we have to stick to.
158.20s: The chat just completely disappeared.
160.20s: So, okay, I guess I am, there it is, like playing whack-a-mull.
166.44s: There we go.
169.16s: But we're getting a chance to go through kind of each position really, really far in detail.
177.32s: And to start us off, we have to start with any updates to our ape outlier sheet.
185.48s: So if you've already let me know where you're from, don't tell me again.
189.16s: But if I've not added you, let me know.
193.96s: And you can kind of check out the map and see what we might be missing.
197.48s: In the meantime, I got to say hello to everybody.
200.56s: So we got Samota.
201.88s: We got Lauren Lance, Derslup, roaring clitty, day swag, mock chicken.
208.52s: In case everybody's wondering, it's mock chicken.
211.80s: Pistol shrimp, that's a cool one.
215.16s: I think we have, I don't know if we have Toronto.
217.16s: We definitely have Ottawa.
218.76s: Let's see, do we have Toronto?
221.56s: Lido?
229.16s: We do not, now we do.
231.40s: We have Toronto.
234.12s: Beautiful.
236.28s: I think we have Atlanta.
238.76s: You have to be careful moving around Atlanta though.
241.32s: You don't need to get, you don't need to get shot.
244.52s: No, we don't have Atlanta now.
246.04s: We do.
247.80s: Kyoto, Japan.
249.48s: I don't know if we have Kyoto on here.
253.00s: We do not.
256.12s: I think we have one other from, I guess we don't.
258.44s: Now we have Japan on the map.
259.64s: That's great.
260.20s: That's a huge ad.
261.32s: Big win for the team.
263.80s: Salt Lake City.
266.20s: Let's see.
267.64s: That's one of the places that we were looking at moving.
270.28s: Originally was not Salt Lake City.
273.16s: We were looking at I think North Ogden like in the mountains here.
276.76s: And then we were looking south somewhere in like Provo I think.
280.44s: But yeah, we were originally potentially looking at moving there.
285.24s: Then we got five H trades from Williams, Arizona.
289.16s: It literally never heard of that.
292.76s: Where's that?
295.16s: Where is Williams?
296.92s: Oh, my God, no way.
299.48s: That's hilarious.
300.52s: So five H fun fact.
306.04s: My brother, he's an inflag staff.
308.28s: So I go out to flagstaff every once in a while to go see him.
312.12s: But we come, we go south, right?
314.52s: Because I'm in San Diego.
316.28s: Soon, normally we go out the eight and then up the 17.
321.40s: So yeah, that's hilarious.
322.76s: I just never been, yeah, Williams didn't
325.16s: click for whatever reason.
327.64s: But yeah, that's been out there a bunch.
331.48s: Then we got JD.
333.56s: Do we have Iowa?
334.76s: Let's see.
336.84s: Do we have Iowa?
338.04s: We do.
339.56s: Yeah, we have a couple.
340.84s: Well, we can do Iowa proper now and round it.
343.32s: We got them.
345.96s: Oh no, I don't think we did.
348.44s: Yeah, perfect.
350.20s: We're rounding this thing out.
352.20s: I think it would be so cool if we hit every US state.
358.28s: That would be fantastic.
360.12s: And then each continent.
362.28s: That's what we need.
364.28s: Jato says, Winnipeg, Canada,
367.32s: that Canadians start to make me a little nervous
371.08s: because in our discord, there's actually the guy that originally helped me set up the discord
378.28s: from the jump.
380.92s: He is from Canada.
382.28s: He's obviously incredibly, incredibly nice.
384.84s: This is way back when I first started the whole community.
387.40s: I was moving us over from a Facebook group.
389.88s: I don't really like Facebook.
391.56s: And he helped set the whole thing up for me.
394.84s: But one of my underlying ideas is that he's like slowly building a Canadian army
402.68s: because there are a massive number of Canadians that I'm noticing popping up around.
408.68s: So, and then we have Michael Solar from Mobile, Alabama.
413.64s: On fact, my, I call my stepfather,
418.76s: but really he's kind of like my mentor.
420.36s: He was the high school teacher.
421.40s: He's the one that actually got me into,
423.88s: well, he introduced me to investing.
426.84s: He has told me stories about his time down in Alabama.
431.24s: No rumour, Australia.
432.84s: I don't know where that is.
435.72s: North Southwest.
438.68s: Where is this?
443.24s: Where am I?
446.68s: Oh, this is way south.
450.20s: Okay, that makes sense.
452.04s: Yeah, I had never been over there.
454.20s: I've been to Canberra and then I did like the Gold Coast, which was sick.
459.80s: When I was in Australia with the Marine Corps, we were up in Darwin.
464.76s: And then there is a big movement down through the strait.
468.28s: All the way down through here down to Adelaide, which was Adelaide was sick,
471.72s: really, really liked Adelaide.
473.32s: And then I had some time to go over to the Gold Coast, which was sick.
479.00s: Allen Islands Finland.
481.08s: J-Pock, is that like, are you two pox cousin?
484.28s: Careful because they're still out there.
491.40s: That's hilarious.
492.60s: We were,
493.80s: we were looking at going here, but they looked really small.
500.28s: So we opted out of it for now at least, but maybe we'll land there.
505.32s: Cool.
505.64s: So we got a couple new updates on our map.
508.20s: I think we got the gang in here.
510.52s: So we'll kill this off.
512.28s: And then let's do a quick refresh on where we're at and what we're doing.
518.60s: So I need to grab the bottom of this.
523.64s: There we go.
525.88s: So what we've been doing is going through each of his trade updates and essentially tracking
533.40s: what the positions were.
535.24s: And then I started adding some qualitative notes around when he's managing
540.52s: the positions to close because I'm very, very interested in those personally.
545.64s: And the primary reason why I'm so interested in those is because I think they're going to be,
551.64s: I think we're going to see some common threads that we will start to learn from in terms of how
558.52s: he's thinking about options because I've said this before.
562.04s: I think right now when I look at his options positions, I genuinely see them as just
569.16s: leveraged long exposure.
571.72s: They're not seemingly predicated on a certain amount of time in the trade yet.
579.08s: But my guess is that's what we're going to find is that they're going to be predicated by time,
584.28s: not by some sort of price target.
586.68s: So I told Newton that if you wanted to chattel a little bit during this one, he had a busy
593.80s: week. So he can't, but I told him I would shoot him a text with where we left off.
597.80s: So I'm going to let him know that we're picking up from 22D's 2020.
605.72s: And that will follow up, we'll follow up with where we land on our K trades.
616.52s: So kind of a placeholder for me.
619.16s: But let's take a look.
622.92s: All right, so now we have to do this thing that I do every time because I don't know how to do this
626.76s: still. And this is not any of your fault, actually, this is my own fault because I accidentally
634.76s: forgot how to like automatically scroll to the bottom, which is kind of annoying.
639.96s: So I have to like do this. Somebody told me how to do this before.
644.92s: But I don't remember. There was like a hot key.
648.68s: Anybody here know the hot key? Otherwise, I'm just going to start scrolling.
652.20s: But I wonder if I can be enlightened before I start the scrolling process.
657.40s: And then I have two versions of this open on purpose.
663.16s: And the reason I'm using two versions is because I would like to make sure that
670.28s: we can look at near term stuff and then stuff that's from obviously
676.52s: all the way down at the bottom. All right, so everybody's leaving me out here
681.16s: hanging to dry. So I'm going to just start scrolling. Here we go.
686.52s: So it's not like the page down thing because that only gets you to the bottom of this.
690.76s: It doesn't get us all the way to the very bottom.
696.84s: Which actually I realized we don't even have to do that. I'm an idiot. My bad. We literally
699.88s: can start further up. Sometimes you guys got to keep an eye on me. Like sometimes I just do
704.60s: really, really stupid shit. That Lauren says, sorry, you said it last week, but I forget to.
709.72s: Damn it. Lauren, we were really leaning on you here because obviously I can't be trusted.
715.64s: So I'm going to blame you now that now that you admitted that you at least were rudimentarily
722.76s: familiar with it, I'm going to say that I expected you to keep us on track. And then
730.04s: I think, yeah, as long as I can have a scapegoat.
735.16s: Lance says we didn't leave off at the bottom there, but yeah, exactly. No, the only reason why I
741.16s: like going down to the bottom is because there's good references, I think. And we're going to end
745.08s: up referencing it again. I'm sure. But anyways, let's get to where we need to be, which is somewhere
750.84s: right up here. Yeah. So I think we got through December. What a fucking hilarious.
757.56s: Yeah. Okay. So here's where we're at. Let me grab my little handy dandy workbook. And I think last
761.96s: time I put this over here that worked well. And then I can squish this. I think so that you can
768.60s: see most of it. You won't be able to see my notes. I don't think, but I'll track them obviously.
773.96s: And we left at 22 December. Okay. So. And then the other thing I need to do is get into
783.80s: on demand because we were tracking his individual trades in here. And then I'm going to go back
790.60s: to the correct time. So we need to go to 2020. Is it 21? Wait, no, 2020. That's why. Okay, so we don't
800.52s: have the positions yet. That's annoying. Oh, there we go. Okay, cool. So we need to go to December
809.00s: of 2020. We'll go to the 22nd. We'll look at the days it sits. And I saved all of his old
814.20s: positions. I think if not, I can reconstitute them really quick. I might have reset the account
819.00s: at one point. It's not a big deal. No, we still have them all.
824.12s: So then we'll use this as a quick fact check. I'm going to turn these ones off. I think these
834.68s: were from an example that I was giving. So let's mirror these really fast with exactly what he had.
842.76s: So we need this. And then I'm going to pull this over here just for a moment. Let's go into 22
848.60s: December. And then let's mirror this account. So we're long 10,000. We have that. Oops.
856.68s: 10,000 at 4133. We have that good. Next we need 15 Jan the tens in the 20s. 15 Jan's the tens
870.28s: in the 20s. So I'm going to get rid of these other ones. I'm just going to get rid of all this stuff.
883.96s: We'll add that. So now I need to go to 15 Jan, which is now 24 DTE. I remember this being very
891.16s: interesting to me. And then the way that he unwound those other options was very interesting to me.
896.60s: And then his paid price was .0726. And he has a thousand I believe. Yep. A thousand.
905.64s: And then he has .0726. So we'll analyze that. You got those other ones for 20. And then we have one
916.20s: other trade 16 April the 21 16 April 12. So now we go to 16 April again super far out in time.
929.88s: And he I'm sure it has a thousand of these. And then he's at 40 cents on these. You're a point
941.88s: for. Okay. So now we have his whole position. We'll be able to see it day by day. We have our little
951.72s: tracker ready to go so that we can monitor any incremental changes. So we are ready to rumble.
963.16s: Let's take a look now at 23 D's. So now this is 23 D's. And just so you know, I'm being lazy.
972.52s: These are all showing is 2024. I obviously know that these are all 2021. So I'll kind of color them
979.16s: in just so that we're all on the same page. And we were confident together. But I just don't want
984.92s: to have to keep typing more than I need to. So that's that's why that's set up as it is just so that
989.24s: you're aware that I'm aware also quick drug take. I got my my doctor's appointment set up for next
1000.68s: Thursday. Your boys getting an epidural of steroids to help with the whole disc thing. So maybe
1007.96s: just maybe I won't have to main line drugs in order to at least be able to sit. Okay.
1014.92s: 23 December. We're off to the races. So we have no change in any of the positions. But let's take
1023.24s: a look at our TG. So we're at 24 83 257.
1033.08s: 23.
1039.88s: Cash in the account is 1116796.64.
1051.72s: And total value is 3709 3709 996.64.
1058.92s: Okay. Same same. And here. So he's still holding the tens and 20s. And now one day is past, which
1069.00s: why is that? Why did he bother posting here?
1080.12s: So let's take a look at the gaps between these just out of curiosity.
1089.08s: If we look at I'm actually because I'm very specific with the way that I like to input data,
1097.32s: I really don't like like skipping things. So I'm going to put the post date here and then I'll
1105.08s: put the gap here. But what I don't understand is why why this like why why here?
1119.08s: Yeah, because I noticed that right out of the gate is when I look at his posting frequency,
1128.20s: a couple things jump out at me. And one of the things that I noticed is like he went
1136.52s: not posting a lot. Then he was going about a week in between his updates, which makes a ton of
1141.32s: sense, right? Like posting a weekly update. That's like a very normal cadence. But then I notice this.
1147.32s: It starts getting like really recent. And I don't know why. If any of you do tell me why please
1154.44s: so that I can wonder no more. But right now I am wondering a lot because I don't actually get this.
1165.16s: And then this I'm just going to pull down a little bit further because we're going to keep going
1169.48s: here. Dark Gents says I think we get one more downturn before GME Moons,
1177.08s: D.F.V. like unlikely in yet. Yeah, we'll definitely take time to bounce between different theories.
1183.40s: You know, I love looking at some of those theories. So I am 100% down to take a look because the other
1189.00s: thing that I got from the discord is somebody was asking about the dark pool orders that we recently
1195.80s: got, which I think is worth taking a look at. That Lauren says was it in December 2021 that he posted
1202.44s: a lot. Yeah. So what I noticed in December is that the frequency between posts went up a lot or
1208.28s: like the latency between post went down frequency of post went up. So right now, like I'm typically
1214.12s: seeing them do like once a month or once a week. Sorry for, you know, October, November,
1220.12s: right? That's like a very steady cadence. It's about once a week. But then in December, I can
1224.92s: already see that like he went from the eighth to ninth, the 22 23. So I, and then there's a 25th.
1236.92s: So I haven't like I don't understand why the uptick and frequency here.
1243.96s: And then I'm actually going to shrink this one down a little bit. Let me know if that becomes
1248.92s: not visible for you, but it just makes it a little easier for me to move. So the total gain
1253.40s: and I got to move this mic a little bit so I can see my keyboard. Also shout out to the 75
1259.00s: apes that are in here hanging out, whether you're an ape outlier outlier ape, all are welcome
1265.00s: because as we all know, this story in and of itself is about as interesting as it gets. So let's
1271.08s: take a look at this total gain. So 2393 5557.63. Total cash in the account looks generally unchanged.
1281.48s: 11116 831.85. And then value is 3620331.85. Did I mess something up? That looks correct.
1299.96s: 3620331.85. That looks correct.
1309.08s: 2393. Yep, I messed up. 2393.55763.
1320.04s: 2393 555763. That's correct.
1330.60s: Interesting. So I'm detecting a variance here. And I'm trying to
1342.84s: positions haven't moved.
1355.00s: So what happened here?
1360.28s: So what happened here?
1364.20s: Wait, this looks. Is it just off by like, this looks what is this doing?
1380.28s: 89664. This matches. I don't know why this is showing is.
1386.60s: It doesn't match. It does match. This and this are the same.
1397.80s: Is it a intel if there's like a formatting issue here?
1402.84s: I'm just going to highlight this is green because this is this looks correct.
1406.52s: Yeah, let me. I'm going to highlight this one is green because this is this is good.
1419.16s: So there's no there's no problem. I think this one had the same issue with like a rounding
1425.08s: discrepancies. So I'm going to flag this is green.
1427.48s: Okay. And then here we're still holding these. And now we have
1438.76s: 25 Ds. And now we have 21 DTE that we still hold those options.
1451.64s: Interesting so far. And then this one is also good. I just realized that's
1455.80s: incorrectly flagged. Okay.
1462.76s: All right. So now let's take a look. Yeah, 31 Ds. So this to me looks like he's just enjoying
1470.60s: posting more. That's what I see here. Like it's got to be something to do with the account.
1477.08s: Like take a look at the account. Well, he already saw a $2 million. So this isn't anything
1482.52s: about novel. This isn't novel about being above $2 million. He was already there.
1489.40s: So it's not like he's like, oh yeah, you know, I you guys have been calling me fucking crazy.
1495.16s: And I'm right. So that's interesting. So total gain here is negative 107200.
1506.60s: That's fucking crazy. That is fucking crazy.
1524.84s: Wow.
1528.68s: One man, I'm still like absorbing this. We have to take a look on the chart here because this is
1534.28s: this is fucking crazy. 31 83 460 99
1552.20s: I've moved the wrong column here. 1953 457. That's 63. There we go.
1564.36s: This makes way more sense. I was just being stupid. I was reading this is the total gain,
1568.44s: not the day gain. Him losing $100,000 in a day is kind of whatever.
1575.16s: Ron Clity says, I mean, one million gain in a day still feels good even if you're ready to
1578.76s: be in there. Yeah, no, I agree with that. I totally agree. I think my point is is like for the lay
1584.44s: person, like a normal human being, I would expect them to, you know, if they're doing really,
1589.88s: you can look at this on Reddit, right? Like if you go to any sub Reddit, you can take a look at
1596.04s: like very, very clear lines. If people are doing well, and there's actually literally studies about
1602.44s: this that are really fun to look at, but if people are doing really well, they post a lot more
1608.28s: frequently. And then if the market's not looking really good, I'm adjusting my chair because my
1615.24s: stuff's all fucked up. There it goes. And if things are not going well, people tend to post
1623.32s: way less. So, but he doesn't, like I can tell he doesn't subscribe to that, right? Like I don't
1629.16s: think he's starting to post more here because he's making some money. Like I just don't see that.
1635.16s: That doesn't seem to be his M.O. But what does seem to be interesting is that he's still holding
1640.20s: these positions that now at 31D's 21. What did I mess up? 31 December 21.
1657.88s: Oh, I see. That's my bad. 15 Jan 22.
1664.36s: So, now he has 15 DTE.
1674.60s: Vladimir says, Eric, with all due respect, there was a lot being added to the story that a spreadsheet
1678.84s: based on numbers alone will not capture. Yeah. I'm confused. What's your point?
1687.88s: Because I'm not in no way what I'm doing now, am I suggesting that this is like the Game Stop
1695.96s: story or Newton story? Newton, I don't know why I say Newton's on the brain. Sorry. Or
1703.72s: roaring Kitty story. Yeah, I've not suggested that, Mr. Off-Pooten. The point of this part of the
1710.76s: series is very specifically to analyze his trades. That's the point. The reason why I look at this
1722.20s: is because I think we can get way more information on his behaviors, habits, what he sees.
1731.80s: And most importantly, I have not, I don't know anybody that I've heard talk about his previous
1739.08s: trades that I personally would take at face value personally. And that's not that I mistrust
1745.16s: people because I think that they're trying to lie or mislead me. I think it's that people themselves
1752.12s: tend to not understand how biased their recollection and analysis of things are.
1761.32s: So, the whole point of this is for me to see for myself and as I'm seeing for myself
1768.28s: to show you again what I'm seeing right now specifically from the trade perspective.
1776.04s: Now, in terms of like going to the rest of the story and stuff, like I said, I love doing that.
1780.84s: And I fully intend to, right? Like we've done 11 episodes of this now. And this is only the
1786.12s: third one that we're like focused on the trades because I haven't done it yet. So yeah, I completely
1792.84s: agree. And now off Putin to your point, if there are offshoots that you think we should take a break
1800.92s: and go look at while we're doing this because it's temporally related, like the Edgar story or
1805.08s: something, let me know, right? Because that's the point. You guys as a community will know more
1810.12s: about this collectively than I ever will. And that's just how it is. So I fully lean and want to blend
1819.08s: both of our collective intellect. So in this case, yeah, if there's something that you think we
1826.44s: should jump over to that helps elucidate where we're at in the timeline, I'm happy to.
1831.24s: But yeah, right now my entire goal is to understand exactly what he's doing, what his habits are,
1838.60s: what the trades look like. And again, the whole point of this whole thing is not to try to replicate
1846.92s: what he's doing. Because again, that's not how I trade. I literally don't care to do that.
1851.24s: It's because I've been in trading for so long and I am literally staring at a fucking anomaly.
1860.04s: And I can see it. I can watch the anomaly doing anomalous things, which is absolutely insane.
1868.68s: So yeah, I am eager to figure out where this all goes, but step by step. Because right now, again,
1878.20s: I've already identified some really, really clear trends and themes that I can clearly identify.
1887.40s: So when I look at this again, like first, I can tell that he takes massively leveraged positions.
1893.48s: Two, I can also tell that he takes massive amounts of concentrated risk that he leaves on.
1900.52s: Three, I can tell you that he doesn't use stops of any sort. Four, I can tell you that in terms of
1906.20s: portfolio volatility, he is entirely null to it. Five, I can tell you that he doesn't manage his
1914.20s: option trades based on any sort of perceived profit or loss target. So there's a lot of like very
1921.40s: specific things that I can pick up from his habits from this exact process. So let's take a look.
1933.80s: Sam, Sam Clements says, why would we not want to trade like the guy who made a billion?
1937.64s: It's a great question. The reason why is because if as a trader, your model of trading is an attempt
1944.60s: to copy somebody else, I literally have never seen it done successfully. And the reason being is
1950.92s: because in order to like fully copy somebody else, you have to either have to know what they're
1960.68s: doing before they're doing it to do it with them. Or you have to adopt their entire brain,
1967.40s: literally, because again, we'll see and because we know as we go further into the future,
1973.00s: we'll see periods. I mean, let's look at an example together.
1977.56s: And I'll ask you this.
1980.92s: So if we take a look at this.
1997.08s: And let me make it so that the quality is at least decent. So here's a dude.
2005.96s: I'm going to zoom in and see you can see here's a dude that in an individual day,
2013.96s: his trading account right now was at $350 million. He was down $235 million in a day,
2022.36s: genuinely, genuinely. If you were thinking about being this guy, is this what you would do?
2030.92s: The only person that would say yes is the kind of person that says yes with the benefit of hindsight,
2042.60s: knowing what may or may not happen. And really the benefit of hindsight is terrible,
2046.28s: right? Because this went even lower from here. So the whole point is that his disposition,
2054.92s: his mentality towards trading is so anomalous. It is literally contrary to human genetic
2066.12s: processing. It's completely different. And I'm not saying that it's unique to only him. It's not.
2072.52s: There are other people out there that have some of these similar tendencies. But what I'm
2078.44s: saying is that they are so few and far between that for most of us, for example, me,
2086.12s: if I had this position and I was trying to trade this position or whatever,
2094.04s: there's no way that I wouldn't have a stop on these options. Why is that? Why would I worry
2102.60s: about having a stop on the options? Because I know that these options will continue to decay.
2111.08s: I know that. So I would rather capture the profit as it starts to realize,
2119.48s: then let it turn into a loss. That's like a relatively normal trader's mindset. His mindset is
2126.68s: obviously completely different, which is why it's so freaking cool. But it's also why the idea of
2135.72s: trying to essentially adopt what he does and do it yourself would fail miserably,
2143.32s: unless you have the ability to completely adopt his psychology, which again, reiterate the point,
2150.52s: is a pure anomaly. It's a pure anomaly because again, the other thing I can tell you is that this
2156.92s: dude doesn't really care that much about money. Obviously, he probably cares about money to a degree.
2162.76s: I know that he has a family and he wants to take care of his family and stuff like that. I know all
2166.60s: of that. But he could have never opened up another trade. And he could have lived the rest of his life
2175.80s: with more money than he could ever need, but he chose not to. So it tells me something else
2181.56s: about what motivates him and why he does this. So all of this is to go back to Sam's question on,
2187.32s: why would we not want to trade like a guy who made a billion is because in order to trade like him,
2192.28s: you have to adopt his entire world view, his entire paradigm. And I do not think the overwhelming
2199.96s: majority of people can do that because it is so unique. It is so anomalous. That's why.
2208.76s: Cedric says maybe he sees something that gives him insane win rate if certain conditions are right,
2213.88s: potentially. But I can also tell you again, by looking at the data that it's not it's not true,
2219.40s: right? Because there's obviously is a fantastic trader, but he's not great at timing things so far.
2228.28s: So what it tells me is that he's good at taking repeated risks, highly concentrated,
2234.76s: and then letting the numbers kind of work out, which again, there is a portion of this that is
2240.20s: like a coin flip. There is a certain amount of luck that's tied to this because one of the things
2246.44s: that I look at is this here, right? Like he was already over $2.2 million. And then he contracts
2253.24s: down eight days later in his total gain to 932. So he cut his value of his portfolio in half,
2262.84s: in eight days. If there happened to be a bad path for GameStop again for one of any innumerable
2271.96s: reasons, then this account can literally be zeroed out because of bad path. So in this case,
2280.04s: I think that again, brilliant, brilliant thesis, brilliant conviction, really good use of leverage,
2289.56s: right? Like I can identify lots of really good things that happened here. But I continue to
2293.96s: remind people that there is a healthy dose of luck that's included with this, which again is
2299.96s: also important to remind people because when we look at somebody like Sam who asks a really normal
2305.48s: question of why wouldn't we want to try to do this, well, it's because of all of these different
2310.60s: reasons because it's not just skill that led to this. Again, skill, massive factor, luck,
2319.80s: also massive factor. So that's why I'm so eager to see how the rest of this goes because we're
2326.60s: getting a chance, we're getting a glimpse inside of what this all looks like
2331.48s: from a trading perspective, which I'm like really, really excited for.
2345.80s: I'm going to just replace really quick. I want to find 2024 and I want to replace it with 2021.
2362.28s: No, I don't want that. I want, I don't want to use a formula.
2371.40s: Why is there no 2024 in here? There is 2024. Don't lie to me.
2375.88s: Oh, so it considers it a formula. Okay.
2398.76s: Good to know. Okay. So now let's continue.
2406.12s: And so we just did 31Ds. Now we are in 5GN.
2413.48s: 22. Okay. So we see a change. We can immediately see that he offloaded the tens,
2427.88s: which again is not what I would have expected. That's not what I would have expected at all.
2432.92s: 8, that's crazy. 881474.03.
2443.32s: And the nuts.
2444.52s: Passionale is 1128502.42.
2452.12s: Value is 2803002.42.
2462.04s: Confirm that these are correct. 88147403.
2465.48s: 1128502.42.
2469.64s: 2803002.
2473.32s: Okay.
2475.80s: So the first thing I notice is that he's missing a lot of money.
2483.88s: There's a big variance between what should be in the portfolio right now and what is.
2495.64s: So I find that.
2499.88s: I find that very interesting.
2507.56s: Because his cash is sitting at essentially up 8 grand.
2513.16s: The total gain down a mill.
2517.32s: Obviously because one of his positions came down, but it's not captured in the cash.
2525.88s: So this here looks like he took some money out of the account.
2535.96s: Offputin says you missed that he just added 40 KGME shares. Yeah, I haven't even gotten into the
2542.12s: updated positions. Offputin, I feel like this process confuses you because you did the same
2546.36s: thing last time. Every single change that is going to happen in the account is going to be
2553.00s: captured in these metrics. I don't have to look at the individual positions to note changes
2560.12s: because regardless of where they go, I can still see them. So because to your point,
2567.96s: when I'm looking at the change in individual positions that's going to be captured in total gain
2573.80s: cash relative to value. So I'm going to see all of that. Now to your point, I am going to go
2578.84s: through and update all of his trades because I can also see that he unwound an options trade.
2583.56s: But what I'm highlighting more specifically is that money moved. That's the point here.
2591.64s: Is that a decent amount of money came out of this.
2598.76s: So if I add another column to maybe help with this point,
2601.88s: if we take a look at the overall value compared to what's in there. So in this case,
2617.56s: there's a $600,000 value variance here.
2622.36s: Putin says from the previous statement to the one you're looking at, he went from 10 to 50K.
2632.20s: Yeah, I know, dude. I know. I'm aware. I'm following you, bro. He also
2635.88s: offloaded a thousand options. I am right there with you. Again, the point that I'm trying to
2645.24s: make no mistakes as the spreadsheet is flawed, the stock price dropped. The account value dropped
2650.20s: 380K, which makes sense. It's not. So the reason why this isn't relative to the stock price,
2660.28s: it doesn't matter what the stock price is. It doesn't change the variance that I see,
2668.04s: because the stock price moved here as well. And it didn't, these matched perfectly.
2677.80s: The stock price also changed over the course of this month.
2683.24s: And again, they matched perfectly. Rapture says lots of people must understand what you're looking at.
2689.16s: Yeah, I'm definitely noticing that. And that's okay. But what, yeah, what, I don't know,
2697.80s: I honestly don't know how it's to describe like what I'm looking at.
2700.60s: I'm essentially trying to detect money variances within the account. And then in doing so simultaneously,
2709.16s: I'm looking at when he's managing positions and how. So like, for example, on this 5JAN
2715.08s: expiration, I can clearly see that he managed some of these calls, which we're going to talk about.
2722.52s: But I need to update this really quick. This needs to be 5JAN,
2728.28s: 22. So with 10 DTE, because I think that this matters. I don't know how it matters yet,
2735.08s: but I think it does. So here he exited as well. We'll flag that and we'll flag that. And then here,
2744.52s: oh no, he didn't exit here. I'm about, he exited here.
2752.28s: So he, no, I was right. So here, he exited
2761.32s: the, the tens, which I just would not expect that 15JAN 21 tens.
2771.96s: Just don't get.
2773.08s: We have some, we have some homework to do. Gang, I need to figure this out.
2790.20s: Why, why did he do this? Okay, so now let's update his position.
2795.96s: He had them for 20. And he exited somewhere between 31 DEES and 5JAN. That shouldn't be too
2806.60s: difficult to detect. So if we think about 20, what year are we in now? 22. And we look at 31 DEES,
2817.16s: which is Monday. And then 5JAN is that Saturday. The market would have been closed. I think
2825.72s: the first. So he would have exited either the second third or the fourth.
2832.52s: So what's bizarre about this is let's go here. And then let's go to like the end of DEES of 21.
2847.56s: Something like this.
2859.32s: So there is a lot here that's. Oops messed up my bet.
2870.04s: I have to get the right options. We have to go to 2020. That's my bet.
2877.80s: DEES 2020, the 31st. Because these will still trade.
2886.84s: So now let's take a look at what charting we're reusing. We had a good charting tool that
2897.40s: let us go back in time. Was Yahoo Finance? When I say good, I think that's relative because it
2901.88s: seems to be annoying every time we look at it. But I think Yahoo Finance is what we've been using.
2907.32s: For GameStop. And then let's take a look. We want the full chart.
2920.68s: And then we need to go back further.
2924.68s: Let's go to.
2937.56s: I don't want months. I want daily candles. And then let's go back to December 2020.
2955.48s: So this is where we're at.
2961.00s: Okay. So.
2971.56s: What happened here?
2972.76s: The fifth of Jan.
2981.24s: So he would have gotten out.
2986.20s: Somewhere in here. So the 31st he posted.
2991.80s: And then the next trading day was the 4th of Jan. So he would have gotten out, not here.
2997.80s: But he would have gotten out on the 4th.
3003.16s: Because the 4th or the 5th. I don't think it really matters that much.
3010.04s: But it would have been the 4th or the 5th. This is.
3017.16s: January 21 right now.
3019.24s: Cedric says we were looking at 22. No, we're looking at 21. So the positions that were kind of
3026.20s: catching up on right now are these 15 Jan 21s, the 20s and the 12s in 16 April. But he obviously
3033.96s: got out of the 10s. Now the thing that is just so strange. Uh, Rhino asks Eric, what's off about
3042.76s: selling the 10s? It's a great question. So what I find so weird about taking the 10s down
3049.64s: is when we look at the the movement of GameStop. And again, if we go to, so it wasn't the 31st that he
3058.76s: did it, we know that for sure. It would have been like January, what the 5th we said.
3066.60s: Whereas that one as the update was 5 Jan. So it would have been 4 Jan.
3072.68s: So the thing that's so interesting about this is.
3079.24s: The thing that's so interesting about this is that when I look at the options that he had,
3086.20s: the 10s would have been in a better position to hold than the 20s. But by holding the 20s,
3096.76s: like I, I, I, I, I, I, I don't know why he would do that. Okay. So let me explain. I know I'm not
3105.40s: explaining. I'm still it is because I'm like, I'm trying to process at the same time. And by doing
3110.60s: that, I'm explaining nothing. So I apologize. So let's, let's look at an example. This will probably
3116.04s: make it a little more clear to you. So when I take a look at his position here. And let's go back
3124.44s: one to 31 Ds. Okay. So we're looking at two different sets of options. We're looking at 1000 in both.
3134.60s: Okay. So you don't have to know anything else other than these 10s will have, well, let me ask you.
3144.28s: What will the delta of these 10 calls be compared to these 20 calls here? Why? Why is this?
3157.32s: Where I know says, is there more premium in the tens and you probably wanted more contracts that
3164.60s: will go in the money eventually, potentially, we'll, we'll be able to sift that out. But it's a great
3169.32s: point right now. Roy and Clity says 10 delta way higher. Dr. Zayas 10 delta will be higher exactly.
3175.08s: Okay. Great. So now if you had this position on and let's, let's think about another really
3186.04s: important point. So the day that he's posting this 31 Ds and then 5 Jan. So now his options expire 15
3198.52s: Jan. Which of these options is going to have more Thaited a K the tens or the 20s right now in this
3210.60s: last update game stop was at 18 E four. If we go to this point, it's at 17. Which one of these
3217.08s: options is going to have more Thaited a K? The 20s blonde, swazy is correct the 20s.
3228.36s: So then why? Why would we keep the 20s on and not the tens?
3241.16s: There's essentially one scenario I can think of. Which is confounding to me.
3264.92s: Raptor says he's hunting for gamma exposure technically he was still bullish.
3268.76s: The gamma exposure doesn't matter right. So raptors walk me through that thought process. Why would he care
3276.52s: about gamma in this case? If he has, let's go back to this scenario where he has the tens and the 20s.
3284.76s: Why what does gamma have to do with this in your mind?
3291.96s: Roy and Clity says if you're very sure the stock is going to push significantly past the 20
3295.96s: strike they would compound a lot harder than the tens. They would compound harder. But which one
3300.92s: would you actually make more money in? Roy and Clity is wrong. Roy and Clity's on a very good and
3308.84s: fair thought process I understand it but it's wrong. There's nothing to do with that. Because
3316.92s: in this case what I make more money with the tens or the 20s, I have the same size in both.
3322.20s: I have 1000 of both. We just said that the tens are higher delta's.
3331.48s: Cedric says the 20s that's incorrect. The 20s would not make more money.
3336.68s: Cedric says big money have bullish. Again, that's incorrect.
3341.24s: The tens pay more. This is a really really really important point. So let's let's look at this
3349.72s: together really quick. We'll look in GameStop and we'll just use today for an example. It doesn't
3355.88s: really matter. Let's take a look. We can look at options that are going to come up in like what
3364.12s: is this? Like 10 days. We'll use the four ox or whatever. It doesn't matter. The example will be
3368.28s: the same. Now let's take a look at Make No Mistake says if price drops the 10 would lose
3379.80s: quicker because they have a higher delta. That's correct. Yep. So the tens would lose more money.
3386.44s: But again, I can already tell you that he doesn't he doesn't care about the losing money part.
3392.52s: We've already seen him go through this. So I don't think that's it either.
3397.48s: Deswag says it's a guest lock in a known profit and keep the other for a yellow one big volatility.
3401.96s: Both of them are showing a profit still. So I don't think that's it either.
3406.84s: Ryan O'Sense he's betting on the squeeze. So he's doubling down since you're ready as 50
3410.44s: X is port. He's going for higher risk by losing the tens and going way out of the money. He already
3415.08s: has this position though. So it's not that either. Right. So he's maintained this position for a long
3423.40s: time. He established this back in like 25 November of even before that actually. So he's had this
3433.16s: position for a long time. Now to drive this other point home hopefully to its entirety.
3443.56s: I want to show you something. So if we take something again, I'm just going to use the same
3448.84s: scenario. GameStop was trading at 1884. So he had options that were $8 in the money. So essentially,
3457.80s: we can do the same thing in this case. We can just pick options that are $8 in the money.
3464.60s: So we can go to like these 13s. We could pretend that we bought these for whatever price. Let's
3473.08s: just say that we got them for 20 cents or the example and we have a thousand of them.
3479.96s: This simulates his tens that are $8 in the money. I'm going to turn the other ones off for now so
3486.84s: we can just look at this example together. Then with GameStop at 1884, he also had options that
3495.72s: were $1.20 higher. So that would take us to like these 23s. And again, he had a thousand of those.
3505.64s: And then he would have got those again in this case for like seven cents. Not slash decimal.
3511.40s: Zero seven. First, let me take a pause. Does what I'm doing right now make sense? Do you understand
3522.44s: why I'm picking these options to show you? What I'm doing is I'm creating a current date example
3534.92s: of what his position would look like. And what I'm going to show you is how these two different
3542.12s: positions behave based on similar size moves because Reese says none of this makes sense, but yes,
3551.08s: I'm following. That's that sounds about right. Because I mean, this is all crazy. So what I'm
3558.44s: showing you though jokes aside is I'm showing you what these tens and these 20s would have looked
3565.96s: like for him. And I just want to show you the PNL difference because that's a big right? That's
3573.64s: a big part of making decisions as a trader is understanding the movement of a position. So let's
3578.92s: take a look at it. These tens were in the money. The 20s that he had were slightly out of the money.
3584.76s: So we're using the 13s which serve as the tens, the 23s which serve as the 20s. So if I take a
3592.44s: look at the 23s, which again look like the 20s, and we take a look at a 15% up move. The underlying
3601.32s: goes up by 15%. And again, I'm using the same entry price that he would have gotten into. So
3607.56s: it's literally as close to an apples to apples comparison as you can come up with options that are
3612.76s: obviously offset by time. Apples, apples, otherwise. So now when I look at this, I see seven cents.
3621.72s: And if he got a 15% up move in this case, he would have made $283,000. If he would have had a 15%
3631.72s: down move, he would have still made $12,000 because there's so far in the money. That again is looking
3638.92s: at the 23s, which serve as the 20s. Let's take a look at the 13s. With the 13s, if he gets a 15%
3647.24s: move in his favor, he makes $1.186 million. That serves as the tens. That's in comparison to 283,000.
3659.40s: He would make 1.186. If the underlying goes down 15%, he would still make $567,556.
3673.48s: So even if it goes down 15%, he still would make way more with these options than these other options.
3683.08s: The other thing to add on top of this is the difference in X-Trensic value.
3689.56s: These options, let's do the math. The 23s, the 23s are trading for, let's call it a dollar five.
3703.40s: They're decaying at $6 a day. So $6 divided by 105 as a percentage is 5.7%.
3719.24s: Again, in a surrogate sense, these 20s are decaying away daily at a rate of 5.7% of the options value.
3734.04s: If we go to the 13s, these are trading for, let's call it $8.90,
3739.80s: beta on these is $3 divided by $8.90 times 100. These are decaying at 0.34%.
3758.60s: These options are decaying light years slower than these. On a daily basis as a gross dollar amount,
3769.08s: we can do that as well. Let's take a look. He has 1,000 contracts.
3774.12s: And I'm walking you through the mess so you can do it yourself. He has 1,000 contracts times
3778.60s: 6 cents, times 100. He's losing $6,000 a day on this position here.
3788.04s: If we take a look at this, he has 1,000 contracts at 3 cents. He's losing $3,000 per day.
3796.12s: So even in a raw, faded, decay perspective, he does way better holding the in the
3802.52s: monies, offloading the out of the monies. Make no mistake. Says, what are we trying to prove here?
3808.60s: Are cave made the wrong decision? No, no, no, no, I'm not saying he made the wrong decision at all.
3813.00s: What I'm saying is he made a non-optimized decision, which to me means there's a reason why
3822.84s: the decision was made. I have no fucking clue what it is. But I'm trying to understand
3829.80s: the thought process behind it because as I look at the decision across every single threshold
3835.80s: of managing an options trade, it's suboptimal across the board. Each individual thing. But again,
3842.52s: as I said in the beginning, there are like two things that I can think of that somebody would do
3848.04s: this for. The first reason is because he wanted more dollars. So as we already identified,
3858.20s: he went from 10,000 shares and he expanded to 50,000 shares at 14897. The problem here is,
3871.24s: let's take a look at what that would cost. We can do some quick math. So we know if 50,000 shares,
3878.04s: and his basis is 14, 88947. So his cost here equals this times this. So total cost here is $744,735.
3900.84s: Before he had 10,000 shares, and his basis was 41133.
3918.60s: Same thing.
3919.24s: So now equals this minus this.
3935.88s: So he needed blood swasey says, my guess he could buy more shares with the premium from the
3943.08s: 10 at the fourth. Unfortunately, it's not true. He already had what he needed. So if you take a look,
3951.08s: can you guys see the far right hand side over here? Kind of like where some of this scratch stuff is?
3956.36s: If not, let me know. But that's that this is where the answer is, which is telling me that he didn't
3963.24s: need it. Because what happened here is he went from 10,000, which was a total basis of 41K to 50,000,
3977.56s: which is a total basis of 744.
3980.44s: The delta between these, the variance is $703,602. So that's what he needed. He needed $703,602 in order to put on this new position.
3998.28s: Take a look at his cash. What do you notice?
4000.76s: Something very important.
4008.92s: Do you see what I see?
4020.20s: Rhino says no cursing. There's children watching. Thank you for the heads up. Happy to call the
4024.84s: cursing. You got it. Had cash plenty. 5H is exactly correct. 5H is 100% correct.
4037.88s: He already had enough money. So he didn't need to sell those options. It wasn't for cash,
4046.92s: which for me, that would have been the primary reason. Rhino says, I'm talking about me. Oh,
4054.36s: Rhino, how old are you? If you're on here looking at this stuff, then cursing is probably on the board.
4060.92s: And I got to be honest with you. I normally curse, but I can easily turn it off if there's a good reason.
4069.24s: Rhino says 32. Yeah, then you're fucking fine, homie.
4073.72s: Unbelievable that you're going to cause me to audit and filter myself. And there's no fucking reason to
4080.84s: unbelievable. So now, because that takes a lot of brain capacity for your boy, that's like it can
4087.88s: be done, but I have to like really think about it. All right. So all of this stuff aside,
4095.08s: what do we know now? There's a couple things that we know with certainty. He did not need to sell
4101.48s: either of these. He had the money to buy the shares that he wanted. He also across the board unwound
4107.96s: a completely suboptimal position. And I don't know why I do not know why. And the reason why
4117.24s: is because across the board, it would have made so much more sense to take the 20s down.
4124.20s: And then to leave the tens, he would have made more money in total either direction.
4130.76s: And they decay way, way, way less quickly. So this is a question mark. This is one of those things
4140.28s: that I kind of earmark as something weird happened. And I don't know what.
4147.24s: Rhino says, is it possible that he sold some but exercise 400 of them to get the 50K? It wouldn't
4152.12s: make any sense to do that. No, he could have, but it would have made no sense. I know that people
4159.32s: are really interested in the exercise scenarios and it's fair. Let's talk about it.
4163.72s: So let's see, these were trading for $8.90. So what's our extrinsic value? These are,
4171.64s: let's go, we can use the same thing that we're looking at now. It's all the same. So 21, 85,
4179.08s: minus 13 is 885. So in this scenario, he had 885
4189.48s: intrinsic value. And what I'm doing right now is I'm just showing you an example of something.
4194.12s: This is obviously looking at the front expiration, meaning today, but it doesn't matter. The
4199.56s: example will hold about the same. So let's say that he has about five to 10 cents of
4205.80s: extrinsic value. Let's call it 10 cents, which is $10 per contract times a thousand contracts.
4211.32s: That's essentially lighting $10,000 on fire. I don't think he did that.
4220.60s: So the reason why I don't think he exercised is because it doesn't,
4228.76s: and it literally, again, it's just tremendously economically inefficient.
4235.48s: He would be better by just buying. The other thing we can do actually is to just figure out,
4242.92s: essentially, what the, what the, let me see. So we added 40,000, give me one second. I need to do
4253.40s: a little bit of math.
4271.00s: What I'm doing is I'm going to take a look at the exact basis.
4283.56s: Blondesways, he said, so we sold them and took the cash out of his account. Cash moved for sure.
4301.24s: I don't know where or why, but cash did move. And this looks like
4308.52s: like, day swags says citing 10,000 on fires, 10,000 on fire when he lit 200 million on fire.
4315.00s: I'm not thinking or carrying one with the other, but it's funny to think of something was done.
4319.40s: Well, the thing is, where do you mean that he lit 200 million on fire? Where did that happen?
4325.32s: Because here's what I can tell you.
4327.64s: Here's what I off Putin says from the DFV chat after the 5GN was posted,
4340.12s: Redditor. Maybe you should use that 1.1 million to buy more shares. You've been sitting on the
4344.12s: cash for a while. DFV, maybe I will. Yeah, well, that's after this, right? So he already did.
4350.20s: So here it he bought more. So if we take a look at this, if we look at the total position here,
4362.60s: here's what we would do. We would take equals. So we would take this times this,
4376.20s: this, this times this divided by this minus this. So this tells me essentially, let me grab this.
4400.20s: And then now we need to take the total cost of these positions.
4409.40s: So this equals this minus this divided by this minus this.
4423.88s: That's what he added the shares for. So the basis that he got into the shares for was 1759.
4437.48s: So this also tells me, again, definitively, that he did not exercise.
4451.88s: Because the basis is much higher than what his strike was.
4462.76s: Cedric says, sorry for spam, but market makers aren't hedging for exercise for the tens. They are.
4468.20s: Of course they are. What are you talking about? That's exactly what they're doing.
4474.92s: Oh, Mills hit me up for dinner.
4484.60s: I'm going to try Mexican. See if I can get Mexican through.
4490.44s: Cedric says they already did. It's my point. Lauren says no Mexican.
4495.56s: Damn it. Lauren. That's what I was going to go for. Fuck. Then maybe no Mexican.
4500.12s: Cedric says for the 20s, they still have some hedging to go. Yeah, but it's not a big position.
4507.32s: Like he's not going to create a gamma ramp for himself by that at all. There's nowhere near enough
4516.04s: in that case. Yeah. So I don't think so.
4522.68s: Cells on Mexican. Yeah, I'm going to try Mexican. I'll see what else she comes back with.
4532.60s: It'll be a fight for the ages, but we'll see what we can do. I mean, I feel like Mexican would be great.
4541.56s: Who is in the mood for some Mexican?
4543.56s: Rapsha says, what if the 20s had a bunch of OI at the time? I don't think that matters.
4552.28s: I don't think that would change anything here.
4559.64s: Blanc ways, he says, how much did he sell the tens for? We could figure that out. I don't
4563.64s: really care enough to if I'm being honest with you, but we could figure it out by looking at
4569.40s: the change in the portfolio. It would just be a little bit annoying. I think, and not actually
4575.80s: very elucidating. So yeah. Okay. So I think we've analyzed this enough at this point, though,
4588.76s: that we know a few things happened. We know without a doubt that there's some really strange
4595.16s: behavior here. We know that he clearly chose to take the in the monies down while holding the out
4601.00s: of the monies, which are still decaying. We know that that doesn't actually make sense from a holding
4608.12s: perspective. It just doesn't make sense because no matter what, he's going to, he doesn't stand to
4617.56s: make as much and he doesn't stand to make as much to the downside if things go against him.
4624.60s: So this is just a very, very anomalous day. And I'm actually going to add a note here.
4633.16s: The 21, the 20s.
4643.00s: Good to lose
4648.44s: around 6K per day in theta. The tens were at 3K. Didn't need money.
4663.32s: You buy the 40k shares.
4667.40s: Add enough in the account already. Just a couple notes for you boy, because don't really know.
4681.88s: Lauren, I don't know if you're on the same page is my wife, but Mel literally goes,
4686.84s: is there anything that's not Mexican that you're open to this evening?
4695.40s: Poor Mel. I've told you guys, I don't really care about eating. So like, I'll eat the same stuff
4700.68s: over and over and over again and not really care. But I'll see, maybe we'll try Italian.
4708.44s: Feel like Italian is an okay, compromise.
4716.28s: Italian's always good.
4721.16s: All right, so that Lauren, okay, so it looks like,
4727.08s: so Reese, fun fact, there was, we, we, Mel and I, after we have dinner, we always go for a walk,
4733.72s: because it's good for your digestive system. And we started that a while ago.
4739.08s: And one night she was telling me like, on the walk that she literally tuned into the live stream
4744.52s: at some point to figure out if I ordered dinner yet. And it was like, right as I was ordering dinner,
4750.36s: which is hilarious that she was using that is like the benchmark. I thought that that was hilarious.
4756.28s: But yeah, I think, oh, there's also this other place that she really likes called Carl Strauss.
4767.96s: I actually bet she'll go for Carl Strauss. Except I can't send it.
4777.48s: I bet you she'll, she'll jump on this one.
4780.20s: So here we'll do probably like a burger, a bet.
4794.76s: And then I think we're good. All of the of good chicken tacos, never mind.
4802.68s: We got to do chicken tacos. I don't know about fish tacos. That's never been my, my ish.
4812.04s: I don't know if that's acceptable or not.
4818.68s: Fish tacos, I feel like you're okay, but definitely not my preferred.
4825.64s: Here we go.
4832.28s: Rhino says, would you ever live in the Keys or Puerto Rico? No, definitely not the keys.
4839.56s: The keys, they have just a disgusting amount of insects like flies and shit that tend to just
4849.24s: destroy my life. So yeah, definitely not that. I would be down for,
4864.28s: I don't know, I think something like Puerto Rico I would do temporarily or do it for periods of time.
4872.76s: But yeah, I don't think that that would be my, I don't think that would be my go-to personally.
4877.48s: It's a little, little not my climate as I consider it.
4887.24s: Perfect. We are Gucci.
4891.72s: These swags says does San Diego have a culture for a certain food specialty? Probably Mexican,
4896.76s: I would say. Yeah, I don't, I don't really care for Californian food much. It's kind of,
4903.72s: I don't know, I view it as like very whatever. I much, much, much prefer New York stuff. New
4909.64s: York food is just light years better in general, I believe. But it's not like parable, but it's definitely
4918.12s: not great. Sweet. All right, so we're on to the next.
4927.56s: Rhino says I'll be in San Diego, Carl's bad February for a con, yeah dude, if you come out here,
4932.52s: let me know. Hit me up. I am around. Sometimes the, it depends on when in February because hopefully my
4941.08s: back will be better, well, the sciatica stuff will be back, will be better by then because I'm going
4945.00s: to keep rehabbing with the disc stuff so that we're going to get back on our, our, our travel schedule.
4951.16s: But all right, so now we need to go catch up and we need to move on. So now we did 5 Jan, so now we
4960.92s: need 11 Jan. Long Sways says new guests kept his buying power increased to share position a lot.
4970.28s: Uh, could have been a, but I don't actually see why. I mean, we'll find out.
4977.08s: But I don't see why he would do that. All right, let's take a look now at we're in
4986.76s: 11 Jan 21. So 11 Jan 21. Total gain here is now 1236 974.03. The cash on hand is about the same. So 1128842.2.
5013.88s: And then the total value is 31588842.2. Same same. So I don't see the, the large variance at this point
5027.96s: between the account value. So it does look like he previously pulled capital out. Again, I'm not sure why.
5038.44s: And then he has the same residual positions. The fascinating part is he still has these 20 calls. That's crazy at this point.
5055.64s: That's absolutely crazy. So he's still holding these 15 Jan 20s. They literally expire in nine days.
5068.92s: 15 Jan, no, four days. My bad. What on earth?
5085.56s: I just don't understand this.
5091.08s: Fascinating. So same position now. We're long.
5094.84s: 50. Dr. Z says, does him holding 20s the longer influence the gamma ramp now? Not really. Yeah, no, it's a fair speculation.
5105.24s: I think it's totally fair. That's kind of the whole point is to, you know, take guess this here. I just do not see
5111.40s: at all why he would do this. So 122723 on those.
5116.68s: 8723.
5123.64s: 153.
5129.32s: Yeah, see like this is the problem. If you go back to December, even when so this is theta decay.
5141.40s: This is literally a perfect, perfect, perfect example of theta decay for you. So let's.
5150.04s: Yeah, this is literally perfect. So when we look at his position on these 20s, we can see that his
5161.24s: total gain here is $289,000. This is when GameStop was trading at 2015. Now if we go to where we are now,
5172.76s: 11 Jan, GameStop is trading at 1994. So about the same price. But these 20s are now only showing him
5182.36s: $122,700. So that's like 150 grand almost that essentially went away just because of
5192.60s: theta decay. And again, there's a slight delta component to it, but it's slight. The majority of
5198.28s: this variance comes from theta decay, which is crazy. And again, it's it's why managing these 20s
5205.32s: earlier just makes sense across the board. I just don't understand this. 13th.
5214.52s: I just don't get it. This is crazy. 13 Jan 21. Total gain is 3638663866
5229.72s: 9 7 4 0 3, Cash is 1128842.2 and then value is 57888842. 2. So, a big, accommodating move.
5259.72s: Let me double check these numbers. I think I missed this one out.
5272.32s: I'm gonna move this over so I can see better. There we go.
5279.60s: 3866974. 386.
5286.68s: Yeah, this is...
5289.24s: Wrong.
5290.68s: 38669.
5295.96s: And some 4.03.
5301.68s: That's correct.
5308.04s: And he's still in these.
5311.40s: And now he has two days of expiration.
5315.76s: So he's taking them all the way in.
5319.92s: 38669.
5328.40s: Which is interesting because is a look back over this.
5332.76s: I can see that he exited some of these longer term, the 15 Jan 21s,
5338.12s: the 17s and the 15s.
5340.08s: And he got out of those like two months, a month, slash two months in advance.
5345.96s: Which is nuts.
5350.76s: Absolutely nuts.
5351.96s: Okay.
5355.96s: Another thing I'm noticing is we're now updating very close to one another.
5362.96s: And I don't know why.
5371.96s: But these are 21s.
5375.96s: These should all be 2020.
5387.96s: Find 2021, replace with 2020.
5399.96s: And then these should be 21.
5405.96s: Okay.
5406.96s: So now we're at the 14th.
5409.96s: I don't.
5410.96s: I also don't understand this or team Jan.
5414.96s: Little gain 1, 2, 4, 5, 500.
5420.96s: Cash.
5421.96s: 2600601.38.
5425.96s: Value.
5427.96s: 7368.
5430.96s: 601.38.
5435.96s: So we'll check my numbers.
5439.96s: Nope.
5440.96s: I fucked up.
5441.96s: I did the day gain.
5443.96s: Man, your boys off tonight.
5445.96s: 3982750.
5448.96s: About 4, 3.
5452.96s: 3982.
5455.96s: 754.3.
5457.96s: Okay.
5458.96s: 2600.
5459.96s: 6113.
5460.96s: That's good.
5461.96s: 7368.
5463.96s: 6113.
5464.96s: That's good.
5468.96s: There's a slight variance between these.
5473.96s: Like a couple hundred bucks.
5474.96s: So it could be a rounding.
5476.96s: A rounding thing.
5482.96s: Interesting.
5484.96s: And so now.
5488.96s: On the 14th.
5489.96s: So he.
5491.96s: Didn't exercise.
5493.96s: Because the quantity is the same price is the same.
5496.96s: So there's no exercise here.
5500.96s: He didn't add any more options.
5503.96s: He simply took more cash in.
5506.96s: And he exited essentially with one DTE.
5509.96s: So he exited.
5511.96s: The 20s.
5512.96s: The 15 Jan.
5514.96s: 21s.
5515.96s: The 20 DTE.
5517.96s: And he's holding.
5520.96s: This 16 April 21.
5523.96s: Well, this is one DTE is where you exited.
5529.96s: So let's grab that formatting here.
5533.96s: And then.
5537.96s: Let's continue.
5541.96s: And then I'll go through.
5543.96s: Let's finish out January.
5545.96s: And then we can switch.
5547.96s: And pivot to seeing like.
5550.96s: Recent news.
5552.96s: Recent tin foil.
5554.96s: So we can spend a little more time on like recent stuff.
5557.96s: We'll just spend the first part.
5559.96s: Doing this.
5560.96s: 21.
5561.96s: Because this is.
5563.96s: I find this stuff interesting.
5565.96s: But I also imagine some of you might not find it quite as enthralling.
5568.96s: But.
5569.96s: I still.
5570.96s: I'm not going to say.
5571.96s: I might not find it quite as enthralling.
5574.96s: But.
5576.96s: I still do want to make sure that we get through all of this even if it takes a little while,
5580.96s: I think it's really important.
5584.96s: So the total gain is.
5587.96s: Three.
5589.96s: 9 three two,
5591.96s: 750.
5593.96s: 43.
5594.96s: and then cash 2600479.97 value 7318479.97.
5623.28s: This looks like it matches. So I think that this is just a rounding issue that's okay.
5633.04s: And then we're holding the 16 April 21 or just do 16 April 12 calls. And now the
5649.28s: expiration for these is 16 April 21. And then today's 19 Jan 21. These are 87 DTE.
5663.04s: Okay. No change in shares and still sitting on
5669.44s: interesting. Still sitting on, man, why is that? So he's still sitting on $2.6 million. But the
5684.56s: part that I actually don't understand is why his cash went down. His cash went down by $121.
5690.96s: and I don't know why. Nothing else changed. The numbers all line up. So the variance in like
5699.68s: portfolio value and stuff lines up. I just don't understand that. The 19th will do the 22nd
5709.84s: point. Which shows no change again. This is 22 Jan, but he's posting way more frequently. Again,
5722.64s: way more frequently starting from December. Little gain is 7 7 9 0 250.43. I imagine some of it
5733.04s: has to be him being like any of us would be, which is just being like, this is fucking crazy.
5739.28s: And he's got to enjoy like showing people how nuts this portfolio is going. 1 7 5 9 7 9 9 7.
5759.20s: So clear match there. And he's still holding those Aprils. And now 22 Jan
5769.92s: 21 840 Te.
5778.64s: And we ride on.
5786.72s: We're going to need more of these. Let us continue. 22 Jan
5794.64s: and 25
5804.56s: 25. Okay.
5809.68s: and then
5811.58s: .
5826.24s: What will gain here is eight, two, six, nine,
5830.64s: 353.71, cash is for eight or zero, six, three, eight.
5837.64s: 0, 6, 3, 8, .96.
5842.64s: Value is 13, 8, 8, 0, 1, 3, 8, .96.
5854.64s: So money moved again, not much but some.
5858.64s: His account value should have been 2.704
5865.64s: and it's 2719, just in terms of account variance between those.
5875.64s: So as the count moved 2.7, it should have moved 2.719.
5879.64s: So it looks like some cash came out.
5885.64s: Copy those and then now we went forward three days.
5889.64s: So it's 81 DTE.
5893.64s: We continue. I have to move my little chicken scratch math here.
5897.64s: Out of the way.
5901.64s: And then cool. Well, I'll take a pause so far and anything jumping out to anybody that maybe I'm missing because so far it looks like we're holding.
5913.64s: I'm a little surprised that he's allowing the cash to come up as high as it is.
5920.64s: So if we take a look at the positions we can see some of this was trimmed off.
5925.64s: So we can see that the 16, the 16 April the 12s, they were at a thousand.
5934.64s: So he's took, he's taken 200 of those down.
5937.64s: So that's why we see this change in that.
5941.64s: So he's holding this but it's a partial profit.
5945.64s: So this would be partial profit on 16 April.
5953.64s: 12 calls and he did 200.
5957.64s: Lots sold.
5959.64s: And this is 81 DTE so really far out in time.
5965.64s: So this is one of the great mysteries that I have in my mind when I look at him.
5972.64s: Let's take a look at what this look like on the day. So this is 25 Jan.
5990.64s: I want to zoom it in so that it's like just a month.
6003.64s: So the 25th.
6010.64s: It started popping up massively.
6014.64s: So this looks like him taking profits.
6016.64s: This is like the first time I've gotten a glimpse of him doing something that looks like taking profits.
6023.64s: Which is really interesting because if I look at this from a timing perspective,
6029.64s: I again, from like a standard trading line of thought, this is not at all where I would take profits personally.
6036.64s: And it's because it's like it's been trending sideways for a while.
6040.64s: And then it starts really exploding up.
6043.64s: I mean, to me, this looks like exactly where I wouldn't want to take profits.
6049.64s: I would want to let them go.
6051.64s: And the option still have over 80 days to expiration.
6054.64s: So just yet another really, really interesting thing.
6065.64s: Roeing could he says getting up to 2.6 million wasn't taking profits.
6069.64s: It not the same.
6073.64s: So what I notice in these other trades here is these other trades like exiting the 17s and the 15s,
6084.64s: I would call that taking profits because in this case, it's very clear that these still had plenty of time left.
6092.64s: And he's taking some value off the table.
6095.64s: Then we have this example with the tens in the 20s, which is not about taking profit at all.
6101.64s: That's very clear because he holds them all the way in almost to 10 DTE for the tens.
6107.64s: And he takes those down again, which doesn't make sense.
6111.64s: So this one is very confusing to me.
6116.64s: Then he holds the 20s essentially up until one DTE, which also is not profit taking.
6127.64s: In that case, his hand is forced by time.
6130.64s: So here when he's managing further out in time, I consider that profit taking because it's being done when the options aren't expiring.
6138.64s: There's plenty of time left.
6140.64s: That's also what I notice here is that there is still plenty of time left in these options.
6144.64s: But the fact that he's choosing to take profits there tells me that it's based on something resembling to profit.
6152.64s: It's not being based on time.
6155.64s: This is the fun stuff to me, like to be able to analyze this level of detail and to gather these kinds of components is so interesting to me.
6164.64s: A future whale 747.
6166.64s: I literally love that name.
6168.64s: Does have you ever investigated someone's trades the way you're doing with keys right now?
6172.64s: No, absolutely not.
6173.64s: And I mean, to be honest, the majority of the reason why I'm doing this with is because I'm doing it with you guys.
6181.64s: I think that this adds a lot of color to the story, but I personally, like if I was doing this in my own research, I wouldn't go into this layer of detail.
6192.64s: What I would do is just gloss over the trades.
6194.64s: But since the entire game stop story has a really critical component being Roryan Kitty,
6203.64s: then I think that like understanding his movements here is really, really important.
6211.64s: So yeah, no, definitely not to like going along by line like this because I've said it a million times.
6218.64s: I really don't care what other traders do.
6221.64s: Like it makes no difference to me.
6224.64s: I'm going to trade the way that I trade the way that I've been trading for almost 20 years now.
6230.64s: I'm going to keep doing just that.
6231.64s: So what other people do is generally completely, I don't care.
6236.64s: Now for him, it's very unique because he's also this strange actor in the space that does things so differently.
6246.64s: That's very, very fun to watch.
6248.64s: So yeah, it's definitely unique.
6251.64s: The layer of detail I'm going here.
6254.64s: Blancways, he says, but at one DT, he still made up, he still made the most profit.
6258.64s: No.
6263.64s: Let's double check.
6269.64s: So at one DTE that was on the 14 Jan update.
6274.64s: Well, they were gone.
6278.64s: 13.
6279.64s: They were here.
6280.64s: Yeah, definitely.
6281.64s: So he.
6283.64s: Those are at 31 40.
6286.64s: 30.
6287.64s: Yeah, so he would have made over a million dollars on those calls.
6291.64s: Here.
6292.64s: So definitely he ended up getting at the very and again, like this is this is the stuff that I'm talking about.
6300.64s: I personally do not view this as some sort of like really great timing.
6306.64s: In this case, he got really lucky with respect to the pop happening when it did to drive the profit that much.
6315.64s: Because again, like if you go back to 11 Jan, his total gain was $122,000.
6323.64s: And it popped to over a million dollars.
6328.64s: And it popped to over a million in two days later.
6332.64s: So like that is here, fucking luck.
6335.64s: And the other component that these are tied to expiring four days from here.
6345.64s: So what I can tell you is that Roy and Kitty at this point, he was these were going to be whatever they were going to be.
6352.64s: Either he was going to take him in and he was going to lose this amount of money, which he didn't care about.
6356.64s: Obviously, or they were going to be something he wanted to take down.
6359.64s: And that's why he chose to not take it into expiration, but take it down before expiration is because they had perceivably made enough that he cared enough.
6367.64s: And he would have taken them down either the well, not the 13th.
6372.64s: He would have taken them down on the 14th, because I think you guys have told me he posts these after the market close.
6377.64s: Yeah.
6379.64s: So.
6381.64s: Yeah, in this case.
6385.64s: In this case, it is.
6387.64s: Without a doubt, just magical dose of luck that led to that kind of pop in that time frame, which is incredible.
6395.64s: Super, super cool to see, but yeah, definitely very lucky.
6400.64s: Because he would have taken them down here on the 14th.
6405.64s: Blancway, as he said, he paid less than $1 and exited when it multiplied heavily.
6411.64s: He just yellowed his money and got less sensitive with time.
6415.64s: Sort of.
6419.64s: Yeah, sort of.
6422.64s: I think there's a little bit more to this than just that, but yeah, in this case, he, at least with those options, it was just very fortunate that they came in where they did.
6433.64s: That's all.
6434.64s: At least that's the way I look at it.
6439.64s: That's not to say, again, that there's not.
6443.64s: Some element of skill.
6446.64s: Obviously, there's an element of skill, but the problem is is with this specific scenario, it was within a couple days of expiration.
6453.64s: And he essentially had a 10th of what these ended up showing.
6459.64s: So that ended up just being really, really fortunate timing.
6464.64s: But yeah, let's go to 25th.
6470.64s: Yeah, we have like four left of these.
6472.64s: So this is perfect.
6473.64s: And then we can jump into the 10 foil.
6476.64s: So now actually is a great time to start thinking about any of the 10 foil stuff or any theories or anything specifically that we want to take a look at.
6485.64s: We should take a look at the movements on Friday.
6488.64s: For sure.
6489.64s: But then if there's anything else that you're interested, this would be a good time to start.
6493.64s: Jen in that part of your brain up.
6495.64s: 17234.
6498.64s: 853.71.
6503.64s: Ash.
6506.64s: 4840.
6509.64s: 638.95.
6515.64s: Value 22845.
6519.64s: 638.
6523.64s: And we're still holding the remainder.
6529.64s: So we're holding 816 April of calls.
6539.64s: And this is now 79 dt.
6543.64s: No other change count value same.
6546.64s: No change.
6551.64s: This is now 20.
6554.64s: Wait, what?
6559.64s: This is 26, and I fucked up the date.
6563.64s: So this is 80 dt.
6566.64s: And then now is on 27, Jen.
6572.64s: 27, Jen 21.
6574.64s: Total gain.
6576.64s: 3, 3, 3, 7, 8.
6581.64s: 0, 0, 8 ø.
6584.64s: 6, 3,
6588.54s: ash 13 840.
6590.64s: 2 9 feet 4.
6592.64s: What do you guys notice here?
6595.64s: Value 47 973
6601.40s: United dot E4
6611.64s: I cash delta miss something up here.
6613.88s: There's something very, very different here.
6623.88s: So 333780008.63 is correct.
6629.88s: 1384298.84 is correct.
6633.88s: Then 47973298.84 is correct.
6639.88s: 251272512.
6649.88s: And he also pulled money out of the account.
6655.88s: So here we had another partial profit.
6659.88s: Which was 300, 300 lots.
6667.88s: Holding 500,
6671.88s: of the 16 April of calls.
6677.88s: So this tells me something really important actually.
6681.88s: Of a lot of me says,
6687.88s: January 27th was the day that the buy button was turned off for Robin Hood users.
6691.88s: Got it.
6693.88s: Yeah. So what this tells me is that.
6699.88s: He's scaling out like he's absolutely scaling out.
6703.88s: I can watch it real time.
6705.88s: So he first started scaling out on the 25th.
6709.88s: Here.
6713.88s: He let that run.
6717.88s: Then on the 27th, he started scaling out more.
6721.88s: But it was a really relatively light scale out.
6727.88s: And then he kept the shares.
6733.88s: And he kept.
6735.88s: And he was 100 of those contracts.
6739.88s: But again, this tells me very much that this is profit taking again.
6743.88s: This is not him looking for value.
6747.88s: This is not him waiting for a specific amount of time to pass.
6753.88s: Or just to see what happens over a course of time.
6757.88s: These options still have 79 DTE.
6761.88s: And he's going to be back with that tells me.
6765.88s: Same amount of shares so far.
6769.88s: That's the 27th.
6771.88s: 28 Jan.
6775.88s: Total gain here.
6777.88s: 18.
6779.88s: 575.
6782.88s: 008.63.
6786.88s: Ash 13.
6790.88s: Looks like exactly the same as this.
6792.88s: So I'm just going to copy and paste it.
6794.88s: And then value is 33 17.
6798.88s: 0298.84.
6801.88s: So he's also clearly leaving the majority of.
6815.88s: Capital in the account.
6817.88s: But he's taking like 10,000 20,000.
6821.88s: He's taking little bits of money out here.
6825.88s: He took 15,000 which again, that's super clear to see.
6831.88s: Here again, like another 10,000.
6835.88s: So he's taking like normal, just normal amounts of regular people money out of these accounts.
6842.88s: And now so he's still holding.
6846.88s: Holding 516 April 12 calls.
6853.88s: And this is after another days past the 780TE.
6857.88s: And then.
6866.88s: 29 Jan is the last one here.
6871.88s: This is the same thing.
6874.88s: 28.
6875.88s: Oh, I fucked this data.
6877.88s: This is 28 Jan 21.
6879.88s: And then this is 29 Jan 21.
6884.88s: Okay.
6886.88s: So total gain 31 471.
6892.88s: 258.63.
6896.88s: Ash 13.
6898.88s: 817.
6902.88s: Again, more money moved here.
6906.88s: No changes.
6907.88s: So it looks like he pulled money out 295.47.
6913.88s: Value 46.043.
6918.88s: 545.
6920.88s: Up for seven.
6924.88s: Oh, no, it lands up.
6927.88s: No money out.
6936.88s: Look at the last price on that.
6939.88s: 325.
6943.88s: That's awesome.
6948.88s: Off Putin says over 10 million and unrealized gains on the 12 calls on the 27th.
6953.88s: 1710.
6958.88s: That's good.
6961.88s: cane in context cost him 10.26 yeah definitely.
6964.88s: Red says crazy that he didn't sell any covered calls at those levels.
6967.88s: Yeah.
6968.88s: I actually agree with you.
6969.88s: I would have been especially on 50,000.
6972.88s: You could have.
6974.88s: Absolutely offered.
6975.88s: That's another thing that I think is important to know.
6977.88s: Actually now that you mention it is the fact that I.
6980.88s: I don't actually see that. I see essentially no evidence that he runs covered calls at all.
6988.48s: But that doesn't mean that he doesn't, it just means that I don't really see it. So yeah,
6994.16s: cool. Well, we got through January of 2021 and our next one will be the first of Feb. I'm going to
7005.52s: take a pause though on this part of things so that we can start taking a look at just some current
7014.64s: date stuff if you guys want or any other like theories or thesis that we want to take a look at.
7022.24s: And then we'll obviously pick back up with this next week. But I did tell Newton that I would give
7027.28s: him an update. So I'm going to text him really quick. All right, so ran through. What should I tell
7035.92s: Newton? The main things I noticed are running through January. So January 2021. I noticed a few themes.
7046.72s: The first theme that I noticed is that some, well, not even some one specific one particular one
7059.92s: to tick you learn options trade. Exiting in the money and keeping out of the money.
7073.92s: Didn't make sense. But ended up working out of lucky price movement leading two days.
7090.88s: Into expiration.
7096.96s: Pam says tell Newton that his hair is glorious. Okay, Pam says your hair is glorious.
7106.56s: And from the chat. Okay. The other thing I noticed is that previously,
7120.48s: I can see a habit. So I can see, I can see some habit of profit taking where options have longer
7133.84s: time frames remaining. But he takes either full or partial exits.
7147.04s: I can also see there are several instances of smaller amounts of money.
7158.16s: So around like 10K.
7164.32s: Around 10K. Being withdrawn.
7171.12s: From the account. A few times per month. What else do we see?
7179.52s: I can see.
7186.56s: Um.
7190.00s: Dark Mark says that the chat says hello.
7199.92s: And what else do I see?
7202.96s: The.
7204.96s: The other thing I noticed is that he does hold like large cash, cash positions for a little bit longer
7213.04s: than I would expect. So that's another thing I would note. He maintains relatively large cash positions.
7225.52s: And doesn't immediately reallocate capital.
7240.16s: To either existing trades or placing new ones.
7250.80s: Well, that's my report.
7255.84s: Oh.
7257.52s: To our friend Newton.
7259.92s: I'm going to grab a replacement.
7264.00s: Sparkling water super fast. And then we will dive in.
7269.04s: And we'll take a look at.
7271.60s: We'll take a look at the movement on Friday. And then we'll see if we have any ideas about that. So we'll be right back.
7315.36s: I'm going to go back to the other side.
7317.36s: Okay.
7319.36s: Okay.
7321.36s: Okay.
7323.36s: Okay.
7325.36s: Okay.
7327.36s: Okay.
7329.36s: Okay.
7331.36s: Okay.
7333.36s: Okay.
7335.36s: Okay.
7337.36s: Okay.
7339.36s: Okay.
7341.36s: We back at it and we have some Tylenol.
7348.72s: I don't know what I'm bound.
7355.44s: Oh, Rohingt Clity says I want to see if our C's purchases in the past
7359.44s: when dark pool or if they went lit.
7363.68s: It doesn't really matter if they go dark pool or lit because like you'll still see it in the volume.
7369.68s: But yeah, let's take a look.
7372.40s: So first to do that, I would need you to help me find where.
7382.16s: Is that on Newton sheet? Do we have a log of RC purchases? I think so, right?
7398.96s: I don't know where anything is on this. So yeah, I would need your help to help me
7405.36s: see where those are on the sheet. Where on the sheet? Walk me on a target.
7410.96s: Yeah, if you show me where this is happy to take a look and then we can go through and try to
7414.80s: identify where it would have happened. But I don't know off the top of my head personally where
7422.08s: that would have been.
7423.28s: And then check the discord for link to RC's 13D filing. Okay, cool. Let me pop in there.
7435.28s: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
7441.12s: Okay.
7447.12s: And then.
7451.52s: Okay.
7456.40s: 13D. This is from 10 June.
7464.40s: Wait, what am I looking at?
7471.36s: What did you give me?
7478.80s: Vladimir, where do you get the,
7482.96s: where do you get the, like, where are you getting those from?
7489.44s: And then, where in clitty says scroll down to aug 2020. Got it.
7500.80s: Yeah.
7505.28s: Here.
7511.60s: Vladimir says Edgar. Okay, got it. Yeah, if you, um,
7520.96s: if you have a list of the, the actual filings, that would be super helpful.
7524.88s: Okay.
7529.84s: RC Ventures. Yep.
7532.96s: Okay.
7538.96s: So 36, 847. This is from recent though.
7544.56s: This is 10 June, 2024. Is this the one that we want to look at?
7547.60s: Or do we want to look at this one that was.
7549.52s: Is.
7554.24s: Further back.
7566.24s: Cause we can figure out first filed aug 20. Okay, cool. So then let's start here.
7572.40s: So the first thing is let's see then.
7576.72s: If I grab.
7578.64s: Oh, where is my stuff here?
7581.68s: We go here.
7585.60s: Let's see.
7587.60s: I'll fall back. We can go at this.
7589.44s: You know me.
7591.12s: And then this was.
7594.08s: You told me 28 aug.
7601.92s: Okay, I think, um.
7624.32s: I'm not a.
7625.92s: I don't think that that's a limitation in terms of it didn't happen. We just might not
7634.20s: know it. So it probably be easier to look at the the more recent one. So the more recent
7641.00s: one you gave me is from 10 June 2024. So let's look at that one really fast. 10 June.
7655.92s: 24. Nothing. This just doesn't sound right.
7670.56s: I don't understand this. Weird. So I can't see here at least for the time being. I don't know why that
7689.52s: part's kind of interesting to me. Yeah, I don't I don't get it. From this Friday. Yeah, I looked
7714.12s: at it's in Friday, but that's a good fact check to see. So what the 20 20th. Oh, great call.
7729.44s: It's got to be something with. No, I mean, because this is. It's got to be something with the date
7745.08s: tool. I think that's what it is. Because notice how. Wait a minute. What the fuck is happening right
7760.32s: now? Something is. Hold on, something's wrong here. Because yesterday I'm selecting yesterday
7773.80s: and it's showing me the 19th. And it's showing today is the what? What the hell is going on
7785.80s: right now? I'm just going to kill this one. And then let's grab a new one. And let's see if we can fix this.
7801.80s: So GME let's take a look at the 20th and see if that filter. Okay, so that filter worked. Okay, great. Here we go.
7811.80s: All right, so we're back at it. So here's the 20th. This filtered correctly. So that's good. So now let's take a look at you told me it was.
7823.80s: 10 June. Let's go to 10 June.
7830.80s: 10 June. There we go. Okay, great. This is good.
7840.80s: So I can see this. Let's sort it by size and see if his order went through. His order was 36, 847.
7859.80s: So it looks like his order. If it went through the dark pool, it was broken up. It didn't go through as a solid order.
7869.80s: That's the date that it went through, right? Yeah, date of yep, 10 June, 2024, 10 June, 2024. Yep.
7878.80s: So this would have captured it. So it tells me that his order didn't go through or sees order specifically didn't go through in a solid block.
7889.80s: So that means it would have been broken up to some degree for whatever reason. So yeah.
7899.80s: 36, 847 or is total holdings. Oh, okay, got it. Sorry.
7904.80s: I wasn't paying attention. Where's the I see the soul voting power. So what does it show the.
7911.80s: I see this is just a standard update. Yeah, okay. Yeah. So where was his last transaction. That's what I need.
7921.80s: Because I see what you mean this is just talking about its total. This is just the standard amendment. Yeah.
7927.80s: I went through it a little too fast. Sorry.
7932.80s: So yeah, let's take a look at August. We can take a look at the August dates and see if anything pops up there.
7941.80s: The problem though is I need to know how many shares from the Edgar filing. Can you guys drop that in the discord so I can take a look.
7949.80s: Dr. Zayas, is that what you dropped in here? No, that's from December.
7955.80s: Okay, so the.
7958.80s: Riven says 9 June 2023. Okay, let's take a look at that one.
7964.80s: Okay, cool. 253,000 shares. Thank you.
7968.80s: So let's go to 2023.
7976.80s: Okay.
7982.80s: And 253,000 shares. So yeah, here it got broken up as well.
7988.80s: Not a solid.
7991.80s: Not a solid transaction. So the only reason why this really matters is the fact that it's not like a solid transaction means we can't clearly delineate when they've happened is what it boils down to.
8005.80s: So yeah, it's limited efficacy to tell whether it went through dark pool or let exchange. But again, remember if it goes through a dark pool, it's still like if it's reported here, this isn't an internalized order. It's why we can see it.
8023.80s: So the fact that we can see it tells me it's not internalized and it tells me this is still hitting the consolidated tape right because that's another thing is they see people mix up what this volume thing means that volume is cumulative.
8036.80s: So you'll see if you sort by time and go down the volume is always going to be less and then as you go up, it's always going to be higher.
8044.80s: And then the volume that you see here is going to match if we look at it on a chart. So if we go to, for example, we'll use the most recent one.
8054.80s: So let's go to yesterday.
8058.80s: That's doing the weird thing again, but whatever go to today and you can see that the volume here is 62 million right so that's telling me that the volume for game stop over the day was 62 million or whatever at the point that that came in.
8070.80s: So the volume here, the volume is 61, 61,919,000, the volume is 62 million. So I see a lot of people kind of confused by that, but that's the volume that you see here and the trades that you see here are going to hit the consolidated tape.
8091.80s: So I think that's the only reason why they exist is to try to prevent front running, but it's not the name is way more nefarious than what they actually are.
8107.80s: I think most people confuse dark pool orders with internalized orders, which are very different internalized orders do not hit the consolidated tape.
8117.80s: In internalized order at some point would have already hit the tape because of the original transaction that occurred now it doesn't help with any sort of sense of market efficiency transparent markets at all.
8129.80s: So that's the problem with internalized orders is that we're not seeing updated transactions there.
8135.80s: So when we're looking at this, this is all stuff that still eventually hits the consolidated tape.
8144.80s: That Lauren says on Friday, a lot of volume came in pre and after hours is that why partially it's because a lot of larger institutions will access the market during pre and post trading hours.
8156.80s: It's because there's also a tendency for larger trades to come in towards the beginning of the day and towards the end of the day, you'll find this almost any single day that you look at the market.
8170.80s: Where if we do let's do like a five day five minute chart, if you take a look at the volume mid day pretty much every day, even here where volume was really high on a relative basis, you'll still see volume slump towards the middle of the day.
8186.80s: This is very, very common. Now there's always anomalies right so volume spiked up for this a little bit, but then still came down.
8193.80s: That's just very, very normal to see volume towards the beginning and the end of the day. There's nothing really remarkable about that.
8201.80s: That's just standard market activity. That's why like professional traders like myself, most of my transactions are done towards the end of the day.
8210.80s: I don't trade a ton intraday. I'll trade like zero DTEs and stuff like that. Intraday or you know during more like non normal portions of the day, but even as a professional retail trader.
8222.80s: I'm still trading at a size that doesn't really matter. I don't need a ton of liquidity to do most of what I do.
8228.80s: So yeah, Vladimir says funds rebalance on Friday. Yeah, well it's rebalancing. It was also triple whitching, but the problem is with stuff like triple whitching. It happens so frequently now that it's really not that big a deal.
8245.80s: People I think it still matters to a degree, but it's not as big of a deal as it used to be because triple whitching or what used to be quadwitching which essentially has gone away and is consolidated into triple whitching now is there's so many
8259.80s: explorations now that it really is I don't want to call superfluous. It's not quite that insignificant, but it's nowhere near as significant as we used to hold it in regard with.
8270.80s: So it's a little more mellow. So yeah, awesome. Super, super fun. I love getting into the trades for Roinkitt. The last thing I wanted to talk to you guys about actually is I don't know if you are familiar with the dude named
8285.80s: Peruvian bull. I think that's his name on Twitter. If I'm not mistaken. I think that's the name on Twitter. And so he and I we're going to do a live session. I think probably next Thursday is the current game plan.
8304.80s: So I don't know if there's anything in particular that you think we should cover or I should you know bring up with him, but the game plan is I don't know him.
8314.80s: So the game plan is just a bullshit with them a little bit understand some of his background and then to hopefully talk a little bit about just game stop from his perspective, what he's seen and then kind of analyze what's going on in game stop together.
8330.80s: But I think the game plan is to do that on a live stream. It I think so. It might be a recorded podcast that goes out. I'm undecided yet. But yeah, we'll we'll see we'll see exactly how it gets structured. But the plan is to do that.
8350.80s: Like I said, next week. So if there's anything that you think would be good for us to talk about or cover, just let me know and then I can add it to an agenda because that's the hope is to start just exploring the whole thing from different angles.
8364.80s: I'm going to have Dave Lauer back on my podcast. I do like a monthly podcast for urban finance with them. But I'll have Dave Lauer on my podcast. I think next week or the week after.
8376.80s: So we'll talk a little bit about market structure kind of some of the anomalies of something like game stop and stuff like that. So that is the game plan. As always, absolute blast hanging out. Let me know if there's anything that we should take a look at be an outlier or an ape or both.
8396.80s: I'll see you all later.
