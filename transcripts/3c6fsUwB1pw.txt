0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
90.00s: you
120.00s: you
150.00s: you
180.00s: you

300.00s: you
302.00s: you
330.00s: you
361.00s: you
363.00s: you
390.00s: Yeah, they'll spoil in different ways.
393.00s: Lauren says, past for future,
394.96s: verse future, that's not it.
397.52s: We talked about this last time.
400.96s: So think of it this way.
406.00s: We know that implied volatility is derived from the market, right?
413.64s: So then where does implied volatility come from?
419.64s: How do we figure out what to put into the market for us
425.12s: therefore then henceforth unto forever known be able to price?
432.16s: Kind of a carried away with those fun words.
435.68s: The question here though is where does IV come from?
438.64s: We know that it's derived from the market,
440.32s: so that means somebody has to input what we think implied volatility is.
446.08s: So where does that input come from?
449.60s: Dejean, Dejean is the closest so far by far the closest.
455.36s: Dejean says different pricing models, that's the closest.
463.68s: Re says best guess based on standard deviation.
466.64s: Travel Ursula says historical, Raphael says volatility.
469.92s: Nice job Raphael, glad to see that you're jumping in and getting right into the mix.
474.56s: We know we're talking about volatility.
476.56s: So right on.
478.32s: Okay.
480.40s: This is a really important point.
482.72s: We're going to talk about this more, but oh shit, stop that.
487.12s: I try to use my pen and it like hung onto the little drawing pad one sec.
491.52s: Let's get us resented here.
493.60s: Cool.
495.20s: I actually fully expected this, which is why this is a quiz question.
498.96s: Because this concept is actually very important.
502.16s: And we talked about it last time, but Lawrence says BSM that is incorrect.
507.36s: It's a good guess.
508.88s: Actually believe it or not, BSM is how we get this.
515.44s: So if we think about, well, we can answer number two while we answer number one.
519.92s: So first answer number two for me.
522.40s: What is the one unknown input into a pricing model?
526.88s: What's that guess?
528.40s: Mark says extrinsic value, that's not it.
531.60s: Good guess.
533.04s: Travel says we obviously missed it last time definitely.
536.08s: And the reason why I think people miss it is because it's a really subtle detail.
540.00s: That's easy to skip over, but it's an important one.
544.32s: Okay, beautiful.
545.44s: So Reese says, Vol, good.
548.24s: Lawrence says IV, which is actually more correct because for Reese's answer,
552.72s: and I know you're just typing quick, but.
555.28s: Vol can be different kinds of things.
557.12s: So Dejon and travel same comment to you guys.
560.24s: Vol is not wrong, but when we're talking, when we're in like a basic setting,
564.96s: where we're working on getting the fundamentals down,
568.00s: this is where I try to make sure that we're using the correct language instead of common
572.96s: parlance, right? So you guys saying volatility, I understand what you mean.
576.88s: You mean implied volatility?
579.04s: That's just in common parlance.
581.04s: But the reality is there are lots of different kinds of volatility.
584.08s: There's realize volatility, future realize volatility, historic volatility.
589.44s: There's a lot of different kinds of all.
591.68s: So we, in this context, the one unknown input to a pricing model would not be something like
600.16s: historic vol, realize of all, the one unknown input would be forecast.
608.24s: And the other acceptable answer is implied volatility.
612.56s: So forward looking, that's the key takeaway here is we're talking about
619.68s: forward looking volatility. So now, how does IV differ from forecast?
626.56s: Really simple. Think of it this way.
631.76s: You go to weather.com and you see that it's going to be 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
638.24s: I guess I could just put a degrees. It's going to be 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
645.20s: You found that it's going to be 50 degrees Fahrenheit by going to a website and seeing what
651.36s: somebody else figured out based on whatever tools they have, the weather people, which they're
657.04s: not always super accurate. So who knows what fucking tools they have. Maybe they just do the
660.32s: rock outside the window thing. But joking aside, you going to weather.com is essentially
667.84s: the same as getting implied volatility. We're going into the options market and then we're just
673.60s: isolating all of the knowns versus the unknown inputs into the pricing model.
678.80s: And we're saying what's the remaining number? It's a differential equation. So we just solve
683.92s: for the implied volatility component. That's where this number comes from.
688.24s: Forecast is akin to the weather man or woman. I am completely gender neutral when it comes to
695.68s: weather people, weather persons. And the weather, the weather people, they need to go out and they
702.96s: don't need to look at their barometers. They might step outside and see if their head gets wet.
714.08s: The joking aside, what I'm talking about is the weather person is actually doing some sort of
719.52s: research to see what they think the temperature for tomorrow is supposed to be.
727.84s: So they're the ones that are forecasting. They're using different tools to create a forecast.
734.72s: And then they're putting it onto a website that you get to go look at. Okay. So now let's look at
739.68s: this in an options context forecast IV or I'm sorry forecast of all is typically done by all
752.56s: different kinds of volatility pricing models.
764.40s: These are all of your different kind of garches.
770.48s: Which there's E garge, EJ garge.
778.16s: There's garge plus jump diffusion.
785.52s: There's binomial.
789.36s: Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. There's a million different, there's a million different kinds
793.76s: of models. All of these different kind of entities are attempting to try to figure out what
802.16s: volatility should be. They are forecasting it. They're using and maintaining their own volatility
811.68s: surface model. This allows them to come up with their best estimates for what the implied
822.40s: volatility for each and every option should be. So the way to think about forecast,
829.28s: this is typically institutions or professional side traders and investors, really institutions
835.76s: typically that are running analysis to actually try to price volatility. Whereas implied volatility
844.80s: is literally just looking at what an option is priced at and then backing out what the current
852.48s: volatility is based on the pricing. But the forecast of all is what's fed into the model.
862.56s: I'm going to take a pause here. We're going to spend more time when we talk about volatility
867.04s: getting into the weeds on this. But I do want to make sure that this concept is clear because the
872.00s: importance here is understanding the nuance when we're talking about implied volatility,
877.12s: the implied volatility is obviously based on current market prices. It's not based on
884.64s: anything other than that.
892.64s: Rises, so forecast is just anyone's forecast. I could have one you can have a different one.
897.84s: Yeah, that's correct. But let's say that and again, the way that the forecast manifests
903.68s: themselves is through the pricing of an option. When we're talking about the pricing of an option,
908.64s: it's really essentially us talking about volatility. Because if we go into an options chain
917.92s: and we look at the price of any of these, this is just looking at spy. When we look at all of these
925.36s: different options, we know all of the individual inputs that are going into this options price.
934.16s: Let's call it the 600 puts. We know the price of the underlying. We know the yield. We know that
940.16s: it's an American style option. We know that this is a put. We know the days to expiration. We know
945.68s: the risk-free rate. We know all of these different details. The one thing that we don't know is
951.52s: implied volatility. Somebody has to determine what the implied volatility is. All of those other
960.32s: inputs essentially are knowns. When we're looking at the price of an option, we're literally,
968.48s: I know it's kind of esoteric. It's hard to connect the dots for people on this. But we're pretty
972.88s: much looking at volatility. We want to know what volatility is price that. And it's because everything
978.56s: else is already known. So the only thing that we don't know and the only thing that really this
982.64s: price is highly varied off of beyond those inputs that are standardized and known is volatility.
988.64s: So this implied volatility column is literally just extracting out all of those known inputs.
996.08s: And we're seeing what's left. We're solving for volatility. That's all that's happening here.
1003.04s: So to Reese's point before, anybody can forecast all. So if I choose to go through here and I decide,
1012.64s: well, my volatility model says implied volatility right now should be 11% as compared to this 10.72%.
1021.28s: So in my model, in my world, this is low. So then I can make a bet off of that.
1028.96s: Maybe I can come up with some sort of horizontal trade to play the relative value of the 600
1034.16s: by the 600 option and sell the 600 option out in 11 February 12 February 13 February through some
1040.00s: other expiration works too expensive. Or if there's a option in the same expiration cycle,
1046.08s: that's too expensive that I want to sell. I can just create a vertical spread.
1050.00s: But the point being is if I'm maintaining my own model as a retail trader,
1054.88s: I can try to come up with some ideas here. But the reality is the market is probably going to
1060.80s: price these better than any of us can. I've tried to maintain a model and sometimes it's decent.
1066.80s: But the like just the reality is with as many market participants as there are and how much
1073.28s: big money is in this, we're not going to price, vol better than what the market price is all.
1078.56s: It's just the fucking reality. So then we as the retail trading side of things,
1083.68s: we essentially take whatever the implied volatility is and we say,
1088.00s: this is probably pretty close to what it actually is. We don't know, but it's probably pretty close to
1092.08s: what it actually is. So to recap that whole thing, forecast vol is actually doing the work
1099.04s: of figuring out what the volatility of an option should be.
1102.32s: Implied volatility is when we extract the market price of vol from an option. That's the difference.
1114.32s: Dejean says, can I use gamma exposure to create my own vol forecast? Completely different things.
1119.04s: Gamma exposure is just a entirely different concept than trying to forecast
1125.44s: vol. The way that we forecast volatility, and this is why I use the weather analogy,
1130.88s: it's not all too dissimilar from how we forecast the weather. And I use this analogy all the time
1136.88s: because it's really good. I live in Southern California. Today it was 50, 50, well right now,
1144.72s: it's 55 degrees. So if I were to guess what the weather tomorrow in Southern California is going
1152.88s: to be specifically the temperature, if I were to guess what the temperature is going to be tomorrow
1157.84s: at the same time, 1715, what is my best guess? My best guess is that it's probably going to be
1164.96s: something close to this, probably something close to 55 degrees like it is right now, probably.
1171.52s: Now we could have a stormfront move through and cause a massive change. In the volatility world,
1178.32s: that's when volatility becomes transitory. But what we're talking about now is the propensity
1183.44s: for volatility to cluster, just like weather clusters. And again, we'll get way deeper in a volatility.
1189.92s: I don't want to get too far down that rabbit hole in this session. But the main point is the way
1197.12s: that we try and forecast volatility has a lot to do with looking at what the recent past looks like.
1204.00s: And then we can use all different kinds of data injects, which is a big part of coming up with
1210.88s: an accurate forecast model for volatility. It's not just figuring out how to factor in price
1217.20s: shocks and things like that. It's also knowing everything about the stock. Is there any sort of
1223.12s: news coming up that could potentially impact the price of this stock? And it doesn't have to be news
1229.12s: that's tied directly to the stock. It could be news that's tied to an industry conference that's
1234.16s: going on right now for medical devices. And the one company that is a supplier for medical devices
1240.72s: can be impacted by one of the outputs from that medical device conference. Like that, and that's
1246.48s: like a superficial example. It goes so much deeper than that to maintain obviously as accurate of a
1253.20s: model as we can. So that's the difference between forecast fall and implied fall forecast is doing
1261.76s: the work of trying to estimate what it is. Applied volatility is literally just extracting it out
1267.20s: from the market. So let's clear all this garbage off. And let's take a look at a quick recap for
1276.40s: episode three. Like I said, we're an episode four. So episode three and the reason why I don't
1281.36s: show you this before we do the quizzes because there's some answers in here like the first one.
1285.20s: Options are price-pike consensus. So this idea that we're using Black Sholes
1289.68s: Martin model to then actually figure out how to price an option is that's a theoretical concept.
1296.80s: It's not how it's done anymore. It's done by all of these different entities from
1302.56s: institutional side of things, figuring out what they think volatility should be priced at.
1307.84s: All of them are interacting in the same market together that then moves the needle towards whatever
1312.40s: market consensus is for what volatility is, thus what the price of an option is. We already
1319.52s: talked about that we need a volatility forecast. I think we actually spend a while on that one.
1324.16s: And we know that from a retail trading perspective, we derive implied volatility from the market.
1331.28s: So there's lots of different pricing models. Again, we understand them and use them from a theoretical
1336.40s: perspective, but from a practical application standpoint, none of it matters. Whatever is priced
1340.56s: in the market is probably what the options are worth. That's the idea. Cool. Solid recap. Now
1349.92s: we get into trader organization. Let me update our timestamps. So we're at 2240.
1362.16s: It's taking me forever to type this because it's like off to the side on the way that I'm sitting,
1376.16s: which is actually kind of funny. So let's talk about this. This idea of trader organization.
1381.52s: Now, as always, from a military learning style, we always start with TLOs, ELOs. You don't get ELOs
1388.64s: because I don't care about them. I care about TLOs. And this is the end state. At the end of this
1394.48s: session, you should be able to complete these two tasks. The first task is to create your own
1403.04s: millionaire roadmap, which we talked a little bit about in the planning section earlier on,
1407.20s: but we're going to touch on it again quickly. This is just the name for a plan. I literally just
1412.64s: call it that because it's a catchy name. It can be whatever number of dollars you want it to be.
1417.76s: This is what we studied in the skill development session last week is this idea of creating a broader
1425.76s: plan. Then the second thing you should be able to do by the end of the session is to be able to
1432.16s: begin creating your own trading plan and supporting trading log. So we're going to talk about those.
1440.24s: So the first thing, why do you care about this? Why are we talking about this thing? This isn't like
1446.48s: this sexy part of options trading that is really actually if you think about it, kind of the boring,
1452.72s: ugly part of options trading. This is why we talk about it. We talk about this because of
1460.40s: blue waffle 135 from three hours ago. I sold a cash secure put on Nvidia the day before it crashed
1468.40s: 20%. They sold a 135 cash secure put 30 days out for 200 out of 25 delta. Now the cash secure put
1475.28s: is at a unrealized loss of like 1500 bucks. How screwed am I? What do I do from here? This is exactly
1487.60s: why we plan to not be in this scenario. This is not a giant deal hopefully for them, but the reality
1497.92s: is for people, the vast majority of options traders, this is what they do. They just start putting
1506.64s: on trades and then they wonder why the shit doesn't work long term for them. So going off of
1516.00s: this concept, this is a post that I made that talks about some different stuff. I want to highlight
1530.56s: this, the third bullet point in here. The concept of this post and this will be in a newsletter
1537.12s: at some point. The concept of this post is what I consider to be some of the larger
1544.40s: failure points for options traders. So the reason why we talk about the failure points of
1548.80s: options traders is so that we understand what a lot of the common issues are so that we can do
1553.44s: something else. Because as we talk about with respect to trading, if you want to be successful
1559.92s: at this long term, you literally have to be a statistical outlier because the majority of people
1566.08s: don't do it. So we need to understand what they do and then not do that. So this is one of the things
1571.44s: that they do. They exhibit disgustingly common lack of planning. And we're going to talk about how
1578.00s: to create organized planning across this whole breadth of things. But the first reason why you care
1584.88s: about this is because this is what the majority of people do and this does not work. That's why.
1590.24s: The next reason why you care about this is because when we're trying to figure out how to trade
1598.88s: options, we're interacting with a very complex system. Markets are complex options are complex.
1605.84s: We as traders are complex. You have all of these different levels of complexity and all of these
1611.76s: different interfaces. There are a lot of variables. It is very difficult to confidently track and know
1620.72s: which ones matter and how much and how to manage them. So that's why I think this is worth your time.
1629.36s: So let's talk really quick about some common misconceptions and questions. I shot this out and I
1637.12s: got a few of these in. So I just threw them in here. At the end of these, you should have an answer
1641.04s: for every single one of these. How do I know what I need to track? I don't think I need a written
1645.04s: trading plan and I don't know how to make one. So we will cover all of those throughout the sessions.
1651.52s: If there's any other things during the session that you want to highlight or hit, please throw it in
1657.12s: the chat now. And I will add it to this. This is our guide post. Again, at the end of every single
1665.44s: time we meet for these Friday sessions, you should have answers to everything that's here and you
1669.84s: should be able to do what our TLO say you should be able to do. Otherwise, if that's not the case,
1674.48s: I massively failed you and I don't intend to do that.
1681.52s: So if there's anything else that you want to make sure that we learn that we discuss along the way
1686.32s: throw it in the chat, it'll get added to this list. Now, while you're doing that,
1691.04s: we'll start with over viewing the key documents as far as my mind is concerned.
1698.40s: And it's these three things. So on the very far left hand side, that's actually a screenshot of my
1706.32s: actual trading plan. And as you can see, it is really nothing special. The very top of it is just
1714.40s: this disgusting yellow text on white sheet of paper. There's nothing special about it. I'm highlighting
1721.92s: that point purposefully. What it looks like doesn't matter at all. Hey, that's what I tell myself
1728.80s: all the time. Makes me feel better. But this is actually true. Like what this looks like really
1734.48s: doesn't matter. What matters is what information you can extract from it. The second thing on this
1739.20s: list is the millionaire roadmap. So I'm throwing a link in the YouTube or in the chat right now
1746.24s: so that you can see that video, that video walks you through step by step literally how to create
1752.96s: your own path. Whatever that path is and what I mean by that is if we pop over to the website
1762.40s: last week, we talked about the money mindset exercise. And we talked about trying to find a way
1769.36s: to figure out how much money we need by what point in time in order to hit that financial
1776.08s: freedom threshold. So then we need to then plan for that. So then if I'm a trader starting with
1781.12s: $25,000, I'm saving $2500 a month because I'm a really I'm a real good saver. I got 20 years to go
1790.16s: using a standard market return of 10% that puts me at 1.8 million. Then we can figure out if that's
1796.08s: enough depending on how you intend to withdraw your money and stuff like that. You have to go through
1800.16s: this process for yourself to figure out what these numbers are. But what's important is this number,
1806.24s: this number, this number, and this number to start. Meaning what is your starting investible
1812.40s: principle? How much can you save? How much do you think you need in order to be financially free?
1820.16s: What time frame are you trying to do it in? And then we get to take a look at the rate of return
1825.60s: as we become traders. You don't get to change the rate of return upfront if you are a new trader.
1833.44s: You don't get to have this. It's the same thing is if I am a brand new basketball player and I step
1840.96s: on the court for my first basketball game, I don't get to say like I'm a drop 30 on their heads
1846.80s: right now. Well, we'll see how it goes, right? Not playing in that competitive level previously,
1853.68s: that maybe possible may not be possible. So I can have an idea of what I might want to do. But
1859.44s: the market return is a great planning factor. The reason why I emphasize this point so heavily
1865.04s: is because one of the most dangerous things traders do is they say to themselves, I'm a new trader,
1870.24s: I'm two weeks into this. If I'm going to bother learning to trade, it should be worth my time.
1875.44s: I determine it's worth my time if I'm able to make at least 30% per year.
1881.36s: Well, guess what? One, you would have a, oh, that's 310. I was going to say like that's,
1887.44s: that's a, that's a lot of money. You're still going to have a lot of money if you got that 30% per year.
1894.64s: But the point I'm making here is like, it doesn't matter what you think you deserve. No, literally
1901.04s: nobody fucking cares. What matters is what your skill is able to produce going back to the
1908.00s: basketball analogy. It doesn't matter if I walk on the court in my mind saying, I'm going to drop
1912.48s: 30 on their heads. And then I'm out there shooting like shack, right? There's a big disconnect.
1918.80s: It doesn't matter what the fuck I want. What matters is what I can do. So one of the big issues
1923.52s: new traders have is they set themselves up for these crazy ass initial returns. And then in order
1930.40s: to try to hit them, you have to place big trades. Not ready for big trades, probably as a brand
1937.84s: new trader. So that's the issue that typically opens up here. So that's the second thing you need
1944.72s: is that roadmap. And you need to have an understanding of where you're trying to land.
1948.64s: And then the third thing is a trade log. This is a screenshot of one of the trade logs that I've
1954.32s: been showing you guys for a while for the coverage strangles. And I actually have a video that's
1960.00s: coming out. Technically, it's coming out next week. Maybe we'll do it this week. What do you think?
1969.12s: I have a video about trading Bitcoin with options. And then I have a video about tracking your trades
1974.72s: like a pro building a trade log. I'll switch these really quick because I think it makes more sense
1980.56s: to do the trade log video this week. So that will go there. This will go here. So now there will be
1986.72s: a trade log video that's coming out on Sunday. And the trade log video is going to go through pretty
1993.44s: much all of this through. Well, not incredible through pretty significant detail, especially compared
2001.76s: to what most people are probably used to seeing. So these are the documents that we need.
2006.96s: Now, a common question is how do I start? How do I start making one? I'll show you. I'll show you
2021.76s: exactly how you start making one. What you do is you go to google.com or a word doc and you open up a
2033.04s: word doc. So this is a sample trade log template or trade plan template. All you need to do is start
2042.80s: writing words. You start writing words. You now have a trading plan. That's a work in process.
2050.88s: The reality as we build these trading plans and trading logs, they are iterative. That means they
2059.60s: are going to change continually. They continue to change. Right now, it's really difficult to see
2067.44s: because this is like tiny text. But right now, my trading plan is 415 pages. It continues to change,
2076.96s: adapt, grow. The thing to remember is I just wrapped up my 18th year of trading. I've been doing
2082.64s: this shift for a long fucking time. So that's why there's so much stuff in there. So now,
2088.32s: we have an idea of why this matters. It matters because most traders just start trading. It doesn't work
2097.92s: and then they don't know why. This is typically why. The key documents that we're going to use are a
2109.52s: plan and it's not really a document. This is like the guiding concept of what we're doing. Then we're
2115.04s: going to have a trading. I call it an investing plan because there's stuff in real estate and
2119.92s: shit in there too. It's not just trading, but call it whatever you want. You need a trading or
2124.00s: investing plan. And then you need a log. So let's talk about the relationship between these things
2131.52s: and why this is the order. I think it makes sense, which is something like this. One,
2138.72s: then two, and then three. So we start one with our goals. We create our goals by completing
2160.16s: something like the money mindset exercise that we did last Wednesday together on YouTube Live
2166.24s: together. And then we take the money mindset exercise and we feed that into our millionaire
2177.92s: road map. The millionaire road map then tells us we say, I want $2 million within 20 years
2193.76s: at a starting principle of 25k with savings of I don't know what the numbers are to work out to
2202.00s: 2 million. I'm just coming up with shit with savings of 1500 per month at a 12% return. Whatever
2212.16s: the standard market return is that you want to reference off of. We now have some very clear
2218.48s: details on what we need to build. We need to build something that can return this.
2225.84s: Provided that we can maintain this and provided that we're still okay with this.
2233.28s: This is why the money mindset exercise feeds into the millionaire road map because the money mindset
2241.20s: exercise tells us this. How much money do we think we need? And then the recommendation I
2248.08s: give to people is to have two numbers. The MVP and then target or goal. MVP is financial freedom.
2266.24s: The target is what you want, what you desire. So maybe our MVP instead of 2 million is actually
2274.64s: 1 million. The way to think about the MVP, this is where you at least for me, I want to take a
2285.12s: giant step back and say this is just how my fucking brain works. I'm not saying that this is the right
2288.88s: way for everybody. I'm just giving you the shit that I know that's all I can do. I'm not a professional
2293.20s: in any of the space, not like a fucking trading coach just talking to you about my experience.
2298.40s: And the MVP, the minimal viable product here, financial freedom, the way that I plan for this in
2306.72s: my mind was this is when I'm at my job. And if my job asks me to do something that I don't want to do,
2316.72s: I can say no. And I can say no comfortably. And then if they press me to do this thing that I might
2324.48s: not be comfortable with doing, then I can simply say no. And then deal with the consequence.
2331.12s: The point I'm highlighting there is to have control over yourself, like autonomy, the ability to
2339.52s: execute your life in the way that you want. Because when you need that job, because you have
2344.88s: family at home, because maybe it's during COVID, it's a tough job market. So your boss is asking you
2351.12s: to do something that you don't really want to do, but you're like, fuck, I have kids that I have to
2356.16s: take care of. I have a wife who's not working right now because she's staying at home with the kids
2360.00s: or whatever. And the job market's really bad. So it's not like I have a bunch of other things I
2365.20s: can pivot to. The boss has asked me to do something that I really don't want to do for whatever reason.
2369.84s: And I'm just going to say yes, because it's safer for me to keep my job. Now there's varying
2377.12s: degrees of that, right? And I just want to be clear, you have to figure out what what the line is
2382.24s: for you, right? Like if your boss asks you to do something that just like mildly irritates you
2386.40s: because it's annoying, well, get over it, bitch. Like that doesn't matter that much. But if it's
2392.00s: stuff that like you dread going to work, it's soul sucking. Think of what a terrible way to live
2400.08s: the bulk of your life on a day to day basis doing something that's fucking soul sucking that you
2405.92s: don't want to do. But you're doing it because of these obligations because you're a good person
2410.08s: that's delivering on these obligations. But I'm here to happily tell you there's a better fucking way.
2415.28s: You don't have to do the soul sucking thing forever if you plan out this shit.
2420.00s: So MVP minimal viable product that's really from the tech world. This is when we initially
2429.12s: crossed the threshold of being able to have true autonomy over ourselves. We should still continue
2437.60s: working. We should still continue working. But if there's some big moral thing that you just
2445.28s: don't agree with and you're still planning on going to find another job, but you can stand on your
2453.20s: morals in the current job and accept the consequences, that's financial freedom.
2459.92s: Then the target is being able to do kind of the cool shit that you like. A great example of MVP
2468.08s: versus target desire MVP. Like I talked about being able to say no at work to something you don't
2473.84s: want to do. Target desire is you want to travel six times a year every time you travel, you
2479.92s: prefer to fly first class. I sure do. It's way more comfortable. That's super expensive. And in
2485.36s: general, first class is probably one of the worst possible uses of money beyond the comfort that
2491.28s: it provides. So that comfort is at a true premium. You can still travel. You can still travel six
2497.44s: times throughout the year. But if you add the requirement of wanting to travel more comfortably,
2502.00s: because that matters to you, that's a desire. You don't really need that. You can still travel
2507.20s: without it. But I can tell you, and equivically, it's so much fucking better with it. It's so much better.
2515.44s: And it's not because like the free drinks and booze and stuff like the seats being a little bit
2520.00s: bigger is nice. That's a big thing. But it's also the you don't have to like worry about the
2525.84s: fucking overhead bin space. That's one of the most annoying things because both both my wife and I
2531.52s: unless we're going on like a dive trip, we just carry a backpack. We don't do check bags because
2537.60s: you don't need that much shit for the vast majority of stuff. And to like have to worry about
2543.60s: if there's going to be enough overhead bin space like fuck that. I literally will walk on the plane
2549.52s: last because I get to stay out of the plane longer. And then I know there's going to be overhead
2554.96s: bin space for me. Like it's a little shit like that. But again, the point I'm highlighting is it's
2560.24s: still entirely possible to travel just fine. And worry about the overhead bin space, but you can
2564.72s: make it happen. This is the difference between a target desire level metric to account for things
2572.64s: like that that you figure out from the money mindset exercise and MVP is simply when you have your
2579.20s: financial freedom. So that's the goal setting section. Now that goal setting section as we talked
2586.96s: about gives us some really important takeaways. So one of those takeaways is this return over here.
2598.16s: We know what we need to hit. Okay, great. Now we have a planning factor. So then where does the
2603.52s: trading plan come in? So step one to reiterate is goals that are quantified. Step two now is creating
2611.20s: a plan. The purpose of the plan is to figure out this is going to blow your mind. Figure out a
2620.88s: fucking plan to hit that 12% metric. Or that's the example that we have from the goals was 12%
2628.48s: is whatever it is that you think is possible and whatever you're targeting. And guess what? As
2633.76s: you're going through your plan, you might realize that this is doable or this is not doable for you.
2639.12s: Or you might realize as you're trying to build what this might look like, the way that you
2644.08s: thought you were going to do it might not work. That's the point of the plan. So now let's talk about
2651.84s: the key sections of this plan.
2660.72s: Where is oh hold on a second. Perfect. So
2668.80s: the first section of the plan and you'll see in the template that I have this is something I
2677.84s: use somewhere else, but for the plan itself, we're going to have some key sections. We're going to
2683.68s: capture our goals that are quantified. We're going to include the millionaire roadmap
2690.80s: So that we have a clear target of what we're shooting at. Then what I like to have is kind of a
2701.92s: portfolio management section. This is going to include my risk tolerance. Beyond portfolio management
2715.36s: section, this is when we get into the actual tools. So that will be stuff like profit mechanisms.
2721.20s: This will be stuff like analysis.
2736.72s: I personally have sections for market function.
2742.24s: We'll market history in function.
2751.76s: In a practical sense, I don't think you need this. I'm just letting you know, like that's actually
2755.60s: why you see this. So this is talking about market execution, what open outcry was, how electronic
2762.08s: exchanges grew and all that kind of stuff. I have an obsessive personality. When I am interested in
2770.16s: something, I learn everything about it. So that's why this shit's in there. You don't need this.
2776.64s: Then after this, we have strategy outlines.
2781.60s: And then after strategy outlines, we should have some sort of AAR process.
2800.88s: AAR is after action review. This is another military term, but this is when after we conduct
2815.04s: in operation, we conduct a mission, we look back over and we say, how did it go? So we need to have
2820.56s: an AAR process to do that literally for our performance. Then RFIs requests for information.
2827.68s: These are ideas that you have on things that you want to try to iterate on. Maybe I want to
2834.00s: explore doing a 30 delta short put versus the 40 delta short put. And you can take notes on this
2841.60s: stuff. The reason why those notes are important is because when you do this for a long time,
2847.12s: after a while, you'll start to have questions like, have I tried this before? And you will be able
2854.32s: to answer questions like that to be way more efficient with your time. Now within strategy outlines,
2865.60s: this is a standard format that I use.
2868.56s: Execs summary, set up, management, cracking, RFIs.
2886.16s: How are we doing so far? These are the elements literally of a trading plan.
2904.40s: We can look at how to build this together. That's the goal. So let me grab, I'm literally going to
2912.24s: open up a blank word doc. I'm literally going to straight up do this shit with you.
2921.60s: What do we want to do? Here's fine. We'll just do a blank Google doc.
2931.44s: We can all agree that this is about as blank as a Google doc can be. There's nothing in here.
2936.40s: Oh, that's actually kind of cool with the tab stuff now. Here's literally, and I'm not
2945.68s: kidding. If you don't have one, I literally would love for you to just do this with me right now.
2952.24s: You can start it right now with me. So let's essentially take what we captured over here and put
2964.32s: it into our log. So the log title, trading plan, whatever you want it to be. Now, for me, in mine,
2981.76s: we're going to have a handful of sections. So what I'll do is I'll use a couple heading sections.
2990.32s: We'll start with the title of the doc. The title doc will just be investing plan or trading plan
2996.24s: whatever you want. And then again, for me, I typically have a quote. The reason why I have the
3006.88s: quote is it's just a reminder for when I click into this. There's a few of them. So the first one is
3020.88s: that's something my mentor used to say to me when I used to have different feelings about trying
3026.00s: to make a bunch of money. You used to say to me, money can't buy a hot happiness, poverty can't buy
3031.52s: shit. So the lesson behind that is money is an amplifier to your life. It can help a lot of things.
3041.52s: But if you as a human being or a nasty, ugly human being, not in terms of your looks, obviously,
3046.80s: in terms of your character and personality, money ain't going to fix it. If you're a good person that
3051.60s: has a beautiful human being, like in totality, money is just an amplifier. So that's the first thing.
3060.16s: The second thing is this.
3072.48s: Financial freedom enables true freedom and expression. The reason why I put this
3076.72s: in here is because it reminds me not just that making money is for the sake of making money to go
3083.28s: buy cool shit. It's that money literally allows you to be unabashedly yourself, period.
3098.32s: Whatever that is, hopefully it's a good person, but it allows you to be exactly what you want to be,
3104.96s: who you want to be. You do not have to tip toe through the tulips with people to make them think
3111.84s: that they like you to try to get a promotion. You get to be yourself. If there's some sort of
3117.68s: cause that you really care about, but you're concerned what your workplace might think about you,
3123.92s: if your workplace has a different disposition than your disposition, and you don't want to
3129.76s: apply to this cause or help this cause because of that, that sucks. So that's the idea here.
3136.16s: So now you literally have the first section of your trading plan. Now let's get some headings in
3141.68s: here for these other sections. We need goals, not foals, we need goals.
3150.24s: And the reason why typing is hard is because the keyboard's like off to the side here.
3154.72s: Millionaire roadmap can go in here.
3166.56s: We need portfolio management.
3172.56s: We need profit mechanisms.
3180.32s: We need analysis tools.
3185.28s: If you're a nerd, you can have stuff here for like market functions,
3195.36s: and history. And then we have strategy outlines.
3200.48s: And then we have a our process.
3217.36s: And then I normally will have RFIs near the top, or I will have them in like a separate
3227.84s: word, Docker notepad. I don't keep them necessarily in the plan because I don't crack up in the
3231.92s: plan every single day. Now why did I use headings? I used headings because it puts them over here
3242.56s: so that as your document becomes 400 plus pages, you can click at them and it'll just take you
3249.04s: to where you're trying to go. One of the things you'll notice about the way that I do things is
3254.72s: with an obsession over efficiency. And it's something that you learn over time. You don't have to
3261.52s: get bogged down on those details early on. But there is a reason why I do most things the way I do
3269.52s: most things. And I'm just giving you the the cliff notes version why it's like this.
3276.24s: So now we have literally the start of a trading plan. You just started a trading plan.
3285.12s: We now need to figure out and fill in these key sections. So for our goals, I'm not going to fill
3292.88s: in all of them. It's going to take too long. But essentially we know that we want to have 12%
3299.84s: target. We already have the details from our millionaire roadmap. You could take a screenshot,
3304.32s: drop it in there, whatever makes you happy portfolio management. There's a couple key sections here.
3310.24s: The very first thing we need is risk tolerance. So this means of your total portfolio,
3319.84s: how much of it are you willing to not see anymore in pursuit of this? The way that I explain this
3331.04s: to people is we have to take risk in order to get to a reward, this reward. In the military,
3340.96s: we use a process in ORM process, operational risk management. What that does is it make sure that
3349.68s: I'm not taking unnecessary risks or stupid risks that don't have a commensurate reward associated
3358.08s: with them. So here's an example. Let's say that in my initial thought for my risk tolerance,
3365.68s: I'm like, I'm okay with a 50% drawdown. Maybe I think that genuinely. And that's my initial idea.
3373.84s: Well, let's take a look and see if that's actually the case. And I'll show you how we can do this.
3383.92s: There's two things that matter to us here. The first thing is let's go back to this. We can get rid
3393.68s: of all that stuff. Let's go back to this. We had our scenario where we had like $2,500 or $25,000.
3403.84s: I think we were saving $2,500 per month. We had a 20 year runway. Yeah, so this is where we were.
3412.00s: So I say, I'm okay with a 50% drawdown. So let's see if I'm okay with a 50% drawdown.
3420.00s: Right now, it would take me 20 years to get to 1.8 million. If I click into this, it's 20 years
3428.48s: to get to 1.8 million. So am I okay with a 50% drawdown with a small account? Of course. Why not?
3437.76s: A small account is going to be completely, completely dependent on these savings. Now,
3444.80s: let me show you another example though to help you understand this broader point. That's why you
3450.64s: have to look at the numbers because the numbers matter a lot. Let's say I'm saving no money.
3458.56s: And then I do the same thing. I cut the account in half. We go to 12.5. 20 years, I'd have 168K.
3467.04s: In 20 years, I have 84. So for a small account, if you are aggressively saving,
3475.84s: you can get away with more of a drawdown. That drawdown becomes a bigger problem as your account
3483.28s: gets bigger because then the incremental saving contributions don't matter as much if you have
3490.88s: a big portfolio. So let's say you have a $500,000 portfolio. You have a mid-size portfolio.
3500.24s: Let's say that you're not saving any money at this. Well, let's actually say you are saving.
3505.60s: Let's say you're saving $1,000 a month. Notice the difference here. So for $500,000,
3512.80s: $500,000 account saving $1,000 a month, 20 years, you have 3.3 million. If I add this, you have 4.1.
3519.36s: Still a big change. But in the other scenario, the change obviously was multiples of the initial
3527.20s: amount. So this incremental saving doesn't help you as much. So now let's cut this $500,000 account
3535.04s: in half, maintaining the savings. 20 years, 4 million, 20 years, 2 million. Do you see the point?
3543.04s: The point I'm making is that with a small account, your savings matter more. With a bigger account,
3550.88s: or as soon as your savings comprise a smaller percentage of the total account value,
3556.16s: the drawdown matters a lot. So now in that same time frame, I have half the money. Probably not what I
3564.08s: want. So then going back to this trading plan idea, this is how we actually assess our risk tolerance.
3571.44s: It's not just a random number. It's not just sitting there thinking like, oh yeah,
3574.88s: fuck, what would I, you know, it would suck to see the portfolio at whatever. That's not it at all.
3580.80s: It's seeing how different drawdowns impact your actual trajectory and your broader plan.
3587.92s: I'm going to pop the door for Thor.
3602.16s: Mel is at the gym right now. So I suspect he will be back in several moments when he realized that
3606.88s: she's not there to feed him dinner. LOL. Does this part make sense so far? The risk tolerance.
3615.12s: Then from there, I split my portfolio for allocation speculative allocates.
3623.04s: And then based on your strategies, you have to figure out how much each of these could potentially
3629.68s: make in the beginning. You don't have to worry about any of that. You need to figure out your risk
3633.68s: tolerance and you need to figure out a portfolio circuit breaker. This essentially is the point where
3643.36s: let's say you decide that your risk tolerance is going to be a 30% drawdown.
3648.08s: Your portfolio circuit breaker is going to kick on at like 25%. If your entire portfolio value is
3654.48s: down 25% in proximity to your total risk tolerance, the portfolio circuit breaker is designed to get
3661.20s: you to go in there and start cutting fucking trades before you get to your risk tolerance threshold.
3667.76s: This is how we stop catastrophic drawdowns of accounts. Then you can go into broader portfolio
3674.16s: utilization rules and shit like that. Profit mechanisms. I have a video that talks about this. We're
3680.08s: not going to dive into the detail on profit mechanisms here.
3692.24s: Here are that's one video about profit mechanisms. Guess who's back at the door? I fucking told you.
3701.20s: So funny. It's almost like I know this dog. Here's the second video
3706.64s: that talks about creating a strategy. But profit mechanisms are the things that you expect to make money from.
3718.48s: You can back in real quick. So this can be something like
3738.40s: beta drift. So this can be like a large cap. And I would define it. So beta drift in this context would
3746.16s: be propensity for large cap box, you steadily grow over time in expanding economy.
3759.36s: And then what I would do is I would list research.
3767.76s: Where do you find the research? Great question from SSRN. That's the starting point.
3773.12s: Another great example here is momentum. This is well documented.
3778.64s: In so on and so forth. I would list out the different profit mechanisms I'm intending to trade.
3784.16s: The analysis tools I would break this out.
3792.16s: To be guiding concepts.
3797.92s: Then I would break it out into technical.
3810.64s: And probably spell technical. Right. That would be good. And then fundamental.
3816.64s: Analysis. And then I would also add things like
3827.76s: market analysis process. Economic or economy analysis process. And realistically,
3839.76s: these would be switched for me. You could even see as I'm filling it in like shit moves, right. And
3846.88s: these would be literally a list of analysis tools. Then market function and history. This is just
3857.12s: that optional note stuff. And then strategy outlines. Let's do one example of this. So we can have
3863.92s: and here's where I would actually use subheadings so that they'll pop up underneath here. So maybe we have
3869.60s: a coverage triangle. And then within the coverage triangle, we already know the sections we're supposed to have.
3878.32s: And executive summary. We need to set up. We need a management.
3894.64s: Lauren says are there better strategies for smaller accounts? Well, as you know,
3899.52s: better is relative. But I actually just put a video out not too long ago about trading options
3903.68s: with like a $5,000 account. Here's that that video for you. Learn there.
3913.20s: Management. We need a.
3918.24s: AR process. And then we need RFIs. Now I want to linger on the strategy outline specifically.
3930.32s: The reason why I want to linger on this is because this is where the trade log gets introduced
3936.64s: because the executive summary for a strategy. And for those that don't know, I have a video
3944.32s: that talks about trading plans in depth like pretty far in depth here. So you can check that
3951.44s: video out whenever you want. It'll go through all this more in detail. The goal for this video
3955.84s: is to be way more practical and talk about literally starting your own like this with me right now.
3960.72s: So the executive summary, this is literally just a proof of concept. You should be able to summarize
3966.00s: what the fuck this thing is supposed to do. This strategy is supposed to do in like two sentences.
3971.28s: If you can't do that, it means you don't know what this thing is. So this is just a proof of
3976.80s: concept to make sure that you know what this thing should be doing. So for example, the coverage
3982.40s: triangle in this context could be designed to capture market beta or leveraged
3995.52s: market beta and amplify returns using short options, calls and puts.
4009.52s: Done.
4010.48s: Done.
4011.44s: Set up. There will be different sections in here. So the first section, subsection, and again,
4020.16s: this will be whatever you want it to be. It will take shape over time. But think about, literally
4025.68s: think about just the process of putting a trade on in the shit that you need to do in order to
4030.88s: put on a trade. So the first thing is you need to know the structure that you're going to use.
4037.60s: You need to know the profit mechanism that you're trying to capture. You then need to know the
4043.68s: product universe or the security universe, the things that you might trade. You need to know
4053.92s: things like how you plan to set money aside for the strategy
4061.44s: and so on and so forth. Then management is exactly what it sounds like. It's talking about how
4071.12s: are you going to actually manage the trade after action review is what are you going to look at
4079.44s: to see how you performed. So now this starts looking like details that are important for a trade
4086.64s: log. So if we take a quick pause and we take a look at a trade log, this is again just like a
4093.28s: sample trade log. There's a video that's coming out Sunday that will go through all this way
4097.28s: more in detail. But we can take a look at a strategy, for example, in a trade log here.
4105.68s: And this is for what a coverage triangle. So this is like an old coverage triangle tracker
4111.12s: for this was just an example. And when I'm thinking about how to build something to actually track,
4120.88s: I need to start with the details that simply matter to the strategy. So think of it. What matters
4129.20s: to the profit mechanism? Well, the first thing that matters is the ability to assess or track
4135.04s: if there's drift. So I'm going to list out the metrics that are important.
4143.92s: Metrics that are important to strategy success. One of those
4155.60s: underlying price movement, that's a big one. You can then go through and think if you were to
4162.88s: click the button to enter a trade, what are the things you would look at?
4169.04s: Things that I would look at are like I would look at the ticker. I would look at expiration. I would
4175.52s: look at strike. Delta premium, so on and so forth. This is literally how you decide what should go
4188.96s: into a trade log. Notice how all of this is beautifully aligned with your initial goal set.
4198.40s: Your initial goal set is to make 12%. We have a portfolio that we're going to try to control risk
4204.72s: in pursuit of the 12%. We're first going to start with whatever our comfort levels are in
4209.52s: terms of drawdowns, but then we're going to see if that actually can work based on what kind of
4214.88s: profit mechanisms we understand. We're going to try to trade. Then as we look at the individual
4220.64s: strategies that we're going to try to trade, we start to have a sense of how much money we need to
4225.92s: use. How does the underlying typically move in whatever the kind of strategy is that you're trying
4233.28s: to trade? And then what metrics are important to include in a trade log so that you can analyze
4239.76s: the performance of what you're doing? This is it. This is exactly what I think
4250.00s: traders should do to create a unified plan. Starts with goals. It goes into a trade plan to
4259.04s: outline your ideas. Then we figure out of those ideas, we figure out what strategies we think we
4267.28s: might want to trade and then we start looking at a trade log. Now as we're trying to figure out a key
4272.96s: question, how do we get to this 12%? Well, that's going to be based on what's in here. What are your
4281.04s: strategies? What do you do? And based on what's here, that's going to tell you how much money you
4287.92s: might need to use at a given point in time in order to prospectively be able to hit that 12% return.
4294.08s: So for example, the coverage triangle is designed to capture market beta. Just standard market
4298.40s: directional movements. We can amplify it with some leverage if we trade a leveraged ticker associated
4303.44s: with it. I tend towards ETFs personally. So if the market has a down year, guess what that means
4310.00s: for the coverage triangle? It means it's not performing well. Now the coverage triangle will still
4315.04s: perform better than just buy and hold in the market, but that doesn't mean it's going to give me
4319.76s: this in a down year. So now I have an RFI. One of my questions I'm going to have to solve for at some
4327.92s: point is how does this fit into my portfolio utilization during market down years?
4344.64s: Now I have a question. I need to go think about and try to solve for
4350.64s: someone and so forth. Now the AR process, I think I have, I don't know if I have videos, I'm pretty
4358.96s: sure I have videos. We probably did it on a live stream. The AR process is like a review process.
4372.00s: So what I do is I have a weekly, monthly, an annual review process. And in this AR process,
4383.60s: I literally just outline the steps that matter to me for the review process. So the first step is
4392.08s: portfolio, you know, track market, you know, for an assessment between the two,
4408.56s: track strategialization, so on and so forth. So the AR process, I outline it so that it's not
4419.52s: a unique unicorn every single time I do it. And the thing that you'll notice is that, and this is
4426.40s: why I talk about the process of trading and the process of building things on the back end to support
4440.64s: what we're trying to do as a trader. If you build the back end process, the function of actually
4449.44s: trading literally is easy because all of the work is done here. So then when we go back to that
4456.72s: other example from Reddit of this person, guess what? If we have a plan, we already know the
4468.00s: fucking answer to this. There is no go to Reddit and look for help on what to do. We've thought through
4474.00s: this because this is part of the plan. We're talking about up here, the management, the management
4482.24s: cycle for a trade includes how risk management approach profit management approach.
4497.60s: Time management approach and so on.
4505.68s: This is it. If you followed along and you did some of this work with me, congratulations. You
4511.92s: literally just started your very own trading plan. And that literally is huge. It might sound
4518.80s: insignificant, but that's a huge step in starting to build something that's logical, scalable,
4526.48s: that's not based on randomness. That's actually purely decisions that are made on information,
4535.52s: not pure randomness based on what you happen to feel at a given point in time.
4549.52s: Any questions on this idea about trade or organization,
4558.16s: goal setting, trading plans, trading logs, anything like that?
4571.04s: The key takeaway from this is the most important part of this is starting.
4579.28s: And if you start the process, it's iterative. Don't get overwhelmed, not knowing what to track.
4590.00s: What happens to a lot of people is they don't know what to track, or they say they don't know what to
4595.44s: track. So then they just don't track. That's a bad answer. The way that we figure out what to
4604.16s: track is trying to logically think through the inputs that we use when we're making a trade decision.
4613.76s: And then creating areas for us to track those inputs. So then we can see if it's something that's
4621.52s: relevant, that matters, if it's something that doesn't matter. And 54 says, make sense, we're all
4630.72s: running blinds. Yeah, the vast majority of people do. The vast majority of people literally
4635.36s: just start trading. They somehow hope that it's magically going to work out. And it's fucking crazy.
4641.20s: It's literally the dumbest thing on earth. And I'm not calling other people dumb because guess what?
4646.64s: I'm the same fucking idiot. I did the same shit. We all do it. And it's because we're all grossly
4653.28s: misled at the onset of what this whole trading thing is going to look like. But yeah, it's
4659.76s: these kinds of things. Once you see them and you understand them, it's kind of like,
4665.12s: fuck, kind of makes sense. It's actually kind of silly to not do this. The equivalent of not
4670.88s: tracking these kinds of things is it's like, imagine you're a stock holder. You hold Apple.
4680.80s: And then you get on the earnings call and then they ask, hey, Apple, how did they, how do you guys do?
4689.44s: Last quarter. And Apple just goes, well, you know, I'm not too sure. It felt like it was pretty good.
4696.08s: We had some some pretty good ideas. We tried some of them. I think the the new iPhone might have
4705.60s: get rid of this, this damn extra camera button that nobody likes. I think maybe we could do that.
4713.92s: Not really sure. And then somebody's like, well, got it. So how many phones did you sell?
4720.08s: I don't really know. Oh, curious. How many, how many computers did you sell?
4727.52s: Not too sure. Maybe like a thousand, two thousand, five thousand. Not positive. How much did
4732.00s: you sell them for? Well, it kind of depends on where I sold them. Right. You see the point.
4738.32s: Like, imagine a business trying to do what we do as traders and again, trading at a professional level.
4746.96s: It's a fucking business. Now, the thing that I will always remind you, the beauty of all of this
4756.24s: is that the reason why the opportunity exists as it does is because most people don't
4768.08s: do this stuff. So it means that it literally is not overwhelmed with
4775.04s: uns of people that are in here with, you know, all different kinds of ideas trying to extract
4781.52s: all kinds of market opportunities. Most of them can't even get to the market opportunities.
4789.76s: They can't get out of their own way. And that's not me wishing that on anybody. It really isn't.
4795.44s: If anybody knows what I'm about, I mean, shit, I'm sitting here on Friday night talking about
4800.80s: shit that I've known for nearly two decades. Literally, that's not me. The my hope genuinely is to
4808.88s: try to help other people avoid this really silly, unnecessary path that the majority of people take.
4817.92s: That's my hope. So that is my TED talk. That's what we have for trade or organization.
4829.04s: You now know how to create a millionaire roadmap. You understand and you started to create your own
4837.28s: trading plan. And you're able now to create your own supporting trade log based on the inputs we
4845.52s: talked about. You need to capture by outlining what matters to the individual strategies.
4851.60s: And then there's a video coming out on Sunday that's going to go into trade plan. I'm sorry,
4856.56s: trade logs in detail. So you can tune in for that one so that then you can figure out over the next
4864.72s: couple days. What kind of strategies you run, what kind of metrics are relevant to that strategy.
4870.96s: And then spend today and tomorrow brainstorming on that writing that out. And then as you're
4875.76s: sitting there saying, well, I don't know how to fucking do this trade log thing. Then boom, Sunday,
4880.16s: the light will shine down through the clouds. And there will be a video for you about building a
4887.12s: trade log. And the video, let's see, the video's 25 minutes long. As we all know, it's pretty,
4897.04s: you boy, you boy goes a little deep sometimes, but you know, just kind of what it is.
4907.28s: Cool. That wraps us up for this. If there's any just general Q&A, anything from a beginner level
4915.12s: perspective that you want to talk about now is literally the perfect time to bring that up. We
4919.44s: can cover literally whatever you want. And while we're doing this, I'm actually going to do a little
4925.68s: bit of homework, which my homework is to update our recap what we talked about. I like to do it
4932.48s: right after we talk about it so that it is the freshest in my mind. And as you can tell, what we're
4938.96s: going to do is have a list of these so that they will all be in the same spot forever. So we'll be
4947.28s: able to look at all pretty quickly together. So what questions do we have? Like I said, anything,
4956.00s: it doesn't have to be related to what we just talked about. Anything from a beginner level is
4961.12s: totally cool. So this was.
4964.48s: I was.
4967.44s: Creator organization. This was what option pricing.
4973.76s: This was.
4977.68s: Buying versus selling. This was one on one recap.
4983.76s: So now what we learned. We figured out how to create our own. Oh no.
5002.80s: Millionaire road mapping process.
5004.80s: Yes.
5008.80s: Creation of trading.
5012.16s: Land outline and key sections.
5025.68s: And then we talked about determining.
5035.04s: Determining the key metrics.
5041.52s: Jesus.
5043.60s: You track.
5045.84s: From the plan in a trade log.
5055.76s: That will be our recap for the next one.
5060.80s: I think we can kill this thing.
5065.28s: Let's see.
5071.28s: Tommy says your thoughts on Elon saying there's a path for Tesla to being 20 trillion
5075.84s: company at an earnings call. I mean, I don't disagree with them. I think like.
5083.12s: I think objectively there is what we would consider like a path. I think that that's a
5089.84s: a fair statement overall. I just think it's a little bit of a.
5095.68s: A little bit of a reach.
5097.60s: But it doesn't surprise me.
5099.60s: You know, to see.
5101.12s: To see him say something like that, especially with the total potential impact.
5106.40s: That Tesla might be able to have longer term.
5109.52s: And depending on how it evolves, because that's the other reality.
5112.88s: Is that Tesla is probably going to evolve significantly.
5118.16s: As the rest of the market evolves.
5120.24s: So yeah, I mean, I think it's a little.
5125.60s: I think it's a little dramatic, but also for a kind of guy like he, you kind of accept
5131.60s: that that's how he's going to.
5133.84s: It's always going to talk. That's what he's going to be about.
5138.56s: But I mean, Tesla as a company has looked a little bit rough, I think.
5144.40s: The volatility in it has not been very good. Yeah.
5148.40s: Actually fell down below this.
5150.24s: Funny enough.
5154.96s: Decent earnings though.
5157.04s: Brandon says, well, I'm learning options.
5159.44s: So we should track every trade made when DCA and uptrend.
5164.48s: And right down the reason why I bought it.
5171.68s: Well, it depends on what you're trying to track.
5176.88s: Right. So like if you're doing like a long-term investment,
5181.52s: there's not really a whole lot to track in terms of rationale provided that the rationale remains
5187.28s: the same. Now, if it were me, what I would do is I absolutely would know when I chose to buy in.
5194.80s: But if you're buying in on a regular scheduled dollar cost average cadence,
5200.48s: then you already know the reason I wouldn't necessarily log that specifically.
5204.64s: I would have a note in the log that says standard entry is blank date with blank amount of money.
5212.32s: And then if there's a deviation off of that for some reason, I would absolutely track that.
5218.24s: The other thing I would track for that kind of position is whatever frequency you analyze the
5226.56s: position, meaning if you look at it on a quarterly basis and you're like, do I like this position
5233.60s: still do I not like this position? And how do you determine how you like the position? I would track
5239.36s: that. So let's say for the last quarter, you track things like again, if it's a dollar cost
5243.36s: averaging position, I'm assuming something slightly longer term. So something I would track are the
5247.84s: earnings. I would say what was EPS? What was the reaction? What was the movement over the last
5253.76s: earnings? And again, you can come up with some pretty good trade ideas based on that. You can
5258.40s: start to get a sense of your different holdings, which are performing best over on a quarter by quarter
5264.72s: basis. And is there a relationship to what the earnings report is? And then that can really inform
5270.24s: how you funnel your money going forward. So yeah, I the thing is is it stuff like this is whatever
5278.72s: we want it to be. But what I can tell you is that if we're trying to make as much money as we
5284.48s: possibly can, we have to think of it from that lens of how can I make as much money as I possibly
5292.64s: can from this. And there's a process that we can logically follow to do that. It does require
5301.76s: some effort though. And that's that's the I think that's the rub for most people is that once we
5309.92s: start looking at that effort side of things, it starts to look real, starts to look real sketchy,
5314.88s: real ugly. Is it worth? Sweet. All right, gang. Looks like we got no more questions. That's all I
5324.48s: got for you. If you need anything, you guys always know you can hit me up. Happy to help. However,
5329.36s: best I can be an outlier. We'll see you all later.
