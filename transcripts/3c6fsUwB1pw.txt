330.00s:  you
360.00s:  you
362.00s:  you
390.00s:  Yeah, they'll spoil in different ways.
393.00s:  Lauren says, past for future,
394.96s:  verse future, that's not it.
397.52s:  We talked about this last time.
400.96s:  So think of it this way.
406.00s:  We know that implied volatility is derived from the market, right?
413.64s:  So then where does implied volatility come from?
419.64s:  How do we figure out what to put into the market for us
425.12s:  therefore then henceforth unto forever known be able to price?
432.16s:  Kind of a carried away with those fun words.
435.68s:  The question here though is where does IV come from?
438.64s:  We know that it's derived from the market,
440.32s:  so that means somebody has to input what we think implied volatility is.
446.08s:  So where does that input come from?
449.60s:  Dejean, Dejean is the closest so far by far the closest.
455.36s:  Dejean says different pricing models, that's the closest.
463.68s:  Re says best guess based on standard deviation.
466.64s:  Travel Ursula says historical, Raphael says volatility.
469.92s:  Nice job Raphael, glad to see that you're jumping in and getting right into the mix.
474.56s:  We know we're talking about volatility.
476.56s:  So right on.
478.32s:  Okay.
480.40s:  This is a really important point.
482.72s:  We're going to talk about this more, but in oh shit, stop that.
487.04s:  I try to use my pen and it like hung onto the little drawing pad one sec.
491.52s:  Let's get us resented here.
493.60s:  Cool.
495.20s:  I actually fully expected this, which is why this is a quiz question.
498.96s:  Because this concept is actually very important.
502.16s:  And we talked about it last time, but Lawrence says BSM that is incorrect.
507.36s:  It's a good guess.
508.88s:  Actually believe it or not, BSM is how we get this.
515.44s:  So if we think about, well, we can answer number two while we answer number one.
519.92s:  So first answer number two for me.
522.40s:  What is the one unknown input into a pricing model?
526.88s:  What's that guess?
528.40s:  Mark says extrinsic value, that's not it.
531.60s:  Good guess.
533.04s:  Travel says we obviously missed it last time definitely.
536.08s:  And the reason why I think people miss it is because it's a really subtle detail.
540.00s:  That's easy to skip over, but it's an important one.
544.32s:  Okay, beautiful.
545.44s:  So Reese says, ball, good.
548.24s:  Lauren says IV, which is actually more correct because for Reese's answer,
552.72s:  and I know you're just typing quick, but
555.28s:  ball can be different kinds of things.
557.12s:  So Dejon and travel same comment to you guys.
560.24s:  Vol is not wrong, but when we're talking, when we're in like a basic setting,
564.96s:  where we're working on getting the fundamentals down,
568.00s:  this is where I try to make sure that we're using the correct language instead of common
572.96s:  parlance, right? So you guys saying volatility, I understand what you mean.
576.88s:  You mean implied volatility?
579.04s:  That's just in common parlance.
581.04s:  But the reality is there are lots of different kinds of volatility.
584.08s:  There's realized volatility, future realized volatility, historic volatility.
589.44s:  There's a lot of different kinds of vol.
591.68s:  So we, in this context, the one unknown input to a pricing model would not be something like
600.16s:  historic vol, realize of all, the one unknown input would be forecast.
608.24s:  And the other acceptable answer is implied volatility.
612.56s:  So,
613.68s:  forward looking, that's the key takeaway here is we're talking about forward looking volatility.
621.36s:  So now, how does IV differ from forecast?
626.56s:  Really simple.
629.92s:  Think of it this way. You go to weather.com and you see that it's going to be 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
638.24s:  I guess I could just put a degrees.
641.76s:  It's going to be 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
645.20s:  You found that it's going to be 50 degrees Fahrenheit by going to a website and seeing what
651.36s:  somebody else figured out based on whatever tools they have, the weather people, which they're
657.04s:  not always super accurate. So who knows what fucking tools they have.
659.52s:  Maybe they just do the rock outside the window thing.
662.56s:  But joking aside, you going to weather.com is essentially the same as getting implied volatility.
670.40s:  We're going into the options market and then we're just isolating all of the knowns versus
676.16s:  the unknown inputs into the pricing model. And we're saying what's the remaining number?
681.44s:  It's a differential equation. So we just solve for the implied volatility component.
686.08s:  That's where this number comes from.
688.24s:  Forecast is akin to the weather man or woman. I am completely gender neutral when it comes to
695.68s:  weather people, weather persons. And the weather, the weather people, they need to go out and they
703.04s:  need to look at their barometers. They might step outside and see if their head gets wet.
712.16s:  The joking aside, what I'm talking about is the weather person is actually doing some sort of
719.44s:  research to see what they think the temperature for tomorrow is supposed to be.
727.84s:  So they're the ones that are forecasting. They're using different tools to create a forecast.
734.72s:  And then they're putting it onto a website that you get to go look at.
738.40s:  Okay, so now let's look at this in options context.
743.04s:  Forecast IV or I'm sorry, forecast ball is typically done by all different kinds of volatility
757.76s:  pricing models.
759.44s:  These are all of your different kind of garches,
771.44s:  which there's E gar, EJ gar,
778.24s:  there's gar, plus jump diffusion,
781.12s:  there's binomial, etc, etc, etc. There's a million different,
792.64s:  there's a million different kinds of models. All of these different kind of entities are
799.20s:  attempting to try to figure out what volatility should be. They are forecasting it. They're using
809.60s:  and maintaining their own volatility surface model.
817.52s:  This allows them to come up with their best estimates for what the implied volatility for each
823.76s:  in every option should be. So the way to think about forecast, this is typically institutions
831.04s:  or professional side traders and investors, really institutions typically that are running
838.32s:  analysis to actually try to price volatility. Whereas implied volatility is literally just looking
846.88s:  at what an option is priced at and then backing out what the current volatility is based on the pricing.
856.56s:  But the forecast ball is what's fed into the model.
862.56s:  I'm going to take a pause here. We're going to spend more time when we talk about volatility
867.04s:  getting into the weeds on this. But I do want to make sure that this concept is clear because
871.84s:  the importance here is understanding the nuance when we're talking about implied volatility,
877.12s:  the implied volatility is obviously based on current market prices. It's not based on anything other
885.92s:  than that.
886.64s:  Reses. So forecast is just anyone's forecast. I could have one. You can have a different one.
897.84s:  Yeah, that's correct. But let's say that, and again, the way that the forecast manifests
903.68s:  themselves is through the pricing of an option. When we're talking about the pricing of an option,
908.56s:  it's really essentially us talking about volatility. Because if we go into an options chain
917.92s:  and we look at the price of any of these, this is just looking at spy. When we look at
924.88s:  all of these different options, we know all of the individual inputs that are going into this
933.44s:  options price. Let's call it the 600 puts. We know the price of the underlying. We know the yield.
939.68s:  We know that it's an American style option. We know that this is a put. We know the days to
943.92s:  expiration. We know the risk-free rate. We know all of these different details. The one thing that
950.64s:  we don't know is implied volatility. Somebody has to determine what the implied volatility is.
959.44s:  All of those other inputs essentially are knowns. When we're looking at the price of an option,
966.64s:  we're literally, I know it's kind of esoteric. It's hard to connect the dots for people on this.
972.40s:  We're pretty much just looking at volatility. We want to know what volatility is price that.
977.36s:  It's because everything else is already known. The only thing that we don't know and the only
981.60s:  thing that really this price is highly varied off of beyond those inputs that are standardized and
986.56s:  known is volatility. This implied volatility column is literally just extracting out all of those
994.40s:  known inputs. We're seeing what's left. We're solving for volatility. That's all that's happening
1002.00s:  here. To Reese's point before, anybody can forecast all. If I choose to go through here and I decide,
1012.88s:  my volatility model says implied volatility right now should be 11% as compared to this 10.72%.
1021.60s:  My model in my world, this is low. Then I can make a bet off of that. Maybe I can come up with some
1030.40s:  horizontal trade to play the relative value of the 600 option and sell the 600 option out in 11,
1038.40s:  12, 13, 5, if there's some other expiration works too expensive or if there's option in the same
1044.80s:  expiration cycle, that's too expensive that I want to sell. I can just create a vertical spread.
1050.00s:  But the point being is if I'm maintaining my own model as a retail trader, I can try to come up
1056.16s:  with some ideas here. But the reality is the market is probably going to price these better than
1062.32s:  any of us can. I've tried to maintain a model and sometimes it's decent. But the
1067.92s:  just the reality is with as many market participants as there are and how much big money is in this,
1074.96s:  we're not going to price-volve better than what the market price is. It's just the fucking reality.
1080.48s:  So then we as the retail trading side of things, we essentially take whatever the implied volatility
1086.80s:  is and we say, this is probably pretty close to what it actually is. We don't know, but it's
1091.44s:  probably pretty close to what it actually is. So to recap that whole thing, forecast-volve is
1097.44s:  actually doing the work of figuring out what the volatility of an option should be.
1102.32s:  Implied volatility is when we extract the market price of vol from an option. That's the difference.
1114.32s:  Dejean says, can I use Gamma exposure to create my own vol forecast? Completely different things.
1119.04s:  Gamma exposure is just an entirely different concept than trying to forecast-volve.
1126.24s:  The way that we forecast volatility, and this is why I use the weather analogy, it's not all too
1132.56s:  dissimilar from how we forecast the weather. And I use this analogy all the time because it's really good.
1138.64s:  I live in Southern California. Today it was 50, well right now, it's 55 degrees. So if I were to
1148.24s:  guess what the weather tomorrow in Southern California is going to be specifically the temperature,
1155.36s:  if I were to guess what the temperature is going to be tomorrow at the same time, 17, 15, what is my
1161.04s:  best guess? My best guess is that it's probably going to be something close to this.
1167.04s:  Probably something close to 55 degrees like it is right now, probably. Now we could have a stormfront
1173.60s:  move through and cause a massive change. In the volatility world, that's when volatility becomes
1179.84s:  transitory. But what we're talking about now is the propensity for volatility to cluster, just like
1185.76s:  weather clusters. And again, we'll get way deeper into volatility. I don't want to get too far down
1191.04s:  that rabbit hole in this session. But the main point is the way that we try and forecast volatility
1199.52s:  has a lot to do with looking at what the recent past looks like. And then we can use all different
1206.24s:  kinds of data injects, which is a big part of coming up with an accurate forecast model for
1213.04s:  volatility. It's not just figuring out how to factor in price shocks and things like that.
1218.88s:  It's also knowing everything about the stock. Is there any sort of news coming up that could
1224.72s:  potentially impact the price of this stock? And it doesn't have to be news that's tied directly
1230.24s:  to the stock. It could be news that's tied to an industry conference that's going on right now
1234.96s:  for medical devices. And the one company that is a supplier for medical devices can be impacted by
1241.92s:  one of the outputs from that medical device conference. And that's like a superficial example.
1248.00s:  It goes so much deeper than that to maintain obviously as accurate of a model as we can.
1254.72s:  So that's the difference between forecast fall and implied fall forecast is doing the work of
1262.16s:  trying to estimate what it is. Implied volatility is literally just extracting it out from the market.
1268.80s:  So let's clear all this garbage off. And let's take a look at a quick recap for episode three. Like I
1277.28s:  said, we're an episode four. So episode three and the reason why I don't show you this before we
1282.32s:  do the quizzes, because there's some answers in here like the first one options are price-pike
1286.16s:  consensus. So this idea that we're using black sholes, Martin model to then actually figure out
1292.32s:  how to price an option is that's a theoretical concept. It's not how it's done anymore. It's done
1299.20s:  by all of these different entities from an institutional side of things, figuring out what they think
1306.32s:  volatility should be priced at. All of them are interacting in the same market together that then
1311.04s:  moves the needle towards whatever market consensus is for what volatility is, thus what the price
1317.20s:  of an option is. We already talked about that we need a volatility forecast. I think we actually
1322.40s:  spend a while on that one. And we know that from a retail trading perspective, we derive implied
1329.20s:  volatility from the market. So there's lots of different pricing models. Again, we understand
1334.96s:  them and use them from a theoretical perspective, but from a practical application standpoint, none of
1339.28s:  it matters. Whatever is priced in the market is probably what the options are worth. That's the idea.
1346.72s:  Solid recap. Now we get into trader organization. Let me update our time stamps. So we're at 2240.
1370.24s:  It's taken me forever to type this because it's like off to the side on the way that I'm sitting,
1376.16s:  which is actually kind of funny. So let's talk about this. This idea of trader organization.
1381.52s:  Now as always from military learning style, we always start with TLOs, ELOs. You don't get ELOs because
1388.96s:  I don't care about them. I care about TLOs. And this is the end state. At the end of this session,
1395.04s:  you should be able to complete these two tasks. The first task is to create your own millionaire
1403.60s:  roadmap, which we talked a little bit about in the planning section earlier on, but we're going to
1407.60s:  touch on it again quickly. This is just the name for a plan. I literally just call it that because
1413.28s:  it's a catchy name. It can be whatever number of dollars you want it to be. This is what we studied
1419.52s:  in the skill development session last week is this idea of creating a broader plan.
1427.20s:  Then the second thing you should be able to do by the end of the session is to be able to begin
1432.96s:  creating your own trading plan and supporting trading log. So we're going to talk about those.
1440.24s:  So the first thing, why do you care about this? Why are we talking about this thing? This isn't like
1446.48s:  this sexy part of options trading that is really actually if you think about it, kind of the
1452.08s:  boring, ugly part of options trading. This is why we talk about it. We talk about this because
1460.08s:  of Blue Waffle 135 from three hours ago. I sold a cash secure put on Nvidia the day before it
1468.00s:  crashed 20%. They sold a 135 cash secure put 30 days out for 200 out of 25 delta. Now the cash
1474.32s:  secure put is at a unrealized loss of like 1500 bucks. How screwed am I? What do I do from here?
1483.92s:  This is exactly why we plan to not be in this scenario. This is not a giant deal hopefully for
1494.80s:  them. But the reality is for people, the vast majority of options traders, this is what they do.
1505.36s:  They just start putting on trades and then they wonder why the shit doesn't work long term for them.
1513.44s:  So going off of this concept,
1525.04s:  this is a post that I made that talks about some different stuff. I want to highlight this, the
1531.36s:  third bullet point in here. The concept of this post, and this will be in a newsletter at some
1537.28s:  point, the concept of this post is what I consider to be some of the larger failure points for
1545.20s:  options traders. So the reason why we talk about the failure points of options traders is so that
1549.92s:  we understand what a lot of the common issues are so that we can do something else.
1555.20s:  Because as we talk about with respect to trading, if you want to be successful at this long term,
1561.04s:  you literally have to be a statistical outlier because the majority of people don't do it.
1566.88s:  So we need to understand what they do and then not do that. So this is one of the things that they
1571.76s:  do. They exhibit disgustingly common lack of planning. And we're going to talk about how to create
1578.72s:  organized planning across this whole breadth of things. But the first reason why you care about
1585.04s:  this is because this is what the majority of people do and this does not work. That's why.
1590.16s:  The next reason why you care about this is because when we're trying to figure out how to trade
1598.88s:  options, we're interacting with a very complex system. Markets are complex options are complex.
1605.84s:  We as traders are complex. You have all of these different levels of complexity and all of these
1611.76s:  different interfaces. There are a lot of variables. It is very difficult to confidently track and know
1620.80s:  which ones matter and how much and how to manage them. So that's why I think this is worth your time.
1629.36s:  So let's talk really quick about some common misconceptions and questions. I shot this out and I
1637.12s:  got a few of these in. So I just threw them in here. At the end of these, you should have an answer
1640.88s:  for every single one of these. How do I know what I need to track? I don't think I need a written
1645.04s:  trading plan and I don't know how to make one. So we will cover all of those throughout the sessions.
1651.52s:  If there's any other things during this session that you want to highlight or hit, please throw it
1657.04s:  in the chat now and I will add it to this. This is our guide post. Again, at the end of every
1665.12s:  single time we meet for these Friday sessions, you should have answers to everything that's here
1669.60s:  and you should be able to do what our TLO say you should be able to do. Otherwise, if that's not
1673.84s:  the case, I massively failed you and I don't intend to do that.
1681.60s:  So if there's anything else that you want to make sure that we learn that we discuss along the
1686.32s:  way, throw it in the chat, it'll get added to this list. Now, while you're doing that,
1691.04s:  we'll start with over viewing the key documents as far as my mind is concerned.
1698.48s:  And it's these three things. So on the very far left hand side, that's actually a screenshot of
1706.08s:  my actual trading plan. And as you can see, it is really nothing special. The very top of it is
1714.24s:  just this disgusting yellow text on white sheet of paper. There's nothing special about it.
1721.12s:  I'm highlighting that point purposefully. What it looks like doesn't matter at all.
1727.04s:  Hey, that's what I tell myself all the time. Makes me feel better. But this is actually true.
1733.04s:  Like what this looks like really doesn't matter. What matters is what information you can extract
1737.36s:  from it. The second thing on this list is the millionaire roadmap. So I'm throwing a link in the
1744.00s:  YouTube or in the chat right now so that you can see that video, that video walks you through
1750.24s:  step by step, literally how to create your own path. Whatever that path is. And what I mean by that
1759.12s:  is if we pop over to the website last week, we talked about the money mindset exercise.
1766.24s:  And we talked about trying to find a way to figure out how much money we need by what point in time
1774.72s:  in order to hit that financial freedom threshold. So then we need to then plan for that. So then
1779.92s:  if I'm a trader starting with $25,000, I'm saving $2,500 a month because I'm a really, I'm a real
1786.40s:  good saver. I got 20 years to go using a standard market return of 10% that puts me at 1.8 million.
1794.80s:  Then we can figure out if that's enough, depending on how you intend to withdraw your money and
1798.48s:  stuff like that, you have to go through this process for yourself to figure out what these numbers
1802.56s:  are. But what's important is this number, this number, this number, and this number to start.
1810.64s:  Meaning what is your starting investable principle? How much can you save? How much do you think you
1816.48s:  need in order to be financially free? What time frame are you trying to do it in? And then we get to
1823.76s:  take a look at the rate of return as we become traders. You don't get to change the rate of return
1829.52s:  upfront if you are a new trader. You don't get to have this. It's the same thing is if I am a
1837.76s:  brand new basketball player and I step on the court for my first basketball game, I don't get to
1844.72s:  say like I'm a drop 30 on their heads right now. Well, we'll see how it goes, right? Not playing
1851.92s:  in that competitive level previously that maybe possible may not be possible. So I can have an idea
1857.44s:  of what I might want to do. But the market return is a great planning factor. The reason why I
1863.36s:  emphasize this point so heavily is because one of the most dangerous things traders do is they say
1868.64s:  to themselves, I'm a new trader, I'm two weeks into this. If I'm going to bother learning to trade,
1873.84s:  it should be worth my time. I determine it's worth my time if I'm able to make at least 30% per year.
1880.32s:  Well, guess what? One, you would have a, oh, that's 310. I was going to say it like that's
1887.20s:  a lot of money. You're still going to have a lot of money if you got that 30% per year. But the
1895.52s:  point I'm making here is like, it doesn't matter what you think you deserve. Literally nobody
1901.36s:  fucking cares. What matters is what your skill is able to produce going back to the basketball
1908.64s:  analogy. It doesn't matter if I walk on the court in my mind saying, I'm going to drop 30 on their
1913.04s:  heads. And then I'm out there shooting like Shaq. Right? There's a big disconnect. It doesn't
1919.12s:  matter what the fuck I want. What matters is what I can do. So one of the big issues new traders have
1924.48s:  is they set themselves up for these crazy ass initial returns. And then in order to try to hit
1931.20s:  them, you have to place big trades. Not ready for big trades, probably as a brand new trader.
1938.32s:  So that's the issue that typically opens up here. So that's the second thing you need is that
1945.20s:  roadmap. And you need to have an understanding of where you're trying to land. And then the third
1949.28s:  thing is a trade log. This is a screenshot of one of the trade logs that I've been showing you
1954.80s:  guys for a while for the coverage strangles. And I actually have a video that's coming out
1961.04s:  next week. Maybe we'll do it this week. What do you think? I have a video about trading Bitcoin
1968.16s:  with options. And then I have a video about tracking your trades like a pro building a trade log.
1974.00s:  I'll switch these really quick, because I think it makes more sense to do the trade log video this
1979.52s:  week. So that will go there. This will go here. So now there will be a trade log video that's
1984.80s:  coming out on Sunday. And the trade log video is going to go through pretty much all of this
1995.68s:  through. Well, not incredible through pretty significant detail, especially compared to what most
2002.24s:  people are probably used to seeing. So these are the documents that we need.
2006.96s:  Now, a common question is how do I start? How do I start making one? I'll show you. I'll show
2021.68s:  you exactly how you start making one. What you do is you go to google.com or a word doc. And you
2032.24s:  open up a word doc. So this is a sample trade log template or trade plan template.
2040.32s:  All you need to do is start writing words. You start writing words. You now have a trading plan
2048.00s:  that's a work in process. The reality as we build these trading plans in trading logs, they are
2057.28s:  iterative. That means they are going to change continually. They continue to change. Right now,
2066.24s:  it's really difficult to see because this is like tiny text. But right now, my trading plan is
2071.12s:  415 pages. It continues to change, adapt, grow. The thing to remember is I just wrapped up my 18th
2081.44s:  year of trading. I've been doing this shift for a long fucking time. So that's why there's so much
2086.08s:  stuff in there. So now we have an idea of why this matters. It matters because most traders just
2095.76s:  start trading. It doesn't work. And then they don't know why. This is typically why. The key documents
2106.96s:  that we're going to use are a plan. And it's not really a document. This is like the guiding
2112.88s:  concept of what we're doing. Then we're going to have a trading. I call it an investing plan
2118.08s:  because there's like stuff in real estate and shit in there too. It's not just trading. But
2122.00s:  call it whatever you want. You need a trading or investing plan. And then you need a log.
2127.60s:  So let's talk about the relationship between these things and why this is the order. I think
2135.12s:  it makes sense, which is something like this. One, then two, and then three.
2148.08s:  So we start one with our goals. We create our goals by completing something like the money mindset
2162.16s:  exercise that we did last Wednesday together on YouTube live together. And then we take the money
2169.28s:  mindset exercise and we feed that into our millionaire roadmap. The millionaire roadmap then tells us
2185.12s:  we say I want $2 million within 20 years at a starting principle of 25k with savings of,
2200.00s:  I don't know what the numbers are to work out to 2 million. I'm just coming up with shit with
2204.40s:  savings of 1500 per month at 12% return. Whatever the standard market return is that you want to
2214.24s:  reference off of. We now have some very clear details on what we need to build. We need to build
2222.40s:  something that can return this provided that we can maintain this and provided that we're still
2229.84s:  okay with this. This is why the money mindset exercise feeds into the millionaire roadmap because
2240.48s:  the money mindset exercise tells us this how much money do we think we need.
2246.32s:  And then the recommendation I give to people is to have two numbers, the MVP,
2254.08s:  and then target or goal. MVP is financial freedom.
2260.24s:  The target is what you want, what you desire. So maybe our MVP instead of 2 million is actually
2274.64s:  1 million. The way to think about the MVP, this is where you at least for me, I want to take a
2285.12s:  giant step back and say this is just how my fucking brain works. I'm not saying that this is the
2288.72s:  right way for everybody. I'm just giving you the shit that I know. That's all I can do.
2292.24s:  So I'm not a professional in any of the space, not like a fucking trading coach,
2295.84s:  just talking to you about my experience. And the MVP, the minimal viable product here,
2303.44s:  financial freedom, the way that I plan for this in my mind was this is when I'm at my job.
2311.04s:  And if my job asks me to do something that I don't want to do, I can say no.
2318.80s:  And I can say no comfortably. And then if they press me to do this thing that I might not be
2324.80s:  comfortable with doing, then I can simply say no. And then deal with the consequence.
2331.12s:  The point I'm highlighting there is to have control over yourself, like autonomy,
2338.16s:  the ability to execute your life in the way that you want. Because when you need that job,
2344.24s:  because you have family at home, because maybe it's during COVID, it's a tough job market. So
2350.00s:  your boss is asking you to do something that you don't really want to do, but you're like,
2354.16s:  fuck, I have kids that I have to take care of. I have a wife who's not working right now because
2358.80s:  she's staying at home with the kids or whatever. And the job market's really bad. So it's not like I
2364.24s:  have a bunch of other things I can pivot to. The boss is asked me to do something that I really
2368.00s:  don't want to do for whatever reason. And I'm just going to say yes, because it's safer for me
2373.84s:  to keep my job. Now there's varying degrees of that, right? And I just want to be clear,
2379.44s:  you have to figure out what what the line is for you, right? Like if your boss asks you to do something
2384.80s:  that just like mildly irritates you because it's annoying, well, get over it, bitch. Like that
2389.76s:  doesn't matter that much. But if it's stuff that like you dread going to work, it's soul sucking,
2398.16s:  think of what a terrible way to live the bulk of your life on a day to day basis doing something
2403.44s:  that's fucking soul sucking that you don't want to do. But you're doing it because of these
2408.40s:  obligations because you're a good person that's delivering on these obligations. But I'm here to
2412.88s:  happily tell you there's a better fucking way. You don't have to do the soul sucking thing forever
2417.92s:  if you plan out this shit. So MVP, minimal viable product that's really from the tech world.
2426.16s:  This is when we initially crossed the threshold of being able to have true autonomy over ourselves.
2435.36s:  We should still continue working. We should still continue working. But if there's some big moral
2444.24s:  thing that you just don't agree with and you're still planning on going to find another job,
2450.80s:  but you can stand on your morals in the current job and accept the consequences. That's
2458.16s:  financial freedom. Then the target is being able to do kind of the cool shit that you like.
2465.76s:  A great example of MVP versus target desire MVP. Like I talked about being able to say no
2472.80s:  at work to something you don't want to do. Target desire is you want to travel six times a year
2478.72s:  every time you travel you prefer to fly first class. I sure do. It's way more comfortable.
2483.52s:  That's super expensive. And in general, first class is probably one of the worst possible uses
2488.96s:  of money beyond the comfort that it provides. So that comfort is at a true premium. You can still
2495.36s:  travel. You can still travel six times throughout the year. But if you add the requirement of wanting
2501.04s:  to travel more comfortably, because that matters to you, that's a desire. You don't really need that.
2506.00s:  You can still travel without it. But I can tell you on equivically, it's so much fucking better with
2511.36s:  it. It's so much better. And it's not because like the free drinks and booze and stuff like the
2519.12s:  seats being a little bit bigger is nice. That's a big thing. But it's also the you don't have to
2525.20s:  like worry about the fucking overhead bin space. That's one of the most annoying things because both
2530.96s:  my wife and I, unless we're going on like a dive trip, we just carry a backpack. We don't do
2536.08s:  check bags because you don't need that much shit for the vast majority of stuff. And to like
2542.80s:  have to worry about if there's going to be enough overhead bin space like fuck that. I literally
2548.40s:  will walk on the plane last because I get to stay out of the plane longer. And then I know there's
2554.40s:  going to be overhead bin space for me. Like it's a little shit like that. But again, the point I'm
2559.04s:  highlighting is it's still entirely possible to travel. Just fine. And worry about the overhead
2563.92s:  bin space, but you can make it happen. This is the difference between a target desire level metric
2571.68s:  to account for things like that that you figure out from the money mindset exercise. And MVPs
2577.28s:  simply when you have your financial freedom. So that's the goal setting section. Now that goal
2585.36s:  setting section, as we talked about, gives us some really important takeaways. So one of those
2592.56s:  takeaways is this return over here. We know what we need to hit. Okay, great. Now we have a planning
2601.20s:  factor. So then where does the trading plan come in? So step one to reiterate is goals
2608.32s:  that are quantified. Step two now is creating a plan.
2612.16s:  The purpose of the plan is to figure out this is going to blow your mind. Figure out a fucking plan
2622.24s:  to hit that 12% metric. Or that's the example that we have from the goals was 12% is whatever it is
2629.28s:  that you think is possible and whatever you're targeting. And guess what? As you're going through
2634.32s:  your plan, you might realize that this is doable or this is not doable for you. Or you might realize
2640.72s:  as you're trying to build what this might look like, the way that you thought you were going to do it
2645.12s:  might not work. That's the point of the plan. So now let's talk about the key sections of this plan.
2660.80s:  Where is oh, hold on a second. Perfect. So
2670.80s:  the first section of the plan and you'll see in the template that I have this is something
2677.68s:  I use somewhere else, but for the plan itself, we're going to have some key sections. We're going
2683.60s:  to capture our goals that are quantified. We're going to include the millionaire roadmap
2690.80s:  so that we have a clear target of what we're shooting at. Then what I like to have is kind of a
2701.92s:  portfolio management section. This is going to include my risk tolerance. Beyond portfolio
2714.88s:  management section, this is when we get into the actual tools. So that will be stuff like profit
2719.92s:  mechanisms. This will be stuff like analysis. I personally have sections for market function.
2742.24s:  We'll market history in function. In a practical sense, I don't think you need this. I'm just
2754.48s:  letting you know, like that's actually why you see this. So this is talking about market execution,
2759.68s:  what open outcry was, how electronic exchanges grew and all that kind of stuff. I have an obsessive
2767.76s:  personality. When I am interested in something, I learn everything about it. So that's why this
2774.56s:  shit's in there. You don't need this. Then after this, we have strategy outlines.
2781.68s:  And then after strategy outlines, we should have some sort of AAR process.
2800.88s:  And we should have RFIs. AAR is after action review. This is another military term, but this is
2813.28s:  when after we conduct in operation, we conduct a mission, we look back over and we say how did it go?
2819.76s:  So we need to have an AAR process to do that literally for our performance. Then RFIs requests for
2826.72s:  information. These are ideas that you have on things that you want to try to iterate on. Maybe I
2833.60s:  want to explore doing a 30 delta short put versus the 40 delta short put. And you can take notes
2841.20s:  on this stuff. The reason why those notes are important is because when you do this for a long
2846.16s:  time, after a while, you'll start to have questions like, have I tried this before? And you will be
2854.16s:  able to answer questions like that to be way more efficient with your time. Now within strategy outlines,
2865.60s:  this is a standard format that I use.
2868.56s:  Execs summary. Set up. Management. Cracking.
2881.44s:  RFIs.
2895.28s:  How are we doing so far? These are the elements literally of a trading plan.
2901.44s:  We can look at how to build this together. That's the goal. So let me grab. I'm literally going
2912.16s:  to open up a blank or doc. Like I'm literally going to like straight up do this shit with you.
2921.60s:  What do we want to do? Here's fine. We'll just do a blank Google doc.
2931.44s:  We can all agree that this is about as blank as a Google doc can be. There's nothing in here.
2939.36s:  Oh, that's actually kind of cool with the tab stuff now.
2943.68s:  Here's literally I'm not kidding. If you don't have one, I literally would love for you to just do
2950.88s:  this with me right now. You can start it right now with me.
2954.88s:  So let's essentially take what we captured over here and put it into our log. So the log title,
2967.92s:  trading plan, whatever you want it to be. Now for me in mine,
2975.76s:  we're going to have a handful of sections. So what I'll do is I'll use a couple heading sections.
2991.28s:  We'll start with the title of the doc. The title doc will just be investing plan or trading plan
2996.24s:  whatever you want. And then again, for me, I typically have a quote. The reason why I have the quote
3007.12s:  is it's just a reminder for when I click into this. There's a few of them. So the first one is
3020.80s:  that's something my mentor used to say to me when I used to have different feelings
3025.36s:  about trying to make a bunch of money. He used to say to me, money can't buy a hot happiness,
3030.56s:  poverty can't buy shit. So the lesson behind that is money is an amplifier to your life.
3038.72s:  It can help a lot of things. But if you as a human being are a nasty, ugly human being, not in terms
3045.92s:  of your looks, obviously in terms of your character and personality, money ain't going to fix it.
3050.24s:  If you're a good person that has a beautiful human being, like in totality, money is just an
3057.68s:  amplifier. So that's the first thing. The second thing is this.
3072.48s:  Financial freedom enables true freedom and expression. The reason why I put this in here is
3077.04s:  because it reminds me not just that making money is for the sake of making money to go buy cool
3083.84s:  shit. It's that money literally allows you to be unabashedly yourself, period.
3098.32s:  Whatever that is, hopefully it's a good person, but it allows you to be exactly what you want to
3104.48s:  be, who you want to be. You do not have to tip toe through the tulips with people to make them
3111.52s:  think that they like you to try to get a promotion. You get to be yourself. If there's some sort of
3117.68s:  cause that you really care about, but you're concerned what your workplace might think about you,
3124.00s:  if your workplace has a different disposition than your disposition, and you don't want to go
3129.84s:  apply to this cause or help this cause because of that, that sucks. So that's the idea here.
3136.16s:  So now you literally have the first section of your trading plan. Now let's get some headings in here
3142.40s:  for these other sections. We need goals, not foals, we need goals.
3150.24s:  And the reason why typing is hard is because the keyboard's like off to the side here.
3154.72s:  Millionaire roadmap can go in here.
3166.56s:  We need portfolio management.
3172.56s:  We need profit mechanisms.
3180.32s:  We need analysis tools.
3185.28s:  If you're a nerd, you can have stuff here for like market functions,
3195.28s:  and history. And then we have strategy outlines.
3200.48s:  And then we have a our process.
3217.36s:  And then I normally will have RFIs near the top,
3224.72s:  or I will have them in like a separate word doc or notepad. I don't keep them necessarily in
3230.64s:  the plan because I don't crack open the plan every single day.
3236.96s:  Now why did I use headings? I used headings because it puts them over here so that as your document
3243.92s:  becomes 400 plus pages, you can click at them and it'll just take you to where you're trying to go.
3251.28s:  One of the things you'll notice about the way that I do things is with an obsession over
3256.88s:  efficiency. And it's something that you learn over time. You don't have to get bogged down
3262.32s:  on those details early on. But there is a reason why I do most things the way I do most things.
3270.16s:  And I'm just giving you the the cliff notes version why it's like this.
3275.28s:  So now we have literally the start of a trading plan. You just started a trading plan.
3286.08s:  We now need to figure out and fill in these key sections. So for our goals, I'm not going to
3292.64s:  fill in all of them because it's going to take too long. But essentially we know that we want to
3296.64s:  have 12% target. We already have the details from our millionaire roadmap. You can take a screenshot
3304.40s:  drop in in there. Whatever makes you happy portfolio management. There's a couple key sections
3309.68s:  here. The very first thing we need is risk tolerance. So this means of your total portfolio,
3319.84s:  how much of it are you willing to not see anymore in pursuit of this?
3327.84s:  The way that I explain this to people is we have to take risk in order to get to a reward,
3337.20s:  this reward. In the military, we use a process in ORM process, operational risk management.
3347.20s:  What that does is it makes sure that I'm not taking unnecessary risks or stupid risks that don't
3355.92s:  have a commensurate reward associated with them. So here's an example. Let's say that in my initial
3363.76s:  thought for my risk tolerance, I'm like, I'm okay with a 50% drawdown. Maybe I think that genuinely.
3371.52s:  And that's my initial idea. Well, let's take a look and see if that's actually the case.
3380.00s:  And I'll show you how we can do this. There's two things that matter to us here. The first thing
3390.64s:  is let's go back to this. We can get rid of all that stuff.
3396.56s:  Let's go back to this. We had our scenario where we had like $2,500 or $25,000. I think we
3404.16s:  were saving $2,500 per month. We had a 20 year runway. Yeah. So this is where we were.
3412.00s:  So I say, I'm okay with a 50% drawdown. So let's see if I'm okay with a 50% drawdown.
3420.96s:  Right now, it would take me 20 years to get to 1.8 million. If I click into this, it's 20 years
3428.56s:  to get to 1.8 million. So am I okay with a 50% drawdown with a small account? Of course.
3436.24s:  Why not? A small account is going to be completely, completely dependent on these savings.
3444.32s:  Now, let me show you another example though to help you understand this broader point.
3449.76s:  That's why you have to look at the numbers because the numbers matter a lot. Let's say I'm saving
3457.28s:  no money. And then I do the same thing. I cut the account in half. We go to 12, 5, 20 years. I'd
3465.20s:  have 168K. In 20 years, I have 84. So for a small account, if you are aggressively saving,
3475.84s:  you can get away with more of a drawdown. That drawdown becomes a bigger problem as your account
3483.28s:  gets bigger because then the incremental saving contributions don't matter as much
3490.40s:  if you have a big portfolio. So let's say you have a $500,000 portfolio. You have a mid-size portfolio.
3499.04s:  And let's say that you're not saving any money at this. Well, let's actually say you are saving.
3505.60s:  Let's say you're saving $1,000 a month. Notice the difference here. So for $500,000, $500,000
3513.60s:  account, saving $1,000 a month, 20 years, you have 3.3 million. If I add this, you have 4.1. Still
3520.08s:  a big change. But in the other scenario, the change obviously was multiples of the initial amount.
3528.32s:  So this incremental saving doesn't help you as much. So now let's cut this $500,000 account in half
3535.36s:  maintaining the savings. 20 years, 4 million, 20 years, 2 million. Do you see the point?
3544.00s:  The point I'm making is that with a small account, your savings matter more. With a bigger account
3550.64s:  or as soon as your savings comprise a smaller percentage of the total account value, the drawdown
3557.28s:  matters a lot. So now in that same timeframe, I have half the money. Probably not what I want.
3565.36s:  So then going back to this trading plan idea, this is how we actually assess our risk tolerance.
3571.52s:  It's not just a random number. It's not just sitting there thinking like, oh, yeah,
3574.88s:  fuck, what would I, you know, it would suck to see the portfolio at whatever. That's not it at all.
3580.80s:  It's seeing how different drawdowns impact your actual trajectory and your broader plan.
3588.00s:  I'm going to pop the door for thought.
3596.16s:  Mel is at the gym right now. So I suspect he will be back in several moments when he realized that
3606.88s:  she's not there to feed him dinner. LOL. Does this part make sense so far? The risk tolerance.
3615.12s:  Then from there, I split my portfolio for allocation speculative allocates.
3622.00s:  And then based on your strategies, you have to figure out how much each of these could potentially
3628.96s:  make in the beginning. You don't have to worry about any of that. You need to figure out your risk
3633.68s:  tolerance and you need to figure out a portfolio circuit breaker. This essentially is the point where,
3643.36s:  let's say you decide that your risk tolerance is going to be a 30% drawdown. Your portfolio circuit
3649.28s:  breaker is going to kick on. I like 25%. If your entire portfolio value is down 25% in proximity to
3656.96s:  your, to your total risk tolerance, the portfolio circuit breaker is designed to get you to go in
3661.84s:  there and start cutting fucking trades before you get to your risk tolerance threshold.
3667.76s:  This is how we stop catastrophic drawdowns of accounts.
3672.08s:  Then you can go into broader portfolio utilization rules and shit like that. Profit mechanism.
3677.76s:  I have a video that talks about this. We're not going to dive into the detail on profit mechanisms here.
3692.24s:  Here are that's one video about profit mechanisms. Guess who's back at the door? I fucking told you.
3701.20s:  So funny. It's almost like I know this dog. Here's the second video.
3707.60s:  That talks about creating a strategy. But profit mechanisms are the things that you expect to make money from.
3718.48s:  You can back in real quick. So this can be something like beta drift. So this can be like a large cap.
3741.84s:  And I would define it. So beta drift in this context would be
3746.32s:  propensity for large cap box to steadily grow over time in an expanding economy.
3758.16s:  And then what I would do is I would list research.
3762.80s:  Where do you find the research? Great question from SSRN. That's the starting point.
3773.28s:  Another great example here is momentum. This is well documented.
3778.64s:  In so on and so forth. I would list out the different profit mechanisms I'm intending to trade.
3784.16s:  The analysis tools. I would break this out.
3792.24s:  To be
3796.32s:  guiding concepts.
3799.92s:  Then I would break it out into technical.
3810.64s:  And probably spell technical right. That would be good. And then fundamental.
3814.72s:  Analysis.
3819.36s:  And then I would also add things like
3827.76s:  market analysis process.
3831.04s:  Economic or economy analysis process. And realistically,
3839.76s:  these would be switched for me. You could even see as I'm filling it in, like shit moves,
3844.32s:  right. And these would be literally a list of analysis tools.
3853.28s:  Then market function and history. This is just that optional note stuff.
3858.80s:  And then strategy outlines. Let's do one example of this. So we can have, and here's where I would
3865.12s:  actually use subheadings so that they'll pop up underneath here. So maybe we have a covered
3870.08s:  strangle. And then within the covered strangle, we already know the sections we're supposed to have.
3882.56s:  An executive summary. We need to set up. We need a management.
3894.56s:  Lauren says are there better strategies for smaller accounts?
3898.72s:  Well, as you know, better is relative. But I actually just put a video out not too long ago
3902.72s:  about trading options with like a $5,000 account. Here's that video for you, Lauren. There.
3913.20s:  Management. We need a
3918.24s:  AR process. And then we need RFIs.
3921.84s:  Now I want to linger on the strategy outline specifically. The reason why I want to linger on this
3932.00s:  is because this is where the trade log gets introduced because the executive summary for a strategy.
3940.24s:  And for those that don't know, I have a video that talks about trading plans in depth, like pretty
3948.64s:  far in depth here. So you can check that video out whenever you want. It'll go through all this
3953.44s:  more in detail. The goal for this video is to be way more practical and talk about literally
3958.00s:  starting your own like this with me right now. So the executive summary, this is literally just
3963.20s:  a proof of concept. You should be able to summarize what the fuck this thing is supposed to do,
3968.00s:  this strategy is supposed to do in like two sentences. If you can't do that, it means you don't
3973.44s:  know what this thing is. So this is just a proof of concept to make sure that you know what this
3978.80s:  thing should be doing. So for example, the coverage triangle in this context could be
3988.56s:  designed to capture market beta or leveraged, market beta and amplify returns using
4002.32s:  short options, calls and puts. Done. Set up. There will be different sections in here.
4016.24s:  So the first section, subsection, and again, this will be whatever you want it to be. It will
4022.80s:  take shape over time. But think about literally think about just the process of putting a trade on
4028.32s:  in the shit that you need to do in order to put on a trade. So the first thing is you need to know
4033.20s:  the structure that you're going to use. You need to know the profit mechanism that you're trying to
4041.36s:  capture. You then need to know the product universe or the security universe, the things that you
4048.96s:  might trade. You need to know things like how you plan to set money aside for the strategy
4065.92s:  and so on and so forth. Then management is exactly what it sounds like. It's talking about how are
4071.20s:  you going to actually manage the trade after action review is what are you going to look at to see
4079.84s:  how you performed. So now this starts looking like details that are important for a trade log.
4087.60s:  So if we take a quick pause and we take a look at a trade log, this is again just like a sample
4093.76s:  trade log. There's a video that's coming out Sunday that will go through all this way more in
4097.52s:  detail. But we can take a look at a strategy for example in a trade log here. And this is for what
4107.52s:  a coverage triangle. So this is like an old coverage triangle tracker for this was just an example.
4114.16s:  And when I'm thinking about how to build something to actually track, I need to start with the
4122.00s:  details that simply matter to the strategy. So think of it. What matters to the profit mechanism?
4130.48s:  Well, the first thing that matters is the ability to assess or track if there's drift.
4138.32s:  So I'm going to list out the metrics that are important metrics that are important to strategy success.
4150.72s:  One of those
4155.60s:  underlying price movement. That's a big one. You can then go through and think if you were to click
4163.12s:  the button to enter a trade, what are the things you would look at? Things that I would look at are
4170.40s:  like I would look at the ticker. I would look at expiration. I would look at strike.
4180.40s:  Delta premium. So on and so forth. This is literally how you decide what should go into a trade
4189.76s:  log. Notice how all of this is beautifully aligned with your initial goal set. Your initial
4198.96s:  goal set is to make 12%. We have a portfolio that we're going to try to control risk in pursuit
4205.28s:  of the 12% we're first going to start with whatever our comfort levels are in terms of drawdowns.
4210.40s:  Then we're going to see if that actually can work based on what kind of profit mechanisms we
4216.24s:  understand we're going to try to trade. Then as we look at the individual strategies that we're
4221.92s:  going to try to trade, we start to have a sense of how much money we need to use. How does the
4228.24s:  underlying typically move in whatever the kind of strategy is that you're trying to trade?
4234.24s:  Then what metrics are important to include in a trade log so that you can analyze the performance
4240.72s:  of what you're doing? This is it. This is exactly what I think traders should do to create a unified
4254.16s:  plan. It starts with goals. It goes into a trade plan to outline your ideas. Then we figure out of
4262.96s:  those ideas, we figure out what strategies we think we might want to trade and then we start
4268.64s:  looking at a trade log. Now as we're trying to figure out a key question, how do we get to this 12%?
4276.96s:  Well, that's going to be based on what's in here. What are your strategies? What do you do?
4283.92s:  And based on what's here, that's going to tell you how much money you might need to use at a
4288.96s:  given point in time in order to prospectively be able to hit that 12% return.
4294.32s:  For example, the coverage triangle is designed to capture market beta. Just standard
4298.16s:  market directional movements. We can amplify it with some leverage if we trade a leveraged
4302.08s:  ticker associated with it. I tend towards ETFs personally. If the market has a down year,
4309.20s:  guess what that means for the coverage triangle? It means it's not performing well.
4313.60s:  Now the coverage triangle will still perform better than just buy and hold in the market,
4318.24s:  but that doesn't mean it's going to give me this in a down year. So now I have an RFI.
4324.88s:  One of my questions I'm going to have to solve for at some point is how does this fit into
4336.64s:  my portfolio utilization during market down years?
4342.72s:  Now I have a question. I need to go think about and try to solve for someone and so forth.
4353.36s:  Now the AR process, I think I have, I don't know if I have videos, I'm pretty sure I have videos.
4364.88s:  We probably did it on a live stream.
4367.20s:  The AR process is like a review process. So what I do is I have a weekly,
4376.96s:  monthly, an annual review process. And in this AR process, I literally just outlined the steps
4385.92s:  that matter to me for the review process. So the first step is
4392.08s:  portfolio, you know, track market, you know, for an assessment between the two,
4408.56s:  track strategy utilization, so on and so forth. So the AR process, I outline it so that it's not
4419.52s:  a unique unicorn every single time I do it. And the thing that you'll notice is that,
4425.84s:  and this is why I talk about the process of trading and the process of building things on the back
4438.00s:  end to support what we're trying to do as a trader. If you build the back end process,
4448.16s:  the function of actually trading literally is easy because all of the work is done here.
4454.96s:  So then when we go back to that other example from Reddit of this person,
4464.08s:  guess what? If we have a plan, we already know the fucking answer to this. There is no go to
4470.80s:  Reddit and look for help on what to do. We've thought through this because this is part of the plan.
4477.60s:  We're talking about up here, the management, the management cycle for a trade includes
4486.08s:  how risk management approach, profit management approach, time management approach.
4501.12s:  And so on.
4505.68s:  This is it. If you followed along and you did some of this work with me, congratulations.
4511.76s:  You literally just started your very own trading plan. And that literally is huge. It might sound
4518.80s:  insignificant, but that's a huge step in starting to build something that's logical, scalable,
4526.40s:  that's not based on randomness. That's actually purely decisions that are made on information,
4535.44s:  not pure randomness based on what you happen to feel at a given point in time.
4541.20s:  Any questions on this idea about trade or organization,
4557.04s:  and the question, goal setting, trading plans, trading logs, anything like that.
4571.04s:  The key takeaway from this is the most important part of this is starting.
4577.76s:  And if you start the process, it's iterative. Don't get overwhelmed, not knowing what to track.
4590.00s:  What happens to a lot of people is they don't know what to track, or they say they don't know what
4595.28s:  to track. So then they just don't track. That's a bad answer. The way that we figure out what to
4604.16s:  track is trying to logically think through the inputs that we use when we're making a trade decision.
4613.76s:  And then creating areas for us to track those inputs. So then we can see if it's something that's
4621.52s:  relevant, that matters, if it's something that doesn't matter. And 54 says, make sense, we're all
4630.72s:  running blinds. Yeah, the vast majority of people do. The vast majority of people literally
4635.36s:  just start trading. They somehow hope that it's magically going to work out. And it's fucking crazy.
4641.20s:  It's literally the dumbest thing on earth. And I'm not calling other people dumb because guess what?
4646.64s:  I'm the same fucking idiot. I did the same shit. We all do it. And it's because we're all grossly
4653.28s:  misled at the onset of what this whole trading thing is going to look like. But yeah, it's
4659.76s:  these kinds of things. Once you see them and you understand them, it's kind of like,
4665.12s:  fuck, kind of makes sense. It's actually kind of silly to not do this. The equivalent of not
4670.88s:  tracking these kinds of things is it's like, imagine you're a stock holder. You hold Apple.
4680.80s:  And then you get on the earnings call and then they ask, hey, Apple, how did they, how do you guys do?
4689.44s:  Last quarter. And Apple just goes, well, you know, I'm not too sure. It felt like it was pretty good.
4696.08s:  We had some some pretty good ideas. We tried some of them. I think the the new iPhone might have
4705.60s:  get rid of this, this damn extra camera button that nobody likes. I think maybe we could do that.
4713.92s:  Not really sure. And then somebody's like, well, got it. So how many phones did you sell?
4720.08s:  I don't really know. Oh, curious. How many, how many computers did you sell?
4727.52s:  Not too sure. Maybe like a thousand, two thousand, five thousand. Not positive. How much did
4732.00s:  you sell them for? Well, it kind of depends on where I sold them. Right. You see the point.
4738.32s:  Like, imagine a business trying to do what we do as traders and again, trading at a professional level.
4746.96s:  It's a fucking business. Now, the thing that I will always remind you, the beauty of all of this
4756.24s:  is that the reason why the opportunity exists as it does is because most people don't
4768.08s:  do this stuff. So it means that it literally is not overwhelmed with
4775.04s:  uns of people that are in here with, you know, all different kinds of ideas trying to extract
4781.52s:  all kinds of market opportunities. Most of them can't even get to the market opportunities.
4789.76s:  They can't get out of their own way. And that's not me wishing that on anybody. It really isn't.
4795.44s:  If anybody knows what I'm about, I mean, shit, I'm sitting here on Friday night talking about
4800.80s:  shit that I've known for nearly two decades. Literally, that's not me. The my hope genuinely is to
4808.88s:  try to help other people avoid this really silly, unnecessary path that the majority of people take.
4817.92s:  That's my hope. So that is my TED talk. That's what we have for trade or organization.
4829.04s:  You now know how to create a millionaire roadmap. You understand and you started to create your own
4837.28s:  trading plan. And you're able now to create your own supporting trade log based on the inputs we
4845.52s:  talked about. You need to capture by outlining what matters to the individual strategies.
4851.60s:  And then there's a video coming out on Sunday that's going to go into trade plan. I'm sorry,
4856.56s:  trade logs in detail. So you can tune in for that one so that then you can figure out over the next
4864.72s:  couple days. What kind of strategies you run, what kind of metrics are relevant to that strategy.
4870.96s:  And then spend today and tomorrow brainstorming on that writing that out. And then as you're
4875.76s:  sitting there saying, well, I don't know how to fucking do this trade log thing. Then boom, Sunday,
4880.16s:  the light will shine down through the clouds. And there will be a video for you about building a
4887.12s:  trade log. And the video, let's see, the video's 25 minutes long. As we all know, it's pretty,
4897.04s:  you boy, you boy goes a little deep sometimes, but you know, just kind of what it is.
4907.28s:  Cool. That wraps us up for this. If there's any just general Q&A, anything from a beginner level
4915.12s:  perspective that you want to talk about now is literally the perfect time to bring that up. We
4919.44s:  can cover literally whatever you want. And while we're doing this, I'm actually going to do a little
4925.68s:  bit of homework, which my homework is to update our recap what we talked about. I like to do it
4932.48s:  right after we talk about it so that it is the freshest in my mind. And as you can tell, what we're
4938.96s:  going to do is have a list of these so that they will all be in the same spot forever. So we'll be
4947.28s:  able to look at all pretty quickly together. So what questions do we have? Like I said, anything,
4956.00s:  it doesn't have to be related to what we just talked about. Anything from a beginner level is
4961.12s:  totally cool. So this was a greater organization. This was what option pricing.
4970.80s:  This was
4977.60s:  buying versus selling. This was 101 recap.
4989.76s:  So now what we learned, we figured out how to create our own unknown.
5000.80s:  Millionaire road mapping process.
5004.48s:  The creation of trading, plan, outline and key sections.
5016.24s:  And then we talked about determining
5030.16s:  the key metrics.
5041.52s:  Jesus, you track from the plan in a trade log.
5048.80s:  That will be our recap for the next one.
5060.88s:  I think we can kill this thing.
5067.12s:  Let's see.
5071.28s:  Tommy says your thoughts on Elon saying there's a path for Tesla to being 20 trillion
5075.84s:  company at an earnings call. I mean, I don't disagree with them. I think, like, I think
5083.36s:  objectively, there is what we would consider like a path. I think that that's a fair statement
5091.36s:  overall. I just think it's a little bit of a reach, but it doesn't surprise me, you know, to see
5101.20s:  to see him say something like that, especially with the total potential impact that Tesla might be
5108.48s:  able to have longer term, and depending on how it evolves, because that's the other reality,
5112.96s:  is that Tesla is probably going to evolve significantly as the rest of the market evolves.
5120.32s:  So yeah, I mean, I think it's a little, I think it's a little dramatic, but also for a kind of guy,
5128.72s:  like he, you kind of accept that that's how he's going to talk. That's what he's going to be about.
5138.56s:  But I mean, Tesla as a company has looked a little bit rough, I think.
5144.40s:  The volatility in it has not been very good. Yeah, actually fell down below this.
5150.24s:  Funny enough.
5150.96s:  He's an earnings though.
5156.88s:  A brand says, well, I'm learning options. So we should track every trade made when DCA in an
5163.68s:  uptrend and right down the reason why I bought it.
5171.68s:  Well, it depends on what you're trying to track, right? So like, if you're doing like a long-term
5180.72s:  investment, there's not really a whole lot to track in terms of rationale provided that the
5186.40s:  rationale remains the same. Now, if it were me, what I would do is I absolutely would note when I
5193.20s:  chose to buy in. But if you're buying in on a regular scheduled dollar cost average cadence,
5200.48s:  then you already know the reason I wouldn't necessarily log that specifically. I would have a note
5205.84s:  in the log that says standard entry is blank date with blank amount of money.
5212.32s:  And then if there's a deviation off of that, for some reason, I would absolutely track that.
5218.24s:  The other thing I would track for that kind of position is whatever frequency you analyze the
5226.56s:  position, meaning if you look at it on a quarterly basis and you're like, do I like this position
5233.60s:  still? Do I not like this position? And how do you determine how you like the position? I would
5239.04s:  track that. So let's say for the last quarter, you track things like, again, if it's a dollar cost
5243.36s:  averaging position, I'm assuming something slightly longer term. So something I would track are the
5247.84s:  earnings. I would say, what was EPS? What was the reaction? What was the movement over the last
5253.76s:  earnings? And again, you can come up with some pretty good trade ideas based on that. You can
5258.40s:  start to get a sense of your different holdings, which are performing best over on a quarter by
5264.48s:  quarter basis. And is there a relationship to what the earnings report is? And then that can really
5269.76s:  inform how you funnel your money going forward. So yeah, the thing is, it stuff like this is whatever
5278.72s:  we want it to be. But what I can tell you is that if we're trying to make as much money as we
5284.48s:  possibly can, we have to think of it from that lens of how can I make as much money as I possibly
5292.64s:  can from this. And there's a process that we can logically follow to do that. It does require
5301.76s:  some effort though. And that's, that's the, I think that's the rub for most people is that once we
5309.92s:  start looking at that effort side of things, it starts to look real, starts to look real sketchy,
5314.88s:  real ugly. Is it worth? Sweet. All right, gang. Looks like we got no more questions. That's all I
5324.48s:  got for you. If you need anything, you guys always know you can hit me up. Happy to help. However,
5329.36s:  best I can be an outlier. We'll see you all later.
