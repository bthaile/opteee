0.00s: What's up, outliers? Welcome back to our training on filtered. Where we have a community member,
7.76s: Tray Jay, who actually spawned this idea, which has been super fun. Where we just chat
12.64s: about markets and spend a little time finding that middle ground between kind of like more
17.52s: seasoned retail trader and earlier slash late early stage trader. So Tray, looking forward
25.44s: to chatting again, what's on the dock in? Yeah, thanks. He sounds good. Hey, everyone. Hey,
32.32s: outliers. First of all, happy birthday to the Marine Corps. I see you back. I see you back to
38.80s: Punishing yourself. How how was your back through all of this? Are you doing all for doing?
43.52s: It's not good. I literally, it's so funny. So what he's referring to is, I have our hernieded disc
50.32s: at L4 L5, which is a little bit abnormal. Most people that have hernieded discs, they're between
56.88s: L5s1, but genetically for whatever reason. L5s1 for me is like just not there. Just don't have
62.88s: a disc there. So like those two vertebra are already together. I never noticed that seem fine.
67.52s: But that just put excessive movement on L4 or a 5 to pick up the slack. So I hernieded that like
74.64s: a year and change ago and I've been trying to fix it non-surgical, which has definitely been
80.16s: a challenge. It's actually why in a lot of videos, even this video, you'll see me fidget a lot.
83.84s: And it's just because like sitting hurts and stuff like that, it's gotten a lot better. But
88.88s: as I was going to the gym today, I literally, as I was driving up, I was just like, they're
93.12s: literally is nothing productive. That's going to come out of this. It's not like, oh, I'm going to
96.64s: like grow muscle or build muscle endurance. Like that's not why I went there today. And I just
102.24s: kind of accepted it. So yeah, no, it hurt the entire fucking time, but that's just how it goes
107.20s: sometimes. You put it on mad, mad, so absolute mad, mad. Okay. Okay. What did you think of the
116.88s: markets today? Anything catch your attention? Yeah, I think we got the move, right? We talked about
123.04s: this playbook related to government shutdowns and the playbook is super simple. It was built on
132.00s: an analysis of every single government shutdown that we've had before. And there are a couple
136.48s: high level items that were very clear. One of them is that over the lifespan of the shutdown,
142.64s: it's like a coin flip 50 50 chance, whether or not you're going to be positive or negative
146.48s: over the lifespan. So effectively, not tradable. Oh, that's okay. I got to take a step back and
151.76s: clarify that just because something's a 50 50 split doesn't mean it's not tradable, but it's also
156.16s: because of the size associated, meaning in the frequencies that it was up, there wasn't like
161.36s: some massive upsidescue compared to the downside. So what that means is you can have a strategy that
167.76s: might have a lower success rate where the thing you think is going to happen happens, but if it happens
173.36s: big enough, you can still trade it. That's not the case here. So it's more genuinely like a 50 50 split,
178.64s: both in terms of probability and severity. But one thing we noted is that,
185.04s: literally, every single time the announcement that the shutdown is coming or the shutdown is like
190.40s: winding down once that comes out, the government typically is starting to stabilize,
197.52s: production of overall volatility in terms of what we think might happen in the cascading impacts,
203.68s: that all the baits and it's generally followed by market up. So as we talked about it,
210.24s: there's a bunch of different quirky ways to trade that stuff. It's not as intuitive as you might think.
215.52s: Especially for like futures open yesterday. That followed a very specific playbook
223.92s: that I've seen literally thousands of times for other events, not government shutdowns. We haven't
228.48s: had that many of them. And then the movement today, again, it was a 50 50 chance in terms of what it looked
235.60s: like, but the broader expectation of up was obviously realized to a pretty significant degree,
243.52s: S&P was up about what one and a half percent over the last trailing 20 days or so.
251.12s: That represents a 2.1 standard deviation up move. So a decent size up move on the day. So yeah,
259.04s: that's hands down the biggest thing I saw. Yeah, I think I agree with that. There's also the
264.16s: potential of a whole bunch of backlog of data that's not being released, the delugia fit coming
269.36s: along with you know, as soon as they open. So do you think that could also add to the,
273.92s: you know, probably to your having that move? Yes and no, I think the thing is most of those things
284.00s: that are like really far back, don't really matter. It'll be whatever the most recent one is.
289.68s: That's going to have the most weight and how far off that is. So even though we've gone a while
295.76s: and going a while without information, naturally would lead to a higher potential for being off.
303.28s: A lot of times the estimates are very close to the actuals and it's because it's, you know,
308.00s: just 0.8 a point B. Have every single month, very, very row easy to predict.
313.84s: When you add this kind of slack to those systems, the prediction becomes more difficult because
318.40s: A to B now isn't over the course of or five consecutive weeks. Now it's going to be
324.80s: one week to five weeks later. So that higher potential for some sort of skew, but
333.20s: again, and as usual, the market's pretty good at this stuff. So seeing VIX down,
339.68s: where it was, it's even down after hours now, it's at 1840. So VIX is still slightly elevated
346.88s: longer term, but again, if you give it the context that you just gave us,
351.84s: not really that elevated, considering the fact that there's literally like four or five weeks of
356.00s: data that we're pending. So summarize that thought, I think that there's definitely a potential
361.44s: for a larger variance, but I don't think that it would be enough to necessarily cause some
368.32s: sort of profound move unless something genuinely broke. And it's always that outside moved. So what I
376.00s: mean by that is like, I don't think it's going to be like this insane sensitivity if the numbers
379.60s: offer a bit, but I think if the numbers like grossly off, you could see you could see that, but right now,
386.16s: the market really isn't tipping its hands that it necessarily expects that. If I look across
391.84s: the wall surface right now, and just eyeballing term structure, in the front, I see 15.24%
400.24s: in spy. That's using the full chain, I typically prefer to use like the at the money vault.
405.20s: So the at the money vault is like 12, high 12s, low 13% that's for the 11th for the 12th,
413.44s: same thing. It's like 13% or the 13th, it's like 13.2%. So you kind of see the general trend here,
424.96s: as I click through this week, it doesn't really look that crazy. The only real notice on the 14th
432.40s: goes up to like 13.6% or 14, if you're using just the out of money on the call sides,
440.24s: that's like 14.6% which is a little elevated, but not a ton. So that's really just using the
448.16s: volatility surface to at least come up with an estimate, but right now it doesn't look like the market
453.12s: is pricing it anything too crazy. Yeah, I would I would put the title of sold so in the same category,
458.40s: I think they're looking past it's a non-concernt at least for now, but until it could be a
463.52s: concern based on the Supreme Court decision or something. Yeah, there was some news today about
470.32s: negotiations with tariffs across EU down to 15% and some India as well. So interesting,
476.72s: making some moves. And there was another thing you mentioned that either on Sunday,
483.12s: stream or on Saturday stream about index wall being compressed while single stock wall
489.20s: expanding. Do you think the dispersion trade is back on the table in full-left
493.36s: factors? Is that what does happening or is it not related? That comes in and out. Yeah, that's
498.96s: like really really hard and it's also the kind of thing that generally speaking, especially if you're
503.20s: going to do it correctly, that's one of those things that like just really is an accessible to retail
506.72s: traders. So you can glean a little bit of information on whether or not it's like,
514.56s: whether or not it seems really fat, but most of the time it's not and you'll see that come in
524.08s: an out of Vogue a lot or to say if it would be on in full force, I still think that broader
531.28s: wall right now probably wouldn't be hyper-condu-sift to it. So I just I think it got priced down so far.
536.96s: What ends up happening and what we're talking about for those that aren't familiar with the
540.96s: concept of dispersion trading is a lot of times institutions, larger entities, they're able to
547.20s: trade the difference in relative volatility between an index and then the primary components of
554.32s: that index. So it's not necessarily all 500 names. You don't even have to do all 500 names, right? Like
560.40s: if you're looking at some P5 100, the top 10 companies are like fucking whatever percent of it
564.24s: huge now. So you really just need like 50 to 100, maybe 200 if you want to be a little more precise,
572.48s: and then you're just trading the relative vault disparity between those two. Now a lot of people
577.84s: found that edge and as it got more and more crowded, it actually got overpopulated, which is why
584.56s: we saw periods of time where it literally wasn't happening. But now it does look like on and off again,
592.24s: it's still I'm not sure if I would consider it in full effect, but it's definitely there and it's
597.44s: always going to be something that's intermittent, I think going forward.
600.88s: Yeah, yeah. How has earnings being for you so far just trading them? I'll be honest, I've had a rough
606.48s: time this season. Some of the, yeah, I've had a really bumpy time this season, ready to try.
614.56s: I don't know, I think one, there was one big loss that throughout like, it happens with earnings,
620.40s: right? It was still within like tolerable loss because of the sizing of the trade itself.
625.60s: But overall when I'm looking at the trades that I picked, I haven't done a good job. So I'll just
631.76s: when you're talking about it, and I just wanted to get your thoughts and how it's worked for you so far.
636.72s: Some of the, some of the, I'd be sad to opposite. That's great. So back to zero.
641.84s: Yeah, it's been literally a completely mellow season. That's why I'm honestly so shocked because
649.20s: that would lead me to believe that there might be some sort of sizing issue and what you're doing
655.04s: or selection issue. Like that's the best. And again, the selection issue, I don't lean on that to heavy.
662.48s: The reason why I say selection issue in my mind is more if you're just not doing enough of them,
667.36s: because you really do need a decent number of them. But what was, do you know how big the move was
676.24s: realized against, expecting? I, I remember the move and I was one ticker, Pfizer or Pfizer.
684.48s: It had a 50% move F5. I think it's a stop name, ticker name. It had a 50% move of 4.7 standard deviation
693.28s: moving price and 4. Wait, what's the ticker? What's the actual ticker? F5.
698.80s: F5. Oh, I thought you're saying Pfizer like, like, PFP, like Pfizer Pfizer. I was just like 50%
707.20s: what the fuck happened? Oh, Pfizer moving like tap. Man. Oh, no, beautiful.
712.00s: Doubt of nuts. All right. Let's take a look at this one. I'm so curious right now. I just want to know
717.68s: what the, because I didn't trade that one. I want to know what the expected was in that.
728.08s: So that was expected. Yeah, that you shouldn't have traded that man. Yeah, I agree.
736.88s: I wanted more trades in that cycle. So I took a chance on this one. Fair enough. So one thing to note
744.32s: specifically when trading earnings, there's a lot of little details that you got to work out
749.36s: in the system. But one of the things to shortcut you is that two things. If you see something that
756.00s: within the last four earnings seasons has more than two moves outside of the range that's acts.
763.92s: Unless you're getting paid in a noxious amount of money to take that risk and if you do
768.08s: you size it down, the other thing is that if you see something that has successive moves
774.80s: outside of the range and based on what multiple tells you a lot of information. So F5 for example,
781.04s: in July, it was expected at 638 came in at 138 two times off. In April, 5 7 came in at 185.
793.04s: Three times off. And then even the one before that was still outside or two at 7 1. So what that
801.04s: tells me is that the vol pricing going on in here is literally a bismal. So if we look at what the
809.84s: implied was for this coming earnings release, it was 117. That 117 is still under the realized move from
817.04s: the most recent two. So all of that means that this doesn't seem like it's pricing vol well,
824.72s: at least favorably to the seller side of the equation. This would be a complete pass. The easiest
830.40s: way to summarize all of that shit that I just said is that if you see something that had two moves
836.16s: or more, that's a massive problem. If it's over two, that's a no. It's a period no. This one had
841.36s: three. Complete no. But that part aside, if it has two moves, it's like it would need to have
849.44s: so much vol premium. So great example using this one. If October 25, if the implied was, let's say
858.24s: 30%. Okay, I'll take that risk. Generally, even though it doesn't misdirect the parameters,
864.80s: I would go in expecting to lose. But that's so much that I would take it. But if it's not something
871.12s: that's like, agree, just like that. And the reason why it would have to be so high is because of the
876.64s: 185 and the 138. So yeah, that that makes a lot of sense, honestly, because the thing that you got hit
884.72s: with here is two fold, which is kind of shitty. The first one is you got hit with a big move. And
890.40s: exactly as you said, every once in a while, that big move is going to happen, period. And all things
895.76s: considered, it wasn't that big. It was big. But it's not that big. So the way that you framed it
902.40s: in terms of impact, that makes sense. That sounds about right. We're definitely was probably bigger
907.20s: than planned, but still within we walk away alive. But even even with that, you went in with such
915.68s: small vol that the margin for error is effectively null. So yeah, bummer, bummer that you had that,
924.80s: I would definitely say good job sizing it so that it didn't really, really hurt you. But that
930.48s: definitely would explain like the lumpy return cycle. Because yeah, that's a tough one. There
935.44s: is one I'm trading right now. I'll literally tell you what it is because it's this will come out after
939.52s: it goes. Where is it? This one? I and oh, oh wait, no, sorry, that was, no, that's correct. I
949.76s: know, is that one that I was able to get in the picture? I can't remember. I think I, yeah, I think I
957.76s: did this one, I'll try to make up. So this one while I'm talking about it, the reason why I
965.28s: just, I just think, I remember looking at one of these and think, no, it's not that one. So I
970.16s: couldn't get a fill on that one. It was too small. So which one was it? I think it was, I think it was,
984.72s: I think it was RGTI or Rocket Lab, one of those two. And the, the cliff notes for it is,
993.28s: it was Rocket Lab. So Rocket Lab had one out of the last two or one of the last four that was
999.76s: outside pretty significantly. But the largest multiple I saw was a two-time move, which again,
1005.36s: that can always guide up. I don't rest too heavily on that. But the main thing is the implied that
1011.84s: that we were going in with was so high that I just say, yeah, sure, I'll take that risk. And that's
1018.88s: literally all it is. It's not anything more interesting than that. But that selection criteria in
1027.12s: terms of the risk that we're taking against what we're getting paid definitely is a little bit tricky.
1032.32s: So good exercise, glad that it didn't hurt too bad. But yeah, that one, that one's like big red
1038.96s: flashing signs that this one doesn't look good. It's, it's had so many outside the expected range even
1045.44s: over the last eight. So one more question to not over dissect you, but just had a sheer curiosity.
1052.72s: Like why this one verse any of the others that you were looking at, I assume that there is others at the time?
1058.48s: Ever. I did see the red lights and I didn't really like it. But I did, so this was among the second bucket of
1066.56s: shot listed. Because I was training, I got the first bucket out. And in the second bucket, I found this to be
1073.52s: the most well priced. I think despite it being having this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a logical
1079.44s: reason. I was actually hoping that you were going to arrive at lesser revivals to be honest. Yeah,
1084.16s: the the only small change that I would make on that is that if you are looking at things that
1089.76s: just don't fit, they just don't fit, that is what it is. You go in light. Like we were looking at
1094.96s: earnings yesterday during the market prep stream and it's light this week. It's just going to be
1100.08s: light this week. That's how it goes sometimes. But as long as you get on the numbers over the preceding
1106.00s: weeks, even if you only can get like three to six on, you're fine. Because last week, we before,
1113.20s: you're able to get on whatever number you want effectively. So yeah, I think
1119.84s: I think this scenario makes way more sense. Thank you for explaining. It's it's a good, it's a good
1124.08s: case study to to think through. Yeah, and definitely I my screening process needs, you know, refinement
1131.12s: for sure. Easiest, easiest thing. If it's more than two, it's a no period. That makes it that's very helpful.
1137.92s: Thank you. That's way. Yep. More than two out of the last four, we say no. If it's at two, we say,
1144.00s: probably no unless I'm getting paid handsomely. If it's one or below, that's when it's on on the dance floor.
1152.40s: We should be getting to the topic for today. Yeah, let's go for it. Cool. The topic I have today
1159.28s: is what does normal look like in the markets? The idea for it really originally came from a group
1166.72s: discussion and I grew about paid post earnings announcement drift, particularly the period between
1173.36s: the two earnings events, where typically and traditionally the the research suggests that the wall
1179.76s: remains low and is you know, the impact of wall is low there. But it doesn't seem to be the case
1186.56s: in notice it's just feels a lot more event driven. Treat driven and a lot of things can happen
1194.80s: at any given point between the two earnings events itself. So in there are different market
1200.64s: participants, the composition is different. The ability to position and react is also different.
1207.28s: This structurally things have changed. So for us retail traders to bring it all the way back
1213.92s: and shout out to the lads and discord, hardcore ban and phoenix. Their question was, how do we even
1221.28s: begin by describing this as normal? How do we where is the definition for normal? Is it based on price?
1228.96s: Is it based on volume? Could it be based on volatility, market breadth, a combination of these things?
1235.68s: If we were looking back historically, would it be, how do we know what time frame? So there's
1241.68s: a number of ways to look at this and there are so many other signals that we haven't
1246.24s: even talked about. So if you if you were you, Eric with your blistered palm and pumped up shoulders
1253.20s: starting today, how would you go about framing your approach to understanding this is what is
1260.16s: normal for me in the market? Two separate things. The question on how I will approach, I'll get to
1267.68s: that in a moment. I want to talk first about this concept of normal normalcy. If you were call,
1273.76s: when we were just looking at the movement in spide today and I had said, the recent standard deviation
1281.20s: move was like two or whatever. That's based on a rolling window. That's not based on spise life span.
1290.48s: That's based on a trailing 20 day realized window. The purpose for that is you guys are identifying
1299.60s: normal changes and normal is not always the same thing that you've seen. So you can even see this
1307.84s: expressed in the weather, right? And this isn't going to like global warming, not global warming,
1312.56s: but there definitely is change and you can see it. You can measure it. So with stuff like that,
1320.00s: though it happens slowly and then you kind of look up one day and you're like, oh shit,
1325.04s: like this is actually pretty different than what this typically looks like. So the way that I would think
1330.48s: about normal is that I would start by understanding that it will never always be exactly what you think
1340.80s: normal is. It's more about like ranges of behaviors. Now to get into the second part of that about
1346.88s: how would I start? I would start by just conducting research and contextualizing that research.
1352.72s: So for example, the first few questions I would have about the research that you are citing before
1357.68s: is and I don't know if you remember if not it's fine. But do you know what time frame it analyzed?
1365.68s: I don't depend on that. That's okay. But that's typically a really big thing to look at.
1371.04s: And more often than not in studies like that it will be multi-year periods. And if it's a good
1377.60s: study which if you're getting it off of where I think you are, please like us as our end.
1382.32s: In the bottom and the appendices they typically have tables. So what I would do is start with the
1388.72s: research see what they say and then I would go to the tables and I would say, okay, they looked at a
1395.68s: 30-year window and they're measuring whatever the you know pieces that you're talking about.
1401.12s: And I would look at I would literally just look at it and say what did these numbers look like?
1406.00s: And if I can't piece anything out visually by looking at it just plot it.
1410.40s: And it's really easy to do especially because you can get the papers digitally.
1413.76s: So you can convert it into an Excel doc or Google sheet and then just look at it.
1418.40s: But that's the first thing that I would do. If you were to call another example of this is with
1424.32s: the earnings season prep that we do because the way that I wait different things has changed,
1431.84s: it used to be I favored a longer look back window. But I literally just finished when I made
1438.08s: that announcement to you guys it was a four-year study that I was wrapping up. And I had conclusively
1445.76s: decided that the additional data gathered by 12 cycles so for beyond the broader window that I look at
1456.40s: are effectively not predictive. They're like flat. It doesn't hurt you, but it doesn't help.
1462.08s: Whereas the other is true focusing on last eight and four waiting it appropriately is massively helpful.
1468.96s: So it's the same thing as that. So zooming back out and thinking about like how to approach this
1475.44s: concept of normal. The first thing you're starting with research and contextualizing that
1479.60s: research. The thing after that is really difficult because you won't know what normal is for a while.
1487.12s: Think if you commute for your job. You probably know where traffic is, where traffic is and where
1495.44s: if you see a cop you might say like, ah, normal. I don't see a cop there. That's weird.
1500.00s: And how do you get to that level of understanding? How do you know that that cop sitting there is
1504.24s: weird? Well, it's because you've driven that route X number of times. You have a pretty good data
1508.00s: sampling your mind. And you say out of all the other samples, this thing sticks out because it's normally
1512.88s: not there or the inverse. If you always see the cop there and then he's not there, then it's the
1517.44s: inverse of that. But that process of looking at things repeatedly and understanding how they behave
1525.60s: and just watching to build the base layer context, that's where all of its based off of.
1532.00s: Now, you can speed up this process by looking at his story stuff. It doesn't replace it just
1537.76s: like paper trading doesn't replace live trading, but you can look at his story stuff.
1542.40s: And a logical follow-on question is like, what's stuff? This is where things get tricky because
1549.36s: there is so much to look at when you're a new trader that you can look at a ton of stuff and
1556.08s: really see nothing. You can't really pull that much because you look at this one thing,
1560.80s: randomly on a Tuesday, then you don't look at it again until another Wednesday,
1565.28s: you can't do it like that. You have to be more precise. So an easy way to think about it is like,
1573.36s: if this whatever this thing is that I'm looking at, I'm going to track it for a relevant matter of time.
1580.56s: When I say relevant in this context, that depends heavily on the sample.
1587.60s: If I'm looking at zero DTE options over the course of a week, I get five samples. So in that one week,
1596.48s: I get a ton of information. If instead I'm looking at how the market behaves around non-farm payroll
1604.08s: or unemployment numbers, those don't come out as frequently. So if I do the same one week study,
1611.60s: I might walk out with one or none, depending on where we're at. The point there is that you have to
1617.68s: think about what it is that you're trying to analyze and collect. You have to get specific. If you
1622.96s: don't do that, you're going to spend so much time looking at a ton of different stuff and
1626.56s: I've nothing to show for it. And then you have to analyze it in a way that's logical to whatever
1632.56s: it is that you're looking at. So a way to think about this is just to create dedicated time,
1638.00s: whether you trade daily, whether you look at the markets once a week, that part really doesn't
1644.16s: matter quite that much. But again, if you're going to trade once a week, I would build stuff
1650.32s: that makes sense for that periodicity. If I was trading once a week, I'm not going to look at
1655.68s: opening range breakouts and NASDAQ to try to trade those. That's outside of my window. I wouldn't
1661.92s: be able to trade that anyways. It's inefficient. I would base it more so on first what's your
1670.96s: frequency, what's your habit of looking at markets. And then the second, I would build first.
1676.56s: I would get super, super zoomed in and I would focus with profit mechanisms first. And the reason
1684.00s: I'm saying that is just because with profit mechanisms first, that's the ultimate thing that matters.
1691.36s: So if we talk about the markets reaction around GDP, there is a trade around stuff like that.
1698.40s: But those don't happen that frequently. That's not going to be or shouldn't be a primary profit
1704.48s: mechanism or a regular retail trader that's trading once a week. Again, it's a mismatch. It doesn't
1709.60s: logically make sense. That regular retail trader has to pick things that allows them to at least
1716.16s: get close to the goals in a reasonable amount of time based on what their windows are.
1722.72s: And then it's picking things that are relevant to that. So for example, let's say that you work a job
1729.36s: where you can't look at the market, let's say before the close. Well, what does that mean?
1737.36s: earnings are probably not going to be in your bag. Why? Because that's when you need to enter.
1744.00s: And you need to be able to access the market the next morning to take it down. And if you can't do that,
1749.92s: that sucks. Because it's a fantastic profit mechanism. But we're working within our constraints.
1755.20s: There has definitely been periods in my career, especially when I was on active duty in the
1758.64s: Marine Corps. It's impossible. When I'm in fucking 29 poems in the middle of the fucking desert,
1764.48s: we have no access to anything. Like you're not checking shit. That's just how it goes.
1769.60s: To summarize that broader thought that I'm happy to get more specific on whichever elements you
1774.64s: guys want to hone in on. If I were to think about how I would go about understanding what's normal,
1782.08s: I would first define the universe of what I'm looking at. And then I would research. I would say,
1789.68s: based on what exists, what can I find out? I would wait that research for the more recent data
1798.00s: from there, I would get hyper focused on things relative to a profit mechanism that fits what I'm
1806.24s: trying to do. If we're fortunate enough, we have a few profit mechanisms that we've built the same
1812.40s: context in. Then we can start moving to like second order and third order things. An example of
1820.16s: this is let's say that you're trading a cover triangle as one of your primary strategies,
1825.52s: which is generally based on a momentum factor of some sort. Your profit mechanism there is momentum.
1831.60s: So I would first focus on what are the things that define momentum? And I need to look at those
1839.92s: a lot. I need to see what they look like and into the other behave. Then from there, I can start,
1845.36s: once I have a mastery of at least the things that I think are most relevant to the profit
1850.40s: mechanism directly, then I can zoom out a click. I can say I wonder if there are things that
1857.92s: preempts changes in momentum. Maybe that brings you to something like breadth, which is
1864.24s: effectively momentum. But that's one layer removed and so on and so forth. The hard part and I really
1871.04s: wait, I really really wish that there was a good solution here for people. But I haven't thought of
1876.64s: one yet although I do think about it, it's really hard to know those things if you don't know.
1884.24s: But the good part is, is you can learn them by looking at the stuff. It's just one of the kind of
1891.12s: things that takes some time. And again, it is a shameless plug for the community. But that is one of
1896.80s: the reasons why I built a community is because if you're looking at earnings and somebody else
1902.96s: is looking at something else, then YouTube can talk about it. And you guys can share that collective
1909.04s: knowledge, which is effectively taking two people and replicating half of it so that you can at least
1916.24s: have something. But the only way that those things kind of work is if you're working with people
1921.36s: that pull their fucking weight. It's not like the thing on Reddit where people will go on to be like,
1926.08s: hey, can you explain your strategy to me? And it's like, no bitch, do the work? No, they're like,
1933.36s: here, let me just give it fuck you. There's no way. So it's the same thing when you're trying to develop
1940.56s: that base contextual understanding. It does take repetitions, but there's things you can do to
1945.36s: shortcut it. The biggest thing I would mention up front though is especially early on, you've got to
1951.84s: be focused because if you're not focused, you'll just get shoot up in all of the million things going
1957.44s: on. And it'll be, it'll feel like you're doing a lot. You'll feel probably tired, but you won't
1964.80s: have much to show for it. It's kind of like the worst of all worlds that I can think of. That's a high
1969.52s: level overview. Happy to double click on any part. Yeah, I mean, you bring a really good point about
1976.00s: repetition and just putting ourselves to observing these things frequently, right? There was another
1982.08s: discussion in a group about setting daily return targets. After much discussion and deliberation,
1988.32s: I think the group somewhat decided that maybe it's a better idea to replace the daily return
1993.60s: target and to daily routine target. So what do I do when I come back come to the desk first thing
1999.92s: in the morning, pop open the platform? I look at the economy, look at the sectors, sorry, the
2006.32s: indices, what's wall doing, what the sectors are doing, the same thing, right? The inverted
2010.32s: parameter approach of analyzing stuff. And doing that every day, it goes back to the point that
2017.36s: Chris Abdulmeiss made in your recent podcast with him about intuition. Something in our subconscious
2025.60s: are brain logs information that's not otherwise logged in the logs. That I think I thought that
2032.32s: point was really powerful and that really when we do that every day and day out and then we bring
2038.24s: it to a group discussions every weekend. That has given me added me some level of confidence to
2044.24s: synthesize my own opinion of where things are, what normal is. I don't have to anchor to opinions
2051.20s: of market commentators. What is the change to your opinion? Do I have to switch my portfolio now
2055.36s: because someone's which they're opinion on something? That's quite liberating actually.
2061.28s: I really wanted to share that with beginners to just have a process, replace any return target,
2067.44s: whatever you have that high frequency to having high frequency of information gathering,
2073.76s: kind of thing. What do you think about that? I think it's perfect. I think it actually focuses
2080.96s: on one of the broader things that I literally harp on my entire time whenever I'm doing anything
2087.12s: online. I'm glad that you give me the opportunity to do that here. It's process over outcome.
2093.68s: It's very backwards because at the end of the day, the only thing that matters is the outcome.
2100.48s: But what you will find is that I hate these kind of things because it's so nebulous to somebody
2107.76s: that doesn't have a process that doesn't understand how this works. If you do focus on the process,
2114.88s: the outcome will happen. A way to think about this is if I'm trying to learn how to shoot a basketball
2123.36s: and the only thing that I care about is balling the net, all going through the ram into the net,
2130.96s: that's the only thing I care about versus if I'm the person that's focusing on correct
2137.76s: fundamentals, which typically feel really awkward up front. The ball sometimes doesn't even
2143.84s: go anywhere near the net, no more near your desired outcome. But over time, as you refine your jump
2151.04s: shot, what you'll find is you become way more consistent and the ball will go in the net way more
2158.16s: than if you started and just focused only on putting the ball in the net. It's like that same
2165.28s: exact thing with trading because if you're only focusing on what's the positive cash flow to the
2170.96s: account, that is the epitome of a newer trader, of an inexperienced trader and somebody that is
2180.24s: absolutely focusing on the wrong things, especially like a daily piano because a daily piano
2186.48s: is probably, I don't know, I haven't run like dedicated studies on that, but I would wager that
2194.32s: it's largely outside of your control. I don't, I would imagine that there are some really short-term
2201.04s: traders that specialize in that timeframe that might not be the case for them, but I would say in
2205.44s: general that would be my guess. And it's just because really really short-term timeframes are
2209.92s: laden with all sorts of other effects going on that literally are not predictable. So I think switching
2217.28s: from some sort of daily piano target to a process is literally setting up like literally setting
2224.48s: a foundation for success. Verse says, not knowing how to shoot a ball and just continuing to just
2230.88s: purely focus on trying to get the ball in the net, you're probably shooting really close. You like
2235.52s: standing two feet away, you can get it in if you bounce it off the backboard and you love that.
2240.56s: But again, the problem is as soon as you try to do that in a game, you're going to get stuff
2245.04s: every single time and it will matter literally for nothing. In trading, it literally is the same thing.
2250.56s: You have to build those same repetitions, which can feel like they're not necessarily moving things
2256.72s: forward right away. And you might not see the direct outcome in your account right away, but it's
2263.44s: the kind of thing that if you do over time, it will typically work out much more effectively.
2270.32s: And there's one other point I want to make on that, which is the people that are typically
2275.12s: worried about daily returns or the people that are typically worried about like
2282.88s: individual trade, P&L, they typically have small accounts. And the irony there is
2290.80s: those accounts would be literally so much better off just dedicating extra time to making more money.
2298.40s: Realistically, like go door-dash, go do something because the amount that you're going to make
2304.40s: ex-annie in the market and have a meaningful impact on your small account is very low.
2312.08s: So if you find that you can't focus in that way, you might just not be ready for it.
2317.28s: It might be the perfect time to just paper trade for a bit. But the way that I would think about
2322.40s: any small account trading is that it really is nothing to do upfront with growing the small
2327.60s: account. It is everything to do with laying a bedrock to be able to trade long-term successfully.
2334.00s: Because the $5,000 account, we've talked about different versions of this in different forums, but
2340.56s: saving is your best friend. If you save a certain amount of money on a monthly basis, it's literally
2346.08s: a guaranteed return that will probably outperform whatever you can trade. Again, once you include
2351.12s: friction and fees. Going back to this idea of focusing on process versus like a daily outcome,
2358.72s: that also helps shrink the universe. Like we were talking about before, how it can be really
2363.52s: really difficult sometimes when you're trying to look at a bunch of different benchmarks and see
2369.12s: how it directly impacts your P&L and you can't necessarily get the level of detail or information
2374.72s: that you need. Everything that you find that you do in trading longer-term, it all becomes connected.
2382.40s: And if you can refine the individual pieces, that's when you refine the whole jump shot.
2388.16s: So maybe when a coach is trying to fix your busted-ass jump shot, they don't even have you jump.
2393.84s: They don't even have you bend your knees. You are literally just focused on holding the ball
2398.40s: with an upright elbow. That could be it. One hand, stuff that you'll never do in a game or
2403.52s: typically wouldn't do in a game. That's not even a full jump shot. You're just focused on one piece
2409.60s: to unfuck that and get that right. And then you can start adding another stuff, same exact thing.
2415.04s: So I think focusing on processes really, really smart, the only massive caveat to that
2421.60s: is you do have to observe outcome. And if you're focusing on process without observation of outcome,
2429.04s: your process could be fucking terrible. And you could be really, really disciplined and focusing
2435.44s: really hard on your process. But if it's not actually translating to making money at some point,
2443.76s: what's the fucking point of the process? But especially in the beginning, you have to give yourself
2448.64s: some grace. It might not always be about, oh, am I making a bunch of money? It could be that before
2456.08s: when I would plot my P&L volatility upside was up here and downside was down here. And then as I
2462.48s: started doing this more regimented approach, I kind of noticed that this only trickled down this much,
2466.64s: but this actually trickled up like quite a bit more. So now my return distribution is in here
2472.16s: versus out here. That's still a win. Even if it's not looking good, even if you're not making
2477.68s: tons and tons of money, what that shows is that the volatility of what you're doing is going down.
2483.44s: What that means is the direct output of your input is approximating, which is what has to happen.
2492.80s: So only way to know of what you're doing is ultimately working. So I completely agree with that
2498.48s: focus in that shift from daily P&L to more like a process cadence. The only massive caveat with that
2505.52s: is that it still needs to be tied to outcome observations. They just have to be taken in context.
2513.36s: Versus what most people do, which is hyper focused on them. That's why for me, like my daily P&L,
2518.64s: I see it, but I literally don't care. It doesn't even register. It's like weekly and monthly. That's what I
2523.36s: care about. Yeah, that's a really good point. What would you say are some tools new traders can
2530.16s: use to both collect and then, and then inform themselves about what is happening kind of thing
2536.88s: if we're starting to. Yeah, I think the easiest thing to start with,
2541.28s: definitely, as you mentioned before, would be the indices and volatility, because just about no
2546.32s: matter what you're doing that will impact. And those are things that you can very easily track.
2551.92s: So indices, you can literally just use a price chart, right? It shows you everything you need.
2556.48s: Same thing with some volatility, VIX is plotted for you, but that's 30 day vault. So you might
2562.00s: need to track your own seven day vault or one day vault or zero day vault or whatever other
2566.56s: periods are interesting to you. Those things I think are great starting points. From there,
2573.20s: I would use relevant tools. So if I'm looking at the indices and trying to understand how the
2582.80s: indices are doing, well, they're percent return matters. They're percent return relative to one
2588.72s: another matters. I care about broader price trend and momentum. All of those kind of things can
2595.84s: be tracked with different style indicators, but without making it overly complex, of really,
2601.68s: really, really simple way to start, especially just monitoring that the health of the indices
2607.20s: is to use a short-term moving average and a longer-term moving average. Again, relative to kind of
2612.32s: like your target time frame. So if you're looking to hold things for like a month, two months,
2619.12s: you wouldn't want to use like a one day three day moving average combination. It's to be hyperactive
2624.24s: for what you're doing. An easy way to think about that. And again, it's not perfect, but I would
2628.56s: start with something that's like maybe three times your holding window. That would be like your
2632.24s: longer term. And then something maybe like one step, one click in from your holding window.
2639.76s: Ish, that might be viable for your shorter term window. Again, it's like really, really loose
2644.88s: issues to give somebody an even fucking clue on where to start. So going back to that month example,
2651.44s: maybe I use like a two-week moving average, 10 day, and maybe like a 60-day, 50-day,
2659.60s: moving average, like probably fine to start. That kind of thing will get you started. And the other
2667.36s: thing specifically with those is that I would just not really worry too much about trying to predict
2677.20s: for the first several months of looking at it. I would literally just look at it and see what you see
2682.56s: and just write down what you see. The purpose of writing down isn't really because there's going
2687.68s: to be some sort of like massively useful information later for you to look at. It's way more just
2692.48s: to connect the learning process. We know, again, from a ton of research that note taking helps a lot.
2699.44s: So this is the kind of thing where I think it would still make sense to do in like a Google
2703.12s: sheet or Excel sheet that you could analyze more broadly. But if you feel like just jotting it down
2708.32s: on a stick, you know, I think that's fine too. Like at this point, you really just need to connect the
2712.88s: wiring. Yeah. That's how I would start with indices and volatility as well. From there, I would just
2719.36s: immediately go to the profit mechanism. So we can talk about a specific one if you want to like work
2724.40s: through one of those examples. But the way to think about the profit mechanism side of things is
2730.64s: just thinking about what's relevant to the profit mechanism. The way that you can figure out what's
2735.76s: relevant is saying stuff to yourself like what information would help me do this better. Like what
2742.32s: would I want to know if I could wave a magic wand and know everything I need to know in order
2748.24s: for this thing to, you know, for me to place an effective trade. That's not knowing the outcome.
2754.00s: Obviously, you would say I just want to know which direction it's going to go. But if you can
2758.72s: wave a magic wand and have all the details and information that you need in order to place a
2763.28s: high confidence trade, what are those details? That's probably a good intuitive spot to store
2770.32s: relative to a profit mechanism. Yeah. The profit mechanism point is really everything. And
2777.68s: like you said after the indices and wall, it just comes down to that's the driving force behind
2783.84s: all kinds of being all the different forms. But we could take an example. I think we have a few
2788.00s: minutes. What about breakout? What do you think what do you think would be signals or?
2792.32s: Yeah, it's a great, it's a great example. So when we're talking about breakout, the traditional
2799.52s: setup that I personally look for is something that has some sort of consolidation period.
2805.60s: I typically want it to be at least three days. It's not always in ideally a little bit longer
2810.00s: within specific relative ranges to itself. And then at some point, we will see price
2815.92s: breakout side of this range, typically on higher volume, yada, yada, yada. So if I'm trying to understand,
2823.12s: like just how breakout's behave, the first thing that I need to do is define what I think a
2830.72s: breakout is, just like I defined here. And let's say somebody doesn't know those details. That's
2836.24s: okay. The first thing you could do is again, go to SSRN, just look at like breakouts. The point of
2842.08s: that is to shortcut what you're trying to learn. You might not find anything. But the reason why I
2847.76s: insist on going to a place like SSRN versus X or YouTube, I wouldn't fuck with YouTube for stuff
2853.28s: like this because everything will sound good. And that's really misleading. So by focusing on
2860.72s: what's scholastically is available, that at least will be vetted to a degree. And I would start there.
2867.92s: Then after that, I would refine my idea. I would write down again what I think it is. Because for
2875.76s: example, if somebody says, oh, a breakout is when it goes up. Okay, maybe it is. Let's start there.
2881.12s: Let's pull up charts of stuff that's going up. Do these all look the same? Of course not.
2886.16s: You will see things that go up over the course of six months. But sometimes it's like
2890.24s: completely fucking sideways. They drop, they go up whatever. So we can refine off of that. We now know
2895.36s: our original statement of something that goes up is insufficient. So then what's the thing that defines
2901.60s: it? Well, six months is a little too long. I think that's too long of a timeframe for what I would
2905.92s: consider a breakout. What timeframe do I think is relevant? Maybe five days, maybe two days, maybe one
2911.44s: day. And it's that process of kind of querying. But then when you come up with something,
2919.12s: it's testing it. The problem most people have here and the easiest way to fix it, because I used
2924.40s: to do this is I would say something like, oh, a breakout is when price exceeds a recent consolidation
2932.16s: zone. Okay. And I would just look for as many instances of that as I could. The problem with that approach
2940.56s: is I'm literally just looking for what I want to see. I'm not looking for what actually defines
2947.60s: what I was just talking about. So if I'm saying something like, I'm looking for places where,
2953.68s: you know, prices higher than a recent consolidation, that means that I need to include all of the
2959.20s: instances of where something just pops just above and then the next day it's lower. And maybe
2965.12s: volume was anemic or maybe there was an earning. Right. Like, there's a million of the things that
2969.36s: that would actually capture outline that way. The main point on that piece of it is when you say
2979.04s: whatever the thing is that you look, you think you're looking for for a breakout, you need to take it
2983.52s: as what you said. So if you said, it's when price goes up, you need to look at every instance that you
2988.80s: can find in recent history with in reason of where price went up. And then you need to say what
2993.76s: are the commonalities here and again, if you start with something that's that wide open, you're going
2998.24s: to be like, oh, I don't know. And you won't know. You shouldn't know. Now you need to double click.
3003.52s: So it's it's following that process. The easiest way to do this is when you start with research
3013.28s: of some sort, it gives you some clues. It gives you some things immediately to tip you off to
3020.72s: what's relevant or not. Again, shameless plug for the community. It's one of the reasons why I started
3026.40s: it because and again, it's free. Like people can join the free side to ask questions and people
3030.80s: are super engaged there. That's by design. It's because I recognize that there are a lot of people
3036.48s: that don't have disposable income to like pay for a paid community, but they're at a point where
3041.20s: I firmly remember being at. So I will always take the time to try to help them where I can. And
3047.20s: that can be something as simple as, hey, I think I'm trying to focus on a breakout strategy. These
3052.56s: are the things that I think are relevant. These are like the conditions that seem to exist for this.
3058.48s: These are the signals that I think makes sense. Can someone just weigh in here? You'll get some feedback.
3064.08s: And if you again, aren't in a community to do that, you can try using something like a large
3069.20s: language model, chat you be tea or whatever. Again, you have to take those in context because I don't
3074.64s: know if they fix chat you be tea yet, but some of them can be like way too people please are. And
3079.28s: they can be like, yeah, that's right. And then they could like elucidate on your points. But it
3084.24s: just sends you off the wrong fucking direction because it won't just be like no bitch. You're so wrong.
3089.04s: But it's got a protector feelings. So it won't do that. Which is lame. I'm waiting for AI
3095.76s: to just be like, you're fucking idiot. That's wrong. This is what's right. That will get through
3099.68s: quickly. I think, cut through all the crap. But that that process is how you figure out what's relevant
3108.40s: to your strategy, what's relevant to your profit mechanism. And then thus, when you look at those
3115.44s: conditions, you can now figure out what's normal or what's abnormal. Right example, the recent
3122.96s: recent government shutdown play that we talked about. We defined what's normal, what's abnormal.
3130.08s: So for example, if the shutdown was announced in the market went down, I imagine most people in the
3137.20s: community would have been like, that doesn't seem right. That doesn't seem normal.
3142.56s: Just because the government ended up or is in the process of opening in the market went up.
3148.80s: Does mean it had to go up. It could have gone down. It could have gone down for a bunch of other
3152.32s: reasons. But that opens a trade idea because we would figure out why it went down instead. And then
3160.24s: you know the government opening up is a tailwind. So it tells you that whatever happened was
3164.64s: powerful enough to overcome that tailwind and push it down. Now there's another idea. But that's
3170.16s: like a perfect example of defining what normal is versus abnormal. And then it's not betting the entire
3178.16s: house on the normal condition occurring. I have no fucking idea if the stock market's going to
3183.36s: go up after the government opens. But I have a good guess. And then if that doesn't happen, then
3190.32s: I now know there's something else I need to look at. That's the broader process around a specific
3196.64s: strategy, even something like breakouts. It's understanding what normal looks like because one of the
3201.92s: things is you're researching breakouts, you'll find instances of what we refer to as failed breakouts.
3208.08s: Something that seemed to completely qualify looked good based on typical criteria with NFL's.
3213.76s: It doesn't work. And then you have to figure out, well, why? Why does this one not work?
3218.24s: Sometimes you're not going to have an answer. Sometimes you will have to acknowledge the fact that
3222.96s: you can attach something specific to this. And this is just an artifact of it. How do we know
3228.56s: then if a strategy is viable? We need to figure out how frequently those failed breakouts happen,
3233.12s: what our loss is against when they don't happen, against what our wins are. If it's still
3238.48s: net positive, still net positive, you're still okay. But that defining process is huge and it can
3246.32s: be really simple. You can just start by asking yourself some simple questions. If I were to trade
3251.92s: breakouts, what are all the pieces of information I think I would need to have in order to do this
3256.00s: successfully and take guesses. Track it and then you can see how effective they are. So for example,
3262.56s: if you say, well, I think I need like the last six months of data. Okay, right.
3267.20s: Probably not going to matter to you. But you can try it. And just see what kind of predictive
3271.68s: value it brings. But you have to be ruthless. If you don't have a basic understanding of like
3278.16s: again, like basic researching principles of how to conduct basic data analysis, a lot of this
3284.64s: stuff will be very difficult to you. And that will need to proceed all of these so that you at least have
3291.68s: some sort of approach to answer questions like this. Because if you don't do that, then not only
3298.96s: are you working in a system that you don't know what it should look like. But then you're also using
3304.96s: setup or an approach to analyze the system that you don't know what it should look like.
3310.32s: That's tough. Yeah, you can make some really good points.
3314.88s: A lot to think about and digest for various new traders. I think that wraps me up on the questions I
3321.12s: have on the topic, but just wanted to get your thoughts on what you're seeing for the rest of the
3325.60s: week, how you're thinking about it. I assume tomorrow you're going to kill yourself running the
3329.60s: hell, so something for veterans to celebrate veterans day. So I don't know what your plans are.
3335.76s: Yeah. So normally there is actually a spot on camp penultimate where the dudes carried like
3342.40s: telephone poles and stuff like that up a fire break on top of a little mountain. So it's normally
3348.40s: that. So yeah, the the body is getting fucked this week and it's just going to have to deal with it.
3353.84s: But generally speaking, I think the rest of this week, I'm really just same shit, same shit
3361.12s: different day. I'm trading earnings. I'm trading the coverage strangles as I typically do. I'm trading
3367.76s: index ball. Those are the main things that I'm focusing on right now. I'm not really worried about
3373.04s: finding breakouts. I'm not really looking for break downs. I'm not spending a ton of time looking
3377.84s: for weird options activity and like those kinds of things. And it's just because everything else
3383.36s: right now is productive enough that I don't really have a massive need for that stuff. For me,
3391.28s: coming into the end of the year, like at this point, I really just don't want massive slippage
3398.96s: because I have had an insanely good year. So one of the the dumbest things that I can do in times
3407.04s: like this is just start getting way too overzealous. Again, it's still if I see good opportunity,
3413.68s: I'll take it. But in the context of something like this week, there's a lot of weird stuff still
3419.44s: that needs to come out and go on. And as you noted earlier, we are in a very catalyst driven market.
3426.08s: So this it's one of the reasons a great example of this is the weekend trader used to run
3430.56s: a vault trade over the weekend. I haven't ran that in weeks now. And it's because of shit like yesterday.
3437.28s: Right? Like there's news that the government shutdown might be abating. And it's just like there's
3441.92s: so many instances of shit like that going on right now that that's again, understanding what looks
3448.80s: abnormal compared to what looks normal. And there's a chance that what currently looks
3455.36s: abnormal becomes the new normal. But we'll have to see. I don't know yet. I'm not expecting that.
3462.48s: So we still have earnings season. I would say that that's that's the main thing for me.
3467.28s: That's good. You tell that.
3470.24s: Beautiful. Well, thanks so much, Shrey, for disjacking and serving is kind of like a conduit.
3475.84s: It's it's super useful. I appreciate the time that you put into this and then also that the
3481.04s: community is spending it's one of the really cool things is somebody that is in like a teaching
3486.48s: side of the lens is like seeing what happens, right? And how this stuff that's being taught is
3492.16s: functionally applied, especially in something like trading because trading it's like you can talk
3498.08s: about stuff. But then you can have people that go out, place an earnings trade and something that
3503.68s: that's a curious choice. So it's very interesting. That's right. I would blame it on somebody else
3510.88s: it's the right move. But that it's really interesting with trading. So yeah, I always enjoy the
3516.32s: chats. Thank you for doing these. And then for everybody else, again, we're doing these once a month.
3520.96s: So you can check us out in about another month. And we all have linked to the episodes in the
3528.32s: description for anybody wants to check those out. But otherwise, we are wrapping up.
3533.68s: Thanks for hanging out. And thanks, Ray. For doing what you do. Thank you for that.
