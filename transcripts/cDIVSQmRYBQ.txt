0.00s: What's up, everyone? Eric here. Welcome back to the outlier podcast. I have Tom saws and off back in the house again
6.98s: I think we talked last year, but welcome back. It's great to see you again
10.74s: Hey, thanks. I don't even remember when the last time it was so I'm good
14.62s: Well, I can only imagine how much media you do. It's just kind of got to like be a blur in front of your face after a while
21.34s: Yeah, you know, it's funny you you look back at your life and you think that was never part of the game plan never
30.00s: I bet actually speaking of the game plan. I was listening to a recent interview of
34.88s: Years where you're talking about that finance wasn't even necessarily the initial target for you
41.18s: It kind of was an opportunity that emerged that you then took advantage of what what was the target like what did you think you were going to do?
49.24s: Oh, I was for sure going to be in I in my mind. I was for sure going to be in some form of
55.68s: of
58.56s: some form of government like I
62.22s: Was studying political science, but I was interning for you know in in the house of commons in the UK
71.52s: I was interning in upstate New York at the you know in New York New York that in their own
78.64s: You know state government and working for a lobbyist and for state senators and I was for sure like some form
85.62s: of either international relations or
88.50s: Some form of politics. I loved you know studying you know parliamentary studies and and different kinds of government studies
96.56s: And I figured you know I could do this lobbyist thing I could do this, you know and and and if all failed I could go back to law school
103.36s: But that wasn't what I wanted to do
106.86s: So I was I was a hundred percent
110.40s: Pretty sure that I was going into some form of you know, I don't know some form of government
115.90s: Interesting. So do you have any like pet projects where you're involved in government on the side or like did that just completely detach?
123.82s: It's attached, you know, I got bit by a bug in
129.96s: I got bit by a bug in when I got out of school and
134.42s: In the world of finance. It was kind of like you know, I just got bit
140.10s: mostly because of the trading floor I would say but I think once I stepped foot on
145.66s: Once I stepped foot kind of in the world of trading
148.74s: I just couldn't look any I know where else was interesting to me and
153.82s: And then when I stepped foot on the trading floor the whole thing just came, you know, it was it was apparent. It was clear
159.42s: I that's where I needed to be. I didn't know how to I was gonna get there, but that's where I needed to be
164.78s: Interesting so when you realize that you're going down finance
168.34s: Did you have kind of some sort of big road map and just so you understand the
173.20s: Pramble that I'm kind of starting to get into as you talk a lot about decision cycles
177.26s: So I'm kind of like peeking into the way you think about decisions balancing two different things having some sort of plan and a road map
183.94s: But also taking advantage of opportunities going back to the
188.04s: Younger, you know, I was a little younger. I was a little I've always been kind of impulsive
193.48s: But but I don't think I had this I don't think I had a grand
197.92s: I don't I don't think I had this
199.92s: This blueprint or this road map all laid out in my early 20s
205.12s: But I think that you know, like I said as soon as I got to the trading floor
210.36s: I knew that there was something special about that environment, you know between open-out cry and
217.80s: And just you know just pure speculation
222.24s: Six seven eight hours a day non-stop action. I mean you can't do anything else
226.92s: It was like a giant locker room. I love the giant locker room, you know situation and
232.04s: It was kind of an extension of like, you know childhood sports and all that kind of stuff and I
238.00s: I couldn't imagine at that point doing anything else. I had to survive like it was I was I was freaking
245.48s: I'm gonna
246.72s: fucking survive this thing if it kills me, but I'm gonna survive this business and
251.64s: You know and I did luckily
253.84s: Was like when you were first starting out on the floor a lot of times people think that it's automatic money
258.00s: If you get to see, you know, then you just go in there and you make buckets of money and it's all gravy
262.84s: But you know the people I've spent a while you know reading because I've never had that direct experience
267.40s: But I'd love to hear from you what it was like when you first started
271.76s: It was
273.60s: Incredibly intimidating at first because
277.60s: everybody
279.12s: Like nobody wants you there like you can imagine, you know
283.12s: Imagine there's a big pot of money and if there's if there's a thousand people right then they split it a thousand ways
291.08s: But if there's a thousand and one people
293.88s: Persons they have to split it a thousand and one ways so every time you had people to the equation, you know, everybody hates you
302.76s: so
304.76s: I always like love to tell the story of my my first day ever on the floor and
309.44s: I didn't really know what to expect. I was just really excited about you know about being in Chicago and being on the trading floor and
317.64s: You know all these little pits all over the place and people were screaming and yelling and I had to pick a spot the trade
322.68s: So I walked up this pit. It was a national semiconductor, which is no longer exists and the symbol was MSN at the time
330.04s: This is like the early 80s and there was only like five or six guys in the pit maybe seven guys and
335.44s: and
336.64s: I stood there for while and nobody I'll talk to you or look at you or anything. You know, they just they just scowl at you and
343.40s: This one guy this one kid he was a clerk and he was kind of nice kid and you know
348.44s: He said hey, what's your name? I shook his hand. He was a clerk. I wasn't a trader and I said where I was from
353.48s: So it's from white planes New York and and he goes oh me and my brother and his brother was a trader
359.08s: He was clerk or his brother because he was too young to trade and because my brother we were we used to live in white planes
364.72s: And so it goes this is my brother. This is my brother David and so he so I go hey David and I put my hand out to shake his shake his hand
371.76s: He goes fuck you
375.76s: It was it right at that moment. I realized okay
380.04s: This is my first interaction with anybody on that floor and it was at that moment when I realized okay
385.68s: This is how the game is played now for me personally
388.96s: You know, I'm a pretty I was pretty fixed a pretty thick and I was like okay. This does not bother me. This actually
395.60s: Entries me
398.20s: Because I just I just didn't really understand how how how vicious and violent everything was and and then at that point I realized okay
407.52s: This is how we're gonna play the game and I really have to you know
410.32s: There's a lot I have a lot to learn and it was a learning process the first year was a learning process and
417.56s: And after that, you know, I realized about 95 or 97% that people don't make it
424.92s: But I never wanted that to be an option with me so I don't know some reason I made it. I think my personality
433.00s: I had the right personality and the right mentality for for the trading floor. It all it is is you know a couple in Chicago
441.56s: There was about three or four different trading floors and there's about you know
445.48s: Seven or eight thousand alpha males and they're all the same exact people just different slightly different heights different
451.64s: Different colors, you know different backgrounds, but they were essentially all separated birth
457.72s: everybody and so
460.36s: You know, I fit right into that crowd and you know, that's where
465.24s: You know that the I have the same friends is crazier's gonna sound
469.48s: Tony who I do the show with every day today and J.J. Who you know who I work with into the show and Scott and everything we've all been friends
480.60s: From when we traded in the S&P 100 pit together from the early 80s
484.92s: We've been friends for 40 years and we all met randomly just you know down there
490.20s: You know, we built multiple businesses together and done everything, but it's funny how we've all just stayed friends
495.32s: Because we're so we're so alike on every level. We're the same people basically
499.96s: It's how traders are all the same people traders all marry the same kind of women the women are all nuts the traders are all nuts
508.60s: Their whole lives are just insane and you know and if you survive, okay, it's fine
515.16s: Yeah, there's a lot in cut. It's it's funny. You say that because anytime my wife meets any of my military friends
520.68s: She always says the same exact thing that we're all this it's the same it literally is the same thing like we're all the same people
525.96s: You're just the average you know all of us are some average of the people that we hang out with
532.36s: So if you hang out with 10 or 12 people you are just gonna be part of that group there are no outliers
537.88s: You know, they're like you're just you're some version either higher or lower off the mean of that of your small group of friends and and in the trading world
545.80s: You know it was always like that we you know, I just was lucky
550.20s: In it just it fit my personality. I didn't when I was growing up. I didn't know that world existed
555.80s: You know when I got to Chicago in my early 20s
559.40s: I realized that there was a world I never knew of and I happened to be good at it and and so you know
565.88s: That was the next I'm still in the business. It's been 40 you know 40s to 43 years
571.96s: Yeah
573.56s: random question, but obviously you can look up different numbers online and whatnot
577.56s: but like for like a first two or three years trading
582.04s: Is there like huge upside proper potential for traders that they're like oh man, I'm so close to this
587.16s: There's a more like investment banking or something where you kind of know you have a bit of a roadmap
591.08s: But once you get to a certain point you can start making a bunch of money like how do how do traders view their pricing early on and then the trajectory
598.92s: Well that world does the world I grew up in on the trade for it doesn't exist anymore
603.24s: So there is no such thing as that as that world
606.36s: I mean, you know that world was that was a unique time in history that will never exist ever again
613.16s: You know where there's the the the open-out cry era of
618.20s: Pitch trading in Chicago
620.28s: Was something that will never be replicated. It's never gonna happen. That was the last frontier of
627.40s: True individualistic capitalism. I mean that was the last frontier of you know
633.24s: brutally violent capitalism and it's at its at its fiercest, you know
638.84s: Most introductory level and anybody could participate. I mean, you know when I first started out
645.24s: I you know I come from a very middle-class background and and I didn't know
650.60s: You know, I mean I came to Chicago at $1,500 in my pocket like it wasn't like I came a lot of money
655.08s: And so I had no idea
657.08s: You know what to you know really what to expect or what to think about you know the the business and
663.56s: You know, so I figured well if you make you know if I can make a hundred grand, you know
668.68s: That would be great and then after one year. I'm like, you know
671.88s: I need to make in the trading business. It's a little different and you can't explain to somebody else
676.04s: But we used to say like you know if we make a million dollars and we lose a million dollars
681.00s: We're actually down a million dollars because you're lifestyle
684.92s: so
686.36s: You know after a couple of years, you know, I was starting to make you know
690.84s: I mean insane amount of money because
694.52s: First of all there was a lot of opportunity and second if you were good
697.08s: There was a lot of opportunity and second, you know, I had no idea that you could make you know this kind of money
703.00s: You know like you know hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars a year, you know by the time you're 25 years old
709.40s: It's insane back then in the early 80s. So we did it was it was a different world
714.76s: I couldn't ever I didn't even tell my parents what I did for a living. They thought I was a drug dealer probably I have no idea
720.28s: You know, I mean it's not a far cry, right? Like you guys
726.92s: I go mom thinking me as a stockbroker, baby something like that, you know like like just except I except I work for myself, you know and um
734.68s: Um
735.80s: So you just take at that point you take a ridiculous. I mean we would take so much risk like I probably took
742.92s: 100 times the risk back then with no money that I take today 100 times
747.72s: And is that some of it because you hadn't seen enough to like really appreciate the risk there?
752.60s: It wasn't because you were just yeah, I had you know you're young you're you're young your brash you're kind of stupid
758.84s: You're you know, you're definitely immature you
762.12s: You you've never lost so you don't know what losing's like
765.72s: um and you think you're absolutely invincible like there's no question you think you're invincible
771.96s: And and you think you're bigger than the market like there was you couldn't intimidate
776.60s: You know, I would say of thousands of traders on the floor
780.36s: That anybody that was a survivor you couldn't intimidate them. There was no number that could intimidate
785.32s: They were all
786.68s: Crazy, so that was just a different world. It's totally changed. I don't think that world will you know ever exist again
793.32s: But I guess you know for me. I was in the right place the right time
797.16s: Which leads me to my follow on and that's why I wanted to understand what that landscape was like for you
800.92s: Because then obviously a time came up where you moved on
803.80s: Why did you move on from there? Is it just because you saw it changing or was there other opportunity? Yeah, yeah
809.00s: So in in the late 90s so I started trading in the early 80s like 81-ish
815.48s: um and
817.40s: You know, it was still pretty the
820.04s: The option market price was only a couple years old. It was still pretty crude. There was lots of you know
824.28s: It was it was very different world, but by the late 90s, you know, it had become a more established, you know financial
830.76s: derivative and
833.64s: And you could tell that the technology was getting
837.72s: Better and better and there were new exchanges popping up and we were about to go, you know, you know
842.60s: They're pure electronic exchanges and and and I had also been standing there almost you know 19 years in the same spot
849.40s: and at that point I'm thinking
852.68s: You know, this has been a great run, but there's got to be more life than you know standing here trying to make a hundred eighths
858.36s: Or a hundred quarters, you know, whatever you know, $1,250 or $2,500 or $5,000 or whatever it was
864.84s: You know, and so I started to just I was I didn't really I wasn't really taking this deep introspective look at my life
872.36s: I was just saying you know, you know, you know, there's there's more to it and
877.16s: You know, we had started managing some money. We had started some other businesses and I just
883.48s: One day stepped outside the pit and turned to my buddy Scott. We were partners and said, you know, I got an idea
890.20s: Let's do something different and the idea was thinkorsund and
894.20s: That started us in a you know, and Scott and I had done a lot of different investments together
898.28s: But this time, you know, it was like okay, we're gonna do something that we actually, you know, understand and
905.00s: And we're gonna we're gonna roll the dice and take all the money that we've made over the last, you know, 10 15 years and
911.08s: You know, and see we can build
913.56s: Because it's time to do some different
915.56s: That was in like the late 90s for you right early 2000s. I was 1999. Yeah, okay
920.36s: And then word on the street was when you guys first designed thicker swim it came out and it didn't have charts
925.96s: Is that accurate? That's accurate
928.68s: So when you guys were building that
931.64s: Obviously you had a different picture of what the retail trader was gonna be focused on and then obviously they informed you otherwise
939.08s: What was that process like developing this product and then getting that kind of feedback so so
944.76s: we're not
947.32s: We're not good listeners would be the easiest way to explain this
950.68s: We were never good listeners. We were very we were very aggressive decision makers, but we were never good listeners
957.32s: And when we built thicker swim
959.32s: We had all these ideas about you know like what a what a trading platform should look like
964.68s: But it was nothing like any other trading platform that had ever been built before
968.44s: and we had these brilliant
970.92s: coders and these brilliant
972.68s: designers
973.72s: designers in Chicago coders all over and we
977.80s: We felt like oh my god. We're building something like we knew
982.04s: We're building something special because we didn't listen to what anybody else said like we totally went our own direction
988.52s: And we knew that was the right thing to do and we got the platform basically built you know, we're like
995.32s: Somebody came to us. They said where's the charting package and we go who uses charts like
1000.76s: We have been trading for 20 years and never looked at a chart
1003.72s: Nobody on the trading force ever looked at a chart
1006.52s: So to us this whole concept of charts was like voodoo
1010.36s: You know, we're like who the hell looks at charts and somebody said to you they go
1014.12s: Every retail customer that took an education course in trading looks at charts
1019.00s: That's all they do is sell charting courses
1021.16s: And I'm like you've got to be freaking kidding me. They go yeah all these experts. They're all chartists
1025.32s: I go
1026.12s: I have never met a technician in my entire life
1029.48s: Or I mean, of course I met some but I was like but I'd like nobody uses charts the in the trading floor
1035.32s: There's we're we're butt up against each other. There's no room for chart. There's no charting
1039.88s: There's nothing there's nothing charting was to be the dumbest thing ever to me because
1044.28s: Because because markets were all driven by order flow and charting had nothing to do with anything and so
1051.32s: So none of us building this platform had ever thought about putting charts in so we're like
1055.80s: Ah shit now. What do we do? You know like you like people are gonna say they want charts and they're gonna bug us about charts
1062.44s: so we went out and we made a deal with Tim night at profit charts and
1068.84s: And we made a deal we licensed his charts and we put profit charts in the platform to start off with and
1074.84s: Just to you know appease the customers and it worked fine
1078.44s: And then we built our own charting platform which a lot of people consider to be the best in any you know in any online brokerage platform
1085.56s: We built our own just to you know just so we had two charting platforms in the end
1089.72s: but we never spent
1092.12s: Like we built it for the customers
1094.28s: But and we've been teaching options and teaching classes for 20 years and doing everything imaginable content wise
1100.44s: We've never done one thing on technical analysis
1102.68s: So it definitely and if you know tasty it has nothing to do with tasty. It's not important what we do
1108.28s: so
1110.28s: You know and we've definitely weaned customers off of the whole concept of charts and everything else and we've done
1115.64s: You know more to kill technical analysis than anybody else in the world. So I feel calm. I feel good about that
1121.40s: but
1123.00s: You know even to this day, you know, I mean, I mean, I'll look at a chart occasion to see where a stock was or has been but not for any indicators or anything
1131.72s: You know, I mean, it doesn't mean anything to us. We are
1135.32s: Everything we do is focused on looking forward and and using derivative pricing to give us you know basically
1145.48s: Probableistic outcomes based on current derivatives pricing. We couldn't care less about you know
1151.32s: What's happened in the past? It we believe markets are random and they're efficient and it doesn't mean anything to us
1157.32s: But anyway, that's a funny story because you know, we had to we had to learn
1161.32s: We had to learn on the fly
1163.32s: Well, I thought it was hilarious that you guys spend time, you know building this really robust platform and then somebody was just like where the fucking charts
1170.28s: Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what happened
1172.92s: and and it wasn't even and the crazy thing was
1176.36s: We got it wasn't like early on in the process like we launched without charts
1181.80s: Like we launched the damn platform and and and and because nobody in our office every single person we hired came from the training floor
1190.52s: And nobody thought it was weird not to have charts
1193.96s: It's like we all looked each other like how come nobody say anything about this and we're like because nobody's ever used it
1199.64s: We didn't have one person there that ever used a chart before
1202.92s: So like oh god, we got to go stram scrambled for charts
1207.00s: We did we did and we did it all and it was like you know
1211.48s: But yeah, that was that was a funny part of building a finger son
1216.68s: Yeah, yeah, I think it's it's really interesting and I you know
1219.96s: I think the the whole
1221.64s: Technical analysis conversation is only interesting. I know you've had that discussion of gigillion times
1226.44s: So I won't worry with that
1227.96s: But I do think you bring up a more interesting point that I'd like to linger on for a moment is just essentially using
1233.40s: derivatives pricing as a better projection of future potential
1237.24s: And I've always viewed that as kind of like crowdsourcing
1240.92s: Future probabilistic outcomes using the entire market consensus
1245.00s: Well, that's also that's essentially what it is. I mean you're using
1248.68s: You're using the totality of all the money that's out there
1252.68s: You know pricing different things and you have to assume that it's the whole
1257.40s: You know essentially law of large numbers or or just you know
1261.80s: Just if you take enough guesses at how many jelly beans are in the jar eventually somebody's gonna get it
1266.68s: Hmm right. Yeah, yeah, I think it's it's kind of the way that I've gone about using technical analysis
1273.56s: I think obviously for retail traders
1275.64s: It's you know some of them I think are like very heavily reliant on it
1279.64s: But I do think for a lot of us it is good for context
1283.08s: And I think you've done a pretty good job actually finding that midline in terms of calling it an engagement tool right?
1287.88s: I think engagement tools context
1290.04s: We don't have any issue with with it. It's just you know, we're not gonna waste a lot of our you know
1295.40s: We're not gonna waste a lot of resources on stuff that yeah, we're about
1301.48s: figuring out
1303.80s: Optimal mechanics for helping people to you know to create wealth
1308.20s: I'm not you know, I'm not in the business of you know of anything else other than you know facilitating opportunity and facilitating wealth creation
1317.40s: And I just think there's better ways to do it
1319.48s: Yeah, yeah, so one of the things I wanted to ask you specifically on that vein um is
1325.88s: I know that you've talked a lot about this idea of pot odds and your background when you were a caddy and you had that
1333.56s: I think it was a caddy master I forgot what their term is the dude that runs you guys
1337.08s: And he used to take you guys for all your money and one of the things he used to do is essentially wait to play the game
1342.12s: Where you guys are throwing stuff into the bucket until it was full enough right? So he has this asymmetric risk profile
1348.04s: Yeah, how do you think traders have an opportunity to seek that that similar kind of asymmetric risk profile specifically using
1356.36s: Predate style strategies that are kind of risk defined right at well that risk undefined capital
1362.44s: Income defined right out of the gate. I'm curious if
1366.20s: There's any parallel between the way you think about that or is it just a number of occurrences thing
1370.92s: No, no there is a parallel. It's not in just number of occurrences. We look at it as as you know, probably
1377.72s: istically regardless of uh
1380.76s: Regardless of whatever environment we're in volatility-wise
1384.68s: Probablyistically everything you know
1387.48s: Stragiwise tends to be the same regardless of the IV environment
1391.40s: but
1392.60s: When you have an opportunity to do something in higher IV you can make more money and that effectively means
1399.56s: You know, that's our argument for pot odds in a from a premium sellers perspective
1404.36s: We also like the concept of you know, a very subjective part of pot odds is is just price extreme
1411.32s: So you know our preferences when something is up big to sell it when something's down
1416.28s: You know big to buy it only because there is the perception
1421.08s: That you know, maybe you know, there's there's something's down big
1424.60s: Maybe it's got more upside the downside and if something's up big
1427.80s: Maybe it's got more downside than upside the reality of that is that's a very tough argument to prove
1434.28s: Because when something's up big it still has the same chance of going up higher than it does coming down
1439.24s: We don't necessarily believe in mean reversion on price and it's the same thing on downloads
1444.20s: But at least it gives you again. It's another form of an engagement tool
1448.44s: The only thing that truly gives you a real pot odds advantage is
1454.36s: Is doing certain things and incredibly high-ply volatility you take more risk you make more money
1459.40s: Period right no
1461.40s: Yeah, I think I saw a recent segment where you guys were talking about price mean reversion
1467.64s: And I definitely am the counter side to that. I definitely think that they're short-term price mean reversion
1473.56s: But I'm more curious about your perspective
1476.44s: So if you're a contrarian, but you don't believe in short-term price mean reversion isn't that a contradiction?
1483.80s: It is
1485.00s: Okay fair enough
1487.48s: It is but there's a big difference between a short-term trade and you know
1492.92s: It is a contradiction it is a contradiction
1495.64s: But it's it's it's the whole the whole idea of being a contrarian
1501.32s: It this stems back to this stems back to our days on the floor when you're essentially the counter party to everything somebody else wants to do
1509.64s: So the the misconception about floor traders is that
1513.72s: Is that you're just you're trading based on what you think the market's gonna do and that's not how it works
1518.92s: floor traders
1521.56s: All they did was take the other side of orders
1524.28s: so
1525.40s: You don't come in in the morning with an opinion of the market's going up and down
1529.24s: You you go ahead and the pit in the morning in the first person if the first order is to sell calls you buy
1534.12s: And the first orders to buy calls you sell them and then you work around those trades over the course of the day
1539.24s: And that's how you basically make or lose you know money
1542.44s: So you do not control what you want to do you basically participate in what the other side of everything
1549.24s: so the whole
1550.76s: Idea of being a counterparty
1553.00s: Stuff with me my entire career into this day
1555.88s: You know, I effectively look at myself as the counterparty whatever you want to do. I'll take the other side as long as you give me a little bit of edge
1563.96s: Mm-hmm. I dig it. So that's not really kind of the classic
1569.80s: That's not necessarily mean reversion. It's more about just playing the role of the counterparty
1575.72s: Right
1576.76s: You mentioned something that I'm actually really curious about just from like a
1580.92s: Study perspective, but how would you manage your book throughout the day?
1583.80s: So as you're taking obviously order flow you're taking an inventory
1587.24s: You have like
1588.44s: Tissers no room on the floor, right? So are you just like legit memorizing this stuff?
1592.44s: Or do you have like a piece of paper that you're like what's the method both piece of paper and piece of paper and memorizing you
1598.52s: You'd be surprised
1600.20s: your capacity to
1603.72s: To know like you know what you're doing
1607.32s: Traders had floor traders. We have very
1610.84s: One-dimensional brains like you know these were not you know most of us
1616.04s: I'm including myself in this group. We're not very deep thinkers
1619.88s: but when it came to
1622.52s: frack
1623.56s: adding and subtracting fractions and
1626.20s: memorizing thousands of trades and positions
1629.56s: You're like a savant and so you can you can literally make I don't know there are days probably made
1635.96s: I made 500 or a thousand trades easy and I could remember everything I did with every
1640.76s: person I did it with and how it affected every single position I had on and you you almost
1646.04s: You know surprisingly almost never make a mistake
1649.32s: And that sounds like probably a source of your edge right because then it speeds up your ability to make decisions more quickly
1654.68s: Everything is speed everything is speed so you know there was there was there's no way in that business
1663.00s: To be successful if you weren't fast the the fastest person
1667.48s: The fastest person got everything and you had to be fast and you couldn't you know the whole thing was
1674.60s: Fast and don't don't think about it. There's nothing to think about
1678.60s: You know you had to just be fast
1680.60s: It's one of the the great parallels I honestly see between like military members and investing in trading
1686.52s: It's that like we always talk about you know making an 80% decision now executed violently is better than a 100% decision later down the line
1695.00s: It's like a lot of these same you know parallels yeah of course if you wait for the 100% decision you're basically out of business
1703.00s: Right, you know there's no there is no there's no way to there's nobody who creates well with 100% decisions
1711.88s: I mean you know I do a whole I do a speech on
1716.92s: On this topic and the difference between and it's one of my favorite talks to give
1723.48s: Because the difference between
1725.64s: Success one you know the difference between two people that are virtually the same person
1731.56s: And the difference between one person being successful and the next person not being and they basically do everything the same
1738.84s: It's it essentially comes down to this very marginal difference
1744.12s: Between person A and person B incredibly marginal difference and and the marginal difference is based on longevity
1752.20s: And longevity is just the ability to stay in the game longer than everybody else
1757.72s: Because it's not
1759.16s: When when it really falls down to it we're not we're talking about milliseconds
1763.32s: And we're talking about everybody being smart everybody being having the same personality the same kind of skill set
1770.20s: And the real difference is just like you know, it's a blue single
1774.68s: It's a couple of blue singles
1776.36s: You know one one batter has six blue singles and bats 302 and the other batter
1781.80s: It has gets robbed you know six times over the course of the year and they bat you know 256
1788.44s: And it's just it's basically 12 or 15 at bats that make the whole difference
1792.84s: And it's it's crazy, but trading is very similar and it's it's a longevity game and it's fast decision-making and it's and it's whoever makes the decision
1804.76s: That's willing to accept
1806.60s: Essentially the lowest odds so like if you think it's if it's 50 50 you don't make it if it's 70 30
1814.20s: You make it and if somebody jumps in front of you and does the 68 32 and they're right they make it more
1821.08s: You know and if somebody waits for 80 20 in their favor, which is great, but they might not make enough
1826.44s: They might get enough trades. They might not be successful enough
1829.40s: It might not be worth it for waiting for that person waits for 100% forget it. They're out of business
1834.20s: Right
1835.48s: So when you're making this distinction between speed to decision
1840.84s: How do you balance the idea of making a quick decision, but also not making a bad decision, right?
1846.52s: Yeah, that's really so so the answer to that is there are there's no such thing
1851.24s: You know, there's no such thing as you you cannot you cannot think about making a bad decision because
1857.32s: Bad decisions are just it's a fact in an efficient world
1862.76s: You are going to make extra number of bad decisions. You just have to make way more good decisions than bad decisions
1869.64s: You know people
1870.84s: Talk to us all the time when we give talks about you know entrepreneurship and success and things like that
1876.44s: And they say you know like what what's your what's your real differentiator like like why why you guys or why you
1884.28s: And the answer is always because
1887.48s: We
1888.68s: Take risk at every opportunity we get no matter what
1891.88s: Like even if we don't really want to do it we do it like every single chance you have to take risk
1897.80s: You should as long as it's not like stupid stuff, you know like as long as you're not risking your life type thing
1902.68s: But if it's a reasonable play where you could assess some kind of probabilistic outcome that's in your favor to it you do it
1910.84s: And then some stuff's not going to work. It's okay. Doesn't work
1915.24s: Well, and it seems like it's actually funny a lot of what you talk about it. Ryan's your stoses
1919.88s: I don't know if you practice any of that
1921.40s: But you you have a lot of those tenants at least baked in what you're talking about because one of the things is
1927.16s: You know reviewing past decisions for observing an outcome seeing you know kind of post mortem
1932.84s: But not dwelling on it and I think that that's one of the things I see
1936.20s: Happened with a lot of traders is there's this tremendous dwelling cycle where if something goes poorly
1942.28s: Now they're you know kind of in this vicious cycle
1945.40s: Of thinking of everything they did wrong and then it kind of makes it very difficult
1948.92s: To make a good decision going forward. Do you think traders overcome that by just kind of embracing this decision cycle
1956.12s: Is it successful detachment from their investing capital like what kind of things go into being able to accept a bad decision
1962.84s: That was made apply the learning lesson and move on
1966.52s: Well, I think yeah, it's all of the above. I don't think it's you know, it's not necessarily just traders
1971.96s: There's great entrepreneurs that are able to you know accomplish the same thing
1976.68s: You know, they where they they don't dwell on you know, they can't they don't dwell and they can't do all the losers and they have to you know
1984.68s: um
1985.56s: They have to build off their their good decisions their winning decisions. I do think that life is
1991.80s: Um that success is really success in light is a byproduct of the number of decisions that you make
1999.24s: Because eventually if you get comfortable you can scale your decision making and so you know you you end up
2005.48s: Which is kind of what happened to us is that
2009.00s: We start off making you know
2011.00s: tens of thousands of trading decisions
2013.24s: But then you get to a point where you start to say okay
2016.20s: You know this some of this decision now we're going to go beyond trading
2019.40s: And they're going to go into building a business and they're going to go into doing other things and what we found is
2024.60s: That most of the time when we made decisions to do other things they worked out as well
2030.68s: Which is crazy, but we we had no idea that that's the way everything worked
2034.68s: But it we figured it out that the more decisions you make the more good decisions you make
2041.24s: I think that that
2042.52s: Follows up with every bit of literature I've read on that from a psychological perspective because we read a lot of
2047.40s: Decision cycle stuff especially like marine officers right we spend a lot of time learning things like
2051.72s: Boyd's decision cycle we read things like blank all that kind of stuff anyways
2055.48s: Just a lot of background
2057.08s: Really
2057.96s: Amplifies that point and I think what you
2060.76s: Highlight there succinctly has been proven time and time again, which is really interesting
2064.52s: It's like the law of momentum it applies to a lot of this just it's it's easy to read about it's hard to execute
2070.28s: The challenge you know the challenge that that you have is you have to put yourself
2074.04s: In a position where you can execute it and that's that's the challenge because if you're too young
2079.88s: You don't have enough experience you don't have enough capital to withstand you know the volatility of those decisions early on
2086.28s: And and if you wait too long
2088.20s: You know you kind of miss that that that opportunistic, you know
2095.08s: Your your chance you missed that window and so you know there's there's there's a pretty big window
2101.24s: Maybe it's 10 20 30 40 years, but it's you know
2106.92s: There's a lot of things that have to play out
2108.52s: But you you have to make those decisions like the thing I impress upon everybody's just you know
2113.80s: Make as many damn decisions that you can you know speculate take risk make as many decisions that you can
2118.84s: Never comes back to haunt you and I'm not talking about dumbass stuff like you know
2122.44s: I'm not gonna about going to a casino and betting you know on the roulette, you know on the roulette wheel
2126.84s: It's that's not it. We're talking about other things where you know where you're not giving up odds to the house
2133.32s: Right
2134.28s: So you guys recently sold
2137.16s: Tasty traitor iG. I saw you know obviously well not super recently, but you know
2141.64s: Two years ago we sold it years ago. Yeah semi recently. It was a huge deal. It was like a 1.1 billion dollar deal
2148.52s: um and
2150.52s: I'm just fascinated on how that deal even works. So obviously I've read all about it, but like
2157.24s: From a behind the curtains perspective does somebody give you a call? Do you give somebody a call to even start this conversation?
2164.12s: Like how does it? I because I'll never see that kind of deal. So I'm so curious how it goes down
2169.08s: Well surprisingly in my life. It's happened multiple times. So like so I've gotten you know
2176.12s: So it doesn't surprise me anymore, but the funny thing about
2180.12s: So so I should tell you first about us. I have
2183.32s: We have this rule
2184.92s: It's called a no high five rule
2186.92s: Which is which is we we don't ever
2192.04s: We're never impressed with what we do like it's just you're suppose
2195.88s: I always say you're supposed to graduate kindergarten. Well, you're supposed to build successful businesses
2200.60s: But we we never have an exit strategy
2204.68s: I when somebody built something and they tell me they have an exit strategy
2207.96s: I get really nervous about what they're building because then they're focusing on an exit strategy
2212.84s: We never have an exit strategy
2214.84s: We're just traders. So if somebody's willing to pay us
2220.12s: Maybe more than we think we're worth will listen. That's an exit strategy
2224.36s: But until that happens, you know, there is nothing
2228.04s: When we sold fingerswim there were
2231.32s: Three companies bidding for us in cash, but for the prior
2234.84s: Ten years like we basically didn't have a single person talk to us
2238.36s: When we sold tasty
2240.52s: For we built in 2011 we sold it in 2021
2243.88s: For ten years not one person
2246.60s: Talk to us about tasty now one person
2249.24s: Now one firm not one anybody talk to us about tasty like not nobody
2253.80s: Nobody had any interest in the firm whatsoever. They're like what are you doing? This is a crazy idea
2257.80s: This is this and it's not a flammable. You know all the same crap
2261.72s: The only person that invested in us was a firm
2265.16s: That had invested in thicker son. They made so much money that they were like we'll invest in anything you want to do
2270.12s: So it wasn't like and and they were like they were like we hate this idea
2274.20s: Like you're building a financial network none of this makes any sense. We would never invest in this in a million years
2281.08s: Except we're just investing in you. That's all
2284.20s: So
2286.20s: It even worked out better for them than the first trade but but the interesting thing is that we
2294.28s: Ten years in just like the first time ten years in
2297.32s: Um, which is just weird that they both happen ten years in there was like
2301.80s: All of a sudden out of the woodwork
2303.80s: Like we started some company reached out to us than another company reached out to us
2307.40s: It's almost like all these investment bankers talked to each other and then another company
2311.40s: And next thing you know, we had five people bidding for tasting and when that happened
2316.28s: we knew we were like
2319.08s: And it was also the height of the SPAC movement and everything else and at that point
2323.32s: we knew that
2325.48s: There was a likelihood that something might happen
2328.04s: Because we had multiple bids for the company and and we know we also knew we're a great company
2333.80s: So it wasn't like you know didn't shock us. We're like oh my god, you know, we wasn't we're like we built the best technology
2340.20s: We have one of the best companies in the world for boutique brokerage, you know boutique financial service firm
2344.84s: So this shouldn't be a shocker, but um, but there were five companies bidding for us and we kind of
2350.68s: You know went through a process of
2354.04s: We took the second lowest bid
2356.76s: Believe it or not because we didn't trust the SPAC markets. We thought they were all bullshit
2361.88s: And so I and I turned out to be right um and
2366.36s: We went with a company that we didn't really know much about but that
2372.04s: We felt that we could expand globally with and they seem like nice people and that's why you know
2378.52s: I mean like you don't actually know
2380.68s: But it seemed like there's a time to do a deal
2383.40s: and
2384.44s: You know 10 years into a project, you know, you kind of you kind of want to
2388.92s: Mix things up a little bit do something a little different
2391.72s: Sure, especially if you think there's a catalyst that can help you guys evolve even faster
2395.56s: So what we're like some of the primary questions you are asking yourselves along the process like it obviously the right partner
2403.40s: Part of the decision, but it sounds like what's the best catalyst for you guys or is there something else that you're weighing heavily on
2410.12s: You know
2411.32s: It's it's funny because you don't really
2414.52s: You never know like when you're making a deal with somebody you really don't know a lot about the other company
2419.72s: I mean, you know, you can read about them and you can you can google them and you can talk to people that know them
2425.72s: But in on the one hand you're usually betting on the CEO
2429.32s: You know because there's somebody that's ultimately making decisions. She's CEO chairman of the board
2433.80s: And you know, you're listening to their story and on the one hand you're like
2438.04s: You know, you're like oh, this sounds great because they're gonna make it sound great in the other hand
2441.16s: You're like hey if they live up to half of what they said it's gonna be good
2445.88s: But the other part of it is you know, you're just kind of ready for a new challenge
2451.16s: And in the world that we come from
2454.84s: Every time we've done a deal we've ended up kind of taking over the new company in the sense that you know
2460.04s: Our personalities our egos our technology has been very dominating
2465.56s: So we figured you know, you know, the first thing we said to each other as well when we do this deal with IG next thing
2470.20s: You know, you know, they're gonna become they're gonna become tasty trade
2474.12s: Like that's how it works in our mind
2476.76s: It hasn't happened but when we saw thinkerson. I was just to tell the CEO of TD Merit trade
2481.96s: You know one day TD Merit trade is not gonna be around and you'll be called thinkerson
2485.40s: And it actually happened now thinkerson's still there and Schwab owns them but TD Merit trade's gone
2490.28s: So, you know, and I used to joke with him and tell him that's gonna be what happens and he thought I was out of my mind
2495.48s: Um, it's probably I'm probably not that you know, I mean, maybe it's cocky. Maybe it's whatever but
2502.84s: um
2503.72s: Listen, I love what I do and I make sure that you know, they they bought an amazing company
2510.28s: I mean, they paid a you know over a billion dollars for it, but they bought an amazing company
2514.68s: And they bought some amazing people and you know, um, I
2519.32s: You know, we delivered that's for sure
2522.20s: If you could go back to when you were first stepping on the trading floor time machine
2526.60s: And then you just get to tell yourself you're gonna sell a company for a billion dollars and you know 20 30 years
2532.36s: What would your initial response that have been?
2535.08s: My whole goal when I got to the trading floor I remember it's this day I said
2540.12s: Because I didn't you know, I mean when I came to the trading floor we I scrounged about $50,000
2547.40s: You know totally scrounged so it was like so I thought $50,000 like a million dollars
2552.84s: But when I got to trading for my goal was to
2557.00s: Put a million dollars in the bank
2559.32s: To own my house and to own my seat
2561.80s: I thought if I did that I would be forever done like I could do anything I want in the whole world
2567.88s: Million dollars in the bank own my house on my seat and they and nobody could ever touch me
2572.76s: And that was my objective when I first got there, you know for a while
2578.52s: Um, and then I realized you know
2581.48s: That at young stupid with lots of money, you know a million dollars didn't go very far
2587.64s: Even the 80s so um, you know, but whatever
2591.48s: Uh, I never thought
2595.08s: You know, you never know how your life's gonna play out
2597.64s: We didn't build thinkar sim until I was in my 40s. I didn't build tasty to wear our 50s. So
2604.68s: You never know, you know like like I have I would never do it any other way like I have no regrets. I love it the whole deal
2611.88s: um
2613.48s: You know, so no I
2615.48s: You know, no, I never thought about it once
2618.20s: And when we built thinkar sim originally, I mean, you know
2621.64s: When we are we did our first capital raise at a hundred million dollar valuation and at that point
2626.60s: I was like this is crazy like why is somebody buying what we built? Why is somebody investing at a hundred million dollar valuation?
2632.52s: Like it just I couldn't process it
2635.64s: I bet and then so you guys are in the process of you know, obviously still growing tasty you guys are still working on a lot of stuff
2644.12s: So what's the what's the road map for you guys going forward?
2647.08s: Are you just trying to promigate this even a wider degree have more people, you know, tuning into what you guys are working on and adopting your approach or just kind of playing it day by day
2656.12s: you know
2657.72s: I really love what I do
2659.72s: So I hope I can do it, you know, I mean obviously
2664.20s: You know, I'm probably the largest share one of the largest shareholders at IG were public company in London
2669.32s: So I fully I'm all in and betting on ourselves for the next you know however long it is
2674.92s: um
2675.80s: So I clearly made my bed as a bet
2678.36s: Um on what we're going to build and accomplish over the next couple of years
2681.88s: but I really
2684.04s: You know, I could just
2685.80s: Pack it in and go
2687.32s: You know live on a mountain or an island or whatever who cares
2690.36s: But I don't have any interest in it. It's not like it. It's not me
2693.96s: so
2695.08s: I still work like 12 hours a day and and I and I love it
2698.68s: And I hope to you know, keep doing it for
2701.64s: Until they literally until they drag me off the stage or you know, roll me into the dumpster or fire my ass, you know for being
2709.56s: you know
2710.60s: Being crazy or insubordinate or whatever hold an ornary. Yeah, hold an ornary and everything else and
2717.32s: as long as we can keep doing
2719.72s: what we do
2722.20s: um
2723.16s: It's fascinating to me. I don't want it, you know
2726.12s: I don't want to do anything else. I love creating content
2729.00s: I love building technology
2731.00s: um, I love building businesses. It's fun and
2734.60s: I
2735.64s: I can't see myself doing anything else like I don't know what else I could do
2741.56s: It's
2742.60s: Every time I hear you speak and I have a chance to talk to you like genuinely it's very motivating to me because
2749.40s: It's for I grow poor shit and obviously I'm nowhere near you know
2754.84s: The degree of success you have but I'm marginally from where I thought I was going to end up
2759.00s: I'm far more successful than I had anticipated
2761.64s: and
2762.60s: For the longest time it always felt good
2764.52s: I thought when I had a bunch of money that I would just do nothing all day that I would just because that's so good
2771.88s: And it's fascinating to me to see somebody with you, you know, obviously like
2777.56s: Goodgillion times my level of success and you're still like what's the next thing
2782.60s: Because money is
2785.40s: Stupid I money has no purpose for me
2789.56s: um, you know, I own my house. What what I'll you know
2795.24s: We own our businesses, you know, I own
2798.68s: I have everything I need and
2801.96s: And I can't even spend the money I have so I mean, you know, do I give it away, you know
2807.40s: You know, whatever who knows at the end
2809.48s: but
2810.68s: But money has no utility for me at all
2813.48s: Um, it doesn't mean the thing. I mean, it allows me to have
2817.48s: You know nice dinners and stay in nice hotels somewhere maybe go on a nice trip and you know
2822.44s: And allows me to have whatever I want which isn't that much anyway, but um
2828.04s: But it doesn't turn me on
2830.28s: so like you know the the most fascinating the most interesting part of my life
2838.36s: At this point is
2840.36s: I would love to help a community of people that are like-minded
2845.80s: um
2847.08s: You know build wealth however that means
2850.36s: And I feel like if that's your legacy
2853.24s: Then you really left something special behind you know money can only do so much
2858.52s: And then beyond that, you know like there needs to be something maybe it's for some people it's inspiration
2863.72s: Maybe for somebody else there's real skill
2866.04s: You know, I like to say
2868.84s: In one of the um speeches that I give I'd like to say
2874.04s: Um over the years with everything that we've done
2877.48s: Technology-wise and markets-wise, you know, we've we've taken a lot of people down in the sense that you know
2885.08s: There's no doubt in my mind that a lot of people that have listened to us
2888.92s: You know because they've got involved in stocks options futures
2892.36s: You know futures options crypto whatever else. They've lost a lot of money
2897.48s: over the years
2898.76s: And I also think the other side which is
2902.68s: We've probably created more wealth and more millionaires and more we more you know success stories
2910.76s: Than anybody else in history of finance
2913.00s: So like is that you know, what does that mean? You know like like I will take
2917.80s: You know this crazy amount of outliers to the upside
2921.48s: You know, I'm okay with that like with some people losing and some people winning huge like I've
2930.52s: I've tried to reduce the pool of mediocrity
2934.44s: And push people to either side because that's what people want is an opportunity to be an outlier
2942.12s: And if it doesn't work out, it just doesn't work out and if it does work out, you know
2946.92s: We've done something incredible
2948.60s: And I don't think anybody else has ever done that like as ever that's been their focus
2953.40s: And I think it's it's so damn important that you know
2956.92s: Everybody's always telling everybody, you know think about that decision be
2961.00s: Be conservative be safe, you know
2962.84s: Don't take the don't risk the nest egg all this kind of crap
2966.28s: I risk the nest egg all the time
2968.52s: I don't give a crap
2969.80s: And I think that even today and I think it's super important
2973.96s: For people to hear another side to the story that I think really does
2978.12s: Create wealth and outlier wealth and and you know and these crazy
2982.92s: You know stories which you know can everybody achieve it? Of course not
2986.44s: But everybody couldn't achieve success on the trading floor either, you know
2989.32s: That was like you know three or five out of a hundred
2992.28s: You know is it's better than that in the trading world the the online world but
2997.24s: You know that's where I think our legacy is is different, you know
3001.56s: We we encourage those you know that kind of risk for for that kind of opportunity
3006.92s: Well, I feel like I think last time I told you this but I do feel like it's important to reiterate it anyways
3012.36s: And give credit where credit is due because I I started talking with you guys back
3016.76s: I want to say in like 2011 which is like I think pretty early from when you guys started
3021.40s: It's not really started. It's about 2011
3023.88s: Yeah, so I started talking to you right after that. That's back when I was in college
3028.60s: Um, and I was already trading options for a while before that but
3033.24s: The way that you talked about two things still resonates with me and I'm 32 now so the first one is
3041.08s: Taking risk right that you were one of the the very few voices I heard
3046.20s: Talking about accepting risk as compared to risk avoidance
3049.64s: Not always resonated with me and then the second thing that you talked about is nobody knows anything
3054.60s: and
3055.80s: That is another one that I also had like a a mentor that helped me a lot with my trading that was an army veteran
3062.28s: But he used to say literally the same exact line nobody knows anything and between both of those things
3068.44s: I think and hopefully you guys know this already but at least from a personal perspective as a huge impact on
3075.00s: At least the way that I approached life. I mean now I'm at a point where I
3079.08s: I pay for my mom's house. I pay for all of her expenses and it's like some of the things that you guys have taught me from
3084.52s: You know decade plus ago. So I think the message
3087.64s: That's the kind of thing though that that's like that's the kind of story that I love to hear this is the kind of
3093.80s: This is this is what we're trying to do and this is what we want you know
3098.12s: I want my legacy to be is that there's a lot of people out there like you and and like thousands that have
3108.68s: Your path has changed because of the content and the technology that we've created and to me that's really cool
3115.72s: Why do I want to ever do anything else?
3118.84s: Yeah, as well. It is really cool and I think that especially the scalability of it
3123.32s: There was another comment that you made on another podcast that I thought was fascinating because when I started YouTube I I
3130.04s: Had no aspirations for any of this. I don't have a face that belongs on a fucking camera. I'm not good at any of this
3135.40s: I love talking with people like you're good. You're good. Don't don't tell yourself sure you're good at this
3139.88s: I
3140.68s: I would I think about the things that I've learned and I hope other people can kind of you know, siphon out
3148.04s: But I look at what you guys have been able to do at the scale and you were talking about the content business versus the investing education business
3156.92s: So
3158.12s: What I like how do you differentiate between those two and obviously you saw the scalability of the content business
3165.40s: Which is fascinating to me
3167.56s: What I never
3170.76s: I felt investor education was
3173.88s: So a big part of creating tasty was because I was so disenchanted with investor education. I saw investor education
3184.12s: As being a very static business and also I don't like businesses that that rely on basically static content or static information
3195.72s: It's almost it reminds me of too much of
3198.60s: Like academia you can't change a curriculum because it's too expensive while the same thing investor education
3204.76s: So the concept of investor education
3207.24s: I was never able to buy into it. I never wanted to own any part of an of investor education company because I
3214.60s: I felt like they're all doomed to fail
3217.16s: but I felt like content was scalable and content was was dynamic. He was always changing and
3224.92s: If we didn't worry about like people always say well untaste it you make it too hard to find this piece
3230.28s: You did seven years ago type of thing
3232.28s: You know you don't teach a course and I'm like yeah, that's intentional
3235.96s: I didn't want to build an investor education platform. I don't give a crap. I wanted to build
3242.52s: You know, I wanted to create as much content as we could create and throw it at you like push it through a fire hose
3248.84s: So you're overwhelmed with content and we're always changing it
3252.28s: And if you don't like it just watch the next day because it'll change
3255.24s: And I don't care what we said about two or three days before because we're gonna learn more stuff
3259.40s: And we're gonna change stuff and products are gonna change and so so I'm gonna build an investor
3265.40s: I'm gonna build a financial content
3267.96s: Company that doesn't care about two things that are traditional forget about education for a second one is we're not gonna focus on
3276.68s: Stupid ass news because news to me anybody can buy news who cares? There's nothing to news
3282.12s: And the second thing is we're not gonna focus on guests because I don't care what other people have to say
3287.16s: Because you're just gonna mess up
3289.48s: All the all the money I spend on research and everything else
3292.20s: I don't care what you think because what you think is not what our research says
3296.76s: So your opinion doesn't mean anything to me so and so no news no guests that was the whole thing
3302.84s: But so all gonna be our own homegrown think tank based
3306.68s: quantitative content and you know and and people are like
3311.00s: Tom that is
3312.84s: so dumb
3314.36s: so insane
3316.44s: Nobody's gonna watch you guys talk about the stuff and I'm like okay, then they won't watch
3321.40s: We'll we'll we'll fall flat in our face if that's the case
3324.28s: But I never believed that was the case. I thought I thought people would eat up the idea of
3331.00s: you know of aggressive
3333.56s: Um
3334.52s: quantitative content. We don't dump anything down. I wanted to make
3339.08s: Build a network around challenging people with tough things and it freaking worked
3344.60s: It does and I think another thing that you guys do really well still though is you make very
3351.24s: Seemingly challenging problem sets more consumable and especially when you talk about them, which I think is
3357.64s: No question about that no question
3359.80s: It's yeah, it's a tremendous skill you have so one of the things I wanted to kind of get your take on is you've found
3367.00s: What I consider to be one of the best balance acts between theoretical understanding of things
3372.20s: But then the practical application of it
3374.60s: Yeah, how did you develop that and then I can see it through all of the pieces you put out that you still integrate it
3380.84s: But how did you develop that?
3383.24s: Well, we
3385.48s: We kind of backed into it
3387.48s: so first of all
3390.12s: one of my
3391.88s: skills one of my skills is
3395.08s: making very complex. I just did a
3398.04s: a talk in front of a group of
3400.20s: it was a it was a
3402.52s: Kind of like a not a seminar it was um
3405.80s: It was this educational event for pH
3408.68s: PhD students in business from all over the world to fly to this one event so they could have this kind of symposium
3414.92s: And I was the keynote speaker and I was my topic was
3418.92s: Essentially making complex topics simple
3422.28s: Because they're like, you know, that's the problem with most
3425.72s: PhDs and most talks is that nobody really has no it's very rare skillset to make really
3432.28s: complex financial topics simple. There's no way to make a black sholes discussion crazy simple
3438.36s: So
3439.40s: So we're good at it
3440.68s: But and we realized that you know over over time we started to build tasty
3445.80s: We recognized I kind of knew what going in but but we've really worked on that on that skill
3451.40s: But I think that
3453.80s: You know, it wasn't just about making complex topics simple and integrating that in we also
3459.72s: Decided very early on that that finance
3464.04s: People could take finance in small doses, but other than that it's it's kind of boring and you know, it's very hard to get people
3471.32s: to
3472.28s: Really that interested in in finance that they can watch it all day long all the time and all that kind of stuff
3477.08s: So we decided that
3478.76s: We're going to integrate personalities. We're going to make this about us
3482.68s: And we're going to make this about our personalities. We're going to make this around you know
3486.52s: Everything from what you have for lunch to you know to you know
3491.48s: Did you you know what you do last night? You know to to are you talking to your wife type thing you know like we we were gonna be
3499.40s: The rule we had a tasty was if you come to work for the network
3504.04s: Nothing is off limits like your life is out there like my wife used to be when we first started should be like
3511.08s: Listen, I don't like this. I'm private. I don't want anybody to know about and I'm like listen
3515.32s: This is what we're doing. This is it. You know like I'll try to leave you as out of it as much as I can
3519.72s: But this is our network everything is on the table. You know, this is this is what we do and by doing that
3527.00s: um
3528.04s: You know, I felt there there was a it would change
3531.88s: A little bit about the world of finance and we would make finance a combination of
3536.12s: Complex topics, but also people would want to you know they get to like you they want to they want to know who you are
3542.92s: They want to they want to be with you. You know, they they want to listen to you. You know, I listened to like
3548.44s: Stern for like 30 years and you know and I used to be like you know
3552.84s: My favorite thing about Stern is not even listening to Stern. It was always like listening to all the
3558.44s: crazies that worked for him. It's the same as everybody and I'm no different than anybody else, you know
3563.48s: like I could listen to him, you know
3565.72s: To to guys like salg oven alley, you know talk for five hours straight even though
3571.08s: It's the most it's the dumbest most ridiculous stuff I've ever heard like I'd sit there in my car to start laughing
3578.20s: And be fascinated by it and and there was nothing to take away from other than a smile
3583.56s: But I figured you know to a certain extent, you know, we can we can create
3588.44s: Not the same thing, but in the world of finance we can be personalities and we can have a relationship
3595.40s: With our with our viewers and that we don't care about how much money you have or how much you trade or you know
3602.68s: How much you love us or hate us, you know
3605.00s: Every day I'd have people write to me and say, you know like you know, we're
3609.48s: We're we're not a political firm at all, but we definitely you know where are
3615.24s: um
3616.20s: Where we kind of wear our colors on our sleeve and and we're not the same as everybody else in the world of finance
3623.40s: And yet people still watch us no matter what side of the fence you're on everything else
3628.20s: You know people like they'll argue with us and they'll be like hey you guys are insane
3632.20s: I think you're crazy. I can't believe you think like that
3635.00s: But this the other side to it is
3636.92s: It's still listed every day and we still have this relationship and we're still friends and
3641.48s: You know, we've built this crazy relationship with hundreds of thousands of people over the last two decades which is
3649.88s: Incredibly unique in finance. It doesn't exist anywhere like there's no place in the world of finance
3656.52s: Where anybody knows who a CEO is in the financial world or has a relationship emails or live shows or whatever else it is
3663.08s: You know, it just doesn't exist. It does not exist in finance and it takes you to exist
3668.76s: I was telling my wife
3670.76s: We were on a walk last night and I told her you know that I was interviewing today
3674.76s: I was stoked to chat with you again, and I was telling her about how you know, I would email you right and obviously you're
3680.52s: You're insane with your emails that you still have you still sent a lot of emails
3687.08s: Oh, yeah to people and she asked she was just like
3690.52s: How does he do that like how many emails does he do a day?
3693.00s: So from my wife meld to you. How do you do that and how many emails do you send a day?
3699.96s: No, I can't tell you because you would you would see you'd have me
3704.76s: You'd probably have me committed like you would have
3710.60s: You would have some institution here with a truck in a few minutes
3715.48s: Like basically, you know putting me in a straight jacket and taking me away
3719.96s: Um, it's a sickness
3722.28s: Um, I've been doing it now for 24 years
3726.84s: um, you know people are are cool about it, but hundreds
3732.04s: Easily hundreds, but I'm good about
3735.32s: Like I only email back and forth with customers
3738.76s: Like in other words like professionals in the industry like I don't do professional events or I don't I'm very careful about
3745.00s: Avoiding the professional stuff. I only want to deal with customers because my relationship is with with our customers
3751.48s: I don't care about you know
3753.24s: Anything else like everybody else cares about, you know, their professional relationships they care about
3757.24s: You know all this other stuff, you know, employee relationships everything else. I only care about a customer
3763.56s: I do it's insane, but it's a stupid. It's part of me that just it
3767.88s: I broke I broke something and I can't fix it
3771.32s: It's one of the things that I I still revere that about you though, especially because
3777.32s: Um, one of the reasons why I started my YouTube channel was inspired by you guys and the fact that I really feel like at least from like a YouTube and social media side of stuff that there's just
3787.80s: Such an obscene amount of bullshit out there that there's not people just talking about like no like not everybody gets a Lamborghini overnight as soon as you start trading zero DTE SPX
3799.08s: Credits brands like it's just good fucking lock me
3802.20s: Yeah
3803.48s: Totally agree we we we're very careful not even
3807.72s: You know, we trade all the time on air and do stuff like that, but we don't you know, we we never talk about money
3813.80s: You know, I won't talk about winners and losers sometimes we try to talk way more about losers
3818.44s: But we it's part of our culture, you know real traders only talk about losers never winners
3823.64s: But um, yeah, we we never talk about money because it's you know because everybody knows you're a joke immediately because it's it's such a hard business, you know
3833.08s: that
3835.08s: It's just not we didn't want to be about it's not about that
3838.68s: Right
3839.80s: Another thing I wanted to ask you and then I'll I'll get you out of here
3842.52s: I know it's getting a little bit later your time, but I really am curious about this
3846.84s: You have one of the most like information and data open dispositions that I've seen
3852.60s: A lot of people I find as they find their way
3856.92s: Over time they kind of are completely reluctant to it not necessarily adopt but even hear other perspectives
3863.80s: Yet you have a team that I see you debate with them sometimes you agree sometimes you don't but like on a daily basis you receive new
3871.72s: Information from people openly
3874.52s: How do you get to that point where you know what you do works your confident in what you do
3879.80s: But you're still willing to hear the conversation
3883.48s: We have like an in-house think tank with some incredibly brilliant kids
3890.12s: I say they're kids, but they're probably you know late 20s early 30s, you know, they're all
3896.04s: You know from PhDs down to mathematicians down to like
3900.20s: Brilliant, you know, and
3903.08s: You know I encourage them to
3905.80s: Um, they're encouraged to create their own content that we use on air
3910.36s: um, and I don't
3912.28s: I don't want to discourage them from trying to
3917.56s: uh
3918.60s: You know trying to dispute something trying to find holes in what we do you know, I think it's really important that
3925.24s: That they they have to believe they have to buy in on their own
3929.16s: Um, they have to they have to do the research themselves tomorrow. I know this podcast will be it'll be this podcast will be later than then
3936.52s: I'm not sure when you're gonna play the podcast, but
3939.48s: um, tomorrow we're we're actually debating and nine o'clock tomorrow morning
3943.32s: We're doing a debate with you know two different PhDs and and some others on
3948.76s: On mean reversion and price and I can't wait to do it tomorrow
3952.20s: Because you know, I'm I'm saying there is there is no such thing and you know
3957.08s: One of the other PhDs is saying there is one of the other PhDs is saying there isn't one of the other crazy smart mathematicians
3963.00s: We have saying there is and so we're getting into a debate on
3966.84s: On uh, you know mean reversion on price only on tasty would you ever get a debate about mean reversion on price from a bunch of you know
3974.92s: PhD geeks
3977.08s: That's actually awesome. I'm I 100% will watch that and then I mean you could always bring some boxing gloves
3982.04s: Right and if it doesn't get settled there you could just have people box it out a little bit and then then we move on
3988.12s: Yeah, we could do that um, I usually with math PhDs the boxing thing isn't that exciting
3993.88s: um
3995.88s: but um
3998.12s: Yeah, you know like yeah, I mean I've reached a point where
4002.68s: You know, I'm still learning
4005.40s: It's little things little tweaks things like that, but um we're still learning and and I think it's cool that we get to keep presenting
4013.48s: You know, that's the beautiful thing about
4016.52s: Dynamic content it every single day. It just keeps getting better and I see no reason that it will ever you know
4023.24s: They will ever go the other direction. I mean we just keep finding more content to talk about every single day
4029.08s: In the trading world and it's you know as long as there's new products. They'll be new content
4034.12s: Well, and I also think it's really cool that you guys iterate on things because what I find at least again and typical like
4040.92s: Financial social media space if somebody says I think stock XYZ is gonna go up and then somehow later
4047.08s: They change their opinion for whatever reason and they're like well, I think XYZ is gonna go down
4051.00s: Everybody would jump down their throat and they would say well, how could you switch your opinion that at it on
4055.24s: And you know, I always look at that and I always think well
4057.96s: Wouldn't you change your opinion of new fucking information comes out like what's the point of being so entrenched
4063.80s: That you refuse new data and I genuinely have been super impressed watching you over the last decade
4069.80s: And the way that you still stay sensitive to new information because it's that's a skill in and of itself to stay open to stuff like that
4076.60s: I think
4077.80s: Yeah, I mean we're open to certain things like new information of the markets. I'm open to yeah like I'm not gonna change my opinion of you know
4085.80s: Of social issues. I'm not gonna change my opinion of of different things in in the world
4090.20s: Or at least I doubt I will but um with respect to you know
4095.72s: Mechanical optimization of the world of finance. I mean why wouldn't I be
4101.24s: Completely open all the time, you know, we've learned some things in the last uh 12 years that are just
4107.88s: They they'll blow you away like you know, numbers wise. They would blow me away
4111.96s: I wish I had known these you know 40 years ago, but I didn't have any idea so
4116.20s: um I feel like
4118.36s: Yeah, that that games you know the learning game never stops and I also think it makes us
4123.64s: It makes us more interesting more more real more approachable
4127.80s: The fact that we're not you know like we're open to being
4131.80s: We're open to debate. We're open to being told that you know, hey
4136.52s: You should look at this way or you should do this this way, you know
4139.80s: One of the things I've learned from doing tasty is that is that
4143.72s: Everybody is smart everybody smart like like the idea that you know like you know
4148.84s: Sometimes you get you watch the news and you get to lose a scourge or like man
4151.96s: We are the dumbest freaking country in the world
4154.36s: You know, and it's I do start to think you know and you start to get down on it because you're like
4158.60s: How can we be this dumb as a as a country? And then and then yet, you know
4162.76s: Then you go back and you watch tasty and you're like, you know what all these people are so damn smart
4168.04s: And everybody that you know that you know damn I just can't believe you know
4173.88s: how
4175.08s: The kind of stuff that people understand are able to grasp and and they're able to you know the logic makes so much sense
4182.20s: That you know then I have this this kind of renewed
4186.52s: You know vigor and belief and what we you know in in society and and all the good that can happen
4192.36s: So yeah, I I have to you know, we have to think that way
4197.40s: Yeah, well, I think it's a whole mark of what you guys do is compared to a lot of other things
