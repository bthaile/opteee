0.00s: What's up, outliers?
1.50s: Welcome back to another outlier trading tips video
5.60s: where you learned something in three minutes or less.
7.80s: Today we are going to talk about the Ebb and Flow
11.20s: of Market liquidity throughout the day.
13.76s: There are periods that are more advantageous to trading
18.20s: just about anything than other periods throughout the day.
22.00s: And the reality is, especially as options traders,
25.60s: there are times during the day that are way more liquid
29.76s: than other times.
30.80s: Even if you're not trading something that's intraday
34.08s: decided to or designed to make money off of what is happening
38.40s: today, maybe a trade that's further out in time.
41.92s: And I want you to look at this chart above my head.
44.76s: This is of spy.
46.48s: It's a two-day five-minute charts all compressed down,
49.36s: because obviously we're in the vertical format here.
52.04s: But if I give you a little bit more space,
54.72s: I want you to take a look at these spikes in volume.
58.36s: There's a spike here.
60.28s: Then it's kind of flat low low low low,
62.84s: then there's another spike here.
65.92s: And then it's flat low low low low low,
67.96s: and then another spike here.
70.44s: So you notice there's a bit of a trend here.
72.92s: What's that trend?
73.76s: Well, it's really simple.
75.44s: When the market first opens,
79.16s: there typically is a flush of liquidity after the open.
84.36s: And this can exist for anywhere from 15
88.28s: minutes to an hour or so.
90.32s: And then it typically starts to slow down
93.32s: throughout the rest of the morning, midday.
95.96s: It's kind of low for most of the day.
98.00s: And then you'll notice as we get into like the last half hour
101.52s: of trading, all of a sudden it shoots back up again.
105.32s: And there are a key few key reasons.
108.72s: Why this happens?
111.20s: The first is due to opening and closing auctions.
115.16s: This is where the exchange is essentially a loud, larger trades
118.84s: to go through out of price.
120.92s: And this is where you'll see most of the institutional volume
124.32s: coming through and that's for that exact reason.
126.92s: The other thing as you'll notice,
127.96s: especially for opens,
129.88s: is there's a lot of overnight order flow imbalances
133.36s: based on what happened over the evening before.
136.68s: So the main thing to keep in mind is that if you're a trader
139.20s: in general and you have access to the market,
141.20s: if you're trading one-long, five-lots, 10-lot, small trades,
145.08s: doesn't really matter that much.
146.36s: But as soon as you're trying to size up your positions
148.40s: and trades slightly larger, then that,
151.28s: it can make a lot of sense to try to find your entries
153.92s: when the market is most liquid, typically first hour of the day,
157.12s: last hour of the day, something like that.
160.20s: Be an outlier.
161.40s: See you later.
