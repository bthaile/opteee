0.00s: What's up Matt welcome back.
4.32s: Thanks for thanks for having me Eric.
5.92s: Yeah beautiful.
6.52s: So I had to do a quick intro because we're just talking about Freddie Krueger
9.68s: because you're wearing the blue version of his sweatshirt.
12.88s: But you were saying you don't really watch horror movies.
15.48s: I need at least the audience members to vouch for me here and make sure that they
20.32s: at least can validate my perception.
23.00s: But we were just talking about we don't actually know how he.
27.24s: What is thing is because I always thought it's like he kills people
29.48s: in their sleep.
30.08s: I don't really know how that works though.
32.20s: I didn't see the movies, but all I know is I'm happy to keep you on your toes.
36.72s: You know, I have to make sure that you're not, you know, as a former marine,
39.72s: I got to be able to also guard my six.
42.24s: I tell you what man, like I've never done the little zin nicotine pouches,
47.80s: but I'm thinking about it so that there's zero percent chance that I even like
51.20s: blink too long to creep my dreams and murder me.
54.56s: But you know, it's always good to see you, man.
58.16s: Welcome back on.
59.48s: Thanks. Thanks for having me.
60.32s: It's always always fun to chat.
61.60s: That's for sure. Yeah.
63.04s: Yeah.
63.32s: I bet that is the case because I feel like you are a really great example of kind
67.80s: of like the professional.
69.40s: And I am the example of a fucking degenerate.
73.00s: So it is always good to get those two at least in the same proximity as one another.
77.80s: But talk to me a little bit about your 2023.
81.44s: We haven't talked for a minute and I founds last year,
85.72s: last year was fascinating for me in a lot of different ways,
88.64s: but this ain't about me.
90.12s: I'm curious what it looked like for you.
92.96s: So for me, it was an interesting year.
95.36s: So I'm an active guy, but I try and build up positions.
98.68s: So I'm looking for those trends 2023.
101.04s: If you look outside of QQQ, there weren't a lot of trends, but I was fairly,
105.84s: I was fairly active.
106.84s: And I think my timing was pretty good.
109.76s: I mean, I was very aggressive coming into 23 year end.
112.64s: There was, there was, it's funny.
114.16s: Like there's every part of your system.
115.68s: There's any kind of weak point the market will, you know, bring it out.
119.88s: And for me, one thing is I would have had a very good year,
123.00s: but there was two earnings reports I was heavily invested in was Shopify and
127.00s: going into February of last year, which like, gap down and fell 25 30% in SMCI,
132.32s: which frustratingly is now the hottest stock in the market,
135.32s: which I had a monster position going into earnings last August,
139.12s: which like really tagged me out of that.
142.20s: And so as, I mean, the good thing is if you can kind of learn from it,
145.60s: then I put together different hedging strategies to help me survive those
148.72s: these massive earnings reports.
149.92s: So that kind of like, instead of it being a phenomenal 2023 was like a mediocre 2023,
155.68s: but that is so frustrating on SMCI.
160.28s: I was just looking at it today and I had a ratio called diagonal in it.
165.44s: And this is one of the few instances where I trade a larger account.
170.32s: So I'm not like typically super concerned about utilization.
173.56s: But I was like, well, it's like a $600 stock.
176.32s: Like I'm actually kind of happy to be using options for leverage here,
179.16s: because if you want to scoop up a few like a few hundred shares,
182.52s: you're like starting to get into decent sizing for just just equity out right.
188.92s: But what, what was the thesis in SMCI?
194.20s: And then was it just the earnings that got you taken out?
196.60s: Because that actually is the frustrating.
197.96s: This is a frustrating thing, right?
199.12s: So like the whole thesis I built out is what's playing out.
201.88s: And it's like, now you see this talk more than double than you hear the same stuff being echoed back to you.
206.28s: Like, yeah, but so really, I mean, basically the issue is earnings reports.
210.84s: The reactions have become pretty insane.
213.72s: I mean, even medited, I mean, meta's a massive one of the world's largest companies up 20% on earnings.
218.84s: Like the moves have become so surreal.
220.44s: I mean, I like, when I started off trading, I mean, earnings were always something,
224.20s: but they weren't a big deal single digit moves percentage wise.
227.32s: Now these 20, 30%.
228.52s: So I mean, I had a good cost basis going to last earnings.
231.24s: I think my cost was like 240 something earnings.
234.12s: The stock was maybe 340 pre earnings and they like knocked that thing down back to 230.
238.84s: And I had size in there.
239.88s: Like I was like a big part of my portfolio.
242.84s: So you know, you had on out risk management, trying to, you know,
246.68s: take a few dollars out of it at the least.
248.36s: It's such a sizable reversal.
249.72s: And now a few months later, it's just rocking and rolling.
252.04s: But it's, I mean, that's the game, right?
253.40s: You're always constantly learning.
254.44s: So what was the exit decision?
258.20s: Was it like right after earnings and you were like, okay,
260.60s: yeah.
261.00s: So when that broke badly, so that broke down.
263.00s: So like two, so like same day, it was massive drop getting almost like a cost basis.
267.96s: So I mean, like I have like a, I think every trader has a rule where if you're making
272.20s: really good money on a stock, the last thing you want to do is end up with a loss on it.
275.56s: So as a kind of approached, like a break, even I was out of it.
278.52s: I mean, and look, I mean, by, what was that October?
281.48s: This was even lowered out to 226.
283.40s: So I mean, a certain point you have to call it a day.
286.28s: And now from here, we just kind of went vertical.
288.68s: So I mean, that's the market, right?
290.04s: It's always going to keep you on your toes.
291.48s: Isn't that something where like the move from where my mouse is now to here is from
297.48s: to 60 to 220, but it looks like nothing because of the movement.
300.68s: It's not a log chart.
301.72s: So just that move there, it's 40 points or whatever, it looks like nothing.
306.12s: But to your point, that is a meaningful move, especially with where your basis was.
310.44s: And you know, like you're talking about at the size that you were,
313.16s: were you looking at a reentry in this or not?
316.36s: I was.
317.00s: And I, you know, touched it a couple of times, but I mean, this has had a lot of volatility to it.
321.88s: I mean, the sides of the range of the bars were sizable.
325.48s: There were a lot of kind of fake type moves that never really went anywhere.
329.32s: And really, I mean, it started, it was lagging the market too.
332.20s: I mean, coming out of October, a lot of stocks were moving a lot hotter than SMCI.
336.84s: So I mean, that's the market, right?
339.00s: It'll pivot sometimes.
340.04s: But you know, I always try and like, I think to be a trader professionally,
343.24s: you have to be an optimist.
344.60s: Even if you, you know, how those most guys will become cynical when they trade long enough,
348.52s: I think though, if you want to keep it going, you have to always have that spin of like, okay,
351.56s: like, let me at least take away some kind of lesson from this.
354.36s: So since then, I've been putting in different types of hedging strategies around earnings to kind of
360.36s: not go through that same experience again.
362.76s: I mean, even, even though the novice will say, well, at least, hey, you didn't lose money on the deal.
366.52s: But that doesn't factor in the emotional drain of having, you know, a big position.
371.88s: I think it was like a 40, 50% account position being up nicely from, you know,
375.96s: 240 to 350, then suddenly five minutes later, be back at cost.
380.68s: It's like, oh, that's it's frustrating.
382.36s: So, you know, that's, well, and you also bring up a funny point about the novice traders.
387.00s: Because one of the, I was, I just did a video not too long ago.
390.20s: It's not out yet, but it talks about some of these different, like, I call the outlier mindset,
394.76s: right? We're on the outlier podcast.
396.12s: Well, one of the big things I try to talk to people about is like changing your perspective.
399.40s: Because like you said, a lot of beginners, they would look at it as, oh, you didn't lose money.
403.00s: Well, that's not what pays the bills.
405.24s: Not losing money is not what makes money.
407.56s: Like you need to make money trading.
409.24s: So I totally, totally understand the way you were looking at that.
412.44s: Because it's, yeah, that's a no, you still made some money, but just an annoying move to go through.
416.60s: No.
417.72s: Another like question I had and wanted to get your perspective on specifically with this.
422.68s: I mean, this seems for like a $300 stock to double over the course of
429.40s: what is this actually?
430.28s: It's like, we can have two weeks.
433.08s: Yeah.
433.32s: Yeah.
433.96s: Like what benchmarks do you have for that?
436.84s: So I know that you look at big moves and that's a big part of your system, but like,
442.20s: how, how anomalous is this kind of move?
446.12s: At least based on your broader perspective.
449.88s: Well, you know, that's the thing, you know, the amazing thing about stocks is the stock that's
456.28s: probably already showed you some kind of extreme strength that's likely to show it to you again
460.60s: in the future.
461.48s: So again, that's another kind of, you know, that fallacy.
463.56s: People look for the stocks that are really beat down to, you know, to, and obviously,
466.76s: you look at retro spec, you can look at stocks that took big losses and then we'll come back and say,
471.16s: oh, big percentage gain, but it's a probability thing.
473.72s: If you really want to find a stock that's going to have a big move, it's probably already had
477.56s: a big leg somewhere before.
479.00s: So it's not surprising to see that kind of a move because, you know, to cause that first move,
484.36s: especially if it's a stock of a decent market cap, they have to be on to some kind of new trend,
489.80s: some kind of major improvement and that usually it comes from a technology stock,
494.12s: unless it's something that has some kind of a supply shock like in the commodity market.
498.12s: So I'm not surprised to see it kind of catch up because really what happened here was this was
503.32s: somewhat of a sleepy business, which was, you know, servers and racks where, you know,
508.36s: it's being transformed.
509.64s: There's massive new cat-backs coming in and management, different management,
513.80s: different styles.
514.68s: They're the kind of management where they really kind of under-promise and over-deliver.
517.64s: Sometimes they over-do that under-promise and over-deliver and they scare markets like what
521.72s: they did on that call last summer.
523.80s: And then when they find the deliverer like they did now, you get this massive move.
527.24s: So, you know, it's a matter of, I think a lot of times, management trying to manage expectations
533.24s: and I think algos play a big part.
536.36s: Moves are far more extreme than they used to be, even in the short term.
540.04s: Like I always call like algos gone wild, you know, there's some really dramatic
543.64s: moves sometimes and that's where you see these things.
545.88s: So, I'm not surprised to see the move happen.
548.20s: Wish I would have caught it the second time around, but that's what it is, yeah.
552.44s: That's interesting.
553.48s: Yeah, because I mean to your point and I know a lot of the stuff that you look at will show big moves
558.04s: like this, the part that really just blew me away is something that goes from 300 bucks,
563.08s: the 600 bucks in two weeks.
566.52s: That just seems wild to me on such a big company because I know a big part of the
571.88s: canceling methodology typically is looking for smaller companies that more prone to have big legs.
579.00s: But what do you think of something like this that's now up, you know, just near nosebleed levels,
586.28s: right? Like typically you want to look for strength, you're seeing strength, but now it presumably,
592.12s: this would be a higher risk entry by a long shot.
594.92s: Yeah.
595.24s: So, how do you view stuff like this?
597.64s: Yeah, you know, it's like you need to manage so many things at once.
600.36s: I think that's where people have a hard time because like what we do, like even yourself,
604.20s: Eric, like you know, some people say like you benchmark against the NASDAQ or the Russell or
607.56s: ARC or you know what, when you're actively managing like that, you're not always fully invested.
612.84s: There's you're really kind of running a business.
614.60s: It's not really something you're benchmarking.
617.16s: You're not just having this constant portfolio.
619.00s: So, you know, it really comes out the probability.
621.48s: It's not easy to find stocks that are going to have this kind of move.
624.36s: So, I mean, you're going to have a lot of failure in your attempts to try and find this kind of move
628.12s: or not just failure or like, you know, smaller returns.
630.12s: Stocks that have a good return but are not the outstanding ones.
633.80s: And so, you know, if you're taking these different shots, like you always have to have that risk
637.08s: management in mind because I mean, you don't have unlimited capital.
639.88s: And if you want a meaningful impact on your portfolio, if you want size,
643.80s: you need to control that risk.
645.08s: I mean, so, you know, if you think a stock has a chance of doubling,
648.36s: but there's, you know, a 10% chance at that happening,
651.40s: that's your expected return.
652.52s: So, you know, you have to factor in what kind of risk am I going to take on
655.88s: and appear the risk reward is not great anymore.
658.04s: So, a lot of times, it's kind of you have to walk that fine line between which stocks have all the
662.52s: upside potential.
663.72s: But then that restraint for, I need to at least find a place where I'm going to be
667.56s: adequately rewarded for the risk I'm taking on.
669.96s: So, you have to have those two balancing forces all the time kind of going within your mind.
675.16s: It's, and the reason I ask you that specifically, because it's something that I see all the time where
682.28s: at least a lot of people in my community, they commit what I consider to be,
687.32s: it's not like a big sin, but they miss out on a lot of stuff because they're waiting for too much
692.92s: confirmation. They're waiting for like the clearest trending move.
698.28s: And then what I try to explain if we're trading directionally, even with options in those kinds
702.76s: of instances, you're just increasing the risk you're taking because you need to give something
707.88s: a little bit of room to move. If you've had a really strong consolidation period,
711.56s: you now have a pretty clear snapshot on how you can manage your risk around that kind of spot.
716.28s: And then if you start to see this breakout and you're late to trading it like too late,
720.44s: now all of a sudden the base is still down here. So, you have to either have a really low expectation
726.44s: that the trade will work out, but if it does, might be a great win.
730.12s: What do you think about putting on positions like that? Because like you were talking about in this
733.96s: instance, it was a big part of your portfolio. So then is your approach in that instance,
739.88s: the remainder of your portfolio, do you also have that super concentrated, or is it that you have
746.20s: this one really speculative concentrated position, and then you have the rest of it into other things
751.80s: cash, whatever to try to balance some of it off? Did you ever read the book,
756.12s: Remin instances of stock operator? Yeah, I'm assuming you did. Yeah. So my approach really,
760.76s: it's funny because at one point I thought I had a stroke of genius that I had invented a way of
766.04s: building into positions. And then after I was rereading that book, I'm like, oh, I just kind of
770.04s: ripped off Jesse Livermore in this chapter when he was talking about. So there's one chapter where
773.96s: he talks about he's looking at wheat and corn or something like that. He puts a position on both,
778.92s: and wheat keeps going up and he keeps adding to it progressively and getting a big position.
783.56s: Corn never moves. He never adds to it and he ends up selling it for a small loss and the wheat's
787.80s: major winner. So for me, like, so some people, I think will misunderstand saying, oh, yeah,
791.80s: this big position, you must be gambling. Like, I'm incredibly risk-averse. Like, I hate risk.
796.60s: And the reason is is, like, I was a market maker for years and I used to trade a lot of these
800.04s: miners and stuff where they love to raise money. And so so many times you see this big update,
804.36s: and if you say, like, oh, it's a breakout and you bought it, like that night, like 405,
808.68s: oh, financing, and it's 10% lower. And so you're getting slammed. So I got so used to having to work
814.04s: around like possible, like overnight gaps and event risk. Like, if I'm going to get a concentrated
818.60s: position and it take me time, and I have to build it with with profit. So I have that profit cushion
823.56s: building to protect my original capital. And so it takes time to get concentrated positions. If it's
829.72s: a great market, can I have three or four concentrated positions going at once? Sure. But it's kind
835.24s: of like what the market gives to me. So like last year, for example, when I had SMCI last summer,
839.24s: it was a bit of a thinner market. There weren't as many great movers. So that was like my
843.88s: concentrated positions of that moment. Other times I have a few more going on, but it's like,
849.08s: I don't start off saying I'm buying four stocks and putting massive size and let's see what happens.
853.64s: It's really like what the market gives me. Got it. So then in the example of SMCI, the way that I
859.80s: typically break out trades, at least mentally, is I have what I call an allocation. So upfront,
865.80s: I typically determine how much of my portfolio does that trade get. And then I have two other metrics.
871.08s: I have the initial outlay. So of that total allocation, how much am I giving it upfront?
876.36s: And then I have scaling. So based on whether it's certain dollar moves, whatever the case is,
880.68s: how much am I adding in different frequencies? What's your approach in an instance like this with SMCI?
887.32s: Yeah. So like I usually start around 10% of the portfolio. My aim is to scale things to the 30 to
893.08s: 50% range. That's where I feel comfortable. Like I've gone above that. But then like I'm personally
898.28s: getting out of my, you know, like when you're pushing your own personal comfort zone, you know,
901.32s: it's like, like I get above sometimes it's rare, but I'm, I know I'm kind of pushing it and it
905.80s: better be working if it doesn't I'll scale it back quickly. But that's kind of the range that works.
909.88s: I mean, some people like their heads explode, explode thing of that kind of concentration.
913.96s: But if you do it carefully, like by the time you're getting to a 30, 40% concentration,
918.52s: you're already up like 10% on the average cost basis. So I mean, you're protected against a random
925.48s: overnight gap down or bad news or downgrade or some kind of situation like that. So there's
930.04s: ways to kind of still work around it. But you know, those really outsized returns come when you
936.20s: get a good trend, you get an early, you get that concentration. It takes that effort to really
940.28s: bring it all together. But when it works, it's like it's fireworks, you know, but it takes that
944.20s: effort, that diligence to get to that point. Yeah. And I think for a lot of traders,
949.24s: they're always fed the, you know, individual positions should never be more than a percent of
953.48s: your account or whatever the case is, right? They just throw out a random number.
957.80s: When you look at building these positions, though, you've found that if you want to get big moves,
963.00s: you have to add the size. So how do you think people can make that mental leap from where they're
968.20s: given this really, in my opinion, really risk averse. And then trying to get to a point where you
975.16s: can actually make like meaningful money on moves provided that you're still controlling your risk
979.48s: on the bigger positions, how do people make that jump? You know, so I think there's like, you have to
984.20s: make different ground rules. I think for everyone, it's going to be different numbers. Some people
987.64s: can be even more aggressive than me. Some people are incredibly averse. So you have to sort of,
991.48s: you have to kind of come to terms with what works for you. Like there's like really what's your
995.48s: maximum? For some people, it'll be 50 percent. Some people will see people will be 10 percent of a
999.00s: portfolio. That's the max they can accept. But so there's two tricks that kind of work for me.
1003.80s: One was, it was years ago, I was in a slump. I think it was 2011. I had a grade 2010, and that's
1009.24s: another kind of pattern I noticed after my really big years, the next year tends to kind of not be
1014.04s: so good because you get sloppy and stuff like that. But I remember 2011, I'll keep you humble. Yeah,
1019.56s: yeah, Mark will keep you humble, my friend. But I was in a slump, and I remember I was sitting next
1023.72s: to a guy. So I was the youngest guy on the desk. Next to me was kind of the oldest guy on the desk.
1027.48s: And it's almost like, you know, you're at that point where every time you touch the mouse, you lose
1030.84s: money. Like you're almost like, you know, you're just scared to put a trade on. And he's like, Matt,
1035.56s: I don't care. He's like, you figure out what's an amount of money that's not going to bother you to
1039.16s: lose and you just keep trading with that amount until you get back your groove. And so that's kind
1043.32s: of where I started the dollar stop concept. So for every trade, you know, as my account moves,
1047.88s: I'll adjust it every few months. But there's a maximum dollar amount that I'll lose on a trade.
1053.24s: Now, like, although it's kind of based on percentages, but our returns work in percentages, but our
1059.56s: gut works with dollars. You know, we live in dollars. You know, how much it takes to buy a car,
1063.24s: how much it, you know, it takes to go out for supper. So at the end of the day, the dollar loss
1067.64s: is going to hurt you probably more than the percentages. That's more like the industry things we watch.
1071.48s: So when I set that dollar stop, it kind of created this level of comfort. We're like, okay,
1077.32s: I can put on my trade. I know what I'm going to lose. I can live with that. And it created this
1081.64s: like openness of this, you know, this feeling of being able to kind of go out there and not worry
1087.32s: about, am I going to screw this up? That's my max loss. If I get there, I'll get out and I'll reassess.
1091.64s: It took off a lot of pressure. And a second kind of tool that helped me was, I would then after kind
1097.08s: of we tend to circumvent our own kind of safety features would be like, okay, that's that's my
1103.56s: my back some dollar risk. So I'll put on a bunch of trades really quickly, you know, one after another.
1108.20s: So you end up building all this size and then you still have this risk if there's a gap down
1112.04s: because you you put on all these trades, but they're all right next to each other. So basically,
1115.80s: I have so much I'll lose on a trade. And then I want my stocks to go up at least by four or five
1120.44s: percent before I add to them just to prevent myself from kind of constantly adding in the same range
1125.48s: it without any kind of real profit cushion. So if I have a maximum loss and I need at least some
1129.88s: kind of a gain before I add, everything's going to be going my way before I'm getting concentrated.
1134.52s: So that's my way of being safe and getting concentrated. Yeah, I love that. And then how do you view
1140.12s: adding? Is there a certain amount of you start with maybe 10% of the portfolio like you're saying,
1145.72s: how do you view when you get that four to five percent move? What's your thoughts on adding there?
1151.32s: I try and do it other I try and do similar size. I try and be consistent. I mean, like I won't
1155.64s: explain, you know, if the stock gets too extended from a base, I'll just let it go at that point,
1159.00s: but I try and start near basing structure. So I have a good kind of foundation where if it does
1164.20s: ultimately break away, I'm already nicely concentrated like I hate sometimes like I have a position
1169.56s: in Palo Alto like I wish I had more sometimes they just kind of get going and you don't get your
1174.12s: position and it sucks to see a nice winner and you're like, oh, I have like a third of what I
1178.60s: really wanted in there. So it never gets the same kind of meaningful impact, but I try and be
1182.68s: consistent with my position sizing. Yeah, well, I think the idea of consistency of position sizing,
1189.16s: it gives you a known good because I think if you don't do that, especially with options when you're
1195.32s: dealing with kind of two different sets of values, you have the premium of an option and then you
1199.48s: have the noional value of whatever it is you're controlling. But if it's yeah, kind of a crapshoot,
1205.16s: I've always found that to be impossible then to project a system forward, even have any confidence
1210.60s: in the perspective return for it. So 2023 was obviously then a lackluster kind of boring year for you
1222.12s: coming into 2024. What were your original expectations and how have they panned out so far?
1229.24s: So things have kind of gone similar to what I expected. For me, the biggest frustration I think is
1234.84s: I think a lot of probably active professionals will feel it is just the QQQ is so strong because
1239.48s: there's a small group that so it makes it kind of makes everyone who's an active manager who's
1244.76s: not keeping up with like the top five names look like a loser say, oh, look what the
1249.24s: it's an abnormal market in a sense like I've never seen the QQQ do that, but the Russell 2000
1254.52s: be stuck in a bear market. Not that you should be in the Russell 2000, but most stocks probably
1258.20s: fall in between. So it's a bit of a frustration in that sense, but it's played out as I expect that I
1262.68s: had a good end of year, like a good push into the end of the year coming into the into the start of the
1268.52s: year. I the markets were frothy. There's some other tools I look at to get a sense if the markets are
1273.24s: frothy or not. So I bought a lot of protective puts. I was going away on vacation. I said, look,
1277.16s: number one, the markets frothy. I'm going to be on the beach. I don't want to have to be attached
1280.28s: to my phone. So I bought a lot of protective puts. I even bought some out of the money put so I could
1284.12s: be aggressive if things did fall. So that all worked out very well. Obviously, you know, there's
1290.28s: the cost of those puts. There's a bit of like a draw on performance for that respect, but it allowed
1294.92s: me to keep a lot of my positions, which I'm still not positioned in. We're going to earning season
1298.36s: with protection. So at least the profits finance that protection. We'll see how that ultimately
1302.84s: plays out. So if I wouldn't have been protected, some stocks took some sizable drops, which I was
1307.48s: kind of without protection would have been a painful start to the year. So I was able to work that.
1312.12s: Each year, I pick a new focus of what I want to really specialize on and improve. This year was
1318.04s: equity curve management. And so that's kind of I'm running some new like hedging ideas. And so so far,
1323.08s: so far, so good. Because you know, if you're looking outside of QQ, a lot of stocks took some,
1329.00s: I mean, archonivation is down like what 13, 14% in the first month, you know, I think rustles down
1333.64s: 8%. Depending where you were standing, it was a very different January. And so for a guy where
1338.68s: my preference is not usually, you know, $2 trillion companies, you're looking for innovative growth.
1343.96s: It could have been very damaging. So I was happy with the hedges. Yeah. And it's good that you bring
1349.80s: up the cost of those hedges because the way that you're thinking about hedging obviously is as
1355.48s: a professional where a lot of people that I find think about hedging, they want to hedge because
1360.84s: they just don't like seeing red. It's a visceral response, right? They don't like feeling like
1366.12s: it's all those kinds of things, which to me, those are all the wrong reasons to hedge.
1369.64s: You have a very clear business case that you're implementing with with your hedging.
1374.60s: When you're using something like long puts, obviously, I got to ask, how do you think about those?
1381.00s: Like do you go further on time, deeper in the money? You said out of the money on some of them,
1384.76s: what's your general approach there? Yeah. So it's something I've been, it's like a strategy I've
1388.92s: been working on for a little while. I started to kind of implement it. You know, I always like to study
1392.20s: something without any money involved that I do it with a little bit of money before I roll it out
1395.96s: intensely. But so the aim was, like you said, if you just try and buy puts all the time to protect
1401.24s: yourself, I mean, you'll never make any money. You're just going to give all your money to the
1405.48s: other side. So really what I try and do is really those moments in time where you're looking at
1410.44s: the market sometimes just from a, almost like a game theory perspective, you know, like I have these
1415.40s: sizable gains, you know, all these indications are showing me that we have, you know, the
1421.40s: possibility for a larger correction may not happen. But if there is a larger correction,
1425.72s: I have a lot to lose. And if it keeps going, you know, I'm positioned. So it makes sense to pay the
1430.92s: insurance at that point in time. So I'm sorry, what was the question again, Eric? I went a bit off.
1437.80s: You were going right down the right path, fortunately, it was just how do you think about implementing
1442.20s: the puts? Yeah, sorry. That's right. Yeah. So so so so you have to step back and say, okay,
1447.96s: it's not about always protecting your account because this is a gate of business of risk. It's about
1451.64s: a business of managing risk, not taking no risk. If you want no risk, you won't make any reward.
1456.68s: So it's about finding those points in time. And that's what I've noticed with my own personal
1460.20s: situation, like with SMCI, where, okay, just from a game theory perspective, I have these huge gains,
1466.68s: I have this concentrated position. Even if you say, look, at this point, there's a 50, 50 chance
1470.84s: that we have a hard break or we just keep going, while at hard break would be really expensive,
1475.00s: relative to the cost of insurance. And so it just makes sense at that point to hedge it on when
1479.56s: you're already at these very elevated levels. So that's when I'm looking to kind of put on the
1484.68s: hedges at specific times. I'm very careful, even like with some of my members, it's like they get
1489.72s: that same kind of sense, like, well, why don't we hedge more often? It's just too expensive. You're
1493.32s: just always going to be paying hedges, hedges, and and it's really about those times where there's
1498.52s: that asymmetric place where if there's a break, it's going to get ugly. And if you've been trading
1503.96s: long enough, you kind of know where you're getting on that knife's edge of where we can keep going,
1508.28s: but it's going to be painful if everyone has to de-exit at the same time.
1511.88s: Yeah. So then when you're looking at hedging, do you just try to hedge a certain percentage of
1516.60s: your positions value? Do you hedge 100% of the value? How do you think about that?
1521.24s: Yeah. So again, you know, so if you were asking, do I do a full delta hedge or whatever,
1525.96s: it's like, you know, again, it gets more expensive. So I just said, like, look, I have,
1529.32s: let's say I'm on a stock, I'm up 35%. And it's been a good move, and I'm concentrated position.
1534.12s: If I can hedge, and usually most pullbacks, again, you know, I try and use an actual
1537.96s: perspective, most pullbacks are three to four weeks down to, let's say, a 50 day moving average.
1542.52s: That's what I'm trying to protect. Because some of these stocks, you'll see historically,
1544.92s: they'll get 25 or 30% away from their average, they'll then come back down. So to smooth out those
1550.12s: drops, which are likely. So basically, I said, I have the 35% gain. It's in a cost of 4% to hedge
1556.76s: this position for the next three to four weeks. For me, that's a good business decision. Not
1563.48s: is it going to absolutely drop now? I don't know. I can't predict. I want to stay long the stock,
1567.80s: because I think they're on key trends. It's a leader in the market relative strength.
1571.40s: The market has good strength, all the rest, but I don't want that huge downside to the 50 day moving
1576.44s: average. So I hedge at the money. Instead of doing a full delta hedge, I just consider the
1581.24s: at the money puts for the position I have as my cost of insurance. I know it's going to waste
1584.92s: the way a bit at a time, but it's like you buy fire insurance for your home, you're not upset if
1588.76s: the house doesn't catch fire. Another kind of idea I've had, I've been toying around with a little
1593.72s: bit, was then at the same time looking at the really far out of the money puts, like, okay,
1598.04s: if we do have a break now and we get down to that 50 day moving average, you know, not likely to
1603.48s: get there, but you can get puts for super cheap. And then after just about the time everyone's
1607.16s: freaking out because the stock's down 25% in like two weeks, which is, you know, it's always
1611.56s: stares up elevator down. Well, I can step in with confidence on that same average and I can buy
1617.24s: some stock. And I know from experience, because I have many times of sold on that average when I
1622.04s: should have been buying just because that fear the size of the drop. So just trying to kind of circumvent
1626.44s: those natural tendencies we have to panic when we should be buying.
1630.28s: Yeah, that's really interesting. Have you also looked at potentially going deep in the money?
1637.56s: Yeah, but I didn't want to give, like the game is to not give up too much upside as well,
1641.80s: but I'm not as, you know, experience as you are with options. So I'd love to hear what your
1647.56s: perspective is on it. Yeah, do you have just a general stock you're even remotely interested in now?
1654.44s: Sure, but do you want something that has earnings coming up or that's already past earnings or
1658.04s: earnings away? Whatever makes it happen. Well, let's take a look at let's say Shopify.
1667.32s: So let's say in this instance, you have long long, I'm so used to selling that's so funny.
1676.20s: If you have long shares and for our long shares, how many like what size would we be looking at?
1684.12s: Well, I mean, whatever you could just put a thousand shares just for simplicity's sake.
1689.56s: Perfect. And then do we want to pretend that we have a bit of a profit already?
1694.52s: If so, I can adjust. Yeah, so let's say my cost is around I think $64, let's say.
1698.44s: It would have been better if it was $69, but $64, acceptable.
1702.92s: Okay, so there are a bunch of different ways I look at hedging this kind of thing. The first
1709.96s: thing is if I'm buying options, I actually typically prefer to go further out in time.
1717.00s: And the reason for that, which is you know, baited a K for everything that's within 60 days is
1722.92s: going to be grossly accelerated. So if we look at just the at the money puts here, you're losing
1729.08s: 17 cents every single day. This is all X transit value. So that will all bleed out over time.
1735.48s: Whereas if we go further out in time to like 168 days, something that's still at the money,
1741.40s: your theta is now down to three pennies. Now a couple small notes, the first one is you will
1747.00s: notice that the strike changed here. So your premium quote unquote, right, the amount that you would
1752.44s: lose before your protection kicks in will change slightly. But one of the things I really like to do
1758.68s: for stuff like this is actually to go in the money. Now there's a couple things to know. The first
1763.88s: one is if we go deeper in the money, you're going to get a better delta for delta move. So if
1770.68s: Shopify drops a dollar here, you're going to get 86 cents of that dollar movement as compared to
1775.88s: 37 cents, whatever it is. You're also going to immediately decrease your theta massively in two
1782.20s: instances. The first instance, because we're very far out in time that decreases theta decay.
1787.72s: The second is when you're far in or out of the money. So in this case, you're paying more
1795.48s: upfront, right? There's a bigger upfront cost. This would be 3700 bucks, which we could look at
1800.36s: a couple examples in a second. But of this 3700 bucks, only $210 is actually extrinsic value.
1809.64s: So if you don't get in a accommodating move, which would help you, if you don't get in a
1815.56s: accommodating move and time continues to run here, your option will lose less overall. So you're
1823.24s: putting up 3700 bucks. But if everything remains the same roundabout, you're only going to lose
1830.04s: $200 of that. And that's the rest of this is entranceic value. So this starts to hurt if you get
1837.48s: a big accommodating move. So we can look at an example here. Let's do something like this,
1842.52s: 115 just for an example. So in this example, I'm going to zoom this out a lot so that we could see where
1850.60s: it would start to hurt. What would you typically hedge? So right now, we're hedging a tenth of the
1857.24s: position. Do you like to hedge 100%? Yeah, let's see. You bought 10 puts. Yep. Okay.
1862.12s: So in the example here, you'll notice a couple things. The first one is if we buy too many
1872.36s: puts, we need obviously a big move in our favor before we break out of whatever we're capping.
1880.12s: But the cool part is if you look to the downside, your risk of you're completely capped here.
1886.36s: So we're taking, let me take a look, your P&L, let's say right here, would be 188.
1896.28s: Your P&L here is 18658. So you're not actually losing a bunch of money because the protection
1904.12s: on a percentage basis is actually very low. If you stay about where the same,
1911.80s: whereas because you have so many long deltas, you'll notice we need a pretty big,
1917.80s: accommodating move until we start to break out of it at expiration. That's what the blue line is.
1922.52s: The purple line would be today. So if we compare that real quick, let's say the 110. At the 110,
1928.84s: you'd be making 46 grand. At the 110 in this instance, you're making 28 grand. That's obviously the drag
1936.84s: from the long puts. So that's one of the benefits, though, of going deeper in the money,
1945.80s: is that you actually can get decent protection without having to put on one to one.
1951.64s: Because if you're at the money, let's say you're using this near term at the money, you're saying
1957.16s: four weeks. So we'll just do the 42. It's kind of close. This is giving you 38 deltas.
1964.28s: So let's say we buy 10 of those.
1972.20s: So this is the original example we're looking at of the deep and the money far out in time.
1977.16s: If we use the near term, you'll notice a couple things. You're upfront profit. If you start to get
1983.56s: non-accommodating move, we're going against. You make a little bit less money. 18 grand is,
1988.44s: I think it was 18 eight compared to 11 three.
1991.96s: Expiration. So a little bit less if we don't get our move, but to your point and to the broader
1997.48s: movement here, you have much better upfront return profile. If you get a big move near term,
2005.64s: the issue is to maintain the protection for this. Obviously, you would have to continue doing it.
2010.52s: You were pretty selective. So you might have found a pretty efficient way to manage that. So if
2015.40s: you don't like carrying protection for too long, the other thing that I think could make sense is by
2020.20s: having a shorter term protection profile like 60 or 90 days. And then I actually like to do two
2027.00s: things where I use both in the money for the dollar, delta to delta move, but then also if further
2034.60s: out of the money in case it's a big accommodating move for the hedge itself, it's cheap to hold that,
2041.24s: not a lot of theta decay. But if you get a big move, they're going to have a giant percentage return.
2049.64s: Interesting. Yeah, I think the first example for me is difficult to kind of put on because the
2055.40s: whole point of being in this talk is I have a bullish outlook for it anyway. And in the first place,
2060.04s: the whole point is just to avoid those worst case scenarios like SFCI last August where you drop
2066.36s: like 30% in a week. It's to basically hedge out against those massive kind of downside moves.
2072.28s: But the aim is to not give up the upside. The whole point is you think you're in a pull market,
2076.84s: you have this stock that's doing great. You want to maximize that upside. So that's why it's trying
2082.12s: to kind of walk that fine line. I'm interesting. If you can maybe show something like you were talking
2087.72s: about how if you also bought something out of the money, how that would profile that would bring you.
2094.20s: Yeah, definitely. And a couple of notes on that, the first thing is I think it also depends on
2101.16s: how you feel about the downside risk. Like if the goal is to purely cap and not have any downside
2108.68s: risk whatsoever, completely agree with you. That going super deep in the money is a more expensive
2115.48s: expression of that. The main benefit to that is you're going to preserve more of your upfront
2121.40s: profit today as it is. So if we don't get a giant accommodating move, in your case, I agree with
2128.92s: you. I don't think it makes a ton of sense specifically because like that's the entire premise of
2133.40s: you being in that trade. Yeah, exactly. For that big accommodating move. So the way that I think about
2140.04s: that then is if you want the cheaper style hedge, then I actually would probably just go a little
2146.28s: further out in time because in this example, even if you go right at the money, you're losing about
2153.08s: set that's worth theta to case the highest because X trends value is the highest at the money.
2158.04s: So you're losing, you know, seven cents of your four sixty five every day. Pretty manageable,
2165.48s: but that's not insignificant, especially as a percentage basis of the premium. So if you do
2170.52s: something similar to that, maybe just go out to like 60. I would go out to like 90 days if I could
2176.12s: not expecting it to hold it for the whole 90 to be clear. It's almost like you're putting a deposit
2180.76s: down, but you're expecting to take some of it back. I wouldn't hold this all the way into expiration.
2186.52s: By going further out in time beyond that 60 day window, we just really decrease the amount of theta
2192.20s: we're paying on a daily basis. So in this case for that same, let's look at the same strike. Let's
2197.56s: just use the 80. The 80 in this instance, you're paying four sixty five losing seven cents a day.
2203.24s: If we use that same 80, you're paying five seventy five, but you're losing four cents a day.
2210.36s: But in an extreme downside move, you lose more extrinsic value with the further out option, right?
2216.84s: In an extreme down move, you would lose more theta you're saying or on the, well, like I mean,
2223.56s: like at the 80s, let's say so ultimately, let's say the stock drops to $50 doesn't come back by
2229.72s: expiration. In this case here, you're losing that five seventy versus let's say the four dollars
2236.92s: with the shorter term option. If I see what you're saying, so a couple things, if the stock does drop
2245.16s: there, these are going to go up in value. No, no, I understand. Yeah, no, I understand that, of course,
2252.04s: but I mean, like, like your delta is going to be lower on this one, right? So like as it's kind of
2257.00s: dropping down, that extrinsic value is being lost along the way, there's more to be lost like
2261.48s: overall. So that's, I mean, like let's say you buy both options and the stock drops significantly,
2266.76s: the one that you bought further out is going to be the more expensive way in that case of protection.
2273.24s: Yeah, we can take a look at it because in both of these instances, if the stock drops,
2278.28s: both of those positions are going to look healthy. Yeah, I know, but I'm thinking of it in terms of
2283.88s: like holistically with the stock. I see, I see, I see, I see, I see.
2294.52s: So this top one here is the 15 March and what scenario do you want to look at it? Let's say this
2300.60s: goes to $60 by expiry or whatever. Yeah. So in this case, you would have a net position
2310.04s: positive $11,300. Okay. Let's see with the other option.
2316.28s: 10,200. Yeah. So that's what I meant there. Like there's that extra cost in more of a worst case
2322.20s: scenario. Definitely, definitely, especially if your intention is to hold it to expiration.
2328.76s: Because the, and that's also another great caveat, right, is to think about the way that you
2333.80s: manage the option hedge itself. Because for me, again, depending on the way you think about the
2342.12s: hedge, it's double edge sword. You want the hedge on and when the hedge is working, you want the
2347.56s: hedge on because the hedge is working. That's not necessarily a great time to unwind the hedge.
2352.28s: However, if the intent is to take it to expiration, you have to remember, in this case,
2358.76s: you will have to cycle this, this 15 March several times in order to get the same overall
2366.20s: protection as the 19 April. So this 15 March actually comes out to be more expensive in that scenario.
2374.52s: But that's if you're maintaining a continual, at least a hedge for that 90 days or whatever.
2378.52s: So a lot of it also comes down to the timeline of the hedge.
2381.32s: So yeah, it gets tricky because I'm using these in conjunction with a view of the stock and the
2387.24s: direction of that stock. So like, for example, I had hedges on sq block going into the beginning of
2394.04s: the year. And so like I had to manage that that option for these exact same reasons. So I had bought
2399.40s: the stock, I think it's $75. I don't know if you want to bring a chart up on sq. So I bought that
2406.92s: like at $75 in December, that area, no, it was a 75 or yeah, I was like, I knew I was
2412.68s: leading the move, but I just, I wasn't sure how this market was going to end the year. So I bought
2416.76s: at 75, then it was like an 80 or so. I said, you know, this market's probably going to come off or
2421.40s: it's going to explode vertical right now. I'm not sure which way. So what I did was I bought some
2424.60s: puts and I said, if this does break, we're probably going to break back down to that 50 day movie
2430.68s: average area of 65 or 66. So when I actually did get down to there, I pulled off my hedges.
2436.76s: And so I kind of, I kind of used that gain on the put to kind of lower the effective cost of my
2441.48s: stock. That's the only reason why I'm still in the stock. I actually had bought the out of the money
2445.32s: puts, which I used to even add down at those levels, which I'm still still fighting with overall.
2449.48s: It hasn't really rebounded aggressively, but at least despite the drop, but definitely you're right,
2453.56s: because if you don't manage the puts after a move happens, then yeah, there's that big kind of,
2458.20s: you know, that big value there that that will ultimately, you know, waste away, whatever time
2464.04s: value is left in there will go away if you don't kind of manage it. Yeah. And I think the way
2469.48s: that I typically look at out of the money versus in the money, it really just comes down to the
2473.80s: deductible, right? It comes onto the strike because if if you're buying it at 73, 75, whatever.
2481.72s: And we get up to 80, you're like, okay, time to put on a hedge. Depending on what strike you pick,
2489.48s: that's your upfront deductible for whatever your loss is going to be. So if you go further out
2494.52s: of the money, all that means is you have a bigger upfront deductible before the protection starts
2499.96s: to kick in. Now that is good in a big move like this. If you have a big move, those far out of the
2507.88s: money will compound quickly gain gamma gain delta. And then obviously they start to offset meaningfully
2514.44s: where they don't help you too much is in a smaller move. Yeah. And that's where the higher delta
2519.80s: starts to come in. But the good part about you going further out of the money is it's also just
2525.24s: cheaper. It's a more efficient purchase. The main issue with at the money stuff, especially
2530.76s: less than 60 days is you're just losing a lot of theta decay. If I liked at the money, I would try
2537.64s: to gain that same delta going a little further out in time to your point though. If you're not going
2542.28s: to cycle that edge, you do have a larger hedge exposure that will eventually have to be dealt with.
2548.04s: But if you typically have a four week hedge that you take in and then put back out to me, I would just
2554.20s: be out in that second expiration of front, which will help offset some cost.
2559.40s: That's really interesting. You know, the thing is, I find it's in a way, it's almost unfortunate.
2562.84s: So many option guys are just option traders and stock guys are stock traders. That was one of the
2567.48s: beauty of working on a trading desk. You had a little more of sharing of ideas. See if you buy a book on
2571.80s: options. It's always like so option centric. It's like when you kind of trying to combine the two,
2576.84s: it starts to require like a good understanding of both to kind of build a strategy that works for
2580.76s: you. But I think the beautiful thing is that you can get to different scenarios where I think I
2585.72s: found it's interesting. There's one quote by I think Paul Tudor Jones has the best offense. It's a good
2589.88s: defense, which I'm sure he's taking from someone else. But I've found since I've been kind of working
2594.44s: with this approach, it's allowed me to be much more aggressive because once I have some good protection
2599.72s: in the past where I'd rather usually be like sitting around saying, okay, well, I'm already
2603.40s: pretty exposed. I mean, let's say, okay, I was able to finance that protection with gains.
2607.24s: And now let's look around for other opportunities. So yeah, if it's a bad market reversal,
2612.12s: you know, there's the cost of your puts, whatever, and the cost. But if the market continues,
2616.68s: you're actually getting the opportunity to put on a lot more leverage. But in a safe way,
2620.36s: because you have protection on some parts. So it's kind of freed up a different kind of mindset
2627.24s: to be a little more aggressive while being defensive. So I've been enjoying it to something I'm,
2631.80s: I always love to try new things. I think I've tried every strategy. I could just because it
2635.48s: always learns something new and it's been it's been fun to play with.
2638.68s: Well, one that I that I still am just so curious. I'd love to do a study some time like to to see
2646.36s: how you would think about this stuff is like rather than using the equity, using options to gain
2652.20s: your long exposure. Because in that kind of scenario, let's say we're trading square again,
2659.96s: back in and we're getting in at 75 like the price strategy that I would run if I was a
2665.48s: cancelsam style traders, what I call a ratio called diagonal where I'm just using a far out in time.
2673.72s: So again, typically like 90 to 180 days or something like this far out in time, deep in the money
2680.52s: call, so something like this 90 delta. So you gain the leverage of the option. If I buy one,
2687.56s: I'm controlling 100 shares and I'm paying 2500 bucks. In this scenario, if we compare these,
2695.56s: we can get rid of this. And then we can just look at buying.
2700.76s: So if we compare the two different strategies, if we're long equity and we get a plus one standard
2710.60s: deviation move to 74 50 for more we're at right now, you make 675. In that same scenario with the
2718.20s: options, you make 589. The difference is instead of putting up 67 bucks times 100, you're only putting
2729.48s: up 2500 bucks. So technically, I can gain the same size by effectively doing two of these and
2736.04s: I still would be smaller actually in terms of overall cost, but now I'm making 1200 bucks.
2742.84s: So yeah, and by going far out in time, you give yourself a ton of room to move in. It's kind of
2749.32s: those same benefits that we were talking about before where there's not a lot of theta decay.
2754.52s: It's mostly intrinsic value. So it's just a pure leverage play. It's a direction of leverage play.
2761.00s: Yeah. Yeah. But if I'm typically trading like a leverage directional strategy,
2768.68s: that's normally what I would I go to. And then to your point, I actually really think there's a lot
2773.00s: of efficacy behind like mixing options and equities. Like I trade a covered strangle and the
2780.20s: basis of that position is long shares and something. And then I will amplify that by selling
2787.24s: short calls at a ratio. So I'm not capping my upside short puts to gain more exposure also
2792.84s: to capitalize on puts you. I also like to integrate ratio diagonals with longs actually as a hedge
2799.40s: the offset cost, but options, man. Yeah, there's it's interesting. You know, like I can I can
2807.72s: I'm aware too, you know, like long stock, long put, it's, you know, you're synthetically long call.
2812.36s: I get it, you know, but for me, it's kind of it's not so, you know, part of it is, like I said,
2817.24s: lever once you have hedge things out, then you do have that lever. Just like it's like you switch from
2820.92s: being long stock to long calls. So obviously you can go out and do other things, but it's like my
2825.00s: mind that's still kind of, you know, stock trader first building up this position for an extended move.
2829.48s: And you know, avoiding, if you're always just long calls, because then you can, you know, you can
2834.12s: take it to the logical extreme saying, well, why ever buy stock just always be long calls and your
2838.44s: risk is always limited, but then there's all the, the K and all the rest you have to deal with. So it's
2842.12s: always like that, you know, it's that interesting always that managing, it always comes down to that
2846.12s: same kind of thing. So it's almost like I, in theory, I'm, I'm a long stock, but I'm switching to a
2851.24s: long call when I feel it's a high risk situation, then I'm going back to long stock, you know, so, so I'm
2855.72s: only, you know, doing that at certain points in time to minimize the drag of option decay, you know,
2861.40s: so it's definitely, it's definitely something that I'm looking more and more into for sure.
2866.12s: Yeah. And in your scenario, like, if I were trading up a year plus thesis, I would use the equity
2872.92s: myself. I would just forego the leverage. If there's something that I feel there's a propensity for
2880.44s: a shorter term move, that's exactly when I would use options, because most of my directional plays,
2885.32s: they're not to the same magnitude of what you're looking at. So a lot of the stuff I'm playing,
2889.96s: it's typically expressed within three months, something like that. So I'll use six month options
2895.88s: to gain the requisite exposure to it. But yeah, when I look at really good stock traders that
2902.28s: can pick directions so well, I'm always just thinking, man, like your fucking pockets would just
2907.72s: overfill with money. If we just use options, just sometimes, just, I like the sound of pockets over
2914.52s: filling with money. It's a good, it sounds good. That's the sales pitch. That's the sales pitch
2919.96s: to continue trying to convince people to move more into options is I'm going to bait everybody with
2926.12s: the, you know, Scrooge McDuck gold coin bathtub. The truth is, you want me buying because you're selling,
2933.64s: that's the truth. I know the way it works. Unfortunately, for those, for the hedges that you're buying
2941.40s: now, I probably am selling those. I know. I'm not selling this the 60 day plus because the
2946.44s: thing in case it's just too slow. I want that faded a cave curve maximize, bro. I want that
2952.44s: steep peak crashing. That's what I'm looking for. It's amazing, you know, because every strategy
2960.28s: like has like such common themes, you know, so it's like, now I'm more trend focused now, but like
2966.60s: I was a market maker for years. And it's like, I wasn't really focused on big trends in and out. And
2971.08s: so, you know, you're trying to take that data to the K as a market maker, you're trying to take
2974.84s: that spread over and over. And your mindset's so different. Whereas you're just like, you know,
2979.48s: turn and burn, like as much as you can. It's all about like, you know, turn over and turn over and
2983.56s: turn over. And so it's like, it takes dramatic changes of mindset. But at the end of the day,
2987.88s: it's like, so the way you talk, it's like, I know exactly what you're thinking and what you feel
2991.80s: like is I've done the same mindset just through express through a different vehicle, which was
2995.96s: market making in a different way. But I totally get it. Well, and the cool part is is, you know, like,
3002.44s: I always talk about finding something that aligns with you like, just the way you think about
3006.60s: the world, right? Because I've told you this a million times, like, I've never seen a 300% year.
3011.72s: I've never had that. But I've had two down years, my whole trading career from 2007, too. So the,
3018.76s: like, just our games are different. And it's obviously the way that you think about markets and risk,
3025.48s: like even to be able to build a 40% position and like individual stock man, like, I would struggle
3031.16s: with that. If it wasn't some sort of like index ETF, Secretary ETF, like a really just something I
3036.20s: would just was really, really convicted and but typically I can't find stuff that scratches that
3042.76s: itch from me more often than not be like, ah, like you, I consider myself risk adverse. So I'd be like,
3047.72s: fuck, how can I offset some of this risk? And well, if I'm in a Secretary TF or an index ETF,
3053.64s: that gives me a little diversification. So sure, that scenario. So I find these kinds of conversations.
3061.00s: It's literally one of the reasons why I love talking to you so much because it puts a completely
3067.00s: different approach in front of me. It's like completely different. And I think that that's one of
3071.16s: the most beautiful things about trading, to be honest. I agree. I think trading, when you get deep
3076.36s: into it, it's amazing on so many different levels, you know, and everyone has their profiles. I
3082.52s: think a part of getting to consistent profitability is after trying many things and not wanting to
3089.72s: listen to yourself, finally saying, okay, this is the way I'm built and this is how I can trade.
3094.60s: Because if you try and do it with someone, like for example, like Bill O'Neill, what you know,
3098.20s: again, like I love his stuff and I model my work around his, but you know, I've done my own
3102.84s: history and a different things as well. But you know, like this guy, he was built different.
3107.72s: Like I know from stories and even his son is spoken about it like in the 90s. He had
3112.52s: he had 200% of his wealth, which was already sizable in Amgen and it went on a 400% advance.
3119.48s: And he made, I don't know how much money. I mean, you won't become a billionaire without
3123.16s: you having that kind of size. But like for me, it's like, so I mean, you find I'm concentrated.
3127.32s: And I sit back and I look at him and you know, they call him the ice man. They say he had
3131.00s: ice in his veins because he was cool about it. Like he wasn't stressed about it. Like I'm
3134.84s: probably more stressed with a 50% position than he was with a 200. But that's his care. I don't
3140.04s: think I can sleep at night if I had 200% of my account in one stock. But that's where I'll build
3144.44s: different. They're all built different. You know, so that's why that's why, you know, I always aim
3149.80s: to be a legend. But that's why there's some people are legends and others are very good traders,
3154.28s: good traders, you know, trying to be good traders and you know, they're the rest, you know,
3159.08s: so it's you got to try and level up over and over. It's like a constant never ending
3163.48s: battle to improve yourself. Yeah. And then there's the fucking degenerates like me that are just out
3168.20s: here just doing whatever. We're just flopping around. Yeah. You talk yourself down too much, man.
3172.92s: You talk yourself down too much. Yeah. It's I think the there, I really do think that there's
3180.84s: fascinating cross section between like, can slim general style and options. I just haven't seen
3187.72s: it done. Do you know anybody that does that? Not really. I think now, you know, options markets
3194.52s: have become more liquid. Also, a lot of the stocks that like tend to be canceling are more liquid
3199.64s: these days. But you know, originally, the S in Can slim, if you look at the early editions of the
3205.32s: book, stood for small capitalization, which then eventually you changed the sales and all the rest
3210.12s: there. But so small cap stocks don't work too well if you want liquidity and if you want options.
3213.80s: It's hard enough to trade that already a lot of stocks have won't trade just because the
3216.92s: liquidity is not there. And if you're taking on size and stuff that you don't want those gap
3221.48s: moments where you can't get out of the stock kind of thing. So I think that's why it hasn't really
3226.12s: been done. But you know, it's the first time for everything, right? Markets keep evolving.
3231.16s: It's like it's always the same game that just slightly evolves to creating new opportunities.
3234.36s: Well, and I mean, like you're saying, we also see SMCI $300 stock doubling in two weeks. So
3240.36s: maybe, you know, fuck the small cap stuff, you know, just fine. Apparently just fine $300 stocks.
3246.44s: Yeah, I know. You know, and there are, you know, I would I find more impressive than that because
3251.24s: you know, now it's becoming a little bit bigger market cap. But to see meta, which is already a
3255.16s: monster stock, move up 20% on earnings, that is insane. Like what's the market cap that it picked up
3262.44s: just to like never mind like SMCI. Yeah, there's there could be like, you know, I think you go from
3266.20s: a 15 billion to 30 billion. You know, it's a surprise girl story. But to like put on 200 billion
3272.36s: a market cap like overnight, like you know how incredible like I mean, that's got to be like the
3277.96s: GDP of some countries like it's just incredible. Yeah, that's when I started. Yeah, because I was
3284.28s: when I was looking at SMCI, I was just like, how many shares does this thing even have, right? What
3288.84s: is it? Like 55, 55.8 million or something. It's like number of shares is like pretty damn small.
3295.40s: And when I first was looking at it, I was like, wow, that's kind of novel because if you start
3300.20s: looking at the other text, like how many shares does meta have just had a curiosity?
3306.28s: Yeah, man, 2.5, 6, 2.6 billion. Yeah, a lot of shares.
3314.52s: And obviously, yeah, massive. One other thing I did want to touch on quickly, I don't know if
3322.60s: you still have a few minutes, but I would love to see if you'd be willing to walk us through
3328.68s: maybe in a bridge version. I have plenty of time. I just don't want to keep you too long, but
3333.24s: I'd love to see if you could give us like a Clifth Notes version or whatever of your process
3337.72s: for evaluating these kinds of stocks. Sure, you know, maybe we can go over as we also spoke about
3343.72s: kind of market direction, which I think would be helpful because one thing I've noticed about these
3347.32s: kind of stocks, just, you know, growth in general, whatever, it's highly dependent on environment.
3352.68s: You know, so like I always tell people and stuff, you know, like, yeah, the stock story is important,
3357.32s: like SMCI is an important story, whatever. But these moves, no matter as good as a story is,
3362.76s: these moves always happen in a conducive market environment. It's like it could be the best
3367.00s: story in the world, but if the market's no good, the stock won't react till next quarter. So,
3372.04s: like step one is you have to identify that healthy environment. So if you want to, I can share my
3376.76s: screen real quick. Yeah, man, please. Where is it here? Okay. Can you see, there we go. There's
3385.16s: meta up, right? So at the bottom, this is something I've been tracking now for a few years. This is
3389.88s: basically these green and red bars shows the net highs or lows for the NAS. So basically,
3396.36s: the number of 52 week highs today, minus number of 52 week lows, there's more highs. You got a green
3401.00s: bar. If you have more lows, you got a red bar. And it's such a simple tool, but this has become
3406.60s: really, so obviously meta last year was like a vertical type of move. But if you take up, let's say,
3411.24s: I don't know what kind of what stock can I bring up here. Let's say Shopify, okay.
3415.32s: A stock that was a little less in its own kind of world of Nvidia or meta. I mean, you can really see
3421.00s: all the weakness comes in the stock when we kind of move from this period of net highs back to net
3426.20s: lows. You get all these bad breaks. And then as soon as the market becomes conducive and more
3429.72s: stocks are breaking out, you see these very nice powerful trends. So for me, like the first step,
3436.84s: and this I think goes to show, regardless of what the QQQ is doing, because again, it's been kind
3441.32s: of in its own world. Let me just move this up a second. If you take a look at just internally,
3446.92s: what most things are going on, this has been a very difficult time for someone looking for trends,
3452.04s: because you have these short cycles of, you know, a good environment, more stocks making new highs.
3457.00s: And all of a sudden, most stocks are making new lows. And this is rare. So most people will look at
3461.16s: this and be like, that just must be how the market is. Generally, if you take a look, you go back,
3464.92s: like this is the COVID bull market, solid bank of green. If you go back further,
3470.84s: you can see this is like that 2016 to 2018 period, you know, you can call it the Trump rally.
3476.60s: And then after that, like this was a solid bank of green. So more stocks doing better than not.
3483.40s: Let me bring up the QQQ to go back further. One second.
3487.72s: Which one fact that I've been trading QLD a bit. And it's because when I normally run the
3494.44s: coverage triangle, it's in something like IWM, which has been lagging hard. And I was like,
3498.92s: I need exposure to something that's working. So yeah.
3503.48s: Yeah.
3504.52s: No, so I just say that so in healthy markets, you will see these sizeable trends in their highs.
3510.04s: It's just the way markets function. So this has been a tricky market because it's been led by the
3515.32s: few. Yeah. I mean, most stocks obviously are off the lows of where they were in 2022. But the
3520.68s: powerful moves, like the sustained moves have been in the few. But getting this right, like learning
3527.80s: went to operate in these environments of net progress. That's where all the fireworks come up.
3532.20s: So what I did was if you go even a step further and this is what really was kind of eye opening
3535.96s: for me, we can overlay the same kind of color coding right onto the charts. Let me just kind of,
3540.68s: and these are free tools I publish for anyone who wants them. They're called US markets net highs
3545.48s: lows. And this is the overlay if you want to overlay it on the charts. So if anyone who wants to
3549.40s: kind of add this and trading view, you can just add it on. So if you bring up, for example,
3553.56s: like Amazon, this is something that I found really interesting. If you go back in time,
3558.20s: and here, let me just kind of take off the rest of this noise, all the averages and all the rest
3563.40s: and minimize this. So the interesting thing is if you put a log chart and you look at, okay,
3567.80s: Amazon's been one of the great kind of girl stories the past 20 years obviously. Where did all
3574.76s: of the good happen? Where did all the bad happen? So all of the like the lengthy advances always
3578.60s: took place with net highs, all of the pain, the sharp drops. And this is a log scale. So these are,
3583.72s: recently sharp drops all take place when the market environment's not conducive or all the sideways
3589.32s: volatility happens when the market's not conducive. And you can see here all of the big drops. So
3594.04s: getting the environment right is so key. And even if you look at Monster Beverage, which is again,
3598.28s: one of the great market winners, if you take a look at its massive early advance, this is such a
3605.08s: cool chart to look at. So this stock goes from when they invented the monster drink from this
3611.08s: is split adjusted, but from like four cents to like four dollars, I mean, unbelievable move, right?
3617.56s: So you're almost going vertical. Where are the few times this thing actually stops the catch its
3621.72s: breath? It's when the market turns sour. So you have the stock that's going up like a hundred fold.
3627.56s: But when the market goes sour, it still puts it into sleep. So for me, that became just a really kind
3632.76s: of like a light bulb moment. And I've looked at so many different tools. This is something like I know
3636.36s: like Willem O'Neill will have his fall through day and distribution days and people use averages
3640.52s: and all the rest. But you're relying a lot on the index and the index is now are far more skewed
3646.52s: than they've ever been. I mean, like that's just a statistical fact. And there's never been a time
3651.32s: with the S&P 500 at all time highs and the Russell still in a bear market minus 20s never happened before.
3656.12s: So this is it is unique times in that respect. But if you're not just trading that if you're not playing
3661.08s: just the game of being in the markets and you're trying to find, you know, those big growth names,
3666.28s: those big movers, adapting to those healthy environments is when all the fireworks happen. And you
3671.16s: can see it. If you any kind of stocks you bring up, let me think of even just like for example,
3676.60s: Square, we were talking about Square before. I mean, when did this stock get back into gear? It's
3682.12s: when the market turned healthy and you have this big powerful move up. When did it get smoked every
3685.64s: time when the market wasn't working? And it's only amplified by whether or not it's a quality stock
3690.44s: or not. So if you bring up let's say SMCI, which is under heavy, heavy accumulation now, where do the
3695.24s: monster moves happen? Well, they happen when the market was also conducive. So like really first step
3701.00s: before you're making any other kind of decision for me at least is I'm going to be wanting to kind of
3706.36s: get very aggressive when the markets are already healthy. And for me, just logically, if more stocks
3711.96s: are making 52 week highs and 52 week lows, there's more accumulation. It's the most like kind of
3717.08s: basic test of whether or not you have a healthy market or not. It's not market cap weighted.
3721.72s: It's not even you know, advanced decline where you could say like, you know, it was a stock only
3724.92s: up 10 cents today. Like no, did the stock make higher prices in any other time in the past year?
3730.12s: Someone's buying that stock. Is this stock breaking to new lows with the past year? Someone wants
3733.96s: out of that stock is I find it's the most kind of basic and pure measure. And it's one that's
3739.00s: been very helpful for me to navigate, which was a really kind of back and forth year last year
3744.04s: for someone trying to do trend following. It was tough. Yeah, it's a really, really cool tool,
3750.20s: especially the overlay question for you. Do you have a perspective on the duration that starts
3757.64s: to become more meaningful if we're in net highs or net lows? Right. So obviously, these are like
3763.00s: highlighting if there's like three days in a row, but some of them are very brief and some of
3767.48s: them obviously are quite wide. Is there a duration where you're like, okay, we're starting to see
3772.12s: like a clear net high trend being set here? So it's hard to know ahead of time. Usually if you're
3779.16s: overlaid this with interest rates, especially high yields, you'll see a really strong correlation.
3783.32s: So really, I mean, that link yields in the markets always been always will be. But kind of beyond
3788.52s: looking for that, what I found to be more meaningful is if you actually kind of break this,
3793.72s: if you double click on this, you can instead of seeing the net number, you can see both the highs
3798.20s: and the lows. So if you kind of plot it like this, you won't see the net, you'll see the number
3801.48s: of highs and lows. I found that rather than looking for like how many days or duration or whatever,
3806.52s: if you kind of, let me just get the right number there. One second, let me put a horizontal line.
3817.08s: I found when you have about 50 or more net new highs, you're probably in a healthier environment.
3824.12s: So you'll, let me kind of take off the polka dot stripes for a second.
3829.88s: But if you take a look, if you kind of ignore the background and you look at just like the
3834.12s: environments when you have, you know, you're have 50 or more stocks making new highs,
3838.28s: that's a good secondary test. So there are sometimes where the market is just kind of generally quiet
3843.72s: and like, yeah, maybe there's, you know, 17 new highs and only six new lows on that day. But there's
3849.48s: no meaningful direction in either way. So I noticed that the really good bull markets, not only do
3854.60s: they have more highs and lows, but you can see here, for example, in 2020, 2021, like you're
3860.60s: meaningfully above 50 stocks, making you 50 to week highs each day. So I kind of use those two
3866.04s: to bounce to kind of gauge whether the signals is a little more valid or not. And for me, it's not
3871.32s: like again, an all or nothing, like, oh, net highs, I've got to buy 100%. It's like, okay, let's look
3875.72s: now to start building those positions. And the market feedback will guide you further.
3881.08s: Do you have a preferred exchange to focus on? It's funny that you have this because I have a
3885.80s: similar version of net highs and lows. I don't have the cool color coding, mines and thinkerswim,
3891.08s: but I actually use two moving averages with mine. I use like a 50 period and then a 21 period.
3897.64s: Oh, no, a 150 period and a 21 period moving average. Have you ever first tinkered with any moving
3903.40s: averages with this? Or do you use that fixed level of 50? I have, but then I found like the lookback
3909.24s: period makes a difference for fast moving like, you know, it's interesting. If you look at let's say
3915.88s: market breakdowns, let me just bring up, let's a cute, cute again. And right, you know,
3920.84s: if you have a lot of positions on market breakdowns, happen fast and you want to be cognizant
3925.72s: of those. So this kind of like saved me in 2020 because if you take a look at when that top came in
3930.84s: and the whole COVID thing was starting, by looking at just the net number, if there's like a dramatic
3936.12s: shift in the markets, it will show up right away. And that's why I like to often also break the
3941.72s: numbers apart. Is it, are we getting a net number because just, you know, there's no new highs
3946.52s: today, the markets taking a pause or the market breaking down. You can really see
3952.92s: when that bridge move started, you can just see how even on the first day or two, you had a surge
3959.08s: of stocks making 52-week lows. I mean, like you were three or four days from the bull market high,
3964.20s: but you almost had the same number of lows as you had during the depth of the correction of the
3968.20s: summer before before when I mean, these were extreme figures obviously. So rather than use the
3974.68s: moving averages, I'll just kind of look at those levels and I'll dial in to see like, okay,
3978.92s: is this a normal pause because stocks are taking a break? It's been a hot run or are we seeing an
3983.96s: increase as well under the hood and new lows breaking down? To me, that's kind of how I like to
3987.96s: implement it. Yeah, yeah, that's actually really, really cool. And then do you have a preferred
3992.36s: exchange that you focus on? I see this as the NASDAQ. Yeah, this is NASDAQ. I found NASDAQ
3997.16s: because again, that probably comes down to style for my style where I'm looking for high-grow
4001.00s: NASDAQs more representative. Some people like to put them all in there, which you have that
4005.40s: option if you want them to mix or if some people say like, look, if I was someone focusing more on
4010.04s: slower moving stocks for a com or portfolio, I would use NYSE. So I think it just depends
4016.28s: the flavor you're looking for. But I found the NASDAQ maybe because the more sensitive stock gives
4023.24s: the earlier signal, I find it's helpful to look at the NASDAQ, but that's my personal preference.
4028.52s: That's a good way to frame it as well. That would actually be the statistical side of my mind would
4034.44s: be so fascinated to do like run a study between the two of them in terms of their predictive
4039.24s: capabilities, like the different exchanges. But that's one of the cleanest ways I can think of
4047.00s: the measure broad market sense mix. You know, people spend, I find a lot of time chasing their
4051.64s: tails, right? They're like, what what what what is this economic? What's m2 doing? What's the yield
4057.16s: inversion? Like there's a lot of stuff you could look at. And the cool part is at least from a
4062.36s: trading perspective, most of that is going to be baked into what you're seeing here.
4066.44s: I agree. And you know, like I'll always talk well of Bill O'Neill because I, you know, I was so
4071.72s: fortunate to meet him in 2010 and I think he's done amazing things and all the rest.
4075.48s: But you know, to be, I don't want to say critical, but I think just markets change. You have to be
4079.32s: aware of tools like one of the tools he taught and used for many years was the distribution day
4083.80s: concept where, you know, if the market kind of came down more than 0.2% on increased volume and
4089.16s: he had all these kind of rules. First of all, if you had four days in a 20 day window, then five,
4093.00s: then six, because markets change, it just kind of stopped working. Like I found as an effective tool.
4098.12s: So I mean, so sometimes, you know, I find like you said, this is just such a
4102.84s: simple to the point tool that doesn't require complex analysis. And at the end of the day,
4108.60s: yeah, even if it's lower quality stocks breaking down and you know, you could say, I'm in a higher
4114.28s: quality stock, those are kind of like the canaries in the coal mine. Like, yeah, you know, maybe a
4118.92s: stock doesn't have to go up, but it doesn't have to break down. If stocks are actively being sold
4123.56s: down to 52 week lows, there's some kind of problem if it's happening on a wide, wide basis. So
4129.56s: I find this has just been the most helpful tool for me to navigate, which, you know, the markets,
4133.96s: which have been some pretty abnormal times with between inflation, the spread between large caps,
4139.48s: small caps and all the rest is it's been it's been a weird couple of years, man.
4144.52s: You massively so at least from an option trading perspective, though, it's kind of nice. I know
4150.20s: for you guys, it's not so much sorry about that, but last year was fantastic. Yeah, I can imagine.
4157.08s: I can imagine. And you know, that's a frustrating thing because you look at the QQQ and you say,
4162.12s: wow, last year was the best year ever for certain names, but if you kind of like look around,
4167.00s: I don't want to say our confesses the best gauge, but there I feel like there's no great gauge
4170.84s: for just growth in general. I mean, look at the just up, down up. I mean, if you weren't quick
4174.36s: to take a profit somewhere, you were smoked so many times, even if you look at the say the QQQJ,
4178.84s: the next 100 largest stocks outside of the Nasdaq 100, I mean, just take a look at the back and
4185.96s: forward. And that's fine. But if you're someone who's trying to play trend, that's a difficult
4191.08s: market to work with because by the time you put your positions on, the trends over two weeks later,
4195.00s: and it's like a V top. And if you aren't if you aren't quick on your feet, and if the individual
4199.16s: stocks you hold are the wrong stocks, and you don't cut your losses, I mean, there can be some
4203.32s: dramatic moves against you, things like, I mean, we always look at what worked out well, but you have
4207.72s: to understand the risk you're taking, like for example, digital ocean, you can see my by original
4212.20s: kind of like, oh, is this something going on in the bad earnings and from 46, you're $18 or $19,
4217.88s: and it's another cloud stock, but it's smoked, right? So you have to know what you're dealing with,
4223.48s: how to work with it. There's big upside, but there's also downside. You got to manage it to
4226.84s: with them for sure, for sure. It looked like it could have been a cup with handle, and then the
4233.32s: handle just fell off. Yeah, well, there's some, you know, there's some things that were just too deep
4238.28s: of a move. And it was something like this, you're just watching and nothing to do, and then all of a
4242.04s: sudden you just kind of die. So we'll see what happens. I, but again, look, you know, when did the
4247.88s: mark, when did it, when did it fall apart, when the market went sour, and when did it start to come
4251.48s: back when the market turned healthy again? So that's just the, the power of, of knowing your market
4256.20s: environment is really, really important. Yeah, and what, one of the things that your net high's
4261.88s: lows have that mine doesn't that I really, really like, and I think it adds a lot of clarity,
4267.00s: um, is both sides of it together, because the way that mine's coded right now, I'm, I'm literally,
4274.20s: after we get off, I'm literally going to see how to change mine to see if I can add like that lower
4278.76s: part, because that's, that's such a, a really great perspective. I feel like it adds a lot to it.
4285.24s: Um, yeah, because mine right now, obviously, is just tracking the net highs and how many are net lows
4290.44s: and how many? Well, I think a good example, just like more recent, is he at the beginning of the
4297.16s: year? I mean, we had a really hot market coming off of October when pretty vertical, even let's say,
4301.64s: we'll bring up, uh, I WM just to give like, uh, a less concentrated perspective. We had this
4306.68s: really hot move. And then we had this pullback, but the pullback was really just because the number
4312.04s: of stocks making new highs took a break. Yeah, he had a little bit of a pickup and, and, and new lows,
4317.64s: but nothing dramatic. So this, you know, that's why for me, I was still, you know, state bullishly
4322.60s: position was looking to add to things and all the rest, you know, and it's, you haven't seen a
4326.52s: massive breakdown and look, look at other points in time where things got a lot messier, a lot,
4332.04s: a lot quicker. So I think it's important to look under the hood too. It provides that added value.
4337.48s: Yeah, yeah, that's absolutely awesome. Well, dude, thank you so much for walking through that.
4342.44s: I absolutely love that. I think on, on our next session, it would be cool to work through like a
4350.36s: couple, maybe like a stock or two and to see how you piece this whole thing together into the,
4356.76s: you know, the MacRusso special. And yeah, I think I would, I would really just love to, to run
4364.04s: through that process with you because the one of the things I find really interesting about the way
4369.80s: that you and I both trade is that there are, with all traders, there's so many similarities,
4375.16s: but then there are key departures that send us into me using derivatives and you sticking
4380.68s: primarily equities, but the way that you're looking at broad market trend analyzing sub trends and
4386.28s: whatnot, those are all like very native to me, but I think a big difference in something I would
4391.72s: love to really dive into with you is like your capability to find these things that are like spring
4397.24s: coil to, whereas I'm using leverage to create decent returns on much smaller moves. Maybe it's just
4404.76s: because I'm a lazy to generate. So I just use fake online money to make money, but you're looking
4410.28s: for actual moves. As long as you fill those pockets up, that's a matter, Eric. I tell you what,
4417.24s: that is what I tell myself because I love trading, but as long as it, you know, keeps making dollars,
4421.40s: it makes sense to me. That's it, that's it, that's the way. Well, dude, thanks for hanging out.
4426.60s: I will obviously throw all of your socials in the notes below, but if there is any specific
4433.40s: thing that you want to drive people to, I'd love to hear it. I know you're on YouTube, I started
4437.88s: YouTube channel as well, the Crucial Insights, or Twitter, a trader underscore M-Cruise, so those are
4442.76s: the two, that along with my website, CrucialInsights.com. So, I don't even want to learn a little more,
4448.36s: those are the places you can find me at.
4450.04s: You're absolutely pleasure as per always. Thank you for hanging out, man.
4454.04s: Thanks so much, man. Appreciate it. Thanks for having me on.
4456.20s: Yep. Take care.
