0.00s: What's up everyone? Somebody shot me a DM asking what I thought of the volatility movement
5.96s: in GameStop today. And as you know, I'm here for a happy to take a look. So overall,
10.96s: to me, it looks like volatility is cratering. That's what I'm seeing. I'm, it's essentially
14.92s: across the chain at this point. And we're seeing broad approximation to the longer term
19.32s: expectations. This front expiration cycle used to look really, really hot. And now it
25.44s: does not. Let me show you what I'm talking about. So the 16th of June, this was over
29.84s: the weekend on Sunday, right before the shareholders meeting. And Vol was expanding pretty
34.40s: meaningfully up to 280%. That's a lot. One over a weekend, two for a shareholders meeting.
40.20s: A shareholders meeting typically isn't that big of an event. You'll see that for really
44.52s: big news releases, biotech phase trial stuff like that. So the fact that it was getting
48.12s: that high was very interesting to me. We had the shareholders meeting, which a lot of
53.16s: you informed me that the perception was it was a nothing burger, not much was talked
57.20s: about. And as I looked through the transcript, I could see what you mean. There was very little
61.92s: said, it was all kind of broad brush stroke muscle movements, not a lot of specifics. So
67.80s: I now better understood that perspective. And that led to volatility contracting massively.
73.88s: But I actually thought this was going to contract more. The fact that I dropped 76 points
78.56s: is big. But for something that elevated that much for that event and that little seemingly
85.48s: came out of that event, I really thought this was going to fall more than it did, but
89.20s: it didn't. It still created it a lot, but not that much comparative to what I was expecting.
95.20s: Then fast forward to today, after the close, we have now fall down at 160. This is the
99.92s: jump I would have expected after that shareholders meeting going from 280 to 160. That was kind
105.76s: of maybe not all the down 160, but pretty close to that. So the fact that we have now gone
111.36s: from two of four down to 160, it just tells me that the market is not expecting anywhere
116.36s: near the same volume of movement that we were expecting before. And that also permeates
121.20s: to some of these surrounding expiration cycles that used to also be above 200. Now there
126.04s: are 150 140 much, much, much lower. So if we take a look at the options chain, I want
133.88s: to highlight a few things for you all. The very first one is when I look at the closer
140.48s: strikes to at the money. So like 100 strikes, I'm seeing right now, open interest is still
148.24s: approximating towards the put side. And if we include all of the strikes, it still is,
156.88s: but not as much. So it tells me lots of people are playing with really far out of the money
161.48s: options. If we're talking looking at strikes that are 100 points away from the at the
167.48s: money. So there's still very heavy call skew here, surprisingly so to me, to be honest
174.00s: with you. Now the other thing that I want to highlight is if we centralize this to the
178.20s: near term explorations, you'll notice that of that 1.2 million that we saw across all
182.92s: chains, all strikes, about 818,000 of that call, oh, I is within this week and next week.
191.16s: Massive. Same thing for the put skew. This is still essentially two to one called a put,
195.96s: which is not normal. Normally it would maybe not be inverse. You don't necessarily see
200.04s: that big of a disparity, but you typically would see more puts than calls. The markets
205.96s: tend to hedge the downside. So this is still topical to me. The fact that I see this much skew
213.88s: over this short of a time period, because as soon as we start going further out, let's
218.64s: say that we go out instead to like this 19 July 16 August and October, take a look at
224.12s: the call OI and the put a lie like it's much closer to parity. And as you go further
228.44s: and further out that parity then eventually inverts like I would expect it to in normal
233.24s: markets. So again, that tells me that the market is kind of pricing in the action from within
238.92s: October, essentially, that's what I see here so far. The other thing that we got to take a look
244.12s: at is the transaction volume for today calls and puts and it's very similar to what we saw
248.04s: yesterday. Much more call volume, but again, quick recap, we got to get rid of between the market,
255.16s: we can't tell if those are buying to open or selling to open, but we can make some inferences
260.60s: based on if it transacts at the bid or the offer. And in this case, the fact that 39% of the calls
266.68s: transacted today were at the bid or below, that tells me that those are again, mostly sales,
274.52s: more likely than not. So that's again, short calls, whether they're part of a covered call,
279.96s: which the disposition for the holder of that would still want it to go up. I suspect a lot of
284.52s: those are probably covered calls, but this is still people looking to capitalize on some of the
290.44s: volatility that we're seeing and they are trading at least the options to the downside. That's why
295.96s: we would be selling calls at the bid or below. Now for the puts, it's kind of an even split between
302.84s: potentially selling and buying today. So not much to take away from there necessarily. Again,
309.48s: more volatility focused if they're selling puts in my opinion, because if you think GameStop
314.28s: or something like that is going to fly to the upside, you wouldn't sell a put. You would rather just
318.84s: either buy the stock by calls, something that would give you that uncapped upside potential.
323.96s: Because if you sell a put, you don't get that. So in this case of people selling puts, I don't
327.80s: necessarily perceive that as massively bullish. To me, it seems more like we're just trying to squeeze
332.20s: this cratering volatility out, which is actually a pretty smart play now from a technical perspective.
337.32s: You have to be really, really careful doing stuff like that in products like GameStop because it
341.16s: can go crazy at any point and you don't want to get stuck off sides with naked options trying to
345.96s: trade a little bit of all, but I can see why it's happening. The other things we got to take a look
351.72s: at super quick are the volume. And if we see the volume transactions across the chains across
358.44s: the strikes, again, reflects what we see here, but I want to hone us in on these near term.
366.52s: And that actually surprises me. 319,000 call volume compared to 149,000 put volume. Now, a lot of
377.32s: this can be potentially closing transactions. Actually, yesterday, when I was taking a look at this
382.52s: at this near term expiration, I was really surprised to see this. The 30s actually bid up. I think
389.56s: there's right like 66,000 or something like that. Yesterday, if I'm not misremembering. So there
393.96s: definitely was a lot of sale volume that came in, but there is even more buy volume that came in,
398.28s: which I find interesting people are doing the cheap out of the money options thing. And if I take
403.32s: a look at the volume again today, now 42,000 contracts, these expire in three days and the market's
409.40s: not trading tomorrow. So this is kind of crazy to me. This is, and I don't see the catalyst right now
415.48s: that these people could be attempting to swing for the fences on, but that's not a trivial amount
419.72s: of volume. And again, the volatility is now starting to abate quite a lot. So I don't see that the
425.48s: market even sees whatever catalyst these people might be attempting to play. Now, again, the other
431.08s: thing to keep in mind is a lot of this can be sale volume, which so far looks to be the case. And
437.24s: that could just be people trying to capture these exceedingly exceedingly high premiums,
442.20s: especially if they're covered with shares. Last thing we'll take a look at is the implied volatility.
447.24s: Let's take a look at the smile. We'll look at the out of the monies for this. And I'm going to clear
451.48s: out a bunch of the different series to kind of decrease the noise. And what do you notice, even
456.76s: compared to yesterday, really, let me dump this one for now. Even compared to yesterday, I see a
463.32s: couple of massive changes. So if spot price right now is about right there, kind of where the
468.60s: vertical axis is of my cursor, the first thing I notice is that we are seeing way more
475.40s: pale side, vol put side, which again, makes a ton of sense for a quick recap on how to read this.
482.04s: This is only looking at out of the money options. So all of the puts that are below the current price
488.20s: are out of the money and all the calls above are out of the money. So when we're looking to this
493.48s: side of that cursor, these are all out of the money. And if you'll notice, even compared to yesterday,
497.88s: we started seeing a normal smile. Now it's actually puts you where we're seeing way more
503.32s: of all on the put side, which again, that starts pricing and downside expectation. The call side is
509.96s: flattened out quite a lot. And that's a really steep smile at this point. Whereas if we look out
515.56s: to the 28 June's slightly different story, they are a little bit more normal. I see kind of the
522.84s: way that this tailor is up and out, you have to be careful with the way that you read this. And
527.64s: the reason why you have to be careful is because since the stock is trading at 24 bucks,
531.72s: it caps out to the downside. So this might look like it's just really seemingly long tail.
537.16s: Part of that is because it's crazy that people are transacting all the way out here. But it's also
541.16s: because this just has a natural floor of zero. So there's just not much below. You can go here. So
548.36s: it might kind of skew your perception of what you're looking at a little bit. So I want to call
552.36s: that out. So what's the takeaway from here? Expiration for 21 June is pricing in put volatility premiums,
562.36s: more normal skew, more normal smile approximation. 28 June is still more flat than I would expect to see.
571.72s: And there absolutely is still some call skew. So for example, if I take back to current price and I
578.92s: go to the top of the the put volume, I'm sorry, volatility on the downside. I want you to look
586.84s: over to the right and see how much of the blue line peaks up above. It's actually kind of behind my
590.68s: head. Let me light out of the way. Take a look at the line to the right hand side. So notice how
598.12s: if we go to the right, there's still call premium all the way, all the way super high. So essentially,
606.92s: this is what we would be calling severity. The market's pricing in slightly. If there is a
612.12s: catastrophic massive upside move, they're demanding a premium for these really far out of the money
617.16s: options because that's still not fully off the table. Otherwise, you would not see this here. And
621.72s: again, I'm not here to spread hype or fide. I am here to do my absolute best to look at the data
627.80s: and just share what I'm seeing so that you can make whatever inferences from it you choose. But
632.76s: that's why that's there like that. If we look at other products, you don't see that kind of
637.48s: upside skew like this. Now again, look at the put side. There's nothing even close. The market is
642.76s: not scared quite literally at all about a massive up move this week in terms of what it's pricing
648.20s: into the malls. As always, if you have any questions, just let me know. I'm happy to take a look at
652.36s: this stuff. Anytime I enjoy looking at options, I do it literally all day every day. So I'm here for
658.92s: it. And also, thank you guys for helping me understand some of the memes. Rurinkiti is dropping.
663.40s: It's kind of fun learning more about the lower. I'll see you guys on the next one.
