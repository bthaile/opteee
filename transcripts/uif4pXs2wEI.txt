780.68s:  interesting
782.44s:  for you to know, especially if you're looking for
783.96s:  VM orbital
784.92s:  and different time
787.16s:  frames, if you don't understand this in detail, you're
789.16s:  protecting
792.76s:  in-front
794.28s:  ok
795.92s:  objects just because you happened tol string
798.76s:  11
800.04s:  in-one
802.04s:  March
802.92s:  Langley
804.04s:  and why?
805.04s:  No other guesses?
806.04s:  I'll give you the answer.
808.40s:  It's because that's where everybody goes.
811.96s:  That's why it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
815.24s:  If we had the scenario where everybody chose to use this 10 DTE weekly option, these would
822.72s:  be super liquid.
823.72s:  They'd be the most liquid options on here.
826.08s:  But they're not.
827.56s:  And it's literally just because everybody just goes to these.
833.44s:  Literally why it is the way it is.
835.84s:  The reason why you should know that's why the way it is is because if you find instances
842.12s:  where most of the liquidity is in another cycle for some reason, there's typically a reason.
849.64s:  And there were going to be a lot of these little instances that I highlight with that
852.32s:  exact framing.
853.32s:  There's typically a reason.
854.84s:  And it's because this is the market giving you subtle context clues based on what's normal
860.84s:  and then based on what the deviations off of normal are.
864.60s:  That is a big part of analyzing options chains.
868.20s:  It's not there's not going to be big blinking flashing lights telling you this is different.
871.60s:  This is changed.
872.76s:  This is anomalous.
873.76s:  You have to build a familiarity with these.
877.00s:  So to put that idea to the test, let's go down here really quick and let's take a look
882.00s:  at the open interest.
883.60s:  The open interest for SPX right now across all cycles is 6.7 million and 12.5 million
891.40s:  calls to puts respectively.
893.60s:  Let's take a look at these different expiration cycles.
896.24s:  Let's go to the 14 March.
898.64s:  The 14 March has 60,000 calls 248,000 puts.
904.20s:  The 17 March has 10,000 calls 31,000 puts.
909.56s:  The 21 March has 1.7 million calls against 2.6 million puts.
917.52s:  What do you notice?
919.44s:  You notice that the standard expiration has insanely higher open interest than all of these
927.96s:  individual little weekly options.
930.52s:  This will almost always be the case.
933.00s:  So you should be aware of that propensity.
936.04s:  Okay.
937.68s:  Now, let's go back to what we were looking at.
939.72s:  I literally already forgot the ticker.
941.52s:  Was it HWB?
943.12s:  No.
944.12s:  HWN?
945.12s:  No.
946.12s:  Well, y'all help me out.
948.48s:  What was I just looking at?
951.12s:  What's in here?
952.12s:  Is it H-H-Something?
955.52s:  H-W-M.
956.52s:  Thank you.
957.52s:  Thank you, Elizabeth, HWN.
962.60s:  So if we go into HWN and we take a look at this same idea, all of the options in this
971.84s:  are pretty light.
972.84s:  There's 36,000 calls against 17,000 puts.
976.72s:  And just to reiterate this point, what should I find if I get rid of all these different
983.12s:  series, series, terms, explorations, all the same thing, by the way, all synonymous?
988.96s:  I get rid of all these different terms and I'm going to flow between them just to help
992.16s:  reinforce that point.
994.80s:  And I click this series versus this series, the 14 March versus 21 March.
1000.80s:  What am I going to see?
1002.40s:  What are you going to see?
1003.40s:  What do you know overwhelmingly, probabilistically, you're going to see?
1007.40s:  Now it could not be the case, but there would be a reason why it would not be the case.
1012.64s:  And that would be something for us to look into.
1014.76s:  What is overwhelmingly likely going to be the case?
1019.16s:  If I click into 14 March and then 21 March, what am I going to see in terms of an open
1024.24s:  interest disparity between those?
1026.52s:  Which of those is going to have higher open interest?
1028.72s:  14 March or 21 March?
1033.32s:  What's the guess?
1035.88s:  Love me a good guess.
1037.20s:  Bingo.
1038.20s:  Big A's is on it.
1039.20s:  Big A's with the big brain.
1041.48s:  We go into 14 March, 4,000 again, 625.
1045.04s:  Go into 21 March, 4,000 against 1,000.
1048.32s:  Not that big of a difference.
1050.32s:  Something interesting there.
1051.88s:  But still, this is essentially two times the size on the put side.
1055.60s:  So the total OI in here is 5700.
1059.20s:  The total OI in here is 4800.
1062.80s:  So still more, but not a ton more.
1066.16s:  One of the things you'll notice is with lower overall float options, meaning 36,000 total
1076.08s:  OI, again, 17,000 total OI on the put side.
1081.60s:  When it's this low, the discrepancy between different expiration cycles is less pronounced.
1089.60s:  And it's because there's less of them in total.
1093.16s:  If you look at it as a total percentage difference, it's still quite high.
1097.48s:  The difference between 5700, 7400.
1100.28s:  It's still fairly high.
1102.80s:  But it looks flatter because there's simply not as many options in there.
1110.24s:  What's another thing we can conclude by just looking at this open interest?
1116.28s:  If I were to take an educated guess about the liquidity of these options, what might
1123.52s:  I conclude by this?
1125.60s:  Do we think that it would be more liquid or less liquid than something that has higher open
1133.60s:  interest?
1134.60s:  So if I'm comparing HWM to something else that has higher open interest, would I expect
1142.24s:  the liquidity in here to be higher or lower?
1146.92s:  Ben says not good.
1148.12s:  You pay more.
1149.52s:  Good first part.
1150.92s:  The second part, a little shaky.
1153.20s:  It's not inherent that you pay more, but you do pay a wider bit ask spread overwhelming
1158.60s:  probability.
1160.40s:  Travel also has it less liquid.
1162.20s:  Let's take a look at what this might look like.
1164.00s:  Let's go to the 21 March and let's take a look at the liquidity here.
1166.80s:  These are $1.60 wide for at the money put.
1171.36s:  This is actually super illiquid.
1174.52s:  And then these are $1.40 wide for at the money call.
1178.16s:  So these are also very illiquid.
1181.16s:  Important point, we're going to circle back to it in a little bit.
1185.80s:  But again, what I'm trying to get you to think about is when you look at an options chain,
1192.76s:  all of these little data points should be popping into your brain.
1196.48s:  It shouldn't be just looking at numbers.
1199.56s:  You should be looking at numbers coming up with conclusions as you're looking at the
1205.40s:  numbers.
1206.92s:  Another thing that jumps out to me on the screen is the difference between calls traded
1212.28s:  today against puts traded today.
1218.48s:  What's going on here?
1220.00s:  What can I infer?
1221.00s:  I can infer that there is a shit ton of calls being traded compared to HWM.
1228.60s:  The majority of these might be traded at the bid, the ask or in between the market.
1238.20s:  So big A says bullish, not inherently.
1241.04s:  We don't know inherently.
1242.36s:  Why don't we know inherently?
1244.48s:  I just gave you a little bit of a preamble.
1246.84s:  And as everything to do with these, the bid, the ask or between the market.
1253.80s:  If we were to take a guess as to whether or not it's actually bullish or not, and then
1258.96s:  I'm going to grab my little drawing pad here.
1261.60s:  So big A's, why is your response there not accurate by itself?
1267.36s:  It happens to be the case here, by the way.
1269.76s:  But simply comparing calls to puts, that doesn't answer it for us.
1276.52s:  What do we think?
1279.40s:  Did they buy or sell would make a difference?
1282.20s:  It's exactly correct.
1283.24s:  Elizabeth is on it like white on rice.
1285.96s:  So if we take a look at the difference between these two calls and puts, we can see that
1293.40s:  there's 4,700 of these against 561 of these.
1297.12s:  At a first look, we would think, yeah, that's super bullish.
1300.08s:  That's way more calls traded.
1301.88s:  But we're mistakenly making an assumption.
1304.52s:  The assumption we're making is that we bought those calls, we being the broad market participants.
1310.08s:  We don't know that yet.
1312.00s:  So what we need to do is actually take a look if they transacted at the bid or at the offer.
1321.80s:  So if you'll recall, all options have a bid and an ask.
1328.80s:  The bid is somebody saying, this is the most I'll pay.
1337.28s:  And then the ask is the cheapest I'll sell.
1347.48s:  So let's pretend for a moment that there's no bid ask spread.
1352.60s:  Let's pretend that you can only transact at one of these two points, the bid or the ask.
1361.32s:  And let's say that I wanted to buy a call.
1363.96s:  Let's say I, Eric, and bullish.
1366.60s:  I want to buy to open a call.
1370.52s:  Who do I have to go to?
1372.16s:  Who do I go to in order to buy this one call?
1376.44s:  Do I go to the bid, the person that's offering the bid, or the person that's offering the ask
1382.64s:  or offering the offer to make it confusing for you?
1386.56s:  Where do I go?
1387.56s:  Which one of these sides do I go to in order to buy this call?
1393.64s:  What's the guess?
1396.60s:  Big Ace is close to it with his question from the other part.
1408.04s:  You go to the ask, exactly correct.
1410.92s:  So if I'm buying this call under the assumption that I'm bullish, I have to go to this person.
1418.52s:  If I want to sell to open one call, which would be bearish, I have to go to this person.
1430.00s:  Can't sell it to them.
1431.08s:  They're trying to sell.
1432.92s:  I have to sell to them.
1435.12s:  So this is how you can use the at the bid or at the offer to make an inference, super important
1443.84s:  point.
1444.84s:  In inference, we do not know.
1450.48s:  We do not know if these 113 calls at the bid, we do not know if all of them were bought.
1462.84s:  I guess I should say sold here, sorry.
1464.72s:  We do not know if they were sold.
1469.32s:  Some of them might have been bought.
1473.16s:  Low probability, but they might have been.
1476.92s:  This can happen during what's called a sweep or subsequent orders.
1481.68s:  I'm putting in a big order.
1483.72s:  That's just a market order at a certain price.
1486.44s:  I can get filled at better levels than the bidder to the offer.
1491.68s:  So there will be instances that, for example, you might be able to buy at the bid.
1497.08s:  It's not common.
1498.88s:  The majority of instances that won't be the case, but it absolutely can happen.
1502.24s:  It does happen.
1503.24s:  It's not like super rare, but the majority of instances that won't be the case.
1506.36s:  You have to be aware of that because a lot of people that I see talking about the bids
1512.16s:  and the offers and deconstructing the bias behind those trades falsely assume that this
1519.92s:  is a bullish rebarrows trade based on the transaction that happened there.
1525.12s:  But we are making an educated guess.
1529.24s:  We do not know if they were actually bought or sold.
1532.88s:  We're making an educated guess based on market mechanics.
1535.84s:  You important nuance to be aware of with respect to this.
1541.68s:  A big A says, what about when you placed at the mid?
1545.64s:  What's it classified then?
1546.76s:  Great question.
1547.92s:  What do you notice this category is?
1554.76s:  Between the market and notice where the majority of the volume went today.
1564.08s:  The majority of the volume today went between the market.
1567.24s:  So when something's between the market, we don't know.
1570.48s:  Now, again, we can make educated guesses.
1572.92s:  You can't make an educated guess in here because they don't have the capability.
1578.36s:  But if I show you a tool like this who fold disclosure, I am an affiliate for.
1584.36s:  They're not sponsor in this or anything.
1587.28s:  But again, I'm just always going to keep it a buck with you guys.
1593.16s:  If I take a look at, let's do flow feed.
1597.40s:  And let's take a look at HWM.
1604.48s:  Or not, we can also not, it's the computer is doing this fun thing that it started
1609.00s:  doing where it just completely locks up during this.
1612.36s:  Okay, so if I take a look at HWM, and again, you can also do this in Thinkorswim, by the
1618.08s:  way, I should clarify that.
1619.08s:  It's just more difficult.
1620.96s:  If I want to know for the between the market, if I wanted to try and make a guess, an
1627.28s:  educated guess as to if the option was bought or sold, the way that I can do this is very
1633.96s:  simple.
1637.44s:  If this 88% of instances, I'm kind of like, how can I classify if these were bought or sold?
1645.84s:  Well, if we're trading something that's illiquid like this, it actually becomes easier.
1653.24s:  Because rather than something like the S&P 500, where the bid and ask might be this distance
1658.56s:  apart, HWM being less liquid, the bid aspect is this distance apart.
1665.04s:  We already looked at two scenarios where for the calls, they were $1.40 wide, and then
1669.72s:  I think what was it?
1670.72s:  $1.80 wide for the puts.
1673.96s:  So what can we do?
1676.16s:  Simple.
1677.16s:  We can see where they transacted over here, or where they transacted over here, or over
1683.56s:  here, or over here.
1685.36s:  Look at where it's closer to.
1688.72s:  So the cool part about bar chart, or I'm sorry, bar chart, unusual whales, you can kind
1693.28s:  of see all that in one spot.
1694.52s:  You can also see it in Thinkorswim though.
1696.52s:  What you can do is you can go to TNS, time and sales.
1699.68s:  And I can take a look at what the market was offered at during the time that the trade
1705.40s:  ran through.
1706.96s:  And we can find instances where the trade like this right here, there's a great example.
1713.16s:  The seven March, $141 calls here.
1717.08s:  They traded at $1.00.
1720.04s:  The market at the time was $0.95 by $1.10.
1725.16s:  What is this closer to?
1727.16s:  That's closer to $0.95.
1731.68s:  More likely than not occurred towards the bid.
1735.08s:  So you can make an educated guess that those were probably sold.
1738.32s:  Don't know.
1739.84s:  Educated guess.
1741.40s:  So anyways, you can do the same thing with a tool like this that kind of lets you see
1746.20s:  it in one spot more broadly.
1748.72s:  And you can even look at it, one of the things I do like about it is that if you look
1752.84s:  at the overall flow for the day, you can see we're most of it transacted at.
1758.96s:  So if we look at it over the course of the day, we can get a sense of where the net premium
1764.44s:  came in and then at closer to bids or offers where it came in.
1770.56s:  OK, so this is literally just an overview of what I want to talk to you about.
1777.00s:  This is really what I want to talk to you about.
1780.20s:  When we're looking at an options chain, there are two broad buckets of data that I think
1787.16s:  makes sense to look at.
1788.76s:  There is a 0% chance we'll be able to go through all of this in detail today.
1792.88s:  But I want you to be aware of some of these.
1797.64s:  Now the purpose of this data is we can come up with ideas on what's happening again,
1806.88s:  meaning information from the market.
1809.12s:  So I'm going to move this out of the way and we're just going to keep strolling through
1812.88s:  the options chain like this together.
1814.36s:  And then I'm going to highlight more of these four you as we go along.
1818.08s:  So one of the things that we can look at is based on volume and open interest.
1824.56s:  We just started doing that analysis by the way.
1827.00s:  We started looking at the total volume of calls traded today versus puts and kind of
1831.44s:  coming up with some assumptions.
1833.48s:  This assumption is, is it mostly bullish flow?
1836.00s:  Is it mostly bearish flow?
1838.00s:  That typically means that there are people taking educated guesses based on information
1843.08s:  that they may or not have.
1845.08s:  Another interesting question with respect to this is I wonder what explorations this volume
1850.08s:  happened in and is this same breakdown prevalent in the individual exploration.
1857.64s:  So we can take a look at the volume total volume and we can eyeball what explorations
1863.60s:  got the bulk of this volume.
1865.08s:  Well, I can tell you from the call side, the bulk of that volume came in at the 14 March
1870.84s:  143's 1921 of these total contracts traded there.
1877.60s:  Interesting.
1878.60s:  So what could I do now?
1880.40s:  I could then say I'm curious specifically about these 143's.
1887.12s:  Do I think these 143's were bought or sold?
1890.64s:  Simple.
1891.64s:  We can come in here and we can filter this.
1894.32s:  We can say I only want to look at the call side in that specific series.
1901.32s:  So we're going to go to 14 March and then we're going to look at what was it, the 141's.
1907.00s:  I only care in this scenario, about the 141's.
1912.00s:  So let's limit everything we're looking at to just the 141's.
1923.04s:  And then let's also get rid of where is it.
1930.84s:  Oh, interesting.
1934.08s:  It doesn't have the quantity filter on.
1935.72s:  Okay.
1936.72s:  So this isn't showing me the right data, which is kind of annoying.
1940.08s:  But we can find it over here as well.
1943.28s:  So we can go into the volume for today and we can take a look at these different calls,
1948.36s:  right?
1949.36s:  So we know the 141's were busy today.
1951.36s:  And we can figure out where the majority of those were traded at throughout the day.
1957.28s:  Now normally, I think, or swim would also support being able to do this yourself.
1961.40s:  I don't know why it's yielding not correct information.
1965.12s:  One of the issues when you're trading or when you're using data like this, not paid
1969.88s:  data is typically going to have some constraints.
1972.72s:  It's just kind of a function of what it is.
1975.32s:  I know a lot of people traders are used to getting a ton for free, but the reality is the
1981.08s:  only reason why you get as much as you do for free is because the brokers want you to
1984.04s:  trade.
1985.20s:  They're not necessarily incentivized for like quality of information.
1989.00s:  They just want to give you stuff so that you do trade.
1991.60s:  That's how they make their money.
1996.08s:  So that's the facade.
1998.36s:  That's one style of analysis that we can run based on what we think this difference between
2006.08s:  calls and puts are.
2008.32s:  Another very common analysis, there's actually a scam that I run for this is we can take
2015.96s:  a look at tickers.
2021.12s:  Let's build one together really quick.
2024.04s:  We don't want non-common.
2025.60s:  We don't want OTC.
2027.60s:  And let's take a look at options really fast.
2032.04s:  What I'm going to do is first filter by open interest.
2038.00s:  We want open interest to be greater than zero, probably 500 at least so that we're not
2043.04s:  trading like super, super small stuff.
2045.64s:  And then what I want to do is actually look at changes in volume to OI and it's frozen
2056.12s:  again.
2058.36s:  We want to look at volume compared to OI.
2061.44s:  So what this scan is going to show me is where in what tickers did we have explosions of
2073.64s:  volume over open interest on the day.
2078.04s:  The reason why volume over open interest is such a useful metric is because it shows us
2085.60s:  where positions are being aggressively built out.
2091.44s:  And I don't see any in here that are jumping out at me.
2096.52s:  And I don't see any here.
2099.36s:  So we'll run the scan and see what comes up.
2102.72s:  It's probably going to be a ton, not that many actually.
2107.60s:  So let's sort this by volume over OI.
2119.24s:  If I can get this to work for me, there we go.
2122.72s:  So we can see O or ORGO.
2125.96s:  I was literally just going to say this too.
2128.68s:  More often than not, when you see big spikes in volume over OI, it's from the medical world.
2133.96s:  Why is it from the medical world?
2135.52s:  And funny is shit.
2137.20s:  The top two are from the medical world.
2139.92s:  Why is that?
2140.92s:  Anybody know?
2142.24s:  That's so funny, honestly.
2144.52s:  Kind of get a kick out of that.
2150.88s:  And while you guys are seeing if you can come up with why that might be the case, let's
2156.80s:  add a couple more things while we're in here.
2159.84s:  We'll add five day percent change.
2165.36s:  We will add one month.
2170.60s:  We will add six months.
2172.60s:  We will add one year.
2175.16s:  The reason why the percent changes matter to me is because typically speaking, there will
2180.88s:  be a reason.
2183.92s:  Why we see massive changes in volume over OI.
2192.80s:  So I didn't input anything into those.
2194.84s:  I just want to see what the results are.
2197.64s:  James says clinical trials.
2199.72s:  That's a little specific.
2201.64s:  But the reason why more often than not that I will see volume over OI very high in the
2210.08s:  medical industry is because very frequently the motherfuckers that trade options in these
2218.20s:  are insiders.
2219.40s:  And it's because they have much more lacks rules with respect to insider trading in the
2228.08s:  medical industry.
2229.64s:  If you couple that with the fact that a lot of medical companies specifically biotech
2236.84s:  and stuff like that.
2238.52s:  Their entire business is typically wrapped around an individual trial of a drug or solution
2247.36s:  that they're trying to get out onto the open market.
2251.08s:  So you have the ability for something to move massively based on the information that
2257.72s:  we're discussing.
2259.08s:  So that's why as you look through this, if we just take an eyeball count of how many
2264.08s:  in these are in the medical field, it looks like the majority to me, right?
2268.16s:  Medical, medical, medical, medical, medical, medical, medical, medical, medical, so on and so
2275.08s:  forth.
2276.08s:  A ton of these are in medical.
2277.56s:  And this is very, very common for this kind of thing.
2280.68s:  So let's just take a look at ORGO.
2283.48s:  Something's happening there.
2284.48s:  Wonder what it is.
2286.28s:  ORGO.
2287.28s:  You don't say.
2298.64s:  So this had earnings where it was expected to come in at negative three cents and it came
2305.24s:  in at four cents, a massive earnings beat.
2310.12s:  Here is a.
2312.12s:  So one of the things we can do now is we can say, well, that's for today.
2317.08s:  I wonder if there are some bastards that knew about this ahead of time and they were
2321.12s:  positioning ahead of time.
2323.12s:  You very often will actually see that.
2325.36s:  So what we can do.
2327.76s:  If this will allow me is we can take a look at a few things.
2333.32s:  We can look at volume percent change.
2341.48s:  And then we can also look at.
2345.40s:  Put call volume ratio.
2348.64s:  Don't really care so much about the one month change.
2354.32s:  I don't want this to become too noisy for you guys.
2357.88s:  Then we can also look at total interest percent change.
2361.08s:  We'll do this over the five day.
2363.84s:  And then this one should have one one.
2366.56s:  Okay.
2367.56s:  So we will have.
2369.88s:  Call versus puts.
2375.92s:  For current and then a five day average.
2380.00s:  And then we have five day percent open interest percent changes.
2385.80s:  We have five day volume percent changes.
2390.12s:  And then we have one month.
2392.88s:  Open interest percent changes.
2395.40s:  So what we can do now is we can observe what kind of changes have occurred over the past
2405.68s:  five day periods for both volume and OI just to get a sense of did somebody have a clue
2412.08s:  that this was going on.
2418.32s:  And what do we notice?
2420.80s:  It looks like yes.
2424.20s:  Because if we take a look at the five day volume change and the five day OI change even
2429.64s:  compared to the one month OI change.
2434.16s:  Huge huge discrepancy, which is kind of lyrus to be honest.
2439.52s:  And this is again super, super common.
2442.76s:  There's really I wish it wasn't as common as it was because this is a lot of people that
2451.04s:  are trading information that they have access to that technically it's not completely removed
2456.06s:  from your access either by the way that's an important note.
2459.16s:  That's why it's allowed in a lot of these places.
2464.12s:  You'll see this kind of thing in medical devices, especially because of periods where they
2470.56s:  will have conferences and whatnot, which is again kind of annoying, but it is what it
2476.88s:  is.
2477.88s:  So what we can do for something like this again, if this thing will work as it should,
2484.52s:  we can get in alert.
2486.32s:  We can essentially say we want to sort this by the total volume over OI.
2497.04s:  We want to do it descending and we want it both at market open and market close because
2502.56s:  then this will give us an idea throughout the day as people are putting positions on mid
2508.24s:  day is also fine depending on like what period you might try to trade the idea.
2514.16s:  But this is literally exactly how you can use something like volume over OI to get a little
2520.44s:  bit of a heads up that something's happening before the thing actually happens.
2525.88s:  Now there are other versions of this that we can run.
2528.28s:  We can get rid of total volume over OI.
2531.60s:  We can get rid of that as our primary filter.
2534.56s:  And we can say that we just want to look for stuff that's starting to have really big
2539.80s:  changes in volume, just overall volume.
2545.12s:  So what we can do is like these become less important and we can analyze the growth of
2551.84s:  five day versus one month average volumes.
2556.56s:  Specifically, often for bigger names, you really require institutional sponsorship.
2564.72s:  Institutional sponsorship doesn't happen overnight.
2567.44s:  So the medical device world a lot of times institutions will stay out of there.
2572.64s:  And it's just because it's a complete crapshoot and you're typically betting against people
2576.08s:  that have information that you don't.
2578.64s:  More often than not, if I'm going to trade in the medical space like that, I'm purposely
2582.40s:  going to try to ride the flow that exists.
2585.36s:  So now let's go back.
2586.36s:  I don't want to get too far into the weeds on this specific example and I want to talk
2590.52s:  to you about a couple other things.
2592.76s:  A big one is analyzing open interest shelves.
2599.12s:  So let's take a look at a GameStop is a good example.
2606.00s:  So if we look at GameStop and the reason why GameStop is a good example is because this
2610.36s:  is something that absolutely has previously experienced gamma squeezes.
2615.84s:  And if we take a look at this 21 March expiration and we just kind of like think about the landscape
2624.04s:  for a gamma squeeze.
2626.04s:  This is exactly why I got involved trading GameStop earlier this year and I've talked about
2632.52s:  this.
2633.52s:  How I traded this exact move like earlier last year, I got my years fucked up during
2640.80s:  this move here.
2642.76s:  And the reason why I became involved in this move, just like I was involved during the
2648.68s:  first squeeze, it's not because and I'm very open about this.
2651.84s:  I trade everything.
2652.84s:  I know that there are like apes that they are so deep into GameStop and I don't have
2657.88s:  that depth of knowledge yet.
2659.88s:  But what I do know is from a general trading perspective, when I see massive changes in
2665.56s:  open interest and volume like I did here, it draws my attention.
2669.88s:  Then when I see that movement sustained and if we look in the options chain, we can start
2678.08s:  to glean some information.
2681.32s:  That kind of information comes by way of understanding the hedging behavior of the
2688.24s:  counter party to your trade typically market makers.
2691.20s:  Now a bunch of notes, the first thing, the majority of people wrongfully believe, well,
2700.60s:  actually let's put it to the test.
2706.72s:  If I buy to open one call, we assume that a market maker has sold to open one call.
2721.20s:  So this means we are long deltas.
2727.00s:  This means these guys are short deltas.
2733.20s:  And let's say that we're talking about a 30 delta option.
2741.52s:  We assume that this market maker hedges.
2746.92s:  How does this market maker hedge?
2750.48s:  What are your thoughts?
2755.48s:  Pepe says shares.
2761.52s:  Any other guesses?
2778.48s:  I don't know what Ben means.
2782.76s:  Pepe says baldness which I assume means not hedging.
2793.20s:  So is that the primary consensus right now that they would hedge with shares, right?
2797.20s:  Is that what I'm picking up?
2806.40s:  Looks like yes.
2811.56s:  Use the reality.
2817.36s:  They don't have to hedge with shares.
2824.84s:  There's no imperative for them to hedge with shares.
2829.56s:  What if this one call gets added because they don't just market make for this one strike?
2838.16s:  They market make for all of this.
2841.76s:  So what if this one strike, this one call gets added to this broader basket of options that
2851.00s:  they've sold at different periods?
2855.66s:  What if this one call actually offsets some of the other risk that they've taken on
2861.40s:  throughout the day?
2864.16s:  They'll only can be the case.
2870.60s:  They don't have to hedge with shares.
2872.08s:  It's a massive common misconception.
2875.32s:  Now there is an important period when they would hedge with shares.
2886.08s:  I was trying to delete this.
2893.16s:  If I have these options that are in the money, big A says in the money that is also only
2910.40s:  partially correct.
2912.28s:  It's still not full credit correct.
2914.04s:  Why is that not full credit correct?
2917.04s:  Why do I say partially correct?
2933.64s:  Not full credit correct.
2935.00s:  You do not get full credit.
2943.12s:  Re says most in the money are still sold to close out, not exercise.
2947.72s:  That's part of it.
2953.12s:  Think carefully.
2956.36s:  We covered this before.
2960.04s:  When is an option likely to be exercised?
2973.20s:  In the money near expiration, be more specific.
2981.40s:  That's not wrong, but be more specific.
2984.28s:  I want you to identify the actual function.
2991.80s:  Bingo.
2992.80s:  Recent travel around it.
2994.72s:  When there's not a lot of extrinsic value left, that's when it becomes logical to exercise
2999.68s:  the option.
3002.20s:  It's not just a function of buying or selling a call.
3007.36s:  That inherently doesn't mean hedging with the underlying.
3010.76s:  It also doesn't mean hedge with the underlying if I have in the money options that are 21
3016.08s:  days out.
3017.84s:  Because these options still have a ton of extrinsic value.
3022.16s:  You can get a proxy by looking over here.
3024.92s:  They're still very unlikely to be exercised.
3027.76s:  If they are, it's profitable for me.
3029.88s:  Just go on the open market and buy them.
3032.24s:  Completely fine.
3034.72s:  So if we go back to this idea of analyzing open interest shelves, again, this context is
3044.72s:  super important.
3047.48s:  Because if we want to talk about something like a gamma squeeze, which is a very near-term
3051.32s:  behavior, the places where a gamma squeeze become increasingly likely is if, say, for
3058.40s:  example, next week, let's say next week, GameStop starts to see a massive build out in
3070.32s:  all of these OIs.
3074.16s:  What ends up happening is as one of these fall in the money, the market makers now have
3081.72s:  to make a business decision, especially depending on the probability of being assigned, which
3085.48s:  they have very good models that help them assess that.
3088.72s:  And they say, do I need to buy shares?
3090.20s:  OK, I need to go buy shares now.
3091.92s:  So buy to open shares.
3093.64s:  As they buy shares to hedge their short call, that pushes price up.
3100.00s:  So then we move into the next run.
3102.80s:  And they say, OK, now I have to buy shares here to hedge the calls.
3107.88s:  And then I also have to buy more shares here to finish Delta hedging these calls.
3112.64s:  Because they don't want to buy 100 shares for one call of the Delta's 53.
3118.56s:  Because now they're net long.
3120.04s:  They're not trying to be net long necessarily.
3121.96s:  They're trying to be flat.
3124.20s:  They're trying to capture the bit ask spread.
3126.00s:  Now, if they think it's uninformed market flow, they might pile on top of it.
3129.64s:  A lot of them will try to do that.
3131.72s:  But from a hedging lens, they don't want to overhead.
3134.56s:  They want to hedge the position precisely.
3136.92s:  So anyways, as this series happens, more buying, more hedging, pushing more options in the
3145.96s:  money that causes more buying, that causes more hedging, that causes more stock goes up.
3153.84s:  This action is what causes a gamma squeeze.
3158.16s:  So that's why understanding the volume shelves or the open interest shelves is super important.
3164.96s:  Because for example, if price got pushed up into here and they had all the sudden 7300
3171.28s:  options have to be hedged because they fall in the money.
3175.20s:  Okay, cool.
3176.52s:  But then the next couple shelves, they're pretty light.
3180.56s:  There's not a whole lot going on here.
3182.68s:  So then the buying pressure will wane if this is the case.
3189.12s:  So this is how you can use open interest to help you understand something like a gamma
3194.80s:  squeeze.
3195.80s:  You can also use open interest to help us identify specific strikes that are of interest
3204.40s:  for different reasons.
3206.56s:  So one of the things that I coded for thinkorswim is the change day over day of open interest.
3216.32s:  And then I also have another tool that helps me calculate the volume ratio.
3224.48s:  Right?
3225.48s:  So in this case for the 25s and a halfs, I can see that day over day 95 were added.
3232.12s:  But then I can also see that 7.4 times of this strike were traded today compared to the
3237.92s:  open interest, 3500 compared to 481 going back to what we learned earlier.
3244.12s:  If we know that every single option has to has to have a counterparty and quick recap,
3253.44s:  volume is the number of options traded today.
3256.72s:  Open interest is the number of options that are active, meaning day over day.
3261.84s:  So if we see volume like this 4500 compared to sorry, this one 3500 compared to 481, we
3272.00s:  already know there's going to be new OI, new open interest because there's more volume
3278.56s:  than the existing open interest.
3279.96s:  So it can't be closing.
3281.68s:  There would be nothing there.
3284.56s:  So there's going to be a massive amount of open interest being added to the strike.
3291.76s:  So we can use that as an understanding of where options are being built out.
3298.60s:  Then we can take a look at which strikes have the most volume, which expiration cycles
3303.92s:  have the most volume, so on and so forth.
3307.40s:  So you can glean an insane amount of information from options.
3312.64s:  Now the last thing, I mean, there's way more than that from a volume at OI lens, but
3316.80s:  the last thing I want to talk about quickly over the next five minutes or so and then leave
3321.56s:  some time for Q and A is volatility.
3324.68s:  volatility is super important.
3326.12s:  So we can visualize term structure, the volatility across expiration cycles and you see me do
3331.88s:  this all the time.
3333.28s:  It helps me understand what the perception is for different periods of time.
3337.88s:  If we see volume spike up like this here, 77% vol up to 96, up to 94, up to 96, and then
3346.36s:  it starts to come back down to 94, 91, 82, 69 means that the market is pricing in movement
3351.92s:  around this time frame.
3353.64s:  Very frequently that's due to a corporate event that we kind of know is going to happen
3357.16s:  during that time frame.
3358.16s:  And in this case, that corporate event is going to be earnings of some sort.
3361.96s:  So you can use the term structure to make inferences about movements and also movements
3368.40s:  severity.
3370.12s:  The cool part about volatility is that it literally tells us based on the best market
3375.08s:  consensus that exists right now today, what is the expected range for something over
3379.40s:  a time frame?
3380.68s:  So for GameStop, the expected range for GameStop over the next 21 days is plus or minus $3.71.
3386.72s:  That's a one standard deviation 68% probability of falling within that range.
3392.12s:  You can calculate this for different standard deviations.
3394.52s:  I'll literally do it right now and one of my calculators for you just to give you an idea
3397.92s:  of what the number would be.
3399.76s:  So we're here.
3404.60s:  So stock price is $2,504.
3408.00s:  The events, expereval, so in this case, we're looking at the 21 March, which is 96.35.
3417.32s:  The ticker volatility is 86.95.
3426.40s:  And the days expiration on that cycle are 21.
3430.48s:  So for a two standard deviation move over that time frame, you're essentially looking
3440.68s:  at plus or minus, in this case, it's $3.71.
3446.76s:  You're looking at plus or minus $4 in change.
3453.28s:  So you can calculate the actual expected range.
3457.44s:  Now using this is using not the term vault.
3461.04s:  This is using the underlying vault, the 86%.
3464.68s:  We can also calculate this using the actual term vault or that specific time frame.
3470.36s:  But using the volatility of 86.95%, the one day range is $1.37, 274, 4.11 for one, two,
3483.76s:  and three standard deviations.
3485.80s:  Under the monthly range, if we're going to look at that over the course of a month,
3489.92s:  it's $6.29, $1.257, $18.86 for a one, two, three standard deviation move, so on and
3495.80s:  so forth.
3496.80s:  So the point that I'm trying to help you with here is that we can use volatility to calculate
3500.88s:  moves.
3501.88s:  That's one of the greatest things about it.
3504.52s:  The other thing we can do is look at a volatility surface.
3509.60s:  And the volatility surface is really, really useful.
3513.12s:  So if I just use the standard expiration volatility surfaces, I can come up with all
3518.96s:  sorts of inferences based on expected move and relative values based on the way that
3524.88s:  these look.
3525.88s:  If they're jagged like this, I can tell you that there's a lot of mispricings or discrepancies
3529.68s:  between implied volatility pricing or wide bidda spreads.
3534.56s:  I can also tell you that if we see the call tail as high as this even higher than the
3539.52s:  put tail, that tells us that the market is pricing in a higher probability move to the
3545.32s:  downside, but higher severity move to the upside.
3549.40s:  So you can extract a insane amount of information by just looking at options chains in this
3555.76s:  way.
3557.08s:  And as promised, that puts us right at $55.
3561.00s:  And I want to make sure that we have a little bit of time for Q&A.
3565.04s:  The main thing I want you all to be aware of is twofold.
3567.96s:  The first one is how to generally navigate an options chain.
3571.96s:  And then the second is just to give you at least a taste of some of the different ways
3576.40s:  we can use an options chain to glean information about the underlying.
3581.84s:  So that wraps me up for the kind of formal part of the series or this episode I should
3590.16s:  say.
3591.16s:  I would love to hit any questions, concepts, things that you're interested in understanding
3598.48s:  better.
3600.16s:  And in the meantime, I'm actually going to update one of my calculators because I want to
3606.36s:  also be able to calculate these ranges using a specific event.
3611.32s:  So feel free to throw in any questions that you have now and then happy to take a look.
3618.20s:  Hopefully, you learn something new.
3621.00s:  At least that's the main goal.
3626.80s:  Von Hale says I've read they compare a buyer and seller so they don't have to hedge.
3631.40s:  I mean, that's the entire goal for a market maker.
3634.88s:  The market maker carries inventory for as little time as possible.
3641.68s:  And the reason is because they are trying to capture the bid-ass spread.
3649.40s:  So the way that they can capture the bid-ass spread is by exactly that, by trying to identify
3653.52s:  buyers and sellers and to pair them.
3655.40s:  Now realistically, more often than not, they can't do it real time.
3658.64s:  They have to take on inventory for at least a little bit.
3661.80s:  But they absolutely do try to minimize the time frame that they're taking on inventory
3665.72s:  because that increases their total risk.
3667.44s:  They don't want to take on inventory.
3670.52s:  He says I swear I was listening, but how can you discern if they were bought or sold
3674.44s:  if the majority were between the bid and ask?
3678.28s:  Okay, so then Reese, if you were listening, and I believe you were, what do you recall
3683.40s:  me saying about the process of discerning that?
3691.20s:  I gave you an specific example, actually, if you recall.
3696.20s:  And it had to do with the split between bid and ask.
3701.48s:  That base says what platform can I use if I live in Mexico?
3704.12s:  I honestly have no fucking idea.
3706.12s:  I don't live in Mexico.
3707.12s:  I do know IB, interactive brokers, is used most places globally.
3714.36s:  So I do think that they have a pretty global footprint, but I generally don't know beyond
3719.44s:  that.
3720.44s:  I would have to do the same Google search that you would do to get to the answer.
3724.12s:  If you do the Google search really quick and you list out some of the brokers, I'm happy
3727.48s:  to let you know if I think they're good or not, I can do that.
3730.92s:  But Reese says checking actual transactions, sort of, but there's an important differentiation
3740.12s:  that we can make and I gotta go grab the dog real quick.
3754.12s:  All right.
3761.00s:  That's straight, hater activity.
3763.40s:  Look at this.
3764.40s:  It literally cuts his head off because he's too dark.
3767.84s:  Okay.
3768.92s:  So now the dude is ready to answer your questions.
3772.20s:  Let me get this out of his way.
3775.60s:  And the question was, how can we figure out if an option falls between the bid and spread?
3784.40s:  How can we tell if it was a bottle sold?
3788.64s:  What do you think?
3792.04s:  So he's licking my hand, which is clearly him trying to explain to you about analyzing
3799.00s:  the width between the bid and spread and then where the transaction occurs.
3807.08s:  That is the start to the answer.
3813.92s:  Travel says one is Thor gonna start picking stocks.
3816.96s:  He's not gonna do stocks.
3818.16s:  He's gonna do sector ETFs.
3820.48s:  But I'm hopeful to do it soon.
3822.44s:  I think it'll be super, super fun.
3827.08s:  And essentially run it like week over week.
3830.88s:  Or maybe month over month or something like that could be fun.
3837.16s:  Lauren says Thor looks like he's wearing white eyeliner.
3840.52s:  Yo, the disrespect, the disrespect to Thor.
3845.88s:  He's actually going back in to get another haircut tomorrow.
3847.92s:  So he's gonna be looking fly as a motherfucker.
3852.12s:  So Reese, let's take a look at an example here.
3856.96s:  We're in GameStop.
3858.80s:  26% of the calls traded today in 47% of the puts traded today were between the market.
3867.24s:  How can we tell, let's look at the puts.
3869.12s:  How can we tell if these puts were bought or sold?
3873.68s:  One of the main ways is by analyzing where the transaction occurred
3881.12s:  against the bid asked spread.
3884.88s:  So if we go into TNS and if we choose to just look at puts,
3892.60s:  let's just eyeball some of them.
3894.80s:  So like this one, this one we can see.
3898.28s:  And right now the way it codifies them, right, is red is sold green is bought.
3902.88s:  That's if it's at the bidder ask.
3905.12s:  So these gray ones are the ones that occur between the bid asked spread.
3910.80s:  So if we take a look, this is another great example.
3913.12s:  This one here, if we take a look at the 155 traded at $1,
3919.80s:  when the market is bid at 95 cents offered at 115,
3925.40s:  it's much closer to the bid.
3930.76s:  So it's much more likely to have been sold versus bought much closer to the bid.
3940.12s:  So this is exactly how you can go through and kind of complete that process of trying to
3944.36s:  analyze if it occurred closer one or the other.
3948.48s:  Now the one thing I want to be super clear on, like this isn't necessarily the pinnacle
3954.20s:  use of your time.
3955.76s:  This is okay if you're getting into nuanced analysis and trying to come up with smaller trends
3961.24s:  and stuff like that.
3962.04s:  It's okay to do this.
3962.84s:  I do this all the time.
3964.60s:  But for the vast majority of new traders, this is not the right place to spend your time.
3969.72s:  The right place to spend your time is by analyzing profit mechanisms
3974.04s:  and finding things that make money genuinely.
3976.92s:  This is kind of interesting side information that you can use to slightly temper the way
3983.48s:  you might be building a trader thinking about a trade.
3986.12s:  But this is not there's not like super secret squirrel information in here that's going to be
3991.24s:  the difference between you making money or not.
3992.92s:  You got to get the profit mechanisms down for that without a doubt.
3996.04s:  This is good amplifying it for me.
3998.28s:  So yeah, that's how you do it.
4002.04s:  Any other questions Ben says, can you see US European option classification and
4008.04s:  an option is chain.
4008.60s:  No, I don't think so.
4010.44s:  You just kind of know it.
4012.12s:  So it's the indices.
4014.04s:  The indices are going to be European style options.
4016.44s:  Most other things are going to be American style options.
4019.56s:  But I don't think you can see it in the options chain.
4022.28s:  I've not actually looked for it in there.
4025.32s:  Thanks so.
4029.08s:  Let me ask.
4030.68s:  Let me just check your PT.
4031.72s:  I literally don't know.
4032.84s:  Does think or swim.
4036.52s:  Oh, you.
4037.80s:  You're.
4038.68s:  And.
4040.20s:  American options.
4044.44s:  Oh, no shit.
4047.48s:  So you can filter by it.
4052.44s:  Yeah, you can filter by it, but I don't see somewhere where it like explicitly tells you that.
4059.48s:  It's interesting.
4061.40s:  But yeah, not something.
4065.08s:  The majority of instances you'll find that they're going to be American style unless they're indices.
4076.20s:  Cool.
4077.00s:  All right, gang.
4077.64s:  Looks like that wraps us up as always.
4080.28s:  If you need anything, let me know.
4082.28s:  Be an outlier.
4083.32s:  Let's go later.
