636.00s: you
636.50s: able to go back and review and say, well, does this work? Does this make sense? And that's
644.22s: the entire, entire goal here is to create a process so that we can figure out what decision
651.18s: elements actually help us versus what decision elements don't really lead to something productive
658.98s: so that we can spend more time on the elements that are productive. That's the entire goal
664.82s: here. And that's why you see this structure. I'm not going to go through this whole thing.
667.86s: Again, this is in that other video that I shared. You can go through that in detail. But I want
672.66s: to highlight these three main stages when it comes to the idea of managing a portfolio.
681.14s: I always start with a high level overview of just what I think is going on in the world. And you
689.06s: can see this literally starts from the economy. And then it rotates all the way through all of these
695.70s: down to individual events that might pertain to an individual ticker. The idea here is we do not
704.50s: have to become economists. And thankfully so because that's a the interesting job in some ways,
711.62s: but a terrible job in other ways. I've not met many economists who like are really big into trading.
717.86s: And I think there's a lot of reasons why that's the case. But understanding what the current
723.70s: economic state is super important. And I'll give you an example. If I told you, let's say if I was
729.94s: your friend coming to you and it was just like, yo, I have a great idea. Right now, I really want to buy
741.22s: anything that's generally related to domestic automotive manufacturing. I think that that's a great
752.02s: space right now. That's what I want to buy. This will probably be like a six month thesis.
758.66s: What do you think? If that was my friend and they came to me with that, I wouldn't tell them no.
767.30s: I wouldn't say that won't work. But what I would say is something like,
774.10s: are you aware of the current tariff landscape? And then the potential impacts that that might have
783.86s: on your investment idea. Right? So unlike Reese who is going to be a dickhead to his friends,
793.06s: I like to be nice to my friends, you know, to Reese's point joking aside, I definitely would
801.62s: encourage them to conduct their own research. But I think it's useful at least to in that context,
809.22s: give them an idea of what they might look at. Right? Because if you don't know what to look at,
812.50s: it's really overwhelming. So that stuff aside, if we take a look at the economy right now,
821.22s: in the broader macroeconomic picture, we know that tariffs are definitely topical right now.
828.10s: Super topical. It matters a lot because when we have things like tariffs, they cause a lot of
833.94s: short-term impacts. Guess what that is? Is this me knowing all of the details of tariffs and
841.06s: the impacts of reciprocity and what tariffs do for productivity and all that stuff? No, not in the
849.38s: least what you'll find is as a trader, you become a generalist. You know a little bit about a ton
855.94s: of shit. So in this case, I essentially know that tariffs, fortunately, I know a little more than
861.46s: that about tariffs because I spent a while studying them. But let's say if I was just a standard trader,
866.42s: I knew tariffs were going on. I don't have to know all the details to know that there's an
870.66s: impact to stuff. So then as I'm looking at different trade ideas, that's going to still impact the
876.90s: way I look at them. It's the same thing with basics, like looking at GDP. Are we in a generally
885.14s: growing or contracting economy? I don't have to know all the ins and outs of GDP. I don't have to
891.46s: know that GDP is kind of a bullshit figure that includes a lot of federal spending on internal
897.14s: projects that really doesn't ultimately add value. I don't have to know that. I just have to know
903.70s: if this general metric is growing, that tells me one thing versus if it's flattening versus if it's
910.66s: going down, then that still informs my position. So that's what happens in this disposition stage.
918.98s: I am literally creating context and a disposition towards all of these individual things. And you
927.06s: guys see me do from the market indices sectors, subsectors themes. You see me do this multiple times
933.94s: per week on the various live streams because I literally am this is my process. This isn't like a
940.50s: process that I put together is something that's conceivable and could work like this is what I do.
944.66s: So that's why you see this happen very regularly because it's exactly how I interact with the
949.62s: markets. So the entire purpose of the disposition stage is to give you context around different things
956.02s: because when we click down one level to the portfolio, now we're looking at based on my current
964.66s: analysis of the landscape, what am I holding and does it align with my current analysis of the
972.34s: landscape. So again, going back to the tariff example using a simple example, if I looked at my
977.70s: portfolio right now and it was just all long US based car manufacturers, I'll tell you of them,
985.86s: I guess Tesla as well. Let's just get rid of Tesla from the equation. We'll focus more so on
989.94s: like Ford and GM. I would be nervous. I would say, well, I don't know if this is really the right
996.42s: place for that money. There's going to be a lot that's likely coming down the pike relative to
1001.86s: these. So the disposition stage informs how we build a portfolio that reflects our ideas.
1012.98s: The other thing a portfolio at the portfolio level that we need to establish is what is this
1019.78s: portfolio supposed to do. The funny thing about what I just said there is probably one of the most
1031.38s: no shit Sherlock things I could say. What is the portfolio supposed to do? Yeah, got it.
1039.22s: But if I actually go through and I have conversations with each and every one of you,
1045.06s: I literally will guarantee that I will find inconsistencies in what you're doing and what you
1053.38s: think you're doing and what you're trying to do. Because I do this a lot with a lot of people
1059.38s: and I've never met somebody so far that has had a completely coherent portfolio approach across
1067.14s: the board. This is because there is a massive injection of desire. What we want. I want to make
1079.30s: x percent per month. Okay. What's that number? I would like to make 5 percent per month. Okay.
1091.22s: Do you want to make 5 percent per month every single month? Or do you want to make 5 percent per month
1099.94s: on average over 36 month time span? I want to make it every month. Okay. This starts to get really
1110.18s: challenging. That's not to say that that couldn't be done. That's a very aggressive return, by the
1114.58s: way, like a very aggressive return. So then it starts to beg a lot of different questions. Is it feasible
1121.62s: to have a 5 percent portfolio return per month on average over a long-term time frame? Sure.
1127.86s: Absolutely. It is reasonable to do that. But what it's going to take to get there is probably a very
1133.54s: high risk of ruin and insanely high portfolio volatility. And that same person that typically says
1140.82s: I want 5 percent per month, well, they want to be able to do it every single month. Well, that
1146.58s: immediately tells us we actually want less volatility in the portfolio. So we're starting to build
1153.14s: some inconsistencies right from the jump in terms of what we're trying to do. So the very first
1160.42s: stage of portfolio management, the very first thing we need to do is clearly define what the
1169.06s: portfolio is supposed to do. And then back check it. Does this shit make sense? So I think it's a
1178.98s: perfect spot for us to start. Let's have a conversation around deciding what the portfolio
1190.58s: is supposed to do. Get rid of all this stuff.
1195.78s: So in the chat for anybody, any of the brave souls out there, I would love to have a quick
1202.42s: back and forth dialogue and use a hopefully your scenario as an example.
1208.42s: So if anybody has an idea of like, what's the goal for your portfolio? How would you answer that
1217.30s: question? And then I'm going to extract out pieces from that answer to build the scenario.
1224.26s: And realistically, it should be a very simple answer and you'll see why. It's not simple for
1231.54s: people because we don't actually know what to look at, but we'll figure it out.
1238.42s: So we pretty much just need to figure out this first step of managing a portfolio
1247.46s: is define our goals. The reason why this comes first is because this is literally going to
1260.18s: inform every other step of the way. How much money we need to use, what things we're going to put
1265.38s: the money in, what kind of strategies we're going to use, what kind of timeframes are we going to
1269.14s: use? All of those subsequent details that come out when we're building a trading plan and
1274.74s: strategy outlines, we're going to be informed from this very section here. So the way to think about
1281.86s: answering this question, when we're trying to decide portfolio goals, here's some basic places to
1288.26s: start and it's going to be specific to you. But the first one is going to be a percent return.
1295.30s: The next is some sort of volatility measure.
1304.82s: The next is some sort of you can either bake it into the volatility measure or not, it's up to you,
1313.38s: but consistency. Between these three broad buckets, you can pretty much define most portfolio
1327.94s: goals with a response to any of these. As long as you have something done, so like for example,
1334.26s: let's go back to that original example. If that person says I want to make 5% per month,
1342.90s: we don't immediately start from the scenario of that's not possible, that's a terrible mindset.
1348.18s: I always start from the context of, okay, let's just take that at face value and let's see what else
1357.06s: might have to go into place in order for this to be possible. So then if I ask this person again,
1362.74s: what kind of portfolio volatility are you willing to endure? This can be things like max drawdown,
1370.42s: this can be standard deviation. There's a lot of different ways that you can calculate portfolio
1375.94s: volatility. A really simple one I think is max drawdown at the portfolio level. So if we do max drawdown
1384.58s: at the portfolio level, this gives us some sort of volatility measure. And then the other thing I
1391.78s: already told you is the consistency. Is this something that we're trying to do every month?
1397.70s: Or is this something that we're trying to do on average over a period of time?
1403.94s: And the responses to these give us a lot of initial context. Then there's more qualifying
1411.06s: components to this. There's things like involvement.
1414.34s: Because there are a lot of traders that have seen different YouTube shorts and Twitter clips or
1426.02s: Twitter twitch not even twitch. What am I thinking of? What's that other TikTok? That's what we're
1430.82s: going for. TikTok. We've seen enough TikTok where we think that the idea of a bunch of money
1439.54s: in a very little amount of time with very low effort is reasonable. So then a lot of people will
1447.06s: also say, well, I don't want to spend a lot of time. Which starts to make all of this increasingly
1459.62s: challenging. So when we're talking about our portfolio goals, we need to talk about them in the
1465.78s: context of these general buckets. And we need to understand the trade-offs between them.
1472.42s: If I want to have a higher percent return, I am inherently going to have to be way more involved.
1477.06s: It's going to be way more difficult for me. I'm going to have to probably expect less consistency,
1483.14s: higher volatility in my returns. That's the equation you're looking at here.
1490.50s: So as per usual, with the world of trading, it genuinely is a choose your own adventure.
1496.98s: But going back to my original point where a lot of traders get stuck up because of the things
1502.42s: that they want to do, you can want different stuff. That's okay. But then you do have to actually do
1510.50s: the analysis of, is this reasonable? Can I do this? And this is what leads to that.
1519.78s: Philip says, I want consistency over two years, 25% growth within 24 months. And I think
1531.70s: for somebody like Philip, depending on what consistency means, so these are different broad-based
1542.02s: terms that we have to define for ourselves. What is consistency? Is consistency hitting that
1549.70s: return and then on average getting that 25% growth within 24 months? Or is it not having your
1558.42s: portfolio value moved by x% bands? Is it each strategy that you put on maintains within a specific
1569.54s: expected return range? So there's a million different things that would go into defining consistency.
1580.50s: To define it is super important because when we're setting out our portfolio objectives
1586.02s: and defining these goals, this is literally what you're evaluating yourself against.
1591.06s: This is then how you figure out if what you're doing is correct or incorrect. Because remember,
1597.46s: if you think about a standard business, they have a very clear picture. The goal of a business
1603.62s: is to increase sales ultimately increase revenue. That's what most of them are pushing for.
1611.62s: But there's no business owner here besides you. You have to set all of these things for yourself.
1619.38s: Because otherwise, you wind up like another random trader out there in the ether.
1625.70s: That's just kind of going through it. And we're seeing how it goes, which is a really,
1632.98s: really inconsistent way to go about this kind of thing. So now that we have a concept of our goals,
1644.26s: we know that we're probably going to want to define some sort of percent return. We know that
1648.58s: we're going to want to define some sort of match drawdown. I refer to this as a portfolio circuit
1653.54s: breaker. I'm going to have to acknowledge my tolerance when it comes to consistency. And I mean,
1662.18s: I already am obviously about as involved as you can get. But for everybody else, you have to
1667.62s: figure out how much time can you consistently run with something like this? So why not says for
1676.58s: five K a month average probably needs 200 to 300 K capital. I think you are probably grossly
1686.58s: under valuing how much you probably need. So let's do a little bit of math. I got to pop the door
1696.42s: for Thor.
1707.22s: So let's just let's do a little bit of quick math. So effectively,
1726.26s: we're saying let's call it a $300,000 count.
1728.90s: And we're talking about getting five thousand bucks, 3.3% return.
1742.98s: On a monthly basis, 3.3% return is a 47.6% return.
1749.86s: So then for why not, that becomes the next question is how reasonable would you find it to be
1761.78s: to maintain essentially a 49% return consistently?
1769.46s: And then therein lies the answer to your question. This is one of the most overlooked
1775.22s: elements of planning. How we're using a portfolio. And funny enough, this is literally probably one of
1784.10s: the most important elements of planning a portfolio. Because coming up with an idea of what you're
1791.70s: trying to do automatically informs how much of your portfolio you're going to be doing and using
1797.94s: to attempt to capture whatever it is that you're trying to capture. So another thing to keep a
1804.42s: mind for why not, right? Like that scenario of $5,000 a month, $5,000 a month on a $300,000
1811.06s: portfolio literally means that you have to maintain a 47.6% return every year.
1820.34s: Pretty challenging. I would argue it's literally better than my return. And that's including
1824.50s: the last two years for me, which have been anomalies. I don't say that is in it, you can't beat me.
1830.50s: It's entirely possible to beat me. I do not pursue top line performance. So I don't say it in that
1838.26s: vein of saying like, well, if I can't do it, you can't do it. That's not it at all. I actually
1841.62s: think it's quite reasonable to beat my return. The thing that I bring it up, those for context,
1846.74s: because most people who say stuff like that literally just lack context and in understanding of
1853.14s: what goes into that kind of return. But that's a near 50% return, which is industry leading in then some.
1859.38s: That also opens up another really important differentiation when we're talking about
1868.58s: trading and really aggressive returns. Because if we take a look at, again, that return that we're
1874.90s: talking about, which is called 48%. Is it possible to get a 48% return? Definitely. I've had
1882.26s: multiple years that are greater than 48% absolutely possible. That I can say with confidence.
1887.94s: The difference though is that it ain't consistent. So when we're trying to get really aggressive
1896.42s: returns like this, our consistency is going to plummet. So comparatively, if we're using why not
1907.54s: scenario of trying to take in 5K per month, and we're trying to think of the context of consistency,
1914.50s: well, let's think about it. What percent return do we think is likely going to be more consistent
1923.70s: for us? I can literally tell you it's not even a market return. If you're trying to return in line
1930.18s: with the S&P 500, let's just call it 10% per year, that in and of itself is going to be quite
1935.86s: inconsistent. You can see the volatility that the market has. So unless you become a wildly adept
1943.62s: trader, which is possible, you still are going to have some pretty serious volatility,
1948.10s: even if you're chasing a market return. So when I'm thinking about a higher value on consistency,
1954.90s: that necessitates a nearly insultingly low target. But the reason for the nearly insultingly low
1964.18s: target is because you'll notice that that low target is actually pretty hard to do consistently.
1970.58s: Because when the market starts rolling over, it requires a lot of adjustments and the ability
1976.18s: to trade a completely different market really effectively. And then the duration of the downturn,
1981.22s: right, whether it's just a short term correction that then turns into a broad market rally the
1985.14s: rest of the year. We've seen a couple of those recently. Or if it's the other scenario where we
1990.02s: delve into a broad-based bear market that lasts the average 298 days, we don't know. But you have
1997.14s: to be able to play all of those different variations of the scenario. So the main point of all of that
2003.94s: is that the more you value consistency, the lower you need to enable yourself to aim in order to
2012.74s: hit the consistency metric. If you're okay with a little more volatility in your returns, then sure,
2019.30s: it definitely becomes possible. Like if I was thinking of why not scenario with at least a bit more
2026.82s: money, then it becomes definitely very reasonable. But the other thing people don't account for is
2036.18s: unfortunately, tax man. Because if you make 5,000 or 5,000, if you make 5,000 dollars and let's say
2046.18s: that you're not old enough, hopefully you're not old enough to be able to withdraw from a Roth IRA,
2052.26s: then you're also going to have to account for friction. The tax is that you're going to face so
2056.90s: that you can actually pull 5K. So I know it's not a really fun or sexy answer, but there's one
2067.38s: thing I want to circle us back to, hopefully, is that if in the beginning you embrace a higher return,
2078.50s: higher volatility, lower consistent style approach that allows you to achieve a much higher return,
2087.22s: if you maintain that much higher return, you go parabolic as compounding really turns on.
2095.86s: The cool part about going parabolic is going parabolic. And that means that for each subsequent year,
2104.66s: you're maintaining that system and that approach, it means that you are massively changing the
2111.78s: gross number of dollars you have at your disposable income. So if you successfully do that,
2120.34s: then you don't have to play the game of, well, I only have 300K and I want to make 5K per month.
2128.26s: That literally becomes a non-factor and you're talking about this more so from this scenario of,
2134.34s: I have 3000K, which is 3 million and I'm trying to make 5K a month.
2139.78s: Then all of a sudden it becomes easy. It literally becomes simple. So a lot of traders,
2147.46s: newer traders, they focus, I think, a little bit too much on what the early exit looks like for
2154.58s: them and what's the lowest amount of money they can use it used to get there. And it really
2160.10s: jeopardizes the broader path that I think is much more of a high likely outcome.
2167.22s: Because if we take a look at that same scenario at a curiosity and let's say we have 3 million
2173.70s: dollars to hit that, that brings us down to 0.3, 0.333. That's a 4.1% return. Now obviously that's
2186.10s: really low. But the main point that I'm making though is that you really give yourself a much
2197.46s: better potential outcome in this scenario. And that's, I mean, honestly, that's the goal.
2206.02s: The higher the outcome potential in terms of probability, you can give yourself,
2213.62s: you're going to be just so much better off in that sense. So yeah, I feel some type of ways,
2225.70s: sometimes when we do these, because I really don't like to make people feel like, oh, this is
2232.82s: impossible or there's no path for me here. That's definitely not it. But it is the case that
2242.02s: you typically need more money than you think. But by giving yourself more money, it gives you
2249.30s: such a higher probability of this thing working out in your favor. And that's kind of the main message
2256.82s: there. Ben says, I don't understand how this stuff doesn't just reflect your strategy. You're
2264.82s: talking about the portfolio level, right? Like all these portfolio level details, how this doesn't
2270.42s: reflect your strategy? Is that, let me grab this by the way, you know, move this over here.
2279.70s: Okay, it's a great question. So for anybody else in the chat, how would you answer Ben here?
2287.78s: Ben is essentially saying, well, doesn't your portfolio or doesn't your strategy
2293.46s: represent all of this stuff that we're talking about relative to the portfolio? So what would we say to
2301.78s: him?
2303.30s: You
2317.78s: resets portfolio is the highest level than strategies later. So you're kind of highlighting some of it.
2323.38s: Ben, the way that I would answer you here is how do you decide what the strategy is?
2334.50s: How do you pick that? How do you build the strategy? Additionally,
2344.50s: how many strategies do you think that you're going to trade?
2354.18s: Right. The point that I'm making is that in order for a portfolio from a trader's lens to do what
2359.70s: we need it to do over the course of a year and many years hopefully after that is we need the
2367.06s: ability to trade different kinds of market conditions, which requires different strategies.
2371.94s: So if it becomes a chicken in the egg problem, because if we have no goals that we're attempting
2380.18s: to create the whole point of this section here of defining goals for the portfolio is to then
2386.82s: inform what kind of strategies we even need. Because let's say, for example, that you're comfortable
2394.98s: with really high portfolio volatility. You're comfortable with having negative years,
2400.10s: but you want to maximize your total return potential. Well, you probably don't have to spend a lot
2404.66s: of time then trying to figure out how to trade volatility. Doesn't really apply that much in
2411.06s: that kind of scenario. You're going to be way better off and more likely to hit those goals.
2415.78s: If you're spending your time to find the next 10,000 bagers that exist and there are traits that
2422.82s: are common among them, but in your pursuit of getting 10,000 bagers, you might go two years
2428.58s: being unprofitable or slightly unchanged. And then you might have that third year that
2433.38s: recovers the two years prior and then puts you in the black in terms of returns.
2438.18s: But all of that is informed at the portfolio level. So if you choose to try to build it into the
2446.66s: strategy, the strategy has to reflect your portfolio level imperatives. We actually talked about
2452.42s: this not that long ago. For example, if I'm trading, I gave you the example with the max drawdown
2459.94s: using something like the coverage strangle, right? Because the scenario was if we scale into
2465.70s: the coverage strangle too much and we're planning for a 90% drawdown potential
2476.82s: in something like T-Triple Cues. And if we put in too much money that then automatically exceeds
2485.22s: our max drawdown tolerance, we've now created an inconsistency in the portfolio.
2491.62s: So the really the whole point of this is to have a clearly defined overarching plan
2497.46s: so that then we can figure out how to use the individual pieces, which the individual pieces
2502.50s: in this context are the strategies. It's a really good question. But that's why I start at the
2507.22s: portfolio level. Okay, so we've talked about all this. I don't want to spend time on this. This
2513.46s: doesn't matter. Let's talk about managing risk. That's a big part of a portfolio. So we talked
2520.02s: about the portfolio giving us context on what we're trying to earn as a return. And then we also included
2528.66s: two risk measures, volatility and max drawdown. So there are a bunch of different ways. You can go
2536.18s: about determining what risk you're comfortable with in your portfolio. That's not for the scope of
2540.98s: this video. But the important point here, it's just like every trade you put on should have a
2547.70s: defined P&L target. It's the same thing at the portfolio level because this informs a couple
2554.98s: things for me. One of my objectives as a trader personally is I really value consistency of
2563.14s: returns. I've mentioned that. And I am willing to forego top line performance to instead maintain
2572.18s: consistency in my returns. So what that means is I very rarely have a losing month very rarely.
2580.74s: But it means that I have to carefully measure my risk because markets can turn fast. So in my approach,
2589.70s: I look to use as little money as I can in order to hit my growth objectives for the portfolio.
2599.54s: A lot of retail traders make the massive mistake of comparing their performance against a benchmark,
2606.10s: like the S&P 500. And they say things like, well, unless I beat the S&P 500, then I
2612.42s: doesn't I shouldn't do this, which is a massive mistake because depending on what your goals are,
2619.54s: maybe it is the case. In a lot of cases, it's not the case. What I mean by that is the S&P 500,
2625.38s: again, we know it returns about 10% per year. But we also know that so far this year,
2631.14s: it's having a pretty bum year. If you were planning on drawing on your portfolio of S&P 500 for the
2637.22s: last three months for your monthly income, guess what's not happening that? So there are other
2643.86s: objectives that can inform what approach makes sense for us and how we choose to manage risk.
2651.14s: Again, if your way to manage risk is by accepting really high volatility and then just using
2656.58s: position sizing, yeah, that's okay. You can do that. You can do whatever makes sense for you.
2661.30s: But for me, I employ risk management on two different levels specifically, the portfolio level
2669.46s: and then the position level. The strategy defines the position. So that's why it's like that.
2675.38s: This is exactly how I decide the position risk has to fit within the portfolio risk.
2683.46s: Okay. So this one is talking about things at the trade level. This is like managing risk
2691.54s: within individual trades. So now we can get back and I want to pivot now to actually the process
2699.06s: of like building a portfolio so that we can see what this looks like in different ways to visualize
2705.22s: and manage it. The first thing though is I want to make sure that we have answers to these as we
2710.42s: go over. So one of them actually from Ben from the discord was saying the top level review before
2718.90s: assessing how to action your portfolio specified does or specifically does the economy review give you
2725.38s: any tree decision paths, which I actually think we talked a little bit about that autonomously
2729.22s: earlier. So I think that covers that a little bit. As in if the economy has specific things,
2734.58s: it means specific things for my portfolio management. Yeah. So we actually fortunately did cover a lot
2738.66s: of this earlier. Ben, if you have follow ups from what we discussed earlier, happy to hit those now.
2744.42s: But this is absolutely the case. It has it informs a lot of things from the level of
2750.74s: how much risk are we comfortable with having out and how is that risk allocated? What is it
2758.50s: actually concentrated in? So I think that would be a really, really great spot actually to
2768.90s: employ this exact thought process. But if you have any other specific follow ups from that happy
2775.22s: to take a look. Then next up, we have Tommy and Tommy says sector concentration correlation risk
2786.34s: assessment. So that one will get into in a minute using underlying betas and spy weighted
2793.70s: delta's. And then I'd like an approach to look in toss and I can manually track my spreadsheet.
2799.62s: Okay. So from the lens of sector concentration and correlation risk assessment, we'll get that I
2805.86s: actually think in the example. But if you have more of a follow up, let me know. And then we'll hit
2810.50s: that towards the end. And then actually the same thing with betas and beta weighted delta. So
2817.78s: I'm earmarking those for the example. And then Shreys talking about duration, which we're going to
2823.30s: cover in the example as well. Okay, great. So let's get into building an example.
2830.82s: So let's say that I am a trader and let's say that I have a smaller portfolio. So that to me would
2840.26s: essentially be, I mean, whatever number doesn't matter. Let's say that you're a trader that has
2846.02s: $25,000 portfolio, something that we might consider reasonable.
2856.98s: I'm actually going to try not to draw it as much and I want to see if I can help you visualize it
2861.86s: this way. So our portfolio is going to be $25,000. And then from here, let's take a look at
2876.50s: what our objective might be. So let's say that your goal, I'm going to use my goal for a long time
2883.06s: because it's what served me well, which is 15% per year. So over the course of a year,
2891.70s: I would expect to make $37.50, which again, this is the unfortunate reality that makes a lot of
2902.02s: traders uncomfortable because a lot of traders would look at that and be like, well,
2905.78s: shit, $37.50, like who cares? But what I will remind traders is that when you have a small account,
2915.14s: the way to get a bigger amount of money isn't to just try to get a 200% return to get something
2921.70s: you want. It's to build the skill set that allows you to successfully continue to save money and
2927.70s: grow your portfolio so that all of a sudden, when you find yourself with even a $500,000 portfolio,
2935.78s: you'll notice that like, okay, this is actually starting to become a decent amount of money
2941.94s: that if I'm able to maintain this kind of return, this becomes quite powerful because I'll show you
2952.02s: how this works. If we have this $25,000 portfolio, let's say we're not going to add any money just
2961.30s: to use the example here, 20% at a 5% return variance. Let's calculate this.
2969.78s: So notice the difference here. The difference between a 10% and a 15% return over a 20 year time frame
2981.94s: is the difference between $168,000 versus $409,000. This is the scenario where we are adding $0,
2990.58s: we're taking 25K over 20 years and we're just seeing what we can turn it into.
2995.70s: Now let's take a look at how this starts to go actually parabolic. Let's say we save $500 per month.
3003.22s: Then all of a sudden, you'll notice that your $25K at $500 a month at a 15% return yields you $1
3012.58s: million. What most traders do instead is they decide that this return isn't good enough for them.
3023.06s: So then they say, well, instead of this, they're misusing percentages and dollars.
3030.02s: In this scenario, we should be focusing on percentages. When you have a bigger portfolio,
3035.06s: you can switch to dollars because at this growth rate at 15%, you absolutely smash the market return.
3049.06s: If you give your approach time to work, you literally will become a millionaire. It will happen.
3056.18s: But most traders at this point, they say, I don't like this number. It's too low. So I'm going to
3062.82s: try to make this number higher. So then that means that they're targeting things like a 30% return.
3068.26s: And still, at a 30% return, you're getting $7,500. The total gross number of dollars in no way
3076.26s: compensates for the massive amount of risk you now have to take in order to try to get to that $7,500.
3083.86s: So anyways, that's the context here. So that's why this doesn't, this looks sad. It's like, damn,
3088.66s: well, that's not a lot of money. Well, it will be in a long time, not a long time, if you consistently
3095.14s: hit it. So that's why I care about this. So then now, let's figure out what this means. We pretty much
3101.54s: need to get on a monthly basis. We need to get $313. Cool. So now I have a bit of a target. I'm not going
3107.46s: into the other goals in terms of max drawdown and stuff like that because that'll be highly individual.
3112.98s: But I specifically want to talk about this idea of looking at the market and saying,
3117.06s: how do I get $313 for this month in the current market? So let's just eyeball what kind of portfolio
3125.62s: could go into doing something like that. And we can say, well, let's take a look at the,
3132.02s: we know the broader economic landscape. I've talked about that in a bunch of recent live streams.
3136.34s: So I'm not going to belabor that point. And let's say, okay, it looks like financials
3141.86s: is starting to bottom a little bit. And what else do we see? It looks like
3148.02s: comm services has been bottoming a little bit better. Utilities has been doing actually decent.
3153.70s: So maybe we start looking inside utilities for an initial idea because it's been better trending
3161.30s: than most of these. And let's start by first just taking a look at XLU.
3166.58s: And the implied volatility percentile is pretty high. It's 78%. So then we say, okay,
3175.86s: that's not too bad. I need to make $333. So let's now figure out if we want to do it in something
3184.74s: like the index, which in this case, I wouldn't because I'm actually going to be probably looking at
3188.82s: something like a vertical spread to start off. The reason why I'm looking at something like a
3193.62s: vertical spread is because we're looking at a really small account. And I'm trying to show a
3198.10s: specific approach that is centered on getting that dollar return for the month. If this was a
3205.94s: real portfolio with 25k, this is not how I would go about it. Just adding that. The reason why I'm
3210.82s: going this route is because I simply want to demonstrate something to you. So with that aside,
3217.06s: let's take a look and let's just look inside utilities.
3223.14s: And what I would do is just eyeball some of these to start. Any, they're kind of going sideways and
3229.14s: up as oh, same. So let's take a look at a couple of these so far.
3239.70s: What I'm going to do is I'm going to detach this. I'm going to move it off to the side so that I
3245.86s: can reference it. And then I'm just going to flip through them. Now the way that I personally would do
3250.50s: this is actually via scanning. I would use like bar chart or something like that, but it doesn't
3256.42s: really matter because we're just going to pick a handful of ideas pretty quickly. So there's S O,
3264.10s: there's E XC. We know E XC's been doing well. And they have a 32% implied volatility percentile.
3271.86s: So let's take a look at E XC. This we want linked. And let's take a look at a 34-day trade.
3284.02s: And let's take a look at a $1 wide spread. So this $1 wide spread gives us 32 bucks.
3292.74s: And let's take a look at what a $2 wide spread gives us 45 cents. So the $2 wide spread doesn't give us
3299.86s: is much for the risk as I would want. So in this case, I kind of prefer a $1 wide spread.
3305.14s: Might do a couple more of these. So to start us off, we're looking at a $25,000 account. We're
3315.30s: looking at a trade that is potentially going to make us a buck 60 and it's going to risk 340.
3320.42s: So now we have to fact check ourselves. We have to say is $340 reasonable? Is that a reasonable
3326.82s: amount of risk for the portfolio size? So we have to go back over here. And we have to say,
3332.98s: okay, for this portfolio, in this case, we're risking 340.
3340.98s: So what does that represent as total portfolio risk? 1.36%. How do I feel about that?
3350.66s: I feel okay. I think when I look at a portfolio of this side for individual speculative trades
3356.90s: like this, 1.36, pretty much something sub two, I think is reasonable. So let's say that we're
3363.78s: going to just cap our risk. We'll give ourselves, I typically like to have a little bit of a buffer.
3373.14s: So this will be our annual goal. This will be our monthly goal. I don't know why I did
3379.38s: MTH. That's weird. There's already a standard abbreviation for this.
3390.34s: So we have our goals. So now let's take a look at our risk.
3399.94s: Let's say that we're going to absolutely cap our risk at 3%. So this means per trade.
3409.78s: We can risk up to 750-ish. We want to be on the lower side of that as much as possible.
3420.50s: So we know in the context of this trade that we're looking at here, this absolutely falls
3426.26s: within the bounds of the total risk. So then we can look at putting a trade like this on. We'll
3432.74s: leave this in the total portfolio here. Let's just take a look at the idea. The idea here is we
3442.50s: essentially want this to expire. These 43 puts, we want these to expire out of the money.
3450.42s: And right now they have about a 65% chance of that happening. Okay, cool. And it's in a sector that's
3462.18s: been performing well. So there's our first trade. Let's find another trade. We're not yet at our
3468.74s: $313. So for this first trade, we have our risk, portfolio percent risk.
3484.74s: We have our return target. And in this case, what was it? 160? I think.
3498.98s: I don't fully remember, but I think that's right.
3501.22s: So now we already know that we need to find a couple more ideas.
3521.62s: So what I'm doing is I'm just creating a really simple tracker that we'll use to figure out
3527.38s: what our total risk is going to be at a given point in time. How much money we think we're going
3533.78s: to be able to make on the risk that's out. And this summary level data is ultimately what guides me.
3546.66s: So the delta that we have on this return target as it sits right now is 153 bucks.
3554.10s: So this is what we need to find out there in the market. So what other ideas do we have?
3560.42s: What ideas do you guys have? I gave you one. I would love your ideas now. And to just try to
3567.78s: integrate a couple of yours. Doesn't have to be anything crazy.
3575.78s: And I got to open the door for Thorigan.
3583.54s: Ben says zero DTE long strangle SPX wildish I guess. Well, let's see. We can we can eyeball it. I'm
3600.74s: open to ideas. So the first question is how high of a probability is the trade. Now we can't use
3610.26s: zero DTE right because the market's now closed. So we'll just call it 3DTE. So what's the trade
3616.82s: that you're thinking of Ben walk me through the actual position based on the options here. And then
3622.90s: we will we'll see. Let's let's test your idea. Because it might be wildish it might not but we
3636.74s: don't know until we actually take a look at it. Five point each direction based on current ATR.
3645.78s: Okay. So the current ATR for what period or or use natural ATR indicator.
3653.86s: As if so I can throw it on really fast.
3664.34s: So there's ATR.
3674.82s: The last day ATR. Okay. So then let's update this to be a one day.
3684.34s: And this is what we see this kind of Manila color is the ATR. So the last day here looks like it's up.
3701.54s: So with that what's the trade that we would put on.
3705.78s: You're talking along strangle so it means we have to buy what delta's would we buy for the call in the put.
3722.90s: Am I need more shelter water.
3727.86s: Normally I have a backup. Shame on me. Okay.
3733.22s: From the at the money in the morning so go five up five down. Okay. So I'm just going to wait at the money.
3742.34s: Okay. So let's just call it that the money here is the 47 delta and then five five strikes.
3757.46s: Like this.
3762.66s: So in this case we're going to pay 5200 dollars. So let's just size the trade. Right. So we're going to have T2.
3781.22s: And T2 will effectively take the same format as these. This one's a formula.
3793.22s: So the risk is going to be defined by what we buy in for which is 5200 bucks.
3802.90s: And then the return target what's the target return that we think that we're going to get.
3810.10s: This isn't actually that it's just I need to lock this so.
3815.14s: Because I dragged it.
3816.02s: Yeah. No, I hear that. I'm asking now what the return target is.
3826.50s: What I'm trying to do here is to help us understand. Again, like to your second comment,
3833.78s: right. Where you said wildish. We want to actually be able to answer that question. Like is it
3838.66s: wild. And obviously I already know the answer to this. But let's see. So here we have a scenario
3849.22s: where we're risking 100 dollars to make we're risking 5200 dollars to make 100 dollars.
3857.14s: So now let's take a look at the probabilities here. And we'll analyze this trade.
3864.42s: I'm going to get rid of this one for now. And we're just going to look at this one in SPX.
3871.46s: So where do we make 100 dollars? We effectively need it to move either to 52 or we need it to move to 22.
3886.58s: So let's take a look. 52 or 22 within this three day time frame. So 22 is like a 87% chance.
3906.98s: And then 52 is a 90% chance based on current price. So really high probability of getting that.
3916.10s: Now this. This doesn't include a really important element here. But let's say
3924.34s: win amount. Win, prob. Lost amount.
3932.42s: Lost prob. And let's see. So what I can tell you from a portfolio level, this is going to be
3941.30s: inherently way too big, right? Having 20% of our $25,000 portfolio in this one trade is
3950.90s: nonsensical. Now we might say, well, I'm not planning on losing the 5200 bucks, right? We're
3958.82s: planning on managing it. The reality is the market can move very fast. The probability of the
3966.98s: market moving that fast is quite low, but it's not it's not zero. So it's a scenario where the
3977.86s: severity of the move is enough that it requires us to treat the severity of the move with respect.
3986.90s: It means that we can't go under the assumption of, oh, this is a low probability thing because the
3993.78s: severity of it, meaning the damage it can do is a lot. Ben says, sorry, I thought if it moved,
4001.62s: it would be good. Definitely in this context with this one individual trade, that's 100% the case.
4008.66s: The risk that this trade obviously faces if is if the market doesn't move. But my point is is
4017.14s: and you'll see in a second with having 20% of the portfolio at risk in something on zero DTE,
4025.38s: the theta on those options is going to be eroding super fast. So what's going to happen in your
4031.78s: scenario is this win probability of 88% is actually going to plummet very quickly throughout the day.
4041.94s: And the reason why it's going to plummet throughout the day is because of that exact
4047.54s: function where theta is going to be bleeding out fast. So then the amount that it's going to have
4054.34s: to move in order to make the $100 is going to expand. So this 88% probability is really only going to
4062.34s: be at the jump. So let's take a look, one minus this. And then let's figure out our expected return.
4080.98s: Oops.
4092.42s: Times this. So this is a massively negative expected strategy, even though super high win rate,
4103.22s: because the win is so small relative to the loss, it is a highly, highly unprofitable strategy
4112.66s: in this context. So this obviously doesn't include any friction fees, anything like that.
4120.58s: And just for broader context, let's do a little bit of math. And let's say how many trades
4128.50s: does one losing trade wipe out 52? So this is an example of at the individual trade level, the
4139.78s: strategy level, this doesn't make sense. At the portfolio level, this doesn't make sense because of
4146.90s: the size of the portfolio risk. We're talking 21% of the portfolio in an individual trade.
4153.06s: So completely reasonable to look at. But after exploring this, I would personally refute this
4160.34s: strategy. I don't think that this strategy would make sense. And I think that it forces us to take
4167.86s: a lot of risk relative to what we might actually get out of it. So I personally wouldn't be a big
4174.50s: big fan of it. But again, completely cool to test the idea, right? Like that's the whole idea.
4182.34s: So now, let's come up with another idea, just for the sake of it. We can think of other
4191.54s: more thematic plays. Now right now, the reason why I'm focusing more so on more thematic plays
4197.38s: is because I'm trying to run something that's a higher probability of happening.
4202.50s: So we have something that if we take a look at the portfolio level, let's bait a weight this
4208.18s: against the spy. If we bait a weight this against the S&P 500 and we take a look at this
4217.94s: trade here, this trade gives us really light deltas. So just literally, it's going to behave as
4227.62s: one share of spy and we're collecting $1.88 of theta. We do have not insignificant
4234.34s: Vega potential impact, but overall, we're still we're still good here. So the enterprising
4242.66s: trader might say, well, based on my broader market analysis, I would like to be slightly net long
4252.18s: my bait-a-weighted deltas. The reason why this part matters so much is because when we look at
4262.02s: the goal of a lot of novice traders that think they're doing something smart by being
4267.46s: delta neutral, right? So having our deltas flat now, well, that means that then you have to put
4274.02s: on a lot more of the trades in order to hit your target of $313. The reason why this is the case
4283.78s: is because if I have one trade that's long deltas, that is going to try to make me a buck 60.
4290.50s: And then let's say I have another trade that's short the same number of deltas that's going to
4294.58s: lose me the $300 bucks or whatever. Well, the problem is is that we're now essentially offsetting
4301.70s: the other position. This happens a lot because retail traders, they get into the bad habit of not
4309.06s: wanting to make decisions. And then they're like, well, deltas neutral, that's what I want to be.
4313.94s: And there's nothing wrong inherently with managing your deltas. We're actually going to do that
4319.46s: here, but we have to do it in context. So now let's take a look at a couple other general market
4326.18s: themes. Again, just kind of cobbling ideas together here. And we can say industrials look kind of
4331.54s: weak. They're, you know, they had an up day, but maybe we think industrials might be going down
4336.98s: still and it looks like tech started leveling off and rallied on the day and tech has gone down a
4342.74s: lot. So maybe we want to be long tech just again, throw in ideas out. So let's go back to the Visualize
4349.70s: tab and let's go into industrials. And let's take a look at what's been doing poorly,
4355.14s: Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin. Let's take a look at both of those really fast.
4362.66s: It doesn't look bad. And Lockheed Martin doesn't look bad either. But we could say that given the
4371.06s: broader landscape of peace talks going on with Ukraine, the US diminishing its support
4377.46s: of Ukraine and spending less money potentially on this broader bucket with cuts and defense
4383.30s: maybe we think that that's going to impact Northrop Grumman. So let's take a look at the
4388.42s: implied volatility percentile 90 percent. So really high. This is also going to be good for
4392.58s: sell side strategy. And we're looking at shorter term timeframes here because sell side strategy.
4398.50s: We don't want to be outside 60 days. And this one we think a little bit bearish. Now we're looking
4404.02s: at the width of these right out of the gate in their five points wide. We have to pay attention to
4409.46s: that. And the spreads here are absolutely horrendous. The ability to trade something like this is
4417.70s: essentially nullified right from the jump. You can't even find something in there with a
4421.70s: multi-like strategy. Let's see if Lockheed Martin is any better. And it is not by much,
4428.90s: and it's only some of them, but it definitely is better. So let's say that we take a look
4434.58s: at this $5 wide spread, the 490 to the 495, which is a 27 delta and a 20 delta. Let's analyze this
4444.66s: trade. First, let's analyze the trade by itself. And we want to look at Lockheed Martin.
4455.70s: So this has us risking $295 to make $205. So again, let's take a look at the probabilities on
4461.86s: this one. So we're trying to make $205. We're risking $295.
4481.54s: The win probability here will figure that out now. So what's the probability of these 27s remaining
4490.66s: out of the money? Right now, the probability of them being in the money at expiration is about
4495.22s: 25%. So let's call it a 75% chance. This is a positively expected strategy on individual
4504.50s: trade level. So this one also fits within our risk tolerance to 95 represents a 1.1% risk of
4513.54s: the portfolio return target. Here's $205. So now if we, what is this looking at? These got all messed up.
4525.94s: So now if we take a look at the total return that we get, we're actually in surplus.
4533.62s: And with just these two trades, we're risking 2.54% of the portfolio. So does this mean that we
4541.22s: stop here? No, because now we can say, how does all of this fit together? And what else might I
4549.14s: like in the broad market? So let's now go back to the beta-weighted portfolio. And then let's look at
4558.34s: something like spy. And let's see how these operate together. This essentially is saying, if spy
4567.30s: remains within $4.46 and $7.10, that this strategy itself would, I don't know why this says not
4578.74s: traded. What happened here? What happened to our EXC trade?
4592.42s: Now this thing's also saying it. I don't know why these are saying it.
4598.10s: That's annoying. Anyways, let's see if I can rebuild these super fast.
4606.18s: Yeah, okay, so that's good.
4611.46s: And then EXC, we did like this one and we did five of them.
4619.46s: Good. And let's see if this breaks it. If we go to spy,
4623.86s: that doesn't work. Good. No. Okay, great. So we actually have our broader metrics.
4629.22s: We can see now that we're actually net short, a tiny bit of delta's. We're very long on theta
4635.14s: and we're short about 12, so the portfolio as it sits is in a really healthy spot I would think.
4643.78s: And we're using very, very little money. The total amount of money that is tied up in the
4649.54s: portfolio right now essentially is $635. So if we take a look at that $635 of the total utilization,
4660.50s: again, it's like two and a half percent. We're really not using a lot of the portfolio. We have a
4665.06s: lot of the portfolio that we can go out now and frolic and find ideas. But the important thing here
4672.02s: is we can use the portfolio level metrics to see does this make sense for what we want. So
4678.02s: let's take a look at one more trade. And this is actually to bake in this idea from Shrej,
4684.66s: thinking about duration. And right now all of our positions are in one expiration. And there's
4691.22s: nothing inherently wrong with that. But it does mean that there's going to be a little bit more
4694.90s: activity around there. And maybe we have a couple longer term ideas. Maybe when we're looking at
4699.86s: something like, well, you guys tell me, what do we, what do we like longer term here? We can look
4707.14s: at things like Palantir maybe. Palantir looks good on a longer term timeframe. So let's take a
4715.14s: look at maybe an idea in Palantir. And let's say we go out 63 days. And we know that with an
4723.46s: account this size, it'll be a little bit difficult to find something that fits the total sizing.
4730.66s: So in here, if we buy one, we're risking 1225. So let's throw that in our risk really quick.
4737.94s: 1225 4.9%. It's a little too high. So then we can do a couple things to lower this total risk.
4749.22s: One of them is we can trade this as a diagonal. So if we go out 34 days and we sell a 28 delta,
4757.38s: that'll give us $2.67. So let's analyze that. What I'm going to do is get rid of all of them for
4764.82s: now. And I just want to look at Palantir. And let's go back out. Where was I? One of these. This
4774.18s: one's fine. 98 days, 90 day diagonal. That's cool. I think we were in the 60 days, but that's okay.
4780.90s: So this one's 1410. So let's analyze this together. So the max risk in this trade is 1150.
4792.50s: This still represents too much risk. So we can either make the decision and say, I'm okay with this
4800.10s: being slightly elevated risk because both of these are slightly under risk. Or we say to ourselves,
4806.66s: this is too expensive of an underlying. And this exceeds our 3% risk threshold. So instead,
4813.94s: I'm going to have to look for something else. Those are the two choices here. But if we take a look
4819.62s: at how this fits in with the broader portfolio, if we wait it again, something like spy.
4827.38s: You see you get the the dagger of death. But the main thing I want you to pay attention to is the
4833.38s: deltas. Now we're long 14 delta's of spy. And we can say, am I comfortable with this? We're still
4839.70s: net long theta. And if we want to be net long delta's in general, then this aligns just fine.
4845.38s: This is the beta weighted element. The beta weighting gives us a method to analyze if our current risk
4853.30s: aligns with what we want it to be. So this here is literally the meat and potatoes of how to build
4862.50s: a portfolio. And then the management of it is again, captured in those other videos.
4868.02s: But when we're looking at building the portfolio to then subsequently figure out the management,
4874.34s: the management from here is easy. It's just managing the individual strategies aligned with the way
4878.98s: that we built our strategy outlines, right, from way earlier in the season. But this part here is
4886.98s: now management of the portfolio comes down to how do we use the money to get the return that we
4892.10s: are targeting in order to hit our long term objectives. So last bit here, we can say for a palancier.
4901.62s: Let's say that we think our price target to the upside is going to be a hundred bucks. And let's
4907.86s: say our risk management to the downside is at 63. So if we look at just Palantir again,
4915.38s: and we say we're going to manage risk at 63, which really takes our total risk down to like 800 bucks.
4922.58s: So if we take a look at this and we think this being close to 800 bucks, that takes us to a 3.2%
4930.10s: total risk a little bit closer. And what do we think we're going to make at the profit target,
4937.14s: funny hundred bucks is our max profit, which is 356 and 912. So 912 would be at expiration,
4949.62s: the decay of the short option. And before that, it would be 356. So something in there. So then we
4956.18s: can say what's the probability of us hitting 100. And then again, we can complete that expected
4961.14s: return calculation. So then we see if all of that makes sense for the portfolio.
4968.50s: All right. So I know that that's quite a lot. And I want to see what residual questions you have
4976.66s: related to this broader topic. And I want to make sure that there are two key things you walk
4984.58s: away with. The first thing is the importance of developing portfolio level goals, which I think we
4989.54s: hit. And then the second thing is this process that I literally just showed you on how to
4996.90s: employ your portfolio to hit those goals while maintaining all risk metrics. That's exactly
5005.14s: what this is all about. So what questions, anything that you guys want to hit
5010.42s: and related to this, anything stick out. I hope that the exercise itself is generally useful.
5023.06s: And the main takeaway there is we can use different kinds of strategies. And in a smaller portfolio,
5031.22s: you guys already know that I'm really not a fan of vertical spreads. But it is always a game
5038.98s: of accepting trade-offs. And that's really what happens here is we have to decide the trade-off
5045.78s: that we're comfortable with. So Paul says, how do you assess the downside risk of undefined
5052.42s: loss strategies? And you may negate the risks associated with jumps, absolutely. So it's a great
5057.30s: question. Now, if you'll notice in the context of this trade wrong thing,
5069.30s: in the context of the Palantir trade, what I'm doing is I'm first starting from a place
5078.66s: of deciding if the total debit that I'm paying, so the total risk of the trade, is it within the
5086.82s: realm of possibility? Like, is it marginally acceptable for me? So that's the starting point.
5093.14s: So in this case, I'm essentially planning from worst case factor. So if you recall, in the
5100.26s: beginning, I'm essentially saying 1125 risk. This 4.5% is that tolerable for me. It's a little bit
5110.50s: on the high end. I'm not expecting to hit it. I'm expecting to manage it before then. But could I
5116.02s: tolerate it? And the portfolio definitely could. The next question is, how do we pick what the risk
5123.62s: is? Well, exactly that process you saw. The process is based on my P&L management of the strategy,
5130.50s: whatever my approach is for managing profit and loss targets. Now, the risk associated with jumps
5138.26s: can be mitigated in two ways. The first way is by making sure that we're not stepping in front of
5143.30s: some sort of big industry leading event that might hurt us. The second thing is by looking for
5148.58s: historical context of what are some of the worst jumps that we've seen? This is the worst jump
5154.74s: that I've seen and it's related to an earnings event, which is from 83 to 102. So that represents
5161.70s: a 20 point move. So if we run from 86 to 66, what's the total damage that we deal with there? Let's
5172.42s: go to 66. The total damage there is actually less than the stop that we've already included.
5179.30s: So that's exactly how you bake all of that in. The risk associated with jumps, they're mitigated via
5186.74s: trying to avoid scenarios that often lead to jumps. And then the second is via sizing.
5196.02s: That's a good question. Anything else you guys have?
5202.58s: If we hit all these, I think so.
5221.54s: Now, one other thing that actually is going to be relevant to you guys that goes into like literally
5228.58s: all like these two specifically way more in depth is this video.
5239.06s: Sweet. All right. It looks like we're all good. She I'm not seeing any more questions. So I'm
5243.86s: going to wrap it up. If you have anything else you want to go over as always hop in the discord
5248.58s: happy to take a look. Tomorrow I have a AMA on Reddit that I'm doing at 1500. So you're welcome
5255.06s: to drop anything there. You don't really have to because you guys have better access to me in the
5258.18s: discord. But yeah, if you need anything, let me know. Enjoy the weekend. And I will see you guys
5264.50s: later. You know, I'm
