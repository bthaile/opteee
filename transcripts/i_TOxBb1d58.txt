0.00s: What's up, outliers? I did the exact thing I said typically. Don't do this.
5.48s: And it's from a video called buying call option smarter. I'll throw a link to it below.
9.66s: But this trade that I put on in DJT that made me over $45,000 broke a lot of the rules that I typically follow.
17.74s: But I want to walk you through why trading is a game of very carefully building positions that do what we want.
26.48s: And in this case, it definitely included building something that is very different than my go to approach.
32.86s: So we're going to walk through exactly what the trade was, how it was structured, how I managed it, and how it made me just shy 50k.
39.42s: What's up, everyone? Welcome back to the outliers. Shout out to the Patreon family.
43.14s: If you're into trading that kind of thing, consider joining up to great group.
46.48s: And let's get right into it. So the trade here is pretty straightforward and it's centered around DJT. Why DJT?
54.80s: Well, because this has really become a proxy for the election.
58.88s: And if we go back, this is a three year daily chart, you can see that DJT has been all over the place.
64.64s: It's been over 100. It's been down to 1175.
68.40s: And it's rallied back up the jishai of 55 or right around 55.
73.88s: This most recent move that we've had here is literally over 360% a massive move.
81.70s: So what ended up happening here was obviously I'm following the overall election probabilities and stuff like that.
88.96s: And a really curious thing happened. So if we go to polymarket here, and you take a look at this red line, which is the probability of Trump winning.
98.76s: And if you take a close look, this movement looks a heck of a lot like what you see here in that funny.
106.12s: Notice how you have this big pop up here right around this area.
109.48s: Then it goes down into this trial and then it starts working his way back up and out.
113.68s: This is an important note. But specifically, I want to draw your attention to this period in here, where we can see around the fifth, the sixth of October, somewhere right around in there.
123.52s: We can clearly see that the probability for Trump overtaking Harris starts to move up.
130.88s: And if we align that with the first trading day after the fifth, which would be the seventh, notice how we have this pop.
137.48s: And then it's been up and away, very similar to what you see here. Interesting. Isn't that.
143.04s: So this has clearly become a proxy for the outcome for the US presidential election.
150.56s: And it's a really important note because it means that the fundamentals of this as a security have not changed.
157.40s: As an overall brand business, they're not doing anything different.
160.84s: There's no fundamental new release that they've had to drive new value.
164.60s: All of this is become a proxy.
166.88s: That means the way that I build a trade in this is going to be very, very different than something like in video, where I think it's going to continue going up longer term, even though it's not right now, because of the potential.
180.96s: It can have to change an industry. There's a different value prospect there than something like this.
186.32s: So let's take a look at the details. Now the first thing to note here is that the allocation is actually undefined.
193.80s: I do this for smaller positions. I don't really care how much money is tied up in the trade because I'm fortunate.
199.64s: I have plenty of room to move around. I'm not running out of capital at any point in time.
204.12s: This is different than when I was trading a smaller account, I'd be very careful and actually allocate each trade.
209.32s: I don't really do that for a lot of these kinds of trades anymore.
212.68s: Now what I do use to manage overall sizing and risk is I use a max risk limit.
220.40s: And in this case, I used $15,000.
223.40s: This is a very, very small fraction of the account.
227.72s: This is for a very specific reason, which we'll talk about in a minute.
230.68s: Why this is such a small amount relative to the total portfolio, less than a percent.
237.08s: And if we take a look at the overall fit, this is clearly going to live within the speculative allocation.
243.80s: This is a highly, highly speculative place can be very short term.
248.20s: Why is it going to be so short term because of the overall idea behind this trade?
254.80s: Because if we take a look at this again, no fundamental change, my expectation is that after the election,
262.40s: whether good or bad in terms of the outcome for Trump and the way that this stock would prospectively move,
269.36s: I think whether he wins or doesn't, this is likely going to contract to a degree because it can only go so high based on essentially nothing.
279.32s: So that's why this is a very short term play that's going to be wrapped around the election.
284.48s: It's actually was structured very similarly to the way that I do earnings,
289.40s: where I want to include the closest expiration that includes the earnings event itself.
294.12s: So what's the strategy here?
295.88s: This is where things deviate from my normal.
298.12s: Most people are used to hear me say something like ratio called diagonal or deep in the money long calls.
303.24s: This is different. This is a unit play.
306.20s: And this is one that I don't use that much as you can tell because I typically talk about not doing this.
312.28s: But there are always exceptions to things and this is definitely an exception based on the expected movement that I thought might happen.
320.76s: The way I looked at this trade is that it was either going to move enough in my direction that it was going to compound quickly because of long gamma.
330.20s: Or I was going to lose this 15k.
332.60s: That's kind of it. It was almost a binary outcome in my mind.
336.36s: So I'm essentially building a play that's really built around long gamma.
340.68s: That's really what units means in this instance.
343.40s: And so what is that in context?
345.40s: Let me show you.
346.68s: If we pop over the platform and we look at DJT today, which is the 31st of October,
353.32s: you can see that there's 15 days to expiration for the 15 note.
356.68s: Why the 15 note versus the 8 note?
359.16s: Because these are going to be more liquid.
360.52s: That's why.
361.48s: So even though this is better exposure to the event itself,
365.88s: it's going to take a couple days for the results to come out.
369.00s: But then more importantly, I need liquidity.
370.84s: So that's why I'm here.
372.20s: Now, if we take a look at this notion of building units,
375.64s: if let's say I were to buy an app the money call in this case,
378.60s: you can get one for like 10 bucks.
379.96s: Just call it that for simplicity 10 bucks.
382.52s: And if we go all the way out of the money to these 115s,
385.16s: you can see let's call it 90 cents that they're trading for.
388.68s: You can essentially put on 11 of these for every one of these.
394.68s: So typically, I prefer to pay a little bit more up front and to buy stuff that's at the money
400.84s: slightly in the money because I'm not necessarily expecting a parabolic move.
405.48s: Most of this stuff I tend to trade has decent moves, but not stuff quite like this.
411.16s: Now, there's another reason for this specific build out.
415.32s: Because let's take a look at the max risk.
418.84s: You'll notice for the size of the position that I'm going to show you,
422.20s: I can't actually hold this indefinitely.
425.56s: So having a lower gamma actually, I'm sorry, having a lower delta helps me a little bit.
431.80s: Because the gamma will rapidly build the delta's if it moves in my favor,
436.52s: but because it's already a pretty low delta,
439.00s: if I don't get a directional move in my favor,
440.84s: it gives me a little more time to be in the trade.
443.64s: So the same reasons why I typically favor the opposite.
446.20s: It fits this thesis a little bit better.
448.76s: So on the 24th slash 25th, it was kind of phased in over two different days.
454.36s: I'll zoom in to this specific time frame here and drop for you.
458.60s: So here's the 24th and here's the 25th.
461.00s: And it's essentially at the same prices, it was just over two days.
464.60s: I got the vast majority of the position on the 24th.
467.24s: And then I got a little bit more, just a little bit more on the 25th.
471.88s: So if I look at the core position that was built,
474.68s: this is what went on.
475.88s: And then in my normal annotation, you can see it below.
479.16s: So DJT was trading around 35 bucks.
481.32s: I grabbed 500 of the 15 note, 115 calls at 78 cents.
487.32s: So this was a moderate size position in terms of what the options chain could hold,
493.00s: but still not a very large trade altogether.
496.36s: The delta at the time of entry was 0.09 gamma was 0.01.
500.92s: So the outlay for this was about 39,000 bucks.
504.76s: And then again, for my 15k cap on risk, that would let me go to about 30 and a half.
511.16s: So if we flip back over to the chart and kind of see those two entries,
515.32s: and then we had a big gap up one sided rally.
518.52s: And then we had this topping day, and then we had a bit of a contraction the last two days.
525.16s: Now, before I show you the next part, I want you to comment in the video,
529.00s: where you think I started phasing out.
532.60s: I'm very curious the way that you guys think that I went about it.
536.04s: My guess is most of you will have some of it right, but some of it wrong.
538.92s: And I'll explain why.
540.44s: So on the 28th of October, DJT was around 46 bucks.
545.16s: And I sold to close 400 of these for $1.85.
551.00s: So that brought in 74k total and netting it against the outlay for 400.
558.28s: The net P&L for this specific position was 42,800 bucks.
563.08s: And that left me with $7,800 in residual risk in the position that was remaining.
569.56s: So 100 lots still at 0.78.
573.56s: So what's going on here?
574.76s: Why did I do this on the 28th?
576.44s: Well, it's really simple.
577.72s: If we take a look at this big giant rally, there was a fantastic exit point for me.
584.28s: Because again, if you go back to the original prospect of this position,
588.76s: it was either make some money or lose 15k.
592.36s: That was kind of what I was expecting to happen.
594.76s: And in this scenario, I got a bigger move than I originally anticipated.
600.20s: And for this kind of profit mechanism, which is a really short term,
604.20s: just insane momentum breakout style play, you can't you can't overstay your welcome.
609.40s: It is as you can tell, like literally as you can tell, it is too easy to overstay your welcome.
614.68s: So my idea here was take some of it off in case this didn't happen or this didn't happen.
619.80s: If it went straight from this to this, because there's also a reality about this day,
626.28s: because I actually would have preferred to hold it a little bit longer.
629.08s: But in fact, life happens.
631.56s: And this is a great example of this because on the 29th, I was actually getting an assessment
637.72s: for a herniated disk in my back.
639.64s: It was like a six hour session throughout the entire trading day, essentially.
643.24s: I was not going to have time to watch the markets on the next day.
647.40s: So I managed some of the risk on this day, knowing that this position needs attention.
652.60s: And I wouldn't be able to give it fully what I needed on this day.
655.24s: That's the reality here.
656.76s: And I purposely mentioned that because trading is a mix of adherence to systems,
661.72s: but then also interacting it with life.
664.20s: And that was going to be the reality for my 29 of October.
668.52s: So that leaves me with just over 40k in profit.
672.76s: I have 7800 left to go in risk.
676.20s: And that leads me to the 30th.
678.60s: So at this point, I decide to let the trade go for a little bit, see what it does.
683.16s: And it starts to consolidate, take back down.
685.64s: So I sold to close 98 of the remaining 100 for a dollar 25.
692.12s: So that brings in a net of 46.06.
695.08s: That takes the total profit here to 47,406 bucks.
700.60s: And you'll notice that this is 98.
702.60s: Why 98?
703.64s: Because I am a degenerate.
706.04s: I left 2 on because I literally couldn't care less to what happens.
710.20s: It's like one 200 bucks total.
712.12s: And I just I literally just want to see the fireworks.
714.28s: I just want to see what happens.
715.64s: So I'm leaving 2 on literally for the lulls.
719.00s: The rest of the trade has been done already.
721.72s: By making this first original phase out,
724.92s: I remove all of this risk immediately from the trade.
728.68s: And I still left a little bit on.
731.08s: In case I get a decent move, there's still 100 lots that could continue to compound.
736.44s: Because again, this was a gamma play.
738.36s: And the gamma was just starting to accelerate.
741.64s: So that's why I took the first leg down.
745.56s: Essentially, it removes all risk of the trade.
747.64s: Let's it live a little bit longer in case there's a cool move.
750.36s: There wasn't a cool move.
751.48s: So take down the residual to maximize value.
755.56s: And then leave 2 options on simply because YTF not.
762.20s: So as always, if you have any questions, let me know.
763.96s: Be an outlier.
764.76s: I'll see you all later.
