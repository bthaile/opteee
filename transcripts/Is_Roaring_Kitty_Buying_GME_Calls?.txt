0.72s: what's going on with the ape Community
2.72s: time for a gme update because somebody
4.84s: sent me uh this post actually from Super
7.24s: ston and this is from Mojo Master 5 and
11.52s: the post says he's back Keith in the
13.96s: house and speculation opinion so the
17.72s: post here we'll go through it and I just
19.60s: want to share my thoughts on what this
22.12s: is what it looks like um I haven't gone
24.76s: through the whole thing yet obviously I
26.36s: can tell from the top here what this is
28.76s: about and let's see what's going on is
31.72s: roaring Kitty getting back into gme
35.12s: options that's the Assumption I have
37.08s: taking a look at this so let's get right
39.64s: in so it says see that yeah that run
43.52s: beginning around uh
46.32s: 1430 so I'm assuming that they're using
48.88s: eastern time was a block of 5,25 calls
52.96s: for 15 nove picked up at the offer so
56.12s: this is assuming that they buys and a
58.64s: really important note here
60.72s: is when there are the different
63.84s: classifications for the price based on
66.96s: if it's executed closer to the bid or
68.84s: the offer it's not perfect uh in this
71.56s: case I'm assuming it's representative of
74.84s: them being purchases but just a general
76.92s: note for people to be aware of because
78.52s: it's not as simple it's not definitive
81.00s: you should just know that um could be
83.36s: our boy decided to make a splash today
85.28s: and triggered a little gamma squeeze
87.00s: action while doing
88.92s: so looks like a couple big boys followed
92.12s: in his wake as well and let's take a
95.72s: look here at this at their screen shot
99.12s: and they're just showing the movements
101.88s: in this is the volume for that contract
105.20s: now a couple notes specifically with
108.64s: respect to gamma squeeze gamma squeezes
111.32s: are really specific in 5,000 options is
114.76s: is just not going to do it the other
116.92s: thing to keep in mind is if we take a
120.24s: look at GameStop
123.84s: here and let's Zoom this in just a
126.32s: little bit so that we have kind of
128.28s: near-term price action on a really cool
131.04s: note if you guys remember I drew this 20
134.16s: and a half level a long time ago and
137.40s: that was where I was expecting support
140.24s: to be found just based on prior price
142.92s: activity around that level going back uh
145.88s: longer term time frame right going all
148.40s: the way back to here and the really cool
151.24s: part about this is that it does seem
154.32s: like that might be close to what this
157.60s: new floor might look like for GameStop
160.24s: which would be maybe mid-20s on the
162.64s: lower end maybe mid 19s but it looks
165.60s: like it's really respecting this General
168.04s: range meaning lots of people are buying
169.80s: and selling in here so for the near term
172.36s: it doesn't look like it's moving
173.76s: parabolic either direction but I don't
176.80s: think it's a bad thing because I think
178.08s: it's starting to base out here and have
180.64s: kind of a new generalized
182.64s: value now if we take a look at the
186.92s: options in here though I want to show
189.92s: you a couple things
192.16s: quickly looking at the 15 nove the
196.32s: 25s if we see the current Delta they're
200.04s: about a 33 Delta as it sits now and the
202.72s: gamma is like a 0.09 now the idea of
205.52s: building a gamma ramp actually isn't
207.92s: about individual strikes a gamma ramp is
211.96s: built over several strikes being ramped
215.72s: up because the way that uh gamma ramp
219.28s: will work is as the underlying rallies
223.16s: and options fall in the money especially
225.60s: as the closer to expiration market
228.04s: makers who are typically the
229.36s: counterparty would start buying shares
232.76s: to cover the new risk meaning in case
236.52s: they fall in the money and they have to
238.36s: deliver then
240.80s: as they are buying shares that moves
243.08s: price up a little bit into the next
246.40s: strike and if there's enough open
249.20s: interest at the next strike that was at
252.32s: the money they have to start buying more
255.36s: to hedge that risk and then it pushes it
257.44s: to the next strike and then that's how a
260.84s: gamma ramp is built so right now there's
263.48s: just not enough depth in these options
265.88s: to actually serve as an actual gamma
268.04s: ramp just for a a General understanding
270.80s: about more so how those will
273.08s: perform
274.80s: so um and then the idea of a couple
277.40s: other players following along it does
279.48s: look like that because the volume today
281.40s: was over 20,000 so this actually popped
284.32s: up on a couple of my scans today just
286.84s: because of the activity pretty
290.16s: drastically exceeding in already high
293.12s: oi so yeah definitely other people moved
296.32s: along however if you've watched my other
298.52s: videos on stuff like GameStop you
301.32s: already know that at these kind of more
304.80s: primary expirations as I refer to them
306.96s: as you're going to tend to see more
308.60s: concentration so what that means is
311.00s: anything that ends in like a zero or a
313.40s: five will tend to have more volume than
316.56s: things that are in the middle and
317.92s: definitely whole number strikes as
319.48s: compared to half strikes so if we look
321.48s: at the 20s there's 4,000 of those if we
323.84s: look at the 21s there is 427 then if we
328.72s: look at the 22s there's 1,500 and you
332.08s: kind of get the point here until we get
333.52s: to the 25s which even before today had
337.04s: 18,000 and then if we get to the 30s you
340.60s: can see that had 13,000 so that's just a
343.96s: a really natural
345.80s: tendency as people buy options so again
349.60s: just a a general note uh for you all
353.40s: this looks like just some of the other
354.68s: trades that went through says these are
356.44s: short dated calls if he doesn't close
359.40s: this trade right away for a profit which
361.16s: he absolutely could then he must
362.64s: anticipate something else is coming down
364.08s: the pipe maybe it's him maybe it's a
365.68s: copycat in any case exercise caution so
368.12s: I like that they're being objective in
369.88s: their analysis specifically in turn in
372.80s: terms of um maybe it's him maybe it's a
375.84s: copycat I think this is already very
377.84s: presumptive in terms of saying if he
379.56s: doesn't because again we we have no idea
381.92s: now I want to talk about a few things
384.04s: the very first thing I want to show you
385.84s: are some of roaring kitties habits and
388.64s: if you're unfamiliar here I've been
390.60s: doing a live stream every Saturday for
392.88s: like the last what 3 months 4 months now
397.20s: and we've spent at least two of those
399.40s: months analyzing every single trade that
401.76s: he's made and going through one by one
406.12s: now there's a couple really highlevel
408.80s: tendencies that I've been able to pick
411.08s: up looking at his stuff the first thing
413.80s: is if I take a look at the various days
417.36s: to expiration that he tends to get in at
421.60s: the
422.96s: overwhelming
424.48s: majority have entries that are much
427.80s: longer days to expiration that's
429.92s: actually what this is here it's tracking
431.96s: the actual days to expiration for his
434.36s: entries the shortest was a 3 DTE trade I
438.16s: literally could see it this was back in
441.04s: 2020 and it was a very specific trade
444.44s: that was wrapped around a thesis he had
446.44s: around a console release and the impact
449.16s: around earnings so this was the only the
454.44s: only circumstance that I've seen
456.48s: anything shorter than a month for him
459.64s: now that being said there was a
462.12s: circumstance here where in April it did
466.96s: look like there was some
469.84s: activity that appeared to be him but we
474.64s: have no idea because he didn't post any
476.72s: sort of yellow updates nothing like that
478.84s: and these were actually slightly shorter
480.88s: term options but still not super short
484.52s: so the main thing I want to highlight is
487.60s: that if this is him it would be very
490.40s: very contrary to his standard
492.40s: positioning at all meaning um just days
496.84s: to expiration selection would be quite
499.84s: novel in this case now as far as Delta
503.80s: selection I think that's about right so
505.92s: he does tend towards the slightly out of
509.08s: the money
510.28s: so this looks fine the main thing I see
513.96s: here is just way too short in duration
516.64s: now if we go to unusual whales and we
519.52s: take a look at this there's a couple
521.00s: other notes that I want to highlight the
522.92s: first one is that again if this were him
526.24s: this is still a very small position for
528.12s: him so
530.76s: $350,000 again for most Mortals that's a
533.24s: ton of money but for him if you're
535.16s: trading a several hundred million dollar
537.28s: account it's tiny and I would be really
540.48s: surprised the other thing is I don't
543.28s: think this is him phasing into a
545.20s: position because going back to that we
547.84s: tend to see multiple entries on his
551.12s: prior quote unquote phasing in of
553.52s: positions that then hits a Crux that he
556.64s: sizes in more aggressively now this is
559.00s: using the 21 june2 calls that he was
562.40s: getting into about a month out in 20 may
565.36s: this ended up being a massive position
567.68s: so this was scaled in over several days
571.12s: if he was trading a really shortterm
573.28s: idea he doesn't have this much time to
575.56s: scale in like this so I would actually
577.84s: expect him to size in much more heavily
581.04s: UPF front if I thought that that was
584.40s: him which again I'm a little uh dubious
588.84s: of it in in in short I this just doesn't
591.88s: look like his activity now there are
596.16s: things that do match though the strike
598.32s: selection absolutely does the 5,000 lot
600.76s: size certainly does but again it's
602.32s: always important to remember he doesn't
604.56s: have any sort of hold of 5,000 Lots
609.56s: right other people transact in 5,000
611.48s: Lots the position size is a little bit
613.64s: small the timing is about right because
616.84s: as we went through all of his old trades
619.08s: here I definitely noticed a lot of
622.12s: towards end of day entries as well as
624.24s: beginning of Day first hour was pretty
627.04s: common for some of his other positions
628.76s: and definitely
630.00s: towards the this is Pacific Time towards
631.96s: the end of the day is very common the
633.92s: majority of the trades were done um a
636.92s: little bit later in the day so that fits
638.84s: as well in general it looks like a
641.96s: slightly mixed bag I lean towards this
644.44s: doesn't look like him if you have an
646.64s: opinion let me know in the comments if
648.20s: you think this is him or not be an
649.52s: outlier be an ape I'll see you guys
651.28s: later
