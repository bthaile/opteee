0.00s: Hey everyone, Eric here wanted to do a quick update on the small stacks portfolio.
6.84s: So in short, this is relatively going to be a quick video, not much going on, but I'm
12.60s: doing my best to try to make these videos as I'm making adjustments, hopefully at least
17.76s: same day or within a few days.
19.36s: So let's jump over the screen and take a quick look.
22.72s: So big change from today is essentially just took down the BAC short puts.
29.92s: So in there, I was short the 24 puts.
33.20s: I got a $1.22 and I closed them today for a nickel.
36.72s: That was more or less a no brainer.
38.12s: I was essentially going to take it to expiration, but once I started seeing a couple down moves
44.40s: after it's gap up, you know, just took it down, took the profit in and we'll replay the
49.48s: capital once I see something.
53.16s: And then if we take a quick look at the diagonals, this is also essentially status quo.
61.96s: So let's take a quick look at these products just so that you can kind of see an idea of
69.00s: what I'm seeing in Bank of America as you can tell we've had this gap up and then kind
76.12s: of more inside day here, starting to come down a little bit here.
80.32s: So really what I was just trying to do is ride out as long as I could to collect as much
86.00s: premium out of it as I could and taking it down for a nickel today.
89.56s: Like I said, it's essentially no brainer.
92.84s: So really just after this kind of big up move, I wouldn't want to stay in there.
98.28s: My basis was, you know, down here.
100.52s: So that was relatively simple, straight forward trade.
105.16s: And then we look at take a look at Kruger right now in there.
109.88s: If we pull this back up, I am short the 35 calls.
115.40s: So we're still way up here on those short calls with my basis, which obviously is an
121.60s: ideal.
122.60s: I'd rather be a little closer to the money, but it's just kind of how it goes sometimes
126.28s: with the diagonals.
127.28s: You might get a move that slides again.
129.60s: She a little bit like we're seeing right here, but that's okay.
132.44s: So what I'm doing is essentially just leaving those on until either they expire in the
137.52s: money, which looks extremely unlikely or until I can take them down for 90 plus prop 90
143.80s: percent plus profit.
146.52s: And that's really all there is in here.
149.80s: Now the one thing I will highlight in Kruger is the fact that I do have two leaps and
157.72s: I'm short only one right now.
160.24s: So it's still an uncovered position and I still have the ability to add another leap.
167.28s: I'm sorry, I had another short call.
169.88s: If we start to get some sort of rebound and I can get some additional premium, but right
174.24s: now for me, it just makes the most sense to hold on to having it at a ratio so that I
181.52s: can experience a little more upside.
183.56s: That's what I'm prioritizing in this.
185.92s: And then if we take a look at Intel, this trade is still doing well.
193.56s: That's kind of the good thing about these diagonals is that things that remain range bound
197.40s: like this tend to stay healthy for us.
201.00s: So right now the leap that I have is trading at $10.
204.68s: We got in at $10.35, so we're essentially at par there.
209.28s: And we're short the 20 no 47 call against and that's trading about at parity right now.
217.76s: So same price as when I put it on, nothing really to be done in here just yet other than
224.32s: simply waiting and allowing I just realized my face is in the way.
228.92s: There you go.
229.92s: And allowing the trade to just run its course, see some theta bleed out and then kind of
240.28s: going forward from there.
241.44s: But with Intel, obviously, I still really like this product long term.
247.60s: And the other thing that I'll definitely note is that we still have a really, really
252.24s: good basis in here for our critical strike, which is $46 right now.
259.88s: So that puts us right in the mix.
262.16s: If we take this short call in and look to add another, we're really well positioned to collect
268.56s: a bunch of premium being able to sell right at the money.
271.96s: So those are the main positions we have right now.
274.96s: Let's close this off and take a quick look at the macro view.
279.52s: So right now, total PNL, the portfolio is $11.56, which is almost a 19% return.
287.84s: The account is doing really well.
290.56s: Capital total is $6156, like I said, just essentially adding on to the 5K.
297.56s: So that's where we started for those of you that might be joining in.
301.80s: And then utilization, we're only consuming 2392 right now, which is less than 40% utilized.
308.52s: So we got cash to use.
310.44s: So right now, I'm essentially just going to go shopping.
313.12s: The reason why I haven't found something just yet is with the market making the moves
317.92s: it has the last few days, I'm not really rushing to get into anything, especially because
323.80s: this is, if I stop right now, making 19% over the course of a year is a good return.
330.24s: So I'm not again in any rush to just throw risk out there trying to chase something.
335.84s: I'm going to continue to pick my shots carefully.
340.68s: And you can see the breakdown from which is returning the most diagonal still outperforming,
346.60s: which makes total sense.
347.92s: It's way more capital efficient.
350.32s: And with the credit outstanding as it is right now, we stand and make another 121 bucks,
356.56s: which is about 2%.
358.56s: Return on, return on the count.
361.84s: So overall, again, it's still looking to be pretty healthy.
369.16s: And when we take a look at, when we take a look at where we're going forward, essentially
377.28s: for the rest of the year, I'm going to continue to try to find longer term plays that I really
382.92s: like and just offering those out, whether it's the cash that you're put or the diagonals.
390.24s: And if you'll notice, I'm not trading any verticals whatsoever.
393.92s: None of those have come out.
394.92s: I'm not really trying to swing trade anything.
397.56s: I'm not sitting here trying to scalp in here.
401.76s: And the reason is, is just smaller accounts struggle with that.
405.24s: It's really difficult for smaller accounts to maintain a healthy risk profile in those
410.20s: scenarios.
411.20s: So that's why I continue to beat this drum of doing our best to trade this small account
419.08s: in a similar way to when you grow your account.
423.04s: Because right now, the most important thing is practicing and developing a skill set.
428.56s: This $5,000 is not going to turn into a bunch of money.
432.64s: Now again, if we take a look at the return that we achieved in this account, if this instead
439.92s: of being a 61, 56 account in terms of overall capital, as soon as you start expanding that
452.40s: out, if we had something closer to, let's say, a million dollars, all of a sudden that
460.52s: return starts to mean a hell of a lot more.
464.00s: Instead of it just being, you know, $1,000 in this account, it immediately starts to grow.
473.24s: And now you're talking something over what, $185,000, something like that.
478.32s: So the, again, what we're focusing on here is the skill set.
483.48s: And then as you continue to save, find, you know, compound returns in the account, find
490.04s: other sources of income, that's really what makes this whole investing thing pretty powerful.
495.80s: So that about wraps up this session.
498.80s: If anybody has any questions or anything, let me know.
501.56s: And for, I'm probably going to take this through into the new year, but I probably will
507.24s: stop this somewhere in January.
510.48s: I think most folks more or less get the point now.
513.88s: So it's not really anything earth shattering, but with that in mind, if there is anything
519.36s: that you want to discuss with this, you know, with kind of the January being the end, make
525.68s: sure you let me know because I'll end up developing another portfolio like this, maybe, you
532.04s: know, like mid size or a large size, but that's kind of TBD.
538.00s: I'll chat with you all and see what you would like to see what would be more helpful for
542.68s: you.
543.68s: I think for me, what I would like to do is, you know, just pick a larger account, maybe
549.04s: open up a portfolio and just move maybe like one, maybe one mill or like $5,600,000, something
557.72s: like that.
558.92s: And I think that would be helpful because that really is a completely different skill
563.36s: set when you're trading with a larger amount of capital.
566.44s: So I think that would be really helpful to take a look at one of those style accounts
570.80s: as compared to just the micro accounts.
573.84s: So if there's a preference there, obviously let me know and we'll catch everybody later.
