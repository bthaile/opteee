0.00s: Chances are you're leaving money on the table as an options trader, especially if you
5.36s: don't carefully differentiate between buying premium and selling premium.
11.20s: At the end of this video, you're going to have a really solid understanding of the trade
15.08s: offs between both of them and to see what is a better fit for what you're doing.
20.84s: What's up everyone?
21.84s: Eric here.
22.84s: Welcome back to the outliers.
23.84s: Let's get right to it.
24.84s: So, buying versus selling options, you'll hear all sorts of stuff.
27.84s: If you are familiar with theta gang, you'll hear theta gangers convinced that theta in
33.28s: and of itself is an edge, which fun fact, it unequivocally is not.
38.04s: And then you'll have the people from Wall Street bets that are yoloing on cheap options
42.80s: that swear their lotto that ended up luckily hitting for them is the way and its way
48.08s: better than selling premium.
50.04s: So how do we get to the bottom of this?
51.96s: Well, we need to understand in detail the difference between buying and selling premium
56.76s: as you can see on the y axis here.
60.28s: I broke it out across a bunch of different metrics.
65.00s: So that at the end of the video, once I go through an example with you, you'll be able
69.72s: to follow along pretty close in detail and see exactly how to come to the correct decision
76.08s: for what you're doing, whether you want to buy or sell premium.
79.76s: So, first let's start with some general practice admin stuff.
84.92s: It's kind of real simple upfront to buy premium versus selling premium, the entry
89.92s: and exit trades.
91.32s: Just for those that don't know, if you're buying premium, you're buying to open.
95.68s: And then if you are selling premium, you're selling to open and then to close, it's the
100.28s: inverse.
101.28s: Now let's get into the important stuff, the risk profile.
105.68s: Now when you buy premium, you are defining your risk.
109.72s: Your risk is going to be defined as whatever you bought your option for.
116.00s: Let's look at an example.
117.64s: If we pop over to the chart and we take a look at Palantir, let's say that you're an
122.12s: enterprising trader and let's say that you saw Palantir had a really good earnings and
127.56s: a gap up and you're like, ah, post earnings announcement drift looks like it might be an
132.28s: order here.
133.28s: Let me speculate with some long calls.
135.40s: Well, let's say you go in and you buy a handful of the long calls and you pick the 50s
141.28s: that are out in 17 Jan 25, pure hypothetical.
143.72s: And you got those for $5.43 at the time.
147.52s: And if you're curious what the time was, that would have been on the 5th of November.
153.36s: And notice though, the downside risk is capped.
157.68s: This line here levels off and it can go no lower.
162.76s: It shows you that your risk is defined.
165.80s: That is very different.
167.36s: Then for example, if we sold a put, if we switch that and now you take a look, you'll
172.68s: actually see that your profit now is capped and your loss is now uncapped.
181.20s: So that's a really big difference between buying and selling premium.
184.72s: This is probably one of the biggest differentiators.
187.44s: This is probably one of the things you should really pay attention to because as we come
192.76s: back later to figure out tips on how to decide between buying and selling premium, that's
197.20s: going to be one of the major decisions.
198.84s: It's going to be based on the risk and reward profile.
201.72s: Now, let's talk about the break even point and what that means.
205.24s: So if you buy premium, it requires an accommodating move in order to make money.
210.72s: If you sell premium, you have a built in buffer.
213.48s: So what does that mean?
215.64s: When you buy premium, you have a slightly lower probability of profit depending on where
219.52s: you choose to buy.
221.00s: And if you sell premium, depending on where you choose to sell, you will have a higher
225.00s: probability of profit.
226.56s: So what does that actually look like?
228.16s: Well, let's go back to this example.
230.72s: And if we look at selling a put today as it sits in Palantir, you can see that right now
237.84s: this is current price.
239.88s: Our max profit is anywhere above 55 and our break even is down here at 5247.
247.28s: Meanwhile, Palantir is trading at 5985.
252.12s: So that means that it literally can move all the way from 5985 down to 5247 and you can
259.32s: still be profitable.
260.96s: Now this always sounds better than it actually behaves and it's an important note.
266.28s: A lot of people get twisted up on this because take a look at this purple line.
271.80s: This purple line represents today and then this blue line represents at expiration.
276.84s: So yes, at expiration, as long as it's above 52 and change, you would essentially walk
283.92s: out at a break even up until that point though, you're losing money.
287.52s: And in this case, you would be losing $304.
291.20s: That can be really painful if you have a bigger trade.
293.96s: So you might be thinking, oh, okay, great.
295.72s: I have such a big buffer.
297.52s: It starts to feel a lot different when that buffer is getting eaten up.
301.68s: It moves down to your break even.
303.44s: You're holding a big loss and now you're looking at a choice.
305.92s: You're like, well, crap, if I hold this, it would be a profit.
309.72s: If it doesn't go down lower, but if it goes down lower, now we're getting into the nasty
313.44s: part of the undefined risk aspect of the trade, which is again, not inherently good and
319.48s: bad, but it's something a lot of traders mistakenly give themselves a false sense of confidence
324.36s: and they think they have this big buffer and sometimes they don't.
327.32s: Now the other admin note from a pedantic standpoint is for selling a put, a stock can only
333.16s: go down to zero.
334.52s: So if we swoosh this all the way in and then we slide all the way down as like you can
339.44s: see that there's actually a defined loss all the way down here.
343.48s: And it's just because it can only go down so far until it gets to zero at which point
351.08s: you're done.
352.08s: Now that's not the same for short calls, stuff that is to the upside, there's no cap.
357.80s: So the way to think about these two is it really depends on the movement factor, but it's
363.80s: really important to remember that the built in buffer for selling premium comes at a cost.
369.16s: The cost is undefined risk and sometimes that can sneak up on you a little faster than
373.80s: you think and it can cause a little bit more of a problem in terms of an expected return.
379.48s: What does that mean?
380.48s: Take a look in this same example, if we sell this put, we're collecting $260.
387.56s: Let's just say that balance your tanks for whatever reason it goes down to 40.
391.48s: Well now we've just lost $1,270 in pursuit of making 260.
398.32s: Right?
399.32s: So it's a big loss for a very small game.
401.60s: And this is the pennies in front of a steamroller analogy you'll hear from Thadigang where we're
406.96s: playing a delicate game and a lot of traders rely a little too heavily on their expected
413.80s: probabilities and they're not managing the trade which still needs to happen.
419.64s: So so far you can see that there's some very clear differences between these.
424.20s: Let's talk about the relationship with volatility.
427.04s: So volatility when you buy premium, it helps you if it goes up, hurts you if it goes down.
433.80s: As volatility increases in an underlying, all options appreciate in value and inverse if
441.36s: it goes down.
442.36s: And then obviously the inverse will help if you sold premium because when you're selling
445.92s: premium, the game is you want to sell premium whatever you're selling it at higher and
450.80s: you want to buy it back lower, whether you sell a put sell call doesn't matter in terms
454.12s: of the premium outlay.
456.28s: So if we have volatility that contracts that decreases the premium that benefits our
462.48s: trade.
463.48s: Now from a capital requirement perspective, it's a little bit different here because for
468.76s: buying premium, the capital requirement is going to be whatever you purchase the option
472.52s: for.
474.04s: Meanwhile for selling premium, there's going to be a margin requirement and the margin
477.80s: requirement is going to depend on if you have a margin account, what margin positions
481.48s: you permissions you have.
483.04s: In this case, I'm using a pass through IRA.
486.00s: So what that means is there's nothing in the account, but more importantly than that,
489.40s: you'll notice that the margin requirement for this 55 put is $5,500 because in the
494.28s: IRA account, you can't have negative puts has to be cash secured.
497.36s: If you have a margin account, then maybe you have regulation T or if you have a slightly
500.96s: bigger account, you can have portfolio margin.
503.56s: The one thing to note about this specifically, the margin requirement for selling premium
509.08s: is that it changes as the broker perceives more risk.
513.48s: They are going to expand the margin requirement.
516.56s: They're not going to take the risk for you.
518.28s: So they're going to give you the leverage, meaning you can control, excise position,
522.76s: putting up a smaller amount of money, whatever that margin is, but they're going to adjust
527.44s: it based on their risk and they're going to pass that onto you.
531.00s: That doesn't happen when you buy options.
533.00s: Buying options is whatever it is right from the jump.
536.52s: In a quick note, just on the Greeks for those that are curious, when you buy premium,
541.88s: your short data.
543.56s: The simple means as time passes, your options lose value in the form of theta decay.
549.88s: When you buy premium, your long gamma.
553.76s: That means that moves in your favor, if you buy a call and you get a move up, it helps
559.56s: your position compound quickly.
562.16s: I have a trade that I recently did in DJT.
564.24s: I'll throw a link below that is actually built around what we call building units.
569.28s: It's a gamma play.
571.04s: Then long row is already what we talked about in terms of volatility.
574.72s: I just wanted to add it there for a general note in case you were wondering.
578.72s: Now for selling premium, you are long theta.
582.04s: That means you're collecting the theta decay from somebody else.
586.12s: However, you're also not long short.
591.20s: That sounds like a bit of a tough position to put on.
593.96s: I guess you could put it on, but you're short gamma.
597.88s: That means big moves tend to hurt you.
600.36s: Again, it does depend on if you're short of single option or short, like a straddle
605.80s: or strangle in those instances.
607.88s: The way to think about the gamma relationship is if you're long gamma, you want a big move
611.96s: in your favor.
612.96s: If you're short gamma, you want little movement.
615.12s: Now, you also understand already the relationship with volatility.
619.24s: Now let's get into some of the tips here for you to onboard.
624.72s: At the end of this, you should actually have a really clear way and framework to think
630.40s: about do I want to buy premium here or do I want to sell premium?
634.76s: The first one is use both.
636.80s: There's no inherent advantage to either one of these.
643.44s: Buying has a use case.
645.92s: Selling has a use case.
646.92s: I'm going to show you an example in a second of this.
650.56s: I used to think selling was better than buying, like a lot of enlightened traders as they
655.84s: go through a few years of trading, they really think that selling has an edge and it can,
661.04s: but it's not because of selling in and of itself.
663.48s: It's because of other factors that have to be carefully tracked.
666.64s: I actually find really great success using both of these.
670.16s: This is why my overall approach to trading, which I'll throw a link to that below as well,
675.88s: I actively use both and it's because they each have a use case for many.
681.76s: Now, what's the next primary tip here?
685.16s: It's don't default.
686.84s: One of the things that I find people will do is they will automatically think, oh, I'm
692.16s: going to sell premium here.
693.92s: I'm going to buy premium.
695.92s: What I think about instead is fitting the profit mechanism in your risk preference.
703.00s: This is part of something I call the outlier strategy process.
706.84s: I have a video as well that I'll link to below on this, but the thing I really want to
711.16s: focus on here is this idea of outlining fitting structures.
714.48s: This is step three.
716.32s: Let's take a quick look at an example together.
718.68s: If we pop over into here and we take a look at Palantir, if for whatever reason we had
725.36s: that position we talked about that perspective trade that came in on the fifth and we think
730.08s: that Palantir is going to have a big move.
733.40s: If we think that there's going to be a big move, would we rather have defined or undefined
742.08s: profit potential?
744.20s: In that case, I would rather have undefined profit potential because if it's going to
748.52s: be a big move, I don't want to be limited by just getting the credit that I received.
754.16s: I'm building a broader portfolio and I'm being aware of the impacts of Greeks on the
761.40s: portfolio.
762.40s: I realize I have a bunch of long options.
764.40s: I'm losing money every day in theta.
767.24s: Maybe I want to try to sell some options in order to offset some of that theta decay.
773.16s: The idea is don't default to buying or selling.
777.24s: Use both of them in the context that it makes sense.
780.24s: Let's take a look at another example quickly.
783.04s: If we take a look at something like Qualcomm, which essentially has been trending sideways
786.92s: for the past three months straight even through earnings, doesn't really look like it's making
791.56s: big moves to the upside or to the downside.
793.64s: Well, I don't want to buy options because it's not moving enough.
797.80s: Maybe this becomes an instance where selling options can be a great add to the overall
803.12s: portfolio, add to diversification in terms of different profit mechanisms, and it offsets
809.24s: some of the theta.
810.24s: It gives me positive theta.
812.80s: So if we take a look at some of the common misconceptions, we already talked about one
817.84s: not being better than the other, but the other thing we have to highlight here is overweighting
821.24s: volatility.
822.24s: There are a lot of traders that will automatically default to selling premium if implied volatility
828.96s: or implied volatility percentile is high and they will default to the inverse if it's
834.80s: low via buying.
836.68s: And that's a mistake.
837.96s: The reason why it's a mistake is because unless you are actively delta in gamma hedging
843.08s: to truly isolate volatility, delta is still the more important input to your formula.
850.92s: What does that mean?
851.92s: Well, let's take a look.
854.28s: If we take a look at Qualcomm, we might say implied volatility percentile is 54.
858.36s: Let's just say that this was really low.
860.36s: Let's say implied volatility percentile was 10.
862.96s: If you're an option seller, you would look at that and say, oh, well, that's super low.
866.44s: I don't want to sell volatility there.
868.48s: It's too cheap.
869.48s: And if volatility expands, it'll hurt my position.
872.16s: It will.
873.16s: However, it's temporary because as long as Qualcomm remains range bound, if we sell a
878.36s: strangle, for example, even if your position temporarily hurts because volatility has gone
883.68s: up, data is still going to decay.
885.96s: And as long as it remains range bound, you're going to have a full profit at the end of it.
890.20s: So volatility is a massively important consideration when you are looking to buy or sell options.
898.96s: It's a massive input as a decision factor.
901.52s: However, it should not be the decision factor.
906.20s: It shouldn't be default to selling or buying based on volatility alone, unless again,
912.24s: you're deploying a specific volatility trade.
915.68s: That's different.
916.68s: Of course, volatility then becomes the primary input.
919.12s: That is your actual profit mechanism.
922.12s: So that is exactly how I think about buying versus selling premium.
926.32s: The main decision it's going to come down to is what kind of risk profiles do I want.
930.72s: I'm going to manage it whether it's bought or sold.
932.72s: So it doesn't matter quite that much.
935.04s: And then the second is how do I feel about the profit potential given the corresponding
939.46s: trade-offs?
940.96s: If I have something that's an undefined profit, I know I'm going to have a lower probability
945.12s: of profit.
946.12s: I'm going to have to be better at picking direction.
948.16s: And it's going to have to move in my favor within the expected time frame.
951.84s: And I have a video down below on buying options smarter that shows how to balance some of
958.16s: these things.
959.88s: Or inversely, if I'm fine defining the profit, I'm not necessarily expecting a big move.
965.52s: And I just want to benefit from the passage of time.
968.16s: Then selling premium can make a lot of sense.
970.88s: So as always, if you have any questions, anything you want me to go over, let me know.
974.28s: Be an outlier.
975.28s: Thank you.
