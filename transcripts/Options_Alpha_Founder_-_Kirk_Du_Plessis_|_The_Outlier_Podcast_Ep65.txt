2.08s: what's up everybody we got Eric and Kirk
4.84s: welcome back to the outlier podcast and
6.96s: I'm stoked to have you on thank you for
8.60s: joining me one of my audience members
10.64s: actually introduced me to you and what
13.16s: you were doing so I had a chance to look
15.32s: through some of your background I'm
16.76s: stoked to chat with you thanks for
18.00s: hanging out awesome man I appreciate it
20.00s: thanks for being here yeah dude so we
21.44s: were just talking a little bit about the
23.04s: coal building that you're in and kind of
25.28s: commenting the fact that here in
26.80s: California we don't really have that
28.04s: kind of history is that part of the
29.44s: reason why you stay in the Northeast is
30.72s: that where your family's at what what
32.12s: keeps you there yeah yeah family took me
34.68s: here for sure when we had our first kid
36.16s: we moved back to Pennsylvania where my
38.04s: wife is from so I love it though I mean
40.28s: like the seasons are great like it's
42.16s: just good place to live you know like my
44.28s: kids don't never really knew what
46.04s: traffic was until we went back to
47.76s: Virginia and visited family so it was
50.00s: pretty fun yeah it's pretty rad well
51.88s: it's also probably better for like their
54.40s: emotional development as human beings
56.84s: not to deal with traffic I feel like as
58.80s: soon as you find that you lock a
60.40s: different part of your brain that you
62.04s: might not even know is there so that's I
64.08s: mean like we're we're Western PA so like
66.24s: we do have a lot of like I mean Amish
68.44s: influence here is like pretty big when
70.08s: gets out outside of town so so they know
72.48s: that but like when we go back and visit
74.64s: you know family in Virginia they're like
76.12s: that why why are all these cars parked
77.68s: in the middle of the road I'm like
79.08s: that's traffic son
81.04s: like he's like that's crazy they just
83.16s: stay there all day I'm like most days
84.96s: yeah most days yeah yeah and and believe
87.12s: it or not they don't want to be there
88.36s: either yeah nobody wants to be there so
91.24s: that's the best part that's awesome man
93.52s: so I I had a chance to do just a little
96.52s: bit of background research I know that
98.56s: you did m&a at Deutsche Bank and then
101.44s: you got into um like re analysis I guess
105.80s: and talk to me a little bit about your
108.60s: entrance into Finance based on what I
110.96s: was catching when I was watching that it
113.04s: just seemed like U you had an idea of
116.16s: what this thing was going to look like
117.24s: and what it was going to feel like and
118.36s: then you did it and then you're like
119.64s: this is looking and feeling different
121.04s: than I expected but obviously I'm just
123.28s: taking a guess I'm curious from your
124.56s: perspective yeah I mean I think that you
126.56s: know like regard to option Alpha like
128.60s: specifically like I've always been
130.80s: interested in finance like just
132.48s: generally I think it was it was nothing
134.36s: that like necessarily came super easy
136.68s: but I know I didn't want to do anything
138.28s: else I've always been just fascinated by
141.16s: like finance and like why people make
143.44s: money or don't make money or how people
145.24s: like generationally like build wealth or
147.28s: not wealth so I would say like as a
149.28s: collective like I'm just like that's
150.88s: what I do that's fun like I read Finance
153.24s: books like I don't I don't do anything
154.96s: else if I watch documentaries I try to
157.20s: watch Finance documentaries or like
158.96s: Market documentaries um so I'm a total
161.60s: junkie in that that regard and I think
164.08s: where like my path eventually led to to
166.92s: options and then option Alpha is just
169.00s: like just kind of more of like
170.32s: self-learning and discovery of like
172.00s: there has to be a better way to do this
173.88s: you know like just watching you know
176.00s: like my parents they were in the same
177.24s: industry you know like growing up so
179.12s: like their income was very volatile in
181.24s: the sense that you know like when it was
182.96s: good it was good and when it was bad it
184.36s: was bad because they were just both in
185.56s: the same industry right and so I kind of
188.04s: like grew up trying to figure out like
189.80s: how how do you hedge that like how do
191.44s: you get to more of a steady state you
193.80s: know and and how do you do that and so I
196.00s: guess that that's like the very like
198.12s: deep background around like options is
199.96s: like how how can you try to do things in
202.08s: both directions and you know or even
204.32s: non-directional and and try to do
205.96s: something and so when it came to option
207.88s: Alpha it was just purely a Blog at first
209.84s: like it was just a little Google blog
211.16s: spot like a blogger thing and then
212.72s: eventually came and you know just kind
214.28s: of grew people ask questions I try to
215.84s: put things together I I feel like I I
218.16s: like and enjoy teaching I like learning
219.92s: and trying to like pass on some of that
221.96s: you know or at least my perspective of
223.72s: it to some degree and you know over the
225.96s: last 10 plus years now it's completely
228.04s: morphed in many different directions but
230.12s: you know I think where we're going so to
232.24s: some degree like we kind of know where
233.44s: we're going but at at the same time it
235.24s: very feels very new every day I will
237.52s: tell you yeah that seems like one of the
239.52s: really cool things about what you're
240.88s: doing cuz similar to you I well I
244.04s: actually when did you start like
245.96s: actually trading in your personal
248.40s: capacity I mean really like before the
251.04s: 2008 crash I started trading I remember
252.76s: trading through the 20072 2008 crash but
256.64s: I mean even before then I think I was
257.96s: like I think my my very first stock
259.84s: certificate is up there that's like a
261.28s: Nike stock I made my dad buy me as a
263.20s: custodian yeah yeah I still have it I
265.68s: don't even know if they would accept it
266.92s: now they probably don't even accept that
268.32s: stuff anymore yeah but but I've always
270.92s: like kind of enjoyed that but really
272.36s: kind of like right before the 20072 2008
274.60s: that's when I you know really started to
276.68s: get more of an interest in doing it so
278.72s: which is really interesting because I
280.32s: started trading in 2007 myself when I
282.40s: was in high school so it's yeah it just
284.60s: kind of was the way you're talking about
286.44s: it made me think a little bit about it
289.48s: seems like some of the background and
293.24s: the progression that you found as you
295.00s: were talking about it really resonated
296.68s: with me so what led you specifically to
300.40s: options as compared to the Nike stock
303.56s: that you started with obviously you
305.44s: found your way into derivatives and I
307.32s: remember back then it's not like there
309.88s: was a ton of stuff out there on
312.20s: derivatives I ended up like stumbling
314.24s: across it literally reading a book in a
315.88s: library pretty old school but that's
318.92s: exactly how I found derivatives how did
320.80s: you come across them I I think that I I
323.52s: kind of stumbled into them like I did
325.04s: you know like we used to calculate black
326.32s: scholes in college like by long long
328.56s: hand like doing that I kind of got an
330.44s: interest in doing it that way and and
332.36s: found out you know a little bit more
334.44s: about it as I kind of like progressed
336.12s: and like grew and stuff like that but I
338.80s: think for me it really came down to like
340.16s: figuring out like that there was this
343.00s: completely other way to invest that was
345.80s: not just omnidirectional like one
348.04s: directional like you buy it and it goes
349.88s: up and it goes up right and and we many
352.36s: people have probably heard of Short
353.52s: Selling right when they get started and
354.96s: they're like oh well you can sell it and
356.32s: then it goes down but just like the
358.00s: capital usage just seemed like a drag
360.64s: you know like I read all the books about
362.04s: Buffett and you know Munger and all
363.72s: these guys I'm like I just don't even
365.44s: know if I had the wherewithal to like do
367.40s: that for a long term like could I really
368.96s: pick and choose you know different
370.64s: companies I mean when I was a read
372.24s: analyst like one thing I always remember
374.08s: and I tell people this a lot at times
375.36s: like we had a company that announced
376.96s: earnings and I mean REITs are pretty
379.00s: boring I mean like it's a leverag
380.92s: corporate bond essentially that trades
382.68s: right so like reats are insanely boring
384.60s: like you know exactly what it is you
386.08s: have all the lease schedules like all
388.16s: the debts lined up like it's it's almost
391.12s: so predictable it's scary right but then
394.32s: the company announced had great earnings
396.08s: whatever and the stock went down and
397.68s: it's like what like come on like so now
399.96s: you know like even if you get it all
402.36s: right even if you find something that
404.64s: you you absolutely know what the
406.52s: schedule of payments and cash flow is
408.20s: going to be and you know what the
409.20s: operating you know the whole de like it
411.40s: still doesn't matter like because the
412.80s: market has their own opinions and their
414.84s: perspectives and then you got all these
416.40s: other things that just get thrown into
417.52s: the mix so at that like I would say like
420.00s: around that time is when I started to
421.56s: figure out like okay like there has to
423.08s: be something better and so for me
424.56s: options not only just ridiculously more
427.08s: Capital efficient but just from this the
429.48s: sense of like being able to very quickly
433.32s: change and move directionally into
436.20s: different strategies I always found
438.84s: insanely fascinating like if something
440.84s: wasn't working could I you know
443.04s: re-engineer the strategy could I roll it
445.24s: could I hedge it could I do something
447.40s: like there no pun intend but there's
448.92s: just a lot of choice chice and options
450.08s: and doing that like if you can figure
452.12s: out something where you can move that
453.96s: fast then then I feel like that's that's
456.20s: the place that I need to be like if you
457.80s: even look at like real estate like real
459.16s: estate you can't move that fast I mean
461.20s: you really can't like closings take 30
463.72s: 45 60 days right sometimes now 90 days
466.92s: right and you can update and renovate a
468.92s: property but like that's time and
470.24s: capital I mean like so there's a little
471.84s: bit of that component to it but in
473.80s: options like I can be out in an entire
475.56s: industry in in five seconds you know I
478.00s: could be completely short and completely
479.92s: long two different Industries in the
481.76s: morning and the afternoon right and I
483.32s: could be neutral something else and like
485.28s: that speed and like the ability to
486.96s: change direction and then also I like
489.36s: have the ability to to comprise a
491.84s: strategy based on the outcome that I you
493.88s: know think or maybe think is is working
495.76s: I think has always fascinated
497.88s: so I completely resonate with you and
500.80s: one of my favorite books is actually
502.60s: right there it's options as a Strategic
505.16s: investment by Lawrence McMillan you
507.60s: obviously must have heard of it at some
508.92s: points giant textbook like really
511.40s: foundational Concepts I think it's
512.96s: nothing like super crazy but one of the
515.44s: things when I was first reading it that
516.96s: really stuck out to me is the concept of
519.24s: like a Strategic investment which is
521.60s: kind of what you're highlighting is that
522.96s: you have the ability to trade something
524.48s: long you have something that you're
526.20s: trading to the upside but have uh credit
529.60s: you receive upfront limited profit
531.32s: potential but higher potential for
532.80s: profit those kinds of variabilities I
535.84s: think to your point are exactly what
538.36s: make options so fascinating and probably
540.92s: one of the most adjustable tools
544.88s: available for us to trade different
547.12s: dispositions however I imagine and I
550.32s: went through this myself when you're a
552.44s: newer Trader all of those
555.28s: choices also become your downfall yeah
559.04s: do you pick this one do you pick that
560.44s: one and then if you pick this one and
562.36s: you use it for three months and it
563.64s: worked well but then you find out oh it
565.24s: actually doesn't work that well you
566.36s: should have picked that one you know
567.92s: like that that world of choice actually
570.48s: become difficult so when you think about
573.68s: your journey through options how did you
576.20s: navigate that world of choice because
578.76s: you can set them up to be literally
580.76s: whatever you want and infinite variables
584.76s: can be overwhelming so what's your
586.60s: approach there yeah totally I mean so
589.28s: I'm definitely a fan of like I don't
590.56s: know if you are too but like I'm a super
593.04s: crazy fanatic now about like all the F1
595.16s: racing since like all the Formula 1
597.00s: drive to survive has come up like I love
599.16s: it now like and I've always liked cars
600.60s: and racing so that's not anything
601.84s: different but like F1 specifically but
603.84s: if you look at like an F1 steering wheel
605.72s: right which is like a insanely fasted
608.92s: agile car and use that as a proxy for
611.36s: options right that steering wheel has so
614.44s: many buttons on it and so many modes
616.96s: that those drivers go through even in a
619.44s: single lap I mean they're changing brake
621.60s: balance and they're changing you know
623.52s: like gear and battery pack and you know
626.08s: Energy Efficiency while driving 200
629.00s: miles an hour right so if you take that
632.36s: did you pull up one of those yeah it's
634.64s: like look at all those modes that
635.92s: they're on and if you watch them which I
638.60s: like in I I watch like I do like the
641.68s: cockpit view sometimes like and I like
643.56s: watching them I mean they're changing
645.08s: dials all the time they're shifting
647.16s: gears whatever so you think like options
649.44s: as a as a metaphor and I'm a sucker for
651.36s: a good metaphor so like you think
652.56s: options as a good metaphor for like this
654.80s: insanely fast agile machine that you
658.12s: have at your disposal
659.92s: and you can take it anywhere and it can
661.32s: Zig and zag and go fast and slow and
663.32s: whatever but then there's all these
665.08s: dials that you have to press and the
666.76s: reality is is that is insanely
668.60s: complicated to do I think though that
671.32s: many people press everything I I think
674.28s: that there's a natural inclination to
676.80s: touch every dial to mess with everything
680.04s: to want to understand the intricacies of
682.80s: how everything works and I get that but
685.24s: the reality is that many times you just
686.88s: got to get into a car and hit the gas
688.36s: and change the steering wheel and break
689.72s: and like there's a couple things that
691.28s: probably move the needle more than the
693.52s: combined essence of all the other things
695.72s: and so I think like over time and I I I
698.16s: feel like I'm still developing this so I
700.04s: don't think that I've figured it out
701.60s: totally yet but I think that I I've
703.60s: learned that there are a couple things
705.28s: that kind of save not save you but just
707.52s: like they're the really important big
709.28s: rocks like position sizing staying
711.68s: neutral diversifying tickers like you
714.08s: get most of that right and like selling
716.32s: premium like you get those big rocks
718.48s: right like you can make some mistakes
720.28s: along the way and be okay like you can
722.56s: come out unscathed but if you go in
725.04s: there and you feel like a you need to
726.92s: have you know a scenario for every half
729.36s: scenario that happens or modify
731.52s: something for every off that you know
733.84s: happens at the FED like that then like
736.24s: that's going to be a complicated road
737.68s: because you're going to want to always
738.80s: adjust and like recalibrate for every
741.00s: little thing like recently I I would say
743.68s: not recently fairly recently got into
746.00s: something with somebody who said like uh
747.72s: I was doing a workshop and I scheduled
749.72s: the workshop specifically at 2:30 when
751.72s: the Fed was speaking and a bunch of
754.12s: people got super mad and they're like
755.56s: why did you schedule this at 2:30 don't
757.40s: you know the FED is speaking and I was
758.72s: like of course I know the FED is
760.04s: speaking because I don't want you paying
761.76s: attention to the FED like I would rather
763.36s: maybe you come to a workshop learn how
764.92s: like options work or how different
766.40s: strategies work whatever and I got into
768.24s: this little argument with a guy and I
769.44s: said like why don't you like if your
771.92s: strategy is so dependent on what one
774.08s: person is saying like how can that be a
776.28s: sustainable thing you know like if you
777.96s: need to tweak your strategy like that
780.52s: moment that the market you know that the
782.32s: FED speaks or po speaks or whatever like
784.88s: you know like how brittle is that
786.24s: strategy and so I think in trading it's
788.88s: finding the things that actually move
790.44s: the needle like actually push the car
791.96s: down the road and then figuring out to
794.16s: ignore all the other stuff or make it
796.00s: resilient enough to trade through that
797.64s: like you can't figure out you can't
799.88s: possibly account for everything right
801.92s: and so it's it's figuring out like what
803.52s: are the most important things that kind
804.92s: of mesh with my style my profile as a
807.28s: Trader and and what what can I complet
809.28s: ignore because I can't figure out so
811.72s: yeah I love that it reminds me of a
813.48s: saying I use all the time it's from
815.32s: Leonardo da Vinci but it's um Simplicity
819.40s: is the ultimate form of sophistication
821.64s: true and I've I've really found a
824.44s: similar path it sounds like we probably
826.12s: have slightly different trading Styles
827.64s: just from what you were mentioning but
830.52s: regardless I think one of the main
832.60s: things that we probably deeply align on
835.88s: is a simpler more robust thesis and way
840.96s: of executing against that thesis and
842.92s: also the car metaphor was really
845.96s: fantastic I run a car club out here I
847.88s: love cars I yeah I've I've been building
850.16s: cars since I was a kid that that's
852.24s: actually a painting my mother-in-law did
854.56s: of uh C7 that's sitting in the garage
856.40s: that I built and yeah so anyways love
859.84s: love cars so
862.80s: yes we haveour conversation I can have
866.40s: too so yeah dude we we have a bunch of
869.56s: really cool places out here so we have
871.12s: thermal where there's a you know pretty
873.16s: well-known track bmwm school is there so
876.84s: I had a chance to go do that that was
878.36s: super cool but to your point on finding
881.96s: the specific levers that give you the
885.08s: Paro principle right 80% of the solution
888.00s: on 20% of the focus that that's I
890.12s: definitely found that with driving and
892.12s: in trading is well when you think about
896.72s: the way you started trading and then the
899.56s: way that that's evolved over time walk
902.56s: me through that I think even like that
905.96s: Evolution has in my mind it has been
909.20s: like a slow progression and then in the
911.72s: last like let's say year year and a half
914.00s: it's been like a
915.72s: ridiculously I would say like in my mind
918.00s: in my mind and this may not be for other
920.28s: people looking at it objectively from
922.24s: the outside but it is completely changed
924.80s: in the last year year and a half and and
927.04s: I would say because many people and many
929.72s: Traders like we don't know what we're
931.12s: doing like we we come into the market
933.16s: every day and the analogy I use like you
934.80s: come in like a cowboy like walking into
936.72s: a saloon and you're just shooting up the
938.40s: place like you really don't have a plan
940.68s: you kind of like are gunslinging from
942.44s: the hip and you hope you hit something
944.72s: you know and that's 90% of people
947.12s: walking into the market every day and
949.04s: like so if you sit down at the you know
950.92s: your trading desk or whatever you have
953.24s: and you kind of fire up the markets
955.20s: whatever routine you go through you're
956.92s: looking for and hunting for a trade
960.00s: right there's probably very rare breed
962.92s: of people who knew exactly what they
964.68s: were going to do went there made the
966.08s: trade and then like bounced right and
967.88s: got out and so I'd say that for the most
970.04s: part that was the the initial Evolution
972.96s: was just like hunting for trades being a
974.84s: hunter and gather trying to figure out
977.00s: you know what we were doing and and how
978.88s: it was working and trying to write you
981.52s: know do some math and calculations and
983.48s: Analysis right but at some point it gets
985.60s: repetitive and you know boring and
987.76s: you're just like I forget I kind of know
989.68s: what a good trade looks like and so that
992.36s: was probably my progression for a long
994.28s: time is kind of like the hunter gather
996.56s: type Trader where I did have an idea of
998.60s: like I wanted to trade these symbols I
1000.60s: generally wanted to be pretty active I
1002.56s: generally wanted to stay pretty neutral
1004.88s: but there wasn't much mechanics behind
1007.96s: that right other than like the routine
1010.08s: and the habits that I had formed and I
1012.16s: feel like I had formed okay habits but
1014.36s: of course like I would slip all the time
1016.48s: like ah I forgot to make that trade or
1018.28s: gosh I should you know adjusted that or
1020.24s: I should have taken profits or whatever
1021.80s: the case is and so now where I've gotten
1024.96s: myself to is is to much more of I mean
1027.92s: like obviously I use our own software to
1029.76s: do this right and purely do this but
1031.76s: like now it's much more of a mechanical
1033.68s: thing where I'm really having my bots
1037.00s: look at and perform analysis for me and
1039.40s: then like I'm setting the criteria to
1041.16s: say like okay of all the things that are
1042.64s: out there these are the things that I'm
1044.64s: willing to accept and if you find one of
1046.32s: those then like let's try to go after
1048.08s: right so it's much more hands-off in the
1050.08s: sense that I I'm not in there digging
1051.72s: for trades every day I'm not in there
1053.84s: you know like looking through symbols
1055.56s: and going through option chains like
1057.36s: I've set my criteria and then I have to
1059.72s: have enough patience and you know
1061.76s: understanding to let the bot go through
1063.04s: those and try to adjust for Market
1064.36s: scenarios and oh that's different I
1066.08s: didn't know that you know it was going
1067.84s: to find that so let me adjust this and
1069.48s: tweak this and and it kind of runs a
1071.08s: little bit different I think that where
1073.04s: I go to nowadays is is really doing a
1075.92s: lot more of the and when I say I I don't
1078.24s: mean that I am physically doing this but
1080.16s: relying on technology to do the math and
1083.68s: the calculations and the the analysis
1085.80s: for me and then I'm just the gatekeeper
1087.84s: to say yes that's something acceptable
1089.68s: that I will take on as a trade does that
1091.96s: make sense yeah yeah it makes a ton of
1094.08s: sense so talk to me about what your
1097.68s: return profile looked like pre
1101.04s: automation or it sounds like General
1103.52s: automation but not like full execution
1106.84s: it sounds like there's still at least
1108.12s: some like human intervention on your
1110.04s: side like yes take this no don't take
1112.04s: that well you could like I still love to
1114.40s: trade so I'll go in and like find trade
1116.56s: ideas and just like kind of on two Z
1118.56s: pick trades but for the most part like
1120.60s: the trades that that my account is
1122.92s: making is purely through bots so like
1125.16s: okay some of the some of the Bots that I
1127.52s: run like it it will make all it'll it'll
1130.80s: make all the trades like in outjust if
1133.08s: there needs to be adjust whatever like
1135.00s: it's totally hands-off and so I look at
1137.44s: that and I say okay you know like
1139.40s: H how does that work out you know like
1142.20s: you know it it just depends like on how
1143.64s: many trades it could possibly find like
1145.20s: for example like I run a bot that's
1147.04s: trying to trade TLT TLT has been a bear
1149.84s: to trade because like the numbers just
1151.96s: don't add up there like that it just
1153.88s: hasn't been able to find a trade so that
1156.32s: bot's been running for seven and a half
1158.92s: months and has found two positions right
1161.68s: now does maybe that means my criteria is
1163.80s: too strict maybe it's not I don't know
1165.60s: but like it's found positions it just
1167.32s: hasn't found a lot of positions right
1169.52s: and so I look at that differently I
1171.44s: guess if that makes sense yeah yeah so
1174.08s: then when you look at your trading
1175.60s: performance pre and post automation SLP
1179.28s: partial automation how does how does it
1181.60s: compare how did you do before and then
1183.08s: how do you do once you started switching
1184.48s: over to this yeah I think it's about the
1186.52s: same in the sense that like I think I
1188.72s: generally stay in the same range where
1190.72s: you know I'll make a little bit I'll
1191.84s: lose a little bit whatever the case is I
1193.56s: think what I've found that is different
1196.00s: because like the Bots right now for me
1197.88s: are about a year a half two years into
1199.88s: it and some of them have been running
1201.32s: sooner some of them have been running
1202.80s: longer you know some like one B I run
1205.56s: has 49 trades another one has you know
1208.40s: 30 trades right so I don't know if
1210.32s: there's enough math yet for the Bots to
1212.16s: say like okay these are you know going
1213.92s: to be absolute home runs or not like
1216.04s: they're still maybe sort of in like a
1217.88s: testing mode of like you know sequence
1219.68s: of returns um but I think that the
1222.04s: difference for me is I know I'm getting
1223.64s: better trades out of them and I know
1226.04s: that I don't have to watch the markets
1227.72s: and and you like rely on myself to do
1230.20s: that like I can trade through like one
1232.32s: bot that I've had running since at least
1234.48s: the second version of it because I moved
1236.12s: it from a different brokerage has been
1237.84s: running for a year and a half and like
1240.20s: I've traded through every it's traded
1241.64s: through every fed every whatever every
1243.48s: discussion like I don't have to worry
1244.92s: about it if that makes sense so I think
1247.16s: mentality towards the markets has
1248.60s: changed I feel like I don't I don't
1250.44s: check and and like anxiously await every
1253.24s: movement every pre-market earnings every
1255.56s: pre-market you know thing like that
1258.04s: mentality change has been huge cuz like
1260.36s: it's super stressful to try and manage a
1262.84s: bunch of positions and then like
1264.28s: recalibrate everything when the markets
1266.28s: change I I think that that's insanely
1268.40s: stressful so got it so it sounds like it
1271.52s: performs around the same but it is way
1274.92s: less High touch in something that you
1276.92s: don't have to hover on that kind of
1279.16s: thing yeah yeah I mean it is what you
1281.20s: want it to be ultimately I mean like a
1283.20s: lot of people love to do high touch with
1284.80s: it like some people run 250 Bots like I
1288.20s: don't do that that seems like a
1290.04s: nightmare you know like that's
1291.16s: overkilled but I think for me because
1293.36s: I'm super conservative in running them
1295.44s: like it's about what I expected it's
1297.08s: just now I don't have to do it yeah yeah
1300.04s: that makes a lot of sense so when you
1303.48s: talk about the process of automation one
1306.36s: of the questions I have about that is
1309.52s: how do you maintain then your closeness
1312.08s: to the markets if you're not necessarily
1314.12s: combing through the options chains is it
1316.08s: something that you'll still do
1317.84s: periodically is to take a look at things
1320.52s: the reason why I ask is at least from a
1322.40s: discretionary Trader perspective which
1324.24s: is you know primarily what I do a lot of
1327.12s: what I pick up when I'm conducting
1328.88s: research doesn't always stem from
1331.48s: something I'm directly looking for but
1333.92s: it's a peripheral data point that I end
1335.68s: up seeing so is that something that you
1338.08s: either automate and then kind of look at
1340.12s: readouts that shows you those kinds of
1341.88s: things or you still perusing through
1343.48s: yourself to you know see what you find
1345.56s: periodically yeah I mean I think there's
1347.44s: like a level of keeping your head above
1349.12s: water and like situational awareness
1351.52s: like if you play football if you're like
1353.20s: a quarterback like you're going to be
1354.64s: looking at receivers right but like
1357.20s: you're not looking at the lineman that's
1359.08s: about to tackle you right but like you
1361.16s: kind of know he's there and you can kind
1362.68s: of feel him off to the side like you
1364.52s: know he's moved around the backside but
1366.40s: your eyes aren't looking at that you
1368.28s: know so there's a little bit of like
1370.32s: situational awareness that you should
1372.16s: develop as an investor where an investor
1374.48s: Trader where like if you're trading and
1375.76s: you're actively trading then you should
1378.04s: kind of know what's going on and I think
1379.88s: it also has to do a little bit with like
1382.04s: the duration of trades right so a lot of
1384.72s: people if they're trading like zero DTE
1386.60s: like every freaking day counts you know
1388.76s: like you should know exactly what the
1390.20s: hell's going on every day because if
1392.28s: you're zero DTE today like you should
1395.12s: know if the fed's speaking at the end of
1396.80s: the day like that's going to change how
1398.44s: you trade today right but if your
1400.24s: duration is say 35 45 60 days out well
1404.08s: then today shouldn't matter that much
1406.52s: right like it shouldn't matter so should
1408.96s: have an awareness of it like did the FED
1411.56s: like are we going to a new interest rate
1413.12s: environment okay that's something
1414.64s: important to know but if it's it's
1416.56s: something that's nonexistent you
1418.24s: shouldn't really pay attention to it or
1419.88s: just completely ignore it I think though
1422.44s: that I what I found even in doing that
1425.32s: is like I find that you generally see
1427.96s: just the quality of Trades come through
1429.72s: where it's like you see like oh I used
1431.36s: to get this much premium I used to get
1432.88s: this much premium Now call spreads are
1435.40s: you know pricing a lot better than put
1436.96s: spreads like that's a you know something
1438.44s: something that you start to see and
1439.68s: maybe the Bots are opening a couple more
1441.20s: call spreads but you know generally
1443.08s: speaking I'm much more numbers based
1445.12s: with trades like I tell my bots exactly
1447.64s: what I want what I want to get out of
1449.08s: them how they want to make how they
1450.68s: should make trades like what tickers
1452.12s: they should trade so I want to run a
1454.16s: more mechanical process that's long-term
1456.40s: that tries to avoid all of the all of
1458.68s: the noise but that's where like if I
1460.52s: make a trade and you know try to push in
1462.24s: a trade like if I see something I I'll
1463.96s: make a trade I'll be like okay I want to
1465.88s: trade something in that ticker symbol so
1467.64s: let me go find you know something to
1469.36s: trade in that ticker symbol and just do
1471.00s: it from a different angle I guess versus
1472.64s: just like randomly choosing like I think
1474.56s: a lot of people what they do honestly is
1476.08s: they pull up a option chain and they go
1478.76s: oh I don't know what the hell like
1480.16s: somebody said you know Tom said 45 days
1482.68s: to expiration so I'm gonna do 45 days to
1485.08s: expiration so and so said 50 Delta or 15
1488.44s: Delta so I'm gonna do a 15 Delta but
1490.12s: like is that the best trade right now
1491.80s: like there's no way to know unless
1493.08s: you're analyzing all the possible
1494.40s: positions like that's where we as humans
1496.96s: and like we are flawed like can't
1498.88s: possibly do that like our better more
1502.00s: strategic use is at a higher level to
1504.12s: say no these are the things that we will
1505.96s: specifically avoid and these are the
1507.36s: things that we will do and if you find
1509.32s: something then you can trade it but like
1511.04s: digging down into that math and those
1512.72s: calculations as fast as the Market's
1514.64s: moving like it's just not possible to
1516.16s: find I think the most optimal trades in
1518.84s: many
1519.84s: cases
1522.56s: interesting yeah yeah no I'm following
1525.00s: you now I was looking at your profile on
1529.04s: option Alpha and you look fantastic by
1531.76s: the way but it obviously does beg the
1535.52s: question when you see somebody holding a
1539.44s: coffee cup looks like Starbucks is this
1542.36s: a
1543.44s: SBS could yeah I think it could have
1545.84s: been for that photo yeah okay and then
1547.88s: what kind of coffee would we be
1549.56s: consuming is it what what's your flavor
1552.20s: just regular vanilla candy nice I dig
1556.96s: that and then I also saw old cars so
1561.12s: that's actually how I started in
1563.48s: automotives I used to restore old cars
1566.48s: with my uncle so it was mostly 56 57
1571.52s: Chevrolet belir
1575.12s: Nomad yeah 64 Stingray was one of the
1578.04s: first so cool yeah it's actually why I
1582.04s: have a C7 Stingray that's white is
1585.16s: because one of the first cars I worked
1586.52s: on was a white 64 Stingray with my uncle
1589.36s: but talk to me about your flavor in old
1592.44s: cars my dad was a Master Mechanic for
1595.24s: Nissan for a long time and then when he
1597.88s: left Nissan he opened up his own shop
1601.00s: and that was when I was in elementary
1602.24s: school so I remember getting off the bus
1603.72s: they would drop us off at his shop and
1605.68s: he didn't have it too long but he did
1607.68s: have this like shop where he would help
1609.52s: like you know people repair their cars
1611.24s: and whatever but we would always fix
1613.32s: cars like um so he's got an 86 Grand
1616.68s: National he's got a 68 uh rsss drag car
1620.44s: that we you know fixed up and we used to
1622.52s: race together like so we would always do
1624.84s: that we put together two 350 zxs like
1627.68s: one that had crashed in the front and
1629.08s: one that had crashed in the back and put
1631.04s: that together and that would have been
1632.16s: my high school car until we lent it to a
1634.28s: friend who wrapped it around a pole but
1636.76s: yeah it was insane it was insane it was
1638.96s: ridiculous it was so ugly it was red
1640.88s: with gold wheels but it had t-tops it
1642.72s: was like the that's literally perfect it
1646.48s: was it was a cool one so but it was uh
1648.44s: 86 350 ZX but so like I really truly
1652.32s: enjoy all cars I would love to build a
1655.04s: car I tell my kids all the time like at
1657.40s: some point dad is going to build a car
1658.92s: and I want you know you guys to kind of
1660.36s: like help with that process because
1661.40s: that's what we did like we like swapped
1662.84s: engines like we like all the time like
1665.36s: there were just cars kind of coming and
1667.12s: going in my house with my dad just
1668.64s: trying to like renovate them and you
1669.96s: know he would keep some and sell some
1671.56s: and whatever so um I'm partial to like
1673.96s: the muscle car area but I like the odd
1675.84s: stuff like the AMC's and the javelins
1678.36s: like some of those things that are just
1680.60s: like not run-of-the-mill stuff um all
1683.76s: the time yeah dude that's awesome yeah
1686.48s: it's I actually installed a lift in my
1689.12s: house so that I could work on yeah that
1691.92s: I could work on the Corvette dude yeah I
1695.16s: know I I literally I was thinking man
1697.16s: like how bougie have I become that I'm
1700.24s: like you know instead of using jack
1702.24s: stands and hoping that this thing
1703.80s: doesn't crush me that I'm now using a
1705.84s: lift but I tell you what man one of the
1707.52s: best inv you dude it'sit a neck saver
1710.20s: because if you get under a or do
1711.68s: anything like I feel like is like dead
1714.48s: you know that's so funny yeah and then
1717.68s: it's also really cool that you like some
1719.44s: of the odds and ends that's I ended up
1721.24s: grabbing uh McLaren 570s for that exact
1724.36s: reason because I never had a mid-engine
1727.00s: car before they look weird and I've
1730.92s: never all of my build cars have been
1732.96s: manuals and I've never really had a
1735.12s: automatic or paddle shift and I wanted
1737.04s: to mess with that and and it's
1739.64s: interesting because the technology
1742.48s: obviously in the newer cars is just wild
1746.52s: so when you're thinking about building a
1749.16s: that new Corvette that what the when
1751.44s: they just did like engine car like I got
1753.92s: a chance to drive one of those you know
1755.60s: that like traveling thing that does like
1757.20s: the drive like they go around the
1759.32s: racetracks and you can drive like five
1761.28s: cars so I my wife got that for me a
1763.08s: couple years ago I drove five cars I
1764.92s: drove one of those Corvettes and it was
1767.12s: insane because it has that dual clutch
1768.84s: where like it's right you don't even
1771.12s: feel it and it's it's bananas and um
1774.44s: yeah I so like those are all equally
1777.12s: it's cool I just get scared of any of
1779.64s: those things because I'm like I can't
1781.12s: fix that at all but like I can do a
1782.88s: carburetor and like like dude I the
1787.04s: first thing I did when I got the McLaren
1788.96s: was take it all apart I I took pictures
1791.08s: too just because I think it's novel to
1794.08s: buy a superar and then literally just
1795.92s: dismantle the whole thing so I but to
1798.88s: your point I actually have been blown
1801.52s: away with how straightforward a lot of
1805.16s: the McLaren is it actually is a much
1807.52s: more accessible engine bay in
1809.16s: transmission than my Corvette does which
1811.88s: is fascinating yeah absolutely
1814.04s: fascinating it's not what I was
1815.12s: expecting and it's also not what I saw
1816.96s: on the c8s the c8s is a different Beast
1820.04s: man like that they packed in everything
1823.60s: so you want to change the belt you got
1825.44s: to rip off the rear end dude I oh yes
1829.56s: that that becomes a massive massive
1831.64s: project honestly never driven of never
1833.92s: driven of McLaren but I've heard that
1836.60s: they're pretty fun so they're yeah
1839.08s: they're really really cool they have
1841.12s: electronic steering which is weird at
1844.16s: first when you're driving one of those
1846.72s: it's obviously you know a completely
1849.48s: different feedback mechanism so it feels
1852.36s: like every you're feeling everything so
1855.88s: the first couple times you drive them it
1857.64s: seems like you almost need an alignment
1859.20s: or something that the steering wheel is
1860.52s: so active but it's literally just the
1862.64s: car picking up everything on the road
1865.20s: and then when you take it to a track all
1866.84s: of a sudden it's not picking up all this
1869.04s: random road noise and it's fantastic
1871.72s: that's awesome yeah it's a blast that's
1874.24s: awesome so I got a couple questions from
1876.88s: folks that I'm going to relate to you
1879.80s: one of them is from a dude named Tyler
1882.08s: from X or Twitter or whatever the
1884.56s: I'm supposed to call it I don't know
1886.24s: sorry Daddy Elon just just let me me
1888.16s: know um and he I think I know your
1891.44s: answer to this already based on our
1893.48s: conversation so far but it's a good
1895.32s: question so they're asking what do you
1897.84s: what's your perspective on a mechanical
1900.64s: income trading Style versus
1903.12s: opportunistic discretionary trading
1905.48s: obviously different things but I thought
1907.20s: interesting question for you yeah I I
1909.92s: think that I think you should have both
1913.12s: right like I there's I think there's
1915.76s: there's a there's a universe where both
1918.28s: work out really well I think the
1921.00s: opportunistic discretionary thing is
1923.88s: super tough because I feel like that's
1925.60s: the hunter gather like mentality I mean
1928.08s: like even just look at what happened
1929.32s: like last week right like so Roy and
1931.60s: kitty or whatever came back gme was
1933.88s: pumping like everyone's like ah this is
1935.36s: our opportunity and piled into it now
1936.96s: it's crashed again I don't know you know
1938.24s: maybe it'll come back up but like unless
1940.32s: you're there waiting for that and you
1942.64s: and you don't even know when it's going
1943.72s: to happen or how far it's going to move
1945.60s: or whatever then you're kind of left
1947.88s: holding the bag all the time like there
1949.72s: has to be some component that needs to
1952.64s: be more strategic right and if you want
1955.44s: to do the opportunistic like opportunity
1958.08s: fund like keep some cash on hand for
1960.16s: things that come up certainly you should
1962.32s: do that you know like even the greatest
1964.60s: you know investors of all time like
1966.20s: Buffett keeps ridiculous amount of cash
1967.84s: on hand mostly for insurance but like he
1969.64s: keeps cash on hand for the fact that
1971.72s: like something could come up that he
1972.96s: would want to you know like purchase and
1974.92s: acquire and so I think you should have
1977.00s: both I think that most of it should be
1979.20s: like strategic mechanical trading that
1981.04s: like just takes advantage of things that
1982.84s: you want to trade otherwise it seems
1985.64s: like a lot of chasing your tail if that
1988.16s: yeah yeah I follow I I also agree with
1991.28s: you the way that I think about trading
1993.16s: stuff like that is I have kind of two
1994.80s: buckets the way I split out my portfolio
1996.68s: I have what I call a core allocation and
1998.44s: a speculative allocation so it actually
2000.84s: falls very similar in line to what
2002.68s: you're saying I also heard Warren
2004.96s: Buffett's latest statement and um their
2008.92s: their annual shareholders meeting which
2010.36s: is fascinating cuz somebody commented on
2012.44s: literally the billions of dollars of
2014.28s: cash they have and at one point he was
2016.88s: just like he had the best response he's
2019.08s: like I don't think anybody knows what to
2020.60s: do with a billion dollars like to invest
2022.92s: he's like do you know he's like because
2024.36s: we don't he's like we're literally we're
2026.92s: just finding opportunities as they come
2028.76s: he does know yeah yeah of course if they
2031.08s: if he did like I mean he's keeping a lot
2033.00s: of cash on hand for insurance anyway for
2034.64s: Flo but like I don't know like what what
2037.20s: would yeah like there has to be
2039.08s: something to it so and and a big part of
2041.36s: that he he brings up is kind of what a
2043.72s: lot of retail Traders I think take for
2045.48s: granted and to be clear retail Traders
2048.36s: we don't have many advantages but one of
2050.64s: them is the fact that we are small and
2054.04s: we can just enter and exit things
2055.72s: essentially at will which you mentioned
2057.32s: before whereas one of his comments was
2059.36s: like where do you go buy several billion
2062.16s: dollars of something to make it a
2063.68s: position that's meaningful enough for
2065.36s: them to even bother putting it on and
2068.52s: you essentially have liquidity where
2070.24s: you're not bidding yourself up the whole
2071.92s: time yeah size is an issue for sure I
2074.40s: think that you know like in the same
2076.12s: vein though I think that people can fall
2077.92s: into the Trap of thinking they should
2079.52s: trade all the garbage and junk and they
2081.88s: get railed by these wides spreads and
2084.08s: it's like why are you trading that like
2085.96s: is that the core position like because
2088.08s: you're doing 50% in some noname ticker
2090.92s: with a dollar widespread like you're
2093.40s: going to get taken to the shed you know
2095.20s: like there's I don't know there's
2096.60s: something to be said yes about like he
2098.04s: been at small but at the same time like
2099.72s: you should probably be playing in the
2101.04s: pools that are pretty liquid anyway so I
2103.84s: think exactly to your point there too
2105.96s: playing specifically in the pools that
2107.52s: are relative to your size and I think
2110.96s: that's another thing that I find with
2112.60s: retail Traders and I'm curious what
2114.40s: you're seeing from your side because you
2115.80s: interact with them from a different
2117.40s: perspective than I do where when I talk
2121.68s: to Traders about cost it seems like the
2125.24s: vast majority don't actually understand
2127.40s: the friction involved with trading and a
2130.28s: lot of people will be like oh well my
2131.56s: broker has no commissions and it's like
2133.68s: okay well that's what you see on the
2135.08s: front end but you understand right that
2139.12s: on the back end there is where you're
2141.40s: actually getting filled at and there's
2143.48s: where your ORD getting routed to those
2145.96s: kinds of things and I find Traders don't
2148.88s: really grasp the concept of the friction
2150.92s: involved what's your experience with
2153.64s: your audience which obviously I imagine
2155.76s: using Bots that's got to be a big part
2158.32s: of trading considerations is to make
2160.68s: sure that still it makes sense after
2162.64s: friction yeah I think that you know like
2165.32s: thank God commissions have come down
2167.12s: from where they were you know like
2169.44s: dollars yeah it's just it was ridiculous
2172.00s: and you know the funny part is is like
2173.96s: now and I did this in a presentation in
2176.24s: Florida recently it's like we're g to
2178.28s: get to a place where like and it's even
2180.48s: happening now like one broker charges
2182.20s: for phones like if you call and make a
2184.28s: trade like it actually costs you a lot
2185.80s: of money you know and it's like wait
2187.68s: like what that's customer service but
2189.12s: like they charge you money for it so
2190.92s: like I think commissions are going to
2193.20s: continue to compress uh of course and I
2196.00s: think you see a lot of brokers who are
2197.68s: at zero or near zero now they all still
2201.08s: make money on payment for order flow on
2202.80s: the back end you know like every one of
2205.20s: them right or let's say 99% of the
2208.00s: orders are payment for order flow that
2209.60s: are that are filtered through Citadel or
2211.40s: whoever right and so I know that people
2214.72s: know that that happens but be because
2216.88s: they don't see it right they don't they
2219.72s: don't think it happens but it happens
2221.48s: and so that's why I say like if you're
2223.72s: trading and you're trading in a 50 Cent
2226.28s: wide market like so what you get free
2229.16s: commissions like the market are just too
2231.56s: wide you know like you might as well be
2234.00s: giving that up anyway because that's
2235.24s: what you're doing like in and out and so
2237.88s: I think that is good yeah go ahead sorry
2240.56s: ju just a question on that specifically
2242.20s: CU I like you I actually really enjoy
2245.24s: teaching people and I just find it
2247.84s: really fulfilling but this is one of
2249.40s: those topics that I struggle to get
2251.88s: people to see because I think even if we
2255.24s: frame it like that it still doesn't hit
2258.12s: home and I don't know if you have a way
2260.36s: to cons like to help people see the
2263.56s: actual impact that that has on a system
2266.92s: I haven't found a good one that's why
2268.08s: I'm asking because I've tried to have
2269.84s: this conversation with people on Reddit
2271.96s: and different p and obviously reddit's
2273.60s: always a blast because that is the wild
2275.64s: west but a lot people just struggle to
2278.60s: see this idea of you know even bit ask
2282.24s: spread they don't understand that that
2284.96s: is essentially a cost of them doing
2287.16s: business I'm just curious have you found
2289.60s: a successful way to get this across to
2291.52s: people yeah one way we're trying right
2293.84s: now because I agree and like I this has
2296.04s: always been a thing that like a is hard
2297.80s: to quantify anyway because you can see
2299.60s: the bit ass spread you can filter by bit
2302.12s: you know things are tight but then like
2304.56s: quantifying that and and so one way that
2306.84s: we have tried to do it recently this is
2308.52s: actually like in the last two and a half
2311.44s: weeks we published this now like as part
2313.76s: of our options liquidity ranking we
2315.96s: calculate like a scalp on each contract
2319.08s: and it basically is taking like the bid
2321.64s: ass spread and slippage of the stock
2323.48s: times 100 you know shares whatever and
2325.60s: it tries to quantify it to like a number
2327.32s: of like how much a potential Market
2329.56s: maker is scalping on the spread you know
2331.64s: for like for each of those contracts so
2333.48s: if you look at like QQQ the scalp might
2335.60s: be like $1.36
2337.96s: and then you look at something like
2339.12s: Costco let me just pull up Costco and
2341.00s: Costco's scalp on each contract is and
2343.40s: again this is just the way we're
2344.36s: calculating it so may not be exactly
2346.68s: right obviously but like um this the
2348.92s: scalp on Costco is
2351.56s: $545 brother that's how much you're
2353.72s: losing just trading a contract of cost
2356.76s: now if you can make that up on the back
2357.96s: end I mean by all means like you know
2359.76s: knock it out of the park but like a lot
2361.40s: of people have really enjoyed that
2362.64s: because they kind of filter and and rank
2364.24s: by that now and I think that that we're
2366.56s: trying to like bring that more to like a
2368.88s: ground zero like this is the dollar
2370.72s: amount that it's costing you to trade
2372.28s: this just to even like just even look at
2374.20s: it it's five bucks to get in you know
2376.56s: and I think if people understood that
2378.88s: their decisions would be better now on
2380.84s: the complete opposite end to to tell you
2382.56s: the truth right like you do get these
2384.28s: people that are hardliners that are like
2385.68s: I'm only trading SPY and only spy and
2387.84s: only QQQ and whatever it's like well
2390.08s: that's not good either like that's like
2391.64s: drinking water all day and calling
2393.08s: yourself healthy like it's just not like
2395.00s: it's not going to work you know so yeah
2397.16s: yeah what what I try to at least one I
2400.72s: love that tool and that concept because
2402.96s: I also think and I'm you guys are super
2405.52s:  smart so I'm sure you're
2406.60s: thinking about this but from a consumer
2408.96s: standpoint if you put it in the sense of
2411.24s: like this is what the market maker is
2412.92s: making one it creates kind of this
2414.64s: common enemy thing which I know that's
2416.72s: not necessarily what you're trying to do
2417.88s: but it personalizes where the money is
2420.00s: going because a lot of people I just
2421.76s: think they don't grasp the movement of
2424.84s: that Capital which is really I think a
2427.44s: great way to frame it but the way I try
2431.28s: to encourage and I don't know if there's
2432.60s: anything you guys could ever integrate
2434.12s: into your tools but I try to integrate
2437.28s: for at least my audience in the way that
2439.48s: I look at this stuff is the spread as a
2441.88s: percentage of the price it just puts it
2443.88s: on a relative basis right so if you have
2445.76s: something that has a good spread spy
2447.72s: fine spy cool what is the percent spread
2452.16s: on that individual option that you're
2453.56s: looking at relative to the price and
2455.36s: carry that over to other things cuz
2456.92s: that's what do in a personal capacity
2459.24s: but anyways just another idea for you
2461.08s: guys yeah and we do that and the other
2462.96s: thing that we TR to do also is we try to
2465.32s: like a fill percentage like how far do
2467.76s: you have to move through the spread to
2470.04s: actually get a fill like is it are you
2472.64s: like filled at 50/50 like is it 50% of
2475.08s: the spread so like it's mostly filled at
2476.72s: midpoint or do you have to move 75% of
2479.56s: the way through the spread so now it's
2481.04s: like okay like double quantifying it
2483.00s: like the spread super wide plus like the
2485.04s: average fill and because we can track
2486.80s: and see the fills right like we can run
2488.88s: these numbers and metrics on all these
2490.48s: all these tickers and see like oh these
2493.44s: tickers like they fill most often at Mid
2496.24s: price whereas these tickers they fill
2498.76s: usually towards the further extremes
2501.24s: right and then you can say ah okay like
2503.60s: now I know like maybe I should be
2504.96s: focusing or at least just know like have
2506.80s: an awareness yeah so yeah yeah that's
2509.60s: absolutely awesome well another thing
2511.48s: and I'm actually curious what you think
2512.72s: about this you're probably closer to
2514.08s: these topics than I am but I'm still
2516.64s: trying to figure out out why SPX moves
2518.96s: at a nickel because I trade SPX all the
2522.00s: time and that is insanely frustrating
2526.00s: because I understood the origin of it
2528.00s: but I feel like that would be nice to
2530.48s: change and listen we have a petition
2532.64s: going to try and change it I don't think
2534.84s: change yeah seriously we've had a
2536.28s: petition going for quite some time now
2538.92s: it's the only product that really does
2540.48s: that like on a mass scale right there's
2542.60s: other products do it but um we've
2544.76s: literally had conversations with the
2546.76s: guys over there at sibo and like we know
2549.24s: like that they're just like look it it
2550.72s: is what it is and we've done that and
2552.68s: you know they're kind of like we wish we
2554.24s: could change it too and like go back I'm
2556.36s: sure you guys wish it's so integrated
2559.12s: now at that point that yeah I just don't
2561.76s: under I mean I understand why they do it
2563.68s: it's just like a sizing thing but yeah
2565.92s: it's in the ass honestly so that that
2568.80s: one's yeah that really gets the old go
2571.60s: really pisses me off I don't like that
2573.08s: one yeah yeah us too I mean like we
2575.08s: don't even support SPX because of it
2576.88s: like it's the only ticker that would
2579.24s: literally break all of our algorithms
2581.00s: that are built on like Penny wide
2582.80s: increments and Penny wide orders so I
2585.20s: see yeah that's actually another
2587.20s: question
2588.60s: from I think this one was from Reddit
2590.84s: but they were asking if you guys are
2592.12s: going to do a mobile app yes we are
2595.24s: trying to hire a mobile app developer uh
2597.60s: developer we almost had an acquisition
2600.08s: hire um and then they backed out at the
2602.20s: last M moment but yeah we are like balls
2606.16s: to the wall trying to figure out how to
2607.72s: do a mobile app um I think that it will
2610.12s: be it'll be interesting because a lot of
2611.72s: people I think will still want to build
2614.84s: Bots purely on desktop right so I think
2617.72s: it will be something that the mobile app
2619.96s: is going to be more of like a management
2622.04s: you know database right where you can
2623.80s: manage turn off turn on of course enter
2626.12s: positions and do trade ideas but the
2628.52s: actual mechanics of building out Bots
2630.44s: and doing the decision trees and you
2632.24s: know the flow of like if this then that
2634.64s: Etc like that will probably still be on
2636.56s: desktop I just don't think you could fit
2638.20s: it intelligently into Mobile app so but
2641.28s: yeah we're trying to go down that path
2643.56s: yeah it's it's interesting to to think
2645.88s: about like the migration of the
2647.48s: technology I am a just so ignorant with
2651.80s: all of it but I have a buddy that works
2654.64s: on this stuff and he explains a lot of
2657.76s: the migration of things from desktop
2660.40s: interfaces to mobile app so yes yeah
2664.96s: which is really because I I think a lot
2666.56s: of people look at it as oh well you
2668.16s: already have it just move it over and
2670.16s: it's kind of like no you literally have
2671.44s: to like essentially build it again you
2672.84s: get to leverage a lot of it but yeah
2675.32s: yeah we try to do a lot of mobile first
2677.32s: things on like the website anyway but
2678.92s: like it really needs a true mobile app
2680.72s: that like is mobile native so yeah yeah
2683.80s: well cool thanks for at least a little
2685.68s: bit of details on that you mentioned a
2688.56s: couple times that I want to key into we
2690.48s: agree on a lot of things so I want to
2692.04s: dive into something I think we don't
2693.32s: agree on um it sounds like you mentioned
2697.12s: like a neutral focus in trading why
2699.24s: neutral for you yeah so I think there's
2702.36s: this let me see if I could pull it up I
2705.20s: don't even know I don't want to like go
2706.72s: through like the presentation and share
2708.12s: it but like let me try to describe it
2709.52s: because I think it might help out but if
2711.96s: you got into a position and let's say
2713.88s: you were bullish on like let's say you
2715.80s: were bullish on a stock right and you
2717.72s: sold a short put spread and and we we go
2721.60s: under the assumption that like this is
2723.28s: not your only position right like you
2725.76s: maybe want to have a couple positions
2727.44s: call it three four positions whatever it
2729.76s: is I believe that you should try to keep
2733.60s: a new like be working towards a neutral
2736.24s: stance and that's not because I think
2739.08s: all your positions should be neutral
2740.64s: because I don't but I think what you
2742.12s: should be working towards is like a
2743.60s: neutral non-directional stance because
2745.84s: if you purely make money and like your
2748.88s: strategies are set up to only make money
2750.72s: in One Direction that makes it
2752.60s: increasingly harder to make money in
2755.16s: various market conditions so like what I
2757.36s: try to do personally is like I don't
2759.28s: care where the market goes because I
2761.00s: will let my bots adjust for if the
2763.36s: market goes up I will let them
2765.00s: self-correct and self- adjust to sell
2767.76s: different strategies than other
2769.12s: strategies and if the market goes down
2770.48s: they'll self-correct and sell other
2772.12s: strategies versus others because I just
2774.12s: want to be continuously working towards
2775.68s: neutral so again so go circleing back
2777.28s: around real quick so if you sell a put
2778.84s: spread and you're bullish on a stock but
2781.16s: as soon as you sell that put spread the
2782.60s: stock tanks right the natural inclin
2785.48s: which usually happens right happens to
2788.20s: everybody right really good analysis get
2791.88s: the position 15 minutes later it's down
2794.48s: perfect so so now your your position is
2797.48s: challenged right and so if you say like
2800.40s: if you don't agree with the idea of
2802.96s: trying to work towards neutral then what
2805.28s: you might do is you might sell another
2807.04s: put spread right you might think to
2808.44s: yourself well like if I liked it at 150
2810.96s: right I'll love it at 50 whole like
2813.96s: mentality and then the stock continues
2816.04s: to go down right so now you're in a
2818.32s: position where you're digging yourself
2820.32s: deeper and deeper and deeper into a hole
2823.36s: and the thing that really kills Traders
2826.40s: is running out of capital obviously like
2829.28s: if you can't if you run out of capital
2830.76s: you can't keep the lights on but like
2832.28s: digging yourself into a hole that's so
2834.32s: deep that it's almost impossible to get
2836.72s: out right we've all seen the charts of
2838.44s: like if you lose 10% you got to make a
2840.80s: 11 12 11% to get back to square one
2843.56s: whatever so like your goal is not to dig
2845.88s: yourself into a insanely deep hole right
2850.08s: and so if you're a Trader and you have a
2852.28s: bad sequence of Trades which is going to
2854.52s: happen everybody where the Market's just
2855.96s: going to be irrational right yes that's
2858.40s: a good one do you have it on your blog
2859.88s: yeah yeah that's for it's that exact
2863.16s: reason yeah lost recovery right exactly
2865.60s: yeah like a 30% draw down is yeah like
2868.32s: that's tough but like manageable you
2870.28s: lose 60 70% like good luck like you're
2873.32s: going to be climbing that road again for
2874.88s: another couple years and I just think
2876.08s: people give up at that point so if you
2878.44s: do that trade and then you do another
2880.36s: trade and let's say you even do a third
2882.48s: trade and you're like there's no way the
2884.44s: Market's going down like I can't even
2886.80s: handle and then you start praying and
2888.36s: then you start like you know doing
2890.08s: seances and you start like
2892.52s: rubbing yeah you start doing everything
2895.16s: right and you start doing that and then
2896.64s: of course the stock continues to go to
2898.16s: now you have this massive losing streak
2900.28s: and you have this massive draw down so
2902.40s: the alternative view is to do things
2905.12s: that are opposing generally opposing to
2907.48s: where the the normal portfolio is
2909.36s: balanced so if your portfolio is from
2911.92s: the initial position is bullish right
2914.00s: like that's your initial position then
2916.04s: the market goes down well like why not
2918.12s: add a call spread now it it's not going
2920.08s: to change the fact that you'll probably
2921.36s: lose on the put spread but like don't
2923.48s: dig yourself deeper into a hole so like
2925.40s: now if you had a call spread and say
2926.68s: converted to an iron Condor to use very
2928.56s: like a simple idea now you've given
2930.64s: yourself an opportunity not necessarily
2932.96s: to like recover everything though though
2935.48s: maybe you can but now you're just not
2937.44s: going to dig yourself into a hole like
2938.88s: you're going to kind of work with where
2940.24s: the market goes so the market goes down
2942.44s: again right another leg down well your
2944.76s: call spread made money your put spread
2946.80s: lost the same amount of money you were
2948.04s: going to lose anyway now you sell
2949.76s: another call spread right and the market
2951.52s: goes down again right and now you have
2953.92s: two call spreads that made money and
2955.92s: those might have overcome the loss from
2957.80s: the put spread at least you're you're
2959.20s: back to square one right so the idea is
2961.84s: like don't get yourself into a bad
2963.60s: sequence of Trades by just trading one
2966.04s: directional if you can get to a level
2969.00s: where you're working towards neutral
2971.12s: that doesn't mean you have to be
2972.24s: perfectly like it's impossible to be
2974.76s: Delta zero like it's just it's it's
2976.88s: impossible because the markets move too
2978.32s: fast like if you're Delta zero you're
2979.96s: Delta zero for a fraction of a second
2981.72s: then the market moves and so if you're
2984.24s: working towards neutral that's just
2985.96s: having an understanding of like I have a
2988.04s: crap ton of bullish positions like even
2990.76s: though maybe I really really like the
2992.20s: market like the smart thing is to maybe
2994.20s: get some bearish positions or remove
2996.12s: some of those bullish positions so
2998.96s: interesting yeah so it sounds almost
3000.52s: like you're using like a beta weighted
3002.12s: Deltas to then assess overall portfolio
3004.80s: disposition and then trying to offset
3006.56s: slightly yeah and so you can do that so
3009.52s: like we can do that you can do that
3011.12s: inside of a bot you can do that with
3012.40s: positions and so like my bots are set up
3014.52s: to look at the beta exposure of the
3016.44s: collective of positions that the bot has
3019.20s: and then based on that beta exposure
3021.16s: like if I'm bearish or bullish it will
3023.24s: then add a position and sometimes it'll
3025.56s: add a neutral position like if it's not
3027.16s: too far out of bounds like if my Beta
3029.52s: exposure is not insanely bullish not
3031.52s: insanely bearish okay great grab a
3033.16s: neutral really wide you know sweet
3035.80s: position but I just don't think people
3037.92s: really think about that and they find
3039.68s: themselves dug into a hole where they
3042.28s: have six seven eight losses in a row
3044.40s: when the market turns and they got
3045.92s: unlucky and that's hard to recover for
3048.56s: them so and you know the best part about
3050.72s: that story is that as soon as they
3052.20s: liquidate all of their losers the right
3055.96s: yes yep good yeah that's sounds exact
3059.16s: yeah that's why I don't even eat their
3060.92s: burritos anymore it scarred me for life
3063.04s: it's so funny to me how Universal some
3065.16s: of these experiences are you have to go
3068.16s: like you have to go that's why I feel I
3070.16s: feel do feel bad for people who are
3071.72s: trading right now in the sense of like
3073.72s: there's a there's an overwhelming sense
3075.52s: of like non like this completely risk
3078.56s: averse Universe you know like vix was
3081.00s: back under 12 today right and people I
3084.44s: just feel like are insanely
3087.24s: levered to One Direction and it theity
3091.32s: like I can see like some stats of like
3094.40s: what people are doing because they share
3095.64s: Bots and templates and stuff but like I
3098.00s: just I I don't know I get this feeling
3099.84s: like people are insane like I had a Budd
3101.16s: text me about a penny sock and I'm like
3102.80s: oh my God we gotta be CL here we go yeah
3105.32s: like you know like he's like no they say
3106.96s: it's going to like $6 dollar and I'm
3108.68s: like oh we're close like always I always
3111.28s: love it when the good old they say love
3113.60s: it when they say yeah he literally texts
3116.28s: me last week he's you know good friend
3118.76s: like family friend of ours like and I
3120.84s: don't think he understands options or
3122.08s: markets or whatever and he's like so if
3123.48s: he's thinking about penny stocks like we
3124.84s: got to be close so that's awesome yeah
3127.64s: well I mean it's really interesting just
3129.52s: to hear the way you think about like
3131.36s: broader portfolio Theory CU it sounds it
3134.16s: sounds like I always consider myself
3136.08s: risk averse but it actually sounds like
3137.68s: you might be slightly more risk averse
3139.64s: than I am is your kind of long cuz and
3143.20s: to be clear I typically maintain a
3146.04s: relative light book but I have a
3148.48s: moderate compound annual growth rate so
3150.28s: from 2007 to 2023 I just Ted over a 26%
3154.64s: compound annual growth rate so it's
3157.00s: solid and consistent but it's not like
3159.56s: us investing Championship level where
3161.36s: I'm returning 300% but my Approach has
3164.80s: been it sounds like a little more risk
3167.08s: open though than your approach might be
3170.12s: it because if from my experience if you
3172.48s: have positions that offset too much then
3175.84s: we've away our profit potential so do
3178.88s: you tend to set like a threshold where
3181.04s: you're like if I have number of beta
3183.20s: weighted Deltas or just overall Deltas I
3185.92s: want to maintain a short flow of a
3187.84s: percentage of that kind of like a that
3189.96s: kind of thing yeah I think that's that's
3191.24s: the challenge and that to be honest like
3193.36s: that was a challenge and still to some
3195.36s: degree is a challenge to a little bit
3197.00s: with like Bots because Bots can't do
3200.08s: that to that c like that level of degree
3202.64s: like we can calculate like a beta
3204.12s: exposure but like we don't know in
3206.48s: unless you look at them and you're like
3207.84s: monitoring them if like you just added a
3210.16s: position that maybe offset exactly
3212.32s: another position right I see now you're
3214.68s: like stomping on toes so like we have
3216.12s: some technology that's like avoid like
3218.08s: leg stomping and identical positions or
3220.32s: inverse positions and stuff but but
3222.56s: there's a certain degree of like yeah
3224.04s: you don't want to just you know like
3225.60s: sell a dollar and buy a dollar in the
3227.28s: same thing like you just wasted a bunch
3228.84s: of time and effort and money so I think
3231.04s: that for me like my range is like a 1%
3234.24s: beta exposure on like a 30-day basis so
3236.72s: if I get like 1% out of bounds but
3238.96s: that's just for me like where the market
3240.80s: goes up and I lose 1% in 30 days like
3243.48s: that's too far one directional so if I'm
3245.68s: inside that range that's enough exposure
3248.12s: for me like but other people are
3249.68s: insanely they're like five 10 15 like
3252.00s: people have huge swings and like I've
3254.12s: never been able to stomach that ever
3255.88s: like again like my childhood was like
3257.88s: wild swings and volatility from my
3259.92s: parents and their finances there's no
3261.96s: way I want to have that now so it's
3264.16s: funny you say that because that's
3265.24s: actually a big part of why consider at
3267.48s: least the way that I trade also to be
3268.88s: pretty risk averse because I grew up
3270.16s: poor and I had a single mom that I'm
3271.88s: actually taking care of now so I always
3274.04s: view like the growth of capital is is
3276.00s: quite literally like a a livelihood
3277.76s: necessity so it's interesting that you
3280.28s: mention that cuz slightly different
3282.24s: Genesis but a similar output where I'm
3285.00s: not looking for a 40% portfolio swing at
3287.20s: this I think that I definitely have a
3291.12s: little bit more of caution to the
3292.72s: downside not in terms of downside
3294.76s: movement I actually make some of my my
3296.76s: best years during markets but yeah but
3300.48s: definitely portfolio variant so
3303.28s: interesting we're coming up on time here
3305.08s: you have a game that you have to get
3306.04s: over to but I have to ask when you look
3309.44s: over the next call it 3 to five years of
3312.64s: options markets we've both seen a bit of
3316.00s: an evolution so far right so we've gone
3318.64s: from standard expirations to weekly to
3321.40s: Dailies to zero DTE that's moved over
3323.68s: now to iwm like we're seeing this
3326.00s: progress ression of options markets when
3329.52s: you look out over the next again 3 to 5
3331.92s: years something like that what are some
3333.52s: of the things that you expect to happen
3336.04s: within the industry I think that what
3338.52s: you're seeing is you're seeing latency
3340.24s: collapse right so like that's been a
3341.92s: trend that's like continued where like
3343.88s: things are priced so fast right and now
3347.12s: you have this like this trend with AI
3351.36s: where it's not that AI is trading
3353.96s: necessarily but it's like what AI is
3356.36s: doing to things that get traded so what
3358.72s: was it a couple months ago that uh lift
3360.96s: came out and there was a typo in their
3362.68s: thing and the stock was up crazy from a
3365.36s: typo right and you got to think like
3367.80s: something read that and then made a
3370.12s: decision and so that Trend I think will
3373.20s: accelerate where you're GNA get like
3375.52s: latency is almost zero like so there's
3378.68s: no room for a human to decipher things
3381.28s: to a certain degree so like what does
3383.16s: that world look like now where like as a
3385.12s: Trader there's zero latency between
3387.32s: information and like market movement
3389.36s: right that looks like a really volatile
3392.12s: world where people are moving in and out
3394.04s: of Securities very fast again like I
3395.92s: said like if you want if you wanted to
3398.24s: 20 years ago like move Capital like it
3400.80s: probably took a little bit of time even
3403.00s: now it probably takes some time like if
3405.12s: you want to move brokerage accounts like
3406.76s: that takes time if you want to get out
3408.08s: of positions you got t plus three
3409.76s: settlement like whatever that's going to
3411.88s: collapse and like so when you're going
3413.20s: to see is you're going to see people
3414.60s: moving in and out of things faster which
3416.52s: means things are going to be way more
3417.88s: volatile probably than they've ever been
3420.44s: right like we're going to get to a
3421.40s: period where things are really volatile
3423.76s: and so in that world you have to be like
3426.92s: either a sitting there waiting for it or
3429.16s: have something that sits there and waits
3430.96s: for it and watches it for you because
3432.84s: there's no latency and capital is moving
3435.04s: faster and I do think that we will get
3437.80s: to a place where we get a
3439.92s: 24-hour options market and that is in
3443.60s: should be insanely scary for a lot of
3445.28s: Traders because
3446.72s: imagine how quickly an entire Market can
3449.60s: get pushed in the middle of the night I
3452.00s: mean like look at gme like gme somebody
3454.80s: came back on Twitter and gme was up
3457.04s: right like imagine what a real
3460.04s: conglomerate of funds or Bad actors or
3462.08s: whatever good actors or just people
3463.96s: could do to a security overnight while
3466.96s: you're sleeping as the Market's trading
3469.32s: and you get a margin call notice in the
3472.28s: middle of the night and you have to fund
3474.08s: it by 9:00 a.m. and you don't even know
3476.32s: because you slept in and now they
3477.88s: liquidate at the worst possible price
3479.60s: and you're gone like that world I
3482.44s: believe is coming like I think it's
3483.76s: going to be 24 hours 247 245 markets for
3487.80s: options trading and that that's a that's
3490.04s: a world that if you're not prepared for
3491.72s: that I think it's going to be there's
3493.60s: going to be some bad stories so it's
3496.16s: interesting I I definitely see parts of
3498.40s: that I think some of the Counterpoint I
3499.88s: would offer is we already have Futures
3501.72s: that trade most of the time and we're
3503.52s: not necessarily seeing that kind of
3505.20s: volatility but but they're also way
3507.68s: larger way more liquid so smaller
3509.60s: individual stocks that might be trading
3511.24s: like that I can absolutely see that
3513.40s: happening too so we'll have to see if it
3515.64s: comes to fru at the same time like you
3517.60s: know like that time when like crude oil
3519.60s: went negative right like at physical
3522.68s: crude oil went negative and you were
3524.04s: getting paid to take crude oil because
3525.80s: it was so crazy like no one ever thought
3527.68s: that was gonna happen and so like that
3530.12s: kind of stuff if that happens it could
3532.04s: wipe out an entire generation of Traders
3534.48s: and so that's what I guess like it's
3536.92s: very interesting to have 24-hour markets
3539.32s: but I think as we go and as markets
3541.76s: start to evolve and become faster and
3543.76s: things get read by Ai and then they get
3545.52s: traded like that's a really different
3548.04s: world you know and I don't know if
3549.96s: people are yeah and I mean I especially
3552.88s: agree with the the trading time frames
3556.80s: and windows like that does add a certain
3559.64s: level of risk and complexity but I
3561.52s: actually think your other point
3563.16s: highlighting the integration of AI again
3565.88s: it such a buzzword now I almost hate
3567.96s: saying it but it's it is a thing man and
3571.04s: like you're talking about stupid it's
3573.12s: stupid in the it's not like I I agree

3576.96s: guys on our team is like Wicked smart
3578.64s: Rob he's like the smartest human I know
3580.72s: honestly and he put it the best way to
3582.56s: me he's like AI is stupid because all
3585.08s: it's really doing right now is it's
3587.48s: trying to predict the next word in a
3589.00s: series of strings of words and that's it
3590.88s: like it's not right so you could trick
3593.52s: it to do anything you want to a certain
3595.24s: degree by priming it and but it will get
3597.28s: better right like it'll start to figure
3599.00s: out these things but if it can misread a
3601.44s: like you know 10q like then we've got
