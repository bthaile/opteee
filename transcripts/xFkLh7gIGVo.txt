0.00s: What's up outliers?
2.76s: Welcome back to the Outlier podcast.
5.08s: We have a very familiar green chicken coming to hang out with us and talk to us really about
11.84s: the world.
13.00s: But there's a few things that are really high on my agenda with you before we get into
18.64s: details.
19.64s: Always below Dumburg and friends.
21.44s: Could to see you all things for coming back and hanging out for a bit.
23.84s: Eric, always a pleasure to talk to you.
25.88s: We've just shot it before you hit record about your growth and success, congratulations.
29.96s: Well, deserved.
30.96s: I appreciate it.
32.60s: I think that's a very generous take, but I appreciate the sentiment.
41.24s: Speaking of growth, I actually figure that's a perfect place to start because throughout
48.80s: this year, at least from my lens, more of a trader lens, there's a lot of broad themes
54.64s: that I noticed, expanded and then some kind of fizzled out into nothing.
60.96s: If you were to look back over the years so far, understand that there's still a month left
65.24s: today's one December, but if you were to look back, what are some of the themes this
69.76s: year that you really think grew in scope and really gained steam?
75.16s: Yeah, it's fascinating time to be an observer and in your case probably more so than
80.36s: us at least in a public markets in participant.
83.88s: I think obviously 2025 is the year of the AI arc and the whispers of a bubble in the public
91.52s: markets.
93.48s: We participate in the private markets.
95.92s: We happen to be founding investors in a small AI startup and that we're heavily involved
100.60s: with.
101.60s: And we see what's going on in the private markets.
103.60s: It is, we've lived and invested privately in many mani-manias and this is certainly
110.32s: a mania.
111.32s: It doesn't mean that the world isn't going to radically change because of AI or that huge
116.88s: amounts of money can't be made during a mania, but all good traders would know you have
122.12s: to know when to leave the dance floor.
125.60s: Our whole philosophy is to build businesses you're proud to own and if somebody comes
129.72s: along and wants to overpay for it, then you hit the bid.
133.16s: Just like if your own stocks that you're happy to own and if it rises too high, maybe
137.04s: you shave a little bit off.
139.24s: So the arc of AI has been fascinating.
141.04s: We sort of had a little bit of the air come out of the balloon here.
144.12s: I would say, you know, what's thinking forward for 2026, the continuation of that arc,
150.16s: a lot of smoke around in video, Eric.
153.20s: A lot of questions being asked.
154.20s: You know, any time a company is writing a memo to sell side analysts explaining that
159.08s: it's not an end-around fraud.
161.68s: Broadly speaking, that's a bit of an issue.
164.08s: The other arc, of course, has been the crypto arc.
167.32s: I think a big story is the Michael Sailor situation and his financial engineering.
174.36s: Some interesting investing opportunities there, I think.
177.36s: These perverts that pay 10, 10 and a half percent look pretty interesting in a falling
184.32s: interest rate environment.
186.24s: But of course, the fact that finally, and I think correctly, the equity stack itself is
192.52s: traded below NAV is probably the market doing what the market does.
201.56s: It is a fascinating concept.
202.88s: What he's trying to do, it seems highly flawed to us.
205.48s: I mean, signing up for perpetual delusion of the equity stack.
210.20s: I mean, in the long run, that's a zero because all the Bitcoin goes for the perverts into
214.04s: the bondholders and less Bitcoin moons.
216.84s: So I mean, at least he's totally transparent about it.
219.84s: And as wonderful disclosure, everything is about the books.
222.72s: There's no, I don't think there's any fraud going on there.
225.76s: But the Michael Sailor story and Jim Chano's shorting it and going long, the classics
232.06s: sort of arbitrage trade going long, Bitcoin, I believe he did.
236.24s: Kind of a bit of an interesting one.
238.48s: For us, then, the recent weakness in crypto as we end the year, coinciding with the
244.08s: weakness in AI, has a bit of late 2007 type field.
249.80s: That's what we're talking about.
250.80s: And for being honest, the last sort of big bubble that we can remember.
254.04s: So those are the two big arcs on the energy side.
256.36s: I think as we correctly predicted, all as well, all as calm, the long term real price
263.36s: of all commodities is lower.
265.88s: And we did now that Canada currently call pretty good, we're publishing on that on Wednesday
269.40s: a little follow up.
270.40s: Maybe a slight victory lap and then a future set of predictions about Canadian energy
273.88s: as well.
277.32s: We'll clicking into the AI arc and more specifically the context of a bubble.
287.00s: It's really easy to, well, people tend to get nervy near market tops, even though the
292.08s: market spends the majority of its time within, you know, 5% of all-time highs.
299.40s: How do you analyze like a true bubble and put your finger on it as, I don't just think
305.72s: that this is in most periods, you forriya aggressive growth, but like I actually think that
310.64s: this is a bubble.
312.44s: Well, there's always a bubble somewhere.
314.64s: It's just human nature.
317.12s: So our whole philosophy is don't try to short them, learn that the hard way, right?
321.76s: Don't try to fade them.
323.76s: Stick your hand out and grab some of the money, you know, it's some of the best private
328.28s: investments we've made fed into the SPAC boom.
332.16s: My meant SPAC boom was a little bit bubble.
334.24s: It was a bit of a free money machine for a while because you could raise this money and
341.84s: pay people interest and put it in T-Bills and then if you found your deal, you found your
346.24s: deal.
347.24s: So our whole general philosophy is to build businesses your happy own because they cash
352.24s: flow.
354.12s: And then if a SPAC boom comes along and somebody wants to take something public at a ridiculous
358.52s: price, well, you let it.
361.36s: That's the private markets.
363.32s: Now, the public markets side of things.
367.52s: When you, you know, we don't participate all that much in the public markets, I have a small
373.60s: yellow account that I occasionally, you know, do a little bit of action and I'll talk
378.24s: about that maybe offline at some point.
380.64s: But nothing major, you know, it's totally material compared to say the size of the
384.48s: do-per-business and how important that is to us.
387.64s: And by the way, we would never invest in things that we're writing about and if we did,
390.36s: we would disclose it.
391.28s: So if you just go back and look at the 25 year chart of the NASDAQ, there's lots of bubbles
401.32s: between them and now and look at the chart.
404.96s: So timing bubbles, you know, if I was forced to be in the public markets, I would just
410.04s: dollar cost average in and, you know, reinvest the dividends by a mix of, you know, reasonable
417.00s: companies and dividends stocks and some growth stocks and Senate and forget it.
420.80s: Unless you're an skilled trader, very difficult to time the markets and trading is different
426.72s: from investing.
427.72s: Of course, as you know, better than anybody trading, as we were just, again, talking about
431.28s: before we hit, Gord was, is a combination of developing an edge and excellent bankroll management.
437.92s: You know, it doesn't take much of an edge in the casino to make money, which is why
442.00s: card counting is illegal.
444.00s: But even then, when you're counting cards, you still have to manage your bankroll properly
447.32s: and the house, of course, has an infinite bankroll and you don't.
449.88s: And so draw down risk, you know, sometimes you just get a run of ad lock no matter how
454.56s: good the odds are against you or for you.
457.60s: And so trading is a skill.
459.76s: I do believe, for example, that people can successfully trade for a living, people do
465.48s: it.
466.48s: It takes a special mindset.
467.80s: I personally don't have it.
469.48s: I could tell you what my two failure modes as a trader are if you're interested.
474.88s: One is I'm a hunch and buncher.
477.32s: So I think I have a reasonable edge and I put too much on.
479.64s: And then the other is I just watch bad bets die, slowly.
483.24s: And I'm not good enough yet at cutting those losses too quickly.
486.88s: But I know that.
488.12s: Yeah, I know that about myself.
490.00s: And so, you know, only takes so many significant losses in your life to realize that maybe
495.40s: you should try to do something else.
496.56s: Like what you're good at, like build a business.
498.36s: And so that's what I do with my time.
501.20s: I think it makes obviously a lot of sense, especially the self-waring aside of it.
505.36s: Yeah, trading is fascinating to fascinating thing.
509.00s: But I mean, look, I can't fully give it up.
511.96s: I mean, it's kind of fun.
513.16s: It's nothing like the euphoria of a quick double on a call option or, you know, but
518.76s: at the same time, you can't convince yourself that your genius and you should do this
521.60s: for living either unless you have a strong track record.
524.72s: Look, I mean, intellectually understand what needs to happen.
528.64s: Translation of that knowledge into emotional execution as we're 99% of the people who
533.84s: can't make it go of it.
534.84s: Failed.
535.84s: And I'm in that crowd.
538.36s: I'm still glad you got the yellow account.
539.96s: That makes me happy by itself.
541.16s: So that's good.
542.16s: Yeah, I'll not tell you some stats have been fun.
543.96s: Let's just say the sharp ratio on that is very low, even though the regency is great.
548.44s: Because the volatility is pretty high.
551.72s: But the fun ratio.
553.12s: Yeah, I mean, it was an account that I found that had a couple of thousandth.
556.28s: But I actually forgot existed and I just been yellow trading it up.
558.88s: I got it very high.
559.88s: It came back down low now.
560.88s: It's in a good spot again.
561.88s: You know, speaking of getting super high and coming back down, you mentioned Michael
568.92s: Sailor and MSTR, which has been really something to watch.
575.56s: And I'm near positive that you guys have a better handle on it than I do.
581.32s: It is when I look at it, I really do get this genuinely feels like a Ponzi scheme
587.88s: thing going on.
589.56s: And it's not maybe directly, but it's not a Ponzi scheme because a Ponzi scheme
597.88s: involves sub to future and fraud.
601.76s: And I don't believe that Sailor is engaging in either of those or certain elements.
607.96s: And he has widely disclosed exactly what he's doing, which is essentially a leverbed
612.88s: on the price of Bitcoin.
615.80s: And I'll openly sacrifice in the equity stack to do it, which is the bizarre part.
619.64s: So what do I mean by that?
621.60s: If you pull up your Bloomberg and you type MSTR, F8, CAST, and you get their cap table, you
628.80s: see there's a Ponzi bonds that are ahead of the equity in line.
632.08s: Now there's a Ponzi preferred that are ahead of the equity in line.
635.28s: Just on those bonds needs to be paid.
637.12s: Microsoft itself doesn't really cash flow the company, whatever it does, who knows what it
641.68s: does.
642.68s: So you want to micro-stradig your A.
644.68s: Sorry, micro-stradig, what did I say?
646.56s: I heard Microsoft, but my name has been probably.
649.08s: No, it's probably me.
650.68s: So micro-stradig, it doesn't cash flow.
652.24s: It's software business doesn't really cash flow.
654.44s: Certainly not compared to the volume of liabilities that are accumulating on the balance.
659.04s: She now on the other side of the balance sheet are the assets that are being procured
663.00s: with the newly issued debt and preferred stock preferred stock.
666.20s: You could think of it as basically debt.
669.20s: The problem with this approach, leveraging your balance sheet to acquire an asset is this
674.12s: asset doesn't cash flow.
676.56s: So the only way in which this debt can be repaid if it has to be, if you can't be refinanced,
684.80s: is to new stock.
687.00s: More patchly, especially with the preferred stock.
690.20s: If you read the fine print, they could stop declaring dividends, but those things accumulate
694.00s: and they could pay them in stock.
696.00s: All the various instruments have different rules and nitty-gritty that will come into play
701.68s: eventually.
703.48s: But if you just dilute for whatever, you end up with what I call the A and C situation,
712.20s: the movie theater company, Adam Aaron, famous CEO.
716.96s: So what I'm saying is he has told his and Bob away the equity.
724.96s: He's printing shares to service the massive debt problem what he should have done was declared
730.92s: bankruptcy, recat lies and come out as a concern.
733.52s: He's not choosing to do that because he says any value of the equity above zero's worth
738.52s: staying public for, but you're destroying huge amounts of shareholder value in the process.
743.60s: So not zero is indistinguishable from zero with a big enough number and the denominator.
748.08s: And if you just look at the numbers, shares outstanding for A and C, that number is huge.
754.28s: It's literally many, many, many, many multiples of what it was before COVID.
761.00s: When you capture all the delusions and ten-for-one splits and all that other stuff.
765.04s: So Michael Seller in a slower way is doing the exact same thing to micro strategy stock,
770.80s: which is at the money just did a $1.4 billion buffer that he claims will get him 21 months
777.56s: of interest and dividends for his debt stack.
781.84s: Okay.
782.84s: So 1.4 billion of delusion every 21 months now, we know.
786.56s: Right.
787.56s: So not only do these, the holders of these instruments stand senior to the common in the case
795.60s: of a liquidation.
799.04s: They also basically can wipe out the company, if it can't wipe out the equity, if it can't
804.28s: afford to pay its debt.
805.76s: So they can take it bankrupt.
806.76s: And then you'll get, if you're lucky, some of the Bitcoin value that's left over assuming
811.96s: that the liquidation of micro strategy would encourage the price of Bitcoin.
816.56s: And so it's a risky thing.
817.76s: There's not a Ponzi.
819.76s: It's very well disclosed.
822.04s: He is making a leverage bet on the price of Bitcoin and if Bitcoin goes to the moon, he's fine.
826.92s: This is exactly what people who are investing in him want.
830.60s: It is unbelievably well disclosed.
833.56s: And so there you have it.
835.20s: Didn't not zero.
836.20s: He's going to run the equity AMC style to quote not zero.
840.28s: And then if Bitcoin grows big enough, where you have fixed liabilities and the equity
843.48s: gets the excess.
844.48s: So I get it.
845.68s: But that's a strategy that he's doing.
847.12s: So I wouldn't say it's a Ponzi.
848.68s: But I would say it is, if Bitcoin never reaches 100,000 again, how is that equity not
854.24s: zero?
855.24s: When you plan out long enough, I mean, it's effectively a zero.
860.56s: If you look at like AMC stock is lost 99%.
863.60s: To me, 99% of the heart percent aren't really all that distinguished.
869.12s: And it leads to a follow up, which fully agree on not being a Ponzi.
875.36s: I think that's a good way to describe it.
877.52s: So I appreciate you walking through that.
880.72s: But I'm curious about if you were to ballpark a probability doesn't really get a specific
887.72s: number.
888.72s: But like a probability of liquidation in something like MSTR, do you have any figures in mind
895.48s: and if not, how would you?
897.20s: Very low.
898.20s: Very low.
899.20s: Actually this is not well understood.
900.80s: I think he never actually has to sell the Bitcoin.
904.16s: He could just print shares.
905.56s: Look at how many shares Adam Aaron has printed at AMC.
908.60s: Look once you're a mean stock, there's always going to be liquidity.
911.64s: Now you have to be ruthless about it and you have to care not at all about the people
915.96s: who are buying that paper from you.
918.00s: But he could print, he could print stock indefinitely.
921.16s: And pay off the debt, keep the Bitcoin and hope for a rebound.
924.76s: And that's what he'll do.
926.20s: My point is the equity is like the weakest instrument in that whole cap-table Eric.
931.56s: And yes, you have that upside.
932.92s: But that upside keeps growing as he issues more dividends and buys Bitcoin at ever higher
937.00s: prices.
938.00s: It doesn't cash flow.
941.00s: The whole leveraging up to buy an asset that doesn't cash flow is a really unique
945.32s: experiment and it's almost guaranteed to come at the expense of the equity.
948.48s: How could it otherwise?
949.48s: How is he going to pay the 1.4 billion that's due every 21 months that we just learned?
955.00s: That's before he does anything more.
956.52s: And so that has to come from the comment.
960.60s: I guess the interesting thing there in my opinion then is if we think that there's over
966.96s: relatively low probability of liquidation, then that infers that we expect there to be
971.88s: permanent demand for the underlying.
974.88s: Well, how many months out of COVID are we with AMC and they're still doing at the market
980.72s: after at the market?
981.72s: I mean, yes, once a meme stock always a meme stock.
985.00s: Because I was going to be traders.
986.60s: There's the liquidity.
988.32s: You can do all the ant or financial shukanery.
992.00s: It looked as no shortage of banks.
993.00s: And I'll ask you to have to take a feed to help them do it.
996.52s: And so yeah, I mean, the AMC traded 6 million shares that I just pulled it up.
1002.72s: No, it's not used for.
1003.96s: I'm like, it used to be, but it's still there.
1005.36s: This volume, you can do a V-Wop and issues and shares.
1009.80s: But yeah, like in before, let's see here, before COVID, this is using Bloomberg.
1017.72s: AMC had, I think, like, see, I pulled it up.
1021.76s: Like that 500 million shares outstanding now.
1024.60s: And before COVID, they had 15.
1028.64s: So he's taken the share count from 15 to 500.
1031.48s: And the best investment in AMC all along was the high yielding debt paper, which is
1037.80s: going to get paid by the 10% coupon.
1041.48s: You could have bought it for a much higher yield than that at its lows.
1044.56s: And off you go.
1045.76s: And so the debt holders are going to win an AMC, not the common.
1050.16s: In fact, just pulling up to see what the yield is on their security.
1054.56s: Yeah, like you're getting 11.8% yield to hold some paper.
1058.92s: That's a due in 2029.
1060.88s: There's no shortage of yield clippers that would mind a few percent of that in
1066.56s: their portfolio.
1067.88s: And he's printing stock to pay that coupon.
1070.32s: And that's what Michael Seller, who long before he would sell Bitcoin, because that would
1074.20s: be a total complete failure of the entire strategy.
1077.12s: He would print shares of AMC and say when Bitcoin goes to 10 million, it's not going
1080.32s: to matter what you do with Shenzhen's.
1082.32s: That's what I think.
1087.32s: It's one of the most interesting market situations on the board.
1091.16s: I follow very closely.
1093.16s: If for no or the reason I look at a weird way, I admire him because he is going all in
1102.36s: with conviction on something that he believes he has an edge on.
1107.36s: Now, it's a shareholders money.
1109.36s: I'm sure he's a big shareholder.
1111.16s: I haven't looked.
1112.16s: I know he had been selling for a while.
1115.36s: But he is an interesting person.
1118.36s: And all hard of the beliefs what he's doing.
1123.36s: And so good for, you know, capital markets, free markets, as long as everyone's aware of
1128.16s: the risks in their portfolio disclose, which, again, I give them full credit for.
1131.36s: They are incredibly well disclosed.
1133.36s: Go ahead, knock yourself out.
1135.36s: It's interesting.
1138.36s: When you see valuable below nav, wouldn't that inferred some sort of decreased interest
1147.36s: in the underlying?
1149.36s: Probably speaking, microstrategy is a closed ETF, right?
1154.36s: And they always trade against discounts in the nav.
1157.36s: And so what was unusual is that it was trading for a premium to now.
1161.36s: And given his strategy, he was smart to sell as much stock as he could because if you
1165.36s: want to own Bitcoin, that means your stock is over in price relative to Bitcoin.
1169.36s: And so you've sell stock and buy Bitcoin.
1171.36s: He closed his own arm.
1172.36s: What did he do?
1174.36s: But yeah, close then ETFs tend to trade for significant discounts.
1178.36s: We saw this with the Sprat, your A&M ETF for a while.
1182.36s: We saw this with, well, with the various hedge funds that went public like Bill
1190.36s: Actman's Fund, I believe trades traded at us and even began discount at one point.
1193.36s: I don't know what it's doing today.
1195.36s: But when you can't, you know, force the arbitrage, then you tend to get a discount.
1202.36s: And so this is a more natural outcome.
1205.36s: But it does limit his financial flexibility to buy more Bitcoin.
1210.36s: Hmm.
1212.36s: Well, can't wait to see how the stack goes.
1217.36s: We're all going to get a front row seat to it.
1219.36s: I mean, I don't know how it could go any other way than what we've laid out.
1223.36s: But what do I know?
1224.36s: I mean, markets are funny sometimes.
1226.36s: Yeah.
1227.36s: And if you look across the market, what else just generally sticks out to you.
1232.36s: I imagine there's got to be some interest on the energy side or even the commodity side.
1239.36s: Yeah.
1240.36s: I'm amazed at how so few people realize that the long term price of all commodities, long term real price of all commodities is lower.
1251.36s: We still get people pushing this whole peak cheap oil nonsense.
1257.36s: We've laid it out in article after article after article and we've had a pretty good run of mostly well grounded predictions that pan out back to sort of developing a
1268.32s: energy and energy management.
1270.32s: And that's why people pay to subscribe to us.
1272.32s: But like just take for example, the oil to gas ratio in the U.S.
1277.32s: That number blew out to 55 when we wrote a piece called generational arbitrage and on an energy content basis.
1284.32s: The ratio of the price of oil expressed in barrels divided by the price of natural gas in dollars for moving BTO.
1291.32s: That ratio should be around six.
1293.32s: The traded up to 55.
1296.32s: We pointed that out.
1298.32s: I said this has to close.
1299.32s: We did a follow up when it dropped down to 25 said this might even go below six eventually.
1305.32s: And here we are today as we're talking it's trading at 12.
1308.32s: So Henry Havana natural gas times 12 is WTI oil today.
1313.32s: And we still think it has further go.
1315.32s: That's because physics is a great edge generator.
1319.32s: Physics says that key to seat things that do the same thing can't self or different prices.
1322.32s: And definitely investments will be made to close that arbitrage.
1325.32s: Especially when it widens out an anacrisprint like that.
1329.32s: You know, 55.
1330.32s: A ratio of 55 when energy says it should be six.
1333.32s: And we're seeing that play out all year slowly grinding.
1338.32s: You know, we see that we've called on your show several times I believe that the equilibrium price of oil is 55.
1347.32s: And here we are, you know, peak oil still decends away like fusion and oil trading in the high 50s.
1355.32s: Maybe 60 for WTI.
1358.32s: You can see where this has to go.
1361.32s: And yet people are blind to it.
1364.32s: So for example, every historical market indicator that crude oil traders, you know, retail
1373.32s: partners like me and you would use is invalid now because they're all backwards looking and they don't correct for technology.
1380.32s: And in the US or in gas are produced together now.
1383.32s: And so you have a classic byproduct situation, which again.
1387.32s: People say, oh, what's the break even price of crude oil on the permit and our answer is you there is not.
1392.32s: You have to know the price of gas too because they're both produced at the same time.
1396.32s: If it was $10 million a million B2 natural gas, the break even price of crude oil on the permit would go negative.
1402.32s: Because they'd give it away just like they do with natural gas now.
1405.32s: They produce them both at the same time.
1407.32s: And so once this glut of natural gas in the permit gets on stock and it will because all arbitrage is closed, you could see a real headwind to oil.
1420.32s: Because you have all this extra oil now that you're producing when you're producing a natural gas for AI, for example.
1426.32s: That's a real threat to the long term price of oil.
1428.32s: So the commodity markets have actually been pretty boring because they're well supplied and commodity markets are boring when they're well supplied and the price goes lower.
1437.32s: If you doubt our view that the long term price of all commodities is lower just plot any of them announces a goal.
1446.32s: And see for yourself.
1447.32s: So you know, I probably the most exciting market this year besides AI and crypto of course has been precious metals and gold.
1453.32s: And so we watch that pretty carefully too.
1458.32s: On those there's obviously been a meteoric price in golden silver and it's interesting because sometimes there is like a clear catalyst.
1468.32s: Sometimes there's not sometimes it's a bunch of different things that cause a move but one thing I've found so far, especially with metals is there really isn't like a well accepted consensus that I've come across in terms of why the most happening.
1485.32s: And you guys haven't opinion on that depends on the two metals of course because I think they are different markets.
1491.32s: And we follow gold much more closely than silver just and full disclosure.
1496.32s: But in the silver market it seems like we're having a classic sort of squeeze on physical and some people are standing for delivery and silver is being moved around the world and getting a little funky and you know squeezes can be very profitable if you're long.
1511.32s: Not so much if you're short but at the same time they tend not to persist the supply the fundamental supply demand for silver.
1521.32s: You know especially if sold is going to struggle under Trump.
1525.32s: It seems seems to me the long term not super bullish but you know it's trading about 58 today.
1532.32s: Good for my friends who are long it.
1534.32s: I'm going to the different story I think gold is systematically replacing or at least displacing part of the demand for US treasuries as a neutral reserve assets.
1544.32s: Driven by mostly the sanctions war and the freezing of the Russian or reserve assets which has.
1552.32s: Now for much of the world made those debt instruments no longer neutral if the political wins of a US president and can can basically.
1562.32s: Allow them to default in their debt obligations by not giving you your money back which is what this is.
1568.32s: Then they're no longer neutral.
1570.32s: There the political weapon of.
1572.32s: Western leaders and we happen to have a pretty volatile leader in the White House today.
1576.32s: Love a merciless.
1578.32s: Nobody would doubt that he's he's is call options on Trump would be expensive if you know what I mean.
1584.32s: And so the neutrality of US treasuries or you know European debt has been erased.
1591.32s: I think that was a catastrophic blunder that history will recognize as such in due course.
1596.32s: And gold in order for it to play.
1599.32s: And so the role as a neutral reserve asset needs a bigger market cap than it had.
1604.32s: Who knows where it goes from here.
1606.32s: One of the questions we we ask ourselves Eric is who gets hurt if old if gold goes higher.
1613.32s: The US would want gold to go higher because they could revaluate their gold and free up a lot of room for Scott best into maneuver.
1619.32s: People who own it don't care if it goes up.
1622.32s: Who cares if it goes to 10,000 or 20,000 or 50,000.
1628.32s: In a way.
1630.32s: And so not calling for those prices but gold gold initially metal and I think it is.
1637.32s: You know almost exclusively driven by.
1641.32s: The shock and reverberations of the sanctions mortgage for us after the war in your cranes started in 2022.
1648.32s: Speaking of the war in Ukraine.
1651.32s: What do you think?
1654.32s: You know, wars are hard to lose.
1655.32s: We've been on here several times with you and we've had a bit of a.
1658.32s: Outlier opinion, but I think that opinion is proving to be.
1661.32s: Mostly correct the winning side isn't suing for peace, you know.
1665.32s: And so all of this talk about ceasefire on the freeze the lines and you know all that stuff rush of course is brushing all that aside.
1672.32s: What I find fascinating is.
1675.32s: Trump's inability.
1677.32s: Well, let me say it this way.
1679.32s: It seems to care an awful lot about the opinions of people who obviously hate him.
1685.32s: Which is a fascinating thing.
1687.32s: So the European leaders hate him.
1689.32s: Starmers leadership team came over here and campaigned for Harris.
1693.32s: The neocons and Washington hate him.
1696.32s: And yet whenever he gets close to a deal with Putin he gets talked out of it by a combination of the European Zelensky and in the neocons and perhaps he doesn't feel he has the political power to just say.
1708.32s: That is a wash of my hands. Good luck.
1711.32s: With the war, but don't get caught, wasn't peach cover you crane like.
1714.32s: There's no great fondness for Donald Trump, I bet you.
1717.32s: Zelensky certainly based on the White House meeting.
1721.32s: You know, where he advanced gun and do it.
1723.32s: He certainly has no love.
1724.32s: Lost for advanced.
1726.32s: And so I it is a fascinating situation.
1728.32s: I don't know what Kushner and and Woodcoff are bringing to Moscow on this trip because it sure seems like.
1734.32s: the Europeans and Ukraine have rejected this 29 point police plan or whatever is floating around.
1740.96s: And Russia is just slowly doing what Russia does, which is the grinding war of attrition,
1746.56s: moving slightly from west to east every day, a new village, a new strong point.
1752.56s: They have more people than Ukraine, they have more weapons than Ukraine, they have more money than
1756.24s: Ukraine, they have more energy than Ukraine, and they're just going to grind away into the achieve their objectives.
1761.60s: And so I think we're at this point where we wrote a piece a couple of weeks ago, you may have seen it called forcing function.
1769.12s: But I think ends the war as Ukraine is broke.
1772.32s: The real dagger to Ukraine was when Trump stopped the money train, and Europeans can't afford it.
1781.28s: I think they're running 100% budget deficit there, they're taking in half in taxes,
1785.84s: then what they need to spend, 140, 150 billion dollar whole, over the next couple of years.
1791.92s: And that nobody wants to pay it.
1795.44s: Certainly Europe's not going to pay it. There's no political support to pay it in the US.
1800.00s: That's going to drive what I think will be a hyperinflationary crisis soon.
1804.88s: And that will collapse.
1806.88s: Ukraine's ability to stay in the war and they will have to sue for peace on warstorms.
1810.72s: Then there seem to be on offer here. Last point I'd say, impossible to know what's really going on.
1815.76s: So much propaganda, so much misinformation.
1820.00s: Europeans in particular flood the field with it. We read everybody's propaganda. I'll tell you
1824.56s: without hesitation that the worst in the world is the British propaganda.
1828.80s: It is unbelievable how much garbage comes out of the British mainstream press,
1834.80s: over lies, you know, total manipulations. The British people are soaked in propaganda.
1842.88s: Anytime we comment on this, we'll often get an angry subscriber or listener,
1847.68s: Senate and email. And inevitably, they're from the UK.
1851.60s: Because our views are so different than what they see every single day in the newspaper on television
1857.60s: that it's just they can't believe that somebody recently while educated would hold our views.
1863.68s: When you read everybody's propaganda, you have a far better chance of understanding what's really going on.
1867.60s: What do you think of the perspective that the fact that the war really hasn't come
1879.20s: to an end yet is actually positive for Ukraine if Russia wanted to like really impose its will?
1887.92s: It seemingly could, but hasn't. Yeah, we just put a doomsday on this called World War
1893.76s: 3, how we got here and where we're going. I forgot about doomsday. I just didn't have that so much.
1900.16s: We love it too. It's a great, great little side business. It's all set on on it. Yeah.
1904.80s: That was like a 50-minute presentation where we walked through, you know, from the year 2000 to
1911.44s: the war in Ukraine and then the war in Ukraine and then where we're going, which we believe is multiple
1914.88s: wars in the Western Hemisphere. It's a gift to the punchline.
1920.56s: So even the way the war is described is wildly different. So in Russia, Putin and his leadership
1929.12s: described as a special military operation. They have not gone formalization. One of Putin's objectives
1937.20s: seems to be minimal disruption of the everyday life of Russian citizens. We have friends who know
1943.60s: people in Russia and they tell us that to those people not much has changed. Yes, it's not my
1949.68s: tunnels anymore. It's got a slightly different name, but there's still hamburgers there and
1953.04s: you know, they still have, it's not Starbucks anymore, but they still get very good coffee,
1956.48s: served by the same people. And if you read Russian propaganda and we do, rather well,
1963.12s: then I read Ukrainian propaganda too, you will find contrary to what people believe in the West,
1969.52s: open and sometimes harsh criticism of Putin for not being aggressive enough in the war in Ukraine.
1976.16s: Being too worried about, you know, is Donald Trump somebody could even kind of deal with,
1980.24s: let's just finish this thing militarily. Let's pull up another million soldiers. Let's go full
1984.96s: war footing and he has resisted that. And in fact, if there weren't to be a regime change in Russia,
1990.64s: it would come from the right. And you would get somebody like a Medvedev instead of a Putin who is
1995.92s: either play acting or, you know, is doing his best Trump in personation on Twitter.
2003.36s: But there's a strong feeling in Russia that Putin is playing this too slow and it's coming
2008.96s: at the expense of Russia. And that, in fact, the red line that was crossed in November,
2014.00s: when Long Range, Western Basimists was relaunched into 32014 Russia. He was muted in his response
2021.20s: and anticipating the Trump would soon return to office and that Trump was summoned with whom
2025.12s: business could be done. And so all this talk about, you know, Thama Hawk missiles kind of
2033.52s: put Putin in a bind domestically. And that's why he came out publicly and said that the response
2037.92s: to such a escalation would be a quote overwhelming, which is unusual for him to say. Now,
2043.84s: if you're Ukrainian, none of this sounds familiar to you because you're living under bombardment.
2050.88s: Your energy sector has been severely damaged. Your thermal water systems, which are critical for
2058.56s: for winter heating happen, you know, severely damaged. Again, we think this is obvious war crimes.
2063.84s: The, you don't need to attack the heating system of the civilian life in Ukraine to achieve a war
2070.32s: aim. But nonetheless, all wars are basically criminal in our view, which is why we're so violently
2076.32s: opposed to them. But nonetheless, you know, the way in which Putin describes the war versus,
2086.00s: I remember in the early days because, you know, we were kind of critical of John Kerry. He was a
2089.36s: climates Arab back then in the early weeks of the war. He was openly worrying about the climate
2094.16s: impact of the war, which was seemed rather silly. But he said, you know, the last end of the European
2100.00s: media describes this as a quote, unprovoked total war of aggression. And so if you think this is an
2106.16s: unprovoked total war of aggression, then the relatively slow grinding move from West to East
2113.12s: that Russia has achieved seems like stalemate, seems insufficient relative to the disparity between the
2120.88s: two powers. If you're Russia, you're trying to liberate these four regions. That's the language they
2125.60s: use, not my language. And they've got 100% of one and 80% of another one and 75% of the other two.
2133.44s: This of course is, you know, the Dombas, which is two regions, and then Kersan and Saperhorja,
2141.44s: I've never thought I would learn these places on the map, but because we follow the war every day
2146.00s: I've come to. And so if it is a special military operation with a limited deployment of
2151.92s: treasure and blood. And every day the field tilts ever more into your favor. The belief inside
2161.04s: of Russia is of course that wars of attrition are one suddenly. And the Ukrainian army is by many reports
2169.52s: nearing exhaustion. Fighting heroically, the biggest victims in all of this are the people of Ukraine.
2174.16s: I mean, let's be the honest, that country will emerge from this crisis destroyed,
2180.08s: which is one of the great tragedies of our time for sure. But again, the propaganda, you
2185.76s: have to sort of read all sides. Lastly, I'll say, next time there's a big global world-beating
2192.08s: news story, you know, like that dominates the global headlines. The great exercise is to read how
2197.04s: eight different countries are framing it. You'll never look at the news the same way again.
2202.16s: So read how China frames it all Israel frames it all Iran frames it Russia, Ukraine, Britain,
2207.60s: US, Canada, Mexico. To take aid countries, go read the English language version of their most popular
2213.44s: newspaper and see how they're covering the story and your mind will be blown. You will then have a
2220.64s: visceral appreciation for the bath of propaganda that we're all swimming in.
2228.32s: It's a really curious opinion and I appreciate you going into the nuance of it just because
2235.12s: it seems like if Russia felt confident enough in their ability that we would have more of a
2240.24s: Crimea where happens, it's done and then they get what they want, they move on. So,
2246.48s: obviously, yeah, I've slightly different perspective on how it's going out, but that's
2251.44s: rather humor there. Let me explain that because Crimea is a 90% Russian, right, voted as we said in
2258.00s: this. So the first thing that we try to do when we analyze situations that are steeped in propaganda
2262.00s: is let's find some indisputable data that everyone agrees is not manipulated. And so for this,
2269.44s: the data we said along was the results of the 2010 election in Ukraine by region. And there were
2277.68s: two candidates in that election. One was pro-Russian and one was pro-European. This was the great
2281.76s: debate I read with fascinating interest over the weekend, a 2014 article published in the Washington
2288.64s: post by none other than Henry Kissinger. And when you read that article, it's pretty fascinating.
2293.60s: He's pretty present. Crimea historically is Russian, 75 or 80% of the people that live their
2303.12s: speak Russian, they voted in huge waves for the pro-Russian candidate. And on the other side of the
2307.36s: country, they were voting 90% for the pro-European candidate. So when you look at that map of outcome
2312.08s: by region, heat map, red, Russia, blue, Europe, it looks like a country on the verge of civil war.
2317.76s: Now, Crimea, they were welcomed and then between 2014 and 2022 Ukraine, with NATO's help, built
2323.92s: the whole bunch of fortifications along the other four regions. And these are the formations that Russia
2329.60s: is fully grinding through today, whereas Crimea did not have such fortifications. And the Russian army
2335.84s: was mostly welcomed. And so that's the big difference I think is the time between 2014 and 2022
2342.96s: at eight years to build up an army, to build up fortifications, to inject a bunch of weapons into
2348.24s: Ukraine. There was a civil war in the Dombasins, as I'm sure you know, before 2022, there was
2353.68s: shell and going on. And they tried to separate. And there were violence on both sides. And civil
2358.88s: wars are messy. And I'm not making a judgment call. I'm just observing that there was a civil war going
2362.56s: on. And so in those eight years, Crimea, if Russia had wanted to go into the other regions as well,
2370.56s: I think they would have found it a much easier thing back in 2014 than it is today. And again,
2374.88s: if you're Putin and you're worried about minimizing your casualties, then certain way to go about
2381.12s: things. So, that's right. Yeah, which is interesting, because I find the ultimate irony is
2388.56s: the longer it goes on actually overwhelmingly the more casualty they face.
2394.48s: There are arguments in the Russia. Yeah, it's actually like, let's just rip the bandade off.
2398.24s: Right. You're actually articulating the argument on Putin's right.
2403.84s: Well, yeah, I think if it just in context of the decision making cycle, because at least the way that I
2409.92s: look at it, there's likely a series of reasons why Russia and specifically Putin hasn't come in
2417.36s: heavy handed. He's not a soft guy. I don't think he's looking at this. Like, let me try to do this
2422.72s: with a soft touch that's never been a style. So, to me, if there was an overwhelming capability
2432.24s: to do this entire war in a week, even if it's a bloody week, it will still be way less bloody
2437.68s: than years of this thing going. So, to me, the fact that he hasn't done that is actually very,
2443.92s: very telling in terms of his perception of his position. Well, I think he also, sorry, God.
2450.24s: I was just going to summarize with, I think if he thought he could get away with it, he would.
2456.00s: So, I think you're forgetting a couple of things. Yeah.
2459.68s: Russia has a huge military industrial complex, just like the US, and there's probably a
2463.28s: whole bunch of people in Russia who've gotten very rich from this war. And when you're in the
2467.52s: bomb making business pieces of working capital problem, just like Ukraine, just like the US,
2472.80s: there's probably a significant amount of corruption in Russia. Bomb is a rich person, sorry,
2479.36s: wars of its person's racket, man. Like, you know, there's an enormous amount of money being made
2484.96s: in the US, in Europe, and in Russia over the war. And it's mostly being fought in former Ukraine,
2493.68s: in territory, not in pre-14, pre-2014, Russia. And so, you know, there's entire industries that have
2502.96s: been spooled up. Tax payer money has been funneled towards it. And like you said,
2509.44s: I'm doubted the many fortunes being made on, unfortunately, on the backs of the soldiers who are actually
2515.92s: fighting and dying for this war. And so that's just one of the tragedies of life. Like, look,
2520.96s: what's going on with Venezuela? Like, okay, we're not going to do Ukraine anymore. We've got to
2524.96s: keep the name concept. So, let's go get a war going, you know, in the Western Hemisphere. It's
2528.88s: hard not to be cynical, but such a mental model works. And, you know, if it works,
2534.40s: it predict future events, then that's a useful one. Yeah, it's super interesting. One,
2539.92s: one last question on that, then I, I want to pivot to something else. But if you think it's about
2548.80s: money, which don't disagree, war obviously is a massive, massive revenue generator.
2554.88s: Then why, why this structure for this war? I mean, realistically, they could have had an even
2562.16s: easier time executing a similar strategy in Crimea, even though Crimea itself is a populace
2569.36s: was more welcoming. That doesn't mean Ukraine is a country was willing to just let them go.
2573.84s: So, they could have waited for resistance and then spark a war there to, you know, drive revenue
2578.32s: for a while, probably on an easier structure, because it's not as defensible. So, they could
2582.64s: equally as slow. So, this, if we go a little bit deeper into the sequence of events,
2592.08s: when the war first started, Russia made huge moves. Sorry, just the current one, not Crimea.
2598.88s: Yes, the current one. Yeah, the 20, 20, you know, soldiers outside of Kiev, you know,
2604.16s: a Zelensky kind of panic. There was a deal on the table. There was negotiated in Istanbul.
2608.40s: It was initial by both sides. Who knows the full history, but as it's told now,
2614.64s: Boris Johnson famously, Flutikiev and Tosolinsky, not the sign that the ill in that NATO would
2621.44s: would give Ukraine all the weapons it needs to inflict their quote strategic defeat on
2626.80s: Russia. So, I think Putin was surprised at the scale of the military supplies and other assistance
2638.24s: being fed to Ukraine. And so, Russia moved very far very quickly and then it got pushed back quite far,
2645.28s: actually. And 22, 22, 23 was about Ukrainian counteroffences. And in late 2023, the large,
2654.72s: Ukrainian counteroffensive was defeated by Russia that failed. And then since then, because I follow
2660.32s: these maps every day, it's been a slow grinding one way traffic from West to East,
2667.60s: where a war of attrition has been fought. But I think Putin, you know, in Russia, this is what
2674.32s: they tell themselves. We are at war with 27 member states of NATO. Now, as we said in our
2681.60s: Zoom Zoom, not all the best weapons were sent, but they were sent in volume hundreds of buildings,
2685.60s: weapons were sent, challenger tanks, Abrams, you know, F-16s. Of course, not the F-35s, but F-16s.
2693.28s: Yeah, you name it. Pretty good, steady there at weapons were sent in volume. And lots of quote-unquote
2699.84s: mercenaries fighting over there. And, you know, and so on. But you're never going to win a logistics war against
2707.76s: Russia from over here, especially when your logistics depends on China as much as it does. And China's
2711.92s: clearly picked its side in this conflict that is feeding enormous amount of resources to Russia,
2717.76s: helping withdrawums. We don't doubt for a second that Russia is sharing everything it's learned
2722.40s: about these NATO weapons systems with China in anticipation of a potential conflict in Asia. And so
2729.44s: there's a, it is absolutely true that Ukraine is fought heroically. They had enormous assistance
2737.52s: from the West. All the in 400 billion euros is when you add it all up. There's a lot of money here.
2743.28s: And, you know, Russia has large of an economy as it is and has a commodity powerhouse as it is.
2750.40s: Still had to spool up, had to re-orient it is just now cranking out drones. You know, they say
2756.56s: a thousand a day by the end of the year of these large Geron drones. I guess they're called that.
2761.76s: And so what we're seeing now is an attack on Ukraine's energy grid, the likes of which we haven't
2767.12s: seen an attack on the thermal water grid. And attack on the realm that work. And so it is again,
2773.52s: sad. By the way, I wish, for example, that the Istanbul Agreement had gone through and
2779.92s: were at this scale and for this length of time could have been avoided. Back then it was just two
2784.88s: regions. By the way, who gone some Doness that the two regions that make up what people call the
2790.00s: Dombas and now it's four. And the Russians say that, you know, if they conquer the four
2795.84s: and Ukraine still keeps fighting, then it would be six would be eight and they'll eventually just
2799.84s: take everything to the west of the Nipur river, including Kiev. I doubt they can do that.
2804.56s: And without going full mobilization, like you know, I talked about earlier, but that's what's being
2810.08s: set amongst each other in Russia on Russian television and Russian newspaper.
2814.40s: It's incredible. Like the whole thing is absolutely fascinating. It's a really, really interesting
2821.52s: play on a lot of human factors, which in obviously the cycle of wars just everything.
2828.32s: So, yeah, look, I-
2829.12s: I-
2829.36s: I-
2829.60s: If the first Gulf War was the first television war, this is the first internet war. And that's the thing
2833.92s: that's amazing about this war is you and I, it's been an hour of day going through open
2838.00s: source of intel and see what's going on, satellite images. So there's all these mapping projects,
2842.08s: that are trying to map the line of combat contact. And there's three variety of
2847.12s: of them. There are those that come from Ukraine, most famously deep state, for example.
2853.20s: There's plenty of Russian mapping projects. And then there's a few that try to be neutral.
2856.80s: And the thing is they all kind of self-check each other because you can't be too far off the consensus,
2861.52s: otherwise everybody knows what your bias is and that you become an unreliable project. And so
2866.80s: you could Google Deep State map and you could, you know, do a time series as a,
2872.32s: all kinds of time series of the map. And there's one on YouTube, which I'll pull up, you know,
2878.72s: if we keep talking about this. But there's one that puts a daily map of the entire war
2885.84s: from 2022 to today at once a month. So look, December one, we'll come out on December 1st.
2892.24s: And you could just see, you could follow the initial wave of Russia going in and then slowly
2898.80s: beating back by the Ukraine's and then it stops and then it stays pretty steady for a long time.
2902.64s: And then now it's starting to move back. And these are the sort of consensus views of all three
2908.00s: sides. And so it's kind of hard, like when you see what's going on to then not read propaganda
2914.32s: for what it is. And so you can find all main earth stuff. Now that doesn't mean that it will be true.
2919.76s: You have to develop sources that you begin to think are reliable and trust over time.
2924.88s: But even bad propaganda is good in tell. What the British are telling themselves is a
2930.32s: day of point, especially if you've become skilled in the art of reading their propaganda.
2935.44s: And so this is where we are. I think my, our view still is that there is no negotiated settlement.
2941.20s: This will be settled militarily. Terms will be dictated. And one side will capitulate.
2947.60s: Probably pretty obvious we think that cycle B. But there's no world in which
2954.88s: Putin is going to compromise. There's a let's he could accept Putin's demands. And so when you have
2958.64s: still make like that, then you just as Trump says have to let them fight it out.
2964.72s: Well, the like I always really appreciate your perspective and thank you for
2970.80s: exploring it with me. The definitely differences in general nuances. But I think the general consensus
2979.84s: pretty aligned that war is hell. So oh yeah 100%. Look at we are wildly anti war for this very
2987.52s: reason. Who wins in this war? Nobody wins the Russian stone. You crane insertly don't win. The
2992.16s: West doesn't win. You know, Europe is bankrupted itself. US, you know, neutral reserve assets status has been
3000.32s: severely damaged. I mean, there's no winners in this. So Russia gets to occupy four regions
3006.16s: that have been bombed out. Okay. Now they got to spend to rebuild those. The winners, of course,
3011.36s: of the military and industrial complex and all the people that make money by building bombs. But
3016.24s: you know, don't count me amongst them. Depending on how the war concludes regardless of,
3023.68s: you know, the way we arrive there. What would your opinion then be on gas going from there?
3031.92s: Natural gas? Yeah. The real-time price of all-commonity. The long-term real price of all
3037.36s: commodities is lower in gases. No different. We arrive at our equilibrium price of
3042.80s: oil of $55 by taking $10 land at LNG. It's under that today now in Europe. Gases cheap. LNG is
3049.76s: still more expensive than pipeline gas. But long-term gas gets cheap in real terms. Always.
3057.12s: As more and more pipelines are built and midstreamers reduce the friction of bringing
3063.68s: gas to market. Supply is basically infinite. And so yeah, lower. I mean, we're pretty much at equilibrium
3071.60s: price now. LNG can't go much lower than here. And people in the supply chain still make money.
3079.20s: And so that's kind of a, you know, we might punch through this floor. But then if you go low enough,
3083.12s: that might be a buying opportunity because it has to come back to the equilibrium price. We
3086.64s: we arrive at that equilibrium price by saying, you know, $4 million in BTO and the US is great for
3092.24s: local drillers. And then tack on six bucks to get it from there to Europe. And you get 10
3097.12s: everybody earns their cost of capital at that price. And so that's how we arrived at our 55-dollar
3101.76s: equilibrium price for oil that I mentioned earlier. And that's been a pretty reasonable,
3106.08s: you know, physics-based market edge to have in the back of your mind.
3110.80s: Makes sense. And I want to be thoughtful of your time. I have one more question here.
3116.64s: Looking out at 2026, it seems now more than ever and increasingly so at energy continues to be
3126.40s: center stage. And obviously, your guys' work is primarily all trickles back to energy. But if
3134.32s: you look out over 26 of their any surprises that you expect might come with respect to energy.
3144.16s: Yeah, I see the political revolutions all across Europe in the aftermath of the war,
3149.12s: assuming the war comes to an end. Wars are hard to lose. Europe went all in. When you go all in
3154.16s: and you lose, you have to suffer the consequences. I could see political revolution in Germany
3163.20s: for sure, perhaps the collapse of the EU itself. No air in the world is there a more
3169.36s: sorry batch of political leaders without skill than in the European Union. And I would include
3175.28s: Britain in that regard. I think Britain, frankly, is a failed state.
3180.40s: Could see civil war in Britain. It's coming pretty close to that.
3184.72s: The it was just reading today on zero heads, it's somebody got arrested for posting a photo of
3191.60s: themselves with a gun while they were in the US on social media. They went home and they were arrested.
3198.56s: Did you know that Britain has arrested 12,000 people for online, hate speech they call it?
3205.92s: Like this is not a free country anymore. You have a leader who's at 10% popularity that can't be
3210.88s: out since they'll 29 except for them within his own party. They're drowning in debt, running big
3219.20s: deficits. They brought in huge inflow of immigrants who were taxing the system as well.
3225.84s: And so it's hard to see Britain, how Britain will emerge from 2026 will be interesting. Let's put it
3233.28s: that way. So again, all depends on when the war ends. I think there'll be a huge reckoning.
3239.68s: Once that war is over and what has actually been going on there becomes more widely known.
3244.16s: This is a huge amount of propaganda. Of course, the thick and appropriate amount of the whole campaign.
3248.08s: But watch watch Germany, political revolution in Germany, European Union itself. And then Britain
3255.76s: we're mostly interested in Europe because of that's the biggest disruption to energy flows at
3259.76s: cause the energy crisis that was ongoing when we emerged as doomburg. And so we always watch it very carefully.
3266.16s: That's probably most interesting. Then the last thing I'd say is obviously 2026 is going to be the
3270.40s: year of war in the Western hemisphere. But as well as just the opening act that I would see regime
3274.72s: changing Cuba. These protests in Mexico have all the hallmarks of a Western NGO
3281.84s: color revolution attempt on Mexico.
3287.28s: Tensions with Colombia. We're about to see the Trump of Chile elected.
3292.96s: May lay, of course, as in Trump's camp. So if you just go up and down,
3297.12s: southern part of the Western hemisphere and bluntly put people into pro-trop and not pro-trom buckets.
3302.96s: The not pro-trom buckets are going to be in force and tension.
3308.64s: One quick follow-up on the amount of turnover and overall strife that you first see in Europe.
3316.96s: You touched on it really briefly. I'm just curious if you could maybe double click one more layer.
3321.36s: In terms of the impact that all of that turnover can have on the energy sector.
3328.32s: So Germany could turn back on the remaining Nord Stream pipeline.
3333.76s: Pipeline gas could flow through Poland again. For example,
3341.04s: there's the weight Europe used to run was cheap energy from Russia, cheap labor from eastern Europe,
3348.56s: and healthy export markets to China. All three of those are gone now,
3352.72s: especially in Germany. So the way you pivot from where you are to where you were is to begin to go back
3359.84s: in that direction. It's summing the Russians. We're willing to sell the energy to Europe,
3366.16s: which is a whole different question altogether. So they could make fracking legal.
3373.20s: They could stop destroying their nuclear power plants, mindlessly, and turn a few of them back on.
3379.76s: They could, you know, the British could make drilling for oil and gas easier in the North Sea,
3385.20s: and not tax energy companies at 78% marginal rates. These are all policy choices that are choking
3392.08s: Europe. And when you have a political revolution, what happens is the opposite of those choices
3397.92s: become the policy. And so that's why we're watching Europe so carefully. Because again,
3403.20s: we in that presentation, we just showed, you know, the hydrocarbon production consumption
3408.48s: numbers by select region, right? And the US is, well, North America is a net hydrocarbon
3414.88s: exporter of significant size. So you just take coal natural gas in oil. How much does Mexico can
3419.92s: in the US produce? How much does Mexico can in the US consume? That delta is what's available for
3424.88s: export, coal, natural gas oil. Russia's a huge hydrocarbon exporter. Europe consumes 38
3432.88s: exigules. The hydrocarbons and only produces five, which is remarkable. You know, the southern part of
3440.24s: the Western Hemisphere consumes 20 exigules and produces 22. So it's fine. It's balanced. The US is
3445.76s: like plus 17 exigules, Russia's plus 2425. And so you can see just this gaping hole in Europe's
3455.44s: strategic economic positioning. It doesn't produce itself. It doesn't produce itself. Actually,
3459.84s: so it has to pay to cost a capital for everyone else who does. And you can't have heavy industry
3464.32s: as we like to save. If you're not self-sufficient energy, you don't get to have nice things.
3469.28s: The only really chance you have is to be super high-end like Taiwan is on semiconductor. So they're
3474.16s: an energy vessel, but they're made themselves into Spencer, both of their global economy for now
3479.36s: by being very, very good at producing high-end semiconductors and chips. And so it's in
3485.76s: everybody's interest that Taiwan gets at hydrocarbons. And because they're so far on the high
3489.84s: and the manufacturing that they can afford to pay up, but you can't have steel plants and you can't
3494.96s: make artillery shells and tanks and boats and planes when you're buying everything from China.
3501.92s: Because China could turn it off as we're seeing with the rare earths. And it's just prohibitively
3506.40s: expensive. And so steel is leaving Britain. Steel is leaving Germany. The auto industry is going to
3512.08s: suffer a big time. The chemical industry in Germany's devastated. The BSF existed at the other end of a
3518.32s: pipe of natural gas from Russia. Period. That's how BSF, one of the great chemical companies of
3524.48s: the last 120 odd years were not longer. Definitely longer. They've been crippled by this.
3532.00s: Chemical factory after chemical factories closing in Europe, those will never be reopened.
3536.80s: You never get permits to reopen those. And some, you know, Europe will become,
3542.56s: if it stays on the current course, a tourist attraction. A little more.
3551.52s: Yeah, full-tower is kind of cool. Yeah, a lot coming. It's beautiful architecture, sure.
3556.88s: But you got a mystery. You know, I mean, the thing, US listeners should be so grateful for the
3564.72s: American oil and gas industry. It's actually the anchor of US geopolitical power going forward.
3571.44s: It worked for the shale revolution. The US would be in a world of hurt. There's some of
3576.64s: it in Europe. But thankfully, we've crafted natural gas. If it's a climate, we have hundreds of
3583.12s: co-generation facilities, which produce power and steam that form the foundation of a still,
3588.48s: pretty successful manufacturing industry and the foundation for a rebirth of that industry that
3593.76s: Trump is trying to execute. I have a list of notes for our next conversation, because that
3601.84s: immediately gets me interested to talk about nuclear power and stuff like that. But I know that
3607.28s: you have chicken things to do. Yeah, most of that got to take my afternoon nap. So. Yes.
3612.96s: Well, you have a very specific, it's not, you put it lightly there. It sounds like
3617.52s: yeah, I just like to take a nap. But like you have a very specific sleep cycle. So,
3622.48s: yeah, it's not like a casual, this is like really important. Really to keep on the cycle.
3627.20s: Yeah, it's it co-exist with our writing cycle, which as you know, it's hard to produce
3632.64s: you know, 2,000 words, research write edit, publish, promote, and defend 2,000 words every four days.
3638.80s: Means you have to be pretty disciplined with your time. Mixing all of our podcast appearances.
3643.20s: This is why we don't have a, we have a no meetings lifestyle where we just don't accept outside
3647.52s: meetings and we other than podcasts and we just focus on feeding the beast, as we say, you know,
3653.76s: wake up, show up, make the number go up and repeat. I love it. Thank you sincerely for sharing
3664.56s: your perspective and taking the time to go through some of the nuances of this stuff. One of my
3669.20s: biggest hopes for people that listen to our podcasts is exposure to different opinions ideas and
3676.88s: how to think about the world. And I think you provide a really, really great framework. Sometimes
3681.76s: people will get a little angsty about some of the takes, which to me is always, uh, they, they've
3688.56s: missed the boat in that scenario. And they're focusing on the wrong thing. So, thank you for what you do.
3693.68s: Yeah, two things real quick. Um, the only thing worse than being wrong in this business is having
3698.16s: no opinion. Um, that's one. And two, we never get offended by, authentically held views
3704.80s: play the express. And so, our, our brand ambition is that you will get our authentically held
3709.60s: views and we will express them lightly. And if that anger is you, that's a you problem, not, not a
3714.80s: me problem or, or an us problem. And so I really appreciate, you have me on always enjoy our
3720.00s: discussions. You find everything at doomberg.com. Of course, um, look forward to the next one.
3725.36s: And actually, I, I'll throw a link to your website below. You guys have a bunch of recent paper
3732.96s: that you put out. I see war or three, cover up a thother, close loop. You guys have just absolutely
3739.12s: been on a tear with a lot of these topics more recently. So, there would be a link to that
3744.40s: for everybody. Is there any where else that you want to send anybody in addition to that?
3748.64s: Yeah, we have a second sub-stack classics run aloud that a co-founder of Dumburgan,
3753.20s: its editor and chief has started in September. Um, it's all about curating the best of literature
3759.20s: and presenting it in this, the Dumburgan very, very high production value. Really brave
3764.16s: stuff shows you the depth and breadth of our team as well. And you know, building a new social media
3768.48s: platform from scratch has been fun and challenging and interesting and gives us a little bit of a
3772.96s: throwback to when we first started doing the gorilla marketing around Dumburgan. Really great stuff.
3778.24s: You can find it at the Dumburgan page. We have a tab for it. Or you can go to
3782.24s: classics. Read aloud.subsect.com. Really great stuff. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the opportunity to
3786.08s: talk to you soon. Beautiful. See you guys.
