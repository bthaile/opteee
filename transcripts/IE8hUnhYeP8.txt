0.00s: What's up, Alias?
1.40s: Let's talk about four critical mistakes
3.96s: to avoid after you place an options trade.
8.96s: The ironic thing about trading
10.80s: is most of the work is done before you place a trade,
14.96s: but a lot of people then might have something
19.48s: that's good, good idea, good trade,
21.92s: and then they mess it up.
23.44s: The goal of this video is to walk you through
26.36s: four of the absolute most common circumstances
29.20s: that I see happen with this.
30.84s: The very first one is setting P&L management,
35.88s: which you'll get a sense of why that one's on here in a second.
39.80s: Next is over emphasizing individual trades.
43.64s: Third is focusing only on realized,
46.00s: which again I'll explain all of these with examples,
48.48s: and then a hyperactive management.
49.68s: That one's probably the easiest to get.
52.24s: In the context of setting P&L management,
54.80s: the reality is that should unequivocally be done
57.92s: before you enter the trade every single time period.
61.44s: If you are doing that, when you are in the trade,
64.84s: you're a day late dollar short.
66.88s: And like I said, I have specific examples for each of these,
69.96s: so I'm just giving you an overview
71.24s: and then we'll double click.
73.04s: Next we have the individual trade concept,
76.00s: which is the being of my existence,
78.20s: because it's very, very difficult to explain this concept
81.80s: to traders in a way that makes sense
83.56s: until they're ready to hear it.
85.44s: We will explain more about that in a moment.
89.16s: The next one in terms of realized,
91.28s: there's a big gap sometimes between what your idea was,
95.72s: what ends up happening separate from the outcome of the trade.
101.60s: What this means is you could lose money,
104.24s: but had the right idea, or you can make money
107.24s: with the wrong idea, and there's some really key downsides
111.24s: to that.
112.08s: And the last one is,
112.92s: exactly what it sounds like, is just getting too involved.
115.72s: Let's take a look at some examples,
117.28s: P&L management.
119.28s: This is hilarious,
121.36s: because I cannot tell you how many posts I've seen,
125.12s: how many times I've had people reach out to me,
127.96s: asking what they should do in a trade that they're already in.
132.40s: The reality is this goes into what I've saying at the beginning,
135.92s: the work is done before you enter.
137.96s: When you enter a trade, when you finally click the button,
141.32s: that genuinely should be the easiest part of the transaction
146.12s: going forward if you do a good job.
148.96s: And the reason for that is because all of the work
152.96s: and all of the research should be done already.
157.64s: And if it's not, then yeah,
160.44s: you're gonna be in for a little bit of a bumpy ride.
164.24s: So the simplest solution to this one to avoid this,
167.32s: every single time is before you enter a trade,
169.60s: you have some ideas in terms of where you're gonna manage your P&L.
172.88s: This doesn't have to be hyper-specific.
176.28s: So for example, if we look in O&DS,
179.20s: literally just because it's up,
180.92s: let's say that you entered long calls here.
183.80s: That doesn't mean that you have to pick a specific price.
187.36s: I'm gonna get out when it hits nine.
189.40s: More often than not, that actually makes absolutely no sense,
192.56s: based on what the profit mechanism is
194.48s: and what you're attempting to capture.
195.96s: So let's say in this,
197.40s: you're trying to capture a breakout
199.76s: or really strong near-term momentum.
202.88s: Well, if you bought those calls
205.16s: and this thing did this move,
208.36s: then it starts rolling over like this.
210.92s: This actually bleeds into one of the other mistakes
212.92s: that we're gonna talk about in a second.
214.84s: But let's instead say that you were using the 10 day moving average
219.04s: and your game plan was to manage your position
222.04s: based on a close below the 10 day moving average
226.16s: to take advantage of the short-term trend.
228.28s: Well, that keeps you in the trade,
231.24s: even though it goes through this bit of a drawback
233.40s: and even though now it's continuing to make money,
236.96s: the point is you don't have to pick a specific price.
241.00s: But you do need to identify spots
243.40s: where whatever your profit mechanism is
246.16s: is determined to be wrong.
248.36s: That's how you know when it's time to get out,
250.72s: both to the upside and to the downside
253.80s: because at some point, the momentum will slow down
257.40s: and the underlying will close below the 10 day MA.
260.92s: That's when the trade has ran its course
265.36s: and it's time to move on to something else.
269.76s: Okay, let's move on.
272.44s: Next up, over emphasizing the individual trade
276.48s: and for those keeping track at home,
278.04s: this is funny to be number two again, it's not.
283.32s: I'm just referring to an older video that I did
285.80s: where this just happened to come in as the second point twice.
290.44s: But let's talk about this as a concept
294.20s: and what it boils down to,
299.16s: your performance as a trader is going to come down
302.28s: not after an individual trade,
304.12s: 10 trades, 100 trades.
306.16s: If you're doing this successfully for a career
308.56s: or for your primary income source
310.24s: or even as a secondary income source,
313.08s: it is going to be done over thousands of trades,
316.04s: over hopefully decades.
318.72s: What that means is getting good feedback
321.60s: on what you're doing is more important
323.92s: than making money on any one individual trade.
327.00s: I know that might sound weird,
328.24s: but I'll explain it using this exact example
330.84s: we're just talking about.
332.16s: Let's say that your strategy
335.16s: called for going long here
337.28s: with the expectation of more this style movement, right?
340.96s: So this big massive green candle
342.68s: and then like a couple days trickling up on gaps.
347.04s: If this was your expectation
349.08s: and this is what you got, you were wrong.
353.12s: Even though if you bought those calls, let's say down here
357.20s: and let's say that you didn't sell during this
359.84s: or this, you're making money.
362.40s: But in that approach, you're making money
364.92s: for the wrong reasons.
366.52s: Now sometimes that can be okay,
369.04s: but as far as a feedback mechanism,
372.28s: as you're going through an analyzing
374.28s: what you're doing, how your strategies perform
376.84s: to then make decisions going forward,
380.44s: you now have a bad data point
382.44s: unless you accurately identify that,
385.44s: yeah, this one made money,
387.00s: but it's not for the right reason.
389.36s: It made money just because it happened to go up
391.44s: in a different way than I expected.
393.64s: This is really important to drill down
396.80s: and really nebulous to new traders
398.60s: because most new traders are just like,
399.92s: well, shit, I'm just happy to make money.
401.88s: Or like this person that's like,
403.88s: oh, I just wanna fix this one call and Disney
407.40s: because I don't wanna lose money on it.
408.84s: So here's some ways that I can do it.
411.84s: The issue with that is over time,
415.84s: your performance is a trader is gonna approximate
418.48s: towards your systems.
420.44s: If you have bad systems with bad feedback loops
423.84s: over time, you're gonna lose money.
425.96s: You have to avoid that.
428.72s: Each individual trade serves as a sample
433.08s: in the data collection of a strategy.
436.76s: The Realize P&L is a buy product.
440.12s: You want that Realize P&L to be positive long-term,
444.20s: but you also wanna know if what your strategy is doesn't work.
450.44s: So that then you can pivot and go do something else
454.04s: that's better.
455.56s: It saves you a ton of ways to time effort energy.
459.80s: This dovetails off of exactly what we were just talking about.
464.36s: Now, to build on this a little bit,
470.00s: when you're collecting your data samples
472.08s: in terms of your P&L,
473.68s: you wanna pay really close attention
475.40s: to what happened against your thesis
479.16s: versus the Realize Move.
482.08s: So a great way to do that is actually
485.28s: to in your trade log have a section
488.68s: that's relative to signals, right?
491.04s: And you should make it really easy to run data
493.12s: analysis on in terms of the inputs.
495.64s: But if you do that, then you'll be able
498.72s: to generate good feedback separate from the P&L.
502.36s: Because your P&L is not the only feedback that matters.
506.16s: It's the one that we ultimately prioritize for sure.
509.60s: But in short-term timeframes,
511.80s: it can be really, really misleading.
514.16s: This is also really common in the world
516.96s: of selling when volatility is high.
519.92s: What traders will do is to look at something like O&DS,
523.84s: and let's just pretend that the implied volatility
526.48s: percentile was really high, right now it's only 38.
528.80s: But let's say that it was really high.
530.96s: A lot of times, traders will say,
533.36s: oh, the implied volatility percentile is really high,
536.40s: and they'll sell vol.
538.68s: However, they're just, let's say, selling puts.
544.32s: A lot of times, they might make money,
547.48s: but if we actually looked at what happened to volatility,
551.88s: it might not have actually changed that much.
554.36s: And they might have just made money
555.76s: because the underlying went up.
558.68s: So again, what is that give them
560.92s: if they're just looking at their P&L?
562.68s: They're saying like, oh, this idea made money.
565.08s: But again, as far as their ability to detect
568.08s: and capture high implied volatility,
570.92s: this did not give them any good feedback
574.44s: on their ability to do that.
575.88s: So then as they try to do that more and more times
579.12s: in the future, again, their performance
582.76s: is gonna start to suck.
585.12s: The last thing, this one is really straightforward.
588.52s: But there's two pieces to hyperactive management.
592.00s: The first one is the cost.
595.52s: Everybody knows that there's commissions.
597.56s: One of the simplest things you should do
599.96s: is track your commissions relative
602.80s: to the average trade P&L.
606.40s: So what that means is, look at your year-to-date performance.
611.40s: Then just take a look at what the average P&L
614.64s: of that is per trade.
617.72s: Then take a look at your commissions relative to that.
621.12s: This will give you a ton of context.
623.76s: And I'll give you a quick example.
626.96s: Just made a little table for you guys.
628.72s: Let's say that you made $250,000.
631.36s: And let's say that your commissions are 25 cents per option.
636.92s: Let's say that you have two scenarios,
639.12s: a trader that made that $250,000 over a thousand trades
642.96s: or a trader that did it with $10,000.
644.92s: Think of the $10,000 being the kind of trader
647.48s: that might be doing intraday scalping
650.32s: where they're having multiples of trades
652.36s: on an individual day typically low average P&L per trade.
656.64s: You can see that represented here.
659.08s: If we take a look at what their total commissions are relative,
662.24s: the $1,000 trades is at $250,000.
664.24s: The $10,000 is at $2,500.
666.76s: If we take a look at the commission to your P&L,
670.72s: this first trader is experiencing about 25% friction commission
676.60s: total per trade.
679.28s: This isn't an apples to apples comparison
682.32s: because this is comparing your total commissions
685.48s: against individual trades.
688.28s: Don't necessarily want to take that too literally.
691.92s: This is designed though to give you context
695.36s: in terms of what your commission's look like
698.64s: in total against your individual trade basis.
703.08s: Because something like this would immediately inform me
707.32s: that we are doing way too much and not getting enough
711.24s: on a per trade basis in terms of the total friction induced.
715.04s: Now again, you could do this on a per trade basis.
717.56s: That's also completely fine
718.76s: and that's more of a like comparison.
721.08s: This just blows out the numbers a little bit
723.80s: so that you can identify hopefully inefficiencies
726.64s: when you carry this down to individual strategies.
729.48s: Because the next question is taking this total commission
733.56s: but then not doing it necessarily per trade
735.96s: but per strategy, that's really where you want to get.
739.64s: But this is a good starting point
741.60s: to help identify some of those inefficiencies.
744.88s: The last piece of this is you make doing what you did
750.20s: a nightmare going forward,
753.60s: replicating this hyperactive management.
756.68s: So let's say in the case of this call
762.56s: for this person that owned Disney
765.36s: and with this short call that they sold,
770.44s: could they navigate so that that short call ends up
774.88s: and ends up out of the money,
776.32s: they get to keep their premium
777.64s: and they get to get the keep their stock.
779.68s: Sure, that's definitely doable.
781.88s: But what does that teach them about their strategy long term
787.72s: and their way that they're selling calls not very much?
790.92s: Now I'm not saying you shouldn't do what you need to do
793.96s: to manage an individual trade you should.
797.08s: But you should always think about it in the context
800.36s: of how can I use this as a data point
802.88s: to make what I'm doing more efficient,
805.48s: better, over, longer, durations.
809.28s: So in this scenario that I outlined,
812.40s: the traders ability to replicate that
814.60s: with this specific strategy against that specific profit
817.56s: mechanism is really low.
819.72s: So then all of this ties together
821.96s: because if you notice a lot of volatility in your P&L,
825.84s: meaning each month you're kind of all over the place,
828.16s: it's because of shit like this.
829.88s: If you can dial this in, your P&L volatility
832.96s: will come in a lot and that leads to smoother sailing
837.80s: more profitability.
839.16s: Be an outlier, see you later.
