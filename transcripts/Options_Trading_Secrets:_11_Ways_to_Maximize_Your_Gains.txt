0.12s: option buyers that are unfamiliar will
2.56s: come in here and buy the '90s cuz they
4.32s: think they have to buy the option that
6.60s: the stock is going to go to it's not the
7.92s: case at all what's up outliers here are
10.20s: 11 options trading tips to make more
13.92s: money when trading options let's get
16.00s: straight into it the very first bucket
18.20s: of things we're going to talk about is
19.64s: how we can use options for information
23.04s: this is something that a lot of people
24.88s: Overlook and you can look at things like
27.40s: put call ratios implied volatility and
30.28s: the probabilities provided by options to
33.60s: come up with ideas for what you think
35.88s: something may or may not do so what does
37.52s: this look like put call ratio
39.84s: specifically gives us an idea of the
42.40s: number of puts transacted relative to
46.24s: calls normally we will see more puts
50.60s: than calls because people tend to hedge
52.68s: the downside but not always sometimes we
55.36s: will actually see calls have more open
58.16s: interest than puts that typically means
60.48s: that we're speculating upside move for
63.40s: one reason or another so put call ratio
66.04s: puts this into a simple context normally
68.92s: we will use the front expiration cycle
71.52s: the front primary expiration to provide
74.16s: this number sometimes we can use it just
76.84s: for the volume on an individual day it
79.48s: is completely dependent on your platform
81.60s: but here essentially we take the total
83.68s: number of puts divided by the total
85.68s: number of calls and in this case we can
87.88s: see that we actually have some pretty
89.64s: heavy call skew meaning in Walmart as it
92.92s: sits today people are speculating to the
95.60s: upside that's actually the second tool
98.36s: that we can use for information is this
100.40s: down here at the bottom in the platform
102.12s: different platforms will have different
103.44s: ways to display this but this is showing
105.40s: us total open interest it's showing us
108.48s: for calls and puts we can look at it in
111.52s: individual expiration Cycles we can look
114.48s: for it in different series to have ideas
117.68s: on how people are positioning in
119.12s: different time frames the other thing we
121.04s: can use here is implied volatility so we
123.60s: can use implied volatility for the
126.84s: product or the security itself in this
129.48s: case the implied volatility for Walmart
131.44s: is 23% now we can use something like ivp
135.36s: implied volatility percentile to put
137.16s: this into context of is this 23% implied
141.20s: volatility High relative to Walmart or
143.56s: low and in this case it's actually
145.36s: pretty high so what does this tell us
147.64s: well it means that we're expecting
149.88s: Walmart to have higher relative movement
152.64s: going forward and it doesn't really
154.08s: surprise us cuz we have earnings coming
155.68s: up on the 19th of next month so you can
158.76s: use implied volatility as an expectation
162.04s: of movement and then you can also use
164.48s: implied volatility percentile to
166.84s: understand if we're expecting more or
168.52s: less movement relative to the individual
171.48s: security that you're looking at the
173.60s: other thing you can use is implied
175.40s: volatility for different expiration
177.40s: Cycles it's the same exact concept but
180.04s: we get more specific so we can see that
182.28s: there are periods where implied
183.56s: volatility expands relative to other
186.56s: expiration cycles that tells us
188.88s: something is expected in that expiration
192.08s: cycle so you can use options to gain a
195.44s: lot of information this is just the tip
197.12s: of the iceberg on that and that's just
198.60s: the tip of the iceberg if you ever want
200.60s: to explore these more in depth just let
202.52s: me know and we'll take a look now I do
204.44s: want to talk about probabilities cuz
205.84s: that's one of the coolest Parts about
207.28s: options so let's say that you wanted to
208.84s: put on a trade in wal walart and let's
210.68s: say that you want to be bullish you just
212.32s: think Walmart's going to go up and
213.44s: you're doing your technical analysis and
215.32s: you think Walmart might go to $84 for
217.68s: whatever reason we actually can use
219.76s: options to see what's the probability of
222.20s: Walmart hitting $84 options markets are
225.52s: highly highly informed and there's a few
227.76s: ways we can do it we can either use the
229.96s: options chain itself so I can say what's
232.64s: the probability of Walmart hitting that
234.48s: 84 handle within the next 26 days I can
237.28s: come in here I can go to something close
239.48s: to the 84 call there isn't one so we
241.72s: would just use the 85 and we can look at
243.84s: literally the probability of a touch the
246.12s: probability of a touch is what is the
248.08s: probability of the underlying touching
250.04s: that strike sometime before expiration
252.04s: and right now it's priced at 42% and the
255.32s: probability of it expiring in the money
257.12s: is
257.92s: 21.5% so this is the probability of
260.60s: Walmart closing above in this case 85 in
264.44s: 26 days so option markets are highly
267.84s: informative and you can use it to come
269.84s: up with ideas even for a directional
272.08s: assumption even if you're not looking to
274.36s: trade options you can still use them for
276.36s: information the other thing you can do
278.56s: is if your platform has it some of them
280.56s: will have these probability projections
282.96s: now this uses one standard deviation
284.76s: move as it's plotted here and this is
286.84s: right now looking at the probability of
288.40s: something being in the money and we can
290.52s: change this to be the probability of
292.32s: something touching a certain strike
294.08s: price this is really useful if you use
296.12s: stops or if you have a profit Target
297.80s: that you're planning on taking profit at
299.36s: and then on the xaxis we can see that
301.92s: this is just different days to
303.52s: expiration and it even highlights the
306.00s: expiration cycle so let's say we're
308.20s: interested in again trading Walmart we
310.28s: think it might hit 84 so what's the
312.40s: probability that it hits 84 by 25
315.36s: October well if we go in here and we
317.40s: take a look it's about 20% chance now
319.60s: the cool part is if we go further out in
322.16s: time let's say that we have a 2-month
324.12s: thesis what's the probability of hitting
326.40s: 84 in the next 60 days well it's 74%
329.76s: chance so now you can quantify some of
332.56s: what you're doing whether you're trading
333.88s: options or not so they can provide a lot
335.88s: of information and as I said that's
337.28s: literally just a tip of the iceberg
338.80s: options provide leverage so you gain
341.12s: cheaper exposure to things and it's a
343.72s: way to amplify your returns so let's
346.04s: look at an example here if we go to the
347.80s: risk profile and we take a look and
349.64s: again we want to be long Walmart in this
351.40s: scenario if we buy 100 shares of Walmart
354.52s: you control 100 shares and you're going
357.04s: to pay $813
360.08s: however you can buy this call that's in
363.04s: 17 genan 2025 it's the
365.96s: 7667 call don't worry about the strike
368.08s: price here I'm just using something
369.48s: that's slightly in the money this costs
372.00s: $700 and this provides up to the same
376.40s: exposure as those long shares except
378.52s: instead of paying
379.80s: $813 you're paying $700 that's leverage
382.56s: at work so that seems like a really
384.44s: sweet deal why wouldn't we always use
386.32s: this forever and it leads us into this
389.20s: next component which we're going to
390.32s: bounce back and forth between these all
392.36s: options expire and they Decay so the
395.52s: reason why sometimes shares might be a
397.92s: smarter play is if you're planning on
399.28s: holding something for multi-year periods
401.16s: your options are going to expire so
403.08s: there's a Time bound element now to our
405.76s: ideas now there's also a relationship
409.24s: options that are further out in time are
411.44s: going to be more expensive than options
414.88s: that are closer to expiration that's
417.20s: just simply because there's more time in
418.60s: the contract but but options that are
420.84s: near in time will actually have some
423.76s: other effects like heightened gamma
426.52s: which is the rate of change of Delta so
428.92s: gamma tells us how fast the Delta of an
431.28s: option is going to change and as you
433.64s: know if you follow the options 10 one
435.68s: series anything like that as options get
437.52s: close to expiration their Delta is going
439.52s: to be either a zero or a one so both
442.04s: Delta and Gamma get very active as we
444.52s: get closer and closer to expiration so
446.68s: what does that mean well you have to
448.44s: figure out what makes sense for you
450.08s: whether you're buying or selling an
452.28s: option if you sell maybe you want
454.36s: something that could have a little bit
456.12s: more time for more extrinsic value but
458.40s: if you go further out in time you might
460.00s: actually notice that it has a lower
462.04s: Theta Theta Decay picks up as you get
465.24s: with in 60 DTE so why does that matter
468.52s: well it tells me that if I'm buying
470.28s: options I actually might want to go
472.08s: greater than 60 DTE even if I'm not
474.56s: planning to hold it to expiration it's a
476.64s: common misconception you don't have to
478.28s: take it to expiration you can trade
479.96s: something like I do all the time and
481.68s: come out to like this 89 DTE and then
484.00s: after 3 weeks pass I can close the trade
486.44s: down but what I'm doing by going further
488.40s: out in time here is I'm decreasing my
490.20s: Theta this is if I'm buying the option
492.96s: it's totally up to you if I'm selling an
494.80s: option I actually want more Theta Decay
497.32s: but if you're selling an option and you
499.00s: come too close in time you're also going
501.32s: to get more gamma so you have to find
502.88s: the balance that's right for you so the
505.72s: other thing to keep in mind when trading
508.28s: options is you can be right and wrong at
511.52s: the same time this trips a lot of
512.92s: Traders up what does that mean well
514.60s: unless you are hedging for direction
516.96s: gamma hedging Delta hedging then you
519.00s: have exposure to these different profit
521.28s: factors now the dominant profit factor
523.76s: or impact to your option is going to be
525.96s: Direction almost always again unless you
528.52s: are hedging your Deltas then you're
530.40s: isolating another one of these variables
532.20s: and there's more than this to be clear
533.60s: these are just the primary ones so if
535.60s: you sell an iron Condor people do that
538.76s: for kind of a a neutral play which looks
541.04s: like this most people think that they're
543.72s: going to make money from IV Contracting
547.16s: and that's one of the ways you can make
548.60s: money here however the main thing that
550.96s: has to happen is price has to stay
553.76s: within your strikes that's how this
555.96s: trade makes money so even though you
558.00s: might have a directional bias in terms
560.08s: of not wanting to see a lot of movement
562.08s: it doesn't matter even if implied
564.48s: volatility does contract if you get big
566.84s: movement in One Direction you still lose
569.16s: so this is still very directional in
571.60s: nature even though a lot of people put
573.28s: this on thinking that they're
574.52s: directionally neutral they're not this
576.88s: needs to remain within a range that's a
580.56s: directional disposition and again unless
582.44s: you're hedging the Deltas away as it
584.84s: moves you still have a directional
586.28s: disposition so that's an example where
588.44s: let's say implied volatility contracts
590.24s: on your iron Condor that would help your
592.00s: trade but if price moves up as it's
594.24s: doing that too far you still lose so
596.44s: your hypothesis was correct implied
598.20s: volatility might go down but your
599.60s: direction input was off so you have to
601.64s: always keep in mind what impacts your
604.04s: option and the majority of the time it's
605.60s: going to be Delta primarily even if
607.48s: you're directionally neutral in your
609.16s: thesis it still is going to be the
610.96s: dominant impact in most cases implied
613.20s: volatility via Vega time via Theta these
616.16s: become secondary inputs because for
618.64s: example another great scenario here to
621.00s: look at is let's say time passes and
623.84s: Walmart we can simulate time passing and
626.04s: Walmart doesn't move your iron Condor is
628.84s: looking being really really solid it's
630.76s: looking great well there's a problem
633.16s: that arises this is your profit rising
635.80s: in relation to your max profit but
638.48s: there's a problem here because even if
640.68s: time passes and you're making money
642.88s: because it's remaining range bound then
645.08s: if it starts to move even if you're up a
647.40s: bunch of money you can then lose all of
649.24s: it because again direction is going to
651.96s: be the primary input here so that
654.16s: applies if you're buying a call selling
656.40s: a call selling a put buying a put Buy
659.52s: straddles strangles iron Condors all of
661.88s: it is going to have a massive
663.40s: directional component via Delta that you
665.64s: have to pay very close attention to
667.32s: things like changes in implied
668.92s: volatility are temporary going back to
671.28s: this same example another time let's say
673.84s: again that we think implied volatility
676.24s: is going to go down and let's say
677.60s: implied volatility doesn't go down let's
679.88s: say it actually goes up well that would
681.80s: temporarily hurt us but as long as price
684.92s: remains within this range this would
686.80s: still be profitable regardless of what
689.36s: what implied volatility does it's a
691.84s: secondary input same thing with respect
694.24s: to time time as time passes like I
696.80s: showed you in the example just before
698.16s: this time can pass but then if before
700.84s: expiration there's a directional move
703.28s: that will impact your Deltas you can
704.92s: still lose on your trade even if a bunch
707.36s: of time passes so for vast majority of
709.80s: Trades this is going to be your dominant
712.12s: input the last thing that I want to
713.76s: highlight here that I see is a really
715.40s: really common mistake especially for
717.12s: option buyers is I see option buyers
720.76s: commit two things that really hurt them
723.32s: the first one is option buyers tend to
725.52s: stay closer in time because it's cheaper
727.72s: you don't have to do that you can go
729.60s: further out in time but plan to close it
732.68s: earlier so even though you're laying out
735.00s: a larger amount of money upfront you're
737.64s: expecting to recoup most of it even if
740.80s: it doesn't go in your direction that's
742.40s: the first thing now again doesn't always
744.40s: work out like that if you get a really
746.00s: big directional move that's the wrong
747.92s: side of the trade then you can lose a
750.20s: lot more money than if you buy a cheaper
751.88s: option but if your analysis is good your
754.00s: trade management is good by going
755.56s: further out in time you give the trade a
757.28s: little bit more time to work in your
758.96s: favor the other thing I see option
760.88s: buyers do is they buy the strike that
763.04s: they think the stock is going to go to
764.96s: so an example here is Walmart let's say
767.04s: we think Walmart is going to go up and
768.88s: we think it's going to go to 90 option
771.04s: buyers that are unfamiliar will come in
773.04s: here and buy the '90s cuz they think
774.92s: they have to buy the option that the
777.00s: stock is going to go to that's not the
778.20s: case at all in the example that I just
779.80s: showed you here if we take a look at
782.00s: this option that I bought which was the
783.92s: 7667 notice how if it goes to 90 I still
786.88s: make money even though I'm buying an
788.52s: option that's in the money there's a
790.32s: specific reason why I do this and if
792.36s: you're interested in learning more check
794.04s: out the video at the end of this video
795.80s: it'll pop up and it'll take you to a
797.40s: video about buying options smarter which
799.20s: will dive into all of this but just know
801.36s: that if you're an option buyer you don't
802.96s: need to buy the strike that you think
804.52s: the stock is going to go to as always if
806.20s: you need anything let me know be an
807.52s: outlier see you'all later
