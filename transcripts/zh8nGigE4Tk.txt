0.00s: What's up outliers? Quick market update specifically on GameStop.
4.28s: Actually, I'm going to start doing a few videos per week covering a couple different covered
9.80s: strangles that I trade. And as we discussed in the introduction videos specifically for
15.42s: GameStop, I have an allocation of the portfolio that I'm using to trade a covered strangle
21.48s: in GameStop. And then I also have other ones in some leverage DTFs. I bit for Bitcoin
26.02s: and those will be separate videos. So the goal for today is to walk you through some
29.98s: updates on the position as it sets you a quick overview of what seems to be going on in GameStop
36.94s: because how to really good day today, especially with the rest of the market showing as much
42.02s: weakness as it did, GameStop is genuinely showing market strength, which is very, very
49.38s: cool to see. So from a quick technical overview looking at a six month daily chart, that's
54.42s: what's up here now. We can see that it's been just kind of running up along this trend
60.38s: line for a little while now. And it's progressively posting higher lows and higher highs, which
68.90s: obviously is associated with an uptrend. Now one thing that does stick out to me when
74.46s: looking at GameStop specifically is this trend line is really steep. What I do for things
80.90s: like this is I monitor the relationship between the trend line and the standard deviation
86.22s: channels or linear regression channels, whichever I happen to have up at the time. And I look
90.78s: at the slope in comparison. The reason for that is because when we tend to see, I guess
96.78s: I tend to see these kinds of more aggressive moves, they generally will be followed by
103.94s: a period of consolidation. And the reason for that is this is a really aggressive growth
109.30s: trajectory. If we take a look from fall of last year, it was around 2053. And as it
116.38s: close today at 3337, that's a big move for just about any company over that time frame.
122.78s: So this isn't aggressive move. Now GameStop does tend to move a little bit more aggressively
127.26s: than other things that we might trade on a more regular basis. And to demonstrate that,
133.54s: though, I want you to take a look both at the average daily range and the average true
138.50s: range. Again, for a quick reminder, average daily range looks at the move of the day. And
145.50s: then average true range encompasses the overnight gaps between days. So the five day average
153.68s: daily range is 6.47%. The 20 days 6.6. And then the 90 day is 5.98. So about six. What
162.46s: I'm showing you is that this has become slightly larger ranges as we get shorter on our
171.14s: time frame that we're looking at that tends to show a little bit of volatility entering
175.70s: the picture. This isn't significant because the difference between the 90 day and the
179.58s: five day isn't massive. But still that's something I pay attention to. And then the
183.84s: same thing when I look at a 90 day average true range, which is 4.65% against the five
190.82s: day, which is 6%. So this is demonstrating that very clearly the near term time frame
196.72s: is more volatile from both a price general trend perspective, but then also from an actual
204.62s: daily price movement perspective as well. So there's not a whole lot to take away from
210.66s: that other than bolstering the fact that this is continuing to be an ideal candidate for
215.34s: something like the coverage strangle, which if you're not familiar with what that strategy
218.54s: is, I encourage you to check out the video in the description below. That's the introduction
223.22s: to this series. So they have an idea of what I'm going to be talking about in a minute.
227.46s: So the implied volatility is 117% very, very high and on a relative basis, 58%. So also
233.86s: relatively high on a relative basis. So it tells me that we're still seeing pretty significant
243.50s: volatility, even though there's not a whole lot coming up like right now. Obviously,
248.54s: we will be coming into earnings in a couple months, but we still have a bit of time before
252.26s: we get there. So this is a little interesting that it's that volatile with not a whole lot
259.78s: on the radar right now. We can see that the 17 Jan 25 expiration is at 140.6% vol and
267.70s: then it dumps after that 123, 124. This is the market telling us something is going on
272.78s: here. I don't know what it is. I can't see it right now, but I can tell you that the
276.50s: market is telling you something is going on here. So it's something to be aware of. Maybe
280.50s: you all know there might be an announcement coming out. I haven't looked too far into
284.62s: it yet. I'm still getting caught up from coming back from traveling and whatnot. So I haven't
289.06s: done a bunch of deep dives on the typical names. I follow. Maybe you can get me schooled
293.14s: up, but something's going on. I can tell you that the market is pricing something in.
296.38s: So that's kind of the cool part again about options trading is that you don't necessarily
300.50s: have to know the details of everything to be able to see that something's going on,
305.14s: which is clearly the case here. Now, Calls Q is huge. 896,900 calls against 278,000
318.26s: puts. That's massive. That's almost a three time variance between these. It is essentially
324.46s: three times variance between these. Normally, this will hover around two. So there is
330.18s: undoubtedly a lot of action coming into the call side. And I want you to notice the
337.82s: colors of these little rectangles. You see how they're like that neon blue that neon
342.34s: blue is 17 jam. The same expiration that seems to have really high IV. So one of the reasons
351.34s: why 17 Jan might have elevated IV compared to the others, at least part of it will be because
358.42s: of this because there's so many options in that expiration on a relative basis. Let's
363.26s: take a look. 17 Jan has over half of that options chain. So if we look at all series,
371.90s: there's 897. And if we take a look at 17 Jan by its very self, it's 477. So that tells
382.06s: you a lot. And that's absolutely going to be a contributing factor is to why we see
387.58s: this being as elevated. Now it might be confusing because the colors change when I flip back
391.62s: and forth, but now it's the purple that is 17 Jan. So I find that generally interesting.
397.94s: Now let's talk about the trade that's sitting right now after some adjustments today. And
405.34s: I want to walk you through what I did and why now. First things first, following up on
411.14s: I got to move this over a little bit so you could see here. So following up on the stream
416.34s: from Saturday, when we did the GME stream, I had asked what allocation should we use? I originally
423.46s: had earmarked $15,000 because from prior conversations that seemed to have been closer to like
430.90s: an average game stop holding size. And then when I did the poll on this Saturday, it was 25K was
438.66s: a little over half of the submissions for people. So I've bumped up the allocation to 25K.
446.42s: And I'll continue to modulate this as we go. But one note I want to make abundantly clear,
452.66s: the base position that I originally started using, I'm not going to continue pulling from my
458.26s: existing shares. So I want to explain this to you. Right now, if you just pretend over here,
464.34s: I have a bucket of game stop shares relative to my overall portfolio that's by and
470.10s: hold designs just sit there. For this exercise, what I've done is grab a portion of this. And this
478.82s: is the allocation that I'm using. So the 200 shares are part of this broader holding that I've
488.10s: alluded to before. But when I'm manipulating this going forward like today, I am not going to
495.94s: continue tapping into this existing pool of shares because that doesn't represent the actual
501.54s: strategy and what it would be like to actually run the strategy as of today. So for example,
507.78s: when I bought the 100 shares today in game stop at 3223, I've added more. This is a net new
516.98s: add to the portfolio. So I just wanted to be really clear as we're going forward. This was pulling
521.62s: from a portion of an existing holding. Everything going forward from here is going to be whether we're
527.94s: adding or subtracting based on what's actually happening today. And that's just so it's more
532.58s: efficacious for you to follow along, right? Because if somebody's trying to figure out what I'm doing,
536.34s: they're like, well, I don't have shares like this to be able to pull from, which I understand.
541.30s: It wouldn't be a great example. So I'm just clearly delineating that this was just to start the
547.86s: position. And then everything going forward now will be added or subtracted just as I would
555.22s: on a standard open market. So all that being said, that takes our current holdings to 300 shares
562.42s: at 2695. I'm actually not super jazzed to buy a bunch of shares here. But I need to scale up.
570.02s: So that is what it is. And when I say that, you can see originally I was configured for $15,000.
577.62s: So I think the utilization was like 12 or 13K. But now we're at 17K. And I need to move this up
585.78s: just a little bit more, which I'm going to explain how I've done that through this here.
591.38s: So we are 67.5% utilized. The base position fee shares is set. And we have two different
602.34s: explorations now of short puts. These are cash secured. We have the 21 Feb, 28. We have two of those.
612.02s: And we have the 10 Jan, which is this Friday, the 32s. So notice the difference between these two.
620.82s: This is literally a 3DTE trade against, I think this is using different years. That's probably
626.34s: why it's confused. Yes. So this would be 24s when it was entered. That will fix that. And you can see
634.74s: this is really short term. And it's also a much higher delta. I entered this one at a 25 delta,
639.54s: entered this one at 44 delta. What am I doing here? I'm actually trying to get assigned.
643.54s: I'm putting on a trade that is essentially at the money with the expectation of getting assigned.
649.22s: That's the game plan right now. So if we flow into expiration and I get assigned on these, great.
655.62s: If I don't, that's okay. I'm going to lay them out for the next week at the money again.
660.42s: And this is a way for me to receive a pretty healthy premium relative to the time frame,
665.86s: right? Because take a look. This is giving me $2.87 per contract for a 52-day trade. This is
672.42s: giving me 95 cents for a 3-day trade. But it's because it's such a higher delta.
677.70s: So on a relative basis, this is paying me really, really well. And this goes back to that example.
682.42s: I was just giving you, we go back here to this up here. The volatility is very high. So that's why
689.78s: I'm not buying the shares outright. As I typically would, I did already to start scaling up.
696.42s: Because I was grossly underscaled. But instead of buying 200 shares or 300 shares,
701.70s: I chose to buy 100 shares and then sell at the money puts with the intention of getting assigned,
708.50s: but I'm going to capitalize on the volatility until that happens. And then we will continue to play
714.50s: the game. Now, the other thing I'm going to do is probably sell one more short call.
720.34s: So I have 300 shares and I only have one short call. So it's a 3-1 ratio, which is about good for
728.10s: a longer term holding. For something like this, I really want to capitalize on this volatility while
734.90s: it's here. So to do that, I will ratchet up that ratio a little bit. So it'd be at a 2-3 or 3-2,
741.70s: depending on what you're looking at first, shares 3-2. So I would have 300 shares against two short
746.34s: calls, maximum 200 short sales. And the intention is not to get assigned on those short calls. So they
752.58s: would be managed against the long shares via aggressive management, meaning I'm paying close
758.66s: attention to it. I'm not just letting it go and seeing what happens so that I don't get assigned.
763.46s: The risk is that I could get assigned early. That is a thing, especially if something like GameStop
769.94s: squeezes while I'm in doing this. And I have short calls. There is absolutely a potential for
776.02s: somebody that's being squeezed that has those calls to exercise them early. That's the risk that I
781.30s: run and that's why I'm not trading it at a 1-1 ratio. I don't want to unwind the whole position.
785.78s: I don't even want to unwind 2-3. But I want to make sure that I'm trading in and out of this thing
792.42s: so that we can generate as much money as we can based on where GameStop started the year,
796.90s: which I'm going to track right here. And we will see how we are able to progress.
804.02s: So far, the trade is performing really, really well where on a return on an invested capital
809.54s: standpoint, meaning we're using this 16-8 for the basis, it's returning really well. We were
816.74s: sitting on a total P&L of 3 grand on again, total allocation of now 25K. It was 15K.
826.90s: Right before this. So this really is starting to progress pretty well. And it's perfect for this
833.22s: kind of market that we're seeing in GameStop. Really high-vol, not massive price movements yet.
838.90s: And that is the game plan going forward. So my hope is to continue sharing updates like this.
844.10s: I hope it's useful. And as I'm doing these, if you have questions, please ask. It's the entire
849.38s: purpose of me doing this. I already know what I'm doing. I know how to do all this stuff. It's what I do
854.26s: for a living. So this is really to try and share some of the skill set of options trading with
861.22s: the GameStop community just to give you more tools. Not saying this is the right way. This
865.30s: again, to be very clear, is not exactly how I would trade this in a nutshell. I have other things
870.50s: that I do in something like GameStop specifically volatility-related or more directional plays using
876.18s: single options with kickers and stuff like that. But those are different strategies. This I chose
881.38s: for this series because it's based around a buy and hold position, which I think most people
889.86s: that trade GameStop like to maintain something like that. So I thought it was relevant.
894.10s: If you have any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
