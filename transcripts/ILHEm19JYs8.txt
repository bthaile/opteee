0.00s: So wall of red, a little bit of blood letting out there today.
4.52s: Let's talk about the market.
6.48s: I want to walk through high level overview of what this is and how to think about it.
13.36s: Because there are a lot of similarities with what I'm seeing driving this kind of sell
19.88s: off.
21.08s: As you can tell, a lot of these bigger boxes that happen to also be quite red fall within
27.88s: tech.
29.60s: So this does not surprise me.
31.64s: If we go over here to the NASDAQ to get a little closer and see what's happening, we
37.48s: had Google report their earnings and it wasn't as good as the market would have liked to
44.60s: have seen.
45.60s: They're losing ad revenue.
46.60s: It's slowing down.
48.48s: And things of that nature were getting this sense that potentially a lot of this AI
54.56s: craze might be slowing down a little bit.
57.48s: So if we take a look at Nvidia, you can see that they're definitely down over 6.8%
64.84s: today.
65.84s: So and it's still kind of hovering right around 1114.
70.68s: So what this tells me is not that the sky is crashing that the world is over.
75.16s: This just kind of tells me that things got priced a little frothy and now some of that
81.04s: is being blown off the top as people are taking some profits here.
84.56s: Now this is something to keep close eye on because these kinds of moves while not anything
90.04s: that's make me nervous yet, they can become something that makes me nervous.
95.60s: So what I'm looking for is any sort of continuation, meaningful continuation to the downside.
101.48s: Because when I look across stuff like this down here, our net highs lows for a general
106.92s: breadth indicator, you can see that this doesn't look all that bad.
112.08s: We do see net highs.
114.52s: And within the NASDAQ, we are seeing a little bit of acceleration on gross lows and a little
122.84s: bit of deceleration in gross highs.
125.64s: But we're still maintaining that highs.
127.88s: So what this tells me is that there are a few names like Nvidia that are really leading
133.04s: this downward movement.
134.64s: And again, the market got so exuberant about trying to price an AI.
140.76s: This is one of the things that leads to opportunities in markets is that it's not a instantaneous
147.12s: ingestion of accurate pricing based on new information.
151.40s: So you can see that there's this big, big rally, essentially most of the year, if we zoom
156.68s: this out to a year to date, look at what this has done.
158.64s: It's gone from 47 on a split adjusted basis to 140.
163.36s: It's a tremendous move.
166.40s: And a lot of this is predicated on people not wanting to miss the AI rally train.
170.92s: They think that they're getting in late.
173.24s: And you can see where most people got in year to date was down here kind of at the 89
177.40s: and a half handle.
179.08s: But if we zoom this in, you'll notice that this will start to scoot up as more and more
183.20s: people are entering the party late.
186.48s: And that causes a problem because there's a lot of people that entered the party in here
191.48s: that aren't necessarily really happy with things are going, right?
195.28s: And this is a tale as old as time itself in the markets where people just dog pile into
203.36s: things hoping that it's going to go up.
206.48s: And it doesn't necessarily always mean it's going to continue, especially when you price
211.52s: and stuff that aggressively essentially, everything has to execute near perfectly in order
216.36s: for there to be no issues, no market pushback.
219.08s: So none of this surprises me.
222.68s: It seems almost overdue in my opinion, but I mean, who am I to say when it's due?
228.44s: I'm just a dude.
229.84s: But there's just something I've been thinking about for some time now.
233.20s: And it's something that's been on my radar, especially as you start seeing the moving
236.00s: averages all start to get super congested like this.
239.20s: Yeah, you got to be careful with the risk is what that boils down to.
242.80s: So that's broadly what I'm seeing across the market within the tech sector for a little
247.56s: while the Russell was kind of the only little bit of strength we saw.
251.56s: It was actually up for a little bit today.
255.20s: And then it just joined that downward party move, which funny enough, I was stopped out
262.24s: yesterday after the close.
264.72s: So I was flat in here, although I really have been enjoying the rut trade.
269.32s: So I wanted to get back in, but today was more of just a watch kind of day.
274.24s: So that's actually what I'm doing right now.
275.48s: Making some alerts to keep my eyeballs on it is it starts to move outside of these range
279.20s: bound phases here.
280.96s: Hopefully continuing to the upside.
282.96s: It's still technically showing ever so slight moderate strength compared to the S&P,
287.40s: but the NASDAQ is really what's driving us down.
290.92s: And then as I look across the sectors, it's generally blood in the street.
294.88s: We have XLE, which is hanging in there just a little bit better than some of the others
298.52s: in XLE who's actually enjoying a little bit of an update here.
302.08s: And then XLV and even bigger up day.
304.76s: So if you're looking for areas of strength that continue to persist, this is exactly what
310.72s: I do.
311.72s: And these are the kind of products that I start looking at that tend to be a bit more
315.48s: defensive in nature.
317.76s: And they tend to perform pretty well in that format.
320.88s: So that's kind of the broad market scenario here.
325.44s: Now I do want to pivot over, take a quick look at GameStop.
329.28s: It's another generally quiet day.
331.24s: So when I look at this, a big thing I'm trying to keep an eye on is how is price behaving,
337.04s: especially as we get near this point of control.
339.20s: And we're now firmly below it.
341.24s: We actually just closed below the 50 day moving average.
345.92s: So I don't love that.
346.92s: I actually adjusted my position because of the movement today.
349.96s: I still have a small position on, but I've paired down a lot of it.
353.96s: And it's now a waiting game for me.
355.60s: As you can see, I have a couple of alerts set that I want to see how it behaves beyond
359.76s: a few different levels.
361.56s: So the first of this one has two alerts kind of baked in.
363.84s: There's one right there and then one right at the bottom of this, like right there, just
368.16s: for context.
369.64s: And so far it's just kind of slowly meandering, but not in necessarily a positive direction.
377.96s: We did see an expansion in volume today, but the majority of it being sale volume.
384.24s: So you can see that again, represented in the candle that you see, it's just kind of
388.32s: this relatively on this scale, a larger red candle.
394.86s: So it looks like people are selling.
397.16s: I mean, I am wound some of my position today.
399.24s: So I'm part of that.
400.64s: I still have, again, part of the position on via shares and I do have some short calls
405.80s: against it still.
407.04s: I took the short calls from yesterday down because they paid out today.
411.20s: And I put some new stuff out a little closer in time because it doesn't look like I'm adding
414.84s: my options positions as quickly as I thought I might have been, which is part of how this
419.88s: whole thing goes.
421.92s: So let's take a look at what we're seeing from a volume perspective.
425.44s: I see 167,000 calls versus 70,000 puts.
429.72s: So by all of chords, a quiet, a quiet day.
435.72s: Typically we're seeing volume on the call side over 200,000 easy put side about that.
441.64s: Most of the call volume is in 26 July for usual.
446.52s: And then we are seeing more and more and more positions building out into this 16-Aug
452.40s: expiration cycle, which again, that does not surprise me.
454.88s: I would continue to expect to see that trend.
457.48s: Actually, if we take a quick look at the breakdown between that, 70,800 in this front
462.44s: expiration, 34,000 is about half of it are out in 16-Aug.
467.92s: And then two AUG is 29,000 calls.
472.88s: And then nine AUG is super quiet, 9,000 to 3,000 calls to puts respectively.
477.48s: So not much happening in a nine AUG yet.
480.04s: So my guess is this.
481.68s: We'll still continue to see positions being built out in 16-Aug slowly.
485.36s: We will continue to favor the front expiration.
488.24s: So then as this 26 July starts to come up and pass, then it'll probably rotate into
492.36s: the two AUG, into the nine AUG.
494.84s: But I still think over that entire time frame, you're going to see the 16-Aug building
498.28s: out more and more and more.
499.44s: That's just so far what I'm seeing.
502.40s: Now from a general trade perspective, there are a couple of positions that came through
508.24s: that were a little bit larger in size, but not a bunch.
512.28s: So I'm still seeing relatively quiet markets here.
517.36s: So this is looking at both bid and offer for both calls and puts for today.
523.00s: And I just want to see like, what's the premium that's trading?
525.20s: And it's all under $100,000.
527.52s: So nothing there that I would highlight as of supreme interest to me just yet.
532.96s: As you can tell, I'm here keeping an eyeball on it.
535.00s: When I start looking at stuff like this on a decide that I want to keep looking at it,
538.32s: I'm going to keep looking at it.
539.80s: So that's where I'm at.
540.80s: I'm waiting to see my new changes.
544.12s: And this is actually kind of useful for the way that the market is setting up now.
548.36s: It gets to a point where the premium, the volume, the size of the positions we see
553.64s: putting on, they're all kind of smaller here.
557.04s: So then when you see bigger positions, they stick out like sore thumbs.
560.80s: You can see them clearly today.
562.32s: So that is a really big benefit of the market here slowing down a little bit specifically
567.24s: for GME getting a little bit more quiet.
569.32s: So so far, that's what I got.
572.80s: As always, if there's anything you want me to take a look at, let me know.
575.44s: I'm doing a live stream on Saturday about game stop.
579.44s: My boy Newton is unable to make this week.
581.56s: He'll be back next week.
582.84s: So this one is just going to be me looking through the stock more in depth, really trying
586.20s: to pick up more of the history.
587.36s: So I'm going to be going through roaring kiddie's old videos, posts and stuff like that.
591.08s: So I'm actually going to lean on the chat pretty heavily to help me, you know, direct my attention
595.16s: to this stuff you guys think I should be learning about next.
597.16s: So if you're able to join, it's at 5 p.m.
599.32s: Same exact thing we'd be doing the last few weeks.
601.44s: So being outlier.
602.44s: See you guys later.
