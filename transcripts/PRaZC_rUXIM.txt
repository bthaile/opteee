0.00s: How to start trading without the BS?
1.92s: The goal of this video is to walk you through the exact advice I would give myself if I were to start trading again
8.32s: or if I could talk to myself back in 2007 when I first started trading.
20.56s: What?
21.28s: The idea here is to share the most pertinent details I think to get off to a good start
28.72s: because most people don't.
31.12s: I know I didn't.
32.08s: So this is an opportunity to learn from other people's mistakes.
35.12s: What's up everybody?
35.92s: Eric here.
36.32s: Welcome back to the outliers and shout out to the Patreon family.
39.04s: You guys make content like this possible for everybody else and let's get straight into it.
43.76s: So how to start trading?
45.28s: There's three things we're going to cover.
46.72s: We're going to cover motivations, landscape, and then the specific advice I would give myself.
51.28s: So what is motivation?
52.16s: Simple.
52.56s: Make money.
53.12s: That's why we trade.
54.48s: There are different kinds of money we want to make.
56.32s: Some of us want to make a whole bunch of money.
58.08s: Some of us just want to make enough income.
60.00s: Some of us want to be able to quit our nine to five.
61.84s: But that is the entire reason to start this.
63.92s: Why would I spend the time talking about this?
66.72s: Because this is a massively important psychological undertone
72.32s: that you have to be aware of as we go through this whole process.
75.44s: Because we all want to make money fast.
78.16s: There's a lot of desperation depending on your individual scenario to make enough money.
82.48s: There is a lot of psychological forces that impact this entire two-word line
88.40s: that you have to integrate into the rest of this conversation.
91.12s: So what's the landscape?
92.40s: Well, in short, there's two primary groups of people.
95.44s: There's retail traders, which is you and I.
97.20s: And then there's institutions.
98.24s: This is known as the smart money.
99.84s: These are the broker, broker dealers, market makers, hedge funds,
102.96s: pension funds, that da da da da.
104.24s: Here's the cut and dry.
105.76s: Retail has pretty much all disadvantages.
108.80s: There's a handful of very small advantages that we do have.
111.84s: But most of it is disadvantaged.
113.60s: We are competing in an insanely competitive space that we have no advantages in.
118.80s: So it is so important again to keep that in the back of your mind.
123.36s: Because if that's the case, how can we be successful?
127.52s: Well, that's kind of what we're going to talk about.
129.28s: But if you want to understand a little bit more about this retail versus
132.48s: institutions concept, I'll throw a link in the notes below.
135.36s: So you can check out a video that I did diving pretty deep into detail on this exact thing.
139.92s: So let's take a look at what this looks like for us because realistically,
143.20s: it's not good.
144.24s: Most traders lose.
146.24s: There are a lot of studies that elucidate this point.
148.80s: I'm not going to run through each one of them.
150.48s: And you might be thinking, Eric, why are you saying this if the idea is to talk about how to start
155.76s: trading? It is because I think the biggest mistake people can make is that they don't fully
160.72s: understand the landscape that they're stepping into, which has a lot of carry on negative effects.
165.44s: If you are going to climb Mount Everest, don't you want to know
169.04s: how difficult it is, how long it typically takes, what gear you need, all of those sorts of
173.36s: details so that you can then put in the right amount of research, the right amount of training,
178.08s: to ultimately be successful in conquer a very difficult endeavor.
182.88s: It is the same thing with trading, pretending as if this is easy.
186.16s: That with this one magic indicator, you can learn everything you need to know.
189.76s: It's all bullshit.
191.44s: There is no easy money out there.
194.32s: The sooner you can accept that, the sooner you can put into requisite amount of work in order
200.00s: to be successful. I make no mistake about it. I have spent thousands, literally tens of thousands
206.08s: of hours doing this. And it's because I became that committed over time, but I didn't necessarily
212.16s: start like that. So let's now talk about the specific advice.
216.16s: The very first thing I have here is to define the objectives that I have.
221.52s: So why does this matter so much? Well, first let's start with the why. Why do I care about
227.28s: trading? The reason I'm taking this step off to the side is because the reason why I'm interested
232.56s: in trading will directly impact the objectives of my trading. So what's the average net worth
238.56s: for the typical American? Well, if we take a look at this chart for my age group, which is 32,
244.24s: younger than 35, the average is $76,000. The median is $14,000. That's awful.
252.32s: And to kind of make this even worse, I grew up poor. I know what it's like to not have money.
260.24s: I know what it's like to stress over everything because you can't handle any surprise expenses
266.16s: that come up. I remember there were days that I would go to school without enough lunch money.
270.08s: And if it wasn't for the lunch ladies who took pity on me, literally pity that gave me food
275.28s: for free. I would not have eaten palkos. So the average person does not live a super lavish life.
282.96s: They live a pretty uncomfortable life. And if you look at even more statistics like the most common
287.52s: argument points between married couples, it's typically money. That's one of the biggest ones. So
291.52s: anyways, let's continue just understanding why this matters so much. If we look down here, the
297.20s: average annual expenditures for the US household is $73,000 compared to the average earnings in 2022,
303.92s: which is $94,000. We're not saving anything. So think about how long you would have to work in
310.08s: order to save up for a retirement. This entire concept just is so unappealing to me. The idea that
316.32s: you have to work 50 years in a job that you may or may not like. Hopefully you like it, but most
321.04s: people don't. To then just enjoy the last bit of your life. That sucks, man. Plus, I also had some
327.76s: bigger pressures weighing on me. I have a single mom that she sacrificed so much to try to raise me
333.44s: my brother's best she could. And I have to take care of her. That's an obligation that I've
337.44s: taken upon myself. I cover her expenses now because of the outcome of this stuff. But that is a big
343.04s: part of the motivation behind it. So let's take a look at how this all comes together. The why
348.56s: summarized. If I look at a compound growth calculator, which you can check out this exact one on my
355.36s: website, which I will link in the notes below, we can see that some good savings habits can make a
360.96s: giant difference. I started trading when I was in high school. So I was just tinkering with different
365.68s: numbers to see where I could get in what time frame. And I realized that from $20,000 starting
372.32s: amount, which that's not what I had. I literally had like $2,500. But I knew that I was going to go
376.72s: into the Marines as an officer. I knew that I was going to be able to save. So this is just part
380.40s: of my planning. I saw $20,000 with additional $750 on average, which ideally it would be more than
387.84s: this in the long run. But that's just on average. And when you first start your career, you're going to
391.92s: have a much smaller amount. You can save over 20 years at a 15% return. It yields $1.25 million.
399.92s: That's not too bad for becoming a millionaire before essentially or 40. I was able to greatly
406.16s: accelerate this by saving far more aggressively than this and having a much better return than this.
411.68s: But this is to share the power of trading.
421.20s: If you can be an outlier in one of those small groups of people that can make this work for you,
427.60s: you can drastically change your life. So with that as the why, let's talk about these objectives.
435.60s: Because this is where we get down to the details. This is where the rubber meets the road.
439.76s: So these are kind of the first primary objectives that I think traders should have when they first
446.00s: start out. This is exactly what I would tell myself. The very first one is to develop the skill set.
450.48s: The second thing is to avoid draw downs. Why avoid draw downs? Easy. If you take a look at this
456.72s: up here, which my editor will be kind enough to zoom in for you, you got it pal. You can see the
462.72s: impact of draw downs on these different portfolios. So if you can create consistent returns,
469.76s: you can increase your leverage logically. And by avoiding draw downs, you are not moving your
475.44s: starting point so far to the left. Because if you look at this side over here, the loss recovery,
480.96s: you'll see that big draw downs require big positive returns in order to compensate,
487.68s: inordinately large. And again, this is also on my website. If you want to download it so that
492.88s: you have it as a reference, I think these things are really important to keep in mind. Notice how I
497.36s: have saved here. Saving is so important. I cannot say it enough. This is probably your biggest
504.88s: determining factor. How successful you'll be early on. Because guess what? Your propensity to take
510.08s: a very small amount of money and to trade it into your future wealth is next to zero. Not impossible,
516.88s: but it is so improbable that to me, it wasn't worth my effort. So what was worth my effort was
523.60s: saving super aggressively. And then once we get through these three primary objectives,
529.44s: this is where you get to outline the rest of your objectives. For me, it was returned at least 15%
534.88s: per year. And then I set different draw downs specifications that I could withstand. So those are
539.84s: the primary objectives. This is the second thing I would say to myself after that, after we go
545.36s: through these objectives is how serious are you about this? Because trading is not a hobby. It is
553.28s: not a good hobby. This is one of the easiest ways to lose a bunch of money. If you are not dead set
561.20s: on making this work and fully applying yourself to see if you can make it work, just switch over to
566.16s: buy and hold. You can do great with that approach. You can still become a millionaire much earlier
571.60s: than if you don't do that, especially if you couple it with aggressively saving. Not as quickly as
576.16s: you can if you're a really good trader, but still quickly enough. And if you are not in the right
581.12s: mindset to take this seriously as you need to, your life literally, literally depends on it.
586.56s: So now we need to create a timeline. For me, this is what I would tell myself in year one
591.36s: paper trade that full first year. This is to assess our skill set, which we'll talk about later.
597.44s: Year two, the goal would be profitable. So this is when we start scaling in with real money and
602.64s: the only objective I have is to make money and avoid draw downs. Year three would be to pace the
607.68s: market. Year four year five is where we start outperforming the market. Year five plus is when we're
613.12s: getting super consistent in our work. So once we have the timeline, we have our objectives. Guess
619.04s: what you just started, whether you realize it or not, your trading plan. This is probably the most
624.08s: revolutionary thing that I integrated into my approach and hands down what I attribute my success
629.92s: to. I have a video in the notes below that goes through this in intimate details, like a 25 minute
636.00s: video. But the whole point of a trading plan and trading log is to create documentation so that
641.12s: you can test what works, validate with quantitative information and then over time refine your approach
646.96s: so that you can be more successful. Next up is super simple. Once this is all started, which
651.52s: literally can take a day. That's why it's listed out in this order. This should take about a day.
655.76s: It's something that will evolve over time, but it doesn't take a bunch of time. Start putting your
659.92s: money to work immediately, even just getting into buy and hold in the S&P 500, because if you go
665.28s: all the way back to the first thing, the whole impetus for starting to trade is to make money.
669.52s: So there's a sense of urgency, whether it's conscious or subconscious, it exists. So by doing this,
674.88s: while you're taking this first year to pay per trade, you're not wasting that time. There's not
680.00s: that psychological pressure that, oh, I have to figure this out super fast because you're putting
684.16s: yourself in a great spot. Your money is working and realistically, this is what most people should
690.32s: end up doing anyways in my opinion is this. So you're just getting started early. You don't have that
695.28s: same psychological pressure. Now, why do I think about paper trading for the first year and what I
700.56s: follow this myself? God, honest, probably not. I don't think I would. I think a realistic target would
705.36s: be to pay per trade at least for six months. That I think is reasonable. The whole reason why I
710.00s: talk so much about paper trading is because it is probably the most efficient way you can learn this.
715.04s: Early on, there are so many stupid mistakes you're going to make that there's no reason to start
721.52s: lighting money on fire because you're that impatient. You are not doing yourself any favors. You're
727.44s: not accelerating your time frame by starting trading real money too fast. You're not. The only thing
732.48s: you're going to do is lose money. And the only thing that does is slide your starting point back.
738.16s: Now, the critics will say, oh my God, this is the credit voice by the way. Oh my God, real trading is
744.40s: never replicable by paper trading. Yeah, no shit Sherlock, but that doesn't mean there's still not
749.52s: a ton of value to derive from paper trading. A lot of people will say it's not the same as real trading.
754.48s: It's not. It will never be fully the same. But if you can't take paper trading seriously because you
759.28s: lack that discipline, you're not going to magically grow discipline when real money's on the line.
763.68s: It's the worst possible way to think about trading. If you cannot take paper trading seriously,
769.28s: you have no business actually trading because that amount of work is requisite. You have to do it.
774.40s: So to summarize how I would start trading in a nutshell, define my objectives, create a reasonable
780.16s: timeline, start my trading plan with those first two bullet points, get my money into the S&P 500
785.28s: with this really, really, really aggressive savings rate month over month and then get into paper
790.56s: trading to start building that skill set, start building a data set that I can analyze and overall
796.08s: commit to the process because in order to succeed here, you have to be a statistical outlier.
803.20s: So that means you have to put in the work that others aren't willing to do. Be an outlier.
809.28s: I'll see you later.
