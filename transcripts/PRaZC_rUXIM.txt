 How to start trading without the BS? The goal of this video is to walk you through the exact advice I would give myself if I were to start trading again or if I could talk to myself back in 2007 when I first started trading. What? The idea here is to share the most pertinent details I think to get off to a good start because most people don't. I know I didn't. So this is an opportunity to learn from other people's mistakes. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to the outliers and shout out to the Patreon family. You guys make content like this possible for everybody else and let's get straight into it. So how to start trading? There's three things we're going to cover. We're going to cover motivations, landscape, and then the specific advice I would give myself. So what is motivation? Simple. Make money. That's why we trade. There are different kinds of money we want to make. Some of us want to make a whole bunch of money. Some of us just want to make enough income. Some of us want to be able to quit our nine to five. But that is the entire reason to start this. Why would I spend the time talking about this? Because this is a massively important psychological undertone that you have to be aware of as we go through this whole process. Because we all want to make money fast. There's a lot of desperation depending on your individual scenario to make enough money. There is a lot of psychological forces that impact this entire two-word line that you have to integrate into the rest of this conversation. So what's the landscape? Well, in short, there's two primary groups of people. There's retail traders, which is you and I. And then there's institutions. This is known as the smart money. These are the broker, broker dealers, market makers, hedge funds, pension funds, that da da da da. Here's the cut and dry. Retail has pretty much all disadvantages. There's a handful of very small advantages that we do have. But most of it is disadvantaged. We are competing in an insanely competitive space that we have no advantages in. So it is so important again to keep that in the back of your mind. Because if that's the case, how can we be successful? Well, that's kind of what we're going to talk about. But if you want to understand a little bit more about this retail versus institutions concept, I'll throw a link in the notes below. So you can check out a video that I did diving pretty deep into detail on this exact thing. So let's take a look at what this looks like for us because realistically, it's not good. Most traders lose. There are a lot of studies that elucidate this point. I'm not going to run through each one of them. And you might be thinking, Eric, why are you saying this if the idea is to talk about how to start trading? It is because I think the biggest mistake people can make is that they don't fully understand the landscape that they're stepping into, which has a lot of carry on negative effects. If you are going to climb Mount Everest, don't you want to know how difficult it is, how long it typically takes, what gear you need, all of those sorts of details so that you can then put in the right amount of research, the right amount of training, to ultimately be successful in conquer a very difficult endeavor. It is the same thing with trading, pretending as if this is easy. That with this one magic indicator, you can learn everything you need to know. It's all bullshit. There is no easy money out there. The sooner you can accept that, the sooner you can put into requisite amount of work in order to be successful. I make no mistake about it. I have spent thousands, literally tens of thousands of hours doing this. And it's because I became that committed over time, but I didn't necessarily start like that. So let's now talk about the specific advice. The very first thing I have here is to define the objectives that I have. So why does this matter so much? Well, first let's start with the why. Why do I care about trading? The reason I'm taking this step off to the side is because the reason why I'm interested in trading will directly impact the objectives of my trading. So what's the average net worth for the typical American? Well, if we take a look at this chart for my age group, which is 32, younger than 35, the average is $76,000. The median is $14,000. That's awful. And to kind of make this even worse, I grew up poor. I know what it's like to not have money. I know what it's like to stress over everything because you can't handle any surprise expenses that come up. I remember there were days that I would go to school without enough lunch money. And if it wasn't for the lunch ladies who took pity on me, literally pity that gave me food for free. I would not have eaten palkos. So the average person does not live a super lavish life. They live a pretty uncomfortable life. And if you look at even more statistics like the most common argument points between married couples, it's typically money. That's one of the biggest ones. So anyways, let's continue just understanding why this matters so much. If we look down here, the average annual expenditures for the US household is $73,000 compared to the average earnings in 2022, which is $94,000. We're not saving anything. So think about how long you would have to work in order to save up for a retirement. This entire concept just is so unappealing to me. The idea that you have to work 50 years in a job that you may or may not like. Hopefully you like it, but most people don't. To then just enjoy the last bit of your life. That sucks, man. Plus, I also had some bigger pressures weighing on me. I have a single mom that she sacrificed so much to try to raise me my brother's best she could. And I have to take care of her. That's an obligation that I've taken upon myself. I cover her expenses now because of the outcome of this stuff. But that is a big part of the motivation behind it. So let's take a look at how this all comes together. The why summarized. If I look at a compound growth calculator, which you can check out this exact one on my website, which I will link in the notes below, we can see that some good savings habits can make a giant difference. I started trading when I was in high school. So I was just tinkering with different numbers to see where I could get in what time frame. And I realized that from $20,000 starting amount, which that's not what I had. I literally had like $2,500. But I knew that I was going to go into the Marines as an officer. I knew that I was going to be able to save. So this is just part of my planning. I saw $20,000 with additional $750 on average, which ideally it would be more than this in the long run. But that's just on average. And when you first start your career, you're going to have a much smaller amount. You can save over 20 years at a 15% return. It yields $1.25 million. That's not too bad for becoming a millionaire before essentially or 40. I was able to greatly accelerate this by saving far more aggressively than this and having a much better return than this. But this is to share the power of trading. If you can be an outlier in one of those small groups of people that can make this work for you, you can drastically change your life. So with that as the why, let's talk about these objectives. Because this is where we get down to the details. This is where the rubber meets the road. So these are kind of the first primary objectives that I think traders should have when they first start out. This is exactly what I would tell myself. The very first one is to develop the skill set. The second thing is to avoid draw downs. Why avoid draw downs? Easy. If you take a look at this up here, which my editor will be kind enough to zoom in for you, you got it pal. You can see the impact of draw downs on these different portfolios. So if you can create consistent returns, you can increase your leverage logically. And by avoiding draw downs, you are not moving your starting point so far to the left. Because if you look at this side over here, the loss recovery, you'll see that big draw downs require big positive returns in order to compensate, inordinately large. And again, this is also on my website. If you want to download it so that you have it as a reference, I think these things are really important to keep in mind. Notice how I have saved here. Saving is so important. I cannot say it enough. This is probably your biggest determining factor. How successful you'll be early on. Because guess what? Your propensity to take a very small amount of money and to trade it into your future wealth is next to zero. Not impossible, but it is so improbable that to me, it wasn't worth my effort. So what was worth my effort was saving super aggressively. And then once we get through these three primary objectives, this is where you get to outline the rest of your objectives. For me, it was returned at least 15% per year. And then I set different draw downs specifications that I could withstand. So those are the primary objectives. This is the second thing I would say to myself after that, after we go through these objectives is how serious are you about this? Because trading is not a hobby. It is not a good hobby. This is one of the easiest ways to lose a bunch of money. If you are not dead set on making this work and fully applying yourself to see if you can make it work, just switch over to buy and hold. You can do great with that approach. You can still become a millionaire much earlier than if you don't do that, especially if you couple it with aggressively saving. Not as quickly as you can if you're a really good trader, but still quickly enough. And if you are not in the right mindset to take this seriously as you need to, your life literally, literally depends on it. So now we need to create a timeline. For me, this is what I would tell myself in year one paper trade that full first year. This is to assess our skill set, which we'll talk about later. Year two, the goal would be profitable. So this is when we start scaling in with real money and the only objective I have is to make money and avoid draw downs. Year three would be to pace the market. Year four year five is where we start outperforming the market. Year five plus is when we're getting super consistent in our work. So once we have the timeline, we have our objectives. Guess what you just started, whether you realize it or not, your trading plan. This is probably the most revolutionary thing that I integrated into my approach and hands down what I attribute my success to. I have a video in the notes below that goes through this in intimate details, like a 25 minute video. But the whole point of a trading plan and trading log is to create documentation so that you can test what works, validate with quantitative information and then over time refine your approach so that you can be more successful. Next up is super simple. Once this is all started, which literally can take a day. That's why it's listed out in this order. This should take about a day. It's something that will evolve over time, but it doesn't take a bunch of time. Start putting your money to work immediately, even just getting into buy and hold in the S&P 500, because if you go all the way back to the first thing, the whole impetus for starting to trade is to make money. So there's a sense of urgency, whether it's conscious or subconscious, it exists. So by doing this, while you're taking this first year to pay per trade, you're not wasting that time. There's not that psychological pressure that, oh, I have to figure this out super fast because you're putting yourself in a great spot. Your money is working and realistically, this is what most people should end up doing anyways in my opinion is this. So you're just getting started early. You don't have that same psychological pressure. Now, why do I think about paper trading for the first year and what I follow this myself? God, honest, probably not. I don't think I would. I think a realistic target would be to pay per trade at least for six months. That I think is reasonable. The whole reason why I talk so much about paper trading is because it is probably the most efficient way you can learn this. Early on, there are so many stupid mistakes you're going to make that there's no reason to start lighting money on fire because you're that impatient. You are not doing yourself any favors. You're not accelerating your time frame by starting trading real money too fast. You're not. The only thing you're going to do is lose money. And the only thing that does is slide your starting point back. Now, the critics will say, oh my God, this is the credit voice by the way. Oh my God, real trading is never replicable by paper trading. Yeah, no shit Sherlock, but that doesn't mean there's still not a ton of value to derive from paper trading. A lot of people will say it's not the same as real trading. It's not. It will never be fully the same. But if you can't take paper trading seriously because you lack that discipline, you're not going to magically grow discipline when real money's on the line. It's the worst possible way to think about trading. If you cannot take paper trading seriously, you have no business actually trading because that amount of work is requisite. You have to do it. So to summarize how I would start trading in a nutshell, define my objectives, create a reasonable timeline, start my trading plan with those first two bullet points, get my money into the S&P 500 with this really, really, really aggressive savings rate month over month and then get into paper trading to start building that skill set, start building a data set that I can analyze and overall commit to the process because in order to succeed here, you have to be a statistical outlier. So that means you have to put in the work that others aren't willing to do. Be an outlier. I'll see you later.
