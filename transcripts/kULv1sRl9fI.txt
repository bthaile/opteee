0.00s: What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to the Outlier podcast where we talk all things abnormal. I'm here with David Peer from military to millionaire. I was actually connecting with him not too long ago for another conversation on his podcast, but it's great to have you on.
17.00s: Thanks for hanging out.
18.00s: Yeah, man. Thanks for having me.
20.00s: I'm stoked that we got through the marriage counseling session of first. So for those that don't know we spend like 15 minutes talking about marriage learning a lot.
27.00s: But I also wanted to thank you for sponsoring this podcast.
32.00s: Oh, yeah, of course. How how do you do that?
37.00s: Well, I don't know. Your assistant said that there might be some sort of transaction of lured photos afterwards as payment.
45.00s: Yeah, I don't know. We've ever had that counter sponsorship. I just assume that's like it's like a it's like a goody bag. I send everyone. Yeah, that's what it was. Yeah, I miss. Yeah, I guess I was just going to scalp the pictures that will get out there, but okay.
60.00s: Yeah, it's honestly great to connect.
64.00s: So for those in my audience, just so you get like a really quick background. Most of them are traders, option traders, right?
70.00s: The world that you know I talk about, but yeah, one of the goals of the podcast that I do here is I really try to pull in people from different backgrounds to give people different tools that they can integrate into their toolkit.
82.00s: Right. Sometimes there are different things that make sense. And like when we talked on yours, you know me, I'm not just a trader. Like I do have commercial real estate. I do have angel investments. I absolutely have my hand in a lot of different buckets, because I think it works.
95.00s: So that aside, now you understand kind of the general people that we're talking to just so you know the technical gap to get into.
104.00s: Talk to me a little bit about why real estate for you.
110.00s: I don't know that I actually thought through a why real estate when I first started so much as when I was going on recruiting duty, I was like, dude, I should buy a house.
120.00s: And then my real estate agent at the time was like not super helpful and you know my boss when I checked into recruiting was like, you're too busy for that shit.
130.00s: You know, don't worry about it. We'll figure it out some other time, but just go get yourself somewhere to live. And so I went and just rented something I tapped out and then like,
139.00s: probably two years later, someone handed me the book rich at port ad. I was like, dude, I don't like to read. He's like, here's a CD of it. Listen to it while you drive.
148.00s: Oh, shit, he got me. So I was driving around, you know, recruit kids. I go to high school and go to another high school. I probably drive an hour and a half, two hours a day. So I listened to that thing in like one week.
159.00s: And just the ideas that he talks about with basic like, you know, essentially like slowly building a passive income portfolio until it replaces, you know, what you're making. I was like, well, that's cool. I don't necessarily enjoy recruiting. I'd like to be done with this at some point.
172.00s: And you know, he talked about real estate, but he talked about a lot of other things too. And real estate was just the one that I'd already kind of thought about it kind of made sense. You know, it's not nearly as like scary as some of the other stuff. And so.
187.00s: I just kind of fell into the rich debt or the, I read some more of the like rich dad, like purple library series. And then I stumbled into bigger pockets and bigger pockets is all real estate. And they make it seem really simple and target beginners. And I was like, I can do this. So I bought my apartment lease was coming up. I bought a duplex lived in one side, run at the other side.
207.00s: And you know, it's slash my living expenses by like 500 bucks a month. And then when I moved out, it was paying me, it was just kind of like, oh, this is really cool. And I'm going to keep doing it. And so it wasn't like a, I don't think it was like a strategic thing so much as I tried it. It didn't hate me. And then I was like, oh, this worked. Let's do more of this. And then over time, you know, I mean, now I'm at a spot where I'm like, I love real estate for a lot of reasons. But the main ones are like.
236.66s: I can pull people together and be in a deal with very little time out of pocket, very little capital out of pocket and just get a return. And it just slowly builds over time to where I'm getting more money. And then even if the property breaks even for a couple of years. And then I sell it. There's a windfall. So I just bought a duplex three weeks ago. And I was out of pocket 3200 bucks. And I'm not managing it. And I've got probably 12,000 equity 15,000 equity in it.
265.20s: And I think it appraised at 105. I bought it at 85. And then, you know, 3200 bucks. So whatever.
273.04s: It's right up for 1250 bucks. So I'm like, yeah, yeah, that was easy. Cool.
277.24s: I'm writing my managing it. So it's just, I think for me now it's just like deals kind of come my way. And I'm able to take them down without a whole lot of effort or capital. So it's just makes sense. I get smaller pieces of a lot of deals and then
288.44s: but I've also done a ton with like creative financing. So I mean, I bought I brought a property zero down no interest to no payments for 12 months. And I flipped it and sold it and paid the guy out of the sales price.
301.52s: And so I think I've just always liked the fact that like, you know, with trading, you at least need some of that capital, even with options trading, you need something. But, but you know, when I first looked at stocks, I was like, I don't have any money.
315.64s: So this is not going to be something that's the growth because I got nothing. Oh, wait, you'll give me a $80,000 house for, you know, 3 grand. That's cool.
327.36s: I can make that work. And so that was kind of what made sense to me, I think.
331.44s: Well, you bring up a good point with the leverage aspect of real estate. And it's also there is like an intrinsic value component to it. Yeah, you can argue your stock holdings and whatnot still have some level of intrinsic value, but a house is a house like they're absolutely is intrinsic value there. Now, a quick side note, I live in San Diego, as we've talked about it. And you said that you bought a house for like 85 grand.
354.44s: Where the fuck is that because I literally don't I literally don't think you could get an empty garage for that here.
363.44s: Yeah, probably not. No, this is all in Southwest Missouri. And that was 2000. Well, I guess I was not so the first two blacks. I bought 79 and that was in 2015.
375.44s: But I did, yeah, I did buy that duplex for 85, you know, last month now granted.
382.44s: Actually, it might have been it might have technically been the last day of February. So it might I might be lying. It might be no, we're still in March. Yeah, last month.
390.44s: Somewhere there, whatever. It doesn't matter. Not really important if it was three weeks or four weeks ago.
395.44s: But I'm actually really hung up on that detail now, though. Yeah. Well, I'll find you a closing date. Give you a headstate. That was literally a friend of mine called and was like,
404.44s: yo, I was going to list this property, but my lender, it's private lender needs his money back by this date. I'm not going to have it done by that date.
415.44s: There's no way it'll sell. Can you close? And I was like, yeah. And then.
421.44s: I'll say it. So we agreed at 85. And I was like, write the contract for 100. And then somewhere in there, I'm going to find $15,000 worth of things that are wrong with it. And you're going to give me a seller credit for 15,000.
436.44s: And then my bank goes 85% loan to value. So magically I had 15,000 in seller credits that was the down payment. And so I'm in for, you know, the closing costs.
448.44s: I don't necessarily think that's the way you should do it with everything, but you know, if you've got a good relationship with the seller, they're willing to kind of play the game. You can kind of just manufacture a closing. So that's what we did.
461.44s: I mean, it's logical as far as I can tell, and it's most of the better deals and real estate that I've experienced have actually come across more like that, especially the liquidity aspect.
471.44s: I find that if you can find opportunities to provide liquidity for somebody, you can typically typically get in at a much better price. Now specifically for the Missouri place, though, where you're not too close to that. Are you?
487.44s: I am in Springfield. Yeah. So I will say that $85,000 duplex is not in Springfield, Missouri. You probably wouldn't find one that's inhabitable for that here. It's about an hourish northwest west of North, never Nevada, Missouri, which is a podunk town, but my buddy happens to work in the Social Security office there. And he owns probably 25 or 30 properties there.
512.44s: And so he's got, you know, and he's got a mix of residential commercial. I own, we have five tax lines that we bought there in August. So if they don't knock on wood, if they don't pay us out, we'll have five houses in August that we bought for 16 grand off tax lines.
529.44s: And so if they do pay us back, we get 8% interest, 10% interest on the money that we put out for the tax lines. So like worst case scenario, we either get 10% interest or we get a house.
540.44s: And so I'm slowly kind of building a portfolio there solely because a really good friend of mine does property management. So he'll handle that and already had properties there. So like, yeah, why not.
553.44s: So you kind of preempted part of my question. And it's something that I actually tried to talk to people about because it's really tricky without a network as far as I can tell, because some of the things that I've acquired are nowhere near me.
566.44s: So that's not easy to do though. So when you're thinking about acquiring properties, let's say you didn't have a friend there. And you found a place, you know, you're searching online.
578.44s: And you found a place that looks to be decent value, you do your homework. It looks like something you might want to get into. It's nowhere near you. How do you approach that kind of deal?
587.44s: Yeah, I guess just as a credibility play, I'll say that I bought that first duplex in Springfield, Missouri. Then I got stationed in Hawaii and from there, Pendleton. And when I got out of the military from Pendleton. So that's for those who don't know California.
601.44s: So I went to Hawaii and then I went to California for five years. And when I left California, I was out of the military. I had 116 doors personally in Springfield. So there's 114 doors, which is probably probably 25 properties, because there was a two apartments at a hotel in there.
618.44s: But like 2025 properties that I had purchased while living out of state, not being here. And I really didn't have that strong of a network here then.
627.44s: Because I mean, you know, you think about it. That was my second property, my third property, my fourth probably like I didn't, I didn't even have a Facebook yet or a Facebook group, you know.
635.44s: And really what I did is I had a really good property manager and I had a relationship with the bank and I was like, I'll figure everything else out.
641.44s: So my second purchase was 10% seller carry 85% bank and I had to put 5% down on a 10 unit apartment and I handed it to my property manager and was like, call me if you need me.
652.44s: And that was from Hawaii. I had never seen it until like eight months after we bought it. And then a third property was a duplex.
660.44s: And that one, I guess, kind of was a relationship thing. My ex wife worked at a high school and it was the football coach and he had just kind of in passing.
671.44s: We had talked about real estate at one point. And when he got a letter from me, he was like, oh, I know this guy like that's, you know, Kim's husband. So kind of was open to a conversation. And that one just kind of happened like.
686.44s: I don't know if he mispriced or if it was because of COVID, I mean, he, he priced that thing at, I think I bought it at 88,000.
698.44s: It was a pretty nice duplex. I mean, it was nicer than the one I bought for 79, 9, 2 years prior. So, and it was worth more than that. I mean, took put in perspective, I bought it for.
709.44s: I don't actually remember. I think it was like 88 and I sold it for one year and one day later. So I didn't have to pay short term capital gains for 140. And so, and I didn't do anything to it maintenance wise. I mean, it was like routine, you know, touch ups, but the same tenants were in it that I sold it that were in it when I bought it. So.
731.44s: That's probably what I think. So then pulling on that thread a little bit more. If you're looking for opportunities to invest in.
741.44s: You shop around locally. You don't necessarily see anything that's speaking to you. What's the next step in your mind?
751.44s: I would say you find a you find a market that meets your criteria and people get really hung up on that, but I would just say you set some basic criteria, you know, easy ones are does average rent equal at least 1% of average purchase price because that's probably around where you want to be if not better. So you want to look at like your rent price ratio.
772.44s: So I would look at tenant landlord laws. So I would stay red state. That's not a political statement that's a there's one kind of voting that hates tenants and says you have no rights. And there's another kind of voting that loves tenants as they have all the rights.
789.44s: I'm not arguing which one's right. I'm just arguing which one you want to be on the side of as a landlord. And you don't want to be on the side of California, which is yeah. So this guy moved in and they have squatters rights.
800.44s: Why do we squatters have rights? This is a thing. Okay, cool. You know, ironically, I have not tested this theory, but my gut says if you moved into Sacramento into the Capitol building, they'd probably kick you out. You probably wouldn't ask squatters rights. So I'm tempted now that I say that I think we should go move in with Newsom.
821.44s: I'm moving in. Of course, I'm like, why wouldn't we? That's such a great great idea. We finally found a loophole because I love my house. It's got a nice view, but I still have to pay money for it. So maybe I don't do that. And I go to the Capitol building.
838.44s: I mean, what would they do? What would they do? I have right publicity for them to kick you out. I have squatters rights. I'm going to make a YouTube video. This is such a great parody idea.
849.44s: And really what we need to do is print out the rights and bring the rights with us so that they know that we have those. Yeah, roll in with a sleeping bag.
859.44s: Where's my room? I know it's going to take six months for you to get me out of here. You don't have a lease. Yeah, yeah. Well, honestly, I understand.
868.44s: Totally. The next time someone calls me and they've got a problem and it's that someone moved into one of their houses and won't move out and never had a lease. I'm going to be like, bro, I know how you get your problem solved.
878.44s: You take your situation and you do exactly that to the governor's house. And he'll figure it out real fast. Or it'll be a great publicity.
886.44s: Almost said not a problem. Yeah, not a problem anymore, which is funny because the first house I bought out here, I ended up renting it, but I was super selective and I made sure it was military people that were going to the house because as you know, if there's an issue with those folks, you might not be able to go to the local municipality.
907.44s: But I can always find a commander who's not going to deal with that shit. Yeah. So that was exactly the road map for me. And honestly, super pissed off adjutant and you're like, hey, bro, you want you want to you want to solve this or should I piss off your boss for you?
922.44s: That's exactly. And they're beautiful people. Great couple like they the kid dog. It was like everything was great. But that was one thing to your point that I was actually very concerned with because out here that can be a problem.
935.44s: So we know that we're looking for average rent about 1% of sale value. We know that we want to be in a place that's generally landlord friendly. What other simple criteria would you apply?
949.44s: Yeah.
952.44s: Yeah, there's I'm trying to think back to like my super macro micro market stuff. But I mean, like at a macro level, you want decent, yeah, rent price, you want decent landlord laws, you want population growth trending upward at least 1% over the last 10 years, you can go to city data.com and pull all that.
972.44s: I would look at like employment diversity. And I don't by any means mean DEI, I mean like manufacturing, verse tech, verse government, verse military, verse medical, like what's the breakdown of you know, you don't want to end up like Detroit where it was 90% automotive and then it wasn't an out Detroit.
992.44s: It's on up and up now, but for a long time, so it sucked. And so like look at you know, I want to see like multiple different industries in that market. And then on a micro level, I'm looking just neighborhood by neighborhood like crime, what class properties.
1010.44s: You know, it really all of that stuff could probably be solved very quickly by getting into local Facebook groups for that market for investing or hitting up like the local real like real estate investor association or even meet up.com and just like you just network a little bit in Facebook groups, whatever.
1028.44s: You can very quick like if you were to go into a springfield Facebook group and be like, hey, what part of town should I invest in almost immediately people are going to go, well, that depends if you want crack houses invest north of sunshine.
1040.44s: And if you don't want crack houses invest south of sunshine preferably south of 60 because sunset 60 to sunshine is good and south of 60 you get into Nixir Republic, Ozark, which are, you know, they've doubled in population in the last 12 years. And they're doing incredible.
1056.44s: And it's like, oh, well, all right, cool. What kind of properties do I want? And there's, you know, there's no right answer.
1061.44s: Crack houses are great. If you have no money and you have all kinds of time, you can buy them dirt cheap people will give them to you low down, you know, lease option, stellar finance, all the things.
1071.44s: And you'll get a really good return on your rent. You're going to have higher maintenance, higher tenant issues, higher vacancy deal with a bunch of bullshit.
1080.44s: But if you have time and no money, that's a great way to start. And then what happens is most people get to a place where they all of a sudden find themselves with money and no time.
1088.44s: And they start selling the crack houses and moving south and buying more, you know, decent property. So I would say, you know, really just figuring out what neighborhoods are good. And you can actually you can go in and you can zip code.
1099.44s: Different population stuff and figure out like where people are moving to where people are moving from.
1105.44s: Crime maps and all that I would really just want to know, you know, if I buy this house, am I in a war zone because you don't want to be.
1112.44s: Now that would be the basic stuff. And then I would start interviewing property managers and honestly the property manager will be able to tell you very quickly like what neighborhoods.
1120.44s: You know, occupancy expectations rent expectations and all of that and they'll have recommendations for you.
1127.44s: I know my property manager is one of very few who will actually touch like war zone north side properties, which has been great because I'll introduce friends to her.
1136.44s: But she's also very upfront with me like I'll call her even now. I'm like, hey, Jerry, do you like this neighborhood? She's like, hell no, okay.
1142.44s: I'll stay away from that. I learned that lesson the hard way.
1147.44s: So I would start networking with real estate agents, local networking, like investment, Facebook groups, property managers.
1154.44s: And then I think the last piece of that puzzle would probably be the lenders looking for you can go find a national bank or hard money lender. But if you find a local.
1163.44s: We call them portfolio lenders where they hold out the loans in house, you know, they they make all the decisions at their level.
1170.44s: And that's how you get like the really good banks. Like I've got a bank that'll do 15% loan to value on anything I buy and they've done some pretty pretty cool things for me over the years.
1183.44s: Well, I'm now realizing a giant gap in my portfolio is the crack house classification. So I'll need to revisit that.
1190.44s: You have money in no time. You know, well, you you have time too, but you've got the money. You can skip that step.
1197.44s: Yeah, but I guess it's kind of nice. Yeah, I mean, I I definitely never showed up that one of my properties with a shotgun because my land, my property manager was like he keeps running my girls off.
1210.44s: And he has the money to pay rent, but he just keeps carrying my girls and they're not going over there to collect rent this month.
1218.44s: But would you mind having a conversation with this tenant, the only time I've ever had to like go and interact with the tenant.
1224.44s: And I had a 12 gauge slung across my back at a 45 on my hip. And I was just like, Hey, I just want to introduce myself. I'm the owner. I'm Dave.
1230.44s: I still had like the full fade mustache like I was like, I just got out of the Marine Corps last week, property manager just wanted me to run through and say hi to everyone to make sure you know everyone was tracking that like we're going to pay rent and we're not going to hassle. So thanks.
1243.44s: I was just going to move on.
1246.44s: That was the only actual time that I talked to. I just it was specifically him, but whatever it worked. He paid rent.
1252.44s: Speaking of the the previous grooming that you had, I am curious why you insist on being such a catfish online because you're you don't have the full beard.
1265.44s: And here you do.
1269.44s: And we're going to get a new photo taken.
1274.44s: But currently, you're right because I am working with a very prominent YouTube guy who's kind of behind the scenes on most big YouTube channels.
1287.44s: Works directly with Evan Carmichael. And he essentially farmed a whole bunch of stuff out to like study groups. And everybody's consensus was kind of like we don't know what that guy does.
1298.44s: And he started doing some analysis and was like, dude, all your best YouTube videos like your top 12 videos are almost as even this one where you still have a beard.
1306.44s: The thumbnail is mustache. He's like, people view that. And they think military dude. Currently, they don't know what you are. And I was like, that's actually a really interesting point.
1315.44s: And the normal photo was like this, you know, like bow tie suit. I got all fly for a conference and my buddy took some headshots. Great photos, great outfit, great whatever.
1326.44s: But he was like, go ask a bunch of your friends. If that's the real Dave or if T shirt. And I was like, well, fuck, that's not the real Dave. And he's like exactly. So let's get rid of that shit.
1336.44s: You want to go take a real photo of you doing like the mean mug cross arms branded t shirt like current haircut. Go for it. But until then we're using this shit because people resonate with it.
1347.44s: And I've already seen it uptick on almost all my YouTube stuff. So I'm like, all right, well, he knew what he was doing. So I'm going to go get professional photos taken of current look. But I didn't have it like all my current photos that I have like this are like.
1362.44s: You know, looking off into the distance where like sunglasses on like they're not they weren't taken with the intent of being a profile photo. So they're not like centered.
1371.44s: I see. Well, it looks like I'm going to have to talk to your guy. But I I feel like when I do he's just going to tell me like, right, just fucking ugly. So there's nothing we could do in these photos to help me. But I'm looking forward to see the uptick in your progression.
1385.44s: Once you have a beard, I'm hiding half my face. It's a hat. I mean, I'll be honest, like if that dude told me like the beard has to go, I'd be like, sorry, dog, you have to go. There's just no fucking way. Yeah, yeah, exactly how it is. We had that conversation. He's like, he was like the mustache. And I was like, so can I just use the mustache from old days as thumbnails, because I'm not shaving my fucking face.
1407.44s: Now, I feel like if there was a way to talk you into like a sick handlebar most. I'm always trying to talk somebody into that because I don't want it, but I want to see it.
1417.44s: The whole food man, too. Yeah, like I'm thinking like a nice solid handlebar mustache would be sick.
1423.44s: The mustache was my brand for like probably three. No, probably probably probably four or five years, because I got promoted just.
1434.44s: Yeah, I got promoted the stash starting to the end of 2016 and I had a mustache from that day. I had I got a PRK like LASIK that day. Like I promoted and then went and got LASIK or PRK. And while I was recovering, I grew the mustache. And what I had grown it out is like a Lance Corporal, you know deployment or corporal is always somebody gave me shit. It was like this thing, you know, first started.
1457.44s: They would hunt me down. They'd be like, look, shave your face. And like I've put a stash argent. I came back to the shop with it and everyone's like, wow, that looks really good on you. And I'm like, all of a sudden, people like it. Okay. I always liked it. So.
1470.44s: Yeah.
1471.44s: So that's that's very Marine Corps for you. I remember one of my my gunnies. He was trying to get the dudes to like really cut their hair short like for every reason he wanted them all to be cue balls.
1483.44s: And I was always a standard second lieutenant hair like right on the fucking cusp of okay.
1490.44s: And he would always ask me like, when you cut your hair, I was just like, when it's out of regulations. And he's like, I think it is now. And I was just like, I don't think it is.
1499.44s: So we literally had a ruler on my desk so that we can measure my fucking shit and be like, no, man, this is still just under three inches. There's no fucking way.
1509.44s: So yeah, yeah, I still have sergeant's major that would tell me to shave my mustache and I'd be like, it's in Rex.
1516.44s: Well, I mean, just put a spot to be in life where like that's the priority for today.
1521.44s: Your your mustache. That's where we're at.
1524.44s: Well, you know, you know how as much as I love the Marine Corps, you know how it is. If you run fast, you get to do everything you want.
1530.44s: And if you don't run fast, you get to watch the people run fast, get to do everything they want.
1534.44s: And that's really the only thing people care about like on the sergeant major side is like haircut, no mustache, run fast.
1541.44s: Nothing else matters. And you're like, you know what is funny is you're promoting guys don't know their job, but don't you know they run fast. You're right. The great people.
1551.44s: We're a simple people. You know this.
1554.44s: We're simple people.
1556.44s: Yeah. So one of the questions I got from my audience for you specifically. And it's honestly to not insult you. It's not for you specifically, but it's for real estate in general. And they know you do real estate, which is.
1566.44s: Current rate environment. A lot of people are turned off from just transactions right now because rates are high.
1574.44s: What do you think about that notion and how do you get around it?
1579.44s: I think people have been finding a reason to be turned off from real estate investing since I started.
1585.44s: Like 2017 the market was in a crash 2018 the market was in a crash 2019 the market was way too high 2020 was COVID.
1594.44s: 21 you miss the boat and 22 who rates were going to go up again 23 you know rates were up like there's always going to be a reason not to invest.
1606.44s: If you're looking for it you'll find sorry here's my take on it. If the property doesn't lose money right now.
1613.44s: Then it'll be fine when rates go down and they're not going to like I have a ceiling on my rates. So if it's okay now.
1620.44s: Higher inflationary environment. Do we think that means lower rent in the future. I don't I think that means higher rent in the future. So one of two things happens.
1628.44s: Rates go down. I. Refi. Rates go up. I'm locked and everything else goes up property value rent you know whatever now that the normally when rates go up property values hold or or dip they didn't dip it all.
1647.44s: My spiteie sense is tell me that when rates drop which will eventually happen at some level. All these people who have been holding out might actually move because right now there's a lot of people locked into their.
1657.44s: You know these incredible interest rates why would they ever lose it.
1660.44s: But I think if rates drop and people have powder that are sitting on the side.
1665.44s: I think we're going to see another pretty decent jump in property values because property values have.
1671.44s: Plac toad for like the last year and a half over rates and inflation definitely hasn't gone away so like.
1678.44s: They're either gun up stay there or they're going to go up if rates. So it's.
1682.44s: So I feel like all of that is true. But I mean I to really just boil it all down. I would rather.
1689.44s: Pay more for a rate. Then pay more for a house.
1694.44s: So do I like the environment of really low interest rates. Yeah, but I'd rather pay for current pricing with high rate and then be able to refi into a lower rate.
1705.44s: Then pay.
1706.44s: Potentially more just have a lower rate and you're like what's the difference well.
1711.44s: Like the rate changes without affecting the property like.
1716.44s: If I buy a house for a hundred thousand dollars and the rates 9% and the rate goes to 3% still about that house for 100 grand.
1722.44s: I'm not under water. I'm okay. Long as I don't miss my mortgage payments. I'm fine. Even if rates go to 20%.
1727.44s: Totally fine. Long as I make my mortgage payments.
1729.44s: But if I pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a house that's really only worth a hundred.
1733.44s: Just because I got a 3% interest rate.
1736.44s: Well now I'm under water for a long time and I'm stuck and so.
1740.44s: You know, there's a lot of other stuff to it too like.
1743.44s: Rates, you know, put this puts like we're not in a buyer's market or a seller's market right now.
1748.44s: So like people can't get their house to sell as quickly on the MLS, which provides a lot of other unique opportunities like.
1755.44s: You know, seller financing stuff and.
1758.44s: And there's all kinds of interesting ways to play that game. We just sold an apartment complex.
1762.44s: For probably 50,000 more than what we would have been able to sell it for.
1766.44s: Because we agreed to hold the note for two years and we.
1770.44s: Yeah, we're arbitrage in the debt or making a thousand twelve hundred bucks a month over our mortgage payment in what we're collecting.
1777.44s: And it's interest only because of because the guy was going to be paying nine percent interest.
1781.44s: To buy the property and we were like, you know, dude, we've got a 6.55 interest rate locked on this thing.
1787.44s: If you just want to give us that interest only while you do all the renovations, you can just have the property for two years.
1793.44s: And when you reify, just pay us out.
1795.44s: And he's like, oh, okay, cool. And so we were able to we're collecting 6.55% interest on 800 K when our original note was 650 at 6.55.
1805.44s: So we're arbitraging that difference in 150 at 6.5%.
1809.44s: And then in two years or within two years, he'll cut us a check for the 800 K and he'll he'll refinance into another, you know, loan with with debt or whatever.
1820.44s: And so we're literally just paying our mortgage payment plus additional and we have no control of the asset anymore.
1826.44s: No tenants, no expenses, nothing. So it creates some interesting opportunities, you know, there's no way we would have been able to do like a 6.5% seller carry three years ago.
1836.44s: People would have been like, you're like an idiot, like, give me zero percent interest.
1840.44s: Now it's like 7% beats nine.
1844.44s: So yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. That's.
1849.44s: It's pretty awesome. I think two things. The first thing is I think you did a good job really good job explaining the high rate environment because what I try to explain to people is the basis.
1860.44s: The basis doesn't adjust until another transaction. The interest rate is variable. Essentially, you can have different access to change your rates. So I think the way you describe that was awesome.
1872.44s: But the other thing that you're highlighting here that is really cool. And one of the things I find interesting about real estate is it's very flexible.
1883.44s: There are a million different ways you can cut even one single deal. It can be done a lot of different ways.
1890.44s: When you think about your progression through real estate, what have been some of those more pivotal moments when you realize it's not this standard cookie cutter.
1901.44s: I go through an agent. There's 3% commission on both side. Yada yada yada like just standard transaction.
1907.44s: What are some of the things that you came across that you realize these are different ways you can do business in real estate that are a big factor for you.
1916.44s: What are some of the things you mentioned already is you know seller carry stuff like that.
1919.44s: Yeah, before I answer that, I just I want to just highlight I love the fact that like with stocks.
1927.44s: If you buy the wrong stock at the wrong price.
1930.44s: Kind of screwed. I mean, I don't know. Maybe maybe there's a way to just hold it forever and hope it comes back. But like my knowledge of that is essentially like a full strategy.
1938.44s: Like shit, let me get out of this thing with real estate. There's not a whole lot of mistakes that can't be overcome by just holding on to it for a longer period of time.
1947.44s: So like I lost 20 grand on this flip. That's okay. Eventually the house will be worth more as long as I'm not coming out of pocket every month to hold on to the thing.
1956.44s: It'll be fine. It'll buff. And so I really like that. It's a very forgiving asset class.
1960.44s: As long as you're at a market that's not plummeting. And even then if you had bought your house in 2006 and still owned it, you'd be up no matter what the 08 to 14 slot looked like in your city.
1976.44s: If you hold it long enough, it gives a lot of stuff as long as you can pay the mortgage or your tenants can.
1983.44s: And there's so much to answer your question. I mean, I did like a 12 12 call master class quote unquote on creative financing stuff to my mastermind and it's like there's the seller financing. Then there's like wraps and then there's there's lease options. There's I mean there are there's sub two there's there's assuming you know,
2007.44s: think about specifically for like a beginner intermediate level. If you were to pick like two or three of those that you think would be good starting points for them. What would that look like?
2018.44s: Yeah, I love creative financing in general, right? So like seller financing is my favorite. And that's essentially having a conversation where and we do this a lot like my buddy Marty has the same car I do at his just went in the shop for something that might be catastrophic and I bought a Tesla.
2035.44s: And so I was like, do you want mine? Like I'm thinking about getting rid of it. I was like it says it's blue booked at this and he texted back. Yeah, do you want to be the bank? And like that's a normal conversation for us.
2048.44s: Like most people I'd say I want 8,000 and the or 6500 whatever. And they would say, okay, let me get alone or let me pay you off in cash or whatever. And his immediate thought was, can I just make payments to you?
2062.44s: Like I'll pay a little more if I just make payments to you. And it's like, that's just a way of thinking, right? And so the number of houses, I probably bought 15, 20, 25 houses now where the bank was either not involved at the beginning or not involved at all because of just negotiating with sellers and just asking questions.
2080.44s: Hey, how much do you need to get out of this house today? Okay, I can put that down.
2085.44s: If I put that down, what if I just make these payments for the next 10 years? And they're like, okay, you know, or all kinds of crazy ways. So I would say learning about seller financing.
2096.44s: And I'd say learning about like private money. So, you know, essentially the idea that I could be like, yo Eric, I got this sick deal.
2106.44s: And if I paid you one point and 10% interest, do you have 100K? You want to stick somewhere for six months? I'll pay you back.
2112.44s: And Eric might not because he gets a better return on his money. But there's a lot of people with money sitting in a savings account or the stock market or a bond or CD or self directed IRA that would jump at that.
2124.44s: And I even have other real estate investors, real world example, under contract on 14 single family houses with that same guy in Nevada.
2134.44s: He's gonna, he found the deal. He's operating the deal. He's managing the renovations on the deal. He needed $200,000 to make it happen.
2142.44s: I pinged one friend. He said, yes, I'm a 35% owner of this transaction. The friend who said, yes, doesn't want equity. He doesn't want to deal with a K1 like a tax return issue.
2153.44s: He just wants monthly payments, whatever. So I was like, hey, can you do 24 months pay you 1% upfront 10% interest all in the back end? And he's like, yeah, cool.
2163.44s: And so that dude is going to make, you know, math and public $22,000 on his 200K guaranteed by backed by the properties. He's going to be first position lean.
2173.44s: Yeah, yeah, first position lean. And then we're going all the renovations. We'll refinance. We'll pay them out. We'll have it on a bank loan.
2183.44s: And we'll be into the property for effectively zero money out of pocket.
2187.44s: But you know, cost us $22,000 in interest to do that and good relationships. But I'd rather do that than put 200K in it myself. I've got, you know, other places to stash money.
2199.44s: Yeah, like the networking and learning about private money and seller financing are huge ways to change the game.
2206.44s: Because you're not using a bank or not using credit. You don't have to abide by any of those rules. You can just if you understand terms, you can literally do anything you want.
2216.44s: And that's pretty powerful. Like I brought.
2219.44s: Probably 15 houses in the last well, between 2021 and 2022, about 15 houses that were all that we call in burrs, which is like you buy it, you rehab it refinance, then you you rent it out and you do it again.
2235.44s: Every single one of those was like, yo, Eric, I got this house. I'm going to be all in for 85. You want to lend on it? Cool. Thanks. Do the buy the property, renovate the property, call the bank. Yo, I got this house. Come up, praise it.
2247.44s: Bank comes out there like worth 140 will give you 85% of that. Cool. Yo, here's your $95,000 back Eric. You know, thanks for playing the game. You made 10 grand. Great. Oh, cool.
2261.44s: I also get to pull 5000 or 10,000 out of this property and I own it with no money left in it. Great. And it cash flows perfect.
2269.44s: I love leveraging those things outside of that. I mean, I would probably just say, you know, have have a good property manager and try to find deals.
2279.44s: You know, off the MLS if possible, whether that's I mean, I got one texted to me five minutes before we got here and I've sent a few questions back and I don't know, I might buy it. I'm not friend of mine has under contract and isn't in a spot to take it down. So just.
2294.44s: You you highlight another really important point though that grows over time, which I.
2301.44s: It's so annoying to say, but it like a network, dude, like having people that are around doing these things is really important and it's funny because.
2312.44s: I found even in my own experience that it starts off where you don't have any money. You don't know anybody with money. So you can't really do shit.
2319.44s: Then all of a sudden, at least from my trajectory from trading, I started having capital, but I actually didn't know a lot of people with money. So I was still just kind of doing my own thing.
2329.44s: And then you start slowly bumping into other people that have capital and then exactly like you're talking about those kinds of things start to emerge because and the reason why I make a point to say this is because a lot of people those say like, oh, I can't find any deals like that or I've never, you know, I never run into those people and what I try to remind them is it's like you're not in an opportunity to get them because if you know David goes to somebody be like, hey, I have you know this deal on the hook.
2358.44s: Do you want to play bank and the person's like, oh, no, I can't this time. Okay, maybe David will earmark you for another deal, but that happens two or three more times like you're a dead end. There's nothing to happen here. You're not in a position to play the game.
2371.64s: So we move on somewhere else. So I just bring that up because a lot of people they resign themselves as if they can never bump into these opportunities.
2381.64s: But the very first thing a person can control my opinion is to get into a position that you can you can play in the opportunities and then all the sudden all of a sudden they start popping up.
2391.74s: Anyways, yeah, yeah, agents always call it like pocket listing.
2396.04s: But I mean, I would I would essentially like when I was wholesaling I had a wholesaling company for probably two and a half years and at towards the end of it, we were doing four transactions a month.
2404.34s: All off market, we generally wholesale two or three and then flip one and hold one or whatever, you know, however the math worked out and I literally had probably six guys that would get a text message.
2417.84s: Hey, I got this property coming. I'm looking for this. Here's what I've got for you know after a pair of value renovations, you know, do your own homework. Here's a link to the photos.
2427.44s: 24 hours later, the other 1200 investors on my email list would get it if none of them had bought it and it was very common that that never saw the email list.
2436.14s: And you know, most of the big wholesalers I know have five or 10 like main buyers and then after that they go somewhere else and you're like, well, that's not fair.
2446.74s: Is it get a hold of the guy's like, oh, let me be on your main buyers list.
2452.34s: I'll show you I'm worth it. I'm like, how I'll buy a fucking property. You send me a deal. I'll buy this out of a bitch as long as it makes sense or I'll tell you what I need it to do in order to make sense.
2462.84s: And you're right. If you do that like four times, you don't buy shit.
2466.34s: All right, you can go sit in the email list. But if someone on that email list buys property buys another property like you, you very quickly, you're on top of my list and you're going to get the deals before anyone else and you know, whatever that looks like.
2479.54s: Doesn't mean you have to buy everything that comes in front of you by any means. But if I don't believe you're going to close.
2484.14s: Or like if you fall out on a contract, I want to say you're dead to me, but you definitely aren't seeing things first.
2490.34s: Yeah, well, and it's it's a working relationship, right? It's like this. It's the same thing. If I do anything else, I'm going to look for the people that are performing at the same level as I am or maybe even a little bit higher and get around those people. And so I think we were highlighting there is kind of a really important point. Now.
2508.54s: When you're looking at different properties, it sounds like you still do a lot of residential, but you mentioned some commercial in there as well. How do you view the two different asset classes and just to couch that some people when they hear commercial.
2523.84s: They sometimes think forget that there's like an entire fucking umbrella under commercial. There's a million things under there. I people will say like because they know I'm in
2534.34s: Korean they'll say stuff like, oh, well, isn't commercial going to collapse? And it's like, what does that even mean? Like what does that even mean? Like all commercial real estate across the entire globe is just going to know, dude, it's not this works.
2547.34s: Just as residential housing markets have pockets, right? Like California tends to do its own thing.
2553.34s: So when you look between the different asset classes and feel free to take the commercial side, whatever, you know, path resonates with you.
2560.84s: But how do you view the difference between those two and how do you implement them in your portfolio?
2566.74s: Yeah, I'm kind of I always joke with people like I'm a I'm a buy and hold guy. And so like I was at a conference two weeks ago, they had a speaker dinner.
2574.94s: And I'm at the speaker dinner and everyone's got like name tags. They may be put on a name tag and it was like put your name, put what you're at put your asset class, right? Everyone's like.
2582.54s: So and so short term rental so and so midterm rental short term rental slash midterm rental slash flip slash whatever.
2591.14s: And I just wrote Dave all and they were like, huh, I was like all of you both are like, what do you do? Like dude, I've pretty much done everything.
2599.94s: But I will pretty much buy and hold anything. I don't care if it's a short term rental. I'm interested if it's a, you know, long term rental of interest. I'm interested in residential assisted living. I don't know.
2608.64s: I don't know any yet, but to your question.
2612.24s: Currently, I think when I when I talk about my portfolio, I talk about things. I have like a controlling interest in or at least, you know, no, my like my equity split, like I actually invested in or did something to make that deal happen rather than like, you know, I don't ever talk about it. But I've got like another 946. No, sorry.
2632.24s: 146.
2634.14s: 740. So you can take your time. Math from Marines. We know this goes.
2638.24s: Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can work with toes if you need. I'm going to I'm I actually haven't done this since I closed the other one. So plus 130 plus.
2647.24s: Yeah. So 1,016 units that I have a small ownership percentage and whether that's like the two of them. Two of those apartment complexes is like one third of a percent. And then one of the deals is like.
2658.84s: I think my stake is like 5% total. All from like investor relations, bringing in investors, helping with marketing and all that.
2667.74s: I don't count those when I'm talking about this. Like that's a thousand doors and ultimately $80 million with a real estate that I am on the operating team with, but I have no controlling it. Like I don't make decisions.
2681.44s: I do on one of them, I guess, but you don't want to mean the restaurant like deals. I finagled or or directly impacted or have a can I make the decisions on. And so with that, I've got currently like.
2693.34s: I sold a lot of residential. I've got nine houses, some duplexes, one fourplex, some single families, one triplex. I've got a 28 pat RV park. I've got a 23 unit apartment, a 40 unit hotel.
2709.74s: And we're under contract on those 14 single family houses and a church. And so I'm a anywhere from a 33 to 100% owner in all of that.
2723.64s: And so I've kind of dabbled. We've looked at mobile homebarks. I've sold some stuff. I sold another apartment, you know, whatever. So I mean, the biggest difference right is residential is usually more emotion driven and commercial assets are not so you can very quickly come in and be like.
2737.44s: This don't match like that's sorry that's not worth that I did it to someone today. I got sent a really cool portfolio. It's
2744.34s: six units that could be Airbnb their cabins on like a river that people kayak on and I'm like, dude, that'd be sick to own cabins that I could literally like I could leave my buddy Hughes house.
2754.94s: Get in a kayak and float for like two days and end up at a house. I like that. That's your house. Yeah, yeah, just get smashed kayaking all the way down. Yeah, that's perfect. I'm like, it's right.
2767.24s: 1,750 and I'm like, all right. Cool. So I go and I'm like, send me the numbers and they send me the numbers and they're like the best year in the last three years was 12,986 net operating income. And I'm like, bro, that's like a 2% cap rate. We're not in fucking L.A. Like, what are you doing? And you know, they gave me a bunch of reasons, but ultimately I'm going to tell them like.
2789.64s: It's worth 400. It's not even worth that, but like I know what I can bring the income up to like you don't in in commercial. It's like.
2796.64s: You don't get to be paid for money that is potential. That's work. I'm going to do. I'm going to offer you based on what this is worth today. Take it or leave it.
2805.14s: And there's not a whole lot of emotions in that, but like, you know, the market can go crazy with residential stuff, which is good and bad because right now everybody's holding on.
2813.74s: And so you can jump in on these things for 85K on a duplex. And then if the market goes up because people get emotional, start buying again. I'm like, oh boy, sure, I'll take 140 for that thing I bought for 85.
2826.44s: Whereas the commercial side is like, I got to play with the expenses. I got to play with the rent. I got to play with whatever to change the value of it. There's a little bit of swing for market, but it's much more driven by what you actually produce with the property, which
2838.94s: The blessing and a curse, but I love it. Like most of the time you take over like a mom and pop property and it's very poorly managed and you can come in and
2846.44s: I'm example, we bought a hotel in December 130 units kind of a boutique like three pools wedding venue right outside the smokey mountains is pretty sick log cabin design like really cool.
2857.44s: Very poorly managed. We came in. We were like, wow, this thing's not on booking. It's not on expedia. It's not on, you know, trillicity or travel, or any of the normal like it's just on their website was on Airbnb or we turned everything on on week one.
2873.34s: And we had to refund like 15 people because we overbooked rooms that weren't actually occupable. And we're like, well, let's turn that back off and you know,
2881.84s: But here's a place that had been operating at like 30% occupancy and we basically filled it the next week with just understanding the basics of marketing. Well, that if you get everything operationally where it needs to be and you do that, you just effectively double to triple the value of that property with a very few tweaks.
2901.84s: And so that's one of the reasons I like commercial like the residential side they'd be like cool, you're bringing in more money.
2906.84s: The neighborhood house down the road still sold for this much. So that's what it's worth commercial side. It's like, oh, you just added, you know, 100, 100 bucks and net operating income can be 60,000 or whatever, I forget the math, but it's like 100 bucks is like 100.
2923.84s: Or one, I think it's $1 equals 166 at a like 10 cap if you, you know, value increase. So for every like 10 bucks, it's 1600 bucks and value or for every, you know, that extrapolates. So if I raise the 10,000, then I'm trying to do really hard math and public, but I think it's 10 grand a month net operating income or 10 grand a year net operating income would be like 160,000 added to the property value.
2949.84s: It's not hard to get that out of the right property.
2952.84s: Right. Well, it also sounds like a lot of the properties still that you deal with have tenants in some capacity.
2959.84s: So, yeah, I'm not doing manufacturing stuff yet. I'd love to get into that and store it and whatever, but storage is interesting. Actually, if you ever want to do anything and storage, let me know, because I'm new to that as well, but I'm interested in that also.
2972.84s: So, but my best friends has 12,000.
2977.84s: Yeah, and but he, he's never needed money because the first 20 bot, he did so well that I'm always like, hey, let me know when you're buying another I'll raise with you and I'll be in on it. And he's like, yeah, yeah, cool.
2988.84s: But I can just pull the money out of this one and buy it myself. So maybe next time I'm like, he's like, he's crushing it.
2994.84s: What a bastard. Share whoever that is share with us. I'm like, you just just let me munch. Yeah, dude. We're trying to get in on this too.
3003.84s: But like for storage units, I am very interested in that. But for manufacturing, it's interesting because I've worked with some partners. And what I found for manufacturing is in general, it's really low turnover, lower returns, but really long terms.
3021.84s: It's like, it's like a fucking ship. They're very stable. And I was kind of getting a bit of an understanding on why that was. And like he actually took me for a walk around one of the properties. And it's like this specialized manufacturing arrangement. And like, these guys have to set up everything how they want it.
3039.84s: That is a massive bear. So, manufacturing's interesting, but probably a little less on my, on my hit list. I would love to see what you do with it though.
3050.84s: We'll see. One of my buddies just built a, I think it's 100,000 square foot facility, maybe 120. I don't necessarily know, but he, he built a, I mean, he basically capitalized off COVID and built like they take, like, F 550's and turn them into like,
3069.84s: $1.2 million, like, bands for like super, super well off, like baller, all-wheel drive, dual-lead, fucking off-road vehicles. And then now I think he started to build boats and stuff. And he like started his garage. And now he's in his own, like, he's renting a shop. But yeah, they just built themselves a warehouse. I think they're about to open his new plant.
3091.84s: So he's, he's the one that's like, really got me thinking about it because he's like, I can build for $11 a square foot. And I can rent for like them. I don't remember the exact math, but he's like moving into that one and already planning on building two more to rent to someone else.
3107.84s: So, that's actually really interesting, especially like the rate of change in the scale that he's going through there.
3114.84s: Yeah, we're coming up on time for you. I know you have other shit to do a couple final questions.
3122.84s: When you look at the real estate market, let's say for the next 18 months or so, something like that.
3129.84s: What do you think? Was it look like?
3132.84s: Hmm. That's a great question.
3138.84s: There's a lot of really weird factors with like the lock-in syndrome where people aren't selling houses because they why would they sell a 3% interest rate to move into a 7.
3148.84s: So there's not a lot of people selling supply and demand is off still because they have not caught up on building. So there's still a dramatic undercut of supply, which makes me feel pretty confident because it's hard to totally tank a market.
3162.84s: If people still need places to live and still want like more people want to buy than can, you know, I mean the interest rate game like if they go too much higher and they hold it too much longer, I think we'll be seeing a full scale depression and or or or maybe not depression, but dent per se in the economy.
3184.84s: And then it won't really matter if real estate takes a little bit of a bump because it's not going to be like everything will.
3190.84s: If they lower on, I think real estate is going to take off running again. And so it's kind of a weird game. I think I think honestly my my assumption is that rates are probably the biggest deciding factor right now and what the market does.
3202.84s: But I think we're kind of in a slow upward and it's like if they drop rates, that'll increase in speed and if they raise rates, that'll slow in speed.
3210.84s: But I don't see a real estate related massive crash in the next 18 months like everyone's calling for it.
3216.84s: But they're thinking back to oh, eight. I don't think I think if something tumbles and I've been saying this for probably two years.
3222.84s: If something tumbles, I don't think it's going to be led by real estate. I think it's either going to be led by banks by the auto industry by, you know, consumer debt.
3231.84s: I mean, there's a couple things that I think will default long before real estate does because you know 60 or 70% of homeowners refinanced 21 to 22.
3239.84s: And their debt is under 4% if not under 3% so it's really hard to imagine a world for me where you know, Mr. Homeowner can't afford their two and a half to a quarter percent interest rate home loan.
3252.84s: Unless they got laid off, they got all this other debt that added up.
3259.84s: So that doesn't necessarily answer your question. I'm still fairly bullish on the real estate market as a whole, but I'm also thinking long term like I don't plan on selling most of the stuff in the next decade.
3267.84s: So it doesn't matter.
3269.84s: Yeah.
3270.84s: Well, it doesn't answer my question because the whole idea is we're taking a guess at the future, right? Nobody fucking notes at the point.
3276.84s: So yeah, so the idea is just to see how you're thinking about it. And at least from a market perspective, we're definitely starting to get closer to cuts.
3283.84s: They're the fetus forecasting three cuts this year. There's only four opportunities left for them to do that.
3288.84s: So the next cut opportunity where the probability of a 25 basis point drop is in June is over 50% chance right now based on the repo market.
3298.84s: So we'll probably start to see some cuts towards the middle slash end of summer is what I'm in at least from the stock market perspective.
3308.84s: Yeah, I would, I would imagine from just a societal standpoint that that happens before the election before the election before the election and then post election it goes back up.
3317.84s: But that's just because I'm a schmuck who is convinced that I'm not going to say my exact quote on this thoughts while we're recording, but essentially politics is a doozy.
3328.84s: Yeah, well, I tell you what would be a doozy is if they cut and raised again that I, I would take the under on that bet. I doubt we they raise again, but I don't want to counter the first part of your back.
3341.84s: So I think that's good. Yeah, how do you get reelected? You fix the economy in six months.
3347.84s: Well, we'll wrap you up here. Where can people get a hold of you if they're interested. Really it's I think if they're interested in like seeing how bad the catfish is, but if they also want to learn about real estate or whatever.
3360.84s: Well, they just want to see the catfish just go to YouTube from military.
3364.84s: But but the best place I tell people to connect is to go to the best podcast guest.com and you can download my free book and find all my social media.
3372.84s: I thought I'd be I bought the domain.
3375.84s: Yeah, it might be you, but I bought the domain. I did that to a friend the other day I called him. I was like, Hey, man, I just wanted you to know I believe in you so much that I bought your domain name.
3385.84s: He's like, what do you mean I was like I now own, you know, first name last name.com. He's like, I hate you. I was like Merry Christmas.
3392.84s: It's absolutely awesome. I love that. We'll all throw links to that in the notes below for everybody so that they can successfully navigate over to you. But dude, it's great catching up. I'm looking forward to catching up with you next week when you're out here. And then we'll catch everybody later.
3405.84s: See you guys. Everyone.
