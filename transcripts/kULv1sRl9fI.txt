0.00s:  What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to the Outlier podcast where we talk all things abnormal. I'm here with David Peer from military to millionaire. I was actually connecting with him not too long ago for another conversation on his podcast, but it's great to have you on. Thanks for hanging out.
18.00s:  Yeah, man. Thanks for having me. Well, I'm stoked that we got through the marriage counseling session of first self for those that don't know we spend like 15 minutes talk about marriage learning a lot.
27.00s:  But I also wanted to thank you for sponsoring this podcast.
32.00s:  Oh, yeah, of course. How how do you do that?
36.00s:  Oh, well, I don't know your assistant said that there might be some sort of transaction of lured photos afterwards as payment.
45.00s:  Get out on the side. I don't know what we've ever had that counter sponsorship. I just assume that's like it's like a it's like a goodie bag. I send everyone. Yeah, that's what it was. Yeah, I miss. I guess I was just going to scalp the pictures. They'll get out there. But okay.
60.00s:  Yeah, it's honestly great to connect. So for those in my audience, just so you get like a really quick background. Most of them are traders, option traders, right?
70.00s:  The world that you know I talk about, but yeah, one of the goals of the podcast that I do here is I really try to pull in people from different backgrounds to give people different tools that they can integrate into their toolkit.
82.00s:  Right. Sometimes there are different things that make sense. And like when we talked on yours, you know me, I'm not just a trader. Like I do have commercial real estate. I do have angel investments. I absolutely have my hand in a lot of different buckets, because I think it works.
95.00s:  So that aside, now you understand kind of the general people that we're talking to just so you know the technical gap to get into.
103.00s:  Talk to me a little bit about why real estate for you.
110.00s:  I don't know that I actually thought through a why real estate when I first started so much as when I was going on recruiting duty, I was like, dude, I should buy a house.
120.00s:  And then my real estate agent at the time was like not super helpful and you know my boss when I checked into recruiting was like, you're too busy for that shit.
130.00s:  You know, don't worry about it. We'll figure it out some other time, but just go get yourself somewhere to live. And so I went and just rented something I tapped out and then like,
139.00s:  probably two years later, someone handed me the book rich at port ad. I was like, dude, I don't like to read. He's like, here's a CD of it. Listen to it while you drive.
148.00s:  Oh, shit, he got me. So I was driving around, you know, recruit kids. I go to high school and go to another high school. I probably drive an hour and a half, two hours a day. So I listened to that thing in like one week.
159.00s:  And just the ideas that he talks about with basic like, you know, essentially like slowly building a passive income portfolio until it replaces, you know, what you're making. I was like, well, that's cool. I don't necessarily enjoy recruiting. I'd like to be done with this at some point.
172.00s:  And you know, he talked about real estate, but he talked about a lot of other things too. And real estate was just the one that I'd already kind of thought about it kind of made sense. You know, it's not nearly as like scary as some of the other stuff. And so.
187.00s:  I just kind of fell into the rich debt or the, I read some more of the like rich dad, like purple library series. And then I stumbled into bigger pockets and bigger pockets is all real estate. And they make it seem really simple and target beginners. And I was like, I can do this. So I bought my apartment lease was coming up. I bought a duplex lived in one side, run at the other side.
207.00s:  And you know, it's slash my living expenses by like 500 bucks a month. And then when I moved out, it was paying me, it was just kind of like, oh, this is really cool. And I'm going to keep doing it. And so it wasn't like a, I don't think it was like a strategic thing so much as I tried it. It didn't hate me. And then I was like, oh, this worked. Let's do more of this. And then over time, you know, I mean, now I'm at a spot where I'm like, I love real estate for a lot of reasons. But the main ones are like.
236.66s:  I can pull people together and be in a deal with very little time out of pocket, very little capital out of pocket and just get a return. And it just slowly builds over time to where I'm getting more money. And then even if the property breaks even for a couple of years. And then I sell it. There's a windfall. So I just bought a duplex three weeks ago. And I was out of pocket 3200 bucks. And I'm not managing it. And I've got probably 12,000 equity 15,000 equity in it.
265.20s:  And I think it appraised at 105. I bought it at 85. And then, you know, 3200 bucks. So whatever.
273.04s:  It's right up for 1250 bucks. So I'm like, yeah, yeah, that was easy. Cool.
277.24s:  I'm writing my managing it. So it's just, I think for me now it's just like deals kind of come my way. And I'm able to take them down without a whole lot of effort or capital. So it's just makes sense. I get smaller pieces of a lot of deals and then
288.44s:  but I've also done a ton with like creative financing. So I mean, I bought I brought a property zero down no interest to no payments for 12 months. And I flipped it and sold it and paid the guy out of the sales price.
301.52s:  And so I think I've just always liked the fact that like, you know, with trading, you at least need some of that capital, even with options trading, you need something. But, but you know, when I first looked at stocks, I was like, I don't have any money.
315.64s:  So this is not going to be something that's the growth because I got nothing. Oh, wait, you'll give me a $80,000 house for, you know, 3 grand. That's cool.
327.36s:  I can make that work. And so that was kind of what made sense to me, I think.
331.44s:  Well, you bring up a good point with the leverage aspect of real estate. And it's also there is like an intrinsic value component to it. Yeah, you can argue your stock holdings and whatnot still have some level of intrinsic value, but a house is a house like they're absolutely is intrinsic value there. Now, a quick side note, I live in San Diego, as we've talked about it. And you said that you bought a house for like 85 grand.
354.44s:  Where the fuck is that because I literally don't I literally don't think you could get an empty garage for that here.
363.44s:  Yeah, probably not. No, this is all in Southwest Missouri. And that was 2000. Well, I guess I was not so the first two blacks. I bought 79 and that was in 2015.
375.44s:  But I did, yeah, I did buy that duplex for 85, you know, last month now granted.
382.44s:  Actually, it might have been it might have technically been the last day of February. So it might I might be lying. It might be no, we're still in March. Yeah, last month.
390.44s:  Somewhere there, whatever. It doesn't matter. Not really important if it was three weeks or four weeks ago.
395.44s:  But I'm actually really hung up on that detail now, though. Yeah. Well, I'll find you a closing date. Give you a headstate. That was literally a friend of mine called and was like,
404.44s:  yo, I was going to list this property, but my lender, it's private lender needs his money back by this date. I'm not going to have it done by that date.
415.44s:  There's no way it'll sell. Can you close? And I was like, yeah. And then.
421.44s:  I'll say it. So we agreed to 85. And I was like, write the contract for 100. And then somewhere in there, I'm going to find $15,000 worth of things that are wrong with it. And you're going to give me a seller credit for 15,000.
436.44s:  And then my bank goes 85% loan to value. So magically I had 15,000 in seller credits that was the down payment. And so I'm in for, you know, the closing costs.
448.44s:  I don't necessarily think that's the way you should do it with everything, but you know, if you've got a good relationship with the seller, they're willing to kind of play the game. You can kind of just manufacture a closing. So that's what we did.
461.44s:  I mean, it's logical as far as I can tell, and it's most of the better deals and real estate that I've experienced have actually come across more like that, especially the liquidity aspect.
471.44s:  I find that if you can find opportunities to provide liquidity for somebody, you can typically typically get in at a much better price. Now specifically for the Missouri place, though, where you're not too close to that. Are you?
487.44s:  I am in Springfield. Yeah. So I will say that $85,000 duplex is not in Springfield, Missouri. You probably wouldn't find one that's inhabitable for that here. It's about an hourish northwest west of North, never Nevada, Missouri, which is a podunk town, but my buddy happens to work in the Social Security office there. And he owns probably 25 or 30 properties there.
512.44s:  And so he's got, you know, and he's got a mix of residential commercial. I own, we have five tax lines that we bought there in August. So if they don't knock on wood, if they don't pay us out, we'll have five houses in August that we bought for 16 grand off tax lines.
529.44s:  And so if they do pay us back, we get 8% interest, 10% interest on the money that we put out for the tax lines. So like worst case scenario, we either get 10% interest or we get a house.
539.44s:  And so I'm slowly kind of building a portfolio there solely because a really good friend of mine does property management. So he'll handle that and already had properties there. So like, yeah, why not.
553.44s:  So you kind of preempted part of my question. And it's something that I actually tried to talk to people about because it's really tricky without a network as far as I can tell, because some of the things that I've acquired are nowhere near me.
566.44s:  So that's not easy to do though. So when you're thinking about acquiring properties, let's say you didn't have a friend there. And you found a place, you know, you're searching online.
578.44s:  And you found a place that looks to be decent value, you do your homework. It looks like something you might want to get into. It's nowhere near you. How do you approach that kind of deal?
587.44s:  Yeah, I guess just as a credibility play, I'll say that I bought that first duplex in Springfield, Missouri. Then I got stationed in Hawaii and from there, Pendleton. And when I got out of the military from Pendleton. So that's for those who don't know California.
601.44s:  So I went to Hawaii and then I went to California for five years. And when I left California, I was out of the military. I had 116 doors personally in Springfield. So there's 114 doors, which is probably probably 25 properties, because there was a two apartments at a hotel in there.
618.44s:  But like 2025 properties that I had purchased while living out of state, not being here. And I really didn't have that strong of a network here then.
627.44s:  Because I mean, you know, you think about it. That was my second property, my third property, my fourth probably like I didn't, I didn't even have a Facebook yet or a Facebook group, you know.
635.44s:  And really what I did is I had a really good property manager and I had a relationship with the bank and I was like, I'll figure everything else out.
641.44s:  So my second purchase was 10% seller carry 85% bank and I had to put 5% down on a 10 unit apartment and I handed it to my property manager and was like, call me if you need me.
652.44s:  And that was from Hawaii. I had never seen it until like eight months after we bought it. And then a third property was a duplex.
660.44s:  And that one, I guess, kind of was a relationship thing. My ex wife worked at a high school and it was the football coach and he had just kind of in passing.
671.44s:  We had talked about real estate at one point. And when he got a letter from me, he was like, oh, I know this guy like that's, you know, Kim's husband. So kind of was open to a conversation. And that one just kind of happened like.
686.44s:  I don't know if he mispriced or if it was because of COVID, I mean, he, he priced that thing at, I think I bought it at 88,000.
698.44s:  It was a pretty nice duplex. I mean, it was nicer than the one I bought for 79, 9, 2 years prior. So, and it was worth more than that. I mean, took put in perspective, I bought it for.
709.44s:  I don't actually remember. I think it was like 88 and I sold it for one year and one day later. So I didn't have to pay short term capital gains for 140. And so, and I didn't do anything to it maintenance wise. I mean, it was like routine, you know, touch ups, but the same tenants were in it that I sold it that were in it when I bought it. So.
731.44s:  That's probably what I think. So then pulling on that thread a little bit more. If you're looking for opportunities to invest in.
741.44s:  You shop around locally. You don't necessarily see anything that's speaking to you. What's the next step in your mind?
751.44s:  I would say you find a you find a market that meets your criteria and people get really hung up on that, but I would just say you set some basic criteria, you know, easy ones are does average rent equal at least 1% of average purchase price because that's probably around where you want to be if not better. So you want to look at like your rent price ratio.
772.44s:  So I would look at tenant landlord laws. So I would stay red state. That's not a political statement that's a there's one kind of voting that hates tenants and says you have no rights. And there's another kind of voting that loves tenants as they have all the rights.
789.44s:  I'm not arguing which one's right. I'm just arguing which one you want to be on the side of as a landlord. And you don't want to be on the side of California, which is yeah. So this guy moved in and they have squatters rights.
800.44s:  Why do we squatters have rights? This is a thing. Okay, cool. You know, ironically, I have not tested this theory, but my gut says if you moved into Sacramento into the Capitol building, they'd probably kick you out. You probably wouldn't ask squatters rights. So I'm tempted now that I say that I think we should go move in with Newsom.
821.44s:  I'm moving in. Of course, I'm like, why wouldn't we? That's such a great great idea. We finally found a loophole because I love my house. It's got a nice view, but I still have to pay money for it. So maybe I don't do that. And I go to the Capitol building.
838.44s:  I mean, what would they do? What would they do? I have right publicity for them to kick you out. I have squatters rights. I'm going to make a YouTube video. This is such a great parody idea.
849.44s:  And really what we need to do is print out the rights and bring the rights with us so that they know that we have those. Yeah, roll in with a sleeping bag.
859.44s:  Where's my room? I know it's going to take six months for you to get me out of here. You don't have a lease. Yeah, yeah. Well, honestly, I understand.
868.44s:  Totally. The next time someone calls me and they've got a problem and it's that someone moved into one of their houses and won't move out and never had a lease. I'm going to be like, bro, I know how you get your problem solved.
878.44s:  You take your situation and you do exactly that to the governor's house. And he'll figure it out real fast. Or it'll be a great publicity.
886.44s:  Almost said not a problem. Yeah, not a problem anymore, which is funny because the first house I bought out here, I ended up renting it, but I was super selective and I made sure it was military people that were going to the house because as you know, if there's an issue with those folks, you might not be able to go to the local municipality.
907.44s:  But I can always find a commander who's not going to deal with that shit. Yeah. So that was exactly the road map for me. And honestly, super pissed off adjutant and you're like, hey, bro, you want you want to you want to solve this or should I piss off your boss for you?
922.44s:  That's exactly. And they're beautiful people. Great couple like they the kid dog. It was like everything was great. But that was one thing to your point that I was actually very concerned with because out here that can be a problem.
935.44s:  So we know that we're looking for average rent about 1% of sale value. We know that we want to be in a place that's generally landlord friendly. What other simple criteria would you apply?
949.44s:  Yeah.
952.44s:  Yeah, there's I'm trying to think back to like my super macro micro market stuff. But I mean, like at a macro level, you want decent, yeah, rent price, you want decent landlord laws, you want population growth trending upward at least 1% over the last 10 years, you can go to city data.com and pull all that.
972.44s:  I would look at like employment diversity. And I don't by any means mean DEI, I mean like manufacturing, verse tech, verse government, verse military, verse medical, like what's the breakdown of you know, you don't want to end up like Detroit where it was 90% automotive and then it wasn't an out Detroit.
992.44s:  It's on up and up now, but for a long time, so it sucked. And so like look at you know, I want to see like multiple different industries in that market. And then on a micro level, I'm looking just neighborhood by neighborhood like crime, what class properties.
1010.44s:  You know, it really all of that stuff could probably be solved very quickly by getting into local Facebook groups for that market for investing or hitting up like the local real estate investor association or even meet up.com and just like you just network a little bit in Facebook groups, whatever.
1028.44s:  You can very quick like if you were to go into a springfield Facebook group and be like, hey, what part of town should I invest in almost immediately people are going to go, well, that depends if you want crack houses invest north of sunshine.
1040.44s:  And if you don't want crack houses invest south of sunshine preferably south of 60 because sunset 60 to sunshine is good and south of 60 you get into Nixir Republic, Ozark, which are, you know, they've doubled in population in the last 12 years. And they're doing incredible.
1056.44s:  And it's like, oh, well, all right, cool. What kind of properties do I want? And there's, you know, there's no right answer.
1061.44s:  Crack houses are great. If you have no money and you have all kinds of time, you can buy them dirt cheap people will give them to you low down, you know, lease option, stellar finance, all the things.
1071.44s:  And you'll get a really good return on your rent. You're going to have higher maintenance, higher tenant issues, higher vacancy deal with a bunch of bullshit.
1080.44s:  But if you have time and no money, that's a great way to start. And then what happens is most people get to a place where they all of a sudden find themselves with money and no time.
1088.44s:  And they start selling the crack houses and moving south and buying more, you know, decent property. So I would say, you know, really just figuring out what neighborhoods are good. And you can actually you can go in and you can zip code.
1099.44s:  Different population stuff and figure out like where people are moving to where people are moving from.
1105.44s:  Crime maps and all that I would I would really just want to know, you know, if I buy this house, am I in a war zone because you don't want to be.
1113.44s:  Now that would be the basic stuff. And then I would start interviewing property managers and honestly the property manager will be able to tell you very quickly like what neighborhoods.
1121.44s:  I know occupancy expectations rent expectations and all of that and they'll have recommendations for you.
1128.44s:  I know my property manager is one of very few who will actually touch like war zone north side properties, which has been great because I'll introduce friends to her.
1137.44s:  But she's also very upfront with me like I'll call her even now. I'm like, hey, Jerry, do you like this neighborhood? She's like hell no, okay.
1143.44s:  I'll stay away from that. I learned that lesson the hard way.
1147.44s:  I would start networking with real estate agents local networking like investment Facebook groups, property managers.
1154.44s:  And then I think the last piece of that puzzle would probably be the lenders looking for you can go find a national bank or hard money lender. But if you find a local.
1163.44s:  We call them portfolio lenders where they hold out the loans in house, you know, they they make all the decisions.
1169.44s:  And that's how you get like the really good banks like I've got a bank that'll do 15% loan to value on anything I buy and they've done some pretty pretty cool things for me over the years.
1183.44s:  Well, I'm now realizing a giant gap in my portfolio is the crack house classification. So I'll need to revisit that.
1190.44s:  You have money in no time. You know, well, you you have time too, but you've got the money. You can skip that step.
1197.44s:  But crack house is kind of nice. Yeah, I mean, I definitely never showed up at one of my properties with a shotgun because my land, my property manager was like, he keeps running my girls off.
1210.44s:  And he has the money to pay rent, but he just keeps carrying my girls and they're not going over there to collect rent this month.
1218.44s:  Would you mind having a conversation with this then it's the only time I've ever had to like go and interact with the tenant.
1224.44s:  And I had a 12 gauge slung across my back at a 45 on my hip. And I was just like, Hey, I just want to introduce myself. I'm the owner. I'm Dave.
1230.44s:  I still have like the full fade mustache like I was like, I just got the Marine Corps last week, property manager just wanted me to run through and say hi to everyone to make sure you know everyone was tracking that like.
1239.44s:  We're going to pay rent and we're not going to hassle. So thanks, the move on.
1244.44s:  I was the only actual time that I talked to you. I just it was specifically him, but whatever it worked. He paid rent.
1250.44s:  Speaking of the the previous grooming that you had, I am curious why you insist on being such a catfish online because you're you don't have the full beard.
1263.44s:  And so here you do.
1267.44s:  I actually just changed all of that. And we might I got to get new photos taken going to get new photos taken.
1276.44s:  But currently you're right because I am working with a very prominent YouTube guy who's kind of behind the scenes on most big YouTube channels works directly with Evan Carmichael.
1289.44s:  And he essentially farmed a whole bunch of stuff out to like study groups.
1294.44s:  And everybody's consensus was kind of like we don't know what that guy does. And he started doing some analysis and was like dude all your best YouTube videos like your top 12 videos are all mustache.
1304.44s:  Even this one where you still have a beard, the thumbnail is mustache. He's like people view that. And they think military dude.
1311.44s:  Currently, they don't know what you are. And I was like that's actually a really interesting point and my normal photo was like this.
1317.44s:  You know like bow tie suit. I got all fly for a conference and my buddy took some head shots. Great photos. Great outfit. Great whatever.
1325.44s:  But he was like go ask a bunch of your friends.
1329.44s:  If that's the real Dave or if T shirt. And I was like well, fuck that's not the real Dave and he's like exactly. So let's get rid of that shit.
1336.44s:  You want to go take a real photo of you doing like the mean mug cross arms branded T shirt like current haircut.
1343.44s:  Go for it. But until then we're using this shit because people resonate with it. And I've already seen it uptick on almost all my YouTube stuff. So I'm like alright well he knew what he was doing. So I'm going to go get professional photos taken of current look.
1358.44s:  I didn't have it like all my current photos that I have like this are like.
1362.44s:  You know looking off into the distance where like sunglasses on like they're not they weren't taken with the intent of being a profile photo so they're not like centered.
1371.44s:  I see well it looks like I'm going to have to talk to your guy but I I feel like when I do he's just going to tell me like right just fucking ugly so there's nothing we could do in these photos to help me but I'm looking forward to see the uptick in your progression once you get a beard.
1386.44s:  I'm hiding half my face. It's a hat. I mean I'll be honest like if that do told me like the beard has to go I'd be like sorry dog you have to go. There's just no fucking way. Yeah yeah exactly how it is we had that conversation.
1399.44s:  He's like he was like the mustache and I was like so can I just use the mustache from old days as thumbnails because I'm not shaving my fucking face.
1407.44s:  Now I feel like if there was a way to talk you into like a sick handle bar must I'm always trying to talk somebody into that because I don't want it but I want to see it.
1417.44s:  The whole food man. Yeah like I'm thinking like a nice solid handle bar mustache would be sick.
1423.44s:  The mustache was my brand for like probably three. No probably probably probably four or five years because I got promoted just.
1434.44s:  Yeah I got promoted the stash starting the end of 2016 and I had a mustache from that day. I had I got a PRK like LASIK that day like I promoted and then went and got LASIK or PRK and while I was recovering I grew the mustache and when I had grown it out as like a Lance Corporal you know deployment or corporal is always somebody gave me shit it was like this thing you know first started.
1457.44s:  They would hunt me down they'd be like look shave your face and like I've put a stash argent.
1463.44s:  I came back to the shop with it and everyone's like wow that looks really good on you and I'm like all of a sudden people like it okay I always liked it so.
1470.44s:  Yeah so that's that's very Marine Corps for you I remember one of my my gunnies he was trying to get the dudes to like really cut their hair short like for every reason he wanted them all to be cue balls.
1483.44s:  And I was always a standard second lieutenant hair like right on the fucking cusp of okay and he would always ask me like when you cut your hair I was just like when it's out of regulations and he's like I think it is now and I was just like I don't think it is so we literally had a ruler on my desk so that we can measure my fucking shit and be like no man this is still just under three inches there's no fucking way so yeah yeah I still have sergeant's major that would tell me to shave my mustache.
1512.44s:  And I'd be like it's in Rex.
1515.44s:  I mean just want to spot to be in life where like that's the priority for today.
1521.44s:  Your your mustache that's where we're at.
1525.44s:  Well you know how as much as I love the Marine Corps you know how it is if you run fast you get to do everything you want and if you don't run fast you get to watch the people to run fast get to do everything they want.
1534.44s:  And that's really the only thing people care about like on the sergeant major side is like haircut no mustache run fast nothing else matters and you're like you know what is funny is your promoting eyes don't know their job but don't you know they run fast you're right the great people.
1551.44s:  We're a simple people you know this.
1554.44s:  We're a simple people.
1556.44s:  Yeah so one of the questions I got from my audience for you specifically and it's honestly to near not insult you it's not for you specifically but it's for real estate general and you do real estate which is.
1566.44s:  Current rate environment lot of people are turned off from just transactions right now because rates are high.
1574.44s:  What do you think about that notion and how do you get around it.
1579.44s:  I think people have been finding a reason to be turned off from real estate investing since I started like 2017 the market was in a crash 2018 the market was in a crash 2019 the market was way too high 2020 was covid 2021 you miss the boat and 22 rates were going to go up again 23 you know rates were up like there's always going to be a reason not to invest.
1606.44s:  If you're looking for you find sorry here's my take on if the property doesn't lose money right now then it'll be fine when rates go down and they're not going to like I have a ceiling on my rates so if it's okay now higher inflationary environment do we think that means lower rent in the future I don't I think that means higher rent in the future so one of two things happens rates go down I reify rates go up.
1635.44s:  I'm locked and everything else goes up property value rent you know whatever now that the normally when rates.
1642.44s:  Go up property values hold or or dip they didn't dip at all so my my spitey sense is telling me that when rates drop which will eventually happen at some level all these people who have been holding out might actually move because right now there's a lot of people locked into their.
1657.44s:  You know these incredible interest rates why would they ever lose it but I think if rates drop and people have powder that are sitting on the side I think we're going to see another pretty decent jump in property values because property values have.
1670.44s:  Flat toad for like the last year and a half over rates and inflation definitely hasn't gone away so like they're either gun up stay there or they're going to go up if rates so it's.
1682.44s:  So I feel like all of that is true but I mean I to really just boil it all down I would rather.
1689.44s:  Pay more for a rate then pay more for a house so do I like the environment of really low interest rates yeah but I'd rather pay for current pricing with high rate and then be able to refi into a lower rate then pay.
1706.44s:  Potentially more just have a lower rate and you're like what's the difference well like the rate changes without affecting the property like if I buy a house for a hundred thousand dollars and the rates 9% and the rate goes to 3% still about that house for 100 grand i'm not under water i'm okay long as I don't miss my mortgage payments i'm fine even if rates go to 20% totally fine long as I make my mortgage payments but if I pay a hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a house that's really only worth a hundred just because I got a 3% interest rate.
1735.44s:  Well now I'm under water for a long time and I'm stuck and so you know there's a lot of other stuff to it to like.
1742.44s:  Rates you know put this puts like we're not in a buyer's market or a seller's market right now so like people can't get their house to sell as quickly on the mls which provides a lot of other unique opportunities like.
1755.44s:  You know seller financing stuff and there's all kinds of interesting ways to play that game we just sold an apartment complex for probably 50 thousand more than what we would have been able to sell it for because we agreed to hold the note for two years and we.
1770.44s:  Yeah we're arbitrage in the debt we're making a thousand twelve hundred bucks a month over our mortgage payment in what we're collecting and it's interest only because of because the guy was going to be paying 9% interest.
1781.44s:  To buy the property and we were like you know dude we've got a 6.55 interest rate locked on this thing if you just want to give us that interest only while you do all the renovations you can just have the property for two years and when you re-fi just pay us out and he's like oh okay cool and so we were able to we're collecting.
1799.44s:  6.55% interest on 800k when our original note was 650 at 6.55 so we're arbitraging that difference in 150 at 6.5% and then in two years or within two years he'll cut us a check for the 800k and he'll he'll refinance into another you know loan with with debt or whatever and so we're literally just paying our mortgage payment plus additional and we have no control of the asset anymore no tenants no expenses nothing so it creates some interest.
1828.44s:  It creates some interesting opportunities you know there's no way we would have been able to do like a 6.5% seller carry three years ago people would have been like your second idiot like give me zero percent interest now it's like 7% beats nine so yeah right yeah yeah that's.
1848.44s:  It's pretty awesome I think you things the first thing is I think you did a good job really good job explaining the high rate environment because what I try to explain to people is the basis the basis doesn't adjust until another transaction the interest rate is variable essentially you can have different access to change your rates so I think the way you describe that was awesome but the other thing that you're highlighting here that is really cool and one of the things I find interesting.
1878.44s:  So I think the thing about real estate is it's very flexible there are a million different ways you can cut even one single deal it can be done a lot of different ways when you think about your progression through real estate would have been some of those more pivotal moments when you realize it's not this standard cookie cutter I go through an agent there's 3% commission on both side yada yada like just standard transaction what are some of the things that you can do.
1908.44s:  The things that you came across that you realize these are different ways you can do business in real estate that are a big factor for you one of the things you mentioned already is you know seller carry stuff like that.
1919.44s:  Yeah before I answer that I just I want to just highlight I love the fact that like with stocks if you buy the wrong stock at the wrong price kind of screwed I mean I don't know maybe maybe there's a way to just hold it forever and hope it comes back but like my knowledge of that is essentially like a little strategy.
1937.44s:  Like shit let me get out of this thing with real estate there's not a whole lot of mistakes that can't be overcome by just holding on to it for a longer period of time so like I lost 20 grand on this flip that's okay eventually the house will be worth more as long as I'm not coming out of pocket every month to hold on to the thing it'll be fine it'll buff and so I really like that it's a very forgiving asset class as long as you're at a market that's not plummeting and even then if you had bought your hand.
1966.44s:  You bought your house in 2006 and still owned it you'd be up no matter what the 08 to 14 slot looked like in your in your city hold it long enough it gives a lot of stuff as long as you can pay the mortgage or your tenants can.
1981.44s:  Man there's so much to answer your question I mean I did like a 12 12 call master class quote unquote on creative financing stuff to my mastermind and it's like there's the seller financing then there's like reps and then there's there's lease options there's I mean there are there's sub two there's there's assuming you know.
2007.44s:  Think about specifically for like a beginner intermediate level if you were to pick like two or three of those that you think would be good starting points for them what would that look like.
2018.44s:  Yeah I love creative financing in general right so like seller financing is my favorite and that's essentially having a conversation where and we'd I do this a lot like my buddy Marty has the same car I do it is just one in the shop for something that might be catastrophic and I bought a Tesla.
2035.44s:  And so I was like you want mine like I'm thinking about getting rid of it I was like it says it's blue booked at this and he texted back yeah do you want to be the bank and like that's a normal conversation for us like most people I'd say I want 8000 and the or 6500 whatever and they would say okay let me get alone or let me pay you off in cash or whatever and his immediate thought was.
2060.44s:  Can I make payments to you like I'll pay a little more if I just make payments to you and it's like that's just a way of thinking right and so the number of houses I probably bought 15 20 25 houses now where the bank was either not involved at the beginning or not involved at all because of just negotiating with sellers and just asking questions you know hey how much do you need to get out of this house today okay I can put that down.
2085.44s:  If I put that down what if I just make these payments for the next 10 years I like okay you know or or all kinds of crazy ways so I would say learning about seller financing and I'd say learning about like private money so you know essentially the idea that I could be like yo Eric I got the sick deal.
2105.44s:  If I paid you one point and 10% interest you have 100k you want to stick somewhere for six months I'll pay back and Eric might not because he gets a better return on his money there's a lot of people with money sitting in a savings account or the stock market or a bond or CD or self directed IRA that would jump at that and I even have other real estate investors real world example under contract on 14 single family houses with that same guy in Nevada.
2133.44s:  He's gonna he found the deal he's operating the deal he's managing the renovations on the deal he needed $200,000 to make it happen I pinged one friend he said yes I'm a 35% owner of this transaction the friend who said yes doesn't want equity he doesn't want to deal with a K1 like a tax return issue he just wants monthly payments whatever so I was like hey can you do 24 months pay you 1% up front 10% interest all in the back end and he's like yeah cool.
2162.44s:  And so that dude is going to make you know math and public $22,000 on his 200k guaranteed by backed by the properties he's going to be first position lean.
2173.44s:  Herb no yeah yeah first position lean and then we're going with all the renovations we'll refinance we'll pay him out we'll have it on a bank loan and we'll be into the property for effectively zero money out of pocket.
2188.44s:  But you know costs us 22,000 an interest to do that and good relationships but I'd rather do that than put 200k in it myself i've got you know other places to stash money.
2199.44s:  What's inside the bike yeah like the networking and learning about private money and seller financing are huge ways to change the game because you're not using a bank you're not using credit you don't have to abide by any of those rules you can just if you understand terms you can literally do anything you want.
2216.44s:  And that's pretty powerful like I brought.
2219.44s:  Probably 15 houses in the last well.
2222.44s:  Between 20 21 and 2022 about 15 houses that were all that we call in burrs which is like you buy it you rehab it refinance and then you you rent it out and you do it again.
2235.44s:  Every single one of those was like yo Eric I got this house i'm going to be all in for 85 you want to lend on it cool thanks do the by the property renovate the property call the bank yo I got this house come a praise it bank comes out there like worth 140 will give you 85% of that cool yo here's your 95,000 back Eric you know thanks for playing the game you made 10 grand great.
2260.44s:  Oh cool I also get to pull 5000 or 10,000 out of this property and I own it with no money left in it great and it cash was perfect.
2268.44s:  I love leveraging those things outside of that I mean I would probably just say.
2274.44s:  You have have a good property manager and try to find deals.
2279.44s:  You know off the mls if possible whether that's I mean I got one texted to be five minutes before we got here and I've sent a few questions back and I don't know I might buy it I'm not friend of mine has under contract and isn't in a spot to take it down so.
2294.44s:  You you highlight another really important point though that grows over time which i.
2301.44s:  It's so annoying to say but it like a network dude like having people that are around doing these things is really important and it's funny because.
2311.44s:  I found even in my own experience that it starts off where you don't have any money you don't know anybody with money so you can't really do shit then all of a sudden at least from my trajectory from trading I started having capital but I actually didn't know a lot of people with money so I was still just kind of doing my own thing.
2329.44s:  And then you start slowly bumping into other people that have capital and then exactly you're talking about those kinds of things start to emerge because and the reason why I make a point to say this is because a lot of people those say like oh I can't find any deals like that or I'm never you know I never run into those people and what I try to remind them it's like you're not in an opportunity to get them because if you know David goes to somebody be like hey.
2356.44s:  I have you know this deal on the hook do you want to play bank and the person's like oh no I can't this time okay maybe David will earmark you for another deal but that happens two or three more times like you're a dead end there's nothing to happen here you're not in a position to play the game so we move on somewhere else.
2373.44s:  So I just bring that up because a lot of people they resign themselves as if they can never bump into these opportunities.
2381.44s:  But the very first thing a person can control my opinion is to get into a position that you can you can play in the opportunities and then all the sudden all the sudden they start popping up anyways yeah yeah agents always call it like pocket listing.
2395.44s:  But I mean I would I would essentially like when I was wholesaling I had a wholesaling company for probably two to half years and at the end of it we were doing four transactions a month all off market we we generally wholesale two or three and then flip one and hold one or whatever you know however the math worked out.
2410.44s:  And I literally had probably six guys that would get a text message hey I got this property coming I'm looking for this here's what I've got for you know after repair value renovations you know do your own homework here's a link to the photos 24 hours later the other 1200 investors on my email list would get it if none of them would bought it and it was very common that that never saw the email list and you know most of the big wholesalers I know have five or 10 minutes of the time I'm going to do that.
2439.44s:  Five or 10 like main buyers. And then after that they go somewhere else and you're like well that's not fair is it get a hold of the guy's like go let me be on your main buyers list I'll show you I'm worth it.
2453.44s:  And I like how I buy a fucking property you send me a deal buy this out of a bitch as long as it makes sense or I'll tell you what I need it to do in order to make sense and you're right if you do that like four times you don't buy shit.
2466.44s:  All right you can go sit in the email list but if someone on that email list buys property buys another property like you you very quickly you're on top of my list and you're going to get the deals before anyone else and you know whatever that looks like doesn't mean you have to buy everything that comes in front of you by any means but if I don't believe you're going to close.
2483.44s:  Or like if you fall out on a contract I want to say you're dead to me but you definitely aren't seeing things first.
2490.44s:  Yeah well and it's it's a working relationship right it's like this it's the same thing if I do anything else I'm going to look for the people that are performing at the same level as I am or maybe even a little bit higher and get around those people so I think we were highlighting there is kind of a really important point now when you're looking at different properties it sounds like you still do a lot of residential but you mentioned some commercial in there as well how do you view the two different asset classes in.
2518.44s:  Just to couch that some people when they hear commercial they sometimes think forget that there's like an entire fucking umbrella under commercial there's a million things under there I people say like because they know I'm in.
2533.44s:  Crean they'll say stuff like oh well isn't commercial going to collapse and it's like what does that even mean like what is that even mean like all commercial real estate across the entire globe is just going to like no dude it's not this works just as residential housing markets have pockets right like California tends to do its own thing so when you look between the different asset classes and feel free to take the commercial side whatever you know path resonates with you but how do you view the difference between those two and how do you end up.
2563.44s:  So I think I'm going to implement them in your portfolio.
2567.44s:  Yeah I'm kind of I always joke with people like I'm I'm a buying old guy and so like I was at a conference two weeks ago they had a speaker dinner and I'm at the speaker dinner and everyone's got like name tags I mean you put on a name tag and it was like put your name put what you're at put your asset class right everyone's like so and so short term rental so and so midterm rental short term rental slash midterm rental slash flip slash whatever and I just wrote Dave all.
2593.44s:  And they were like huh I was like all the above like what do you do like dude I've pretty much done everything but I will pretty much buy and hold anything I don't care if it's a short term rental I'm interested if it's a long term rental of interest I'm interested in residential assisted living I don't know any yet but your question um currently I think when I when I talk about my portfolio I talk about things I have like a controlling interest in or at least you know no my like my equity split like I actually invested in or did.
2623.40s:  Something to make that deal happen rather than like you know I don't ever talk about it but I've got like another 946 no sorry um
2632.24s:  146 740 so you can take your time math from Marines we know this goes yeah you can yeah you can work with toes if you need I'm gonna I'm I actually haven't done this since I closed the other one so
2644.84s:  plus 130 plus yeah so 1,000 and 16 units that I have a small ownership percentage and whether that's like the two of them to those apartment complexes is like one third of a percent and then one of the deals is like I think my stake is like 5% total
2660.84s:  all from like investor relations bringing in investors helping with marketing and all that I don't count those when I'm talking about this like that's a thousand doors and and ultimately 80 million dollars with a real estate that I am on the operating team with but I have no controlling it like I don't make decisions.
2680.32s:  I do on one of my guests but you don't I mean the restaurant like deals I finagled or or directly impacted or have a can I make the decisions on and so with that I've got currently like I sold a lot of residential I've got 9 houses some duplexes one 4plex some single families one triple X I've got a 28 pat RV park I've got a 23 unit apartment a 40 unit hotel
2706.32s:  I want to contract on those 14 single family houses and a church and so I'm a anywhere from a 33 to 100% owner in all of that.
2722.32s:  I'm so kind of dabbled we've looked at mobile home barks I've sold some stuff I sold another apartment you know whatever so I mean the biggest difference right is residential usually more emotion driven and commercial assets are not so you can very quickly come in and be like.
2736.32s:  This don't match like that's sorry that's not worth that I did it to someone today I got sent a really cool portfolio it's six units that could be Airbnb their cabins on like a river that people kayak on and I'm like do that be sick to own cabins that I could literally like I could leave my buddy Hughes house get in a kayak and float for like two days and end up at a house I like that be sick your house yeah yeah just get smashed kayaking all the way down yeah that's perfect I'm like I'm like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like I'm going to be like
2766.32s:  it's rat 150 and I'm like all right cool so I go and I'm like send me the numbers and they send me the numbers and they're like the best year in the last three years was 12,986 net operating income and I'm like bro that's like a 2% cap rate we're not in fucking LA like what are you doing and you know they gave me a bunch of reasons but ultimately I'm going to tell them like it's worth 400 it's not even worth that but like I know what I can bring the income up to like you don't in in in in commercial it's like
2796.88s:  you don't get to be paid for money that is potential that's work I'm going to do I'm going to offer you based on what this is worth today take it or leave it
2805.20s:  and there's not a whole lot of emotions in that but like you know the market can go crazy with residential stuff which is good and bet because right now
2812.16s:  everybody's holding on and so you can jump in on these things for 85k on a duplex and then if the market goes up
2818.72s:  because people get emotional start buying again I'm like oh boy sure I'll take 140 for that thing I bought
2824.40s:  for 85 whereas the commercial side is like I got to play with the expenses I got to play with the rent
2830.32s:  I got to play with whatever to change the value of it there's a little bit of swing for market but it's
2834.64s:  much more driven by what you actually produce with the property which the blessing it occurs but I
2839.92s:  love it like most of the time you take over like a mom and pop property and it's very poorly managed and
2844.80s:  you can come in and I'm example we bought a hotel in December 130 units kind of a boutique like
2850.48s:  three pools wedding venue right outside the smoky mountains is pretty sick log cabin design like really cool
2857.60s:  very poorly managed we came in we were like wow this thing's not on booking it's not on
2861.44s:  expedia it's not on you know trailicity or travelosity or any of the normal like it's just on their
2867.36s:  website was on Airbnb or we turned everything on on week one and we had to refund like 15 people
2875.52s:  because we overbooked rooms that weren't actually occupiable and we're like well let's turn that back off
2880.16s:  and you know but here's a place that had been operating at like 30% occupancy and we basically filled
2886.56s:  it the next week with just understanding the basics of marketing well that if you get everything
2893.20s:  operationally where it needs to be and you do that you just effectively doubled or tripled the
2897.60s:  value of that property with a very few tweaks and so that's one of the reasons I like commercial
2904.00s:  like the residential side they'd be like cool you're bringing in more money the neighborhood house
2909.52s:  down the road still sold for this much so that's what it's worth commercial side it's like oh you
2915.60s:  just added you know 100 100 bucks and net operating income can be 60,000 or whatever I forget the
2922.24s:  math but it's like a hundred bucks is like a hundred and or one I think it's one dollar equals 166
2928.96s:  at a like 10 cap if you you know value increase so for every like 10 bucks it's 1600 bucks in
2935.20s:  value or for every you know that extrapolates if I raise the 10,000 then I'm trying to do really
2940.80s:  hard math in public but I think it's 10 grand a month net operating income or 10 grand a year net
2945.76s:  operating income would be like 160,000 added to the property value it's not hard to get that out
2951.12s:  of the right property right well it also sounds like a lot of the properties still that you deal with
2957.12s:  have ten in some capacity so yeah I'm not doing manufacturing stuff yet I'd love to get into that
2964.16s:  and store it whatever but storage is interesting actually if you ever want to do anything and
2968.96s:  storage let me know because I'm new to that as well but I'm interested in that also
2973.36s:  well my best friends has 12,000
2977.36s:  yeah and but he he's never needed money because he the first 20 bought he did so well that I'm
2984.00s:  always like hey let me know when you're buying another I'll raise with you and I'll be in on it
2987.04s:  and he's like yeah yeah cool but I can just pull the money out of this one and buy it myself so
2991.36s:  maybe next time I'm like damn it he's like he's crushing it what a bastard share whoever that
2996.88s:  is share with us I'm like you just just let me mouch yeah dude we're trying to get in on this too
3004.48s:  but like for storage units I I'm very interested in that but for menu factoring it's interesting
3009.44s:  because I've worked with some partners and what I found for menu factoring is in general it's
3016.08s:  really low turnover lower returns but really long terms it's like it's like a fucking ship
3024.40s:  they're very stable and I was kind of getting a bit of an understanding on why that was and
3030.32s:  like he actually took me for a walk around one of the properties and it's like to specialize
3034.08s:  manufacturing arrangement and like these guys have to set up everything how they want it
3039.84s:  that is a massive bear so menu factoring's interesting but probably a little less on my on my
3048.00s:  hit list I would love to see what you do with it though we'll see one of my buddies just built a
3054.48s:  I think it's a hundred thousand square foot facility maybe 120 I don't necessarily know but he
3060.48s:  he built a I mean he basically capitalized off COVID and built like they take like F-550s
3068.72s:  and turn them into like million two like 1.2 million dollar like bands for like super super well
3075.04s:  off like baller all-wheel drive duly at fucking off road vehicles and then now I think he started
3080.64s:  to build boats and stuff and he like started his garage and now he's in his own like he's
3086.40s:  renting a shop but yeah they just built themselves a warehouse I think they're about to open
3091.36s:  his new plant so he's he's the one that's like really got me thinking about it because he's like I
3095.44s:  can build for 11 dollars a square foot and I can rent for like them I don't remember the exact
3100.96s:  math but he's like moving it to that one and already planning on building two more to rent
3105.84s:  into someone else so that's actually really interesting especially like the the rate of change
3112.32s:  in the scale that he's going through there yeah we're coming up on time for you I know you have
3118.40s:  others should do a couple final questions when you look at the real estate market let's say for
3126.00s:  the next 18 months or so something like that what do you think was it look like
3136.16s:  it's a great question there's a lot of really weird factors with like the lock-in syndrome where
3141.84s:  people aren't selling houses because they why would they sell a 3% interest rate to move into a 7
3148.56s:  so there's not a lot of people selling supply and demand is off still because they have not cut up
3155.12s:  on building so there's still a dramatic undercut of supply which makes me feel pretty confident
3160.64s:  because it's hard to totally tank a market if people still need places to live and still want
3165.20s:  like more people want to buy than can you know I mean the interest rate game like
3172.88s:  if they go too much higher and they hold it too much longer I think we'll be seeing a full scale
3178.72s:  depression and or or or maybe not depression but dent per se in the economy and then it won't
3185.44s:  really matter if real estate takes a little bit of a bump because it's not going to be like everything
3189.52s:  will if they lower them I think real estate is going to take off running again and so it's kind of a
3195.12s:  weird game I think I think honestly my my assumption is that rates are probably the biggest deciding
3200.40s:  factor right now and what the market does but I think we're kind of in a slow upward and it's like
3206.64s:  if they drop rates that'll increase in speed and if they raise rates that'll slow in speed but I
3211.60s:  don't see a real estate related to massive crash in the next 18 months like everyone's calling for
3217.04s:  it but they're thinking back to oh eight I don't think I think if something tumbles and I've been
3221.04s:  saying this for probably two years if something tumbles I don't think it's going to be led by real estate
3225.68s:  I think it's either going to be led by banks by the auto industry by you know consumer debt
3232.08s:  I mean there's a couple things that I think will default long before real estate does because
3235.76s:  you know 60 or 70% of homeowners refinanced 21 to 22 and their debt is under 4% if not under 3%
3244.16s:  so it's really hard to imagine a world for me where you know Mr. Homeowner can't afford
3249.20s:  there two and a half to a quarter percent interest rate home loan unless they got laid off
3255.92s:  they got all this other debt that added up so that doesn't necessarily answer your question
3262.00s:  I'm still fairly bullish on the real estate market as a whole but I'm also thinking long term like
3265.92s:  I don't plan on selling most of the stuff in the next decade so it doesn't matter yeah well it
3270.72s:  doesn't answer my question because the whole idea is we're we're taking a guess at the future
3274.72s:  right nobody fucking notes at the point so yeah so the idea is just to see how you're thinking about it
3279.36s:  and at least from a market perspective we're definitely starting to get closer to cuts they're
3284.40s:  the fetish forecasting three cuts this year there's only four opportunities left for them to do
3289.36s:  so the next cut opportunity where the probability of a 25 basis point drop is in June is over 50%
3296.88s:  chance right now based on the repo market so we'll probably start to see some cuts towards the
3303.60s:  middle slash end of summer is what I'm in at least from the stock market perspective yeah I would
3309.52s:  I would imagine from just a societal standpoint that that happens before the election before the
3315.12s:  election and then post election it goes back up but that's just because I'm a schmuck who is
3320.24s:  convinced that I'm not going to say my exact quote on this thoughts while we're recording but
3325.84s:  essentially politics is a doozy so yeah well I tell you what would be a doozy is if they cut and
3332.48s:  raised again that I I would take the under on that bet I doubt we they raise again but I don't
3339.20s:  want to counter the first part of your back so I think that's okay yeah how do you get reelected
3344.00s:  you fix the economy in six months well we'll wrap you up here where can people get a hold of you
3352.48s:  if they're interested really it's I think if they're interested in like seeing how bad the catfish
3356.96s:  is but if they also want to learn about real estate or whatever well they just want to see the catfish
3362.32s:  just go to YouTube for military money but but the best place I tell people to connect is to go to
3368.08s:  loveespodcastguest.com and you can download my free book and find all my social media
3373.76s:  I bought the domain yeah it might be you but I bought the domain I did that to a friend the other day
3380.64s:  I called him I was like hey man I just wanted you to know I believe in you so much that I bought
3384.80s:  your domain name he's like what do you mean I was like I now own you know first name last name
3389.84s:  .com he's like I hate you I was like Merry Christmas it's absolutely awesome I love that we'll
