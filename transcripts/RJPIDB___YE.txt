0.00s: We're going to dive into option liquidity.
3.44s: What it is, what to look for, how to assess it.
7.04s: I'm going to give you a checklist.
8.20s: I'm going to give you some real examples along the way.
10.60s: So that you understand what it actually looks like
12.88s: in a practical scenario, what things impact it and how.
17.60s: So at the end of the video,
18.56s: you should have a really good understanding
21.36s: of how to assess and find liquid options.
25.00s: What's up, everyone?
25.68s: Eric here.
26.52s: Welcome back to all the outliers.
27.52s: Shout out to the Patreon family.
29.28s: Let's get right in.
30.40s: So what is option liquidity?
32.12s: It's essentially the ability to transact at a fair price
36.44s: when you want.
37.88s: The vast majority of instances where
39.78s: retail traders are putting in orders,
41.20s: we are consuming liquidity because we're
43.80s: replacing an order.
44.48s: It gets filled.
45.48s: You've just taken an order off the market
48.28s: that somebody else could have used.
49.80s: And somebody gave you the ability to transact there.
52.96s: That's liquidity.
54.44s: Now, if you submit an order and it's resting,
58.00s: well, then actually you're giving somebody else the ability
61.08s: to trade.
61.56s: You're providing liquidity with that position.
64.48s: So just some nuance.
66.56s: Now, I want to talk about some of the massive mistakes
70.40s: people make with respect to liquidity.
72.68s: And this is the biggest one.
74.92s: There are two key components of an options trade.
79.84s: The entry and the exit.
82.72s: Traders are really good at analyzing liquidity
86.00s: when we're trying to get in.
87.20s: Once we know we should, what most traders are not good at
90.52s: is conceptualizing liquidity when we're
94.00s: looking to exit the trade.
95.84s: What this could look like when we're
97.16s: ready to get out because these different forces can
101.04s: impact liquidity.
102.12s: And at the end of the video, you'll
103.60s: be able to have a much better idea what
105.46s: liquidity might look like when you're getting out.
108.28s: Because what's really frustrating is if you put on a trade,
111.60s: you struggle to get in.
113.76s: Then you have this big fat profit that you're sitting on.
116.84s: And then when you try to get out, you can't exit at a fair price.
119.96s: So then you start giving up your profits
122.64s: because you have to adjust your price in order to try and exit.
126.80s: We want to avoid that.
128.48s: So there's a few metrics that we care about.
130.68s: This isn't really a holistic list.
132.56s: There's a few more things that you'll hear throughout the video.
135.04s: But these are kind of the primary ones we can start with.
137.40s: The number of expiration cycles is a really simple test
140.60s: of liquidity because they only offer more expiration cycles
145.16s: when there's demand for them.
147.28s: Meaning there's enough volume in people
149.96s: transacting to drive liquidity.
151.68s: That's why if we take a look at something like QQQ,
155.12s: you can see that it has a bunch of these extra expiration
158.32s: cycles.
159.16s: Standard expiration cycle is just the third Friday of the month.
164.12s: So right here is a standard expiration cycle.
167.00s: You'll notice that there's a ton of additional ones
169.20s: around this.
171.04s: If you take a look at CNX, you'll notice
173.16s: that this is a product that only has standard expiration cycles.
176.60s: And this is very common.
177.68s: We are now just seeing options becoming more popular
181.04s: in things like spy being able to offer essentially daily
184.40s: expiration cycles, which is very cool.
186.76s: But that's the first thing you can look for
189.60s: to see if something's liquid or not.
190.92s: Does it have weekly expiration cycles?
193.64s: And if so, it's probably slightly more liquid.
196.28s: And for me, that's a primary filter I use just because it's easier.
199.64s: You can look.
200.48s: It's about 550 products that will have weekly expiration cycles
205.20s: and they're typically more liquid than those that don't.
208.16s: We care a lot about the bid-ask spread,
210.52s: which we're going to talk a lot about in this video.
213.40s: Now, a quick cliff notes of that.
215.92s: If you look at any option, right?
217.92s: So let's look at this at the money call.
220.92s: The bid-ask spread tells you essentially where you have
225.24s: to transact that if you want to get a fill this instant.
228.76s: So what that means is the bid is the most somebody
232.64s: is willing to pay for something right now.
235.24s: The offer is the cheapest somebody's
238.44s: willing to sell something at.
240.08s: This is the bid-ask spread.
241.36s: This is what market makers and other market providers
244.12s: are typically trying to capture.
246.28s: And it's kind of the same thing if you go to an airport
248.44s: and there's a currency exchange.
249.84s: They typically will buy lower than what they'll sell at
252.88s: and they capture that difference.
254.80s: That's what's happening here.
256.20s: So if you want to get a fill this instant,
257.96s: they're showing you where you have to go in order to get there.
260.68s: Now, smart traders will try to play what we call the mid price,
264.84s: the difference between these.
266.52s: And you can typically get a fill in there,
268.36s: but it's not guaranteed.
269.24s: And sometimes you have to move it around
270.76s: if you pennies to find your fill.
272.96s: But if you want to get a fill right now,
275.60s: you have to go to the bid or the offer
278.08s: or you can submit something like a market order.
279.88s: But that's typically a worse fill,
282.76s: meaning you don't get a great price.
284.24s: You don't get a good bargain, which we want to avoid.
287.40s: You can then also look at things like the volume
291.16s: for the options chain, for the individual strike
294.16s: you're looking at.
295.36s: Those matter quite a lot.
298.08s: We also care about the total open interest.
300.72s: What delta your option is the days to expiration?
304.32s: We didn't tell all of these impact your options liquidity,
308.32s: but they all do.
310.36s: So let's talk about these.
312.36s: When we think about the impact of an underlying price
316.64s: on liquidity, one of the effects that you'll notice
319.32s: is that if we look at more expensive underlines,
322.36s: they will naturally have wider bid-ask spreads.
325.32s: So if I grab something like MSTR, which is a $1,500 product
330.80s: give or take, you'll notice that the liquidity here,
333.28s: it's much wider.
334.60s: So if I'm looking at an at the money, 49 DTE,
337.88s: out of the money, but it's at the money call,
340.92s: the bid on this is $196.30, and the offer
346.32s: is $212.
348.24s: So it's a pretty big bid-ask spread.
351.44s: It's like 16 points, but it's a $1,500 product.
355.96s: If we take a look at something like Spy,
357.56s: which is still pretty expensive, it's $5.32,
360.28s: but you'll see that these for the at the money,
363.40s: they're $16.86 by 17.39.
367.68s: So much smaller of a bid-ask spread
369.92s: than what you just saw on MSTR, but it's also much cheaper.
373.16s: And then you can look at something even cheaper still,
375.60s: like maybe QLD, which is $86.
379.28s: And you'll see that this kind of varies a little bit,
382.32s: but this is $6 by 690.
384.64s: This is actually a less liquid product
386.56s: because do you notice how many expiration cycles there are?
389.76s: There's just not that many.
391.40s: And then if we take a look at the overall open interest
393.92s: across a different series of expiration cycles,
396.72s: there's 9,000 options.
399.12s: But then if we take a look comparatively to Spy,
401.68s: look at all these different expiration cycles,
404.52s: and then take a look at the open interest,
405.76s: there's 8.8 million options.
408.68s: So there's a few things you should have picked up
412.44s: from what I just shared.
414.24s: The first thing is that the price of the underlying impacts
417.52s: the liquidity of your option.
419.28s: More expensive underlines will typically
422.48s: have wider bid-ask spreads, less liquid options,
425.64s: on a relative basis.
428.00s: As volatility expands, that will impact your options liquidity,
433.24s: which we'll take a look at.
434.88s: The type of strike also impacts your options liquidity.
439.36s: So what does that mean?
440.92s: Well, if we take a look at something like Jimmy,
445.32s: and we take a look at these 14 DTE options,
449.04s: let's take a look at the open interest for some of these options.
453.24s: Let's take a look at these 21.5.
455.48s: Notice that it's 21.5.
457.84s: The liquidity on those options of the current OI
460.32s: is 204 options.
464.36s: But if I look at the 21s, there are 1,033,
469.44s: or if I look at the 22s, there are 2,590.
472.72s: So what I'm showing you is a standard strike price
476.40s: is going to have more liquidity,
478.08s: more often than not, than half strike prices
480.84s: or other kinds of strike prices.
482.88s: The other thing you'll notice is that round numbers,
485.84s: things like 20, 25, 30,
488.52s: will tend to have more open interest in tighter options.
491.96s: Let's take a look.
492.92s: These 20s, there's 9,000 options.
496.84s: Then if we take a look at the 21s, there's a 1,000.
499.12s: If we take a look at the 22s, there's 2,500.
501.80s: And then let's see what happens when we get to 25.
504.36s: There's 17,800 options.
506.88s: This is just human psychology at play.
509.68s: We like round numbers, and that's all this is.
512.56s: So now you know the price of the underlying impacts it
515.88s: and how you know that the strike type impacts it and how,
519.68s: meaning if it's a weird strike
521.92s: or if it's a standard strike or if it's a round number or not.
526.00s: We also know things like further out of the money
529.68s: or in the money can impact our options.
532.92s: So let's take a look what that looks like.
535.24s: If we take a look at these deep in the money options,
538.24s: you'll see that they're bid 16, 70 by 17, 40.
543.16s: But then if you take a look at these at the money options,
545.88s: their bid 92 cents offered $1.
549.60s: Much tighter than the in the monies.
551.72s: And then typically as you get further out of the money,
553.92s: the same thing will happen.
554.92s: Why is this?
555.92s: Because the market is more liquid when more people
559.12s: are transacting at those levels and the majority of instances,
563.12s: people transact at two points.
565.56s: Options that are nearer in expiration.
568.76s: So typically within 30 days, you'll see more options activity
572.64s: and options that are closer to at the money
575.12s: tend to be more active.
576.80s: So as you go further out in time,
581.40s: you'll notice that options become less active.
583.64s: And I'll show you, again, using GameStop.
585.40s: Right now the average open interest is 556,000.
589.32s: So if we take a look, let me just do it as all really quick.
592.72s: So it'll be a little easier to see.
594.56s: Let's take a look at two different expiration cycles.
597.36s: This is a standard expiration cycle,
599.88s: which is the third Friday of the month.
602.28s: This will typically be more liquid
604.72s: than other weekly expiration cycles.
607.04s: So as I said before, I like to look if they offer weeklies,
610.40s: but I still try to stay in the standard
612.36s: expirations because they're going to be more liquid.
614.88s: So if we take a look at this 16-OG,
617.88s: you'll see that we have 228,000 calls
620.56s: against 107,000 puts.
623.00s: So about 330,000 ish.
625.72s: If we go further out in time to this 18 October,
628.44s: which is a standard expiration,
629.68s: but there's 90,000 and 62,000.
632.08s: Way less options.
633.56s: And this is standard.
634.40s: This is not unique to GameStop.
635.72s: This is very, very common for pretty much any other product
638.04s: that you'll find.
639.20s: So we now know that as you go further out of the money
644.04s: or in the money,
645.24s: and if you're using longer dataed expiration,
647.24s: you're going to see less liquidity.
648.84s: So then how does volatility impact it very simply?
653.48s: As volatility expands, bid-ask spreads widen.
658.16s: And I'll have a specific example for you
661.16s: to take a look at.
662.36s: But if you take a look at something like QQQ,
665.16s: as volatility has been expanding,
667.64s: that's what these yellow lines represent,
670.12s: the options have become wider bid-ask spread.
675.04s: And that serves as a natural breaking function
678.36s: for crazy runaway markets.
680.32s: Now again, I'll show you an example of that in a minute.
683.64s: So let's talk about how can you conceptualize liquidity?
687.64s: How do you know if something is liquid or not?
691.84s: You can create a benchmark.
694.56s: So what I would do is take a look at the underlying
697.76s: that you want to trade.
698.72s: We need to know what the DTE, what the Delta,
701.80s: what the type of option, whether it's a caller or put.
704.36s: And then we take the bid-ask spread
706.68s: as a percentage of the strike price.
708.40s: This creates a bid-ask ratio.
710.76s: I'll show you what it looks like.
712.28s: And then find the same option in Spy and Compare it.
716.40s: So in this example, if I want to compare McDonald's
720.44s: and I want to use the 49 DTE expiration
723.00s: first strike out of the money, this is a 47 Delta,
725.36s: something like that, I'll take that down
727.48s: and then I'll look at it.
728.52s: And then I'll come over to Spy,
730.28s: I'll find that same 49 DTE.
732.32s: I'll find something that's right out of the money.
734.32s: In this case, it's a 54 Delta.
736.16s: So you could also compare the actually same Delta,
739.96s: which in this case is a 47 Delta.
742.72s: So if I grab that same 47 Delta 49 DTE option,
749.08s: so that I'm comparing the same thing across the board,
751.80s: I grab QQQ Spy, MSTR and MCD for your reference.
755.52s: And for those that are in the outlier Pro Patreon,
758.96s: I'll have a download for this just as a template.
761.20s: Super simple to make.
762.80s: All you do is take the same strike
764.60s: to make sure you're comparing the same thing,
766.20s: take the bid-ask, make sure it's the same type of option.
769.08s: You figure out the bid-ask spread
770.76s: and then you take a ratio of the bid-ask by the strike price.
774.68s: And this will help you understand what's liquid.
776.68s: So in this case, we can see Qs are actually even more liquid
780.04s: than Spy.
781.00s: And we can see that MCD is pretty liquid
783.28s: and we can see on a relative basis, MSTR,
786.04s: is not super liquid.
787.84s: Now you'll get a feel for what actually is liquid and isn't.
792.60s: But in this case, something that's less than a percent
795.56s: of bid-ask spread, I'm not super concerned about it.
799.04s: That's about okay.
800.40s: However, go back to this point.
802.80s: This is to enter the position.
804.84s: So we know right now that the market
806.52s: is a little bit more volatile, things are selling off.
809.48s: So if I think it's going to be less volatile in the future,
813.92s: then this should be about as bad as it's going to get
816.56s: in terms of liquidity.
817.88s: Now, if I think it might be even more volatile
821.16s: when I'm exiting, I have to expect this to guide up.
824.52s: And if it guides up too far, then I have a problem.
826.96s: So here is a quick checklist you can use.
830.32s: I typically am going to stick to things that are above $5
833.56s: is an underlying, just for general best practice.
836.00s: I like weekly explorations.
837.80s: You can make this comparison just like I showed you.
840.60s: And there's one other component.
842.88s: Based on how often I'm planning on transacting matters.
846.76s: So for example, if I'm trading something like a covered call
849.04s: where I'm not really expecting to do anything
851.04s: once I sell the option, it'll either be out of the money
853.68s: and expire or be in the money and I'll be assigned.
856.88s: I don't actually care quite that much.
859.56s: Because I'm not transacting that much.
861.44s: But if I'm trading something like a ratio diagonal,
863.64s: which has more options legs that I'm moving around a lot
867.08s: or if I'm trading zero DTEs, I need a lot of liquidity
870.48s: because I'm transacting a lot.
872.52s: So what this means is the more you transact,
876.28s: the more liquid you need the underlying to be.
879.44s: Now, there's one other example I want to show you.
881.36s: And this is looking at a stop.
884.16s: And I'm looking at two different time frames for a comparison.
889.24s: Take a look at the periods I'm going to show you.
892.16s: Here, which is the second of May and here,
895.08s: which is the seventh.
896.60s: What do you think the difference in liquidity
898.60s: in just this is after this move?
901.52s: Notice how I'm not using an extreme.
903.40s: I'm not using any of these days.
905.64s: I'm comparing the liquidity between this day and this day.
908.60s: What do you think you're going to see
909.52s: throughout in the comments?
910.68s: And then I'll show you.
911.96s: I looked at two different time frames, the 15 and 50 DTE
915.96s: on second May.
917.16s: And I looked at the same aspirations.
918.92s: So then they became 10 DTE and 45 DTE, which, as you know,
922.72s: these are getting closer to expiration.
924.68s: So these should actually be more liquid.
927.44s: So let's see what this looked like.
930.04s: I'm comparing the call and the put side,
932.56s: the bid as the bid as spread.
934.68s: And then I'm looking at a delta here.
936.32s: I tried to normalize closest.
938.12s: So most of these are not perfectly 75 or 50 delta.
941.32s: But they're definitely less than 0.05 off.
945.24s: So it's the closest I can find to these.
947.96s: And you'll see that, again, in kind of that 2 May period,
951.88s: that for the at the monies, we typically
954.68s: see better bid as spreads, meaning they're tighter.
957.88s: That's standard fare.
959.88s: And we also see that the closer DTE has tighter bid as spread,
965.00s: which is also standard fare.
966.04s: You know all of that now.
968.16s: Now let's see what happened on the 7th of May.
971.64s: If we take a look at the options,
973.36s: take a look at how massively the bid as spread
977.52s: changed in this scenario.
980.04s: The reason why I'm highlighting this scenario,
982.36s: and that should be a 1.11.
985.44s: Got that doctor right up for us.
987.24s: And you'll notice across the board
990.12s: that the bid as spreads widened.
992.28s: And you can see some of them widened by a lot.
994.56s: If we look at this 0.5 delta,
997.60s: we went from a 0.07 spread to 0.29,
1002.04s: a massive change.
1004.00s: So what I'm highlighting to you is in this example,
1007.48s: this isn't even that big of a move.
1008.96s: And it's up typically when things are going up,
1012.28s: volatility declines, and spreads
1014.76s: would be a little bit more favorable to us.
1017.04s: But in this case, you can see during this up move,
1019.56s: it's a different scenario.
1021.00s: Valtility actually expanded, and that widened the bid as spread.
1025.96s: But what I'm highlighting is this isn't even an extreme.
1028.96s: This is a relatively mellow move for something like GameStop.
1031.84s: It went from 11 to 16, big move, but not crazy.
1036.20s: And definitely not something like from 17 to 80 pre-market.
1041.00s: So you have to consider what you're trading
1043.60s: and the lifecycle of the trade to make sure
1045.84s: that it is liquid for you.
1047.84s: If you have any questions, as always,
1049.20s: let me know being outlier.
1050.84s: See you guys later.
