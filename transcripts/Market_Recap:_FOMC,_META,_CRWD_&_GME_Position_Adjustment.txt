0.68s: sup outliers 31 July what happened in
3.64s: the market today well a few things and
5.40s: we're going to talk about it as you can
7.00s: see in the top left- hand side might be
8.92s: a little bit small actually can't
10.40s: increase the tech size there
11.76s: unfortunately but uh wanted to give you
13.72s: an outline of what we're looking at
14.96s: today I'm going to talk about fomc the
17.16s: indices meta crowd strike and then our
20.12s: fabled gme at the end for any of the
24.04s: Apes that aren't interested in the rest
26.16s: of this stuff just skip towards the end
27.72s: of the video that will be where you want
29.32s: to be but everybody else let's start off
33.36s: here and the first thing I want to talk
36.32s: about is what happened today with big
39.52s: daddy J pal and what he's talking about
42.40s: and it's because it matters from a
43.92s: market perspective and you actually saw
46.16s: the market react pretty heavily to what
48.60s: this was talking about today I actually
50.32s: had some Zer DTE SPX options on that I
53.48s: managed almost like halfway through his
56.44s: talk because I was watching them move as
58.52s: he was speaking made a decent bit of
61.24s: money today actually on the volatility
62.76s: there was a lot of volatility baked into
66.44s: the zero DTE today obviously I look at
68.72s: them every day so what did he say ah
71.88s: kind of not much to be honest but not
76.00s: much is also important because he
79.92s: continues this very steady drum beat of
83.36s: the same thing and he's messaging the
86.60s: same exact thing so here it obviously no
91.40s: surprise saying that the FED interest
95.24s: rate right now is hanging out still at
99.76s: 5.3% and there's a bunch of people
101.60s: saying that it should be lowered we've
103.32s: had those conversations at nauseum at
105.36s: this point and then you'll notice Powell
107.80s: said if inflation continues to fall a
109.76s: reduction in our policy rate could be on
111.80s: the table and this is standard messaging
113.76s: for him so far he's not over under
115.72s: selling and he's trying to keep the
117.76s: market from running away too fast on
119.92s: hopes but I mean let's be honest Market
123.36s: is going to do whatever the market wants
125.40s: to do and that's just kind of part of
128.44s: the game here now this I think is
131.24s: interesting he says we're getting closer
132.76s: to the point at which it will be
134.16s: appropriate to reduce the rate but we're
136.12s: not quite there and he's reiterating
138.52s: this point multiple times I think this
140.92s: is again very standard fair for what
144.76s: he's been talking about and you can see
147.68s: now interestingly enough that in the 18
151.16s: set meeting we're looking at a 12 and a
154.16s: half% probability of half a point coming
157.16s: off and 87 a half probability right now
161.04s: of a quarter point which I think I mean
163.64s: if I were to place table Stakes here I I
166.28s: would guess quarter point and it looks
167.96s: like a quarter point each successive
171.04s: meeting throughout the end of the year
172.88s: so this essentially would mean that we
175.24s: would have three Cuts potentially uh
178.16s: couple notes Here this isn't this is a
181.56s: overwhelming edge here right so 68%
184.44s: probability of 25 basis points on top of
187.56s: the previous from September plus the
189.64s: 99.3% which is essentially the
191.64s: probability of a total cut between this
193.96s: so the probability here is really good
197.08s: for the November meeting but you'll
198.88s: notice in December it's not quite as
201.20s: good necessarily and the reason why I
203.52s: say that is because my guess is after we
207.04s: have these two cuts if we have these two
209.80s: Cuts likely to have this one if this one
211.80s: goes which would still be my expectation
213.84s: cuz to me half a point seems viable here
216.48s: I don't know anything though I'm not
217.64s: Economist so as I say half a point seems
219.96s: viable that should mean nothing to
221.68s: anybody it doesn't mean anything to me
223.32s: that's what I think though so looking at
226.12s: December though my guess is based on how
229.52s: Powell has played this like really slow
231.84s: rolling a lot of this stuff right we're
233.36s: getting closer but not quite reduction
236.96s: on our policy could be on the table like
239.36s: he's being overly conservative in my
241.84s: opinion with respect to the messaging at
243.52s: this point so my guess is I would be
246.32s: surprised to see him go through three
248.44s: consecutive Cuts in a row without taking
251.52s: a pause somewhere to see what the
253.36s: feedback is because one of the most
254.80s: dangerous things here is if he cuts and
257.56s: then rates rise that becomes very
260.04s: problematic and it be kind of like
261.84s: letting a genie out of the bottle and
263.40s: you got to try to stuff it back in and
264.84s: if you've seen Aladdin the genie does
267.12s: not like going back in especially when
268.68s: Jafar gets him and yeah you know get
270.72s: gets out of hand fast so that's what I'm
273.92s: seeing here overall punchline Market
277.12s: liked this news today and we'll talk
279.52s: about the indices now in relation to
282.68s: that so let's navigate away from meta
287.68s: and let's start with the broad indic
290.64s: overview which is right
292.56s: here and the e- minis are still happy
295.88s: they had a huge day today and they're
299.08s: rallying up now still NASDAQ is up and
302.36s: the Russell the Russell had a
304.40s: fascinating day if we take a look at
306.24s: small caps they had this was just a day
310.32s: of emotions look at this so it opened at
313.64s: 2262 rallied all the way up to 22 or I'm
318.20s: sorry to 2320 so essentially a 100 Point
322.00s: rally and then it closed at 22 like 72 I
326.80s: think I'm sorry yeah 2273
331.00s: so it ended up like a fivepoint day
334.84s: after being up like 100 points this a
337.08s: this is a crazy move in my opinion there
339.20s: very
340.16s: interesting this comes a lot during the
344.20s: conversation that paa had today right so
346.12s: if we Zoom this in to like uh I don't
348.64s: want to do it today one minute that's a
350.56s: little excessive let's do a one day five
352.36s: minute and you can see you can see
354.32s: exactly how the market reacted during
356.32s: his
357.44s: conversation oh man everything's great
359.92s: oh here we go that's kind of what
362.80s: happened here so there was a couple
365.44s: things I think that he talked about
368.00s: during the meeting that could lead to
369.92s: that kind of behavior but that the
371.20s: market is trying to front run this to a
372.76s: pretty big degree that's the that's the
374.32s: real punchline here and it's not to be
376.32s: it's not surprising the Russell has had
378.68s: a an amazing move so far this year uh
381.20s: playing a big game of catchup so as I
383.80s: look at something like the iwm
386.72s: specifically just cuz that's what I have
387.92s: in my little tracker here year date it's
390.00s: up
391.40s: 12.7% literally all of that 12.7%
394.68s: year-to-date return essentially happened
396.80s: from here starting on the 11th that's
400.52s: the that's the Lion Share of what
402.40s: happened which is nuts all of this was
404.68s: baked into small caps finally getting a
407.96s: glimpse of sunlight at the end of the
409.56s: tunnel with the rate environment
411.32s: potentially changing for them so that's
414.00s: what we're seeing across the indices r
416.00s: large the percentage of S&P 500 stocks
419.24s: above the 50 days 72% so still overall
421.72s: what I would consider to be in bullish
423.16s: territory The e- Minis and really just
425.72s: the S&P 500 in general to me is
427.56s: tentative here though I say that because
431.04s: we we're kind of at an important point I
433.68s: believe we started breaking down pretty
437.20s: reasonably meaning we broke down bounced
440.92s: around here Consolidated hanging right
442.92s: out on the 50-day moving average and
445.60s: it's starting to pop above here which is
447.68s: good to see and I think that this was
450.04s: kind of the near-term resistance it was
451.84s: going to have to navigate through and it
453.24s: kind of popped right up through it
454.60s: didn't really care so much here's where
456.08s: that resistance was based on this volume
457.92s: node so people are interested here which
460.08s: is good so uh rally on maybe that's more
465.56s: more likely than not what I'm seeing
467.28s: here at least as of now we're seeing
468.92s: breath indicators expand so if I slide
472.84s: myself out of the way so that you can
474.56s: see you'll see that this is for the
476.76s: NASDAQ but net highs lows is is moving
480.44s: up pretty meaningfully we see highs
483.76s: accelerating and we see lows
486.04s: decelerating so all in all that's a a
489.60s: generally bullish bread configuration to
492.40s: me and this is where I keep an eye on
495.32s: the market I want to see how I want to
496.60s: use my money and find awesome
499.36s: opportunities there are no shortage of
501.92s: them I want to switch to meta quick talk
505.00s: about their earnings at a really high
506.52s: level they had a great earnings release
510.20s: so they closed today at 47
513.08s: 483 and right now after hours they're at
515.36s: 508 and a
517.12s: halfish so you can see the breakdown of
521.84s: its earnings let's take a look through
524.08s: this quickly together so we see Q3
529.24s: revenue and it looks like they're their
534.00s: projections looked pretty good and
536.92s: they're holding off on quanti ative
539.76s: guidance for 25 into a Q4 so they're
541.72s: giving themselves a little bit of time
544.24s: to pull themselves together it says we
546.00s: anticipate our full year 24 Capital
548.24s: expenditures to be in the range of 37 to
550.16s: 40 billion updated from our prior range
552.88s: of 35 to 40
555.04s: billion while we continue to refine our
557.28s: plans for next year we expect
559.40s: significant Capital expenditures growth
561.96s: in 25 which is pretty cool as we invest
564.68s: to support our AI research and product
568.04s: development efforts so
570.04s: again the market is very excited about
573.12s: AI as it should be I believe it's one of
575.88s: those truly
577.56s: revolutionary technologies that we
579.52s: haven't seen since what I would consider
581.92s: to be the internet I think that this
584.08s: offers depending on how it scales and if
586.60s: the Terminator is spawned hopefully not
589.68s: I think AI can just change a lot of
593.00s: stuff so yeah overall it looks like this
597.20s: is interesting it says meta AI on track
599.80s: to be the most used AI assistant in the
601.88s: world by year end so they're really
604.08s: leaning into that segment and it's
606.28s: working well for them so far earnings is
608.96s: again they're coming off the shelf here
611.56s: still hovering right around 508 so up up
615.76s: almost 35 points a big run for them well
618.44s: 35 Plus so that's meta quick pivot over
622.80s: to CW oh yeah sorry before we do that I
625.68s: wanted to take a look at some meta
627.76s: options Market days on the ball there
630.88s: were
632.20s: 1.2 million calls to about 900,000 puts
637.08s: and then let's see what was isolated
638.56s: around this earnings release 103,000 to
641.28s: 87,000 so this is kind of like a a mix
643.60s: bag lots of people hedging positions out
645.32s: there is what I saw and then we got some
647.44s: solo Doo homies out here at the8 hundies
651.96s: swing for the fences is what I say good
654.40s: good forum so the option chains in here
658.12s: are uh pretty active
659.92s: all right so now let's get back over
661.36s: here and we need to take a quick look at
663.60s: crowd strike cuz this one's been
664.84s: interesting and lower she goes this has
667.76s: been pretty continual at this point this
669.76s: has been one of the easiest Fades I've
672.72s: come across in my trading career
675.28s: especially after I got back in after
677.88s: this breakdown and all I'm doing is
679.84s: sliding stops down and I mean I'll
682.36s: follow this as low as it goes I'm very
685.60s: very curious where that is I do see a
689.36s: volume node building here so you notice
691.60s: when it was transacting around here we
694.00s: started seeing these volume nodes
695.44s: expanding out as people are picking up
697.72s: shares and this one got out pretty far
700.36s: right so this is where the point of
701.60s: control is up here before the drop lots
703.28s: of people interested to hear but this is
705.36s: from before right so this volume node is
707.56s: built back here then this volume node
711.12s: you can tell is being built right now
713.40s: because it didn't trade back here
714.96s: earlier on this chart so people are
717.20s: interested in here now we see see today
720.20s: two things first thing I notied is the
722.40s: volume note is building a little bit
724.08s: slow but it needs more time to even see
726.44s: if we're going to outpace this one more
728.48s: importantly though volume today is
730.64s: slowing down so what I'm looking for is
733.92s: how much sale volume are we getting
737.24s: that's highly informative to me so here
739.68s: on this day the 29th there was 9.8
742.80s: million sale volume on the 30th 17
746.48s: million sale volume so sale volume is
748.60s: accelerating here it accelerated from
750.76s: here then today sale volume is down to 6
754.56s: 6.8 million so sale volume is slowing
756.80s: down does that mean that it's done I
759.04s: have no idea but what it does mean is
761.08s: right now this becomes where I manage
764.40s: the short to the upside give it more
766.76s: room to run if it feels like it I
768.84s: probably will set a prelim alert here to
771.44s: scale out a little bit if it starts
773.24s: making that run early enough otherwise I
776.72s: I will follow this thing into the dirt
779.20s: happily and to be I I have nothing wrong
782.04s: with crutch strike it's just doing
783.24s: exactly what I want which is very rare
784.80s: as a Trader as most of you probably know
787.08s: but what I'm highlighting here is the
788.40s: importance of following a trade through
790.44s: not just immediately seeing from here
792.88s: when I got my breakdown and then just
794.80s: bouncing as soon as it started
796.36s: consolidating like let the trade work if
798.76s: you move your stops down give it enough
800.40s: room it again something with this kind
802.60s: of weakness just flow with it now the
805.80s: other thing I will note in here though
807.40s: is I do believe whenever this does Turn
810.36s: Around It offers a inverse opportunity
812.92s: where we probably have overextended this
815.04s: and then some in my opinion at this
816.48s: point I think we're at an extreme but
819.08s: that doesn't mean that we stop and it
820.32s: doesn't mean we're not at an extreme the
821.52s: Market's going to determine what that is
823.24s: but I would not be surprised at all to
826.28s: see this whenever the dust starts to
828.40s: settle the news Cales down to see a nice
830.68s: rally out of crowd strike we will see
834.08s: all right last thing the bell of the
836.72s: ball gme
839.36s: first and
841.00s: foremost got a positive print today so
844.04s: we landed up
846.28s: 1.21% which was really nice to see big
849.24s: fan and it looks like unfortunately
852.68s: though in my opinion that we didn't make
855.24s: much Headway above and again this is
857.12s: just a line right I don't want people to
858.48s: look at this and be like well I can't
859.60s: believe it's not breaking through that
860.84s: resistance it's just a line I drew this
862.84s: yesterday it doesn't mean anything the
864.72s: the price will go through it whenever it
866.00s: feels like it but I did want to see it
869.80s: go through it today and it did you see
871.88s: if we Zoom this in that we had some
874.56s: interest above here but then it
876.60s: collapsed back down a little bit so a
879.32s: bit of mixed price action that's what I
881.68s: call it today in GameStop but I love
885.08s: that it's starting to fight back here
887.20s: and it's difficult to see but do you
889.72s: notice the black Zone here and or maybe
893.72s: just take my word for it there's a
895.20s: volume node right here is what I'm
896.56s: showing you and I love seeing this
899.20s: volume node all the way out here because
902.52s: this is what I was talking about in
903.96s: terms of really wanting to see people
906.56s: buying in and filling in this giant gap
911.00s: of a volume node the reason why I care
913.12s: about that is because it tells me where
914.40s: people are interested in transacting so
916.84s: for example what I'm I've shown you guys
918.44s: before is like this is devoid of volume
921.44s: nobody really traded in this level so
925.04s: frequently as price drift towards that
927.40s: level it becomes either an place where a
929.40s: new volume node will be built if there's
931.08s: interest or a place where people aren't
933.40s: interested in transacting RIT large so
936.80s: this is cool to see because it means
938.56s: people are starting to want to transact
940.00s: at these levels which is fantastic now
942.64s: let's take a look at the options
945.88s: chain
947.44s: and I see a bit of a slowing down
952.36s: process in terms of the gap between
955.04s: calls and puts I see 676 th000 calls to
959.16s: 374,000 puts again that's just
961.28s: reiterating when I see GameStop in like
963.36s: it's really bullish configuration
965.16s: there's at least two to one calls to
968.08s: puts but again options are derivatives
972.60s: their values are derived from an
974.48s: underlying contract so if the gme starts
978.32s: getting bid up you probably will see the
980.24s: options start getting more active but
982.80s: it's also kind of interesting because
984.76s: sometimes options lead things a little
986.36s: bit which is what happened actually
987.84s: during the squeeze that we saw here
990.44s: options started getting active before
992.48s: these moves so people were positioning
994.84s: for this to in some degree which is just
997.76s: very interesting to me we'll take a look
1000.04s: at more at that tomorrow during the gme
1002.76s: live stream so when I see this now I'm
1006.56s: seeing a lot of buildout in 16 a which
1009.72s: continues to reiterate that same message
1011.52s: the takeaway in my opinion from a
1013.36s: trading perspective from there is that
1015.20s: people are interested as I would expect
1017.80s: them to be in the 16 OG expiration and
1020.88s: this is just the next standard
1022.68s: expiration there's definitely some hype
1024.96s: built up around early Aug which I'm also
1027.28s: hyped to see how it goes but this is
1030.08s: also people moving out to the next
1031.48s: primary expiration cycle the other thing
1033.00s: I noticed is this here where in six sep
1036.64s: we can see that we have 103% IV that
1039.60s: tells me something's coming up then and
1041.56s: I look over here and I see earnings and
1044.24s: earnings is on the fourth as it sits now
1046.24s: before the market so again this is how
1047.60s: you can use options to come up with
1048.96s: ideas on where we think something might
1052.36s: be going on cuz I can see 92 83 90 right
1055.60s: so we're looking at like the high 80s
1057.24s: low 90s here and then something at 100
1059.40s: that's anomalous so that's what that is
1062.48s: though it's I could tell something and
1064.00s: it's just earnings so looking at the
1066.00s: transactions today there is 110,000
1068.16s: calls transacted against 37,000 puts
1070.80s: which is great that will build out this
1073.92s: oi discrepancy the problem I have with
1076.76s: this unfortunately is just a of this is
1080.20s: in two a and we don't know exactly yet
1083.40s: how much is opening and closing volume
1085.52s: so we'll take a look at these 25s in two
1090.64s: Aug and let's see so we added
1094.44s: 3,920 over yesterday and there was
1096.52s: 10,000 that transacted today I'm
1098.24s: actually very interested to see what
1099.96s: this does tomorrow because it's not
1102.56s: clearly all going to be add but the
1106.48s: trade is running out of time and these
1108.48s: are decaying away super fast right so
1110.56s: these are mid point7 cents theya Decay 6
1113.68s: cents you wait another day your options
1115.76s: essentially become Worth US unless you
1117.08s: get a big price move so these become
1119.80s: really really dangerous to hold on to I
1122.28s: wouldn't be surprised to see some of
1123.76s: this 10,000 being closing out volume and
1126.68s: what I see the majority of time in
1128.32s: people doing this is trying to gain
1130.20s: exposure to the next to the next
1133.08s: expiration so the 25s here you can
1134.96s: already see are starting to get built
1136.44s: out there's 5,000
1138.88s: tracks oi 2000 volume 500 added over
1143.24s: yesterday so people are starting to
1144.52s: build out in the next nearest expiration
1147.64s: cycle but as I look at the overall oi
1151.44s: for n a it's still very quiet so 48,000
1155.40s: calls against 19,000 puts this is good
1159.28s: that it's 2 to one again a slightly more
1161.72s: bullish configuration but it's just
1163.72s: generally light for GameStop again for
1165.64s: comparison if we look at 16 off 220,000
1168.40s: against 107 in 16 Aug and as I continue
1171.92s: to reiterate a million times liquidity
1173.96s: is a thing here so today I actually made
1176.52s: some adjustments in my 20 step calls
1178.20s: they're still there this is just my uh
1180.36s: pass through account so it doesn't show
1181.84s: my positions but I still have long
1183.64s: shares and I still have short calls
1186.08s: against them but what I did for the
1187.44s: short calls is I actually rolled them
1189.56s: down closer to at the money do this for
1192.00s: two reasons in doing so I'm out in 20 SE
1196.64s: for a few reasons if I take a look at 30
1198.88s: Aug and I take a look at the Theta Decay
1201.32s: for the at the monies it's about 3 cents
1203.40s: 4 cents if I look at 37 DTE it's about 3
1207.12s: cents 4 cents if I look at 51 DTE it's
1210.40s: about 3 cents so by going further out in
1213.00s: time I'm not actually pulling away a
1216.04s: bunch of theta Decay from my options
1217.92s: from the short calls against the long
1219.68s: shares I have to continue to remind
1221.64s: people of that because as soon as people
1223.00s: hear short calls they think I'm baiting
1224.92s: GameStop and I'm not I'm I'm long
1226.96s: GameStop now that's also not to say that
1229.40s: I I've absolutely traded GameStop to
1231.64s: these down moves but I just maintained
1233.92s: long shares during it I will use options
1236.76s: to trade price movement both directions
1238.80s: that's one of the the fascinating things
1240.24s: about GameStop is that it moves around a
1242.24s: lot and the long share is a component of
1245.40s: the trade but then I also have options
1247.68s: that I can deploy to try to extract as
1251.12s: much as I can from Gamestop build a
1254.00s: position out so anyways back to this
1255.88s: though when I see this I'm not really
1259.08s: giving up on Theta Decay and I'm giving
1261.88s: myself a little bit lighter gamma so
1265.92s: here the gamma is eight here the gamma
1269.04s: is five the reason why that matters
1270.92s: because these will just move a little
1271.96s: bit slower which is what I want from a
1273.96s: short option I want to just pull in the
1276.08s: premium as I can I don't want it to fly
1278.52s: around too much and by keeping them a
1280.76s: little further out in time I don't want
1282.36s: 51 days to be clear I would prefer this
1284.16s: to be like 40 but there's no 40-day
1287.32s: expiration and these are are less liquid
1289.84s: than where I'm at now so I'm making sure
1292.92s: that I'm maintaining upside profit
1294.56s: potential but I'm keeping a higher Delta
1296.24s: on these short calls so that if GameStop
1298.76s: does have a bit of a consolidation
1301.00s: period or a down move I can again make
1303.24s: some money on the short calls and roll
1305.56s: those into either long options when I
1308.20s: decide to play it to the upside but it's
1311.56s: kind of moving with the product as much
1313.32s: as I might want it to do one thing or
1314.84s: the other I I don't get to pick I have
1316.84s: to play the game as it chooses to play
1319.36s: the game and my job is to work with it
1321.72s: as best as possible so that's what I
1324.96s: have going on that's what I'm looking at
1326.36s: right now I will see you guys tomorrow
1328.84s: during the GameStop live stream for
1330.28s: those interested and then Friday is
1332.68s: options trading for beginners we have
1335.20s: another part to that series come hang
1336.76s: out learn about options be an outlier
1338.96s: see you guys later
