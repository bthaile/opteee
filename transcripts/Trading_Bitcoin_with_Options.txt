0.36s: trading Bitcoin using options it's about
3.48s: time so for a long time you can only
5.92s: really gain exposure through the
7.20s: underlying itself which is fine I still
9.12s: have an outright Bitcoin holding in and
11.32s: of itself but as you all know I'm an
14.00s: options Trader and there's really really
15.68s: awesome opportunity in something like
18.56s: Bitcoin so I want to talk about a
21.28s: coverage strangle strategy that I'm
23.32s: going to be running in Bitcoin for the
25.76s: rest of this year and I'm going to
26.84s: provide to you periodic updates but
28.76s: first I want to intr roduce you to the
31.32s: position why it is what it is how I'm
33.84s: setting it up what I've done so far and
37.12s: why I'm using the ticker that I'm using
39.52s: which is I bit so first things first
43.56s: quick overview of the covered strangle I
45.64s: will throw a couple links in the
49.00s: description so you can check out the
50.64s: actual coverage strangle option strategy
52.44s: I have a whole playlist on it so you can
54.16s: get into detail this is not going to get
55.64s: into that I'm just going to provide you
56.76s: a quick overview so you know what we're
58.32s: talking about and there's three
60.36s: components in its mature form but it's
64.36s: not always all three components it can
66.56s: be 1 2 three like that different
69.04s: components to it can be on at a given
70.68s: point in time so the base position the
73.20s: primary profit mechanism is going to be
75.68s: being longest security and we're trying
79.00s: to play Direction that's the base
81.36s: position that is the primary profit
84.04s: mechanism for this trade then there are
86.28s: two additional components where we
88.52s: include options we have a ratio covered
91.88s: call and then we have cash secured puts
95.64s: this option component allows us to
98.84s: include a volatility and a Theta aspect
103.36s: to our position and it also allows us to
107.00s: dollar cost average into the underlying
110.92s: using a variable entry point so what
115.40s: that means is we might go out into the
117.24s: broad market and buy the shares outright
120.20s: that's a lot of times how it will start
122.52s: then we can use things like cash secured
124.68s: puts I referred to them as satellite
127.04s: positions what that means is the base
129.68s: position long equity and we will have
132.72s: cash secured puts but the cool part
134.52s: about cash secured puts is you can move
136.32s: them so if something starts rolling over
138.92s: and you're like well I still want to add
140.60s: into it but it seems like we're in a bit
143.56s: of a decline so I might roll the short
146.48s: puts so that I can get a better basis as
149.20s: I continue to scale into the underlying
151.76s: now the entire premise of this thing is
155.44s: that you are trading something that you
157.44s: want to hold the way to think about it
160.28s: is that if I was setting up a Buy and
163.08s: Hold portfolio this is something I would
165.56s: want in it meaning whatever the ultimate
168.40s: sizing that the trade gets the entire
172.08s: purpose behind the rest of this is just
173.56s: to optimize that holding so the way that
176.44s: this works is I'll show you my little
178.44s: tracker you've probably seen different
179.96s: versions of this and what I'm sampling
183.12s: is a
184.52s: $125,000 allocation to ibit what this
189.60s: ultimately means is I essentially would
192.76s: be prepared to buy
194.64s: $125,000 of ibit in a portfolio as
197.64s: shares and just hold it that's what the
199.80s: allocation is then there's utilization
202.80s: which is how much of that total
204.84s: allocation I'm using at a given point in
206.52s: time which is right now $80,000
210.04s: the reason why I'm using this amount of
212.36s: money is I actually have a bigger
213.88s: position that's not part of this I'm
216.24s: breaking out part of the bigger position
218.96s: just like I'm doing in the leveraged
220.28s: ETFs to use this as an example for us to
223.92s: learn together about the strategy how I
226.36s: operate it over a longer period of time
229.68s: so I'm purposely picking amounts of
232.04s: money that is probably more um relatable
235.56s: to people for the strategy so that you
237.44s: can understand the sizing of things
239.80s: relative to this amount of money so
243.36s: that's a quick overview of the position
247.96s: itself now I want to spend a few minutes
252.44s: talking about why there's a specific
255.20s: opportunity in something like ibit and
258.12s: the reason why I like ibit is because it
260.40s: allows me to play an overall bullish
263.08s: disposition on bitcoin I am bullish on
265.04s: bitcoin longer term it also adds an
268.80s: interesting Cor corelation relationship
272.00s: with
273.40s: equities so if we pop over to the
275.96s: platform and we take a look at the
278.16s: relationship here between something like
280.80s: Bitcoin Futures and the E minis Futures
285.84s: the S&P 500 futures contracts what I
287.96s: want you to take a look at is the
289.56s: different correlation values for
292.20s: different periods of time and the first
295.52s: thing that you'll notice is that the
298.04s: correlations are kind of all over the
299.48s: place
300.20s: right we can see 90-day correlations
302.72s: they tend to be pretty strong 60-day
304.48s: correlations tend to be strong but we
306.60s: can also see in shorter term time frames
308.52s: that the correlations can invert and
311.12s: actually offset one another and to help
314.20s: you know see this point a little more
316.60s: clearly if we grab two charts of this
319.68s: just so that you can see over a longer
321.12s: term time frame you can see that there's
323.12s: General alignment in terms of positive
325.08s: Drift But the composition of the moves
327.20s: is very different so the reason why this
329.72s: fits the portfolio well is because it's
332.24s: doesn't inherently add an a hedge but it
336.16s: does add a slightly different
338.20s: correlation to the portfolio and then
340.48s: this also allows me to capture the
343.08s: volatility of something like Bitcoin
346.48s: because again if we take a look first at
350.00s: ibit itself you can see that it's a
352.60s: really volatile ticker the current
354.52s: implied volatility in it is
356.68s: 63% as a raw number that's high now we
360.52s: don't have enough data on it yet because
362.84s: it's so new to give it an implied
365.52s: volatility percentile and an implied
367.80s: volatility rank so it'll be a little
369.84s: time before we actually have those
371.36s: metrics for ibit but on a gross dollar
374.40s: amount that's not an insignificant
376.60s: amount of volatility which is great to
378.68s: be able to trade that and options
381.12s: provide me access to that if I'm trying
383.28s: to trade the volatility and not through
386.12s: the directional price movement you can't
388.76s: do that with Futures outright which is
391.44s: one of the
392.36s: benefits so what is ibit well I like
397.36s: ibit for a few different reasons one
400.48s: because it's liquid meaning it's being
402.72s: accepted by the market two if we take a
405.92s: look at the overall Holdings for it it's
410.24s: pretty straightforward and I'll show you
413.24s: that here if we go into the Holdings you
416.32s: can see that it's essentially holding
418.84s: Bitcoin a little bit of cash and then
421.96s: some Bitcoin US Dollars currencies the
425.84s: reason why this is so useful is because
429.00s: you're getting direct exposure to
431.04s: Bitcoin now again this isn't the same as
432.80s: actually holding the coin out right
434.44s: obviously but for a tradable vehicle
437.20s: this is not gaining exposure to
439.40s: individual miners Bitcoin production
443.20s: facilities and whatnot because now your
445.76s: position takes on a different shape
447.48s: rather than simply behaving like Bitcoin
449.60s: Co the the Bitcoin itself outright
453.84s: you're gaining exposure to the
456.40s: operations of Bitcoin mining which
459.52s: includes operational expenses for
461.92s: producing the Bitcoin they have to have
463.92s: places in order to put all of their
466.60s: Machinery in order to mine Bitcoin and
468.84s: stuff like that it adds other flavors to
472.00s: it which I'm indifferent to but for this
474.84s: position itself I just want access to
476.88s: bitcoin and this provides it
480.20s: so let me give you a quick update on
483.08s: what the position sits at right now so
485.56s: that going forward you'll kind of have
487.28s: an idea of what I'm talking about so the
490.12s: position as it sits is 1,000 shares of
493.04s: ibit at a basis of
495.24s: 5455 and then I have two tranches of
499.28s: puts out one expiring this week actually
502.36s: on 17 Jan and then the other in 21 Feb I
505.96s: have a two lot at the 52 strike and then
508.96s: I have a three lot at the 49 strike
511.20s: respectively so both of those trades are
513.64s: on and sitting and then you can see that
515.00s: I have a
516.16s: ratio series of short calls against it
518.80s: I'm short six calls against the th
520.84s: shares and the basis for or the strike
524.76s: price for the calls which are out in 21
527.16s: Feb is the 60 so this here is
531.64s: essentially the tracker that I will be
533.48s: using to show you how I'm scaling into
536.24s: the trade I originally had a much
538.28s: smaller allocation in mind and then
540.40s: after talking to some people we arrived
542.60s: at this being um a better allocation use
545.84s: 125k so I needed to add a bunch more
548.40s: which is why a lot of this went on you
550.72s: can see that there's some existing
552.36s: options trades that have already come on
554.16s: and come off not really worth
556.08s: highlighting that but as the position
558.72s: sits right now we can see that I have a
561.00s: total of $1,000 in credit in sitting
563.92s: from the put side I have $1,100 in
566.52s: credit from the call side of things
568.76s: these are both open trades now the cool
571.96s: part about this is if you take a look at
574.48s: the underlying asset from when I started
576.92s: this it was 5725 it's currently at
579.88s: 54.83 so the percent change on that is
582.28s: about
583.48s: 4.2% to the
585.44s: downside yet my position is realized
589.72s: with profit to the upside we have a
592.36s: realized p&l of 365 but then we also
595.68s: have a total p&l of up 20 800 bucks
600.16s: again that's nothing to write home about
602.44s: but this happens through scaling into
604.44s: the trade and then also having a little
606.84s: bit of realized p&l coming from the
608.72s: option side and then right now there's
610.36s: way more potential p&l coming from the
612.52s: option side which will help to position
614.04s: a lot so this is the game plan to trade
617.12s: I bit with the coverage triangle and
618.64s: again you guys will be able to follow
619.92s: along and if you have any questions let
622.32s: me know be an outlier I'll see youall
623.68s: later
