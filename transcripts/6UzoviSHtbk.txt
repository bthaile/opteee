0.00s: Hey, what's up, outliers? A little bit of an unplanned stream. I was actually not going
6.84s: to stream today. There was a couple other things I was going to work on. And then I started
10.40s: getting some texts and then this hit on X. So I actually want to talk, I want to talk
18.60s: about this next stage of escalation. So this just came from Donald Trump, truth social.
29.96s: And this is saying we have completed our very successful attack on three nuclear sites
35.32s: and Iran, including Fordo, Nate, I don't know how to say that one. Natanz and Esh Fahan
45.24s: all planes outside the airspace, which is very standard fare before making a post like
50.88s: this. Congratulations to the American warriors, not another military in the world could have
56.48s: done this time for peace. Thank you for your attention of this matter. So we are off to
64.44s: the races. Now there is a lot to unpack here. And one of the things I want to everybody
73.88s: to pay attention to is the tradable side of this. That's the reality. There's a nasty
81.88s: part of this. And there's the part of conflict. That is a whole other bag. There is a series
91.96s: of things that literally are going to be profitable tomorrow based on this. And we have to see
99.08s: what the rest of it looks like. So first, let's take a look at where we sit in the broader
106.72s: conflict. And then what that likely means is to occur going forward. So we saw earlier,
116.96s: I think we can use this one. So we saw earlier where there is a couple of B2 bombers heading
125.28s: to Guam. For those that don't know, B2 bombers are some of the coolest fucking planes on
132.08s: Earth because they are, I mean, they're just an engineering feat. It's not quite the same
143.36s: as like a B1 Lancer, which those are also super cool. But B2s, they're stealth bombers.
150.32s: They essentially, they can operate in ways and minimize their detection significantly.
158.20s: They have a really expansive payload suite. So the fact that we knew that these were being
165.08s: moved is interesting. And it's because it starts with, well, this could just be prepositioning,
172.28s: moving things, display of power. That's a very common thing, especially when essentially,
177.56s: you're trying to drag people to the discussion table to make deals that they don't want to make.
183.48s: Now, we are in one of the weirdest times that I could think of right now with the, if there was
192.76s: no Ukraine, Russia happening right now, this would have a completely different tenor.
197.72s: But the fact that that's also going on right now, this, it puts this in a, in a weird,
203.56s: in a weird light. So when we saw this happening, we didn't know whether or not this was going to be
214.68s: prepositioning forces, again, a display or actually to be used. And we still technically don't know
222.44s: if these were used, although it's a good guess, because we just know that it was bombers that
228.92s: hit three different sites and are now RTV returning to base. So a couple of things that have
237.08s: drawn my attention with this so far, when the conflict first started, the market sold off
243.00s: actually really hard. And I thought that was really strange, because in my initial view,
250.76s: I genuinely thought that the conflict would be pretty brief because for those that don't know,
257.40s: if you go back through the history of Iran and Israel, this thing has been going on for decades,
266.12s: a long time where there will be a escalation, then de-escalation escalated. It's just how it's been
273.96s: for a really long time. So the fact that this started to pop off and the market moved is heavy as it
281.32s: did was interesting to me. Now, like last time the market's closed, which is suboptimal,
288.76s: because the best time to trade this would have been literally right now as the news came out,
294.20s: because right now there's actually not like information asymmetry, that's not true. But
301.72s: you stand a much better shot as a retail trader getting in on the early side now,
309.32s: because one of the things that we can be pretty confident what's going to happen tomorrow is the
314.44s: market's going to open lower. At 1,500 Pacific time futures are going to open and they're going to
319.64s: start dropping. Now, it's very difficult to trade that initial kind of move, and it's because
326.44s: it will be very gappy. As everybody's resting their orders, there's going to be a bunch of resting
331.56s: market orders literally to just play that initial surge that will lead to near-term covering that
337.88s: will recover price, and then it will get pushed down again. How far it goes really depends on the
344.12s: rest of the news that comes out over the next 24 hours effectively, little less. The news that
352.20s: we need to pay attention to, the first one, well, there's kind of like two big buckets, I guess I
359.56s: would assign here. There's escalation of which there's a lot of potential, and then there's
371.16s: D escalation. Now, based on Trump's truth, which is just don't like that is the name of like a post.
384.68s: Trump's post. You can see the part that he ended with was pretty clear. Now is the time for peace.
394.36s: So this to me still leads a little closer towards a display of power, and this is essentially saying,
405.24s: okay, you didn't want to capitulate and talk earlier, then now we will escalate the scenario.
413.00s: Now do you want to talk because we're not we're not playing games. This is always a strange
419.64s: and difficult path to peace in my opinion, but one of the important things for all of us that do
426.68s: this kind of thing where we're analyzing geopolitical events like this, we know such a small subset
436.60s: of what's actually going on. And I always remind myself of my own ignorance, and I pay
442.44s: closer to attention to this stuff than probably like the average person with my you know,
447.48s: involvement in the military. But there's definitely a strategy here in like comments like this is
456.92s: interesting to me because I understand the sentiment, but there actually is power in this.
464.44s: Now the way that this and this the reason why this is actually a really important line
471.56s: is it shows that Trump isn't necessarily looking to take this into a large scale conflict.
479.80s: And again, as a betting man, I still have to assume that we're not going to go into some sort of
485.88s: large scale direct boots on the ground conflict with Iran. I just don't see it as beneficial.
491.56s: Now the US does have the potential to do this kind of thing, which is we have power projection
499.08s: across the entire globe. And we can do something that's relatively low touch to us.
504.84s: Those pilots that drop those bombs, they've done that a million times with inert bombs.
509.88s: And they just go fly their plane in a circle at an altitude that they can't even really be seen.
514.68s: And they just cruise on with their day. So what I'm saying is even though the concept of
519.64s: bombing is kind of heavy, in terms of actual like implementation, it's not that heavy.
526.84s: It's actually kind of a light lift. Now there's the political side of it, which obviously is not
532.04s: as light of a lift. So this to me is still really, really, really early stages. And I think the
541.64s: main thing I'm waiting to see is, is there significant outcry from Iran allies? Because that's
554.60s: how this escalates massively. If there is some sort of huge escalation based on Iranian allies,
563.72s: then this whole, this is for peace. Now it's the time for peace. That goes right out the
569.00s: fucking window. That's gone. Now if Iran sees this and they say, okay, this not really what we
576.84s: expect it to happen, we don't feel like escalating this significantly. Let's see if we can talk
582.60s: about it. That sends this down a completely different path. And the impact on the market tomorrow
589.00s: will be completely different. There's a couple assets that you have to keep in the back of your
593.24s: mind. It's well few. The first grouping is all of the indices. You're going to see movement.
599.24s: The next is volatility. You're going to see movement. Next is crude oil. You're going to see movement.
605.88s: So all of these will move to some degree tomorrow. But again, depending on how this ends up flowing
613.08s: over the next few hours, that will less than 24 hours, then we'll have a better, a better sense.
620.28s: So in this idea of de-escalation, this is the first seemingly strange, but this is the first
630.36s: component to it, saying now is the time for peace. Now if there is a actual movement towards
640.28s: de-escalation, then you'll see that via a response from Iran relatively soon.
644.76s: What's likely to happen is Iran will prefer to posture themselves via power.
653.24s: So the thing is compared to Israel, Iran can do that a little more successfully. I
659.56s: Iran really can't do that very well with the US. So they can't kind of do the old big dick to you
666.52s: in this context. Against Israel, it's kind of like siblings are fighting.
670.92s: This is a different scale now. So Iranian response at this point is what I am super, super,
679.64s: super interested in. Let's see if anything new has come out.
688.84s: I don't see anything yet.
692.04s: Sneheal says, can't we just stop fighting? I tell you what, the idea of not fighting is really
700.28s: idealistic, but honestly to me, it shows it's idealistic. I personally do not ever see a world
711.96s: where conflict is gone. And I call it the veneer of civilization. We as people, we as humans,
718.28s: we think that we're so evolved and that word, you know, so thoughtful. Yet at the base of
726.52s: everything, we literally are animals. And if you look at the animal kingdom, there is no lack of
733.08s: conflict. Actually, it's even more intense than what we see. And humans, even though we like to
741.80s: eat with silverware, we still have those same tendencies. So any living being still,
748.12s: there's going to be conflict. It's never going to go away. Now,
753.08s: ideally, we wouldn't have to have wars, wars suck, wars suck. And there's very rarely a
768.36s: really, really, I mean, there's never really a great output. Even I was literally reading a
774.20s: really great book just about the, hold on a second. So this is so another truth says,
783.72s: Fordo is gone. Yeah. So I mean, that doesn't surprise me.
793.80s: So now it looks like Trump is going to address the nation at 10 p.m. Eastern. So
799.72s: I will be watching that like a hawk. We might stream that one too. We'll kind of see, we'll see
805.48s: how it goes. Let me get caught up with you guys. We'll stretch us this time to fill up and gas tank.
814.60s: That's actually a really important, that's actually a really important point because there's a
820.04s: couple things to keep in mind. Again, taking it back to markets. The first thing is we get zero oil
825.96s: for my ran. So it's not like any sort of big direct impact for my Iranian oil. However,
834.60s: there is a massive impact, potential, funny enough, that a lot of people are relatively unfamiliar.
843.16s: So the first thing we're watching for is, is there some sort of actual militaristic
848.60s: reaction from my ran? And I have to be honest, I would be shocked if there were. Because
855.24s: this is the inequity of the world where the US chose to strike. And if Iran chooses to strike
865.48s: something of the US is back, then that's when things go parabolic fast. The US does not respond
874.36s: well to that. And again, I say this as a military member and somebody that's in the US. So
881.96s: the point there is it's still not fair. The way that that flows is not fair, but it is what it is.
892.76s: It's the law of the jungle. So the reason why I'm saying that is because a lot of people will say
897.24s: like, oh, well, you know, if Iran strikes back, then the US should be ready to talk peace. And
902.44s: again, like that's nice in a idealistic sense. It doesn't reflect reality in the in the slightest.
908.36s: That's not how it would go. So I think Iran would be very hard pressed to directly strike any
916.76s: like any US assets. But let's see if anything. I ran needs to agree to end this conflict. Doesn't
927.40s: surprise me. So it still just looks like I haven't seen on a couple other computers. I'm watching
935.88s: different news sources to see any response for my ran. We just don't have that yet. Now going back
943.80s: though to markets and potential impact, there's an underlying thing again that a lot of people are
953.80s: unfamiliar with. And I'll show you on Google Maps.
966.52s: It's this bad Larry right here, the straight of Hormuz. You zoom out the straight of Hormuz.
977.56s: Who do you notice? He is right next to it. I ran. So one of the issues and one of the things I ran
986.36s: can do to turn up the heat more holistically, even though the US does not deal with Iranian oil
996.60s: directly, we do deal with Saudi oil, UAE oil. We do deal with oil from like all of these places
1007.88s: pretty heavily. And oil from a lot of these places goes through this straight right here,
1016.44s: bordered by Iran. So the way that you would see some sort of escalation on the oil front
1026.60s: will overwhelmingly likely come from any restriction here. And the other thing again is that if
1034.52s: there is any sort of restriction there, the US is going to take that very seriously and you're
1039.88s: going to see things scale very, very quickly. So the issue at Act Shot says Iran can blow up the
1050.12s: global economy if it blocks the straight of Hormuz. This is dangerous move from the US bombing
1053.72s: Iran. Yeah, that's exactly right. That's and that's exactly right. Now again, the reality of them
1058.92s: actually being able to do that unlikely. And more importantly than that, it's an efficiency thing.
1067.08s: Even if the straight of Hormuz becomes completely blocked, you can still ship oil. It just becomes
1072.92s: more expensive to do so. So that's another really important thing to keep in the back of your mind.
1077.80s: If the straight of Hormuz becomes super conflict bound, things aren't being able to move through
1084.04s: there freely. First, you'll start to see US military vessels show up there quick fast and in a
1088.84s: hurry. That adds a completely different flavor to the things getting attacked. The thing next thing
1094.44s: beyond that oil does not have to go through here. It's just more efficient to put it on tankers.
1099.88s: But you can still airlift. You can still move it by rail. It's just way less efficient.
1105.32s: Still move it by trucks. And then you can drop it in the ocean somewhere else. There's other
1111.72s: accessible ports. The main thing to keep in mind is it's not like this is truly a single point
1117.56s: of failure. It's just an efficient point of failure. So that part of side, if there this is the
1126.84s: main thing I'm paying really close attention to is how Iran chooses to respond. And then if there's
1135.32s: any dialogue around the straight of Hormuz because if there is without a doubt, there will be a
1142.68s: pretty significant impact. So now talking a little bit more about the way that this is likely to
1151.56s: impact market tomorrow. So when futures open, let me get caught up. Tommy says is the US net exporter.
1162.20s: They go back and forth. I don't know what they are right now today is the US currently a net
1168.60s: exporter of oil. The US always has the potential. It's really just a cost thing. So I don't know if
1176.20s: they are today. I'll tell you right now. But the US, it has the capacity it can choose to. It's
1183.08s: just whether or not it wants to. So yeah, it's still it's still the same same. So no change.
1193.16s: Net exporter.
1197.96s: Oxshot says is this plan for the US to isolate China as China gets its oil from Iran and now other
1204.60s: counter parties will be buying oil from the US. I don't I don't think so because I don't see
1215.24s: a world yet where the US is inclined to get any sort of direct or indirect escalation with China.
1226.60s: It just doesn't benefit anybody. Our two economies are so intertwined that there's a lot of
1234.04s: positioning going on by China because they tend to think much longer term than the US does. I think
1240.04s: at least and I don't think that this is attempting to diminish China's oil supply because you can
1250.04s: also tell by the things that we're choosing to attack right. We're not attacking oil production
1255.72s: or just base infrastructure. The things that are being attacked are so far reported as
1261.96s: things that aid in the proliferation of nuclear weapons which the US again not saying it's fair.
1268.76s: But the US and other key countries have decided that we get to have the toy but nobody else.
1275.16s: So you don't get to have it which is yeah, it kind of sucks but again it is what it is.
1285.08s: So what that means in this context is I haven't seen anything in the strikes yet that lead me to
1291.64s: believe that that's the way they're trying to play it. I do think that they're trying to get a
1295.16s: resolution to what you see with Iran in Israel. That's so cool. I don't care about this.
1306.84s: I don't care about this. I don't see any new. I don't see any new info.
1325.24s: So we'll see more a little bit later. The biggest thing is if there is some sort of retaliation but
1346.28s: this is the main near term effect is how does this be impacted? Now the impact here is why you're
1355.48s: going to see overwhelmingly likely oil is going to absolutely skyrocket. And there's a couple ways
1365.80s: that you can check this even when the market is closed. So let's take a look. One of the things you
1372.68s: can use is any sort of backing. So backing of positions changes super quickly. And it's because
1383.56s: that's not tied to the market being open right now. So let's take a look at crude oil futures.
1390.92s: Margin requirement.
1402.28s: So it. Oh, that's funny. Elizabeth. Elizabeth says Shrey made note that ice increased
1408.44s: margin requirements on oil futures by 24%. There we go. Yeah. So you can you can find small artifacts
1416.68s: stuff like that through here. So the reason why you'll see oil likely trade higher tomorrow.
1424.84s: It doesn't come from the direct impact. It comes from the uncertainty around this because again,
1431.24s: remember what oil futures are. It guarantees a transaction price. It's used to hedge.
1438.44s: So in this kind of context, if you don't know, if there can if there might be some sort of
1445.40s: massive large scale escalation of this conflict, if you don't know that, you can literally purchase
1453.96s: oil futures to lock in the price of your oil for whatever the defined period is,
1461.00s: so that this way you remove that price sensitivity. Now there will be absolutely no shortage.
1467.80s: Of people like me that on futures open tomorrow, I will be speculating for sure.
1474.60s: Without a doubt.
1478.84s: And it's because there's going to be movement. The only way that we don't see movement
1488.04s: is if there's essentially a piece deal struck very quickly, which I still just don't see that.
1495.64s: I don't see that in the cards right now. Let's see if anything else popped up from here.
1506.28s: No. No. So this says American B2 bombers using the weekend operation.
1518.20s: I don't know if this is I still don't know if this is accurate. If it was actually B2s,
1523.40s: I mean, it's a fair assumption. I don't think there's anything wrong with taking that as the
1527.32s: assumption. I just don't see anything that actually confirms that yet.
1534.28s: And so this is 45 minutes ago. It says prefers diplomatic option towards Iran, but only if
1543.64s: Iran makes significant concessions, which I think we know that they're not inclined to do.
1555.32s: 90 minutes ago, US citizens evacuated from Israel on flights to Greece.
1561.96s: Yeah. So I mean, this is. This is one of those things where there is a really, really solid
1569.00s: chance that it's like the way to think about the outcome of this thing is pretty high severity,
1578.68s: but in very different directions. So if I were to think of like a plot and this is,
1586.68s: I guess we'll just do a plot like this. And this is just a scale of severity.
1593.96s: And then we have a decision point here on the different directions that this can go.
1602.52s: If we end up deescalating, then that has a severe impact, but in a completely different direction.
1613.96s: And if this starts to escalate, that has a slightly higher severity, still pretty damn severe
1621.64s: compared to the other, but in a slightly different direction. So if there's deescalation,
1627.96s: that leads to volatility contracting massively tomorrow, you'll see equities probably rise, oil will
1633.64s: come down. Gold probably will come down as well as capital will flow into risk assets tomorrow.
1643.00s: If that doesn't happen more likely than not, as I've already said, you'll probably see indices
1648.76s: go down, you'll see things like gold probably go up, crude up, vix up, the dollar, I mean,
1657.96s: the dollar would be a little bit decoupled from this bonds will go up. So you'll see a pretty
1665.40s: profound impact across the entire market, I think.
1669.64s: Sneheal says, I don't believe a piece deal, I don't believe a piece deal, despite from saying
1676.84s: it's time for peace. I mean, I think I do think that's what he would want, but the thing is,
1683.16s: he obviously would want it on his terms. So the way to think about peace in this context is it's
1690.28s: kind of like Spanish for submission, which makes it a different thing if you actually can,
1697.72s: for the people I can read in between the lines and see what this actually is.
1701.80s: When you see peace in this context, it doesn't mean peace, it means submission. We want you to do
1707.72s: what we want. And you either do what we want or we will bomb you. Again, one of the big differences
1716.12s: is the way that the US is very, very fortunate in the way that we are geographically located
1725.72s: is that Iran is surrounded by things we have easy access to from a US military
1736.76s: perspective. We have bases literally all through, literally all through the entire continent.
1745.00s: We have Navy and we have all sorts of water-based access through the Arabian Sea.
1756.28s: So we have essentially unfettered access to Iran. It's a littoral state. If they're
1765.16s: lamblocked, that's a different story because it makes accessing for like a large-scale military
1771.80s: invasion if that were to occur, which again, I really don't think that is on the table right now,
1776.28s: at least. But it makes a complete difference if you can access through lands and sea or has to
1784.12s: be via just land because then you have to come up with deals with all the countries you're going
1787.72s: to have to drive all your shit through. And a lot of places don't like that, rightfully so because
1792.44s: you kind of indirectly get dragged into shit. So Iran is highly accessible. The US is really not
1800.60s: that accessible to Iran. That doesn't mean inaccessible, just a completely different kind of
1807.00s: accessibility. And like through some sort of large-scale escalation, again, it wouldn't be pretty.
1817.40s: It's not what we would want, but Iran doesn't stand a great chance there. So they're not in
1824.44s: an awesome position, unfortunately, which I say unfortunate because people when their backs are
1831.64s: against the wall, it's always a more, it becomes more vicious.
1839.32s: Oxhot says Iran can attack US bases in the region. They don't need to bomb the US, definitely.
1843.96s: Yeah, yeah. And they can, they will absolutely. If they choose to escalate, they'll do their best.
1849.96s: The point that I'm making is that that's a completely different context in a completely
1854.76s: different scale in terms of total access. It's just not equitable, right? That's my broader point.
1861.48s: To your point, which I agree with, Iran absolutely is within reach of things that we would not want
1868.60s: struck. Absolutely. The US has unfettered access to the entire continent and specifically the entire
1877.40s: country of Iran. So it's one of those things where things escalate enough
1884.44s: than that matters. That data point matters a lot. But yeah, bombing of military bases nearby,
1895.48s: that's why they're there. Most of them, well, and that's part of the way that the US operates,
1905.72s: right, with just total power projection and the ability to essentially touch a lot of things
1914.04s: essentially across the entire globe. Uh, Sneel says if they retaliate, it's not going to be good
1919.88s: despite that being the most realistic outcome from an emotion standpoint. Yeah, that's exactly
1924.44s: correct. And I think they know that I don't think that like there might be some sort of pride-based
1931.32s: retaliation of some sort. Because again, we have to remember in this context, it's the idea of like
1937.56s: peace equals submission. And Iran is a proud country, just like most countries are. They don't
1944.68s: want to submit to another entity. Nobody does. But that's the unfortunate point of conflict
1954.84s: is that it escalates to a point where then submission happens. You have no choice.
1960.92s: So it really just depends on how far along that continuum we go. And the range we go on that
1969.08s: continuum just negatively impacts literally everything. But it's like the same thing in martial
1978.92s: arts. If you're, if you have two guys who are really confident, really strong, and they both are
1985.16s: supremely like decided that they are going to win, they will both go into the fight with full
1991.08s: force under the context that they're going to win. But by, you know, third, fourth rounds,
1996.36s: you'll start to notice that one of them might start very clearly pulling ahead if they have
2001.48s: better cardio or something like that. It's kind of like the equivalent. And then this conflict,
2007.16s: that looked really equitable at the beginning, all of a sudden does not look equitable.
2012.52s: There's, uh, near says you don't think the conflict ends this week. Probably market seems to think
2019.64s: it's done before next weekend. I think it could be. Yeah, I definitely think it could be. I think
2024.92s: what this just did is add to the severity. I'm not so sure about the timeline because
2033.56s: I ran will likely like right now they're in the process of making some really, really big
2040.76s: decisions. But let's take a look at, uh, polymarket.
2056.12s: And 4-0 nuclear facility destroyed before July. Oh, damn.
2062.20s: A bunch of people just got paid.
2068.36s: Will I ran close the straight of Hormuz before July so we can see that is no. I wonder.
2076.92s: And this is, there's still pricing this at 40, 48% chance. The thing to remember is like this is
2083.16s: you can't really use this too well because it's such a small amount of money
2089.88s: that it there's just not much in here.
2095.80s: And I wonder what close means.
2103.24s: All sorts of severely restricts. International maritime traffic through the straight of Hormuz.
2113.64s: Oh, man, that's tricky. The primary resolution source for this market will be
2118.84s: official government information. However, consensus of regrettable reporting will also be used.
2124.76s: I am so curious.
2131.80s: I am so curious.
2139.40s: That's, I'm thinking of it just from a execution standpoint. Like this is still to
2146.52s: esoteric to me. I wouldn't like that bet.
2152.28s: Steele says this is also just degenerate gambling. So very opinion-based. I wouldn't,
2157.32s: I wouldn't actually chalk it up to that because I've worked with a couple of friends that are actually
2163.32s: working on cross exchange arbitrage in these kinds of things. And there's also absolutely a
2170.92s: use case to this in terms of even a sophisticated portfolio that might use this to reduce some
2178.28s: short-term risk. You can do that in a few different ways with something like this.
2182.92s: So yeah, I agree with you that probably a lot of it is people just kind of guessing shit,
2189.32s: which I do agree with. But you will have some level of informed participants here. It's just not
2196.92s: enough. That's the problem. It's just not enough. You need more.
2210.44s: Let's see. See, this is interesting. This says, US, I read nuclear deal in 25,
2224.04s: 41% chance. So the issue with that is, I don't see another stop to the conflict here. Maybe
2243.40s: they're thinking like just to cease fire. But I think sans the nuclear deal, like that's the
2255.08s: main thing that Trump is after. So sans that deal, I don't see this slowing down. Nothing here.
2265.00s: Let's see if anything news come out. All right. So now we're getting some stuff from the
2272.76s: Iranian state media. Let's see if we can pick anything up from there.
2279.72s: I'm going, I'm trying to see if I can get to the actual webpage.
2310.04s: I don't see anything on their x-page.
2320.20s: I don't see anything on i24.
2340.52s: Yeah, I'm not seeing anything directly from them yet.
2350.76s: Um, Arjun says seems like it might have been ground attack, not really air attack at all.
2357.32s: I highly doubt that. I highly doubt that. It could have been, but if the US is involved,
2366.92s: I would feel very confident, saying with near certainty.
2371.56s: That it would have been by air.
2385.40s: Yeah, I just don't see. I don't see it being orchestrated via land personally.
2393.16s: The logistics of it would be very difficult, I think, to like palette. I just don't think it
2402.44s: would make a lot of sense. And again, especially like we were talking about in the beginning,
2407.40s: in terms of ease of being able to contact and like touch things, that like that's one of the
2417.32s: things that the US continues to have in its pocket is just overall air superiority.
2425.80s: And it's very likely that they will continue using that, especially in a, especially in a conflict like this.
2436.68s: I don't see any. I don't see any like other big news on this yet. I'm surprised that we
2456.20s: haven't heard anything from them yet. I thought by about now,
2469.32s: we would come across something, but apparently not yet.
2486.68s: So,
2488.60s: a snail says, Trump said they dropped a payload of bombs. And to me, that seems like the most probable.
2496.04s: Yeah.
2500.60s: Most dobs says they're awfully quiet for getting hit by three bombs.
2504.12s: It was probably more than three. It's just three locations, but yeah, I'm just surprised that
2510.76s: there's like, it's just nothing yet, which is interesting.
2526.36s: Yeah. That part is strange to me.
2541.00s: Nears says regarding the polymarket, you can determine based on Israel attack on Iran,
2549.64s: and then you can see other percentages dropped by the dates.
2553.64s: Oh, yeah. I think now with the US involvement, that's a completely different scale now.
2561.72s: Because in terms of like the conflict ending by the end of the week, I think now with the US
2569.96s: involved, you essentially need to have some sort of defined deal. And the main thing that the US
2577.00s: is looking for, like we were talking about before, is an explicit deal about nuclear weapons,
2584.28s: which Iran is going to be highly, highly, highly resistant to capitulating to. Because for them,
2591.48s: that's actually kind of a big deal to be able to be able to proliferate, because then it puts
2599.72s: them in a completely different context, right? Because like this shit couldn't happen. If they had
2604.68s: nuclear weapons, this strike doesn't happen. And it's because you risk a potential of nuke
2610.68s: getting launched, and that's what scales everything so differently. Yeah.
2621.72s: Has there been any evacuation orders for military bases in the middle of Middle East? No, I don't.
2627.88s: You're not going to see evacuation orders come out from a military base. One, it's because it
2634.60s: gives you way too much strategic information. That doesn't mean that they might not be repositioning
2638.84s: people, but you probably wouldn't know about it until a little bit like a pretty significant lag.
2648.52s: Yeah.
2648.92s: US government knows Iran has no nuke. They will say they will say they don't have them anymore.
2658.60s: Well, we don't, yeah, we don't think they have nuke. That's the whole point of this entire
2662.76s: thing is that we don't want them to get them. So that's part of like the broader US angle on
2670.44s: the quote unquote deal is they want Iran essentially to stop attempting to proliferate.
2680.84s: So,
2683.40s: Sneo says time in Iran is 4 AM really thought we'd see some update at least from their site. Yeah,
2688.52s: I definitely think so. Like I felt the same like anything, anything coming from
2694.92s: them. Yeah, I'm surprised that it's followed so far by absolutely nothing.
2705.96s: This is all the same shit.
2708.84s: I are in a no official source inside Iran is yet confirmed or denied the attacks on the
2714.28s: 4.0 facility. Yeah, so where is that? F-O-R-D-O-W.
2729.00s: Let's see.
2734.92s: Let's see if we can check this out.
2744.60s: That's awesome. The fact that it is literally on Google, this is hilarious.
2757.64s: Oxhot says 4.0 is under the mountains. Yeah, well, it's like anything, right? You still
2762.36s: need access, which it looks like this might be part of the access, like you can see these
2769.64s: tunnels. These are literally tunnels.
2778.92s: Another series of tunnels. And then what is this thing?
2787.40s: I don't know what that is. It looks like just some sort of building.
2793.56s: I wonder what kind of bomb they used.
2799.96s: Man, they were flying through there for a while.
2817.24s: Joe says, Trump called them nuclear sites. Yeah, it's nuclear. It's enrichment.
2822.36s: So when they say nuclear sites, he's just talking about locations that are specifically used
2829.16s: to try to develop nuclear weapons. In case you guys are wondering what that red light is,
2833.80s: I have a little massage gun going because your boys' legs are trash right now.
2843.24s: So yeah, he'll, that's why you hear him referring to them is that. Because
2849.56s: that's the more difficult part of this process for them is finding a way.
2855.08s: What's the curious? Yeah, okay. It's about what you would expect.
2870.52s: Looks like, oh, this looks pretty close.
2874.60s: Let's see if we can go to this one.
2883.40s: Yeah, so just straight mountains.
2893.16s: So you're going to have fucking the Google car driving right up, right up to this.
2908.92s: Being says without being insensitive, how does this affect markets specifically tech stocks?
2913.32s: We talked about that a little bit earlier. Tech stocks is interesting because I think still
2918.68s: across the board tech is seen as more or less like big tech scene is more like the safe haven.
2925.72s: So I don't think that you'll see some sort of massive impact yet on tech stocks. You'll probably
2933.40s: see some level of inflows out of more speculative names. But yeah, I don't think you'll see
2941.24s: like a like a huge change in tech yet. Most of the move that I think we're going to see tomorrow
2949.32s: is based on initial prep like positioning and people reacting to what might happen.
2957.40s: That's why the next stage, that's why the next stage of the conflict is really, really important
2966.84s: in terms of does this escalate or does it stall because that will have an impact on the initial
2975.00s: reaction of the volatility. That's why like tomorrow I'll pay attention to what's going on the
2981.64s: rest of the day. And then tomorrow I'll like log on probably 90 minutes earlier. So get caught up
2988.84s: on everything to have a pretty good idea. A good way to trade tomorrow is actually using like
2993.88s: different kinds of pairs. That's probably what I'll do. But I'll have to wait and see.
2999.64s: Too early to know.
3004.28s: Sneheals says Iranian official fuel ships will not pass to Europe through the straight
3011.48s: of Hormuz. Yeah, we'll see like if if if that's the case, if that came out, then
3028.76s: I'm trying to see where that came from.
3030.44s: Let's go through.
3044.36s: What's this one?
3054.04s: No.
3060.76s: I'm trying to see Sneheal where you saw that.
3068.36s: Because if if that's the first thing they said, that would be wild.
3079.00s: So I see these.
3100.36s: So I see old news about them threatening to close.
3108.68s: I see a post from somebody that I don't notice saying Iran will attempt to close the
3120.12s: straight of Hormuz, but like that stuff, like none of that's Iran saying what they're doing.
3126.84s: It's again, like if Iran does it.
3128.76s: But Joe says according to Bloomberg, tweet, citing Iran, the three sites had been evacuated.
3139.96s: Yeah, that's I think that's smart. The US probably would have preempted it a little bit to
3147.00s: them. It wouldn't surprise me. So here it says Iran warned that it could shut off the
3154.52s: straight of Hormuz, one of the world's most critical oil choke points in retaliation for
3159.64s: US involvement in its conflict with Israel, which we're just talking about. That's the thing if
3165.56s: again, like if that happens, then this thing escalates like massively.
3171.72s: There's no doubt.
3172.52s: And then it looks like a senior Iranian lawmaker, if the US officially and operationally enters
3188.44s: the war in support of the Zionists, the legitimate right of Iran in view of pressuring the US
3195.24s: and Western countries to disrupt their oil trades, ease of transit. Yeah. We will see.
3206.52s: Oxhot says I doubt there is enough thought given to the repercussions of today's action.
3210.92s: The government is all one man show and that one man is just delusional.
3214.60s: I mean, I just wholeheartedly disagree with you. It's not even like about Trump or another entity.
3221.88s: It's like you can take Trump out of the decision seat. The US, like any president, regardless of who
3231.24s: they are, has a series of advisors, a lot of them. And it's not like any president. Again, just
3239.64s: remove Trump from the comments. Any president isn't just sitting there by themselves seeing what they
3246.28s: can learn about what's going on on X and then making a decision to bomb another country.
3253.80s: Like, that's not how it goes. So yeah, I mean, everybody can have their opinion about like the
3259.96s: different actors totally get that. But I think all of these things, regardless of who is in power,
3269.24s: it's probably very well thought out. I don't think it's like this half-hearted thing that they
3274.12s: just decided to do today. It's the same thing with most of the decision cycles.
3280.68s: There's a lot of people involved. A lot of information is provided. So I think it's okay to not
3287.72s: agree with it. I have an opinion on it. Like all that stuff's important. But yeah, I just,
3294.28s: I wouldn't chalk it up to that. I think it's a common mistake people make when they're analyzing
3299.64s: things in general, even in trading. Somebody will just assume that like the other side of the
3306.04s: trade is dumb. And it's like, that's not so much the case, man. It's like, you don't really know
3313.32s: what the other side of the trade is doing or why. So I think it's just, it's a mistake to underestimate
3321.56s: like the thought process of other entities. I would say at least.
3326.12s: Being says, I ran retaliation would be on trade routes. Yeah, primarily. Like if they wanted to
3331.88s: escalate this, they would go after the straight-ahormous. That's kind of like the main,
3337.08s: that's really the main thing they have access to. Beyond that again, like they could try some
3341.72s: limited strikes on US bases. They could try to intensify with Israel. But I mean, neither one of
3349.24s: those would really deter the US in a significant way. So the big thing, and again, notice how they
3357.64s: phrase it here, disrupt their oil trades ease of transit, right? It's not like fully disrupt the oil
3365.72s: trade. It doesn't stop the oil trade. It just, it does just make it more annoying to move it.
3370.92s: Ambience says, would it be bad for a trader? Oh, I missed it.
3378.12s: Steele says, wow, I just seen Twitter people notice the beetos take off 11 hours ago. Yeah,
3383.72s: well, they watch them depart. That's one of the, one of the interesting things about media now
3391.88s: is that they catch a lot of this stuff. The thing is, is they, you never really know what they're
3397.32s: doing though. And that's kind of still part of the overall, the overall game.
3409.96s: Okay, so it looks like a minute ago, it says, officially Iranian state media quoted the crisis
3415.72s: management official in quam province. I ran saying the Fordo nuclear facility was bombed by the US.
3422.84s: Okay, so it looks like they're starting to talk about it from Bloomberg. I see
3434.76s: confirms that part of Fordo nuclear site was attacked by enemy air strikes. Yeah, got it.
3445.08s: So this, yeah, this does seem at least like we're starting to hear from them. I'm curious what
3453.48s: direction. I think everybody is. It's very curious what direction that Iran is going to try to take
3464.12s: this. I still just do not see a world where this just turns into a negotiation without at least
3477.16s: a follow on level of back and forth. I'm personally just curious like how involved the back and
3487.80s: forth will be. Ambience, there would be a logical decision for a trader to trade based on this
3496.52s: event, for example, buying all the futures on market oil, expected oil, skyrocket. Yeah, so we
3501.32s: actually talked about that a few times during the stream so far. And I think you're looking at it
3506.28s: the right way. There's a bunch of different ways to trade it. Now, as we were talking about a
3511.64s: little bit early though, you can't, you can't oversimplify it, right? Because there's going to be
3520.12s: a lot of people looking to do the same thing. So what that means is on futures open, you're very
3526.68s: likely to see a pretty dramatic response. But then you're also very likely to see a decent
3536.28s: amount of overall whipsaw because there will be quite a few, quite a few people just trading
3546.20s: that initial move itself. That's it. And when you trade like that initial move and then you're
3554.92s: happy with it and then you want to get out, you're going to have a bit of a different
3559.40s: bit of a different play in mind, which is going to have an impact on the price on the opening.
3566.92s: So yeah, that's like a good job on you, Amiens, by like thinking about a catalyst and trying
3573.32s: to turn it into a trade idea. It obviously doesn't mean that it's going to work. We have to,
3578.68s: there's still a lot of time between today and tomorrow. And in terms of like when futures open,
3586.52s: how this whole thing ends up actually going, like we still don't really know that.
3593.08s: We just know the pieces of information we have thus far. So it's a little bit, a little bit early
3601.64s: to tell. Slipy says thoughts on whether Russia or China would step in since their trade partners
3606.44s: with Iran. I don't think so. I think China will likely condemn it as well as Russia. Russia is,
3613.88s: Russia is not really in a position to step in, be honest.
3619.80s: Russia is busy. So if Russia wanted to step in, it would be in a very limited way. Maybe sanctions
3627.48s: or something like that, but that that whole thing's already going on. So yeah, I don't see Russia,
3636.44s: like Russia has their plate pretty full. I don't see them doing the standard mistake of opening
3643.08s: up conflict on too many fronts simultaneously. China, I still don't think is interested in a
3648.92s: direct conflict in the US is equally disinterested. So they might support in directly,
3656.20s: provide support to Iran, but I don't think much beyond that personally. Again, it's all,
3662.52s: it's always subject to change, right? Like this stuff is literally happening right now. So it's
3668.92s: super hard to tell. I ran an official cited by Fars news agency. I witnessed the tax near
3678.44s: is Fahan in Nottens nuclear facilities. Okay. Another thing here, it says the US military is now
3688.60s: briefing troops at the strike and Iran expected to trigger counter attacks on American bases,
3693.08s: exactly as we talked about and facilities across the Middle East could also activate Iran
3699.16s: backed in other foreign terrorist organization sells abroad, definitely.
3708.84s: All right. US reached out to Iran diplomatically Saturday to say that the strikes are all the US
3717.64s: plans and that the regime change efforts are not planned. So this is kind of a big,
3725.40s: a couple big pieces of information.
3741.40s: Let's see.
3748.12s: Two massive bombs reportedly struck the entrances of the photo facility alone. Over 30 tons of
3761.08s: explosives used in that strike. I wonder how they're confirming this.
3765.56s: I definitely want to know this.
3775.32s: We're used.
3783.32s: We still don't know what kind of bombs they used either.
3787.96s: We do know the US has like pretty specific munitions to be able to attack underground.
3795.72s: We're reinforced places. So my assumption is that there would be some variant of that,
3805.72s: like a bunker buster, but I don't know. I haven't seen anything.
3818.76s: So it looks like Israel is going under quasi-martial law.
3824.76s: House Intelligence Committee member says the decision to strike without approval is unconstitutional.
3839.48s: So now there's also going to be the internal politics side of this.
3843.00s: This is interesting.
3851.88s: So I'm curious thoughts on how Iran will respond.
3860.36s: I'm super curious.
3867.32s: All right.
3868.04s: I'm going to hop off for a bit. I'll probably jump back on a little bit later.
3874.04s: We'll see how everything goes. Otherwise in the discord, I'll definitely keep my eye on
3880.44s: and let you guys know if I see anything popping up. But I'm going to go chill, go for a walk.
3887.08s: You guys need anything? Let me know. Be an outlier. See you guys later.
