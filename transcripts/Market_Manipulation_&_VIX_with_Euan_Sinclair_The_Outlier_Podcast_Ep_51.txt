2.56s: what's up everybody Eric here I am back
4.48s: with you and Sinclair welcome to the
5.72s: outlier podcast where we're going to be
7.52s: talking about trading this is Yan's like
9.96s: half a dozenth Time on the channel so he
12.56s: knows that I am the resident lay person
15.76s: he breaks things down for me pretty
17.32s: simplistically hopefully so that you
18.72s: guys can learn some stuff along the way
20.36s: first off youan welcome back yeah thanks
22.88s: for having me pleasure chatting with you
25.36s: once again we were literally just
27.08s: talking about what I think to be a
29.16s: pretty interesting concept which is why
30.56s: I wanted to hit the record button here
32.48s: but we were kind of talking about this
33.88s: idea of you know time behind the screen
36.80s: and how that translates into
38.36s: profitability and I kind of cut you off
39.84s: abruptly I apologize for that but it was
41.60s: really interesting stuff so I was hoping
43.20s: I could re-engage your thought process
44.68s: there and have you share it with the
45.88s: broad
47.08s: audience yeah so I'll try and sort of go
50.48s: back to what we were actually talking
52.96s: about there's this idea that people
57.16s: have that the more time they spend
60.44s: trading or the more effort they put into
64.04s: trading so not even time right it's like
66.64s: you know we all know smart is better
68.44s: than longer but they think that the more
71.72s: effort they put in the more money they
73.20s: will make and that's not unreasonable to
77.04s: think that because that's true in most
80.88s: things in life um like if you're a baker
85.36s: you get paid to bake cakes so the more
88.56s: cakes you make and the more time been
90.24s: making cakes the more money you'll make
92.72s: but trading isn't like that um the
96.88s: payoffs are very heavily
99.48s: skewed to the first initial observation
103.00s: you make so here's the the simplest one
106.20s: that I can think of stocks go up okay
110.52s: now that is the most well documented
114.08s: fact in trading stocks go up over the
117.72s: long period all the data we have in
121.00s: every country we have that's like the
123.08s: closest thing to an unassailable law of
126.04s: nature so once you know that you go and
129.40s: buy some stocks right Buy and Hold
132.36s: that's your that's your plan it turns
135.60s: out beating Buy and Hold in any sort of
139.92s: way that we can judge someone's skill is
144.08s: astonishingly difficult so timing the
146.92s: market seems to be very close to
150.36s: impossible not I'm not saying it's
152.96s: impossible right but the amount of
154.96s: effort you have to put in to do that you
158.36s: might turn your sharp ratio from Buy and
160.72s: Hold from a half to like
164.44s: 0.55 maybe and even if you're good at
168.84s: picking
170.72s: tops the the times you miss the market
173.44s: will still be going up so you're you're
175.60s: going against that inexurable tide that
178.20s: the Buy and Hold guy has on on his side
180.88s: it's really hard to beat that stock
183.56s: picking is not quite as difficult but
186.92s: it's still astonishingly difficult and
189.12s: you'll hear someone say oh look I called
192.08s: this I bought this it's like yeah okay
194.76s: but you know there've got to be some
196.68s: winners there've got to be some losers
198.60s: right but if you look over time look the
200.84s: professionals these guys are better than
203.12s: your
204.12s: average dude behind a screen at home
207.04s: right they just are they don't show any
210.44s: ability to consistently beat the
212.20s: benchmarks like none like Warren Buffett
215.52s: who legitimately did for three decades I
219.28s: think he absolutely crushed it right his
221.92s: sharp ratio was less than three
224.32s: qus so that's the amount of skill you
229.44s: need to beat the very very simple
233.28s: observation and that happens in a lot of
235.44s: things like with the variance premium
237.72s: right there's your observation options
240.04s: are usually
241.36s: overpriced well if you come up with a
243.60s: really simple way to monetize that just
246.08s: by say sell VXX sell vix Futures
251.76s: sell uh index options now these are all
255.16s: slightly different but they're all based
258.12s: on that same
259.56s: thing and once you've done
262.96s: that you versus me who I'm going to
268.16s: arrogantly say I know more about this
270.20s: than you unbelievable canot cannot
273.52s: believe that is going to have very very
276.04s: very high correlation like once you're
278.52s: in the same trade as Me overall all of
282.36s: the little details I put in it's like
284.48s: yeah well I mean it just really doesn't
287.80s: matter
289.80s: so it's one I think people screw that up
292.68s: more than anything else because the one
294.56s: thing I guarantee you if you trade more
297.24s: you wrap up more costs that's
300.48s: guaranteed but what isn't guaranteed is
303.00s: you trading more actually adding
306.28s: anything
307.92s: so that was basically what I was going
310.32s: to say to you before we went on air yeah
314.32s: and I think it it highlights an
316.32s: important point though especially for a
318.36s: lot of the newer Traders because there
320.12s: is this and I mean I can pretty still
322.44s: well remember this there's this function
324.56s: where you feel like you know you have to
327.16s: you have to grind more you have to put
328.56s: more time in you have to put more
329.80s: positions on in order to to make more
332.60s: money and then over time you kind of
333.92s: realize that's not so much the case now
337.00s: how do you
338.28s: balance maintaining enough activity to
341.64s: diversify risk without being
346.24s: overactive um I think most risk
349.08s: diversification well the most effective
350.96s: way of doing it is diversifying across
352.96s: positions rather than timing and
355.48s: actively trading one position because
357.56s: diversifying AC cross positions doesn't
359.28s: really cost you much more like it
362.00s: doesn't cost you more to buy 100 shares
365.36s: of one company and 100 shares of another
367.36s: company than it does to just buy 200
369.52s: shares right so that is the best risk
373.28s: mitigator
374.88s: um and a lot of the other tweaks and
377.52s: stuff you
379.12s: do you're reducing variance of p&l right
383.28s: so in the options world the more you
385.84s: restrike the more you
387.92s: rebalance yeah you absolutely are
391.04s: maintaining exposure to the risk factor
393.88s: you want but you're reducing variance
396.40s: that's perfect but you're also again
399.44s: racking up costs by doing it and not
403.08s: just the cost of doing the
405.36s: trade but if you're sitting there
407.52s: staring at your screen all
410.00s: day you're
412.12s: essentially your labor is going into
415.72s: that as well and that's a pretty
417.16s: significant cost right like if you if
419.56s: it's like me actively trading all day
424.32s: versus some guy who just does a
426.72s: basically a Buy and Hold version of what
428.84s: I'm doing you know the the analogous
431.32s: thing to
432.48s: it I've got to sort of somehow make up
435.16s: 40 hours worth of my time on top of the
437.96s: money he makes I mean that's very very
441.16s: difficult to do so I think it comes back
445.08s: as well that people see professional
446.92s: Traders and I don't mean you know people
450.40s: who trade
451.96s: professionally I mean real professional
454.08s: Traders right someone who works for SAS
455.64s: Guana someone who works for Goldman and
457.68s: people see them at work all day but
460.40s: that's a very
462.60s: different thing like it's a totally
465.80s: different game it's like
468.56s: saying you're in the Army I'm in the
471.04s: Army right except that you're in Special
473.52s: Forces and I'm a cook you know you're in
476.44s: the same industry but comparing like to
479.44s: like is kind of I mean it's just
482.84s: silly yeah and you hit on something that
485.88s: I try to reiterate as much as I can
487.52s: because I think this is something that
488.96s: retail Traders really struggle with and
490.64s: it's kind of the the friction aspect the
492.76s: cost of doing business it's hidden from
496.28s: them in a lot of places now right
498.24s: commissions are super low upfront
500.24s: commissions so can you talk a little bit
503.28s: more about the friction side of trading
505.76s: because you talk about how big of an
507.80s: impact that that has on profitability
511.00s: but then a lot of retail traders that
512.92s: don't fully understand that picture
514.60s: they'll say well well [ __ ] Robin Hood
516.84s: has zero commissions so I guess I'm
518.68s: doing really great I should hedge all
520.32s: the time yeah Robin Hood does have zero
523.04s: commissions but Robin Hood makes money
524.64s: and it's not just by selling ads right
526.88s: they're making money by basically
529.12s: passing your orders off to someone else
531.52s: the payment for order flow situation
534.00s: right that so they they get paid to send
536.12s: their order to Citadel and Citadel gives
538.36s: gives you a shitty fill than I get by
540.20s: putting it in through IB now IB charges
542.84s: me a dollar for per option if I go
545.56s: through as a retail person I think
547.80s: that's right right I don't know I
550.08s: don't yeah I think it's like 50 60 cents
552.64s: now for most like most of the main
554.72s: platforms per option okay so you don't
558.52s: see that on Robin Hood um because you
561.88s: don't get that but what you do get is a
563.96s: crappier fill from Citadel and it's
566.48s: probably worse like I would think that
568.60s: if you TR traded on Robin Hood and
570.20s: someone else traded on IB at the doing
573.32s: exactly the same trades at exactly the
575.08s: same time I think you'd probably do
577.00s: worse at the end of the year than you
578.44s: would on IB um like I'm pretty sure
582.60s: those costs are going to be higher
584.76s: because name another industry in the
586.88s: world where the wholesale operator has
589.96s: higher costs than the retail operator
592.16s: and if you're throwing [ __ ] through IB
594.56s: you are slightly closer to wholesale
597.20s: than you are if you're throwing [ __ ] to
598.72s: Robin
599.88s: Ood um and also it's like
604.52s: uh most of these retail platforms try
608.12s: and get people in with the bells and
611.08s: whistles right so you'll have an app
613.92s: you'll have a really nice way of
616.88s: measuring your risk and showing you know
620.36s: your p&l payoff under various scenarios
623.72s: and blah blah blah blah blah none of
625.36s: that's worth [ __ ] the thing you should
627.80s: use to improve your trading is none of
630.08s: that it's just the lowest costs because
633.20s: all of that other
634.60s: stuff it is it worthless no but it's not
639.20s: worth paying the amount you're paying in
641.64s: higher costs like if you give me a
643.88s: really nice platform that has all that
645.44s: stuff and then a crappy one that doesn't
647.36s: and they've got the same costs well
648.92s: obviously right but it doesn't it's like
652.28s: it's like how cinos give you free
654.64s: drinks you know and every I mean they
656.92s: seem they seem great right you can have
658.72s: a nice whiskey that's a $112 drink I
662.32s: mean the casinos they're not
664.80s: idiots you think you think TD mer trades
668.12s: making all that nice looking stuff and
669.76s: not charging you for it just because
671.32s: they like
674.12s: you I think you bring up another point
677.12s: that dovetails beautifully off of that
679.16s: where I don't think retail Traders fully
683.12s: understand the landscape of how Brokers
685.68s: fit into this world meaning I think a
688.56s: lot of think for example like broker
691.32s: education really cool that a lot of
693.36s: Brokers will provide education but I
695.60s: think they don't understand some of the
697.20s: inherent incentives on the broker side
699.20s: in what they're presenting to retail
701.08s: Traders what's your perspective on the
705.56s: way that the broker and Retail customer
708.32s: relationship operates because I think a
711.76s: common thought process towards that is
713.72s: retail Traders think like oh we're
715.20s: friends they're trying to do everything
717.32s: they can for me because they like me not
720.48s: fully understanding what it actually
723.84s: is yeah it's
726.20s: um I haven't thought of it like that but
728.76s: yeah people think oh that education
731.92s: platform that sends me to this brokerage
734.44s: they really want me to do well so they
736.44s: think the broker is their friend right
738.68s: but and then they think the market maker
740.28s: is their enemy whereas an actual fact
742.96s: the broker is your friend and the way a
745.04s: drug dealer is your friend sure he's
747.12s: going to be friendly but he wants you to
748.96s: buy the damn drugs and the option tra
752.16s: broker wants you to do all the options
754.92s: you think it's a coincidence that a lot
757.44s: of these people are pushing you to do
759.60s: iron Condors every day you know how much
762.60s: money that wraps up for the broker in
765.20s: commissions so and conversely the market
768.60s: maker doesn't give a [ __ ] about any of
770.16s: you the market the market maker doesn't
772.52s: think about retail at all
776.12s: so yeah it's uh I mean Brokers want you
779.96s: to trade and I I think that's one of the
783.12s: problems where people
785.88s: are this is one of the big deals with
788.32s: zero DTE right the edges and zero DTE
791.24s: are minuscule but the costs are still
793.80s: the same you're still paying like what
796.08s: do you say 60 cents an option so you can
798.64s: pay 60 cents an option for a three-month
800.80s: option or one that's got three hours
803.16s: left so the costs relative to your Edge
806.20s: just become enormous but the broker
809.08s: doesn't care you're doing that every day
810.76s: just look at the numbers for him um and
813.68s: one of the problems and this is
815.00s: professionals as
816.40s: well costs are always small on any given
819.64s: day like your p&l just from doing the
822.36s: options might be plus or minus 5,000
824.48s: bucks and your cost might be
826.76s: $50 but that's $50 every single day you
831.40s: make $5,000 give me $50 bucks you lost
834.12s: five give me 50 bucks I mean it's like
837.08s: you're attaching a negative an
839.36s: infinitely negative sharp ratio to a
842.40s: variable p&l so people don't want to
845.92s: hear this right they want to think how
847.80s: do I improve my trading it's like I do
849.96s: more research I look at new indicators
852.20s: all that kind of stuff you improve your
854.08s: trading by reducing your costs you get
857.12s: the cheapest possible service you can
860.48s: you negotiate the best rates you can and
863.56s: then you trade as little as you can to
867.68s: maintain the Expos Ure to the risk
869.64s: factor you want so if that means you're
873.76s: accepting more variance around
876.00s: it that's probably what you should do
879.16s: variance isn't your enemy I mean
882.00s: variance it's not fun but it doesn't
884.40s: cost you money on average but cost you
888.44s: money to remove
890.08s: it right and the thing you highlighted
893.64s: earlier is something funny because I see
895.60s: this on Twitter a lot where people they
898.76s: retail Traders seem to like to make it
901.12s: like a David versus Goliath him versus
903.96s: you know them kind of thing where if you
906.32s: make money that you're keeping it from
909.00s: the market maker there's literally gifts
911.44s: and memes about that exact thing and I
914.44s: always just chuckle when I see those
916.24s: because it's just you know they're
917.36s: they're missing the the broader
919.48s: relationship but speaking of the market
921.08s: makers I actually just did a video on
923.00s: this not too long ago but it was a good
924.84s: question that came up in on Reddit that
929.08s: I wanted to get your thoughts on which
931.04s: is market makers we know they're subject
933.44s: to order flow they essentially are going
935.40s: to make markets as orders come in but
939.32s: there's a lot of this conversation about
942.08s: like a max pain strike and then
944.48s: potential stock market manipulation
947.16s: depending on if we're very close I think
949.40s: at least that's the most efficacious
952.20s: variant of that I've seen whereas you
955.20s: know some people will say well if max
956.88s: pay is 15 points away you know if it's a
959.28s: $100 product or whatever they'll say you
961.52s: know it's like the market maker not
963.36s: moving to 15 points ban like it's just
965.28s: the order flow is going to be what it is
967.40s: but what are your thoughts on Max Payne
969.76s: let's say if it's a $100 stock Max Payne
971.76s: is at 101 and right now we're trading at
974.84s: 100 and a half okay so I got to back up
977.60s: a bit what the [ __ ] does max pain mean
981.16s: yeah okay okay and the fact I have no
983.92s: idea about that and I've been in the
985.40s: market making world for 30 years tells
987.64s: you an awful lot about what market
989.28s: makers think about it I legitimately
991.40s: don't know what that strike means is
994.36s: that like the amount of gamar exposure
996.20s: they've got and that kind of stuff it's
999.36s: where the highest notional value of open
1002.20s: interest lives so the the theory then is
1006.84s: that the market makers obviously would
1008.92s: prefer for those options to expire
1010.88s: worthless if they had a choice so the
1013.28s: idea is that if they're very close that
1015.68s: there would be some element of
1017.80s: manipulation to attempt to get just over
1020.48s: that hurdle that's the idea okay so
1023.80s: that's a real effect without a doubt and
1026.20s: it's nothing to do with the market
1027.48s: makers trying to do anything at all what
1032.68s: actually happens is the market makers
1034.84s: just through the nature of their Dynamic
1036.96s: hedging if they're long right so if
1040.48s: they're long they want the market to
1042.08s: move right they long volatility right
1044.28s: they want movement but the thing is if
1046.36s: you're long and the market goes up you
1048.04s: sell stock if it goes down you buy stock
1052.00s: so the market makers manipulation is
1055.00s: almost always screwing themselves over
1058.44s: so it's when they're long that they'll
1060.80s: get pinned to a strike because the
1062.56s: dynamic hedging is compressing things
1065.24s: and conversely if they're short they'll
1068.16s: get driven away from the strike so it's
1070.88s: not manipulation but if you want to
1072.92s: think of it as someone getting
1074.76s: systematically screwed over it's the
1077.28s: market makers who are getting screwed
1078.88s: over it's not it's not retail and market
1082.36s: makers can't push things with the
1085.48s: exception of very very small stuff if
1087.84s: you got a stock with a I don't know
1090.44s: daily option sorry a
1092.84s: daily I don't know daily stock volume of
1096.64s: I don't know 100,000 shares and there's
1099.36s: a $5,000 sorry a 5,000 lot option
1103.24s: position that's out there somehow yeah
1105.60s: that'll move the market but if you look
1108.48s: if you take the S&P complex and you look
1111.12s: at the total amount of Trades that go
1114.28s: through as hedging for option M
1118.16s: positions it's less than 1% of the daily
1121.92s: volume I mean no one's manipulating the
1124.92s: S&P 500 I mean that's like me standing
1128.76s: at the dock and trying to push a
1130.32s: battleship right it's just not going to
1132.20s: move it you know it's market makers if
1136.52s: there's manipulation going on it's man
1139.44s: it's market makers getting pushed around
1141.16s: by big customer flow and it it really is
1145.56s: a it's a secondary tertiary effect I
1148.80s: think people like to talk about it
1150.52s: because it removes the responsibility
1153.84s: from them
1157.24s: but do you remember do you ever watch
1159.52s: madman yeah okay so there's there's a
1162.76s: thing where dond Draper is talking to
1167.24s: Pete and Pete's like going on about I
1169.32s: think this about you I think this about
1170.88s: you and Don Draper looks at him in a
1172.76s: kind of a blank way and says I don't
1175.48s: think about you at
1176.84s: all you know and and that's how market
1179.52s: makers feel about pushing the market
1182.44s: round and stuff I mean they're too busy
1184.12s: doing other [ __ ] if you're you're Market
1186.24s: making stocks you'll be Market making
1188.04s: options on three or 400 stocks you don't
1191.84s: have the time and the energy and the
1194.40s: bandwidth to go around pushing something
1197.24s: around because you know I don't know
1200.24s: someone in Reddit bought 500 options I
1203.32s: mean it it's just not going to
1206.36s: register um so yeah I think you
1211.52s: highlighted it beautifully though where
1213.80s: the retail Traders looking for a
1215.08s: boogeyman right like they they want
1216.92s: something to remove their own shortfalls
1220.76s: and to be able to blame
1222.40s: something yeah and you look you'll
1224.60s: definitely see situations where you
1226.64s: identify the strike and then the Market
1228.60s: rushes towards it I mean of course you
1231.04s: will
1232.60s: but it's it doesn't happen
1235.52s: systematically um and it doesn't happen
1237.52s: big enough to actually do anything with
1239.88s: I mean you
1241.88s: can't again generally you know so I know
1245.96s: there's going to be someone out there
1247.28s: now who's mad about the fact that I just
1249.20s: said that because it's Reddit right so
1252.76s: people are mad on Reddit all the time
1255.00s: it's grumpy yeah yeah it's like what am
1257.44s: I going to be piss ped off about today
1261.04s: so yeah in general it's just not really
1263.88s: a market makers aren't manipulating
1265.88s: anything with the exception of the Vex
1267.60s: market makers on the expiration where
1270.52s: those guys are still screwing over the
1272.48s: world talk a little bit more about
1275.76s: that
1277.44s: um vix Futures settle to the the print
1283.12s: of the Vex on the open on a given
1286.20s: day you can manipulate
1288.56s: the print of the Vex by
1292.44s: trading S&P
1294.72s: options so if you're trading and
1297.36s: particularly very far out of the money
1299.68s: puts so you can push that around a bit
1303.16s: just by for example hitting all the bids
1305.52s: or lifting all the offers that that's
1307.60s: enough to shift the vix settlement a
1311.04s: bit
1312.96s: um
1314.64s: it it's a big enough deal with the vix
1317.44s: where there was was a people were really
1319.44s: complaining about it maybe three or four
1321.08s: years ago and telling the CBOE they
1322.64s: should fix it and blah blah blah blah
1324.08s: blah but they're not going to fix it
1326.00s: because if you look where the big market
1327.24s: makers are they're the guys who are
1329.40s: doing that so they're not you know
1332.76s: you're not going to convince those firms
1335.68s: I'm not going to mention them because I
1336.92s: don't want them suing me you're not
1338.64s: going to convince those firms to go
1340.36s: along with a restructuring of that but
1342.36s: you could easily you could easily fix it
1344.12s: you could have an averaging process over
1345.80s: an hour or something or and that used to
1349.04s: be a really big deal in
1351.44s: index um Futures as well like when I was
1355.76s: trading in Germany there were a couple
1358.20s: of times
1360.32s: when the settlement to say like the
1364.00s: curve would it should have been sloping
1365.28s: up right September should have been
1366.72s: under December but there were a couple
1369.08s: of times when I was there where the
1370.60s: December future settlement price was
1373.16s: above the December price and it was
1376.72s: higher than the index itself had ever
1379.24s: traded because of the way they settled
1381.32s: the index it was like to the first
1383.04s: certain number of Trades of each stock
1386.52s: so they don't have to be synchronous and
1389.08s: it's just yeah manipulation manipulation
1392.16s: like that happens because that's like an
1394.60s: instantaneous thing that you can do with
1396.56s: very small volumes if you do it right
1399.88s: when you say very small volumes in that
1401.96s: context I still imagine like the vix
1403.92s: itself isn't like small obviously
1405.92s: neither is the S&P 500 product so when
1408.40s: you say like very small volumes what
1411.44s: like what is that because for a retail
1413.24s: Trader it's probably still huge but oh
1416.00s: you're talking about multiple thousands
1418.28s: of S&P options the big ones um but yeah
1422.40s: you do the numbers I mean these these
1424.60s: guys aren't doing it randomly right they
1426.32s: know that each point in the vix is worth
1428.52s: this amount to them they know they can
1429.96s: move the vix by this amount by spending
1432.12s: this amount on the
1433.72s: options um yeah that is a thing but and
1438.04s: then for that kind of phenomenon to to
1440.32s: hold true is there do you think
1442.68s: collusion between some of the different
1445.08s: firms in order to move things more
1446.68s: efficiently or is it just kind of each
1448.44s: person kind of understanding that that's
1450.76s: generally what people are going to try
1452.16s: to do in their position
1456.60s: anyways I doubt that there's
1459.88s: actual real collusion because people
1464.72s: well I was going to say people aren't
1465.84s: stupid but we've seen a couple of
1467.28s: situations of pollion recently right in
1469.88s: the metals market and then liore um I
1473.56s: mean if you're if you're [ __ ] around
1475.52s: with
1476.44s: liore that's you know that's a pretty
1479.48s: big deal and these guys were right what
1481.48s: they using SnapChat or Whatsapp or
1483.92s: something but anyway I'm I don't think
1487.64s: these firms would be doing that because
1490.16s: it's not one or two Traders doing it
1492.36s: it's like more of a team
1494.52s: effort um there was a thing that I saw
1497.84s: I'm trying to think of it maybe three or
1499.44s: four years ago I saw a way that you
1502.32s: could sort of predict which way the vix
1506.12s: was going to get pushed on the
1507.48s: settlement literally my next question
1509.88s: but I can't remember what that was damn
1512.16s: it and also I mean I don't know that was
1514.84s: a long time ago I don't know if it's
1516.08s: still true yeah because that actually
1518.40s: seems like the kind of thing that would
1519.60s: be right up your alley with some of the
1521.76s: things that you talk about in terms of
1523.24s: you know people finding Edge through
1525.36s: observable phenomenon but
1528.92s: it's it's I guess the closest analogy
1532.08s: would be Market on close order
1535.36s: imbalances um which is one of those
1537.68s: things everyone thinks it's got to have
1539.56s: some sort of predictive power right and
1543.04s: people think first if you know there's a
1544.96s: big buy order you can front run it or
1547.80s: whatever but it turns out by the time
1550.52s: that's made public it really it you
1553.00s: can't there's not much in that anymore
1554.92s: either um so sometimes just because
1557.20s: these things look like they're front
1559.56s: runnable or
1561.64s: fitable I mean doesn't mean they
1564.04s: necessarily are and I think you know the
1565.88s: order and balance thing probably was but
1568.76s: it's just not really
1570.56s: anymore by the look of it there's a lot
1573.44s: of things that I've heard you talk about
1575.32s: that seem to fall into that not any more
1578.44s: category or is not as much just meaning
1580.60s: in terms of like what kind of edge can
1582.24s: be extracted or what provides Edge I
1584.44s: guess is the better way to phrase that
1586.36s: do what's the 10 years from now look
1589.28s: like do you think that a lot of the
1590.56s: things that we do will continue to
1592.36s: contract like that because even
1593.64s: something like variance risk premiums we
1595.20s: know it exists it's still there it's
1596.48s: been observable and it probably will
1597.88s: continue to be there but it's definitely
1600.76s: contracted a bit do you think that it'll
1602.60s: get to the point where it's not worth
1605.36s: the risk taken or that there will be
1606.84s: another
1608.08s: alternative I for that one I doubt it um
1611.80s: for two reasons first it's been around
1613.60s: for you know as long as we've known
1615.48s: about options so at least 30 years we've
1618.32s: known about this right so the fact it's
1620.40s: been low recently although it wasn't in
1622.88s: the first half of this year you would
1624.00s: have [ __ ] killed it right so the fact
1626.12s: it might have been
1627.88s: low something's low for two years but
1630.60s: it's been big for 128 years
1633.56s: statistically that's not much in the way
1635.20s: of evidence right and the the other
1637.64s: thing is there were just such
1640.00s: sound of psychological reasons for it
1642.60s: being there you know if someone's taking
1644.84s: risk
1645.76s: away they they're going to pay for that
1648.56s: you know and you know in options land
1652.28s: options are risk neutral they don't care
1654.28s: whether you're the buyer or the seller
1655.72s: they think you're only interested in
1657.08s: expected value but it's not like
1660.60s: that when we're talking about the
1663.24s: movement of variance risk premiums what
1666.28s: are some of the simpler ways that a less
1669.44s: sophisticated retail Trader can track
1672.60s: that
1674.08s: relationship well it's really easy to
1676.20s: track what it has been
1679.08s: um and there's there's lots of measures
1681.68s: of it there's no such thing as risk
1683.16s: premium right there are it's a family of
1686.12s: things right so one of the one of the
1688.80s: ways you could do it is just keep track
1691.60s: of the at the money volatility of say a
1695.12s: constant tenner option so like the S&P
1698.76s: 30-day and which you can legitimately do
1701.16s: now through a day right the 30-day at
1704.40s: the money volatility and then see what
1706.80s: the subsequent
1708.48s: it would be 21 trading days realized
1711.76s: volatility looked like so you can do
1714.64s: that the problem with the risk premium
1716.56s: is you don't actually see it
1719.68s: contemporaneously because all I know now
1721.72s: I know today what the implied Vol was
1724.60s: I'm not going to know what realized V
1726.40s: was in for for another month you know so
1729.68s: you're comparing things going forward
1732.68s: with a particular observation now so
1735.80s: it's difficult to do that and very
1737.88s: difficult to predict it um it seems like
1741.36s: it would be easy because you know it's a
1743.80s: mean reverting series uh you would think
1747.36s: it would be
1748.68s: easy and it's not impossible but like I
1752.24s: said it's one of those things which it's
1753.60s: really hard to beat the simple naive
1756.20s: observation that there's a risk premium
1758.36s: so I'm going to sell options every month
1759.80s: and rebalance them it's really T it's
1762.08s: really hard to beat That by timing the
1764.76s: market um you
1767.84s: bring up two things the first one I'm
1770.92s: going to linger on because it was the
1772.12s: last thing you said this is just another
1774.00s: saying I hear a lot this is more for
1776.28s: like um equities trading I see it used
1779.44s: but I'm genuinely just curious in your
1781.12s: thoughts on the saying that time in the
1783.56s: market beats timing the
1786.88s: market for most people over most time
1789.56s: periods that's unequivocally true um
1793.64s: timing the
1796.32s: market the problem with it is even if
1798.80s: you get the fluctuations right you'll be
1801.92s: out of the market or short the market
1805.48s: enough times that you're going against
1807.84s: that tide I mean think about it the
1809.92s: market is literally giving you 8% a year
1813.00s: so that's what you've got to beat by all
1814.72s: of your little wiggling around
1816.52s: furthermore all of your little wiggling
1818.24s: around you got to pay tax on all those
1820.64s: profits and the more the more invested
1823.84s: you are and the more often you're
1825.44s: trading the worse your Situation's going
1828.20s: to be right because it's all going to be
1829.68s: short term um and you're actually
1833.92s: trading all the time so there's trading
1835.84s: costs involved it's very difficult to
1838.40s: beat the market by timing it I it's more
1843.96s: possible to beat the market by picking
1847.44s: stocks I mean again not easy you know
1851.80s: like Warren Buffett like we were talking
1853.28s: about before Warren Buffett who you know
1856.24s: legitimately
1857.76s: a
1858.68s: legend his his sharp ratio was about
1862.16s: 74 you know and I've seen people
1865.28s: on Twitter Reddit you know whatever
1869.32s: platform you like who are like well I'm
1871.24s: not going to do all that work to get a
1872.68s: sharp ratio of one well you know go and
1876.16s: tell Warren Buffett that he's wasted his
1878.04s: life because getting a sharp ratio of
1880.44s: one a real one over a long period of
1883.64s: time I mean that's going to that's going
1885.56s: to put you in the Hall of Fame as a
1887.48s: stock Trader or as a long-term Trader
1891.84s: so I mean it's just I think people have
1894.48s: wildly unrealistic
1896.40s: expectations you know the people who are
1898.24s: like I just want to make 1% a day or
1901.24s: even I want to make 1% a week really
1904.52s: that's nearly 60% a year can you do that
1907.44s: well sure some years you will absolutely
1909.76s: but on average again just get your
1912.76s: calculator out and see what you know
1914.76s: $10,000 compounded 60% a year year see
1917.64s: what you've got after two decades you
1919.76s: know tell me if you think that's
1923.08s: likely well the follow on to that is a
1927.48s: lot of times when people say time in the
1930.16s: market beats timing the market they'll
1931.92s: add a secondary metric I've seen
1934.24s: different versions of it but typically
1935.68s: it's like you know if you miss the 10
1937.44s: best days then your return drops to
1940.20s: whatever right I'm always
1943.16s: curious how to think about that because
1945.72s: to me that also would indicate that
1949.08s: there's a pretty significant reward if
1951.88s: you can get decent at timing the market
1955.16s: in intermittent time frames I think most
1958.96s: of us acknowledge that timing the market
1961.16s: in very short-term time frames is
1964.60s: near again I don't like using absolutes
1967.92s: it just seems near impossible it might
1969.44s: be doable but it seems very difficult
1971.56s: but what do you think about the capacity
1975.00s: to time markets in more moderate time
1977.68s: frames because we do know a few things
1979.60s: about markets in Long Run
1983.44s: series um I don't think that's
1986.40s: particularly easy either if you think
1989.20s: back to the two biggest Market crashy
1992.16s: events of my life well
1995.76s: certainly you know anyway the 2008
2000.00s: crisis right when stocks absolutely
2003.20s: crazed I knew plenty of people who sold
2005.60s: the bottom of that one
2007.52s: and these aren't like people who are you
2009.88s: know idiots these are like professionals
2012.72s: who thought the market was going to zero
2015.16s: more importantly Co right the headlines
2018.36s: from around Co and all the sensible
2021.52s: views on what would happen would have
2023.84s: had the stock market absolutely crashing
2026.64s: the stock market had some of its best
2028.68s: years after Co in 20121 the stock market
2032.16s: was up
2033.84s: 28% you know it's like all of
2037.72s: your sort of this is what's reasonable
2041.40s: would have pointed you in the wrong
2042.80s: direction and think of all the people
2047.04s: who made a couple of famous calls back
2049.40s: in the old days you know like someone
2051.28s: who predicted the 87 crash and then
2054.20s: they've been predicting crashes ever
2056.52s: since
2058.08s: right let's say you're an absolute
2060.48s: Legend and you predict a 10%
2063.40s: crash did you also miss the 28% rally
2067.88s: 2021 because that you've got to get a
2070.24s: lot of 10% crashes right I.E make
2074.24s: legendary calls a lot in order to make
2078.96s: up for a couple of bad ones you know
2083.80s: so maybe but I'm not going to waste my
2086.40s: time doing it I got other things to do
2089.16s: yeah I kind of see it in two different
2090.56s: lights because to me it seems like if
2092.96s: you can get okay at it it definitely
2095.12s: would pay well but then I also look at
2097.88s: if you look at like a day Trader's
2100.64s: typical life I and again I'm a pretty
2102.84s: Stark Advocate against day trading being
2106.28s: like the only thing somebody does I
2108.00s: think it's good to diversify across time
2109.48s: frames but for a day trader if you think
2111.76s: about like a good day they might take a
2114.16s: point out of something on Monday a point
2116.20s: out of something on Tuesday so on and so
2117.80s: forth and they might miss a couple days
2120.60s: they might be down a couple days but
2122.76s: then you know I look at the aggregate
2125.00s: performance for them and a lot of times
2127.88s: if they had a good week they might make
2129.60s: 10 points but you know the underlying
2132.12s: might have moved up 15 or 20 points so
2134.60s: it's kind of like you're you know
2136.12s: cycling to catch these small things even
2138.72s: though the positive drift or you know
2140.32s: whatever the force was at the time led
2141.92s: to this bigger move that you then didn't
2143.44s: participate
2144.80s: in do you think that there's a middle
2148.40s: ground for people that are looking to
2150.40s: time things where if your goal is not so
2153.72s: much to top tick or bottom tick but if
2156.04s: your goal is is to generally ride the
2159.52s: positive drift of things but then
2162.00s: decrease your participation in draw
2164.68s: Downs because I think that there's two
2167.40s: ways most retail Traders can do really
2169.64s: well one of them is make really good
2172.88s: returns if you can do that but then the
2175.00s: second is to avoid draw Downs to not go
2178.04s: down as much as the market because then
2179.80s: you obviously have a better Launchpad
2181.36s: for whenever you can resume the
2184.20s: upside I'm not
2187.24s: convinced they that they're any easier
2190.76s: you know
2191.68s: I the way to avoid draw Downs right is
2194.48s: deciding when the Market's going to go
2196.32s: down and I don't I mean that seems to be
2199.16s: a very difficult problem or you buy puts
2202.48s: which is almost always a bad bit because
2206.24s: they're wildly overpriced right
2210.52s: so I I think they seem like different
2213.56s: approaches but I'm not sure they are but
2216.48s: I would take a little bit of issue with
2218.44s: your first thing you were talking about
2219.96s: about you know the market went up 20
2221.52s: points and you took 10 points out of it
2224.16s: I think that's
2226.48s: legitimate if you aren't benchmarking
2229.40s: against the market so let's say you put
2231.80s: all your retirement savings into you
2234.84s: know some mutual fund and you already
2237.16s: look at it every quarter good idea by
2239.72s: the way right but every day you come in
2243.52s: and you're just trying to ride the
2245.32s: fluctuations in something and go home
2248.28s: flat I I think that's legit I mean
2251.08s: that's sort of how I treated Bitcoin or
2253.68s: the crypto space in general right I
2255.32s: wouldn't want to be in Krypton I mean I
2257.84s: have no interest in being invested in
2261.28s: any of that garbage with any of those
2263.20s: garbage people who do that garbage stuff
2266.64s: but as something that sort of just
2267.92s: Wiggles around yeah that seems fine so I
2271.20s: think it's legitimate as a day trader to
2273.36s: Benchmark yourself against cash and if
2275.60s: you're making 10 points a week on that
2277.24s: basis that's that's terrific it's a
2279.00s: different thing to
2282.52s: long-term Holdings I don't want to say
2285.08s: investing is different from Trading
2286.72s: because they're not they're both exactly
2288.96s: the same thing but they're on very
2290.64s: different time scales the way we usually
2292.72s: use those words but you know when
2294.84s: someone says I'm not a Trader I'm an
2296.84s: investor really I mean look up the
2298.88s: definitions of what those things mean
2300.84s: right it's exactly the same gambling as
2304.28s: well right all of them you're putting at
2307.20s: risk in an uncertain situation with the
2310.12s: aim of making money I mean it's all the
2313.56s: rest of it is sort
2316.44s: of I mean I don't know a lot of it's uh
2319.92s: moralizing I think being an invester
2323.56s: that makes you a good sound human being
2325.96s: being a Trader well that makes you sort
2328.52s: of a risk Seeker but you might be a
2330.72s: superstar and being a gambler well
2332.96s: you're going to be you know lying on the
2334.80s: side of the road drinking out of a you
2337.12s: know a bottle in a paper bag but none of
2340.72s: that's true right I know I know gamblers
2343.04s: who've made
2344.04s: millions and I know plenty of investors
2346.36s: who've lost money
2349.48s: so there you go yeah but then what
2352.24s: random pedantic terminology could people
2355.20s: fight about if you know we don't nitpick
2358.44s: terms well I mean that's the thing right
2360.72s: I mean well nowadays people will never
2363.08s: run out of things to be mad about that's
2365.32s: fair yeah yeah that's totally fair um
2370.16s: the so this is another interesting
2374.08s: Paradox that I think is fun to talk
2376.76s: about which is a lot of what we're
2379.92s: talking about here is looking at
2383.20s: historic reference periods observing
2385.68s: something and then making an assumption
2388.68s: about what it's more likely to do in the
2390.24s: future right how do you balance the idea
2394.24s: of using a historic reference period
2396.44s: period but then tomorrow isn't
2399.72s: necessarily today or what isn't
2401.68s: necessarily going to be what it was
2403.28s: yesterday yet if you look at like the
2406.16s: properties of volatility right the
2408.56s: easiest way to see what volatility is
2410.48s: going to be tomorrow is take a peek at
2411.92s: what it was today it'll probably be
2413.20s: close to that but then we also know that
2415.04s: volatility does have transition periods
2418.08s: where it's going to move to another
2419.68s: period to to Cluster so it seems like
2421.92s: those two things are at opposites where
2424.16s: there's a historic reference period that
2425.88s: we then try to forecast off of but then
2427.64s: we're also saying you can't really trust
2429.40s: this too
2433.00s: much okay you watch
2435.12s: baseball no [ __ ] hate it boring as
2438.44s: [ __ ] but you are aware there is a game
2440.92s: called baseball very aware right and the
2444.16s: best team like
2447.12s: ever like might win 110 games right so
2451.64s: the best team without a doubt the best
2454.20s: team is only going to win 23 of their
2456.76s: games so then you've got a really strong
2459.88s: signal but the noise is also very very
2462.48s: big so it's it's clear that a team of
2465.00s: Hall of Famers is better than a team of
2467.56s: Scrubs but the amount of Randomness in
2470.08s: there is still very big so that's the
2472.44s: sort of thing about the signal and the
2474.32s: noise with Finance you know over time
2478.20s: you know you come back to me in 50 years
2480.28s: the stock market will be higher
2482.60s: guaranteed what's it going to do next
2484.64s: week I I have no idea you know because
2487.16s: we're looking at well on a daily level
2490.08s: right and I was just looking at this
2491.60s: today so I'm not I know these numbers
2494.08s: for a reason I don't know every year
2496.12s: 2021 the market went up 27 a
2498.88s: half% but the average daily
2501.84s: volatility on a daily level was
2505.48s: 8% right so the the daily Randomness is
2509.36s: about eight times as big as the daily
2511.24s: Drift But the drift is the thing that we
2513.88s: can predict so there's all always what
2517.32s: we don't know is always going to be way
2520.44s: bigger than what we do know so you look
2523.60s: for these broad effects stocks go up uh
2526.84s: carry is a good thing um options are
2531.96s: overpriced uh leveraged ETFs go down
2535.96s: these have all got a lot of data behind
2539.64s: them and they've also got compelling
2542.36s: theoretical reasons for why they're true
2545.24s: like you can't just look at data and say
2547.68s: well this is what has been in the past I
2549.28s: think it's what going forward
2552.64s: because well there's got to be a reason
2555.76s: too and if you can't identify the reason
2558.64s: you're really you're in a very
2561.64s: unpleasant
2563.20s: place
2565.00s: because you don't know when your Edge is
2568.28s: going to go away because you don't
2570.12s: really understand why your Edge was
2571.96s: there in the first place if you're a
2574.36s: highfrequency Trader that's not a
2575.92s: problem
2577.04s: right you don't need reasons because you
2578.68s: got so much statistics you know you got
2580.72s: millions of data points for a day but if
2583.52s: you're an option Trader you know the vix
2586.48s: has been around for what 32 years you
2590.72s: know that's not a lot of data on a daily
2593.40s: time frame and volatility realistically
2596.04s: moves on more like a weekly or a monthly
2598.16s: time frame you don't know very much
2600.68s: about the Vex so just doing analysis on
2605.08s: that
2606.60s: isn't you need a theoretical reason on
2609.36s: top of
2611.36s: that that's a really great way to think
2614.92s: about that yeah I because it's it's
2618.24s: something that I've always used more of
2620.80s: a probabilistic explanation but I think
2623.88s: the part that you highlighted there
2625.36s: that's something that I definitely will
2626.52s: kind of put in my pocket going forward
2628.80s: is the idea of identifying a reason
2630.84s: because I think that that does at least
2633.32s: help us understand some of the
2634.56s: pervasiveness whereas like I said said
2636.28s: for me I I typically would just look at
2638.84s: a recent part of the series and then
2641.76s: just think it's more likely to look like
2643.84s: that now that leads to be fair there are
2647.76s: plenty of times when I do trades just on
2649.96s: the statistics and I don't really know
2651.64s: the
2652.48s: reason um but I think you have to treat
2656.16s: them very differently from ones where
2657.92s: you do know the reason you know
2661.48s: there I mean I'm not saying that I don't
2664.00s: overtrade I'm not saying I don't
2667.24s: stupid stuff on things that are
2669.36s: marginal um try and manage that tendency
2673.16s: but there are certain certainly times
2674.84s: where I do trades just because
2676.28s: something's always worked rather than I
2678.04s: know why it's always worked
2681.28s: right it leads me to a follow- on
2683.64s: question where we know volatility
2686.52s: clusters we know that it meain reverts
2689.28s: what are your thoughts on different ways
2692.36s: Traders can
2694.04s: identify if it is likely to begin
2697.68s: transitioning into a different
2702.08s: spot it the sort of the Holy Grail right
2706.20s: is to predict when it goes from a low
2709.04s: volatility to a high volatility
2711.92s: State that's really difficult because
2714.60s: all of those transitions are driven by
2716.64s: something different you know like
2719.32s: volatility needs a catalyst in order for
2721.60s: it to go up um it doesn't need a
2724.12s: catalyst for it to stay low you know
2726.20s: that just means nothing's happening um
2729.44s: whereas when something happens the
2731.64s: something's always different so if I
2735.36s: knew how to do that I would be very
2738.44s: happy but on the other hand you can
2742.12s: identify when spikes are likely to
2746.28s: revert because we've got data on the
2749.60s: average length of spikes you know
2753.08s: because it's difficult to predict that
2755.20s: bit but the Decay process afterwards I
2758.84s: mean that's basically what all of these
2761.28s: gar type models are modeling they're
2764.28s: modeling the speed of that mean
2766.36s: reversion so so that's possible I mean
2770.44s: that's that is what all the Myriad
2773.52s: thousands of versions of G do um but to
2777.72s: be honest you can kind of get a decent
2779.60s: idea of just looking what it's been like
2781.48s: in the past like when the vix spikes to
2784.40s: 40 when it comes back down through 40
2787.24s: how long did it take to get to 20 you
2789.68s: know not just the average but you know
2791.32s: what's the spread of results there and
2793.40s: just looking at what's happened in the
2795.16s: past give you a lot of you know a lot of
2798.08s: context for how things are likely to
2799.64s: come down it's much easier to predict
2802.04s: that relaxation Point than the spike and
2806.80s: predicting the spike is probably one of
2809.24s: those things I would put into
2811.76s: the it might be possible but it also
2815.56s: might might not be a very good use of
2818.24s: your time and
2820.72s: energy you know just because something's
2822.80s: possible doesn't mean it's economically
2825.00s: sensible to do
2827.12s: it right it seems to me what I like to
2831.40s: do if I'm trading some sort of vix
2834.28s: product looking at a more contemporary
2837.36s: time frame depending on the duration of
2839.08s: whatever my thesis is actually a trade
2840.68s: that I recently did that you would hate
2842.80s: is when the vix dipped below 13 I
2846.12s: established a long position in the vix
2848.20s: using options so I I bought um further
2852.40s: dated deep in the money calls and it's
2856.84s: what I did in that thesis was look at
2859.16s: the performance of the vix over the last
2861.44s: 18 months the periods that it dropped
2864.12s: below 13 the duration below 13 the
2867.12s: subsequent move
2868.48s: outs and I'm curious why you think that
2872.96s: that is more difficult than the reverse
2875.76s: ver back down if there's a way to wait
2880.92s: time frames because we know vix can stay
2882.84s: low for a really long period of time
2885.84s: yeah that's that's interesting there
2888.40s: are time series analysis by its very
2891.16s: nature works on a constant time slice
2894.32s: right so you say look what is the
2896.64s: property of the daily Vex time
2900.20s: series what is
2904.24s: more sens
2906.24s: in a way is to wait things in a
2908.56s: different way so you're waiting it by
2910.96s: something else that indicates busyness
2913.64s: so maybe volume maybe volatility maybe
2916.84s: you have a different way of slicing up
2918.84s: your series that
2922.12s: is it's an interesting research Avenue
2926.36s: so if someone is going to try and
2928.08s: research that themselves that's where I
2929.96s: would start it hasn't been studied to
2932.72s: anywhere near the same degree as the
2934.88s: time series stuff because it's the
2939.16s: mathematics doesn't fit it's not as easy
2941.64s: to do and like just coming up if you
2945.08s: want to measure the standard deviation
2946.64s: of something you need to have equally
2949.24s: spaced things so doing statistics on
2952.80s: something that isn't a Time series is
2955.00s: much
2956.24s: more well it's much more intricate and
2958.52s: it's nowhere near as well study uh but
2961.40s: that I think is a legitimate way of
2962.96s: looking at things I mean I wouldn't tell
2964.96s: you you're wrong for doing that
2967.40s: typically I think the problem with
2969.00s: buying the vix
2971.04s: is however you do it through Futures
2974.00s: through options through
2975.60s: ETFs the carry you're paying on that
2978.32s: basis is such a huge thing to overcome
2982.04s: and that's typically lot larger at low
2986.36s: levels so you look back to
2990.24s: 2016
2991.96s: 2017 I think a couple of the lowest fall
2994.76s: years like ever
2997.96s: um VXX decayed quite
3001.00s: significantly you know so typically
3003.32s: those really low volatility periods are
3006.28s: periods where that VA basis is really
3009.16s: high
3012.04s: so I'm not saying you're wrong and I
3015.72s: think looking at it in that way is
3017.96s: possibly
3019.40s: interesting but I haven't yeah it's not
3023.24s: easy put that way and I haven't done it
3026.00s: enough to say that you're wrong
3029.56s: there another slightly I'm going to make
3033.32s: a note of that I might have a go with
3034.88s: that at some point in some
3036.68s: form it's it's been interesting to be
3039.28s: honest and I've been I tinker with
3041.08s: different weightings different weight
3042.48s: periods different waiting
3044.20s: tools but because to your point like
3047.72s: that kind of trade it's not something I
3049.40s: would put on for nearly a decade what we
3052.76s: saw during the bull market but yeah it
3056.40s: it has been interesting you know one of
3058.64s: the ways
3060.52s: that's surprisingly
3064.24s: good if you've been putting on short V
3067.40s: trades and usually that's the way to go
3070.40s: right and you've been losing
3073.52s: money sometimes even though you're
3075.40s: losing money it's not because the Vex
3077.24s: has spiked or anything it's just path
3078.96s: dependency and whatever and you know
3080.68s: there's a lot of luck involved and all
3082.16s: that but actual volatility is still
3083.96s: where you think it should be
3086.64s: that sort of path dependent
3089.48s: noise seems to have some predictive
3092.12s: power of vol spikes going
3094.04s: forward um not a lot but you know one of
3098.64s: my friends James often says you
3101.92s: shouldn't sell V when short V is being a
3104.68s: deck and that's sort of what he means
3107.20s: it's like the profitability of V trades
3110.12s: tends to be correlated over time as well
3113.68s: so that's again
3116.24s: un an undeveloped research idea that
3119.44s: might be worth looking at more
3122.36s: yeah switching gear slightly this
3126.08s: was I didn't see you talk about this
3129.00s: stuff much in your book so when I got
3130.64s: this question for you on Reddit I think
3133.36s: it's a fair ask it's completely
3135.68s: different from like the more technical
3137.12s: stuff we've been talking about but
3139.12s: essentially somebody was saying looking
3140.92s: for career advice from you for people
3143.56s: that are looking to go from
3145.92s: retail trading the professional side and
3149.36s: I imagine you have an interesting
3150.68s: perspective there you already covered
3152.32s: some color around that based on how
3154.64s: different they are but what are your
3157.12s: thoughts on
3159.08s: that well for a start
3162.16s: I I emphasize again that they're often
3165.28s: very different jobs like a retail
3168.68s: Trader retail Traders have practically
3171.64s: no Edge over a professional who's
3174.08s: trading the same thing
3176.20s: right but if you're a professional and
3177.68s: you're a dispersion Trader that's what
3179.84s: you do you come in every day and you do
3181.72s: that you don't get to decide you know
3183.92s: what it's not working I'm going to trade
3185.64s: potato futures or whatever you you can't
3188.36s: you're part of the Cog you do your job
3191.12s: right and you're told what your job is
3193.80s: whereas if you're retail you don't have
3196.16s: to do that you can legitimately bounce
3198.84s: around so if that's your style and
3202.28s: you're like always finding the busy
3204.36s: thing or
3205.84s: the new little micro Edge which is
3209.12s: doable it's not easy but people can do
3211.60s: that um because in efficiencies come
3214.20s: along in various shapes and forms like
3216.12s: in crypto there was all that yield stuff
3218.76s: that worked really well for a while and
3220.64s: stuff like that so you can't do that as
3223.20s: a pro so they are different jobs in
3226.44s: terms of making that transition I'm not
3228.96s: really very
3230.48s: useful um I was going to say anymore but
3233.08s: probably ever we we
3236.24s: never hire well or hired depending on
3240.24s: whether what firm you're talking
3242.56s: to we never hired people from
3245.96s: outside the core group oh they would
3249.72s: either be professional traders who are
3252.44s: coming from another
3253.76s: firm or people straight out of college
3257.32s: so you come to me and say I've got this
3259.88s: this this and track
3261.40s: record it's a pretty heavy reach for the
3265.16s: firms I was at but again the firms I was
3267.56s: at of just one little bit of the
3270.76s: ecosystem so you're probably better
3275.20s: off trying to go to a hedge fund I would
3278.68s: think I think they're probably
3281.40s: less likely to be stuck into that we go
3284.80s: to we go to these 10 colleges every year
3287.24s: and interview students and hire the best
3289.28s: ones um but it's that's a it's a tough
3292.60s: transition and again it's sort of like
3294.28s: you know the arm thing right maybe
3296.72s: you're the best MMA fighter in the world
3298.64s: but that doesn't mean the Army doesn't
3300.16s: want people who can fight right the Army
3302.04s: wants soldiers it's a different job
3304.36s: seems the same but it really
3306.96s: isn't yeah can you talk a little bit
3309.20s: more about the the hedge fund angle
3311.84s: because that was actually my original
3313.04s: thought too especially because I think
3314.44s: one of the things retail Traders don't
3316.48s: fully understand is that at least maybe
3318.84s: I don't even understand either but it
3320.24s: seems like from what I've come across
3323.16s: that most of the time those kind of in
3325.04s: tions are looking for math Minds anyways
3328.08s: like just like really smart people PhD
3331.68s: types not to say that you can't break in
3334.28s: otherwise but it's not necessarily you
3337.20s: know if somebody tries to go work at a
3339.04s: firm and you tell them like oh I've been
3340.64s: a retail Trader for 10 years like
3342.04s: they're not going to give a [ __ ] about
3343.12s: that that's my guess well again that
3345.68s: would depend on the firm a lot the thing
3347.92s: about hedge funds is it's such a broad
3350.92s: category and
3354.00s: it's there will there will be hedge
3356.40s: funds that trade very much like your
3359.12s: what you think a retail Trader trades
3360.96s: like the problem with it is finding
3363.32s: those hedge funds whereas like if you're
3365.64s: looking at Citadel or
3368.08s: aqr yeah they're not going to take some
3371.32s: retail Trader either it's it's not so
3373.64s: much they want math Minds that's sort of
3376.80s: a bit that's not really to the degree
3379.88s: you might think um some firms do but a
3383.76s: lot of firms don't and I mean certainly
3386.12s: the Trad the kind of trading I've sort
3387.96s: of been
3389.08s: around the best Traders are certainly
3391.84s: not the ones who are the most
3394.60s: mathematical although having said that
3397.64s: when I say not mathematical I mean
3399.56s: engineering degree from Corell or
3401.36s: something so it's still pretty
3402.44s: mathematical but it's not I wouldn't
3405.12s: consider them math people but yeah the
3408.24s: problem with the problem with breaking
3410.44s: into the hedge fund world is it's just
3412.40s: so fractured and I mean that's a that's
3416.52s: more of a networking problem I don't
3418.40s: really know how you do
3422.44s: that what do you think the future for
3426.68s: kind of more of the Quant firms will
3429.16s: look like 10 years from
3430.88s: [Music]
3432.52s: now well it's probably just going to be
3434.92s: evolution of what's going on now right I
3438.28s: mean anything that can be computerized
3441.16s: gets computerized so the the where that
3444.08s: changes is the power of computers like
3447.16s: you know 20 years ago you just didn't
3449.68s: have the computing power to do what
3451.28s: they're doing now but computers haven't
3453.76s: really changed in their nature yet
3455.92s: they've just become more powerful
3457.48s: versions of what they were 20 years ago
3459.96s: but we're seeing now with the whole AI
3463.08s: thing incidentally if you don't pay 20
3466.00s: bucks a month for GPT
3468.44s: plus you're insane it's like the best 20
3471.96s: bucks I've ever spent it's better than
3474.84s: an intern by a lot um so that kind of
3478.92s: thing that's going to get incorporated
3480.64s: into trading much more and I know there
3482.52s: have been hedge funds for a long time
3484.08s: who say we've used Ai and blah blah blah
3486.04s: and they really didn't because up until
3488.80s: recently these guys who wrote GPT plus
3491.68s: are the best there is you know some
3494.28s: random dude at a hedge fund is not that
3497.12s: guy but this is that sort of level of AI
3501.12s: power is definitely going to change
3502.84s: things so it'll be the same as it's been
3505.44s: there'll be fewer traders in 10 years
3508.12s: because the good Traders will be able to
3511.68s: their skills will get leveraged over a
3514.20s: wider universe and the sort of the
3517.92s: junior Trader bit is going to keep
3521.08s: getting more and more automated out of
3522.88s: existence but that's the way it's been
3524.84s: going forever you know when I started if
3527.88s: you were trading stock options you'd
3529.60s: trade you'd stand in the stock option
3531.52s: pet and trade maybe options on two
3534.08s: things maybe maybe three whereas
3537.32s: now you know You' probably be trading
3539.80s: options on 3 or 400 stocks so there are
3542.76s: fewer Traders but each Trader is trading
3546.04s: more stuff so I see that that's probably
3549.72s: the evolutionary route that will
3551.96s: continue to go down it won't affect
3553.84s: retail because you can still do all the
3556.08s: stuff you do but it will lower the cost
3559.80s: structure on the professional side which
3563.08s: actually should help retail right it
3565.04s: does get passed down eventually you know
3567.52s: no one's paying 50 bucks a round turn
3569.24s: for futures anymore right and same
3573.64s: question but for hedge
3577.08s: funds again hedge funds are difficult
3579.72s: because they're
3581.60s: so such a broad thing I
3585.72s: mean aqr is a Quant firm you know that's
3590.48s: they're very quantitatively
3592.56s: driven um they will be leveraging this
3595.64s: computing power more and more but if
3597.72s: you're a macro
3599.96s: guy I mean you that's it's a totally
3602.60s: different game so I don't know I mean
3605.20s: maybe it will be such a big change that
3607.12s: those macro guys will actually be able
3608.96s: to make some
3610.40s: money not even going to lie that was
3613.52s: going to be my next question is do you
3615.80s: think that it will increase the efficacy
3618.96s: of macro specifically because one of the
3621.76s: things I noticed from like any of the
3623.68s: the macro community and again this is
3625.80s: just an personal anecdote for my own
3628.32s: small purview but it seems like a lot of
3631.40s: those [ __ ] guess at a lot of
3633.20s: [ __ ] things and just keep guessing
3636.08s: and sooner or later something's right
3638.08s: but if you look at like the actual
3639.72s: percent accuracy it seems so damn low
3643.08s: well you see I know you don't know about
3645.20s: baseball but you probably watch some
3647.80s: sports stuff you know NFL pream or
3650.60s: something right and you see these guys
3652.68s: who legitimately know an awful lot about
3655.44s: football right I mean I'm not maybe
3657.80s: they're not Geniuses but they've been in
3660.36s: the game they know the game they they
3663.04s: can't pick winners I
3666.00s: mean I see macro as like sports pundry
3670.84s: for
3671.68s: dogs I mean it's just it's the same kind
3675.96s: of thing they're always looking to tell
3677.60s: a story and there might be in the same
3680.24s: way with sports gambling where there are
3682.56s: pattern there's data you can look at
3684.96s: stuff you can do stuff people make money
3686.92s: doing that stuff maybe that's where
3689.28s: macro goes stop talking about [ __ ]
3691.84s: stories about what you think will happen
3693.92s: and actually do data analysis of what
3695.80s: happens when this happens and so forth
3698.32s: one of the problems with macro is that
3700.00s: all the situations are different right I
3702.84s: mean the war in
3705.40s: Ukraine totally different situation from
3708.00s: the war in Palestine like they're both
3710.68s: Wars people are getting killed on both
3714.60s: situations
3715.96s: but in practically you know the the
3719.72s: dissimilarities between them are so much
3722.16s: greater than the similarities so maybe
3724.72s: AI will be able to start sort of passing
3727.96s: that kind of stuff together
3730.96s: maybe why do you say maybe to me it
3733.24s: seems like it would be pretty fair I
3735.32s: don't think it'll be you know like
3736.56s: predictive in any capacity but I think
3738.16s: it probably could create some sort of
3740.60s: like multi-point analysis between
3743.12s: different things and to decide if
3745.00s: something is more similar or more
3746.68s: dissimilar and then maybe you can make a
3748.84s: like a hypothesis off of that or you
3750.28s: think it's too far of a reach no I mean
3752.48s: I think you could do something like a
3753.92s: cluster analysis right you know where
3756.56s: where it's like they've done interesting
3758.24s: stuff like that for sports as well like
3760.24s: right with basketball once you do a
3762.52s: cluster analysis of the commonalities
3764.40s: between different players it turns out
3766.64s: there aren't five positions you know
3769.52s: there's more like 11 positions it's just
3771.88s: you don't always have them all on at the
3774.40s: the same time um you could probably do
3777.96s: that kind of thing whether it's so you
3780.60s: could in that case say I don't know the
3783.56s: war in Palestine is much more similar to
3785.60s: the war in Northern Ireland than it is
3788.12s: to the war in Ukraine right it's a
3790.36s: gorilla thing in an urban
3793.00s: environment there aren't tanks driving
3795.88s: around and stuff and jet fighters
3799.72s: um maybe you could do that that I know
3802.96s: you can do right whether that's
3804.40s: predictive or not I don't know got it
3808.00s: yeah there's a lot of things that are
3810.60s: descriptive without being
3812.96s: predictive I think that's one of the
3815.12s: things I find so curious about that
3816.64s: stuff is that I feel like what we see
3820.96s: just in humanity on an annual basis is
3826.48s: almost something we've seen some
3828.32s: permutation of before but it's always
3831.60s: the Confluence of all of those different
3833.52s: permutations that create such a
3835.32s: different landscape at that given point
3837.32s: in time that's why I'm curious if AI
3841.36s: will be able to kind of decipher all of
3845.16s: those variables more successfully than
3846.80s: the human
3848.32s: mind I think it will do better
3852.84s: but I don't know
3856.40s: it's there's just
3858.52s: everything they're all so complicated in
3861.16s: different ways right it's like every
3865.20s: president in the last 50 years at least
3868.44s: has tried to solve the Middle East right
3871.76s: why haven't they there's no solution
3875.16s: there's no if there was an easy
3877.60s: solution then you know Gerald Ford would
3880.08s: have done it or something it's like
3882.08s: there's
3884.80s: no there's just no simple way to do this
3887.52s: and some even when they the wars stop
3889.96s: often people don't really know why that
3892.72s: happened like the northern Island thing
3896.24s: just kind of stopped and then they did
3898.92s: all the negotiation and stuff but it
3900.72s: wasn't the negotiation that stopped it
3902.60s: it just kind of Peete it out on its own
3905.72s: and then everyone was sort of looking
3906.88s: around for why did that end kind of
3908.76s: thing you know
3910.80s: so yeah it's always
3913.40s: just complicated it's difficult like
3916.16s: World War I right none of the people who
3918.92s: got involved in World War I really
3921.20s: wanted to get involved in it it just
3924.16s: sort of started happening and everyone
3925.84s: found themselves all pulled into it so
3928.68s: and that was like you know second worst
3931.72s: war ever right and it was sort of
3934.52s: something that the world was sort of at
3937.48s: that breaking point but you know some
3939.20s: Arch Duke getting shot I mean
3941.28s: realistically who gave a crap about that
3943.28s: that wasn't worth you know how many 20
3946.32s: million people dying or something I
3949.16s: don't even know how many people died in
3950.44s: World War I a lot actually good question
3953.28s: I'll find out right now
3954.88s: I'm curious what's your
3956.60s: guess
3958.76s: uh just combatant
3961.36s: casualties 20
3964.08s: million that's actually a really
3967.08s: insanely good guess
3969.92s: so total military and civilian
3972.60s: casualties was 40 million 20 million
3975.76s: deaths right on 21 million wounded the
3979.96s: total number of deaths includes 9.7
3982.56s: million military personnel in 10 million
3985.80s: civilians wow you were yeah well you
3989.00s: read about the battles right and like
3991.56s: the number of people killed on the first
3993.32s: day of the S it was like the size of a
3996.52s: fairly large city and now it's like a
3999.84s: terrible War right I mean we're talking
4002.40s: now thousands of people you know it's
4004.84s: like three or 400,000 people died in the
4007.00s: first six hours like it's uh it's
4011.72s: incomprehensible literally is
4013.32s: incomprehensible you just can't imagine
4015.16s: that right there was an entire
4016.48s: generation of European men who just was
4019.28s: missing vanished yeah yeah that's
4021.84s: actually this poster right here is of
4024.96s: the Marines at Bellow wood and like the
4027.64s: whole poster is there's you know uh
4030.84s: Marines and Germans and gas masks and
4033.68s: one of them stabbing one of them with a
4035.76s: [ __ ] bayonet one of them shooting
4037.32s: them with a p and they're just in
4038.84s: mustard gas so to your point and that's
4041.52s: still relatively recent right pillow
4043.16s: Wood's not not one so it's just it's
4045.60s: fascinating seeing the evolution of
4047.00s: warfare in that way yeah it's
4050.56s: uh I imagine it's got worse in a lot of
4053.32s: regards but it's certainly got better in
4054.76s: a lot of regards as well care like the
4057.84s: ability to treat people is massive
4060.48s: that's why we actually see Battlefield
4062.52s: casualties going down so massively but
4065.44s: yeah we see a lot more amputees coming
4069.24s: back now right because again the
4070.92s: survivability is so much so much greater
4075.60s: yeah to wrap us up I have one more
4078.44s: question looking
4080.32s: into the end of the year not predicting
4083.44s: anything but I'm curious is there
4086.16s: anything that you are looking forward to
4089.64s: seeing how it plays out into the end of
4091.84s: the year or are you just kind of going
4093.72s: along business as
4096.64s: usual I think in terms of market news
4101.88s: it's kind of continuation of what it's
4103.56s: been it's like all eyes on the FED um
4107.32s: the next earning cycle is is going to be
4109.88s: I think pretty important because clearly
4111.76s: we've got a fairly bearish sort of
4114.16s: General attitude right now I mean bonds
4117.84s: have gone down a lot stocks have gone
4120.60s: down a lot Gold's gone up you know
4124.40s: Tesla's earnings were terrible um but
4127.48s: it's sort of I think those this earnings
4130.72s: cycle is going to be relatively
4132.52s: important for driving that narrative
4134.84s: going forward if enough of the big
4136.40s: companies make money people will
4138.64s: suddenly be like oh well maybe you know
4141.48s: even in this interest rate environment
4143.24s: maybe things are not as bad as we
4145.16s: thought what did you think of the banks
4147.80s: that started reporting already because I
4149.32s: was actually surprised at how well
4152.32s: they're doing RIT
4154.24s: large banks are tricky financials are
4156.80s: always tricky because it's sort
4160.20s: of what they're doing part of their
4162.64s: business you don't really know what
4163.96s: they're betting on and what they're you
4165.92s: have to actually go through what they're
4167.48s: doing so like Banks can do really well
4170.20s: in a really bad period like typically
4172.84s: retail Banks do better at high interest
4174.60s: rate environments right well highish
4176.72s: interest rate you don't want 20% but you
4179.28s: don't want zero either
4182.08s: so financials are always tricky in that
4184.88s: regard I'm not sure they particularly
4186.72s: good Bell weather for the rest of stuff
4188.72s: but once the tax start having more I
4191.44s: mean we've already seen a few right but
4193.08s: once they start coming online more we
4196.40s: might get us something like Nvidia again
4198.24s: that'll shake things up yeah because I
4200.56s: was I was actually I do a YouTube live
4203.00s: session with the community on Mondays
4204.60s: and we were looking at the Wells Fargo
4206.76s: release out of curiosity I like looking
4208.28s: at banks for that exact reason because
4210.20s: if you go through their their documents
4212.16s: you can kind of see how they're making
4213.40s: how they're losing money and what I
4215.08s: thought was interesting about it is that
4216.88s: exactly I mean you already know this but
4219.16s: they're they're making good money in a
4221.68s: lot of different methods but then when
4223.20s: you look at the customer facing side of
4226.48s: business it's suffering like pretty good
4228.24s: and you can see it um mortgage rates
4232.00s: originations as you could tell they're
4234.08s: down like massively auto loan
4236.64s: originations down
4238.76s: massively that stuff's up a lot right
4242.68s: because you know they're charging now
4244.36s: for auto loans what like 7% in some
4247.00s: cases right but what are you getting
4248.88s: paid out on your bank account you know
4251.36s: that that spreads now enormous right
4253.72s: right I mean people are still getting
4255.60s: paid like 1% for bank accounts so having
4258.96s: like a 6% credit spread there is
4261.76s: huge right yeah it's it's interesting to
4264.76s: me to just kind of see the the behavior
4267.24s: of the customer side right kind of
4269.36s: continue building out what um at least
4273.16s: what that landscape looks for them
4274.48s: because this is I know that I said I was
4276.76s: wrapping up but you just jog my mind on
4278.64s: one other thing if you have a minute I'm
4280.68s: really curious your thoughts that I
4282.80s: again I know that you're not not an
4284.24s: economist but I know that you watch
4285.76s: markets you know way more than I do but
4289.60s: I've been surprised at how strong
4292.52s: employment is
4294.08s: held it has the performance of
4297.68s: employment struck you as any kind of way
4301.68s: yeah I actually don't pay any attention
4303.08s: to stuff like that like I'm always kind
4305.48s: of shocked when like some big number
4308.00s: like CPI comes out and I'm like why' the
4310.28s: market move so much you know half by
4312.76s: seven huh oh someone points out to me um
4316.28s: because I think things like that it's
4318.96s: like I I care what the market did I
4321.04s: don't really care why it did it for that
4323.24s: kind of stuff um because I don't have
4325.72s: any way of predicting what the Market's
4327.32s: going to do in advance so I just don't
4328.84s: really pay attention to it I think one
4331.24s: of the things though on a sort of
4333.20s: societal level with
4336.68s: employment it matters much more now what
4339.44s: kind of jobs are being created because
4343.12s: we're see a lot of shitty jobs coming
4345.68s: around you
4347.44s: know jobs paid at minimum wage jobs paid
4351.24s: where you're you're on like contracts
4354.68s: essentially that last a day
4358.04s: um so I don't think it's as predictive
4361.80s: of the broad Market the headline number
4364.92s: would have been as it was say 20 or 30
4366.76s: years ago when jobs involved working for
4369.44s: a company where you had like a whole
4371.48s: bunch of sort of contractual protections
4374.04s: and you got a certain you
4376.76s: know
4378.28s: standardized benefit package across
4380.56s: companies and stuff that just doesn't
4382.48s: really happen to the same degree anymore
4384.12s: so I'm not sure that number to me seems
4386.44s: like something that we're going to have
4387.92s: to kind
4389.32s: of sort of re-evaluate how we measure it
4392.44s: and I know you can break it all down
4394.00s: right but the headline number doesn't
4396.64s: right yeah and it's it's funny you say
4398.88s: that because I I actually fall very much
4400.60s: into the same camp where when I look at
4403.00s: un employment and stuff like that I kind
4404.68s: of have like two different parts of my
4406.24s: brain when it comes to markets some of
4408.12s: it is like what can I trade and then I
4410.00s: do have the other side is just markets
4413.24s: economy I find this stuff interesting I
4415.40s: really do I I find it very curious and I
4417.24s: know we've talked about this before you
4418.48s: think I'm [ __ ] absurd for having that
4421.00s: and you you don't necessarily share it
4423.52s: um but anyways yeah I mean people there
4426.48s: are a lot of people who find things
4427.76s: interest people like fishing you know
4430.84s: just because other people like to do
4432.40s: something I'm not going to say say that
4433.72s: it's impossible that you like it but on
4436.32s: the other hand I mean to me fishing and
4439.04s: reading the economic news are right up
4441.52s: there in terms of why I just cannot see
4443.60s: why someone would find either of those
4445.16s: things
4446.76s: interesting um yeah I think it's fair
4450.76s: well youan I know it's uh little bit
4453.12s: later on a Friday for you so we'll get
4455.16s: you out the door but um I I love talking

4460.00s: interesting perspective on things and as
4462.64s: always genuinely appreciate you taking
