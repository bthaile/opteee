0.96s: what's up outliers bit of a mixed bag
4.00s: out there today and the market is giving
6.48s: you a heads up that's what I see so I
8.84s: want to talk about two main topics today
13.08s: the first one is going to be the tech
16.00s: sector again so I specifically want to
18.16s: talk about smci and Nvidia and then we
21.28s: will take a look at some broader Market
24.20s: scans to help people look for some
26.52s: opportunities out here so and then at
28.72s: the end of the video I will poke through
30.12s: GameStop and see if anything's going on
32.16s: in there but let's Dive Right In so
35.64s: we're at a really interesting point in
37.68s: the market we can clearly see a
41.24s: downtrend starting in Q's whether this
45.76s: again stabilizes at some point is TBD
49.20s: but as I was recently talking about in
50.96s: the video yesterday this needs to be a
54.64s: higher low and right now it's not right
58.64s: now it's still trending down even though
60.52s: today was an up day it opened it gapped
63.04s: lower and then closed higher but it's
64.76s: still a down day
67.20s: so I think here we really really need
69.96s: this to stabilize if I'm to believe that
73.32s: this is the continuation of an uptrend
75.80s: versus the Assumption of a downtrend now
78.44s: when I look at it from a qualitative
80.12s: perspective I'm seeing broad changes
82.88s: going on right now so I'm seeing things
85.44s: like smci get downgraded I'm seeing
88.00s: things like Nvidia which is
90.72s: a disproportionate an alarmingly
93.12s: disproportionate proponent of the entire
95.48s: stock market at this point it's kind of
97.00s: wild if you look at the S&P 500 I was
99.72s: just looking at this on a live stream
102.12s: recently and it surprised me a little
104.64s: bit so if you take a look at the S&P 500
107.00s: so we'll just look at
108.28s: spy and we look at the look at this Tech
112.44s: is 30% now it used to be in the 20s and
116.20s: I thought that was heavy now it's over
118.56s: 30 and if we take a look Nvidia in and
122.12s: of itself is
124.04s: 5.7% then we have Microsoft and Apple
127.72s: which all of those are fairly well
130.28s: correlated what I'm trying to highlight
133.08s: is the overwhelming majority of the S&P
136.24s: 500 Falls clearly within the top 20
139.92s: Holdings within the top 10 specifically
142.12s: but the top three are an outsized input
146.64s: to this entire index like over 20% just
151.28s: for these three stocks so Mak sense
156.00s: they're massive stocks but it's almost
159.32s: like spy is starting to kind of become
162.64s: like another tech stock and that's just
164.96s: because of how successful Tech has been
167.28s: okay why does all of this matter it
169.44s: matters because when I look at the broad
172.28s: market now and I see Tech starting to
176.16s: roll over a little bit that gives me
180.00s: flashing warning signs not that we're
182.20s: crashing again as much as it would be
184.52s: better for the YouTube channel for me to
186.04s: tell you that the sky is falling and to
188.48s: go stock up on canned foods because it's
191.48s: all coming to an end I don't think that
193.76s: way I'm actually pretty optimistic in
195.44s: general I just look at this as a little
197.12s: bit of an inflection point and it's
199.24s: going to dictate where I want to put my
201.44s: money so when I look at something like
203.60s: this I'm not actually scaling in to a
207.44s: bunch of positions although I did add to
209.52s: the S&P 500 my Futures positions there a
213.52s: little bit I'm just trying to maintain
215.96s: some sort of broadc core exposure here
218.44s: because other than that I don't have
221.24s: exposure in q's and I don't have
223.40s: exposure in Russell which I kind of want
225.64s: exposure in both but I can't rationalize
228.28s: it so if we take a look at Nasdaq
230.52s: futures or again Q's whatever you want
233.44s: it doesn't look great it doesn't look
237.08s: terrible but this also isn't the place
239.00s: that I want to start scaling into things
240.84s: as I've talked about before I see a
242.32s: lower high I see a declining low that
245.16s: again we need to see if this gains of
246.64s: footing and starts to consolidate a
248.28s: little bit before like this kind of
250.60s: scenario but even if it starts
252.20s: consolidating we have to be ready for it
253.88s: to reverse and start finding its way
255.88s: back down again this is just clearly a
259.00s: point where things are not in a defined
261.88s: Trend and this is where it's really easy
263.96s: to get stuck and know you can get stuck
266.20s: in a few different ways the first way is
267.68s: you can get stuck by analysis par is
270.04s: looking at this saying I don't know
271.20s: which way it's going to go who does and
272.96s: then not putting anything on that's one
275.00s: way you get stuck the other way you get
277.20s: stuck is if you're trying to use some
278.76s: sort of momentum following strategy
280.52s: you're using moving average Crossovers
283.28s: and this is one of the most frustrating
284.60s: periods for those kinds of strategies
286.64s: because it's above it's below it's above
288.52s: it's below and as you're entering and
290.44s: exiting you're realizing p&l on those
293.12s: entrances and exits that impact your
296.00s: account so then the question becomes
298.40s: well what what looks good here well as
301.08s: I've already talked to you about before
303.16s: there's still a lot of stuff that looks
305.04s: good that's still continuing to hold up
308.52s: so XLF is definitely holding on here xli
313.12s: is starting to fall off xlp hitting new
316.24s: highs I just put on another position
318.76s: within this sector specifically for this
320.84s: reason xlre just hit another new high
323.36s: xlu just hit another new high XLV just
326.68s: hit another new high so I'm highlighting
328.92s: these same sectors this is like a week
331.60s: in a row now that I'm talking about
333.72s: these same sectors giving where at least
336.96s: I'm finding strength because even though
339.52s: the broad market and the Golden Goose
342.00s: that we typically would migrate towards
344.00s: being xlk is not looking healthy there's
346.56s: other stuff that's doing well so that's
349.60s: what I think from a broad perspective we
351.56s: need to figure out what tech wants to do
353.68s: here and I don't know if tech knows what
355.20s: tech wants to do here and until it
358.24s: starts to sort itself out
360.60s: that's not where I'm looking to start
361.84s: piling money and then from a broader
364.24s: Trend perspective we just had smci get
367.96s: downgraded after lackluster earnings
370.92s: again it actually missed on EPS
373.96s: estimates which is really not good it
375.96s: came in at 625 it was expected at 73 was
380.16s: that let's see 763 my bad and it then
385.16s: just got downgraded recently by Barclays
389.12s: which again and these analyst upgrades
391.32s: downgrades I don't put too much stock in
393.44s: it I guess to you know throw a bad pun
395.68s: out there but it does matter because
399.32s: other people use it it's that's kind of
401.28s: the funny thing about markets even if I
402.92s: don't really think much about the
405.56s: analyst upgrades downgrades if the
407.92s: market believes it then it doesn't
409.40s: matter if I believe it or not it has the
411.04s: ability to move the market and that's
413.16s: for a bunch of different reasons it's
414.80s: not always because oh we think the
416.44s: analysts are right it's because people
418.92s: that hold
420.16s: things like smci in their funds have to
423.00s: justify on a quarterly basis why they
425.20s: hold what they hold and then they start
427.08s: to look not great if they're holding a
428.64s: bunch of things that aren't being
430.68s: upgraded by analysts they look like
432.56s: they're deaf tone and I think it's more
436.52s: conservative for a lot of those kinds of
438.04s: entities to not hold something that's
440.44s: not being recommended generally and we
442.60s: can see that because I mean take a look
445.24s: at the follow through it's just been
447.00s: some sale volume now again sooner or
448.92s: later I think this will hit a level that
450.80s: people get interested in but we've had a
453.36s: precipitous decline a massive decline
455.96s: over 6 months from 1229 down to
459.24s: 400 massive massive decline so that
465.12s: doesn't look great and this impacts the
467.84s: broader Tech picture because people are
469.60s: looking at stocks like smci thinking
472.16s: this is part of the future this is part
473.96s: of how we're going to see AI servers
477.96s: coming out rolling out in the future
479.68s: which is supposed to be a giant giant
481.48s: profit driver I still think AI is a
483.76s: massive value driver but it takes time
487.04s: for these things to materialize and
489.92s: right now it's not there so smci is
492.80s: getting punished and then if we take a
494.60s: look at something like Nvidia which we
496.28s: already talked about this a few times so
497.64s: I'm not going to go over the earnings
498.88s: and stuff but this still doesn't look
500.32s: good either it doesn't look bad again I
502.80s: want to be very clear when I say doesn't
504.76s: look good A lot of people take that to
506.60s: mean the null and it's not binary
510.00s: I can have something that doesn't look
511.44s: good and doesn't look bad it just
513.16s: doesn't look like anything that I'm
514.32s: interested in which is kind of Invidia
516.32s: right now again from an investor
518.16s: standpoint further down this goes in my
520.64s: opinion the more attractive it gets
522.40s: because I still un bullish in Nvidia
524.00s: long term but that's I'm not an investor
526.44s: I'm a Trader and I cycle on shorter term
529.24s: time frames and I think and I need
530.96s: things to move in a time frame that
532.84s: makes sense for my thesis for what I'm
535.04s: trying to accomplish especially as an
537.72s: options Trader because options expired
539.68s: you can be right but wrong happens to
542.28s: all of us all the time so with this I'm
545.48s: also very very interested to see if it
548.20s: gains a bite here and starts to
550.32s: consolidate because if it does then I
552.52s: love that because then it looks like yes
555.04s: we have a slightly lower high but then
557.24s: we have a higher low which would then
559.40s: nullify this downtrend section here as
562.88s: compared to a lower low coming down here
565.24s: showing a continuation of this broad
567.52s: downtrend so we have to wait and see
568.80s: what it does so for me from an investing
572.16s: standpoint longterm doesn't look bad but
574.96s: from a near-term trading perspective and
576.84s: from an information integration in the
579.24s: markets and pricing it looks like it's
581.80s: still sorting things out and this is not
584.04s: where I would be massively bullish in it
585.84s: take a look at these recent five candles
588.88s: four of them have outsized sale volume
592.28s: this one close is 53% sale volume but
594.96s: still majority sale volume in the last
597.16s: two days have been just dumping it just
599.72s: winding
601.32s: so yeah I am really interested to see
604.84s: how Nvidia behaves here but right now it
606.72s: looks like Tech even from a general
608.72s: momentum perspective using two different
610.52s: oscillators here I spoke with I think
613.12s: the pro patreon members about the
616.36s: inclusion of mtsi this is just from a
618.48s: study that I read that I'm interested in
620.08s: tinkering with it so really you can kind
622.04s: of ignore this blue one for now I'm just
624.64s: putting it through some repetitions and
626.24s: observing it myself so I can come up
627.92s: with an idea to compliment the studies
629.84s: I'm running on it but mostly what I want
632.12s: to direct your attention to here is the
633.76s: RSI that I see and again there's two
636.28s: lines here you'll see the RSI itself and
638.48s: then you'll see a moving average for the
639.88s: RSI I like to smooth rsis so the EMA is
644.84s: downward sloping this is a shortterm
647.28s: 4day EMA and then the RSI itself is
650.48s: downward sloping below the
652.28s: EMA moving averages turning over on the
655.44s: short term so we can see that the right
658.68s: now the short term ma that I'm using is
660.80s: a 9 day sometimes this will be a 10day
662.84s: either or and that's downward sloping
665.84s: and so yeah I mean I just I don't love
667.96s: the way this looks even the longer term
670.12s: moving averages are starting to rotate
672.44s: down over some of the shorter terms so
674.76s: the 50-day already is starting to show a
678.80s: let's take a look yeah it's negative
680.20s: sloping already negative uh 0.4 so
683.36s: that's negative sloping 20 days negative
685.00s: sloping now bunch of negative sloping
686.84s: moving averages all this is to say right
689.88s: now it's going down I know what a
692.00s: revelation what a revelation but joking
695.84s: aside I do use these is an indication to
698.96s: help me understand like how much
701.08s: movement is behind a pullback you can
703.80s: get some ideas on like these sharp
705.80s: pullbacks that rapidly start ascending
707.96s: back the midterm long-term moving
710.48s: averages won't even notice them they
711.80s: don't care so it takes a little bit more
714.72s: of a prolonged downtrend or a resumed
717.20s: downtrend right so downtrend started
718.92s: uptrend Trend and then resuming to the
720.36s: downside here so far for these moving
722.36s: averages to roll over so between that
724.76s: the breath indicators the volume from a
726.64s: really simple perspective this is a keep
729.44s: an eyeball on it but nothing that I am
731.92s: overly eager to jump in front of right
734.32s: now although I am bullish in Nvidia long
736.72s: long term and the other thing I have to
738.16s: be honest with you is even with Nasdaq
740.04s: futures I was real real real close real
742.92s: close to pulling the trigger on starting
744.72s: to enter just little tiny position today
747.84s: because the BR part of me just
750.76s: instinctually feels that this is going
752.80s: to start resuming to the
754.56s: upside the main reason why I feel that
757.80s: is because I haven't seen any sort of
760.60s: big material change in information that
763.28s: would lead me to believe that the
764.72s: underpinning reason for the ascent of
767.76s: tech here is now reversed I just haven't
771.12s: seen that yet so I mean we'll see TBD
775.56s: little bit too early to come up with any
777.76s: significant conclusions from it yet but
779.60s: that's just the way that I'm initially
781.40s: looking at this all right so now let's
784.28s: rotate over and I want to take a look at
787.96s: GameStop and GameStop in my opinion here
791.88s: is generally following more of the broad
794.20s: market now the cool part is if we move
795.88s: into the 3month we're starting to drop
797.52s: off these really big candles so a lot of
800.08s: this will start to normalize and we are
802.44s: closing in on earnings what I don't love
805.08s: is the sale volume on the last two days
807.80s: because the overall volume is also
810.16s: pretty high so on the 3D we saw 11.35
814.56s: million shares with 83% sale volume and
817.92s: then the fourth were at 6.8 million
819.76s: shares with 99% sale volume so people
823.08s: just kind of unwinding today pretty
825.12s: meaningfully so this is a little bit of
828.68s: a resumption in my opinion of a sideways
831.32s: Trend nothing that I really care about
834.80s: near term right like it's continuing to
837.08s: oscillate sideways nicely between this
839.12s: kind of 18 and 3/4 and this 25 handle is
842.24s: something like that and it's just
844.36s: staying within that range that's okay
846.80s: and I think it's really just dependent
849.24s: on what Catalyst we get from earnings if
851.92s: any most people kind of let me know that
853.64s: earnings typically is a is a bit slower
856.20s: not not really that big of an event so I
860.08s: don't have that context as well as a lot
861.84s: of you do I I don't really trade
863.32s: GameStop for earnings too much but I am
864.84s: going to obviously pay closer attention
867.28s: to it for for earnings here just out a
869.52s: curiosity um one of the things I am
871.96s: really curious about is if we're going
873.44s: to start getting some information on
875.08s: this cash pile most people have said
876.76s: that they don't typically release a
878.20s: statement with earnings which I can't
880.16s: help but find slightly interesting
882.00s: because it's like well what's the point
883.32s: of earnings then other than reporting
884.68s: the financial performance of a company
886.48s: guidance is a big part of it so I'm
888.72s: hopeful that maybe we'll see something
891.44s: but I'm uncertain if we will we'll find
894.96s: out in just a few days here so let's
898.28s: pivot over and take a look at the
901.56s: options chain because I noticed this
904.40s: which made me kind of happy so we are
907.20s: now definitively at a 2 to1 ratio calls
910.48s: to puts which is actually very very cool
913.36s: because it's been around that but not
915.40s: quite 106,000 of those calls is in this
919.04s: front expiration 55,000 is in the next
921.68s: I'm expecting this next expiration to
923.32s: build out more because it includes
924.56s: earnings and I'm expecting people to
926.00s: want to play earnings but uh GameStop is
929.12s: continuing to really have a loaded front
933.00s: expiration which is kind of standard
935.96s: business at this point but you can see
938.60s: that the 18
939.84s: Ox are what I found is the densest
943.72s: expiration cycle so far so we can see
945.96s: that 17 Jan
947.88s: 130,000 calls 18 OCT is 151 the six seps
952.16s: is only 106 the 20 steps is 93 so I keep
955.60s: an eye on where I'm seeing this kind of
957.64s: centralization and exposure because the
960.84s: longer term expirations tend to build
962.68s: over time as more people are
963.88s: establishing these longer term positions
965.40s: very very normal but I can detect quick
968.72s: changes and that's again useful
971.44s: information for me and then the other
973.44s: thing I took a look at for my friends
975.88s: over at unusual Wales is we are seeing a
979.96s: little bit of activity in these 20 calls
982.44s: but these are all the way out in 2025
985.12s: and they're bigger trades but still not
987.60s: anything near the size that we had been
989.20s: seeing for a while we got a little bit
991.00s: spoiled seeing just massive massive
993.20s: trades week day day after day week over
995.48s: week for a little while so now we're
997.92s: back down to just essentially um four
1000.52s: line items above $100,000 so for me I
1003.88s: would call this quiet that's the the
1006.40s: over overwhelming sensation I feel if we
1008.72s: add the puts back in again this doesn't
1010.88s: really change most of the larger
1012.44s: transactions are on the call side right
1014.68s: now so that's about it we have a YouTube
1018.40s: live set later today for those
1020.12s: interested at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time and
1022.40s: then the gme live stream will be
1025.68s: Saturday at 500 p.m. Pacific time the
1028.04s: intent for this one is I started going
1030.12s: through old roaring Kitty stuff going
1032.96s: all the way through his Reddit profile
1035.80s: posts and I found some really
1037.24s: interesting things that just piqued my
1039.92s: curiosity much of them being really
1043.20s: Early Trades that were very options
1045.64s: heavy surprising to me so what I want to
1048.16s: do is actually take a much closer look
1050.60s: at what the trades looked like as he was
1053.32s: putting them on so that I can then
1055.84s: continue developing this fingerprinting
1057.56s: mechanism now one thing I want to
1059.52s: highlight is the reason why I'm trying
1061.40s: to ID and fingerprint his behaviors is
1064.16s: not actually because I have any
1065.68s: intention whatsoever of attempting to
1067.64s: copy him I'm not going to I am I've
1070.88s: always traded my own book but for me I'm
1075.12s: like studying a fascinating character
1079.24s: that does so many things that are so
1082.04s: irregular that I cannot help but be
1085.04s: super curious about the way that he's
1087.16s: using the products that I use on a daily
1089.44s: basis and to learn more about that I
1092.00s: just want to be clear because I think
1093.44s: sometimes people might spend a little
1096.28s: too much time trying to decode what he's
1099.20s: doing so that essentially they can copy
1100.84s: his every move and that's okay if that's
1102.92s: your approach like whatever works for
1104.20s: you works for you but that's super
1105.64s: dangerous because one of the things that
1108.08s: he does that you have to acknowledge is
1110.24s: the way that he sizes his positions and
1113.20s: unless you're able to like fully employ
1116.20s: what somebody is doing you're always
1118.12s: going to get a partial result because
1120.08s: I've seen after going through his old
1122.00s: post I've seen his portfolio go up
1124.28s: hundreds of percents but also go down by
1126.28s: the same so it the the main thing I try
1129.36s: to highlight with that point is while
1130.88s: I'm fascinated by studying the character
1132.92s: the background the methodology it's just
1135.12s: from a curiosity standpoint and I throw
1137.64s: that out as a cautionary because I don't
1139.36s: want people looking at what I'm doing as
1141.64s: if like oh yeah Eric's been doing this
1143.04s: for a while and he's trying to figure
1144.40s: this out so we can copy him so that
1145.64s: seems like a good idea that's not it at
1147.16s: all I'm just interested in it and for
1149.92s: you the best thing I could ever tell to
1151.96s: anybody is do what makes sense for you
1154.00s: you're the only person that can manage
1156.12s: your own finances in a way that makes
1158.08s: sense for you so whatever that is do
1160.52s: that if it's yoloing gme to the Moon
1162.44s: because you think that's right for you
1163.92s: go for it if it's saving your money
1166.08s: dollar cost averaging into an index ETF
1168.40s: and then having some speculative plays
1170.04s: out there great whatever works for you
1171.52s: works for you the important part is
1173.96s: understanding and always remembering
1175.24s: that you are the ultimate controller of
1177.20s: your destiny take control of your
1179.88s: actions what you choose to do own them
1182.32s: and do whatever you think is best for
1184.48s: you I will see you on the live streams
1187.00s: later be an
1188.08s: outlier catch you guys later
