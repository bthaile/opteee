0.00s: What a day. I thought it was going to be a slow week. There's a holiday, short trading
5.24s: week. And no, we have Warren Kitty coming out with a nine million 1000 share chewy position
12.44s: that we have to take a look at. We have a civil class action lawsuit that was launched
19.28s: and then subsequently unlaunched. We got to talk about that. Then we have to take a look
23.20s: at GameStop and the options activity going on there. So we have a full docket. Let's
29.52s: get straight into the details. We'll start with the easy stuff here. Let's start with
33.00s: these cases. And I find them very interesting. The very first thing to note is I'm always
37.48s: very upfront with the stuff I know about and the stuff I don't. I don't know anything
40.92s: about this. I'm just applying normal logic. So if there's any lawyers or anybody who know
46.24s: way more about this stuff, then I do I would love to hear you weigh in. But so far, here's
51.56s: what I'm seeing. And I will throw links to all of this in the notes so that you can look
55.36s: for yourself. It's very important to be able to fact check sources. So the 28th of June,
63.04s: we had a class action complaint filed against Warren Kitty by Martin Rativ and then other
71.32s: people. So obviously what they do is they pick somebody to represent the group and then
77.04s: they assemble the group later on. They find somebody that's been damaged that is representative
81.60s: of a larger totality of people. And this thing is 40 pages. There's quite a bit of detail
89.04s: and it's something to the tune of pump and dump stock manipulation. That kind of stuff
95.44s: we can essentially skip through most of it. And I want to hone in on a few things and know
101.08s: the thing I don't want to hone in on necessarily is our boy Martin's 35 shares to which obviously
106.72s: is very, very damaging to him. Plus then think a thousand dollars total here or something
110.52s: like that. So let's not hone in on that. And let's talk about the broader thing here, which
116.44s: is really interesting because when I look at somebody like DFV, one of the primary complaints
121.12s: from this is that they felt that he owed Warren Kitty owed other people some sort of heads
128.40s: up that he was going to unwind his position, which is crazy to me. The dude is an individual
134.04s: investor that's not even making any recommendations whatsoever. Yet you have people like Jim
137.64s: Kramer who jump on TV and I'm not I'm not trashing Kramer either. I think it's okay to talk
141.48s: about your opinion. But this is super frustrating when people try to essentially go for a money
146.48s: grab. And law firms like this are very, very smart. And what they do is specialize in kind
152.96s: of these contingent style cases where they're not collecting a bunch of money up front.
158.04s: They're trying to see if they have access to a pot of money that then they would get paid
162.16s: from that's probably even more than they could possibly make from one individual person
165.60s: up front. So there are entire law firms that specialize in this stuff. I have no idea
170.56s: if these guys do or don't. I don't know them from home the wall. But there are a few things
174.64s: I find fascinating about this whole thing.
176.16s: 28th of June, this thing comes out Friday. Then we see this today, voluntary dismissal,
183.72s: first of July.
186.44s: Hmm, crazy. Huh? You go through the effort of making this entire statement. You're grabbing
192.40s: some details again. This isn't like a ton of work for them. They have an entire staff that
195.68s: helps them. But that does take manpower and resources to build this. And they submit this Friday.
201.36s: And then Monday, they're like, nah, take back sees. Never mind. Didn't mean it. Very strange to
206.88s: me. Don't know exactly what that means. I do know a couple things though that this without
211.60s: prejudice component means that they can refile at some point. There might be some gamesmanship
216.32s: going on because here's what I do know. These aren't dumb people. They're not playing checkers.
221.52s: They're playing chess. So I don't know what this turns into. But this time frame is confounding to
229.60s: me. I don't know the exact reason. Maybe somebody else does. But again, just from a logical perspective,
235.28s: this doesn't logically flow if you go into this because there must have been some sort of injection
241.44s: of new information that led to this change. But we don't know what it could be something as simple
245.92s: as they might want to try to take it to another place outside of New York. It's very, very difficult
250.48s: to tell. But something changed and it was material enough that they wanted to pivot. That's what we
257.92s: do know. So enough on the case for now, at least because it's gone for the time being something to
262.72s: keep an eye on though, because that is just an interesting progression. Next up, let's take a
267.60s: quick look at some GameStop in general. First, and then we'll take a look at Chewie. And what might
272.80s: have happened there? Because when we take a look at GameStop, I'm not seeing a ton of options activity.
278.88s: Nothing that's necessarily jumping out to me as very novel. I'm seeing the same flattening across
286.80s: volatility for various expiration cycles. And let's take a look at Open Interest first.
293.36s: And I want to highlight a few things for you guys. The first one is there's still massive
297.84s: call skew on OI 721,000 calls against 464, 465. Give it to them on the put side. And then if we take a
307.36s: look at volume today, it's still very heavy. It's over 200,000, almost 300,000 calls traded
313.36s: against 128K on the put side. So very, very heavy there. For most of the volume we saw today,
319.04s: it's for the five July expiration. There's a couple interesting strikes that we need to take a look at.
324.00s: The 24's definitely saw a lot of action, the 25's. And then I'm going to guess these are the 30's. Yep.
329.52s: And then if we take a look at the Open Interest though, notice how all the red here,
334.48s: this actually is a lot of activity in the 19th July. So this looks like people kind of playing the
339.68s: front month, but then starting to establish positions in the next primary expiration cycle,
344.88s: which is what I would expect to see based on liquidity. Plus again, with the holiday this week,
349.04s: I just this is a tough position, I think, for any sort of expectation of super heavy movement.
355.28s: But if we take a look at the OI on the 30's, it's 16991. And there was 16712 that traded today.
362.64s: That's very interesting to me. I'm very curious what this strike will look like tomorrow. Because
368.08s: if a lot of that is opening positions, that would be very surprising to me. We're on a short
373.04s: week. There is not necessarily a huge catalyst, especially after the news that came out today. So
377.84s: there's wouldn't overly surprised me if there's a lot of exits. But if we take a look here and here,
383.84s: so if we take a look at the 24's and the 25's, the 24's have essentially 12k of OI, but 19k of volume.
390.72s: So there's definitely tons of opening positions there. And even more opening positions here at
394.56s: the 25's, over 10,000 calls opened. Now these are decent buys though. These are a little closer to
400.40s: the money, about a 30 delta, which again, you can check out that video on buying options,
404.24s: smartest for GME. People I continue to push that because I want to make sure the word gets out
408.64s: on at least having a model to assess how we're buying options as compared to what we've been
414.80s: seeing to a pretty significant degree of people being super cheap coming all the way out here
420.08s: to the 95's, which are now mid at 0.015. And we see 13,000 OI and 6500 transactions act there.
430.40s: They're less than a 0.01 delta and they have essentially no gamma and they're going to decay away.
436.80s: And like a day, I try to steer people out of those if possible just to get them to consider other
441.92s: positions essentially. But that's what's going on here in 5 July. Looking at 19 July,
448.16s: there's a huge position building at the 25's. This is up to 20,000, 21,000, almost at the 30's.
454.64s: There's 27,000 and at the 40's, there's 20,000. So this starts to become really interesting to me
461.68s: because it's not quite severe enough necessarily for a gamma ramp per se. But this is a lot of
469.28s: activity going on and it's expanding pretty meaningfully. Because if you have 20,000 OI and
474.56s: 8,000 volume traded today, assuming a good chunk of that will be buying, that starts to build up.
480.40s: And speaking of building up, let's take a look at time and sales because there are a few things
484.56s: that stuck out to me today at least. First, I want to take a look at
490.24s: 250. That's what I'm filtering by to start. So we're looking for slightly larger positions.
496.00s: And I see a few things that pop out at my eyes, not worrying about the put side so much. Don't
500.56s: care too much there. Like these 125's, 90's, these are far out of the money, more yellow styles.
506.56s: They're smaller positions in terms of amount of capital. I don't really care about that.
510.96s: But there are a couple in here I do care about. So like this here, this looks like somebody selling
516.40s: short calls against long shares covered calls. These are all sales and they're at the 22 and 23
521.76s: strike here in five July. So this person collecting a decent amount of money, selling premium.
528.24s: And again, my guess is these would be against shares because you can see where the underlying
532.56s: was traded when they put these on. The underlying was at 23. It was already over their strike
537.68s: when they established these positions. So this looks like they might want to get
540.56s: the shares called away and collect a few dollars doing it. That's what I pick up from that at
544.64s: least. Then we have this position down here. Where are you? This one is 20 September 22 call.
552.08s: There's 500 and there was 690 of these or I'm sorry, they traded at 690. There was 500 of these
559.28s: that traded at 690. And this I couldn't necessarily tell if it's a buyer or sale. I'm assuming it's
566.00s: a sale based on again, the broader context here, but it looks like people are starting to capitalize
572.32s: on a bit of the premium that's rolling in. The last thing I want to take a look at with you guys
577.60s: with respect to GameStop is as always, we'll take a look at the vault. This is for the out of the
582.56s: money options. We're seeing the puts start to jump up as per usual. The call sides a little heavy
587.52s: but nothing crazy. What's most interesting here is if we clear up some of those noise,
593.04s: you'll actually see a volatility traders great friend, which is all of this inversion right in
598.96s: here. It's kind of difficult to see, but typically we expect to see these shorter term time frames
605.04s: actually to trade above these. So the fact that these are all inverted cross and over one another
609.44s: is a tradable event from a volatility perspective. All right. Now we have to talk about this.
616.24s: The fact that Roryne Kitty is indeed not a cat that's great clarification. We see that on the
623.92s: 24th of June, we have a pretty meaningful position, which is 9,000,000 shares. So the question is
631.84s: where did this come from? Because if we take a look on the 24th of June where Chewie was trading,
640.00s: this is not a small position. So if I drop in Chewie and then if we go to the 24th of June,
646.96s: let's give them a fair price. Let's say that we could have got in at like 25, which would be low.
651.52s: I actually don't think we would have gotten a full fill there, but let's say we got in at 25
656.48s: and let's take a look at the position, which is 9,000,000 shares. It's $225,000. Now I also see
665.20s: some conversation that he might have gotten in at 27. I'm not sure myself. I'm using a lower
670.32s: planning factor here because it doesn't actually matter what it is because the point rings true
675.60s: even with the lower planning factor of 225. And let's take a pause real quick. We're talking about
682.00s: an individual retail trader that goes by the name Roryne Kitty that's slinging $225 million.
691.84s: How can that not be fascinating to everybody? It's crazy. That's absolutely crazy. That's what I'm
699.76s: talking about right now, but I am. Here we are. So this is nuts. So this position goes on and he
706.72s: obviously files. Now I would not at all be surprised if he's already out of this thing. I would not
712.64s: at all be surprised. I think he technically would owe an amendment within 10 days from here. I'm
718.48s: not positive on that, but I think he would owe an amendment. So I wouldn't be surprised to see
724.72s: another 13G come out in the near future that might place him out of this trade. But the other
730.32s: question is how did he get into this trade? Because we know based on his last position, he had like
735.20s: $6 million a little over six, like six and a half. Maybe something just shy of that. So that's not
741.36s: 225. Again, giving them the benefit of the doubt. So where does that money come from? That really
746.64s: is a pretty big question. And as far as I see it, there's a few scenarios. In the military,
753.76s: we use course of action, color, which is kind of what it sounds like, how something might go down.
758.96s: And there's a few of them. There's more than this to be clear, but we like to think in three,
762.88s: I'm a simple person. So I picked three that I thought were probably representative of this.
769.36s: So we have the scenario where he might have sold to close GameStop shares to then buy chewy.
776.80s: And we'll talk about that. Probably, probably not. Don't know, really hard to tell.
783.68s: He could have traded chewy options, use the proceeds from that to then buy chewy. Also,
791.52s: in a vacuum, it seems doubtful, not impossible. Then we have this third color where he might have
800.32s: traded other things or a combination of things to then clear up enough capital in order to
806.40s: establish the position of chewy. That's my expectation. Coa three is that this might have been
813.68s: several factors that joined together to build this position as compared to completely flattening
818.96s: GameStop as compared to turning six million into 225 million just trading options. I know Richard
825.92s: was talking about that in his video. And again, it's we're in kitty like you can't put anything
831.28s: outside the realm of possibility, but just trying to apply a logical thought process. It seems
836.32s: really difficult. And we'll take a look at the chewy options. I literally downloaded all of them
840.64s: from all of last month to see what kind of positions could have produced that.
845.44s: So first, let's talk about coa one and my hesitation with this one. And it's actually from the
851.44s: conversation that I had with Richard. He showed me this really interesting piece of his incredible
858.32s: excel sheet that he's been building. And this stuck out to me in that he's explicitly called
862.96s: this out to me as well to be clear. This over the course of the different positions we've seen him
868.64s: have from 2020 on, he's never decreased his position from what we've seen. 250, 10,000, 50,000, 200,000,
876.96s: I'm sorry, 50,000, 100,000, 800,000, 800,000, 1 million, 5 million, 9 million,
882.88s: haven't seen it go down. So it doesn't seem like he's in the habit of unwinding a bunch of his
890.72s: positions to get in. The other thing though that I will say when I look at this is there's some
895.60s: really big expansion, right? 10,050, huge, 50 to 100,000, big, 1 to 2, 2 to 8, like it starts getting
904.88s: exponential here in terms of sizing. So then the question is, did he actually expect to park all
911.28s: 9 million shares into perpetuity? That's tough to say because it does lock up capital for him
917.76s: and especially to be able to play something like this. So let's take a look then at the Chewy Options
923.52s: thing. And again, this is kind of a all encompassing document that I use. Let's start by looking at
932.48s: long calls, however, and this is looking for through all of last month. The first thing I want to
939.76s: focus on is this 5,000 lot position. A lot of people are talking about funny enough, this actually
944.32s: isn't the biggest position that went on. Sometimes people get too focused on the size, remember,
949.36s: it's not all about the size. And we forget the price that goes along with it in some of these
954.80s: instances. So there are actually positions with a larger total value associated with it. So if
961.84s: we take a look at that, we can see that there's actually some really large positions that went on
966.32s: here, essentially in this block. So if we then filter on these what we would call larger positions
974.40s: and let's say that we want to make sure everything we're looking at is at least greater than $100,000
981.28s: something like that. It limits our scope a bit to see what could have gone on here. Now if we
986.80s: take a look at these strike prices, I see the majority of them going on at 30, I also see 35, 25,
996.00s: those are the main ones that I'm keen into here. So then the question is, okay, maybe we got into
1003.92s: Chui early. But the problem is then if we look at some of these dates and we go back early, these
1008.96s: are the smaller positions. So then it's like, well, then let's see where we have sales of those
1018.16s: calls because he would have needed to unwind the position. We have to clear this filter because
1024.40s: it's using a positive integer. We have to see where he would have unwind those calls. So then
1031.28s: we would look at the short calls to see what would have happened after those long calls.
1036.24s: And we do see these 30s. This is one day after on that previous expiration. So that could absolutely
1044.32s: be something that happened because this is the 19 July. I got to find those 30s. This one.
1052.08s: 19 July, 5,000 of them for 99 cents. So then let's say that we got those for 99 cents, 5,000 of them.
1062.80s: And then let's flip back now to these short calls. Look at that same block, which would have been here.
1068.80s: I see in unwind, actually, we can even filter this by the 30s so that we can look at that exact
1074.00s: block down here. And let's look at that exact expiration. Is this? And let's see what happened.
1087.36s: Absolutely enough here to unwind that entire position, potentially. There's not enough money made
1096.32s: in my opinion. So we would obviously have to filter the stuff that went on after the original
1102.56s: date. So again, if we flip back to those calls, the long calls, you'll see that they were put on
1108.56s: what the 26 I said. So then looking at stuff that would have been put on or taken off after the
1116.24s: 26. So we have to go to the 27 28th. Those are essentially your choices here. And let's see total size
1123.84s: that would have came down. It would have been enough. But if we look at the total proceeds from the
1129.44s: positions, it's just not enough. It's less than a million dollars. And you also have to take into
1137.84s: account the cost to get into the position, which again, on that first block of 5,000 was like a buck.
1143.60s: So I am not convinced that we traded options here in order to establish the position. Again,
1151.12s: it's not impossible because maybe we were spread across more strikes or maybe we went into
1157.76s: additional aspirations. That's the problem with this stuff is, you know, we're kind of piecing
1162.40s: together what we can see, but it's not definitive. And there's always going to be holes in all of this,
1166.64s: which is kind of the beauty of it really as I think about it. But that does matter. What I'm highlighting
1172.24s: here is that there's nothing that'll vertically jumps out of me and says, yes, here's a clear buying
1177.36s: pattern. And that's essentially how I found his position so far. That's how I've ran with the
1182.72s: positions I've seen, at least in the options in the cycle is by going through this process.
1187.20s: So I don't see that. Where does that leave us? Probably a combination of things. There is a world
1194.96s: where he traded some short calls around his shares. You can make a bit of money that way. There's a
1201.92s: world where he could have sold some of his shares to probably get back into them. I assume,
1206.80s: but to start causing a potential wave. There's a good chance that he might have traded some other
1212.24s: things. I think that's less likely in terms of other products. My guess is it's a combination of
1216.64s: everything we've seen and talked about here so far. So as always, I am enthralled by this story.
1222.00s: Cannot wait to see what happens next. I think Richard and I are actually talking about doing a
1225.20s: live stream pretty soon because we're both just so fascinated and loved doing the investigative work
1229.60s: behind this. This is a puzzle. We both enjoy looking at quite a lot with slightly different
1233.84s: perspectives, which makes it even more fun to share perspectives. We will see what happens as
1240.24s: always being outlier. Let me know if there's anything I should look at. See you later.
