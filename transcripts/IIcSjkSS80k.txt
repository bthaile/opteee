0.00s: I'm going to dive into my absolute favorite directional trading strategy. This is the ratio
6.48s: diagonal, whether we want to trade ratio, call diagonals for upside ratio, put diagonals for
11.76s: downside. I've built a strategy over 16 years and it combines a handful of fantastic traits
18.56s: from options along with trend following strategies from equities and it is probably one of my favorite
23.92s: strategies for smaller accounts because of the leverage provided within. So we're going to walk
30.16s: through what it is, how they work and then at the end, an actual example with some best practices
34.80s: so that you can take all that information and hopefully build your own variation of the strategy
38.72s: that helps you make money. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers.
42.96s: A shout out to the Patreon family. You guys make content like this possible and if what I do
47.12s: helps you in any way, consider signing up. It helps me a lot. Okay, let's get right in. Why should you
52.80s: care about this strategy? Well, it's pretty simple. I got three things for you. The first one is
57.36s: leverage. This strategy provides leverage. The second thing is it's a defined risk strategy.
63.28s: So for newer traders, this kind of protects us. Even though we still need to apply careful profit
70.08s: and loss management, which we'll get into later, the fact that it opens right out of the gate
74.32s: to find risk is actually a good thing because sometimes newer traders come across different
78.96s: strategies. They don't fully understand and then they end up putting on risk that they don't
82.08s: even know is there and then they get ran over. And then the last thing, because of those first two,
86.56s: it's a pretty efficient directional play. So what do I mean by leverage? Pretty simple. I've
91.12s: recently had a trade on this as the example we're going to go through at the end, but I had six long
96.16s: call options that were deep in the money on RTX, which is Raytheon and the equivalent equity size
102.40s: for that position, the notional value would have been $50,000 actually a little bit over that.
106.64s: And then for the options positions that I put on, it was actually under $9,000. It was like
111.52s: $800 or whatever. So the point being is I was controlling the same size position in this scenario,
118.88s: but it was a fraction of the cost. Now you might be saying that seems really good. Why wouldn't
123.44s: everybody do that? Because whenever you trade options, we're adding some complexity. Options have
128.32s: an expiration date. So you can't just buy and hold it and then eventually hope it moves in your
132.16s: favor. There's some subtleties that get baked into this that are what actually allow us to
137.84s: identify opportunities like this. Leverages and free. So and that's a good thing. That means that
142.00s: there's opportunity for us within. So let's talk about the structure. It is super simple. The first
148.64s: part of the trade, the first leg is a long deep in the money option, a four DTE long expiration
156.96s: out. I use at the very least 90 days to expiration, the majority of the time it's between 180 and 365.
164.48s: So somewhere between six and 12 months is my normal, but you could go in as far as 90 days. I've
170.00s: done that previously, specifically if you're catching a trend that's in progress. And then that's
174.56s: the first leg. The second leg is we're going to be short, a near DTE option. This is pretty much
180.48s: anything within 30 DTE. I tend to focus on stuff that's maybe, you know, two weeks, three weeks,
187.28s: something like that. So these are kind of the two variations that we have. We have long call plus
192.32s: short call. That's the bullish variation. And then long put plus short put is the bearish variation.
199.68s: Pretty simple stuff here. So now let's take a look at some of the traits that I look for though
205.28s: specifically in the long leg, which is over here. Days of expiration already talk to you about the
210.32s: delta. This part is important. The reason why we go so far in the money is multiple vote. The first
217.12s: reason is it gives us the ability to move closer dollar for dollar with the underlying for those that
223.36s: don't remember delta, everything else, setter as purpose, everything else remaining the same delta,
227.36s: tells us how much the premium of an option is going to move for every one dollar move in the
230.96s: underlying. So if we have something with an 80 delta, that means for every one dollar move in
235.44s: the underlying, we're going to see 80 cents of that. Again, everything else remaining the same.
239.04s: The point being is by going further in the money, we move and we create essentially a stock
243.92s: replacement. The second thing is by going so far in the money, we actually reduce the
249.92s: extrinsic value of the options. I'll show you what I mean right now. Here we have RTX and let's go
255.44s: far out in time. Let's go out to this 16th. And if we take a look at a 80 delta plus long call,
263.12s: somewhere one of these two, you can see that even though these are 174 days expiration,
268.48s: you're only paying about a dollar per contract in theta in extrinsic value. So what that means
274.96s: is the theta decay on these options is actually pretty small. So if you take a look at theta decay
279.68s: here, it's negative 0.02. So each day they burn essentially to pennies. Whereas if we do something
285.92s: that's further close to DTE in time, closer to us, if you take a look, the theta now for that same
292.24s: option essentially is now negative 0.03. So the closer we get in DTE theta is going to pick up
298.64s: because all options have to approximate to either in the money, whatever their intrinsic value is
303.04s: or zero if they're out of the money. So that's why I like the long, deep in the money option. Now
308.80s: there are some trade-offs here because the further out in time you go, the deeper in the money you
314.40s: go, the more expensive it is upfront. But the way that I look at it is with the rest of the
319.68s: management that we're going to put in place, that expenses is kind of like a down payment. It
324.16s: doesn't just go away at the end of this whole thing. You actually are able to maintain a lot of
329.44s: the value that you're paying up out front. Now again, it could completely move against you and then
333.84s: all of that can change. But by going further in the money, further out in time, you are benefiting
339.44s: maximizing your leverage potential, dollar for dollar move, you don't need as big of a move to make
343.60s: money. And then the second thing is decreasing theta decay. Now if you notice, I do have a thing saying
348.00s: it can include kickers. Kickers simply put are far out of the money options. You could do it in
353.60s: the same expiration if you wanted to still decrease your theta decay. But essentially it's the opposite
359.28s: idea where we're going to pick up something that's further out in time. If I'm doing kicker options
364.96s: with something like this, I tend to pick something that is maybe 30 or 40 days out because the whole
370.72s: idea of a kicker option is we want to maximize our gamma. The idea is we grab something in addition
376.96s: to our base position that is now further out of the money and it would compound quickly. So that's
382.96s: the idea of a kicker option. And then for the short, it's super simple. Essentially, like I said,
388.00s: within 30 days, and our delta on the short needs to be above a critical strike. I'll explain what
393.84s: that means in a little bit. But essentially, this is how we place out. And I want to specifically show
399.76s: you what I mean by ratio. That's what this whole strategy is called, right? Ratio diagonals.
405.76s: Yes, I know that. Why ratios? Well, here's exactly why. This is a typical call diagonal. So this is
414.32s: further out in time. This is like 180 days out. But this is an at the money long call. And then in
420.96s: a shorter expiration, a short call, notice how after you go up a certain amount, there's actually
429.36s: upside risk. This is a problem. If I'm trading a ratio call diagonal, I am bullish. I want it
435.60s: to go up in this case. We run into a problem. If we're right and let's say we're super right,
441.92s: we're actually wrong. We now start to lose money. I don't want that. Yeah, no shit. So this is why
448.08s: we use a ratio. So in this case, as you can see down here, I'm simulating being long five of these
455.12s: style options that are deep in the money in short three. So in this case, we have unlimited
461.04s: upside potential. That is exactly why we use the ratio. If we add one more view to this, this is
465.84s: using the put side, right? So if we're long puts, we want things to go down. But again, we don't want
471.20s: to be wrong if we're right. What I mean by that is if we get the down move, we think it's going to
476.08s: happen. We don't want to be penalized if it's big. So this is exactly how we can maintain unlimited
482.48s: profit potential when trading these diagonals is trading them at a ratio. And by respecting this
487.84s: critical strike concept, which we're going to get into actually in just a second. So let's take a
493.84s: look at the strategy itself, how I think about deploying it from beginning to end. And then we'll
500.16s: get over to the example. So when we're talking about these directional strategies, it starts with
505.76s: your directional assumption, whatever that is. So you should follow whatever your process is to
512.08s: create a directional assumption. That's exactly what's going on here. Then when we're looking at
516.88s: something like sizing allocation scaling, this is pretty straightforward for me. I have a process
522.72s: for it where the first thing I'm going to do is look at my entire portfolio, all of the risk that's
527.28s: out there. I'm going to assess this opportunity that has come up and then I'm going to decide how
533.12s: does it fit into my portfolio and how much money does it get? So for example, in the RTX strategy,
539.44s: we're going to talk about in a second, that entire allocation was $10,000. That's the total amount
544.80s: of money that that position was allotted. Then we have what I like to call the initial outlay
550.88s: in scaling protocols. The initial outlay is how much of this total amount of money are you going
556.96s: to deploy upfront? For me, it's typically 80% or less. So if I allocate $10,000, my initial outlay
565.20s: will use 8,000 or less. And this gives me room to scale a little bit. And the trade off here is
572.64s: the more outlay you use upfront, the better the move is going to work. If it goes in your favor,
577.52s: the more it's going to hurt if it doesn't. And the less you have left over for scaling. And then
581.12s: for scaling, it can be really simpler or complex depending on however you conduct your directional
586.88s: assumptions. For me, I like to use support and resistant breakouts on a trend following approach
592.00s: so that I can both scale in when I'm right or as things are dropping, if I'm still strongly
599.04s: convicted, I will add limited scaling to the downside to average into the trade. This is a
605.84s: really dangerous approach. And I generally do not recommend adding any money to losing positions.
611.52s: It's bad practice. In some instances, I will. Most of the time you should avoid it in my opinion,
618.40s: because throwing good money after bad money is a horrible tendency for most traders and they just
623.44s: compound their losses. However, it can be a really effective approach to maximize a short-term
630.48s: pullback in a longer term up mover vice versa if you're bearish option selection. So we already
635.84s: talked to you about DTE. The way it works for the long options is the further out in time you go,
641.76s: the more time you have to be right, the lower your theta decay, the more expensive it is. You have
645.84s: to figure out which of those combinations make sense for you. As far as the short option, like I said,
650.40s: anything within three weeks I think is fine. Typically for me, it'll be two to three. We really want
654.88s: to expose ourselves to the aggressive portion of the theta decay curve. That's the whole point of
659.28s: adding those short options. They hedge a little bit of our risk, but it's also to make some money when
663.36s: things don't go exactly in our favor, which is exactly what my example is about actually. Then delta.
668.40s: Like I said, for the long options, I prefer 80 delta plus. The further in the money you go, the more
674.00s: expensive it is, the less extrinsic value you're buying. So that means lower theta decay and the better
680.64s: you're going to move dollar for dollar with the underlying, but because it's expensive up front,
685.20s: you're not going to see those thousand percent return on those long options. For me, that's not my goal.
690.00s: Again, it's kind of what you need to pay attention to. And then for the short options, we need to pay
695.28s: very close attention to our ratio and our adjusted cost basis and our critical strike, which I'll
700.88s: get into in the example. And then the ratio, this is super simple. You buy whatever number of long
705.76s: options that you want. And then when you're selling the short options, you are faced again with a
710.48s: trade off. If you sell at a higher ratio, so let's say if in this example, we are doing, let me grab
720.08s: this one. So in this example, if we're long five short three, we could be long five short four.
726.16s: We could even be long five short five. And in this case, because the delta's are set up
730.56s: properly, there's no upside risk on this first trade. What's the difference? Well, the more short
736.08s: options you sell against the long, the more money you're going to collect up front, the more upside
741.68s: potential you're going to give up if you get your move. So I tend to be about 50, 50 disposition
748.56s: meaning I like to cover about half, maybe slightly over half again comes down to your overall
753.84s: disposition towards the product. I have a recent trade actually in Apple that I'll throw a link in
758.32s: the video below that I covered a lot on our YouTube live sessions that talks a lot about this
763.84s: exact ratio concept and how I adjusted my ratio throughout the life cycle of the trade. But that
768.80s: is really the long and short of it there for the short options, the more you sell upfront, the more
773.36s: money you're going to collect up front, the more upside you give up, and then the inverse. And then
777.28s: the management cycle, once we enter the trade, so we find our long options, then our short options.
783.20s: I like to enter the long options with a single lot first to test liquidity.
788.64s: Liquidity is really important because we're adding a bunch of things that actually go against looking
794.96s: for liquidity. We're going deep in the money, which tends to decrease liquidity. We're going far
799.20s: out in time also tends to decrease liquidity. So it's super important when you're trading anything
805.60s: like this with ratio diagonals using the long options the way that I tend to structure them.
809.84s: You have got to check liquidity. It's got to be reasonable. If you have to struggle to get into
816.08s: the trade at a fair price, just imagine how difficult it's going to be to get out at a fair price
821.28s: because I do not take these to expiration. Essentially, what's going to happen? We have four total
828.08s: scenarios. Your PNL is hit, whatever your profit and loss is once you enter the trade. So again,
833.92s: I'll show you an example in a second on how I set those up personally, but that's the first exit
838.00s: criteria. The second criteria is the short option is out of the money. Then you can choose to add
843.84s: more short options. The short option is in the money. So if our short call short put falls in the
848.80s: money, what I like to do is sell some of my long options to cover the cost of the in a money short
856.08s: option. This does a few things. One, it makes sure that I'm realizing profits as I'm realizing losses
863.28s: because if we have a short in the money option that we need to close, if you just close this and
868.08s: continue the trade, there's nothing to say that the whole thing doesn't roll over and then not only
872.00s: do you realize a loss there, but then the rest of the position starts showing a loss. So I use this
876.32s: actually as criteria to help me start scaling out of the trade naturally. And then the fourth scenario
881.28s: that's not listed here, but is very common for me is if I enter a trade with 180 DTE, once I start
887.76s: getting within 90 DTE, I'm going to naturally manage it. Either it did or didn't hit my profit
893.28s: and lost targets and I'm just kind of trending sideways. I might reestablish roll further out,
897.84s: but I don't want to take those long options within 90 DTE more often than not. Let's get to the
904.72s: example. So this is the example trade in RTX and let me show you what that actually looks like.
911.44s: I entered here with the long options. I started selling short options here, here, here, and here is
917.52s: one I exited in total. You can see all of those movements here. I'm not going to run through it
922.32s: line by line with you, but I want to highlight a few high notes. The first one is this was a kind of
928.56s: a unique scenario for me. I typically am not super bullish here, to be honest, especially after a big
933.12s: drop, but because it was earning striven, short term price, mean reversion is what I was considering,
939.04s: and that's kind of what I was expecting to see. I didn't see it. And even though I did not see the
944.80s: move that I wanted, I still made money. That's why I'm using this as an example, because if you want
949.28s: an example of like a really profitable one, take a look at the Apple one that I threw in the notes
953.68s: below because that was just smooth sailing all the way through. Made a bunch of money there as
957.28s: a percent return on that trade because it did exactly what I wanted. This I think shows some of
961.84s: the power of this strategy because this was a bullish trade that I didn't get the move and I still
966.80s: made money. So this is again, just kind of my own version of the tracker. There's some issues with
971.44s: the math in here and it's just to make this show up as it is, but overall this turned out to be about
976.40s: a 7% return on invested capital, even though I was completely wrong. And these are the formulas
981.92s: that I was referring to before. The critical strike is this formula right here, and the reason why we
988.48s: care about the critical strike is because as this trade evolves over time, we do not want upside
994.16s: risk. This is what prevents it. The adjusted long call basis is exactly what we feed into the
999.20s: critical strike. As you can tell, the long call basis takes a look at how much our costs were for
1004.16s: the long options, the closed in the money short options, and then any closed long options to cover
1009.92s: the cost of the short options that were in the money we had to cover. So this just keeps pretty
1015.04s: close tracking of what the basis is as again, the trade evolves. And then the last one, we have the
1021.68s: number of lots we can sell. And in this case, you can either use a risk profile super simply from
1027.92s: the platform like this. If you were so inclined just like this, it'll tell you, you know, those kinds
1032.48s: of things, no problem. Or you can do the math, which essentially we just take a look at our long
1037.52s: option, our number of lots that we have out the delta, the current delta of those long options.
1043.52s: And then we divide it by 2.1 times the short option delta. This just makes sure that we have no
1049.28s: upside risk. So this was kind of a broad overview of the strategy. However, if you have any questions,
1054.56s: comments, concerns, let me know in the comments below. If you found this useful, also let me know.
1058.88s: And if you're interested, I can do a follow up video diving much further into detail on the
1063.28s: both of these. However, we're already 20 minutes in. I know this stuff can be a little bit heavy,
1067.68s: but these are literally the ways that I typically trade. These are some of my primary strategies.
1072.88s: So I hope this is helpful. Be an outlier. Don't forget like, subscribe, share, catch you guys later.
