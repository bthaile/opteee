1.28s: all right what's up everybody so we
3.60s: um back again we got chris here um
6.88s: we had a chance to catch up a little bit
8.64s: but um first off welcome to the channel
11.20s: again it's great to have you back
13.12s: thank you appreciate it um so we were
15.92s: talking just a little bit about
17.52s: some of the things that you've been
18.40s: working on and some of you know what
20.96s: you're doing
21.60s: with your your channel and whatnot
23.28s: potentially opening up the
24.80s: lens a little bit do you want to share a
26.56s: little bit about that
28.32s: yeah so i recently did a video
32.40s: called i need your help and i basically
34.32s: just
35.44s: talked i made a video just asking my
37.20s: audience you know what they thought of
38.88s: expanding the focus of the channel to
42.08s: stuff that's a little bit broader than
43.60s: options because for the past five years
46.08s: my youtube channel was strictly about
48.64s: options trading
50.32s: but over the years my personal
52.00s: philosophy has changed and i've learned
53.68s: a lot
54.24s: myself about all these other ways to
57.04s: manage your money and
58.00s: invest and i just wanted to
61.68s: kind of branch out and start talking
63.52s: about some of those things
64.96s: but not necessarily a hard shift away
66.64s: from options just
68.00s: you know still doing the options stuff
69.52s: but having the opportunity
71.28s: to make videos here and there about
73.84s: other things
74.56s: so i got pretty overwhelming responses
78.08s: and pretty much everyone was on board
80.00s: with talking about other stuff
82.24s: and i kind of had validation already
84.72s: from that because
85.68s: in youtube analytics you can see uh what
88.48s: your audience watches so it tells you
90.40s: your audience watches these videos your
92.24s: audience watches these channels
93.92s: and so my audience was already watching
96.40s: you know stuff that
97.36s: i would want to talk about so broader
99.28s: financial topics mostly within
101.60s: the investing niche maybe some some
104.16s: personal finance stuff here
106.00s: in there but it all kind of ties
107.76s: together but yeah i decided to
110.80s: just go ahead and broaden the scope so
113.76s: rebranding
114.64s: from project option to project finance
118.16s: and like i said a lot there will still
119.68s: be lots of options focused content
121.76s: and i'll still be doing live streams
123.28s: which will be options focused
125.68s: since i'll you know be sitting there
127.68s: with my trading platform open
129.20s: talking about positions i have on right
131.28s: and
132.40s: yeah so still going to be a lot of
134.16s: options stuff just
135.44s: you know going to start sprinkling other
137.52s: topics in
138.72s: that have been exciting me and that i
140.72s: definitely want to make videos on
142.08s: just to you know help spread the word so
144.80s: i'm really excited about
146.56s: just broadening the scope and having
148.56s: everything under under one channel
150.40s: because before i was
151.52s: you know contemplating having a second
153.20s: channel but
154.64s: as we know if you if you build an
156.64s: audience once on youtube and you have
158.32s: the audience on one channel
159.84s: and it's still similar content then it
163.20s: doesn't really make sense to make a
164.48s: second channel because you'll get way
166.64s: less views on those videos and then
168.40s: you know it's just not as efficient so
171.28s: and from a
172.80s: a focus perspective too it's really hard
174.64s: for me to focus on
176.16s: two different projects at once so i'm
177.76s: really happy that everyone was on board
180.00s: with
180.72s: broadening the scope and just keeping it
182.40s: all on one channel so long as there are
185.20s: playlists separating at all so people
186.96s: can navigate and find everything easily
188.96s: so yeah super excited that's awesome to
191.44s: hear honestly just because
192.80s: i i think one of like the things i have
195.44s: found most valuable
196.80s: same as you i'm 30 kind of going through
198.72s: a similar
199.84s: series of learnings and a
203.44s: big thing that i've started picking up
204.88s: is just the value of looking at
207.12s: other business ventures and it can be as
209.36s: simple as
210.96s: like we were just talking about like if
212.48s: you wanted to trade and then maybe have
214.24s: some
214.64s: interest rates or something like
216.48s: something really simple that you were
217.76s: trying to earn a risk free return on but
219.68s: we're we'll get into that in a minute
221.28s: you know just that's starting to look a
222.48s: little different
223.76s: it's helpful to find other things to
226.16s: start looking at and
227.28s: include into your overall i like to call
229.28s: just an overall wealth portfolio
230.96s: so um i'm actually really excited to see
233.52s: some of the stuff that you talk about
234.72s: it's something that
235.84s: i think especially digging into things
237.60s: like real estate ton there's just a ton
240.00s: of really really great information out
241.76s: there for traders
243.04s: that might want to be dabble and stuff
244.72s: like that so i think
246.40s: yeah i think it's really cool that
247.68s: you're kind of opening that that band a
249.84s: little bit and then the other really
251.12s: neat thing i think people get out of
252.56s: that is
253.52s: they get to go along that experience
255.28s: with you right and kind of see
256.64s: the stuff that you're currently
257.76s: interested in while you're interested in
259.28s: it i think there's a ton of value in
260.48s: that too so
262.00s: super super cool to hear glad glad to
264.64s: hear that everybody was really
265.60s: supportive of that because i mean
267.04s: honestly i'm definitely looking forward
268.56s: to seeing your perspective on some of
270.96s: that stuff
271.84s: it was a big relief for me as well yeah
274.16s: i as soon as you said the two channels
275.92s: thanks i mean
276.64s: i'm i'm obviously a small channel i've
278.08s: got like 5 000 subscribers but still
280.56s: i can only imagine you know trying to
282.56s: like apply that effort
284.00s: equal effort to run another channel just
286.16s: as get like just as well man that would
287.84s: be exhausting yeah so
289.04s: uh yeah that's that's really good to
290.88s: hear so
292.40s: we were actually just kind of you know
294.16s: having a conversation and i
295.84s: shared a little bit of what we were
297.20s: discussing and it pertains to kind of
299.44s: like the current markets
301.04s: and how things are currently situated
303.28s: what we're seeing
304.24s: as traders and investors one of those
307.28s: things that we were talking about was
310.56s: some issues or really just a change of
313.52s: paradigm really as it pertains to
316.64s: returns on risk reinvestments or lower
319.04s: risk investments stuff like that
320.56s: and you were sharing your perspective on
322.32s: that so i actually thought it'd be cool
324.56s: to dive into that a little bit
326.00s: further and kind of see what you're
328.08s: seeing as it pertains to that and
329.84s: you know just where we're going from
330.80s: here well yeah i'd love to talk about
333.44s: that
334.16s: um so i'm working on a video right now
336.24s: that should be out
337.36s: this week so this is the week of the
340.08s: 26th
341.36s: um so yeah this video will be out this
343.84s: week but the premise of the video is
345.76s: talking about how
347.28s: this is a tricky investment environment
350.48s: for investors because typically you have
354.56s: different choices of investment products
356.96s: with
357.68s: lower risk lower returns to higher risk
360.24s: higher returns so lower risk lower
361.92s: returns
362.96s: would be something like a a cash
365.92s: position would typically be your safest
367.76s: position
368.96s: savings account would be basically cash
371.36s: but it's still
372.24s: it's earning you a little bit of return
374.24s: then you have
375.28s: government bonds or different types of
377.52s: bonds it could be corporate bonds
379.36s: um and then you go to the higher risk
381.04s: spectrum which is
382.96s: stocks uh maybe real estate you could
385.12s: consider higher risk
386.56s: and then you have stuff right now in the
388.48s: new age world like cryptocurrencies
390.80s: including you know bitcoin ethereum or
393.84s: dogecoin if
394.80s: if you're so inclined but the
398.00s: interesting thing is
400.16s: right now on the lower the lower end of
403.52s: the risk spectrum
404.72s: you actually you can't get positive
408.16s: real returns so for those who may not
411.12s: know
411.84s: real returns are when you take the
414.16s: return
414.88s: of something and then you subtract
416.40s: inflation so
418.16s: if inflation is two percent excuse me
422.32s: if inflation's two percent and you earn
425.60s: three percent
426.80s: then you're said to have a positive real
428.80s: return of one percent
430.80s: and if inflation's two percent and you
434.00s: earn zero percent so like if you have a
435.76s: cash position that earns zero percent
438.16s: but if inflation's two percent you have
440.48s: a negative real return because your
442.48s: dollars
443.52s: have actually lost purchasing power so
446.32s: your dollars
447.44s: next year if prices go up which is
450.48s: inflation
451.60s: then your dollars that didn't grow at
453.84s: all can buy
454.96s: fewer things and so that would mean you
456.96s: have a negative real return
459.20s: so it's it's a tricky environment right
461.52s: now because
462.96s: um wealthfront actually just sent me an
465.36s: email the other day and they said we're
466.96s: dropping
468.00s: the interest rate on your high yield
469.92s: cash account okay from
472.12s: 0.35 to 0.1
476.40s: so if you have ten thousand dollars
479.44s: in a wealth front cash account then
483.60s: you're going to earn nothing you're
485.68s: going to earn like 10 bucks
486.88s: a year which is you know and if
489.36s: inflation as i said if inflation
491.20s: is expected to be two percent which has
493.76s: kind of been the federal reserve's
495.20s: target that's the higher end of their
496.56s: target
497.60s: inflation is two percent and you earn
499.92s: 0.1 percent in your cash account
502.40s: or your savings account then it's the
504.72s: same problem i discussed before
506.40s: where you have a negative real return
508.40s: where prices are rising faster than
510.80s: that investment position and you see the
514.08s: same thing if you look at
516.16s: a 10-year bond so the 10-year bond yield
518.48s: is less than two percent the 30-year
520.48s: bond yield is
521.76s: just over two percent but the thing is
526.24s: if the 30-year bond yield is at 2.2
529.36s: percent
530.16s: and inflation is expected to be percent
533.36s: or that's the target
534.48s: then you're barely you know you're
536.40s: barely keeping up with inflation
538.40s: in that position but right now we are
541.60s: kind of in uncharted territories because
544.48s: we have never seen so much money
546.84s: printing in the history of
550.16s: you know of our country so if you look
552.08s: at the the
553.36s: chart of the money supply it's literally
555.44s: like it's a straight up line
557.52s: over the past year and
560.80s: naturally if you create more units of
564.00s: something
564.88s: it dilutes the the value of each unit
568.16s: that
568.72s: currently exists and so i think right
570.96s: now there's a lot of
572.08s: high inflation fears so we're not
573.60s: talking about two percent inflation
575.36s: that's kind of the
576.64s: normal world expectation people are
579.36s: worried about you know three
580.80s: four five percent maybe even higher and
583.52s: so i think if you're an investor
585.44s: and you're looking at a 30-year bond
588.00s: which has a
589.52s: two and a quarter percent yield and
592.00s: you're expecting inflation to
593.36s: potentially go higher than two percent
595.68s: then you're not going to comfortably put
597.44s: your money into that position because
599.44s: number one you're getting paid your
601.60s: coupon payments back in u.s dollars and
604.00s: then
604.80s: at the end of that 30-year term you're
606.32s: getting your principal back in u.s
608.00s: dollars
608.64s: and if you don't trust that the u.s
610.40s: dollar is going to
611.84s: hold its purchasing power then you're
614.64s: not going to comfortably
615.84s: put your money into that position and so
619.04s: with the lower the lower end of the risk
621.76s: spectrum basically off the table
623.68s: in terms of getting positive returns on
625.68s: your investments
626.96s: you have to look to higher risk assets
629.12s: such as stocks
630.40s: we could say real estate's in there um
633.72s: cryptocurrencies or something like art
636.88s: if you know you're you're savvy and you
638.88s: know how to invest in art
640.64s: but you basically are forced into these
642.40s: higher risk assets and i think
644.64s: when we talk about the markets you're
646.80s: actually seeing
648.08s: that fear and you're seeing that
650.00s: firsthand
651.12s: because we were talking about this
653.36s: before if you look at
655.36s: where the s p 500 was at the high before
658.72s: coronavirus and then you look at where
660.48s: it is now
662.40s: it's over 20 percent higher than it was
665.92s: when the whole
666.96s: global economy was open and before the
669.52s: corona virus started
671.04s: and now the world economy is not yet
673.36s: fully reopened
674.72s: but the stock market is 20 higher than
677.36s: it was
678.24s: before all the mayhem started and so i
680.72s: think that's
681.68s: partially a function of people not
684.24s: having
685.04s: any return potential in the lower risk
687.60s: assets
688.40s: and so they're basically being forced
691.04s: into the higher risk assets which is
692.48s: causing
693.20s: the prices to increase and the same
695.28s: thing with the real estate market i was
696.80s: looking up some data today
698.64s: and from january
702.08s: 2019 to january 2020
705.52s: based on the housing index that i was
707.44s: looking at
708.72s: um the price is their price index
711.20s: increased like six percent
713.04s: from january 2019 to january from
716.08s: january
716.88s: 2020 to january 2021 that same index has
720.88s: increased
722.00s: 12 and i've experienced this firsthand
725.12s: because i've been looking at
726.24s: the real estate market in denver over
727.84s: the past few months and
729.68s: i actually started working with a
731.52s: realtor and i got connected
733.20s: with the mls system so i could see all
735.52s: the new listings come up and there were
737.28s: there were a couple properties that i
738.72s: favored it and
740.72s: they went off the market in like five
742.96s: days and they went
744.08s: for 50 to 75 000 over the asking price
748.24s: yep and so i think there's just
752.40s: there's a ton of demand to get out of
754.40s: cash and
755.84s: any cash denominated investment product
758.32s: like i
758.96s: described earlier with you
762.24s: pushing up asset valuations across the
765.20s: board
765.60s: on the higher end of the risk spectrum
768.08s: so
768.88s: getting back to what i think about
771.12s: markets i'm actually
772.16s: bullish on the stock market i'm actually
775.28s: bullish on
776.32s: pretty much everything that's not cash
778.56s: based on the monetary policy that we're
780.40s: seeing
781.12s: i think for as long as we have
785.04s: as long as we have the money supply
787.20s: increasing as quickly as it is
789.28s: and rates are extremely low like
792.48s: mortgage rates are at historic lows
794.80s: and you know loans you could take out
797.60s: you can take out loans and you can buy
799.04s: that house
800.88s: the the payments on that debt are so low
804.72s: and it's actually a strategic thing to
806.72s: take out debt
807.84s: right if you think the the currency is
811.20s: going to lose value because
813.20s: inflation kills debt so i don't want to
815.36s: be a doomsayer about
817.20s: hyperinflation and say that we're right
819.84s: behind
820.88s: venezuela's footsteps for those who
823.12s: don't know venezuela saw hyperinflation
825.20s: where
825.60s: you know their currency basically it
827.92s: loses 90
828.96s: of its value every few months
831.12s: essentially it was crippling yeah
832.80s: yeah so that's that's what happens in a
836.32s: hyper-inflationary environment because
837.92s: people lose faith in the currency
840.72s: and if that's the case then people
843.52s: aren't going to accept
845.28s: that currency has payment or they're
846.72s: going to accept way higher
848.96s: units of that currency so right but
851.68s: anyways i don't want to be a doomsayer i
853.28s: don't want to say that
854.32s: hyperinflation or a venezuela type event
856.64s: is coming for the u.s
858.64s: but i think that right now based on the
862.00s: monetary policy it
863.52s: is creating rapid increases in all these
866.56s: asset prices
867.52s: so as long as we have a monetary policy
869.92s: like we do right now
871.20s: then i am bullish on high risk positions
874.40s: so i'm bullish on stocks
876.40s: so what are some changes in multi and
878.56s: monetary policy that would make you
880.48s: change your thoughts well if they
884.48s: so right now we're in a an easy money
887.60s: monetary policy
888.88s: which basically means that they're just
891.28s: you know they're printing as fast as
892.72s: they can
893.60s: i think if they if they said that we are
896.56s: going to
897.68s: start contracting the money supply then
900.48s: that would change
902.24s: you know that would change the minds of
903.36s: a lot of investors that also
906.24s: we would have we would see higher
908.24s: interest rates because of that too
909.68s: because there'd be less
910.80s: money in circulation um
914.16s: but yeah i don't i don't i don't know if
917.52s: we're gonna see that
918.48s: at least in the next few years
922.16s: it seems it's i'm glad you bring that up
924.40s: honestly because that like
925.68s: that's the one thing i've been telling
926.96s: people that i'm just watching like a
928.72s: hawk whenever i see
930.00s: any of the fed talking about money is to
931.76s: see how they're talking about printing
933.12s: money everybody's curious about interest
934.32s: rates and stuff rightfully so
936.00s: but i do think there's a lot of
936.96s: predictive capability in just
939.12s: production of currency one of the one of
941.92s: the things that
943.04s: um i also was talking about i was i
945.84s: forgot what uh
946.64s: what the video was but it was
947.76s: essentially just talking a little bit
948.80s: about the fed and
950.00s: how they've been and i'm curious to hear
952.96s: your thoughts on this but for me
954.64s: it seems like we've been in what at
957.84s: least
959.04s: eight quarters now almost where like the
961.60s: fed has been
962.72s: talking about doing something and it
964.96s: seems like they're
966.40s: kind of backing it up they're continuing
968.40s: on what they said that they were going
969.68s: to do
970.48s: whereas there definitely has been a
972.00s: period of time before that and i shared
973.76s: a couple examples in the video where the
975.36s: fed was kind of talking one thing and
976.96s: then
977.60s: pretty quickly down the line something
979.12s: else came out that just
980.96s: you know shocked a few people in terms
983.12s: of the overall approach
984.80s: so i'm just curious what are your
986.48s: thoughts in terms of
987.92s: the the fed's consistency lately as it
990.40s: pertains to you
991.36s: you know we're saying we're going to do
992.80s: this and this is what's going to happen
995.04s: sort of thing
997.12s: it's an interesting question and i have
999.28s: to i have to say that i'm not
1001.52s: by any means a macro economic expert
1004.56s: but i have been trying to get into more
1006.32s: of this and understand how all the
1007.68s: pieces fit together
1009.44s: but the main concept that i've kind of
1012.40s: bit into recently is just the concept of
1015.68s: if you rapidly inflate the supply of
1018.88s: money
1019.60s: there there aren't going to be
1022.64s: there are going to be consequences like
1024.80s: yeah what they're saying is
1026.16s: we can we can just inflate the money
1028.80s: supply and we can create
1030.64s: all of these additional units of us
1032.32s: dollars and there's not going to be any
1033.76s: negative side effects which
1035.84s: you can't you can't get you can't get
1038.88s: something for nothing so there are there
1040.80s: are going to be
1041.84s: side effects and
1045.60s: i just i think to answer your question i
1048.56s: don't
1050.08s: i don't see them reversing course
1052.08s: abruptly because
1054.24s: they've already gone down this path far
1056.40s: enough and a lot of people in this space
1058.48s: that are much smarter than i
1060.00s: have said that they
1063.36s: they basically have their corner they
1065.44s: have no easy way out of this and they
1066.96s: have to basically
1067.92s: continue on this path
1070.96s: because if they did reverse course
1072.80s: abruptly
1074.00s: that would you know that would send
1076.40s: shockwaves through the whole
1077.52s: financial system yeah and i think it's a
1080.48s: it's
1081.04s: completely accurate and something that
1083.36s: whenever i
1084.32s: i always like to read the minutes and
1086.32s: and some of um
1088.32s: some of what i was picking up is it it
1090.16s: really doesn't seem like
1091.36s: they're they even identify viable
1094.32s: alternatives for what they're doing
1095.92s: so i think that that kind of just
1097.04s: reinforces what you were sharing you
1098.48s: know just in terms of this is kind of
1100.24s: what they think is the best path and
1102.40s: that's why
1103.52s: i'll have some people come up and just
1106.40s: have conversations about the
1108.00s: the fed's history in terms of continuing
1111.44s: to
1111.84s: execute the policy as stated and that's
1115.04s: more or less
1116.00s: i i think the the punch line here is
1118.16s: that they just
1119.44s: it doesn't seem like there's a lot of
1120.56s: really great alternatives for them to
1122.72s: drastically switch gears too so it's
1125.52s: like
1126.00s: yeah it's interesting to hear um you
1128.72s: kind of seeing the same thing
1130.48s: so on that same vein we're kind of just
1132.40s: talking about the markets and some of
1133.76s: the layout on on what we're seeing one
1135.36s: of the questions that i got in was
1138.48s: what are some of your kind of preferred
1140.16s: strategies for the current market for
1142.48s: the current environment i know
1144.16s: for myself it's definitely been doing my
1147.44s: best to
1148.00s: to find opportunity where i see it
1149.68s: luckily there's been enough
1151.36s: um volatility and things like index etfs
1154.24s: in a lot of instances so i can kind of
1155.84s: stay in a bigger product but still
1157.20s: collect what i need to collect primarily
1158.96s: sell premium like a lot of people
1160.80s: yeah um but curious to see you know
1162.64s: what's been working for you
1164.80s: so the main strategy that i've been
1168.40s: using
1170.00s: for the past like six months i would say
1173.68s: this this started last year too when we
1176.72s: were
1177.68s: deeper in the correction and kind of
1179.76s: ascending out of the
1181.04s: the depths of the correction is i
1183.60s: started
1185.60s: i started buying out of the money calls
1188.16s: in the furthest
1189.60s: expirations that were available and i
1192.16s: was doing this
1192.96s: in select names and i've actually done
1194.96s: it in the s
1196.08s: p 500 as well but
1199.60s: the whole backdrop for that decision was
1202.32s: first of all
1203.68s: at the trough of the stock market
1206.08s: correction and when we started to bounce
1207.92s: off of the lows
1209.36s: in march i was assuming that we were
1213.04s: that we were just bouncing and we were
1214.56s: going to see another
1216.00s: cratering to the downside and so i
1218.16s: started betting against the market
1219.84s: pretty heavily
1221.36s: and i started to burn a lot of money
1224.16s: very quickly because
1226.16s: i was paying all this money for these
1227.84s: downside
1229.20s: profit positions such as buying upside
1232.32s: vxx
1232.96s: calls so vxx is a volatility product
1236.32s: and as the market goes down the vix
1239.60s: index will typically go up and the vix
1242.00s: index going up will bring the futures
1243.76s: with it
1244.40s: and vxx tracks the vix futures so vxx is
1248.40s: essentially going to have very similar
1250.24s: movements to vixx with
1251.68s: some nuances but i was buying out of the
1254.64s: money calls in vxx with the assumption
1256.80s: that
1257.12s: we were going to see another deep
1258.72s: correction to the downside
1260.56s: probably even lower than the lows that
1263.04s: we saw previously
1264.96s: and so the market kept going up
1268.24s: and this was when the fed started to
1271.04s: come out and
1271.92s: you know started saying that they were
1274.16s: gonna put all this money into the system
1276.72s: and the markets responded very favorably
1278.56s: to that and now i understand why is
1280.32s: because they basically were
1282.08s: they they call it the fed put so the the
1284.08s: federal reserve was
1285.20s: kind of the backstop on the market right
1287.28s: and they would come out
1289.20s: once a week and every time the market
1290.96s: was down they would come out and they
1292.40s: would say something
1293.84s: that would re-encourage investors and so
1296.48s: i realized that
1298.24s: it was probably a foolish game to bet
1300.48s: against the market
1302.24s: and i completely flipped the cards i
1305.04s: said i'm not going to bet against it
1306.88s: i'm going to you know i'm going to be
1309.60s: bullish in this
1310.48s: environment just because it's very clear
1313.36s: that
1314.72s: what the government says what the fed
1316.32s: says that's what the market's going to
1318.24s: follow and
1319.60s: it's more likely that they're going to
1320.96s: come out and say stuff to you know sued
1323.12s: the market as opposed to
1325.28s: lead to more chaos in the markets and so
1327.60s: i completely flipped the cards
1329.52s: and i also started doing research on
1331.60s: some individual stocks
1333.12s: and i found some compelling cases for
1336.88s: tesla so tesla was one stock that i
1339.92s: bought out of the money calls super far
1342.40s: out expirations
1343.68s: just to give those positions a lot of
1345.84s: time to work out
1346.96s: wasn't like i was doing you know short
1349.52s: term
1350.24s: right you know seven day bullish calls
1353.28s: so i was going far out in time to give
1355.36s: myself time to be right
1357.60s: and i was choosing kind of crowd
1360.08s: favorite stocks such as tesla
1362.08s: i also did one of these positions in
1364.88s: nvidia
1365.76s: i had one of these on an amazon which i
1368.72s: got out kind of prematurely but i also
1370.80s: did the same strategy in
1372.32s: spy which is the s p 500 etf
1375.76s: so i basically put on all these long
1377.28s: call positions
1379.12s: out of the money so i got a lot of
1380.72s: leverage so i could buy a lot of
1382.16s: contracts with
1383.92s: the same amount of money that you could
1386.24s: buy with um
1387.76s: you know if you bought an in the money
1389.52s: contracts right
1390.88s: so if you buy and in the money you're
1392.16s: gonna pay way more for it
1394.32s: but with that same dollar amount if you
1396.16s: go out of the money you can buy more
1397.84s: contracts and therefore get more
1399.12s: leverage and that's what i wanted
1400.88s: because i you know since i was so far
1403.12s: out in time
1404.08s: i figured that there there was a pretty
1405.68s: good chance that if this trajectory
1407.68s: continued
1408.72s: then those calls were going to make a
1410.80s: lot of money right
1412.00s: i had i didn't anticipate the extent
1415.28s: of the upside movement that we saw but
1417.76s: that strategy worked out
1419.92s: really really well in the coming months
1423.44s: and then i started to actually build on
1425.68s: that strategy so instead of just
1427.92s: buying out of the money calls and
1429.60s: sitting on it i actually
1431.52s: realized that if you get to a certain
1434.96s: profit point not a specific profit
1436.72s: percentage
1437.52s: but if you're right on that play and
1439.68s: your long calls that you purchase
1441.20s: become really profitable then that means
1444.08s: you can find
1444.96s: higher strike call options that are
1447.36s: trading for the same amount of money
1449.44s: if not more than you initially paid for
1452.16s: those long calls
1453.20s: so for example if i buy an out of the
1455.52s: money apple call for ten dollars
1457.60s: and it goes to twenty dollars then i
1460.16s: know there's a
1461.28s: call option at a higher strike price
1462.88s: somewhere that's worth ten dollars
1464.64s: right and so if i can sell or short
1468.56s: a call option against the one i already
1471.28s: own but i can short it for the same
1473.28s: premium that i paid initially for the
1475.12s: long call
1476.00s: or even collect more then i create a
1478.08s: risk-free trade
1479.12s: right and so that was a no-brainer for
1480.96s: me and that's become my favorite
1482.32s: strategy
1482.96s: is to essentially buy call options
1486.00s: you can do this on the put side as well
1488.32s: but
1489.28s: if you're bullish if you have a bullish
1491.20s: assumption you buy call options
1493.84s: and if you're right about that
1496.00s: prediction and the stock price goes up
1498.08s: in quick fashion and you get a really
1500.32s: healthy profit on those calls
1502.16s: then you can actually you can short a
1504.24s: higher strike call
1505.76s: and collect the same amount or more
1509.36s: premium than you actually paid for the
1511.36s: initial long
1512.40s: and that creates a risk-free trade or if
1514.80s: you collect more on the short
1516.40s: then you paid for the long option you
1518.32s: get a guaranteed profit scenario
1520.72s: and so that's that's what i've been
1522.56s: doing essentially
1523.76s: and another benefit of that is you are
1526.80s: able to stay in the trade
1528.64s: without closing it so you can stay in
1530.80s: the trade and allow for more profit
1532.40s: potential
1533.52s: but it's not the same as closing the
1536.40s: whole trade
1537.28s: such as just selling the calls outright
1539.76s: so
1540.32s: a lot of people will ask me why don't
1542.24s: you just sell the calls for the profit
1543.60s: why'd you spread it off
1544.80s: and it's because i can allow for more
1547.04s: profit potential
1548.32s: since these options or spreads at this
1550.32s: point they have so much time until
1552.00s: expiration
1553.28s: if i have a risk-free call spread where
1556.08s: i can make
1557.20s: twice the profit that i already have on
1559.12s: it but it has 600 days to go
1561.36s: that's a pretty good situation in my
1563.12s: opinion yeah
1564.88s: one layer deeper than that is if you do
1567.60s: that strategy
1569.28s: so for example let's say i bought an out
1571.12s: of the money call on tesla
1572.72s: tesla shot up i shorted a higher strike
1575.44s: call
1576.24s: and i created the risk-free spread i sit
1578.88s: on that
1579.52s: and if tesla keeps going up then my
1581.92s: spread will continue appreciating in
1583.76s: value and i'll see more and more profits
1585.68s: come in
1586.32s: right or what can happen is tesla might
1589.28s: crash
1590.32s: and then that short option that i sold
1593.36s: will have lost a ton of value and so i
1595.92s: could buy back that short option
1598.16s: and basically that would be sort of a
1602.16s: wouldn't be a day trade but it would be
1603.84s: trading in and out of that short call
1605.76s: that initially was to remove all of my
1608.00s: risk in the trade
1609.52s: and if the stock price collapses after
1612.72s: i've shorted that call
1613.76s: then i can buy it back for a big profit
1616.32s: and then i can i'm right back where i
1617.92s: was
1618.40s: right one except i've actually reduced
1621.60s: the cost of my long calls so to speak
1623.76s: right so
1626.08s: i'm trying to give some numbers here so
1628.40s: the actual trade that i did
1630.24s: was i purchased the 900 strike calls in
1633.52s: tesla
1634.56s: and they had two plus years to
1636.00s: expiration and this was when tesla was
1638.48s: at like
1639.44s: you know four or five hundred dollars a
1641.20s: share so they were way out of the money
1643.60s: then tesla shot up to eight or nine
1645.68s: hundred it was probably like 800
1648.08s: and then i shorted the 1500 call but
1651.20s: i paid 100 for the 900 call and i was
1654.40s: able to short the 1500 call for 230
1657.92s: right so basically i i created this call
1660.24s: spread
1661.04s: where i had collected 13 000
1665.44s: for for entering a call debit spread
1668.64s: right but it wasn't a debit because i
1671.20s: legged into both trades
1672.64s: but then what happened is tesla actually
1675.44s: tanked so i was actually able to buy
1677.36s: back
1677.84s: this 1500 short call i bought it back
1680.72s: for
1681.20s: like 130 bucks which means i profited
1684.64s: by 10 000 on that short call portion
1688.48s: and since i made a ten thousand dollar
1690.80s: profit on that short call
1692.64s: and 10 000 was the initial outlay for
1694.80s: the 900 call
1696.08s: i effectively removed all of my risk
1699.04s: from the trade because i did a little
1700.80s: uh in and out trade on that short call
1703.36s: by
1703.84s: shorting it tesla went up and then once
1706.00s: tesla went back down
1707.84s: i was able to close it out and then what
1709.84s: happened is actually tesla went back up
1712.00s: and then i shorted it again for a higher
1714.72s: price so
1715.84s: one of the cool things with that
1716.96s: strategy is that you can actually trade
1718.96s: in and out
1719.92s: of that short option that you add to the
1723.20s: trade to remove
1724.00s: all your risk but you actually
1727.04s: have you're in a really good position in
1729.36s: terms of
1730.48s: your chess moves because if the stock
1732.72s: price keeps going up
1734.16s: as i said before your spread price will
1736.64s: continue to increase
1738.08s: and you will continue to make money on
1739.60s: that position but
1741.12s: if the stock price cl crashes then you
1744.32s: can actually
1745.52s: exit that short call position harvest
1748.16s: some profit from it
1749.36s: and then if you still have 600 days or
1752.08s: whatever on your long call
1753.84s: and the stock price goes back up you can
1755.84s: sell it again
1756.96s: and so you can kind of trade in and out
1758.48s: of that short option so i think it's uh
1761.84s: it leaves a lot of room for
1764.96s: having a stress-free position that you
1767.04s: can trade in and out of
1768.64s: strategically so yeah i think there's a
1770.88s: lot made sense i know i know i covered a
1772.48s: lot of information there it's probably
1773.84s: pretty confusing but
1775.20s: yeah i think most people will probably
1776.48s: be able to to keep up with it um
1778.56s: especially because um for me one of my
1781.28s: favorite strategies is a it's a
1783.28s: leap diagonal so it's a very similar
1785.20s: setup to what you're talking about
1786.64s: obviously the big difference normally is
1788.16s: for my short it'll be a little closer
1790.56s: um in expiration but like the way that
1792.72s: you kind of talk about setting
1794.00s: it up it's really beautiful to kind of
1795.68s: give it a little time before
1797.44s: offering that short because of exactly
1799.84s: that benefit i think that
1801.04s: honestly it's a really really good
1802.72s: approach for me
1804.24s: um i've always done kind of i guess a
1806.40s: derivative of that where
1808.08s: a lot of times when i'm setting up a
1809.36s: leap diagonal the first set of shorts
1811.84s: that i
1812.24s: offer might be like a third of the
1814.40s: overall position something like that
1816.32s: so it's a similar idea i i actually i
1819.28s: thought it was hilarious two things
1820.64s: though when you talked about
1822.16s: kind of the covey drop and kind of
1824.88s: thinking that we were going to go down
1826.00s: further so then you started buying you
1827.76s: know and that
1828.64s: i did the same exact thing so i had like
1831.12s: some short
1832.32s: pretty much i always carry some sort of
1834.72s: short puts
1835.60s: in iwm and it's more or less a covered
1838.16s: strangle play
1839.12s: so i'm always modulating you know what
1840.72s: i'm offering to that
1842.40s: but as soon as we started rallying out
1845.04s: of the bottom
1845.84s: i didn't believe it so i was like well
1847.12s: i'm not going to start adding more you
1848.48s: know short puts here and getting you
1849.92s: know stuck holding a bunch of positions
1851.60s: waiting for it to unwind
1852.96s: so i did the same exact thing i started
1854.40s: buying leaps and then kind of again
1856.24s: doing my
1856.80s: leap diagonal strategy but um i
1860.00s: i think that like exactly the the
1862.56s: approach that
1863.44s: you shared makes a ton of sense when
1865.28s: there's like those really strong rallies
1867.68s: yeah it's it's a really really good way
1869.36s: to go i was always
1871.04s: yeah i and i honestly commend you for
1873.52s: being patient enough to let that happen
1875.52s: for me i was always like
1876.88s: i was waiting for the drop that's why i
1878.24s: immediately put the shorts back out
1880.16s: on top of it i was like this is going to
1881.68s: go back down so that's like really good
1883.60s: on you for being able to do that yeah
1885.20s: thank you that brings up a good point
1887.68s: and i want to clarify a couple things
1889.12s: too so
1890.72s: first of all yeah you have to be patient
1893.60s: with that strategy because you obviously
1895.20s: need a big movement in your favor
1897.60s: before it will be possible to create
1900.32s: that risk-free spread
1902.16s: second thing i want to say is that i go
1904.80s: into
1905.84s: those long call positions accepting the
1909.04s: fact that i could lose a hundred percent
1911.36s: of what i paid for the option so this
1913.36s: isn't something where
1914.80s: um you know if i have 25 000 in an
1918.00s: account
1918.88s: i might not i'm not going to put 25 000
1922.40s: into one long call strategy i would
1925.04s: probably
1925.60s: put like 10 percent of the account into
1927.28s: it right knowing that that's a highly
1929.04s: leveraged position that
1930.40s: that it can even though it's a small
1932.64s: portion of the account it can still
1934.08s: drive
1935.20s: super strong overall account returns
1937.44s: right and so that's another thing is
1939.04s: yeah
1939.60s: with these positions it's not like um
1941.92s: i'm not putting 100 of the account
1944.16s: into these long call trades they make up
1947.52s: a small
1948.16s: portion of the overall account value
1950.88s: right but they still
1953.12s: they still have a lot of potential to
1954.56s: drive really strong overall account
1956.88s: returns
1957.68s: and i think also since they are a
1959.68s: smaller portion
1960.96s: of the account value that gives me peace
1963.84s: of mind
1964.64s: in being able to hold them longer
1967.04s: whereas if you had
1968.56s: a much larger position like you put your
1971.36s: whole account
1972.24s: into a long call trade and it goes you
1974.80s: know in your favor
1976.40s: for a few days maybe a few weeks you are
1979.12s: probably going to be inclined to
1981.20s: spread off that position prematurely
1984.00s: when
1984.96s: you can get a much better position
1986.56s: overall if you're just a little more
1987.92s: patient
1988.64s: right but at the end of the day like you
1990.48s: still need that movement in your favor
1992.16s: i'm not gonna try to make it sound easy
1994.32s: sure but it was just a really
1996.48s: really well performing strategy over the
1999.12s: past
1999.76s: year or so yeah and then
2003.36s: another thing i wanted to talk about is
2005.04s: people ask me well how do you choose the
2007.12s: stocks to do this in
2008.40s: and it's a really hard question to
2011.44s: answer because
2012.88s: like i said you have to be right about
2014.96s: that directional movement
2016.40s: and therefore you should be putting it
2018.24s: putting it on in a stock or company
2020.56s: that you have a high conviction
2023.76s: will actually move in your favor
2026.80s: not immediately but over the course of
2029.36s: that trade and this is why i like to go
2031.20s: super far out in time
2032.88s: is that people will say well you're
2034.64s: buying those options that are
2036.24s: 750 days out but you're paying so much
2039.20s: for them and i'm comfortable paying
2041.12s: the higher premium for those longer term
2043.52s: options because i know
2045.04s: that it's much easier on me
2047.12s: psychologically
2048.08s: yeah and there's another benefit to not
2049.52s: have to to not have to pearl that
2052.08s: that prediction and and be 100 right
2054.64s: about
2055.36s: you know tesla going up a hundred
2056.80s: dollars in the next seven days otherwise
2058.84s: yeah and the other the the other really
2061.60s: good benefit there too that's definitely
2063.20s: worth mentioning is just
2064.80s: for a lot of people if they're buying
2066.88s: far out of the money options that expire
2068.72s: in two weeks
2069.68s: sure they're cheaper but theta is not
2072.40s: doing any favors
2073.60s: whereas once you're out that far
2076.48s: realistically you're doing a great job
2078.56s: minimizing the impact of theta so yes
2080.88s: it's you know more out of your pocket up
2082.64s: front
2083.04s: but you have a higher expectation to at
2085.44s: least collect something on on what
2087.20s: you're putting out there
2088.56s: right and i think if
2091.68s: and in that same vein i would i would
2093.52s: choose companies
2095.20s: that are pretty well known like the
2098.96s: the companies that i've done this exact
2100.56s: strategy in are
2102.40s: tesla i have an open position like this
2105.76s: in
2106.00s: apple but this is the apple position is
2108.48s: um
2109.12s: it's not super successful right now but
2112.32s: you know i um actually with the apple
2114.08s: position i bought calls and
2116.80s: apple went down and those calls went
2118.64s: down 50 in value
2120.40s: but i still had a lot of cash on the
2122.72s: sidelines
2123.68s: because that position was small which is
2125.84s: what i got back to what i was telling
2127.36s: you about before
2128.72s: and when those options were down fifty
2131.44s: percent
2132.00s: what i did is i actually bought
2135.04s: more of those contracts so i initially
2136.72s: had five contracts bought them for nine
2138.48s: dollars each they went to five dollars
2140.80s: and then i bought five more contracts at
2143.60s: five dollars each
2145.12s: and i actually went one expiration
2147.60s: further so these options had like 730
2150.00s: days
2150.40s: at the time of entering and so now i own
2152.64s: a total of 10 contracts but the average
2154.96s: cost per contract is somewhere around
2157.36s: seven to seven dollars and fifty cents
2159.84s: as opposed to nine dollars
2161.76s: and getting back to what i said before
2164.64s: i'm very comfortable having that
2165.92s: position on an apple because
2167.92s: everybody loves apple and i think also
2170.64s: with the
2171.76s: the upcoming 5g revolution i think apple
2174.48s: stands to benefit immensely from that
2176.64s: and so i'm comfortable having that
2178.32s: long-term position on in
2179.84s: apple let me tell you if they don't
2181.76s: bring back the thumbprint i'm going to
2183.44s: throw a riot
2184.40s: because they need to bring the bumper
2186.40s: back
2187.92s: yeah i actually i forgot that they got
2190.56s: rid of that i have the face id
2192.08s: the face id phone now it doesn't even
2193.68s: have the thumb button anymore uh-huh
2195.68s: um but yeah so the stocks have done it
2198.72s: in is tesla i
2200.32s: have done it in apple but as i said my
2202.24s: apple position
2203.68s: is not super successful right now it's
2205.36s: probably around break even maybe up
2207.36s: very slightly um i have positions like
2210.80s: this
2211.20s: in square i did this in microstrategy
2214.32s: which was a bitcoin related play i have
2217.20s: some of these in nvidia
2220.00s: um i have some in visa
2224.24s: and i do have some in spy so
2227.52s: when in doubt if if you have the
2230.96s: assumption that the market
2232.40s: is going to go up on average
2236.64s: each year and you're comfortable with
2239.04s: that
2239.92s: thesis that overall the market goes up
2242.24s: long term
2243.12s: then i think spy is a great product for
2245.04s: this exact strategy
2247.12s: because it's a very liquid product so
2249.44s: you have
2250.24s: tons of activity in there in the options
2252.48s: and it's not
2253.76s: like you're trading some penny stock
2255.68s: where nobody knows about it and
2257.36s: the options have no liquidity and you're
2259.44s: just putting on these long calls just to
2261.52s: kind of throw a hail mary
2262.88s: so i think when in doubt if if people
2265.36s: just stuck to the indices
2267.28s: so spy qq iwm i think that would be
2271.04s: you know that's a good piece of advice
2272.72s: that i can give
2274.16s: but other than that if you have a
2275.36s: specific company that you're
2277.28s: you have a high conviction on over the
2278.96s: next one to two years
2281.28s: then i think this strategy works nicely
2284.24s: but as i
2285.36s: as we talked about before you have to
2286.64s: have a small enough position sizing
2289.44s: where you don't care if
2290.64s: it goes to zero so you have to be able
2292.72s: to hold
2293.92s: and also you have to you know have that
2296.64s: conviction
2297.36s: and be patient if it does move in your
2299.60s: favor because
2300.56s: if you spread it off too early then
2302.88s: what's going to happen is you're going
2303.92s: to have a narrow
2305.20s: call spread and if you have a really
2307.92s: narrow call spread that has 700 days
2310.08s: expiration
2311.20s: it's really not going to move much right
2312.96s: you really need
2314.56s: all of that time decay to come out and
2317.12s: you're basically going to have to sit
2318.40s: there and wait
2319.20s: for 700 days even if that spread gets
2321.76s: fully in the money
2322.96s: to see that spreads value increase so
2325.84s: that's why i like waiting longer
2327.60s: is because if you're spreading off the
2330.16s: trade
2331.52s: when the stock price has gone up a
2333.60s: really good amount
2334.56s: and you're able to get a really wide
2336.24s: call spread that's my ideal situation so
2339.12s: in the tesla example
2341.12s: i bought the 900 call and then i was
2342.88s: able to short the 1500 call so that's a
2345.12s: really wide call spread
2346.64s: and that's what i want for a position
2348.56s: that has
2349.68s: 600 days or more to go i wouldn't want
2352.56s: to
2353.12s: buy the 900 call and then spread it off
2355.04s: with you know the
2356.32s: the 950 call because to me that's
2359.84s: basically
2360.80s: you're basically just selling the option
2362.88s: at that point but the closer
2365.60s: is actually an interesting interesting
2367.28s: thing to think about
2369.52s: the closer you sell the if you're if
2372.00s: you're going to spread
2373.20s: a trade or you buy an option and then
2375.28s: you're going to short an option against
2376.72s: it
2377.28s: the closer the short option is to
2380.48s: your original strike the closer
2382.72s: represents just closing
2385.44s: the your original option because if you
2387.12s: think about if you think about the same
2388.32s: strike if you buy the 900 call
2390.40s: stock price goes up and then you short
2393.68s: the 900 call you're effectively just
2395.92s: closing your
2396.72s: original position right but if you
2400.00s: shorted the 905 call you didn't close
2403.68s: your
2404.08s: original 900 call but you've shorted an
2407.68s: option that's so close to your original
2409.12s: strike that it
2409.84s: almost represents just selling the
2411.92s: original position
2413.04s: right so what you can think about is the
2415.92s: further away the strike is or the wider
2417.92s: the spread
2418.88s: it's basically like taking a a profit on
2421.92s: a
2422.24s: smaller portion of that trade if that
2424.96s: makes any sense
2426.32s: yeah i think and it's a good way to
2428.16s: describe it it's
2429.36s: similar a lot of stuff that i talk about
2431.60s: with like the
2432.64s: my leap diagonal approach is um like
2435.20s: integrating deltas for that exact
2437.20s: you know display so i think i think that
2439.36s: makes a lot of sense for
2440.40s: for folks um that are kind of keying and
2442.56s: uh keying into this
2444.56s: so you named a couple things that you've
2447.84s: you've been trading with this strategy
2449.76s: one of the questions that i got
2451.52s: um was what are some products
2454.88s: that you typically trade that you
2456.96s: haven't favored quite as much
2459.28s: just in the current markets and you had
2461.28s: an interesting answer when i asked you
2462.72s: that before so i'm
2463.60s: curious i'm curious you know to explore
2466.24s: that a little bit with you yeah my
2467.60s: answer before was
2469.12s: i've always kind of had a small universe
2471.20s: of stocks that i've traded
2472.56s: and products that i've traded pretty
2475.20s: much i only trade companies that
2478.16s: you would see in in the headlines like
2480.88s: really well-known companies that have
2483.20s: lots of activity in the options market
2486.08s: um
2486.56s: those are the companies that i trade i
2488.00s: don't really venture off
2489.76s: into more exotic companies that you know
2492.64s: are off the beaten path
2494.64s: my approach is just to stick to the
2497.76s: companies that i know
2499.68s: and not not like know them in terms of
2502.80s: how the stocks move or stuff like that
2504.40s: because sure obviously no one knows that
2506.00s: but just like the companies that if you
2508.00s: were walking down the street
2509.60s: and you mentioned a company name any
2511.52s: average person would
2512.64s: know what company you're talking about
2514.32s: those are the companies that i stick
2516.08s: with primarily
2517.36s: um one thing that's come to mind though
2519.84s: is i used to trade a lot of
2521.56s: svxy svxy
2524.56s: is an inverse volatility product if
2527.52s: anybody remembers
2528.96s: xiv rip
2532.96s: if anybody remembers xiv svxy is
2536.32s: essentially the same thing as
2537.68s: xiv except xiv never had tradable
2540.80s: options
2541.68s: xiv people just traded the shares but
2544.64s: svxy
2545.92s: had tradable options so i used to trade
2547.68s: a lot of svxy
2549.28s: however when the whole volpocalypse
2552.48s: happened
2553.04s: when xiv was terminated because it lost
2557.04s: 95 percent of its value overnight they
2559.52s: actually reduced the leverage on svxy
2562.32s: so it used to be a negative one times
2564.16s: leverage which
2565.36s: meant essentially if v
2568.80s: x x it's essentially the opposite is v x
2571.12s: x so
2572.40s: if v x x went up ten percent in one day
2575.52s: s v x y would go down 10
2578.72s: one day right but after that whole
2581.20s: volatility
2582.40s: calamity i should say they actually cut
2585.12s: svxy's leverage in half
2587.12s: so now it's a negative 0.5 x so what's
2590.64s: the fun in that
2591.60s: if v x x goes up ten percent then s v x
2594.48s: y will go down
2595.52s: five percent and if v x x goes down five
2598.96s: percent
2599.44s: s v x y will go up two and a half
2600.96s: percent see i wasn't a big fan of the
2603.68s: the leverage cut and they actually did
2606.00s: the same thing in uv xy too yeah uv xy
2608.56s: was
2608.96s: was 2x and now it's uh 1.5
2613.36s: so they they reduced the leverage in
2615.04s: those products and that
2616.96s: kind of eliminated some of the interest
2618.96s: in it for me
2620.88s: so these days if i'm trading a
2622.08s: volatility product it's most likely vxx
2626.00s: actually very recently i had a nice
2627.52s: trade in vxx which
2629.84s: i talked about a little bit on a live
2631.36s: stream but
2633.04s: um via vix the vix was at like 20
2637.44s: and the near-term vix futures were at
2639.20s: like 25
2640.88s: and what happens is the vix futures over
2644.32s: time
2644.88s: will converge to whatever index that
2647.76s: they're
2648.00s: tracking where futures traders will say
2651.44s: the futures will converge to spot so
2654.72s: vix is the spot volatility vix futures
2657.68s: are kind of the
2659.04s: future expected volatility or
2662.08s: what traders will have to trade if they
2664.00s: want to trade the future and not
2665.84s: actual spot which if you want to trade
2667.76s: spot fix you actually can't trade it you
2669.52s: have to trade the options which are tied
2671.60s: to the futures but anyways vixx was at
2674.32s: 20.
2674.96s: the vix futures were at 25 and
2678.64s: i was like if if the vix stays here
2681.92s: or goes lower then these futures are
2684.32s: going to converge
2686.08s: down to the vix index and they're going
2687.92s: to lose like 20
2689.36s: of value so what i did is in vxx i
2693.12s: purchased
2694.08s: a hundred contracts of out of the money
2697.12s: puts
2698.00s: and this was before the split i think
2700.48s: vxx was at
2702.56s: like 13 or 14 and i bought a hundred
2706.32s: of the 10 strike puts in vxx for like
2710.00s: seven cents each or 17 cents each
2712.64s: and what happened was exactly what i
2716.00s: said so the market was
2717.36s: trending upwards and the vix index was
2720.32s: trending downwards
2721.52s: but there was such a premium in the
2723.44s: futures to the vix index
2725.36s: that what happens is since vxx is
2728.32s: actually tracking the basket of these
2730.64s: near-term vix futures since they had so
2733.20s: much value to lose
2734.88s: to get to the vix index i thought it was
2736.96s: extremely bearish for vxx
2739.36s: and so i just put on this long shot
2742.96s: put option trade in vxx and i purchased
2745.84s: 100 contracts at 17 cents each
2748.56s: and i ended up closing all those out for
2751.60s: more than a dollar so that was that was
2754.56s: a really sizable trade
2756.00s: and that was probably the biggest winner
2758.00s: i've had in vxx in a while
2760.40s: but that was the first speculative trade
2762.32s: that i use in vxx that wasn't actually a
2765.12s: hedge
2765.76s: because sometimes i'll use vxx and buy
2768.08s: some out-of-the-money calls
2769.52s: just to have some portfolio insurance
2772.24s: sure because as we talked about earlier
2774.64s: if the market crashes the vix index will
2777.28s: shoot up
2777.92s: and that'll bring the futures with it
2780.00s: and since vxx is tracking the vix
2781.84s: futures
2782.64s: that means vxx will go up as well right
2785.60s: so if you look at what happened to vxx
2787.68s: um
2788.96s: in the coronavirus meltdown vxx went
2791.44s: from like
2792.80s: 12 all the way up to like the 80s yep
2796.08s: and there are stories on
2797.44s: on reddit where people made hundreds of
2799.76s: thousands of dollars from that actually
2802.16s: it's funny my brother had a position on
2804.64s: he's not gonna like this he had a
2806.64s: position on
2807.76s: where he actually bought a ton of vxx
2811.12s: out of the money calls and he
2814.96s: spread off the risk way too early
2818.08s: and he eventually got out of the
2819.52s: position and if he would have held
2823.12s: those options he would have made like a
2825.12s: quarter million dollars
2828.00s: at any at any of the prices where vxx
2830.64s: was
2831.04s: you know 50 plus but he i mean he did
2834.00s: 10x his account
2835.44s: he went from like he turned like a
2838.64s: five five thousand dollar an account
2840.56s: into like 25 000 so it wasn't
2842.96s: it wasn't a 10x it was many multiples
2845.20s: but
2846.00s: if he would have held those options it
2848.80s: would have been
2849.44s: a quarter million dollar trade the good
2851.52s: old traders hindsight man
2853.36s: yeah but that gets back to what we said
2855.04s: before if you
2857.12s: if you have conviction and something
2858.72s: happening you gotta
2860.48s: you can't take your risk off too soon
2862.72s: otherwise
2863.84s: you know and that's that's not even
2866.08s: options trading that's
2867.04s: also investing in stocks like you know
2870.00s: those headlines that say if you would
2872.32s: have invested in
2873.28s: an amazon 2000 and you held till today
2876.88s: you would have turned a thousand dollars
2878.48s: into 2.5 million or something like that
2881.12s: but what people miss is
2884.16s: for that one thousand dollars to go to
2886.16s: two million
2887.44s: you had to watch the 1000 go to 10 000
2890.48s: without selling
2891.84s: and then you had to watch that that 1000
2894.24s: go to 10
2894.88s: 000 and then you had to watch it go to
2896.16s: 50 000 without you selling
2898.40s: so the only way you get to that 2
2900.00s: million is if you actually had the
2902.00s: conviction to hold the whole time
2903.60s: and i think that's a really important
2904.88s: concept just to
2906.64s: throw into this conversation because
2909.36s: that's my exact
2910.80s: philosophy with um with bitcoin because
2913.68s: i bought a bunch of bitcoin
2915.36s: last year and right after the
2919.20s: the depths of the coronavirus i didn't
2920.72s: get to buy bitcoin at like 5k
2922.72s: but i bought a bulk of my position at um
2925.44s: like nine
2926.32s: to fifteen thousand and i went into that
2930.32s: position
2931.36s: with a very long-term mindset and
2934.48s: it's gone really well thus far
2938.40s: but because i bought so much of it and
2941.36s: because it's gone up in value now it
2943.36s: represents
2944.72s: a really a really big portion of my
2947.36s: overall wealth
2948.48s: right and most people would say oh you
2950.96s: got to sell
2951.68s: like you got to take your profits but i
2954.24s: went into it with a certain
2956.08s: with a certain goal in mind which was to
2957.68s: hold it long term
2959.28s: and getting back to the amazon example
2962.88s: you can't turn a thousand dollars into
2964.48s: two million without watching the
2966.08s: thousand go to ten thousand to fifty
2967.76s: thousand
2968.32s: without you know selling it out so i'm
2970.88s: holding strong
2971.68s: in my bitcoin position and it's it's
2974.24s: it's deeply rooted in that exact same
2976.72s: thought process as you know those
2978.64s: headlines where they say
2979.92s: you turn this into this but they don't
2982.40s: talk about the in-between would you
2984.48s: do you integrate any like partial profit
2986.80s: taking because
2987.60s: for me like i actually traded bitcoin
2990.24s: back
2990.72s: in like 2013 and i i held it for a while
2994.00s: just because i
2994.64s: like just randomly heard of it was kind
2996.32s: of curious and as soon as i started
2999.20s: seeing it you know four years down the
3000.96s: line five years down the line
3002.32s: making kind of crazy moves i started
3005.04s: pairing the position until i
3006.56s: eventually paired myself out of it all
3008.08s: the way but
3009.68s: one of the things that i integrate in a
3012.16s: lot of my trading plans
3013.60s: is partial profit taking so you know and
3016.32s: obviously the idea is
3018.00s: to secure some realized gains based on
3021.12s: risk offered and then still leaving
3024.96s: a good portion on for future potential
3028.16s: returns
3028.96s: and one of the things that i also like
3031.60s: to
3033.60s: highlight why i've gone that way is
3035.92s: because for everybody you know
3037.60s: exactly like you said write the mx
3039.20s: amazon example if you take 1k would it
3041.12s: be
3041.44s: you know two plus million if you held
3042.96s: the whole time and then
3044.64s: you know if you kind of zoom that out if
3046.88s: you you know
3047.68s: picked a basket of 30 stocks and did
3050.08s: that 1 000
3051.12s: in all of them one of them maybe amazon
3053.84s: maybe
3054.48s: not too likely you know what i mean so
3056.08s: there's also that piece to it
3057.76s: so i'm curious if you integrate any like
3060.32s: aspect of profit taking or you
3062.32s: that resolute in this money's going in
3065.28s: and
3065.60s: it's staying there that's pretty much
3068.08s: what you just said so it the money went
3069.84s: in
3070.16s: and it's [ __ ] awesome i don't have
3072.24s: any plans to sell it anytime soon
3074.48s: so this is a this is a good point like
3076.80s: that's a good argument too is that
3079.60s: i would never look at a stock right now
3081.84s: a publicly traded company
3083.20s: and say this is the next amazon right
3086.48s: but i think in the case of bitcoin
3091.04s: i think probably like weighting the
3094.16s: probabilities
3095.20s: i think bitcoin has the highest
3098.08s: probability of anything right now of
3099.84s: being
3100.88s: the next amazon over the next
3103.92s: 10 plus years like long longer than that
3106.56s: decades
3108.48s: and i fully i also fully expect or
3111.36s: accept sorry not expect
3112.96s: i accept the risk that i have
3116.16s: and if it goes to zero then
3120.24s: i've actually i actually thought about
3121.44s: this some people might think this is
3123.60s: stupid
3124.32s: but um if bitcoin were to go to zero
3128.00s: yeah i would lose a bunch of money but
3132.48s: i will have put money where my mouth was
3135.76s: and i will have
3136.72s: stood for something and i will also come
3138.64s: out the other end much smarter
3140.48s: because learning about bitcoin has made
3143.68s: me
3144.24s: learn about a new technology and expand
3147.12s: my mind
3148.00s: and also learn about
3151.12s: some some big macro economic topics like
3153.60s: we've talked about with information
3155.36s: and inflation being kind of the primary
3157.36s: one and
3158.80s: look into the history of currencies and
3161.12s: and understand
3162.40s: you know why do they do it this way and
3164.72s: why don't we have
3165.60s: a different approach where you know we
3167.44s: keep the money supply the same
3169.28s: uh i i think bitcoin overall for me has
3172.00s: been
3172.88s: a net positive and if i don't have a
3175.84s: huge financial gain from it
3177.60s: at the end of the day you know that's
3180.08s: fine
3180.80s: i accept the risk that i have and i'm in
3183.84s: it
3184.40s: yeah that's awesome it's honestly really
3186.16s: really cool to hear stories like that
3188.40s: um and obviously i'm i'm rooting for you
3191.68s: i would love nothing more
3192.80s: than to to see a you know big video
3195.52s: about you in 10 years
3196.96s: how you just you know bought some island
3198.96s: and are now sailing around on a yacht
3200.48s: that would be
3201.60s: that would be dope i'm not the
3203.44s: winklevoss twins
3205.04s: unfortunately i think the the bitcoin
3207.04s: billionaire ship has sailed
3209.28s: yeah um and that that definitely is a
3212.32s: important part to bring in is you know
3214.40s: it's yeah i do think it's really
3215.76s: difficult to price something like
3217.36s: bitcoin right some people might say well
3218.96s: isn't it priced in and then you know you
3220.64s: kind of ask well
3221.52s: what what's priced in you know it's
3223.20s: still it's still being
3224.56s: figured out how they're going to
3225.76s: integrate it in the economy you know i
3227.20s: think um
3228.40s: i think the the comparison that people
3231.52s: always use is kind of the most common
3233.28s: valuation
3234.24s: metric for valuing or at least a big
3237.76s: milestone for valuing bitcoin
3239.52s: is people compared to gold because it
3241.76s: has all the characteristics of gold
3243.92s: except
3245.44s: it's better on basically every metric
3247.76s: with the exception of having a
3250.88s: multi-thousand year history of being
3253.84s: used as a store value that's really the
3255.60s: only thing bitcoin
3256.96s: does not have that gold has because
3261.28s: bitcoin has all the other
3262.24s: characteristics except for that
3264.72s: track record well you could argue that
3267.52s: gold has a
3268.40s: has a physical purpose not saying that
3271.04s: it's like
3271.44s: that's true that's true so that's
3272.56s: another argument too is that gold is has
3274.40s: a physical
3276.16s: use case whereas bitcoin doesn't have
3278.72s: any physical use cases because it's
3280.80s: it lives in the atmosphere essentially
3283.28s: but what i always
3284.32s: pair with that is that that's where
3286.32s: bitcoin's true value
3287.84s: could be derived is from that that yeah
3290.72s: exactly because there is no
3292.32s: physical component to it and the privacy
3295.04s: components to it right anyways
3296.64s: that's an interesting way to interpret
3298.08s: it too is that like in the us we have
3300.64s: the us dollar and in the eu they have
3304.24s: the euro right so there's all these
3306.48s: currencies
3307.68s: forms of money that are used in all
3309.60s: these different countries
3310.88s: and if you were to kind of zoom out on
3314.00s: if you just think of a kind of like a
3317.60s: international space station view of
3319.20s: earth and you're
3320.80s: you're watching all these countries come
3322.16s: by and then you see
3323.84s: you know the different currency symbols
3325.84s: on each country
3326.88s: yeah but then you have the bitcoin
3328.48s: symbol which is like in the atmosphere
3330.56s: around the whole globe so that's kind of
3332.08s: the whole idea is that
3333.36s: [ __ ] you just got a sales pitch right
3334.88s: there you need to get that on a
3336.16s: marketing thing
3337.60s: it's it's borderless yeah maybe i should
3340.00s: uh reach out to them and
3341.44s: tell them to use that in some marketing
3342.88s: materials but where i was going with
3344.96s: this
3345.28s: is people compare bitcoin to gold
3349.52s: the market cap of gold is around
3353.52s: let's just say 10 trillion i think it's
3355.60s: like 9 trillion i
3356.64s: don't know the exact figure but the
3360.00s: market cap of bitcoin is around 1
3362.96s: trillion
3363.92s: and so if you if you increase bitcoin's
3367.60s: market cap
3368.40s: to be the same as gold then you get
3371.68s: 500 000 per bitcoin so that's the
3375.28s: the winklevoss twins made a big write-up
3377.20s: about that and that was their case
3378.80s: and that's how they backed into the 500k
3381.52s: per bitcoin was
3382.80s: if bitcoin matches gold and overtakes
3386.00s: its market cap it will be
3387.92s: 500 per bitcoin but the interesting
3391.44s: thing is
3391.92s: earlier we were talking about asset
3394.16s: prices and their performance
3396.32s: so i this video that i'm writing that
3398.16s: will be out this week
3399.60s: i was actually looking at the
3401.04s: year-to-date performance of
3403.36s: certain assets so i looked at the s p
3405.28s: 500 it's up about 12
3407.60s: year-to-date bitcoins up 84
3411.12s: year-to-date real estate i couldn't find
3413.68s: a year-to-date
3414.72s: metric but i told you earlier i was
3417.28s: looking at
3418.40s: real estate a real estate pricing index
3420.56s: by the fh
3422.40s: fa federal housing finance agency
3425.44s: and they have a single family home price
3427.76s: index based on sales
3429.28s: and january 19 2019 to january 2020
3433.92s: that index went up six percent january
3436.24s: 2020 to january 2021
3438.48s: that went up 12 percent right so let's
3440.24s: just say
3441.68s: real estate year to date is up about 12
3444.40s: or like 10
3445.68s: sure the interesting thing is if you
3447.44s: look at gold
3449.36s: gold is actually not doing well at all
3452.16s: right
3453.12s: gold is let's see where was the uh
3457.76s: so gold is down year to date and
3462.48s: that's very interesting for bitcoin
3464.80s: because
3465.76s: a lot of people there's there's a lot of
3468.48s: people that are
3470.32s: big believers in gold but they don't
3473.36s: believe in bitcoin
3474.72s: but as i said earlier bitcoin has
3478.48s: all the characteristics of gold except
3480.56s: improvements in the characteristics
3482.64s: and it's very interesting that something
3486.16s: like bitcoin
3487.04s: if it's up 84 this year then why is gold
3490.48s: down
3491.36s: and if gold is seen as a inflation hedge
3496.08s: then why is gold down this year given
3499.12s: what we've seen
3500.48s: in all other asset prices and with gold
3504.16s: being kind of like the go-to
3505.76s: inflation hedge that's an interesting
3508.24s: thing so
3508.88s: yeah the argument there is people
3512.88s: the argument is that um bitcoin is
3515.60s: eating
3516.08s: gold so people are selling gold to buy
3519.04s: bitcoin
3519.76s: and that's why gold is down um
3522.96s: again i'm not a macro expert and i don't
3525.84s: know
3526.16s: a ton about the gold market but i do
3528.32s: think it is very interesting that giving
3530.40s: gold's characteristics and given
3532.64s: the monetary policy and just the the
3535.52s: policy environment that we're seeing
3536.88s: right now
3537.92s: and looking at all the other asset
3539.84s: prices year to date
3541.44s: that everything is up except for gold
3544.08s: right
3545.28s: yeah it's honestly that's a really
3546.64s: interesting perspective i can't say that
3548.48s: something i've personally thought about
3550.08s: much is kind of the relationship between
3551.92s: bitcoin directly and that's it's a
3554.24s: really good question because
3555.76s: right i've heard a lot of people
3557.28s: speculating on
3558.96s: you know a lot of people are moving from
3560.48s: things like gold into real estate with
3562.72s: rates being as low as they were and
3564.08s: things like that but i think i honestly
3565.84s: think there's a really good argument
3567.68s: to say something like bitcoin could
3569.28s: absolutely be starting to take away a
3571.44s: good portion
3572.48s: of you know gold's quote-unquote market
3574.72s: share as people are kind of starting to
3576.80s: adopt that kind of thing i
3578.16s: yeah that's a really really curious
3580.80s: curious question
3582.08s: so i'm not you know like i said i'm not
3585.12s: an expert on that but i do think it is
3587.44s: very interesting
3588.48s: that based on our conversation earlier
3591.36s: of
3591.84s: you know where do you put your money if
3593.52s: you're trying to hide from potential
3595.68s: high levels of inflation yeah and we've
3598.48s: seen
3599.04s: all these other asset prices increasing
3601.76s: exponentially
3603.04s: and it seems like that's happening uh it
3605.84s: seems like that's happening because
3607.92s: you can't you don't have any real
3610.08s: returns in these low-risk assets you
3612.08s: would think that gold
3613.52s: would be up this year right you would
3615.44s: think gold would be up
3616.80s: 10 to 15 this year uh based on
3620.80s: what we've seen in all the other assets
3622.96s: and based on the
3624.48s: the monetary policy environment but
3626.08s: that's not the case so
3627.68s: i think it is very interesting yeah no
3630.32s: it's super curious that's actually
3631.44s: really
3632.08s: good good note to to end off on too
3634.72s: because
3635.44s: i think um i would i would be curious to
3638.32s: hear what other people think about that
3640.16s: yeah we have any yeah any gold experts
3642.80s: watching
3644.80s: if we have any gold experts watching
3646.24s: they're probably oh they're probably
3648.08s: like right they're probably like six
3649.36s: beers deep right now
3651.76s: um yeah they're probably they're
3653.68s: probably not happy with this
3654.64s: conversation but i would be super cute
3656.64s: i honestly have i'm not a gold hater i
3659.36s: just think um
3660.64s: yeah i don't know i think
3664.56s: i think bitcoin is a much more elegant
3667.68s: solution
3668.56s: and i think for me too another thing to
3670.48s: think about is that
3671.84s: in bitcoin they say not your keys not
3673.84s: your bitcoin right so what that means is
3675.68s: that if you're not
3676.80s: self-custing your bitcoin private keys
3679.60s: like you don't have
3680.64s: a hardware wallet where you're storing
3683.12s: your private keys you're
3684.00s: not keeping that safe then it's you
3687.04s: actually don't own the bitcoin
3688.56s: so if you're keeping your bitcoin on an
3690.08s: exchange like coinbase
3691.60s: technically they are the ones that are
3693.12s: holding the keys to your wallet
3695.44s: and therefore you don't really own that
3698.64s: bitcoin
3699.68s: the same thing is true for gold i've
3701.92s: actually looked into
3703.28s: buying gold historically and the only
3706.24s: true way to really own gold
3708.24s: is to buy physical bars of gold
3711.28s: right and put it in a safe in my closet
3713.76s: yeah
3714.48s: it seems that seems seems like way more
3717.28s: of a pain in the ass than
3718.88s: um having bitcoin and having you know
3722.16s: these
3722.48s: little salt key or something yeah these
3724.80s: little usb
3725.60s: drives i tell you what man if you wanted
3727.68s: to make a you know build a bed frame out
3730.08s: of
3730.48s: bitcoin kizo that's not going to do it
3732.24s: so you need you need the gold bars man
3735.20s: yeah i guess so
3738.72s: i don't know man it's a very interesting
3740.64s: thing so it's like yeah
3741.84s: you want to physically actually hold the
3744.00s: gold then
3745.52s: you got to actually buy the physical
3746.96s: thing because if you buy something like
3748.40s: gld you actually don't
3750.08s: you have kind of a paper receipt for
3753.20s: gold but
3754.48s: like like i said if the gold is not in
3756.08s: your possession then
3758.56s: technically you don't really you don't
3760.00s: really own it so right it just seems
3761.76s: like uh
3762.64s: comparing bitcoin to gold in terms of
3764.40s: custody it's
3766.48s: it's much more of a pain in the ass to
3768.00s: actually hold physical gold
3770.24s: absolutely and then you also have the
3771.84s: you also have the liquidity issue
3773.36s: you don't even exactly like now now you
3775.12s: have your you know closet full of gold
3777.36s: and you're like well i want some money
3778.88s: for that
3779.60s: take me it would take me multiple days
3781.92s: if not weeks to actually
3783.44s: convert that into to a different medium
3786.64s: of exchange absolutely whereas bitcoin
3789.84s: you can settle any basically any
3792.56s: transaction value i could literally
3795.44s: move a billion dollars or send a billion
3797.36s: dollars with a bitcoin across the whole
3799.12s: globe
3799.68s: and you know it could be final
3802.32s: settlement in less than an hour
3803.92s: yep so you know that's that's pretty
3807.12s: compelling
3807.84s: the fee might be a little brutal but the
3809.68s: liquidity will be there
3810.88s: no yeah for sure yeah so anyways yeah
3814.24s: super super good to connect with you
3815.84s: again being sensitive time as always
3818.24s: you know it's a pleasure to kind of just
3820.16s: talk a little bit about what we're
3821.28s: seeing now it's
3822.40s: yeah it's fascinating man there's a lot
3824.32s: of really curious things going on it's
3826.08s: really good to hear
3827.28s: you know the direction that you're kind
3828.64s: of taking your brand i'm excited to see
3831.28s: you know what that turns into and follow
3833.04s: along and then as always thanks for
