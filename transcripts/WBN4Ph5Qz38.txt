0.00s: What is quadruple, witching and why should you care?
4.08s: We're going to go through exactly that.
5.48s: I got this DM essentially asking if we could talk about quadruple, witching and you know
10.00s: it doesn't take much to get me ready to talk about some options and derivatives.
13.80s: So here we go.
16.68s: In short, it's pretty simple.
18.52s: It's when we have multiple kinds of derivatives that expire on the same day.
24.36s: So options futures, single stock futures, stuff like that.
28.04s: I actually made a little table to make it easier to tell and you'll notice there's actually
32.76s: more on here than just quadruple, witching and I'll explain exactly why.
36.36s: Double witching essentially happens monthly and it is not a big impact.
40.36s: So you could just essentially drop that off the bottom of your mind.
43.08s: It doesn't matter.
44.08s: Just know what to think.
45.76s: Then there's triple witching.
47.00s: This is kind of phased out when we started launching single stock future explorations.
53.80s: When this was added, it essentially all became quadruple witching.
57.76s: So triple witching is legacy.
59.40s: You'll hear people refer to that, but really they're referring to quadruple witching.
64.36s: And when does it happen?
66.16s: It's the standard expiration cycle for derivatives, which is the third Friday of the month.
71.16s: What months you might ask March, June, September and December.
75.12s: So what's happening here on quadruple witching days, which one of them is coming up very
80.80s: soon.
81.80s: Today's the 19th of June.
83.24s: We have stock options, stock index options, stock index futures and single stock futures,
88.72s: all that expire on the same day.
90.88s: A lot of explorations that all kind of line up with one another.
94.16s: The reason why this matters is because a lot of institutional driven market activity will
99.48s: kick off.
100.72s: There will be a lot of transactions that are coming in two different forms.
105.88s: We have market makers that are going to be hedging positions coming into expiration for
111.04s: a lot of individual products that may or may not correspond with one another.
115.44s: But then you're also going to have the speculators, the position holders, again, on the institutional
119.64s: side that have positions that are closing down that they have to reopen further out in
125.04s: time.
126.04s: This actually leads to different kinds of arbitrage and trading opportunities for more sophisticated
131.00s: traders, which we could do a video on at some point.
133.52s: But I want to walk you through most importantly, what the impact is to the market.
138.52s: It's kind of twofold.
139.92s: You'll notice that volume is typically going to go up and you'll notice that volatility
144.52s: tends to spike and then contract again, depending on the rest of the broad market cycle.
150.84s: But there definitely is a higher probability of market volatility starting to kick off.
156.76s: So let's take a look at a few things.
158.88s: The first thing is I want to show you some data.
160.44s: This is from the past 10 years of quadruple liching cycles.
166.84s: And if we look in 2023, the dates for these, we have March 17th, June 16th, September 15th,
173.00s: December 15th.
174.00s: So again, you can kind of be a trend there, right?
176.64s: 16th, 15th, 17th, third Friday of the month.
179.48s: So we'll see what date that typically falls around.
183.20s: And then you can see obviously we're just confirming these months.
186.56s: So what this is actually looking at is the S&P 500 performance for each of these five
191.36s: days before on the day of five days after.
194.12s: I also look at that for the VIX.
196.32s: This isn't really designed to be parsed through one by one.
199.48s: I've aggregated it for you here.
202.48s: And again, for anybody that's in the Patreon, you can download these.
205.84s: I'll throw a post and then for those that are not, you can just grab a screenshot.
209.92s: Now this is kind of the summary and what matters a little bit more.
214.04s: So you can see again, we have those same things.
215.68s: S&P 500 and the VIX five days before on the day of five days after.
219.96s: We have the average percent move, the percent positive moves, percent negative moves, max
224.64s: and min percent moves.
226.96s: Now the S&P 500 for essentially around the event, it doesn't really move that much.
232.08s: It doesn't care quite a lot.
234.60s: What we do see that is kind of important is the number of positive events for the S&P 500
242.52s: before is statistically significant, 70.83% of the time.
247.36s: But this can also be attributed to other things like positive drift.
250.56s: So it's not necessarily quadruple, which yields this.
254.56s: It's not so much the case.
255.56s: And we could do a little bit of a deeper study to control for that hypothesis.
259.84s: None of it really matters that much.
261.52s: I'm just giving it to you for some general data points.
264.76s: Then on the day of the S&P 500 actually has more negative days than positive.
271.08s: And the average move is 0.38% negative.
276.36s: So on the day of, we typically see the S&P 500 contract a bit and then five days after,
282.96s: we actually still have a little bit of a negative skew, but overall positive average return.
287.84s: Again, that just means that the positive moves are bigger than the larger occurrence of
293.00s: negative moves.
294.48s: So positive drift, very large.
297.72s: In terms of direct, tradable event, here the main things would be five days before on
301.92s: day of, you can come up with a simple hypothesis or you could try to trade the volatility.
306.96s: So then you can also take a look again at the VIX metrics.
310.20s: One thing I notice here that's actually very interesting is five days before we see
315.28s: the VIX tends to move down and that generally aligns with the normal relationship between
322.12s: the S&P 500 and the VIX, S&P 500 very frequently when it goes up, the VIX will go down.
326.56s: Not always, there's always exceptions and funny enough there's an exception baked into
330.36s: this.
331.36s: If you look on the day, even though there are more negative days for the S&P 500, the
337.36s: VIX also tends to contract.
339.84s: So this very commonly is due to the market is seeing a slightly heightened fence coming
347.72s: into the event potentially.
350.12s: Then during the event itself, it's not necessarily producing a whole lot of fireworks.
355.24s: So then volatility also will contract even though the S&P 500 has a very, very small
360.80s: down day on average.
362.68s: So the impact to you as a trader is kind of simple.
366.88s: You should be aware that it exists.
368.88s: Your positions likely depending on the position, not likely to be blown up because of this.
374.88s: This isn't something that should freak you out, scare you, anything like that.
378.52s: You should simply be prepared for increase market volatility, potentially increase in market
384.36s: volume.
385.60s: We also might not want to trade a whole bunch on the day because as volatility tends to increase,
391.80s: bit-ask spreads will widen out a little bit.
394.12s: But again, it's not that big of a change.
396.68s: So it really doesn't matter a ton.
399.92s: The way I look at this is this is kind of like a secondary force at this point.
403.40s: Markets have become way more efficient.
405.04s: As you go through this data, you'll actually see that the impact decreases as we get closer
410.20s: in time.
411.20s: So it used to be kind of a bigger deal back in the day, fewer explorations, bigger deal,
415.48s: not so much now.
417.24s: Still something to be aware of, but not a massive driver.
421.04s: So as always, if there's any other follow-up questions you have on this or want me to
423.76s: take a look at, I am happy to be an outlier.
426.60s: See you guys later.
