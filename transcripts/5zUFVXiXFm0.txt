160.00s: you
162.00s: you
166.00s: you
168.00s: you guys
170.00s: should be able to hear me
172.00s: let me know
174.00s: if there's any
176.00s: issues
178.00s: on the mobile setup
180.00s: so stuff isn't exactly
182.00s: how I typically roll
184.00s: but okay cool
186.00s: great thank you
188.00s: you
190.00s: oh wow that's actually pretty quick to
192.00s: I did turn down the
194.00s: like the kilobytes per second that I'm sending through just to try and
198.00s: keep the frame rate up so
200.00s: if there's any issues that pop up let me know but
204.00s: we are a few hours north of
208.00s: anchorage
210.00s: we are quite literally in the middle of nowhere
212.00s: like the nearest anything to us is about an hour away
216.00s: so we're right outside of Denali
218.00s: we've been
220.00s: having a super cool time
222.00s: super thankful
224.00s: this whole thing always reminds me of
226.00s: the cool part
228.00s: about
230.00s: having
232.00s: a little
234.00s: because you get to do
236.00s: fun things so
238.00s: the purpose of the screen today is really just to catch up with you guys to see if anything is top of mine. There was a couple of questions that I got in the discord
242.00s: that I want to talk about we'll take a quick look at the market I'm not going to spend a ton of time
248.00s: going through like the market out looking what not just because again like I'm traveling in my
254.00s: trading activity especially for this year
256.00s: has slowed down tremendously
258.00s: however if there's any trades that you have on that you want to talk about if there's any
264.00s: underlines that you want to take a look at
268.00s: we can talk about that so this is really designed to be a little bit more of the exactly what the title sounds like a little bit more of a hangout just conversational
274.00s: talking about whatever is top of mind
278.00s: for you guys
280.00s: and it's awesome
282.00s: to see everybody so as usual I'm seeing
284.00s: Reese I see Kirk I see Reggie I see Zaddy Lauren
290.00s: ZX
292.00s: absolutely great to see everybody
294.00s: Reese says shit's crazy boring
296.00s: no-vol in the volume yeah
298.00s: night again we've talked about this a little bit but this is just absolute standard fair coming into the end of the year pretty much
306.00s: most people that are trading are doing exactly what I'm doing right and it's spend time doing whatever
312.00s: you're doing traveling a little bit so
314.00s: there really is a pretty massive downturn
318.00s: in overall
320.00s: trading activity of note though
324.00s: is caught my eye a couple times I was actually reading a couple papers about volatility but this we have now reached
332.00s: absolute compression
334.00s: of all so before we I'd spoken with my community a little bit and we do like a market prep on some days
342.00s: just to get in the habit of looking at markets and one of the things a week ago
346.00s: people were talking about was the fact that they felt that vol was compressed
350.00s: and one of the things that I pointed out is I actually didn't at that point
354.00s: depending on what time frame you look at I actually viewed it that we were a little bit more in a transitory period
360.00s: and you can see that because again about a week ago
364.00s: we're sitting you know at like the the 15 handle we finished the transitory phase and now we're
372.32s: clustering in like the mid 13's if we look for a longer ton of context this is freaking low
380.00s: this is really low
382.00s: where below the one standard deviation channel as you might expect and if we zoom out a little bit further
389.28s: as always get a little bit more context this is the part that's kind of interesting
394.72s: is on a longer term time frame we're not quite as skewed as I think people sometimes might think
400.64s: we are just because of the recent volatility that we experienced right we can see from earlier this
405.92s: year when we had that pretty profound that I mean the stock market ran into a bear market during
411.12s: this period so this was a decent move and then over here from last year
416.56s: Vol is still overall declining but believe it or not is low is Vol is right now
425.60s: I absolutely believe we can go even lower still like I do not believe that we are at the actual
433.20s: lows yet which is kind of wild to say because of how low things are I did catch a couple
439.60s: news bites today about Trump saying you know that he had a good conversation with Zelensky
446.24s: which that overall is good to see a little bit of progression there I'm not exactly sure how far
452.40s: we've come but I do want to spend a little time looking at that right now in case we're wondering
459.60s: we're in like the super super cool cabin it's like a three story cabin it used to be some
465.92s: some park thing and there's like this really fun elevator but I am looking at the weather
473.12s: and right now it's about zero degrees Fahrenheit and super windy so I haven't even really been
478.80s: able to fly the drone but I'm looking outside at the trees because I definitely do want to put the
483.36s: drone up all right let's take a quick look at what's coming up for the week is from an economic
490.80s: lens and then I will get into some of the questions that I got in the discord and whatnot for a
499.44s: conversation so for this week what is this no I don't want your notifications for this week it will be
507.84s: pretty quiet now the meeting minutes are coming out on Tuesday I don't think there's any sort of
514.80s: big potential move here and as always we can fact check ourselves we could take a look at
519.52s: what volatility is saying which we will do but I'm not expecting you know any sort of huge
525.60s: catalyst this week is really really quiet right you can see on Wednesday there's a couple small
531.36s: things jobless claims mortgage rates mortgage rates not really going to impact much in jobless claims
536.48s: have been quite static so I think across the board when we look at where we sit in the market right now
542.32s: it really does seem like pretty quiet I don't see a lot of high volatility items on the horizon
554.64s: which is exactly why this time of year is literally perfect for conducting your annual after action
562.08s: reviews because it because it is so quiet because there really isn't a whole lot going on now let's
568.80s: take a quick look at SPX I just want to take a look at the ball surface and see specifically term structure
576.48s: if there's any sort of expectation and not really right if we take a look at
583.44s: where at 10% or tomorrow 10.13 11% for the 31st and then back down to 10% so I mean this is
595.60s: notably higher than the others by about 10% but it's so low already that I really wouldn't read
602.72s: a whole lot much into this. Nascar says if you look at the log scale of dow over the last 100 years
610.64s: we are a whole lot are there any similarities 1982 to 2000 to what we are in now.
618.40s: Let's take a look I think the problem with those really long-term time frames is it really is
623.52s: so difficult in my opinion to draw like any sort of strong conclusions specifically because
630.88s: there's so much structural change that I struggle with that argument of like these broader
639.76s: super long-term patterns so here's what I mean if we look at the world what the world was doing
645.12s: a hundred years ago and then if we look at what the world is doing now and we chart the difference
650.56s: over those two time frames I struggled to say like a hundred years ago or even what was happening
658.00s: fifty years ago is even like partially relevant so what we're seeing now that's again a
666.88s: pure opinion I've done a lot of statistical analysis on comparing different time frames rolling
672.40s: time frames overlapping time frames and there are absolutely anomalies that that will pop up
678.40s: but I'm not positive that it's super predictive but nonetheless absolutely happy to take a look
683.52s: at a sheer curiosity so let's take a look I think trading view actually might be easier
692.72s: than using think or swim for this so let me see if I can log in super quick
700.96s: and then we could take a peek there I just think they're they're charting especially for like
705.84s: super long-term time frames like this will probably be a little bit easier and then we need the
713.52s: do we want to use futures are you looking at futures or you're looking at the index itself
722.72s: which are what are you using to take a peek at
728.96s: because I don't even know futures could be kind of interesting
736.88s: normally first stuff like this I would use the index out right
741.84s: okay so you're looking at DJI
744.32s: all right what's on this sure okay let me pull this over
754.88s: just want full screen view and we're going out
762.00s: oh shit we're going out of fucking eternity so we'll just click to all
768.80s: and then you said you're looking at monthly time frame which is here and then I don't know how to
774.80s: try this one until log scale do you guys? I haven't fucked up back here I can't figure it out
783.12s: quick I'll look at it let me just look at it real fast I'll be a little faster
787.68s: I'll do I make a trading new chart log scale right click and then
803.12s: long rhythmic there we go oh that's easy enough okay so NASCAR talk to me about what you're
812.16s: seeing here you're saying about a hundred years ago so that puts us kind of in here and
827.92s: I honestly I'm not really seeing it
832.24s: because there's yeah I don't really see it
845.36s: VRB says talk at hundred years cycles yeah I think that's what NASCAR is talking about he was saying
849.52s: that he was kind of noticing some interesting relationship between like dow from you know the
856.32s: 20s to where we are now but I'm not personally seeing even with the overall volatility and whatnot
865.92s: the overall volatility looks very different to me which is again exactly what I would expect to see
873.44s: I think just to reiterate that broader point one of the most important things to pay attention to is
879.28s: like history has a lot of commonalities but technology really is a massive disruptor
886.48s: even in terms of the size of the moves that we see on average which is really interesting so for
892.80s: example one of the things I've noticed is that in the near term meaning you know the last five to 10 years
899.28s: intraday volatility has gone up quite a lot like measureably so but overall market volatility
905.76s: a longer term timeframes especially when you start going back to century plus is actually contracted quite
912.72s: a lot NASCAR says look around June 95 oh hold on did you say a hundred years ago am I fucked up
921.92s: oh you're saying over the past hundred years sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry I misunderstood you I'm sorry
927.28s: so then look around June 95 okay I see what you're saying sorry I was looking let's zoom in a
934.32s: little bit then let's go in here to like 19 so what do we see in 95 yeah I mean I guess you could say
947.52s: that this doesn't look that dissimilar from this but I also honestly think you could find
953.12s: probably hundreds of points on this chart that we could say the same thing for
959.36s: like this doesn't look that dissimilar yeah so I guess I'm not sure I also again to be completely
971.68s: transparent I don't spend a lot of time doing like super super long term analysis like this exactly
978.40s: for what I was just talking about is like the catalyst's market structure I mean it even if we
984.24s: took and look in terms of regulatory changes from the late 90s to now there's quite a lot so yeah who knows
992.08s: I definitely don't I don't see anything in here personally that's like super striking the other
997.04s: thing that I will also mention because I always take the opportunity to do so is I hate the doubt I
1002.32s: think the doubt is so stupid the doubt is using the underlying price to figure out the waiting versus
1008.32s: like market cap or something more logical I really hate the doubt I just I think it's so stupid but
1015.52s: anyways I do appreciate you bringing it up I'm always happy to take a look at stuff like this it is
1019.60s: always fun to to poke through and see different periods and time and again I do agree like I can
1026.16s: see like this doesn't look all that dissimilar to this but I think from a scholastic perspective
1033.12s: the important thing is not to try and find periods that match what's going on now but then to look
1040.32s: in mass and see how frequently throughout this time frame that other periods match what we see now
1046.88s: and if we do that my guess is it would be pretty strong like I think there's probably a ton of
1052.08s: periods that will look similar to this very just grinding the up movement yeah okay so I want to talk
1061.92s: about I think there was two questions that I saw in the discord and I will take a quick look I'm
1070.64s: going to close a couple things down just because it looks like this things oh there we go okay so one
1077.36s: question is from Pune and I released a video today for those that haven't seen it is really about
1086.72s: trading options in low volatility environments that's the that's the whole point of the video today
1092.88s: and Pune says I could use help with some bar chart scanning finding opportunities I am into some
1099.12s: late stage continuation profit mechanisms with long calls on gold silver platinum which definitely
1104.72s: I would consider that late stage for sure unsure how much for these might go other than the TQs
1110.08s: coverage range yeah so the I mean I I don't really have like some sort of strong opinion on like
1116.88s: bar chart scanning per say for this kind of stuff but I think if you watch the video you'll
1126.88s: inherently come up with some ideas so let me I'll grab the video really quick and then we'll we'll
1132.56s: poke through some some spots in it for us one sec let me open this bad Larry up okay
1145.12s: and
1148.96s: okay so the video here what we're doing is looking at different methodologies
1161.84s: to trading volatility when it is low so in here I go through a couple different ways to think about it
1170.72s: so the for Pune the way that you build scanners for this is just by kind of reasoning through
1177.84s: ways to find stuff that look interesting to you for these so for example earnings place right
1183.44s: that's a super easy one we just open up in earnings calendar and we see what's coming up
1189.36s: and that one's easy enough right we have effectively what three or four profit mechanisms
1195.44s: that we can tie directly to earnings we have
1199.52s: wall expansion into the release wall contraction post release gaps on day of release
1205.44s: post earnings announcement drift so there's really four different things that you can trade
1211.12s: around earnings place so that's an example of one relative volatility you would have to come up with
1218.48s: some sort of scanning protocol for looking within an option to change so you would want to find
1223.92s: ways to search for steepness catalysts that one's a little trickier because sometimes a lot of the
1230.96s: catalysts will be known but then a lot of times they won't be known which means that it'll be
1236.32s: something that is like a corporate announcement where there's not some sort of like schedule coming out
1241.60s: for it but there's two ways to think of this a great example is the MSOS trade so
1247.20s: there was a trade that I had in MSOS where I was looking just for elevated wall and the way that
1256.96s: I found that wall was by running some basic you know wall scans looking at implied versus realized
1264.48s: and stuff like that and then I find things like this that had quite a bit of wall price then so then
1272.40s: the smart thing to do from there is to you know ask yourself some questions like hey why is this wall
1277.92s: here what do we think that this wall might be like that kind of stuff I didn't really bother with
1282.48s: it because it was just a pure wall play but if I cared about that kind of stuff what I would do is I
1287.44s: would look up the names right I would say well what's what's the deal here and for MSOS there is a
1293.76s: pretty significant catalyst on the horizon with an expectation of a federal court ruling coming out
1301.92s: weighing in on the classification of cannabis and then what ended up actually coming out
1310.48s: that shocked the market even more was Trump came out in made a statement so you can find stuff like that
1316.88s: by one of two ways either paying attention to individual industries looking up for upcoming
1323.52s: you know cases upcoming statements related to policy preferences stuff like that the other thing
1333.92s: that you can do is look for things that are moving a lot and figure out why so a good way to do
1343.04s: that is really simple we're did my other window girl one sec let me find this window
1349.92s: what we can do is use literally anything that gives you a easy place to find stuff that's moving
1358.48s: along I think I got to sign into this you know and so yeah I do
1368.64s: okay and
1371.28s: along I'm just at the adequate to bring some of this okay okay so let's take a quick look here
1386.56s: and if we look at things that have moved a lot so fget I'm gonna move this off to the side just so
1392.88s: that I can go through a little quicker if I type in fget my expectation is that there will be something that
1399.92s: that went on don't know exactly what but we will we'll see and it's not gonna be
1407.92s: actually difficult to see whatsoever things that have these big massive moves generally speaking
1414.88s: are going to occur wait a minute anti Robinhood hold on hold on
1421.36s: oh yeah what is this is this Robinhood the company I hate Robinhood oh then this is this is different
1437.44s: man that got me so excited for no reason I thought trump for whatever reason was going to say
1443.28s: that he didn't like Robinhood the company and I was going to say fucking here here big dog
1448.40s: but it's not it's completely different what a tease anyways let's see what's going on with this thing
1454.48s: clearly something happens I don't all over the place really think about it let me scroll down here
1462.80s: and let's see what's up
1468.00s: recent IPO so just general post IPO so it's a good like this is a great example
1478.32s: this is literally a perfect example right so this thing just came IPO and then we're seeing volatility
1484.64s: being absolutely insane so this gives you an idea right out of the gate that hey there's a ton
1491.60s: of interest in this it's all over the place people clearly don't know how to price this thing yet
1496.80s: so I'm not sure if it has options yet it does so I mean there's your first place to start looking
1502.64s: right so that's the thing that I want to connect you to there is the way that I find this as a
1506.64s: catalyst is by looking through and finding stuff that's moving so for Pune to summarize some of
1511.84s: those points you really just got to sit down and think a little bit right about those four things
1517.76s: that I outlined in the video and then the next step is to sit down and ask yourself how might this
1523.84s: manifest and where might I see it and that's literally it you'll come across a bunch of ideas now again
1531.36s: remember a big part of trading is spending time looking at stuff not everything conversely the
1537.84s: majority of stuff that you're going to look at isn't necessarily going to be something that's
1542.24s: super useful and I feel like sometimes especially retail traders that do a lot of research I think
1549.92s: sometimes you can forget that meaning retail traders especially those in our community they want to
1555.36s: be as efficient as humanly possible which is smart but there is still a certain amount of like
1562.80s: healthy research that isn't going to pan out and again the majority of the research you're going
1568.88s: to do is going to be like that so the reason why that ties to this conversation is you've got to just
1574.00s: sit down and jot ideas out and say how do I think this thing might manifest and just jot them out
1579.12s: and then figure out how you can look for them so if you have any specific examples of an
1585.12s: idea that you have happy to talk about that and see how we can you know thanks for it together but the
1591.12s: most important part there is just doing that exercise of sit down and based on those four ideas that
1598.40s: I gave you even to start because the other thing to remember is like those four ideas that's not
1602.64s: all of them that's literally just a handful to begin with there's way more than that so
1609.52s: once you figure out what you think it might materialize as then you figure out how you might see it
1618.24s: then you start building a scanner if the the research question starts from the place of oh I think
1624.56s: these are some nifty ways to find little vol how do I build a scanner right like we haven't shrunk
1630.16s: down the problem set enough into something consumable and navigable okay next one
1637.12s: that I saw in here I think this one is from Midlitch so Midlitch had asked me among your strategies
1645.28s: how many and how much percentage of capital or risk are exploiting market inefficiencies in how many
1653.68s: how much are farming well known risk premium and effectively I responded to that is I don't really
1660.00s: buck it things like that so I couldn't say for how I trade it's really a sliding scale based on what
1665.52s: the market is doing and then they had a follow up if you don't buck it things in this manner why is that
1672.40s: I feel like it's a lot of quantitative trading obsesses over this distinction and for what I've
1678.80s: seen there's quite a bit of difference between both so for Midlitch the reason for this is because
1687.28s: I really spend most of my time trying to look at what the market is doing and then looking for
1694.24s: opportunities within the market so what that means is I don't open up my platform and say how
1700.64s: do I find risk premium how do I find inefficiencies that's not the way that I approach the problem
1707.20s: set at all I start the question from what's the market doing what is my portfolio have
1714.24s: is existing positions and where do I see opportunity sometimes that opportunity might lean more
1722.96s: heavily into risk premium sometimes in inefficiencies sometimes it might be really neither of those
1730.48s: those aren't the only two market factors that exist I guess I mean I guess technically they could
1736.32s: be depending on how serious you take the term inefficiencies but then risk premium would fall under
1741.84s: inefficiencies if we're being that literal so anyways the the main point to that in Midlitch I don't
1747.92s: go through on the stream but for you the the reason why I don't bucket it that way is because
1754.48s: that's not the way that I look at the market I have strategies that allow me to take advantage
1760.40s: of pretty much any market condition so then my job is to look at my portfolio and figure out what
1767.68s: kind of risk I may want and then either scanning for that specific risk or if I don't have a
1778.80s: specific risk but I just want to use more capital then I'm scanning for whatever looks the most
1786.48s: appetizing to me so I don't really care how much of the portfolio is doing one or the other and
1793.28s: it's also because I don't break down my strategies that way I break them down as I've discussed
1798.64s: before until I cord speculative and then within that each strategy typically attacks a profit mechanism
1805.92s: and a sub profit mechanism so I'm looking in there normally so it's a good question okay and then I
1812.80s: think somebody from the chat had mentioned that they wanted to look at a stock where is it?
1823.28s: I S R G yeah let's take a look at ISR G so it looks like they're saying for an earnings play
1830.08s: ISR G okay so for I S R G they don't have earnings for a bit there earnings isn't until the
1842.80s: 22nd so realistically speaking I would have absolutely no opinion on it I we would need to wait
1850.72s: sometime in order for me to even come up with any sort of opinion it's just way too far out
1858.80s: now that being said what we can do is take a quick look at prior releases and just see if anything
1865.12s: looks interesting from that lens but yeah with stuff like this it to me at least it's not even
1872.72s: really worth doing some sort of deep earnings analysis I would have to also plug this in to see what
1882.72s: I think of it but I don't hate it yeah I don't hate it it's just so early so I can't really I
1892.96s: can't really weigh in otherwise but I don't hate it at first glance I wouldn't call that thing like
1898.32s: some sort of immediate know or anything like that it definitely requires a little more digging I think
1906.16s: but it doesn't jump out of me it's like terrible. Nascar says DJ IA is such a historical index
1915.44s: tracking the stock market starting in 1896 it's just the OG index yeah definitely is and the the
1921.92s: cool part about the dial is for a one time it did really what it needed to do but yeah the issue
1927.68s: obviously with like using price is just so arbitrary it doesn't really even mean anything so
1935.12s: that part I really don't understand why they don't just switch it to be something more logical
1942.40s: it's actually like the fact that it's a little bit smaller I like that you know the the dial
1947.36s: has what like 30 names or something like that in it it's way smaller than S&P and Nascar which that
1952.56s: part I think is actually very cool but yeah other than that I think pretty much that's the only
1961.60s: spot where any cool stuff exists about the dial I I don't hate the dial as much as Robinhood but I do
1968.80s: hate the dial I think it's stupid. All right what else you guys want to take a look at what's
1976.00s: interesting to you guys I'm gonna poke through the news while we talk and see what's interesting but
1983.92s: there's any stocks you want to take a look at and feel like that I need to take a look at some
1988.24s: of my positions but I will do that and then just probably post an update for the for the
1996.08s: problem members but right now the really just isn't that much going on the the Portfolio's
2000.72s: general and holding pattern right now what I'm doing is seeing what the market is
2005.76s: generally been doing in terms of premium and S&P index more broadly and I mean I'm not really seeing
2015.28s: much there's been some absolutely insane activity in SLV and SLV has been going haywire
2027.68s: what the fuck was that the whole house just shocking I know idea why SLV I mean take a look at this take
2040.48s: a look at this move this has been just an absolutely absurd move in SLV and I think the metals
2052.72s: themselves the most interesting thing about this is that there's a fucking ceiling man like there is
2058.88s: a limit of what people will pay for this shit so the the way that I look at this is I missed this
2065.60s: entire up move I have very little going on in here but what I look for is actually a reversal
2075.52s: whenever this thing does eventually decide to snap back down to earth that's when I get really
2084.40s: interested but when something is rolling this caotically and just this strong I just sit and watch
2093.44s: especially like I said I just I just I legit do not have much risk in here so yeah we will
2105.20s: well rise this and keep going off let me fucking up close prices out of below it's not below that
2114.80s: I have no idea why this thing's being so lame look at that 9% on the day
2122.96s: absolutely absolutely insane let's see if this works so it's gotta be something buggy with that
2130.80s: let's just do mark
2137.04s: strength let's take a look at the vault oh my god look at that 142% that is absolute madness
2154.64s: I cannot believe that of freaking metals are doing that I'm logging into moon tower because my
2165.60s: buddy Chris has a really really really cool weight of you this stuff and I want to take a look at this
2175.76s: in there so let me grab SLV
2184.16s: and we'll take a look at this thing
2192.80s: all right
2197.68s: she's surprised I mean this is
2205.84s: this is absolutely insane
2208.24s: look at this like the vault pretty much across the entire freaking structure is a wire
2221.44s: the 90 day looks interesting to me because the 90 day just hit max and then we can see the
2227.20s: parture happening here in the 180 day ball that's actually very very interesting but take a look at
2234.32s: the term structure this is quoting 86 for seven day and 84 let's see real quick how that lines up
2242.48s: here so for seven day again this is it's an interpolation so it looks like it might be a little
2249.28s: high but that's gonna use the at the monies versus most of the chain like the other tool so
2255.36s: I think I mean that makes sense and let's take a look at oh my god look at that
2268.64s: it's it's insane so not only is the risk premium insanely high but the realized moves are still
2281.28s: continuing to cluster at these highs I probably wouldn't want to trade a lot of
2289.28s: fallen silver for those that don't know I already traded it once and I got ran over just because
2293.92s: this window a little bit I traded it once and I got I got absolutely ran over I mean
2303.92s: not gonna be dramatic because it's kind of funny but I managed it pretty quick just because of how
2308.64s: fast silver was moving but there will absolutely be an opportunity in here I am more in the camp
2317.12s: of waiting until it starts to reverse a little bit because it will happen even if it's not a
2325.52s: ton like if you take a look at this move here from here to here that's still 16% over two trading weeks
2333.36s: that is decent money especially on something like this where you have to you have to think like
2339.84s: at some point at some point people are just gonna say silver is literally just not worth that
2346.16s: much fucking money and there's compression and stuff going on right now there's supply disruption
2352.40s: so there's a lot of artificial things that are happening here and this is actually a great example
2357.60s: of catalyst style trading because if you pay attention to for example precious metals and you wait
2365.20s: until you see some sort of news about production coming you know back online or coming
2372.32s: online faster because a big thing is production is ramping but it's just like several years out
2377.76s: it doesn't ramp that fast like those are the kind of catalyst that can cause movement really really quick
2383.52s: the way to think about something like SLV is right now this thing is like it is extended like a rubber band
2392.32s: and the further this thing goes from at least some semblance of normal the harder that thing will
2399.44s: snap when it eventually at least has a down tick now that doesn't I'm not calling or expecting
2406.24s: some sort of crash I don't necessarily think that again unless conditions change massively
2412.32s: but I also do not think that this kind of move is going to be super sustainable that's my baseline
2421.20s: if you take a look at where the close is from the 200 day 75.6% above a 200 day
2433.04s: for those that don't know of really interesting ways to measure momentum is by measuring the distance
2440.40s: off of different kinds of moving averages and longer term moving averages so that's one of the
2445.76s: measurements that I'll use as a general proxy or severity of moves the summation for that is
2452.48s: that that's bucking insane for something like this in vault literally just doesn't get higher
2459.44s: so one idea though is if you're feeling froggy and you want to trade vault you can do that
2467.60s: I would be really inclined to try and look across the curve and to figure out where I think the
2475.20s: vault is price the richest relative to its moves so we can use something like this and we can say
2486.00s: across different timeframes how much the movement looks like against different durations
2495.44s: so I have to imagine that most of it is going to be pretty
2504.80s: pretty fucked but there will be pockets so a good example of like those pockets is like here
2511.92s: 180 days out which is a lot it also looks like seven days is coming down a bit same thing for
2517.68s: 14 days like that stuff right there in the front but you're going to be picking up a ton of
2523.44s: so you have to again pick your poisons you can run stuff with like calendars here I definitely
2530.72s: I mean the cool part is is silver is small enough the ETF at least is small enough
2536.32s: that you don't necessarily have to spread off your risk but if you're in a smaller account
2541.36s: definitely makes sense to do so the other thing to remember though is with something like SLV
2546.96s: is that it is not a European style option so what that means is if you're short and up in the
2554.08s: money there's a good chance that you'll have to or you'll want to at least manage the trade
2560.32s: so that you don't get assigned on one of the legs and then have to deal with that again you're still
2565.36s: covered it's not a big deal but you have you know the residual position available
2572.64s: to cover it can just be more of an annoyance especially if you hold that kind of thing through
2578.00s: expiration that sometimes can screw people so yeah to summarize all of that I wouldn't be super
2585.20s: interested in trading ball right now when ball is this high this typically actually is not a
2589.68s: great time to trade it it's going to be closer to fair value and the realized moves are so high
2596.00s: I would wait until the realized moves start to trickle down to give at least a little bit of an
2602.48s: opportunity but right now with realized moves expanding this much even though in 30 day
2609.20s: ball there's still risk premium that doesn't help overcome the trending element of price so not only
2617.92s: are the realized moves coming up but price is generally trending in one direction which will still
2623.76s: even if the realized moves remain lower than implied the cascading effect of momentum in one
2632.24s: direction will still hurt you so yeah I still be as been absolutely nuts okay still paper trading
2638.56s: which is awesome by the way what a great name says what about GLSI let's take a look what we got here
2645.68s: green which life sciences it's been moving up a couple days now curious about it the low volume
2651.68s: with fast price up yeah yeah that actually is good eye by the way because I completely agree with you this is
2661.04s: well okay a couple things the volume actually isn't that low when I look at it now more in detail
2668.40s: the reason why I say that is because the volume is much lower than the catalyst whatever this was on
2673.68s: the 15th there's a catalyst of some sort we could figure out what that was I don't know what it was but
2677.92s: something okay so there was a drug that showed 80% reduction in breast cancer again notice notice what I just
2688.48s: did there I don't know this stock and as soon as I see this if you rewind and heard what I said
2696.24s: there was a catalyst here I know that I don't know what it was but I know that there was one here
2701.60s: do I know what's certainty no but 98% confidence interval that there was a catalyst here and there was
2709.28s: now this is tied to a breast cancer drug the thing to keep in mind though is that even though this
2715.28s: volume is astronomically high and is probably skewing your perception all of this volume in here is
2722.40s: also very high it's again just your perception that's skewed so for example the volume on this
2730.96s: day here that I'm hovering on is 585,000 shares where the 20 day average is 322,000 which takes into
2741.76s: account this so if you go back prior to that which is going to skew the numbers a lot the average
2748.96s: volume for the day before that for 20 period was 80,000 and the five day period is 141,000 and again
2757.92s: going back to this it's 585 so the volume here is actually extremely high it's just not as high as this
2766.24s: so I wouldn't the the only thing I would correct there is I wouldn't look at this and say well prices
2771.20s: going really high on light volume actually going high on really strong volume everything just relative
2780.72s: that said this also tells you that there's a lot of really smart people that know that this
2787.04s: new drug has a significant amount of potential which is leading to this drip this is a perfect
2793.52s: example of information discrepaness and indiscreteness this is information indiscreteness what happened
2800.00s: was a catalyst came out here the new piece of information a phase trial release and effectively
2805.92s: they're saying hey this this drug helps reduce breast cancer which is fucking awesome save the titties
2811.28s: and after that it is taken several days for interested parties to build position and at least
2821.12s: begin to scale in so if we take a look now unfortunately there's no options which breaks my heart
2828.00s: options and stuff like this can be super super interesting but this is in the middle of a breakout
2833.36s: so these kinds of things can be really lucrative realistically if you continue to see the sort of
2841.76s: strength and these are the kind of things at least for me I typically run them is very asymmetric
2848.32s: profit opportunities so what I'm looking for is how much momentum this thing is going to get and then
2855.28s: I'm looking for when it begins to consolidate what is the consolidation look like and then is there
2861.28s: another leg up now the options market typically is really really informative for all of that but we
2867.84s: could see really quick and see if there's I don't know even if this thing will have them because
2876.72s: they don't have options yet that's a bummer I wanted it to take a look at them because I want
2881.60s: to look at their insider transactions and institutional sponsorship so let's see if we can find any of
2889.28s: first we could take a look at insider trading
2897.76s: smaft on the 18s
2902.56s: well my god guys so
2916.32s: I mean they've been scaling into it which is good it doesn't look necessarily as awful because
2925.84s: they've been scaling in but this purchase is a little sauce on 12 18 when we got a 12 18
2940.40s: that's right here maybe that's good actually I give them more credit than that
2947.52s: because it's not before the catalyst so yeah they're just bent on their stock I don't feel as
2954.56s: weird about that that seems okay to me and again bummer that there's no options so
2960.16s: I think here the there's a couple ways that I would look to trade something like this you can either
2966.96s: think of it as a pretty high risk entry and you can look to take an entry as it's in the middle
2974.48s: of this pretty strong parabolic up move again one of the key things that I would really want to see
2980.08s: is institutional ownership let's see if any of these have that because I would want to track
2985.12s: how aggressively institutions are getting in and at what point is it becomes saturated so GLSI
2990.72s: institutional ownership graph and looks like thin tells goddess
2998.96s: oh this isn't okay I wanted to look for a graph so we might have to look for one
3012.96s: let me see if that's that has it for us okay so this is good this is good so from an institutional
3021.84s: lens right people that have more capital this is still early days early days early days
3037.04s: this is cool the reason why this is cool is because when you look at other companies let's take a
3043.68s: look at like apple for example and you look at their institutional ownership you see it's like
3049.12s: literally 65% it's massive but when you look at something like this that is literally single digits
3056.96s: that is super important because that means that there's a lot of potential upside a lot of potential
3063.36s: upside and now we can take a look at what the recent changes have been and let's take a look
3073.12s: so most of them have bought in on this side at least and then let's take a look
3084.96s: black rock trimmed a little bit vian guard went up so there's big names in it too which is actually
3092.96s: really really important so yeah this is this is a really fun name nice job paper trading this is a
3099.04s: really really fun one to come across again I'm a little bum that it doesn't have options but
3104.96s: that part aside the institutional ownership part is good how's the short interest woo that's actually a
3112.88s: little long that's really long that's really really long yeah this is a fun follow the summary for
3125.52s: that in the way that I would think about trading it is either higher risk entry with pretty tight stops
3131.28s: and you'd have to size it really carefully because of how high it is on these candles don't forget
3137.84s: this is still a cheap stock it's only 20 bucks so this day itself is a 20% day so you have to keep that
3144.72s: in mind when you're thinking about building some sort of position even if you place a stop somewhere
3149.84s: you know down here at like this 16 25 handler so that's still a healthy move from where the
3157.60s: stock closed on the day so that's something that you gotta pay attention to the other thing
3162.08s: that I really really wanted is actually like an institutional ownership graph to see how it's evolving
3169.28s: but wait here we go here we go this thing is given it to us perfect
3179.84s: oh no I don't want your fucking cookies dude so scaling up down and it's been up so this is a good trend yeah
3195.52s: this looks interesting to me it's really does look interesting to me especially with that recent
3200.88s: catalyst my guess is you'll actually see the institutional ownership continue to expand again depending
3207.68s: on how strong the the news is on it which I am not gonna pretend to be an expert on you know how strong
3217.04s: the drug is and how effective the drug is but it's very clear that the market likes it for sure
3221.76s: so let's take a look at some of the news around it and let's see see what we can learn about this then
3231.84s: so heavy heavy volume and on Monday it had a phase three trial of flamingo 01 which is a value
3244.32s: leading an immunotherapy to prevent breast cancer recurrences showing in approximately 80% recurrence
3252.08s: rate reduction in 220 patient open labeled non-HLA arm of flamingo 01 this is actually important too
3262.32s: because that's that's not a huge trial that's a small trial I'm sorry it's not a small trial but it's
3268.64s: not a huge trial and reason why that matters is again that gives way more upside potential if like scale
3274.72s: and scope can be demonstrated I'm actually really curious if they'll start offering options on this
3282.96s: that would be really really nice yeah I think that this looks really interesting and this is clearly
3291.12s: institutional sponsorship it doesn't even take that much to move this but the the total market
3297.04s: cap itself is still I mean there's only 13 million shares outstanding so it's a pretty cheap
3303.36s: pretty cheap name but this looks really cool let's take a look at a couple scenarios so a stop
3310.64s: a little here at like 1625 oh no let's do the look at buying shares so this is looking at a hundred shares
3326.24s: now the other thing to keep in mind is again without options markets it's even more difficult because
3331.20s: there's absolutely no no context for any of it right in terms of even trying to figure out
3337.84s: what a distribution might look like so we do see that there absolutely is price activity up here
3343.92s: at like the 30 and a half handle that in my opinion is actually super important because what that can
3350.32s: look like is one of two things it can look like really really heavy selling when we get up towards that
3356.40s: level as people are really interested in getting out at a scratch or break even but the other
3364.48s: thing is that it clearly is traded up at these levels before so I would expect that volume note to
3369.84s: serve as general resistance but this is effectively one of the spots that I would be paying attention
3376.64s: to again just have some level of context on where this thing has been before and at low point
3382.88s: so like even this 30 handle you can see that the bulk of this volume note really starts at like the 35
3388.88s: handle that's what I'm seeing there so I would consider that a little bit of ways to run
3396.48s: for sure but the the risk in the trade is not insignificant especially catching something like this
3403.68s: that already has had its breakout the way that I typically trade stuff like this is a little bit different
3409.36s: it would be a little earlier of an entry just to limit total risk but again I wasn't looking at it so
3416.56s: yeah that's a fun one good find really good find
3421.04s: juicy or oh I'm sorry July I'm sorry July claims is for parabolic stocks like SLV could we consider
3428.80s: a six month flash one year long put where volus lower and give stock time to move how could we improve
3434.88s: the structure the trick yeah let's talk about that it's a great idea and it's a good instinct
3439.04s: so what this person is saying is like hey I think that this thing is high I'm not exactly sure
3444.40s: when it's going to come down but I believe at some point it's going to come down so what if I put
3450.64s: on a trade and give it a bunch of time to potentially work and then give it you know time to work
3456.32s: which isn't a bad idea here's the series of issues with that the first thing is your instinct
3463.20s: to go further out in time is smart but it's also important to pay attention on relative terms
3471.76s: so first things first we don't actually know if vol at six month or one year is actually low
3479.76s: we know that it's lower than the front but we actually do not know if it's low relative to
3485.68s: itself and I'll show you what I mean let's go into here let's take a look at SLV and let's take a look at
3492.24s: the vol if I turn this in terms of a percentile and I get rid of the front explorations
3500.96s: and I look at the further exploration so I'm looking at 90 days, 180 days, stuff in there
3507.52s: what I would I notice is the volatility percentile at those points is literally a hundred percent
3515.52s: so what that means is even though the volatility out there is lower than what you're seeing in the
3522.16s: front it by no means is low relative to that time frame if you have any questions on that please ask
3530.24s: I want to make sure that you understand that because that's like a critical piece to understand
3535.92s: when you're looking at options that's the first thing the second thing is the way that the
3542.48s: trade will behave will likely look different than you might expect so typically speaking when an
3550.16s: underlying goes down you would expect to see volatility contract whereas in something like this you
3555.44s: might actually see I'm sorry if something goes down you typically would expect volatility to expand
3562.08s: except in something like this it might actually contract a little bit so that would very likely
3567.60s: fight against you here especially because you're effectively buying mall when it's the most expensive
3573.28s: it's ever been well that that's dramatic the most expensive it's ever been over the last year
3579.92s: is the correct way to frame that the other thing is this and this is more so the important factor
3588.72s: let's say that we execute this idea and let's say that we go out 180 days or 90 days whatever
3595.84s: what were we saying six months or so something like that yes we'll do like 120 days somewhere in here
3602.56s: we'll go to the April mate doesn't really matter and let's say that we buy a put and let's say
3607.76s: because ball is so high we choose to go deep in the money because we want to decrease how much
3614.56s: x-trends value is in the options to begin with so let's say we go to like the 100 puts that are at
3621.52s: like a 70 delta and let's eyeball this really quick here's what ends up happening with this kind of
3629.92s: trade if you put this on and again let's say that the expectation is that the underlying is
3637.60s: going to go down which is fair the problem that you have here is that if the underlying goes against you
3647.04s: to begin with and then it reverses and eventually starts going down you might not actually make that
3653.84s: much money here's what that looks like if the underlying continues to go up because it's in the middle
3659.60s: of a breakout rally to the upside it just gaped up and then ran like another 20% it's up huge
3665.44s: let's say it continues to trickle up and let's say that it hits like 85 so if it's up here at 85
3673.12s: you're looking at an unrealized loss which you know isn't anything that catastrophic but then
3680.24s: if it does begin to go down what happened in this scenario is you would have lost deltas
3687.84s: so as the underlying that helps you by the way you losing deltas as the underlying goes up means that the
3694.16s: pain slows down but what it also means is that when it eventually reverses you're not going to
3699.20s: participate as fast and we can ballpark what our deltas might have become by making a few guesses we can
3707.12s: say how long do we think that move like take and that kind of thing which we'll we'll do right now
3711.92s: together so spot price right now is about 70 so if it goes you know 15 15 points it's 71 so if it goes
3721.44s: 15 points we would expect to see it at 86 let's take a quick look if we start with the 100s
3732.00s: and then we simulate that 15 point move ish in this case more like 16 points that takes us down here
3742.40s: so what that means is your option that you originally bought for 70 deltas now is 57
3750.32s: so then that means in the beginning if you get a move in your favor you make 70 cents per dollar move
3758.00s: now if you get a dollar move you're only getting 57 cents you're effectively getting half of the move
3764.88s: now if the underlying does begin to trend your direction you will gain your deltas back
3771.52s: but ultimately what that ends up meaning is you miss on the down move that you think you might get
3780.16s: and this is how it works let's say that the underlying continues to trickle up and then you
3786.64s: finally get your down move and let's say that the down move is pretty good but unfortunately let's say that
3791.76s: that down move just gets you back to about where you were before before it begins grinding up again
3798.40s: so in that kind of scenario you can see how you find yourself in a tricky spot where you might
3804.08s: actually get the move that you want but because of timing it poorly and overpaying for fall you
3808.88s: might not actually make anything you might even lose a little bit that's not to say it's a bad idea but
3814.24s: the the more important part is I wouldn't look at going further out in time six months or a
3822.08s: year and say to yourself that removes the burden of timing you still have the time because if you don't
3829.28s: time it well then you're still going to lose money and again you're really really often up
3834.56s: for fall here it's the most expensive it's been in the last year let me know if you have any
3838.80s: follow-ups on that it's a it's a really good idea in the court concept and it's a good way to think
3845.12s: about options but it definitely is one of those things that I think catches a lot of options
3851.36s: traders and then you're kind of looking at yourself saying like what the literal fuck happens here
3857.44s: and obviously we don't want that any questions on any of that and then is there anything else
3866.96s: that you guys want to talk about or take a look at more than happy to it's already been dark here
3873.68s: the sun sets at like fucking three thirty so it's been dark forever we're just going to cook
3879.36s: some dinner they have like a hot they have like wood fire sauna that I got to go start up I think
3885.20s: would you be pretty fun but yeah absolutely happy to take a peek at anything else that you
3892.00s: just want to look at. Jalice says can you please elaborate on your first point relative
3898.64s: ball yes absolutely I'm glad that you asked also how wait how might you make a play on this wait
3904.40s: for a breakdown in a higher time frame market structure yeah okay good follow-ups so
3910.88s: here's the first point reiterated what you're talking about in terms of the cost of volatility
3919.20s: is based on this right so when you're saying ball is cheap six months out out here
3926.80s: ball is objectively cheaper here 62% at the 112 days to expiration right so 62% is much cheaper
3937.20s: than what it is in the front at like 86 84 all of this stuff right much much cheaper however
3945.68s: volatility is relative to the term that you live in so what that means is when we're looking
3954.08s: across time frames like this that's using a time series when we're talking cross-sectional
3963.52s: which is at a point in time looking at each individual expiration relative to itself
3970.80s: we have to ask ourselves a different question so the way to summarize that first part the way
3978.32s: that you're looking at this is you're saying based on a time series looking across the term
3982.56s: this ball is cheaper than this ball that is not incorrect but that's just the first part
3988.88s: of the analysis we have to do the second part of the analysis is we have to say for this specific
3996.56s: expiration the 112 days to expiration this specific expiration how expensive is 62%
4005.60s: ball even those 62% ball is much cheaper than the front that doesn't mean that it's cheap relative
4013.76s: to this 112 day expiration cycle so when we do that and we look at something close to that right
4022.40s: using like the 90 and the 180 constant maturity to give us an interpolation we can see that both of
4030.72s: are at 100% so what that means is the implied volatility for that specific term is literally
4038.64s: the highest it's been over the last year so even though this ball is cheaper right even though the
4047.76s: 90 day the 180 day in this case the 112 day even though this ball is cheaper than the front
4055.60s: it's very expensive relative to itself that's what that means and if you have any more follow-ups
4067.36s: like if that's not clicking please tell me and then we can look at a couple examples and see if that
4073.36s: helps drive the point home but the overview of that is you want to look at volume those two ways
4082.32s: the first way is you want to look at volume across the term structure relative to other terms that's
4088.24s: the way that you looked at originally the second way you need to look at it is within each term
4096.00s: how expensive or how cheap is ball within the individual term at a set point in time that's the
4106.00s: main difference there and then the second in terms of how might I make a play on this I think we
4113.28s: talked a little bit about that earlier but happy to reiterate the main thing I would look for is this
4120.64s: thing to start breaking down that's it I don't try to front run it because it's already higher than
4127.52s: I would have expected it to be so what that tells me is I don't know how much higher it could go I
4133.60s: don't necessarily think it's going to go that much higher and again this is a good example of being
4137.28s: able to use the options markets right to figure out what the market is price man so if we take a look
4143.92s: something a little closer in time let's take a look at like the 19 days and let's close this up a
4151.20s: little bit we can see how the delta's drop off super fast on this call side for the out of the
4160.32s: money's versus the put side and that's a good way to assume or approximate moneyness and you can
4168.80s: also use probability of touch probability than the money but let's take a quick look yeah so
4174.64s: this is within a specific term and this is looking at uh oh did we just drop
4185.28s: are we back
4186.32s: okay are we back it looks like it's okay the the cabin that I'm at they're using starlink
4199.20s: so it seems like it's been pretty good but let me know okay cool thank you recently where did we leave off
4205.76s: we were just talking about delta relative to time now
4219.12s: okay cool so let's take a quick look at what delta how these delta's look for the at the money
4228.96s: and then we'll go out a little bit and then back in actually we'll leave this up for now
4234.32s: and so the at the money's I'm just gonna do the whole strikes so 72, 71, 73 like that kind of thing
4241.36s: so let's take a quick look we'll go how many is this this is 21
4256.00s: here so this is the at the money what I'm gonna do is update this so that it automatically
4269.92s: does the math for us or at least the first part so the at the money here is gonna be the 73's
4281.20s: 73's
4285.68s: and then this should just down there and this would equal plus one
4305.52s: and that'll get us there okay so now what I'm gonna do is just throw into delta's
4311.68s: or a handful of these we don't have to do all of them you kind of don't really need this many
4316.16s: we just need to go out like maybe five and you'll get the the general just of what's going on
4332.88s: but the slope of the delta's actually tells you a lot of information
4341.20s: so I'm gonna move this again off to the side just so that I can go a little quicker and we're
4347.04s: gonna start with the out of the money's here so we'll go to the 74's
4352.72s: 0.48 delta then 45 delta here 42 39 37 34 32 23 28 26 okay and then we'll go the other way
4378.72s: we'll go to the 72's which are at a 54 delta technically is these are literally
4392.40s: this is all by the way skew which is actually really cool like how much of all skew there is
4398.16s: but anyways let's take a look at the 72's which was a 46 delta
4402.88s: then I see 43 delta and I see a 40 delta 38 delta
4418.96s: then the 68 35 delta
4422.80s: 32 delta 29 29 27 24 and then the 63's which are 0.22 okay so this is within a single series
4448.32s: actually what we should do is build this out for two different terms I won't do that now I'll do that
4456.88s: for another time but we'll do delta for term one and then delta for term two but the important part
4465.28s: here is you can see how this slope here is steeper than this slope here what that's intuitively
4474.96s: telling you is what the market is expecting to occur going forward with respect to price and the
4481.52s: other thing that's actually kind of quite telling right now is how the 50 delta is way out here at
4490.08s: the 73 and a half and it's partly because it's literally up again after hours but it's not quite
4496.08s: there yet so the market is also still expecting some positive drift this is just a way that you can
4503.52s: use the options market determine like where you think price might go so if we take a look at the
4508.72s: probability of a touch there's effectively a 51% chance that we touch 81 and then if we take a look
4516.80s: on the other side here and we look at the probability of a touch around 50% which is here that's 62
4523.04s: and a half so this has a slight probabilistic edge because this is closer but it's the same 50%
4533.04s: probability this is further so the market is absolutely expecting a bit of drift continuation
4540.00s: all right and then for the second part a hold on you had a clear clarifying I'm into say if
4545.68s: vol was cheaper not that it is cheaper that is more clear but can you explain how you were able to compare
4552.64s: the vol for a specific term yes so the way that I was able to compare the vol for a specific term is
4559.20s: looking at there's different tools available but the tool from unusual whales is what the
4566.64s: fuck oh it's over here the tool from unusual whales is really convenient so what this is doing is
4573.84s: giving you a constant maturity interpolated vol that's all and then it's plotting what the
4580.56s: vol was for that maturity over the last year and then it's just creating a scale for it
4588.72s: you can do that yourself if you don't have a tool like this it's a little more annoying to do but
4595.68s: it's definitely doable so that's that and if vol was cheaper further out then you relieve the vol
4606.72s: piece meeting in terms of overpaying for vol but you do not relieve the timing piece you still
4614.00s: have to time things well otherwise you kind of set yourself up for problems so that is
4625.92s: that's that who questions though anything else for you guys
4635.60s: this screen which one is super interesting I also remember seeing the swimsuit
4643.92s: yes it's still on like the really aggressive growth date
4651.20s: you
4663.20s: delighted says does bar chart have this I have no idea
4669.20s: that absolutely no clue oh let's see
4674.16s: to be.
4681.16s: And not sure.
4689.16s: Signal OK, so it's a little bit less.
4693.16s: Because this is a little bit less.
4695.16s: Because we're missing out.
4697.16s: Let's take a look.
4701.16s: So this is just giving us a single term.
4704.16s: Let's take a look at the vault charts.
4709.16s: Let's term structure.
4716.16s: This is, well, wait.
4720.16s: All right, hold on.
4721.16s: Maybe it does have it.
4724.16s: Let's go.
4731.60s: Yeah, yeah, it does.
4732.72s: Literally right here.
4734.96s: That's perfect.
4738.36s: It sure does.
4739.84s: So it's not quite as clean
4742.24s: because it would be nice
4744.96s: to be able to do this for multiple terms at once.
4748.80s: That's typically my preferred,
4752.00s: but I'm actually gonna reach out to him right now.
4754.08s: Because I have a buddy at Bar chart
4757.04s: that I actually,
4758.64s: I'm connect with and make videos with,
4761.80s: but I'm gonna shoot him a video, hold on a second.
4770.48s: Quick question.
4773.52s: For the volatility charts on the platform,
4779.24s: you guys have a great plot of IVP for various terms,
4791.08s: a massive improvement for this would be
4796.64s: if you are able to plot multiple terms
4805.76s: at the same time to compare.
4809.48s: IVP of the multiple terms.
4815.48s: Oh, so I will see if he
4822.32s: I needed to take a picture of those though.
4824.88s: I can take a picture.
4825.92s: Yeah, and I'll literally see if they're dev team
4841.88s: and help us out.
4849.24s: So I think I legit think that would be super, super useful.
4856.64s: RL says, do we cover Bitcoin?
4859.60s: I don't think we talked about cryptocurrency.
4863.24s: I take a peek there.
4865.00s: See what's going on?
4865.84s: I do have a coverage triangle in I bit,
4868.56s: so that's where I'm gonna start.
4870.32s: Yeah, great.
4871.32s: This is actually, I say that partially ingest,
4874.64s: but the fact that this is oscillating sideways
4876.64s: is actually really good for me
4878.40s: because it gives the position a little bit of time.
4881.16s: What I don't like is that this oscillation still seems
4884.44s: to be more negativelyening than anything,
4893.48s: which I don't fully love.
4903.64s: Oh, that's a lie.
4907.00s: Because those are effectively having to force fit.
4914.44s: Yeah, so here,
4930.92s: stuff like in a bit of a descending wedge kind of thing.
4935.40s: But,
4936.32s: the consolidation is good.
4944.72s: I don't really like that it's trickling down as much,
4948.40s: but I do like that the flourish trickling up.
4952.20s: So it kinda has some competing elements
4955.04s: for the way that I look at this stuff.
4959.00s: Very mixed.
4961.28s: What I'm doing now is I just wanna see
4962.88s: what the options market looks like.
4967.04s: So it does look like it has some pretty massive call skew,
4971.04s: but I don't know if that's short calls or long calls.
4974.88s: So we can solve for that by taking a look
4980.28s: and seeing,
4986.36s: yeah, by seeing what the, yeah,
4988.44s: so it looks generally bullish,
4990.92s: especially on those calls.
4993.24s: So it does look,
4997.16s: it does look like it's leaning bullish
4999.64s: on the call side of the equation.
5008.88s: This just looks like standard rolling.
5012.36s: Yeah, this is a lot of just general movement.
5016.48s: Nothing.
5022.72s: Nothing that's sticking out to me there.
5027.96s: Take a look here.
5031.48s: And I wanna look at the premium.
5034.52s: Look at the next this light is spashing out behind.
5041.32s: Yeah, so there's definitely a bit of all skew
5043.84s: with respect to premium.
5046.64s: Especially as you get further out in time.
5048.64s: This is clearly a general expectation
5052.40s: of upside recovery at some point,
5059.64s: which at least me literally just makes sense.
5067.28s: Literally just makes sense.
5071.68s: What I'm doing now is I'm looking
5078.64s: to look up to these terms relative.
5080.60s: I don't really wanna be in the right here.
5085.64s: I guess we could, I don't wanna be there.
5091.52s: And I'm just taking a look at the OI.
5097.52s: It just sounds synthetic ones.
5099.40s: And definitely more, yeah, definitely more,
5112.48s: definitely more long call activity
5114.12s: than I would have expected.
5116.48s: So yeah, this looks,
5121.48s: this looks like the market is,
5123.60s: you know, expecting,
5126.04s: expecting upside,
5127.60s: but feel like the difficult part of that is,
5132.88s: when the recent consolidation, I think is good,
5137.88s: but the consolidation as far as I do this kind of stuff
5141.28s: is more just like a condition that you need
5143.32s: before it can start posting a reversal.
5146.32s: The competing interest here is the fact
5149.36s: that the lows are trickling up like this is good,
5152.92s: but what's not good is that the lower high here,
5157.56s: is trickling down.
5160.16s: So I don't love that.
5161.76s: It's actually at a spot where I would be really interested
5165.96s: to see how it behaves there,
5168.12s: and then how it behaves there, like here.
5173.16s: Those are the spots that I would need to see
5176.28s: at break one way or the other,
5177.92s: but for the coverage triangle,
5181.64s: I can tell you what that looks like,
5184.04s: what do we got, what do we got?
5194.60s: Okay, so for the coverage triangle,
5206.08s: I'm pretty much out in 16 Jan,
5209.04s: and the underlying, I'm under water on,
5216.16s: but the option side of the equation
5221.16s: is looking pretty good.
5223.60s: Actually, I need to take some of these down
5225.84s: and glad that we looked at this.
5229.68s: I gotta take some of these down.
5233.72s: And I actually might wanna grab some more shares,
5238.24s: because I'm looking at this.
5242.00s: There's right now my basis is at 56.
5244.88s: I don't know what my utilization is right now,
5246.64s: but I'll have to take a look.
5249.20s: So yeah, I think cryptocurrency though,
5252.96s: the especially just Bitcoin in general,
5256.60s: the volatility has been pretty nasty,
5258.72s: but it really needs to hold
5260.88s: I would consider like this consolidation level,
5263.84s: like pretty bad.
5265.44s: Otherwise, if it does,
5270.32s: yeah, like if it does continue
5275.12s: this downtrend, I think that's pretty nasty.
5284.32s: And this here doesn't look great.
5288.28s: I would really wanna see this low tire,
5294.24s: and I would wanna see this consolidation
5296.68s: at least at level if not trickling up slightly from here.
5301.44s: So if I had to ballpark in terms of all that,
5304.36s: it looks to at least for me,
5306.32s: it looks to favor a little bit more weakness than strength.
5309.56s: But we will see.
5313.08s: Tweet, all right, okay.
5315.60s: Super fun connecting with everybody,
5317.16s: thanks for hanging out and thanks for adjusting
5319.72s: with the time a little bit for us.
5321.32s: I'm gonna go figure out what this fucking light bulb is doing.
5324.32s: And then we're gonna make some dinner,
5326.36s: but got some ravioli on the dock it.
5330.52s: And then tomorrow we're gonna go cruise around to Nali.
5333.64s: Go see what that's all about.
5335.60s: As a ways, if you guys need anything,
5338.00s: you can hit me up in the discord, being outlier.
5341.20s: See you guys later.
