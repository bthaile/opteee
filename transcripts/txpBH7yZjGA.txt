0.00s: Ben using chatchipiti to help with options.
4.20s: It's kinda blowing my mind.
7.32s: Same, bro.
9.00s: Same, Mr. Puzzlehead, underscore, water, underscore, eight.
14.56s: Is onto a really fun topic here,
17.60s: which revolves around the use of chatchipiti,
20.56s: specifically AI more broadly in your trading.
24.48s: And I can say unequivocally,
27.44s: it is the biggest game changer.
29.92s: Or retail trader that's come across essentially
32.28s: since electronic trading.
33.36s: It's that big.
34.92s: So the goal of this video is to walk through this post,
37.40s: see what they're seeing, find some cool things,
40.72s: and maybe some gaps in how they're using it.
43.32s: And then at the end of the video,
44.44s: I'm actually going to walk you through
46.32s: a comprehensive grouping of queries,
50.28s: specific queries you can use in your trading career
55.28s: using AI.
56.72s: So let's get right into it.
59.36s: So he starts off by saying that he's using GPT
62.48s: to help them figure out options traits,
65.32s: and saying that it's been really helpful,
66.80s: which completely agree with.
68.56s: He's saying one of the ways that they'll use it
70.64s: is by typing in a strike price expiration,
72.92s: what I pay target price, and it spits out all the math.
75.28s: It tells me how much profit I'd make in different stock prices,
78.56s: my break even, how much I'd lose per one point drop,
81.00s: stuff like that, stuff I should be calculating,
83.12s: but always don't always feel like doing this,
86.16s: is actually the first problem to be honest.
88.48s: It is completely cool that a model can do this,
91.60s: but if this is the end result,
94.56s: don't feel like doing this is a massive problem,
98.28s: because your job as a trader is literally to do this.
104.08s: There's nothing that says that there's anything wrong
106.20s: with using something to assist you,
108.68s: but there's also limitations when you're using something
111.56s: like chatchipiti.
112.40s: So for example, in your price modeling,
114.68s: you're going to have to account for non-linear changes
119.76s: of Greeks, which is what chatchipiti is going to use
123.84s: linear calculations for Greeks.
126.32s: So if you say two days pass, the stock goes up five points,
130.44s: then chatchipiti is just gonna apply linear movements
133.76s: of the Greeks, and it's a simplifying assumption.
135.40s: It's fine to do in a vacuum,
137.60s: but if you're really trying to take trading seriously,
140.76s: you shouldn't be leaning into chatchipiti to do this stuff
143.56s: because you don't feel like doing it,
145.64s: you should lean into it to teach you how to do it,
148.88s: to teach you different ways to think about it,
151.76s: but if it perpetuates this element of it,
156.60s: that's actually net negative added in my opinion.
160.64s: Next, they're saying that they're starting
162.52s: to upload screenshots of full options chains,
165.84s: and they'll say something like,
170.24s: I don't see what they actually said.
173.24s: I don't see what their prompt was,
175.24s: but here it says, and it actually reads the bit
177.00s: as spreads volume, interest, open interest,
179.96s: IV trends gives back pretty clear answer.
181.92s: Like it will say, this looks like bullish accumulation
184.04s: at the 95 call strike or heavy put volume at the 90,
187.00s: suggest hedging or downside risk.
189.32s: So let's take a look at these.
191.24s: So if we take a look at the 95 call here,
194.92s: and they're saying that they're seeing bullish accumulation.
198.92s: Well, if we take a look at the volume,
200.64s: there's seven contracts,
203.28s: and then if you look at the open interest,
204.72s: there's 514 contracts.
207.36s: Do I as a regular optionist trader,
211.12s: would I consider this bullish accumulation
214.80s: compared to something down here that might have 1069 contracts?
219.80s: Well, probably not,
220.96s: but the other thing is that the volume here is really low.
224.00s: So unless they're looking at some sort of multi-day
226.64s: over-day trend seeing this build out,
229.40s: then it's a different story.
231.44s: So one of the things to keep in mind is when you're using
235.04s: chatchipiti, it will give you inputs and sound
240.08s: super-remly confident,
243.04s: but it will lie directly to you.
245.88s: And I'm not saying that inherently,
247.32s: but this case, there's actually a scenario
248.80s: I'm gonna show you in a few moments that is that for sure.
251.92s: But the other things if we take a look,
253.56s: heavy-put volume at 90 suggests edging or downside risk.
257.76s: So let's go to 90, let's take a look at the put volume.
260.12s: What's the put volume?
262.08s: One.
264.44s: Not heavy at all.
265.88s: So this is the broader point.
267.24s: Now they might be using examples of responses
270.00s: that might give, I would be surprised,
272.28s: instead of just copying and pasting it,
273.68s: it would be easier than typing this out for chatchipiti.
276.40s: So my guess is this is from chatchipiti,
278.44s: and it's wrong, like this is wrong.
280.76s: And there's nothing wrong with giving chatchipiti
284.80s: something like this and saying, hey, like,
286.48s: what do you see here?
288.16s: But again, you have to temper what you're receiving
291.16s: in understanding the models that you're using.
293.84s: So it says it's been weirdly accurate
295.76s: and it helps me avoid sketchy setups
297.24s: or over-priced premiums.
298.76s: This is also tricky, right?
300.64s: Because chatchipiti can't help you
302.44s: with over-priced premiums.
303.48s: There's nothing chatchipiti could tell you
305.84s: to tell you that it premium is over-priced.
309.72s: But reason being is because if you go back
312.24s: to options 101, the only unknown in an option,
316.84s: premium itself is the implied volatility
319.28s: and we implied out.
320.72s: So it's actually the forecast volatility.
323.32s: So unless chatchipiti is providing you
326.04s: with a more accurate, vol number
328.76s: than what the market consensus is, then it's not really
332.44s: helping you.
333.32s: Now one thing you could ask it to do is say,
335.84s: hey, calculate the theoretical value of this option
338.60s: and see what it sets.
339.72s: And if you notice that the bid asks spread
341.76s: is completely off from that theoretical value,
344.24s: then you at least know where you should probably start
346.68s: pinging your trade if you're trying to get in at that point.
350.28s: So over-priced premiums is really, really tricky
353.40s: to identify in this way because it essentially
356.00s: makes the assumption that you can forecast volatility
359.36s: better than the market and some people might say,
361.96s: well, AI can probably do that.
363.52s: I can't.
364.36s: It absolutely cannot.
365.72s: And it's also important to remember
367.84s: from a retail trader lens, AI is not new.
370.56s: It's new to us.
371.72s: We've had it for a few years now
373.44s: and it's growing massively.
375.72s: AI in artificial intelligence and automation
378.88s: has been used for a long time on the institutional side.
382.28s: And they're the people that price
385.00s: fall that we then use.
387.68s: So that's not to say that falls always perfectly priced.
390.36s: You might think that it's going to expand.
392.96s: So meaning it's relatively cheap now compared
394.92s: to your expectations.
396.40s: But that's different than saying something like it's overpriced.
399.52s: That's tricky to arrive at with this.
401.52s: And again, the reason why I'm giving you this level of details
404.12s: because this could mislead somebody.
407.40s: If you take this at face value, you could think
409.60s: that AI is able to do this successfully for you,
413.04s: which is a different story.
414.32s: And again, I'm going to give you a couple of ways
416.20s: to tweak some of these to have a more productive conversation
420.24s: with AI.
422.24s: Next they say, I've also been feeding a charts.
424.40s: So candles, boule and your bands, EMAs, volume breakdown
427.12s: technicals, that's super cool.
428.36s: That's useful.
429.36s: Not generic copy and paste chunk real analysis
431.36s: that I've been decided if I should wait or enter.
432.96s: This is completely reasonable.
435.00s: And you can even code it with what you want to see.
438.80s: And you could ask it to look at a list of names.
442.48s: And honestly, you don't even have to put in the charts.
445.56s: You can typically tell it to look up the chart
447.84s: and it can pull it for you.
449.36s: So you don't even necessarily have to do this step.
452.08s: I used to just follow hyperguess,
453.80s: help me make smarter calls.
454.92s: That's awesome.
456.04s: I think there's a couple things we can do to tighten this up,
458.28s: but literally anything that helps somebody go from this stage
462.08s: of just guessing to being more practical, that's a win.
466.60s: Especially on longer data trades.
468.76s: Not saying it replaces DD,
470.00s: having a second brain that doesn't miss small stuff.
471.76s: That's correct.
472.48s: Now, this is again tricky,
475.16s: because the second brain component completely agree with
478.16s: but it misses tons of stuff.
480.04s: And again, these are like two great examples
482.04s: right here.
482.88s: It's telling us that the 90 strike has hedging or downside
486.56s: risk because of the heavy put volume.
488.04s: The volume is one.
489.48s: That's not heavy.
490.56s: So again, you still have to be the practical thinking
494.16s: elements of this.
495.80s: All right, so let's take a look at a couple prompts
498.28s: that you can use.
499.16s: Now again, this is geared more so for beginners.
501.48s: This is not for your power users.
503.72s: If you're interested in that,
504.84s: we absolutely could do a separate video
506.48s: that really clicks into more heavy utilization of it.
511.48s: This is more so for people that are just looking to get started.
514.24s: So I've broken it down into three buckets.
516.28s: It's not limited to this.
518.00s: This is just a starting point.
519.60s: But things to help you learn,
520.88s: things to help you research,
522.00s: and then things to help you analyze.
523.76s: So you can read these prompts on your own.
525.32s: I'm just gonna grab a couple from each
526.84s: and literally run it through the prompt with you now.
529.16s: So I grab this one.
530.88s: I just learned about XX, give me 25 questions.
534.08s: This is effectively using chatchipT
537.04s: or whatever model you prefer,
539.12s: literally as a learning tool.
541.24s: Now I subscribe to a ton of different models
544.48s: because I find it fascinating.
546.16s: I like learning the differences.
547.72s: ChatchipT is great.
549.04s: And it's like a really solid consistent middle of the road.
552.72s: It's sometimes it'll be really good at something lag
555.20s: and others like right now what I noticed in the model
557.40s: is it's way too friendly, way too agreeable,
560.44s: which is a problem because you want it to be objective.
563.76s: So anyways, back to this,
565.64s: I literally grab this, paste it in,
568.36s: and I kept it as is because I literally kept it
571.04s: exactly as it is.
572.28s: And notice how it prompts back,
573.40s: and it says, sure,
574.64s: but what the hell is XX?
577.52s: And chatchipT is probably going through some
579.80s: not safe for work references if I had one more X,
582.40s: but I didn't.
583.52s: And I was just like, oh yeah, duh,
586.04s: I actually need to give it something.
587.72s: So I just input that we learned about Greeks in options.
592.28s: Give me a quiz.
593.84s: And it literally builds a quiz based on my specifications
598.04s: that I can run through.
599.52s: And I use a mix of different questions.
601.92s: You can mix up even more if you'd like.
604.48s: And then at the end,
605.76s: you can literally answer all of these.
607.80s: So the way that I would go through and take this test,
609.92s: I would say like one is A, two is A, three is A,
614.92s: like that.
616.00s: And then when you get down to the extended responses,
618.32s: the short answer, so 11, delta is the rate of,
624.48s: not ratio, rate of change of premium.
629.04s: Her points change in spot.
634.24s: And so on and so forth,
635.32s: you can literally have it evaluate your responses
638.20s: or you could literally say at the end.
641.52s: It's asking you do you want an answer key.
643.20s: And even if it doesn't prompt you for this,
645.52s: you could say, yeah, build the answer key.
648.92s: And then you can compare your responses against it.
653.52s: So this is useful, really in an educational sense.
657.68s: Now the next one I want to show you is where we move a little
660.60s: bit closer to the research phase.
661.92s: So let's say that you've been learning about the outlier
665.24s: strategy process, which I've a video that goes through.
667.40s: This is just a framework to think about how to build
669.88s: strategies that actually make money.
672.44s: And you're learning about this concept called profit mechanisms,
675.88s: which really takes us into identifying
679.00s: and analyzing specific market effects.
681.28s: And you're trying to figure out what our market effects
683.72s: and how can I try to make money off of them.
686.64s: AI's got your backdog.
688.56s: So if you say something like this and you dump that into chat
693.12s: UPD, it will literally give you an entire starting point.
699.12s: Now again, this isn't comprehensive.
700.84s: But this is saying, help me identify different market effects.
703.72s: And it's saying, well, there's a few things we can do.
706.64s: Now this upfront, notice how this is talking about network
710.84s: effects, economies of scale, because it took out
713.64s: a lot of strategy process completely out of context.
716.00s: It had no idea what the guiding function was.
718.08s: And I left this in here on purpose, because this answer is
720.48s: useless to me.
721.88s: So what you'll notice is in the next iteration,
725.08s: I'm an options trader.
727.72s: So what I'm trying to show you is that you need to be
730.20s: thoughtful about what you give the model.
732.36s: If you give the model what is just occurring in your brain
735.36s: with all the subcontext that you have, the model can't
738.84s: read your mind yet.
740.76s: So you have to give it information in order to help you.
745.12s: So this is a great example of that.
746.52s: So after I corrected it and I said, oh, I'm an option
749.00s: trader looking to apply this.
751.28s: Well, all of a sudden it starts going into different kinds
753.44s: of market effects, inefficiencies, misprison, risk
757.44s: priniya talking about ways to capitalize from theta to k,
761.24s: liquidity, and flow based ideas.
763.64s: Then from here, you can just start double clicking
765.80s: into these.
766.24s: You can say, hey, I want to learn more about dealer gamma.
769.36s: How can I make money from that?
770.96s: Boom, off you go.
771.92s: You're now analyzing a profit mechanism based on an
774.40s: actual thing.
775.68s: Another prompt you could give here is something like, hey,
778.96s: find me peer reviewed research and link to based on
783.56s: this topic.
784.92s: See what else it comes up with.
787.24s: Another way we can use it is this is a live example
790.00s: by the way.
790.84s: I've noticed for the last couple weeks, definitely
793.80s: the last week, that the S&P 500 is
796.20s: had seemingly large moves in the tail half of the day,
800.52s: specifically the last hour, specifically the last half hour
803.52s: to like 15 minutes.
805.44s: So I built a question for it and I said, hey, analyze this.
809.20s: So what I did was I ran and I grabbed data in five minute
813.48s: increments downloaded it, then I literally uploaded it
818.24s: into chatchipt and I gave it that exact prompt.
821.32s: And I asked it to look at it.
822.80s: So it runs through and it gives you an overview
825.96s: of what it's doing.
826.80s: So this is showing you the average return by five minute interval.
830.52s: So then I say, okay, this is for the entire data set
833.84s: that I selected, which again is for,
836.16s: it doesn't go this far because it runs out of columns.
839.76s: This only uses 20,000 records, so it does not go back to 2018.
842.76s: It's like less than a year.
844.32s: But for the sake of the example here.
848.28s: So what I did was I said, okay, well,
849.96s: based on this population that I created,
852.92s: I want to take a sample of that.
854.84s: And I want to compare it against the recent five days.
858.28s: What do I notice about the average return over the last half hour
862.40s: in the last five days compared to historic?
865.96s: This completely validates the colloquial thing
869.28s: that my eyes are picking up.
871.28s: Because you can see that the last five minutes
873.20s: are literally schizophrenic parabolic moves
876.56s: for the recent five days compared to the historical.
879.48s: Now again, you would expect this
881.40s: because the recent five days is a very small sample.
884.00s: And the more data you have, the closer you expect it
887.00s: to perform on average.
888.60s: So we can build out these studies to tease out that idea more,
892.48s: but the premise is fully displayed here.
896.00s: And it shows average volume.
897.76s: This is an example of chat you'd be being wrong.
900.20s: It's plotting average volume, but this is SPX.
902.88s: There is no volume.
904.08s: So it's just showing you zero, but if you start to ask it
906.96s: about volume, it can try to manufacture answers
911.04s: that literally don't exist.
912.96s: So then we could say, well, I want you to actually run a T-test
917.32s: on it because I want to see if this is statistically significant
920.40s: or not.
920.76s: And it literally can show you where it's statistically
923.20s: significant or not.
925.00s: This is, again, just another way you can use it
928.48s: for basic research purposes.
930.12s: Okay, last example.
931.72s: Let's say that you're trying to figure out
933.52s: everything going on in the market.
934.72s: There's a ton of stuff happening,
936.00s: but you think that there's some opportunities out there.
938.80s: Literally you can drop a prompt like this
940.88s: into chat you PT.
942.68s: And I'll go all the way up to where I first dropped it,
944.64s: that exact prompt, and it gave me a very high level overview
948.48s: of what it's seen.
949.76s: So then based on these investment opportunities,
951.88s: I said, hey, go away further in detail,
955.00s: up the quality tremendously, and give me specific things
959.44s: to look at.
960.04s: So I asked it based on the sector,
962.24s: look at individual stocks,
964.52s: for those individual stocks,
966.12s: I want to see fundamental analysis based on its performance.
969.32s: I want you to include price targets based on your research
972.08s: timelines for those price targets.
973.96s: And off we go.
976.80s: One of the things you'll notice that I think is really pertinent
981.40s: is I said, okay, great.
983.04s: I want you to put it in a table,
984.40s: so it's easier for me to see,
986.12s: but then I want you to not just focus on large caps,
988.80s: but include growth stocks of some sort.
992.64s: So I get my table with what its expectations are,
996.24s: but what's one thing I notice down here
999.60s: when I get to Palantir?
1001.84s: What does it say at the current price for Palantir?
1003.44s: It's 25.
1005.76s: What is the current price for Palantir?
1007.96s: 117.
1010.08s: Again, you have to fact check it.
1013.04s: So this is the point of you can use it as a starting point,
1017.40s: but it is not omnipotent,
1019.04s: and it will tell you things very confidently.
1021.88s: However, this is dead wrong, completely wrong,
1026.68s: and it won't flag that for you.
1029.08s: So you have to continue to be thinking,
1031.20s: and this is why when I go back to this person
1034.20s: that says, well, I don't really feel like doing it,
1036.56s: to me, that's a massive red flag,
1038.96s: because what it gives you can be wrong,
1041.40s: you have to fact check it.
1043.36s: But the cool part is you can teach it to teach you
1047.32s: how to analyze whatever it is you ask it to look at,
1049.92s: so you can validate it on your own to make sure it's correct.
1053.64s: This is literally the absolute tip of the iceberg,
1057.60s: because so much deeper if you have any questions,
1059.44s: let me know.
1060.28s: Be an outlier, see you later.
