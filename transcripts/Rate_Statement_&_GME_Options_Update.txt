0.60s: what's up outliers trading week look
3.36s: ahead we got a couple things I want to
5.20s: run through just calendar events what's
7.00s: happening take a quick look at the
8.36s: Futures in general and then I'm going to
11.68s: pop over and look at GameStop in depth
14.12s: to see any activity to keep an eye out
16.52s: for the coming week so let's dive
18.80s: straight in first thing here Futures are
21.32s: open they're moving around just a little
22.96s: bit The e- Minis are up
26.48s: 0.18% the Russell and the NASDAQ up both
30.20s: originally about a quarter point now
32.24s: they're oscillating the Russells at 0.2%
34.88s: NASDAQ a little bit above that the vix
38.80s: is down essentially half a point Bitcoin
42.28s: unchanged gold up
44.56s: 0.58% in crude oil up uh quarter point
48.36s: so what are we seeing so far this looks
51.12s: like a little bit of a chilling out
52.80s: again it's really important to
54.48s: understand that the Futures open is not
56.92s: necessarily that indicative of what it
59.00s: will look like tomorrow during the
60.60s: actual open market but it gives us some
63.24s: ideas specifically if there are extremes
66.32s: but there's no extremes here from a look
69.00s: across the different indices though
71.76s: there are some extremes we can see that
73.44s: the NASDAQ has been punished definitely
75.60s: more than the e- minis the S&P 500 and
78.84s: the Russell is just kind of doing its
80.08s: own thing it doesn't give a crap about
82.32s: what anybody else is doing and it looks
85.08s: like it's actually wanting to to open up
87.36s: even higher than where it closed on
89.24s: Friday so small caps still showing
91.80s: strength and yeah there is a big change
94.96s: here in the percentage of S&P 500 stocks
97.92s: above their 50-day moving average now
100.36s: it's at
101.88s: 69.2% I like to keep an eyeball on this
104.36s: figure it's kind of like a breath
106.16s: indicator for the S&P 500 along with
108.88s: what I like to use for the market RIT
112.56s: large is this here net highs and lows
116.04s: and you can see that for the NASDAQ
118.16s: interestingly enough even though it's
119.48s: getting punish to the downside we're
121.40s: actually seeing a collapse on Gross lows
126.08s: on Gross highs and net highs is
129.68s: expanding and to correct what I just
131.76s: said the gross highs is expanding so
134.40s: we're seeing a collapse specifically in
136.72s: Gross lows so that kind of is
140.12s: interesting right because if you think
141.60s: about it the NASDAQ itself we can use
144.36s: QQQ as a bit of a more commonly used
147.32s: proxy it doesn't look to align with this
150.48s: right like I mean just take a look at it
152.16s: it's falling off a cliff yet as it's
154.40s: falling off a cliff it still has
157.00s: reasonable highs and so what's going on
160.08s: here well it tells you pretty clearly
162.00s: that there are a handful of names
164.64s: dragging this down that have an outsized
168.20s: impact in the index which we kind of
171.64s: know those exist I don't think that's a
173.44s: giant shock to anybody but if we take a
175.72s: look at the NASDAQ you can see some of
177.32s: the bigger names in here if they don't
179.12s: perform well that entire index even
181.72s: though the majority of it might be
183.20s: hanging out doing its thing the rest of
185.24s: the index doesn't it doesn't really
186.60s: matter that much it's being pulled by
189.48s: the primary leaders there which is
191.24s: interesting so I find that in and of
194.04s: itself somewhat curious now let's take a
197.44s: look specifically at calendar week ahead
201.36s: what events we have coming up and it's a
204.76s: little bit of a slower week so we
206.32s: essentially have nothing tomorrow other
208.00s: than some earnings so there's McDonald's
209.84s: earnings and then I think there's the
211.72s: Dallas fed meeting business index
213.92s: nothing that I care too much about
216.08s: starting on the 30th though you'll see
218.28s: that we have the um HPI composite I
221.72s: don't think that matters too much the
223.92s: house price index I care about just
225.48s: because I like keeping an eyeball on the
227.40s: housing index and how it's behaving
229.04s: consumer confidence I also care about
230.80s: for the same reason I don't think either
232.28s: of those are huge impacts jolts job
235.04s: openings will be a bigger deal and
237.16s: because just this unemployment anything
239.32s: related to employment right now is an
241.52s: important indication of overall economic
243.60s: health which obviously directly feeds
245.60s: into things like how the market is going
248.84s: to perceive the impact of inflation and
252.28s: the health of the economy then on the
255.08s: 31st we have Chicago PMI which I do care
258.72s: about we have Penning home sales crude
261.60s: oil inventories those kind of standard
264.16s: things and then the bell of the ball on
267.12s: the 31st we have the Fed interest rate
271.56s: decision and we have the press
275.04s: conference the rate statement then on
277.84s: the first we have manufacturing PMI by
281.16s: S&P and ISM the balance sheet on the
284.96s: first un employment stuff on the second
287.72s: now I want to take us back up to this
290.88s: specifically the rate statement and I
294.12s: want to take a look with you all at the
296.08s: FED watch tool so that we can see right
299.44s: now what the market is pricing in for
301.12s: this
302.04s: upcoming uh statement and it's looking
305.80s: like overwhelming probability of no
307.96s: change with a slight slight existence of
312.28s: an ease that's actually ebbed and Float
315.76s: it's gone from 10 33% chance down to 413
319.48s: up to 62 down to
322.24s: 413 now this is interesting because if
326.44s: we take a look at the overall
328.84s: probabilities we're running out of time
331.16s: for multiple cuts and previously there
334.60s: was actually a stacked cut here that's
337.08s: now gone because we're running out of
338.96s: time and what this is showing me is it's
341.64s: overwhelming probability of no cut in on
344.32s: the 31st then on the 18th of September
348.40s: this is down to 87.7 this was much
351.24s: higher and this is also down quite a lot
354.52s: on 7 November to 63% so the market is
358.52s: guiding down this expectation of a cut
361.16s: pretty significantly but this still is
364.48s: showing a cut here in September here in
368.88s: November and a slight Edge to a cut in
370.76s: December so that's three Cuts in a row
374.08s: that the market is expecting to see so
376.24s: we will have to see how that goes TBD
379.20s: what I can tell you is that if the
381.96s: market starts getting punched in the
383.28s: mouth in terms of its expectations of a
385.12s: cut I fully would anticipate things like
387.88s: small caps to start chilling out quite a
390.00s: lot unfortunately not exactly what I
392.44s: would want to see but it is what I would
394.20s: expect to see now let's take a look at
396.16s: GameStop and there's a few things in
398.92s: here that I would like to draw your
400.36s: attention to we did a pretty long live
402.20s: stream yesterday about more of the
403.48s: background took a look at some roaring
404.92s: Kitty stuff some different due diligence
407.16s: which is super fun really really enjoyed
408.96s: that and now I just want to focus a
411.72s: little bit more on the options chain
413.68s: because obviously price hasn't moved
415.52s: since I've made the last couple updates
417.44s: videos on it it's hanging out pretty
419.64s: static here obviously Market's closed so
422.12s: let's take instead a look at the options
424.52s: because there are a couple big changes
427.00s: that have happened now the first thing I
429.68s: want to show you is over here the call
433.24s: oi is down to 5
436.68s: 69,000 giggity and the put oi is at
440.92s: 347k so as I was talking about during
443.12s: the live stream yesterday these are
444.44s: converging a lot way more than I've seen
446.68s: them in previous time generally speaking
449.48s: speaking I see way more call oi this
451.84s: generally tells me I think we're coming
453.32s: into a bit of a quiet period the other
455.64s: thing that I noticed that has changed is
457.92s: the 16 Aug expiration cycle used to have
460.72s: higher V than these and now it's
462.64s: actually lower that's slightly
465.00s: interesting to me because even towards
466.92s: the end of last week I would have
468.44s: expected this two a expiration cycle IV
471.64s: to pick up and it didn't and now it's
474.08s: just starting to catch on which I find
476.04s: that again slightly topical because I
478.44s: really believe that the 16 Aug is going
480.32s: to be way more active than everything
482.36s: else we see here and again a lot of that
484.60s: just comes from a liquidity and a market
486.08s: mechanics perspective the weeklys are
488.20s: just not going to have as much going on
489.60s: in them and we can take a look at that
491.96s: two a right now has 71,000 calls 34,000
496.88s: puts n OG 26,000 calls 9,000 puts 16 o
503.36s: 201,000 calls 109,000 puts so that's my
507.08s: point these front two expirations
509.08s: combined still aren't essentially half
511.68s: of what you see in 16 a so that's very
514.92s: normal I don't necessarily read into
516.92s: that excessively there's no reason to
519.88s: but if we take a look at the 16 a
521.96s: positioning to start getting idea of
523.52s: what the Market's looking at the 125s
525.76s: still off the chain lots of lots
529.00s: of uh I don't I don't even want to call
531.16s: it speculative transactions there it's
533.08s: just kind of a mix of things that I
535.72s: think go into this specific strike but
538.48s: there's 40,000 562 oi there and then the
542.44s: rest of the distribution is kind of
544.28s: mixed so we do see the bigger strike
548.64s: right now looks like the 30s to me and
551.24s: then after that it'll be the 40s and
553.96s: then after that it looks like
556.08s: essentially a tie almost between the
559.36s: 25s and the 100s very very close to one
562.92s: another and then after that the 50s and
564.76s: so on and so forth so this is where
566.08s: we're seeing some
567.24s: centralization now looking at this
569.84s: coming expiration cycle the one thing I
571.56s: want to point out that is interesting to
573.28s: me is we are seeing layering of these
577.04s: near out ofth money strikes so you can
579.80s: see that there's 1100 oi here at the 24
583.28s: and a Hales with 2800 incoming volume so
586.08s: that will get built up same thing here
588.36s: at the 25s with 15,000 incoming oi this
591.36s: is also going to get built up the 25 and
594.04s: a halfes 1690 against 1,000 oi this is
597.96s: also going to get built up and this
599.76s: essentially holds true almost all the
601.12s: way through until you get up towards 30
603.56s: which is very interesting to me now
606.32s: unfortunately I'm not convinced that
608.60s: there's enough here to really actually
611.00s: Newton just shot me a text shout out to
612.80s: you Newton um but there's not enough in
616.24s: here right now to lead me to believe
618.32s: that we are you know Escape Vector
621.52s: shooting up and out but this does create
624.24s: a little bit of an interesting potential
627.48s: Market Behavior because is as these
630.52s: front options fall in the money the
632.44s: market maker is now incentivized to
634.40s: purchase those shares to hedge their
636.72s: position in expiration so that they can
638.56s: deliver and you'll notice that as each
640.40s: one gets triggered there's kind of
641.76s: another one with at least some oi that
644.16s: would cause some buying pressure and
647.00s: that is essentially a mini version of a
649.24s: gamma squeeze now a real gamma squeeze
650.92s: is if these were really really loaded
653.08s: and it just shot this thing up and out
655.84s: but the other problem is obviously with
657.52s: the at the money offering I don't
658.84s: necessarily think that we're in like a
661.20s: really difficult liquidity environment
662.80s: you can see that up here right it's even
664.12s: flagged as easy to borrow there's plenty
666.96s: right now shares available to to hedge
669.44s: the the product which makes it obviously
672.48s: a little more convoluted in order to
674.52s: pursue something like a gamma squeeze it
676.36s: still could happen but it's just a much
678.68s: harder environment for it to occur so
681.88s: that's what we're seeing so far as
683.60s: always anything you want me to take a
684.92s: look at let me know be an outlier I'll
687.00s: see you guys later
