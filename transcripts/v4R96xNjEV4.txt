0.00s: What up outliers quick market update.
2.12s: We got two things to look at today.
3.84s: We got rocket lab USA post earnings and then we have GameStop.
8.60s: There is some really interesting options activity over the last couple days that I think
14.20s: we should talk about.
15.20s: So we'll start with this quickly and we can see overall our KLB has been up and to the
21.20s: right.
22.20s: This is a three month daily chart.
23.48s: If I take us out to a year, it's essentially been parabolic.
26.88s: So what's going on in here?
28.40s: Well, if we take a look at some of the internals before we pivot over to earnings and we talked
33.84s: a little bit about our KLB last night, but this will just touch on some of the higher level
39.20s: components.
40.20s: It's been in favor again for the past year when you see stocks moving like this so strong
45.24s: for extended durations, they tend to build a lot of momentum.
48.48s: That's actually why momentum is a very tradable factor in the stock markets.
52.60s: One of the few things we can like truly quantify isolate and put positions on based on that
58.00s: effect alone.
59.64s: And if we just peek through some of the key news as we see like this, this here, they
65.80s: had a solid earnings.
67.00s: I don't think there was any big shock there when we were looking at the options last night
73.48s: leading into the earnings.
75.36s: It was definitely bullishly positioned.
77.52s: Now what's really interesting though is the move today was different than I would have
84.92s: expected.
86.24s: The main reason for that is I wouldn't have expected it to break all the way up here and
92.28s: then get rejected all the way back down.
94.76s: That is a lot of selling pressure.
97.48s: So those are people that are really, really happy to say to just see this up here and
104.24s: they're getting out.
105.32s: They're fading out.
106.32s: Now understanding how many of these people are folks that have built in profits, I would
111.56s: imagine that would be a lot of them because there's just not that much volume that actually
117.86s: transacted above this current level.
120.04s: It's just not that old of a company.
122.84s: Most of the volume is transacted down here at like 466.
125.84s: So these are people that got in down here.
129.04s: And I mean, they tripled their money plus, which is, I mean, they actually, if they top
133.60s: ticked it, I forgot that it broke above 20.
136.12s: So they literally would have five times their money and then some.
139.76s: So the overall movement today was really interesting to me.
145.60s: I didn't expect to see quite this shape of a candle.
150.60s: And we need to see how it goes tomorrow.
152.72s: My guess is a lot of the sellers probably got it out of their systems because otherwise,
158.08s: I mean, it definitely could have trailed down more on the day.
160.80s: I don't see any reason why it wouldn't have otherwise because if you look at the volume
165.56s: today, overwhelming volume, 120 million shares traded today, their five day average is 41
173.36s: mill, which includes this day, obviously.
176.16s: And then 18 mill before this, the five day average was 20 mill against 14 mill.
181.72s: So just an explosion and volume and the majority of it was sale, 95% and it stayed up there,
187.72s: which that was pretty interesting for me to see.
190.60s: So let's take a look at the options.
193.24s: We knew that there was some pretty heavy call skew coming into the earnings release.
197.76s: And if we break this out by expiration, you can see that it was about two to one calls
203.44s: to put.
204.44s: So there was definitely people playing this to the upside, not massive positions, but
207.72s: big enough for sure to appreciate pretty handsomely over the move.
212.44s: And these are really short data options.
214.00s: So a lot of them are going to be coming off soon.
216.48s: And on a longer term time frame, it still maintains pretty heavy call skew.
220.36s: So overall transactions today, 308,000 calls.
224.84s: And we can see 22% were at the bid or below.
228.44s: So sold 30% opened and 46% somewhere in the market, probably a mix between these.
234.20s: I have to imagine lots of people taking profits, especially on these shorter term options,
238.44s: because there's not a giant incentive to hold these 15s into expiration at this point,
242.72s: even if they're far in the money.
244.44s: It's just a little bit more risk.
246.12s: I mean, who knows?
246.88s: You never really can identify what the rationale is for a trader.
250.76s: So interesting move here altogether.
253.32s: Now from a quick broader market perspective, a few things stuck out to me.
259.28s: Tech is still really strong.
260.64s: So you can see comms up here and then tech sector here.
264.52s: They're still definitely leading the pack.
266.48s: And then we still see this really weird breakdown.
270.32s: And I can't put my finger on it between staples and discretionary.
273.64s: Still hitting highs in staples is still trending negatively over a three month period,
279.36s: which I just, like I said, I can't put my finger on it.
281.88s: It's weird.
283.20s: And real estate struggling, not a big shock there are utilities kind of trending sideways.
287.00s: I think you're going to find some really isolated strengths within utilities, right?
290.88s: So we know Trump's policies really favor things like oil production stuff like that.
296.52s: It's not going to be as favorable to things like solar wind, definitely not wind.
300.40s: As you could tell, Trump is not a fan of the whales being hurt.
304.32s: If you guys aren't familiar with the joke that I'm making there is from the Joe Rogan podcast,
307.72s: really spend a while talking about the impact of windmills on whales.
310.88s: And I have to be honest, I had no idea that that was a thing.
313.52s: That was actually new information for me entirely.
316.64s: And so in healthcare.
318.56s: So healthcare is not happy.
320.00s: Big pharma is not looking good.
322.04s: And we've seen this being carried out pretty consistently, right?
326.32s: So if we look at Pfizer, I mean, it's just barely catching a bid down here.
331.52s: It's overall still sucking wind, essentially from when the election was known, right?
337.64s: So you can see there's the fifth.
338.80s: There's the sixth and boom down she goes big, big, big drop off.
342.36s: I think big pharma is going to have to figure out what this might look like with RFK and
348.04s: his overall involvement, right?
349.72s: If they start getting in front of their advertising spend, I don't even know how big of an impact
354.52s: to be honest in or fearing with the advertising spend.
357.80s: A big pharma is going to be a typically it's a big deal.
361.36s: But I'm also I just can't think of many consumers that are like asking for specific drugs based
367.04s: on an ad they've seen.
368.48s: Obviously, they're smart and they're spending the money for a reason, but that part I can't
372.56s: figure out.
373.56s: But I also think more importantly, if they're giving donations and stuff like that to other
378.56s: news agencies, it does create misalign incentives, right?
382.48s: Because if I'm Pfizer sponsoring parts of your show, you're more likely to not necessarily
387.68s: emphasize stories that besmirch my brand.
390.76s: So that part I think is more likely to be detrimental.
393.80s: The ad spend itself is interesting and maybe it's part of that.
397.32s: So let's take a look at GameStop and specifically in GameStop, it is holding this rally like pretty
404.04s: comfortably.
405.04s: I know some people are a little dejected that it's not, you know, a moaning right now,
409.08s: but this in and of itself in my book is a pretty strong victory, right?
413.56s: Like look at this candle today, even in GameStop, it's this like invert hammer, but the thing
420.84s: that's important is take a look, big volume, big sale volume, and it's still really held
426.28s: its own.
427.28s: Now does this mean it's starting to roll over?
429.20s: It's hard to tell.
430.20s: It's a little early to tell in my opinion we can see from an RSI perspective.
433.64s: It's momentum is slowing, but we can visualize that.
436.92s: So what I thought was a little more topical from GameStop is actually this.
443.36s: So if we take a look at the options volume and I want to specifically look at these that
450.72s: came through.
452.08s: So the 40s on the 12th, which is yesterday, they got tapped not over 3000 times, right?
458.40s: So you can see a 3000 lot that got pushed through here that was worth over a million dollars.
463.00s: This does start to look interesting.
466.96s: And there's a lot of people asking me if I think that this is ruined.
469.80s: Kitty, especially because I've just spent literally almost three months analyzing every
475.08s: single one of his trades.
476.92s: And what I can say is this does fall closer in line with what I would expect to see from
482.08s: him.
483.08s: Now whether or not that's him, nobody knows, right?
484.48s: Like there's other people that trade and it's always important to keep that in mind.
487.84s: Because I know a lot of people are just fingers crossed, hoping that it's him stepping
492.52s: in.
493.36s: And I would love to see that to be clear.
494.36s: I'm in that same camp.
495.68s: But I always make that comment because if that's the basis that you're making trading decisions
501.24s: off of that's.
502.36s: It's just a little more difficult to rationalize.
506.04s: But in terms of days to expiration strike selection, this is very much in line with what
512.00s: we've seen from him historically, right?
513.84s: So we can see that there's 3000 of them here, 1400 of them here.
518.64s: And again, these are the 17 Jan 25s.
521.84s: We can see another 2000 here.
524.20s: We can see another 1000 here.
526.68s: We can see another 800 going through here.
530.04s: So like there's tons of these 40s getting hit.
534.12s: And again, it's a little further out in time.
536.24s: So this is not like some sort of really short term yellow-esque style trade.
540.36s: This is deliberate positioning.
542.68s: And this is deliberate positioning to the upside.
545.32s: Now I do find it a little bit interesting that there's no sale on these.
551.84s: And the reason why I find that interesting is because if we take a look at the different
555.04s: times that these were transacted on the 12th and on the 11th, it was kind of towards
561.36s: the end of the day.
562.52s: So 26.
563.92s: So somebody had the opportunity to get out at about a 10% gain overnight.
570.24s: And they kind of look that in the face and they said, I don't think so.
573.08s: I'm going to hold.
574.40s: So it's clearly to me, in indication that somebody's kind of trying to play a bigger move,
581.12s: not just playing the short term first move that's put in front of them.
585.88s: So we'll have to see what these materialize into.
588.32s: I'm curious what you all think about the overall options activity in here.
593.32s: It's questionable to me.
594.32s: It looks interesting, but this is definitely larger trades coming through with some level
598.60s: of conviction.
599.60s: If we take a look over the last couple days specifically, the majority of these, this
604.76s: higher volume that's several hundreds of thousands of dollars essentially has been
608.96s: from the 12th on.
610.80s: There's definitely some trades earlier than that, but the bulk of it has been in the
615.32s: last couple days.
616.56s: So I'm keeping a really close eye.
618.04s: I didn't see a lot popping off today on the 13th to any significant degree, but as always,
624.28s: you know, I'm poking through markets, seeing if anything is jumping out, looking interesting.
628.20s: And so far, it looks like there's a building phase going on, right?
632.04s: So we can see that down here, another thousand of the forties got hit on the 13th.
637.00s: They got hit yesterday at a couple of different times.
639.32s: So this is building out a position of some sort.
641.88s: We'll see what it looks like.
643.32s: As always, any questions?
644.32s: Let me know.
645.32s: Be an outlier.
646.32s: See you later.
