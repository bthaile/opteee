0.27s: hey Eric here got another question on
3.81s: what is a tender offer this is actually
6.00s: a really cool one and it's happened to
8.58s: be really simple so easy conversation so
11.10s: the question was essentially that you
13.38s: know the poster wanted to understand
15.33s: tender tendering what what it is so a
18.03s: tender offer is it's essentially a
20.10s: conditional order for somebody to buy a
22.20s: certain number of shares of an
24.66s: underlying at a certain price so let's
27.45s: say a big institution is trying to and
31.23s: it's kind of the third bullet point here
32.49s: designed to establish a big stake which
35.31s: equals influence you can see this in
39.48s: hostile takeovers or if a company is
41.91s: trying to take a public company internet
46.26s: private essentially what you do is you
49.59s: need to buy a majority of outstanding
51.87s: shares so let's say that they want to
53.37s: buy 80% of equitable shares that are out
56.97s: they offer a certain price and what
60.24s: happens then is the brokers take that
62.55s: offer to anybody who is a current holder
65.64s: of that underlying and then essentially
68.97s: the investor gets to say yes I want to
71.40s: sell excuse me I want to sell my shares
74.67s: at this price or nope I don't and then
80.22s: you just keep your shares if you don't
81.42s: but if you do say I will share my share
85.86s: sell my shares at this price then what
88.74s: happens is there's two possible
92.16s: scenarios one if the threshold is met
95.22s: then there will be a transaction the
97.65s: threshold being the number of shares
99.45s: they wanted to buy so again if we have
102.30s: stock you know XYZ being traded and some
105.48s: company investment firm whatever the
109.17s: case wants to take over or control kind
112.62s: of the decision making within that firm
114.27s: for any number of reasons they'll say
117.54s: okay I want to buy 80% of outstanding
121.62s: shares in company XYZ and I'm going to
125.22s: pay $50 for it
127.05s: so then what will happen is that will go
129.63s: out to all the folks who currently
131.66s: chairs if you want to sell you do you
133.82s: not those who say I will sell out that
136.49s: price the transaction doesn't happen
138.80s: immediately what happens is they need to
141.59s: get enough responses from people who
143.81s: commit to sell their shares at that
145.91s: price and then once they hit that 80%
148.79s: threshold the transaction will occur if
151.49s: it does not meet that 80% threshold or
154.28s: whatever a threshold they set then
156.71s: there's no transaction so that's what a
158.63s: tender offer is it's essentially a way
160.10s: for certain companies to try to solicit
162.41s: people to sell their shares so that a
164.75s: firm or whoever is looking to buy all
166.73s: the shares can take a large stake in a
170.24s: certain company ultimately and not
173.18s: ultimately but more often than not to
175.04s: gain influence or control over the
177.71s: decision making so hope that explains
179.75s: the question if if you have any other
182.29s: following questions let me know and I'm
184.49s: happy to explore with you alright take
186.59s: care
