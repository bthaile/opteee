0.28s: what's up outliar let's talk about
2.32s: option early exercise and or assignment
6.00s: we're going to look at it from both
7.64s: sides of the perspective and we want to
10.16s: talk about some really key themes first
12.64s: we're going to start with some common
13.80s: myths then we're going to talk about
15.56s: what's early assignment or exercise
17.76s: actually is then we're going to talk
19.44s: about why it happens we're going to talk
21.92s: about the process how it functionally
24.36s: works and then we're going to talk about
26.28s: how to manage early assignment risk both
30.00s: for buying and selling perspectives now
32.20s: this typically is more eventful for the
34.60s: seller side of the equation because
36.88s: sellers are the ones that are obligated
40.04s: to deliver and they're not really in the
42.40s: driver's seat meaning we don't get to
43.96s: decide if we're a seller when an option
46.48s: is exercise it's different if you're a
48.56s: buyer so let's first start with some
52.92s: common myths and my goal for these
55.16s: common myths is I want to be able to
58.60s: very clearly articulate the answer to
61.16s: these at the end so we're not going to
64.16s: answer them up front I want to share
65.92s: these myths and then at the end of the
67.52s: video you should be able to answer these
69.96s: for yourself so the first common myth is
72.92s: an option that falls in the money is
76.84s: likely or going to be exercised so if we
81.20s: take a look at an options chain for an
83.52s: example that means in something like
86.60s: this in voo it means that with the stock
90.52s: NOW trading at
92.72s: 13963 these 139s are now in the money so
97.16s: some people mistakenly believe that once
100.48s: these fall in the money they are now
102.64s: going to be exercised and you will learn
105.52s: why that is a myth the second common
108.24s: myth is all in the money options are
112.76s: exercised at
115.60s: expiration this is another myth and
118.16s: we'll talk about that so first let's
121.16s: circle now to what is early assignment
125.08s: it's actually really straightforward so
127.60s: early assignment is when a long option
130.68s: holder chooses to exercise their option
134.84s: and the short option holder is now
139.24s: required to deliver on their obligation
142.00s: which is different if you are short
144.76s: calls it means that you have to let go
147.28s: shares meaning you have to sell somebody
148.96s: shares and if you're short put it means
151.56s: you need to take on shares you have to
153.16s: buy somebody's shares so there's a
156.88s: really key difference between American
158.88s: and European style options American
161.00s: options can be exercised at any point
163.64s: for any reason now very frequently it
168.12s: doesn't make sense to exercise your
171.24s: option which I will explain why with an
174.24s: example in just a few moments but keep
176.32s: that in the back of your mind with that
178.40s: being said European style options can
180.60s: only be exercised at expiration so
184.28s: there's this wildcard aspect to American
187.36s: style options meaning you can be paired
190.60s: with a holder that decides to randomly
194.12s: exercise their option just because they
195.40s: want to now from a seller's perspective
197.08s: it doesn't really matter because there
199.16s: can be scenarios where a buyer might
201.20s: choose to exercise and it can leave you
203.00s: with a profitable position as a seller
205.36s: but it can still occur so early
208.36s: assignment is simply when we have a
212.32s: buyer that chooses to exercise their
214.92s: option before expiration for a few
219.44s: different reasons so let's talk about
221.48s: some of those reasons right now the
223.64s: first one is if we have an option that
226.68s: is exceedingly low extrinsic value
229.60s: specifically options that are in the
231.32s: money they are at risk of early exercise
236.28s: and the other scenario specific to call
239.36s: option
240.48s: is if there's a call option that has a
243.68s: dividend coming up that has little
246.96s: extrinsic value specifically less
250.20s: extrinsic value than the upcoming
252.40s: dividend those options are at high risk
256.04s: of early assignment so let's take a look
258.56s: at that dividend scenario we have vo
261.92s: right here and vo is trading for
265.52s: 13963 and let's say we have these 129
268.72s: calls let's say we sold these 129 calls
272.72s: well these 129 calls are in deep risk of
276.76s: early exercise and I will show you why
280.16s: because you can see that voo does have a
282.64s: dividend and the dividend amount is $113
285.92s: and the X dividend date is the 30th of
289.24s: January which is coming up so here's
292.76s: what happens the person that bought that
295.44s: option is saying to themselves well I
298.60s: can exercise this option that means I'm
301.08s: going to buy 100 shares or however many
303.80s: contracts they have of V at$ 129 when
307.96s: it's trading at 139 so they're going to
310.56s: get it much cheaper than what it's
311.80s: currently at which is great that's the
313.76s: intrinsic value and then they might say
318.04s: well I don't want to give up the
319.68s: extrinsic value but if we actually take
323.08s: a look at how much extrinsic value is in
325.52s: these options we can do the math so we
328.28s: can say these 129 they're essentially
332.48s: $10.63 is in the money so let's say that
337.04s: these are trading for
339.04s: 1090 and the midpoint and if we take
342.28s: that
342.96s: $10.90 that's the price midpoint of
345.72s: these options and we take out the
347.84s: intrinsic value and again the intrinsic
350.88s: value in the scenario is
352.76s: $10.63 well if you take 1063 away from
356.00s: 1090 it leaves you at
358.20s: 27 that means means that 27 cents is
362.20s: less than the dividend of
365.56s: A113 so in this scenario the holder of
368.84s: that option actually will make more
372.04s: money if they exercise hold through X
376.72s: dividend and give up that remaining
379.68s: extrinsic value now I want to make clear
383.76s: this idea of giving up the extrinsic
386.08s: value and I want to talk about why early
389.76s: exercise doesn't happen too frequently
392.88s: and it has everything to do with
394.88s: extrinsic value so let's look at an
397.04s: example we have vo above my head you
399.60s: don't really have to see the options
401.00s: chain but I want to walk you through a
403.20s: couple transactions here so let's say in
406.08s: another scenario that we chose to buy to
409.44s: open one of the 135 calls and let's say
413.76s: that we got it for $7 I'm just picking a
415.56s: number it doesn't really matter let's
417.64s: look at two scenarios in scenario one we
421.56s: decide that we want to exercise this
424.28s: option so our options in the money right
427.28s: if we bought to open the 135 and the
429.08s: stock is at 139 our options in the money
432.76s: but if we choose to exercise let's take
434.88s: a look at what happens we're going to
436.84s: buy to
438.28s: open 100 shares at our bases of
442.24s: 135 and then we're going to sell to
445.20s: close in order to realize the profit the
447.72s: 100 shares at 139 63 which is the spot
450.96s: price so at face value this is a
453.60s: profitable transaction what's the
455.48s: problem the problem is if we take a look
459.08s: at what we paid for the option and
462.24s: actually in this case what the option is
464.72s: currently worth if we look at what we
467.28s: paid for the option the premium $7 we
469.76s: also have to factor that into the
471.28s: equation so that means we would be able
473.96s: to sell the shares at 139 we take out
476.68s: what we paid 135 we also have to take
479.84s: away what we paid for the option because
482.00s: we're giving that up we're exercising so
484.04s: the ex trans the value of the option
485.92s: just goes away so in this scenario you
489.20s: lose
491.80s: $237 however if we look at a slightly
494.44s: different scenario where instead of
497.12s: exercising we instead sell to close the
499.84s: option at spot price which is right now
502.48s: $875 or so now we're literally just
506.60s: transacting with the option there's no
509.56s: movement of the underlying so we get to
512.36s: sell the option for $875 that we bought
515.24s: for $7 that gives us
518.04s: $175 profit so this is an example of how
521.72s: early exercise can literally take a
524.64s: winning position and turn it into a
526.80s: losing position because of giving up the
530.24s: extrinsic value so that's going to be a
532.84s: big part of what you have to keep in
534.48s: mind as we continue to move through
536.84s: these examples so how does it work
540.36s: well from a functional perspective
542.40s: options that are in the money are
544.04s: typically going to be Auto exercised by
545.92s: the broker only at expiration if it's
550.72s: before expiration the holder has to
554.96s: manually choose to exercise them and a
558.64s: lot of times your broker might even
560.12s: reach out to you and say hey if you
561.68s: exercise these it doesn't make sense
563.72s: you're going to lose money just like the
565.20s: example that I sent you but again the
567.64s: holder always has the choice it's their
570.00s: choice so here as we just reviewed they
574.64s: can pick two even though it very likely
577.64s: is suboptimal in most
579.84s: circumstances and then from the last
582.36s: perspective if the long holder does
586.00s: choose to exercise they're going to be
587.68s: randomly paired with a short from the
590.36s: other side of that trade and then
592.08s: whoever is short on the other side of
593.64s: the trade has to complete their side of
596.64s: the bargain so how do we manage early
599.48s: assignment risk well for sellers it's
602.20s: really simple we have to monitor
604.16s: positions with really low extrinsic
605.80s: value especially if they're short calls
608.08s: with a dividend coming up and if we want
610.72s: to maintain exposure to a position we
612.48s: would roll the options out in time to
614.24s: gain more extrinsic value or just close
616.44s: the position and then from a buyer
618.60s: perspective you just need to make sure
620.84s: that you're assessing how much EX trenic
623.68s: value you're giving up and what you get
626.16s: in compensation for that so for example
628.76s: if you're long a put and you want to
630.88s: exercise it there's essentially very few
633.32s: scenarios where it would be profitable
634.88s: to do so from an early exercise
637.12s: perspective versus just trading the
639.48s: option outright but let's go back to the
642.36s: seller perspective and let's take a look
643.96s: at this scenario so let's say that you
646.72s: same scenarios we were looking at before
648.28s: the 129s we have a dividend coming up
650.68s: that's $113 and let's say that you still
652.64s: want to be short voo for whatever reason
655.12s: but you know that you're at risk of
656.80s: early assignment what can we do here
659.04s: well again we know that this option is
660.56s: trading for 1090 and we know that
662.72s: there's only about 23 cents of extrinsic
665.04s: value and for those that don't know
666.84s: there's a quick way you can assess
669.12s: extrinsic value of an option and it's by
671.80s: looking at the corresponding out of the
673.96s: money option so if we're looking at an
675.64s: in the money call we would look at the
678.04s: out of the- money put and you can see
679.56s: it's close it's not exactly correct but
681.28s: it's close it's just a back of the
682.88s: napkin way to do it and if you're
684.60s: looking at an in the- money put you
686.84s: would look at the corresponding out of
688.28s: the money call just for a quick eyeball
690.60s: of extrinsic value a lot of platforms
692.32s: let you put it up here as well or you
693.88s: can always just do the math take the
695.44s: intrinsic value out so 1090 is what this
699.68s: is currently trading at and we know
701.40s: again there's very little extrinsic
703.00s: value so if we chose to close these at
706.04s: 1090 and let's say that we rolled them
708.28s: out 54 days first we can see where can
711.56s: we get
712.92s: $10.90 we can get them here at the 130s
716.48s: right and still get a credit but most
718.60s: importantly
719.92s: take a look at the extrinsic value of
722.60s: these options these options are $9 in
725.32s: the money there is at least $3 of
729.84s: extrinsic value $3 of extrinsic value is
734.72s: more than the upcoming dividend these
737.52s: options would be at very little risk of
740.08s: early assignment because it financially
742.64s: doesn't make sense to do so so the way
745.28s: that we pay attention to it is by
747.24s: monitoring for things like that now one
749.28s: other admin note is that it's not
751.72s: relegated to just calls that have a
753.76s: dividend coming up that's just where the
755.24s: risk is the highest if you have an
757.36s: option that's really deep in the money
759.88s: it can be exercised specifically if
762.20s: extrinsic value starts to dwindle pretty
765.84s: significantly what does that look like I
768.20s: would generally consider if an option is
770.24s: trading for a nickel or less at a fair
773.08s: risk of early assignment it's also
774.84s: relative to how much the underlying
777.32s: costs but if you're looking at something
779.92s: that's one penny two pennies that's a
782.24s: pretty high risk of early assignment for
784.76s: multitude of different reasons that you
786.24s: have to be aware of but avoiding it is
788.68s: really simple in general if you just pay
791.60s: attention but you can't always
793.16s: completely avoid it because if you sell
795.72s: options the holder can choose to
797.28s: exercise at any point for any reason but
800.08s: you now know why options that fall in
803.80s: the money are more often than not not
806.48s: going to be exercised it doesn't make
808.64s: sense
809.76s: and then the second scenario is all in
812.76s: the money options at expiration are
815.24s: automatically exercised by the broker
817.28s: typically but a holder can still choose
820.04s: to say I don't want to exercise it now
822.48s: that would be a giant mistake if you
824.28s: take it all the way in expiration and do
825.92s: that because then you lose both
828.32s: intrinsic and extrinsic value that's not
830.20s: a good scenario to be in but it's not
834.20s: always the case so the way to think
836.88s: about this is in general options are
839.32s: unlikely to be exercised higher
841.40s: probability scenarios that if you're
843.20s: holding short calls that are in the
844.60s: money where the extrinsic value is less
847.88s: than the upcoming dividend any option
850.60s: that is trading for a nickel or less is
853.40s: at a moderate risk of early assignment
856.20s: if you manage all of those factors from
858.04s: a seller's perspective you can slide
860.60s: away from the majority of early
862.04s: assignments still not all of them
863.40s: because it could still happen from a
865.04s: buyer's perspective you just need to
866.88s: assess the value of extrinsic that
869.28s: you're giving up and decide why you're
872.20s: doing that if there's an actual rational
874.48s: reason to do so if not then typically
877.52s: it's better to just trade the option as
880.00s: always if there's any questions let me
881.92s: know be an outlier I'll see you later
