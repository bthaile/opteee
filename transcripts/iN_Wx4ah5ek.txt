0.00s:  you
0.00s:  What's up everybody, Eric here. Welcome back to the Outlier podcast where we talk all
7.40s:  things abnormal. We're looking to understand kind of high-end performance, what that looks
12.56s:  like, how we get there, how people achieve it. And I got my friend back on Richard. This
16.76s:  is your second time on the podcast, but welcome back. Great to have you.
19.96s:  Well, thank you. It's great to be here. And we had such a good time last time that I
24.68s:  can't see. We're only going up from here. That's, I mean, that's the goal. I never really
31.46s:  underestimate my ability to dork stuff up, but, you know, I think we'll be all right.
37.04s:  I'm pretty confident we're going to do okay. So one of the random questions I have complete,
46.30s:  complete aside, but obviously your background is in psychology. And that's what we talked
50.80s:  a lot about in the last conversation. And from a general perspective, I am very curious
57.20s:  what your take is specifically on the impact of like COVID isolation on traders. What impact
67.32s:  do you think that that had from a psychological standpoint?
69.84s:  Well, if we look at the broad range of possible careers or jobs, probably that's the minimum
79.36s:  impact. I mean, traders tend to be introverted. They tend to be engineers. They tend to be
84.80s:  more technically oriented or, you know, focusing on the screen is where they get their jollies.
91.92s:  So people come and go. So my guess is it's minimal. Now I'm always happy to hear from
97.52s:  people who said, nope, COVID really did me enter. Man, COVID was a real boon for me because
103.40s:  I got to stay home and didn't have to go into the office and I trade part time. So I would
108.84s:  be really interesting to see how traders actually answer that question. But my guess is on the scale
113.80s:  of things, probably not so much. Yeah, that's actually a really fair expectation. It's I share
121.48s:  most of it. One of the things I do hypothesize and I'm curious or take on it is with more people
129.16s:  being funneled into trading that might not have been traders before. We kind of saw that during
135.40s:  COVID and expansion in trading activity from the retail perspective at least. I wonder if that
142.84s:  cohort specifically because during COVID more so being pushed into trading, not being able to
150.92s:  directly connect with other people, if they were looking to connect more with traders online,
157.32s:  other traders trading communities. And if that had any impact on performance because anything
163.72s:  that I've read from a broader study perspective off of something like SSR and social science research
170.04s:  network, it seems to find that when retail traders get together and make collective decisions,
175.24s:  it's generally not great for them. So again, maybe it's a little too loosely put together for
183.32s:  there to be direct ties there. But I was wondering if during COVID more people trading that haven't
187.96s:  been trading before, those people, newer people tend to want to connect with others and whatever
193.72s:  they're doing because they know they don't know what they're doing. Did that lead to a potential rise
197.96s:  in people banning together, sharing ideas and what impact that would have on the experience?
203.40s:  Yeah, well, I don't have any data on that. I don't have any information. So all I know is that
210.44s:  when traders first start, what you mentioned is that there's just an overwhelming
216.28s:  amount of data, material, strategies, time, preferences. Oh my gosh, risk preferences. It's just,
226.28s:  it's a complex adaptive system. And as a result, there's an infinite amount of inputs that impact other inputs.
235.24s:  So it can be really overwhelming. And especially the new traders who say, oh, I'm an engineer. I'm a mathematician.
242.04s:  I'm a physics major. We can solve this. So they come in with this sense of being able to do it.
251.48s:  And when they start trading, the first indication of whether or not they're successful
258.36s:  is whether or not they made a good trade. Yes, my dreams are coming true.
265.72s:  Or oh my god, I've lost three in a row. So they're very trade dependent, profit dependent,
272.84s:  very short term. So next they say they look at strategies. And where the groups are really
278.92s:  helpful here is for somebody else to step you through their strategy. Even if it doesn't make sense
286.44s:  for you or you for your personality, your time frames or whatever. If you have somebody else who
293.16s:  says, here's a strategy. And then somebody else says, here's another one and another one.
297.24s:  What you pick up is the process for creating and analyzing strategies. Then the next step is you
304.52s:  get confidence in your strategy. You do the back testing. You do the work. It tests out. And then
310.84s:  you go to trade it. And you got this confidence in it. And all of a sudden you've lost four
316.28s:  trades in a row. Oh my gosh. Or the worst thing that can happen, like when I built a
323.64s:  floor trading firm is hired, you know, a guy would clerk for me for six months or a year. I'd
329.56s:  give him a badge, capitalize him. And what's the worst thing that could happen the first week?
336.44s:  I would guess if they win. Yes, if he made money. Because all the dreams, all the hopes,
343.00s:  everything is future is dad's going to appreciate me. My my spouse will love me more. I'll get
348.44s:  laid more often or whatever. All these dreams are connected to making money. All of a sudden,
353.72s:  they're going to come true. I am God. The best thing that could happen is when they come in,
362.28s:  their hands were shaking and rich. I lost some of your money this this week. I know. I watch
371.96s:  numbers every day. Okay, so let's find out what happened. Let's step through the first day of
378.12s:  trading. What did you see? What did you notice? Okay, here's something to broaden or here's here's
383.64s:  a focus you had. Here's another way of focusing. We step through it. And then slowly they can build
388.76s:  the confidence out of their behaviors rather than an accidental windfall.
393.16s:  I really I like the highlight there specifically on kind of the process. And then something I talk a
402.68s:  lot about. I think it's relevant because at least I started trading 2007 when I was really young
409.56s:  fortunately. And so I've been doing this so long. They made you so young. Yeah. Yeah.
415.72s:  Great. Now I actually just turned 33 yesterday. Oh man, you're so young. Oh, geez.
424.04s:  Don't don't ever say that you were young. Like in ARP cards or something. I don't know when you
429.16s:  get those, but but what I've really developed an appreciation for at least in my existence is
438.36s:  an appreciation of the process in embracing delayed gratification. I think a big part of that
445.16s:  came from just the early activities that I got into when I was young things like martial arts,
452.12s:  weightlifting. You don't really see instant results in any of those things. And you actually kind
456.52s:  of go through periods where you're putting in perceivably a lot of effort and you're seeing very
461.00s:  little out of it. But you just keep doing it. You just keep seeing it through. And I find that
466.36s:  really to have helped me a lot in trading. Now one of the things I see a lot in traders is that
473.24s:  and this is my opinion again seeking your expertise. It seems like traders often over emphasize
481.24s:  any one single trade. And they kind of forget that each one of these trades ideally is part of a
490.04s:  well-developed system that's designed to be bared out over years, hopefully.
497.16s:  Well, it's not only every single trade, but how about every single tech?
503.24s:  Oh, my dreams are going to come true. Wow, I'm going to have that Ferrari. Well,
508.84s:  my dad's going to respect me. Wow. Oh, tick tock. Oh my god. Maybe I should get out. Oh,
514.68s:  oh, no, no, no. Oh, it's gone. It's a hit into my stop. I better cancel the stop. I can't end my dream.
523.00s:  So yes, so what what you talked about is process. And when you're weightlifting, that's a really
531.64s:  good metaphor because like for a long time, I didn't exercise. My back gave me problems and
539.40s:  was just all sorts of things. You know, getting out of a car. I had a list my leg up. I'm going to
545.00s:  be 77 this year. So, you know, time takes a toll. But I started doing some exercises. And
555.00s:  the it's not like it's delayed gratification for me. It's like it's wow. I can feel my muscles growing.
565.80s:  You know, when you're at that burn place and you just burn anything, this is so good because I know
571.88s:  it's given me the power to live the life I want. Wow. So what we do is we set up a process with
578.84s:  our trading clients in which before they have to be disciplined after we use willpower, I have to
584.84s:  suppress my emotions, I have to execute my trades. And what we're doing is we're setting up an
590.12s:  internal struggle. But instead we say, I'm going to step into this process. And it feels so good
598.76s:  to have the power to be able to do that. Oh my gosh. If we can do that in the moment, like if I'm
605.72s:  with a client and they're executing their system and they've been doing it for a day and they
611.00s:  come to me and say, Rich, it felt so good to feel my trading power. It felt so good because when
618.76s:  we can get it to the point where they stop struggling and it's an invitation to feel good.
627.00s:  Wow. As soon as we do that, then we're out of that internal struggle and willpower and discipline.
633.80s:  That's interesting. And it leads to a follow-on question I have for you because it's something I've
638.36s:  kind of employed over my life. I think a lot of it's just from my time in the Marine Corps,
644.20s:  where you're not really, I guess the easiest way to describe it is at least for a Marine officer,
650.52s:  our ideal leader is somebody that is the keel to a ship, somebody that when shit is going
658.36s:  on haywire, they're calm, cool, collected, they have a plan and they will work through it.
663.80s:  Same thing if everybody's having a great time, that same leader is still probably more so
669.40s:  leaning towards calm, cool, and collected. And what I think about in my life in general is I have
676.92s:  no problem like feeling happiness. I'm generally, I tend towards happiness. I'm a happy human being.
682.20s:  I'm happy to be here. But when I'm executing something like my trades, I really keep
688.36s:  any of that in check. And one of the things I postulate, and again, I'm wondering if your research
694.68s:  bears this out or your experience, where if a trader goes through this process where they experience
701.32s:  alation, to me, what I typically think about with that is, well, if you feel alation
707.40s:  disperse around the corner, if you feel one of those, the other one is there. I think it's way
711.96s:  too difficult to isolate just feeling good and never feeling bad. So when it comes from like to
718.04s:  trading and a trading perspective, what are your thoughts on regulating that emotional rollercoaster?
725.00s:  Does it make sense? Does it not make sense to you? Does it good to have like a big carrot in front of
729.24s:  you? Be more disciplined, use little powers, shove those emotions down, don't recognize.
736.84s:  We have a different approach. Got it. So when we feel so it's first is awareness. So we have,
745.40s:  in fact, I could even show you on a screen, we have something called our set scores, sensations,
749.88s:  emotions and thoughts, and we score them. And the goal is first just raw awareness, like right now,
759.24s:  let's let's do it. Just a mix, still tight. My voice is a little, I'm going to exaggerate,
766.36s:  a little more like this, because I'm pushing it. Ah, so what if I wasn't pushing so hard?
773.48s:  Wow, do I feel different right now? So the first is awareness. Number two is acceptance.
785.56s:  If I judge myself for everything I become aware of, then I'm setting up another internal conflict.
794.84s:  But if I say okay, my stomach was tight, I was pushing my voice, and I said okay, so I noticed it,
802.44s:  is that what I want. And the third piece is agency. So awareness accepted. So when you're trading,
809.72s:  you made a good trade. Yes, I followed my rules. In fact, we have a term for that. It's a lucrative
816.28s:  trade, whether it's profitable or not. You know, what you taught brought up earlier is process.
821.96s:  We just keep going back to process process. Occasionally put your head up, check your outcome,
828.12s:  back to process. So it's like a wave. So awareness, acceptance, I don't berate myself for having
835.24s:  a tight stomach or pushing my voice hard. I just say okay, that's interesting. I was exciting.
840.68s:  I love talking to Eric. I'm all excited about things. My voice got, um, agency.
847.64s:  Is that what I, what do I want now? Oh, I'd rather be really relaxed with Eric,
853.64s:  really relax with people watching this. Okay, so I can do that. So awareness, acceptance,
859.80s:  and agency. Interesting. So in that process, then, do you guys have tools to try to mitigate
871.64s:  the inclusion of either euphoria or despair? Well, Eric, we don't mitigate. We say, wow,
886.44s:  like, for example, the other day, I was really down about something. And I could say, rich,
891.16s:  don't be down, mitigate this down this, or I could say, wow, that's fascinating. I'm really
896.84s:  down. What's going on? Hmm. Now, this is really important to me. And it's not going like I expected.
903.08s:  What do I have attached to it? Oh, I have some attached, some meaningful behaviors for the next
908.92s:  few years. And if this doesn't go, that kind of dream that I was unaware of kind of collapses.
916.04s:  Okay, no wonder. Huh? Okay, rich. You're all right. So let's reevaluate the dream. So in other words,
923.72s:  what I did right there was rather than mitigating the feeling is awareness, accepting it. What is
931.72s:  its message for me? So oftentimes we'll come up in private coaching with voices, different parts
939.32s:  of ourselves that represent a piece of legacy behaviors or beliefs that are preventing us from
948.76s:  getting what we want. So Eric, one of the things you talked about, and I don't know if you want to go
954.68s:  there, but was in terms of your own trading, yeah, taking a look at that process in terms of where
961.40s:  you're at, I'd be happy to go there if you're interested. I would love to. Yeah, let's do it. Walk
965.00s:  me through whatever you need to do. Okay. So if you're looking at your trading and you're product,
970.28s:  you okay? Oh, yeah. I just have to like move around in my chair. Normally, I've like a sitting
975.80s:  in standing desk. So normally like every 10 minutes, I go up and down. But obviously, yeah,
981.40s:  I can't do that here, otherwise it blocks the camera. So I just fed you in my chair. Okay.
987.00s:  Ah, so how long have you been trading? Uh, 16 years. So I started in 2007. Okay.
997.40s:  If you're looking at your trading progress, what are you really happy with? What's gone?
1003.40s:  What progress have you made in terms of your own psychology or mindset?
1008.12s:  Um, in terms of mindset, I think the progress I've made the most is actually probably the
1015.16s:  antithesis of what you guys teach, but it's, it's being indifferent. I am, if I have an update,
1022.68s:  I am indifferent. If I have a down day, I'm indifferent. The way I think about it is,
1029.24s:  at this point, I've done a tremendous amount of research on how I'm choosing to deploy.
1036.28s:  Though I know there's efficacy behind it, regardless of how I may or may not feel. So,
1041.88s:  regardless of how I feel, I seek to execute the plan. Yes. And back, people who are in disciplined
1051.16s:  positions, such as the armed forces, and they've gone through hell and they, the only thing that
1057.24s:  saves them is stand on track, stand disciplined, uh, airline pilots, uh, people, traders.
1067.16s:  There is a process of saying, I'm disciplined, focused, seen, I'm the whole of the,
1077.40s:  I'm the, what the keel of the ship, I'm staying on focus. How I reinterpret that is,
1087.24s:  I feel better as a human being, staying on purpose. I know lives are a stake or money is at stake.
1096.52s:  And so, for this moment, I'm going to focus on that and that feels better. And we call that discipline.
1107.08s:  But if you check yourself and imagine yourself being undisciplined while you're on a patrol,
1115.88s:  or undisciplined if you're an airline pilot, or if you're undisciplined as a trader,
1123.16s:  and in that moment where you know the direction, your confidence, what you do, you're repeating your
1130.76s:  strategy, if you imagine stepping outside of that, it's going to feel like hell, because you know
1138.12s:  the circumstances. So, for me, I reinterpret many people, I, they say, well, discipline is the
1144.28s:  key. And I say, I'll bet you it feels better to stay in that spot, rather than being undisciplined.
1151.88s:  So, I respect the people who say discipline, because what they've learned is that their life
1158.60s:  experience improves dramatically, and that feels so much better in the bigger picture.
1166.28s:  Yeah, I think it's accurate. And the other thing I've come to really appreciate with respect
1171.88s:  to something like discipline is I find at least for me, and I do consider myself a moderately
1178.36s:  disciplined human, but I still find that internal, I call my inner bitch, but there's this internal
1186.44s:  monologue with myself where I'm constantly trying to negotiate with myself between what I consider
1192.60s:  like my lower level thought process and the higher level thought process, lower level being more
1197.96s:  reptilian, immediate gratification seeking higher level understanding delayed gratification,
1204.12s:  pursuing something longer term. And those two are at odds for me very regularly.
1209.56s:  Okay, and you call that lower part your bitch, is that right?
1212.92s:  The inner bitch. Yeah, the inner bitch. Okay. Yep. The comfort seeking inner bitch.
1218.04s:  Yeah. Eric, so yeah, I would like to have your permission to have a conversation with the inner
1225.96s:  bitch. Oh, he don't get to come out. It's not even there. We could try to find them, but I don't,
1231.48s:  yeah, let's play. Okay, so right now notice your body language. You notice,
1237.40s:  I was trying to like lean back to get the defense mechanisms and then to try to summon the inner
1245.96s:  bitch. Okay, you don't have to. Okay, that's not your job. I'll be there anyways. If I have,
1252.12s:  if I have your permission, I will, of course, I will see. Okay, Eric's inner bitch. Eric gave me
1259.32s:  permission to talk to you. And I would like to do so with a following understanding.
1266.12s:  I believe you are there and you came to Eric with positive intent for his life.
1275.00s:  And with that understanding, may I have a conversation with you? Please. Okay. So your
1284.36s:  Eric's inner bitch. Is that right? Yes. Okay. And you are there to help him out in what way? What's
1292.92s:  your positive intent for Eric? I imagine the inner bitch is, I've used the pro mount,
1304.44s:  pronoun I, I prioritize immediate gratification. So you're there to help Eric feel better in difficult
1317.64s:  situations. Does that sound right? In general, yes. In general. Okay. Are there times that you have
1326.20s:  other a different mission? I wouldn't limit it to difficult situations. I think in general, I seek
1335.64s:  immediate gratification. Okay. And when you give Eric immediate gratification, gratification,
1342.60s:  does he feel better in that moment? In that moment. Forget everything else. Just that moment. Does
1351.80s:  he feel better? Yeah. I would say so. Okay. Great. So let's just focus this on trading. So when he's
1362.04s:  trading and you his inner bitch come to him to give him a moment of inner gratification, or give him
1372.04s:  some instant gratification. How do you do that? What do you tell him? What do you say to him? What do
1378.28s:  you make his hand do to the mouse? How do you give him that inner that gratification? All of your
1385.48s:  impulse. So you tell him, okay, so you are his impulse, is that right? Yeah. I would give him an
1393.16s:  input that executes something that would make him feel better about his current moment. Okay.
1404.28s:  Okay. So what you do is when he's under either stress or anxiety or whatever, you give him some
1412.60s:  activity to do that for that moment is going to relieve that pressure. Is that right? Yeah. That sounds
1421.32s:  right. Okay. So may I give you an appreciation? Please. A lot of people beat themselves up. A lot of
1432.36s:  people hurt themselves. A lot of people don't allow themselves any kind of gratification at all.
1439.08s:  Gratification at all. So may the appreciation is thank you for giving Eric some gratification and
1448.44s:  helping him feel better in some situations when he's trading. So my appreciation. Thank you. Good.
1456.04s:  So now that we have that straight and you give him gratification, how does that work out in
1461.80s:  just in terms of trading in the long term when you're doing that? Typically decreases performance.
1471.64s:  And how does that impact Eric's gratification?
1476.44s:  Negatively. Negatively. So what you do is in the moment like a drug or something like that,
1483.00s:  you give him a momentarily high, but there's over the longer term there's a bigger price to be paid
1488.60s:  for that. Is that right? Yes. Excellent. So how would you like to give him gratification? Well,
1497.72s:  maybe I'll let me back up a bit. So let's review the question. Do you have positive intent for
1508.44s:  Eric or are you there to sabotage him? And both answers are fine. You can be totally honest as
1515.24s:  Eric. I think your term, the intention is positive in nature. My intention is positive in nature,
1525.56s:  short term or term. Okay. And long term. I don't think about that. Don't think about that.
1532.60s:  Not even in your world.
1534.52s:  Okay. And your impact on that immediate gratification since that's the only world you live in,
1548.60s:  and thank you for pointing that out. That's really important.
1555.24s:  Feels good in the moment, but as you says, there's a price to be paid long term. Is that right?
1561.00s:  Correct. Okay.
1566.76s:  So Eric's inner bit, most traders have a similar character,
1575.56s:  and most of their characters are unwilling to give up their job. For example,
1581.56s:  how outside of trading or maybe just because of trading, how long have you been with Eric?
1591.16s:  Probably since I was a kid.
1594.52s:  Kid. 5, 6, 7, 10. Probably around there.
1599.96s:  Okay. What was going on with Eric where he needed instant gratification when he was a kid?
1607.16s:  Hmm. A lot of friction at home. A lot of friction at home. Okay.
1615.40s:  So you were, you came to him. You saw this little boy living with a lot of friction at home,
1622.44s:  and you says, I'm going to give him a shot of inner gratification. Is that right?
1627.32s:  Yeah. Yeah. So we can really appreciate your job because the little boy didn't have
1634.68s:  many options or alternatives. He didn't have much power. He couldn't change the family.
1640.60s:  Excellent. So again, an appreciation for coming to a little boy who couldn't change his circumstances.
1654.76s:  And to get him through it, you gave him some internal gratification.
1658.68s:  Hmm. That was really appropriate when Eric was a little boy. So thank you.
1667.00s:  Thank you. So you've been with Eric and you've a long time now. You're still a young man.
1676.20s:  He is still a young man.
1681.80s:  And now Eric's ability is a mature adult and his time frames have shifted.
1691.80s:  So my question in her bitch is, have you shifted time frames along with him?
1698.20s:  No. No.
1704.20s:  Given what you did for Eric when he was a little boy and saved him,
1712.04s:  the situation, I don't know how bad it was, but even for little kids, I know when I was a little
1718.12s:  boy, even the smallest things because I didn't have any frame of reference.
1723.56s:  We're just horrific. Looking back on and go, huh? But you really helped him out there.
1733.16s:  So would you be willing to expand your role, to expand your support for Eric
1742.52s:  to help him in a longer time frame?
1749.56s:  Yes. Okay.
1753.40s:  So as I understand it right now, the way you do that is give him some instant gratification
1759.72s:  to do something, to move, to relieve the stresses, that right? Yeah. Okay.
1766.12s:  And you don't know anything outside of that world because you don't know about the long term.
1770.92s:  That's not even part of your world. Is that right?
1783.56s:  So there's a couple of ways we can go here and I need your advice, inner bitch.
1788.84s:  One way is for you to start taking a peek out there, spreading the curtains a little bit,
1794.44s:  taking a peek to that long term result or develop a partner that can hold your hand and work with you
1807.08s:  that has a longer gratification time period. So as Eric's inner bitch with his positive intent in mind,
1817.00s:  which way do you think would be more effective as an invitation to work with Eric on a longer time
1825.40s:  frame, creating another part of him or you expanding your view outside of the curtains?
1833.80s:  The latter of those two, expanding the view. Expanding the view. I think so. Excellent.
1840.60s:  Okay. We've got time. Do you recall a time when you were in a trade and inner bitch came to you
1855.40s:  and said, we need some relief. We need some gratification. Let's do it right now. Do you recall that?
1861.24s:  Hey. What? Today. Today. Oh, great. Okay. Tell me what was going on.
1869.00s:  I had a zero DTE trade on, sorry, just to say with the exercise, am I explaining the trade from the
1878.12s:  inner bitch's perspective or from Eric's perspective? Good question. Just as a neutral observer,
1884.60s:  what's going on? Okay. Got it. Yeah. So today, there was a zero DTE SPX trade on. The
1893.80s:  trade was going well for most of the time that it was on, started to turn over. It turned over,
1901.80s:  almost got stopped out. No problem at that point. Then it started to get above break even. So then
1911.16s:  the first impulse to intervene was there. Then that impulse was suppressed. And then from there,
1922.20s:  the trade started moving in the other, it was a short strangle to be clear. So I had risk
1931.08s:  both to the downside and so it started going the other direction as trades do. And the
1940.52s:  I think of the desired intervention was as it was moving back up, the impulse was, this was
1953.64s:  already a loser today. It's now a good winner objectively. You can just exit now, take your
1963.32s:  profit and then move on. Okay. So let's go back to that exact moment where the inner bitch came
1973.64s:  to you and said, take your profit now. Okay. So imagine the screen, the market's going up,
1981.16s:  is that right? And it's heading to the other side of the strangle. Okay. So I want you to just
1988.36s:  stay with that and step into that world. You can look at the screen or just imagine the screen.
1999.72s:  And notice the voice in your head. And what is the voice saying?
2006.52s:  Sorry, just to clarify, am I going back to that point in time when first came in? Okay. Got it.
2012.44s:  At that point in time, right now I am. So present tense. Right now the trade is starting to move
2022.76s:  against me in the other direction. Take your profits now so that it doesn't turn into a loser.
2029.16s:  Okay. And if it turns into a loser, what does that say?
2032.60s:  Lost money today. And what does it say if Eric lost money today?
2042.68s:  Genuinely nothing more than that. And it gives you a feeling if you
2051.32s:  okay frustration. Okay. So if we by was to step inside of Eric's body,
2058.36s:  how would I know I'm frustrated just physiologically? What would I notice by stepped inside your body
2064.76s:  and felt that frustration? Probably elevated heart rate. Okay. Elevated heart rate.
2074.52s:  I don't want to call it like maybe hyper attention. Like very, very. Yeah, I'm not sure the
2082.12s:  correct term for that. Yeah, the kind of hyper attentive.
2092.04s:  And then like you're hunting on this event as and you're really close to the prey hyper
2098.36s:  attentive. Yeah. Yeah. And then I would also add on like annoyed in some capacity. We'd be
2105.00s:  tied to that as well like annoyance annoyance. Okay. And so in your body, we have a
2111.88s:  elevated heart rate. Anything else? Oh, yes, sorry. Speaking inside the body.
2126.12s:  I think the other thing that comes to mind is this is the battle between the inner bitch and then
2133.32s:  the higher mind. That's like as I close my eyes and consider that moment, that's the crescendo.
2139.08s:  That's like the overwhelming. So dropping down into the primitive brain, the inner bitch,
2145.72s:  and that taken over versus the higher level neocortex cognitive part.
2153.32s:  Yeah, there's like a very big debate slash fight going on between those.
2163.40s:  I'm going to diverge a little bit here. Well, movie world wars. See, have you seen that
2167.88s:  Brad Pitt? And at some point he's running with his family up to stairs in a building or something
2174.44s:  on. And he's touched by a zombie, which means that he could be coming zombie and kill his family
2181.96s:  or maybe not. He doesn't know. So he stands on the edge of the building, leans forward,
2187.00s:  is far forward as he can without falling. And the hope is at that moment that he feels he's
2193.80s:  turning into a zombie as enough agency to lean forward and fall and save his family.
2201.72s:  So it's that kind of thing. Once we drop down into that, when I drop down,
2208.20s:  and my particular drop down now is eating my whites too much apple pie.
2213.56s:  It's over. I'll say I'm going to have one piece. It's over.
2224.04s:  Okay, so we have that put we're just on the edge. Our heart rates have elevated.
2232.04s:  Elvated. Yep. And what else any muscular and things you notice? So right now step into that,
2236.52s:  we're right at that edge. Probably,
2241.32s:  probably like sitting attentively. So like right now I'm leaned back. I imagine what I'm
2245.96s:  trading. I'm more like that original posture. Yeah. So facial muscles, anything?
2253.80s:  Think so. Okay. Lean forward, focused, elevated heart rate. And we're really close to being
2263.72s:  taking over by the inner bitch and just getting out. Okay. And as you notice that
2278.76s:  sitting here with rich, what would your preference be in terms of your behavior?
2285.80s:  As the inner bitch, I would prefer him to have exited the trade.
2293.40s:  Okay. Eric exit the trade right now. As Eric in his higher cognitive abilities and his
2302.76s:  rational probability sense and long term thinking, what would his behavior be?
2311.00s:  In response to that? Or just period if there wasn't an inner bitch.
2315.88s:  Oh, that nothing. It would just be, yeah, let's let the trade do what it does have to do.
2323.24s:  Right. So higher level Eric that's watching this battle.
2333.64s:  So let's bring ourselves back to that point.
2339.00s:  Markets going higher.
2340.60s:  Yeah.
2341.24s:  Inner bitch says get out now while you still have a profit because it came close to losing money.
2351.00s:  Eric's rational part. What do we call that? Does that have a name?
2355.32s:  Eric is me.
2356.44s:  Eric. Okay. So and Eric knows that this is a probability game. And if he lets all the trades play out
2362.68s:  and in the long term, it's going to work out better. Is that correct?
2366.28s:  Yeah. I think the overwhelming thought is regardless of the outcome of this one single event,
2376.60s:  the system has to play out in order for it to have any efficacy. Right.
2384.84s:  So as Eric in his highest level self is awareness of both of these
2392.28s:  parts of Eric,
2398.04s:  can you look at both of them if you're looking down on them having this
2403.80s:  leaning on the edge of the building?
2409.80s:  And you're looking down from it from your highest self even higher than the rational self.
2414.44s:  Can you elicit compassion for both parts?
2421.48s:  Absolutely.
2422.68s:  Absolutely. We can have compassion for the inner bitch and we can have compassion for Eric.
2436.76s:  So look down on the inner bitch and give him an appreciation in this moment.
2441.72s:  Thank you.
2443.96s:  I would say thank you for trying to salvage the trade.
2453.88s:  And
2459.88s:  is the end supposed to be like a broader?
2462.92s:  Yeah, it can be. Or we can just move on.
2467.00s:  Not for I can add an and I think the and there would be for looking out for Eric in the short term.
2475.32s:  That's the motivation there.
2478.52s:  Exactly.
2484.52s:  I appreciate that. You gave me the message.
2489.08s:  I let you come. I've heard the message. I've given you an appreciation.
2494.68s:  And now I'm going to let it go.
2498.76s:  So try something like that. Try an awareness, an appreciation.
2506.44s:  And thank you.
2508.36s:  And let that experience come and go.
2515.24s:  So I acknowledge
2516.84s:  that you're going to have a very good understanding of the inner bitch.
2521.48s:  During that trade, the intentions of the inner bitch were good in the short term.
2528.84s:  Okay, talk to them directly right now in that long.
2532.68s:  Okay, standing on that edge.
2534.20s:  And have this conversation with them while you're just leaning forward.
2538.76s:  Got it. So thank you for your awareness during that trade.
2543.88s:  For the outcome of the trade, this specific trade.
2550.28s:  I appreciate that you're paying close attention to each individual trade and trying to achieve an optimal outcome.
2563.88s:  So let it go part. I'm not sure what to do there.
2567.56s:  Yeah.
2569.56s:  So I give you appreciation. You've done your job.
2573.24s:  Well done. Thank you and goodbye for now.
2576.60s:  And we'll see you again. Try that or something else.
2581.08s:  So I've given you the appreciation.
2584.04s:  Thank you for what you've done.
2587.08s:  Goodbye for now.
2591.48s:  Okay, how does that feel? What do you notice in your body as you do that?
2596.68s:  It's an interesting, honestly, the biggest thing is it's
2601.88s:  fascinating to take on the avatar of the inner bitch.
2608.36s:  So I think it feels interesting to like spend time viewing the world
2615.64s:  from that perspective that I spend so much time to your point just stuffing down.
2625.40s:  Excellent. So what you're doing, this is just to start
2629.88s:  of making that connection and a positive, healthy relationship with that part.
2635.24s:  So we're not stuffing, we're not disciplining, we're not well-power.
2639.56s:  In fact, the opposite. We're appreciating.
2642.12s:  That voice has a lot to say about your experience from when you were a kid and growing up.
2647.72s:  It's repeated patterns.
2649.88s:  What happens is when we're powerless and we don't have many many options in our life,
2657.48s:  interesting your trade options.
2659.16s:  We don't have many options in our life.
2662.92s:  We create the avatars, we create the parts of ourselves
2669.40s:  that one we're powerless and give us momentary relief.
2674.60s:  The younger we are, the more that pattern replicates itself in every part of our lives.
2683.16s:  So in my example, my mom was depressed, distant.
2690.04s:  I remember one kind thing from her all my life.
2693.40s:  That's brutal.
2696.12s:  And my response was to be self-sufficient emotionally.
2705.72s:  Boy, did that help out?
2709.48s:  Man, that saved this little kid from going crazy or doing drugs or all sorts of other.
2714.92s:  I did some destructive behaviors, but fortunately I live.
2717.64s:  Who doesn't?
2720.52s:  But that part, as I grew older, to be that self-sufficient emotional part,
2728.12s:  that's what I wanted.
2729.56s:  That's what I needed.
2731.56s:  But we tend to repeat the survival patterns that saved us.
2737.80s:  And I could go into some details, but I won't hear.
2741.00s:  But I needed to repeat the survival pattern of how my mom treated me so that I could survive it.
2753.48s:  Sounds nuts, doesn't it?
2756.60s:  But.
2757.56s:  Thousand.
2758.52s:  Okay.
2759.24s:  So, but go ahead.
2761.96s:  I was going to say one of the things I've always been so curious about is it's like
2768.04s:  your point not limited to trading.
2770.60s:  It's like on a daily basis, I'm fighting with the inner bitch about everything.
2777.32s:  Perfect example.
2778.52s:  My birthday was yesterday.
2780.28s:  My wife made me brownies.
2784.76s:  I don't need to eat.
2785.56s:  Thank you.
2786.12s:  I don't need to eat a brownie.
2788.36s:  It doesn't.
2789.00s:  It does not need to be in my diet.
2790.76s:  But then the inner bitch goes to, oh, well, your wife made them for you.
2796.04s:  You can't not eat them.
2797.32s:  It's just impactful.
2798.68s:  You would enjoy the brownie.
2800.36s:  But meanwhile, the higher part of my mind is saying, I don't need the fucking brownie.
2805.64s:  So I'm not going to eat it.
2807.56s:  So it's like what you're highlighting there, kind of that revisiting of that survival mechanism.
2813.16s:  It actually clarifies a pretty significant question I've had for some time now, which is
2819.48s:  I already know the outcome of most of these instances.
2823.56s:  And it's, Eric is going to do what Eric wants to do, regardless of what the inner bitch suggests.
2830.28s:  However, I never understood why it was so pervasive in so many different things.
2836.12s:  But that literally explains a large part of it, is that it's a kind of a subwritten survival mechanism
2843.24s:  that is reiterating.
2849.48s:  And sometimes it just pays appreciate the wife eat the brownie.
2854.28s:  I know.
2855.64s:  It's that is like it's the most compelling argument.
2858.84s:  It's so difficult to turn that one down because the way I look at that is it's it literally
2864.52s:  is selfless and 10.
2866.36s:  If it was just a brownie that I had bought for myself, I would have there would be no
2870.84s:  conversation about it.
2871.88s:  Right.
2872.04s:  I wouldn't be able to.
2872.52s:  Right.
2873.32s:  But because it came from my wife, then I'm like, fuck,
2877.72s:  this now just got more complicated.
2880.20s:  Yeah, I tell you, I could we could put me on the hot seat here.
2887.96s:  Food has been associated with love and a real deep inner need.
2895.24s:  And I'll be damned that, you know, just like you're that lower part that kicks in.
2900.84s:  That's really powerful for me.
2905.00s:  So, you know, that has been a struggle.
2908.20s:  And I am reframing it.
2911.32s:  Ah, this is love.
2912.60s:  Is there another way that I would like to get love?
2916.52s:  My survival mechanism goes and says, no, no, no, if you get love another way,
2923.16s:  you don't know what's going to happen.
2924.76s:  They could leave you.
2925.88s:  You could get unloved.
2927.24s:  So just eat the substitute.
2933.72s:  Take a deep breath, Eric.
2939.64s:  May I give you an appreciation?
2941.88s:  Please.
2943.16s:  Yeah, you did something.
2945.48s:  Talk to a voice inside of you.
2947.56s:  Talk to a part of yourself.
2949.80s:  That's recorded.
2951.32s:  The courage you have right now to do that is going to touch
2956.04s:  hundreds of people who see this video.
2960.20s:  You have given an incredible gift.
2962.76s:  So thank you.
2964.52s:  Thank you for walking me through that.
2965.88s:  And also genuinely thank you for connecting me with a part of myself
2970.60s:  that I spend most of my time stuffing in a fucking corner.
2974.52s:  So it is especially, and I do want to linger on the point that you highlighted
2979.64s:  because you already know this.
2982.04s:  You've seen this a million times.
2983.72s:  But for kind of a Neanderthal like myself, it is kind of a novel
2989.24s:  realization that you connected the pleasure-seeking behavior,
2994.76s:  the instant gratification preference, you connected it with a positive motive.
3000.76s:  That's really interesting to me because typically,
3005.16s:  I look at it as obviously the impact on the broad system.
3009.88s:  But I don't even acknowledge that the short-term gratification seeking is actually
3016.76s:  like genuinely positively incentivized in some capacity.
3020.20s:  That's a very interesting point.
3021.64s:  And in some contexts, it's actually wonderful.
3027.48s:  And so one thing we have to do is look at the context.
3031.08s:  Just like a trading strategy is really useful in a certain market maker context
3037.88s:  that gratification when we're looking at some more central behaviors, for example.
3045.00s:  God, that's wonderful.
3051.32s:  A question for you.
3055.00s:  One of the big motivations and kind of integrations in my psychology is Stoicism.
3062.12s:  I'm a huge practiceer of Stoicism.
3068.52s:  And a big part of Stoicism is things like when I think about mitigating
3080.04s:  unwanted behavior, most of the time the way that I do that isn't just kind of
3085.88s:  just trying to stuff it down.
3089.96s:  I normally think of it more as like logically trying to reason through it.
3094.28s:  But even as I reasoned through these, the trade process is a great example.
3099.16s:  As I reasoned through that, that inner bitch still emerges from time to time.
3107.64s:  And it tries to direct behavior.
3110.28s:  So what would your prescription be if any that can really manage
3119.96s:  how frequently that voice emerges or is it something from your experience that
3125.48s:  is always going to be there, but you learn how to survive and manage with it better?
3132.28s:  Or cooperate with it better.
3134.68s:  Hmm.
3135.48s:  Okay, inner bitch, you want some gratification?
3139.24s:  We're going to go for a run and it's going to feel good.
3142.04s:  We're going to make love and it's going to feel great.
3144.60s:  We're going to do this.
3145.64s:  So hang on.
3147.08s:  We got some instant gratification coming.
3149.80s:  In trading, you know, it just creates long-term
3154.68s:  dissatisfaction and loss of income.
3157.40s:  So, ah, can you wait a moment?
3160.60s:  So what we're doing is like a kid with what knocking on the door.
3163.64s:  Can Eric come play?
3165.08s:  Can Eric come play?
3166.20s:  Oh, I got to do dishes first and then I mom said I could come play.
3172.60s:  I know that's probably a simple line of thought for you, but that is fascinating.
3178.36s:  I another thing I have not thought of is trying to give it that kind of angle.
3184.20s:  I think my natural disposition is you could tell, obviously,
3188.92s:  is to just rely heavily on my ability to logic and reason through things.
3197.88s:  But it is an interesting process to actually acknowledge the other, what I would consider
3204.68s:  to be like detracting behavior in the long run, but to think through how to actually like
3210.92s:  interface with them as compared to just reason around them.
3214.84s:  No, we're not going to do that because of this.
3216.76s:  And to your point, at no point in my putting something else in front of it knowingly saying,
3221.24s:  but we're going to go training and that's going to be just a little bit and you'll enjoy that.
3226.04s:  I haven't made that connection.
3229.80s:  And for people who are really disciplined and it works well for,
3235.72s:  my guess is they have such a pleasure of the discipline process itself that stepping into
3243.48s:  the discipline isn't a struggle, but it's a pleasure because they've learned that it gives
3249.64s:  them long-term gratification. So I'm not against discipline unless it creates an inner struggle.
3257.24s:  But if we're stepping into it and say, wow, this feels better. Like every morning,
3262.76s:  I'll do my inside exercises three, four days a week. And I say, I don't feel like it.
3273.00s:  And all of a sudden, I'm laying out my mat and I'm doing my cat stretches.
3278.12s:  And if I do that, then I do my other stretches, then I do some of my resistance stuff.
3282.92s:  And it's not like I even decide anymore after three years.
3289.64s:  I feel so good afterwards, my God. So it's an invitation. It's not a discipline that I have to do.
3296.68s:  It's looking for that juicy, good feeling after I'm done.
3301.08s:  That is, and especially focusing on like that positive aspect is a really interesting point.
3306.36s:  Because for a lot of the things that I force myself to do shit quite literally all the time.
3313.64s:  And most of the time to your point, I've found that the ability to impose
3324.36s:  my higher thoughts over the short-term gratification-seeking part of myself,
3330.44s:  is very rewarding because it's very hard to do. Just like with that fucking brownie,
3336.60s:  there's a great argument laying in front of me. There's a great argument.
3341.00s:  So the ability to turn that down is gratifying into a pretty significant degree.
3348.28s:  Yeah. And then you can say, oh, and then what you're going to celebrate it.
3353.08s:  Oh, that feels really good. Now, um,
3356.76s:  oh, let's not go there. Okay.
3362.84s:  I have a to not go there to pivot to another spot. I do have a question for you.
3369.00s:  There's a study that I reference all the time. And I would love to pull it up for you.
3375.40s:  And I know we're coming up on time. I don't want to keep you too long, but I really would love your
3379.40s:  thoughts on that. So let me share my screen real quick. I want to show you and I could zoom it in
3384.44s:  a bit so that it's easier to give me one sec. We can make it.
3393.56s:  Okay. So this is a study. It's called the Behavior of Individual Investors by Barbara Nodine
3400.04s:  from University of California. It's an older study. But essentially what they find,
3406.12s:  they look at the trading behavior of individual investors and they look to summarize
3411.48s:  some of the commonalities between them. And there's a couple of here that I really focus on when
3417.64s:  I'm talking at least to my audience. My argument here is that if you want to be successful at something,
3423.72s:  it's important to do two things. It's important to see what the successful people that are doing
3428.52s:  or doing and to see what you can pick up from them. But it's equally as important to look at the
3433.16s:  droves of people that fail so that you know not to do some of those behaviors.
3439.16s:  And there's three things in here specifically that I find very interesting. And I'm curious if
3446.52s:  you have a thought on one, two, all three as it pertains to traders. And I'll just read them out
3453.00s:  really quick for anybody listening to the audio side of this. One of them says, and again,
3457.88s:  this is in reference to individual investors. So this is looking at their behaviors. One of them
3463.32s:  says, Del, winning investments while holding losing investments in the disposition effect.
3471.00s:  The next one is our heavily influenced by limited attention and past return performance in
3477.24s:  their purchase decisions. And then the next important one is engage in naive reinforcement learning
3485.48s:  by repeating past behaviors that coincided with pleasure, the inner bitch that mother fucker,
3491.24s:  while avoiding past behaviors that generated pain. So the inner bitch, the inner bitch,
3498.04s:  parts of me that is learning to appreciate the pleasure it gives me. And I am learning to work with it
3508.12s:  to invite it into the appropriate context. So when you say,
3513.96s:  you give it a negative connotation, I am looking and inviting you to rephrase that in a positive way.
3524.76s:  Okay. So yes, we sell winning investments because it feels so good in the moments like taking a drug.
3531.16s:  And we know we don't lose money if we don't sell, right? If we have something that's underwater.
3537.16s:  We don't lose money. I've done surveys. Do you lose money?
3542.12s:  If you don't take a lot and the answer is 80% of the traders say no.
3550.52s:  We really? Yes.
3554.84s:  So you don't lose money until you've closed the position.
3560.12s:  Oh, that's the belief. So needless to say, you may be familiar with prospect theory. And that says
3570.36s:  that we get twice as much pain for a given loss as gain for the same, same gain. And evolutionarily
3579.48s:  speaking, that makes a lot of sense. So we sell our winning investments. Yes.
3585.24s:  And we hold the losing ones and we hold the losing ones so we don't take that pain. Absolutely
3590.60s:  great. Engage tonight. Go ahead. Yeah. To follow up on that for number two,
3597.00s:  do you have any recommendations for people on that one specifically on the disposition effect,
3602.04s:  the propensity for traders to sell winners too fast and then to let the losers run?
3607.96s:  Yeah. Stop it. That's my man. That's exactly that is exactly what I do. Shut up.
3615.88s:  Shut up. Inter bench. We're doing it this way.
3619.32s:  Have you ever seen the video clip? I just dropped the name. Stop it.
3626.92s:  Oh, I'll send it to you afterwards. Yeah. Not a hand.
3631.16s:  Okay. But the answer to that question, and if we have those tendencies that are
3638.04s:  neurologically connected, started connecting when we were much younger, we can say,
3643.32s:  this one, stop it. Stop it. And we do it again and again and again. So that's what I work with
3650.20s:  with my private clients. And by the way, if anybody is interested in working with me in real time
3657.80s:  while you're trading, working with me on these deeper issues, the repeated behaviors that don't
3663.32s:  serve you, I'm happy to have a conversation with them. And then I'll throw a link to your contact
3669.88s:  information in your website in the notes below for anybody that wants to check it out.
3673.48s:  Right. So selling, winning investments that is built into our neurology from one way we're
3679.32s:  on this event is limited attention and past performance in their purchase decisions. Yes,
3685.80s:  if we had a winner that's reinforced, engage in naive, naive reinforcement learning by repeating
3692.36s:  past behaviors that coincided with pleasure and avoided past behaviors that generated pain.
3698.36s:  That's a bit more complex. And I'm not sure of the impact of that because we tend to forget
3705.32s:  after time. But I think generally that's true. So if you were to prescribe an activity specifically
3714.20s:  for number two and number four here to help mitigate both of those, what activity would you prescribe?
3722.92s:  Well, what we do is we rewire the brain. I work with traders to create something we call
3730.44s:  lousy and lucrative traits. Okay. A lousy trade or let's say a lucrative trade is one where
3736.60s:  you got enough rest. You did your pre-planning for the morning. You were watching. You
3742.04s:  executed the trade at the right time. You stayed in it according to your strategy and your plan
3747.64s:  and you got out. That is a lucrative trade. Now, it doesn't matter if it made money or it didn't.
3755.08s:  Because we know over the larger sample size, if executed in the right type of market, it's going
3762.12s:  to make money. So if we look at these general things, what I do is rewire the blame. So because
3772.28s:  the pain of a loss is so built in at such a deep reptilian level that rather than trying to
3780.60s:  rewire the neurology at that deep level, what we do is just reframe a win and a loss.
3788.36s:  So that a lucrative trade is a win. And so, for example, if I offered you a flip of a coin and
3797.88s:  I'll pay you $200 for every time you call it right and you pay me $100 for every time you call
3804.76s:  it wrong. Would you take that trade? Abs of fucking lily. Okay. Fair flip of a coin. Okay, I flip
3811.48s:  the coin. I do this, by the way. I do this exercise and we have a chart so people can
3818.92s:  actually chart their emotional reactions to it. And even me, even me, when I lose a flip of a coin,
3826.60s:  I feel that when I call it right, I get a bump. And I know it's totally irrational. But so
3835.24s:  what if I flipped it and you called it wrong, what would you feel?
3842.52s:  I have to be honest, if it was $100 on one flip, I genuinely wouldn't give a fuck.
3848.20s:  Right. So flip it again. You got $200. I owe you $200. How do you feel? Don't care.
3855.48s:  Don't care. Right. So that is a great mindset to trade from.
3865.96s:  Most of the traders, I do these webinars and I'll do a coin flip and I have, they all have charts
3871.96s:  and they're marking their emotional reactions. And most of them really care. Or when they get
3878.76s:  three or four in a row right or wrong, they're emotions. And this is just a coin flip. They
3886.44s:  have no control over. So now imagine that you made a trade. You got hopes and dreams in it.
3895.64s:  You've done everything right. You've got an emotional attachment to the trade.
3900.28s:  And it goes against you. Oh my God. It goes your way. Yes. Dreams come true. So the work that I do
3912.60s:  in terms of those things you brought up is to rewire the brain with lousy lucrative trading so
3917.88s:  that we are profitable every time we trade because we have the two to one advantage or whatever it
3925.56s:  is. We rewire the brain with coin flips. I trade with them interestingly enough
3932.52s:  traders, active traders who make off strategy or off the rails trades almost every day. When I'm
3942.44s:  trading with them and I'm there and I'm just doing email and just watching them and whatever,
3947.16s:  not once. No. Once do they go off the rails and why? I'm constantly inviting them to their
3954.20s:  highest self to that agency self. And to make allows you trade to slip down to it would be so
3960.68s:  embarrassing for them that they don't do it. So what we're doing is start to make new neurological
3966.44s:  connections. If I'm there, oh, I can do this. Oh, I can do it more. And then like my exercise
3971.80s:  in the morning, even if my upper level says, ah, I don't feel like it. All of a sudden, I find
3977.80s:  myself on the floor doing my workout. I love that. And I think it applies something that
3986.36s:  really holds true at least with the way that I approach most things, which is kind of a building
3990.36s:  block modality, right? You're talking about rewiring synapses essentially. And that's a process
3997.00s:  that takes place over time with incremental steps, which I really like that that approach. There's
4003.56s:  one of the things I try to help people when it comes to building habits, because it's so funny.
4010.20s:  People will look at me and they'll be like, dude, you're like a robot. I always get such a kick out
4014.12s:  of that because it's like I literally consider myself the most disciplined, undisciplined person
4020.12s:  on earth because I every single day, I have to fight with myself to do all these things.
4026.76s:  Okay, Eric, I'm going to interrupt you. Yeah, please. What if you didn't have to fight with yourself?
4031.80s:  Can you imagine that world? You have survived. What Marines was it? Yeah. You've survived growing up
4042.36s:  in a difficult family. You've survived the Marines. You've survived it by fighting with yourself.
4048.12s:  That's been a process that is part of your deepest survival mechanism. Imagine for a moment.
4058.60s:  What if Eric didn't have to fight himself? What if there was another way to survive as an adult?
4074.44s:  And that if we were continuing our coaching work, that's where we would go.
4083.00s:  What a world of difference that would be.
4088.52s:  Yeah.
4089.32s:  The reservation I would have against that ideology is I'm a believer that if we're pushing
4103.00s:  boundaries, we're going into areas of discomfort and the nature of discomfort is it's always going
4111.16s:  to be a certain level of discomfort until you adapt to that and then move to the next layer of
4116.68s:  discomfort and adapt to that. But whenever I meet that first layer of discomfort, that always
4123.96s:  lies in causes friction. I'm not sure maybe you have a different opinion, but I'm not sure that a
4130.04s:  world exists where somebody can achieve and continue to pursue kind of next step performance in
4137.16s:  whatever they're trying to achieve without bumping into discomfort. And then I guess the argument
4142.68s:  I pose is that that discomfort breeds misalignment.
4154.12s:  Well, I can say that that has worked for you.
4160.68s:  And I can also suggest there is another world outside of that.
4169.00s:  Where discomfort or like when you're pushing your resistance muscles and you feel the
4179.56s:  burned, you can go yes, yes, you can step into another layer of discomfort and go yes.
4189.72s:  The language you use and maybe it's just a language problem and I'm misunderstanding it
4195.16s:  that I'm fighting myself. I have to fight. I have to push.
4199.80s:  And that may be a way of life for you and that is okay. But I'm going to just plant a little seed
4208.76s:  that says, Eric, you've fought everything all your life. There's a way to step into challenges.
4217.80s:  There's a way to step into trading. There's a way to cooperate with your inner
4223.56s:  bitch in a way that's going to give you a life with a lot less stress and a lot less push
4231.88s:  and a lot less inner conflict. That was great.
4238.44s:  Okay, well, that's where we go next. I love it. Richard, it is always a blast chatting with you,
4245.64s:  honestly, especially thank you for taking the time to like work me through that exercise. And
4250.68s:  I'm not going to lie, you were absolutely right in terms of like the vulnerability of doing that
4255.80s:  in something like this. I don't even like being on camera, let alone talking from the perspective
4261.64s:  of this fucking part of myself that I fight with all the time. So it's very cool though that
4269.16s:  you're willing to take the time to share some of this with people. So first off, genuinely, thank you
4274.76s:  not only for hanging out for the session, but also like straight up working with me, right? Like
4279.24s:  you genuinely just worked with me for a big part of that session. So I'm very appreciative of that.
4283.88s:  Thank you. Oh, Eric, you are a pleasure to be with, to work with, to talk to your open, your
4291.08s:  integrity, your desire for a better self and a better world around you. Oh my gosh, that motivation,
4300.36s:  that clarity really makes a difference. So I appreciate you and thank you very much.
4305.64s:  Oh, and Inter-Bitch. Yeah. Thank you for taking care of Eric when he was a kid. And I look forward
4311.80s:  to seeing your new job title in a couple of weeks. So let me know how that goes, Inter-Bitch.
4319.80s:  Inter-Bitch, thank you as well. I suppose from my perspective.
4324.76s:  Awesome, Richard. Thank you so much. What fun. Thank you, Eric. You take care and have a
4328.44s:  most wonderful rest of the day. Thank you.
