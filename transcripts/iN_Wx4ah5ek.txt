0.00s: What's up everybody, Eric here. Welcome back to the Outlier podcast where we talk all
7.40s: things abnormal. We're looking to understand kind of high-end performance, what that looks
12.56s: like, how we get there, how people achieve it. And I got my friend back on Richard. This
16.76s: is your second time on the podcast, but welcome back. Great to have you.
19.96s: Well, thank you. It's great to be here. And we had such a good time last time that I
24.68s: can't see. We're only going up from here. That's, I mean, that's the goal. I never really
31.46s: underestimate my ability to dork stuff up, but, you know, I think we'll be all right.
37.04s: I'm pretty confident we're going to do okay. So one of the random questions I have complete,
46.30s: complete aside, but obviously your background is in psychology. And that's what we talked
50.80s: a lot about in the last conversation. And from a general perspective, I am very curious
57.20s: what your take is specifically on the impact of like COVID isolation on traders. What impact
67.32s: do you think that that had from a psychological standpoint?
69.84s: Well, if we look at the broad range of possible careers or jobs, probably that's the minimum
79.36s: impact. I mean, traders tend to be introverted. They tend to be engineers. They tend to be
84.80s: more technically oriented or, you know, focusing on the screen is where they get their jollies.
91.92s: So people come and go, so my guess is it's minimal. Now I'm always happy to hear from
97.52s: people who said, nope, COVID really did me enter. Man, COVID was a real boon for me because
103.40s: I got to stay home and didn't have to go into the office and I trade part time. So I would
108.84s: be really interesting to see how traders actually answer that question. But my guess is on the scale
113.88s: of things, probably not so much. Yeah, that's actually a really fair expectation. It's I share
121.56s: most of it. One of the things I do hypothesize and I'm curious or take on it is with more people
129.24s: being funneled into trading that might not have been traders before. We kind of saw that during
135.40s: COVID and expansion in trading activity from the retail perspective at least. I wonder if that
142.84s: cohort specifically because during COVID more so being pushed into trading, not being able to
150.92s: directly connect with other people, if they were looking to connect more with traders online,
157.32s: other traders trading communities. And if that had any impact on performance because anything
163.72s: that I've read from a broader study perspective off of something like SSR and social science research
170.04s: network, it seems to find that when retail traders get together and make collective decisions,
175.24s: it's generally not great for them. So again, maybe it's a little too loosely put together for
183.32s: there to be direct ties there. But I was wondering if during COVID more people trading that haven't
187.96s: been trading before, those people, newer people tend to want to connect with others and whatever
193.72s: they're doing because they know they don't know what they're doing. Did that lead to a potential rise
197.96s: in people banning together, sharing ideas and what impact that would have on the experience?
203.40s: Yeah, well, I don't have any data on that. I don't have any information. So all I know is that
210.44s: when traders first start, what you mentioned is that there's just an overwhelming
216.28s: amount of data, material, strategies, time, preferences. Oh my gosh, risk preferences. It's just,
226.28s: it's a complex adaptive system. And as a result, there's an infinite amount of inputs that impact other inputs.
235.24s: So it can be really overwhelming. And especially the new traders who say, oh, I'm an engineer. I'm a mathematician.
242.04s: I'm a physics major. We can solve this. So they come in with this sense of being able to do it.
251.48s: And when they start trading, the first indication of whether or not they're successful
258.36s: is whether or not they made a good trade. Yes, my dreams are coming true.
265.72s: Or oh my god, I've lost three in a row. So they're very trade dependent, profit dependent,
272.84s: very short term. So next they say they look at strategies. And where the groups are really
278.92s: helpful here is for somebody else to step you through their strategy. Even if it doesn't make sense
286.44s: for you or you for your personality, your time frames or whatever. If you have somebody else who
293.16s: says, here's a strategy. And then somebody else says, here's another one and another one.
297.24s: What you pick up is the process for creating and analyzing strategies. Then the next step is you
304.52s: get confidence in your strategy. You do the back testing. You do the work. It tests out. And then
310.84s: you go to trade it. And you got this confidence in it. And all of a sudden you've lost four
316.28s: trades in a row. Oh my gosh. Or the worst thing that can happen, like when I built a
323.64s: floor trading firm is hired, you know, a guy would clerk for me for six months or a year. I'd
329.56s: give him a badge, capitalize him. And what's the worst thing that could happen the first week?
336.44s: I would guess if they win. Yes, if he made money. Because all the dreams, all the hopes,
343.00s: everything is future is dad's going to appreciate me. My my spouse will love me more. I'll get
348.44s: laid more often or whatever. All these dreams are connected to making money. All of a sudden,
353.72s: they're going to come true. I am God. The best thing that could happen is when they come in,
362.28s: their hands were shaking and rich. I lost some of your money this this week. I know. I watch
371.96s: numbers every day. Okay, so let's find out what happened. Let's step through the first day of
378.12s: trading. What did you see? What did you notice? Okay, here's something to broaden or here's here's
383.64s: a focus you had. Here's another way of focusing. We step through it. And then slowly they can build
388.76s: the confidence out of their behaviors rather than an accidental windfall.
393.16s: I really I like the highlight there specifically on kind of the process. And then something I talk a
402.68s: lot about. I think it's relevant because at least I started trading 2007 when I was really young
409.56s: fortunately. And so I've been doing this so long. They made you so young. Yeah, yeah.
415.72s: Great night. Actually, I just turned 33 yesterday. Oh, man, you're so young. Oh, geez.
424.04s: Don't don't ever say that you were young. Like an ARP card soon or something. I don't know when you
429.16s: get those, but but what I've really developed an appreciation for at least in my existence is
438.36s: an appreciation of the process in embracing delayed gratification. I think a big part of that
445.16s: came from just the early activities that I got into when I was young, things like martial arts,
452.12s: weightlifting, you don't really see instant results in any of those things. And you actually kind of
456.84s: go through periods where you're putting in perceivably a lot of effort and you're seeing very
461.00s: little out of it. But you just keep doing it. You just keep seeing it through. And I find that
466.36s: really to have helped me a lot in trading. Now, one of the things I see a lot in traders is that
473.24s: and this is my opinion again, seeking your expertise. It seems like traders often over emphasize
481.24s: any one single trade. And they kind of forget that each one of these trades ideally is part of a
490.04s: well-developed system that's designed to be bared out over years, hopefully.
497.16s: Well, it's not only every single trade, but how about every single tech?
503.24s: Oh, my dreams are going to come true. Wow, I'm going to have that Ferrari. Well, my dad's going
509.40s: to respect me. Wow. Oh, tick tock. Oh, my God. Maybe I should get out. Oh, oh, no, no, no. Oh, it's
516.36s: gone. It's a hit into my stop. I better cancel the stop. I can't end my dream. So yes. So what
525.64s: you talked about is process. And when you're weightlifting, that's a really good metaphor because
533.64s: like for a long time, I didn't exercise. My back gave me problems. And it was just all sorts of
540.92s: things. You know, getting out of a car. I had a lift my leg up. I'm going to be 77 this year. So,
546.60s: you know, time takes a toll. But I started doing some exercises. And
555.08s: the it's not like it's delayed gratification for me. It's like it's wow. I can feel my muscles
565.48s: growing. You know, when you're at that burn place and you just burn anything, this is still so good
570.76s: because I know it's given me the power to live the life I want. Wow. So what we do is we set up
578.04s: a process with our trading clients in which before they have to be disciplined after we
583.88s: use willpower, I have to suppress my emotions. I have to execute my trades. And what we're doing
589.24s: is we're setting up an internal struggle. But instead we say, I'm going to step into this process
596.52s: and it feels so good to have the power to be able to do that. Oh my gosh. If we can do that in the
603.96s: moment, like if I'm with a client and they're executing their system and they've been doing it
609.24s: for a day and they come to me and say, Rich, it felt so good to feel my trading power.
617.40s: It felt so good because when we can get it to the point where they stop struggling and it's an
623.96s: invitation to feel good. Wow. As soon as we do that, then we're out of that internal struggle
631.32s: willpower and discipline. That's interesting. And it leads to a follow-on question I have for you
637.64s: because it's something I've kind of employed over my life. I think a lot of it's just from my
642.76s: time in the Marine Corps where you're not really, I guess the easiest way to describe it is,
649.16s: at least for a Marine officer, our ideal leader is somebody that is the keel to a ship. Somebody
657.08s: that when shit is going haywire, they're calm, cool, collected, they have a plan and they will
662.76s: work through it. Same thing if everybody's having a great time, that same leader is still probably
668.92s: more so leaning towards comical and collected. And what I think about in my life in general is
676.60s: I have no problem like feeling happiness. I'm generally, I tend towards happiness. I'm a
681.56s: happy human being. I'm happy to be here. But when I'm executing something like my trades, I really
687.56s: keep any of that in check. And one of the things I postulate, and again, I'm wondering if your
694.28s: research bears this out or your experience where if a trader goes through this process where they
700.60s: experience elation, to me what I typically think about with that is, well, if you feel elation
707.40s: dispares around the corner, if you feel one of those, the other one is there. I think it's way too
712.28s: difficult to isolate just feeling good and never feeling bad. So when it comes from like to trading
718.52s: and a trading perspective, what are your thoughts on regulating that emotional roller coaster?
725.00s: Does it make sense? Does it not make sense to you? Does it good to have like a big carrot in front of
729.24s: you? Be more disciplined, use little powers, shove those emotions down, don't recognize
735.80s: that? We have a different approach. So it's first is awareness. So we have, in fact, I could even
746.44s: show you on a screen, we have something called our set scores, sensations, emotions, and thoughts.
751.48s: And we score them. And the goal is first just raw awareness. Like right now, let's do it.
760.84s: Just I'm extol tight. My voice is a little, I'm going to exaggerate a little more like this
767.24s: because I'm pushing it. So what if I wasn't pushing so hard? Wow, do I feel different right now?
778.04s: So the first is awareness. Number two is acceptance.
783.64s: If I judge myself for everything I become aware of, then I'm setting up another internal conflict.
794.92s: But if I say, okay, my stomach was tight, I was pushing my voice, and I said, okay, so I noticed it,
802.44s: is that what I want? And the third piece is agency. So awareness accepted. So when you're trading,
809.72s: you made a good trade. Yes, I followed my rules. In fact, we have a term for that. It's a lucrative
816.28s: trade, whether it's profitable or not. You know, what you taught brought up earlier is process.
821.96s: We just keep going back to process process. Occasionally, put your head up, check your outcome,
828.12s: back to process. So it's like a wave. So awareness, acceptance, I don't
833.96s: re-rate myself or having a tight stomach or pushing my voice hard. I just say, okay, that's
839.32s: interested. I was exciting. I love talking to Eric. I'm all excited about things. My voice got
845.80s: agency. Is that what do I want now? Oh, I'd rather be really relaxed with Eric, really relax with
854.60s: people watching this. Okay, so I can do that. So awareness, acceptance, and agency.
861.08s: Interesting. So in that process, then, do you guys have tools to try to mitigate the inclusion
873.16s: of either euphoria or despair? Well, Eric, we don't mitigate. We say, well, like, for example,
887.32s: the other day, I was really down about something. And I could say, rich, don't be down.
891.96s: Mitigate this down this. Or I could say, wow, that's fascinating. I'm really down. What's going on?
899.64s: Now, this is really important to me. And it's not going like I expected. What do I have attached to it?
905.40s: Oh, I have some attached, some meaningful behaviors for the next few years. And if this doesn't go,
911.16s: that kind of dream that I was unaware of kind of collapses. Okay, no wonder. Huh, okay,
918.28s: rich. You're all right. So let's reevaluate the dream. So in other words, what I did right there
925.48s: was rather than mitigating the feeling is awareness, accepting it. What is its message for me?
933.48s: So oftentimes we'll come up in private coaching with voices. Different parts of ourselves that
940.20s: represent a piece of legacy behaviors or beliefs that are preventing us from getting what we want.
950.92s: So Eric, one of the things you talked about, and I don't know if you want to go there,
955.24s: but was in terms of your own trading, yeah, taking a look at that process in terms of where you're at.
961.88s: I'd be happy to go there if you're interested. I would love to. Yeah, let's do it. Walk me through
965.40s: whatever you need me to do. Okay, so if you're looking at your trading and you're brought, you okay?
971.56s: Oh, yeah, I just have to like move around in my chair. Normally, I have like a sitting and standing
976.36s: desk. So normally like every 10 minutes I go up and down. But obviously, yeah, I can't do that here
982.20s: otherwise it blocks the camera. So I just fed you in my chair. Okay. Ah, so how long have you been
988.68s: trading? Uh, 16 years. So I started in 2007. Okay.
997.40s: If you're looking at your trading progress, what are you really happy with? What's gone?
1003.40s: What progress have you made in terms of your own psychology or mindset?
1008.12s: Um, in terms of mindset, I think the progress I've made the most is actually probably the
1015.16s: antithesis of what you guys teach. But it's, it's being indifferent. I am, if I have an update,
1022.68s: I am indifferent. If I have a down day, I'm indifferent. The way I think about it is at this point,
1030.28s: I've done a tremendous amount of research on how I'm choosing to deploy. Though I know there's
1037.16s: efficacy behind it, regardless of how I may or may not feel. So regardless of how I feel, I seek to
1044.36s: execute the plan. Yes. And back, people who are in disciplined positions, such as the armed forces,
1054.12s: and they've gone through hell and they, the only thing that saves them is stand on track,
1059.56s: stand disciplined, uh, airline pilots, uh, people, traders, there is a process of saying,
1072.04s: I'm disciplined, focused scene. I'm the whole of the, I'm the, what the keel of the ship.
1080.76s: I'm staying on focus. How I reinterpret that is I feel better as a human being.
1090.68s: Staying on purpose. I know lives are a stake or money is a stake.
1095.48s: And so for this moment, I'm going to focus on that and that feels better. And we call that discipline.
1107.00s: But if you check yourself and imagine yourself being undisciplined while you're on a patrol or
1116.20s: undisciplined if you're an airline pilot or if you're undisciplined as a trader. And in that moment,
1124.28s: where you know the direction, your confidence in what you do, you're repeating your strategy,
1131.80s: if you imagine stepping outside of that, it's going to feel like hell,
1137.48s: because you know the circumstances. So for me, I reinterpret many people, I, they say, well,
1143.48s: discipline is the key. And I say, I'll bet you it feels better to stay in that spot,
1148.92s: rather than being undisciplined. So I respect the people who say discipline because
1155.56s: what they've learned is that their life experience improves dramatically. And that feels so much
1163.56s: better in the bigger picture. Yeah, I think it's accurate. And the other thing I've come to really
1170.28s: appreciate with respect to something like discipline is I find at least for me, and I do
1176.92s: consider myself a moderately disciplined human. But I still find that internal, I call my inner
1183.64s: bitch. But there's this internal monologue with myself where I'm constantly trying to negotiate
1190.60s: with myself between what I consider like my lower level thought process and the higher level
1196.04s: thought process, lower level being more reptilian, immediate gratification seeking higher level
1202.12s: understanding delayed gratification, pursuing something longer term. And those two are odds for me
1208.76s: very regularly. Okay, and you call that lower part your bitch, is that right? The inner bitch.
1214.28s: Yeah, the inner bitch. Okay. The comfort seeking inner bitch. Yeah.
1218.44s: Very, very important. Yeah. I would like to have your permission to have a conversation with the
1225.00s: inner bitch. Oh, he don't get to come out. It's not even there. We could try to find him. But
1231.08s: I don't yeah, let's. Okay, so right now, notice your body language. You notice,
1237.32s: I was trying to like lean back to get the defense mechanisms and then to try to summon the inner
1245.96s: bitch. Okay, you don't have to. Okay, that's not your job. I'll be there anyways. If I have,
1252.12s: if I have your permission, I will, of course, I will see. Okay, Eric's inner bitch. Eric
1258.92s: gave me permission to talk to you. And I would like to do so with a following understanding.
1266.12s: I believe you are there and you came to Eric with positive intent for his life.
1276.04s: And with that understanding, may I have a conversation with you? Please. Okay. So your
1284.44s: Eric's inner bitch. Is that right? Yes. Okay. And you are there to help him out in
1292.28s: what way? What's your positive intent for Eric? I imagine the inner bitch is
1303.56s: usually pronoun I. I prioritize immediate gratification.
1311.80s: Okay. So you're there to help Eric feel better in difficult situations. Does that sound right?
1320.76s: In general, yes. In general. Okay. Are there times that you have other a different mission?
1328.92s: I wouldn't limit it to difficult situations. I think in general, I seek immediate gratification.
1336.92s: Okay. And when you give Eric immediate gratification, gratification, does he feel better in that moment?
1345.48s: In that moment. Forget everything else. Just that moment. Does he feel better?
1353.80s: Yeah. I would say so. Okay. Great. So let's just focus this on trading. So when he's trading
1362.84s: and you his inner bitch come to him to give him a moment of inner gratification or give him some
1372.36s: instant gratification. How do you do that? What do you tell him? What do you say to him? What do you
1378.36s: make his hand do to the mouse? How do you give him that inner that gratification? All of your
1385.48s: impulse. So you tell him, okay, so you are his impulse, is that right? Yeah. I would give him an
1393.16s: input that executes something that would make him feel better about his current moment. Okay.
1405.24s: So what you do is when he's under either stress or anxiety or whatever,
1411.24s: you give him some activity to do that for that moment is going to relieve that pressure. Is that right? Yeah. That sounds right.
1422.60s: Okay. So may I give you an appreciation? Please.
1429.88s: A lot of people beat themselves up. A lot of people hurt themselves. A lot of people don't
1435.16s: allow themselves any kind of gratification at all. Gratification at all. So the appreciation is,
1443.80s: thank you, are giving Eric some gratification and helping him feel better in some situations when
1451.48s: he's trading. So my appreciation. Thank you. Good. So now that we have that straight and you give him
1459.32s: gratification, how does that work out in just in terms of trading in the long term when you're doing that?
1467.96s: Typically decreases performance. And how does that impact Eric's gratification?
1476.44s: Negatively. Negatively. So what you do is in the moment like a drug or something like that,
1483.00s: you get a you give him a momentarily high, but there's over the longer term, there's a bigger price
1487.96s: to be paid for that. Is that right? Yes. Excellent. So how would you like
1495.88s: to give him gratification? Well, maybe I'll let me back up a bit.
1503.48s: So let's review the question. Do you have positive intent for Eric or are you there to sabotage him?
1511.16s: And both answers are fine. You can be totally honest. As Eric, I think your term, the intention is
1521.32s: positive in nature. My intention is positive in nature short term. Okay. And long term.
1530.20s: I don't think about that. Don't think about that. Not even in your world.
1537.40s: Okay.
1541.48s: And your impact on that immediate gratification since that's the only world you live in. And
1548.84s: thank you for pointing that out. That's really important.
1555.24s: Feels good in the moment, but as you says, there's a price to be paid long term. Is that right?
1561.16s: Correct. Okay.
1562.52s: So Eric's inner bitch, most traders have a similar character.
1575.56s: And most of their characters are unwilling to give up their job. For example, how outside of
1582.76s: trading or maybe just because of trading, how long have you been with Eric?
1587.08s: Probably since I was a kid.
1594.52s: Kid. 5, 6, 7, 10.
1599.24s: Probably around there. Okay. What was going on with Eric where he needed instant gratification
1606.28s: when he was a kid? A lot of friction at home. A lot of friction at home. Okay.
1615.40s: So you were you came to him. You saw this little boy living with a lot of friction at home.
1622.44s: And you says, I'm going to give him a shot of inner gratification. Is that right? Yeah.
1628.84s: Yeah. So we can really appreciate your job because the little boy didn't have many options
1635.64s: or alternatives. He didn't have much power. He couldn't change the family.
1640.60s: Excellent. So again, an appreciation for coming to a little boy who couldn't change his circumstances.
1654.76s: And to get him through it, you gave him some internal gratification.
1660.44s: That was really appropriate when Eric was a little boy. So thank you.
1667.00s: Thank you. So you've been with Eric and you've a long time now. You're still a young man.
1676.20s: He is still a young man.
1681.80s: And now Eric's ability is a mature adult. And his time frames have shifted.
1691.80s: So my question in her bitch is, have you shifted time frames along with him?
1698.20s: No. No.
1704.20s: Given what you did for Eric when he was a little boy and saved him,
1712.04s: the situation, I don't know how bad it was. But even for little kids, I know when I was a little
1718.12s: boy, even the smallest things because I didn't have any frame of reference. We're just horrific.
1726.04s: Looking back on it, go, huh? But you really helped him out there.
1733.16s: So would you be willing to expand your role, to expand your support for Eric
1742.52s: to help him in a longer time frame?
1749.56s: Yes. Okay.
1753.40s: So as I understand it right now, the way you do that is give him some instant gratification
1759.72s: to do something, to move, to relieve the stresses, that right? Yeah. Okay. And you don't know
1767.96s: anything outside of that world because you don't know about the long term. That's not even
1772.60s: part of your world. Is that right?
1783.64s: So there's a couple of ways we can go here and I need your advice, inner bitch.
1788.84s: One way is for you to start taking a peek out there, spreading the curtains a little bit,
1794.36s: taking a peek to that long term result, or develop a partner that can hold your hand and work with you
1807.08s: that has a longer gratification, a time period. So as Eric's inner bitch with his positive intent in mind,
1817.00s: which way do you think would be more effective as an invitation to work with Eric on a longer time
1825.32s: frame, creating another part of him, or you expanding your view outside of the curtains?
1833.80s: The latter of those two, expanding the view. Expanding the view. I think so. Excellent.
1840.60s: Okay. We've got time. Do you recall a time when you were in a trade, an inner bitch came to you
1855.40s: and said, we need some relief. We need some gratification. Let's do it right now. Do you recall that?
1861.24s: Hey. What? Today. Today. Oh, great. Okay. Tell me what was going on.
1869.00s: I had a zero DTE trade on, sorry, just to say with the exercise, am I explaining the trade from the
1878.12s: inner bitch's perspective or from Eric's perspective? Good question. Just as a neutral observer,
1884.60s: what's going on? Okay. Got it. Yeah. So today, there was a zero DTE SPX trade on. The
1893.80s: trade was going well for most of the time that it was on, started to turn over. It turned over,
1901.80s: almost got stopped out. No problem at that point. Then it started to get above break even. So then
1911.16s: the first impulse to intervene was there. Then that impulse was suppressed. And then from there,
1922.20s: the trade started moving in the other, it was a short strangle to be clear. So I had risk
1931.08s: both to the downside and so it started going the other direction as trades do. And the
1941.24s: I think of the desired intervention was as it was moving back up, the impulse was, this was
1953.64s: already a loser today. It's now a good winner objectively. You can just exit now, take your
1963.32s: profit and then move on. Okay. So let's go back to that exact moment where the inner bitch came
1973.64s: to you and said, take your profit now. Okay. So imagine the screen, the market's going up,
1981.16s: is that right? And it's heading to the other side of the strangle. Okay. So I want you to just stay
1988.68s: with that and step into that world. You can look at the screen or just imagine the screen.
1999.72s: And notice the voice in your head. And what is the voice saying?
2006.52s: Sorry, just to clarify, am I going back to that point in time? I went first came in. Okay. Got it.
2012.52s: At that point in time, right now I am. So present tense. Right now the trade is starting to move
2022.76s: against me in the other direction. Take your profits now so that it doesn't turn into a loser.
2029.16s: Okay. And if it turns into a loser, what does that say?
2032.60s: Lost money today. And what does it say if Eric lost money today?
2042.68s: Genuinely nothing more than that. And it gives you a feeling if you
2051.32s: okay frustration. Okay. So if we by was to step inside of Eric's body,
2058.36s: how would I know I'm frustrated just physiologically? What would I notice by stepped inside your body
2064.76s: and felt that frustration? Probably elevated heart rate. Okay. Elevated heart rate.
2074.52s: I don't want to call it like maybe hyper attention. Like very, very. Yeah, I'm not sure the
2082.12s: correct term for that. Yeah, the kind of hyper attentive.
2092.04s: And then like you're hunting on the savannahs and you're really close to the prey hyper
2098.36s: attentive. Yeah. Yeah. And then I would also add on like annoyed in some capacity. We'd be
2105.00s: tied to that as well like annoyance annoyance. Okay. And so in your body, we have a
2111.88s: elevated heart rate. Anything else? Oh, yes, sorry. Speaking inside the body.
2126.12s: I think the other thing that comes to mind is this is the battle between the inner bitch and then
2133.32s: the higher mind. That's like as I close my eyes and consider that moment, that's the crescendo.
2139.08s: That's like the overwhelming. So dropping down into the primitive brain, the inner bitch,
2145.72s: and that taken over versus the higher level neocortex cognitive part.
2153.32s: Yeah, there's like a very big debate slash fight going on between those.
2163.40s: I'm going to diverge a little bit here. Well, movie world wars. See, have you seen that
2167.88s: Brad Pitt? And at some point he's running with his family up to stairs in a building or something
2174.44s: on. And he's touched by a zombie, which means that he could be coming zombie and kill his family
2181.96s: or maybe not. He doesn't know. So he stands on the edge of the building, leans forward,
2187.00s: is far forward as he can without falling. And the hope is at that moment that he feels he's
2193.80s: turning into a zombie as enough agency to lean forward and fall and save his family.
2201.72s: So it's that kind of thing. Once we drop down into that, when I drop down,
2208.20s: and my particular drop down now is eating my whites too much apple pie.
2213.56s: It's over. I'll say I'm going to have one piece. It's over.
2224.04s: Okay, so we have that put we're just on the edge. Our heart rates have elevated.
2232.04s: Elvated. Yep. And what else any muscular and things you notice? So right now step into that,
2236.52s: we're right at that edge. Probably,
2241.32s: probably like sitting attentively. So like right now I'm leaned back. I imagine what I'm
2245.96s: trading. I'm more like that original posture. Yeah. So facial muscles, anything?
2253.80s: Think so. Okay. Lean forward, focused, elevated heart rate. And we're really close to being
2263.72s: taking over by the inner bitch and just getting out. Okay. And as you notice that
2278.76s: sitting here with rich, what would your preference be in terms of your behavior?
2285.80s: As the inner bitch, I would prefer him to have exited the trade.
2293.40s: Okay. Eric exit the trade right now. As Eric in his higher cognitive abilities and his
2302.76s: rational probability sense and long term thinking, what would his behavior be?
2311.00s: In response to that? Or just period if there wasn't an inner bitch.
2315.88s: Oh, that nothing. It would just be, yeah, let's let the trade do what it does have to do.
2323.24s: Right. So higher level Eric that's watching this battle.
2332.04s: Okay. So let's bring ourselves back to that point.
2339.00s: Markets going higher.
2341.00s: Hmm.
2341.24s: Inter bitch says get out now while you still have a profit because it came close to losing money.
2351.00s: Eric's rational part. What do we call that? Does that have a name?
2355.32s: Eric is me.
2356.44s: Eric. Okay. So and Eric knows that this is a probability game. And if he lets all the trades play out
2362.68s: and in the long term, it's going to work out better. Is that correct?
2366.28s: Yeah. I think the overwhelming thought is regardless of the outcome of this one single event,
2376.60s: the system has to play out in order for it to have any efficacy. Right.
2384.84s: So as Eric in his highest level self is awareness of both of these
2392.28s: parts of Eric,
2398.04s: can you look at both of them if you're looking down on them having this
2403.80s: leaning on the edge of the building?
2409.80s: And you're looking down from it from your highest self even higher than the rational self.
2414.44s: Can you elicit compassion for both parts?
2421.48s: Absolutely.
2422.68s: Absolutely. We can have compassion for the inner bitch and we can have compassion for Eric.
2436.76s: So look down on the inner bitch and give him an appreciation in this moment.
2441.72s: Thank you.
2443.96s: I would say thank you for trying to salvage the trade.
2453.88s: And
2459.88s: is the end supposed to be like a broader?
2462.92s: Yeah, it can be. Or we can just move on.
2467.00s: Not for I can add an and I think the and there would be for looking out for Eric in the short term.
2475.32s: That's the motivation there.
2478.52s: Exactly.
2484.52s: I appreciate that. You gave me the message.
2489.08s: I let you come. I've heard the message. I've given you an appreciation.
2494.68s: And now I'm going to let it go.
2498.76s: So try something like that. Try an awareness, an appreciation.
2506.44s: And thank you.
2508.36s: And let that experience come and go.
2515.24s: So I acknowledge
2516.84s: your knowledge.
2518.92s: During that trade, the intentions of the inner bitch were good in the short term.
2526.92s: Okay. Talk to them directly right now in that moment.
2529.72s: You're standing on that edge.
2532.52s: And have this conversation with them while you're just leaning forward.
2536.52s: Got it.
2537.80s: So thank you for your awareness during that trade.
2541.48s: I appreciate you looking out for the outcome of the trade.
2546.12s: This specific trade.
2550.28s: I appreciate that you're paying close attention to each individual trade
2557.48s: and trying to achieve an optimal outcome.
2563.88s: So let it go part.
2565.96s: I'm not sure what to do there.
2567.40s: Yeah.
2569.56s: So I've given you appreciation.
2571.40s: You've done your job.
2573.24s: Well done.
2574.28s: Thank you.
2575.24s: And goodbye for now.
2576.68s: And we'll see you again.
2578.12s: Try that or something else.
2581.16s: So I've given you the appreciation.
2584.12s: Thank you for what you've done.
2587.16s: Goodbye for now.
2591.56s: Okay. How does that feel?
2592.84s: What are you noticing your body as you do that?
2596.68s: It's an interesting.
2598.28s: Honestly, the biggest thing is it's fascinating to take on the avatar of the inner
2605.40s: bitch.
2608.36s: So I think it feels interesting to like spend time viewing the world from that
2616.20s: perspective that I spend so much time to your point just stuffing down.
2625.40s: Excellent.
2626.60s: So what you're doing, this is just to start
2630.04s: making that connection and a positive, healthy relationship with that part.
2635.24s: So we're not stuffing.
2636.76s: We're not disciplining.
2638.04s: We're not well-power.
2639.48s: In fact, the opposite.
2640.44s: We're appreciating.
2642.12s: That voice has a lot to say about your experience from when you were a kid
2646.84s: and growing up.
2647.64s: It's repeated patterns.
2649.88s: What happens is
2651.56s: when we're powerless and we don't have many many options in our life,
2657.80s: interesting or trade options, we don't have many options in our life,
2663.00s: we create the avatars, we create the parts of ourselves
2669.48s: that when we're powerless, we give us momentary relief.
2674.68s: The younger we are, the more that pattern replicates itself in every part
2681.64s: of our lives.
2685.08s: So in my example, my mom was depressed, distant.
2690.68s: I remember one kind thing from her, all my life.
2695.56s: That's brutal.
2699.64s: And my response was to be self-sufficient emotionally.
2707.56s: Boy, did that help out?
2709.48s: Man, that saved this little kid from going crazy or doing drugs or all sorts of other
2714.92s: I did some destructive behaviors, but fortunately I live.
2717.80s: Who doesn't?
2719.96s: Who does?
2720.52s: But that part, as I grew older to be that self-sufficient emotional part,
2728.12s: that's what I wanted.
2729.56s: That's what I needed.
2731.56s: But we tend to repeat the survival patterns that saved us.
2737.80s: And I could go into some details, but I won't hear.
2741.00s: But I needed to repeat the survival pattern of how my mom
2748.52s: treated me so that I could survive it.
2753.48s: Sounds nuts, doesn't it?
2756.60s: But.
2757.56s: Thousand.
2758.52s: Okay.
2759.40s: So, but go ahead.
2761.96s: I was going to say one of the things I've always been so curious about
2766.60s: is it's like your point not limited to trading.
2770.60s: It's like on a daily basis, I'm fighting with the inner bitch about everything.
2777.40s: Perfect example.
2778.52s: My birthday was yesterday.
2780.28s: My wife made me brownies.
2783.80s: I don't need to eat.
2784.76s: I don't need to eat.
2785.56s: Thank you.
2786.12s: I don't need to eat a brownie.
2788.36s: It doesn't, it does not need to be in my diet.
2790.76s: But then the inner bitch goes to, oh, well, your wife made them for you.
2796.04s: You can't not eat them.
2797.32s: It's just impactful.
2798.68s: You would enjoy the brownie.
2800.36s: But meanwhile, the higher part of my mind is saying, I don't need the fucking brownie.
2805.64s: So I'm not going to eat it.
2807.56s: So it's like what you're highlighting there, kind of that revisiting of that survival mechanism,
2813.16s: it actually clarifies a pretty significant question I've had for some time now, which is,
2819.48s: I already know the outcome of most of these instances.
2823.56s: And it's, Eric is going to do what Eric wants to do,
2827.16s: regardless of what the inner bitch suggests.
2830.28s: However, I never understood why it was so pervasive in so many different things.
2835.88s: But that literally explains a large part of it, is that it's a kind of a subwritten
2841.72s: survival mechanism that is reiterating.
2845.16s: Yeah, yeah.
2850.04s: And sometimes it just pays appreciate the wife eat the brownie.
2855.24s: I know. That is like, it's the most compelling argument.
2858.84s: It's so difficult to turn that one down because the way I look at that is it's,
2863.72s: it literally is selfless intent.
2866.60s: If it was just a brownie that I had bought for myself, I would have, there would be no
2870.84s: conversation about it. I wouldn't have even bought it.
2873.16s: Right. But because it came from my wife, then I'm like,
2876.52s: fuck, this now just got more complicated.
2880.28s: Yeah, I tell you, I could, we could put me on the hot seat here.
2887.96s: Food has been associated with love and a real deep inner need.
2895.24s: And I'll be damned that, you know, just like your, that lower part that kicks in.
2902.84s: That's really powerful for me.
2905.00s: So, you know, that has been a struggle.
2908.20s: And I am reframing it.
2911.32s: Ah, this is love. Is there another way that I would like to get love?
2916.52s: My survival mechanism goes and says, no, no, no, if you get love another way,
2923.16s: you don't know what's going to happen.
2924.68s: They could leave you, you could get unloved.
2927.16s: So just eat the substitute.
2933.64s: Take a deep breath, Eric.
2939.64s: May I give you an appreciation?
2941.88s: Please.
2943.16s: Yeah, you did something.
2945.48s: Talk to a voice inside of you. Talk to a part of yourself.
2949.80s: That's recorded.
2951.32s: The courage you have right now to do that is going to touch hundreds of people who see this video.
2959.24s: So, you have given an incredible gift.
2962.76s: So thank you.
2964.52s: Thank you for walking me through that.
2965.88s: And also genuinely thank you for connecting me with a part of myself that I spend most of my
2972.52s: time stuffing in a fucking corner.
2974.36s: So it is, especially, and I do want to linger on the point that you highlighted,
2979.72s: because you already know this.
2981.96s: You've seen this a million times.
2983.64s: But for kind of a Neanderthal like myself, it is kind of a knob
2989.24s: realization that you connected the pleasure, seeking behavior, the instant gratification
2996.68s: preference, you connected it with a positive motive.
3000.76s: That's really interesting to me because typically I look at it as obviously the impact on the
3008.68s: broad system.
3009.80s: But I don't even acknowledge that the short term gratification seeking is actually like
3017.00s: genuinely positively incentivized in some capacity.
3020.20s: That's a very interesting point.
3021.64s: And in some contexts, it's actually wonderful.
3027.48s: And so one thing we have to do is look at the context.
3031.08s: Just like a trading strategy is really useful in a certain market maker context,
3037.88s: that gratification when we're looking at some more central behaviors, for example.
3045.00s: God, that's wonderful.
3047.08s: A question for you.
3054.92s: One of the big motivations and kind of integrations in my psychology is
3060.92s: stelicism. I'm a huge practicer of stelicism.
3068.44s: And a big part of stelicism is things like when I think about
3078.28s: mitigating unwanted behavior, most of the time the way that I do that isn't just kind of
3087.80s: just trying to stuff it down.
3089.96s: I normally think of it more as like logically trying to reason through it.
3094.28s: But even as I reasoned through these, the trade process is a great example.
3099.16s: As I reasoned through that, that inner bitch still emerges from time to time.
3107.64s: And it tries to direct behavior.
3111.24s: So what would your prescription be if any that can really manage
3119.96s: how frequently that voice emerges or is it something from your experience that
3125.56s: is always going to be there, but you learn how to survive and manage with it better.
3132.28s: Or cooperate with it better.
3135.64s: Okay, inner bitch, you want some gratification.
3139.24s: We're going to go for a run and it's going to feel good.
3142.04s: We're going to make love and it's going to feel great.
3144.68s: We're going to do this. So hang on.
3147.08s: We got some instant gratification coming in trading.
3151.08s: You know, it just creates long-term dissatisfaction and loss of income.
3157.40s: So can you wait a moment?
3160.60s: So what we're doing is like a kid with what knocking on the door and saying,
3164.04s: can Eric come play?
3165.08s: Can Eric come play?
3166.20s: Oh, I got to do dishes first.
3167.88s: And then mom said I could come play.
3169.80s: I know that's probably a simple line of thought for you, but that is fascinating.
3178.36s: I another thing I have not thought of is trying to give it that kind of angle.
3184.20s: I think my natural disposition, as you could tell, obviously, is to just rely heavily on my
3193.80s: ability to logic and reason through things.
3197.88s: But it is an interesting process to actually acknowledge the other,
3203.80s: what I would consider to be like detracting behavior in the long run.
3207.88s: But to think through how to actually like interface with them as compared to just
3213.56s: reason around them.
3214.84s: No, we're not going to do that because of this.
3216.76s: And to your point, at no point am I putting something else in front of it knowingly saying,
3221.24s: but we're going to go training.
3223.40s: And that's going to be just a little bit and you'll enjoy that.
3226.04s: I haven't made that connection.
3229.80s: And for people who are really disciplined and it works well for,
3235.80s: my guess is they have such a pleasure of the discipline process itself that's stepping into
3243.32s: the discipline isn't a struggle, but it's a pleasure because they've learned that it gives
3249.64s: them long-term gratification.
3251.24s: So I'm not against discipline unless it creates an inner struggle.
3257.24s: But if we're stepping into it and say, wow, this feels better.
3261.72s: Every morning, I'll do my inside exercises three, four days a week.
3270.68s: And I said, I don't feel like it.
3272.92s: And all of a sudden, I'm laying out my mat and I'm doing my cat stretches.
3278.12s: And if I do that, then I do my other stretches.
3280.44s: Then I do some of my resistant stuff.
3282.92s: And it's not like I even decide anymore after three years.
3289.72s: I feel so good afterwards, my God.
3292.92s: So it's an invitation.
3294.36s: It's not a discipline that I have to do.
3296.92s: It's looking for that juicy, good feeling after I'm done.
3301.32s: That is, and especially focusing on like that positive aspect is a really interesting point.
3306.44s: Because for a lot of the things that I force myself to do shit quite literally all the time.
3313.72s: And most of the time to your point, I've found that the ability to impose
3324.44s: my higher thoughts over the short-term gratification-seeking part of myself
3330.36s: is very rewarding because it's very hard to do.
3334.60s: Just like with that fucking brownie, there's a great argument laying in front of me.
3338.92s: There's a great argument.
3340.92s: So the ability to turn that down is gratifying into a pretty significant degree.
3348.28s: Yeah.
3349.32s: And then you can say, oh, and then what you're going to celebrate it.
3353.08s: Oh, that feels really good.
3355.24s: Now, um, let's not go there.
3360.20s: Okay.
3362.84s: I have a to not go there to pivot to another spot.
3366.52s: I do have a question for you.
3369.00s: There's a study that I reference all the time.
3373.32s: And I would love to pull it up for you.
3375.40s: And I know we're coming up on time.
3376.52s: I don't want to keep you too long, but I really would love your thoughts on this.
3381.00s: So let me share my screen real quick.
3382.76s: I want to show you and I could zoom it in a bit.
3385.56s: So that is easier to
3389.24s: give me one sec.
3390.44s: We can make it.
3393.56s: Okay.
3394.36s: So this is a study.
3396.12s: It's called the behavior of individual investors by Barbara Nadine from University, California.
3402.28s: It's an older study.
3403.56s: But essentially what they find, they look at the trading behavior of individual investors.
3409.72s: And they look to summarize some of the commonalities between them.
3413.64s: And there's a couple of here that I really focus on when I'm talking at least to my audience.
3419.80s: My argument here is that if you want to be successful at something,
3423.72s: it's important to do two things.
3425.32s: It's important to see what the successful people that are doing or doing and to see what you can
3429.88s: pick up from them.
3431.00s: But it's equally as important to look at the droves of people that fail so that you know not to
3436.76s: do some of those behaviors.
3439.00s: And there's three things in here specifically that I find very interesting.
3445.56s: And I'm curious if you have a thought on one, two, all three as it pertains to traders.
3452.04s: And I'll just read them out really quick for anybody listening to the audio side of this.
3456.12s: One of them says, and again, this is in reference to individual investors.
3461.08s: So this is looking at their behaviors.
3462.84s: One of them says,
3463.80s: Del winning investments while holding losing investments in the disposition effect.
3471.00s: The next one is our heavily influenced by limited attention and past return performance
3477.08s: in their purchase decisions.
3479.32s: And then the next important one is engage in naive reinforcement learning
3485.48s: by repeating past behaviors that coincided with pleasure,
3489.24s: inner bitch that mother buck her while avoiding past behaviors that generated pain.
3495.24s: So the inner bitch that is learning to appreciate the pleasure it gives me and I am learning to work
3505.48s: with it to invite it into the appropriate context. So when you say you give it a negative
3515.32s: connotation, I am looking and inviting you to rephrase that in a positive way.
3524.76s: Okay. So yes, we sell winning investments because it feels so good in the moments like taking a drug.
3531.16s: And we know we don't lose money if we don't sell, right?
3534.52s: If we have something that's underwater, we don't lose money.
3538.52s: I've done surveys.
3540.20s: Do you lose money?
3542.20s: If you don't take a lot and the answer is 80% of the traders say no.
3550.60s: We really?
3551.80s: Yes.
3554.92s: So you don't lose money until you've closed the position.
3560.04s: Oh, that's the belief.
3563.96s: So needless to say, you may be familiar with prospect theory.
3569.08s: And that says that we get twice as much pain for a given loss as gain for the same, same gain.
3578.28s: And evolutionarily speaking, that makes a lot of sense.
3581.56s: So we sell our winning investments.
3584.12s: Yes.
3585.24s: And we hold the losing once and we hold the losing once so we don't take that pain.
3590.04s: Absolutely agree.
3591.48s: Engage tonight.
3592.92s: Go ahead.
3593.80s: Yeah, to follow up on that for number two,
3597.00s: do you have any recommendations for people on that one specifically on the disposition effect,
3602.04s: the propensity for traders to sell winners too fast and then to let the losers run?
3607.96s: Yeah, I just
3610.12s: stop it.
3612.44s: That's my man.
3613.00s: That's exactly that is exactly what I do.
3615.24s: Shut up.
3615.64s: Yeah, shut up.
3616.60s: Inter bench.
3617.48s: We're doing it this way.
3619.40s: Have you ever seen the video clip?
3623.32s: I just dropped the name.
3624.60s: Stop it.
3627.00s: Oh, I'll send it to you afterwards.
3628.68s: Yeah, not a fan.
3631.16s: Okay, but the answer to that question,
3634.84s: and if we have those tendencies that are neurologically connected,
3639.72s: started connecting when we were much younger,
3642.76s: we can say, just one, stop it, stop it,
3645.40s: and we do it again and again and again.
3648.52s: So that's what I work with with my private clients.
3652.12s: And by the way, if anybody is interested in
3656.28s: working with me in real time while you're trading,
3659.16s: working with me on these deeper issues,
3661.56s: the repeated behaviors that don't serve you,
3664.28s: I'm happy to have a conversation with them.
3667.16s: And then I'll throw a link to your contact information and your website
3671.16s: in the notes below for anybody that wants to check it out.
3673.48s: Right.
3673.88s: So selling winning investments that is built into our neurology
3678.44s: from one way we're on this event is
3681.72s: limited attention and past performance in their purchase decisions.
3685.56s: Yes, if we had a winner that's reinforced, engage in naive,
3689.96s: reinforcement learning by repeating past behaviors
3693.64s: that coincided with pleasure and avoided past behaviors that generated pain.
3698.36s: That's a bit more complex.
3700.76s: And I'm not sure of the impact of that because we tend to forget after time,
3705.88s: but I think generally that's true.
3709.56s: So if you were to prescribe an activity specifically for number two and number four here,
3716.52s: to help mitigate both of those, what activity would you prescribe?
3723.00s: Well, what we do is we rewire the brain.
3727.64s: I work with traders to create something we call
3730.44s: lousy and lucrative traits.
3733.32s: A lousy trade or let's say a lucrative trade is one where you got enough rest.
3737.88s: You did your pre-planning for the morning.
3740.68s: You were watching you executed the trade at the right time.
3744.28s: You stayed in it according to your strategy and your plan and you got out.
3748.76s: That is a lucrative trade.
3751.32s: Now it doesn't matter if it made money or it didn't.
3754.04s: Right.
3754.92s: Because we know over the larger sample size,
3758.36s: if executed in the right type of market, it's going to make money.
3764.52s: If we look at these general things, what I do is rewire the blame.
3772.92s: The pain of a loss is so built in at such a deep reptilian level
3779.16s: that rather than trying to rewire the neurology at that deep level,
3784.04s: what we do is just reframe a win and a loss.
3788.36s: So that a lucrative trade is a win.
3794.12s: For example, if I offered you a flip of a coin and I'll pay you $200 for every time you
3800.76s: call it right and you pay me $100 for every time you call it wrong.
3805.16s: Would you take that trade?
3807.16s: Abs of fucking looley.
3809.08s: Fair flip of a coin.
3810.60s: I flip the coin.
3812.28s: I do this by the way.
3813.40s: I do this exercise and we have a chart so people can
3818.92s: actually chart their emotional reactions to it.
3821.48s: And even me, even me, when I lose a flip of a coin, I feel that when I call it right,
3829.16s: I get a bum and I know it's totally irrational.
3836.28s: If I flipped it and you called it wrong, what would you feel?
3842.52s: I have to be honest.
3843.96s: If it was $100 on one flip, I genuinely wouldn't give a fuck.
3848.20s: Right.
3848.92s: So flip it again.
3849.72s: You got 200.
3851.00s: I owe you 200.
3852.36s: How are you feeling?
3854.52s: Don't care.
3855.48s: Don't care.
3856.20s: Right.
3856.92s: So that is a great mindset to trade from.
3865.96s: Most of the traders, I do these webinars and I'll do a coin flip and I have,
3871.00s: they all have charts and they're marking their emotional reactions.
3874.68s: And most of them really care.
3877.64s: Or when they get three or four in a row right or wrong,
3883.00s: they're emotions.
3884.92s: And this is just a coin flip.
3886.28s: They have no control over.
3887.72s: So now imagine that you made a trade.
3892.44s: You got hopes and dreams in it.
3895.64s: You've done everything right.
3897.56s: You've got an emotional attachment to the trade.
3901.72s: And it goes against you.
3904.76s: Oh my God.
3907.32s: It goes your way.
3909.40s: Yes.
3910.04s: Dreams come true.
3911.32s: So the work that I do in terms of those things you brought up
3914.84s: is to rewire the brain with lousy lucrative trading so that we are
3919.32s: profitable every time we trade because we have the two to one advantage or whatever it is.
3925.56s: We rewire the brain with coin flips.
3928.12s: I trade with them.
3929.48s: Interestingly enough,
3932.52s: traders, active traders who make off strategy or off the rails trades almost every day.
3941.96s: When I'm trading with them and I'm there and I'm just doing email and just watching them and
3945.72s: whatever, not once.
3947.72s: Yeah.
3948.52s: Not once do they go off the rails and why?
3952.12s: I'm constantly inviting them to their highest self, to that agency self.
3957.64s: And to make a lousy trade to slip down to it would be so embarrassing for them that they don't do it.
3963.64s: So what we're doing is start to make new neurological connections.
3966.92s: If I'm there, oh, I can do this.
3968.76s: Oh, I can do it more.
3969.88s: And then like my exercise in the morning, even if my upper level says,
3975.32s: I don't feel like it.
3976.84s: All of a sudden, I find myself on the floor doing my workout.
3980.76s: I love that.
3981.72s: And I think it applies something that really holds true, at least with the way that I approach
3988.60s: most things, which is kind of a building block modality, right? You're talking about
3992.28s: requiring synapses essentially.
3994.84s: And that's a process that takes place over time with incremental steps, which I really like
4001.96s: that that approach.
4003.08s: There's one of the things I try to help people when it comes to building habits.
4009.40s: It's so funny.
4010.20s: People will look at me and they'll be like, dude, you're like a robot.
4013.08s: I always get such a kick out of that because it's like, I literally consider myself the most
4018.28s: disciplined, undisciplined person on earth.
4021.32s: Because every single day, I have to fight with myself to do all these things.
4026.76s: Okay, Eric, I'm going to interrupt you.
4028.76s: Yeah, please.
4029.40s: What if you didn't have to fight with yourself?
4031.80s: And you imagine that world.
4034.52s: You have survived.
4035.96s: Good.
4037.08s: What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
4038.52s: What's it?
4039.00s: Yeah.
4039.80s: You've survived growing up in a difficult family.
4043.80s: You've survived the Marines.
4045.40s: You've survived it by fighting with yourself.
4048.12s: That's been a process that is part of your deepest survival mechanism.
4056.28s: Imagine for a moment, what if, what if Eric didn't have to fight himself?
4065.88s: What if there was another way to survive as an adult?
4074.76s: And that if we were continuing our coaching work, that's where we would go.
4083.36s: What a world of difference that would be.
4087.08s: It would be.
4090.84s: The reservation I would have against that ideology is I'm a believer that if we're pushing
4103.08s: boundaries, we're going into areas of discomfort and the nature of discomfort is it's always
4110.72s: going to be a certain level of discomfort until you adapt to that and then move to the
4116.20s: next layer of discomfort and adapt to that.
4118.84s: But whenever I meet that first layer of discomfort, that always lies in causes friction.
4126.28s: I'm not sure maybe you have a different opinion, but I'm not sure that a world exists where
4131.84s: somebody can achieve and continue to pursue kind of next step performance in whatever they're
4138.28s: trying to achieve without bumping into discomfort.
4141.52s: And then I guess the argument I pose is that that discomfort breeds misalignment.
4148.96s: Well, I can say that that has worked for you.
4161.12s: And I can also suggest there is another world outside of that where discomfort or like
4174.56s: when you're pushing your resistance muscles and you feel the burn, you can go yes, yes.
4185.24s: You can step into another layer of discomfort and go yes.
4189.96s: The language you use and maybe it's just a language problem and I'm misunderstanding
4194.24s: it that I'm fighting myself.
4196.60s: I have to fight.
4197.60s: I have to push.
4200.12s: And that may be a way of life for you and that is okay.
4206.32s: But I'm going to just plant a little seed that says, Eric, you've fought everything
4213.40s: all your life.
4215.72s: There's a way to step into challenges.
4218.04s: There's a way to step into trading.
4220.60s: There's a way to cooperate with your inner bitch in a way that's going to give you a life
4228.12s: with a lot less stress and a lot less push and a lot less inner conflict.
4235.00s: That was great.
4237.56s: Okay.
4238.56s: Well, that's where we go next.
4241.00s: I love it.
4242.40s: Richard.
4243.40s: It is always a blast chatting with you, honestly, especially thank you for taking
4247.52s: the time to like work me through that exercise and not a lie, you were absolutely right in
4253.24s: terms of like the vulnerability of doing that in something like this.
4256.96s: I don't even like being on camera, let alone talking from the perspective of this fucking
4262.84s: part of myself that I fight with all the time.
4266.00s: So it's very cool though that you're willing to take the time to share some of this with
4271.40s: people.
4272.40s: So first off, genuinely thank you not only for hanging out for the session, but also
4277.60s: like straight up working with me, right?
4279.20s: Like you genuinely just worked with me for a big part of that session.
4282.64s: So I'm very appreciative of that.
4284.16s: Thank you.
4285.16s: Oh, Eric, you are a pleasure to be with, to work with, to talk to your open, your integrity,
4292.60s: your desire for a better self and a better world around you.
4298.00s: Oh my gosh.
4299.44s: That motivation, that clarity really makes a difference.
4302.40s: So I appreciate you and thank you very much.
4305.40s: Oh, and Inter-Bitch.
4306.68s: Yeah.
4307.68s: Thank you for taking care of Eric when he was a kid and I look forward to seeing your new
4312.76s: job title in a couple of weeks.
4316.60s: So let me know how that goes, Inter-Bitch.
4320.00s: Inter-Bitch, thank you as well, I suppose, for my perspective.
4325.16s: Awesome, Richard.
4326.16s: Thank you so much.
4327.16s: What fun.
4328.16s: Thank you, Eric.
4329.16s: Have a rest of the day.
4330.16s: Thank you.
