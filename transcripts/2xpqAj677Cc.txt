0.00s: I'll hire options trading quick tips when you learn something in three minutes or less.
5.38s: Let's get in.
6.58s: One of the most common mistakes new options traders make is solving the wrong problems.
13.14s: What does that look like?
14.14s: Well, above my head here we have a three-month daily chart of Nvidia and it looks like
17.70s: it's going down.
19.42s: And very frequently an option trader will see something like this and they will go into
27.14s: the options chain and they'll start to say, well, how do I essentially play my idea?
33.06s: Should I use the options that expire in 16 May and 21 March and should I do more of
41.08s: the 21 March than the 16 May because they're cheaper?
45.26s: Meanwhile, they're not answering the most important question.
50.58s: The most important question here is what is the profit mechanism that I'm trying to trade?
58.74s: And then what structure and strategy fits this profit mechanism the best?
66.50s: What does that mean?
67.50s: Well, let's say for example, we think Nvidia might go down a little bit but it might not
73.66s: actually go down very much.
75.14s: Let's just say that we think it might hang around between 14 and 110 something like that,
82.34s: not really moving a whole lot.
83.98s: Well, here's the problem.
85.98s: If it does that, whether you buy the options that are near term, 21 March or the options
91.74s: that are further out in time, it doesn't matter.
94.78s: You're going to lose money in either scenario and it's because we're trying to answer
100.02s: the wrong problem.
101.18s: We're trying to say, what should these explorations make the most sense?
104.10s: And we really need to start answering the problem sooner further up to chain the map,
109.46s: which is what fits my idea the best because in this case, maybe it actually makes more sense
117.26s: to sell calls and show you can spread them off, trade a short call vertical spread.
123.58s: But if we're not actually expecting it to move that much, rather than buying premium
129.18s: when implied volatility is up at 88% if we don't really expect that big of a move,
135.82s: the only scenario that you're walking into with those long puts is which one's going to
139.74s: lose more money faster.
141.50s: So solve the right problems as a trader.
145.18s: It typically starts with clearly identifying the profit mechanism that you're trying to trade
150.54s: and then building the best possible position you can around that, not trying to solve
155.34s: for trivial details like should I do a 50 delta or a 51 delta, that comes later down the line,
160.86s: being outlier, see you later.
