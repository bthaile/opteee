0.66s: two big problems with the wheel options
3.66s: strategy it's actually a big part of
5.64s: what I do slight variation because I
7.62s: like to trade the coverage strangle and
9.54s: there's a specific reason for that it
11.58s: actually helps address some of these
13.68s: problems but I want to walk you through
15.66s: what these two problems are why you
17.40s: should care about them and then how we
19.02s: can overcome them because I actually
21.48s: think the wheel or the coverage strangle
23.58s: are two fantastic strategies for just
26.16s: about all Traders especially newer
28.44s: Traders but some of these get in the way
31.62s: and they give people a bad experience
33.24s: because they're not really thinking
34.68s: through the strategies in their entirety
36.30s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
38.34s: back to all the outliers let's start
39.78s: talking about the wheel okay the very
42.42s: first problem I am comfortable getting
46.02s: assigned at x x meaning a price on a
50.40s: specific stock I literally cannot tell
53.46s: you how often I have heard this
56.10s: sentiment we have something that's
58.38s: trading along just like this that you
61.56s: see here and they're making this
64.74s: statement when things look like this
67.32s: meaning they look good the underlying is
70.56s: going generally where we want it to
72.90s: there's good earnings supporting it
75.66s: everything seems good so for most people
78.96s: they come up with this just insane
81.06s: mental gymnastic where oh if it's
83.46s: trading at 180 up here I would love to
87.18s: have it at 160. it's a bargain the
90.54s: problem with that sentiment is this when
94.14s: it's trading down at 160 or whatever the
97.08s: case is there's typically a reason and
100.74s: that reason more often than not will
103.68s: make you uncomfortable with getting
106.38s: assigned at that point in time so this
108.36s: is looking at Apple
109.98s: one of the largest market cap stocks in
113.46s: existence literally a trillion dollars
115.38s: big company everybody thinks too big to
118.38s: fail and let's take a look if you had
121.32s: top ticked it meaning not even getting
123.30s: it at the very top but like it up here
125.88s: when it was trading very strong you
128.16s: would have bought in at around 179 180.
130.92s: as of the close of today which is the
132.84s: 20th December it is trading at 132. this
135.84s: is a 26 decline in the product now to be
139.74s: abundantly clear I actually still like
141.78s: apple I think long term it's probably
143.40s: okay but there's a huge problem with
145.44s: this let's say you were okay getting
148.32s: assigned at whatever your short strike
151.38s: was let's say if it was trading at 179
154.50s: you got in at 170 being very gracious
157.20s: with the pricing the problem is is your
160.62s: basis is now 170. it's trading down at
163.74s: 132. it's very difficult to maintain
167.40s: spot price sensitivity in this style
170.46s: trade and this is one of the reasons why
171.90s: I like the covered strangle so much
173.22s: because one of the primary differences
175.86s: between these two strategies is with the
178.62s: wheel you sell your cash secured puts
180.84s: until you're assigned and then you sell
182.16s: covered calls with the coverage strangle
184.26s: I do slightly different accounting where
187.08s: I don't use all of my money on the
188.88s: initial trade so I sell cash secured
191.46s: puts and then I'm assigned long stock
193.56s: once I'm assigned long stock I sell
195.96s: additional cash secured puts granted I
199.80s: still like the product while I'm selling
202.08s: uncovered calls against it so slight
204.78s: different way that I like to run those
206.28s: I'll throw a link to how I trade them in
208.14s: the video description down below but the
210.24s: point I'm making here is more often than
212.88s: not we're comfortable until we're
214.38s: uncomfortable most Traders fail to truly
217.50s: materialize in their mind what is the
220.02s: case that is going to lead them to being
222.12s: assigned because most of the time they
223.98s: think it's something like this where
225.66s: we're just getting this nice little dip
227.40s: oh I'll buy it at a discount on a small
230.76s: pullback and then we'll just run up and
233.16s: out and I'll have this great basis and
235.26s: life will be peachy that's the ideal
237.00s: scenario unfortunately the stock market
239.34s: has a very Nifty way of screwing us all
242.10s: over simultaneously somehow saying it is
244.86s: a joke but everybody feels like that
247.50s: um so
249.06s: if you think you're comfortable getting
251.58s: assigned at X that's fine the way that I
254.82s: would really quantify that is saying
257.52s: okay if it's trading at 179 we sell our
260.76s: 170 cash secured putt now it's trading
263.58s: at 170 and you're like okay it's trading
265.74s: right around my strike I don't mind and
267.48s: then it goes to 168 then 165 160 155 150
272.10s: all the way down to 132. the way that I
275.58s: make sure that I am comfortable with
277.62s: getting assigned is I don't just leave
280.56s: the my management plan as get assigned
283.20s: cell covered calls I make sure that
285.78s: there is some sort of protocol to manage
288.78s: the basis so for me I trade the coverage
291.30s: strangles but if you chose not to and
293.22s: you just wanted to trade the wheel maybe
295.44s: you set up a floor that you'll take the
298.80s: trade to because again we have to
300.72s: acknowledge the fact that if we're
301.98s: selling puts below the basis we get a
303.90s: sign on those puts something changed
305.52s: ideally it's not a big hopefully it's
307.74s: not a big deal but it might be so we
311.04s: need to have some sort of floor in place
313.08s: so again rounding out this example we
315.00s: sold those 170 puts let's say we give it
318.00s: uh a five to ten percent movement range
321.48s: against our entry and then if it falls
324.54s: through that that's where we have a sell
326.64s: stop order to get the out move on
328.62s: and now we can be comfortable because
331.80s: we're not just going to be bad holding
333.66s: this stock now if it's something that
335.82s: you like long term completely different
337.62s: scenario maybe your dollar cost
339.42s: averaging in totally cool no qualms with
342.00s: that the main thing I'm highlighting
343.80s: here is people say they're comfortable
345.60s: until starts to hit the fan and
348.30s: then all of a sudden they're not
349.14s: comfortable and the plane goes out the
350.46s: window you got to think it all the way
351.90s: through let's move on to the next one
353.46s: here which is
356.16s: premium hunting I have two examples here
359.22s: and this is I know I did this myself
361.68s: early on I wanted to sell cash secured
363.90s: puts where I could make the most money
365.16s: the highest return on invested Capital
367.10s: but I didn't totally understand what
370.02s: that meant and I want to make sure that
372.06s: you understand what that means if you do
374.22s: before I say it throw it in the comments
376.26s: below quick little quiz see if you
378.60s: understand why it's not as simple as I
382.14s: want to get paid the most the highest
384.06s: return on invested capital
385.56s: the reason why it's not is let's look at
388.14s: two examples I have PG on this side
390.30s: Tesla on this side PG on a 31 days to
394.50s: expiration 30 Delta put the return on
397.32s: invested capital is 1.3 so all I do pop
400.74s: up PG here go over here 31 days to
403.98s: expiration we come over here to this 30
405.72s: put it's I'm just using the mid price
408.42s: which is 1.90 so on a one lot 100 shares
411.36s: you'll collect 190 and you'll put up 14
414.00s: 600 that is how you are getting this
417.00s: return on invested Capital that's
418.32s: actually really good and I want to make
419.82s: a quick note on that because we're in a
421.74s: bear market and volatility is abundant
424.32s: this is actually still a really good
426.00s: trade during the during the bull market
428.16s: that we went through when I was trading
429.90s: things like the coverage strangle I was
431.40s: hunting for one percent return on the
433.92s: money so this is actually still really
436.26s: good it's going to skew a lot of
437.70s: people's perceptions that trade these
439.32s: that are just starting now but it's
441.66s: worth noting so anyways
444.42s: 1.3 return on invested Capital the high
447.90s: low variance for the past one year is 26
451.10s: so if I come in here and we look at the
453.60s: high and we look at the low the variance
456.00s: between the widest part of this one year
457.92s: daily range is again that percentage
461.28s: which is 26 and if we take a look at
465.06s: what the daily weekly moves are the
467.34s: daily move one standard deviation moves
469.26s: about two dollars weekly is about 4.60
471.66s: monthly about nine dollars fifty cents
474.24s: okay got it so this is again I want to
477.00s: make this really clear because this is
478.26s: going to screw a lot of people up when
479.70s: we're not in a bear market and
481.56s: volatility is gone and you can't even
483.90s: get this you're hopeful to get 0.8
486.90s: percent return on invested Capital so
489.00s: take advantage of this while you got it
490.38s: but then let's look at something like
491.82s: Tesla so Tesla right now is actually
494.52s: offering five and a half percent return
497.40s: on invested Capital so again using the
499.86s: same example if we go 31 days out I
501.96s: think this one yeah right here 30 Delta
503.76s: this is is the mid price is 6.95 so it's
506.52s: the same exact story we're just going to
507.90s: take the premium received divided by the
510.66s: amount to cash secure the position and
512.64s: you're going to get five and a half
513.48s: percent return on invested capital A lot
515.16s: of money for what you're putting up
516.60s: you're like four times what you're
518.94s: getting over here which is fantastic
520.70s: however look at the one year high low
523.68s: variance it's 66 it's like three times
526.26s: what you're seeing over here so why is
528.78s: this the case why does this matter why
530.64s: does premium hunting lead people astray
532.92s: because it kind of combines these two
535.74s: factors in one setting so what I mean by
539.04s: that is
540.48s: we are selling something and we would
543.90s: like to collect the premium obviously
545.52s: and we're starting that with the
547.50s: Assumption of I'm comfortable but then
550.26s: when we start premium hunting we're
552.42s: looking for the highest return on
554.10s: invested Capital that we can find what
556.38s: you're going to experience is more
558.60s: return variance that is why you are
562.02s: getting more return on your money for
565.32s: that ticker because the raw implied
568.08s: volatility of these products is
570.24s: different if we look at Tesla the raw
573.12s: implied volatility here is 81.64 and
576.54s: then if we look at PG the raw implied
578.52s: volatility is 22 percent
580.86s: so these are very different worlds and
584.10s: that is why you're going to get more
585.60s: money when you have higher implied
588.54s: volatility but the trade-off with higher
591.36s: implied volatilities you're going to be
592.74s: dealing with the trades a lot more
594.00s: meaning taking assignment having to roll
596.04s: trades which may not be the end of the
597.66s: world but a lot of people get into this
599.76s: just purely looking for the most the
602.04s: highest return on their Capital which I
603.72s: understand but there's a trade-off to
605.46s: that higher implied volatility means
607.38s: higher variance movement in the
608.64s: underlying itself you got to be ready to
610.62s: deal with it and again while you're
612.78s: going through that variance that what
614.76s: you were comfortable with to start you
617.40s: might not be comfortable with as the
619.56s: underlying is now down 60 percent over a
622.92s: year so thinking through that ahead of
625.26s: time is absolutely pivotal to making
627.54s: sure that you can actually follow your
629.46s: plan these are two of the biggest
630.84s: problems with the wheel people don't
632.28s: think through these things enough at a
634.20s: time they get stuck trying to figure it
636.00s: out on the Fly and they struggle abandon
638.46s: the plan and then we just have a bunch
640.26s: of losing trades so don't do that be an
643.26s: outlier don't forget to like And
644.70s: subscribe see y'all later
