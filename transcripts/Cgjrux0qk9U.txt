0.00s: 2023 marked my 16th full year of trading.
4.24s: So I want to walk you through six things I've learned over my 16 year trading career thus far at least
13.12s: provided that I don't love up soon, which hopefully not at this point.
20.00s: But what I want to share with you are a handful of lessons learned.
23.84s: Now some of these will be things that I learned early on.
26.16s: Some of these things will be what I learned a little bit later.
28.80s: But I want to specifically focus on some more off the wall ideas, meaning I'm not going to talk
34.96s: to you about the very basics of what it takes to be successful in trading like managing risk.
40.40s: Those are given. So I want to share with you some more of the nuanced concepts that I've learned
46.96s: over my career trading. What's up everybody? AirCure. Welcome back to the outlier, shout out to the
50.88s: Patreon family. Consider signing up. Let's get straight into what we got going on. So what's the
55.60s: first thing? The markets remind me of nature. And what I mean by that is nature doesn't really
62.00s: root for people. It doesn't really root against people. Nature is indifferent. If you watch any
68.56s: nature documentary, I watch them a lot because I'm fascinated by it. The animal kingdom is brutal.
74.00s: We think it's brutal. However, it's really not. It's not mean. It's harsh, but it's indifferent.
80.64s: That directly applies to the markets. The markets are indifferent to you, to me, as individual
89.04s: retail market participants. The market does not care about you. So what that means is the markets
95.20s: are not actively trying to hurt us. They're not actively trying to help us. They are indifferent
101.12s: to our existence. So that means the markets don't care what's convenient for you. They don't care
107.36s: what you want to happen. They don't care what you want to trade. They don't care that you think
112.00s: if the pattern day trading rule didn't exist, that you would be a massively profitable trader.
117.04s: What you probably wouldn't be. That sounds right. The whole idea here is once you understand
123.84s: the world that we're operating in, the better off you're going to be. And what I mean by that is
129.60s: very first off the jump is that if you have a small account like most of us do when we started out,
134.00s: I started with less than $5,000, you are disadvantaged right out of the game. That's not because the
138.40s: market likes you or doesn't like you. It is simply a fact of the place you were trying to interface with.
144.00s: This is similar. If you wanted to play professional basketball, if you are short, you are disadvantaged.
150.08s: Does that mean that you can't be mugsie bows and somehow figure it out? No, you can. It's entirely
155.52s: possible, but you are disadvantaged and you have to figure out another way to succeed. So when you're
160.72s: looking at small accounts, some of the disadvantages we have are the inability to achieve good
165.84s: diversification. You can't put on that many positions. You're limited in what products you can
170.08s: trade because some of them are too expensive. You're limited in what options structures you can use
175.52s: because if you sell a call, maybe the larger requirement is too high. There are limitations that
179.68s: you have that you have to learn to work around as best as you can. Now that should not be confused
187.36s: with adapting to a circumstance so that you can overcome it versus what is best. For example,
193.84s: many small accounts start with vertical spreads. I hate vertical spreads. I talk bad about them all
199.76s: the time because in general, I do not think they're a great option structure. If you were a small
204.56s: account, you ain't got that many choices. Maybe you adopt using vertical spreads to get your feet
210.48s: under you. You're not trading them $1 wide so that you can at least attempt to make some money.
215.68s: Just because vertical spreads are what you can trade does not mean that they're what makes sense.
221.12s: That's why when I did the small stack segment not too long ago, well maybe two years ago,
225.68s: so it isn't a minute ago, I used things like ratio called diagonals. They were a better alternative
231.20s: to me given the constraints of a $5,000 account than trading something like vertical spreads.
235.60s: The same thing when I trade my favorite strategy, the coverage strangle, I love that strategy.
239.60s: In a small account, it is next to impossible to deploy that without using your entire account.
244.72s: These are the concessions that we make. This is also why you absolutely need to save. There's
250.08s: no substitute for saving early on in your trading career. Smart ideas mean nothing. This is our second
255.84s: lesson learned. I have come across, I cannot tell you how many truly brilliant people in this space.
261.60s: I've talked to people that have PhDs. I've talked to people that literally have sold hundreds
267.68s: of millions of dollars of businesses that they've built. What I've learned is that I'm pretty
272.88s: fucking stupid. Are you stupid or something? But that part aside, I've learned something more
278.24s: interesting. Trading is a balance between theoretical understanding of something and practical
284.48s: application. So what that means is you can have somebody that's incredibly smart, that's able to
290.40s: piece everything together to build this beautiful narrative on why everything's happening in these
295.68s: nice succinct summaries. They might know everything that's going on. It might not matter. The world
301.84s: of trading is the world of practical application. It's where we take a reasonable theoretical understanding
308.56s: of things. We see how it actually works in the real world and then we find a way to interface with
315.28s: that. One of the things I find is that people who are really smart that want to have an explanation
320.24s: for everything. A lot of times they struggle in trading because things are not quite that discrete.
325.84s: And even though you might think you are 100% correct and this thing shouldn't have done whatever it
331.52s: did. It doesn't matter literally at all. What matters is what price does. That's what matters.
339.20s: Some people really struggle to accept that fact. That leads into our next point of the process.
345.68s: There was a study done that I don't remember the origin of. I saw this back when I was in my
351.28s: undergraduate. So I don't remember what it was. Take this with a grain of salt. But what I remember
357.20s: reading was that some of the more prestigious style jobs, doctors, lawyers, stuff like that,
363.36s: people like that tend to trade poorly. And I remember reading about the reasons why. And it
370.88s: came down to this idea of ego. And it came down to this idea of their ability to cleanly summarize
377.60s: things. And then they have the utmost conviction in their summary that then might not be validated
384.08s: by the market. Removal of ego is a non-negotiable in trading. There's a big difference between
388.96s: prediction versus a forecast. Prediction of something is when you have a high degree of certainty.
394.88s: Forecast is where you have kind of an idea of what might happen, but you're not really ultra
400.40s: convicted about it. Now in trading, like most things in life, it requires a balance between these two.
406.16s: Because if you attempt to trade off of something that you have no real basis behind it,
411.84s: then you're not going to probably want to commit a bunch of capital to it. However, if you are
416.64s: so wrapped up in your thesis that you fail to acknowledge that it might not work out, or when it
423.28s: doesn't work out that it has this really significant emotional impact on your ability to process
428.72s: things, all of that is a giant attractor from profitable trading. So what I think about here,
434.88s: when I talk about even directional forecasts that I have, I view them as probabilistic outcomes.
441.92s: I might think something is a 60% chance of happening, but I acknowledge that 40% chance of it not
447.36s: happening is pretty damn high and it might not happen. If it doesn't happen, that's okay.
452.16s: Any one trade that doesn't go in your favor, it's not going to kill you when you become a trader is
458.16s: when you stop over emphasizing each individual position you have on and you favor the process
466.16s: and the systematic application there of over time. That is what leads to profits. Overall,
474.00s: we care about what the truth is regardless of what we think it should or should not be,
480.72s: which leads to this exact idea of having an iterative process. So the reason I say iterative
487.52s: is because when I first started making my trading plan way back in 2008, 2009, I really had a
495.52s: rudimentary group of things in there that probably would make me laugh today, but it's where I started
502.00s: and that's okay. So when we look at our application as traders, it's something that we have to build
509.20s: over time. Now, last year's a prime example in 2023, I had a series of various risk premium plays
516.32s: that I typically use. Some of the structures that I typically used, I noticed in the near term data
521.84s: started behaving differently than I thought it should have compared to the longer term run rate.
526.64s: So then I started doing more testing given the current market conditions and it caused me to make
530.96s: a switch that I'm very thankful that I made because I still continue to run a paper version of the
536.88s: old iteration of the strategies compared to a live version of the updated version of the strategies
543.68s: and they performed much better. You have to acknowledge that there's some degree of overfitting
548.88s: that may or may not happen here, but if we maintain a good assessment and have varied outcomes
555.44s: moving forward, you can minimize overfitting to a pretty significant degree. And for those that are
560.88s: unfamiliar with this overfitting concept is, it's essentially if you backtest something and you cherry
566.16s: pick the absolute best structure for that given point in time and then in going forward, you're not
572.24s: accounting for variance off of that previous movement. It's essentially trying to drive forward
578.48s: looking in the rear view mirror. We don't want to do that, but you do have to adjust to meet market
583.60s: conditions because they change noise. I have a really interesting perspective on this in that I
590.32s: genuinely do not listen to anybody else. I do not pay attention to what people say is going to
596.08s: happen in the markets on Twitter. I do not care quite literally whatsoever. There is a difference
602.80s: between gathering information, which I do all the time. I'm looking at news articles. I am seeing
608.40s: what the economists think might happen six months from now. However, none of that is entering my
614.96s: brain as, oh, I have to follow what this person says because I believe them. What you're doing in
623.28s: that case is over emphasizing somebody else's capacity to predict what the markets are going to do
631.36s: over your own ability to apply the skill set of trading. You have to learn to be autonomous,
637.92s: operate on your own. That's exactly why I have my entire community, the outlier community, built as I
644.00s: do. I do not want anybody to see me as an oracle because I'm not. I'm just a fucking internet dude.
651.52s: But what I want people to do is to build this skill sets to then move themselves forward
658.88s: and evolve as traders and provide some structure to help them do that. But noise gets you nowhere in
664.72s: the markets and there's plenty of it. Everybody wants to feel smart. They want to throw their ego
670.16s: out there because they want that validation. This is the same thing when you see all of these
674.16s: different pundits that have the most beautiful discrete synopsis of everything that's ever happened in
679.44s: the markets as compared to what most of us actually know is going on, which is we don't have any
683.92s: fucking idea. Shit happens in the markets. Not every move is going to be discreetly
690.48s: described by whatever you think happened. Maybe whatever you think happened is part of it.
695.68s: There's a bunch of other shit that probably has a seat at that table in terms of what led to that
700.72s: outcome. Important to be aware of that. Last thing number six. This is hands down the most important
708.16s: thing that I've done to completely revolutionize my performance as a trader is adding structure
715.92s: and organization to my process. Early on I did not have a trading plan. Early on I did not have a
722.16s: trading log without both of those documents. You are essentially trying to fly a plane that you
728.56s: can't see out the window maybe because you're in a cloud with no gauges. You have no idea what's
734.72s: going on. You have nothing to reference. You have nothing to create assumptions that you can
740.16s: then tighten over time. This is where all of the work of trading is done. Right here creating the
747.04s: structure, creating tracking. This is hands down the most difficult aspect and as you might
753.44s: imagine this is where all of the benefit is derived from doing this because you also learn
760.72s: to kill your ego. You say, okay, I want to trade this covered strangle. I think 21 days works best
765.68s: in this kind of environment but I'll test 30, 40 and 12. Okay, you see what happens. You're not
772.08s: throwing your ego out there and saying, I think this is the best because of X, Y and Z reason.
776.88s: You are literally applying the scientific method to test what you think works best and then you now
781.76s: have information you can base the decision off of. Without this you are non-negotiably flying blind
788.00s: and I have a bunch of videos that walk through this concept in depth. I'll throw them in the notes
793.68s: below for you but please if nothing else do not sleep on this concept. If you do not have a trading
800.72s: plan I can damn near guarantee you that within three to five years you are going to wish you did.
808.08s: If you're still trading at that point in time because most people aren't anymore because they've
812.56s: lost their money. Don't do that. Don't be like most people. Be an outlier. See you all later.
