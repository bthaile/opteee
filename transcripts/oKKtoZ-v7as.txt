0.00s: Hey everybody, so I am super stoked. I have Tom Baso here. I actually listen to how to pronounce your name. I hope I didn't kill it from.
12.00s: Oh, you did it perfectly. It's Italian Baso. Yeah, there we go. Good. So first off, you know, welcome to the channel. We had a chance just to talk for a few minutes, you know, get generally acquainted.
22.00s: I'm really looking forward to your perspective here. So when you see me looking down, it's because I have my handy dandy notebook, because I'm Polish and I can't remember things from questions.
34.00s: I'm 69 and I can't remember things.
38.00s: But realistically, I think one of the really fun parts of my YouTube channel is just connecting with people like you with a very different background, something that I know very, very little about. And I'm really excited to dive into that. So first off, thank you so much for coming on and chatting for a while.
59.00s: It's certainly my pleasure and thank you for your service. I can see the marine thing on the back wall there.
65.00s: That's right. Yeah, a lot of people are like, what is all that crap on your walks? I got like knives, ale horns. I got a Tomahawk all sorts of little dude dads hung up my wife loves it. Let me tell you.
75.00s: You probably know how to use them.
79.00s: So I figure, you know, always helpful to start with a bit of background. And what led me to you is I was looking through just Twitter and your name popped up.
91.00s: And I was looking through a page a little bit and I was like, oh, okay, this is like just a couple of things lined up that really peak my interest.
99.00s: And basically the money manager background that you have is always of interest just because it's such a different world than retail trading.
109.00s: Maybe not, you know, completely disparate, but I'm sure you could share a little more about that in a little bit. But then the other thing was, you know, the part about like futures and currency trading still, you know, we were talking a little bit about hogs and lumber.
125.00s: And I was like, to me, that's actually really interesting that you have that money manager background, obviously still very active as a trader. So first off, I would love to just get a, you know, quick synopsis of how you got started in the markets.
143.00s: And what did that look like for you?
146.00s: It was a chemical engineer out of Clarkson University up in northern New York. This is back in 1974 at the end of a 50% down market on the S&P.
156.00s: So I'm making 12,000 a year and in those days 12,000 a year was a lot of money.
163.00s: And so I start sucking money into a stock account and a bunch of us engineers would sit around at lunch and talk about investments and what newsletters we were reading and what their brokers told us and sharing ideas and eventually led to an investment club of some sort.
182.00s: And another guy and myself started practically managing it.
186.00s: De facto because nobody else in the club really could had any energy to do anything. So little by little, we took over that and had had a raise a bunch of money and then we hooked up on the third guy and that ended up forming a firm, investment advisory firm, which we ran part time for about three years or so while we were still working is during the day as chemical engineers.
211.00s: And one thing led to another pretty soon we have enough money under management we can afford my salary outside of the chemical company. So I leave and I open up an office and the whole thing goes crazy and I eventually sold my shares and that ended up forming trends that which was my firm for.
227.00s: I think around 28 years or so and we expanded into all sorts of areas, currencies futures mutual fun timing we did a little stocks in the early going even traded some treasury bonds along the way when we had to do use the treasury bonds for collateral against the futures transactions.
246.00s: The laws have evolved over the years and things that can happen today.
252.00s: I mean literally didn't exist back then. Right.
255.00s: You would have really been inventing the wheel. You would have just been all by yourself and probably never raise a dollar.
263.00s: So I tried to stay with what I knew could be interesting to clients, but then you mentioned in your questions.
273.00s: So I've gone from just an amateur now all of a sudden is trading my own money that was successful now I'm managing other people's money and now we got my own firm and it grows to 600 million and I'm trading money for you know Merrill Lynch and Chase and all sorts of big banks and the world is just completely going crazy new market was it's come out I'm now Mr. Serenity.
299.00s: Everybody knows who I am I'm getting a lot of people stopping by to say hi and down in Scottsdale where our office was and you know the world kind of went nuts for about at least three or four years and then and then it just kind of fizzled the currency business when the year old came into being gosh about 15 different pairs that I traded disappeared so diversification went down.
322.00s: And a lot of big institutions get really cold feet quickly.
327.00s: It's like they didn't know what to expect they it's like the sort of they didn't mind having currencies and it wasn't like there was a lot of losses.
336.00s: But they just saw the potential for profit to get narrowed in the potential for diversification definitely to go down which does put you in a more vulnerable position I agree with a mayor I don't agree with them that there isn't still some nice potential in the effects markets and I certainly made some good money still but.
357.00s: You know the institutions are the institutions they do what they do and they have bureaucracies and committees and when that got you know the friends that then assets under management went down I got to a point where it was probably 60% of my time was spent with people coming in and auditing our firm the IRS the SEC the state of Arizona the investment advisory business so the national futures association would come in.
384.00s: And our firm was so complex that because we traded so many different things that a good example I was on the board of the national futures association.
394.00s: I am representing one of the three slots that were commodity trading advisors and I did that all the way up until I retired and then I resigned from the board since I no longer was a CTA I retired on my resignations and happily put a smile on my face and the smiles been the herbicides I think.
413.00s: What ended up happening is they send in somebody to audit us or to review our stuff and these people generally are six months or less out of school and I've got foreign exchange going on I've got futures going on I've got mutual fun time and going on I've got hundreds of clients everything's automated unbelievably.
437.00s: It takes us maybe in the afternoon it took us 15 20 minutes to run hundreds of accounts across dozens of trading desks across I don't even know how many positions probably hundreds of positions and would transmit them all all in 20 minutes and so these people would come in and I felt like I was okay I'm kind of obligated I'm on the board of the NFA I got to be polite to these people I got to try to help it's part of the organization I'm on the board of the NFA.
467.00s: I felt like I'd spent days and days teaching these kids what they're really should be asking me and then giving them how to answer yes exactly and it just seemed awfully big waste of time and about 60% of my time towards the end was done in in what I call non productive to the client the clients paying me money to manage their money.
495.00s: But only 40% of my time is able to be managing their money or inventing new and better trading strategies or working on the position sizing algorithm some more or trying to find new markets we can trade or all the things you do that try to help improve value added to the client I couldn't do it I was tied up and reading legal documents and running over accounting programs and just seemed like
522.00s: and that's not what I really thought was fun and life I want to do I got in the money management business because I really liked managing money so I decided finally I don't really need the money why am I doing this so we found our employees a number of opportunities out there and they scattered to the four winds some of them actually went into retirement with me others found other positions some of them fairly unbelievably substantial compared to where they were.
552.00s: But at my place so good for them and you know life goes on and I've enjoyed retirement now for some 18 years right I've only worked 28 so 10 more years and retirement becomes my number one job in my life and a good job yeah so that's kind of the evolution all the way from starting out as a clinical engineer to retirement sort of but
580.80s: hopefully that answered your couple questions there it does but as with any good answer to a question I have more so the first one you were talking about this is really just geographic question for for my own understanding so you said that you were an upstate New York was that just for college or were you were a chemical engineer did you move to Arizona.
606.04s: St. Louis St. Louis. Okay got it very early stages of Monsanto the famous company that invented all the herbicides and everything. Okay got it I was I was making industrial chemicals had nothing to do with all that egg stuff but there was a different division but yeah I was a chemical engineer designing actual you know
625.92s: ortho-northoclayer benzene was my first project all about that a seed of metafine they did some of the no flavoring I did a project for that we we did some
638.96s: a plant for Brazil some Paulo Brazil so it was fun for a while and then after about five years I realized you know it's kind of the same thing over and over again.
649.52s: I designed one pump you've kind of designed them all you know they don't get out they don't end up being all the much different so I had very high ratings that was promoted as fast as I could be I eventually moved to the business side of the company I ended up getting an MBA thought that would be my career path more in the business side of the chemical industry and not
671.92s: and then along came this money management thing and I'm okay I'm making this over here and I'm making I could make that over there it's the same number right and I this is really intriguing I could have my own business and that would be fun so I got it and off went into the money management business and never look back.
691.36s: So what can you just walk me through were you from originally Syracuse New York on the West side little village called Salve it's like 10,000 Italians everybody's
701.16s: got an I.O.P. or A at the end of their name okay got except I went to RIT so yeah sure yeah so I'm generally familiar with upstate New York area that's why I was curious about that I would have considered them but they didn't have chemical engineering at the time yeah well now they got all from a Jenny engineer you think of
719.88s: they have I had a good friend that did like packaging science yeah which that's actually a pretty fascinating gig but anyways so then you went to this job in
731.16s: a scene I'm saying Lewis I stayed there for about I was probably an engineer or in the business side for maybe eight years nine years and then and by then I was full time money management okay so the money management started in St. Louis and then what moved you to Arizona did well that was a strange thing financial plan or seemed to like working with me because I was so I don't know I hopefully pleasant to be around with the clients I knew my
761.00s: stuff I was highly technically capable right a lot of the financial planners lean towards the the salesman side you know they they have to represent a lot of different types of strategies and products to their clients so that they have to be outgoing personalities and go out and find the clients and you know I have lunch with them and do all the things that that more of the sales type of the industry does and when everybody had a challenge you know like they had a big
790.72s: pension plan and they're wondering what are they supposed to do with it you know are there they're going into retirement now they've got the huge rollover what do I do with it a lot of times I'd be brought in just to talk through the issues and I knew so much about so many things in the industry that I could help narrow things down to crystallize their thinking and many times we ended up with some of the money to manage so it was sort of marketing on my side too
818.20s: And it turned out that when I looked at the number of clients I had in St. Louis and the number of clients I had in Phoenix and we did business in all sorts of places California Florida Texas we had a number of clients strewn all over around the world really in currency trading and so
835.04s: What it would end up happening is I had the most concentration of of clients in the Phoenix metropolitan area.
843.04s: The word had spread mouth to mouth and clients had talked to other clients and we'd end up with a strange phone call out of the blue and when are you coming down to Phoenix next I'd like to meet with you and stuff so
854.68s: It just kept going and I love golf and I got really tired in St. Louis putting my clubs up at about October and pulling them back out in April to play in the mud.
864.24s: Right and here I play you around and it's gorgeous.
868.44s: This is all heaven so for me as a golfer this is like the place to live and then I thought to myself while this is probably where I'd end up retiring anyway.
878.92s: So I might as well move the company while I have the energy and the money and everything else to do it.
886.40s: It cost me a quarter of a million dollars to move the company here overnight that we had airborne express we had 40 computers to move we had rock collections we had a boat that we moved.
898.40s: In that mine my head trader we had China collections we had all sorts of weird everybody's cars and their spouses we booked an entire auto carrier straight through husband and wife team.
914.28s: And everybody showed up at work with their cars we loaded a man and off we off it goes to Phoenix so it was a fun overnight experience but by 4th of July weekend.
925.60s: Friday afternoon we shut it down everybody got in the plane at Lambert Field in St. Louis we arrived in Phoenix that night at about 6 7 o'clock had dinner showed up next day at Saturday of 4th of July weekend and in the weekend that 4th of July happened that fall on a Tuesday so Monday was a dead day too we had a 4 days to play with.
948.96s: But by 3rd by 2st day afternoon even Monday we needed to be up and running right preferably Sunday because the currency markets were going to be open in some places of the world on Monday.
962.08s: Guess what Britain doesn't celebrate the 4th of July think about it.
968.24s: So there's places that are open so we had to be operational and we are operational by completely by Sunday morning.
977.32s: That's impressive so for I'm in the Marine Crosse logistics officer so listen to you talk about the logistics there.
985.32s: Then you know what I'm talking about it's just speaking to me yeah because we've got we've got airborne express with a box with packing material sitting in front of every computer we're running the last run of the day on grantees.
999.28s: And as soon as it's everybody's that's left in the company every half the company's already down in Phoenix.
1005.60s: Get ready and the other half is finishing up St. Louis.
1009.36s: As soon as that last one hit it successfully and we called New York and they said yeah we got it that computer went down they picked it up stuck it in the box they got the box is sitting on a dolly.
1023.28s: And they're out the door hitting the afternoon run from airborne express they deliver it in Scottsdale to our new office sometime back 10 30 in the next morning.
1034.16s: That's so cool.
1035.36s: On the table.
1036.48s: That's a really good planning.
1039.36s: Now we that was highly highly highly designed it took us probably the better part of.
1047.44s: Six to nine months from start to finish it might have been almost a year but from the time we told you employees and actually started planning some of the really really deep.
1056.68s: TL stuff it was it was a real heavy six months of planning and getting every detail figured out every computer where it was going to go to replace it.
1065.44s: We had a whole new network we had a whole new computers down at Scottsdale but we brought some of the old equipment as well as backups and.
1073.24s: We had a new design to the office so they were at places where we could run.
1078.56s: Back in those days you don't have so much this but back in those days the computers were so slow.
1083.84s: We'd start a you know some kind of a big study and we'd started on like Monday afternoon and it would run till Thursday morning or Friday morning or something.
1093.72s: So you'd have to have these computers sitting on shelves kind of away from everybody so that nobody would touch it.
1099.60s: And right literally take the keyboard and shut it off.
1106.56s: So that nobody could go up and accidentally.
1109.68s: Yeah hit a keyboard in it you know interrupt the flow of this massive study we're doing so that we designed our operations so there was computer labs of multiple layers of micros computers that.
1124.72s: Could run individual studies and be independent from the other ones and so some of our research people could tie into any one of those machines by hitting a couple switches.
1134.04s: That's pretty crazy now because I mean obviously now we have Python or Adam and you know it's a couple minutes if that world is different.
1143.44s: Yeah see sharp.
1146.44s: So what one of the one of the things that I was really really curious about is when you first got into trading.
1154.60s: What like while you were still a chemical engineer.
1158.20s: What what trading were you doing like what kind of trading did you actually start with.
1163.36s: Stocks.
1164.36s: Okay.
1165.36s: And it was low price stocks was my favorite I tended to like to buy stuff that was less than $10 a share.
1172.24s: I felt like the percent return on investment was the highest.
1176.20s: It was trying to find small companies that would be the next Microsoft or you know I am or whatever.
1182.84s: And I had screens that I would try to do back in those days a lot of it was done by paper there were no computers I had a.
1190.24s: Add subtract multiply divide calculator.
1193.56s: 1980 is when you really had the IBM first IBM PC come out and I bought one and that was revolutionary very expensive to.
1203.92s: For for me at that age.
1206.64s: But it was well worth it at leverage my time I never looked back I bought the first IBM AT and kept expanding and.
1214.64s: Just ended up with 40 computers at the peak and 10 people to run them got it.
1220.60s: So you started with stocks and then what what happened what.
1226.16s: Here's here's the mental process and.
1230.80s: It's a very interesting one to me because I have evolved over what 50 years or so now.
1238.28s: And it goes like this if you start out in stocks and you're just buying long.
1243.64s: In the back of your mind you're thinking you know especially me because I came out in 73 74 I just saw when I was junior senior or college I'm tracking stocks to see what companies that I consider and going to look like financially because I'd like to go to a company that was doing real well.
1261.44s: So I thought I you know I got to plot all these chemical companies so I had down to Pant and months and I'm shell oil and all sorts of backs on.
1270.64s: And you start realizing when you think about it that hey you know if the stock market were to go down 50 cents on a dollar again 50% or worse or you know say it's a depression 1929 whatever.
1287.64s: I'm going to really lose a lot of money value of my account wouldn't it be nice to have something that could make money during that period.
1298.64s: To at least diversify myself and offset some of it.
1302.64s: And that got me thinking about futures because commodities because back in those days you could trade say a corn contract it didn't cost you that much.
1313.64s: And I thought to myself well corn probably doesn't really care what the stock market's doing today right and stock market runs and really care what corn is doing today.
1324.64s: So there's two things that could do their own thing. And then I started thinking about well how about cattle how about gold how about bonds and little by little I kept adding and I just it was this sort of approach that in my mind is trying to get to sort of an all weather.
1347.64s: And I think that's a kind of a type of strategy where you know throw some hell at me a tornado or hurricane sunny day I don't really care.
1356.64s: Every day here at my office is the same as the day before no matter what happens in the world.
1363.64s: I've got eight different strategies running across futures and ETFs and securities probably at any one time somewhere between 40 to 60 positions that cover the gamut and got sorts of things could happen and you look at my my portfolio on a day like today and out of say around 50 to 56 positions probably I'm running probably 60 to 65% of them went.
1392.64s: My way today the other 35 one against me the ones that want against me didn't go against me that much the ones that went my favor went big right.
1401.64s: I had a really good day but that's just a typical day what goes on here I don't win on everything every day that I trade I don't even try right.
1412.64s: I'm trying to get lots of different exposure so that no matter what the world and the markets throw at me I'm just sort of cruising along right another another day.
1423.64s: So for for context when I started trading I started with some stock but then I got into derivatives mostly options though.
1434.64s: And I've been trading futures for a while now but I find it really interesting that you even stumbled into them because what like what year was it when you started like working with with futures probably 1976 which I actually I'm not familiar do you know when futures were like launched like on actual exchanges I know they've been around forever.
1458.64s: But yeah there's different I mean now there's I don't know 75 to 100 futures readily get to around the world electronically especially back in those days you know there was maybe 20 25 markets got it that were deep enough and everything was traded by hands so basically I would call a commodity broker commodity broker would write a ticket up by hand.
1486.64s: Take it over to his teletype operator they would type it in it would go to the floor the floor would either signal it into the pit or they give it to a runner the runner would run it out there hand piece of paper to the guy in the pit guy in the pit would do his hand signals and buy or sell.
1503.64s: He'd write up who he bought or sold it to toss the ticket on the floor the runner would pick it up take it back to the teletype operator teletype operator back to the broker's office teletype then sends the little message over to the broker's desk he then calls me for my fill.
1521.64s: Wow days that's so straightforward yeah nowadays I sit here and I go huh I think I got one too many contracts of corn there I need to peel off one.
1532.64s: So I get my cursor and I go corn, sell one market, submit and it's beeping over here on the right side already done and then I watch my position size go down by one over my corner and I'm done it takes less than 10 seconds to do everything.
1552.64s: So how did I'm really curious so like I was saying when I started with options there was definitely you know material available right we've like we have books one of my favorite is options is a strategic investment but I mean I started trading options mostly in like 2008.
1571.64s: So even like YouTube and stuff like that wasn't huge then it existed but it wasn't huge with that data how did you even come across futures let alone like get to the level of proficiency where you know you're running 60 different trades at once with it.
1591.64s: The first trade I did I remember was in corn and I had no idea what I was doing and I started with $600 and immediately went to $400 and then I closed it and I said what happened.
1608.64s: And so I had to figure it out little by little you know talking to the broker reading a few books nothing comes to mind as being significant but just figuring out the math of it.
1619.64s: And then I guess the profound moment for me was to sit there with if you remember point and figure charts they're still available on some platforms hardly anybody uses them anymore back in the day when you didn't have computers you had little cards on the floor so they put X's up and zeros down or owes down and they could track.
1637.64s: They could track a lot of price information on a small card and they card could fit in their pocket with a pencil because they're out there without a desk and no computers and so that was point and figure was really big back in the 20s and 30s and 40s before computers but bar charts and candlesticks and all that are now the fancy stuff and very colorful.
1660.64s: So back in those days when I had that I took a bunch of point and figure charts about all the major commodities that I could possibly trade and I figured that out by just looking at the Wall Street Journal and they had a page and I saved all these Wall Street Journal third sections or whatever that were nothing but data and I had literally in my closet I had stacks and shelves of labeled by which year is which and going back for a decade or something.
1689.64s: So if I want to do a study on futures I just resigned myself to getting a long drink of iced tea or something and sitting at my desk and putting a big pile there and then saying okay what was the price of corn today and then put it over here and then do that it would take me a weekend sometimes and I would just go through and I just do one market and do all the point and figure.
1714.64s: What happened after I had a bunch of these charts is one day I decided you know a lot of money could be made in the very big runs.
1724.64s: So what I did is I laid the charts down on the floor never forget this it was in my living room and I'm sitting in the sofa and I cleared away this massive space and I just put all the charts facing me.
1738.64s: And from that far distance I could see every trade that I wanted to make sure I was in that.
1744.64s: Right. So I kind of circled him in a way I I yelled at him in so I knew this is a trade I need this is a trade I would like this is a trade I would like.
1755.64s: And so I took the top 10 things that I could see from a distance and I brought them all back up to the coffee table level now they're right in front of me again.
1766.64s: I said what are the common characteristics here of these trades these are the ones I want the other stuff is garbage it's not going to get you anything.
1775.64s: These are going to make you a lot of money.
1777.64s: So when I did that I discovered something that I thought I could live with that got nine out of the 10 of those trades.
1787.64s: That was the start of it.
1789.64s: That's really really interesting.
1792.64s: And then one thing led to another and I started realizing that just trend following was an easy way to pick up all of those trades 10 out of 10.
1803.64s: Right.
1804.64s: Don't filter it too much try to get in on every one of those big trades because they pay for a whole lot of losses.
1809.64s: Right.
1810.64s: That's interesting.
1811.64s: So do you think that like the cyclicality of futures was part of that analysis you were kind of because of like when you when you first start trading something like corn you know we may not think about the harvest season or the planting season you know what I mean stuff like that.
1828.64s: Okay.
1829.64s: And then.
1831.64s: So I think that's going up I want to be long if it's going down I want to be short.
1834.64s: Got it.
1835.64s: So generally irrespective of like the the future you know characteristics themselves but more how is it going to be on the chart predictions whatsoever just.
1847.64s: Look how it's moving and go with it.
1849.64s: You know I got it.
1850.64s: So I want to be strictly measuring the trend of the trends up I want to be long if it's down I want to be short the beauty of futures you can go in both directions right and so when the stock market was having a struggle over in my stock portfolio side.
1866.64s: I could be cleaning up over in the future side and you know life's good just keep going.
1872.64s: stocks are down and futures get up, the futures get a little more dominant. My math would have me
1878.16s: taking money from futures and moving it over into my stock portfolio. So now I'm buying stocks cheap
1883.60s: with the extra money I've made over in futures. That protects my drawdown coming up in futures
1888.64s: that sooner or later is going to happen. It gets me some cheap prices over in stocks and now that
1893.20s: goes crazy and maybe futures is struggling and again the other way it turns around and it takes
1900.56s: money from the stocks I put it over in futures. I keep balancing and rebalancing and rebalancing and
1905.92s: it improves your return to risk ratios and at this stage that's all I try to go for. It's very
1913.60s: high return to risk ratios. I like to get to little or no drawdowns I haven't got there yet but I
1921.04s: keep working at it because then your denominator the risk side gets to close to zero and your return
1929.36s: to risk gets close to infinity. That's a high comfort level for most people and certainly for a guy
1935.92s: like me in retirement it's perfect. I'd rather not have a lot of violent moves. Sometimes it's
1942.88s: unavoidable. I mean if crude oil one day is going negative like it did last year is I'm short
1949.44s: there's not much you can do about it you just have to kind of enjoy that ride and then deal with
1953.76s: whatever comes out of it typically a lot of brokers close those positions for you when you wanted
1959.20s: to have them or not but it was at a nice profit so yeah and I just put the position on for the next
1965.76s: month so I was not short but I took in the profit on the one that went to negative and I think that
1973.68s: that's the lesson you'll learn here is that you're looking at a lot of different return streams over
1979.44s: a lot of different time periods over a lot of different markets and your strategy dictates the
1988.40s: sort of the personality of that return stream so if you plot any strategy against any set of markets
1994.96s: and with a certain logical position sizing algorithm you're going to get some kind of equity curve
2000.56s: going up the page and what you find is one of my friends Lauren's Ben's Dorp I don't know if you
2007.52s: have heard of them automating your stock portfolio great book on multiple systems trading he lives
2012.80s: down in Brazil in a beautiful place he you know talks about when a track record's going up the page
2020.96s: and then has this little dips called drawdown and then they go back up and resume and make new highs
2025.92s: that's kind of like a hole it's like a pothole right and your job when you're trying to deal with
2032.08s: multiple systems and trying to think about diversifying yourself to try to improve your return to risk
2037.36s: is to fill that hole so ask yourself why did that loss occur and what could you do to fill the hole
2046.08s: is there an option strategy is there a hedging strategy that could have diminished the hole maybe
2052.64s: you don't fill it all the way maybe you just make the hole a lot less deep but you keep trying to
2058.48s: straighten that line out so it's just a smooth upward sloping line up the up the hill right right if
2067.84s: you have that you know if you had a line that looked like a CD or something and and you're and yet
2074.00s: you're making good returns in the markets that would be pretty nice so it's a good goal I haven't
2078.96s: gotten there yet but keep trying yeah I think it's a good good goal to shoot for at least though yeah
2087.04s: um so that leads me to kind of one last historic question for you again this one is kind of a
2095.04s: selfish question I'm just curious about it but you mentioned mutual fun timing um as you know part
2102.16s: of the I'm just curious what what did that look like because I've heard different variants of that
2106.24s: before but I'm yeah well of course today you have exchange-stated funds so mutual fun timing is just
2114.24s: is for the dinosaurs like me back in the old days um what you had to do you you've only had when I
2120.56s: came out of school I think there was 500 mutual funds or something like that in the world
2125.84s: nowadays there's I don't know how many ETFs I mean thousands and thousands yeah and uh
2132.56s: they trade tick by tick I mean there's a bit aspirat all day long uh so mutual fun timing look like
2139.92s: this again this is getting back into the ancient years uh but computers might have just barely
2146.00s: started coming into play but basically at about three o'clock in the afternoon
2151.44s: say it last time we would have to figure out whether we're going on a signal long or
2157.92s: selling whatever we were doing or just doing nothing and staying with what we had but let's say we
2163.28s: had to buy we would have to get that signal at about right at three have it already pre-calculated
2170.40s: have everything flexible ready to go we would fax it into a trading desk by 315 when the futures
2179.92s: markets kind of closed and the aftermarket trading finished up they had to know whether they were
2188.00s: buying or selling and how much and then try to adjust their positions so that they could
2192.88s: keep the mutual fund properly positioned for all these assets particularly important if you're
2198.08s: selling they need to raise cash to pay you off they need to sell something in those last 15 minutes
2204.00s: so there was a lot of that and a lot of it was manual and and the bigger you got the more of the
2210.08s: mutual funds hated you and uh then the right X's of the world came in in the early years where
2217.12s: they invented mutual funds that were geared towards timing they welcomed timers right and they got
2223.04s: tons and tons of business from the timing industry and then of course ETF started coming in and the
2228.24s: whole world changed and now everybody would time ETFs and that's what I trade now I don't even do
2233.36s: mutual funds anymore got I use ETFs I trade 20 sector funds and then I have a momentum ETF
2240.72s: program that a strategy where I I look for ETFs that are with a high relative strength over the
2247.92s: last 30 days and then I try to concentrate my purchases on those with fairly tight stops and then
2254.16s: let them run if they want to run and if they want to turn and take me out that's okay but these
2258.40s: are going to be very volatile kind of make a lot of money and an up move type instruments it's
2264.64s: only a small portion of my money so right just another return stream that's different from the
2269.92s: other return streams that's super interesting I get I kind of geek out about some of I don't know
2276.88s: just how things were um because it's me I think it's helpful for context because you know the the
2283.28s: market hasn't been around that long and a lot of people I think get used to the idea that what
2288.00s: they're doing right now will be working in 15 years it may or may not so I like to learn from
2295.68s: folks like you that have seen evolution and how you've adapted so yeah you know like there was no
2302.16s: Bitcoin might have been the business right right Bitcoin futures I'm trading Bitcoin futures there was
2309.12s: none of those just a few years ago um Ethereum just came in in December yep brand new and I'm trading
2316.88s: that now um so yeah things evolve which you got to be on the lookout for in my mind is
2326.56s: what viable liquid markets are they're out there and that actually have movement that are not
2332.96s: price fixed to my governments by something artificial because the more price movement happens the more
2341.36s: profit a trader can make it stands the reason if you buy something and you only sell it here you
2346.40s: didn't make anything right but if you can buy it here and sell it there then you're going to make
2351.60s: the difference between these two right and uh so you want things that move you like volatility but
2357.92s: you want to be able to attack the risk involved I think so many people out there including my dad
2367.36s: who uh like to buy CDs at the savings and loan was always trying to be fearful of risk protective
2373.84s: of risk he's trying to provide for his family he's a postal carrier in the circus area
2379.76s: and uh so he didn't have a huge sum of money and he didn't have a certainly my level of knowledge
2385.76s: of investments but he thought he was trying to avoid risk by going to a savings and loans CD
2395.12s: right but then what happened right reg it reg anomics interest rates went up savings and loans to
2400.88s: the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars went under including my dad's money so it turns out
2407.44s: the government came in and bowed out all bunch of people and my dad was made whole and he learned
2412.72s: his lesson that you know risk-free is an exactly risk-free right and you got to think a little bit more
2418.48s: through these things and I think that what my lessons that I've learned over my lifetime is the
2423.76s: best way to handle risk is not to try to avoid it but instead to try to attack it
2430.48s: so example mutual fund timing when it's an early lesson if I've got a gross stock mutual fund
2436.40s: that's going to go up in an up market but in a down market it's going to get killed how can I
2441.20s: tack the down market risk well there's a couple different choices back then it seemed like the
2446.96s: logical thing was to do is just sell out of it and go to a money market fund so put together a
2452.08s: trend following model you're going to miss the top but it's going to go down a certain amount
2456.40s: you're going to get a signal you're going to say okay I'm out that's enough of a loss from the top
2461.20s: I'm going to sit out here and let the market settle down give me a signal to the upside
2466.80s: soon as I get that signal I move it back into the risk right right attacking the risk by doing
2472.80s: something against that which I will will cause me to lose it and nowadays you could also use a
2480.80s: an index futures hedge so you could have the ETF on the one side if you wanted to and that's
2487.68s: going to make money with the palm going up and then you could put in place a futures hedge with a
2493.52s: signal and that's got to make money when it goes down if you balance them perfectly they're going
2500.00s: to move together you're going to make and lose equal amounts of money that's another way but
2505.12s: that futures hedge is attacking the risk and I think more you attack risk the more you feel
2512.96s: sort of empowered and relaxed I think one of the reasons Jack Schwagger always thought of me as
2517.36s: Mr. Serenity is that I attacked risk across so many different markets and so easily that
2524.24s: everything I did was sort of boring right of serene and I think too many traders get locked into
2531.52s: you know they follow ten or twenty stocks and they live and die with the intra day movements of
2537.04s: these twenty things that they got on five screens in front of them that's kind of limiting to me
2545.92s: I mean the action is all in twenty things I've got hundreds of things I can consider all automated
2552.72s: and it takes me 20 minutes a day and the rest of the day I go do other stuff I was out working on
2558.24s: subdivisions landscaping for two hours before lunch right beautiful day you know sunny out here
2564.64s: and Scottsdale and short sleeve shirt at this point you know a lot of the countries got the
2571.76s: park is on already and you know to me life can be pretty good to just if you're thinking through
2578.96s: what you're trying to achieve and you you kind of systematize it and attack the risk that you see
2585.52s: out there you're going to smooth things out and it's going to just going to make your mental
2589.76s: side of trading so much easier to deal with you're not going to be up at night and stressed out and
2595.84s: ulcers and all the things that you see you know that traders sometimes stereotypical traders go
2601.68s: through the Wall Street Wall Street the movie you know guys I'm not I'm if somebody told me to watch
2609.12s: a Wall Street movie that are series that they really really enjoyed and I watched the first couple
2614.32s: and I said this is garbage this has nothing to do with trading in my view it's it it was storytime
2621.92s: the whole time right it wasn't to me normal mathematical trading that I go through there's no
2628.40s: excitement like that so yeah it's it's funny so I I have a mentor that I reference on the channel a
2635.76s: lot just because he's an army doctor um he's old now he just retired from trading he's in his
2641.28s: eyes but he has a very similar mindset to you where you know he said as long as you are you have
2650.96s: a well-developed plan and implementing a plan there's nothing to get excited about um and I
2656.80s: I really think that that's an important message for people because I think a lot of people are
2662.64s: under the impression that the way to be successful is exactly like you said have six monitors put more
2668.96s: charts up and you know look at it for yeah exactly look at it for 16 hours a day and spaz out about it
2675.84s: I had a guy today on Twitter asked me a question he said you know I really feel like I've
2681.28s: got what I want to do with the stocks down and I've got my positions and it usually takes me
2687.12s: about you know a half an hour or so a day to get everything put in place and my stops are there
2693.12s: and everything's great but then I feel guilty like I don't know what I'm supposed to do the rest of
2698.16s: the time and and yet um all these people talk about trading and you know they're they're watching this
2707.76s: move and that move and they're putting charts on Twitter and it's it's sort of exciting sounding to
2713.84s: me and I don't I don't feel like I should be paying attention to that stuff but a lot of it's
2718.56s: compelling and I'm not sure if that's part of the trading process or not and I said no right 20
2723.44s: minutes a day 130 minutes you're all done go out and play golf go hit balls go work out go
2729.76s: yep make lunch go make dinner go uh I don't know read a book go watch a movie go prune your yard
2739.52s: yeah yeah yeah if you're grass yep my uh there's a million of other things you could do the very first
2745.04s: thing my mentor first told me about trading is you know this isn't where you go for excitement
2750.08s: this isn't where you go for entertainment he's you know if you can keep it not exciting and just
2754.80s: business and it's productive it's good and go do something else exactly yeah I would agree
2761.12s: so I'm really curious for like a more practical slash current conversation when I think about you
2769.12s: know most traders especially in my audience a lot of them are derivatives traders a lot of them trade
2774.16s: options um and things like that but I'm really curious to understand a little bit more about the way
2782.24s: that you like to approach you know hedging and filling in those potholes and things like that how do
2788.56s: you go about actually devising different ways to fill the potholes or to smooth that line a little
2795.36s: bit I have obviously my take on it but I imagine yours is probably a lot more developed
2802.96s: yeah and it's getting more and more complicated as I get older and I have a little bit more
2808.80s: well and I have more capabilities uh you know I'm consulting with a trading platform that is
2815.84s: hopefully going to be out in 2022 more on that one it happens but the as I get more automation and
2824.24s: what I'm doing either using spreadsheets or some programming what you end up with is ability to
2830.56s: expand your time horizons so let's say you know for a dog just draw some numbers they don't mean
2836.08s: anything uh let's say I'm running a strategy of 25 different futures markets and I'm doing it on a
2843.68s: picket number 21-day triple indicator bicell engine it's just to coin an example that's not what I do
2852.72s: but I'm just coining it to make it simple I could then take the platform and say well how about
2859.76s: a 10-day or a 9-day or something like that so now I've got a shorter term one how about a 50-day
2865.84s: what does that look like now the risks in a 50-day are going to be very long so your position size
2872.00s: is going to be very small the 9-day smaller risk size bigger positions but you're going to get a lot
2878.48s: more whip saws you're going to get a lot more action so but you're going to get different return
2883.68s: streams from each of those three time periods you then you start adding markets and you say instead
2890.64s: of 25 markets how about if I could go up to 50 markets now you're all of a sudden trading iron
2897.04s: iron or in Singapore or whatever you know lead in London or something you know you've got different
2903.84s: markets that are going to have different return streams some of those are going to be very different
2909.84s: from what you have now so they're going to help fill the hole because they could be making money when
2914.40s: yours the ones that you are currently trading or losing money then there's the whole gamut of
2921.28s: sort of geography there's stock indices around the world you can deal with there's sovereign
2927.68s: debt around the world you can deal with you can trade currencies around the world 24 hours just about
2934.40s: so there is precious metals tended to go most of the time around the world there's lots of energy
2941.28s: markets there's lots and lots of things that you can do that get you some exposures there so then
2948.56s: you have different strategies so now you're getting into let's say good example I decide that I'm
2957.92s: one of my strategies is to trade on a nine day basis the NASDAQ index futures long or short long
2966.40s: short back and forth it's all I do it's been highly profitable there's enough movement in it
2973.60s: that it seems to run far enough to where I can move my stops up to the point where I break even or
2979.52s: better and then I if it hits it I reverse go the other way all right so now that is one return stream
2986.24s: but it's going to be driven by the stock markets movement in one direction or the other but what
2992.80s: about those years or months where the stock market doesn't do anything well then I sit there and say
2999.60s: well you know there's these things called index options over here how about if I figure that we're
3007.12s: going into sideways actions and I get an overbought condition and sell a call spread
3014.08s: or I get an overbought a sold position in the markets oversold and I sell a a put spread so I've got
3024.00s: my I got a limited loss locked in I can't ever run away infinite loss or anything because I've got
3030.64s: myself covered I've got a limited return but it's going to tend to make the return as the market
3037.20s: goes sideways and the time premium disappears and the prices don't go anywhere so that's going to
3043.20s: coin a lot of money during sideways action when my trend following is going to be sitting there doing
3047.68s: nothing right so that's an example of aren't they both in the stock market sure but the way you
3054.56s: structure your strategies is so different that one can be making money while the other one's losing
3060.64s: on the same thing amazingly right so that's kind of the way I look at it I try to look at strategies
3068.96s: when I look at that hole and I see that the hole was caused by a lot of sideways action that caught my
3075.84s: trend following models in whip saws then I say to myself hmm how about if I came up with a strategy
3082.40s: that actually tried to trade in sideways markets and try to explain that and then you end up with
3086.72s: a whole different mindset and development development of the math and the logic that you would use to
3092.24s: try to extract a profit out of that but I'm going to start adding these pieces together and I've got
3097.28s: eight of them now I've got so many different pieces and I'm on my way to more I probably will have
3105.28s: who knows 12 to 20 over the next few years if the platform gets up and running and I have the
3110.48s: capability of leveraging my time even more I'll probably invent a few more so when you're going
3116.64s: through this automation process what what software are you using to actually automate right now
3123.28s: well that's one of the issues the platform is not finished it's not ready for time primetime yet I
3128.16s: get access to it as a alpha tester you could call it I'm sort of the the alpha consultant trying to
3135.92s: help help them build it and it's getting close I think within the week I'm going to probably be
3142.80s: running simulations on it so it's it's not forever off there but I'm hoping it's pretty quick
3148.96s: that we get it out there to the public but it could be a lot of fun for a lot of traders I think
3153.28s: but it's an easy to use platform that allows me to then get the data add some track markets play
3160.64s: with the actual strategies and the math that I want to use to buy and sell play with the position
3165.76s: sizing and run simulations of historical data right see how it acts now what I can do then
3172.56s: is I can design something that is going to try to go after that whole that I saw back there in
3179.28s: 2008 or whatever if I then run a new strategy I've got to try to design it so that it makes money
3189.68s: in 2008 and doesn't cost me too much the rest of the time when everything else was making money
3196.00s: because what I'm going to do is probably pull some of the success of the good strategies the
3200.16s: rest of the time down a little bit right but I'm going to then improve the 2008 whole smooth line
3208.08s: right you know so that's what I'm going for all the time and so that's a mentality I take on
3214.80s: I'll just try to I think through okay the prices aren't really going any place but they are you
3220.80s: know noise it's a noise band so in that type of environment I'd kind of like to sell the highs
3226.72s: by the lows and by the lows and sell the highs and I know I'm going to be limited on my monoprofits
3232.08s: I can make on each run so it's got to be a shorter term probably and I'm starting to you know
3237.68s: check the items off and so okay this is starting to sound like maybe this type of math would work
3243.36s: and I'll do some testing and and play with it a little bit see if I can come up with something
3248.40s: with the right markets and the right combination of math that's easy to run and simple and
3254.24s: understandable and strikes at the heart of that hole that I'm trying to fill and then I'm
3259.76s: I'm good to go and turn it on now we have number nine got it and then go look for number 10
3265.92s: so for those that are interested I know definitely in my audience there there's people that are
3271.68s: really interested in you know learning how to automate more effectively I I have invented far
3277.20s: into it myself you know I use primarily um think or swim is the platform and a lot of people do
3284.80s: and there's a bit you can do in there but it doesn't you know it doesn't sound anything close to
3290.16s: you know what this new platform would potentially be able to do but yeah for those for those that are
3295.84s: maybe interested in you know how they could take next steps to automate more of what they're doing
3302.72s: what would you recommend for them well the first thing I would do is it's kind of what I did you start
3307.92s: with spreadsheets I mean there's certain little functions that you do every day as a trader
3313.36s: an example um let's say you've got on your broker platform think or swim or whatever
3320.40s: you've got a distance between where the price is now and where your stop losses and the stop
3325.44s: losses you know line on the page you can easily see it and either in your head or by a calculator
3331.84s: you can say the risk portrayed is $13.27 well you can set up a spreadsheet it's sort of a macro where
3342.40s: you can put in $13.27 put in your equity and it could tell you how many shares you should have
3348.32s: right by your position sizing algorithm so there's things like that you can do so without having
3353.60s: to sit there and use a calculator you can use think or swim or some simple little spreadsheets
3360.96s: you know there's lots of API I know interactive brokers has spreadsheet API capability so they
3368.40s: can send you live data yeah on your on your account and on some pricing and then you could create
3374.08s: algorithms within the spreadsheet so that as this live data is coming in from your trader workstation
3380.16s: it's actually helping to make decisions and alerting you to they you should be buying this stock
3384.64s: over here it's breaking out right now that type of thing so little things like that uh the way I did
3391.28s: at my mentality when I first started was simple I was so busy being a chemical engineer running
3398.64s: money I was getting an MBA I was custom designing a house southwest of St. Louis I was getting married
3407.60s: I felt like I had five full-time jobs all at the same time I I ended up saying to myself what I
3416.48s: really need to do is to put myself out of business from the standpoint of trading I need to stop
3421.92s: working I need to have everything that I do is routine if it's something that I could tell a
3428.32s: computer to do and I can get rid of it that gives me another five or ten minutes a day I need that
3433.60s: five or ten minutes because I'm overwhelmed right so I worked really really hard at analyzing every step
3440.00s: that I went through every day kind of wrote it down and they said what out of here could I make go
3445.20s: faster or be more efficient I said ah ah right there instead of me writing down all these orders by
3451.76s: hand and pencil I could go ahead and try to get the computer to write those down and have them be
3458.08s: nice and printed so they wouldn't have to worry about my sloppy handwriting everybody could read it
3464.08s: all right now I got to sit there and I got a fax it how about if I got these things called fax cards
3468.96s: and put it in my computer and then have that dial up the broker's bottom and drop the fax straight to
3474.56s: him right from my computer so now I'm generating the text file and I'm sending it right from the computer
3480.72s: now hey that's starting to look interesting now how what can I do to automate the actual decision
3487.52s: making on the buy and sell well that's a little more hard because a little more difficult because of
3492.56s: the the nature of what I was trading and how I was trading at then but you know if you take long
3498.48s: enough you can pick away at it and tell the computer this is how I do what I do and now the
3503.20s: computers generating your orders position sizing gotta know how much to buy in sell well there's
3510.48s: math involved with that too you can put that into the computer so pretty soon you get down to the
3515.92s: end of the day and you hit one button and it incomes the data and hit another button it runs it
3520.32s: through your orders and another button it's transmitting to the broker and you're done in five to
3524.96s: ten minutes and you go on you just liberated an hour or two of your life every day right and that
3530.64s: was very valuable to me then and it's still valuable to me now I'd rather be out playing golf and
3536.08s: sitting in front of a computer fair enough I don't know I am a basemolite golf I like driving the
3542.80s: golf cart though but if computers sounds better than me than golf just cuz I just like the sun I
3549.28s: think the sun is so much fun and we get 330 sunny days a year here so I don't ever get tired of it
3555.76s: and it's to me it's just I don't know I I feel retired I don't feel as retired when I'm sitting
3563.44s: in front of a computer right yeah that sounds right so I'd one more question for you sure
3571.28s: had an interesting past couple of years with COVID and everything this coming year looks
3576.88s: equally interesting for a lot of reasons I'm just curious you know what do you think about 2022
3582.96s: coming up like as a macro whatever comes into the top of your mind about going into this trading
3589.76s: well my wife always jokes that she hears me say this so often and I'll say it one more time
3596.40s: she repeats it now she's heard it so many times I always try to remind myself that the market will do
3603.20s: at the market will do and if you keep you put that in a sign and stick it on your wall and remind
3610.00s: yourself of the fact that you got to be ready for everything and let's not get ahead of ourselves
3615.68s: and try to pre-position which way we're going to lean or what you think is going to happen because
3622.00s: then you psychologically get shaded one way and I like to stay dead neutral I completely
3628.08s: agnostic to the direction I mean I can see the stock markets it's been having a good run here
3634.48s: um I mean today I think the Nasdaq sit the skids a little bit but then they were coming back I don't
3639.60s: know whether it's going to carry or not but it's been doing pretty well through December and it could
3645.20s: easily continue on there's no reason for it to necessarily go down on the other side of it there's
3651.60s: lots of reasons why it could go down so I got to be ready for both I'm ready for both if the thing
3658.88s: wants to fall apart and go down 60% on the S&P fully prepared ready to go edges will be in place timing
3666.88s: you'll get me out of a lot of ETFs momentum will go to zero and I'll be in cash hopefully my futures
3673.68s: pick up some stuff over on the bond side maybe gold maybe currencies you know things like lumber
3681.52s: oil could collapse in a recession type of an environment gas could crush down copper could fall
3691.60s: you know we could have inflation in the meats and grains you know there's lots of opportunities
3696.88s: out there cotton coffee cocoa there's just lots of different return streams and so whatever happens
3707.20s: I'm I got everything I need in place to do what I got to do and so my I guess my the one thing I
3715.44s: think you could count on probably in 2022 will be volatility yeah so I'm kind of since volatility
3724.40s: helps feed my profits I'm kind of looking forward to that but because the more volatile a market is the
3730.24s: more profit you can make from it of course the more risk you have to manage but I do do a decent
3736.64s: job I think of managing risk and position sizing is a forte of mine I wrote a book on the subject
3744.40s: so I think that that's my my attitude towards trying to predict 2022 I almost am agnostic as to
3752.24s: what's going to go on as a trader now as a citizen I got totally different opinion sure I really hate
3758.40s: what the last year I thought we've shot ourselves in a foot as a country so many different ways I
3762.48s: can't I believe it in it's happened so fast it's just stunning and how the how anybody thinks what
3771.44s: we're doing is logical long term is just beyond me but hey I'm one guy one boat and we'll see where it
3780.80s: goes from here but well I think some things really got to change or we're going downhill so fast
3786.72s: when we're not be any markets to trade down the road that'll be a bad day yeah but yeah right now
3795.28s: I'm just watching them move around and I'm sort of amazed they're up as much as they are but hey I'm
3801.28s: long like 75% of my sectors and I've got one momentum ETF on and had a good day in futures today so it
3810.00s: was you know it's a good day and I just try to have positive days every day if I can
3815.76s: right and it sounds like you know just the general disposition is seeing what the market you know
3821.60s: offers and then taking advantage where you can yeah I think traders have to I think there's
3826.48s: that old adage you can't control the wind but you can adjust the sales yeah and I think that that's
3833.36s: a real good analogy to the stock to the to the markets in the trading of markets
3839.76s: in that I can't control whether lumber prices go up or down I'm right just a small fry retired guy
3848.64s: and but I can say all right let's see right now the directions up I'm long so as it continues up
3858.08s: that a real good day in lumber today now a week from now or less even it could turn around
3866.64s: you start going the other way giving my signal to go short I'm out of the long take the profit go
3871.68s: short and then starts plummeting all right so I've adjusted my sales the wind has definitely changed
3878.40s: direction and I just adjust the sales and I you know continue to propel the vote don't worry about
3884.88s: which way your job is to is to let the market do what it wants to do because that's what it'll do for
3891.76s: forever and your job as a trader is to position yourself so that you attack the risk and exploit the
3898.16s: profit right yeah and can only exploit what's there if there's no movement and the markets go dead
3905.28s: sideways for the whole year you'll be lucky to even break even because there's costs of trading
3911.52s: there's whip saws there's all sorts of things so you really need movement I actually did a study
3916.64s: that's added joy the right dot world on movement and markets equals profits for the commodity
3922.64s: industry if there's no movements and the volatility is very low that month in the industry then you'll
3929.12s: see the CTA performance indexes will be lousy negative yeah hard to speculate there's big volatility
3936.88s: you'll see the CTAs do very well right right and and that actually leads me to kind of the
3944.72s: last part here is I did have the opportunity as I was talking about before we started recording to
3951.76s: check out enjoy the ride dot world but I thought it'd be you know cool just to talk about it for
3956.72s: a couple minutes here before we sign off because like I was saying one of my favorite things to do
3962.24s: is to connect traders with resources and there's a lot of really good reading on there that I
3968.40s: I don't know so yeah yeah talking about it enjoy the ride came out of a interesting session by
3976.32s: pool in Molagas, Spain with Rosado in our hands a nice little chilled Spanish wine my wife and I
3985.36s: were just I don't know talking about all sorts of things and I said you know I wish there was one
3989.84s: problem in my life I wish I could solve I get I enjoy helping new traders coming into the business
3996.32s: I feel like it's my way of giving back to what's been a very great city you know career for me
4001.60s: and but they ask me the same questions over and over and over again and I find myself typing
4009.84s: emails like thousands of emails I've already done and I must have answered you know any one
4016.24s: question a hundred times and it's very inefficient and it's not getting smaller it's getting worse
4024.00s: more people seem to know I mean I've back then I had I wasn't even on Twitter hardly and now I've
4028.96s: got like 33,000 or 32,000 Twitter followers so everybody's always asking me questions and I'm
4034.96s: trying to answer them all yeah but um so I started thinking you know what we need is a way to
4041.44s: automate the way that it could respond to the emails and she said well why don't you like kind of do
4049.44s: some of your friends do actually run trader sort of mentoring or education programs where you actually
4057.68s: you know work with them and make them go to school you know run a school basically for traders
4063.60s: they say yeah but then I'd be working again I'm retired I don't want to work on backwards
4068.64s: I'm going backwards this is not right so then I explain the difference between synchronous and
4073.36s: asynchronous what we're doing right now is synchronous because we're both on the zoom call together
4078.96s: but asynchronous means you send me an email and I'm out in the golf course when I get back from
4083.36s: the golf course I answer your email I don't have to be around when you actually said something
4090.00s: and so that's why I always like the email approach but we started evolving into well how about if
4097.84s: you had a collection that people could get to they said like a website ah there's the answer
4104.32s: and we thought how we could call it like how about enjoy the ride.com and it turns out it was taken
4111.92s: of course so I said well how about enjoy the ride.world because I have people sending me emails
4117.44s: from all around the world asking me trading questions in India and China and Taiwan and Japan and
4123.84s: sometimes I have to use Google translate to even understand what they're asking and Google
4128.72s: translate to answer them by the way too because I I hope it translates well because I have no idea
4133.92s: what it says when it's translated and so all of a sudden enjoy the ride.world got born about
4142.08s: I guess it was about three and a half years ago or something four years ago and what
4146.96s: what I did is it took about nine months to a year of learning how to create a website it was
4153.04s: fascinating to me I never knew how to do that and I learned a lot and got everything all lined up
4159.44s: and then I just started going out into the web and I was astonished to put my name into a web search
4166.16s: and then look at how many citations and things that are out there from my earlier career that are
4172.16s: still there and so I just collected all the research papers that I'd ever written started collecting
4177.52s: the interviews from people that I either had copies of or had access to or links to further
4184.80s: interviews like this one hopefully we'll put on the website so future visitors to the website
4190.96s: will see you and I talking you and me talking and so that's kind of evolved and then people were
4199.20s: asking me what kind of books do you recommend well I'll do a recommended reading page and I'll put
4203.44s: a broader of how I recommend them and then how about do you ever do webinars I mean do you ever
4210.64s: do that type stuff well yeah if my wife and I feel in the mood we we set up a webinar and we talk
4215.84s: about a topic and she produces it and I I do all the presentation and answer the questions she
4221.28s: asks the questions and people live are asking me questions and those are fun and then I record them
4227.36s: and put them on there and people can watch them in the future did a video series on how to create a
4231.84s: trading strategy for yourself every now and again Lawrence and I'll do a seminar if
4239.04s: if governments around the world will allow their people to travel to different places
4245.12s: it's been hard to do a seminar lately because you can't get anybody to come to it because they
4249.68s: can't get here. Lawrence had a three-week process to go through to get to the last seminar it was
4257.12s: very expensive and very involved involved two different tests he's fully vaccinated he's never had it
4264.32s: and yet three weeks to get here it was crazy I drove down from my my place here that I'm talking
4272.72s: right now down to the Phoenician so it was me for me it was like a 20-minute trip right by car
4278.88s: but that's essentially that's what happened I put my hedging page up there I put
4283.36s: but trying to remember what else I have there there's a whole bunch of different types of things on
4289.60s: enjoy the right that world it'll allow a trader to just come in and you know if you want to just
4294.96s: listen to an interview listen to this interview hear what questions you're asking you might he might
4300.40s: pick up one gem of wisdom there along the way and then watch another one pick up something else
4307.52s: and hopefully it crystallizes some people's thinking and gets them head started a little bit down
4311.84s: the path because when I started out I had then vent all the stuff myself there was no there was no
4317.28s: internet to speak there was no mentoring programs there was there was physical copies of books and I
4325.04s: read a lot of books on trading and mental side of trading the trading psychology if you well but
4331.44s: the resources out there now at places like enjoy the right dot world are so extensive that you could
4336.56s: just research for six months or a year before you ever get started and it would be well along the
4343.04s: process yeah where where you need to be it's awesome well I'm sure a lot of people are really
4349.60s: thankful you know that you've taken the time to put that together I definitely enjoyed poking
4353.28s: through it myself I'll make sure to link to the website also in the video description when I
4359.28s: put this up and I will do the same the other way with this interview awesome perfect it'll be fun
4365.84s: one more interview the interview page is getting very very long good you could you could probably spend
4370.48s: 40 50 hours listening to me talk to different people it's good if you if you had the time it's
4376.32s: good I think people like you with the amount of experience you have you know the fact that you take
4381.68s: the time to share it with people yeah um is really impactful um the last question I have for you is
4388.56s: I know you're on Twitter um so you know if somebody wants to look you up see what you talk about
4394.64s: on there it looks like it's um at bosso underscore tom also went to that and I'm the I'm the same
4401.60s: exact thing on Gitter J-E-T-T-R and I'm enjoy the right dot world on my page on Facebook okay and uh
4414.40s: boop boop boop boop let's see I think I'm enjoy the right dot world on parlor and me way
4420.56s: okay do a search on my name on me way and so I'm on uh linked in uh tom b Also
4428.56s: um so I'm on linked in as well so there's lots of places I have an Instagram account but I've
4434.88s: never quite figured out I mean it's kind of like they want to have a picture there to do something and I
4441.52s: I work with computers and messages and economic data and all I did
4446.72s: Instagram doesn't fit what I do that much it's not like I'm trying to sell my uh my golf shirts
4452.56s: right I wear my ETR golf shirts but nobody else does it's funny you say that just because a lot of
4458.24s: people you know especially for like YouTube and stuff like that it's helpful to be on on Instagram but
4464.32s: I hate it so it is not my most hated social media is Twitter I can't stand Twitter
4473.44s: it I think I must be I don't know what's the term is it you there's a term for it
4481.44s: low-quacious is that a proper term I use a lot of words I talk too much or whatever but
4489.12s: 288 characters I see it's not sufficient for me to get across I see and uh but you know I get
4496.48s: same setup it's 777 characters got it so it looks the same but I got 777 characters you just have
4504.96s: to do the you just have to do the comment thing you know where they have the first title and then
4509.44s: they start writing their own well and you see these things are broken in the five pieces it's yep
4514.64s: it's a thousand characters broken in the five different posts and oh gosh I come on and then
4521.60s: it's absolutely on it and then Twitter the other thing I don't like about Twitter I have my picture
4526.08s: up there on my profile right and I got it's the same picture everybody sees I think it's got the
4531.92s: screen behind me on it I've had seven imposter and all of them yeah use that same picture now tell
4541.04s: me Twitter can't lock down that photo somehow or make it you know I I run into all sorts of other
4550.48s: images that you can't even do a control screen on you can't capture the screen because it'll
4557.04s: block it it just depends on security you can't tell me Twitter can't come up with a way to get rid
4562.56s: of imposter's you just got to get them to verify your account get that blue checkmark and then
4567.68s: ever try to try twice they turn me down both times apparently I'm not enough of a public figure
4573.68s: or personality you're an imposter or sports figure or whatever else I'm supposed I'm not an actor
4581.28s: so no no blue check for me that sucks yeah so I look over there at Gitter and I like
4591.36s: but I do like me we me we is my Facebook kind of alternative gotta me we flows a lot like Facebook
4600.16s: does there's more pictures there's more it's a little bit lengthier articles and links to research
4607.92s: papers and things so that I'd say me we and Gitter probably are getting to be my two favorites to
4614.24s: be on a Twitter and let me Facebook I do for the family you know vacation we all do that some
4620.48s: stuff yeah but other than that it's it's not exactly efficient yeah I totally agree but I'm not
4629.20s: all of them definitely thanks for obviously sharing where people can get aholdy ill and more
4635.36s: importantly thanks for taking some time to chat with me I really enjoyed learning definitely a bit
4641.52s: about your background which is always fascinating to me but then also just some more current stuff
4647.44s: you know how people can take a look at their portfolios different ways to diversify risk and
4652.48s: things like that so thanks a lot for hanging out for a bit it was totally fun and if there's a
4658.08s: need let's do it again it was I would love to do it again yeah thanks Tom it's great
