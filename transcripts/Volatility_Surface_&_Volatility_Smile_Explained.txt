0.88s: so we use the black shoals martin model
3.44s: when we're pricing options you've heard
5.68s: that before
6.96s: all good
8.08s: now once we understand options a little
10.24s: bit more we come to find out that all of
12.56s: the assumptions in the bsm are not
15.92s: exactly correct one of which is how it
19.52s: integrates implied volatility into the
22.00s: pricing of options primarily how it
24.32s: assumes implied volatility so this video
28.08s: is going to talk about the implied
30.40s: volatility surface and the implied
33.28s: volatility smile so that anybody that
36.24s: trades options that's interested in the
38.56s: inner workings can have a better
40.24s: understanding on how premiums are
42.48s: actually calculated because
44.64s: they are not calculated in a textbook
46.96s: fashion as the black shoals model would
50.40s: assume so what's up everybody eric here
53.52s: welcome back to all the outliers and
55.76s: again we have a little more of a
56.96s: technical session here but i aim to make
59.52s: this video consumable we're going to
62.00s: keep it to less than 10 minutes but i'm
64.16s: hoping to share some useful information
65.84s: so that you can understand the underside
68.08s: of options a little more holistically so
70.96s: let's jump over and get to it so as i
73.76s: already mentioned the black shoals
75.60s: martin model it comes with a whole list
78.32s: of assumptions and not all of them are
81.60s: accurate one of which is the pricing of
86.24s: an underlying security and the reason
88.96s: why that matters is because it impacts
90.96s: how implied volatility is assumed to be
94.64s: so
95.68s: when we're talking about the bsm
97.76s: it normally assumes a log normal
101.36s: distribution which in this scenario i'm
104.40s: specifically referring to the cumulative
106.40s: distribution of a log normal
107.92s: distribution i mentioned that because a
110.32s: log normal distribution can look very
112.32s: different depending on you know what
114.72s: level of statistics you've taken and how
117.60s: often you use this stuff so really when
120.32s: i'm saying log normal or normal
122.80s: distribution in this context i'm
125.52s: referring to the cumulative distribution
127.52s: of a log normal distribution
129.76s: okay so
131.04s: got it i just said the same couple words
133.28s: a few times what the hell does it mean
135.20s: let's talk about it so down below right
137.76s: below those words i have what a
141.52s: cumulative distribution of a log normal
143.28s: distribution can look like and what
145.44s: you're seeing here is also what is
148.00s: commonly referred to as a normal
149.76s: distribution where we have the mean in
152.24s: the middle and then we have symmetrical
154.84s: tails to both positive and negative
159.20s: sides of the mean
161.36s: however this is not how price is
165.20s: actually observed in the marketplace and
167.68s: because that is not how price is
170.00s: actually observed in the marketplace
171.84s: that is also not how implied volatility
175.76s: is calculated because again
178.16s: implied volatility is essentially just
180.80s: our assessment of future price movement
184.56s: and deviation off of a mean
186.80s: so when we talk about options implied
190.00s: volatility and price they both do not
193.04s: exhibit a normal distribution they have
197.44s: both either or or both
200.32s: kurtosis and skew
202.00s: so what is kurtosis and what is skew
205.68s: essentially both kurtosis and skew lead
208.96s: to fat
210.24s: tails in our
212.40s: data and i don't know about you but
214.88s: nothing gets me going like a good old
216.88s: fat tail
218.88s: in statistics
220.80s: um but on the left hand side here i'm
223.04s: showing you two things i'm showing you
224.56s: what kurtosis looks like and then i'm
226.32s: showing you what skew looks like so
228.72s: kurtosis which is this bit up here we
231.36s: have three different kinds this isn't a
233.28s: statistics course i'm not going to go
234.80s: into all of them the punch line here is
237.68s: as we see
239.20s: different styles of kurtosis an
241.76s: important function is occurring the
244.08s: tails
245.36s: represent the far ends of the data set
249.20s: and typically speaking as you can see
251.36s: over here
252.64s: when we're looking at a normal
254.08s: distribution it assumes that there is a
257.36s: very very small amount small number of
260.32s: occurrences that take place as we get to
263.44s: the extremes of the data set or the
265.44s: tails
266.48s: however when we have kurtosis we
269.28s: increase likelihood of occurrence in a
273.28s: tail so for example
275.20s: if you look at just regular stock market
277.52s: prices and you plot them out it is not a
279.60s: normal distribution we exhibit and
282.00s: experience moves
283.84s: that statistically would be unsound in a
286.56s: normal distribution more frequently than
289.04s: we should so part of that is due to
291.84s: kurtosis and that's just a function of
294.24s: the pricing of the markets and the way
296.32s: things that move
298.16s: the other function that we see sometimes
300.72s: is skew
302.48s: where normally if we have a symmetrical
304.88s: distribution again both sides of the
308.56s: distribution would have the similar
310.64s: shape just like you see here although
312.96s: this looks like it has
314.72s: cancer and a lot of growths because i
316.24s: can't draw straight with the mouse but
317.76s: you get the idea
319.28s: and then on the positive skew negative
321.76s: skew essentially again what you're
324.56s: seeing is an increase or decreased
327.04s: likelihood of occurrences within a tail
330.08s: so if we look at this example of a
331.84s: negative skew we see that the tail
334.32s: actually raises up on this side compared
337.28s: to this side which means that we exp
340.08s: experience additional outsized moves
342.88s: that are not priced into a normal
346.16s: distribution curve so why did i just go
349.52s: into an impromptu session on basic
353.20s: statistics well it's because all of this
356.16s: leads to
357.52s: what i'm about to talk about which is
359.60s: the volatility surface so this in and of
362.72s: itself is not the funnest stuff to go
366.24s: through so if you made it be sure to
367.92s: like the video let us know that you got
370.16s: through at least the first half
372.16s: now let's transition over to the output
375.04s: so we now understand what the black
377.76s: shells model
379.60s: assumes
381.04s: now we also understand that that's not
383.12s: actually what the market exhibits so
385.92s: let's talk about how we compensate and
388.40s: what we use
390.00s: is the volatility surface and volatility
393.52s: smiles
395.12s: so on the center of the screen there
397.52s: this is a chart i pulled from
398.72s: investopedia which pulled from wikipedia
400.72s: which i have no idea who the original
402.32s: author is but it's a very reasonable
403.84s: chart so i didn't bother making one
406.08s: and it shows you the implied volatility
408.32s: surface so what i want to highlight is
411.04s: there are a couple different aspects to
413.36s: it we have time to maturity over here on
416.80s: this axis
418.16s: then we have moneyness how far something
420.32s: is in or out of the money on this axis
423.28s: and then we have the implied volatility
425.20s: on this axis
426.72s: the black shoals model would essentially
429.20s: assume that the implied volatility
431.28s: surface would be flat meaning we use the
433.52s: same implied volatility for the same
436.56s: series
437.52s: time expiration of options across the
439.76s: different series but that's not what we
441.92s: do what happens is if we open up the
446.00s: trading platform
448.96s: and we take a look
450.56s: at let's pick this options change so
452.64s: this is in the spy and i'm looking at
454.72s: the 19 august 31 options chains i want
457.92s: you to notice something if i take a look
460.64s: at this column right here on the put
462.72s: side this is implied volatility the
465.44s: furthest one i have listed here as of
467.44s: right now is a 12 delta and it's a
470.04s: 29.23 implied volatility
473.04s: then if i go to the at the money option
475.52s: i see 22.9
478.12s: 22.8
479.68s: and then if i go further in the money i
482.40s: see
483.40s: 22.7 and then i see a period a little
486.32s: further in
488.00s: that's 20.31
490.64s: all of that is just on the put side if
493.68s: we look at the implied volatility for
495.60s: this options chain
497.92s: which means this specific expiration
500.40s: it's 24.78
502.88s: if i look at the implied volatility for
505.60s: spy in general it's 24.69
508.80s: if we go back into the 19 august and we
511.36s: look at the call side
513.04s: and let's find a 12
516.48s: delta
517.92s: call
519.04s: so that would put us
521.04s: out here the 12 delta call implied
524.08s: volatility
525.44s: is
527.04s: 18.51
529.28s: so what you're seeing is
531.20s: the same delta out of the money option
534.08s: for calls and puts is different but
536.24s: there's a couple important trends that
538.40s: you should have noticed as i ran through
540.00s: that which is the smile which we'll get
541.60s: into in just a second
543.20s: but essentially by looking at the
545.20s: moneyness for different options the
547.44s: different times to expiration time to
549.68s: maturity dte
551.60s: we're seeing that there are different
553.36s: implied volatilities which is why it's
555.04s: called a volatility surface because it's
556.88s: taking in multiple inputs and it's
559.04s: giving you exactly this it's a surface
561.36s: profile where we can experience
564.08s: different implied volatilities for
566.32s: different series of options in the same
568.96s: expiration or different expirations the
571.60s: main punch line is it's not the same as
574.80s: the black scholes model would assume
576.72s: so i showed you that the call implied
580.08s: volatility was different than the put
581.92s: implied volatility for the same out of
583.84s: the money delta why
585.60s: that's because of the volatility smile
588.16s: so essentially on a vertical axis here
590.88s: we have implied volatility and then on
593.36s: the horizontal axis here we have um the
596.80s: strike price so whether it's in the
598.64s: money or out of the money and we're
600.64s: looking at puts here but essentially we
603.52s: see a little bit of a smile unless
606.56s: there's a skew in the smile or kurtosis
608.96s: which can occur
610.32s: but essentially what it means is that
612.24s: again the implied volatility for
614.64s: different series different strikes is
616.72s: not flat it's not equal
619.52s: we have at the money typically b
622.16s: seems to be lower implied volatility
625.52s: whereas deep out of the money or deep in
628.24s: the money tends to have increased
629.84s: implied volatility as you saw in that
632.24s: example i just showed you it's not
633.84s: always the case but very frequently is
636.16s: the case it is product specific
638.64s: so
639.84s: to recap because i got 10 minutes and 40
642.08s: seconds i want to keep my promise
644.64s: overall
646.96s: the black shoals model
648.88s: in a vacuum assumes a log normal
651.92s: distribution which is the cumulative
653.60s: distribution of a log normal
655.36s: distribution
656.80s: that
657.60s: has certain series of assumptions that i
660.00s: showed to you are not the case
662.48s: so what that leaves us with
664.56s: is
665.36s: people
666.40s: that interact with the markets create
669.20s: implied volatility services for the
671.84s: individual securities that they're
673.12s: trading based on their series of
675.84s: assumptions to arrive at what they
677.92s: perceive to be the correct implied
679.60s: volatility for that product and that
683.12s: leads to different implied volatilities
686.08s: for
687.12s: various strikes within the same
688.88s: expiration and within different
691.20s: expirations
692.88s: so all of this is to say that the market
695.52s: at least that is of this point is
697.84s: pricing in
699.36s: different volatilities than the black
700.88s: shells model would assume and it is
703.76s: because the market does not move the way
706.48s: that the black shoals model assumes that
709.44s: it does we have fat tails we have more
712.32s: outlier cases than we would expect to
714.24s: see and that is exactly why the
716.88s: volatility surface is not flat in why we
720.00s: have a volatility smile
721.76s: so
722.80s: if you made it all the way through this
724.56s: video make sure you comment with what
726.64s: you learned or what you would add so
728.64s: that we could crowdsource some
729.84s: information plus i'm just curious to see
731.68s: who makes it through um the entire
733.76s: videos on these i know they're kind of
735.04s: heavy but i am fascinated by this stuff
737.92s: because even though that the model that
739.76s: we primarily use to price options wasn't
742.00s: perfect the markets found a way to still
744.64s: make it all work based on real
746.80s: information as we got it and that's
748.24s: fascinating to me so
750.08s: as always keep on being an outlier keep
752.56s: expanding our knowledge
754.24s: come join the community if you haven't
755.84s: checked out our discord it's completely
757.28s: free you can find the link in the video
759.28s: description below and until next time be
761.60s: an outlier see y'all later
