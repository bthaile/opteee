0.66s: how I grew my trading account from just
4.38s: three thousand dollars back when I was
6.96s: in high school to over one million
9.96s: dollars today over the course of 14 full
13.26s: trading years 15 partial what's up
15.72s: everybody Eric here I'm gonna walk you
17.46s: through four things and I think these
20.34s: four things if you take them seriously
22.56s: have the capacity to completely change
25.38s: the Outlook of your trading portfolio
28.08s: and your future wealth so I want to walk
31.14s: through these four things and at the end
33.00s: I explicitly want to dive into some of
35.64s: the other important investing asset
38.94s: classes that have helped me seriously
41.28s: compound my growth all right so first
43.44s: off save aggressively this cannot be
45.90s: overstated early on and it is because
47.88s: the power of compounding interest is
50.22s: Amplified by the principal amount of
52.38s: money you have to start so I want to
54.78s: walk you through visually this is from
57.86s: investor.gov and I'm taking an initial
60.60s: principle of three thousand dollars and
64.32s: I'm forecasting it out over 15 years and
68.82s: in this scenario we're adding zero
71.28s: dollars so that three thousand dollars
73.68s: at twelve percent return which is
75.78s: essentially an average Market return
77.60s: over the course of 15 years will net you
81.36s: sixteen thousand four hundred and twenty
83.52s: dollars sounds pretty lame I agree next
86.40s: we have the same exact scenario however
89.28s: now we're adding just one hundred
92.94s: dollars a month that's it 100 a month
96.80s: steam everything else takes you from
99.84s: Sixteen thousand four hundred twenty
101.76s: dollars now to 61
105.38s: 156 dollars that's just an additional
108.66s: one hundred dollars a month I think
111.06s: you're starting to get the idea here
112.62s: however
113.88s: I don't know about you but I don't
116.22s: consider sixty one thousand dollars
118.52s: swimming in money or really too
120.90s: aspirational so let's amp this up a
123.48s: little bit again everything else is
126.12s: exactly the same however now instead of
129.18s: doing 100 a month we're doing a thousand
131.76s: and our future value is four hundred
135.78s: sixty three thousand half a million
137.46s: dollars now I want you to take a step
140.28s: back if you saw the one hundred dollars
142.68s: and you're like yeah okay super doable
144.78s: let's do that and then you see the
146.34s: Thousand you're like whoa way too much
148.08s: money don't sweat that the reason why I
151.08s: say don't sweat that is your savings
153.60s: rate should change as you expand and
157.56s: grow in your roles at work ideally until
160.56s: you're able to do whatever the else
162.24s: you want but as you grow in your salary
166.76s: this is essentially just an average so
170.34s: early on I was not putting one thousand
173.28s: dollars into my account I was literally
176.22s: would have been a third of the entire
177.96s: account that I saved for my entire life
180.00s: up until when I first started
182.76s: but if I averaged out my contributions
185.70s: then you know we start to have a
187.74s: different conversation so I want to show
189.06s: you one other of these before we move on
191.04s: and this one is if we start saving
195.20s: twenty five hundred dollars a month I
198.12s: just want to show you that at a three
200.10s: thousand dollar principle if you put in
202.44s: 2500 bucks per month again at 12
205.58s: interest you're a millionaire in 15
208.14s: years so this again might be a little
210.48s: aspirational for people but the point
212.46s: being is you might not just be starting
214.20s: with three thousand dollars all I want
216.48s: to show you is with a low principal
218.64s: amount but consistent contributions can
221.64s: make a humongous difference over our
225.18s: Outlook okay cool next thing on this is
228.36s: take risk so we now know we have to save
230.94s: aggressively but what do we need to do
232.86s: with that principle in order to make
234.72s: money you got to take some risk so on
237.48s: the right hand side of this this is just
240.30s: another compound return calculator
243.00s: I have the same setup as before however
246.48s: here's the difference
248.16s: we're not adding in any additional money
250.50s: but I slashed the rate of return from 12
255.92s: down to six percent so this is at a six
259.44s: percent return same everything else and
262.14s: notice we walk out with seventy two
264.72s: hundred dollars however at a 12 return I
269.82s: want you to notice something very
271.08s: important we more than double so even
274.62s: though this is only double the rate of
278.58s: return from six to twelve percent which
280.50s: is still Rel 12 Market average depending
283.14s: on what time frame you pick but we've
285.30s: more than doubled the future value that
288.42s: is compounding returns working away if
291.36s: you are young you should be open to risk
294.12s: I truly wish
296.28s: I was more receptive to risk now once
299.10s: you decide to start getting in that's
300.72s: for Passive investors if you want a
303.30s: passive invest that's a great way to go
304.98s: but if you're interested in really
307.56s: accelerating this time frame in a pretty
309.42s: big way we got to get a little more
311.04s: active so this is where these things
313.74s: come into play on the left hand side is
315.78s: my trading plan on the right hand side
317.40s: is actually a snapshot from a bunch of
320.04s: back testing that I'm doing right now
321.66s: you've got to start tracking this stuff
323.94s: so if you decide to start trying to
326.76s: trade actively I have a couple videos
329.04s: that will be of extremely use to you on
332.16s: trading plans trading logs strategy
334.14s: outlines how to get documentation in
337.32s: good notes so you can become a better
339.36s: Trader and ultimately find yourself
342.42s: closer to this kind of thing this on the
345.36s: bottom left hand side is taking an
348.00s: initial principle of three thousand
350.04s: dollars again 15 years ago we're adding
353.64s: fifteen hundred dollars per month
355.14s: however the return is 22 percent how did
359.28s: I pick 22 percent well my compound
361.50s: annual growth rate right now over the
364.20s: last 14 years is 22.8 percent so this is
368.52s: an unlimitedly and very achievable rate
372.06s: of return for people who take this
373.86s: seriously if you half-ass it you will
376.68s: not even beat the market you probably
378.18s: won't even be profitable but if you take
380.22s: it seriously I am nothing special I've
382.92s: done nothing special I'm not that smart
385.02s: so if I can get to something like this
387.36s: other people most certainly can I'm not
389.94s: in the U.S investing championships like
392.40s: Mark minivani with 300 Returns on a year
395.64s: that's not what this is this is steady
398.34s: consistent returns over a moderate
400.86s: period of time with relatively moderate
403.38s: savings again relative to where you're
405.18s: at in your career progression and if
407.10s: you'll notice on this alone without
409.26s: touching anything else we're at 1.6
411.84s: million
412.80s: now notice how this is about investing
415.44s: in various assets this is a wire in that
419.10s: I got this year from a rental property
421.80s: that I sold this is why spreading into
425.04s: other asset classes is super important
427.86s: when it becomes available to you so this
430.20s: is why I got into things like Angel
431.76s: Investing real estate like you see here
433.98s: with rental properties but also selling
435.96s: the properties when it makes sense to me
438.06s: so by using your capital in different
440.58s: areas you get to take advantage of
442.14s: different market conditions and make
444.18s: buku bucks get out there make some money
446.88s: money cannot buy you happiness poverty
450.06s: can't buy you so make some money
452.28s: you'll probably be happier until next
454.02s: time be an outlier if you enjoyed the
456.30s: video make sure you like And subscribe
458.64s: see you guys
