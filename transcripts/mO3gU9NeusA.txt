0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
90.00s: you
120.00s: you
150.00s: you
180.00s: you
210.00s: you

450.00s: you
452.00s: you
480.00s: you
482.00s: you
510.00s: you
512.00s: I
540.00s: base documentation in place.
542.16s: So again, in my mind, this is inferred,
544.12s: but it's worth outlining explicitly.
546.96s: You have to have a place to track this stuff.
549.08s: This can literally be done in a word doc
552.12s: and Google Sheets in Excel, any of those are fine.
555.88s: And the way that I set those up is kind of like side-by-side.
560.24s: I have tons of videos that go through that is always
562.20s: happy to answer specific details,
564.24s: but that's the base structure of everything we do
567.20s: and outlier trading.
568.56s: If you're around this community for any longer
570.92s: than three months and you don't hear the term
574.00s: trading plan trading log, at least it does in times,
576.48s: I have failed you.
577.76s: That's effectively what this is.
580.08s: It's all about the feedback loop.
581.96s: Now, the stuff that I think people are a little more
584.08s: interested in are in the market research segment.
586.68s: So things like SSRN, Thinker Swim, O-Rats,
589.68s: unusual whales, bar chart, regular news feed,
592.64s: Fred, stuff like that.
594.80s: So I will go through these.
596.08s: Now again, this is by no sense in exhaustive list.
600.60s: It absolutely isn't.
602.20s: If I go through my investing bookmark,
605.20s: there's probably, like I'm looking at part of it right now,
608.88s: there's probably three to 500 bookmarks in here.
613.68s: There's tons, just absolute tons.
616.80s: And it's because there's just a ton of information.
619.68s: So like there's Fred, there's NBE,
622.44s: R, there's Edgar, so when you see this bucket here,
628.16s: this research-based bucket,
632.28s: this is like Econ info.
635.24s: So this is again like Fred, Edgar,
640.00s: NBE are all of those kinds of entities
646.08s: and that's where you can get economic data.
649.56s: So when you see those, you shouldn't look,
652.04s: you shouldn't read that as Fred.
654.44s: You should read that as an example of economic data sources.
660.68s: We'll go through all of them really quick
663.44s: and then we can circle back.
667.48s: Colonel says, don't shave your beard was November.
670.44s: That's also December, fun fact.
672.04s: And then January, in the February,
673.44s: March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November again.
677.04s: So it's kind of like this thing,
678.00s: there's never really a time to shave the beard
679.76s: because you just get back to November so fast.
683.92s: SSRN is for base research.
687.40s: I have videos that talk about how to use SSRN
691.40s: to understand what you're trying to do
693.60s: and what it looks like, what right looks like.
697.00s: That'll be worth going into in example
699.00s: in just a few minutes, but I wanna clarify that point.
702.52s: The probability of you going through SSRN
704.64s: and coming across some sort of like super useful
706.64s: piece of information is very low at a high level.
710.48s: At a lower level, introductory level,
712.80s: most of what you read is gonna be super useful information.
715.84s: It's going to teach you how to even analyze ideas,
719.80s: how to apply a just general scientific approach.
726.64s: Most people skip all that.
728.24s: Most people lose money because they skip all that.
730.72s: Don't skip.
731.64s: And SSRN is a great place to start.
734.16s: Think or swim, that's also where I execute.
736.32s: You'll see that on both sides of the equation, however.
740.12s: For think or swim specifically,
742.12s: there's also a ton of really good data in here.
746.08s: There's Gremlins, there's a lot of things
748.20s: that are too be desired for me, at least as a user
750.80s: of the platform for almost 20 years now.
753.40s: But I like it a lot and I think it's better
755.56s: than most other things that are out there that are free.
758.56s: On the topic of platforms,
760.76s: I do wanna talk about really quick
762.96s: some of the higher tier platforms.
766.68s: Because I've actually tried a lot of them.
769.92s: There's really, really expensive ones.
772.08s: There's things like a Bloomberg terminal icon.
775.76s: Those kinds of platforms are really cool.
779.36s: In terms of those platforms,
781.60s: generating some sort of edge for you
784.16s: as a retail trader, not really there.
787.56s: It's just reality.
788.64s: There's tons of useful information in them.
791.16s: I like them, but at no point any time in my playing
796.24s: with any of them was I like, oh, this is an absolute
800.32s: game changer.
801.76s: Now for those that don't know, one of my long-term goals
806.48s: when we grow the Patreon enough
809.20s: and just the community enough in general,
810.84s: I actually wanna get a Bloomberg terminal
812.96s: to use for research for the community.
815.92s: But they're expensive.
817.16s: It's like 20 grand a month.
818.84s: And because it doesn't really add value
821.28s: to my personal trading that much,
823.24s: I just don't cover that cost at the moment.
828.08s: So, O-Rats, unusual whales bar chart.
833.84s: Those are three tools that you see me use pretty regularly.
838.68s: First things first.
840.64s: I'm gonna fill you up for all of them.
843.16s: You should know that in my conversation with them.
845.56s: They don't ever, we don't have any conversations
848.12s: about how I talk about them, what I use them for,
851.64s: any mandate about how much I use,
853.32s: there's literally none of that.
855.36s: The way the relationships are built with all of them
858.12s: is they give me access to the platform.
860.80s: And then I have affiliate links that I share.
864.08s: It gives people a discount that want to use it
866.84s: and then I get a kickback off that.
869.44s: It's not a ton.
871.64s: It's I don't do it in any capacity
874.24s: because I'm making tons of money off of affiliate links.
876.36s: It's just not how it works for me.
878.28s: But if there tools that I actually like,
884.28s: then it's actually completely fine.
888.60s: For me to integrate it into my workflow,
891.12s: have a conversation with you guys about how I use it,
893.00s: but again, you guys should know.
894.08s: There's another tool that I'm gonna fill you up for,
895.80s: which is options Omega.
898.20s: The only reason why that one's not on this list
900.24s: is because it is very specific
903.36s: to trading, super short-term,
905.60s: that's sort of super short-term, that's dramatic.
907.56s: But it's definitely geared around
908.92s: zero DTE trading in SPX.
910.68s: That's kind of like the what it's built around,
913.16s: which is good for that use case.
914.80s: This is just a very siloed use case for most people.
918.72s: Try says, I think they will ban you
920.32s: if use a Bloomberg publicly.
922.20s: At least they did, yeah, publicly is absolutely the case.
925.80s: Again, that's the cool part about having the Patreon side
929.28s: of the community is a lot of the stuff we do
931.56s: is not public.
933.20s: And it's for small reasons like that.
935.60s: You have a little bit of leeway
937.20s: in terms of what you show and when.
938.76s: And you can still use it to generate research
942.12s: and share that.
942.96s: You'll see screenshots of Bloomberg terminals
944.92s: all over Twitter and whatnot.
946.92s: So yeah, not worried about it.
952.44s: Now, going through O-Rats and usual whales bar chart,
957.76s: I'll click through all of them.
959.36s: And then the newest one that added is not on here yet,
962.28s: but that has been added to the equation is a moon tower,
966.72s: which is I've only been teakering with this for like a week.
971.84s: So I've got nothing yet to share.
974.76s: I like the layout.
976.16s: I like a lot of the ideas are going on here,
978.60s: but it's way too early for me to say anything.
981.40s: With respect to things like bar chart, unusual whales
984.32s: and O-Rats, different story
986.20s: because I have used these for a while.
989.60s: Bar chart, I like a lot for a few key things.
993.36s: You guys will see me use it for market breadth analysis.
997.20s: They have great dashboards for pretty much all of this.
1001.12s: They have good economic calendars.
1003.08s: They have good breadth indicators.
1005.12s: They have really good scans.
1007.32s: It's actually a big part of how I get data throughout the day
1011.28s: is from different scans that this thing is firing off to me.
1016.24s: That's really a big case for this.
1019.28s: And then there's also the options in future side of stuff.
1022.36s: There is data that you can download from this if you want,
1026.52s: which is useful, but it's just really clunky to get at.
1029.76s: And I actually don't know if they,
1032.52s: I think they have an Excel plugin.
1034.04s: I don't know if they have an API.
1036.60s: That part I'm not sure is I haven't done it.
1040.56s: But like you can definitely download different data.
1042.56s: You can download options data from them
1044.20s: and all that stuff is definitely useful.
1047.16s: But the way to think about the way that I use bar chart
1050.44s: is kind of like for general market analysis at a high level.
1054.40s: Now again, to give you a peek inside the process itself,
1057.60s: I have Google Chrome setup very specifically.
1061.00s: Every time I turn on Google Chrome,
1062.80s: I get the very same number of browsers.
1065.08s: They're in a specific order for my workflow
1067.24s: on a daily basis.
1069.16s: These, this one, this one and this one.
1073.76s: So bar chart and unusual whales open every single time.
1080.24s: Moons Howard now opens because I'm experimenting with it.
1083.16s: I'm seeing how it integrates into my workflow.
1085.72s: Orats does not open right away.
1088.72s: And it's because there's specific use cases for that
1091.08s: for me, which I'll explain in a little bit.
1093.48s: But these two have opened immediately on the browser
1097.84s: and they've done that for a long time.
1100.36s: The way to think about these kinds of tools
1106.72s: is they serve different use cases.
1109.68s: And before I started doing social media,
1114.68s: making content and then developing relationships
1117.88s: with places like this, I didn't use any of these.
1121.04s: I used zero of these tools.
1123.88s: I spent all my time ever in energy building my own stuff,
1129.76s: which is where we'll talk a little bit about down here
1133.08s: in the modeling section.
1134.80s: This is where most of my work is actually done.
1139.32s: But as far as like customer facing platforms
1143.68s: that are kind of built out,
1144.76s: that kind of serve a use case,
1146.44s: that's what we're walking through now.
1148.52s: And those are just some of the things that bar chart
1151.24s: does at least in my workflow.
1153.20s: And again, as always, if you guys have questions, let me know.
1155.24s: But the biggest stuff that I'm using for sure
1157.68s: is the stock screener.
1158.88s: I like the way that this operates for sure.
1164.64s: Yeah, let me see,
1166.32s: Recess, what do you use for store-claw options data?
1168.56s: I buy it from CBO.
1171.28s: So all of the data that I use
1174.20s: like when I'm building my strategies
1175.88s: is directly from them.
1177.56s: It's super expensive,
1180.12s: but I have absolutely no questions
1183.84s: about the source of the data,
1185.88s: what it is, how it operates.
1188.16s: I have complete confidence in the data.
1191.88s: It's expensive.
1193.48s: I wanna be very, very clear.
1197.12s: So I'll show you really quick.
1203.56s: They have a shop that you can go to.
1209.72s: And in this shop, you can figure out
1213.36s: what you want to pull.
1216.52s: When you do this, you can get, again,
1221.04s: a ton of market data.
1224.68s: It's, depending on how detailed you get,
1228.92s: it gets really, really expensive,
1231.80s: especially as you're looking across
1235.08s: any sort of intraday-level options,
1238.92s: it can get really, really expensive.
1241.44s: Really, really expensive.
1243.28s: So that's one generalized data source.
1247.68s: And the data shop that they have effectively provides
1253.52s: all of the stuff here, but again, like I said,
1258.16s: it's hard for me to be like, do this
1261.64s: and it's just because it's super expensive.
1266.52s: But it's as pure data that I can find.
1271.04s: So that's what I do for historical options data.
1275.04s: Jason says, Mark, you can't have much experience
1279.44s: with it.
1280.28s: It could be fine, but yeah, I couldn't weigh in on it
1284.68s: one way or the other, I haven't really used it.
1287.76s: Try for says, you use book map and toss, not really.
1290.92s: I've tinkered with it a little bit,
1292.72s: but I don't use it for active trading in anyway.
1296.20s: Ben says, the CBOG give you a participant ID depends.
1305.44s: So that is bar chart.
1308.88s: Let's go into unusual whales.
1312.20s: unusual whales, I like this more for options,
1317.72s: flow-based trading, which I'm very hesitant
1321.00s: to use that terminology, but this is hands down
1324.00s: the best place for me to do any sort of nuanced research
1329.04s: on options and the option side of the equation.
1333.28s: A lot of times you'll see me in here using stuff like
1340.04s: their volatility tools here, I use these all the time.
1344.52s: Using stuff like the net premiums
1347.08s: to see what broader positioning looks like and where.
1350.64s: Stuff like that.
1352.24s: This is if I were to think about the top one or two tools
1359.16s: that I use, it would depend entirely
1364.28s: on what my trading style is.
1368.60s: If I'm trading more thematically and things like that,
1372.40s: I really do like bar chart.
1374.76s: If I'm trading way more actively, shorter term time frames,
1379.00s: trying to capture some type of flow,
1382.92s: then this is a better place to be.
1386.88s: But if I think about it for the context
1389.80s: of like most traders and most of the community,
1394.04s: I think this style of trading should be at the very back
1397.52s: of the queue for your learning style
1399.40s: and what you're focusing on.
1401.08s: You can make good money doing this,
1403.68s: but it is absolutely one of the most nuanced
1410.00s: one of those nuanced methodologies for trading by far.
1416.60s: There's a lot of ways to fuck it up.
1418.80s: So I don't dislike it for like just regular,
1424.00s: you know, retail traders that are trying to test
1425.92s: different things, but I definitely do not think
1428.52s: that this is the place that I would start at all.
1431.80s: So I think that's the reason why I'm trading
1433.80s: is that I'm not going to be doing this.
1437.80s: They do have good market level data,
1442.80s: but a lot of the market level data
1446.80s: isn't like the same thing that you're seeing
1451.80s: from bar chart, right?
1453.80s: So it's showing you a lot of activity
1457.80s: across the board.
1458.80s: All of this kind of stuff is useful,
1462.80s: but it's just not really the same thing,
1465.80s: especially if you're trying to get a better understanding
1469.80s: of the broad market.
1471.80s: So again, very useful, stuff like the seasonality
1475.80s: is useful, inflows outflows like all of these are useful,
1479.80s: but it doesn't generate like a consolidated snapshot
1483.80s: of market breadth in overall performance
1486.80s: like bar chart does.
1487.80s: So a bit of a difference.
1490.80s: Black Mama says,
1493.80s: do you use slash analyze market profile?
1496.80s: What do you mean by market profile?
1498.80s: If you can clarify that, then yeah, happy to explain
1502.80s: yeah, your name.
1504.80s: The other stuff that I like this for a couple things
1511.80s: within the sectors, I do like this.
1514.80s: It gives me a sense of movement over time
1519.80s: for individual sectors, which is actually kind of important to me.
1523.80s: And I actually like their heat maps a lot,
1525.80s: because you can drill down in these in a way
1527.80s: that you can't do conveniently with think or swim.
1531.80s: And you could do it over different time frames,
1533.80s: which is another big difference, because I actually like
1536.80s: the heat map that you can build in here,
1539.80s: but it only gives it to you for the day.
1542.80s: There's no like toggles for me to look at this over the last week
1546.80s: or something like that.
1547.80s: But again, the reason why emphasize that is because
1550.80s: when traders are looking at this stuff,
1553.80s: if you apply a momentum lens,
1556.80s: it's generally a better starting point
1559.80s: for most people with trading in my opinion.
1563.80s: So there's that stuff.
1565.80s: I'm trying to think if there's anything else really big.
1567.80s: This one also has an API,
1569.80s: but I have to be honest, not that familiar with it.
1572.80s: I don't use this one that much.
1574.80s: When I'm using any level of API data,
1578.80s: it's coming from O-Rats.
1580.80s: And this is like the third typical platform you guys will see me use.
1584.80s: I use it, funny enough.
1586.80s: On this screen a lot,
1588.80s: I like the information that they have here,
1591.80s: and it's exactly what I need to analyze stuff like earnings plays.
1597.80s: Because there is a lot of different details that matter to me
1606.80s: that exist in other places, but not in a convenient manner.
1609.80s: And I'll give you an example.
1611.80s: If we take a look at Apple,
1617.80s: and we look at it, we look at its earnings here.
1621.80s: This earnings tool is also useful.
1624.80s: But it's not giving me the details that I actually need,
1627.80s: unfortunately, to conduct any sort of broad level analysis.
1632.80s: These are good visuals.
1633.80s: The visuals are helpful,
1635.80s: but the visuals are just that, right?
1637.80s: Like they're visuals.
1639.80s: So because of that,
1641.80s: I can't ingest this conveniently,
1644.80s: where is this stuff I can.
1645.80s: So I like this a lot for earnings stuff.
1650.80s: I like this a lot for options,
1653.80s: chain, level analysis,
1654.80s: because they do a good job plotting the vols across the curve.
1659.80s: This is also the same thing that you see me use in here.
1663.80s: When we're looking at vol down here,
1666.80s: which we'll talk about this tool in a minute,
1668.80s: which is a question from another pro member.
1671.80s: But when I'm looking at vol here,
1673.80s: it's a similar view,
1674.80s: but it just gives me conveniently across the curve,
1677.80s: and the nominal levels, which is useful,
1679.80s: because I can visualize an entire vol surface off of this pretty easily.
1684.80s: And then it's also useful for different trade level data.
1688.80s: So what kind of trades are coming in
1692.80s: over what time frame net profile of them,
1695.80s: which is also useful?
1697.80s: So yeah,
1698.80s: those are the three that I use.
1702.80s: And like most frequently, I would say.
1705.80s: The question from the Patreon members,
1710.80s: like if I had a pick one or two,
1713.80s: what would it be?
1715.80s: And for me personally,
1717.80s: it would be unusual whales,
1719.80s: and probably all rats.
1723.80s: The reason being is all of those breadth indicators,
1728.80s: I can still get them from other places,
1731.80s: just less conveniently.
1733.80s: So I'm also full well aware that I'm in the fortunate spot
1738.80s: where I don't pay for these.
1740.80s: And if I did, you do kind of have to pick what you want to spend the money on.
1745.80s: One thing that I will say is that as you become more and more,
1752.80s: like as you pivot yourself more and more,
1755.80s: to trade at a professional level,
1758.80s: there is a cost of doing business.
1761.80s: So then there is the trade off,
1765.80s: but it's not the same.
1767.80s: Because for example,
1769.80s: let's say that you commute to your W2.
1772.80s: That commute costs money.
1774.80s: It costs you gas.
1775.80s: It costs you time.
1777.80s: It costs you mileage on your car and maintenance.
1780.80s: It costs you all of that.
1782.80s: So if you're trading for a living,
1785.80s: that cost goes away.
1788.80s: That can be reinvested into the trading business,
1792.80s: for example, that kind of stuff.
1795.80s: Blackbombs says market profile is a method
1799.80s: that organizes data on time
1803.80s: to reveal where the market finds value.
1807.80s: Think I've heard of this.
1808.80s: Let me look it up really quick.
1811.80s: Because I use volume profile as an overall indicator.
1820.80s: But I don't use the market profile.
1824.80s: You mean, yeah, okay,
1825.80s: so you're talking about individual indicators.
1827.80s: That's part of my confusion.
1829.80s: Because I've tinkered with market profiles and indicator.
1832.80s: But I don't really use that.
1834.80s: I typically use the volume profile.
1838.80s: Yeah, I see.
1841.80s: I understand now.
1843.80s: I see I see.
1846.80s: Yeah.
1848.80s: In general, blackbombitrator says it's not charts, bro.
1855.80s: All right, one sec.
1857.80s: Market profile.
1859.80s: This is what I'm looking at.
1862.80s: I took the term that you gave me market profile.
1865.80s: I put it into Google.
1867.80s: Inside Google.
1870.80s: I see using market profile.
1872.80s: I see the indicator and strategies from trading view.
1875.80s: I see the actual indicator here.
1878.80s: I like it said.
1879.80s: I've also seen this indicator coded in Think or Swim.
1883.80s: So.
1884.80s: Yes, indicator.
1886.80s: Now, if there's a different market profile that
1889.80s: refer to, happy to hear about it and happy to take a look.
1893.80s: This is just the one that I'm familiar with.
1896.80s: It just confused me because I thought you were talking not indicators.
1900.80s: When I looked at stuff, I see indicators, but you're saying not indicators.
1907.80s: Blackbombit says not.
1910.80s: BRP.
1911.80s: It's again.
1913.80s: I don't know.
1914.80s: If you can drop a link to the discord to something like specific to what you're talking about,
1919.80s: happy to take a look.
1920.80s: But again, I'm literally just using the term that you gave me.
1923.80s: So if you have a better source that describes it, happy to take a look.
1930.80s: There was another on spot gamma.
1933.80s: Yeah.
1934.80s: So let's talk about things like Gax, Dax, and whatnot.
1938.80s: I've talked to this a few times.
1941.80s: In a nutshell, it's a fun party trick.
1946.80s: It's fun to be aware of.
1948.80s: But it's effectively meaningless.
1952.80s: It doesn't mean anything.
1954.80s: And it is everything to do with the assumptions that are being made.
1960.80s: And again, this is a specific indicator.
1963.80s: Not really like a platform or a software.
1966.80s: You can get spot gamma, gamma exposure, delta exposure,
1970.80s: vana exposure.
1972.80s: You can get all of those across different platforms.
1975.80s: But it's worth talking about because it's like sweeping the retail trading community as like this new tool that's, you know, magical.
1984.80s: But the biggest thing I could tell you is that I've spent most of the indicators that I use.
1990.80s: I have spent easily thousands of hours back testing them, live testing them,
1999.80s: stress testing and I have a pretty good understanding,
2004.80s: not just of like my preference of indicators, but also a pretty good understanding of like what indicators do what and how well they do it.
2011.80s: And it's not based on like my opinion based on how I use it.
2016.80s: It is actually based on doing data analysis on them and using them.
2021.80s: What they're supposed to do and there's a lot of nuances, believe it or not.
2025.80s: There's a lot of indicators that work well with small cap,
2028.80s: mid cap, not large cap, vice versa, their seasonality to them.
2031.80s: But when you're checking for robustness, one of the big things you look at is, well, what performs consistently across across that stuff.
2039.80s: But anyways, zooming in on this specifically,
2043.80s: it's something that I'll look at more out of curiosity.
2046.80s: I actually have a live test going on in it right now.
2050.80s: But I do not, I do not assign any meaningful weight to it whatsoever.
2056.80s: I'm aware of it and that's about it.
2061.80s: The main thing to just make sure everybody's aware of what stuff like this is that if you're using Gax,
2069.80s: Dax, all of those, it makes a massive assumption that is a really, really,
2077.80s: like, just huge problem is two things.
2083.80s: The first thing is the assumption of the counterparty, which these things,
2092.80s: the first assumption is that a market maker is the counterparty for all of them.
2099.80s: Realistically speaking, it's probably not that far off.
2103.80s: So I don't actually hate it, but I also know that this is a limiting assumption,
2108.80s: because it is not accurate to a T.
2110.80s: There's probably a decent amount of width here in terms of like what percentage of this is actually market makers versus not.
2118.80s: That's the first thing. The second thing is way more important.
2121.80s: The second thing is the assumption of the book.
2124.80s: With this, the idea is that as price moves to certain levels, it will be more likely for price,
2141.80s: spot price to behave differently based on whether or whether the market is long net gamma,
2148.80s: short net gamma and at different levels.
2151.80s: The issue with this is that it assumes the portfolio is SPX,
2158.80s: where we objectively know that's not the case.
2162.80s: If you look at the portfolio of a market maker, they will have ons of individual stocks.
2171.80s: They also do not perfectly hedge.
2177.80s: What that means is there could be scenarios where let's say that they're net gamma,
2182.80s: they're getting longer and longer net gamma people are thinking of certain hedging behavior is going to happen.
2188.80s: But if on their equity portfolio, they're actually still too short gamma.
2194.80s: They might do nothing or they might even amplify the move.
2199.80s: The biggest limiting assumption here that breaks this entire thing is the fact that you have no idea what else is in their book,
2208.80s: what else their position is and it does not operate in a vacuum.
2212.80s: It is not just as price gets near SPX, they're going to have to do something in SPX.
2217.80s: How does their entire book behave?
2222.80s: Again, that's the main limiting assumption. It's a huge gap, realistically speaking. It's a huge gap.
2227.80s: So yeah, it's a fun thing to be aware of.
2231.80s: It's cool to track and it sometimes can definitely predict interesting behavior.
2237.80s: But there is absolutely no significant confidence interval before that based on the general homework, at least that I've done on it.
2247.80s: The next few things to talk about are, like I said, Fred, Edgar, and B.R. just economic data.
2256.80s: So I'll just show you Fred really quick.
2259.80s: And then you guys can explore what the others at your leisure.
2265.80s: But here's a snapshot of Fred.
2269.80s: I like Fred a lot.
2272.80s: One, you can integrate this into Excel so you can import this stuff.
2277.80s: But you literally can go through all of economic data.
2283.80s: And you can create these little dashboards.
2285.80s: I actually like these little dashboards a whole lot. I use them all the time.
2290.80s: It gives you a ton of context on what's going on.
2295.80s: So like I can look at the trend of credit card balances.
2297.80s: I can look at the link one see of loans to see the health of the consumer.
2300.80s: I can look at consumer spending.
2302.80s: I can look at how much mortgage costs as a percentage disposable income.
2307.80s: Like so on and so forth.
2308.80s: You can just, you can go through these different tools at nauseam.
2312.80s: There is a ton.
2314.80s: And like I said, there's an API and there's an add-in for Excel.
2317.80s: You can add as much as you want.
2320.80s: Sorry, you can add as much as you want to these dashboards.
2323.80s: So it's probably like one of the premier places to get economic level data.
2329.80s: The thing that I would remind people and caution people overall is.
2338.80s: Economics are really, really tricky to integrate into trading.
2344.80s: The way that I think about economics is I want to be aware of the economic regime and what kind of potential implications
2352.80s: that makes to the market.
2353.80s: But just be very, very careful with like these macro economic attempts at informed portfolio positioning again.
2362.80s: There's a lot of research out there.
2364.80s: Don't take my word for it.
2365.80s: You should look on SSRN like we talked.
2367.80s: But you can take a look at the performance of economic primed portfolios against others like stuff like momentum.
2375.80s: And you will find that the economic primed portfolios typically do not perform that well.
2381.80s: Especially relative to use market beta and stuff like that.
2385.80s: So again, information for you to be aware of, do with that, whatever you will.
2391.80s: But just know that your God is probably not in economic data in terms of getting the answers to what you want.
2399.80s: Okay.
2400.80s: Let's talk about modeling.
2402.80s: This is kind of the fun stuff in my opinion.
2406.80s: Modeling is where the research really is done.
2411.80s: This top level stuff is just for like general market research, general context.
2418.80s: This is where I'm actually looking at things and trying to identify like tradable information.
2429.80s: That is absolutely what's going on here.
2431.80s: So the good example of this is a recent thing that I shared widely.
2435.80s: So if I can find it, I'll share it again. Yeah, these.
2438.80s: So I shared versions of these. This is from Python.
2442.80s: And this is me actually looking for tradable information.
2447.80s: That's what this is.
2449.80s: The way to think about R and then Python is R is way better for broad statistical analysis.
2458.80s: And again, it's funny because I used to not spend a lot of time talking about these because I understand that the learning curve for most people is really high, but you have no excuse anymore with AI AI can walk you through step by step on how to do everything.
2475.80s: There's no reason to not have some sort of capability when it comes to using our or Python or stuff like that.
2484.80s: In general for me, Jupiter is kind of like the workhorse.
2489.80s: That's where I'm doing most of my stuff.
2492.80s: So that's where I'm in ingesting data either stuff that I'm uploading or integrating into a database and pulling from there.
2500.80s: And then I am running different kinds of ideas.
2504.80s: So I'm by s acting data.
2506.80s: I'm running back tests.
2508.80s: And that's where things get complicated, especially when you're trying to codify different systems.
2513.80s: But this is also where I first started learning some of the things that you guys hear me talk about like this selling high implied volatility rank.
2523.80s: That doesn't work that well long term.
2526.80s: Same things like.
2529.80s: Bying VIX or VXX with the expectation of market going up like there's a million things correlation analysis for pairs trading volatility behavior all of that stuff all that research has done in there.
2543.80s: And then R is really it's a statistics platform.
2547.80s: So I'm mostly and you could do like basic money, Carlos simulations stuff like that and Python it like I said it's like a Swiss army knife you can do most stuff in there.
2555.80s: But ours when you're doing way heavier lifting and doing way more detailed statistical analysis to understand things at a deeper level.
2566.80s: Think or swim gives basic modeling capabilities.
2572.80s: You can look at hockey stick diagrams so pay off diagrams, which is actually quite useful and things like that.
2582.80s: Excel and Google sheets in my opinion is like the perfect starting place and I purposely do just about everything in here with you guys.
2592.80s: And you can see like all of this is basic modeling right so in this case we're taking a look at how it is all how does term structure look inside of an individual expiration this is a simple model.
2604.80s: Same thing looking at changes in Vega I don't know what I don't know what the hell we're looking at but we're looking at something.
2610.80s: Same thing in here we're again we're looking at delta across different strikes looking at the skew of delta.
2618.80s: That's all basic modeling that can be done inside Excel Google sheets I used to do most stuff in Excel and I moved primarily to Google sheets just for the transportability it's way more user friendly on the move looking at stuff on my phone and whatnot.
2637.80s: Then stuff like PowerShell is also for like simple basic tasks but power automate helps me automate different things there's a few tools that I use to help automate another one is pipe dream is useful or automating different tasks.
2657.80s: Grock even has a thing now to help automate some levels of tasks but all of those are really designed to make what I'm doing more more efficient.
2670.80s: Black mom is says selling vix calls work most days it certainly does.
2675.80s: Most certainly does until the few days work doesn't and then it don't that's the that's the coolest part about that kind of trading especially in vol it's actually really interesting.
2689.80s: Are there any questions on what we talked about so far in terms of education or research tools before we get into the execution stuff the execution stuff should be pretty quick I think.
2701.80s: The the meat and potatoes really is in this research section I think by far this is generally where most of the work is going down in the broader process.
2716.80s: While you guys are drumming up anything I'll continue on execution.
2722.80s: Let's take a look at the execution side of stuff this is where I'm actually doing things so as usual I cite the trading plan that is absolutely something that you should have in the beginning.
2738.80s: I'm very transparent about this I do not reference my trading plan before I place a trade more often than not.
2745.80s: I normally at this point use my trading plan to track what I'm doing with the strategy and how the strategy is evolving.
2753.80s: But I'm not like in there consulting before I place a trade now if you're new.
2759.80s: It's really useful to do something like that and it's really to slow you down and to make sure that you're not making stupid mistakes because you're going too fast in overlooking stuff.
2773.80s: This is common I see this actually in the pro plus workshops we had an example not that long ago where we were doing a trade build exercise and I do it literally on a timer.
2784.80s: The reason why I do it on a timer is to add a tiny little bit of stress but it's also to stress test a process.
2794.80s: You shouldn't take that long to form out a trade if you move through a process efficiently that's the whole point of having a good process.
2802.80s: So if your process has cracks then that time becomes a constraint kind of like a looming overhead if you have a good process it doesn't even matter.
2811.80s: So you're going to be done pretty damn fast so anyways in there somebody was looking at selling some sort of premium I want to say puts or something.
2820.80s: And during the review I asked someone was like hey this thing you know has earnings coming up was that you purposely trying to gain exposure to earnings ball and they were like oh no I missed that.
2829.80s: It's a perfect perfect example of how using a plan with a strategy outline can slow you down enough to make sure that you're not making little mistakes like that.
2841.80s: Now again in that context I expect those mistakes to happen that's the whole point of that workshop it's not a test it's a repetition.
2848.80s: But it's a really really good example of a incomplete process and something that needs a little bit of tightening behind it is all.
2859.80s: The portfolio level dashboard and the trade log.
2863.80s: What I'm doing here is taking a bunch of individual strategies and then I bubble it up to an overview which again the pro members you guys have access to a very bare bones template it is is bare bones is a gets but it's designed to give you at least the idea of what this thing looks like so.
2887.80s: Here's how I do it.
2890.80s: I would have.
2893.80s: Vision these as different tabs.
2897.80s: Right so we'll have a section of tabs.
2900.80s: Going this way.
2902.80s: In the first tab I have a C2 C tab this is the portfolio level view and I'll explain that in a second after that I have all of the individual.
2916.80s: Strategy tabs so a good example of that is short earnings release.
2924.80s: Vol.
2925.80s: Another one could be.
2927.80s: One month momentum.
2931.80s: Another one is covered strangles another one is ratio call diagonals.
2935.80s: Another one is ratio put diagonals and so on and so forth.
2939.80s: So each of these strategies is its own tab.
2945.80s: And then what I do.
2948.80s: Is I bubble up on the top of each of these tabs at the top like up here.
2954.80s: I have portfolio I have like strategy levels statistics that I bubble up at the top or each strategy.
2961.80s: Then what I do is I pull from those strategy levels statistics into my C2 C tab which the to military term for.
2968.80s: The military term for command and control it's where everything generally sets.
2974.80s: In there is where I'm tracking portfolio level metrics and then summaries statistics for each individual strategy.
2982.80s: The entire purpose for doing all of this is to give me better fidelity on what the fuck I'm doing.
2991.80s: A good example of that is here.
2995.80s: So this is my end of month after action review.
3000.80s: This is like a snapshot of what I share with the community.
3004.80s: And this is like a very very very high level.
3007.80s: I end up breaking this down into much more detail.
3010.80s: But for example, when I'm tracking my portfolio level metrics.
3015.80s: And I can see that my core allocation is returning 13.8% speculative of 65.1.
3021.80s: That doesn't like happen overnight.
3023.80s: I can see this happening throughout the year and I can see that the core allocation is performing moderately slow.
3031.80s: Compared to what I'm identifying in terms of opportunities.
3035.80s: That immediately directs my attention.
3038.80s: Then what I'm doing is I'm looking inside my speculative strategies and I'm saying what's working.
3047.80s: So for example, I did not spend much time this year trading a bunch of speculative futures.
3052.80s: There were some really good plays that I had.
3055.80s: But very few very low volume in general.
3060.80s: And most of the time was divided to trading speculative vault because that was hitting this year hard.
3067.80s: There are other periods where speculative vault is absolutely crushing me.
3072.80s: Say you go through too bad earning season.
3075.80s: Second happen.
3076.80s: If that happens, then I'm going to look at what else I'm doing is working.
3081.80s: And then I'm going to go extract and try to lean into the stuff that's having success in the current market regime.
3088.80s: So for all of these, I have a bunch of individual metrics that I track portfolio level and strategy level stats.
3095.80s: The way to think about these, these are kind of like overarching profit mechanism level.
3101.80s: This isn't really strategy level because in speculative vault, there's 12 different strategies that live in speculative vault.
3110.80s: That's just like the top level profit mechanism that I'm attempting to attack there, but it's a good example of using this information to make trading decisions.
3120.80s: But this is the general layout that I'm using in the log so that I can track stuff and ultimately make informed decisions.
3129.80s: Then obviously you need a broker to execute through and I still use thinker swim, which is through Schwab.
3137.80s: And then I also obviously need places to do it.
3141.80s: So I have the desktop computer.
3144.80s: I ended up getting that because of YouTube and streaming and stuff, not because I needed it for trading.
3149.80s: Although I did start needing it to store market data.
3154.80s: I didn't want to pay like a cloud service for a while.
3158.80s: And then laptop, that's when I'm kind of unlike the mobile workstation you guys will hear me refer to that on some of the streams.
3165.80s: And the mobile workstation is still like the base laptop, which is top end G14.
3172.80s: And then I still use a couple screens.
3176.80s: Now it depends on if I'm planning on doing like any actual work.
3180.80s: So like for example, this last trip to Alaska, I only brought one screen.
3187.80s: And this next trip to Alaska, the end of this month, I probably won't even bring an additional screen because at that point most of my trading activity will be broadly wound down for the year.
3200.80s: And the AAR process will be about done.
3204.80s: So at that point, I don't need the extra screens or anything like that.
3208.80s: And then obviously just cell phone, not just to do stuff on the phone and track and trade, but also to log stuff as I'm doing.
3218.80s: Then for optimization, it's literally using the log, the strategy outlines and iterating on those.
3226.80s: And then the AAR process outline, which you guys all have.
3233.80s: These are like, this is pretty much it.
3236.80s: There are some nuances across the board here, but this is effectively what goes into the operation.
3245.80s: It's not that crazy.
3248.80s: If you guys have any questions on any of these, let me know.
3252.80s: And what I'm going to do in the meantime for the other pro members, I want to go back because they had a couple questions on how I use some of these specific tools.
3262.80s: So one of the first ones is reading this options statistics, which is exactly what it sounds like.
3270.80s: All this is doing is giving you data on what happened today.
3275.80s: Like that's pretty much it.
3276.80s: So it's giving you stuff like put call ratios relative volume ratios.
3281.80s: That's what they call the sizzle index.
3283.80s: Like how much stuff is getting volume compared to longer term averages.
3287.80s: This is breaking down of the calls and the puts and the total options that traded today.
3293.80s: Where did they transact?
3295.80s: Did they transact at the bid at the offer or somewhere in between?
3299.80s: And then this down here breaks down different deltas in terms of what deltas were the options transacting at.
3308.80s: That kind of stuff is useful information to understand if people are playing at the tails going in the money.
3314.80s: That kind of stuff.
3315.80s: So that's pretty much all it is.
3317.80s: Then the left hand side is giving just underlying and underlying options level data.
3324.80s: So what is the total range for vol?
3328.80s: Let for the last 52 weeks.
3331.80s: It gives you an IV percentile a reminder on think or swim.
3336.80s: This is actually IV rank is not IV percentile.
3340.80s: This is IV rank.
3342.80s: They I've talked to them about it.
3343.80s: They just haven't changed it.
3344.80s: I don't think they're gonna but it's not IV percentile.
3348.80s: It's IV rank.
3350.80s: Then it gives you the ranges for historic volatility.
3355.80s: The current historic volatility percentile current implied vol.
3359.80s: And then whatever the current VWOP is, which is used for understanding where market larger market constituents are likely to transact that, which is the the broader point.
3373.80s: Now for the next thing they were asking which was the OI plots.
3378.80s: The open interest plots literally tells you what strike prices at what density people are at.
3386.80s: That's all.
3387.80s: So this is taking the calls and the puts separately.
3390.80s: It's telling you across the entire options chain.
3393.80s: What the current total call OI is, what the total put OI is again across all of the terms.
3399.80s: And then it's giving you the current open interest for individual strikes and individual explorations.
3407.80s: That's all this is.
3409.80s: So for example, this one here, the 16 Jan 26 to 70s has 86,000 and 80 open interest.
3417.80s: So the colors represent different expressions.
3420.80s: The higher up on the Y axis, the more OI there is.
3426.80s: And that's pretty much it.
3427.80s: So those kind of tools are useful for understanding like positioning.
3435.80s: And I use this a lot because it's in the platform that I'm trading, but I typically prefer unusual whales just because I like the way that their data is laid out.
3448.80s: All right.
3450.80s: What questions do you guys have?
3453.80s: What should we discuss?
3455.80s: Are there any of these that you want to go into a little bit more detail on like I was saying for the pro members?
3460.80s: If there's a specific one that you want to spend time like doing a deep dive and actually using it to like find trades and stuff we can absolutely do that.
3469.80s: But the main purpose for this one, especially like being open to everybody, it's to just give you an overview of the ecosystem.
3476.80s: Because I think it's useful, it's something I would want to know.
3479.80s: And I think hopefully it leaves gives people some ideas.
3484.80s: Zaddy says, do you think options can improve my love life? Absolutely.
3489.80s: Options can improve your love life because you'll learn to be wrong with grace and having money helps.
3497.80s: The largest, like the largest source of arguments for couples is money.
3504.80s: So if you have an agree justly significant amount of money, there are no money arguments.
3512.80s: They don't really come up because it doesn't matter. So that's huge.
3518.80s: TCM says have you seen unusual whales earnings tab in how it compares to orats? Yeah.
3524.80s: I think we've actually used the unusual whales earnings tab together.
3529.80s: I don't like it as much as O rats. It's not it's not like awful, but I don't like it as much.
3535.80s: And I'll show you why.
3539.80s: If we go in here a few things that I don't like.
3545.80s: It's primarily the specific data that I need actually isn't here conveniently.
3553.80s: And there's also the function of I can't copy it, which is super annoying.
3560.80s: So if you're doing like some sort of manual work around, like I was doing for the pro-plus members when we're doing the analysis,
3568.80s: you can't, you can't like actually measure the stuff as effectively.
3574.80s: And I don't totally love the pricing that it gives you.
3581.80s: Right. So the average move here is good, but what would be even more important is the average move relative to the implied move.
3592.80s: Right. So like the average move is useful, but it like this data plotted out would be more useful.
3600.80s: So yeah, definitely not bad, but I just prefer orats for a couple really small reasons, but small workflow style reasons.
3610.80s: Kirk says, how is the core percent return over the past three years?
3615.80s: Are a majority of returns from speculative bucket for the past three years?
3619.80s: Absolutely majority of speculative for sure.
3621.80s: Absolutely, but as I've talked about, including this year, this year and the last two years have hands down been my best trading years by far.
3634.80s: And the way that the core is built is not really to pursue the top line returns.
3643.80s: It's supposed to be super, super consistent.
3646.80s: And it's actually delivering perfectly on that, especially with how Bitcoin is doing and how game stop is doing.
3654.80s: If I look at what the coverage triangle is in so far on the year and how those are doing a bunch of them will not a bunch, but two thirds of them are struggling significantly.
3665.80s: And yet it's still providing like pretty strong returns.
3669.80s: So yeah, it's definitely built a different purpose, but the the last three years have been absolutely anomalous in terms of overall performance for me.
3680.80s: And I actually talked about that a little bit with ShreeJ on the latest episode of the outlier trading podcast unplugged, which should come out next Thursday.
3691.80s: It'll be out next Thursday.
3693.80s: And I think it comes down to a lot of factors, which you guys will see in that podcast a little bit.
3703.80s: Try for us as I can probably check.
3705.80s: Do you have any videos on how you set up your charts, timeframes, indicators?
3709.80s: I think so. I'm pretty sure.
3712.80s: I think if you go to my channel, you just type in like technical analysis, I think you'll see something, but that's another one that we can do.
3719.80s: The chart itself really it looks like a lot, but it's it's genuinely, really simple.
3725.80s: The way that I think about timeframes is I want to look at the relevant time frame for what I'm trading.
3731.80s: I always like to start zoomed out in zoom in.
3734.80s: So what that means is if I'm looking at something that I don't have a lot of context on intuitively, I'm always going to start zoomed out like a lot a whole lot.
3744.80s: To give me a general idea of what this thing does over long term. The reason for that is there's a lot of names that you'll find where like in the near term it's doing really, really well.
3753.80s: Seems like it's crushing it up hundreds of percent.
3756.80s: But then when you go back really long, you realize that it's still down over 50 percent from where it was, which always begs the question like what the fuck happened.
3764.80s: That's why I do that more frequently than not.
3767.80s: And then generally speaking, I live in like this six month three months timeframes.
3773.80s: And the six month is just because it's a good momentum factor test.
3779.80s: And then three month is because it's one level up from a lot of my trading windows, which is you know anywhere from like two to six weeks something like that.
3789.80s: That on less than doing like intraday stuff if it's intraday, then I'll go there.
3793.80s: But as far as indicators, I just have all level stuff up here. So this is giving me implied wall stats and then also realized wall stats, which I just realized actually need to modify this a little bit.
3807.80s: I need to add the IV high, the IV low, the IV P high and the IV P low.
3817.80s: Well, that would be stupid because that's automatically going to be 100.
3821.80s: So I actually would like to add the gross numbers here that would be good.
3827.80s: The ranges, so that's price performance. So it gives me summary level price performance data.
3833.80s: This gives me volatility level data from ADR, ATR across different timeframes.
3839.80s: Then I have a call ratio realistically. I don't need that one that much. I was using it for another purpose.
3845.80s: Down here, I have a custom coded volatility.
3851.80s: Or I'm sorry, volume plot.
3853.80s: And it's because it splits the bars into buy and sell volume on the day.
3857.80s: I had gives me just a better understanding of what happened.
3860.80s: And then I have two moving averages for volume and volume averages. So a short term five period a long term 20 period.
3868.80s: I guess I missed a couple things in the upper chart. Sorry, I'll go back up. These are just moving averages.
3872.80s: So I have a really short term 10. Sometimes it'll go down to five if I'm trading really short term.
3878.80s: But 10, 20, 50, and then a couple others longer term.
3882.80s: And then this is volume profile. We were actually talking a little bit about this before with the conversation on, you know, market market profile volume profile.
3890.80s: But I typically prefer volume profile. So that's what this is.
3896.80s: Then down here is really more of just like a personal interest. This is not useful for trading in my opinion. But this is what's called a price spike plot.
3907.80s: This is giving me a rolling 20 period average.
3913.80s: And then I'm tracking the sigma moves of each day relative.
3918.80s: So for example, I can see here this day was a 1.9 standard deviation move to the upside compared to its 20 period rolling average like that kind of thing.
3929.80s: And then this is an RSI the RSI is very specific settings because I've done a insane amount of research on that between the EMA, but this is just an RSI with an EMA.
3942.80s: And then I have some auto correlation stats which are really useful for like continuation analysis.
3949.80s: These are just wall plots implied wall realize wall VRP for two different time frames plotted.
3957.80s: And then down here is not specific to any individual stock. This is a breath indicator, which is a custom created net highs lows.
3969.80s: So it's a combined histogram of NASDAQ in New York stock exchange. That's all. So it looks like a lot but at least in my mind it actually isn't that much.
3980.80s: It's specifically built to be.
3986.80s: It's specifically built to be like really utilitarian across stuff.
3993.80s: All right.
3995.80s: Kirk says would it be better to develop speculative strategies more because they have a higher ceiling of returns before core.
4002.80s: It's a great question.
4005.80s: I think that depends entirely on the trader in my opinion, no, but that has everything to do with my risk of version just being completely honest with you.
4014.80s: I was playing a video game not that long ago called Arc Raiders with my brother and my buddy.
4020.80s: And I noticed some of my risk of version even coming through in a fucking video game where we're running around like a bunch of banshee's came across some stuff.
4031.80s: And then when we got the stuff in my mind, I was just like, yo, I want to take this stuff and I want to leave, right?
4037.80s: Because you can like leave the individual match so you don't lose your shit if you die in there.
4042.80s: And then like as I heard myself having that thought process, I was just like, bitch, this is a fucking online video game with fake internet shit.
4052.80s: Like who gives a flying fuck?
4055.80s: But that just gives you a glimpse into my risk of version when it comes to stuff like that.
4062.80s: The funniest part is is like I'm really not risk of course in general.
4066.80s: I'm very pragmatic when it comes to risk, but I'm very aware of myself, especially when it comes to resources.
4076.80s: I'm very risk of versus when it comes to resources, which was also reinforced really by the military because the military is the whole, you know, one is none two is one kind of thing.
4088.80s: Having backups and redundancies and if you don't have a backup, you're unprepared and stuff like that.
4094.80s: And the thing is all of that coming back to a market sense, the way that I built my core allocation was to give me something stable and reliable.
4103.80s: So that even if the speculative stuff didn't work out or even if I massively fucked it up, I should still have a dampening factor in the core allocation.
4114.80s: That's the way I look at it.
4116.80s: That I think about at least is the speculative allocation that I've run never needs that much money.
4122.80s: So what that means is the core allocation is actually punching way above its weight in terms of their returns based on the capital that I'm using for it.
4131.80s: But it's very, very consistent. So that's the main thing.
4134.80s: But that all being said, it really does come down to the trader.
4137.80s: Like if a trader feels like they have really, really good speculative strategies and they want to start with those.
4142.80s: I think that can be completely fine. It could be. It's not what I would do for those reasons.
4148.80s: I always wanted to have something that was working. I could count on working would consistently work and then you know venture off and play with other stuff.
4158.80s: That all said.
4160.80s: The other thing I would keep in mind is that I don't really look at them massively in a vacuum.
4168.80s: Because even when I was trading and researching or finding my core allocation, I was always still exploring speculative ideas.
4176.80s: And speculative approaches are a massive part of what I do.
4181.80s: And they've been an important part of what I do longer term anyways, even in terms of like what it informs me of in the market, right?
4190.80s: You're way more connected to the market through that stuff.
4193.80s: So really long-winded answer, but there's a ton of nuance that goes into it. And it all genuinely does boil down to it depends on what the traders trying to accomplish for me.
4207.80s: So for simple summary answer of absolutely not for me personally, it would be core first core shouldn't take that long to dial in.
4217.80s: If you're looking at it hard.
4219.80s: And then then it's you have something that should work well in most market conditions can survive almost all market conditions pretty robust.
4231.80s: And then I would play with the other stuff.
4234.80s: That's how I think about it.
4238.80s: Oh, so none of us says, is there something you do differently in the last three years or you'll explain it in the upcoming video.
4246.80s: It's in the upcoming video for sure.
4248.80s: The summary of it is operationally not a ton in terms of what I was doing differently, but implementation was quite different.
4264.80s: So we'll go into it there.
4266.80s: Ben says what's your zero to T set up look like zero DTE is actually more vault driven than anything. So I have a couple short term charts on my upper screen that I use to track shorter term vault and time shorter term entries.
4282.80s: And then I actually have a dashboard that I built in my trade log actually for zero DTE specifically. So the way that the dashboard is built is at the top.
4292.80s: I have specifics statistics for that day and that time that I'm looking to enter and then down below is where the trade log itself is where the individuals year to E trades live.
4303.80s: And then off to the right is the performance level data for the zero DTE's that's one of the one of the nuances in the strategy in the strategy logs in the in the trade log because most of them I have the summary level statistics right above the log.
4325.80s: But that one's a little bit different. I kind of have like that dashboard front and center because that's what I'm consulting pretty much before I enter on on anything for sure.
4338.80s: Kirk says so the total return for speculative is closer to hold on I get us low down the total return for speculative is closer to core.
4349.80s: That then percent return the amount of capital all allocated towards each trading strategy is different.
4360.80s: No, no, the total return for speculative is well, it also depends on the time frame, but the total return for speculative is more.
4370.80s: A lot of the speculative stuff not all of it, but a lot of the speculative stuff.
4375.80s: Is asymmetric in nature. What I was saying before is it just doesn't necessarily need as much capital as something like a coverage triangle, which is I mean the nature for most other strategies breaks you're not cash securing the puts, but in my approach that's the.
4395.80s: That's why those tend to be a little more cash intensive the good part though is I still double dip with the covered triangle.
4405.80s: That's always done via like I've explained in a couple of other videos via box spreads so if I'm selling puts that are cash securing something the cash doesn't just sit in the account cash goes into a box spread that's timed to de-conflict.
4422.80s: From the expiration or any expected turbulence of those options and then that box spread generally speaking will earn me a premium over the current risk rewrite and it can be like a decent premium I'll tell you right now with some of the more recent ones were.
4444.80s: So some of the more recent box spreads the premium over.
4452.80s: The risk free rate.
4458.80s: Is hold on to extend this.
4466.80s: The premium over the risk free rate is like probably average three quarter of a point to a point.
4475.80s: Yeah, like I think that's probably a fair.
4480.80s: A fair general average to apply to it.
4483.80s: But it's a decent amount of money, especially over the longer run to yeah.
4489.80s: That's generally how that rolls.
4494.80s: Ben says maybe I'm going to submit some misunderstood you don't actually have the price chart for zero d to eat up no I do.
4501.80s: I like I said I have like two or three different charts actually for zero d to eat on different aggregate timeframes but those are just on the the upper the upper screen on those I use different indicators from like short term wall price spikes.
4519.80s: Recent price move data ADR.
4523.80s: Specific ranges that I used to sample ball expected moves stuff like that.
4531.80s: Ben says okay I thought you were saying vol charts now it's not just vol charts it's just a lot of all that's the the bulk of the decision cycle for that kind of stuff but for I'm not like looking at price.
4544.80s: I'm saying like do I think it's going to go up or down like literally at all the the only reason I'm looking at the price charts is because it gives me important data because some of the scripts that I have that tell me sample periods that inform my positioning.
4563.80s: That's all.
4567.80s: All right gang well I hope the conversations useful if you guys have any questions as always let me know tomorrow we have the beginner lab.
4576.80s: I haven't quite figured out what I want to talk about there just yet but you already know it'll start with a quiz and then we'll get into whatever the topic of the day is that pops up.
4585.80s: We'll see we'll see what spurs into my brain but if you guys anything you can always hit me up in the discord being out there.
4593.80s: See you later.
