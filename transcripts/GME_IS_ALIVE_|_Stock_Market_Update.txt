0.72s: what's up ape outliers today is a video
3.56s: specifically for you it's all about
6.20s: GameStop because I mean we got a breath
9.96s: of fresh air we got a little bit of
11.32s: movement going on so obviously we have
13.48s: to dedicate all of our effort into
15.72s: analizing what's going on because man am
18.36s: I stoked to see these two consecutive
20.60s: back-to-back days today up over 8% in an
23.44s: individual day which again for GameStop
26.48s: got to keep it a buck that's on the
27.96s: smaller side but I I'll take take it I
30.48s: will 100% take it right now cuz if we
33.28s: took a look at the 5day average daily
35.04s: range at 6% the 20 days 4% so I mean
38.52s: this is even outperforming the average
40.32s: true ranges intraday so something is
42.68s: going on here so let's figure out kind
45.44s: of what's Happening Here the first thing
47.52s: that I have to point out is take a look
50.48s: at that volume
53.00s: 15.5 million shares that is against the
57.32s: 20-day average of 5.7 in the 5-day
61.20s: average of eight which includes this
64.20s: other outsized day yesterday so it looks
70.04s: like there's a bit of heat coming into
73.00s: this and again if I squish this all the
75.00s: way down I can see the volume bar right
77.72s: there so it's really nice to be able to
79.36s: see it poking up because it's competing
81.16s: with all these giant volume bars from
83.12s: the previous squeeze and we can see it
85.12s: though so I am very happy about that the
90.00s: next thing we have to take a look at is
92.24s: the kind of price movement that we're
93.96s: seeing because if I zoom this in so that
97.96s: we can take a little bit of a closer
99.36s: look take a look at what percentage of
101.80s: that volume today is buy volume
105.92s: 97% so we get this massive increase in
108.88s: volume take a look the one day relative
110.92s: volume is up 50% over 5 days 28 283
116.28s: growth 10 days 327 like big volume
120.12s: expansion over these trailing time
122.40s: frames and the bulk of it today was buy
125.48s: volume which is cool the other thing I'm
127.24s: really really happy about is I normally
129.72s: see you know the disenfranchised Apes
132.04s: rightfully so it's been a long long path
134.04s: for y'all but I know most of them think
137.08s: that the market makers are just going to
138.88s: not let price go anywhere but it very
140.80s: clearly did break above 23 today and it
142.92s: held it right so there was no
145.84s: suppression below max pay I think people
147.84s: were quoting Max Payne at 21 which again
150.08s: I remind you max pain moves as the day
152.08s: moves it's not a static figure but
154.24s: nonetheless it didn't matter right the
156.28s: the market was still bit up enough that
158.88s: it just did not care so what what's
161.88s: going on in here well it's tough to say
165.24s: now if we take a look at the open
166.72s: interest though this is also getting
169.56s: interesting because the put oi is
171.96s: 294,000 and we now have 621,000
176.28s: calls that's getting spicy this is now
180.04s: getting to a point where it starts
182.24s: looking more and more like there's that
184.44s: really bullish positioning that we've
186.08s: seen historically now I want to be very
189.68s: clear this is a near-term change I don't
193.28s: know what this means and the last thing
195.12s: I would want to do is get a bunch of
196.52s: people's hopes up that there's some sort
198.68s: of impending move because I don't know
201.04s: but what I do know is over the last
203.84s: couple days just the last two days we
206.56s: went from 20 A2 and we just closed at 23
210.76s: so we've made a decent move just over
212.92s: these past two days and I can see the
216.04s: volume in these options starting to
219.12s: build and the oi is building out if we
221.40s: take a look at the volume today it was
222.76s: 316,000 calls against 54,000 puts
226.20s: massive skew and we can see that this is
228.64s: a little bit of a shotgun blast because
230.80s: we see a bunch of these 30 augs trading
232.96s: which is probably people taking their
234.32s: trades down today on expiration and
236.36s: moving them out a week to either six the
239.36s: other thing that you'll see here is
241.52s: there's this 20ep expiration which is
245.48s: starting to build out the next primary
247.48s: expiration cycle so we're still very
250.24s: front centered but it's not supremely
253.12s: just six step because we see 13 step in
256.40s: here we see 20 step here so people are
258.80s: building out into multiple expirations
261.48s: of the volume we saw today
264.12s: 39% was at the offer or above on the
267.32s: call side so people buying and then 30
269.72s: 35% was at the bid or below on the put
271.68s: side people selling so that's a bullish
273.56s: configuration between these
275.36s: transactions now a couple things really
279.20s: popped out to me today specifically the
282.72s: first thing is we had almost 2800 of
286.92s: these 18 Ox go through smaller size
289.84s: nothing you know that I thought too much
292.56s: about these however I think differently
296.76s: about so you can tell that we have this
300.24s: one contract here this one lot not a one
303.88s: lot sorry this one line where we have
307.00s: almost
307.88s: 2,000 of these 21 calls in 20 seep at
313.32s: $3.30 that's not a small trade and if we
316.44s: take a look on unusual whales for those
318.88s: that prefer the visualization here
320.88s: that's
321.72s: $660,000 in an individual trade that's
325.72s: not small that is unequivocally exciting
329.12s: to me because again you can't there's
332.64s: not a lot of retail traders that can
334.60s: move at that size so I don't know who it
339.00s: is I genuinely have no idea but when I
341.84s: look at the strike this doesn't look
344.84s: like what I've seen roaring Kitty do
347.24s: previously typically it seems like he
349.28s: likes to be a little bit out of the
351.12s: money and I'm just using references from
352.84s: Super stun on his or Not superst Sorry
355.72s: from his individual account on Reddit to
359.04s: see what his pre previous options trades
360.76s: have looked like to kind of create a bit
362.08s: of a fingerprint for him so this doesn't
364.92s: fall in line with hiso but that's not to
367.32s: say it couldn't be him but the other
368.88s: thing that's worth mentioning is
370.92s: although he's a super rich not a cat as
374.28s: per his um recent filing with Chewy that
376.76s: he made clear that he's not a cat he's
379.04s: not the only dude with a ton of money
381.48s: he's one of them but he's not the only
383.16s: one so there are other conceivable
385.52s: people or entities that can put on
387.28s: trades in this size now it always gets
389.56s: it's interesting CU you're like well how
391.00s: many of those entities are also
392.52s: interested in about one month to
396.00s: expiration options which is his
398.28s: fingerprint most of the options I've
400.12s: seen him trade are about a month they're
402.92s: not typically in the money so I'm not so
406.60s: sure hard to make heads or tals of it
408.84s: but let's take a look at these 21 calls
410.92s: and 20 SE and why would we go in the
413.56s: money well it's pretty simple because if
416.28s: you take a look at these options they're
417.72s: a 73 Delta that's what this indicates
420.80s: over here so what that tells me is that
423.24s: for every $1 move in GameStop these will
426.40s: move 73 c as compared to the standard if
431.04s: you go further out of the money and
433.32s: let's say you're looking at like these
434.36s: 29s and these 29s or a 29 Delta so that
437.76s: means that if GameStop moves $1 you see
440.28s: 29 cents in these so why would we go in
443.20s: the money versus out of the money well I
445.08s: have a video that goes super deep into
446.88s: detail I'll link to that below but the
448.88s: cliffnotes version version is if you're
450.80s: not expecting as big of a move or if you
455.00s: don't care about your ability to
456.96s: compound as much as the gross dollar
459.68s: return you'll make good money here on a
462.92s: smaller move now you'll notice that
464.76s: these are more expensive so if we have
467.24s: the scenario that you put on the same
469.08s: size position meaning one of these costs
472.80s: let's just call it 350 bucks if you go
475.08s: out to here to the 29's let's just call
476.80s: it $100 it's not I'm just making the
479.08s: math easy for me you could put on three
481.48s: here to every one you can put on here so
484.48s: if you put on three of these now you
487.20s: have the equivalent of like 90 Deltas
489.56s: for that $1 move but you're going to be
492.60s: decaying away super super fast and if
495.72s: you don't get a big move the essentially
499.00s: the goal poost the starting point moves
500.52s: further and further behind you so it's
502.28s: harder to make money so the long story
504.12s: short is why would we go in the money
506.40s: lower Theta Decay and you make more
508.88s: money if it's a smaller move if it's not
511.92s: a smaller move you still can make a
513.44s: bunch of money on these you're just not
515.72s: going to compound as much as you would
517.84s: being a little further out of the money
519.64s: so we have to wait and see again I have
522.16s: no idea but I'm just really excited to
524.44s: see this activity picking up because we
526.08s: can see 7,000 traded at these
530.64s: 25s and I see 9,000 out here at the 30s
536.00s: and in here at the 21s we can see
538.00s: essentially this almost this entire
539.84s: volume today was from that one trade
542.60s: right because this one trade is
544.64s: $19.99 so this is one person or one
548.04s: entity I don't know if it's a person
549.84s: that's building a position out because
551.12s: if we take a look at the oi it's only
553.56s: 1224 and the ad over yesterday was only
556.36s: 1 125 so these are really interesting to
559.08s: me for the gme live stream tomorrow at
562.48s: 5:00 P p.m. Pacific time come hang out
564.04s: share it with your friends because
565.32s: hopefully it's a two-way session where I
566.92s: can learn from you and I can walk
568.60s: through options and maybe share some of
570.20s: my experience with you but I want to go
573.40s: way deeper into detail on these and see
575.96s: what we can dig up as likely
579.00s: contributors because the other thing we
580.92s: have to acknowledge is that earnings is
582.72s: right before this on 13 September so
585.60s: part of this is an earnings play
587.12s: although it's not a standard options
588.68s: earnings play which would happen in 13
590.60s: step you typically try to be in the
592.12s: expiration of earnings because they
594.28s: bought options by going a little further
596.44s: out the IV contraction that tends to
599.08s: happen and after earnings will affect
601.08s: them less and if there's a big move if
604.16s: they're expecting a big move which again
606.32s: I don't know why you would put on a
608.28s: $660,000
609.96s: position right after earnings unless
612.28s: you're expecting a move or maybe a guide
614.32s: up into earnings regardless of that
617.12s: scenario this is a great choice to
620.44s: decrease some of your sensitivity to the
622.12s: earnings release itself but stay
623.72s: sensitive to the price movements while
625.48s: keeping it relatively on the cheap so
628.92s: FAS fasinating trade that got put on in
631.08s: here I'm really really eager to see how
633.24s: this pans out and how this works out
635.08s: over the next week as we get closer and
636.80s: closer into earnings so that wraps me up
639.20s: for today later today we obviously have
641.48s: the outlier options trading for
643.76s: beginners it's a live stream at 5 p.m.
645.64s: you come hang out talk about options
647.04s: learn a little bit and uh tomorrow we'll
649.60s: get way deeper into detail here but I am
651.72s: elated to see some activity a breath of
654.32s: fresh air coming on in here in GameStop
656.08s: we're seeing more contracts trading
658.28s: above 100,000 right so a couple days ago
660.64s: it was like two or three now this is
663.04s: starting to expand further out with one
665.88s: obviously coming in really close to
669.00s: three4 of a million dollars
671.48s: so fanastic it's what we like to see out
674.84s: here some life so as always let me know
678.08s: if there's anything you want me to take
679.16s: a look at being an outlier I'll see you
680.72s: guys later
