0.00s: think or swim. It's a huge
2.52s: platform for a lot of people.
3.56s: It's overwhelming. I know it
4.80s: was from me when I first
5.80s: started, but I want to walk you
7.20s: through the platform. I started
8.76s: trading on it back in 2007 when
10.40s: I first started trading, so I
11.80s: have had over 16 years on it.
13.60s: I've gone to a bunch of different
15.40s: webinars on it. I even participate
17.40s: in some of the alphas for new
18.80s: features that they're releasing
20.20s: because I like it overall. It's
21.60s: pretty robust. So I want to walk
22.80s: you through two things. The first
24.00s: thing, some general ins and outs,
25.80s: how I like to set it up, stuff
27.00s: like that. And then at the end of
28.80s: the video, I want to go through
30.20s: how I use the chart side of the
32.40s: program because it's really
33.60s: powerful. And there's a lot you
35.00s: could do with it. So what's up
36.80s: everybody? Eric here. We'll come
37.80s: back to all the outliers in a
39.30s: shout out to the Patreon family.
41.00s: You guys make videos like this
42.10s: possible. So thank you so much
43.30s: for the support. Let's get right
44.80s: to it. So here we go. We're going
46.20s: to start from the trade tab. And
48.00s: you'll notice that we have these
49.30s: different sub tabs. I'm not going
50.60s: to go through everything. Think
52.80s: or swim actually is a really
54.00s: comprehensive library. So if you
55.80s: are completely new to the software,
57.60s: I'm not the right to guide a
58.60s: start with. Definitely check
59.80s: their stuff out first. I'm going
61.50s: to be going through some of the
62.70s: preferred things that I like to
64.20s: include. Okay. That aside in the
67.50s: trade grid. A lot of people don't
69.00s: even know this exists. It's
70.40s: underneath the underlying drop
72.00s: down. So if I close all these
73.20s: down, you can kind of see what
75.60s: choices are available. The
76.70s: underlying is just typical details
79.80s: about the underlying itself. You
81.00s: can customize some of this
82.00s: actually. And then the trade
83.50s: grid. I like this because you can
84.80s: actually drop level to data. You
87.00s: can also drop the order book
88.40s: depending on the product,
89.40s: stuff like that, which I
90.20s: actually think is really cool. Then
92.10s: for the options chains, let's
93.90s: talk about this. I like to set up
95.90s: all these different columns. You'll
97.30s: notice that there's actually too
98.60s: many that they don't even you can't
100.00s: see the whole name. That's okay
101.30s: because I know what they are. We
102.70s: have bid ask last those were all
105.20s: your just general pricing tools.
107.30s: Then we have kind of the
108.60s: stereotypical options tools. So
110.20s: Delta gamma theta Vega row. I
112.70s: like to see all of them realistically
115.00s: and a lot of people actually don't
116.10s: realize how big of an impact some
117.50s: of these have. And it's also really
120.00s: good to be able to see these different
122.60s: Greeks at different delta's different
125.30s: strikes. Even when we're comparing
127.90s: across put calls at the same delta
131.00s: taking a look at theta between the
132.60s: two overall, it's really interesting
134.80s: stuff and it integrates into a lot of
136.60s: my strategies in different ways.
138.50s: From there, we have open interest
140.80s: and then volume for those that don't
142.70s: know the difference between these
143.70s: two. Very simple volume is how many
145.90s: transacted today open interest is
148.40s: how many remain open at the end of
151.10s: the day. So volume can be in an out
153.50s: open interest is what's remaining
155.30s: day over day. Then we also have the
158.10s: implied volatility probability of
159.90s: in the money and probability of a
161.30s: touch. One quick admin note here
163.60s: fun fact is if you take a look at a
165.40s: Delta and this is a 30 delta if we
167.90s: take a look at the probability of in
169.60s: the money for the 13 days to
172.80s: expiration. I'm just using a short
174.40s: put here. It's the 4 2 35 and this
177.70s: has a 30.4% probability of in the
181.10s: money very, very close to this delta.
183.40s: The problem with using delta is an
185.10s: approximation is that that relationship
187.30s: doesn't hold true over all periods
189.40s: of time and it actually breaks down
190.70s: the further out you go. For example,
192.90s: looking at a same 30 delta bit now
194.80s: we're 104 days out. If I look at
197.20s: probability of in the money, it's 33.3%
200.30s: it's a 3.3% variance, which
202.40s: doesn't sound like much, but that's
203.50s: 10% difference between these two
205.60s: numbers. The point being is it's a
207.30s: really common thing to use delta as
208.80s: approximation for in the money. I
210.40s: don't think that's going to break
211.60s: anything necessarily, but there is
213.80s: a difference and it's also going to
215.00s: change based on volatility.
216.16s: Valtility is very low right now.
218.20s: So these are actually the closest
220.80s: I've ever seen them in terms of the
222.20s: true probabilities to one another.
223.80s: It also changes the further out of
225.20s: the money and the money you go stuff
226.40s: like that. This is not a video about
227.80s: probabilities, but I do think it's a
229.40s: fun fact and it's why I like to have
231.80s: the same thing. It's not a good
233.80s: thing to do with the money. I think
235.80s: it's not a good thing to have a
237.60s: good thing to do with the money.
239.50s: The probability of delta and the
241.50s: probability of in the money and the
243.60s: probability of a touch because also
245.60s: common way to use probability of
247.10s: a touch is 2x the delta so that
248.60s: would give us 60% chance probability
250.70s: of a touch. It's actually 63.4%
252.60s: probability of a touch and this is
254.70s: for the 13 days to expiration.
256.70s: The point being is depending on
258.70s: your edge and what that looks like.
260.70s: Okay, so that kind of goes through
262.70s: when I like to see in the options
264.70s: change. The other thing is that I
266.70s: typically like to have at least 50
268.70s: strikes and it's because if you trade
270.70s: more expensive products like spx, if
272.70s: you only use whatever the default is
274.70s: I think it's like 10. You like this is
276.70s: a 38 delta and a 44 delta on the
278.70s: call input side. You miss way too
280.70s: much. So I just leave 15 and that's
282.70s: typically pretty good. If I'm
284.70s: trading really wide box spreads or
286.70s: something sometimes I have to open it
288.70s: up more, but in general is pretty good.
289.70s: So I think it's a really good
291.70s: way to use options statistics. This is
293.70s: super useful. The current IV
295.70s: percentile. It is really important to
297.70s: note that this is actually incorrect.
299.70s: The IV percentile is not what they're
301.70s: reporting here. Oh, they actually
303.70s: changed it. I think.
305.70s: They sure haven't so this is
307.70s: actually IV rank. They I've
309.70s: wrote into them a bunch of times.
311.70s: But this says current IV
313.70s: percentile. This is actually IV
315.70s: rank. You can tell I'm not going to
317.70s: use IV percentile on rank right now. I
319.70s: have other videos on that. But there is
321.70s: a difference between the two and the time.
323.70s: It's going to be the most exposed is
325.70s: when there's a big move in the underlying.
327.70s: But that's what's going on here.
329.70s: But I do like to use that not this part
331.70s: specifically, but I do like to use
333.70s: IV high low. And I also like to use
335.70s: HV percentile IV like all of those are
339.70s: pretty decent tools. I also have them on the charts.
341.70s: So I don't need them, but it depends on war.
343.70s: I'm looking at things sometimes this is an easy way
345.70s: for me to check it out.
347.70s: Then over here. This is kind of a
349.70s: unsung hero side of this, but there's actually
351.70s: some pretty cool stuff in here.
353.70s: So you can take a look at the volume of
355.70s: calls versus puts. You can look at it for
357.70s: different time frames. You can take a look
359.70s: at also the delta transaction
363.70s: bands. It's kind of useful stuff to look
365.70s: for anomalies. You have to get used to
367.70s: looking at these numbers to understand
369.70s: what's weird. But once you follow
371.70s: this for a little while, you can kind of
373.70s: eyeball that stuff pretty quick. Like today, for example,
377.70s: it's no big surprise to me to see a lot
379.70s: more puts, not a lot, but notably more
381.70s: puts than calls transacting. That's pretty
383.70s: common, but there's periods where you'll
385.70s: see that invert same thing with the
389.70s: breakdown of delta's. You can get a
393.70s: feel for how they typically transact
395.70s: essentially. Then there's the
397.70s: Valtility sizzle indexes. That's
399.70s: essentially like a TD Ameritrade
401.70s: version of like unusual volume. I
405.70s: don't use this as an index much, but the
407.70s: put call ratio. I do. That's actually
409.70s: useful tool. Then going down a little
413.70s: bit further, we have time and sales. I
415.70s: typically put this up in that other chart
417.70s: that I showed you, but you can also see
419.70s: it in here, which is kind of useful.
421.70s: You can see if something was a spread
423.70s: itself. You can also kind of tell
425.70s: even if orders are submitted separately
427.70s: what they are. It also tells you
429.70s: where there's some big orders if you
431.70s: want to check that out. So I'm
433.70s: actually a pretty big fan and a lot of
435.70s: people also don't know that you can filter
437.70s: here. So you can take a look if you want to
439.70s: look at a specific exchange. If you want to
441.70s: just look at calls puts a specific
443.70s: time series. So if you just wanted to see
445.70s: what transacted today, so on and so forth.
447.70s: Again, it's a pretty robust tool that a lot of people
451.70s: don't don't fully take advantage of and it's
453.70s: because they don't know it's there. Then
455.70s: down here product depth. This is one of my
457.70s: favorite tools. I use this a lot and a lot of
459.70s: people don't, which is also a bummer.
461.70s: This shows us a lot. So right now I have
465.70s: it split out by call and put volume, but you can
469.70s: combine them into an average. You can look at
471.70s: just one, just the other or just out of the
475.70s: money versions. But here's what's cool.
477.70s: You can look at volume, which is super
479.70s: common for me to take a look at. This is where
481.70s: you can see where things are centralizing.
483.70s: I actually talk about this also in the zero
485.70s: DTE videos because you can see how much zero
487.70s: DTE volume there is. Take a look. It shows
489.70s: you the expiration right here and that's
491.70s: still the majority of the volume that we're
493.70s: seeing on a daily basis. But here's some of
497.70s: the other cool stuff. You can look at open
499.70s: interest so you can see where things are
501.70s: remaining open and take a look at how big
505.70s: the put open interest is compared to the call
507.70s: open interest. It's literally two X
509.70s: like almost precisely, which is pretty
513.70s: crazy. Significant puts you there. But here's some other cool stuff.
517.70s: Applied volatility. So if you're a
519.70s: volatility trader, you can actually start to see
521.70s: the volatility time series. You can also see the surface. It's not 3D
525.70s: because it's not necessarily giving you the extra
529.70s: view. But nonetheless, you're able to do it by
534.90s: isolating off of the actual dates, right? You can
538.90s: clean some of the series up so you don't have too many.
540.90s: The point being is you can get the implied
542.90s: volatility, you can get the strike and the
544.90s: moneyness and then you can also figure out the
546.90s: DTE off of here. It's just not as neat as the 3D version.
548.90s: But it's still here, which is kind of cool.
550.90s: So yeah, this is a really, really cool spot to take a look
554.90s: and tinker with. And then yeah, let's move on now.
558.90s: I'm not going to go through 4X. I'm not going to go through futures.
560.90s: Active trader. This is another useful tool specifically.
564.90s: If you intraday trade, so I like to set it up with an
566.90s: Ichimoku cloud for intraday stuff sometimes macd sometimes not.
570.90s: At all of the specific indicators and tools I use really
574.90s: depend on what I'm doing. But the main thing is I like to
578.90s: have a chart over here and then I like to have the order book open
581.90s: over here because when the market's open, you can actually see
584.90s: where orders are resting, how big they are, all that kind of stuff.
588.90s: And then pairstrader. This is a really great place to set up a way to compare
592.90s: different products to one another. So in this example, you can see
596.90s: that I have a comparison on the left hand side for Walmart and
599.90s: Target. The way I have this split up is into three sections.
603.90s: The left hand side is combining them into a ratio.
607.90s: And then the right to I typically would mimic whatever is over
611.90s: here to look at them individually. So for example, if we're looking at Walmart and
615.90s: Target, I would drop Walmart over here, Target over here.
619.90s: And then you can see how they move in relation to one another across the same time frame.
623.90s: It's a useful tool for me, but I keep the T.A. over here super simple.
627.90s: I just use some moving averages and linear regression channels. But what I really
631.90s: like to do is look at all the different correlation time frames.
633.90s: So I have correlations built out for three days, five days, 10 days, 30 days,
637.90s: 60 days, 90 days, so on and so forth. It allows me to very quickly assess
641.90s: correlation across different time frames if I'm looking for some sort of
644.90s: pairstrader. Now down to the analyze tab for the risk profile.
650.90s: This lets you see open positions. This not a whole lot to adjust in here,
654.90s: modify, but this is one of my favorite things to use anyways.
658.90s: You can include commissions or not. I typically include exclude depending on the
662.90s: strategy, but I typically exclude and then just track it on my own.
666.90s: And then for the different lines, you can actually view day by day steps.
670.90s: It doesn't have to be just off of one expiration cycle.
674.90s: There's a lot of really cool tools in here. The probability analysis.
678.90s: This gives you a probability of cone. You can look at either in the money or
682.90s: a touch. And then you can also change the probability range. So this is a
686.90s: one standard deviation move. So this is telling you this is a one standard
690.90s: deviation probability of SPX falling within these time bands by these specific
696.90s: dates. And that's what this vertical axis is. Well, really it's the X axis,
700.90s: but I'm sorry, these vertical lines, it's showing you the different expiration
704.90s: cycles. So the Y axis is actually the price. Now, economic data.
710.90s: This is another spot. A lot of people don't know about, but you can come in here and look at a lot of really interesting things.
718.90s: So we go take a look at commercial banking. And we could maybe look at federal
723.90s: fund sold and securities purchased for all commercial banks. The point being is some of these were like really extreme specific stuff.
731.90s: But some of them are actually really, really useful. So you can look at house price indexes, which this is super useful.
737.90s: If you don't use this, you can look at it for different time frames, different aggregation periods. You can change it from linear to log rhythmic scale.
744.90s: You can do all sorts of cool things in here. Really cool spot. Think back. I don't typically use within here. I typically go to on demand, which is in the top right corner.
756.90s: You can't totally see it because my stuff's in the way, but it's right below the X button, essentially to close the platform.
762.90s: You'll see a button that says on demand. That's really cool to this is where you get to use the historic data, but trade it as if it were live, which is also very, very cool.
772.90s: Fundamentals, this is like a must. So if we wanted to look at Nvidia, which is just, you know, the talk of the town flying through the roof.
780.90s: I set this up to take a look at a bunch of different things, but I like to include it automatically populates all this different data for you.
787.90s: You can look at it on an annual basis, a quarterly basis. And then even down here, it goes through the different details on how it did in the past earnings, what, why it did, what it did, what are some of the key trends within the individual product and industry and then down at the bottom.
803.90s: It actually breaks down the percentage of market cap, what individual segments, how they institute that market cap. So for example, computing and networking is 56.9% of the stocks market cap.
818.90s: And then it can even break it down into sub sectors and it can even give you essentially historic trends, but then forward price projections huge, really, really useful stuff.
828.90s: And then earnings for those that don't know, I track earnings very closely. And you can take a look at either all of these different earnings, you can see how it did before earnings, how it did at earnings, it tells you essentially what the date was down at the bottom, which you can't totally seeks it's cut off.
845.90s: But then you can see what the actual earnings was, what Wall Street was projecting. This is also super common, by the way, where the actual trend above Wall Street, it's because of the way that the earnings system is structured.
857.90s: I have a video on that. I'll actually link for you because it's such a fucked up system that you can't trust, but nonetheless, I digress, you can still track a lot of stuff. You can see how the at the money straddle did what IV HV did. If you track earnings the way that I do, this is probably one of the most useful tools that you have at your disposal to quickly synthesize.
874.90s: Then there's all the different scans, essentially, I'm not going to go through all those, but you can either use like some of your personal scan queries, you can use public scan queries. And you can just tinker with a lot of different stuff. I typically stay in stock hacker, which allows me to look through stocks. And then what I like to do, as you'll notice is I have a bunch of columns set up. This allows me to see a ton of information super quickly.
902.90s: So I have all these different fundamental indicators. I also have columns for technical analysis indicators that are custom think scripts like is it above a 50 day, am a is it above the 150 day is the 50 day slow positive. All of those kinds of things.
917.90s: And then we have the market watch tab. This allows us to look at the different indices, the different sectors, all different kinds of breakdowns of the publicly available products for us to trade.
930.90s: I like to see what's in different sectors. This is a really convenient way to do that. So if you're curious what's in the S&P 500, here you go. This is where you see it. And then if you want to know it's in communication services specifically great click there. Now you know.
943.90s: And you can continue to dive in further and further based on the sectors sub sectors sub sectors so on and so forth. Now, if we go over to tools.
955.90s: I don't really use this for much of anything, but you can upload your think scripts. You can look at different ones. You could check out their different videos like all that kind of stuff. So there is value over here. Same thing with the education center. I don't use this that much.
969.90s: But I know that they bake everything into this, which is really cool. Let's talk about charts real quick. In general, I like to use different time frames to take a look at different hypothesis.
983.90s: So I have all of these different time frames quickly baked in so that I can quickly bounce between different ones based on what I'm trying to trade. So for example.
996.90s: So some other things you'll notice I almost always have linear regression channels. These are one of my favorite tools. I have an entire video that walks through linear regression channels. So I'll link to that in the notes below.
1008.90s: A couple of other things I do like to include earnings in the chart and dividends. It kind of gives me just some general context, which I find useful.
1017.90s: Then down below for the sub graphs. I have volume volume average. Then I have a MAC D histogram and then the MAC D two lines. It kind of gives me a little better fidelity when I'm using MAC D. It's not always this, but sometimes so.
1033.90s: And then I always have IV HV plots for different time frames. I have specific calculators that let me look at in Shreday IV more effectively because this essentially IV is going to update end of day here.
1048.90s: Whereas HV would update throughout the day. That's just a movement of the underlying. And then this last sub graph that you see is actually all broad market data. This actually isn't tied to this individual stock at all.
1059.90s: So down here, I have things like tick train average weighted train. I have different VIX future months. So I can see if we're in contango back rotation how steep it is. And then I also have net highs lows and then advanced decline cumulative average.
1077.90s: So those are just breath indicators for the broad market. Now back up here in the main chart section. There's a few other things that you'll see. So I already told you about the linear regression channels. I have a volume profile, which I really, really like.
1092.90s: And I always put it kind of in the background. I overlay it on the chart so that it's not in my way. And if you're curious how to do that, you go to at its study. And then these are the settings essentially that you want to set up.
1105.90s: So I don't have it on the expansion. If you do that, that's when you're going to have like that split chart, which I don't like. And then some of the other things is just changing the opacity so that it's not like super in your face.
1117.90s: And I also like to change the color of the profile itself so that it's not quite as loud.
1124.90s: But then I get rid of essentially all this other stuff. I don't have the value areas. I don't have the low profile, the high profile. Just kind of showing you the overall parameters of it.
1134.90s: I don't use any of that stuff because it's just extra noise. I just want to see the profile itself, which is right here. And then I always have moving averages.
1142.90s: So I tinker with different time frames a lot, but typically it's going to be a short term either a nine day 10 day 11 day right now my short term is a nine day. And this is an SMA.
1155.90s: And then here we have a 22 day EMA exponential moving average. And then this third one that you see, let me try to isolate it so that you can clearly here we go.
1167.90s: This is a 50 day EMA. And then this one's almost always a 150 or 200 right now. It's a 200 EMA.
1174.90s: I like to use these different moving averages because also it's very educational for a lot of different things. But it's most of what I have on my chart is pretty simple in nature. Like if you think about it. And I purposely keep it that way because there's a lot of stuff out there.
1189.90s: And I find this stuff to work pretty well. Sometimes I'll add things like anchor VWOPs, Bollinger bands, but more often than not. This is going to be the setup.
1198.90s: And then at the top, I have different labels. These are all think scripts. And I have things for implied volatility percentile in rank, which I already told you before. But then I also plot out the expected moves in a dollar and percentage amount.
1212.90s: And I also have like the average daily range and average true range. So I have the percent we move today, the five day average daily range. I think are with different time frames on the ADR and the ATR.
1224.90s: And then we have the high low for the weekend for the month. Again, this is just kind of giving us general context around things. At the money, put call ratio. So what strike, what expiration we're using and what is the put call ratio.
1238.90s: And then this is actually a pretty cool can slim tool that I found and modified a little bit, but it pulls in the earnings per share you over a year, the quarter over quarter, the return on equity.
1250.90s: How far we are off of highs, are we above the 200 day EMA with an additional 2% and then the relative strength ratios. So this is kind of just like a cool little canceling tool for specific stocks that you would run that in.
1264.90s: And then I also have how correlated is it to the spy. This uses different time frames. It's completely customizable to what you want. And then the relative strength. I also have this slaved against the spy.
1275.90s: So that's most of what I have on my chart. If you have any specific questions in there, let your boy now happy to take a look. But otherwise, this is a really cool platform. I'm happy to dive way more into detail. There's a lot of other stuff. This just scratches the surface.
1290.90s: We didn't get into watch list. We didn't get into watch list columns. We didn't get into pretty much any of these side panel tools, which there's actually a lot of really cool things that I like to use in here.
1300.90s: So happy to do that if you guys are interested in the future. But otherwise, let me know what you thought. Don't forget like subscribe share with some friends. We're trying to grow out here. We're coming up on 12k.
1310.90s: I'd love to hit 15k by the end of the year. That's my goal. Be an outlier. I'll see you guys later.
