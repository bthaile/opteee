0.72s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.60s: because we had a little bit of a rig
5.04s: roll with the old S&P 500 so I actually
8.68s: want to walk through what happened today
10.68s: in the market as a whole but
12.44s: specifically looking at spy I want to
14.56s: talk about Big Daddy J Pal's comments
17.32s: and then I actually want to talk a
19.40s: little bit about General market
20.96s: structure and where there's some
22.20s: opportunities at least as far as I see
23.84s: it so what happened today as you can see
26.16s: we started off pretty mellow day nothing
28.52s: to write home about and then Big Daddy
31.36s: JP this is all in Pacific well you can't
33.36s: even see the time axis so it doesn't
34.64s: matter to you but big daddy JP came on
37.00s: essentially 1055 Pacific time and if you
40.24s: take a a guess on where 1055 is that's
42.92s: right here and then as he spoke the
45.72s: market dropped a little under 2% and
48.60s: then rallied right back up so what
50.84s: happened what's going on and why does
52.76s: this matter well it matters because the
55.68s: market right now is trying to figure out
57.48s: are we in a plane that still has wheels
60.64s: and might land relatively softly or has
64.44s: the landing gear got stuck and are we
67.16s: getting ready to crash and it's up for
70.56s: conjecture we actually don't know yet
72.60s: now if we take a look at Big Daddy JP's
75.32s: comments for today it leads us to
77.80s: believe that things look relatively okay
81.16s: so let's talk about it he says that more
84.44s: interest rate cuts are in the pipeline
87.08s: but they would occur at a measured pace
90.16s: to support the still healthy economy why
93.12s: does this matter well if we stroll over
96.12s: to the FED watch to and we take a look
98.04s: at some probabilities here all of a
100.92s: sudden there's actually kind of a pretty
103.32s: big change so if I compare these I want
106.56s: you to notice the difference between
109.12s: this here represents a 25 basis point
112.28s: cut this represents a 50 basis point cut
114.64s: what do you notice that happened today
117.96s: well the probability of a 25 basis point
120.92s: cut went from
123.12s: 46% now to
125.68s: 63% the market was yet again pretty far
129.88s: ahead of itself and we've seen this
131.88s: happen literally continually this is not
136.08s: stopped for a beat throughout this
138.40s: entire thing the market is perpetually
141.08s: trying to front run this move so the
143.96s: Market's expectations just got snapped
146.92s: back to reality and again we've seen
150.12s: this happen time and time again that's
151.60s: actually why I don't think there was
153.48s: this big visceral reaction to it because
155.80s: I think a lot of us myself included I
158.00s: actually was thinking 50 basis points
159.96s: was a little excessive to do 50 basis
162.28s: points than another 50 basis points
164.68s: again not saying that that would break
166.48s: anything we still have plenty of basis
168.36s: points to go but it just indicates a
171.36s: complete change that's quite a bit more
173.12s: aggressive than what he's been actively
175.60s: communicating so this does not surprise
178.40s: me and this largely look looks like the
180.88s: market is now digesting this new
183.92s: information and you can see the bond
185.76s: market is repricing probabilities as
188.20s: they should be so now let's take a look
191.44s: at a couple other things like this no
193.68s: shock here right disappointed the hopes
196.32s: of many investors that there would be
198.52s: kind of a another steep cut the the
201.16s: problem with this is that it's near-term
202.96s: investors and that's kind of a
204.88s: contradiction and kind of like
206.00s: nearsighted investors I guess because
208.88s: realistically speaking speaking this if
211.88s: we saw two 50 basis point Cuts in a row
214.72s: compared to how long we waited to start
216.88s: cutting it starts to raise a lot of
219.12s: questions the 50 basis point cut already
223.52s: raises quite a lot of questions because
226.80s: is again like he's been talking about
228.68s: this right here a measured Pace he's
231.08s: been talking about this data driven
233.16s: approach that's slow methodical and it
235.96s: has been generally that so to sit here
239.32s: and think that we we actually would want
242.12s: another half Point come down the problem
245.12s: with that is that starts to say things
247.60s: are not actually looking good if we have
250.08s: to depart from the plan to execute this
252.20s: plan so let's continue reading it says
256.16s: the FED cut its rate by a larger than
258.80s: usual half point which is completely
260.92s: accurate from a statistical perspective
262.84s: as it's moved its inflation fight and
264.76s: pivoted towards supporting the job
266.52s: market so let's figure out what he has
269.76s: has said we're looking at it as a
272.72s: process that will play out over some
274.68s: time again he's slowing expectations
279.00s: he's saying chill the out homie
281.92s: we're going to get there then he goes on
284.32s: to say not something that we need to go
286.20s: fast on it'll depend on the data this is
288.68s: the same thing we've heard like every
291.00s: time he opens his mouth either money is
293.36s: coming out as he's printing money or
295.16s: he's saying this the speed at which we
297.20s: will actually go so right now now the
300.88s: way I look at this is every literally
303.20s: every single time we get broad Market
305.36s: data that enters the picture that has
307.36s: anything to do with the economy
309.08s: employment inflation those are all going
311.76s: to be massively hot button items right
315.44s: now today until we have a more clear
318.52s: picture on how this is going to go
320.32s: because right now there is no clear
322.48s: picture and right now if you look across
324.68s: the larger Banks and institutions that
326.92s: are trying to forecast the probability
329.80s: of us having a recession it is still
333.24s: well over 25% probability in 2025 that
336.92s: we enter a recession some places are as
338.92s: high as 50% so it is something you have
341.80s: to be aware of as we look at this which
343.60s: leads me to the second point of this
345.48s: video which is so where's the
347.28s: opportunity how does this work where do
349.32s: we find things that look interesting and
353.00s: as I try to remind people the market is
355.20s: always going to show you interesting
357.60s: things so let's take a look within the
360.80s: S&P 500 and I want to specifically look
363.64s: at the individual sectors within the S&P
366.84s: 500 because there are still the very
370.04s: same persistent themes we've talked
371.60s: about that if anybody has been acting on
374.40s: them you've been making money because
376.16s: there's no reason not to here there are
378.60s: clearly defined strong performing
381.52s: sectors there are clearly defined losing
384.24s: sectors that in my opinion are actually
385.80s: in the process of trying to turn around
387.76s: which necessitates a completely
388.96s: different approach it's a less clear
390.80s: path to trade but what are the what are
392.52s: the clear models that we see here to
394.48s: make money the first one xlc
395.92s: Communications literally just made
397.28s: another new high you can see I'm already
398.64s: long in this same thing with xlu hanging
401.24s: out near New highs these are not new
403.28s: names that I'm like oh yeah I'm just
404.44s: going to mention these now because
406.16s: they're up I've been talking about these
407.60s: for weeks and it's because they've been
410.12s: some of the strongest performing sectors
413.56s: even when we've gone through periods
415.08s: like this where technology has been
417.32s: contracting so for bullish style trades
421.80s: make it simple look for things that are
424.20s: showing strength then if you want to go
426.12s: within the individual sectors and find
427.96s: the strongest performing stocks that's
430.16s: what I like to do and if you're taking a
433.28s: look at what's not doing well well
436.28s: believe it or not Tech is not looking
439.12s: great here it's barely holding on I
442.20s: still want to be very clear I'm not
444.28s: bullish or bearish in Tech I I I'm
446.84s: agnostic I'm simply trading what it does
449.88s: but what I notice here is that we've had
451.32s: a high we've moved down to this really
453.52s: big pullback low we rallied up to this
456.12s: High we had a higher low this is
458.68s: typically bullish this is typically a
460.44s: reversal in a pattern that's normally
462.08s: good the problem I have with this is it
464.28s: sits right now is as it tried to break
467.32s: above this term High here it failed and
471.16s: it's rolling back over now today it
473.00s: grabbed a bite so maybe it will rally up
475.56s: and out and maybe if this does start to
478.36s: convincingly move a this High I do start
480.80s: to look at it as a reversal so I'm
482.88s: actually long Q's right now Q Futures
485.64s: but I'm very tentatively long because I
488.44s: still don't see a massive amount of
490.92s: strength I see some of it happening
492.40s: right I see the moving averages starting
494.20s: to consolidate I see price hanging above
496.96s: the more impactful moving averages stuff
498.60s: like that that matters to me but that's
501.56s: not the same picture as you look at xlu
504.04s: that's been making highs for two weeks
505.92s: now if you look at xlc that's been
507.52s: making highs again for a month now
510.08s: almost so there are places to find
512.92s: strength you just have to look a little
514.96s: bit differently we are seeing real
517.12s: estate starting to rotate over we're
519.08s: seeing things like xlp Trends sideways
521.92s: this is a really important consolidation
523.84s: point I like to trade these as they
525.80s: break out above or below again don't
527.80s: care which way it goes my job is to
529.72s: trade the movement not really care about
532.40s: which way it goes either or works for me
534.48s: just fine we do see XLV breaking off and
537.88s: again this is Now setting a higher low
540.76s: but we have to see how well it
542.08s: consolidates in here but this starts to
543.80s: look weak to me it's the simplest
546.32s: ever higher highs higher lows lower
549.08s: highs lower lows it is literally just
552.72s: following what price is doing 101 but
555.52s: there are elements of strength there are
557.72s: elements of weakness that are highly
559.72s: highly tradable for those that are
561.56s: willing to trade both sides as I am and
563.92s: if you're an options Trader that's one
565.16s: of the benefits of doing it this way so
567.28s: we'll dive into a bunch of different
568.92s: scans later today during the live stream
570.84s: at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time wanted to
572.76s: recap at a high level what's going on as
574.68s: always if you need anything let me know
575.96s: be an outlier I'll see you later
