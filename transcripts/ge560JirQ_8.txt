0.00s: The reasons to trade options, there's a lot of them.
3.56s: There's also a lot of drawbacks that people don't really pay enough attention to.
7.56s: So the goal of this video is to walk you through why I trade options
12.36s: and then to give you some starting points on how you can get your feet wet
17.40s: and get into the world of trading options.
19.84s: Because for the vast majority of people,
23.64s: you'll notice it kind of goes a little bit like this,
26.92s: where we start putting on trades and we don't know what to do.
30.56s: Or we lose all of our money trading options.
33.76s: That's a pretty common one as well.
35.68s: Or because now roaring kitty is back, everybody is yoloing into GameStop calls.
42.24s: And unfortunately for most people, this isn't going to work out super well.
46.68s: So the idea behind this video is to walk you through how I've used options.
52.00s: And there's plenty of people that do way better than I do.
54.92s: But this just kind of shows you that you can make good money trading options.
59.80s: From 2007 until 2023, my compound annual growth rate is actually now just up over 26%.
68.12s: I had my best year to date last year.
71.20s: So punchline is you can make really good money doing this stuff.
75.20s: If you can resist the allure of really fast short term money,
81.08s: because I mean realistically, when they're down 50% hoping that somebody else is going to make the money.
87.16s: It doesn't work super great.
88.40s: So let's talk about the reasons to trade options.
91.24s: What's up to the outliers?
93.20s: Welcome back to another video.
95.28s: And let's get straight in.
97.68s: So the first thing to know is that when we trade options, we are actually adding a lot of complexity.
104.12s: What does that mean?
104.72s: Well, you have to look at stuff like this that might not mean anything to you.
108.40s: I actually think it's kind of cool.
109.88s: And then you have to understand how to read this kind of stuff, which again is pretty kind of cool once you know,
114.36s: I don't use it.
115.28s: But realistically, when you do something like you buy shares of Tesla, for example,
122.56s: really what you're looking at is something that looks like this.
126.48s: This is your PNL.
128.08s: It's a PNL graph.
129.36s: The Y axis shows how much money you're making and or not making.
134.28s: This is the zero line.
135.80s: And then the X axis is different prices in Tesla.
140.12s: So right now we're using this is where the current price is the center one.
143.44s: And then this is minus and plus one standard deviation than two standard deviations in them.
147.84s: So what I'm trying to highlight for you here is something that's very specific.
152.96s: And it's the fact that when you are buying shares, really two things can happen.
158.04s: It can go up or it can go down.
159.48s: There's no expiration.
160.76s: It's pretty straightforward.
162.00s: As soon as you start adding options, now not only do you have to be correct in terms of your
168.32s: your direction, you care about something called volatility.
172.00s: And that's really just the perception of how something is going to move in the future.
177.40s: You also care about things like interest rates because that can impact the PNL of your position.
182.80s: And then there's also now a time frame component because if you'll notice from this back here,
187.80s: all options have an expiration date, which is to say after the 17th of May,
193.40s: the options in here, they're gone.
195.32s: They all expire and that's it.
197.52s: They're gone.
198.44s: So you have to go into options with your eyes wide open understanding that we're adding complexity.
205.20s: So why?
206.76s: Why would we add this complexity?
209.48s: Well, it's for a few really solid reasons.
213.52s: And they give you options, the ability to create these very specific
219.84s: risk reward payoff structures and they allow you to do a lot of things that equities outright
226.80s: do not.
227.72s: You're a sex of them.
228.68s: The very first one is they offer you leverage.
232.80s: What does that mean in this context?
234.72s: Let's take a look together.
236.48s: This is using Tesla at 175, just for an example.
240.60s: And let's look at two different scenarios.
242.12s: Let's say that you want to buy 100 shares of Tesla and let's compare that to buying five
249.68s: 170 calls in Tesla.
252.24s: You don't have to worry about what that means just yet.
253.68s: Just know that means you want it to go up.
255.36s: Okay.
255.80s: Well, let's take a look at the relative costs for these two different positions.
259.16s: In this case, you are putting up $17,500 and you are controlling 100 shares of Tesla.
265.16s: In this case, you're putting up $8,725, but you're controlling 500 shares of Tesla up to 500.
275.32s: In the beginning, it would be a little bit less than that because we're at a 62 delta.
279.00s: So in this case, it would just be 62 times 500.
282.44s: That would equal your current number of shares, notionally, but you get to control up to 500 shares
289.40s: right from the jump.
290.64s: This right here is leverage at play.
293.88s: The other thing is the risk payoff for these two different things actually looks quite different.
299.64s: So if we go back to this and take a look together, this is what just your long shares look like,
305.96s: right?
306.28s: As we already kind of pointed out.
308.20s: Now, let's take a look at what long calls in this example look like.
313.00s: Notice how different that is.
314.60s: We still have unlimited profit potential to the upside, but now you have limited downside.
320.04s: The most you can lose in this trade is how much money you put into it, which in this case is
324.20s: $8,725.
326.04s: That's the most you can lose.
327.32s: That's very different than what you see when you buy shares, well, Tesla, you have unlimited
333.88s: downside and unlimited upside.
336.12s: Why is that the case?
337.24s: Well, because there has to be a trade off here, right?
340.60s: We just acknowledge the fact that when you're trading options, you're adding complexity to the
345.56s: position. So in this case, you now have a time frame that you have to be correct in, which is 72 days
351.40s: to expiration.
352.44s: So that means that over time this is going to decay.
354.92s: That's the price of the leverage you were afforded.
357.80s: Now, let's look at it in example quickly.
360.04s: Let's say Tesla goes to 190.
362.20s: In this example where you buy 100 shares, you'd make $1,500, which is 8.6% return on invested capital.
368.76s: In the scenario that we bought options, you make $5,000, which is a 57% return.
375.48s: Uninvested capital, much more capital efficient if you're correct.
379.96s: So it's a way to leverage the things you're doing.
383.72s: And if you're good at picking direction, you can make a lot of money trading options.
389.72s: There's no doubt about it.
390.76s: Let's go into a couple of these others.
392.52s: Direction optionality is pretty straightforward.
394.92s: And all that means is when you buy stock, you need it to go up.
399.40s: Now, you can short stock so that you're trading something to the downside.
403.96s: And it kind of takes an inverse graph here.
406.84s: But when you do this, you're actually borrowing shares.
409.80s: And you have to pay interest on those shares that you're borrowing.
413.56s: So it's a slightly different look.
415.40s: But the cool part with options is you get to create all these different kind of risk payoff diagrams,
422.68s: where maybe we have some long premium and short premium side to our trade.
427.96s: So we have downside potential, meaning if we want to trade this to the downside,
431.64s: similar to short shares.
433.16s: You want to trade it to the downside.
434.44s: So we're buying puts.
435.88s: But then we're actually selling some calls to amplify the strategy.
440.20s: Or if you want to reduce your risk a little bit,
442.68s: you can actually sell puts against your long puts.
446.84s: And notice how it keeps a similar payoff diagram.
449.64s: But we're actually collecting a little bit of a premium upfront.
452.44s: And it helps our break even if we're slightly wrong.
455.56s: So you can create any sort of combination of strategies to capture
461.32s: whatever directional disposition you have,
463.40s: including things that are moving sideways.
465.72s: If you're trading equities, you need something to go up or down.
468.84s: It has to move somewhere other than receiving a dividend, which is helpful.
472.84s: But you need price movement in order for capital gains potential
475.96s: with options.
476.60s: That's not so much the case.
477.88s: The other thing is you get to hedge risk, which is actually part of what you were just seeing.
481.64s: Right?
482.04s: We're able to reduce our downside a little bit if we're so inclined.
486.20s: The other way you can reduce your risk is let's say instead that you want to buy
490.84s: the same shares, but now you buy a put that put decreases your downside risk.
498.84s: So that you have a capped downside at this point.
501.88s: Again, options give you a lot of choices.
505.80s: They can reduce risk.
507.00s: They can let you create very specific structures.
509.40s: That makes sense for you.
510.68s: Let's get into two more of these specifically.
512.92s: The trading volatility and structural alpha.
515.72s: Something like trading volatility can be really useful,
519.80s: specifically if markets aren't moving much.
522.52s: So a great example of this is back in 2015.
527.48s: The S&P 500 in that year returned 1.31%.
530.92s: It didn't do much.
532.12s: However, if you're trading things like volatility around earnings releases or if you're trading zero
537.16s: DTE options like I do, you can make money even when the market's not doing a whole lot.
543.32s: The other thing is volatility is its own asset class.
546.12s: It behaves its own specific way and it's actually way more predictable than stock price
551.32s: in short term time frames.
552.60s: And the other thing is structural alpha.
554.92s: This is a way that you can capture on little quirks in the market that over time bear edge,
562.20s: meaning they make you money long term runways.
565.64s: So options grant you access to all of this.
569.80s: So if I were to start trading options, this is the list of strategies I would start with.
575.40s: I would use these two different buckets,
578.28s: bullish meaning we want things to expand or go up bearish go down and then you can split them
583.40s: for bullish directional or bullish volatility because these are two different asset classes
589.32s: essentially that let you capture different kinds of price movements.
592.84s: This is where I'd start and I have videos for essentially all of these and I'll throw them
597.96s: in the notes below options in general have the ability to quite literally change your entire
605.32s: life.
606.12s: It allows you to much more carefully manage your risk.
609.56s: You can be super aggressive looking for a lot of leverage expecting a lot of volatility
613.64s: or you can say I don't want to be quite as aggressive.
615.80s: I want to decrease my volatility but still make money.
618.44s: You can do all of that with options.
619.96s: Be an outlier.
620.60s: See you later.
