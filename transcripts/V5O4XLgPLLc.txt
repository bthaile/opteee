0.00s: We time for a GME update because we have some big news on what's going on today, the
5.64s: 11th of June that I want to walk you guys through now again to be clear. I am an
10.26s: option trader. That is my perspective on this stuff. It's how I got alerted to the
14.06s: most recent price movement because I noticed unusual transaction volume. Obviously it was
18.60s: roaring kitty didn't know that at the time. So I started placing trades based on that.
23.16s: I'm familiar with GameStop, but I am nowhere near as read in as you guys are the ape community.
28.20s: I consider myself a guest in the house as it is right now. I traded the last squeeze,
32.84s: but there's people that have been here over that entire duration really, really involved.
36.66s: So I am having a blast learning about this entire thing. What you guys are working on.
41.06s: Now from a trading perspective, I want to walk us through some position updates and the
45.52s: way I think this thing could go into the expiration next Friday because that's really where
51.28s: all the interesting stuff is set to happen. Now the very first thing we have to talk about
55.92s: is not this tweet, although I think it's funny because we even have somebody like Timothy
59.84s: Sykes now trying to badmouth roaring kitty. I just can't help but find it funny that everybody
64.92s: is trying to say something negative about this guy that roaring kitty is a shell that he's
68.80s: trying to manipulate people that he's falling off the saddle. It's like the dude has hundreds
73.56s: of millions of dollars. Chill out, bro. He's doing okay. And more over than that, he is
79.52s: the greatest sense of humor on planet earth. If we take a look at this tweet from earlier
84.88s: today, it's one of my favorite things because everybody's talking about him trading options
90.48s: and they're saying like, oh, does this guy understand options? Does he doesn't he know
94.16s: about faded decay? He bought premium. It's like, bro, he's a CFA. He is a $68 million
102.26s: relatively short term options position in something like GME. And that's what he's doing.
108.24s: My favorite part is that his sense of humor, I can't get enough of it. It's so funny.
114.04s: He's trolling everybody as if he's now just learning the basics after putting this position
119.08s: on. Obviously, the dude knows what's up. So there's actually one other tweet. This one,
125.76s: that's hilarious because again, his sense of humor on this whole thing is something that
130.44s: I think can inspire just about anybody. He's obviously poking fun at how close he was.
136.40s: He's becoming a billionaire. And then, and you know, obviously GME had a rough couple
140.76s: days, which looks like we're probably through. So if you take a look, GameStop, it completed
148.28s: the equity offering. So what that meant was when this first launched, we started seeing
154.88s: massive selling volume accumulate. This is from the seventh of June. Then the 10th Monday,
163.64s: we saw a continuation of that sale volume. This is shares entering the market. They're selling
169.20s: shares into the market that provides a lot of downward pressure. But take a look at today,
174.24s: the day that that volume abated, the day that they announced that it was concluded. Look
179.40s: at the sale volume, minute skill, and take a look at all of these people buying above the
185.44s: recent averages. Shares are being accumulated in DRS. You can see it happening essentially
191.04s: real time here. And it's being represented in price. What I find so cool about this is
196.60s: that means that we lost some ground from essentially 38 were opened here. And then it got
202.16s: pushed down all the way to kind of 25. And then today, it's up over 22%. And it's still
209.08s: after hours bidding above 30. So there's plenty of buying pressure here. Now how this all
215.24s: fits into the expiration next Friday is really where all of this gets super interesting.
221.92s: Because if we pull up, we're in Kitty's position here, the 20 calls out here in 21 June,
228.48s: a few things stick out to me here. The first one is there was another positive 4,092 contracts
234.92s: traded today being added to that. And you can see the current open interest is over 166,400
242.40s: contracts. So there's people still accumulating in this. The volume for today was 18,879. So
248.32s: there's people just piling into this in droves. There's also a massive, massive change going
252.92s: on here at the 30s. These are people that are being cheaper trying to get slightly cheaper
257.20s: exposure to leverage is compared to going super deep in the money. Couple other really
261.28s: important points here. Everybody that's freaking out about theta decay for him. I don't think
266.08s: they understand the game that he's playing and why he's letting these options that are
269.72s: now deep in the money continue to run because if we take a look at the last price 3049 of
275.28s: GME, that places him over $10 in the money. The amount of extrinsic value left in these options
284.64s: is about $1, actually a little bit less than a dollar. So as this goes deeper in the money,
291.24s: the extrinsic value of those options will decrease as intrinsic value comprises more of the premium.
299.04s: So if there's an even more significant price accommodation, this can be massive for him for a
304.20s: couple of reasons, which I will show you right now. If we take a look at his last position update,
311.00s: and again, today's the 11th of June, this is from the 10th of June, and I'll give you updated
315.40s: numbers here so that you can follow along a little more easily. So he still has obviously, as if
321.64s: yesterday, 120,000 of the 20 calls this represents a notional value of $240 million. That's how much
328.12s: money he would need in order to exercise this option and take full delivery not using margin,
334.52s: which he has access to. Right now, these are not trading at 681. These are trading at 11.3. That
342.28s: means his total gain on the position as of right now is 67,495,200 bucks. He's up 67 and a half
350.92s: million dollars. He still has 29.4 million in cash. So what does all of this mean? There's a lot
360.12s: of different opportunities he has in terms of how he wants to execute this trade. And he's getting
365.48s: really close to one of the most interesting ones in my opinion, which would be a cashless exercise.
371.64s: What that means is if the total gain on his position is large enough to cover the total cost,
377.88s: so if the total gain is over 240 million dollars, he can exercise his options and use the gain to
385.88s: cover the entire position. He was very close to that. If not over it, if I'm not mistaken. So he obviously
391.88s: has no problem waiting and allowing the position to play out. He still does have 29.4 million dollars
399.88s: to back him up though. So he's not quite there yet for some sort of cash transaction, but he's not
404.92s: super far off either because his shares will accumulate that he could always offload if he needed
410.44s: the cash, but he won't need to probably because he can always take it on margin where he doesn't have
415.40s: to put up the full 240 million dollars. His broker will request a subset of that because he will
421.08s: have marginal value from the rest of his positions and the cash that's in his account. So he has a
427.48s: few different ways he can play this out. Best case scenario for him is if this thing continues to bid
432.68s: up and he can execute that cashless exercise that I'm highlighting, which as of right now
437.48s: does not seem outside the realm of possibility to me. Now the last thing that I want to highlight from
443.40s: just an options trading perspective that I find interesting. Look at the call transaction volume
448.92s: today compared to the puts and look at where they're being hit at, meaning most of them are being
456.20s: taken at the midpoint. So it's people you can make heads or tails necessarily if that's a
460.52s: bought or sold position, which doesn't matter so much in this instance, but look at the overwhelming
466.36s: number of calls transacted 600,000 today compared to 260,000 puts massive callsque. Normally you'll see
474.68s: the inverse when you see this kind of callsque that's people pricing in massive upside potential.
480.76s: Then if we look down here at the OI open interest, let me scoot this in just a little bit so that
485.88s: you can see the rest of that number. You'll see that the call open interest is 977,000.
492.76s: The put open interest is 741,000 contracts. If we take a look at the 21 June expiration,
500.52s: this is where all the focus is. The putsque here is massive 456,000 contracts against 242.
508.92s: To give you an idea of what this normally looks like, if you go out further in time to something
513.88s: like this, the 18 October notice how there's putsque. This is more normal where there's 37,000 puts
520.04s: against 35, 36,000 calls normally. It's even more extreme to the put side, but that's to give you
525.48s: an idea of what this normally looks like. This is the inverse and then some massive upside being
531.40s: priced in and interesting on top of that, not really resonating into or kind of flowing into
537.16s: the 14 June expiration. It's not resonating with these shorter term options players for this week
543.32s: because the total OI for 14 June is like 176 and the put OI is 173, something like that. So there's
551.80s: actually just not that much flow through into this. The last thing I want to talk about is what
557.64s: happens if he chooses to sell? I've heard a lot of people ask that and it's okay question.
562.04s: One, the market makers would make them a market. It would be there, but he would take a massive
566.44s: haircut because everybody knows this position is out there now. So if he attempted to start unwinding
572.20s: this position, we would all pick it up. Again, me, I'm a random dude sitting in my house and one of my
577.88s: scanners picked up his buying volume and I didn't know who it was or what was going on. It was just
582.36s: anomalous, which necessitated a trade from me. So think of really all the sophisticated traders out
588.36s: there with incredible technology around this. They'll see it in a heartbeat and they will happily
594.36s: fade into it to follow that down move. The floor would come out if he started trying to unwind this
599.32s: in a big way. So do I think that's what's going to happen here? Probably not. It doesn't seem so much
605.40s: like his M.O. The other thing that I try to remind people that he can do is if he chooses to close
610.60s: his option position, which would bid the market down, he probably would give up some of this gain,
616.60s: but he still would make millions of dollars and then he could always just gain exposure again.
621.40s: Buy more, right? He now has way more money that he can do it with. He didn't even go all in on this
626.92s: first run. So he's working on some stuff in the background that obviously I'm not too privy to
631.80s: yet, but maybe you guys know better than me. Again, I view myself as a guest in this whole saga. I'm
637.08s: learning more as we go. I can't help but be completely fascinated. If you're in markets right now
641.72s: and don't think GME is one of the most fascinating things that you can be involved in, I don't know
645.40s: what you're looking at because as you can tell it literally gets me excited. It's so cool to see
650.60s: stuff like this. So all of that is to say, if I look at what I think he's going to do and what it
656.60s: looks like is happening, as this thing starts to rally, if we get that gamma ramp, which looks like
663.80s: it's happening, and we start to see price accumulate even more, he has the opportunity for a cashless
670.92s: exercise, which to me would be threading the needle for him on this position. Because then if he
676.68s: does that exercise, the market makers have to go find a bunch of shares on the open market that's
680.52s: already pretty limited because you guys are super smart, DRS in your shares, which is going to
684.84s: bid things up even more because it is a low, low volume pool that they can pull from that they're
691.40s: all trying to pull from. So that looks like the primary play here. He could always exercise part
698.60s: of his position, sell part of his position. There's no rules, meaning he can do whatever he wants
703.00s: with each and every one of those single contracts. What I can say is that I highly doubt he would do
708.52s: anything all at once. I don't think there's a reality where he hits the button to sell 120,000
715.00s: contracts. He would get murdered on the spread and the market makers would have a field day with
720.44s: that. He would probably have to phase out in 10,000 lot. And even that would be picked up super fast.
725.08s: You get two or three of those out and it would be seen nearly immediately. So one of the coolest
731.64s: things you can watch coming into the expiration next week. I cannot get enough of this. If you
735.48s: have any questions or anything to add, throw it in the comments. Keep being awesome, be an outlier.
739.64s: I'll see you guys later.
