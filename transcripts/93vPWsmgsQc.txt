0.00s: you
30.00s: you
60.00s: you
90.00s: you
120.00s: falsely
150.00s: It's not really the route that we wanted to go.
153.12s: We prefer to stay on discord, but the problem is that there are a prolific amount of scammers
160.26s: and from an admin level.
162.84s: It is a significant burden to try to continually scrape them out.
166.80s: It takes a ton of time and effort.
168.80s: So by moving over to the Patreon, we decrease the risk because they're not allowed.
174.12s: Nobody's allowed to DM one another.
176.14s: So it gets rid of that ability to scam people behind their backs trying to pretend to
180.82s: be people that whole thing.
183.18s: And for those that are wondering, there's still a completely free, several sections to
187.66s: the community.
188.66s: So there's literally no change there.
190.98s: It's just a slightly different change in terms of just where the community is and some
197.26s: of the built-in capabilities.
199.46s: Again, the Patreon capability isn't exactly what I would want long-term.
204.74s: My goal is to hibernate the discord and then when discord eventually fixes this problem,
213.18s: then I would love nothing more than to move us back.
215.94s: But until then, I just threw a link to the chat.
221.26s: You can sign up for free there again.
223.46s: That's one of my primary missions is to offer a space that I wish I had when I first
230.70s: started trading.
232.42s: And I fully acknowledge and understand that there are people that are newer in their path
236.66s: that just literally do not have the disposable income to pay for a community and I get that.
243.22s: So the downside to that is with a community that's open to everybody, it's free for scammers
249.98s: and stuff like that to join in.
251.54s: It's a 100% return on investment, right?
254.42s: So it does have some of those unfortunate components tied to it.
260.22s: So when we get a solution and discord, we'll migrate back.
264.50s: But until then, we're just popping over.
266.66s: We're now operating out of the Patreon.
269.38s: And like I said, if you have any questions, let me know.
271.02s: It's still completely free to join.
272.50s: You can see that there's a handful of chats.
274.58s: There's still the beginner chat, the main chat, all that stuff is available to everybody.
278.86s: And we'll roll with the punches as they come.
282.74s: But wanted to give you that update, the discord itself for now will be effectively in hibernation.
288.70s: So what that means is no new members will join.
290.82s: We are going to remove all existing members so that it's kind of just a quiet space.
296.34s: One of the reasons why is there was some recent events that I think lead us to believe that
305.22s: there's just a big focus on the discord, right?
308.66s: We're getting like literally dozens of scam accounts joining.
311.86s: So it's just too much to keep up with.
313.74s: All it takes is for one or two to get through.
317.22s: All right, that's enough about that.
319.98s: If you have any questions, just let me know.
321.74s: Hey, you all right.
322.74s: What up?
323.74s: Good to see you.
324.74s: Yeah, today was wild.
325.74s: I couldn't agree more.
326.74s: We had a fascinating, fascinating market behavior on the day.
330.78s: So if we take a look at SPX, I was actually trading zero DTEs today.
336.74s: And my entry time is favorable for stuff like this on days like today.
341.74s: We are on like the deep end of the range that I typically would want to enter before
348.62s: things start getting too hectic.
350.22s: The main reason for the entry today though was because the amount of premium collected
357.46s: really compensated genuinely for a decent bit of the risk as far as I assessed it.
364.14s: So I didn't mind it from that lens.
367.38s: But days like today are actually very difficult, I think, in general, because you can't see
373.78s: it coming.
374.78s: You have to position yourself as a way to take advantage of it as it's happening.
378.58s: But we'll talk through the move that we saw today.
381.38s: So let's move us in.
382.78s: Let's do like, we'll do one day five minutes.
387.10s: It's funny because one day includes today and yesterday, it's not like today.
393.06s: But here is effectively where you saw the market start to sell off big.
398.46s: So we opened the day, we were hovering around like 5910 ish on the open.
406.50s: And then we rallied a bits and then all of a sudden here, 955, we start to see a pretty
414.18s: big sell off.
415.98s: Now what are the guesses out there?
418.42s: Who has any ideas as to what might be part of this sell off?
426.14s: Now there's a few things that I've heard.
429.02s: I was recently talking to a coaching client that was talking about the Moody's rating,
434.94s: thinking that's part of it, which is a good guess.
436.74s: But what do you think?
437.74s: Why did the market start selling off here?
441.86s: The reason why I'm asking you this is actually way less to see who has the right quote-unquote
445.58s: right answer.
446.58s: It doesn't really matter.
448.30s: But the main reason I'm asking this is to see how people digest information.
455.74s: Lauren says 20-year bonds going up is what I saw.
458.42s: Jordan says Japan, the yield.
461.50s: Japan, I would consider that probably a looser attachment.
465.86s: I don't necessarily think that it's like wrong.
469.86s: I wouldn't call that wrong at all.
472.38s: Let's take a look at the news that came out at 944 and then 1009.
476.26s: Let's see what happens here.
478.50s: So at 944, which again, this is specific time.
481.98s: So it's 1244 Eastern time.
483.42s: That's what you see here.
485.58s: Equity index trade mixed after Google shares lifted NAS that composite.
491.46s: So tech doing decent.
494.26s: Google rolling out AI mold, which that looks actually pretty cool.
499.02s: This one yields on 30 year and 10 year treasury bonds rebounded above key thresholds that
505.06s: will the markets in April 30 year traded at 5.02 percent 10 year at 454.
512.22s: Okay.
513.22s: So we see that come through at 944.
517.02s: So let's take a look at again, what the market was doing at 944.
521.78s: And as you can tell, it's happy days.
523.78s: We're rallying everything here looks fine and dandy probably both fine and Andy.
529.94s: Then you can see the next news piece that we can take a look here at 1009.
534.22s: So 1009 puts us on this candle here when things start rolling over.
539.98s: So let's see what the news says says broad market exchange are lower actively traded
545.90s: Q's road point three equity index traded mixed after gains lifted technology financial.
553.14s: So the financial sector fell.
556.14s: So this is just kind of like generally high level information coming out.
563.46s: What are the guesses that we got Albuquerque says weak bond auction.
567.74s: That's an interesting one.
569.22s: I've heard that one being floated around as well.
573.74s: Each says.
576.98s: Bit connect.
579.66s: Violent moon says selling may go away selling may go ways.
584.54s: It's fun from a seasonality lens.
587.06s: I think it's a little less pertinent here.
589.98s: So let's look at one more news source and then let's talk about it.
593.66s: So here it says indices settled sharply lower falling to one week low.
599.70s: They retweeted Wednesday due to reduced attractiveness of US assets to foreign investors
605.90s: in the ongoing trade war.
608.02s: Last Friday's moody downgrade US credit rating negative US budget deficit outlook in the
613.70s: reconciliation bill losses and stocks accelerated Wednesday afternoon one week demand for the
620.26s: treasuries 16 billion 20 year T bond auction sent bond yields soaring with the 10 year note
628.38s: jumping 10 basis points to 4.59 percent.
632.06s: So what's going on?
636.30s: This is a quintessential example of supply and demand at work.
642.98s: That's exactly what you're seeing here.
646.02s: So the bond market the bond auctions are ongoing and funny enough most of the time people
654.66s: don't really hear or think much of them because they're just kind of going on and there's
660.46s: not much to it.
662.22s: However, always remember that there are a couple distinct time frames that we pay attention
669.34s: to as traders near term when we're talking about positioning.
673.54s: It's all about where the money is dollars and cents today right now.
677.50s: Where is it?
678.50s: So what happens is as people's perception of things change they position themselves
686.80s: differently positioning themselves differently means that we're taking money from some places
692.34s: and we're putting it in other places.
695.42s: So what you saw here was really important both from a geopolitical perspective but then
702.42s: also from a standard market perspective understanding how people are viewing debt and how they're
712.02s: positioning their money.
714.06s: So let's take a look at a couple bond futures here.
718.86s: So we'll do forward slash ZB.
722.78s: So for those that don't know there's different futures contracts that you can take a look
728.30s: at different duration bonds.
730.82s: So I'm going to throw a few of them up here for us eyeball.
736.70s: So we'll do that one.
737.82s: We'll do ZN.
741.82s: We'll do ZT.
749.10s: And then VIX is fine.
750.10s: We'll leave VIX up.
751.82s: What do you notice as we just generally look across the yield curve on the day?
759.14s: So we can see these are futures.
761.10s: So you have to use the candle before the after hours open which is this one.
764.58s: You have to use the candle before.
767.42s: So what do you notice?
769.14s: You notice that if you're taking a look at long term bonds right so if you're looking at
773.70s: ZB which is 30 year you can see that the 30 year fell pretty significantly yields obviously
781.46s: going up.
782.78s: And if you take a look at ZN you can see a similar story and then ZT.
789.38s: So what I'm going to do is actually use my box spread calculator tool because it also
797.50s: plots a yield curve which is.
801.18s: Copical for us right now.
804.02s: So I'm going to.
806.98s: Copy that really fast so that we can look at it together.
812.78s: I missed the pull on.
829.22s: Here we go.
835.62s: Okay.
837.58s: So the screenshot I'm going to show you actually I just paste it in.
845.18s: Or other little calculation sheet this one.
855.42s: So we have two different durations that we're looking at here.
861.22s: Well two different time frames I guess I should say.
864.98s: So the last that we updated that I updated this was on the sixth of May this is actually
871.34s: when I was looking for new box spread.
874.50s: And you can see what happened to the yield curve today and it's.
883.14s: It's actually really interesting.
885.98s: So broad changes because let me grab this.
892.98s: I've worn.
902.14s: I needed to finish updating.
905.94s: The title I don't know why.
920.26s: One sec trying to figure out what's wrong with the.
925.70s: Because you can see the labels are wrong the curve itself is fine but the labels are
930.50s: wrong.
932.62s: There we go.
934.62s: Okay.
935.62s: One sec.
938.62s: New version coming in with the correct numbers.
961.62s: Okay.
968.62s: So when we look at the yield curve there's different durations that have different meanings
976.62s: to us.
979.62s: And the liquidity in general.
983.62s: It doesn't matter.
984.62s: It's a lot because we use as a country debt as a super super important function or how
993.26s: we do things literally how we operate as a country.
997.98s: So when we start to see softening demand that's something that you have to pay attention
1004.38s: to you can't just look over that.
1007.14s: And as always back to the point I was making earlier supply and demand is always the ultimate
1013.46s: factor.
1014.46s: It's always ultimately what matters.
1017.50s: So what ended up happening here is during the auction we saw very very clearly weak demand
1025.22s: for the debt.
1026.78s: So then we have to see like okay based on that weak demand what what might it mean and
1034.02s: where's the demand weak.
1037.10s: We use a lot of longer term debt because it provides stability.
1041.86s: So if you take a look at the long end of the curve you'll notice that's where more of
1046.86s: the difference happened.
1049.18s: But then you'll also see that there's some near term inversion even very very slight
1056.58s: on something like 120.
1059.70s: So these different periods which is four months by the way.
1065.22s: These different periods are seeing really really very demand.
1071.06s: So the market is now pretty spooked based on what happened earlier today and this goes
1078.62s: back to a broader message I've shared a million times and I will happily share it for
1084.74s: a million and first.
1086.54s: And it's that the market is still so volatile.
1091.58s: It's so baked on what the next news cycle is what the latest tweet is what the newest thing
1098.82s: is because the entire market is so uneasy where things currently sit.
1105.98s: So with all of that as our general context and understanding a little bit more about
1110.34s: what happened today which really does amount to just softening demand for US debt.
1116.26s: That all aside.
1118.42s: Now let's take a look at what's happening within the broad market.
1123.46s: So if we take a look at the sectors themselves.
1127.50s: There's just a couple trends that are worth talking about utilities and industrials still
1133.22s: doing really really well tech is starting to recover slightly energy is still rolling
1139.50s: over healthcare is still rolling over healthcare is doing poorly.
1143.94s: Funny enough if we take a look at you and H.
1147.78s: UNH is at such an interesting price point here because we start selling off enough and
1156.22s: you can see effectively a couple of the ranges that I have flagged for myself that I'm interested
1162.62s: in and it's because I think there's potential here but it's kind of like.
1169.66s: Crouch strike it needs to find its base first.
1173.94s: Which it clearly hasn't yet.
1181.26s: And it looked like it was rowing up to the point of control but today's weakness took
1187.70s: that a little bit off.
1190.22s: Lauren says UNH being investigated for medical or Medicaid fraud which doesn't surprise me
1194.62s: at all.
1196.06s: And that's going to be like a big ugly thing that likely will impact others within the
1202.70s: industry that would be my expectation.
1205.90s: So a healthcare likely will look pretty soft.
1210.54s: Now that softness.
1214.26s: Generally comes from near term positioning and expectations on where we think the market
1220.54s: might go in the short term in the long term.
1224.66s: These kinds of things typically bear themselves out but that's where an interesting opportunity
1230.74s: lies for us as traders because they're very, very clearly is a gap between expected value
1241.94s: and where we sit now because when you see things move as much as they have here, it's
1248.82s: kind of like that same price dislocation we discussed earlier with respect to tariffs.
1254.54s: So here with this kind of price dislocation there's two ways to think about it.
1262.18s: There's the near term short term positioning style movement and then there's the longer
1267.62s: term idea because for people that trade things longer term, it still doesn't look terrible
1274.82s: longer term.
1275.82s: Now again, you have to take things for what they are.
1278.62s: These are weekly candles.
1280.82s: Doing H is effectively undone, five years of growth.
1285.74s: That's this is a five year chart.
1288.74s: So that's huge.
1293.14s: But depending on how the Medicaid and the investigation goes, that offers a significant
1300.90s: opportunity if things aren't as bad as the market is projecting.
1306.42s: If things are as bad or worse than projected, then you absolutely can see this just get
1312.38s: punished into the dirt.
1315.26s: But until that point, it's up for grabs.
1320.02s: If I were to think about it from a sentiment lens, I would have to imagine short side is
1325.78s: a safer bet unless there's some sort of really great piece of news that absolutely can cause
1330.62s: some sort of recovery.
1331.82s: But as always, we don't have to guess.
1334.66s: We literally can use the options markets to help us understand literally how the market
1340.26s: is positioning around it and use the collective wisdom of options.
1345.18s: So we literally don't have to guess.
1347.50s: So if you look over the last, really the last few days, but specifically the 20th and
1354.74s: the 21st, notice what's happening.
1357.46s: There's a massive steady growth of put premium, long put premium.
1363.34s: And then there's a steady decline of call premium into the short side.
1368.94s: And we're seeing really, really heavy short premium.
1372.58s: Now if we go out a month to see what this might have looked like before we started seeing
1376.82s: these events, what do you notice?
1379.30s: If we look at the chart on the 12th, and that was the 12th of year, let me grab 12 May
1389.34s: here.
1391.46s: So coming into this, this was very much earnings related.
1400.06s: And you can literally see that because the market absolutely was interested around earnings,
1405.94s: but then it quiets down.
1407.86s: There's not as much going on.
1409.82s: And then all of a sudden, when this next leg down occurs, the options markets absolutely
1416.78s: explode with long put volume and short call volume.
1421.62s: Now there is a little bit of a play on the short recovery that you see here, but take
1426.78s: a look at what that turned into on the day, nearly the third largest net short call
1431.94s: premium that we've seen.
1436.94s: This sort of, I don't know why I somehow can't manage to get fluid in my face without
1441.90s: spilling it.
1443.98s: Especially this stuff, because it has like electrolytes in it.
1451.90s: I can't be trusted around anything.
1458.34s: But it's like the third biggest decline that you see.
1462.46s: So the options market here is clearly showing their preference and where they're positioning.
1469.26s: So let's take a look really quick and see what jumps out at us from a longer term positioning.
1476.46s: A lot of near term volume.
1479.46s: Man, take a look at this one day, one day, one day.
1484.82s: And I mean, a decent amount of it is still being bought, which is short term expectations,
1494.22s: really short term expectations.
1497.42s: So it does look like from a super, super, super short term expectation.
1503.86s: It does look like people are trying to play it marginally to the upside.
1509.58s: Ah, take a look at that.
1511.86s: That's actually kind of bullish.
1515.02s: The fact that insiders stepped in that heavy when it's that low, that's actually kind
1520.14s: of a good thing.
1522.98s: It's surprising, but I do like to see that.
1530.22s: The reason why that matters is because it does start to show that insiders are looking
1534.74s: at the activity and saying it's getting beat down, but longer term, there's some sort
1542.10s: of comfort to the upside, which, yeah, I mean, you kind of like to see it.
1553.10s: Term structure knows no shock, absolutely jacked in the front.
1558.30s: Let's take a look at the options chain.
1571.30s: All right, so huge expansion of put a lie.
1579.50s: I don't think that's surprising.
1584.98s: Let's take a look at percent changes here.
1593.22s: A lot of heavy open interest in the front explorations.
1601.86s: So definitely still very much playing these near term moves.
1605.78s: There's two things that we can take away from this.
1609.54s: And it's that there's clearly a near term expectation of downside.
1616.54s: However, let's take a look at total, oh, I, here we go.
1620.38s: This is what we want.
1627.90s: It still leans bullish.
1630.30s: So people are playing the recovery.
1632.66s: And people are playing the recovery long term, right?
1639.34s: You can take a look at these.
1642.90s: And I mean, that's, you don't go out here unless you're expecting larger moves over time.
1654.78s: Most of these look like, you know, like moving these out, rolling them.
1660.54s: And then these look like positioning for the following month.
1663.86s: What are these?
1666.66s: 600 calls, 315s, sold net sold.
1676.34s: To mix back, it looks like I don't see a clear, a clear trend other than some level of general bullish expectation.
1688.06s: But it's spread all over the place.
1690.66s: And in the near term, notice how close these two are together, like in the really near term,
1696.22s: whereas when you go further out in time, you notice how big the difference is between calls and puts.
1701.30s: What it tells you is that there's, again, people trying to position based on different time frames,
1706.38s: but the consensus is clear further out in time, near term in time, it's not as clear.
1711.02s: That's effectively what this tells me.
1713.78s: A lot of activity in United Healthcare and the healthcare sector today.
1718.62s: Another one that would be interesting to take a look at was Google, real quick, or Google,
1724.62s: or, and then for those that are new to the streams and whatnot, we are kind of about halfway through maybe a
1733.90s: little more. So if there's anything that you want to take a look at, if you have any questions,
1738.38s: if you have specific stocks that you want to take a look at, now's a perfect time to start throwing
1743.34s: those in the chat and we can poke through those. But let's take a look here.
1752.54s: I just want to see what the options activity looks like. Huge call activity.
1762.78s: Let's add the L.
1768.54s: Even bigger. Yeah, huge call activity.
1778.54s: Look at this. 2.1 mill calls against 1.3 mill on the put side. People are expecting big things
1788.22s: from Google.
1801.18s: And I mean, the net is pretty bullish.
1808.86s: There's definitely some spots of puts that I see, but yeah, it's like pretty bullish.
1814.14s: Near term is really, really bullish. Take a look at that. That's literally two days.
1820.38s: What's the percent change on those? That's nuts. That's a really big change in the OI for
1829.66s: really near term options like this. So that's expectation of near term price movement.
1843.58s: Super interesting. Let's take a look.
1859.34s: Yeah, so by volume, pretty strong call build out.
1874.30s: Yeah, very, yeah, like very decisive to me, which is a little bit different.
1896.30s: And you can see that the call side activity is just jacking in the near term.
1903.98s: Cool. I'm going to pop the door for Thor and then we'll take a look at what you guys want.
1920.38s: Well, right, all right, all right. Dark Gen says TLT bonds. Looked.
1930.06s: It's a little too early to tell, I think, but I mean, to that end, I don't think like,
1936.78s: I don't like sitting in bonds anyways. So it's not something that I'm expecting any sort of like
1943.58s: big massive movement out of regardless. But I do think 20 year, I think longer term bonds are
1951.66s: definitely in a more tenuous position. I think it's a little more preferable to fade them to
1957.02s: the downside for very near term ideas. But these are the kind of things that as they're going down,
1963.10s: I absolutely try to leave breadcrumbs for signs of reversals. So things like just adding alerts
1971.74s: at spots like here, right, where I start to think that it might be rallying up back through
1979.18s: near term resistance because it's overall likely to occur. But the bond equity relationship
1986.86s: has just gotten so abused, miscontorted. I mean, take a look at it, right? Like as we go out far
1995.74s: enough, you can see that we're just at a point where bonds are getting crushed. So you can play
2005.42s: the yield, but I think near term, I would expect bonds probably to struggle. And let's see what
2014.78s: the options markets think. I see a lot of calls, a whole lot of calls. And I see a lot of calls
2021.90s: bought today. So this can start to become from a pot odds perspective where even though it does seem
2032.46s: generally negative, because it's starting to get to really low levels suppress, it's almost like
2039.18s: a value play. Like that's kind of what it becomes. Let's take a look at TLT.
2049.02s: Yeah, I mean, take a look at that pop in call volume, literally doubled. That doesn't just happen.
2056.38s: You don't just get like a doubling in call volume on nothing.
2060.94s: And total call premium jacked from 2634 or 4140, right? So like 30s on average to 74,
2071.02s: it effectively doubled. That's a big move. That's a really big move.
2082.06s: Let's take a look at, oh, yeah, look at that.
2085.34s: The 133s, where are those at? Those got to be in 16 Jan 26. Is that right? Let's find those.
2095.02s: The 133s.
2097.58s: Because that's a huge change.
2102.38s: I'm surprised. There they are right there. I was going to say, how are they not on this list?
2112.38s: That's so funny.
2130.46s: It's literally just acquiring units. They're so cheap. They're penny.
2135.98s: This is why when I'm doing a lot of unusual options activity scanning,
2147.10s: I generally overlay premium requirements. And it's for stuff like this, right?
2152.22s: So you can see that if we take a look at the day over day, yesterday's volume is 1080,
2157.10s: today, oh, I is 1118, right? So really, really big. It's over 1,000 percent change.
2162.54s: You're literally talking about something that is no shit, a penny.
2167.74s: The weight on that is not that much.
2170.94s: Like literally anybody could put that trade on for any reason.
2175.34s: I wouldn't consider that any highly informed trade that I would want to know what's going on.
2182.38s: It really doesn't matter to me because it's such a cheap trade.
2186.78s: You can't really decipher anything from it.
2189.26s: But it does look like the broader market is playing some of the upside.
2195.26s: The fact that so much of this is just bullshit that doesn't matter.
2199.42s: It's a little harder to tell what the skew near term. It does look like a little heavier
2205.66s: expectation to the downside. But like this, people are starting to cash out as well.
2213.74s: I mean, I don't blame them, right? Like you're getting the move.
2217.02s: So let's take a look really quick at buy expiration.
2225.10s: About flat, the 21st, 23rd,
2230.22s: favors call side, 20 June call side. So yeah, it does look like people are starting to speculate
2237.90s: to the upside here. Next from Albuquer, thoughts on RDDT.
2245.74s: It's funny because I think RDDT was a really interesting one. I've traded it a few times.
2251.18s: And it's because stuff like this with like IPOs and then just absolute mania around it.
2258.14s: It's kind of a fun trade. But the reality is that Goldilocks period starts to fade off.
2266.38s: So it's earnings. They came in at 13 cents. They were expected at two pennies.
2272.22s: So objectively great earnings release. But then you notice this.
2278.94s: Right? Like if they're so profitable, why would this happen? Well, it has to do with what they
2282.70s: talked about in the actual earnings release and the expectations that people have around it.
2288.78s: So let's take a look really quick. Reddit.
2292.06s: Earnings release. I'm actually interested. I didn't look at their quarterly results.
2296.54s: I traded them, but I didn't read them. So let's take a look at the actual release.
2306.30s: They should have... No, no.
2314.14s: Normally they have like an investor presentation that looks nicer than that.
2317.98s: I don't want the PDF. Hold on. Reddit investor.
2333.18s: These releases, quarterly results. No, it's the same thing.
2336.38s: Yeah. Literally the same exact thing. That sucks. It would be unlazy.
2349.50s: Fuckin' get some of the mods in there to do some shit. All right. Let's see.
2353.50s: So revenue 61% your over year. That's crazy. Gross margin 90.5. That's insane.
2361.10s: EBITDA 29.4% of revenue, which is solid. I mean, it looks good.
2370.14s: Complete financial results management commentary. Let's see what this is.
2376.22s: Let's do the transcript.
2381.66s: And then let's see what the video is.
2390.62s: Hmm.
2398.06s: I'll turn the sounds that you guys can listen to what it is.
2401.82s: And by Gen Wong, our system. So short, we're at a strong start to our second year as a public company.
2408.62s: And we are very grateful to be with you here today. Okay, we're going to go through the questions.
2413.82s: Number one for me. How is user engagement with Reddit answers? How do you see it evolving over time?
2420.46s: Okay, boring.
2423.98s: All right. Let's see. This will just be faster than listening to them.
2434.94s: I'm screening the questions right now because most of the questions suck.
2439.90s: Here we go. See, this is an interesting question. Like, what do they consider other revenue?
2445.98s: I had revenue and other other revenue consists from content licensing. I see.
2455.74s: So it's growing because it's small. Fine.
2463.58s: Um, indie to translations, new ad formats,
2470.22s: server outages, uh, these are terrible questions. What the fuck? That's so annoying.
2478.70s: I wanted some meat and potatoes around these questions. So anyways, since we can't get any decent
2485.74s: information from their freaking earnings release, the market clearly wasn't, wasn't happy with it,
2492.22s: though. That's super, super clear. Let's see if there's any just
2496.46s: uh, that was on the first.
2509.98s: So it closed at what? It closed at 116.
2515.50s: Opened up super strong and then it closed at like 118. So what happened on the day?
2526.54s: Let's see here.
2544.06s: All right, positive revenue trend net margin, which is good return on equity, which is good.
2550.46s: Yeah, so it's interesting because it's the case where like, there's nothing glaring at me.
2555.10s: That looks like awful, but clearly the market didn't like it. So going back to the original
2561.50s: question, though, on like oversold in time to sell puts, this is not where I would sell puts.
2566.54s: And it's for a few reasons. It's,
2571.18s: it's just recently broken down below this prior support level here.
2578.94s: And it's literally in a confirmed downtrend. Now, how it behaves as it gets down to like this level
2590.22s: is important to me, right? Like does it continue to break down? And then especially if it starts
2597.18s: tick like flirting with these lows. So if this were me, I would be way more interested in some sort of
2605.42s: volatility based neutral strategies. So like short strangle, something like that.
2611.82s: Just because it looks generally range bound, right? Like I can see a pretty clearly defined range
2619.50s: from like the 130 handle ish down to the 80 handle. So a big wide range. But if we take a look at
2628.06s: what the options change shows us for that. So down to the 80 handles like 20 delta. So you could
2636.22s: do something a little more aggressive like 85 handle, which is a 30 delta. And then to the upside,
2643.42s: I mean, we see the near term peaks of that at like 128, which puts you way, way, way, way,
2650.46s: way out of the money. So vol isn't quite as high out this far. So it looks like the expectation
2657.58s: is that range is going to contract a little bit. But it looks super range bound to me. So that's
2662.54s: the kind of thing where I might consider like a short strangle and then roll the strangle as it moves,
2668.22s: specifically trying to trail the rebalance it. But yeah, it's because it'll likely have some risk
2675.82s: premium as it's going through here. It's early to tell right because 30 day risk premium will be
2679.66s: negative. But future risk premium might might trend a little bit better.
2683.74s: Robert Clark says, Bull has some pretty great premiums. I've had good luck with CSPs. Let's see. Bull.
2698.62s: I mean, it looks awful. I can see the interest in selling premium because it has 120% IV. And it really
2710.38s: does seem to have a pretty defined floor, which my guess is this will be baked into the options
2717.10s: market. It does have earnings coming up. Let's take a look at what the options look like. Yeah.
2723.82s: So you start to run out of liquidity below like the 11 handle. But I mean, it has a decent floor
2731.90s: baked in, right? Since it's already so cheap.
2740.86s: Yeah. And it has earnings on the 20 seconds. I mean, yeah, I can see the allure for stuff like this,
2753.66s: especially if you have a small account where you can get decent premiums because that's absolutely
2757.98s: the case here. So if we take a look, we can see that I mean, literally for an 11 strike,
2764.62s: which is a 27 Delta, you're getting like 90 cents. That's crazy. For those that don't know,
2773.98s: one of the ways that you can kind of ballpark what this whole thing looks like, I'll literally show
2783.18s: you.
2794.86s: So let's take what is this the 11s. And then let's do what's the premium. Let's call it like 90 cents.
2809.58s: You literally can build like a little calculator for yourself. So here we'll have strike, we'll have premium.
2815.98s: We'll have
2821.10s: have
2824.06s: X-PRI.
2833.50s: So the X-PRI on these is 20 June.
2843.66s: And then we could do like lot size. So it just doesn't really matter what the lot size is for
2848.22s: the sake of this conversation. But so then let's do some basic math. So the first one is let's say
2855.66s: you're doing a cash secured, which it's just a good comparison to use cash secured versus something
2863.18s: like margin. But you don't have to, right? You could put whatever the margin requirement is this,
2869.02s: we could just easily calculate the cash secured amount, which is just your strike times lot times one
2875.18s: Hyundai, step-by-fuck something up. So strike times your lot times multiplier, which is 100. So it'll
2883.82s: tell you obviously how much you need in order to secure the position. Then we can calculate days
2893.18s: to expiration from whenever the entry was. So today is 21 May.
2913.18s: Days to expiration, X-PRI minus entry, 30 days.
2918.54s: You can calculate the premium. In this case, the credit collected or the, I guess you still would say
2927.58s: that credit. How would you say this? CREDT. CREDT.
2939.10s: Feel like even though it's misspelled, you still get to the same spot. That's kind of cool.
2948.06s: And credit here is your premium times lot times 100. Then you can calculate what your
2959.98s: relic is.
2967.26s: Relic is simply the credit you get divided by how much money you have to put up.
2973.02s: So in this case, you're making 8.2% and again, this is a 30-day trade.
2983.50s: So then you can annualize your return.
2987.18s: You can either do trading days or actual calendar days.
3017.66s: So then you can literally have your output of what the annualized return is.
3026.94s: Which is, I mean, I think pretty impressive. Because when you have stuff that's super,
3035.18s: super volatile, you can get an insane return on your money, right? So 8.2% over the course of a month
3044.22s: is really good. However, there's obviously risk, but this clearly has a floor baked in.
3055.02s: So for a developed account, this is not where I would go, but for a small account, I totally get it.
3062.06s: The other thing that might be considered is even selling like a call spread. With this recent
3070.30s: squeeze up to 80, I wouldn't want to necessarily hold naked short calls because getting a sign during
3078.22s: one of those can be kind of annoying. But yeah, definitely there's a lot of premium here.
3084.22s: The thing I like more about this compared to other things that I've seen is if there's really high
3090.94s: premium, but you're not near a perceived floor, that becomes more problematic. But again,
3096.62s: like let's say that you do get this for 90 cents, you can literally size your trade so that
3104.86s: you're considering it going to zero, right? And that's obviously hyper conservative. It's not what
3111.98s: I would do, but what I mean is to give you like a reference on how you can conceptualize something
3118.54s: that's as volatile as this. But there's a million things you would do before it got to zero.
3124.62s: So it's the kind of thing where like if it starts falling well below where you think support is,
3130.06s: you can either always close your trade, you can open up puts by the puts at that point that are
3135.58s: further out at the time of entry, you could buy really, really cheap wings for something like this.
3140.86s: If I had a small account, that's exactly what I would do because you can get super cheap wings
3145.42s: way out here, right? So down at the five, you can grab them for a nickel, right? So then you take your
3153.26s: credit received down to 87 from 92. And then if we take a look at the risk profile compared to the
3159.90s: naked put compared to the spread here, you can see that you're capping your risk at half of what it
3164.78s: would be if it went to zero, you're not really taking that much off the profit side, right? Like
3170.14s: you're literally losing three cents from 92. That's a trivial expense. This is an example where I
3176.62s: think a spread makes a ton of sense. This is a really good application for a vertical spread.
3181.26s: So you can do this also on the call side, right, or combine them into a condor. So I actually think
3187.82s: this is chill. Like I really don't mind, I don't mind the idea here at all. I get it. It's always
3195.34s: going to be a little more suboptimal than what I would otherwise try to do, but yeah, I mean,
3205.98s: I get it. So viable, definitely call it viable. Big thing is make sure you have a decent
3211.82s: management plan to the downside because stuff that is this volatile and essentially with earnings
3217.98s: coming up. I don't know if it has it reported earnings before, it doesn't look like it,
3227.10s: but I don't know what their last earnings look like. Was this from earnings? No, it wasn't.
3232.22s: All right. Lauren says I have a few calls and sq's I could afford q puts. So sq's is fine.
3248.22s: I'm always curious what leads you into calls and sq's versus either using
3258.86s: tq's or just q's for your idea. Like why sq's here?
3270.22s: Oh, it says I couldn't afford q puts. I see. Yeah. So then what led you to sq's versus tq's?
3281.26s: Affordability. Okay. I get it. The other thing to pay attention to that I'm asking the question
3289.90s: because it's a good general lesson for people is let's take a look at a comparative position because
3296.06s: it's I think a pretty good example. So if we look at sq's and let's say that we wanted to get
3304.54s: short tech, let's say that you want to buy in at the money call that is 50 delta 30 days out,
3314.70s: just grabbing an example. The volume is 69.9, or 69.8%. So pretty high volume. Let's track that
3327.18s: here. So this is 30 DTE. We're looking at 50 delta on the nose and our vol is 69.82.
3340.78s: And what is the premium for the call mid point 174? Let's call it 175. So here we have delta
3351.74s: here. We have vol here. We have premium.
3364.94s: Okay. So this is example one. This is using sq's. Now let's take a look at tq's. And I want to show
3373.82s: you how to compare the relative cost of a similar size position, which we are going to have to
3381.02s: cost or price adjust. So this is 2456. The reason why the 2456 matters is because we're going to have
3391.58s: to normalize the delta's a little bit. So this will be ticker. And then this will be price,
3403.58s: spot price. So what we can do is we can normalize whatever our delta's are against the spot price.
3416.54s: Right. So what I mean by that is if we take a one lot,
3418.94s: we can say your delta's here, your 50 delta's on something that's 25 bucks.
3437.10s: And this is literally just to normalize it. You can also divide it. This doesn't matter
3450.30s: literally at all. All that matters here is that you have something that's made relative to the price.
3457.58s: So now let's take a look at tq's. And there's an example you'll see here in a second.
3466.62s: So let's take a look at the same 50 delta's that puts you at the 70.
3476.78s: So spot price and tq's is 6794.
3483.34s: Delta is 0.51. So you're getting a little bit more. Volatility on these is 64.75.
3491.66s: It looks like 0.74. So we'll call it 64.7 premium 5.85 size one.
3504.30s: So you can figure out what your same size delta's are. So in this case, you'd be way too big
3511.02s: using 51 delta's on something like this. So you have to go cheaper. So here instead,
3515.98s: you might say maybe I'll go to like a 25 delta. That puts me closer. After that, we have a 23 delta.
3528.06s: puts me closer 21 delta. Closer still 19 delta. Right about right.
3538.54s: So then what we can do is we can figure out the comparative cost relative to the delta's that we're
3543.50s: getting. So all I would do, again, it doesn't matter what you do, as long as you standardize it to
3549.34s: give yourself effectively a ratio to figure out how expensive the delta's are. So the interesting thing
3558.06s: here is that I need to adjust the price. So for the, what do we do? The 19 delta's, these are
3566.38s: $1.67.
3574.30s: So you can see these are actually cheaper, even though you're paying for puts, even though you're
3587.58s: paying for puts, you know, this doesn't, this doesn't take into account.
3596.70s: Changes involve in the ball curve and stuff like that. But it's effectively a way to make
3601.66s: a same same comparison between two leveraged ETFs that look at the same thing, but from different
3606.86s: angles, long side, short side. And then you can come up with the decision, do I want to buy calls
3612.30s: on one or do I want to buy puts on the other? This effectively gives you a way to analyze it. So
3621.18s: voila. Skyshadex says, but does it consider spreads and liquidity? I find those leverage ETFs have
3629.74s: insanely large spreads so much that it's almost easier to just trade the underlying.
3634.30s: Not so much. They're absolutely going to be wider, but in terms of like getting the total exposure,
3641.26s: what you pay on the spread is still probably cheaper than putting on the same size position in
3646.38s: the underlying ETF. So we'll look at an example before I pop off. So Skyshadex, do we want to look at
3653.02s: an example of being long the leverage ETF? Or do we want to look at being short the leverage ETF?
3662.70s: I just want to create effectively the same position between them. We'll just use TQs and Qs.
3669.98s: And I'll build, I'll start building like a little track or based on which scenario we want to look at.
3675.42s: So QQQ, TQs.
3682.14s: All right. So let's say that we want to be long something.
3689.82s: So let's say that we have a $10,000 account.
3694.46s: And we want to, well, not a $10,000 account, but let's say a $10,000 allocation, I should say.
3700.14s: And we want to be long the same in these. And we want to use options for both.
3706.06s: So maybe we'll do what short puts to get our synthetic exposure. So in Qs, our price is 513,
3716.30s: 0, 4, we'll do 30 days, just because. And let's do standard 30 delta-ish.
3729.18s: So we'll do size, we'll continue. We'll just do a one lot to start, because it doesn't matter for
3734.94s: the example. I don't know why I said a $10,000 allocation, because it literally doesn't matter at all.
3739.58s: Size, strike price on these is going to be $498.
3745.50s: Premium on these.
3750.38s: Let's do bid and offer bid ask. So the bid on these is $734.
3760.46s: The ask is $741.
3762.30s: Okay. We have most of what we need to then just do the math here. So first thing,
3775.26s: let's standardize the format.
3782.22s: Beautiful. And first things first, oh, we need the delta. Oh, I'm an idiot. I already said a 30 delta.
3790.70s: That goes here.
3796.70s: 0.3.
3801.02s: Okay.
3803.90s: So now, first things, let's figure out the bid ask spread.
3807.42s: Excuse me, Gemini formula.
3810.94s: And in order to make this same same, we take the bid ask spread divided by the strike price.
3820.54s: So we can figure out what it is relative. So this is super, super tight on a relative basis.
3833.90s: That tightness is difficult to track because sometimes people look at it as a gross metric,
3841.74s: which is a big mistake. It's very, very different and you have to look at it differently.
3847.18s: So now, let's use the $10,000 account. Let's say that we're trying to get a $10,000 allocation.
3853.42s: So we can literally figure out lots required.
3858.94s: Lots size required for this.
3862.22s: All we do is we take our $10,000, we take our $10,000, we divide it by our strike price.
3875.02s: We're going to have to go up and money. I'm going to make it like a $50,000 account.
3881.18s: Something like that.
3884.46s: This is because you can't even cash secure one of these.
3890.30s: So anyways, we want that divided by that times 100.
3899.34s: And then we can essentially figure out what lot size we need.
3904.86s: So here, make this just a number.
3909.42s: And let's make this $50,000.
3915.66s: So you essentially need a one lot. So now, what we can do is we can figure out what our total
3925.98s: exposure is with respect to deltas. So what this means is I know that this provides one times leverage.
3946.06s: So this will be leverage. So this is one times, this is three times.
3951.74s: So there's really nothing to be done here, right? Your deltas are what they are.
3959.82s: So your total underlying base deltas that you have in this are literally this.
3969.26s: Size times delta times 100 times your leverage factor, which is one.
3987.90s: So you're getting 30 underlying deltas. Simple. Okay, so now let's take a look at TQs. We'll fill
3994.06s: the same thing in. I'm going to leave it off to the side just so that I can fill it in faster.
4007.10s: 6794. Strike price, we need 30 delta. We don't really need a 30 delta. I'm picking a 30 delta here
4015.10s: to create an equivalent, but you'll see what I mean in a moment. So strike price is 63. Delta is also
4022.46s: 30 on the nose, which is nice. 2.73. 3.05.
4038.46s: Okay. So now there's an important change that happens here.
4047.02s: So this one needs to be locked.
4058.54s: So if we want to use $50,000, we can figure out how to use $50,000. In this case, you effectively need
4066.46s: seven. However, if we take a look at the like comparison deltas, it's actually a completely
4074.30s: different story because if we take a look at notional value, our notional value is simply our deltas
4086.78s: times current price. This is our notional value.
4090.94s: So this has a massively wider spread, literally 0.51. Huge comparative spread. However,
4110.46s: what we can sort out is what are the total deltas that these provide. So this is using the
4120.06s: underlying price. However, there's a leverage factor that needs to be applied to this.
4135.42s: So you can see even though you have a wider bit as spread, you're literally getting more exposure
4144.30s: for the same position. When you're trading a small account, it doesn't really matter because
4150.38s: you're trading one lot where this becomes relevant is when you're trading a big account. And you're
4156.22s: having to put on larger positions. So let's say instead that this was $250,000 allocation.
4165.10s: And let's say that you wanted to use $250,000. Well, in order to put on the $250,000
4173.10s: position, we can see what we would need here. We need a five lot. So if we throw the five lot on,
4179.58s: we need more than that. Why hold on, my math's fucked up.
4185.50s: Strike.
4189.90s: And oh, hold on, what's my cash secured? I don't have that on suck.
4203.42s: Okay.
4213.90s: So this is the cash secured element. And we can update the
4224.62s: notional value. What did I do for this? I just did spot deltas.
4232.94s: So you can do it instead of off of spot deltas. We'll do it off of the actual notional value.
4241.58s: So this literally is just cash secured put requirement times your leverage factor.
4248.38s: So here we know that we have to put on a five lot to get that $250,000 of exposure. Here we know
4258.30s: that we're going to have to put on a decent bigger position. We're going to have to put on a 39
4266.14s: lot. And this is if you're using like like size, right? Wanting to use $250,000. But notice the
4275.74s: difference. What happened to our notional value? Our notional value just freaking skyrocketed.
4281.42s: It's actually way too high. The reason why it's so high is because the notional value that we're
4287.50s: calculating is using the overall size of the position. So there's a leverage factor that we have
4293.98s: to apply to this. So you notice how if you use the same amount of money, you get a massively larger
4301.26s: position. So what this means is you can actually put on a much smaller position to get a similar
4307.18s: notional value. Now again, you can just do the math or you can just kind of eyeball it.
4314.06s: So you need about 13 contracts in order to get there. So then you are still paying. You have to
4320.78s: put on a bigger position with a bitter, big ass spread. So then you might be saying, well, this
4325.42s: seems more efficient. Well, here's the thing. In this one, you're sitting on way more cash.
4333.02s: You're sitting on $167,000 of cash. So if you put this into something that gives you the risk-free
4339.98s: rate, you can absolutely make more money than you lose on the comparative spread.
4347.98s: That's the idea. And I mean, we can bear that out, right? Because the bitter ass spread is just
4353.98s: going to be relative to this amount of money. So yeah, the way I look at it is there's a little more
4363.02s: to the equation than just whether or not something is straight up more or less liquid than something
4369.50s: else because there's a little more that goes into the math. Now, all that being said, it's always
4375.10s: better to trade things that are liquid. But that also being said, it's not necessarily a reason to
4381.82s: write off stuff that isn't ideally liquid, depending on the strategy that you're trading.
4387.50s: Because for example, if I was trading something that's like really, really high turn, I wouldn't be
4392.54s: enthused to do that here. I would actually just go into futures because they're super liquid and
4397.98s: they're way more leverage than any of this. Right? So there's another way to think about it. It
4404.30s: really depends on the strategy that you're trying to use. The broader point is I wouldn't, you know,
4410.54s: things are flexible, depending on what the what the goal is. But yeah, that's hopefully the general
4416.70s: idea is useful. Or else is Bitcoin hitting all time highs? Yeah, no, I do trade Bitcoin. I trade
4427.66s: spot and then I also trade the coverage triangle in bit O. So or I'm sorry, an I bit, not bit O,
4435.90s: bit O's trash, I bit. So yeah, the way to look at it is I bit, it's effectively spot,
4444.46s: right? Because they hold the physical Bitcoin. But that's more of a long term play.
4449.74s: Skyshadex says, yeah, I'm on the higher turn over side. So not so much. But if I was in Leaps
4455.02s: or something, different story, well, that's the thing, right? Because if you're in a higher turn over
4459.50s: side, then you actually can still be way better off. Again, depending on what the strategy
4466.70s: is, because if you're doing things that are shorter term, you can consistently use less money.
4473.26s: And the cool thing with leverage DTFs is that they're going to be more liquid the closer you are
4478.30s: in time. So if it's higher turn stuff, then you're you're actually walking into some advantages.
4484.54s: Because if it were designed for longer term exposure, that's actually where it gets a little
4490.14s: more dicey. All right, gang, that wraps me up for tonight. As always, great catching up.
4499.50s: I'm not positive if there will be a Friday stream or not TBD. But as always, if you guys
4505.26s: need anything, let me know being outlier. See you all later.
