 you you you you unreadminated We are now all on the Patreon, which is not really the route that we wanted to go. We prefer to stay on Discord, but the problem is that there are a prolific amount of scammers and from an admin level. It is a significant burden to try to continually scrape them out. It takes a ton of time and effort. So by moving over to the Patreon, we decrease the risk because they're not allowed. Nobody's allowed to DM one another. So it gets rid of that ability to scam people behind their backs, trying to pretend to be people that whole thing. And for those that are wondering, there's still a completely free, several sections to the community. So there's literally no change there. It's just a slightly different change in terms of just where the community is. And some of the built-in capabilities, again, the Patreon capability isn't exactly what I would want long-term. My goal is to hibernate the Discord and then when Discord eventually fixes this problem, then I would love nothing more than to move us back. But until then, I just threw a link to the chat. You can sign up for free there again. That's one of my primary missions is to offer a space that I wish I had when I first started trading. And I fully acknowledge and understand that there are people that are newer in their path that just literally do not have the disposable income to pay for a community. And I get that. So the downside to that is with a community that's open to everybody. It's free for scammers and stuff like that to join in. It's 100% return on investment, right? So it does have some of those unfortunate components tied to it. So when we get a solution in Discord, we'll migrate back. But until then, we're just popping over. We're now operating out of the Patreon. And like I said, if you have any questions, let me know. It's still completely free to join. You can see that there's a handful of chats. There's still the beginner chat. The main chat, all that stuff is available to everybody. And we'll roll with the punches as they come. But wanted to give you that update, the Discord itself for now will be effectively in hibernation. So what that means is no new members will join. We are going to remove all existing members so that it's kind of just a quiet space. One of the reasons why is there was some recent events that I think lead us to believe that there's just a big focus on the Discord, right? We're getting literally dozens of scam accounts joining. So it's just too much to keep up with. All it takes is for one or two to get through. All right, that's enough about that. If you have any questions, just let me know. Hey, yo, Lauren, what up? Good to see you. Yeah, today was wild. I couldn't agree more. We had a fascinating, fascinating market behavior on the day. So if we take a look at SPX, I was actually trading zero DTEs today. And my entry time is favorable for stuff like this on days like today. But we are on like the deep end of the range that I typically would want to enter before things start getting too hectic. The main reason for the entry today though was because the amount of premium collected, really compensated genuinely for a decent bit of the risk as far as I assessed it. So I didn't mind it from that lens. But days like today are actually very difficult, I think, in general. Because you can't see it coming. You have to position yourself as a way to take advantage of it as it's happening. But we'll talk through the move that we saw today. So let's move us in. Let's do like, we'll do one day, five minutes. It's funny because one day includes today and yesterday, it's not like today. Here is effectively where you saw the market start to sell off big. So we opened the day, we were hovering around like 5910 ish on the open. And then we rallied a bits and then all of a sudden here, 955, we start to see a pretty big sell off. Now, what are the guesses out there? Who has any ideas as to what might be part of this sell off? Now, there's a few things that I've heard. I was recently talking to a coaching client that was talking about the Moody's rating, thinking that's part of it, which is a good guess. But what do you think? Why did the market start selling off here? The reason why I'm asking you this is actually way less to see you as the right, quote unquote, right answer. It doesn't really matter. But the main reason I'm asking this is to see how people digest information. Lauren says 20 year bonds going up is what I saw. Jordan says, Japan, the yield. Japan, I would consider that probably a looser attachment. I don't necessarily think that it's like wrong. I wouldn't call that wrong at all. But let's take a look at the news that came out at 944 and then 1009. Let's see what happens here. So at 944, which again, this is specific time. So it's 1244 Eastern time. That's what you see here. Equity index trade mixed after Google shares lifted NAS that composite. So tech doing decent. Google rolling out AI mold, which that looks actually pretty cool. This one yields on 30 year and 10 year treasury bonds rebounded above key thresholds that will the markets in April 30 year traded at 5.02%. 10 year at 4.54. Okay. So we see that come through at 944. So let's take a look at again, what the market was doing at 944. And as you can tell, it's happy days. We're rallying everything here looks fine and dandy probably both fine and dandy. Then you can see the next news piece that we can take a look here at 1009. So 1009 puts us on this candle here when things start rolling over. So let's see what the news says. Says broad market exchange are lower actively traded. Q's road point three equity index traded mixed after gains lifted. Technology financial. So the financial sector fell. So this is just kind of like generally high level information coming out. What are the guesses that we got Alba courses week bond auction. That's an interesting one. I've heard that one being floated around as well. H says. Bit connect. Violent moon says selling may go away selling may go ways. It's fun from a seasonality lens. I think it's a little less pertinent here. So let's look at one more news source and then let's talk about it. So here it says indices settled sharply lower falling to one week low. They retweeted when's they do to reduced attractiveness of US assets to foreign investors in the ongoing trade war. Last Friday's moody downgrade US credit rating negative US budget deficit outlook in the reconciliation bill. Losses and stocks accelerated Wednesday afternoon one week demand for the treasuries 16 billion 20 year T bond auction sent bond yields soaring. With the 10 year note jumping 10 basis points to 4.59 percent. So what's going on. This is a quintessential example of supply and demand at work. That's exactly what you're seeing here. So the bond market the bond auctions are ongoing and funny enough most of the time people don't really hear or think much of them because they're just kind of going on and there's not much to it. However, always remember that there are a couple distinct time frames that we pay attention to as traders near term when we're talking about positioning. It's all about where the money is dollars and cents today right now. Where is it? So what happens is as people's perception of things change the position themselves differently. Pitting themselves differently means that we're taking money from some places and we're putting it in other places. So what you saw here was really important both from a geopolitical perspective, but then also from a standard market perspective understanding how people are viewing debt and how they're positioning their money. So let's take a look at a couple bond futures here. So we'll do forward slash ZB. So for those that don't know, there's different futures contracts that you can take a look at different duration bonds. So I'm going to throw a few of them up here for us, eyeball. So we'll do that one. We'll do ZN. We'll do ZT. And then VIX is fine. We'll leave VIX up. What do you notice as we just generally look across the yield curve on the day? So we can see these are futures. So you have to use the candle before the after hours open, which is this one. You have to use the candle before. So what do you notice? You notice that if you're taking a look at long term bonds, right? So if you're looking at ZB, which is 30 year, you can see that the 30 year fell pretty significantly yields obviously going up. Then if you take a look at ZN, you can see a similar story and then ZT. So what I'm going to do is actually use my box spread calculator tool because it also plots a yield curve, which is. Copical for us right now. So I'm going to. Copy that really fast so that we can look at it together. I missed the pull on. Here we go. Okay. So the screenshot I'm going to show you actually I just paste it in. Or other little calculation sheet. So. We have two different durations that we're looking at here. Well, two different time frames, I guess I should say. So the last that we updated that I updated this was on the sixth of May. This is actually when I was looking for new box spread. And you can see what happened to the yield curve today. And it's. It's actually really interesting. The broad changes because let me grab. This. I've. I needed to finish updating. The title. I don't know why. I'm going to. Because you can see the labels are wrong the curve itself is fine. But the labels are wrong. There we go. Okay. New version coming in with the correct numbers. Here. Okay. So when we look at the yield curve, there's different durations that have different meanings to us. And the liquidity in general. Also matters in lot because we use as a country debt as a super super important function. Or how we do things literally how we operate as a country. So when we start to see softening demand that's something that you have to pay attention to, you can't just look over that. And as always back to the point I was making earlier supply and demand is always the ultimate factor. It's always ultimately what matters. So what ended up happening here is during the auction, we saw very, very clearly week demand for the debt. So then we have to see like, okay, based on that week demand, what what might it mean and where's the demands week. We use a lot of longer term debt because it provides stability. So if you take a look at the long end of the curve, you'll notice that's where more of the difference happened. But then you'll also see that there's some near term inversion even very, very slight on something like 120. So these different periods, which is four months, by the way. These different periods are seeing really, really very demand. So the market is now pretty spooked based on what happened earlier today. And this goes back to a broader message. I've shared a million times and I will happily share it for a million and first. And it's that the market is still so volatile. It's so baked on what the next news cycle is, what the latest tweet is, what the newest thing is because the entire market is so big. Because the entire market is so uneasy where things currently sit. So with all of that as our general context and understanding a little bit more about what happened today, which really does amount to just softening demand for US debt. That all aside. Now let's take a look at what's happening within the broad market. So if we take a look at the sectors themselves, there's just a couple trends that are worth talking about utilities and industrials still doing really, really well tech is starting to recover slightly energy is still rolling over health care is still rolling over health care is doing poorly. Funny enough, if we take a look at you and H. You and H is at such an interesting price point here because we start selling off enough and you can see effectively a couple of the ranges that I have flagged for myself that I'm interested in. And it's because I think there's potential here, but it's kind of like. Crowd strike, it needs to find its base first. Which it clearly hasn't yet. And it looked like it was rallying up to the point of control, but today's weakness took that a little bit off. Lauren says you and H being investigated for medical or Medicaid fraud, which doesn't surprise me at all. And that's going to be like a big ugly thing that likely will impact others within the industry that would be my expectation. So health care likely will look pretty soft. Now that softness. Generally comes from near term positioning and expectations on where we think the market might go in the short term in the long term. These kinds of things typically bear themselves out, but that's where an interesting opportunity lies for us as traders because they're very, very clearly is a gap between expect. And where we sit now because when you see things move as much as they have here, it's kind of like that same price dislocation we discussed earlier with respect to tariffs. So here. With this kind of price dislocation, there's two ways to think about it. There's the near term short term positioning style movement. And then there's the longer term idea because for people that trade things longer term, it still doesn't look terrible longer term. Now again, you have to take things for what they are. These are weekly candles. UNH is effectively undone. Five years of growth like that's this is a five year chart. So that's huge. But depending on how the Medicaid and the investigation goes, that offers a significant opportunity. If things aren't as bad as the market is projecting, if things are as bad or worse than projected, then you absolutely can see this just get punished into the dirt. But until that point, it's up for grabs. If I were to think about it from a sentiment lens, I would have to imagine. Is a safer bet unless there's some sort of really great piece of news that absolutely can cause some sort of recovery. But as always, we don't have to guess we literally can use the options markets to help us understand literally how the market is positioning around it and use the collective wisdom of options. So we literally don't have to guess. So the last really the last few days, but specifically the 20th and the 21st notice what's happening. There's a massive steady growth of put premium long put premium. And then there's a steady decline of call premium into the short side. And we're seeing really, really heavy short premium. So in the last month to see what this might have looked like before we started seeing these events, what do you notice? If we look at the chart on the 12th. And that was the 12th of year. Let me grab. Yeah, 12 May. Here. This was very much earnings related. And you can literally see that because the market absolutely was interested around earnings, but then it quiet down. There's not as much going on. And then all of a sudden when this next leg down occurs. The options markets absolutely explode with long put volume in short call volume. So a bit of a play on the on the short recovery that you see here, but take a look at what that turned into on the day. Nearly the third largest net short call premium that we've seen. This sort of I don't know why I somehow can't manage to get fluid in my face without spilling it. Especially this stuff, because I was like electrolytes in it. I can't be trusted around anything. But it's like the third biggest decline that you see. So the options market here is is clearly showing their preference. And where they're positioning. So let's take a look really quick and see what jumps out at us from a longer term positioning. A lot of near term volume. Man, take a look at this one day, one day, one day. And. I mean a decent amount of it is still being bought, which is short term expectations. Really short term expectations. So it does look like from a super, super, super short term expectation. It does look like people are trying to play it. Marginally to the upside. Take a look at that. That's actually kind of bullish. The fact that insider stepped in that heavy when it's that low. That's actually kind of a good thing. It's surprising, but. I do like to see that the reason why that matters is because it does start to show that. Insiders are looking at the activity and saying. It's getting beat down, but longer term. There's some sort of comfort to the upside, which. Yeah, I mean, I you kind of like to see it. Term structure knows no shock. Absolutely jacked in the front. Let's take a look at. The options chain. All right, so huge. Expansion of put a lie. I don't think that. I don't think that's. I'm not sure if it's surprising. Let's see look at percent changes here. A lot of heavy open interest in the front expirations. So definitely still very much playing these near term moves. There's two things that we can take away from this. And there's clearly a near term expectation of downside. However, let's take a look at total. Oh, I here we go. This is what we want. It's still leans bullish. So people are playing the recovery. And people are playing the recovery long term. So you can take a look at these. And I mean, that's. You don't go out here unless you're expecting larger moves over time. Most of these look like, you know, like moving these out. Rolling them. And then these look like positioning for the following month. What are these? 600 calls, three, 15s. Sold net sold. To mix back, it looks like I don't see a clear, a clear trend other than some level of general. Bullish expectation. But it's spread all over the place. And so, you know, the near term notice how close these two are together, like in the really near term. Whereas when you go further out in time, notice how big the differences between calls and puts. What it tells you is that there's again, people trying to position based on different time frames, but the consensus is clear further out in time near term in time. It's not as clear. That's effectively what this tells me. Lot of activity in United health care and the health care sector today. That would be interesting to take a look at was a Google real quick or Google L either or. And then for those that are new to the streams and whatnot, we are kind of about halfway through maybe a little more. So if there's anything that you want to take a look at, if you have any questions, if you have specific stocks that you want to take a look at. Now's a perfect time to start throwing those in the chat and we can poke through those. But let's take a look here. I just want to see what the options activity. Looks like. Huge call activity. And let's add. Let's add the L. Even bigger. Huge call activity. Look at this 2.1 mil calls against 1.3 million to put side people are expecting big things from Google. And I mean the net is pretty bullish. There's definitely some spots of puts that I see, but yeah, it's like pretty bullish. Near term is really, really bullish. Take a look at that. That's literally two days. What's the percent change on those? That's nuts. That's a really big change in the OI for really near term options like this. So that's expectation of near term price movement. Super interesting. Let's take a look. Yeah, so by volume. Pretty strong call build out. Very, yeah, like very decisive to me. Which is a little bit different. And you can see that the call side activity is just jacking in the near term. Cool. I'm going to pop the door for Thor and then we'll take a look at what you guys want. Right. All right, all right, all right. Dark Jen says TLT bonds. Looked. It's a little too early to tell, I think, but I mean to that end, I don't think like I don't like sitting in bonds anyways. So it's not something that I'm expecting any sort of like big massive movement out of regardless. But I do think 20 year, I think longer term bonds are definitely in a more tenuous position. I think it's a little more preferable to fade them to the downside for very near term ideas. But these are the kind of things that as they're going down, I absolutely try to leave breadcrumbs for signs of reversals. So things like just adding alerts at spots like here, right, where I start to think that it might be rallying up back through near term resistance because it's overall likely to occur. But the bond equity relationship has just gotten so abused, miscontorted. I mean, take a look at it, right? Like as we go out far enough, you can see that we're just at a point where bonds are getting crushed. So you can play the yield, but I think near term, I would expect bonds probably to struggle. And let's see what the options markets think. I see a lot of calls, a whole lot of calls. And I see a lot of calls bought today. So this can start to become from a pot odds perspective where even though it does seem generally negative because it's starting to get to really low levels, suppress. It's almost like a value play. Like that's kind of what it becomes. Let's take a look at TLT. Yeah, I mean, take a look at that pop in call volume literally doubled. That doesn't just happen. You don't just get like a doubling in call volume on nothing. And total call premium jacked from 2634 41 40, right? So like 30s on average to 74 and effectively doubled. It's a big move. It's a really big move. Let's take a look at. Yeah, look at that. The 133s. Where are those at? Those got to be in 16 Jan 26. Is that right? Let's find those. The 133s. Is that's a huge change. I'm surprised. There they are right there. I was going to say, how are they not on this list? That's so funny. There's it's literally just acquiring units. There's so cheap. They're penny. This is why when I'm doing a lot of. Unusual options activity scanning. I generally overlay premium requirements. And it's for stuff like this, right? So you can see that if we take a look at the day of our day yesterday's volume is 1080. Today, oh, I is 1118. Right? So really, really big. It's over a thousand percent change. But you're literally talking about something that is like no shit, a penny. So the weight on that is not that much. literally anybody could put that trade on for any reason. So I wouldn't consider that any sort of like highly informed trade that I would want to know what's going on. It really, it like really doesn't matter to me because it's such a cheap trade. You can't really decipher anything from it. But it does look like the broader market is playing some of the upside. The fact that so much of this is just bullshit that doesn't matter. It's a little harder to tell what the skew near term. It does look like a little heavier expectation to the downside. But like this, people are starting to cash out as well. I mean, I don't blame them, right? Like you're getting the move. So let's take a look really quick at by expiration. About flat, the 21st, 23rd, favors call side, 20 June call side. So yeah, it does look like people are starting to speculate to the upside here. Next from Albuqor thoughts on RDDT. It's funny because I think RDDT was a really interesting one. I've traded it a few times. And it's because stuff like this with like IPOs and then like just absolute mania around it. It's kind of a fun trade. But the reality is that Goldilocks period starts to fade off. So it's earnings. They came in at 13 cents. They were expected at two pennies. So objectively great earnings release. But then you notice this, right? Like if they're so profitable, why would this happen? Well, it has to do with what they talked about in the actual earnings release and the expectations that people have around it. So let's take a look really quick reddit earnings release. I'm actually interested. I didn't look at their quarterly results. I traded them, but I didn't read them. So let's take a look at the actual release. They should have no, no. Normally they have like an investor presentation that looks nicer than that. I don't want the PDF. Hold on. Reddit investor. These releases, quarterly results. No, it's the same thing. Yeah. Yeah. Literally the same exact thing. That sucks. It would be in lazy. Fucking get some of the mods in there to do some shit. All right. Let's see. So revenue 61% year over year. That's crazy. Gross margin 90.5. That's insane. EBITDA 29.4% of revenue, which is solid. I mean, it looks good. Complete financial results management commentary. Let's see what this is. Let's do the transcript. And then let's see what the video is. Hmm. I'll turn this on so that you guys can listen to what it is. And by Gen Wong, our system search chart, we're at the, we're at a strong start to our second year as a public company. And we are very grateful to be with you here today. Okay. We're going to go through the questions. Number one, for me, how is user engagement with reddit answers? How do you see it evolving over time? Okay. Boring. All right. Let's see. This will just be faster than listening to them. I'm screening the questions right now because most of the questions suck. Here we go. See, this is an interesting question. Like, what, what do they consider other revenue? So add revenue and other other revenue consists from content licensing. I see. So it's growing because it's small. Fine. Um, indie to translations, new ad formats, uh, these are terrible questions. What the fuck? That's so annoying. I wanted some meat and potatoes around these questions. So anyways, since we can't get any decent information from their freaking earnings release, the, the market clearly wasn't, wasn't happy with it though. That's super, super clear. Let's see if there's any just, oh, that was on the first. So it closed at what? It closed at 116. Opened up super strong and then it closed at like 118. So what happened on the day? Let's see here. All right. Positive revenue trend net margin, which is good return on equity, which is good. Yeah. So it's interesting because it's the case where like there's nothing claring at me. That looks like awful, but clearly the market didn't like it. So going back to the original question though, unlike oversold and time to sell puts, this is not where I would sell puts. And it's for a few reasons. It's, it's just recently broken down below this prior support level here. And it's literally in a confirmed downtrend. Now, how it behaves as it gets down to like this level is important to me, right? Like does it continue to break down? And then especially if it starts like flirting with these lows. So if this were me, I would be way more interested in some sort of volatility based neutral strategies. So like short strangle, something like that. Just because it looks generally range bound, right? Like I can see a pretty clearly defined range from like the 130 handle ish down to the 80 handle. So a big wide range. But if we take a look at what the options change shows us for that. So down to the 80 handles like 20 delta. So you could do something a little more aggressive like 85 handles, which is a 30 delta. And then to the upside, I mean, we see the near term peaks of that at like 128, which puts you way, way, way, way, way out of the money. So vol isn't quite as high out this far. So it looks like the expectation is that range is going to contract a little bit, but it looks super range bound to me. So that's the kind of thing where I might consider like a short strangle and then roll the strangle as it moves, specifically trying to trail the rebalance it. But yeah, it's because it'll likely have some risk premium as it's going through here. It's early to tell right because 30 day risk premium will be negative, but future risk premium might might trend a little bit better. Rabbit clock says, Bull has some pretty great premiums. I've had good luck with CSPs. Let's see. Bull. I mean, it looks awful. I can see the interest in selling premium because it has 120% IV. And it really does seem to have a pretty defined floor, which my guess is this will be baked into the options market. It does have earnings coming up. Let's take a look at what the options look like. Yeah. So you start to run out of liquidity below like the 11 handle, but I mean, it has a decent floor baked in, right, since it's already so cheap. Yeah. And it has earnings on the 20 seconds. I mean, yeah, I can see the allure for stuff like this, especially if you have a small account where you can get decent premiums because that's absolutely the case here. So if we take a look, we can see that I mean, literally for an 11 strike, which is a 27 Delta, you're getting like 90 cents. That's crazy. For those that don't know, one of the ways that you can kind of ballpark what this whole thing looks like, I'll literally show you. So let's take what is this the 11s. And then let's do what's the premium, let's call it like 90 cents. You literally can build like a little calculator for yourself. So here we'll have strike, we'll have premium. We'll have an X-Berry. So the X-Berry on these is 20 June. And then we could do like lot size. So it just doesn't really matter what the lot size is for the sake of this conversation. But so then let's do some basic math. So the first one is let's say you're doing a cash secured, which it's just a good comparison to use cash secured versus something like margin. But you don't have to, right? You could put whatever the margin requirement is this, we could just easily calculate the cash secured amount, which is just your strike times lot times one Hyundai, step-dye, fuck something up. So strike times your lot times multiplier, which is 100. So it'll tell you obviously how much you need in order to secure the position. Then we can calculate days to expiration from whenever the entry was. So today is 21 May. Days to expiration, expiry minus entry, 30 days. You can calculate the premium. In this case, the credit collected or the, I guess you still would say that credit. How would you say this? CRE DT. CRE DT. Feel like even though it's misspelled, you still get to the same spot. That's kind of cool. And credit here is your premium times lot times 100. Then you can calculate what your relic is. Relic is simply the credit you get divided by how much money you have to put up. So in this case, you're making 8.2% and again, this is a 30-day trade. So then you can annualize your return. You can either do trading days or actual calendar days. So then you can literally have your output of what the annualized return is. Which is, I mean, I think pretty impressive. Because when you have stuff that's super, super volatile, you can get an insane return on your money, right? So 8.2% over the course of a month is really good. However, there's obviously risk, but this clearly has a floor baked in. So for a developed account, this is not where I would go, but for a small account, I totally get it. The other thing that might be considered is even selling like a call spread. With this recent squeeze up to 80, I wouldn't want to necessarily hold naked short calls because getting a sign during one of those can be kind of annoying. But yeah, definitely there's a lot of premium here. The thing I like more about this compared to other things that I've seen is if there's really high premium, but you're not near a perceived floor, that becomes more problematic. But again, like, let's say that you do get this for 90 cents, you can literally size your trade so that you're considering it going to zero, right? And that's obviously hyper conservative. It's not what I would do, but what I mean is to give you like a reference on how you can conceptualize something that's as volatile as this. But there's a million things you would do before it got to zero. So it's the kind of thing where like if it starts falling well below where you think support is, you can either always close your trade, you can open up puts by the puts at that point that are further out at the time of entry, you could buy really, really cheap wings for something like this. If I had a small account that's exactly what I would do because you can get super cheap wings way out here, right? So down at the five, you can grab them for a nickel, right? So then you take your credit received down to 87 from 92. And then if we take a look at the risk profile compared to the naked put compared to the spread here, you can see that you're capping your risk at half of what it would be if it went to zero. You're not really taking that much off the profit side, right? Like you're literally losing three cents from 92. That's a trivial expense. This is an example where I think a spread makes a ton of sense. This is a really good application for a vertical spread. So you can do this also on the call side, right? Or combine them into a condor. So I actually think this is chill. Like I really don't mind, I don't mind the idea here at all. I get it. It's always going to be a little more suboptimal than what I would otherwise try to do. But yeah, I mean, I get it. So viable, definitely call it viable. Big thing is make sure you have a decent management plan to the downside because stuff that is this volatile and essentially with earnings coming up. I don't know if it has it reported earnings before. It doesn't look like it. But I don't know what their last earnings look like. Was this from earnings? No, it wasn't. All right. Lauren says I have a few calls and sq's I could afford q puts. So sq's is fine. I'm always curious what leads you into calls and sq's versus either using tq's or just q's for your idea. Like why sq's here? Oh, it says I couldn't afford q puts. I see. Yeah. So then what led you to sq's versus tq's? affordability. Okay. I get it. The other thing to pay attention to that I'm asking the question because it's a good general lesson for people is let's take a look at a comparative position because it's I think a pretty good example. So if we look at sq's and let's say that we wanted to get short tech, let's say that you want to buy an at the money call that is 50 delta 30 days out. Just grabbing an example. The volume is 69.9 or 69.8%. So pretty high volume. Let's track that here. So this is 30 DTE. We're looking at 50 delta on the nose and our vol is 69.82. And what is the premium for the call mid point 174? Let's call it 175. So here we have delta here. We have vol here. We have premium. Okay. So this is example one. This is using sq's. Now let's take a look at tq's. And I want to show you how to compare the relative cost of a similar size position, which we are going to have to cost or price adjust. So this is 2456. The reason why the 2456 matters is because we're going to have to normalize the delta's a little bit. So this will be ticker. And then this will be price, spot price. So what we can do is we can normalize whatever our delta's are against the spot price. Right. So what I mean by that is if we take a one lot. We can say your delta's here, your 50 delta's on something that's 25 bucks. And this is literally just to normalize it. You can also divide it. This doesn't matter literally at all. All that matters here is that you have something that's made relative to the price. Now let's take a look at tq's. And there's an example you'll see here in a second. So let's take a look at the same 50 delta's that puts you at the 70. So spot price in tq's is 6794. Delta is 0.51. So you're getting a little bit more. Volatility on these is 64.75. It looks like 0.74. So we'll call it 64.7. Premium 5.85. Size one. So you can figure out what your same size delta's are. Right. So in this case, you'd be way too big. Using 51 delta's on something like this. So you have to go cheaper. So here instead, you might say maybe I'll go to like a 25 delta. That puts me closer. After that, we have a 23 delta. Puts me closer 21 delta. Closer still 19 delta. Right about right. So then what we can do is we can figure out the comparative cost relative to the delta's that we're getting. So all I would do, again, it doesn't matter what you do, as long as you standardize it to give yourself effectively a ratio to figure out how expensive the delta's are. So the interesting thing here is that I need to adjust the price. So for the, what do we do? The 19 delta's, these are $1.67. So you can see these are actually cheaper, even though you're paying for puts, even though you're paying for puts, you know, this doesn't, this doesn't take into account. Changes involve in the ball curve and stuff like that. But it's effectively a way to make a same, same comparison between two leveraged ETFs that look at the same thing, but from different angles, long side, short side. And then you can come up with the decision, do I want to buy calls on one or do I want to buy puts on the other? This effectively gives you a way to analyze it. So voila. Skyshadex says, but does it consider spreads and liquidity? I find those leveraged ETFs have insanely large spreads so much that it's almost easier to just trade the underlying. Not so much. They're absolutely going to be wider, but in terms of like getting the total exposure, what you pay on the spread is still probably cheaper than putting on the same size position in the underlying ETF. So we'll look at an example before I pop off. So Skyshadex, do we want to look at an example of being long the leveraged ETF? Or do we want to look at being short the leverage ETF? I just want to create effectively the same position between them. We'll just use TQs and Qs. And I'll start building like a little track or based on which scenario we want to look at. So QQQ TQs. All right. So let's say that we want to be long something. So let's say that we have a $10,000 account. And we want to, well, not a $10,000 account, but let's say a $10,000 allocation, I should say. And we want to be long the same in these. And we want to use options for both. So maybe we'll do what Shortputs to get our synthetic exposure. So in Qs, our price is 513, 0,4, we'll do 30 days just because. And let's do standard 30 delta-ish. So we'll do size. We'll continue. We'll just do a one lot to start because it doesn't matter for the example. I don't know why I said a $10,000 allocation because it literally doesn't matter at all. Size, strike price on these is going to be $498. Premium on these. Let's do bid and offer bid ask. So the bid on these is $734. The ask is $741. Okay. We have most of what we need to then just do the math here. So first thing, let's standardize the format. Beautiful. And first things first, oh, we need the delta. Oh, I'm an idiot. I already said a 30 delta. That goes here. 0.3. Okay. So now first things, let's figure out the bid ask spread. Excuse me, Gemini formula. And in order to make this same same, we take the bid ask spread divided by the strike price. So we can figure out what it is relative. So this is super, super tight on a relative basis. That tightness is difficult to track because sometimes people look at it as a gross metric, which is a big mistake. It's very, very different and you have to look at it differently. So now let's use the $10,000 account. Let's say that we're trying to get a $10,000 allocation. So we can literally figure out lots required. Lots size required for this. All we do is we take our $10,000, we take our $10,000, we divide it by our strike price. We're going to have to go up and money. I'm going to make it like a $50,000 account. Something like that. This is because you can't even cash secure one of these. So anyways, we want that divided by that times 100. And then we can essentially figure out what lot size we need. So here, make this just a number. And let's make this $50,000. So you essentially need a one lot. So now what we can do is we can figure out what our total exposure is with respect to deltas. So what this means is I know that this provides one times leverage. So this will be leverage. So this is one times, this is three times. So there's really nothing to be done here, right? Your deltas are what they are. So your total underlying base deltas that you have in this are literally this. Size times delta times 100 times your leverage factor, which is one. So you're getting 30 underlying deltas, simple. Okay, so now let's take a look at TQs. We'll fill the same thing in. I'm going to leave it off to the side just so that I can fill it in faster. 6794. Strike price, we need 30 delta. We don't really need a 30 delta. I'm picking a 30 delta here to create an equivalent, but you'll see what I mean in a moment. So strike price is 63. Delta is also 30 on the nose, which is nice. This is 2.73. 3.05. Okay. So now there's an important change that happens here. So this one needs to be locked. So if we want to use $50,000, we can figure out how to use $50,000. In this case, you effectively need seven. However, if we take a look at the like comparison deltas, it's actually a completely different story because if we take a look at notional value, our notional value is simply our deltas times current price. This is our notional value. So this has a massively wider spread, literally 0.51. Huge comparative spread. However, what we can sort out is what are the total deltas that these provide? So this is using the underlying price. However, there's a leverage factor that needs to be applied to this. So you can see even though you have a wider bit as spread, you're literally getting more exposure for the same position. When you're trading a small account, it doesn't really matter, right? Because you're trading one lots where this becomes relevant is when you're trading a big account and you're having to put on larger positions. So let's say instead that this was $250,000 allocation. And let's say that you wanted to use $250,000. Well, in order to put on the $250,000 position, we can see what we would need here. We would need a five lot. So if we throw the five lot on, we need more than that. Hold on, my math's fucked up. Strike. And oh, hold on, what's my cash secured? I don't have that on so. Okay. So this is the cash secured element and we can update the notional value. What did I do for this? I just did spot deltas. So you can do it instead of off of spot deltas. We'll do it off of the actual notional value. So this literally is just cash secured put requirement times your leverage factor. So here, we know that we have to put on a five lot to get that $250,000 of exposure. Here, we know that we're going to have to put on a decent bigger position. We're going to have to put on a 39 lot. And this is if you're using like like size, right? Wanting to use $250,000. But notice the difference. What happened to our notional value or notional value? Just freaking skyrocketed. It's actually way too high. The reason why it's so high is because the notional value that we're calculating is using the overall size of the position. So there's a leverage factor that we have to apply to this. So you notice how if you use the same amount of money, you get a massively larger position. So what this means is you can actually put on a much smaller position to get a similar notional value. Now again, you can just do the math or you can just kind of eyeball it. So you need about 13 contracts in order to get there. So then you are still paying. You have to put on a bigger position with a bitter, big ass spread. So then you might be saying, well, this seems more efficient. Well, here's the thing. In this one, you're sitting on way more cash. You're sitting on $167,000 of cash. So if you put this into something that gives you the risk-free rate, you can absolutely make more money than you lose on the comparative spread. That's the idea. And I mean, we can bear that out, right? Because the bitter ass spread is just going to be relative to this amount of money. So yeah, the way I look at it is there's a little more to the equation than just whether or not something is straight up more or less liquid than something else because there's a little more that goes into the math. Now, all that being said, it's always better to trade things that are liquid. But that also being said, it's not necessarily a reason to write off stuff that isn't ideally liquid, depending on the strategy that you're trading. Because for example, if I was trading something that's like really, really high-turn, I wouldn't be enthused to do that here, I would actually just go into futures because they're super liquid and they're way more leverage than any of this. Right? So there's another way to think about it. It really depends on the strategy that you're trying to use. The broader point is I wouldn't, you know, things are flexible depending on what the what the goal is. But yeah, that's hopefully the general idea is useful. Or else is Bitcoin hitting all-time highs? Yeah, no, I do trade Bitcoin. I trade spot and then I also trade the coverage triangle in bit O. Or I'm sorry, an I bit, not bit O, bit O's trash, I bit. So yeah, the way to look at it is I bit, it's effectively spot, right? Because they hold the physical Bitcoin, but that's more of a long-term play. SkyShadex says, yeah, I'm on the higher turnover side. So not so much, but if I was in Leaps or something, different story. Well, that's the thing, right? Because if you're in a higher turnover side, then you actually can still be way better off, again, depending on what the strategy is. Because if you're doing things that are shorter term, you can consistently use less money. And the cool thing with leverage DT apps is that they're going to be more liquid the closer you are in time. So if it's higher turn stuff, then you're actually walking into some advantages. Because if it were designed for longer-term exposure, that's actually where it gets a little more dicey. All right, gang, that wraps me up. For tonight, as always, great catching up. I'm not positive if there will be a Friday stream or not TBD. But as always, if you guys need anything, let me know being outlier. See you all later.
