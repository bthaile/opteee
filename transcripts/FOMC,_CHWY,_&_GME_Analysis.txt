0.84s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.64s: for us we have three things on the
4.88s: agenda I'm going to take a look at the
7.48s: fomc meeting coming up tomorrow what the
10.68s: probabilities are looking like and kind
12.52s: of what we might expect then I'm going
15.04s: to talk a little bit about chewy because
17.20s: somebody asked me to take a look at the
18.68s: options chain there and then we'll take
20.60s: a cursory overview of GameStop and see
23.20s: if anything interesting is peeking up in
27.36s: there so let's get started what's going
30.44s: on with the broad Market well it seems
33.20s: like we are still expecting this rate
36.12s: cut I can see that across all the
38.04s: different indices the S&P 500 just hit
40.52s: new all-time highs The Q's technology
44.44s: more heavy kind of lagging behind a bit
46.92s: here and then small caps are actually
48.32s: starting to catch up to near-term highs
51.12s: so right now it looks like the market is
54.60s: still favoring small caps at this point
57.12s: over technology but the S&P 500 RIT
61.40s: large is the leader of the the pack so
64.84s: what that tells me is that the overall
67.44s: growth that we're seeing just in terms
69.28s: of the indices themselves is not
71.44s: actually being driven by Tech and it's
73.76s: worth noting because for such a long
77.12s: period of time that's been the primary
79.48s: driver of value inside the S&P 500 which
82.72s: has been Tech now as we're looking at it
85.88s: we can see xlb so things that are
88.24s: starting to look at r
90.60s: cut being lifting their markets so
94.56s: things like Builders things like Zillow
97.92s: have been doing really really well if we
99.80s: pull up um Zillow you can see things
103.32s: like Home Depot is doing well so right
107.08s: now the market is kind of starting to
108.92s: gear towards this idea that the rate
110.88s: Cut's going to start coming it looks
112.32s: like it might be at a pretty moderate
113.88s: pace so you can see real estate is
116.24s: coming up into highs so all in all
118.40s: there's still that internal rotation
120.12s: within the S&P 500 so now as we take a
122.80s: look at the FED watch tool and we take a
125.80s: look at the probabilities the
126.88s: probability now of a 50 basis point cut
129.72s: is
131.28s: 63% which is quite High I think and
135.20s: obviously that tells us that's where the
136.68s: market is leaning that we're actually
138.04s: going to start with a slightly heavier
140.56s: cut than previously expected so this
143.32s: tells me a few things one that the FED
145.88s: is starting to move away from this
147.76s: really slow careful approach because I
150.68s: did expect them to start with a 25 basis
152.80s: point cut although they've been you know
154.76s: being told that they're late they're
156.32s: late to the party you know it's going to
158.08s: be too late for the recession and da D
160.68s: that
161.52s: still what I thought they would do maybe
164.16s: start cutting a little earlier but then
165.88s: take a lower cut path and this actually
169.28s: looks pretty
171.04s: aggressive if we take a look at this so
173.72s: this looks like 50 basis point cut
175.92s: probability right now for the 18th then
179.64s: the next one 7 the 7th of um November
184.36s: 87% probability of 25 basis points then
188.24s: if we go to December another 50 basis
190.24s: point cut on top of that so that would
191.76s: be cutting us about uh point and a
193.44s: quarter or so so that starts to get
195.56s: actually kind of aggressive in this near
197.40s: term a little more so than I was
199.08s: anticipating which was essentially going
200.64s: to be quarter quarter quarter so we'll
204.76s: see now one of the questions I have due
207.32s: to this is will the FED take a PA
210.68s: after one of these cuts which is TBD we
214.00s: don't know yet so from a broad Market
216.48s: perspective I think this will be
217.68s: generally uplifting I think small caps
219.52s: will continue to enjoy it although we
221.76s: likely have seen a good bit of the move
224.40s: already because if we take again a look
226.80s: at something like iwm which is small
229.28s: caps you can see it's made this pattern
231.24s: a few times when prior rate Cuts were
233.84s: expected to be happening they ended up
235.52s: not necessarily happening at the time
237.24s: frame but this is now starting to close
239.84s: in on term highs and it's really
241.68s: catching up with large caps on the year
244.24s: if I take a look at my little tracker
246.32s: the S&P 500 is up 19 and a quarter
248.44s: points iwm is up 10 so it's still
251.44s: lagging by about half but if you look at
253.32s: it over the course of the year it was
254.80s: even zero or slightly negative pacing
258.08s: well well well below the S&P 500 so the
260.64s: S&P 500 obviously is crushing it this
263.56s: year but the small caps here um are
267.04s: starting to catch up a little bit and
268.40s: then this does start to open the the
269.80s: door for a conversation about recession
271.24s: what does it look like what's the
272.28s: probability we actually looked at this a
274.08s: little bit on the live stream yesterday
275.56s: and the probabilities for a recession
277.44s: sometime in 2025 are not insignificant
280.56s: so I think it's something that Traders
282.72s: need to be preparing for not the Doom
285.24s: and Gloom style you know all the world's
287.28s: crashing down but definitely have to
289.96s: have a plan in place otherwise it's easy
291.64s: to get caught off sides so let's take a
294.32s: look at chewy really fast and this is
297.76s: generally what I was expecting I was
299.12s: actually talking about this yesterday
300.40s: some people were asking about it and it
302.88s: looks like a lot of this move has been
305.64s: fueled by its post earnings event right
308.76s: overall pretty solid earnings that the
310.40s: market liked and it's been rallying up
312.40s: and out I know there's a bunch of
313.48s: different theories and thesis and stuff
315.00s: like that not going to go into detail on
316.68s: those necessarily just yet I'm kind of
318.92s: following it from a standard Market
321.04s: perspective here which is volume
323.60s: expanding around earnings we saw volume
326.60s: materialize for a few days post earnings
329.28s: a lot of really strong buy volume as we
332.20s: hit this kind of term swing low and then
334.72s: volume is now starting to siphon back
336.84s: out so we'll see how long that volume
339.24s: keeps up and continues to move chewy but
341.80s: from a technical perspective it looks
343.24s: good to the upside it still likes where
344.80s: it's at kind of the way I would be
346.64s: playing it is downside at like 30 and
348.68s: change maybe just a little bit below
350.24s: that and then it looks like near-term
352.24s: price Target would be something around
353.68s: 35 again we looked at this on the live
355.28s: stream yesterday I'm just kind of using
356.80s: historic time frames to come up with
358.96s: just some Fe
360.48s: now if we take a look at the options
362.64s: chain and we take a look at the overall
365.64s: open interest it's super super quiet so
369.00s: there's 250,000 calls against 206,000
371.76s: puts there's really just nothing in here
374.28s: that's like super interesting to me from
377.08s: an options trading perspective because
378.72s: it is so quiet total volume today 21,000
381.92s: calls versus 12,000 puts so this is the
384.72s: kind of thing that if I see crazy volume
387.12s: it almost always sneak like almost
390.12s: always can see it because otherwise it's
392.60s: generally very very quiet in here so we
395.28s: can see that there was some 32 and a
397.88s: halfes in 20 seep that were traded but
400.44s: these are kind of towards the mid a
402.32s: little closer to the bid so maybe sold
404.80s: you can't directly tell but even this is
407.96s: large of a quantity trade as this is
409.92s: it's still not like absolutely massive
412.20s: or anything like that so yeah the option
414.48s: chain in here just looks generally quiet
416.60s: and that's you know not good or bad it
418.08s: just means it's not um superactive when
421.72s: I look through the volatility I don't
423.04s: see anything sticking out at me as
424.52s: anomalous it looks like you know front
426.36s: term V is a little bit higher and then
428.76s: tailor down as we go further out and
430.84s: then it'll probably start peeking up out
432.32s: here which is when I would assume next
434.16s: earnings is or something like that so
436.64s: yeah that's chewy in a nutshell and then
438.96s: let's take a quick look
441.28s: for options data on chewy out of
444.76s: curiosity and we can take a look and see
446.88s: if anything interesting has been popping
449.80s: up in here and we'll take a look uh this
452.60s: week so far we'll take a look at the
453.80s: 16th and the 17th and we'll start with
456.64s: the calls seeing if there's any big
458.16s: purchases and again doesn't really look
460.44s: like much on the put side not much again
464.40s: all really small trades let's go to the
466.08s: bid all small trades so yeah there's
469.16s: nothing really going on in here as far
471.48s: as I'm concerned that doesn't mean that
473.00s: there's nothing at all but it's just
475.12s: generally quiet so next let's take a
478.28s: quick look at GameStop because GameStop
482.88s: is in a really interesting point to me
485.48s: believe it or not we are hugging this
489.60s: what I perceive to be support again I've
491.60s: had this line drawn for some time now
494.24s: because I expect this to continue to
496.00s: serve as support to some degree and
498.68s: price has been hovering right on top of
500.36s: it so I am eager to see does price
503.32s: continue consolidating and start making
504.96s: an advance up or does it start
506.48s: penetrating below if it starts
507.80s: penetrating below I don't love that and
510.56s: it starts to look like 18 is probably
513.44s: next on that list and then hopefully not
516.20s: below that volume is still very light
519.72s: and continuing to dry up so we can see
523.68s: today there was 6.3 million volume sale
526.88s: volume of that was 3.9 million and uh
529.88s: buy volume is like 2.36 so mostly sale
532.72s: volume still very light so overall from
536.20s: an equity perspective it look just looks
537.96s: very quiet now one note I was actually
540.76s: texting with Newton about this a bit
542.44s: last uh last night is I'm talking with
544.72s: one of my buddies this week who was an
547.48s: options Market maker now he kind of runs
549.32s: his own firm and if there's anything in
552.12s: particular you want me to talk with him
554.04s: about let me know I'm happy to try to
555.72s: collect as much as I can but the
558.16s: questions if you guys have them try to
560.16s: like form them out well right because
562.76s: I'm not going to ask like super basic
564.44s: stuff because it's just kind of a waste
567.04s: of their time I always will do my best
569.40s: to get to the bottom and if it's
571.00s: something basic that I can answer I will
573.12s: always try to answer it for you it's not
574.92s: to answer the question on their behalf
576.68s: it's just if it's a standard process
579.44s: thing then obviously I'm not going to
582.00s: take it to them but if it's something um
584.52s: a little more nuanced or somewhat like
586.36s: that happy to bring those some of the
587.64s: stuff I'm going to be talking with them
588.80s: about is kind of dissecting some of the
590.56s: recent moves we saw not just in GameStop
592.32s: they don't specialize in GameStop again
593.68s: they're a market maker they just know
595.24s: about the broader process but we can
597.04s: learn a little bit about some of the the
599.00s: recent moves I'm actually very
600.68s: interested to understand some of their
603.04s: hedging activities um so yeah that's
605.56s: kind of the direction I'm taking it but
607.72s: happy to serve as a conduit for other
610.12s: folks that's a big part of what I try to
612.12s: do so let's take a look at the options
614.80s: chain and let's take a look at the total
618.32s: open interest and we still have even
620.88s: more call oi now 660,000 calls versus
624.96s: 300,000 puts this is continuing to build
627.28s: and this is exceeding that two to one
629.68s: ratio pretty significantly at this point
632.16s: I still see the same spread across all
634.60s: these different expirations I see a ton
636.44s: of calls traded today against puts
639.80s: 89,000 calls versus
642.84s: 13,700 puts and I see most of them
646.12s: coming in at the offer above so we're
648.44s: buying those so yeah overall the options
652.00s: chain in GameStop is still again on a
655.28s: relative basis quiet but it's definitely
658.16s: not silent to any degree so if we take a
661.12s: look at kind of this week so far and we
665.08s: get rid of the bids and we'll get rid of
666.60s: the puts we're now seeing just some
671.04s: further term expirations we already
672.92s: talked about these so this is nothing
674.72s: novel but this is still relatively new
677.44s: for GameStop where we're seeing these
678.72s: longer term positions being built out
680.96s: now in the near term it still looks a
683.36s: little bit quiet as far as I can tell
685.72s: but as always if there's anything that's
688.16s: jumping out at you or that you want take
689.52s: a look at let me know for the gme live
691.32s: stream this coming Saturday we're going
694.24s: to go into part three of analyzing brory
696.92s: kitties old trades which Newton and I
699.08s: talked a lot about that because he has a
701.60s: lot of ideas about some of the behaviors
704.16s: and I want to see if we can pick up any
706.00s: of those based on what we've been seeing
708.08s: so far because I definitely am getting a
709.84s: really good feel for the way that Ryan
711.84s: Kitty was thinking about his options
713.52s: trades building them and then managing
715.32s: them so we're getting to the point now
716.92s: where he's starting to unwind positions
718.56s: so I can learn more about that which
719.80s: looks way more based on time than value
723.96s: normally when we're trading options we
725.24s: try to pick a point where we think
726.44s: something might go and I actually don't
728.44s: see that so far from him I see him
730.64s: primarily managing by time which is
732.44s: fascinating so we'll dive further into
735.00s: that and then for the live stream
737.24s: tomorrow I'm going to start maybe like
739.36s: some sort of miniseries about trading
742.48s: meme stocks with options this is from a
745.32s: recommendation from one of our viewers
747.08s: and I think it's a really great idea
748.40s: because there's a lot of options Traders
750.68s: or a lot of meme stock traders that
752.88s: start trading meme stocks they add
754.64s: options and then they get torn up just
756.64s: because of lack of fundamentals so the
759.24s: goal is to use that as an opportunity to
760.96s: talk a little bit about the specific
762.52s: profit mechanisms how to think about
764.32s: them a little more um appropriately I
766.92s: think at least to structure ideas that
768.76s: might be more representative of the
770.72s: thesis rather than just getting burned
772.84s: by buying cheap out- of- the money
774.24s: options at the K away in front of your
775.60s: face so that's what's coming up as
777.48s: always let me know if there's anything
778.68s: we should take look at be an outlier
780.36s: I'll see you later
