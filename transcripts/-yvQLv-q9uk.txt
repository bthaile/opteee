0.00s: Everybody, Eric here, got another really good question.
4.40s: There's a bunch of them today, so this is actually really engaging.
6.48s: It's awesome.
7.48s: Cloud folks are trying to learn and I'm happy to help.
12.24s: The question is, wrapped around what is short interest flow in how can we use it to help
19.48s: us inform our investing decisions?
22.72s: Great question.
23.88s: So first and foremost, short interest flow, short shares, short interest, short flow,
31.32s: all of it is synonymous.
32.56s: So when we're having this conversation, I likely will flow in between all of them,
37.08s: but it's essentially, it all means the same thing.
39.88s: And what it means is, how many shares have been sold short?
44.32s: So as most folks know, in familiar, you can buy stock, normally when you buy stock,
50.52s: you want it to appreciate and value so that you can sell higher.
54.92s: So buy low, sell high.
57.80s: There's an entire other side of stock transactions where people can sell short,
64.80s: where they typically do that in a bearish sentiment, where they think it's going to go down.
71.00s: So in that instance, what they do is they don't own any shares to start.
76.08s: They borrow shares from a broker and they tell the broker, I owe you X number of shares,
83.40s: however many they borrowed.
85.12s: And then what that investor do is immediately sell those shares.
89.96s: So technically, they would have negative X number of shares after they sell the shares,
96.92s: because they need to recoup those shares at some point to give back to the broker.
102.56s: So what they want is to sell them at a high price and then buy them back at a low price.
110.32s: And then as soon as they get those shares back, they just give them to the broker,
113.72s: say, here you go, thanks for letting me borrow these.
116.60s: And then that's the trade.
117.92s: So inverse to traditional stock investing, they sell high and then buy low.
127.68s: So the reason why we like to take a look at short interest flow is because it helps us identify
134.52s: sentiment in the market.
136.76s: And the reason being is if you see a certain stock that has a ton of shares, short shares,
146.32s: there's a good chance that a lot of institutional investors who do a lot of research on
150.88s: this stuff, it's their jobs.
152.92s: So what we're going to do is to identify this is something that they feel is going
156.12s: to decrease.
157.48s: I never promulgate the herd mentality just follow, kind of mindset, but we can use it as an
165.60s: indicator to add to the rest of our toolkit.
168.84s: So if we're looking at something, we're like, eh, this one looks a little weird.
171.88s: It might come down.
172.88s: And then all of the things you see that there's a really, really large number of short
176.48s: shares, that can be a tool that you use, including with your thought process.
181.76s: So there's a couple ways it can be expressed first just a general number of shares.
186.60s: More often than not with more helpful is when you see it expressed as a percentage and to
190.84s: get that percentage, you know, pretty simply just take the number of short shares and then
194.68s: divide it by the shares outstanding.
196.32s: And that'll give you, you know, 20% of outstanding shares are short.
200.64s: You know, something like that, just to give you an idea of, you know, the size.
205.88s: A couple of things that I think are worth discussing.
209.56s: The short interest ratio is, it's a good one to follow.
214.52s: And the reason being, it's also known as the date to cover ratio and the calculation
219.36s: is short interest divided by the average daily volume.
222.80s: So as you could probably infer from the calculation, what this is telling you is how
226.72s: many days it would take on a, how many average days it would take for short to cover
233.64s: their position.
234.80s: So for example, if there's a product that has, you know, an average daily volume of
241.80s: 10 million shares and then there's five million shares that are sold short over that
248.52s: over an average day, you can close all those shorts.
252.00s: All those shorts would have enough volume to close.
254.40s: However, in that same scenario, if we have 10 million average daily shares and then there's
262.44s: 40 million in short interest, that means that it would take at least four days for them
268.60s: to cover all of their short positions.
272.24s: That can be a problem if the market is running up and people are trying to get out of these
277.28s: positions from the short side.
279.24s: You can see a lot of flight to quality.
280.84s: People just, you know, just trying to get the heck out of these positions and it can create
285.24s: volatility.
286.24s: So that's an interesting one to follow.
287.88s: If you see a, you know, a big disparity in that ratio, it's something I like to watch.
293.24s: The last piece, I'm sure you've heard of it in some capacity at some point is the good
297.44s: old squeeze, also known as the short squeeze.
300.80s: What this is is when you have a bunch of people that's short at a position, remember,
306.84s: when you short, you want it to go down.
309.00s: However, if you short and it continues up and continues up and continues up and continues
316.78s: up at some point, you once you hit your risk profile, a lot of people are like, you know,
322.06s: hit my risk time to sell in this case, time to buy, time to close the position is what
327.42s: it means.
328.42s: So if they, you know, sold at $50 and it keeps going up, keeps going up, now it's at 70.
334.14s: I'm like, okay, I got to buy this back.
335.94s: I know it's going to be at $20 a loss of share, but I got to get out of this thing.
340.38s: And then all of a sudden, a couple days later, once all those shorts get out, then the
344.90s: market normalizes, it comes back down.
347.14s: It's a short squeeze.
348.64s: So it's a temporary increase or decrease depending on if it's a short squeeze or both
353.32s: squeeze.
354.32s: But it's a temporary move in the price that normalizes shortly thereafter.
360.82s: Now on the short side, it can absolutely be a good opportunity for, for bullish investors,
370.70s: if there's a large short interest flow.
373.94s: Most people are like, how can that be if, you know, you're just telling me that it could
379.86s: mean that there's a lot of bearish sentiment and professionals think it's going to go down.
384.50s: Goes back to what I say all the time.
386.06s: Nobody knows what the hell's going to happen.
387.66s: Nobody knows.
388.66s: We have people who would say they're explicit job to try to, you know, analyze different
392.78s: underlying and, you know, come out with an hypothesis on direction and they're wrong all
398.04s: the time.
399.24s: So it comes to 50-50 chance.
401.70s: So the reason why it can be an opportunity risky, but can be is because, again, that similar
410.22s: squeeze scenario, if all of a sudden there's no pull back in all these shorts are trying
416.06s: to cover their positions.
419.10s: Remember, how do you cover short position?
421.50s: You have to buy stock.
423.50s: So whenever we buy stock, we're increasing demand.
428.06s: And increases pricing.
431.06s: So it's just, if a bunch of shorts start trying to cover their positions, they're buying
437.78s: a bunch of stock, which is going to drive price up.
440.82s: So if you're bullish and you see a trend continue to the upside, it could be a good
447.22s: investment because there's a chance that the shorts will end up wanting to get out and
451.78s: then driving the price up if enough of them start to do so.
455.82s: So that's what short interest float is, a couple actionable items from an investing perspective
460.22s: on how we can, you know, use this to inform some of our decision-making.
463.74s: I would never use any of this as the basis for a trade, but I do use a lot of this information
469.50s: to assist in, you know, my trade generation ideas.
474.34s: It's a tool in the toolkit.
475.74s: It's not, you know, the end all be all.
477.70s: So I hope this is helpful.
478.98s: I'll catch you guys later.
