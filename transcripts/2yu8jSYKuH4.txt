0.00s:  you
0.00s:  What's up everybody Eric here welcome back to all the outliers and we are here with the
6.56s:  outlier podcast and I have David Hunter back on I think this is probably like your seventh
12.30s:  or eighth time with us. We kind of catch up every quarter which serves as a really interesting
16.64s:  way to follow along your view of markets how things are playing out and then to receive
21.64s:  new information as you're seeing it. So first off welcome back great to have you.
26.40s:  Yeah thanks Eric. Good to see you. Merry Christmas for happy Hanukkah whatever. Yeah we're
33.12s:  getting now. I was saying right before we started you already got the red sweater on so you're
37.44s:  quite festive which I can appreciate like I was just telling you my wife she started decorating
42.16s:  for Christmas two weeks ago. So it's all a blur to me at this point but yeah man what a year.
50.88s:  So I have a lot of things that I want to talk to you about. The very first one is the last time
57.60s:  we connected for everybody's context you and I spoke sometime like mid to late August it was
62.88s:  like right around there and at that point you felt the market was at kind of a decision point.
70.80s:  We started to pull back speaking of the S&P 500 here. We started to pull back and you were saying
76.24s:  that you felt we could either continue down towards you know like 4200 or that could have been
84.08s:  the low that we ran up and out. Since then we fell down a little bit further to 4100 but then from
90.40s:  there we've essentially have been up and out. What are your thoughts on that move? Yeah that was
97.20s:  what I call a perfect retrace. I actually was almost a very symmetrical inverted head and shoulder
103.44s:  so 4100 actually made sense but I didn't think we'd get quite down there but we did and then came
111.12s:  right out of that and I said the week we turned I said it looks to me after we had a couple very
117.52s:  strong days out of that bottom. It looks to me based on the fact that everybody's so bearish
122.96s:  and the fact that the markets had two or three big days I said it looks like we're starting
128.96s:  to melt up right now. I have been saying we'd probably really have to wait until you know new highs,
137.60s:  new all-time highs to really get the market going but those first few days there was just so much
144.32s:  behind them that it felt like we were going to just come out of that last pullback and then
150.56s:  just keep going and that's really essentially what we've done. You can see the move you know came
157.28s:  right down to a turn line bounced off it and you know I have moved right back up to that almost
164.56s:  to that 4600 area that we started the correction from so I don't believe we're going to see
171.68s:  any more 8 to 10 percent corrections until we get to the top you know could have three to five
178.16s:  percent corrections at any time so you know I'm not saying we can't you know there's going to go
184.56s:  straight up but pretty close I mean I think we are looking at a steep rally what a melt-up means
190.72s:  is something that's parabolic ultimately parabolic and very steep and you cover an awful lot of ground
196.48s:  in a matter of months so that's what I think we're into now you know could we go back to
204.40s:  434400 before we take off to new highs we could will we I have no idea you know I think a lot
213.68s:  depend on what numbers come out that you know trigger something so let's say tomorrow I think you
220.72s:  get the PCE tomorrow the you know the inflation number that the the Fed tends to watch if that
228.32s:  number is elevated we've seen some signs here in the last couple months that inflation's come back
234.08s:  if if that number is elevated it certainly could cause a couple hundred point sell-off in the S&T
240.96s:  if not we may just off to the races you know be off to the races so it can go either way in the very
247.44s:  short term I you know as a macro strategy so I'm not trying to call you know the day-to-day week to
254.48s:  week sometimes I see setups like I did at 4600 for that pullback down to 4100 but you know
263.84s:  generally the story from here going forward is that we're in the melt-up I think and that melt-up
270.24s:  is going to take us to 6,000 for sure and I think there's very good odds that we're going to see 7,000
277.44s:  on the S&P maybe you know I think likely in the first quarter doesn't have to happen in the first
284.96s:  quarter but I think that's that's the likelihood and obviously if we do that you know you're talking
291.76s:  about a better you know something 50% or better appreciation from here and in a matter of months
303.76s:  I mean that's what I mean by historic melt-up it's going to be something we don't see very often
310.80s:  so looking at the catalyst last time we spoke you would mention a few things you would mention
316.08s:  contracting dollar contracting and then the rate environment looking to change when we last spoke
323.84s:  there was still some semblance of another rate hike even whereas now if we look at the fed watch
330.56s:  tool you just look at bond probabilities you can see that essentially that's gone since the last
336.08s:  time we spoke it's the right probability of a hike is minuscule and again we talked about this last
341.36s:  time you made a very clear note that Wall Street is thinking one thing the fed could be thinking
347.28s:  something different but right now that's just what Wall Street is saying so how does that play
352.88s:  into your view of the rate environment changing as a catalyst we're now we're even looking at
359.36s:  potentially a rate contraction starting as early as spring of next year is that a key function
365.60s:  still of this parabolic melt-up or is that a little bit too late based on the time from you were
370.32s:  just sharing now essentially what you're getting and I think I've talked about this for several
375.28s:  months is you're getting what I expected you'd get which is you've gone from a headwind of fed tightening
383.76s:  and and powell reiterating it every meeting higher for longer and you know whether we hike more
391.76s:  or whether we you know just stay at these elevated levels that we're basically not done you've
397.92s:  gone from that headwind in just a matter of weeks to where the street feels pretty comfortable that
404.80s:  the Fed has done you're starting to get some and this is this is new some of the Fed officials coming
412.40s:  out and actually saying we we can even entertain a cut if certain things happen you know that if
420.96s:  if inflation comes down to our levels if the economy weakens you know cuts aren't off the table
427.36s:  at some point next year so so those are you know beginning signs at the Fed starting to recognize
434.64s:  that maybe they've done enough now I've said they've done too much I think I think when you're seeing
442.48s:  the 10-year drop from 5% to today I think got down to four and a quarter and it's just above that now
453.12s:  to drop 75 basis points in a matter of a month that is the street seeing that the economy stopped
463.76s:  on a dime I mean you basically you just got the revisions you know 5.2% GDP in the third quarter
470.96s:  you know up from 4.9% they're pre-assessment so so third quarter looks gangbusters but basically almost
480.32s:  like clockwork is a quarter ended I think so off the table and I think we may be in recession right now
486.96s:  as silly as that sounds because you're starting from a strong quarter you know it usually takes a while
492.88s:  but you know what those sales look pretty crummy housing sales look pretty crummy you know there's
499.60s:  real signs that we may have hit a brick wall on the economy and you know still the rhetoric out there
506.24s:  is soft landing because you know obviously looking at their quarter looks like things are not going
511.92s:  into recession anytime soon but I'm saying there is a good chance that what what the market in the
518.24s:  aggregate is picking up is that the economy is weakening pretty fast here that we you know and that's
523.92s:  how that's how recessions happen is you can go from seemingly all okay to trouble in a hurry I mean
532.00s:  I can remember in September of 2008 I was talking about a financial crisis the likes of which we
544.00s:  hadn't seen in the in the post-war were two eras and almost every Wall Street economist was saying
550.80s:  soft landing no no recession in sight weeks later you know we had Lehman just two or three weeks
558.80s:  after that and and and everything it came after that weeks after the the economist I mean weeks not
565.44s:  months weeks after the economist were saying no recession in sight we were in the worst financial
571.84s:  crisis in in the post-war were two eras so things can happen fast when they happen and that's what I
579.20s:  think the Fed's going to be surprised by and it's and that's where I think you you run into the
586.00s:  problems of having academic economists making judgments every month and thinking they can kind of
594.08s:  you read the tea leaves every month and make their judgments incrementally as they go along
599.52s:  this is how how economies and financial systems happen is everything seems seemingly going
606.16s:  no okay until it's not and I think we're very close to that point where it's not now that doesn't
613.84s:  mean we're going because everybody knows I've got a global bus forecast for 2024 it doesn't mean
619.84s:  we're going from you know seemingly decent economy to a bus with nothing in between it just means
627.92s:  the economy is going to slow down quite a bit here and it's going to cause the Fed to recognize
634.32s:  maybe something they don't even recognize today um recognizing the next one or two that they
640.88s:  actually do have to reverse course here pretty fast that that is a trigger for a belt up I mean
646.88s:  that's what I think the streets beginning to pick up on or the the market in the aggregate the market
653.36s:  in the aggregate is not the same as compiling you know street well street strategist opinions it's
662.16s:  the market in the aggregate which is a you know law of large numbers when you put everybody together
667.60s:  the market is a pretty good predictor of what's going on that doesn't it's not necessarily the same
674.56s:  as what a consensus of a con must or a strategist are thinking in fact that's usually not the same so
681.20s:  so I'm talking about the market in its you know in its ability to discount things is beginning to
688.00s:  pick up that the economy is rolling over the dollars rolling over rates are rolling over
695.20s:  um and those are bullish things for the stock market in the next few months
701.36s:  one of the things you brought up that I thought was curious was the GDP which is why I pulled it
706.88s:  up here you were mentioning the possibility that we might be in a recession already my question is
712.80s:  when you look at something like this where we see Q2 real GDP grew 2.1 percent
719.20s:  where's the idea of potentially being a recession fit in with actual realized GDP growth
727.28s:  well um so so um I'm just looking at what you have up here you said
733.92s:  what would you say for 2.1 percent for second quarter you have fitted increased 2.1 percent
740.72s:  yeah we're we're up to 5 you know 5.2 percent so um you know it's again it's backward looking
750.80s:  you're measuring an economy quarter by quarter um looking backwards and that's what I'm saying is
759.04s:  you can you can have things change it typically isn't so convenient to the changes right at a quarter
765.84s:  beginning or quarter end but that's seemingly is what's happening here at least from kind of the
771.36s:  anecdotal reports I'm getting um you know auto is really slowing down quickly here um and and a lot
779.68s:  of that is because we just had this big bump in interest rates in the fall so you know we had
786.08s:  like I said the 10 years falling 75 basis points here but in a few months previous to that
792.72s:  it gone up 75 basis points so you've had this you know you had and mortgage rates went up to
798.56s:  you know seven and almost 8 percent so you know you've had this big bump in rates
805.12s:  um that is affecting the rate sensitive areas of the economy and those happen to be big areas of
811.52s:  the economy um you know it's impacting housing obviously that's a big area or construction
817.84s:  it's impacting auto's used to be we would say as GM goes so goes the economy that's not
826.16s:  necessarily true today because GM's a smaller less impactful company but it is as the auto
832.32s:  industry goes so goes the economy auto's are a big still big part of the economy and if that's
837.84s:  really changing here um you know in the next few months you're going to see it's going to impact
843.04s:  on GDP so backward looking yeah the economy in third quarter was strong
847.84s:  forward looking I don't think the next quarter is going to be so strong
852.08s:  got it so talk to me a little bit more about how you view some of these different tools like you
859.20s:  brought up automotive sales I've definitely heard that before same thing with like home sales
863.44s:  we were just talking about GDP how do you wait these different indicators to determine the
868.64s:  prevalent direction because as you said if we do look at something like GDP that's been expanding although
873.92s:  it's you know previous looking if you look at something like auto sales it's also a previous looking
879.04s:  but to your point you're seeing that that's contracting um how do you fit all these together to then
884.96s:  make your assessment yeah it's not it's not very scientific because I I am certainly not
891.60s:  um the quantitative type that believes that you that the market fits in with that so in other words
900.32s:  the market is disguying things many many months in advance so I don't really care what fourth quarter
906.32s:  GDP is you know whether it comes in negative or positive I'm just saying that you're seeing a
911.44s:  net change at the margin you know second derivative change um in terms of the rate of change
919.52s:  in the economy in in some of the important components of the economy you're also seeing it in
925.60s:  um you know the credit card the link with these and you're seeing it in um you know the consumer
933.76s:  pulling back on large purchases you know the more capital goods intensive purchases
939.92s:  so in the summer they use you know they pull back on consumption so they could
945.28s:  uh of goods so they could do travel now they're going back the other way and I suspect Christmas
950.72s:  will be okay um but other things may not be as strong like you know durable goods because
957.84s:  they have limited ability to spend they can't spend across the board so they have to kind of
963.68s:  pick and choose they're still shop till you drop they still want to they still want to spend but
969.28s:  they have to be more selective about their spending this is honestly worse than I thought I hadn't
977.36s:  looked at this little while this is delinquency rates on uh credit card loans for commercial banks
983.44s:  yeah commercial banks excuse me this is did I didn't expect it to be quite this steep
989.68s:  is this what do you make of this like I definitely thought it would be expanding but I didn't
994.32s:  realize it would be expanding quite to this degree yeah no it's it's basically I think we're at the
1000.00s:  link see rates that are worse than 2008 nine so you're you know what you're seeing is the the problem
1009.44s:  of a haven't have not economy we've talked about this before you know the top 10% of the the
1016.80s:  um wealth has plenty of money and and you know it feels no problem you know the market's not that far
1024.64s:  off highs and real estate's up you know up through the roof um so those guys feel pretty good but those
1031.52s:  at the bottom add the bottom probably 20 or 30 percent are second-wint I mean and you know they
1040.72s:  we started talking about this many many months ago they were using their credit cards
1046.32s:  to pay for groceries because their budgets couldn't withstand the inflation they were seeing at
1051.36s:  the grocery store so you know those that really have limited um incomes are struggling
1059.36s:  mightily already um you know you did have obviously the whole influx of money that came from the
1068.00s:  government during the pandemic and that's being drawn down so um you know that's where you're
1074.72s:  beginning to see the friction also and why this thing can stop on a dime is yeah I think you're
1079.84s:  reaching the point where a lot of that that money that was pumped in from the government and
1087.12s:  you know boosted savings up to a 35 percent savings rate at one point unheard of that's all
1093.20s:  a lot of that's been drawn down it's allowed this thing to stretch out it's allowed the cycle
1098.96s:  to continue longer than I thought it would longer than most economists thought it would um but
1105.52s:  I think we're reaching the end of that and the linkages are assigned um and and one of the reasons
1112.48s:  why I think as we get into 2024 we ultimately go into a bus because there's debt everywhere I mean
1120.24s:  the consumer indebtedness is problematic sovereign debt is problematic you know corporate debt some
1128.24s:  you know a lot of corporations are in pretty good shape but there's obviously those that the
1134.00s:  lesser rating into the spectrum that are very leveraged so um you know I think consumer
1141.84s:  linkages are credit card linkages just another um sign that we are moving towards something that's
1148.80s:  not going to be pretty and you know I think I think soft landing is a pipe dream it's curious
1156.16s:  because like you were highlighting we're maybe halfway to where we saw the peak a little less so
1163.04s:  than during 2008 2009 in terms of delinquencies but the part that I find interesting is this all
1170.08s:  took place obviously during a very rapid interaction in economic functions during a just massive
1178.80s:  economic collapse whereas this has been on a bit of a smooth scale slope up at a decent clip
1186.56s:  supposedly during a time frame or we're not in a recession yet so another word if you were to
1192.88s:  compare you'd want to compare the period in 2006 seven um you know going into 2008 right um and you
1202.24s:  know it's it's what will come probably in the next year where you're going to see it surpass
1208.72s:  2008-9 um so yeah I mean it's we haven't even gotten to the recession yet that's as you correctly
1216.56s:  point out that's where this thing can go pretty vertical interesting and then the other thing you
1222.40s:  highlighted that I wanted to grab this is from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics just on
1226.72s:  car sales and it really highlights a couple interesting things that I wanted to get your take on so
1231.60s:  the first one is the production which is this red line production is cratered this is production
1239.92s:  thousands of vehicles is on the y-axis and then the x-axis is just the year where production has
1245.84s:  gone from over you know four thousand units down to sub two and it was at four thousand units in
1252.24s:  2015 and this is just cratered and then as we look at like sold passenger vehicles exactly as you
1258.80s:  were talking about that's contracted massively so is this how do these two things wait against one
1264.80s:  another or is it more of uh you use them in conjunction with one another things like um
1271.68s:  automotive sales and then the link one sees yeah I'm I mean I'm not an auto analyst so I don't
1279.20s:  really look at this in detail but what I'd say is obviously we had this plait chain issues for a
1286.48s:  while there so that was um some of the production issues um and then um you know I'm not sure whether
1296.00s:  the strike probably had something to do with some of the the supply issues now or or production cuts but
1304.72s:  but you know looking at this I would guess inventory's uh let's see my eyes are not too good here but
1314.24s:  uh yeah the red is commercial uh passenger vehicle inventory essentially the production yeah so
1321.04s:  and then so looking at this inventory would seemingly be in good shape the problem is I think
1327.28s:  demand I mean it's same story I've been telling about oil you can sit and focus on supply but if
1333.92s:  demand is going to fall off uh you know there's going to be an inventory build and I I think the
1341.44s:  auto companies this time around have another issue as well which is they decided in their um
1347.60s:  infinite wisdom that they knew best what the market wanted and they jumped whole hog into
1355.52s:  you know electric vehicles and the market saying we're not really that interested in electric
1360.40s:  vehicles hybrids maybe but not electric vehicles so so you've got you know you've got a mixed problem
1367.28s:  um you've got a lot of Kaplik spenders who's going into the companies transforming themselves
1373.04s:  for what they think is going to be a big EV future and and then you've got a recession about to
1378.72s:  smack them down so I I think the certainly the auto manufacturers that have made the big bets meaning
1385.44s:  Ford and and GM maybe in for a real tough time in 2024 you mentioned oil before so I grabbed um just
1398.88s:  crude oil here this is a one-year chart it's definitely contracted quite a bit when you and I
1405.76s:  spoke last time you would talked about potentially oil getting down into the 60s and for reference when
1412.24s:  we spoke again it was um in August so it was kind of in in this time frame here yeah so we pulled back
1421.44s:  down into the low 70s do you continue to see oil contracting further from here yeah absolutely I
1428.00s:  I I took a lot of grief up at 90 we were close to 95 I think at that high point um this fall
1437.44s:  a couple months ago and I had people coming out of the woodwork saying you're wrong you know
1442.88s:  even though I had called the move down to 60 initially or down to the mid 60s initially
1447.84s:  and then said it probably be in a trading range between 65 and 85 uh when it broke above 85 went to 95
1455.68s:  and everybody was saying it was a layup to 120 um they were just so sure I was way off on my call
1464.16s:  that proved to be the high watermark and it's been that downhill ever since and downhill pretty
1469.20s:  hard and fast um so yeah we're in mid 70s I think we go down to low 60s maybe 60 um and then
1479.36s:  bouts maybe back into the 70s before we head for 30 so um I'm still very much a bear on oil
1488.00s:  the story is still very much demand driven by a global recession and a global bust so I you know
1497.12s:  and it's funny when you look this fall one after another portfolio manager or analyst would come
1506.56s:  out on CNBC and elsewhere promoting energy as one of the attractive areas to own because they
1514.08s:  still thought it was a good value in that oil pressure we're we're gonna head higher because uh
1519.84s:  you know the band was tight I mean supply the band was tight and the truth is it's been the exact
1526.16s:  opposite so and I think there's a lot of risk in the energy sector in terms of the stock so
1532.96s:  I mean I'm very much at odds with what I think most portfolio managers um we're saying just a
1541.04s:  couple months ago I don't know if they're changing their tune but certainly the tape is negative
1547.44s:  yeah as a trader this isn't something I would be buying here maybe is a long-term investor if
1553.12s:  you're super bullish perhaps but when I look across the performance of sectors across multiple
1559.44s:  time frames the energy and this is excellent for anybody wondering this is the energy sector for
1564.00s:  the S&P 500 it's essentially this is a one-year daily chart and it's for all intense purposes flat
1570.64s:  and definitely since the fall it's been in a pretty significant drop from a high of 93 down to
1576.80s:  83 yeah this this doesn't look healthy to me at least for a bullish thesis this would be
1583.52s:  decent for a bearish thesis though I think yeah well my I have a target on XLE in the bust so not now
1592.40s:  but sometimes next year um in the bust I expect XLE to get down to 20 or below
1599.60s:  so you're where are you 85 yeah right now it's 83 yeah 83 so I mean that's
1606.96s:  that's a pretty good hand although I'm calling for an 80% peak to drop drop in the S&P too so
1614.16s:  probably fits right in yeah yeah because I just for a reference period I zoomed out quite a bit and
1619.68s:  it looks like the last time it traded in the low 20s was during COVID right yeah it hasn't been
1625.52s:  done there since yeah it was really that that drop when when oil went you know the futures went
1633.84s:  below zero you had a couple days here where oil is trading in negative territory if you remember
1639.60s:  back in 2020 and and so it took XLE down there too if you if you broaden this chart out to
1650.00s:  20 or 30 year chart you'll see a massive head and shoulder you know some people don't believe in those
1655.68s:  but in terms of something that long but you can see the shoulder um way over on the left side there
1662.00s:  yep I had it in another shoulder so well that counts down to 20 in my opinion
1670.40s:  that's really interesting to see kind of a head and shoulder pattern on something this long
1674.56s:  so when we're thinking about both first the melt up and then the bus let's talk about the melt up
1682.48s:  what's the structure of it within the sector breakdowns like what sectors do you see
1689.36s:  leading this melt up and then how does that in turn behave on the bust on the 2024 sure um I think the
1699.20s:  the leading sectors by the way I think expected to be a broad rally so a lot of the laggards are
1704.88s:  going to catch up I think the Russell the small cap are going to have their day in the sun you know
1710.48s:  there's been a lot of skepticism about that because it's been slow getting started but they're basically
1715.92s:  up 10% off their bottom of the last month um in beginning to catch up I think you know I have a
1722.64s:  target on uh the Russell 2000 of 3000 so would that be you know probably a better move than the S&P but
1731.28s:  but um so small cap will play large cap will play um I think semiconductors are going to be one
1741.20s:  of the big areas continuing their strengths they're at they've made all time new all time highs I
1747.36s:  mean that's something nobody so I was called for but nobody else um I said I have a target on SMH
1754.08s:  of 300 so that's basically it you know almost a double from here um you know 160 I think 162 so almost
1763.04s:  a double and I could double from here so um you know that that's a leader I think the miners are
1771.52s:  which are just waking up are going to be the outperformers um industrial stocks are not far off their
1779.76s:  highs they're going to do well I think the commodity stocks will do pretty well but also I think there's
1786.96s:  big catch up rallying in financials you know as rates come down I think you're going to see a big rally
1792.80s:  in the financials the stockbrookers to me are probably going to do very well you know if you have a
1799.92s:  50% move in the stock market or better over three or four months uh you can
1806.96s:  bet that the brokers are going to do very well um you know maybe I don't know if they'll double
1812.88s:  but they'll be up there you know certainly well over 50% um and the things that I you know so
1821.44s:  it's cross board I think you'll get some consumer discretionary I think uh we'll play
1827.92s:  housing will continue the home builders will continue to play even though home
1832.32s:  even though housing is has peaked and is rolling over the dynamic out there of of home builders being
1840.40s:  able to subsidize rates or offering you know buy down their interest rate and have enough margins
1846.72s:  still left over to make money on their houses because housing prices are up pretty good
1852.24s:  that will allow home builders the home builder group to continue to perform here
1860.24s:  so you know it's really an eclectic group of leaders where you'll probably see some lag
1867.76s:  doesn't mean they will go down but I suspect that you know the defensive areas will continue to lag
1874.88s:  healthcare has been lagging um uh consumer staples has been lagging
1882.64s:  oil obviously energy has been lagging and utilities even though utilities will get the benefit of
1888.88s:  rates continue to come down they're you know they can't give you the upside that you can get in
1894.40s:  some of these other sectors interesting so then my next question looking out at the bust
1902.96s:  is it kind of same word's going to be cross the board everybody is falling off a cliff here do you
1908.80s:  think that there will be some that are accelerating more so to the downside than others yeah I think
1914.00s:  it's it's probably going to be pretty all inclusive the you know as I say the two assets I'll
1920.40s:  talk about stock market but the two assets that probably will hold up um uh that I expect to hold
1927.04s:  up in the bust and meaning they probably won't lose money they may make money uh and very much
1933.28s:  should make money um would be treasury bonds and the whole treasury sector um because government
1941.12s:  guaranteed and rates will be coming down sharply um and and then cash I mean those and the dollar
1949.36s:  probably if somebody is looking at currency it's a dollar should not from here because I have a
1954.32s:  big call on the on the downside dollar here but from that bottom the dollar during the bus should
1960.08s:  do well so those are the only things I see basically fighting the the downtrend everything else
1965.20s:  across the board the stock market as I said I expect something close to an 80% drop peak to trough
1972.00s:  that to to get that it's pretty much across the board everything's going to fall pretty hard
1977.68s:  um you know energy will industrials will anything anything sick hookles going to get hard housing
1984.16s:  home builders will get hit hard um semiconductors will be hit hard uh so a lot of the things that
1990.88s:  will play here in the meltup will do a complete reversal uh in the bus or in the bear market so
1999.44s:  so this isn't you know again I don't I don't provide advice I'm not necessarily telling people how to
2005.60s:  play this I'm definitely not telling them how to play it and we have to make that decision based on
2011.92s:  their their ability to be nimble their ability to accept risk um because I can be wrong I mean
2017.52s:  you know to call something this dramatic and to say it's going to happen in the next several months
2024.64s:  um if it doesn't happen and you're you know you're you're all in on it you have to know the risk
2030.56s:  you're taking so it's really important for people not to just kind of go in as if well I play the
2036.32s:  market when it goes up and I get out when it goes it's not that easy as you know so so
2041.28s:  people have to be understand the risks they're taking when they're doing it um and understand that
2049.68s:  while there may be big man this is this is what makes it such a conundrum there may be some of the
2054.88s:  biggest returns just ahead that we've seen in certainly in my 50 year career um some of the
2062.48s:  biggest returns available at this end in in the short time but they'll be evaporating away
2071.20s:  just as quickly so so yes great returns but also great risk uh risk that you you know get out too
2079.60s:  late and you're caught in this shoot so off because I think a lot of this on the way up and on the
2085.04s:  way down is going to be steep now for the melt up you shared some pretty specific criteria that
2094.40s:  you were looking for kind of some specific catalyst I should say what does that look like for the
2099.28s:  bust what are the specific catalysts that then rotate us over from this parabolic melt up
2105.76s:  yeah so I don't know if I'd call the catalyst but certainly what I think um gets us a bust and I
2112.08s:  I have to make sure people understand that when I say bust I'm referring to the economy and the
2118.16s:  the overall financial system um as opposed to bear market is specific to the stock market obviously
2125.92s:  so bust and people say bust and they're referring to or what they really means to bear market um so
2132.72s:  bust when I'm referring to the economy and the financial system it's it's caused by the fact
2140.08s:  that we have more leverage on the system and again it's a global bust some more global leverage on
2145.04s:  the system or more leverage on the global system then we've ever had by a large margin I mean we
2152.80s:  are so much more leverage than we were in 2008-09 um lever the banks are levered not not ours so much
2160.00s:  ours are in better shape but banks around the world are very levered um the you know sovereign
2166.80s:  debt is through the roof uh and um you can say well the government has printing press or the central
2174.88s:  banks have a printing press so sovereign debt's not at risk well I would say it's probably true here
2180.72s:  I don't I don't think it's at risk in most of the world but you know you never know um we certainly
2187.60s:  seen sovereign debt go under before um and so I I use a simple kind of equation to define what I
2197.52s:  am seeing and that is um when you add the fragility that the pandemic caused even though it's
2206.00s:  you know a few years behind us now it still has led to a lot of fragility in the system
2212.88s:  we were talking about you know the savings that got built up government aid and all of that that's
2217.28s:  being wound down the fact that we had a moratorium on student debt and that's come back those are
2223.52s:  all things it's not a smooth ride it's like all of a sudden they get surprised that you know they
2228.88s:  weren't counting on having to pay back debt and now they have to again um so there's fragility in
2235.20s:  the system a what I call a massive leverage as I say 300 and somehow trillion in debt across
2245.92s:  the globe now and then plus what I call a huge central bank policy era error you know it's
2260.00s:  it's a fed policy era but it's also happening in the ECB and bank Canada you know
2269.60s:  Australia I'm sure China's you know making their problem you know their economy is evaporating
2278.80s:  so so you're seeing what I think is overtightening because central banks are saying we're
2285.04s:  going to tighten until we see the results of our tightening by then because of lags are typically
2291.28s:  six to nine months or maybe even a year you end up by definition being many many months too late
2297.84s:  and recognizing that you went too far when you finally realize it and that's what I think when
2303.28s:  I was talking early in our interview about maybe hitting a brick wall that it may be not I'm not
2309.84s:  saying December or even January but it may be within a few months that um we find out that
2318.64s:  you know the Fed finds out that they did go way too far you know things happen start happening fast
2324.32s:  we're starting to see signs that they the banking systems you know lending is dropping fast
2333.76s:  you know the bank loans you're seeing that drop you're seeing you know the reverse repo
2343.04s:  that's coming down a lot that's a sign I think of the banks wanting that liquidity so there's
2349.12s:  something going on out there that suggests that we're we're getting close to an inflection point
2355.28s:  between a economy seemingly was okay and people are talking about soft landing and maybe two or
2361.44s:  three months from now we're going to be talking about a hard landing and ultimately a very hard
2365.36s:  thing so is you're referencing the leverage and then liquidity are you hinting at some sort of
2373.12s:  credit contraction here that then leads to a rapid acceleration of the bust
2381.36s:  ultimately I think that that comes about I mean you know think of 2008-09 it will happen
2387.60s:  differently this time but that's basically you know that's what happened it became a domino effect
2395.20s:  I don't know whether it's mid-year next year or sooner but that's kind of what I'd say is likely
2403.04s:  the time frame for you know some some time second quarter let's say and might be late second quarter
2409.52s:  might be earlier but where I think you could start seeing the results of central banks having
2420.08s:  way overtaken and so yes you could have bank failures certainly credit spreads widening none of
2429.28s:  that is showing up yet by the way I mean the credit spreads are narrow so that's why I don't want
2435.20s:  people jumping on this and saying well it could be next week or it could be next month we're not
2441.28s:  you know we'll get some some war I'm picking on things you know seeing things that are kind of
2447.92s:  precursors to the precursors so you know there's still time before that happened and that's why you
2453.44s:  can have a meltdown but there are dangerous signs out there that are suggesting that we're moving
2462.24s:  in that direction and that ultimately what I mean by a global bust is a as I say 2008-09 we
2470.40s:  came close to a global bust it was when GE was rumored to be unable to access the commercial paper
2480.00s:  market and they were so dependent on the commercial paper market that there were rumors that they weren't
2485.04s:  going to make it you know this was when you know city bank was selling you the couple bucks and
2490.88s:  you know the the money center banks were all in trouble and then also GE looks like they may go
2495.92s:  under and it's one of our blue chips and if if the Fed and the government had not acted very quickly
2504.56s:  to assure the commercial paper market state open and liquid we could have seen the bust then so a
2513.44s:  bust will be going that next step beyond 2008-09 where where I think the financial system can go into
2520.40s:  free fall and like I said I'm not so worried about us banks were better you know there's kind
2526.96s:  of party risks you can never say that it can't happen even though they're better capitalized this time
2532.80s:  if if the European banks start going under they can take ours and you know we can have real trouble
2538.48s:  too so you know I think more of the risks are overseas this time in the banking system but we
2545.84s:  saw in March there's plenty of vulnerability in the regional banks and we also saw how fast
2553.92s:  banks can become ill-wit with right I mean the money starts flowing out of those regional banks
2560.08s:  as people get nervous and all of a sudden those banks go under or you know several we started
2567.36s:  seeing a domino effect there so so I I do think that we could see a free falling financial system
2574.24s:  which is why I continue to say this will be the worst financial crisis and certainly the post-World
2582.24s:  War II era I'm being worse in 2008-09 and could be the worst in history because of the size of it
2591.04s:  if you were to steal man your argument and to think of an alternate scenario on how this could
2599.28s:  play out differently what would that look like um well I could be wrong in terms of
2606.80s:  um the magnitude of I mean I do think we're going beyond a soft landing but I could be wrong
2612.88s:  that it gets to a point of an extreme hard landing and we start seeing this you know financial
2618.88s:  crisis overseas that then spills over into the whole globe it might not get that bad
2627.92s:  and therefore it might not require the kind of central bank response I'm talking about for the
2635.52s:  other side but I you know I'm pretty pretty comfortable with my forecast I think you know the
2643.28s:  likelihood is it's going to be a harder landing than 2008-09 right yeah the reason why like
2651.12s:  exploring that side is just to see what alternate path what alternate trajectory things could go
2658.00s:  so I I think thinking through especially something quite so parabolic is just an interesting
2663.92s:  thought exercise for me you mentioned a little bit earlier about the financial system and what
2671.60s:  I was picking up was just financial stress right on the entire system across the board is this the
2677.36s:  kind of thing that you think literally can break the existing financial system and if so what
2683.84s:  happens in that scenario yeah here I say I differ from you know the the peters shifts of the world
2692.16s:  out there who will basically are saying we're going to see a you know break of the system I think
2697.68s:  or or those in the Austrian school that think we're getting you know this kind of cleansing of
2704.48s:  the system you know really breaks and then you start over with the much better system I differ
2711.04s:  from believing that this is that break because the central banks you know this busted I'm calling
2718.96s:  forward is going to be deflationary bust because we're you know we're heading towards two percent
2723.84s:  inflation now if you get the break I think you're going to get up in the global economy you know
2728.72s:  quickly go into deflation if you go into deflation that gives central banks around the world almost
2736.24s:  infinite ability of print money because the lag to when that deflation then turns into or that
2741.92s:  money turns into inflation again will be a couple of years you know if you're in deflation you're
2746.96s:  not going to be back in inflation or high inflation a year later you know it's going to be a
2751.60s:  couple of years so that means they're going to be focused on saving the system right if it's
2756.72s:  right in front of them you you've got two things you're looking at one is right in front of me is
2763.76s:  an economy that's collapsing a financial system is collapsing but I know that if I print too much
2769.76s:  money a couple of years from now there's a risk that that might cause inflation what do you think
2775.20s:  they're going to be focused on they're going to be focused on the collapsing system so that means
2780.56s:  they will print as much money as they have to destabilize the system my argument is it took five
2787.60s:  trillion to do it back in 2020 I think this is magnitudes of that so I think we're looking at a 20
2795.60s:  trillion expansion of the Fed balance sheet this time that's four times that and you know something
2802.32s:  proportional to that around the world so it's it's that massive printing of money or pumping of
2810.88s:  liquidity into the system that will stop the free fall but it doesn't happen immediately you know
2817.36s:  and they're not going to go right from you know they're not going to say okay let's throw 20
2822.56s:  trillion in there because I know that's what we need they're at this point they'd say that's
2827.76s:  never going to happen you're never going to see you're not even going to see five trillion again in
2831.68s:  fact they're telling us they don't want to do QE ever again you know or or ever see that kind of
2837.44s:  thing again so that's part of the reason why we're going to have a bust is because they're so
2842.08s:  reluctant to repeat the mistake of 2020 it get right and frankly the mistake of the last 20 years
2849.76s:  of being the Fed put so if they really believe that their you know their job is to get the
2857.60s:  balance sheet back to normal and normal being pre-2020 they they actually and I've seen them say
2865.44s:  this they actually believe they can get the balance sheet back to you know three or four trillion
2871.12s:  from nine that they could take that five trillion back that's a real problem I mean because
2877.84s:  there's no way that can happen you know they're down to trillion or a little more now and they're
2884.08s:  already I think they're going too far so so but not to jump around but I do think that the the
2893.44s:  magnitude of the free fall means they'll start reluctantly playing in you know trillion to trillion
2901.20s:  whatever and it will do nothing to stop anything so they pour in a few more trillion it does nothing
2907.44s:  to stop anything or maybe stop something for a week or two and then trouble comes again
2913.12s:  ultimately this thing just you know if you have the global financial system in clothing
2920.56s:  it takes a lot to stop that and they're not going to know what a lot is until after the fact I
2928.32s:  mean they're only going to know with a lag to what they do and they're going to just keep pumping money
2934.16s:  every time they see more crisis coming at them so so it's going to you know it's going to play out
2939.52s:  over many months not over a few weeks but there'll be chunks of money coming in week by week month by
2947.68s:  month ultimately when you look back I mean I was the total seed of the pants guess but I'm guessing
2955.76s:  you'll see something close to a 30 trillion dollar fed balance sheet and that that 30 trillion
2963.28s:  dollar fed balance sheet or the additional 20 trillion will probably be pretty close to matched
2970.56s:  by the amount of new debt coming out of the government meaning they're going to come up with every
2976.56s:  new program they can to stimulate things you know okay pension funds are failing we're going to
2982.40s:  we're going to put through another bill you know we need four trillion dollars to support the pension fund
2990.32s:  and problem so that you know nobody loses out on their pension you know we're going to the endowments
2998.48s:  are failing well we don't want that that means you know we're going to see all these colleges fail
3002.72s:  we're going to we're going to support the endowments you know you're going to see money coming out
3007.52s:  of everywhere I mean coming out of the government for everywhere and you know there's probably going
3013.28s:  to be universal income there's probably going to be all kinds of programs that I think are going
3020.24s:  to only exacerbate the problem down the road you know you're going to create another problem
3026.56s:  but while you're in the midst of this crisis they're not going to they're not going to stop I mean
3032.00s:  they're not going to they're not going to think long term at all they're going to be only thinking
3036.56s:  about how do we get ourselves out of this crisis how do you have your thought
3044.32s:  yeah well that's why I think we go from I mean it sounds crazy and I keep saying we're at the end
3050.48s:  living 80 or 90 years super cycle you know between two depressions and that's why we can go from
3058.08s:  you know what what I think is a melt-up this year to an 80% down next year to an inflation cycle
3065.68s:  like we've never seen before where we see 25% inflation rates by the end of the decade
3071.12s:  and then it collapse of the system in the 2030s because you know you're dealing with
3077.12s:  everything in in terms of what's right before you without any thought
3084.72s:  to what you're creating beyond that so you know by the time you realize you've over tightened here
3092.16s:  you create the opposite problem where you can have to over ease then you create this huge and
3097.28s:  because of leverage it's you know it's not over it's not overusing by a little bit it's overusing by
3103.60s:  tens of trillions by the time you realize that that created an inflation problem you're well into
3110.64s:  an overheating that you can't stop and then what you do and you know obviously we'll have to
3116.16s:  service our debt which I don't know how you do that when rates are roaring away so you're you're
3123.28s:  getting into that place where the elastic band gets stretched and then it's like a bungee cord
3129.20s:  it gets stretched and stretched the other way and you know the waves get much bigger.
3135.44s:  Yeah well one of the things I am hopeful for is that when we're going through this process of
3141.60s:  you know passing a lot of these different bills and whatnot to potentially try to keep the lights on
3147.04s:  maybe we could finally get the daylight savings bill through as well so that it doesn't keep
3152.56s:  getting fucking 430 that would be okay that would ease the pain a little bit.
3157.52s:  Yeah I don't understand you know who gets her backup over something like that you'd think
3164.48s:  that that would be one thing that you could get both parties and all sides to agree on and you know
3170.40s:  even that they can't solve. That was the joke I ran for a while I said you know we're in trouble
3176.32s:  when like you can't even you can't even unify behind something that everybody universally hates.
3182.32s:  Yep. So before we wrap up you talked a little bit about some of the commodities right so we
3189.04s:  talked about some gold we didn't talk too much about metals so how do metals behave during this cycle.
3197.20s:  Yeah I'm glad you asked because I think I think metals are just coming alive.
3202.64s:  It's been a long wait they had a great run and you know from the March lows in 2020 to
3209.84s:  August highs particularly silver but silver and gold both they went sideways to down and
3217.68s:  prime more down than sideways from August 2020 to just a little while ago and we are coming out of that
3226.88s:  now gold gold performed better than silver so gold you know not very far off it's all time highs
3234.64s:  and I think you're going to be there probably this year you know I think could be there in a
3240.56s:  couple weeks but whereas silver has got a longer way to go I mean you know the the old high I think
3248.00s:  was up there 50 or 48 some are up there I think silver can get 60 but there's going to be a longer
3254.32s:  slog or you know a steeper slog to get there so but you can see you had that that's so off I
3263.52s:  presume that trough for this 2020 is that is that where we are yeah so this is this is actually a
3270.40s:  year ago so let me zoom out a little bit more to get closer to thesis yeah so on this one 2021 is
3276.24s:  back here if you want 2020 we can go five years so here's 2020 back here yeah so you see you had
3282.40s:  that quick sell off in March 2020 then you had the big run up and and then you can see it's been
3288.56s:  basically a sideways down consolidation pattern you know when you're in it and because I've heard
3294.00s:  this from plenty of people on Twitter when you're in it it feels like it's been got off of all you
3298.48s:  know it's all it's been is just straight down but if you look at it from a five-year chart it's a
3303.84s:  consolidation you know it's just a long square root pattern or you know cup and handle whatever you
3310.00s:  want to call it and we're going to come out of that long almost four-year consolidation three
3316.96s:  and a half-year consolidation we're going to come out of that vertically and head I think to 60
3322.96s:  and maybe even to 75 before the bust so that means you know I'm basically thinking and I can be off
3330.64s:  by months many months but I'm thinking there's a decent chance that we come out of this
3337.76s:  and see silver at six somewhere between 60 and 75 by the middle of the year
3343.84s:  and same thing gold I think you bust out above 2100 you know 2070 wherever the 2080 wherever the
3353.44s:  high was you're almost there you bust above that and you're going to have run to 3000 very quickly
3359.52s:  so again within the next six six seven months and and then you correct in the bust with most assets
3368.88s:  I'm not sure if you correct back to here silver probably does correct back
3373.68s:  a longer you know it's going to be a it's a more cyclical metal so it'll get harder gold might hold
3379.68s:  up a little better because of its safety features or it's you know in a crisis some people might run
3385.84s:  to it but I still think it probably goes from 3000 back towards 2000 and then once you get you know
3394.40s:  well into the bust and and these assets start to just paying the next cycle I think gold goes to
3400.24s:  20,000 silver goes to 500 you know you're going to have a big run so there's a big run directly ahead
3409.04s:  than a then a big correction and then a huge run in you know between let's say 2025 and 2030
3418.32s:  so I think the metals you can see what they did you know if you take a long chart and look back
3425.84s:  they had great runs in the first part of this decade the first part of this century you know
3430.48s:  20 2001 to 2011 was a huge run 2016 was a big run what I see here looks a lot like
3440.96s:  20 60 and particularly in the in the miners looks a lot like 2016 and 2020 those runs so
3448.88s:  you know you've got some very fast vertical runs I think coming they got to work through particularly
3455.28s:  the miners have to work through a lot of overhead resistance so it's hard to tell
3461.12s:  exactly when they'll run and when they'll correct you know in a stair step fashion but
3466.40s:  I think we're going to find as people start warming up to them this is a pretty thin group
3472.24s:  you know there's not a lot of liquidity in those stocks so that once once some of the institutions
3478.24s:  start seeing the momentum and decide they want to allocate the gold silver in the miners
3484.96s:  I think you could see very thin markets you know where where you get a lot of price moving in a hurry
3490.48s:  in terms of other metals I'm bullish copper I think copper is probably going to get up to
3499.44s:  six dollars pre-bust that's pretty big run since we're in the you know three 70 area I think
3505.28s:  or maybe lower and and I think the you know copper producers are going to do pretty well
3513.36s:  in that period too so and you know other metals still to me looks like a big performer I
3521.84s:  didn't mention them before when I was talking you know industries that will do well but I think
3526.80s:  steel industry which has been flat-dance back for many years looks to me to have great potential in
3534.08s:  the melt-up so you know you could get pretty big move there iron ore obviously would be similar
3543.60s:  some of the other industrial metals I think can play so that may seem counterintuitive because I'm
3548.56s:  talking about an economy is going into recession I think what happens in this melt-up
3555.84s:  as people will choose to first of all they're not going to see the hard landing that I'm caught for
3560.72s:  they're going to be seeing soft landing and I think they're going to be willing to look over the
3565.68s:  trough because the Fed has done tightening and if the Fed actually eases they're definitely going
3570.72s:  to look over the trough I think so I know I should this is kind of a caveat I know there's a lot of
3580.16s:  people that have seen the chart that says when the Fed starts cutting that's when the stock market
3587.36s:  does worse right so and I've said I'm not even calling for cuts now the cuts could come in the
3593.84s:  bust and that I'm just saying pause means end of tightening and that will be received initially
3599.84s:  very bullishly but I just question people from buying too much into a narrative that is driven by
3610.80s:  you know some chart that says every time the Fed cuts rates that's the top in the stock market
3616.40s:  you know I just don't I don't think it's going to work like clockwork necessarily I do
3621.52s:  you know obviously I do have a bearish view it's just not before we have this wrong
3626.08s:  right well and as you've pointed out before right things change and as new information comes out
3633.60s:  things do change and it's always interesting to see how you piece all of these different moving
3639.36s:  things together into your thesis I am very curious to see how the boom and bust thesis kind of
3647.04s:  plays out because it definitely has been a long time coming I know from you and I when we first
3651.28s:  started talking you'd been envisioning this for some time so hearing you talk about the
3656.48s:  melt up being underway is really intriguing to me so I'm excited to to see how it all plays out for
3662.16s:  me as a trader my life is simple I trade very short-term time frames so whatever happens couldn't
3667.84s:  care less my job is to capture small improvements but I get to enjoy the ride which is pretty cool but
3672.72s:  sure yep I mean you've shared a ton of awesome information thank you so much for taking some time
3679.20s:  to hang out I really enjoyed doing these with you so looking forward to catching up with you again
3683.84s:  but before we sign off as per always working people get a hold of you I'm sure I'm on Twitter so it's
3689.76s:  Dave H. Contrarian or at Dave H. Contrarian I'm on there most days doing battle with everybody it's
3699.28s:  a little easier these days because the markets go into my favor but as you well know I've I've had
3705.20s:  plenty of critics along the way so it's it's the plight of a Contrarian if you're and particularly one
3711.68s:  that's an extreme Contrarian as I am that you know people are going to think you're nuts because you
3718.32s:  were the only one saying something you know but but as as the market moves in my direction people come
3725.36s:  my way it doesn't look quite so crazy so so I'm there enjoying myself and and I also right they
3735.20s:  investment ladder that comes out quarterly if it's by subscription meaning there's a fee to it
3742.00s:  if people are interested in it they can direct message me on Twitter and I will provide details
3750.16s:  awesome and I'll make sure I'll throw a link to that in the notes below as well so that they could
3753.76s:  easily find you but until we have a chance to connect next time David thanks for hanging out for a bit
3759.20s:  yeah great see you Eric we probably won't talk to each other before Christmas so very Christmas to you
