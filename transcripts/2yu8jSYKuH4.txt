0.00s: What's up everybody Eric here welcome back to all the outliers and we are here with the
6.56s: outlier podcast and I have David Hunter back on I think this is probably like your seventh
12.30s: or eighth time with us. We kind of catch up every quarter which serves as a really interesting
16.64s: way to follow along your view of markets how things are playing out and then to receive
21.64s: new information as you're seeing it. So first off welcome back great to have you.
26.40s: Yeah thanks Eric. Good to see you. Merry Christmas for happy Hanukkah whatever. Yeah we're
33.12s: getting now. I was saying right before we started you already got the red sweater on so you're
37.44s: quite festive which I can appreciate like I was just telling you my wife she started decorating
42.16s: for Christmas two weeks ago. So it's all a blur to me at this point but yeah man what a year.
50.88s: So I have a lot of things that I want to talk to you about. The very first one is the last time
57.60s: we connected for everybody's context you and I spoke sometime like mid to late August it was
62.88s: like right around there and at that point you felt the market was at kind of a decision point.
70.80s: We started to pull back speaking of the S&P 500 here. We started to pull back and you were saying
76.24s: that you felt we could either continue down towards you know like 4200 or that could have been
84.08s: the low that we ran up and out. Since then we fell down a little bit further to 4100 but then from
90.40s: there we've essentially have been up and out. What are your thoughts on that move? Yeah that was
97.20s: what I call a perfect retrace. I actually was almost a very symmetrical inverted head and shoulder
103.44s: so 4100 actually made sense but I didn't think we'd get quite down there but we did and then came
111.12s: right out of that and I said the week we turned I said it looks to me after we had a couple very
117.52s: strong days out of that bottom. It looks to me based on the fact that everybody's so bearish
122.96s: and the fact that the markets had two or three big days I said it looks like we're starting
128.96s: to melt up right now. I have been saying we'd probably really have to wait until you know new highs,
137.60s: new all-time highs to really get the market going but those first few days there was just so much
144.32s: behind them that it felt like we were going to just come out of that last pullback and then
150.56s: just keep going and that's really essentially what we've done. You can see the move you know came
157.28s: right down to a turn line bounced off it and you know I have moved right back up to that almost to
164.64s: that 4600 area that we started the correction from so I don't believe we're going to see
171.68s: any more 8 to 10 percent corrections until we get to the top you know could have three to five
178.16s: percent corrections at any time so you know I'm not saying we can't you know there's going to go
184.56s: straight up but pretty close I mean I think we are looking at a steep rally what a meltup means
190.72s: is something that's parabolic ultimately parabolic and very steep and you cover an awful lot of ground
196.48s: in a matter of months so that's what I think we're into now you know could we go back to
204.40s: 434400 before we take off to new highs we could will we I have no idea you know I think a lot
213.68s: depend on what numbers come out that you know trigger something so let's say tomorrow I think you
220.72s: get the PCE tomorrow the you know the inflation number that the the Fed tends to watch if that
228.32s: number is elevated we've seen some signs here in the last couple months that inflation's come back
234.08s: if if that number is elevated it certainly could cause a couple hundred point sell off in the S&T
240.96s: if not we may just off to the races you know be off to the races so it can go either way in the very
247.44s: short term either you know as a macro strategy so I'm not trying to call you know the day-to-day
254.00s: week-to-week sometimes I see setups like I did at 4600 for that pullback down to 4100 but you
263.84s: know generally the story from here going forward is that we're in the melt-up I think and that
269.76s: melt-up is going to take us to 6,000 for sure and I think there's very good odds that we're going
276.32s: to see 7,000 on the S&P maybe you know I think likely in the first quarter doesn't have to happen
284.40s: in the first quarter but I think that's that's the likelihood and obviously if we do that
290.80s: you know you're talking about a better you know something 50% or better appreciation from here
301.84s: and in a matter of months I mean that's what I mean by historic melt-up it's going to be something
308.16s: we don't see very often so looking at the catalyst last time we spoke you would mention a few things
315.04s: you would mention oil contracting dollar contracting and then the rate environment looking to change
322.56s: when we last spoke there was still some semblance of another rate hike even whereas now if we look
329.68s: at the Fed watch tool you just look at bond probabilities you can see that essentially that's gone
335.52s: since the last time we spoke it's the right probability of a hike is minuscule and again we
340.64s: talked about this last time you made a very clear note that Wall Street is thinking one thing the
346.24s: Fed could be thinking something different but right now that's just what Wall Street is saying
350.88s: so how does that play into your view of the rate environment changing as a catalyst we're now
358.32s: we're even looking at potentially a rate contraction starting as early as spring of next year
364.16s: is that a key function still of this parabolic melt-up or is that a little bit too late based on the
369.68s: time from you were just sharing now essentially what you're getting and I think I've talked about this
374.48s: for several months is you're getting what I expected you'd get which is you've gone from a
381.20s: headwind of Fed tightening and and Powell reiterating at every meeting higher for longer and you know
390.48s: whether we hike more or whether we you know just stay at these elevated levels that we are
395.92s: basically not done you've gone from that headwind in just a matter of leaks to where the street feels
403.76s: pretty comfortable that the Fed is done you're starting to get some and this is this is new some of
411.04s: the Fed officials coming out and actually saying we we can even entertain a cut if certain things
418.96s: happen you know that if inflation comes down to our levels if the economy weakens you know cuts
426.40s: aren't off the table at some point next year so so those are you know beginning signs at the Fed
433.28s: starting to recognize that maybe they've done enough now I've said they've done too much
439.44s: I think I think when you're seeing the 10 year drop from 5% to today I think got down to 4.5
450.72s: and it's just above that now to drop 75 basis points in a matter of a month that is the street seeing
462.24s: the economy stopped on a dime I mean you basically you just got the revisions you know 5.2% GDP
469.52s: in the third quarter you know up from 4.9% they're pre-assessment so so third quarter looks
476.88s: gangbusters but basically almost like clockwork is the quarter ended things that left the table and
484.96s: I think we may be in recession right now as silly as that sounds because you're starting from a
489.36s: strong quarter you know it usually takes a while but you know what those sales look pretty crummy
496.72s: housing sales look pretty crummy you know there's real signs that we may have hit a brick wall on
502.08s: the economy and you know still the rhetoric out there is soft landing because you know obviously
508.32s: looking at their quarter looks like things are not going to recession anytime soon but I'm saying
514.56s: there is a good chance that what what the market in the aggregate is picking up
520.16s: is that the economy is weakening pretty fast here that we you know and that's how that's how
524.80s: recessions happen is you can go from seemingly all okay to trouble in a hurry I mean I can remember
533.68s: and September of 2008 I was talking about a financial crisis the likes of which we hadn't seen in
544.96s: the in the post-war were two eras and almost every Wall Street economist was saying soft landing
551.44s: no no recession in sight weeks later you know we had leaving just two or three weeks after that
559.76s: and and and everything it came after that weeks after the the economist I mean weeks not months
566.16s: weeks after the economist were saying no recession in sight we were in the worst financial crisis
572.72s: in in the post-war were two era so things can happen fast when they happen and that's what I think
580.80s: the Fed's going to be surprised by and it's and that's where I think you you run into the problems
586.56s: of having academic economists making judgments every month and thinking they can kind of
594.08s: you read the tea leaves every month and make their judgments incrementally as they go along
599.60s: this is how how economies and financial systems happen is everything seems seemingly going
606.16s: no okay until it's not and I think we're very close to that point where it's not now that doesn't
613.92s: mean we're going because everybody knows I've got a global bus forecast for 2024 it doesn't
619.52s: mean we're going from you know seemingly decent economy to a bus with nothing in between it just
627.68s: means the economy is going to slow down quite a bit here and it's going to cause the Fed to recognize
634.32s: maybe something they don't even recognize today recognize in the next month or two that they
640.88s: actually do have to reverse course here pretty fast that that is a trigger for a belt up I mean
646.88s: that's what I think the streets beginning to pick up on or the the market in the aggregate the market
653.36s: in the aggregate is not the same as compiling you know street well street strategist opinions it's
662.16s: the market in the aggregate which is a law of large numbers when you put everybody together the
667.76s: market is a pretty good predictor of what's going on that doesn't it's not necessarily the same
674.56s: as what a consensus of economists or strategists are thinking in fact that's usually not the same so
681.28s: so I'm talking about the market in its you know in its ability to discount things is beginning to
688.00s: pick up that the economy is rolling over the dollars rolling over rates are rolling over
695.20s: and those are bullish things for the stock market in the next few months one of the things you
702.24s: brought up that I thought was curious was the GDP which is why I pulled it up here you were
707.68s: mentioning the possibility that we might be in a recession already my question is when you look
713.28s: at something like this where we see Q2 real GDP grew 2.1 percent where is the idea of potentially
721.28s: being a recession fit in with actual realized GDP growth well um so so um I'm just looking at what
731.36s: you have up here you said what would you say for 2.1 percent for second quarter you have
739.04s: fitted increased 2.1 percent yeah we're we're up to five you know 5.2 percent so um you know
747.04s: uh it's again it's backward looking you're measuring an economy quarter by quarter um looking
756.72s: backwards and that's what I'm saying is you can you can have things change it typically isn't so
763.60s: convenient to the changes right at a quarter beginning or quarter end but that's seemingly
768.72s: what's happening here at least from kind of the end total reports I'm getting um you know
775.36s: autos are really slowing down quickly here um and and a lot of that is because we just had this big
781.60s: bump in interest rates in the fall so you know we had like I said the 10 years falling 75
788.96s: basis points here but in a few months previous to that it had gone up 75 base points so you've had
795.04s: this you know you had and mortgage rates went up to you know seven and almost 8 percent so
801.92s: you know you've had this big bump in rates um that is affecting the rate sensitive areas of
809.28s: the economy and those happen to be big areas of the economy um you know it's it's impacting housing
815.12s: obviously that's a big area or construction it's impacting autos used to be we would say as GM
822.56s: goes so goes the economy uh that's not necessarily true today because GM's a smaller less impactful
830.00s: company but it is as the auto industry goes so goes the economy autos are a big still big part of
836.64s: the economy and if that's really changing here um you know in the next few months you're going to see
842.08s: it's going to impact on GDP so backward looking yeah the economy in third quarter was strong
847.60s: forward looking I don't think the next quarter is going to be so strong got it so talk to me a
855.12s: little bit more about how you view some of these different tools like you brought up automotive
860.24s: sales I've definitely heard that before same thing with like home sales we were just talking about GDP
865.20s: how do you wait these different indicators to determine the prevalent direction because as you said
870.16s: if we do look at something like GDP that's been expanding although it's you know previous looking
876.24s: if you look at something like auto sales it's also a previous looking but to your point you
880.48s: are seeing that that's contracting um how do you fit all these together to then make your assessment
887.04s: yeah it's not it's not very scientific because I I am certainly not um the quantitative type that
894.88s: believes that you that the market fits in with that so in other words the market is disguying
901.76s: things many many months in advance so I don't really care what fourth quarter GDP is you know
908.16s: whether it comes in negative or positive I'm just saying that you're seeing a net change
912.64s: at the margins you know second derivative change um in terms of the rate of change
919.52s: in the economy in in some of the important components of the economy you're also seeing it in
925.60s: um you know the credit card the link with these and you're seeing it in um you know
932.16s: the consumer pulling back on large purchases you know the more capital goods intensive purchases
939.92s: so in the summer they use you know they pull back on consumption so they could
945.28s: are of goods so they could do travel now they're going back the other way and I suspect Christmas
950.72s: will be okay um but other things may not be as strong like you know durable goods because
957.84s: they have limited ability to spend they can't spend across the board so they have to kind of pick
963.84s: and choose they're still shopped till you drop they still want to they still want to spend but
969.28s: they have to be more selective about their spending this is honestly worse than I thought I hadn't
977.36s: looked at this little while this is Dylan Cootie rates on credit card loans for commercial banks
983.36s: yeah commercial banks excuse me this is did I didn't expect it to be quite this steep
989.60s: is this what do you make of this like I definitely thought it would be expanding but I didn't
994.24s: realize it would be expanding quite to this degree yeah no it's it's basically I think we're at
999.84s: the link see rates that are worse than 2008 nine so you're you know what you're seeing is the
1008.72s: the problem of a haven't have not a kind we've talked about this before you know the top 10
1014.64s: personality the wealth has plenty of money and and you know it feels no problem you know the market's
1024.00s: not that far off highs and real estate's up you know up through the roof so those guys feel pretty
1030.80s: good but those at the bottom man the bottom probably 20 or 30 percent are second wind I mean and
1039.44s: you know they've we started talking about this many many months ago they were using their credit cards
1046.32s: to pay for groceries because their budgets couldn't withstand the inflation they were seeing at
1051.36s: the grocery store so you know those that really have limited incomes are struggling
1059.36s: mightily already you know you did have obviously the whole influx of money that came from the
1067.92s: government during the pandemic and that's being drawn down so you know that's where you're
1074.72s: beginning to see the friction also and why this thing can stop on a dime is I think you're
1079.84s: reaching the point where a lot of that that money that was pumped in from the government and
1087.12s: you know boost savings up to a 35 percent savings rate at one point unheard of that's all yeah a lot
1093.52s: of that's been drawn down it's allowed this thing to stretch out it's allowed the cycle to continue
1099.68s: longer than I thought it would longer than most economists thought it would but I think we're
1106.08s: reaching the end of that and the linkages are assigned and and one of the reasons why I think as
1113.44s: we get into 2024 we ultimately go into a bus because there's debt everywhere I mean the consumer
1121.20s: indebtedness is problematic sovereign debt is problematic you know corporate debt some you know a
1128.56s: lot of corporations are in pretty good shape but there's obviously those that the lesser rating
1135.44s: end of the spectrum that are very leveraged so yeah I think consumer linkages or credit
1143.20s: credit linkages just another sign that we are moving towards something that's not going to be
1149.36s: pretty and you know I think I think soft landing is a pipe dream it's curious because like you
1156.88s: are highlighting we're maybe halfway to where we saw the peak a little less so then during 2008
1164.88s: 2009 in terms of delinquencies but the part that I find interesting is this all took place obviously
1171.52s: during a very rapid interaction in economic functions during a just massive economic collapse
1180.08s: whereas this has been on a bit of a smooth scale slope up at a decent clip supposedly during a
1187.60s: time frame or were not in a recession yeah so in other words if you were to compare you'd want to
1193.76s: compare the period in 2006 seven you know going into 2008 right and you know it's it's what will come
1205.36s: probably in the next year where you're going to see it surpass 2008-9 so yeah I mean it's we
1213.28s: haven't even gotten to the recession yet that's as you correctly point out that's where this thing
1218.64s: can go pretty vertical interesting and then the other thing you highlighted that I wanted to grab
1223.76s: this is from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics just on car sales and it really highlights
1229.20s: a couple interesting things that I wanted to get your take on so the first one is the production
1234.24s: which is this red line production is cratered this is production thousands of vehicles is on the
1241.44s: Y-axis and then the X-axis is just the year where production has gone from over you know 4,000
1247.76s: units down to sub two and it was at 4,000 units in 2015 and this is just cratered and then as we
1256.40s: look at like sold passenger vehicles exactly as you were talking about that's contracted massively
1261.52s: so is this how do these two things wait against one another or is it more of you use them in conjunction
1268.64s: with one another things like automotive sales and then the link one sees yeah I'm not I mean I'm not
1277.92s: not away in the list so I don't really look at this in detail but what I'd say is obviously we had
1284.64s: the supply chain issues for a while there so that was some of the production issues and then
1294.40s: you know I'm not sure whether the strike probably had something to do with some of the the supply
1301.68s: issues now or or production cuts but but you know looking at this I would guess
1308.08s: inventories let's see in my eyes are not too good here but yeah the red is commercial passenger
1317.92s: vehicle inventory essentially the production yeah so yeah so looking at this inventory is seemingly
1323.68s: being good shape the problem is I think demand I mean it's same story I've been telling about oil
1331.60s: you can sit and focus on supply but if demand is going to fall off you know there's going to be
1337.84s: an inventory build and I think the other companies this time around have another issue as well which
1344.56s: is they decided in their infinite wisdom that they knew best what the market wanted and they
1353.52s: jumped whole hog into you know electric vehicles and the market saying we're not really that
1359.52s: interested in electric vehicles hybrids maybe but not electric vehicles so so you've got you know
1365.12s: you've got a mixed problem you've got a lot of Kaplik spenders who's going into the companies
1371.52s: transforming themselves for what they think is going to be a big EV future and and then you've got
1377.60s: a recession about to smack them down so I think the certainly the auto manufacturers that have made
1384.40s: the big bets meaning Ford and GM maybe in for a real tough time in 2024
1393.68s: you mentioned oil before so I grabbed just crude oil here this is a one-year chart
1402.96s: it's definitely contracted quite a bit when you and I spoke last time you would
1407.20s: talked about potentially oil getting down into the 60s and for reference when we spoke again it was
1415.28s: in August so it was kind of in in this time frame here yeah so we pulled back down into the low 70s
1423.36s: do you continue to see oil contracting further from here yeah absolutely I took a lot of grief up
1430.00s: at 90 we were close to 95 I think at that high point this fall a couple months ago and I had people
1439.84s: coming out of the woodwork saying you're wrong you know even though I had called the move down to
1444.48s: 60 initially or down to the mid 60s initially and then said it probably in a trading range between
1450.40s: 65 and 85 when it broke above 85 went to 95 and everybody was saying it was a layup to 120
1460.72s: they were just so sure I was way off on my call that proved to be the high water mark and it's been
1466.88s: downhill ever since and downhill pretty hard and fast so yeah we're in mid 70s I think we go down
1474.40s: to low 60s maybe 60 and then bounce maybe back into the 70s before we head for 30 so I'm still
1486.00s: very much a bear on oil the story is still very much demand driven by a global recession and a global
1494.72s: bust so I you know and it's funny when you look this fall one after another portfolio manager or
1505.12s: analyst would come out on CNBC and elsewhere promoting energy as one of the attractive areas
1512.40s: to own because they still thought it was a good value in that oil pressure we're we're going to
1518.24s: head higher because you know the band was tight I mean supply the band was tight and the truth is
1525.28s: it's been the exact opposite so and I think there's a lot of risk in the energy sector in terms of
1531.52s: the stock so I mean I'm very much at odds with what I think most portfolio managers were saying
1540.72s: just a couple months ago I don't know if they're changing their tune but certainly the tape is negative
1546.40s: yeah is a trader this isn't something I would be buying here maybe is a long-term investor if
1553.12s: you're super bullish perhaps but when I look across the performance of sectors across multiple time
1559.68s: frames the energy and this is excellent for anybody wondering this is the energy sector for the
1564.08s: S&P 500 it's essentially this is a one-year daily chart and it's for all intense purposes flat
1570.64s: and definitely since the fall it's been in a pretty significant drop from a high of 93 down to
1576.80s: 83 yeah this this doesn't look healthy to me at least for a bullish thesis this would be
1583.84s: decent for a bearish thesis though I think yeah well my I have a target on XLE in the bust so not now
1592.40s: but sometimes next year in the bust I expect XLE to get down to 20 or below
1599.52s: so you're where are you 85 yeah right now it's 83 yeah 83 so I mean that's that's a pretty good
1608.08s: hand although I'm calling for an 80% peak to drop drop in the S&P too so I probably fit right in
1615.84s: yeah yeah because I just for a reference period I zoomed out quite a bit and it looks like the
1620.16s: last time it traded in the low 20s was during COVID right yeah it hasn't been done there since
1626.32s: yeah it was really that that drop when when oil went you know the futures went below zero you
1634.80s: had a couple days here where oil is trading in negative territory if you remember back in 2020
1642.56s: and and so it took XLE down there too if you if you broaden this chart out to 20 or 30 year chart
1651.76s: you'll see a massive head and shoulder you know some people don't believe in those but in terms of
1657.36s: something that long but you can see the shoulder way over on the left side there yep I had it
1663.52s: in another shoulder so well that counts down to 20 in my opinion that's really interesting to see
1672.00s: kind of a head and shoulder pattern on something this long so when we're thinking about both first
1678.56s: the melt up and then the bus let's talk about the melt up what's the structure of it within
1685.52s: the sector breakdowns like what sectors do you see leading this melt up and then how does that
1692.96s: in turn behave on the bust on the 2024 sure um I think the the leading sectors by the way I
1701.68s: think expected to be a broad rally so a lot of the laggards are going to catch up I think the Russell
1707.12s: the small cap are going to have their day in the sun you know there's been a lot of skepticism
1711.92s: about that because it's been slow getting started but they're basically up 10% off their bottom
1717.44s: of the last month and beginning to catch up I think you know I have a target on the Russell 2000
1725.12s: of 3000 so would that be a you know probably a better move than the S&P but but um so small cap will
1735.20s: play large cap will play um I think semiconductors are going to be one of the big areas continuing their
1743.20s: strengths they're at they've made all time new all time highs I mean that's something nobody so I
1749.20s: was calling for but nobody else um I said I have a target on SMH of 300 so that's basically a
1757.44s: almost a double from here um you have to 160 I think 162 so almost a double and I could double from
1764.48s: here so um you know that that's a leader I think the miners are going to which are just waking up
1773.36s: are going to be the outperformers um industrial stocks are not far off their highs they're
1780.56s: going to do well I think the commodity stocks will do pretty well but also I think there's big catch
1787.44s: up rally in in financials you know as rates come down I think you're going to see a big rally in
1792.88s: the financials the stock brokers to me are probably going to do very well you know if you have a 50%
1800.56s: move in the stock market or better over three or four months uh you can bet that the brokers are
1808.48s: going to do very well um you know maybe I don't know if they'll double but they'll be up there you know
1815.04s: certainly well over 50% um and the things that I you know so it's cross-board I think you'll get some
1824.00s: consumer discretionary I think uh we'll play uh housing will continue the home builders will
1829.92s: continue to play even though home even though housing is peaked and is rolling over the dynamic
1837.60s: out there of of home builders being able to subsidize rates or offering you know buy down their
1843.84s: interest rate and have enough margin still left over to make money on their houses because housing
1850.24s: prices are up pretty good that will allow home builders the home builder group to continue to perform
1857.92s: here um so you know it's really an eclectic group of leaders where you'll probably see some lag
1867.76s: doesn't mean they will go down but I suspect that you know the defensive areas will continue to lag
1874.88s: health care has been lagging um uh consumer staples has been lagging um oil obviously energy has been
1884.40s: lagging and utilities even though utilities will get the benefit of rates continuing to come down
1890.96s: they're you know they can't give you the upside that you can get in some of these other sectors
1897.52s: interesting so then my next question looking out at the bust is it kind of same word's
1905.28s: going to be cross-board everybody is falling off a cliff here do you think that there will be some
1909.68s: that are accelerating more so to the downside than others yeah I think it's it's probably going to
1915.36s: be pretty all-inclusive the you know as I say the two assets I'll talk about stock market but the
1921.68s: two assets that probably will hold up um that I expect to hold up in the bust and meaning they
1928.88s: probably won't lose money they may make money and very much should make money would be treasury bonds
1937.52s: and the whole treasury sector because government guaranteed and rates will be coming down sharply
1945.28s: um and and then cash I mean those and and the dollar probably if somebody is looking at currency
1951.36s: it's a dollar should not from here because I have a big call on the on a downside dollar here but
1957.52s: from that bottom the dollar during the bust should do well so those are the only things I see
1962.08s: basically fighting the the downtrend everything else across the board the stock market as I said I expect
1968.72s: something close to an 80% drop peak to trough that to to get that it's pretty much across the
1975.28s: board everything's going to fall pretty hard um you know energy will industrials will any the
1981.52s: anything sick hookle is going to get hard housing home builders will get hard um some
1987.28s: the conductors will be hard uh so a lot of the things that will play here in the melt-up will do a
1993.60s: complete reversal uh in the bust or in the bear market so um so this isn't you know again I don't
2002.24s: I don't provide advice I'm not necessarily telling people how to play this I'm definitely not telling
2007.92s: them how to play it and we have to make that decision based on their their ability to be nimble their
2013.36s: ability to accept risk um because I can be wrong I mean you know to call something this dramatic
2020.80s: and to say it's going to happen in the next several months um if it doesn't happen and you're
2026.96s: you know you're you're all in on it you have to know the risk you're taking so it's really important
2032.16s: for people not to just kind of go in as if well I play the market when it goes up and I get out when
2038.16s: it goes it's not that easy as you know so so people have to be understand the risks they're taking
2045.20s: when they're doing it um and understand that while there may be big man this is this is what makes
2052.24s: it such a conundrum there may be some of the biggest returns just ahead that we've seen in certainly
2059.76s: in my 50 year career um some of the biggest returns available at this in in in a short time but
2068.72s: they'll be evaporating away just as quickly so so yes great returns but also great risk uh risk
2077.92s: that you you know get out too late and you're caught in this shoot so off because I think a lot of
2083.68s: this on the way up and on the way down is going to be steep now for the melt up you shared some pretty
2092.72s: specific criteria that you were looking for kind of some specific catalyst I should say
2097.84s: what does that look like for the bust what are the specific catalysts that then rotate us over
2103.36s: from this parabolic melt up yeah so I don't know if I'd call the catalyst but certainly what I think
2110.72s: gets us a bust and I have to make sure people understand that when I say bust I'm referring to
2117.04s: the economy and the the overall financial system um as opposed to bear market is specific to the
2124.80s: stock market obviously so bust and people say bust and they're referring to what they really
2129.92s: means to bear market um so bust when I'm referring to the economy and the financial system it's
2138.00s: it's caused by the fact that we have more leverage on the system and again it's a global bust so more
2144.00s: global leverage on the system or more leverage on the global system then we've ever had by a large
2151.84s: margin I mean we are so much more leverage than we were in 2008-09 um lever the banks are levered
2158.64s: not not ours so much ours are in better shape but banks around the world are very levered
2165.36s: the you know sovereign debt is through the roof and you can say well government has printing press
2173.68s: or the central banks have a printing press so sovereign debt's not at risk well I would say it's
2179.84s: probably true here I don't I don't think it's at risk in most of the world but you know you never know
2186.80s: we certainly seen sovereign debt go under before um and so I I use a simple kind of equation to
2196.24s: define what I am seeing and that is um when you add the fragility that the pandemic caused even
2205.20s: notes you know a few years behind us now it still has led to a lot of fragility in the system
2212.88s: we were talking about you know the savings that got built up government aid and all of that that's
2217.28s: being wound down the fact that we had a moratorium on student debt and that's come back those are
2223.60s: all things it's not a smooth ride it's like all of a sudden they get surprised that you know they
2228.88s: weren't counting on having to pay back debt and now they have to again um so there's fragility in
2235.20s: the system a what I call a massive leverage as I say it's 300 and some odd trillion in debt across
2245.92s: the globe now and then plus what I call a huge central bank policy era era you know it's
2260.00s: it's a fed policy era but it's also happening in the ECB and Bank of Canada you know
2268.64s: um Australia um I'm sure China's you know making their problem you know their economy is evaporating
2278.88s: so so you're seeing what I think is overtightening because central banks are saying we're going to
2285.28s: tighten until we see the results of our tightening by then because of lags that are typically six to
2291.68s: nine months or maybe even a year you end up by definition being many many months too late and
2298.00s: recognizing that you went too far when you finally realize it and that's what I think when I was
2303.60s: talking early in our interview about maybe hitting a brick wall that it may be not I'm not saying
2310.16s: December or even January but it may be within a few months that um we find out that you know the
2318.96s: Fed finds out that they did go way too far you know things happen start happening fast we're starting to
2325.04s: see signs that they the banking systems you know lending is dropping fast you know the bank loans
2335.12s: you're seeing that drop you're seeing you know the the reverse repo um that's come down a lot that's
2344.64s: a sign I think of the banks wanting that liquidity so there's something going on out there that
2350.80s: suggests that we're we're getting close to an inflection point uh between uh economy seemingly
2357.76s: was okay and people are talking about soft landing and maybe two or three months from now we're
2362.40s: gonna be talking about a hard landing and uh ultimately a very hard thing so is you're referencing
2368.96s: the leverage and then liquidity are are you hinting at some sort of credit contraction here that
2374.88s: then leads to a rapid acceleration of the bust ultimately I think that that comes about I mean
2384.72s: you know think of 2008-09 it will happen differently this time but that's basically you know
2390.64s: that's what happened it became a domino effect um I don't know whether it's mid-year next year or
2398.88s: sooner but that's kind of what I'd say is likely the time frame for you know some some time second
2406.00s: quarter let's say um and might be late second quarter might be earlier but um where I think you could
2413.68s: start seeing the results of central banks having way overtaken and so yes you could have bank failures
2425.52s: um certainly credit spreads widening none of that is showing up yet by the way I mean the
2432.16s: credit spreads are narrow so that's why I don't want people jumping on this and saying well it could
2438.24s: be next week or could be next month we're not you know we'll get some some war I'm picking on things
2446.24s: you know seeing things that are kind of precursors to the precursors so you know there's still time
2451.68s: before that happens and that's why you can have a meltdown but there are dangerous signs out there
2458.48s: that are suggesting um that we're we're moving in that direction and that ultimately what I mean by
2464.96s: a global bust is a as I say 2008-09 we came close to a global bust it was when GE was rumored to be
2477.28s: unable to access the commercial paper market and they were so dependent on the commercial paper
2483.28s: market that there were rumors that they weren't going to make it you know this was when you know
2487.60s: city bank was selling you the uh a couple bucks and you know the the money center banks were all in
2493.04s: trouble and then all of a sudden GE looks like they may go under and it's one of our blue chips and
2498.48s: if if the fed and the government had not acted very quickly to assure the
2505.92s: commercial paper market state open and liquid um we could have seen the bust then so a bust will be
2514.64s: going that next step beyond 2008-09 where where I think the financial system can go into freefall
2521.60s: and like I said I'm not so worried about us banks were better you know there's kind of party
2527.36s: risks you can never say that it can't happen even though they're better capitalized this time if
2533.44s: if the European banks start going under they couldn't take ours and you know we can have real
2538.08s: trouble too so you know I think more of the risks are overseas this time in the banking system
2545.12s: but we we saw in March there's plenty of vulnerability in the regional banks
2550.64s: and we also saw how fast banks can become ill-wit with right I mean the money starts flowing out
2558.64s: of those regional banks as people get nervous and all of a sudden those banks go under or or you
2566.40s: several we started seeing a domino effect there so so I I do think that we could see a free falling
2573.28s: financial system which is why I continue to say this will be the worst financial crisis
2580.96s: and certainly post-World War II era I'm meeting worse in 2008-09 and could be the worst in history
2587.52s: because of the size of it if you were to steal man your argument and to think of an alternate scenario
2598.32s: on how this could play out differently what would that look like well I could be wrong in terms of
2607.60s: the magnitude of I mean I do think we're going beyond a soft landing but I could be wrong that it
2613.36s: gets to a point of an extreme hard landing and we start seeing this you know financial crisis overseas
2620.08s: that then spills over into the whole globe it might not get that bad and therefore it might not
2630.48s: require the kind of central bank response I'm talking about for the other side but I you know
2638.96s: I'm pretty pretty comfortable with my forecast I think you know the likelihood is it's going to be
2645.68s: a harder landing than 2008-09 right yeah the reason why like exploring that side is just to see
2653.68s: what alternate path what alternate trajectory things could go so I think thinking through especially
2661.20s: something quite so parabolic is just an interesting thought exercise for me you mentioned a little
2666.80s: bit earlier about the financial system and what I was picking up was just financial stress right on
2674.80s: the entire system across the board is this the kind of thing that you think literally can break
2680.56s: the existing financial system and if so what happens in that scenario yeah here I say I differ from
2689.92s: you know the the peterships of the world out there who will basically are saying we're going to
2694.72s: see a you know break of the system I think or or those in the Austrian school that think we're
2700.80s: getting you know this kind of cleansing of the system you know it really breaks and then you start
2706.88s: over with a much better system I differ from believing that this is that break because the central
2716.56s: banks you know this busted I'm calling for is going to be deflationary bust because we're you
2722.64s: know we're heading towards 2% inflation now if you get the break I think you're going to get in the
2726.88s: global economy you know quickly go into deflation if you go into deflation that gives central banks
2733.92s: around the world almost infinite ability of print money because the lag to when that deflation
2740.80s: then turns into or that money turns into inflation again will be a couple of years you know if you're
2746.08s: in deflation you're not going to be back in inflation or high inflation a year later you know it's
2751.20s: going to be a couple of years so that means they're going to be focused on saving the system right
2756.32s: if it's right in front of them you you've got two things you're looking at one is right in front of
2762.40s: me is an economy that's collapsing a financial system is collapsing but I know that if I print too
2769.44s: much money a couple of years from now there's a risk that that might cause inflation what do you
2775.04s: think they're going to be focused on they're going to be focused on the collapsing system so that
2780.24s: means they will print as much money as they have to destabilize the system my argument is it took
2787.12s: five trillion to do it back in 2020 I think this is magnitudes of that so I think we're looking at a
2795.20s: 20 trillion expansion of the Fed balance sheet this time that's four times that and you know something
2802.32s: proportional to that around the world so it's it's that massive printing of money or pumping of
2810.88s: liquidity into the system that will stop the free fall but it doesn't happen immediately you know
2817.36s: and they're not going to go right from you know they're not going to say okay let's throw 20
2822.56s: trillion in there because I know that's what we need they're at this point they'd say that's
2827.76s: never going to happen you're never going to see you're not even going to see five trillion again in
2831.68s: fact they're telling us they don't want to do QE ever again you know or or ever see that kind of
2837.44s: thing again so that's part of the reason why we're going to have a bust is because they're so
2842.08s: reluctant to repeat the mistake of 2020 it get right and frankly the mistake of the last 20 years
2849.76s: of being the Fed put so if they really believe that their you know their job is to get the
2857.60s: balance sheet back to normal and normal being pre-2020 they they actually and I've seen them say
2865.44s: this they actually believe they can get the balance sheet back to you know three or four trillion
2871.12s: from nine that they could take that five trillion back that's a real problem I mean because
2877.84s: there's no way that can happen you know they're down to trillion or a little more now and they're
2884.08s: already I think they're going too far so so but not to jump around but I do think that the the
2893.44s: magnitude of the free fall means they'll start reluctantly playing in you know trillion to trillion
2901.20s: whatever and it will do nothing to stop anything so they pour in a few more trillion it does nothing
2907.44s: to stop anything or maybe stop something for a week or two and then trouble comes again
2913.12s: ultimately this thing just you know if you have the global financial system in clothing
2920.56s: it takes a lot to stop that and they're not going to know what a lot is until after the fact I
2928.32s: mean they're only going to know with a lag to what they do and they're going to just keep pumping money
2934.16s: every time they see more crisis coming at them so so it's going to you know it's going to play out
2939.52s: over many months not over a few weeks but there'll be chunks of money coming in week by week month by
2947.68s: month ultimately when you look back I mean I was the total seed of the pants guess but I'm guessing
2955.76s: you'll see something close to a 30 trillion dollar fed balance sheet and that that 30 trillion
2963.28s: dollar fed balance sheet or the additional 20 trillion will probably be pretty close to matched
2970.56s: by the amount of new debt coming out of the government meaning they're going to come up with every
2976.56s: new program they can to stimulate things you know okay pension funds are failing we're going to
2982.40s: we're going to put through another bill you know we need four trillion dollars to support the pension fund
2990.32s: and problem so that you know nobody loses out on their pension you know we're going to the endowments
2998.48s: are failing well we don't want that that means you know we're going to see all these colleges fail
3002.72s: we're going to we're going to support the endowments you know you're going to see money coming out
3007.52s: of everywhere I mean coming out of the government for everywhere and you know there's probably going
3013.28s: to be universal income there's probably going to be all kinds of programs that I think are going
3020.24s: to only exacerbate the problem down the road you know you're going to create another problem
3026.56s: but while you're in the midst of this crisis they're not going to they're not going to stop I mean
3032.00s: they're not going to they're not going to think long term at all they're going to be only thinking
3036.56s: about how do we get ourselves out of this crisis how do you have your thought
3044.32s: yeah well that's why I think we go from I mean it sounds crazy and I keep saying we're at the end
3050.48s: living 80 or 90 years super cycle you know between two depressions and that's why we can go from
3058.08s: you know what what I think is a melt-up this year to an 80% down next year to an inflation cycle
3065.68s: like we've never seen before where we see 25% inflation rates by the end of the decade
3071.12s: and then it collapses the system in the 2030s because you know you're dealing with
3077.12s: everything in in terms of what's right before you without any thought
3084.72s: to what you're creating beyond that so you know by the time you realize you've over tightened here
3092.16s: you create the opposite problem where you can have to over ease then you create this huge and
3097.28s: because of leverage it's you know it's not over it's not overusing by a little bit it's overusing by
3103.60s: tens of trillions by the time you realize that that created an inflation problem you're well into
3110.64s: an overheating that you can't stop and then what you do and you know obviously we'll have to
3116.16s: service our debt which I don't know how you do that when rates are roaring away so you're you're
3123.28s: getting into that place where the elastic band gets stretched and then it's like a bungee cord
3129.20s: it gets stretched and stretched the other way and you know the waves get much bigger.
3135.44s: Yeah well one of the things I am hopeful for is that when we're going through this process of
3141.60s: you know passing a lot of these different bills and whatnot to potentially try to keep the lights on
3147.04s: maybe we could finally get the daylight savings bill through as well so that it doesn't keep
3152.56s: getting fucking 430 that would be okay that would ease the pain a little bit.
3157.52s: Yeah I don't understand you know who gets her backup over something like that you'd think
3164.48s: that that would be one thing that you could get both parties and all sides to agree on and you know
3170.40s: even that they can't solve. That was the joke I ran for a while I said you know we're in trouble
3176.32s: when like you can't even you can't even unify behind something that everybody universally hates.
3182.32s: Yep. So before we wrap up you talked a little bit about some of the commodities right so we
3189.04s: talked about some gold we didn't talk too much about metals so how do metals behave during this cycle?
3197.20s: Yeah I'm glad you asked because I think I think metals are just coming alive.
3202.64s: It's been a long wait they had a great run and you know from the March lows in 2020 to
3209.84s: August highs particularly silver but silver and gold both they went sideways to down and
3217.68s: probably more down than sideways from August 2020 to just a little while ago and we are coming out
3226.56s: of that now gold gold performed better than silver so gold you know not very far off it's all time
3233.84s: highs and I think you're going to be there probably this year you know I think could be there in
3240.48s: a couple weeks but whereas silver has got a longer way to go I mean you know the the old
3247.52s: high I think was up there 50 or 48 some are up there I think silver can get 60 but there's
3253.28s: going to be a longer slog or you know a steeper slog to get there so but you can see you had
3261.28s: that that so off I presume that trough for this 2020 is that where we are. Yeah so this is
3269.68s: you know this is actually a year ago so let me zoom out a little bit more to get closer to
3272.88s: thesis yeah so on this one 2021 is back here if you want 2020 we can go five years so here's
3280.16s: 2020 back here yeah so you see you had that quick sell off in March 2020 then you had the big run-up
3286.88s: and and then you can see it's been basically a sideways down consolidation pattern you know when
3292.32s: you're in it and because I've heard this from plenty of people on Twitter when you're in it it
3296.56s: feels like it's been got off of you know it's all it's been is just straight down but if you look
3302.16s: at it from a five-year chart it's a consolidation you know it's just a long square root pattern or
3308.88s: you know cup and handle whatever you want to call it and we're going to come out of that long
3314.96s: almost four-year consolidation three and a half-year consolidation we're going to come out of that
3319.84s: vertically and head I think to 60 and maybe even to 75 before the bust so that means you know
3327.36s: I'm basically thinking and I can be off by months many months but I'm thinking there's a decent
3334.72s: chance that we come out of this and see silver at six somewhere between 60 and 75 by the middle of the
3342.72s: year and same thing gold I think you bust out above 2100 you know 2070 wherever the 2080 wherever
3353.36s: the high was you're almost there you bust above that and you're going to have run to 3000 very quickly
3359.52s: so again within the next six six seven months and and then you correct in the bust with most assets
3368.88s: I'm not sure if you correct back to here silver probably does correct back
3373.76s: a longer you know it's going to be a it's a more cyclical metal so it will get harder gold might
3379.44s: hold up a little better because of its safety features or it's you know in a crisis some people might
3385.68s: run to it but I still think it probably goes from 3000 back towards 2000 and then once you get
3393.60s: you know well into the bust and and these assets start anxious paying the next cycle I think gold
3399.84s: goes to 20,000 silver goes to 500 you know you're going to have a big run so there's a big run
3407.60s: directly ahead then a then a big correction and then a huge run in you know between let's say 2025
3416.96s: and 2030 so I think the metals you can see what they did you know if you take a long chart and look
3425.60s: back they had great runs in the first part of this decade the first part of the century you know
3431.36s: 2001 to 2011 was a huge run 2016 was a big run what I see here looks a lot like
3441.04s: 2016 and particularly in the in the miners looks a lot like 2016 and 2020 those runs so
3448.88s: you know you've got some very fast vertical runs I think coming they got to work through particularly
3455.20s: the miners have to work through a lot of overhead resistance so it's hard to tell exactly when
3462.16s: they'll run and when they'll correct you know in a stair step fashion but I think we're going to find
3467.92s: as people start warming up to them this is a pretty thin group you know there's not a lot of
3473.20s: liquidity in those stocks so that once once some of the institutions starts seeing the momentum
3480.16s: and decide they want to allocate to gold silver in the miners I think you could see very thin
3487.44s: markets you know where where you get a lot of price moving in a hurry in terms other metals I'm
3494.24s: bullish copper I think copper is probably going to get up to six dollars pre-bust that's pretty
3501.52s: big run since we're in the you know three seven-year area I think or maybe lower and and I think the
3510.40s: you know copper producers are going to do pretty well in that period too so and you know other metals
3518.72s: steel to me looks like a big performer I did mention them before when I was talking you know
3524.64s: industries it'll do well but I think steel industry which has been flat out it's back for many years
3530.00s: looks to me to have great potential in in the melt-up so you know you could get pretty big move there
3539.84s: iron ore obviously would be similar some of the other industrial metals I think can play so
3546.48s: that may seem counterintuitive because I'm talking about an economy is going into recession
3551.84s: I think what happens in this melt-up is people will choose to first of all they're not going to see
3558.72s: the hard landing that I'm caught for they're going to be seeing soft landing and I think they're going
3564.48s: to be willing to look over the trough because the Fed has done tightening and if the Fed actually
3569.36s: eases they're definitely going to look over the trough I think so I know I should this is kind of a
3576.72s: caveat I know there's a lot of people that have seen the chart that says when the Fed starts cutting
3585.04s: that's when the stock market does worse right so and I've said I'm not even calling for cuts now
3592.64s: the cuts could come in the bust and that I'm just saying pause means end of tightening and that
3598.16s: will be received initially very bullishly but I just caution people from buying too much into a
3608.32s: narrative that is driven by you know some chart that says every time the Fed cuts rates that's
3615.04s: the top in the stock market you know I just don't I don't think it's going to work like clockwork
3619.76s: necessarily I do and obviously I do have a bearish view it's just not before we have this run
3627.04s: right well and as you've pointed out before right things change and as new information comes out
3633.60s: things do change and it's always interesting to see how you piece all of these different moving
3639.36s: things together into your thesis I am very curious to see how the boom in bust thesis kind of plays
3647.36s: out because it definitely has been a long time coming I know from you and I when we first started
3651.52s: talking you'd been envisioning this for some time so here and you talk about the melt up being
3657.36s: underway is really intriguing to me so I'm excited to to see how it all plays out for me as a
3663.20s: trader my life is simple I trade very short-term time frames so whatever happens couldn't care less
3668.40s: my job is to capture small improvements but I get to enjoy the ride which is pretty cool but
3672.72s: sure yep I mean you've shared a ton of awesome information thank you so much for taking some time
3679.20s: to hang out I really enjoyed doing these with you so looking forward to catching up with you again
3683.84s: but before we sign off as per always working people get a hold of you I'm sure I'm on Twitter so
3689.52s: it's Dave H. Contrarian or at Dave H. Contrarian I'm on there most days doing battle with everybody
3699.04s: it's a little easier these days because the markets go into my favor but as you well know I've
3704.80s: I've had plenty of critics along the way so it's it's the plight of a contrarian if you're in
3710.96s: particularly one that's an extreme contrarian as I am that you know people are going to think
3717.36s: you're nuts because you are the only one saying something you know but but as as the market moves
3722.96s: in my direction people come my way it doesn't look quite so crazy so so I'm there enjoying myself
3731.28s: and and I also write a investment letter that comes out quarterly if it's by subscription meaning
3740.08s: there's a fee to it if people are interested in it they can direct message me on Twitter and I
3748.08s: will provide details awesome and I'll make sure I throw a link to that in the notes below as well
3753.20s: so that they could easily find you but until we have a chance to connect next time David thanks
3757.92s: for hanging out for a bit yeah great see you Eric we probably won't talk to each other before
