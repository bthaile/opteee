0.00s: What's up to all the outliers, Eric here,
2.68s: and I legitimately have a great video for you
5.20s: on managing deep in the money short puts.
8.60s: This is what I do.
10.12s: This is my bread and butter,
11.60s: and it is really the more interesting part of trading to me.
15.24s: Obviously, it's nice to put on a trade
16.96s: and for it to make money, no drama there,
19.16s: but this is where trading really happens,
23.04s: not just one more directionally right, right out of the gate.
25.28s: So let's take a look at the trade.
27.44s: I'm gonna show you a chart for some context first,
29.84s: and then I will give you the details of the trade itself.
32.52s: This is where I entered the trade.
34.68s: This is IWM.
35.96s: This is part of my core portfolio.
39.40s: I bring that up because there's very different ways
41.60s: that I approach my core portfolio
43.28s: compared to my speculative portfolio.
45.60s: It's the same portfolio, it's just different allocations.
48.80s: And in this case, I am trading the covered strangle.
52.56s: Now, when I look at this first trade that we got on,
55.96s: IWM was trading around to 10,
58.20s: and then this is where the first role occurred
61.72s: on the 28th of April, and then here we are down here.
66.04s: From here to here, to about 175, 176 is about a 16% move.
72.16s: So we've sustained a meaningful move against us in the position.
75.64s: Directionally, we have been incorrect completely.
79.40s: Now, as I look at this from a technical standpoint,
82.20s: I definitely perceive more risk to the downside
86.20s: than upside potential.
87.88s: That's an important undertone as I make further decisions
91.80s: about how I want to manage this trade.
94.12s: I also see a couple levels of interest to me,
97.24s: like this 189, this 182, as potential resistance.
102.84s: We're still still stepping down with lower highs,
107.20s: which is not good.
108.72s: Overall, I perceive more downside than upside.
112.28s: I say all of that because it will paint the rest of the picture
115.68s: of the portfolio and the strategy that we're deploying.
120.08s: Now, as I said, we're looking at IWM.
122.24s: The plan is the coverage strangle, a favorite of mine.
125.60s: When I look at the series of trades,
128.16s: I'm gonna walk through my thought process
130.32s: because I haven't made a decision yet,
132.80s: and that's part of the reason I'm doing this video.
135.04s: Today is 19th of May, and I haven't made a choice yet,
139.00s: but it's coming up on time to do something
141.44s: because X-Transic value is dwindling down very quickly.
145.12s: So that first trade on 29 March,
147.40s: I sold to open six of the 202 puts at 338.
151.20s: The reason why I arrive at six, or eight, or 15, or 25,
156.68s: it's all based on how I wanna use my portfolio,
159.72s: what I want my utilization to be,
161.24s: how much money I'm trying to make,
162.92s: how much risk do I have out in my speculative portfolio allocation
167.36s: compared to my core, all of those things mix into it.
171.04s: The general undertone here is conservative.
174.72s: I have been no more than 20% invested
177.32s: across my entire portfolio so far this year,
180.32s: and it's because I do not trust the markets.
182.88s: This is one of the primary ways that I manage risk
186.76s: is via sizing and what I offer to the market in my allocations.
192.76s: So that is the general background
195.08s: behind the size of the trade.
196.80s: Now, if you're interested in how I approach my coverage
200.20s: of my struggles in general, how I analyze,
203.00s: how I manage them via different adjustments,
206.00s: all that stuff, I will link to a video up here for you
208.48s: to check out, because I'm not gonna go that far
210.52s: into detail on those things.
212.08s: This is gonna be more of a practical managing a trade
214.48s: that's on right now by how I tend to do things broadly.
219.44s: Okay, so moving on to the first roll on the 28th of April,
224.60s: when IWO is trading around 189.
226.52s: So that represents about an 11% down move
229.68s: and where I entered to my first roll.
231.92s: And I bought to close those 202 puts at 1260,
236.48s: and then I sold to open six of the 17 June 200 puts
240.16s: at 1330.
241.48s: Now, a couple of things happens here, happened here.
244.08s: The first one is I was able to reduce my basis slightly
248.52s: from 202 to 200, so that's a 1% reduction in my basis.
254.80s: I also kept the size the same.
257.00s: So what I mean by that is I kept a six lot to a six lot.
260.80s: One of my favorite ways to manage these kind of trades,
263.92s: especially in a down move is to slowly scale
266.80s: into the trade towards my full allocation,
269.28s: which technically is up to 100% of my portfolios,
272.76s: what I would allow for this style of trade.
276.16s: We're not quite there, because I have other positions on,
278.16s: and I'm not looking to scale in quite that aggressively,
280.48s: but just to give you some general context.
283.24s: So what's happened thus far is I collected
286.52s: $3.38 in some credit, then I realized a loss
290.68s: when I bought to close them, and then I opened up a new trade
294.36s: with 1330 and overall credit.
296.72s: So I have a total unrealized, realized net PNL of 2448.
302.32s: This includes the trade that's open right now.
304.56s: The realized PNL is down $5,532.
309.36s: That's what I realized in loss on this trade right here.
313.64s: Now, the return on capital invested capital
317.68s: for the trade as it sets with the net PNL
320.16s: is 2.04% and annualized, it's at 14.6%.
324.72s: I bring that up because on an annual return,
326.72s: this still isn't bad.
327.68s: I'm not worried about this trade,
329.20s: and this again continues to shape and inform
331.64s: how I choose to manage the position.
333.72s: So this is the main set of choices I have ahead of me.
338.08s: Do I want to try to roll out in down or just roll out?
342.96s: Do I want to take shares in and actually turn it
345.44s: into the covered strangle by taking assignment
348.32s: and then selling covered calls,
349.80s: or do I want to add risk, meaning increase total size
354.60s: so that I can make more aggressive adjustment on these puts?
359.80s: Now, I will give you the cliff notes version.
362.76s: I am not interested in just rolling out.
366.72s: That doesn't benefit me too much, and I'll show you why.
370.68s: If I pull up the current options chain,
373.52s: and we take a look at where my deep in the money puts are,
377.92s: which is they're an 80 delta right now,
380.52s: they have about 13 cents, 12.5 cents of extrinsic value.
385.24s: So once it gets below a dime,
387.28s: it is time to do something because early assignment
389.68s: becomes increasingly more probable,
392.20s: even though there's 22 days left to go.
394.36s: It's unlikely if it's right around a dime,
396.80s: but I don't want to deal with it
398.12s: if it starts trading for four cents, five cents,
400.76s: and there's just not that much money left to pull out of it.
404.08s: So in this instance, I'm going to look and say,
406.80s: okay, the midpoint on this theoretical value,
410.84s: somewhere 2377, sorry, 2387, something like that.
418.04s: And I'm going to look to see what I could get
420.84s: if I rolled out in time.
421.84s: So first, I'll take a look at going
423.68s: to these 42 days to expiration, same strike.
427.20s: Those are trading for 24, 20, something like that.
431.00s: And that doesn't give me a lot of money on that role
434.72s: in terms of the credit that I would ultimately receive.
437.76s: So that I'm not super interested in.
440.52s: The next choice would be to take assignment
442.76s: and then sell covered calls.
444.16s: So let's see what I could sell at my basis around 200
448.28s: if I go out those same 42 days.
450.16s: I wouldn't want to sell it right at 200.
451.72s: I want to go a little bit further out of the money
453.48s: to enable upside potential.
456.40s: It's a way that I compensate for the cost to carry.
460.08s: And those are only giving me 40 something cents.
463.24s: I'm not super stoked on that either.
465.80s: So I'm narrowing down based on what I'm seeing
468.64s: in the market by these decisions.
471.00s: I'm not stoked about rolling out, just rolling out.
474.00s: I'm not stoked about taking on shares
476.56s: and selling covered calls.
478.24s: So that leads me to out and down or increasing size.
481.88s: If I can roll out and down, I would.
484.48s: But if I take a look at these 42 days of expiration,
487.72s: the 200 puts, I cannot collect enough credit
492.12s: in order to have a net credit on the roll.
495.04s: Again, I would only be able to get 2420 something like that.
498.84s: If that's at the 200, if I go to the 199s to roll it down
503.16s: by one point, then I'm only getting 2330 something like that.
509.52s: Which again, is not enough.
511.56s: 2330 is not enough to give me a net credit on this.
515.68s: So that leads to a couple other choices.
519.44s: I could look, maybe go a little further out in time.
522.32s: Maybe I go to these 15 July, 57 days to expiration.
527.00s: And then I check out those 199s.
529.12s: These are going for, it looks like 2369,
537.12s: right around there, 2369.
539.88s: And then again, if I pop back, see where we're at,
543.40s: 2369 simply is not enough.
546.24s: And that's even if I go out 50 something days.
549.12s: So then just to see where I would have to go
551.84s: in order to get a credit and be able to roll down,
554.28s: I could go 92 days out.
556.32s: I could look at these 199s or I could even look at these 198s.
559.56s: So it's a viable choice if I wanted to go 92 days out.
562.84s: Not super inclined to do that right now.
565.32s: If I look at this list,
566.76s: what I would be most inclined to do is increase size.
570.60s: I wouldn't completely discount rolling out
574.12s: after I look at the choices available to me.
576.16s: Again, I didn't look at this before I did the video with you guys.
579.00s: So I was looking at it as I went.
580.96s: I'm not stoked on out,
582.52s: but I am right now favoring increasing size.
586.60s: Because as I look at some size choices,
589.88s: I could potentially add maybe two contracts.
593.64s: Still keep it very, very small,
595.16s: take it from a six to an eight lot.
597.20s: My overall allocation would be very small.
599.72s: But what that would allow me to do is probably go from these 200s
603.44s: down to these 195s.
605.40s: And that starts to become more meaningful.
608.00s: Because again, if we do tip and continue this bear market,
611.88s: I'm gearing up for a near 300 day duration down move.
616.56s: So by continuing to slide into the trade via size,
621.44s: but reducing my basis as such,
624.12s: it gives me the most flexibility
625.80s: for when I ultimately do decide to take assignment,
629.20s: I will take assignment on a size that I'm comfortable with,
632.28s: and be able to sell short calls at something
636.60s: that makes a little more sense.
637.64s: Because again, if I go to these 57 days out,
640.44s: let's take a look at these 195s.
642.00s: I'm now collecting $1.60.
644.24s: That's pretty healthy for something
646.24s: that's 57 days out at a 195.
648.56s: This is a low delta, it's an 18 delta.
651.00s: So I could even again, go a little further above that
653.64s: to give me some upside potential
655.40s: and still collect a meaningful amount of credit
657.64s: that it starts to be worthwhile
659.00s: or even sell the covered calls at a ratio,
661.92s: which is a favorite of mine.
663.44s: So if let's say I take this to an eight lot
667.20s: and I end up getting assigned 800 shares at 195,
670.68s: let's just say everything, setters, parabets,
672.56s: everything else is the same.
674.04s: And we're looking at it right now in that same scenario.
676.96s: I could then sell six of these 198 calls
680.92s: that still gives me $3, $3 upside potential.
683.64s: I'm still collecting 600 something bucks
686.08s: for 15 delta short calls,
688.28s: but I'm still not capping the upside.
689.92s: I have 200 on cap shares.
691.56s: One of my favorite approaches.
692.76s: So right now, as I write this, make this video,
696.68s: that is what I'm leaning towards.
698.36s: Probably increasing size very, very slightly
701.96s: and increasing the overall allocation into the trade
704.64s: so that I can take in a bigger credit,
706.84s: move five points down,
708.72s: which decreases my overall risk footprint
711.60s: because the total to cash secure will decrease.
714.56s: And then it gives me a little more room
716.76s: to continue scaling in if the market doesn't accommodate me,
720.04s: which I honestly don't think it will at this point,
722.80s: but I am comfortable starting to scale into this trade
726.04s: a little bit because I have plenty of capital.
728.96s: I could put into this if I need to.
730.68s: So that's what I'm thinking right now.
732.48s: Again, just making a video as I'm thinking
734.68s: about managing this trade.
736.52s: If you have any questions, let me know.
738.08s: It's fun conversation.
739.24s: I haven't made a decision yet.
740.72s: I will do an update video when I make the trade probably
743.28s: tomorrow the next day, next day being Monday,
747.04s: depending on where those puts move.
748.96s: But I'm definitely going to wait for them to go below a dime
751.76s: just so that I can squeak out as much time as possible
755.40s: to get a better feel for what the market's actually doing.
759.48s: Are we starting to see a little bit?
762.12s: Maybe if we start seeing some support here,
764.88s: oh, those are fibs.
765.72s: Sorry, I didn't mean to put those in there.
767.52s: If we start seeing a little bit of support
769.76s: at these levels, I might feel a little bit differently
772.84s: as in if we're starting to base somewhere in here at 175.
777.44s: And then we start trading between a range here
779.96s: and maybe bouncing up out of there.
781.36s: That would be great.
782.44s: And if that happened, I would be even more comfortable
785.08s: scaling in.
785.92s: So what I'm doing is I'm trying to pull every last ounce
789.92s: of extrinsic value out of this trade
791.80s: to give me more time to analyze where this thing might be
795.08s: going in my opinion and then make a decision
797.44s: based on how the rest of the portfolio looks as well.
799.72s: So again, if you have any questions,
801.52s: anything you want to talk about,
802.48s: let me know happy to discuss it.
804.24s: If you enjoy this kind of content,
805.80s: make sure you subscribe like the video
807.16s: so that we can merge from the YouTube algorithm
809.88s: and grow our outlier community.
812.28s: The hive mind is very strong,
814.08s: and I'm looking forward to growing this skill set
816.48s: with everybody.
817.48s: So until next time, enjoy the markets.
819.92s: There's lots to do out there and don't lose your shirt.
823.64s: It's not worth it.
825.48s: You know, liar.
826.56s: Catch you guys later.
