0.00s: Here we have the case of a trader who posts it on the R option subreddit, which I love
6.12s: hanging out on because it's super fun. And they were asking about iron condors and what's
11.12s: going on here? Well, there's two big callouts for this person. The first thing is the market
17.28s: is perpetually showing them that it will move and you have absolutely got to have a plan
24.52s: for what you're doing and clearly they don't. They're kind of trying to build the plan
28.32s: as they're flying it, which never works well in trading. More importantly, you can see
33.72s: that they completely misunderstood that the strategy they were trading. So they had a trade
39.40s: here and it says they bought calls expired worthless and sold in bought puts that they
43.68s: would lose the difference between those. But all of a sudden they got assigned. So what
48.28s: happened here? Well, obviously they can identify why they were assigned, but they didn't
56.80s: understand that it's a potential. So always keep in mind, if you have a short option, even
62.24s: if it has other legs as part of the trade that you put on that short option is treated
66.24s: as a standalone option in the market's eyes. And if a counterparty to that option, short option
71.92s: chooses the exercise and you might be randomly paired with them. So you have to be prepared
76.96s: even if the rest of your portfolio makes sure that the risk is tolerable, meaning you still
81.60s: have the spreads on. It doesn't change the risk profile as long as the other options are
86.08s: there. But you might get a scary email like this. That's completely avoidable, but it's
90.64s: also navigable if you know it's going on. You know, let's see it.
