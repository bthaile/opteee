0.00s: Cut the tails off in your trading.
2.40s: What the hell does that mean?
3.60s: I'm going to walk you through it.
4.72s: I'm also going to explain why you care
7.36s: because it can help you make more money trading.
10.08s: And at the end of the video,
10.80s: I'm going to walk you through the exact process I follow
13.68s: to identify and manage tails in my trading.
17.68s: What's up, everybody?
18.56s: Eric here.
19.04s: Welcome back to all the outliers.
20.72s: Shout out to the Patreon family.
22.08s: Consider signing up.
23.44s: We've got weekly workshops,
24.72s: all sorts of cool things in there.
27.20s: And without further ado, let's get started.
29.36s: Here we have a $68,000 account.
34.00s: And the title of this Reddit post,
36.40s: I know that probably shocks you
37.60s: that this is where this is from.
38.72s: And it says, incoming $50,000 loss.
42.56s: Send my favorite part here.
44.08s: It says, I know.
45.76s: I'm stupid for doing this.
48.72s: Yes, you are.
49.76s: Never thought in video would move like it just did.
53.92s: Guess what?
54.72s: This person just figured out what a tail is.
56.88s: When we talk about tails,
59.04s: it is synonymous with extreme data points in a data set.
64.16s: You think about it.
65.44s: My branding for my YouTube channel
67.92s: and my community be an outlier.
70.80s: That is a tail.
72.56s: An outlier is a part of a data set,
75.84s: but it's a tail.
77.36s: In this case, we think a positive skew tail.
80.56s: A good tail.
81.44s: In trading, we typically want to look
84.08s: at the tails that hurt us.
86.64s: So let's get a better sense of what that actually is.
90.56s: If we take a look at this strategy,
92.48s: this is a zero DTE SPX 15 Delta Strangle.
96.48s: I run tons of these.
98.32s: Don't worry about all the details.
99.76s: Just know in this example,
101.44s: I'm referring to something that has no stop,
103.60s: has no wings.
104.56s: This is just placed as is.
106.72s: And this is running from 2018 to 2024.
109.36s: This returned $1,210 at a 0.2% compound annual growth rate.
115.44s: This is why we care about the tails.
119.76s: Because if I apply a stop loss to this strategy,
125.04s: everything else is the same.
126.48s: It returns $55,152 at a 7.6% compound annual growth rate.
132.96s: This is why we care about the tails.
135.76s: It can help you make a lot of money.
137.20s: Now, it's really important to know.
138.88s: This is a delicate process.
140.48s: Because as we go through this,
141.92s: you're going to notice a few things
143.44s: that are worth calling out.
145.28s: So to help us understand that,
146.72s: let's take a look at what tails are.
150.00s: If you look at this distribution,
152.32s: notice these little purple dots
154.16s: pretend that that is the profit and loss for your trades.
157.84s: So as we look across this standard distribution,
161.20s: know that you don't have to have a standard distribution.
164.24s: It could be leptocardic, mesocardic,
166.16s: it doesn't matter.
166.88s: It could have all different kinds of skew.
168.72s: The point being though,
170.08s: that at some point in the data set,
173.04s: you're going to notice this right here,
175.12s: mu, which is the mean.
176.48s: This is the average of the data.
178.32s: So that's where the bulk of the data falls around.
180.96s: And if you look at the negative one
183.04s: in plus one standard deviation, that's sigma,
185.68s: you'll see that 68.3% of data falls
190.72s: within negative one and positive one standard deviations.
195.04s: Interesting thing is you go down to two standard deviations.
199.36s: This is 95.5% of data.
202.24s: And then 99.7% of data at three standard deviations.
206.08s: So as you go further out in your standard deviations,
209.52s: it becomes more and more inclusive of your data set.
212.56s: Notice that there's both positive
215.52s: and negative deviation.
217.76s: So in the case of this being PNL for a trade,
220.56s: this means these are your losing trades,
222.32s: these are your winning trades.
223.60s: We want to have as many winning trades.
225.12s: And if we have some big winning trades over here,
226.96s: that's great.
227.60s: You have to keep all things in context though.
230.16s: If you have a bunch of outliers in your winning trades,
233.68s: you have to take a close look at what's going on there.
236.00s: But an easier place for us to start
238.16s: is looking at the losing side of the equation.
241.44s: So what does this look like in a practical sense?
243.92s: Well, if we take a look at those first two strategies
246.40s: that I shared with you,
247.60s: the short strangle without a stop and then with a stop.
251.28s: Without a stop, notice the average profit was 3.11.
255.12s: Average loss was negative 11.91 max profit 1340 max loss was negative
261.92s: 7,287 dollars.
264.24s: After I applied the stop,
266.56s: take a look at what happened to the average profit.
268.56s: It went from 3.11 down to 307.
272.32s: The average loss went down to 6.70.
276.24s: The max profit remained the same, no impact to that.
279.12s: And then the max loss went down to negative 3345.
284.00s: So we improved both the average loss and the max loss
287.76s: by about 50%.
289.60s: And then we took a minor hit to the average profit,
293.12s: no impact to the max profit.
295.44s: This is how we can approach cutting tails off of our strategies.
300.24s: This is why this strategy returned so much better.
302.80s: Because when I looked at this and you see the average loss is 1,200 bucks,
307.76s: the max was 7,300 bucks.
309.44s: That's a big difference.
311.68s: Notice the difference between these from 6.70 to 3,300 bucks.
317.60s: Still big difference, but not as big.
319.76s: This is massive.
321.12s: So this is why we care about tails.
324.16s: This is what they look like in a data set.
326.48s: So now let's talk about how we go about getting rid of them.
330.64s: When you start this process,
332.56s: you have to be aware of something called overfitting data.
336.56s: I'm not going to go into statistics 101.
339.60s: Just note that when we're looking at back-tested data,
343.60s: it's looking at previous information.
345.52s: We have to be aware that whatever we do to previous information
349.44s: as we receive new data points, it's going to look different.
352.16s: So if you optimize a strategy so that it looks perfect
356.16s: in a back-tested sample, going forward, it's not going to look anything like that.
360.56s: That strategy is not going to be robust
362.96s: because you have overfit your data to a specific sample
367.12s: that is continually changing.
368.80s: So we're looking for things that are more robust.
371.36s: The other thing to keep in mind is as you go through this process,
374.56s: it's not as simple as just cut the tails off.
377.12s: Because if you notice as we cut those tails off,
379.52s: it impacts the rest of the expectancy of the trade.
382.88s: So we'll get into what that means in just a minute.
384.96s: So the first thing is start with a large data set.
387.52s: The more data, the better.
388.48s: Ideally, you have a trade log.
389.84s: And if you are in the Patreon, you have access to a free sample
393.60s: of one to get you started.
394.96s: The reason why we want a large data set, though,
397.52s: is because it gives you a wide lens to start with.
401.36s: So what I like to do in this example is you can see
405.04s: these are all different permutations for zero DTE strategies.
408.32s: And this top one you'll notice the max profit and loss.
411.60s: There's no application.
413.68s: I'm not touching it.
414.80s: I'm putting the trade on and letting it go to expiration.
417.20s: Notice the max loss in this scenario was 8251.
420.32s: Then you'll notice I started applying max loss protocols.
424.80s: Then I apply max profit protocols.
427.12s: Then I combined the two protocols.
428.88s: What I'm doing in the beginning is I'm looking for extremes.
432.80s: And then I'm trying to apply different rules that help me control the extremes
438.40s: while monitoring the impact to expected return.
441.52s: So here's what that means.
443.04s: If I take a look at this strategy and I apply a 200% max loss,
449.20s: meaning 200% of the credit received,
451.68s: that takes my max loss from 8250 down to 3 grand.
456.72s: That is a great change.
458.56s: Now, if I look at the average win,
460.40s: prior to the adjustment, it's 378.
463.04s: And after the adjustment, it goes down ever so slightly.
467.20s: So I don't actually care.
469.28s: That means I haven't made a big impact there.
471.76s: Now, notice how the number of winners changes.
475.84s: The number of winners with no management is 642.
478.88s: The number of winners in this case is 584.
482.16s: So what's happened?
482.96s: We have less winning trades here.
484.80s: What's going on in this scenario is because we have a stop
489.04s: when this strategy goes out, there are periods
492.32s: that the trade profit and loss goes outside of your stop.
497.28s: You get stopped out.
498.80s: So it's no longer a potential winning trade.
500.88s: That's a losing trade in this case.
502.48s: But sometimes it comes back in and becomes a winner.
506.16s: So if you do not apply a delicate balance here,
510.24s: you can have things that get stopped out.
512.32s: And then as it comes back in, you would have made money.
515.28s: The other thing you can do is try adding legs
517.52s: to strategies like this.
518.72s: This is just a concept I'm sharing.
520.56s: The problem with adding legs is multiple fold.
522.72s: Not going to go into detail.
523.68s: This isn't about this explicit strategy.
526.00s: This is specifically about the idea of cutting tails off.
529.36s: But if you want to talk more about that,
530.72s: let me know.
531.60s: And I can make a video on it for you guys.
533.52s: So after this, we figure out what rules we think we can apply.
537.20s: So in this case, I see a big loss.
539.12s: I want to figure out how to get this loss down
540.88s: without affecting the profit too much.
542.56s: So I start by applying stops.
544.40s: I start by applying buying legs.
547.04s: Because if you buy legs, that seems really great.
549.20s: Because then you don't have this instance
551.28s: where something goes out of sample and comes back in.
553.44s: Seems great.
554.08s: But unfortunately, it doesn't work that great.
556.24s: So after you apply it to the broad data set,
560.08s: then you need to apply it to segmented data.
563.44s: So what that means is if you remember in the original example,
565.68s: we looked at 2018 to 2024, that entire period,
569.76s: then what I'm going to do is split that period up
572.64s: typically in half, test those two periods.
575.68s: So the first half of that range, and then second half,
579.52s: and then I'm going to split it up into each year.
582.40s: By doing this, I'm making sure that the strategy holds up
586.00s: in different market conditions and isn't just being smooth
590.08s: because of a long runway.
591.60s: It's really important to segment your data in this way
595.36s: to make sure that you have stuff that falls in sample
597.84s: and out of sample.
598.80s: Again, I'm not going to go into statistics 101.
601.60s: It's good practice.
602.56s: Just know that.
603.52s: Then you can apply it to projected data.
605.76s: You could throw it into a money carload simulation
607.84s: to get new prices for future occurrences, lots of deviations,
611.84s: and see how it holds up.
613.20s: Then from there, start testing in a small amount of money,
617.04s: paper trading live, stuff like that,
619.12s: put real money behind it, see how it does,
621.04s: and continually optimize it.
622.88s: Because markets change, if you apply one structure here,
627.12s: that doesn't mean it's going to work forever.
628.88s: This is a big reason why in the past year,
630.80s: I was trading a lot of short strangles
633.68s: versus my typical go-to for a long time before
636.00s: that was short straddles.
637.28s: And it's because markets change.
638.48s: You have to stay sensitive to how things are doing.
640.72s: So in a nutshell, the way we cut tails off our trading
643.60s: is we review data.
644.88s: We segment the data out after we apply different rules
648.56s: that we think might work.
649.92s: And we observe the impact to our expected return.
653.20s: If you're unfamiliar with what that is,
654.80s: I'll throw a video in the notes below.
656.40s: This is simply how things perform in aggregate looking
659.60s: at win probability, average win,
662.00s: loss probability, average loss.
664.00s: That gives you a really solid idea
665.68s: on how you can project something like this forward,
667.84s: using sample data.
669.28s: And to decrease the unnecessary losing positions that you have,
675.28s: and to decrease the drag you experience on your portfolio.
678.56s: If you have any questions, let me know.
679.92s: Be an outlier.
681.12s: You guys later.
