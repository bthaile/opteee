0.68s: what's up outliers today we're going to
2.88s: talk about the weather how nice the week
6.00s: was the fet I'm obviously kidding we're
8.44s: going to talk about GameStop today
10.36s: because things have gotten a little
13.88s: spicy and uh I love this I literally
17.32s: love this every time that it looks like
19.28s: GameStop starts slowing down being a
21.32s: little bit sleepy all of a sudden you
24.08s: get a day like this and as you could
25.56s: tell it just makes me
27.76s: smile and we have to give a shout out to
31.44s: my boy jimbles from the Discord who
33.80s: obviously dug this piece of gold up from
37.08s: uh one of the the reddits and I mean
41.84s: it's beautiful isn't it it's exactly
44.92s: exactly what's going on here so this
47.40s: move was really interesting really
51.04s: interesting and there are a few reasons
55.12s: why now let's start with what's been
57.36s: going on very quiet across the board
60.44s: right volume quiet running below
63.08s: averages overall quiet then today we run
67.76s: into
69.28s: 61.8 million volume where the 5-day
73.48s: average is 18 mil and the 20-day average
77.12s: is 13 mil so we got active we got real
81.52s: real active and there's a lot of
83.72s: conjecture as to what's going on because
85.60s: there's the at the market going on and
88.80s: we don't know if where we're at in that
91.92s: process we haven't really seen any
93.80s: information so that could be part of
96.24s: what we're seeing here but let's start
99.80s: with the dark pools and then we will
103.52s: slowly slowly move in because I also
105.76s: want to show you the options side of
108.56s: things because again there's an
111.84s: interesting series of events going on so
116.68s: let's grab GameStop and then we're just
119.96s: going to look at
121.40s: today and then let's sort this not by
124.64s: time but let's sort it by
127.64s: premium and you can see that we have
131.48s: some absolutely massive positions coming
134.60s: on today there was 4.6 million shares
138.16s: traded to kind of kick us off in the
140.32s: morning the overall premium there was
142.72s: $92 million and then we go 19 mil 16 mil
147.64s: and you can see a lot of this is
148.80s: throughout the day but notice a lot of
150.52s: this starts kicking on in the afternoon
152.32s: this is Pacific Time by the way that's
154.40s: why um you'll see like 1301
157.64s: 1358 this is pretty much Market close
160.76s: which is very common to be clear like
162.48s: you'll very often see bigger orders
164.96s: towards market closed it's for liquidity
166.84s: reasons this is very very normal but if
168.92s: we take a look at the kind of Trades
171.60s: that came through we see a lot of
173.12s: average price trades which is really
176.72s: really interesting because notice what
179.68s: the the word picture here it says a
181.20s: trade where the price reported is based
182.84s: upon an average of the prices for the
185.04s: transactions in a security during all or
187.92s: any portion of the trading day and it's
189.60s: because these are bigger positions like
191.08s: you're not going to put on you know a
193.36s: $4.6 million position and just have it
197.20s: magically slide through it's just not
199.40s: how it works so there were a ton a ton
204.20s: of really big trades going on now a
206.16s: quick reminder there's a difference
208.56s: between orders that go through through
210.00s: dark pools versus lit exchanges versus
212.84s: orders that are internalized orders that
215.76s: go through dark pools still hit the
219.16s: Consolidated tape they're not
221.72s: internalized inherently now you can have
224.84s: internalized dark pool orders but then
227.08s: you you you wouldn't see them because
228.72s: they're internalized they don't hit any
230.52s: tape so these will still hit the
232.80s: Consolidated tape which is exactly why
235.12s: we see the volume going absolutely
238.12s: Bonkers as we look at this through like
240.84s: a time scale because again this is going
243.12s: to track the cumulative volume as we
245.24s: move around right so you see 34 million
247.56s: 56 like it starts scaling meaningfully
250.36s: right into um right into the end of the
253.04s: day so fascinating fascinating price
256.64s: movement here now this is what I'm also
259.32s: very excited about is if look at
262.36s: this we have some pretty big trades
265.32s: coming on and they're not out into
268.08s: perpetuity right this is looking at at
269.84s: 18 o
271.32s: 2024 and this is a almost a half a
274.32s: million dollar in options somebody came
276.80s: in they grabbed the 21 calls they
280.08s: grabbed 2,000 of them and that is a not
284.68s: insignificant size trade and then we can
286.72s: see essentially an hour directly before
289.92s: that there was also something for the
291.96s: same expiration the 18 ox and we can see
295.40s: that it's a
296.84s: $250,000 trade so we're starting to see
300.24s: some bigger trades in the front
302.36s: expirations all three of these largest
304.80s: trades options trades on the day are all
307.80s: in the front expiration
310.16s: 18 18
313.20s: O So now let's take a look at the
315.56s: options chain then and see what's going
317.80s: on here first let's take a look at
320.12s: volume and you can see that big volume
323.68s: day big volume day so we have 56,000
327.28s: calls traded against 107,000
330.16s: puts and the majority of the calls were
332.92s: at the offer or above meaning we've
335.08s: bought them and then the majority of the
336.68s: puts were actually at the bit or below
338.60s: meaning we've sold them very bullish
340.56s: configuration across the board now when
343.92s: I look across the volume I can see a lot
346.68s: of concentration in 20 SE 27 sep this
349.20s: makes a ton of sense I'm sure there are
350.68s: tons of people who are very very happy
353.68s: that they were able to get a few dollars
355.84s: out of their calls that were expiring
357.88s: today otherwise and and essentially save
361.12s: some of their position right because
363.08s: that's essentially most of these were
364.72s: going to expire worthless until we see a
366.64s: 12% up move on the day then a lot of
369.64s: these calls got pushed a little bit in
371.64s: the money it's not a matter of whether
373.00s: or not they're in the money it's just if
374.36s: you know underly goes up which it did so
376.84s: it saves them so love to see that rather
380.80s: than pouring one out for all the the
382.56s: homies we lost which we still lost some
384.92s: not a ton but we get to pour one out for
387.32s: the homies that made a few bucks today
388.92s: which is even better in my opinion then
392.12s: if we take a look at open interest this
394.52s: is getting even more interesting so the
396.68s: put oi is not changing that much it's
398.84s: still low 3 30 uh 313 right now call oi
402.88s: is changing a lot and notice how big
405.56s: this 18 OCT expiration is becoming take
408.40s: a look at all these Yellow Boxes
409.88s: cropping up those are big positions
412.80s: being built out in this expiration so we
416.48s: have some interesting things to look at
418.80s: here because notice V has popped
421.28s: massively these were all below 80 just
424.76s: yesterday and the day before now they're
426.24s: creeping up over 100 on overall all and
430.40s: then we can see that the options chain
432.12s: is starting to get built out so right at
434.88s: the monies we have 5800 here 4,000 then
438.16s: we have
439.08s: 19,000 oi here with another 9600 traded
442.96s: today we have 19,000 out here the 30s so
446.84s: this starts to look really interesting
448.96s: now as far as where we go from here
451.44s: that's a great question because it's a
453.44s: little bit early to tell but this
455.92s: obviously is the exact kind of stuff
458.48s: that I look for so this popped up on a
460.20s: few of my scans primarily on a volume
462.80s: perspective with the volume exceeding
465.00s: the 5 day and 20-day average intraday it
467.88s: tells me that when that Vol when that
470.28s: hits intraday that we're going to run
472.12s: past it right because when we're looking
473.84s: at the 5-day average the 20-day average
475.52s: that's looking back over the entire
477.52s: trading day for 5 days or 20 days so if
480.12s: you exceed the entire day average before
483.04s: the day is out it's fairly telling that
485.76s: volume is picking up meaningfully so now
489.32s: we get to see does this volume continue
491.20s: forward but what I can tell you is that
493.92s: there was tons of shares traded today
496.48s: and I can also tell you that the options
498.52s: Market is also starting to get involved
501.68s: which again I'm very eager to see how
504.40s: this goes so we'll keep an eye on it as
507.08s: usual we do have the gme live stream
509.80s: tomorrow at 5:00 P p.m. Pacific time
511.20s: we're going to continue going through
513.28s: all of roaring Kitty old trade so this
516.08s: would be part three I don't know how
517.80s: many parts there are going to be I
518.96s: actually thought we might get through
520.04s: them through it all in one video
522.12s: obviously that was completely wrong but
525.16s: I'm happy it's wrong because I'm really
526.48s: enjoying looking at this stuff in detail
528.04s: with you all so tomorrow at 5: uh
530.28s: Pacific time we're going to be going
531.48s: through and we're getting to the point
533.40s: where he's starting to unwind some of
535.68s: his trades and there's some really
537.64s: interesting behaviors that I'm picking
539.20s: up from him one being that he's clearly
542.12s: not unwinding positions based on a
544.28s: profit Target it's actually right now
546.48s: looks like it's based on time in the
548.60s: trade good old tit so I want to see if
552.48s: that holds up and I'm most eager to see
555.48s: if I can detect a change in his approach
558.08s: because I have a pretty good fingerprint
559.72s: for the way that he's using options
561.08s: right now and I'm so eager to see if
564.80s: there's a material shift in what he does
567.32s: cuz right now I think we're in like
568.60s: early 202 oneish so we're we're getting
571.64s: to where things start getting very
573.24s: interesting so that's the game plan for
575.24s: tomorrow and then later today we have
577.60s: outlier options trading for beginners
579.92s: you can come hang out we're going to go
581.52s: over three common beginner mistakes in
584.36s: how to avoid them and then General open
586.88s: Q&A so we're out here we're active we're
589.72s: busy as always if there's anything you
591.40s: need or want me to take a look at let me
593.04s: know you can shoot me an email drop it
594.52s: in a comment whatever makes you happy
596.20s: makes me happy be an outlier see you'all
598.32s: later
