2.28s: what's up outliers welcome back to
3.96s: another episode of the outlier podcast
5.80s: we have Richard back to talk to us about
9.04s: really just all the things that are
10.88s: psychologically wrong with me it's
12.24s: always fun because I walk away
14.68s: understanding that I have a lot of
15.76s: problems but it's great to see you again
17.68s: oh it's so good to be here and be back
19.92s: our conversations are always so
22.48s: interesting because you are so upfront
25.20s: you're available and we're dealing with
27.56s: issues that all us human beings face
30.64s: rather than just superficial crap yeah
33.64s: exactly that's the way I look at it and
35.12s: I mean what what better test subject
37.76s: than somebody like me because there's
39.84s: nothing nothing not to look at so um
43.04s: right before we launched the podcast we
45.28s: talked actually really quick about kind
46.88s: of the the main things I wanted to cover
48.48s: today so just to recap those quickly and
50.56s: you actually you have a better version
52.00s: than I do maybe you give us the agenda
54.08s: for today because yours sounded way
55.40s: better than mine did well you said let's
57.44s: do something easy that'll change lives
60.32s: let's do some find something hidden
62.84s: that'll improve Traders lives and then
65.80s: let's create a
67.64s: framework for analysis that will improve
70.68s: Traders life so that was the three
72.80s: things I got and I thought gez you're
75.20s: sure making it
76.76s: easy I mean I tell you what you make it
79.80s: easier than chat GPT because all of
82.44s: those topics that I said were way less
85.20s: impactful than your versions but yeah
88.08s: that's kind of it so I a after a few of
91.56s: our conversations a lot of things come
93.68s: into my mind about the world of
95.60s: psychology with respect to trading and
97.48s: one of the things that I try to remind
98.84s: traders of frequently is trading is it
102.20s: that it's part of the gift and the curse
103.92s: is that it's it's just you you are the
107.04s: researcher you are the trader you are
109.60s: the risk manager you have a lot of hats
112.36s: that you have to wear and I think a lot
115.16s: of us jump straight into the technical
118.44s: aspects of trading that we kind of
120.16s: forget some of these underpinning
121.64s: Concepts so I thought it would be really
124.88s: useful to start with some of those
127.12s: broader topics kind of specifically
128.96s: those first two that you outlined so
131.00s: well and then later I would love to talk
134.24s: a little bit more about this process of
136.32s: like selfassessment because I find it
139.40s: something I spent a lot of time actually
141.32s: trying to do is understand myself better
143.04s: my decision-making and one of the things
145.16s: I noticed from where I started trading
147.52s: back in 2007 I was a I was a teenager at
150.52s: that point I was a young dude and now
153.32s: I'm 33 so it's like just a lot of my
157.12s: perception of the world has changed even
159.08s: in that time frame and hopefully it will
161.40s: continue to change as I gain more
163.16s: knowledge so I find that the way that I
166.40s: analyze myself has changed a lot and I
169.20s: find that a lot of what I used to do was
172.16s: very
173.12s: superficial and I'm curious if there's
175.84s: ways that we can dive more into that so
178.72s: take us back to the beginning though
180.72s: I thought it would be really useful for
182.92s: us to identify some of the more common
186.56s: pitfalls that exist so that ideally we
189.16s: don't spend a bunch of time in there if
192.12s: possible well this is really interesting
194.60s: because my assistant is
198.28s: accumulating over
200.76s: 2,000 assessments that we've done and
204.68s: the text of people saying what are their
207.20s: issues and we're going to come up with a
209.84s: real list now intuitively I kind of have
211.96s: a sense of it but one of the first
214.40s: categories is is there an easy exercise
216.72s: something that we can do that's a little
218.48s: more superficial and you already started
221.64s: the topic you mentioned Traders have to
224.20s: wear a lot of hats so there's the risk
228.28s: assessment hat there's the strategy
230.52s: development hat and there's the Str and
233.36s: there's the execution hat when I worked
236.12s: for a trading firm those were clearly
238.88s: divided the analysts the
241.16s: researchers the risk people and the
244.60s: executors so what I would get is a
247.76s: Trader on the floor would be prices to
250.48s: buy and sell above and below so I had
254.00s: one function execute just execute well
258.56s: what a wait a minute what this is little
260.80s: no don't worry about risk we've got that
263.80s: manage we've got a whole umbrella of
266.52s: things we're balancing just executed but
269.76s: but no no just execute
272.64s: rich but for the independent
276.16s: Trader you have a dream you work on a
281.28s: strategy sometimes a lot of times you
283.72s: don't even deal with the risk because
285.44s: somehow that is not
287.24s: comfortable but even if you do that's a
289.60s: separate hat and then you have the
291.12s: execution so what I work with my Traders
294.40s: is literally I wish I had a is to have
297.04s: three baseball caps you know like green
299.96s: blue red the red is the risk
303.16s: management uh the blue is the
306.28s: execution uh the green is the strategy
308.84s: development for example so you only do
312.00s: one function at a time once you've got
314.72s: your strategy development done you've
317.16s: done your risk management now it's time
320.88s: just execute execute and that is so hard
324.92s: to step into just that because you bring
328.12s: your strategy development your risk
330.28s: management and as a result your
332.84s: execution is just tied up in oh maybe I
335.40s: should wait a little bit you know this
337.00s: doesn't seem quite right so the easy
340.56s: part the first exercise is wear
342.80s: different hats know which hat you're
345.44s: wearing and when you come to execution
348.56s: just
350.32s: execute the interesting part there and I
352.60s: noticed this about your process a little
355.24s: more regularly than than I don't know I
358.40s: would have intuitively thought
360.60s: but I've noticed several times now that
363.64s: you use kind of almost visceral
366.24s: annotations of something right so like
368.40s: to your point like like a physical hat
370.48s: like something something to cause a
373.64s: perceived change of environment scope
376.72s: can you talk a little bit more about
378.08s: that as like a tool that you use
380.52s: sure when a judge steps into the chamber
384.20s: he puts on his robe MH and that says I
388.04s: am stepping out of my
390.08s: personal
391.64s: biases when you go into the military you
394.36s: put on a uniform that says I am here to
397.60s: serve my buddies and my
400.16s: countries when a policeman puts on a
402.56s: uniform a priest puts on their their
405.64s: robes all
407.88s: this is a physical embodiment of me
411.80s: stepping in a role that is higher than
414.68s: myself so if we can recreate that for
417.92s: Traders I think that is really helpful
420.48s: because In the Heat of the
422.68s: Moment to stay in that one embodiment is
426.56s: really challenging because of our
428.20s: emotional
429.28s: nature leads me to another really
432.68s: curious question slight rabid Trail but
435.68s: completely
436.64s: correlated is I've always done a really
440.92s: purposeful thing where I create space
444.24s: like I have an office at my house right
446.60s: so like when I'm in my office there's
448.72s: certain things that happen in the office
450.96s: that don't happen in other spaces in the
453.16s: house y one of the things I find
455.44s: interesting with trading though is that
457.56s: so much of it is done
460.04s: here
461.72s: yes that's with me when I leave the
464.44s: office that's with me when I go to the
466.84s: gym so when you think about other ways
470.96s: for Traders at least to be not
473.08s: necessarily make a bunch of changes
474.92s: unnecessarily but at least to be aware
476.80s: of because to me that's as you mentioned
479.24s: that
480.08s: I think about that and I think like oh
481.64s: that's actually kind of interesting
482.76s: because sometimes I'll be sitting in the
484.52s: hot tub and I'll hear an alert go off
487.00s: and then I'll start doing my thing there
490.12s: and that's probably not the same mindset
492.44s: that I would be if I'm in my office with
495.40s: my setup and structure so when you look
497.80s: at it from a retail trading perspective
500.08s: are there other things that you think
502.32s: they should be keeping in mind with
503.76s: respect to things like environment when
506.84s: they choose to do things whether it's
508.52s: like bounding it by time anything like
510.64s: that yeah in fact I have and we may have
514.00s: discussed this my mind metrics program
517.20s: yes and what this is is a structure that
521.20s: sets us up to uh have a good strategy to
525.48s: analyze the strategy to be able to
528.84s: manage risk management to execute and
531.60s: then to see ex very explicitly which of
535.96s: our processes including our mind body uh
539.76s: States we have a a place for that uh our
542.84s: set scores of Sensations emotions and
545.08s: thoughts so that we can really
547.52s: see which of those inputs is making the
551.36s: biggest impact on our
554.16s: success that's awesome that makes a lot
556.28s: of sense too because yeah when I think
559.16s: about the the how easily what we do
562.80s: translates into wherever we are and the
566.20s: way that I think about things is
568.08s: different in different places in
569.56s: different settings so that's it's kind
571.88s: of something I think is worth at least
573.36s: noting for people and I love that idea
576.44s: of the way that you come up with like
577.84s: your set score and making sure that
580.32s: we're tying things together that may
582.16s: otherwise be imperceptible because my
584.20s: guess is if people that are listening to
586.52s: this right now if they took the time to
588.72s: take a look at their last 100 trades and
591.08s: even tie it to a location if it's not in
593.64s: one spot there might be some sort of
595.96s: correlation there coration yep yeah so
598.92s: our
599.88s: our set scores are Sensations our
601.84s: physical Sensations our emotions and the
604.56s: quality of our thoughts and it's amazing
607.96s: that you know it's not a onetoone
610.28s: correlation but we have they as you
613.72s: enter those they get colorcoded so you
616.52s: can see the colors and then you can see
618.96s: your p&l and broadly speaking you can
622.52s: see the waves of how our mindset our
627.68s: emotions our quality our thoughts are
630.80s: correlated with our p&l and once you do
634.16s: that then you can start
636.36s: making choices as an agent that is
639.60s: sitting above those as rather just
642.28s: rather than being reactive inside of
644.88s: them yeah yeah and it's another really
647.80s: interesting thing that I definitely
649.20s: notice that you've introduced me to more
651.76s: so than I generally would do with myself
655.00s: where you talk a lot about kind of um
659.00s: almost like a third party analysis of
661.08s: you like uh outside looking in and can
664.76s: you talk a little bit more about why you
667.00s: think that that's so important in the
669.00s: process of analyzing oneself sure it
671.92s: comes down to a concept of
675.36s: agency so let's say I'm driving down in
679.08s: fact I just had an interview this
680.36s: morning we talked about I'm driving down
682.08s: the road somebody just yeah I see him
684.64s: come up behind me really fast he whips
686.68s: around whips right in front of me in
688.76s: between two cars and I'm going son of a
693.96s: bab I have no
696.64s: agency that aggressive driver is
700.08s: determining my emotional state which
703.44s: goes into my physiology my stomach my
706.24s: acid my heart rate he is I am allowing
711.52s: him it's always a him it's women don't
714.24s: do
715.28s: that I'm allowing him to actually show
719.24s: shorten my
720.92s: life so if on the other hand I say okay
726.80s: what is my job here and in this case my
729.92s: job is like a computer game to get my
732.68s: passengers to the destination safely and
736.76s: comfortably are there going to be
738.88s:  on the road absolutely are
742.48s: going be people yes with self you know
747.16s: texting oh yes are going to people who
749.96s: are just tired or maybe inebriated oh
753.16s: yes so now my job and this is where it's
756.80s: really cool as I see that guy coming up
759.76s: behind me really fast and changing lanes
762.40s: quickly okay I'm going to move over I'm
765.28s: going to move back I'm going to do this
767.96s: I'm going to give him the opportunity to
769.84s: do that and my passengers are not even
772.08s: going to notice I'll do that a dozen
774.96s: times on a long trip where I am playing
778.80s: a computer game and at the end of the
781.56s: game when we arrive safely I go yes I
786.24s: played that game really well I made one
789.36s: mistake here I could have done that
790.88s: better but I'll I'll remember that for
792.88s: next time so did that person determin my
796.76s: emotions no I reframed it so in
800.60s: trading you know you you put in a a buy
804.28s: it automatically it puts in a stop bang
807.28s: it's hit immediately son of a
810.20s: those guys came in and they just ran the
812.00s: stops you know they were just waiting
814.20s: for us son of a and now watch it's
816.28s: going to go up it's gonna turn around a
818.80s:  what
820.93s: [Laughter]
823.52s: a what if
825.80s: again this was the game and I enjoyed
829.60s: playing it and I have agency in other
832.68s: words I continually frame the world in a
836.80s: way that I am in charge of my own
841.80s: responses I think one of the most
844.12s: powerful things about that too is it
848.44s: highlights how
850.48s: important self- understanding and
852.56s: control is you highlight this let's
856.12s: let's Brack at the word control for a
857.88s: minute but keep
859.08s: going um because when I think about and
862.40s: it's funny because especially from a
865.00s: military background where a lot of the
868.00s: things that you talk about
870.32s: really resonate because it's a lot of
872.68s: the ways that we're taught especially as
874.00s: Marine officers where you're going to be
876.92s: the the dude that people are looking at
879.28s: so as soon as we have a plan that we're
880.84s: trying to execute and just like in
882.72s: trading as soon as you try to execute it
885.68s: some always happens literally
887.48s: always without a doubt and you're just
890.44s: you get so primed in something happening
892.84s: that when it happens you're not even
894.80s: like I can't believe this happened
896.76s: you're literally just like I expected
898.72s: something
899.96s: and but you're my job is to handle those
902.96s: things as they happen okay here's a new
905.72s: thing it's going to test me and I'm
909.08s: going to feel so good when I rise to the
911.68s: equation I feel so good that I can
914.32s: handle some chaos I feel so good that I
917.96s: am so have such confidence in myself and
921.76s: the world that When Things Fall Apart I
924.84s: can be the man standing that everyone
927.04s: looks looks to for guidance wow does
930.92s: that feel good so rather than having the
933.32s: chaos or the unexpected go oh
936.08s:  say okay this is a chance for Eric
940.12s: to shine now a follow- on question one
944.24s: of the things we do in the military a
945.88s: lot that I see in some other places
948.60s: where it's like typically more kinetic
950.04s: environments so think like police a uh
952.72s: police officers paramedics is you kind
956.08s: of you use humor a lot and it's is a
959.80s: coping mechanism it's not necessarily
961.64s: because you think XY or Z is actually
963.64s: like that funny but you notice that it
966.28s: it becomes Like A coping mechanism so
967.80s: like in the military a big thing you
969.48s: know you'll hear anybody in the military
970.84s: you'll hear the saying like if it ain't
972.80s: raining we ain't training right it's
974.68s: just the fact that like you know that
975.96s: you're going to be out there for three
977.56s: three weeks and the first day you go out
979.64s: there you're going to get dumped on with
980.88s: rain and you just know it and it's
983.04s: you're going to be wet for the next few
984.32s: days and you're just you just you make a
986.40s: joke about it you're like man well it's
989.60s: at least we're getting some water
990.76s: training in it this you know what I mean
991.84s: like you come up with something now yes
993.92s: humor is a way to develop agency because
997.12s: if you're in the middle of this and
999.28s: you're just a reaction to it God is
1001.84s: raining and
1004.00s: I'm you are just reacting and the event
1007.80s: is determining your experience but humor
1011.16s: means you need to have some agency and
1013.40s: being able to look for at it from a
1015.16s: higher
1016.28s: level fascinating do you you think that
1019.56s: there's a point where if you develop
1022.96s: almost is there a point where you can
1024.72s: develop too much agency I don't know if
1027.08s: that makes sense in this context I think
1028.68s: of it as sometimes I we'll have marines
1033.04s: that they get so used to everything
1036.72s: going wrong and making jokes about
1038.60s: things that they almost don't know how
1041.28s: to flip back the other mode though where
1044.56s: now the other mode being time to execute
1047.24s: it's time to get serious like cut the
1049.24s:  joking we need to go work now
1051.80s: the joking is good it gets us to a
1053.72s: certain spot then we have to flip a
1056.36s: switch and get back at it I don't know
1058.76s: if that translates into the concept of
1061.24s: agency at all or in trading right
1062.84s: because like I can think in trading
1064.12s: where it's like we make the same joke
1066.08s: all the time oh I place the buy order
1068.00s: and as soon as I place I get it stopped
1069.32s: out or whenever I place a trade the
1070.64s: Market's going to make me wrong but part
1072.64s: of me is curious if there comes a point
1074.80s: where you start planting that seed in
1076.80s: your mind subconsciously and then that
1079.16s: actually takes root in a negative way
1081.40s: curious your thoughts on that yeah well
1083.44s: what you're pointing out is another way
1085.20s: to avoid agency in other
1088.16s: words if I just say h just happening
1090.92s: again oh gez stopped out again oh it's
1094.96s: raining again uh who yeah it's like who
1098.08s: cares that in other words the
1100.56s: event is so overwhelming or I I lose my
1104.60s: motivation as versus agency is okay
1108.04s: here's this event
1110.08s: I am capable competent of handling and
1113.60s: staying focused so agency is a real
1117.84s: powerful State as versus when humor can
1121.00s: sink
1122.08s: into I don't give a you know what right
1125.08s: right okay so it sounds like for my
1127.52s: understanding it sounds like agency is
1128.80s: like that balance it's like being able
1130.68s: to strike the difference between you
1132.84s: know whatever your the mechanism is to
1135.20s: maintain awareness but not becoming like
1137.68s: so desensitized like oh I'm stopped out
1139.80s: again who cares none of this matters it
1141.28s: sounds like a real
1143.12s: balance yeah it's I I'm not fond of the
1146.52s: word balance okay but it is a
1149.52s: self-awareness now okay we're human
1152.64s: beings so we're going to have a waves of
1155.88s: highs and lows and emotions and focus
1158.80s: and unfocus times we're aware we're
1161.48s: agent and we're fully agent there's
1163.68s: times when we just want to kick back or
1165.84s: there times when we're overwhelmed but
1168.12s: again what I do is the golden keys as
1170.28s: first as awareness acceptance and agency
1173.92s: and so if we're aware of what state
1176.52s: we're in then we have the ability to
1179.88s: make the changes we
1181.88s: want I see so then dovetailing then off
1186.68s: of kind of the the broader question here
1189.72s: when you're thinking
1191.60s: about a Trader's path like a typical
1194.32s: Trader's
1195.92s: path I don't know how you would split
1198.80s: the lifespan of a Trader I don't know if
1201.32s: you think of it in different stages in
1203.88s: terms of if they're a beginner
1206.48s: experienced but the main question I'm
1209.36s: thinking of with this concept of agency
1212.12s: is like what does agency look like
1215.32s: throughout the lifespan of a Trader like
1217.84s: what does agency look like for a
1219.24s: beginner intermediate advancer however
1221.24s: you would bucket it yeah I have a
1223.56s: PowerPoint slide that's just perfect
1226.48s: starts out with oh my gosh trading I'm
1231.08s: told I can make a lot of money I look at
1233.20s: all those ads that inant wealth fast
1235.56s: easy money and and this is going to fill
1237.76s: my dreams my father will respect me I'll
1240.00s: get laid more often be able to you know
1243.32s: have a mansion and a car and I'll be a
1245.52s: pillar of the community and people will
1248.08s: like me so you have this huge dream
1251.64s: and what this means is this dream is so
1254.68s: Central to what our heart's desire is
1259.40s: that every tick in the market our way
1261.76s: goes yes cars women men whatever your
1267.60s: fancy is every tick against you is oh my
1271.56s: God my life is falling apart because my
1273.64s: dream won't won't be there huge pressure
1276.68s: on it so we move from every trade being
1281.32s: profitable or unprofitable which moves
1283.60s: us emotionally in One Direction or the
1285.60s: other to say okay we need focus on
1290.00s: strategy so then we we we refine
1293.12s: strategies we create them we make them
1295.76s: we we mess with them and finally we have
1299.92s: a strategy that has been back tested and
1303.76s: we're ready to go we take it to
1306.36s: Market and then we have our doubts and
1309.12s: then we're not sure if the indicators
1311.48s: are all there or we think oh this
1314.32s: doesn't oh we we can violate the
1317.36s: strategy and and so then what we do is
1320.92s: our we lose confidence in our strategy
1324.80s: very few of the clients who come to me
1328.04s: are able to e execute a strategy
1331.64s: consistently never mind that they have
1333.68s: confidence in it never mind that they've
1335.68s: tested it never mind that they've done
1338.00s: the MTH so that if they actually
1339.80s: executed it would be very
1342.68s: profitable so then we come to the point
1345.88s: next step is okay we've learned to just
1349.36s: execute this strategy it doesn't matter
1351.36s: if it's going to make money or not our
1353.64s: job is like my job on the floor of the
1355.60s: exchange with my firm was rich just
1358.24s: execute don't question just execute and
1360.36s: they get to that
1362.16s: point oh my God and then something
1365.52s: happens the strategy executing it very
1369.04s: well we're losing
1371.16s: money over a day a week even
1375.64s: longer so the next stage
1379.48s: is the loss of confidence in the
1382.84s: strategy and I've have traders who argue
1386.76s: with me on this so this is a a
1389.40s: contentious point but statement is all
1393.84s: strategies
1396.60s: fail and they have
1398.80s: to in this age of artificial
1402.84s: intelligence of firms who have PhD
1407.28s: quants any strategy that's profitable
1410.60s: for any length of
1413.24s: time uh every uh you know all the
1415.92s: algorithms and all the other Traders are
1417.96s: going to catch on to it and when they
1420.12s: all pile on of course it dissolves
1422.44s: because it strategy doesn't have enough
1425.28s: liquidity for
1427.36s: everybody so if you are then in the
1430.68s: place say okay this strategy Works in
1433.56s: this kind of Market this strategy Works
1436.04s: in this kind of Market in fact in the uh
1438.64s: mind metrics uh application we we test
1443.00s: strategies in different kinds of markets
1445.64s: and then we move to Market moods my job
1448.76s: is to determine what mood the market is
1452.08s: and then once I get now that that's not
1454.04s: trivial by the way that's really hard
1457.04s: but I determine what the market mood is
1459.40s: I know what strategy tests well in it
1462.76s: and that's what I do and I know it's
1464.64s: going to fall apart at some point the
1467.24s: most money that I've ever made as a
1468.92s: Trader on the floors was when there was
1471.68s: a shift in the market what I call the
1474.68s: Market mood mhm and I remember very
1478.12s: distinctly we were in the options floor
1480.60s: putting on the spread was really
1484.12s: profitable because the the implied
1486.80s: volatility between the two legs of the
1489.44s: spread were quite wide so we were
1492.20s: putting it on and we' been doing this
1493.96s: for a week or 10 days and it kept coming
1495.80s: back and put it on P it was just like
1498.44s: this money pump and then all of a sudden
1502.40s: I noticed the firms were coming in the
1504.52s: other
1505.44s: way and I said you know something's
1507.76s: different every all the other market
1509.40s: makers kept putting on the spread I got
1511.64s: out of my spread and I went the other
1513.40s: way I reversed
1515.20s: it and all of a sudden the spread got
1517.72s: wider and wider and all this fir all the
1521.96s: market makers were getting squeezed and
1524.40s: hurting and finally they had to get out
1526.48s: but by that time I had a huge in
1528.64s: inventory being long that spread I let
1531.72s: them all out and made you were happy to
1533.36s: help them out yeah you're just a good
1535.04s: guy hero I'm such a
1538.96s: sweetheart sure I'll take your money
1541.08s: believe what a nice guy I
1543.84s: am but the point is that they did not
1548.64s: shift they did not have a sense of the
1551.40s: shift in the markets so the primary
1554.20s: skill of an independent Trader is to
1556.96s: determine when that market type Pro uh
1561.64s: format whatever you want to call it
1563.28s: Market mood starts to shift but if you
1566.52s: are locked into a system and applying
1569.64s: that system across a large sample size
1573.24s: eventually it's going to come to a point
1574.88s: where it's not going to work as well and
1577.64s: then you you start to redo the system
1580.24s: you start to uh you know just mess with
1582.56s: the the different algorithms and and
1585.88s: you're chasing the market and then it
1587.28s: shifts again so you say okay my system
1590.28s: works really well in fact what I do is I
1593.00s: have my clients describe Market
1595.88s: Heaven oh Market Heaven oh my God if I
1601.80s: have
1602.64s: a a a trending system it always when it
1608.16s: breaks out into a trend it never goes
1610.64s: back it just trends for a long time
1613.08s: reverses a little bit stops me out I get
1616.04s: to Trend the other way oh it's just so
1619.44s: sweet that's Market heaven for my
1621.80s: trending system Market Hell for my
1624.80s: trending system is the Market's in a
1626.92s: Range it breaks
1629.00s: out and then it comes back and then it
1632.92s: breaks out the other way and go a little
1635.44s: further but then it comes back so that
1637.20s: it's increasing the range so I just get
1640.48s: stopped out time and time and time again
1644.16s: so once we understand what Market Heaven
1646.36s: is and what Market hell is is then we
1649.40s: can start to Define it in terms of
1651.36s: volume implied volatility and options uh
1655.00s: in terms of uh
1659.08s: the the length of each bar or the volume
1662.84s: all sorts of criteria we can look at and
1665.40s: we're always looking for Market heaven
1667.88s: and Market
1669.12s: hell I love that so then if you were to
1672.60s: summarize then kind of the the easy
1676.16s: thing a Trader can do to change their
1679.24s: trading life is that what it would
1681.60s: summarize up to well the easy thing was
1684.20s: just knowing if if you're in strategy
1687.64s: mode in uh risk management mode or in uh
1692.44s: execution
1694.36s: mode this is the most
1699.04s: challenging task of an independent
1703.12s: Trader and this is the most difficult
1705.92s: you asked about a framework for analysis
1709.48s: we all avoid that because we focus on
1712.04s: our our
1713.88s: strategies and we focus on our dream and
1717.44s: we're looking for this perfect strategy
1719.76s: when the really hard part is determine
1722.44s: what's the quality of the market and is
1724.76s: it shifting our brains are set up so
1727.36s: that if we get rewarded like pigeons you
1729.48s: can teach them to walk in figure eight
1731.92s: you know just by rewarding them my wife
1734.48s: can get me to do about anything she
1736.28s: wants
1738.16s: by putting incremental rewards there for
1740.52s: me she's very good at that smart uh
1745.80s: yeah so uh we get used to it and like
1749.36s: the Traders on the floor in that example
1751.96s: is once we get used to something like
1754.24s: during the dotc boom a whole bunch of
1756.20s: Traders went to trading floors that have
1758.00s: never traded before and they were given
1760.96s: capital and my God they just made money
1763.32s: made money made money but I have not
1765.40s: talked to one Trader who made money
1768.52s: during the boom that kept it or any big
1772.60s: part of it because they just got
1775.60s: rewarded for doing the behavior and when
1778.16s: it ended they couldn't believe it and
1779.84s: they just kept doing it until it was
1782.56s: gone that makes a lot of sense and I
1784.80s: think one of the the things I use for an
1787.28s: example well there's there's a couple
1789.04s: traders that I use for an example on
1790.80s: this but the idea that the process of
1793.40s: making money is obviously part and
1796.36s: parcel to being a Trader but then
1798.20s: there's the process of keeping money
1800.08s: which even some of the best Traders
1801.68s: we've ever seen struggle to do that
1803.76s: Jesse Livermore is a prime time example
1806.52s: yep yes the equity curve and what I work
1811.16s: on no Trader has ever come to me and
1815.20s: said Rich my biggest concern is being
1818.72s: able to develop wealth and keep wealth
1822.44s: and know that I deserve it and not
1825.24s: sabotage myself not one
1828.64s: no Trader has ever come to me with the
1831.48s: problem and I say well let's work
1834.56s: on your you're being wealthy and the
1837.84s: issues that will create oh no that's not
1840.24s: a problem at all oh no but what happens
1843.08s: is you know there's the impostor
1844.92s: syndrome there's a sense of what if you
1847.80s: were consistently profitable trading you
1851.72s: increase your size
1853.32s: slowly all of a sudden you are in very
1857.20s: rarified
1858.72s: atmosphere your friends who are maybe a
1861.44s: middle class life you're stepping Way
1864.24s: Beyond that your community all the
1866.68s: messages about wealth and success maybe
1869.48s: negative ones from your
1871.44s: upbringing um income taxes bookkeeping
1876.20s: friends coming to you for money you are
1878.52s: stepping into a whole new world of
1883.00s: power and many of my Traders they they
1886.20s: come to me they get to that that
1888.84s: point and the sabotage usually is in a
1892.28s: short period of time sometimes in a day
1894.72s: they'll lose six months worth of work or
1897.60s: two to three days once they start down
1900.60s: the whole their survival mechanism kicks
1904.12s: in they forget everything they've
1906.20s: learned they double up they try to
1908.36s: recoup it and they end up giving it away
1911.76s: but the good news is now we're
1913.32s: comfortably in I am used to struggle as
1916.00s: a Trader the thought of not struggling
1918.68s: as a Trader is I I don't know what
1921.76s: that's
1923.76s: like I'm fascinated by this
1927.64s: because I've been really fortunate in my
1930.80s: trading career so far
1933.96s: and I've never felt the concept of like
1938.12s: self-
1939.32s: sabotage but I assume it's probably
1943.00s: there in some form or fashion based on
1944.84s: the way that you're describing
1946.48s: it well could be that you don't have
1952.24s: the identity issues usually it comes
1955.16s: down to I'm not worthy I could and I
1958.60s: could give you my own example in my life
1962.28s: where and I I don't know I I probably
1964.28s: told a story about how I was traded
1966.76s: three years I traded on my own and made
1969.56s: 200,000 every year and the voice woke me
1972.20s: up in the middle of the night and said
1973.76s: Rich you're not worth 200,000 a year I
1977.48s: got stuck at that level and it's a it's
1979.60s: a 10-minute story and I won't go into it
1982.24s: but I realized I was done with that
1984.40s: internal limitation and it had to do
1987.52s: with my beliefs about my own
1990.00s: capabilities and I had negative beliefs
1993.24s: and so I didn't allow myself to make
1996.36s: more money and that day I went into the
1998.24s: exchange early the doors were still
2000.40s: locked I got to the pit the first Trader
2002.60s: there I stood in the BET best pit and I
2005.56s: had to fight for that spot cuz the guy
2007.44s: that was always in the best spot he was
2010.16s: a tough s SOB
2012.08s: right so I stood my ground there was a
2015.12s: thread of a fine from The Exchange if we
2017.08s: got into a fight the bell went off and I
2019.92s: just went crazy Rich the pit thought
2022.76s: Rich freezen had gotone nuts buy him so
2025.56s: I I I'd scream right now but I don't
2027.48s: want to blow your ears off but you know
2029.96s: I went on to make many times my $200,000
2033.00s: limit but it was just a a mind game
2036.64s: around my
2039.24s: own identity and my worth and Traders do
2044.04s: not
2045.96s: often get to the point where they're
2048.20s: saying am I worthy of this can I live in
2051.60s: this rarified world I mean some of some
2055.12s: of us are so used to struggle that we
2057.88s: don't know what life is like stepping
2059.84s: out of struggle in fact we have survival
2062.08s: mechanisms that
2063.88s: say I know how rich fre rich frezon
2067.76s: knows how to survive this struggle he
2070.56s: struggled this with this since he was a
2072.96s: kid he knows how to survive it so I'm
2075.84s: going to keep this struggle going
2077.44s: because we can survive it but can we
2080.24s: survive something wonderful oh no no we
2083.28s: don't know that so we're going to stay
2085.08s: in the
2086.28s: struggle that's absolutely fascinating
2089.08s: it really is because one of the things I
2091.84s: love talking to you is gaining exposure
2093.92s: to like these other things that honestly
2096.72s: like don't really cross my mind I've
2098.48s: never really thought about like my own
2101.32s: worthiness in that context and it goes
2104.40s: back to something I I've always
2106.24s: postulated about myself where it's like
2108.80s: I'm smart enough to know how to do
2110.92s: things but I'm dumb enough to not spend
2113.80s: enough time thinking about how I'm not
2115.76s: that smart so it's like this it's this
2118.20s: little circle where I'm like the the
2120.00s: thought of assessing whether or not I'm
2122.16s: worthy literally it never even comes
2124.64s: comes up well that's wonderful it's well
2127.12s: maybe it's not maybe it's because I'm
2128.60s: too dumb to think about it but yeah I I
2131.84s: think it's a really interesting point
2133.52s: though because at least I think for
2136.48s: people like me that grow up
2138.56s: poor the the ability to like work really
2142.52s: hard and then see an outcome I guess for
2144.92s: me that in innately makes it feel
2147.12s: somewhat like it's um like worthy right
2150.28s: like put in effort have
2152.56s: outcome but I can see for other people
2156.12s: different reasons why they might not
2157.76s: feel worthy but I'm really curious from
2159.64s: your research and from your work what
2161.96s: are the most common reasons why somebody
2163.88s: might not feel worthy themselves yeah so
2167.52s: what I do is I do a guided visualization
2170.52s: okay deep breathing
2172.88s: relax um in fact we could do a really
2176.76s: this is usually an hour or two hours but
2178.80s: we could do an abbreviated version so if
2180.68s: you understand this is like on five
2183.08s: times speed okay create a the perfect
2187.60s: Trader's house a successful Trader's
2189.76s: house is it by the ocean in the
2191.36s: mountains by a stream is it a log cabin
2194.76s: is it modern design so I have them
2196.80s: design the house lot of glass okay
2200.24s: you're standing on the road on the
2202.64s: driveway looking at the house this is
2205.40s: where a successful Trader lives so then
2208.28s: I have them start to approach the house
2210.92s: well how is your breathing how's your
2213.36s: muscle
2214.36s: tension how as you walk toward this
2217.32s: person perfect house for a Trader what
2219.40s: do you notice what thoughts are you
2221.12s: having so then we go all the way up to
2223.68s: the porch put our hand on the door
2226.36s: handle what kind of handle is it what do
2229.32s: you feel right now okay so I want you to
2232.36s: look back and in the driveway is started
2236.00s: is everyone who's ever impacted your
2239.28s: life you are about to step into a
2243.16s: successful Trader's
2245.76s: house who is objecting
2249.48s: in my dad is objecting let's go back
2253.48s: let's talk to your
2255.48s: dad I grew up in the
2258.32s: depression we had to work hard and to
2261.72s: make money easily is just wrong do you
2264.24s: know I work three jobs to put your dad
2267.76s: and your I'm your grandpa you know to
2269.80s: put your dad and your kids through we
2272.04s: had eight kids and here you are just
2274.64s: thinking that you can just step into
2276.44s: this easy life
2279.56s: whoa now here's a message that is
2282.32s: embedded in the past and I'm
2284.24s: exaggerating this a bit of course so
2287.08s: okay so let's then we have conversations
2289.04s: with dad with Grandpa or Dad or Mom or
2292.84s: uncles or brothers or whoever it is that
2296.52s: has
2298.04s: concern and it almost always comes down
2301.04s: to they want the best for you MH and
2305.12s: they are sad that they had to work so
2308.08s: hard work their fingers to the bone in
2312.36s: order to provide just the
2314.80s: essentials and eventually we can come to
2317.12s: the place where they can accept you step
2320.40s: into the house then we go up to the
2321.72s: house again we look back again we open
2325.08s: the door what are the physiology you're
2328.44s: experiencing as you open the door what's
2330.12s: your breathing your muscle tension we go
2332.36s: to the trader room describe the trader
2334.72s: room sit
2336.44s: down do you deserve to be here sometimes
2340.24s: the answer is no this isn't me I don't
2342.60s: deserve this then we go back and work on
2345.28s: that so we we keep doing that until the
2348.68s: person says their
2350.88s: identity their beliefs and their
2353.84s: behaviors are all in Rapport and they
2357.96s: deserve to be there now when they go to
2360.48s: trading what we do is we anchor that
2362.92s: house we visualize it create a picture
2365.44s: of it so that now that feeling of
2368.92s: Rapport
2370.48s: and the unification of their physiology
2374.00s: their emotions their thoughts all the
2376.44s: history so that they can now step into
2379.92s: that
2381.36s: state intentionally as an agent in their
2384.48s: own life as versus having all these old
2387.16s: conflicts and voices uh fighting them
2390.32s: all the way so that they end up
2392.44s: sabotaging themselves so they can go
2394.92s: back and end that stress
2398.00s: interesting so then when you work with
2401.12s: people that tend to have this feeling of
2404.28s: um like a like a variance in worthiness
2407.72s: compared to where they are do you think
2410.08s: that it often comes
2412.84s: from
2414.64s: self-imposed perceptions that don't
2417.68s: actually reflect reality necessarily so
2420.32s: to your point if you know we have the
2423.16s: conversation with Grandpa in our mind
2425.72s: and it goes like that but then in
2427.00s: reality Grandpa actually doesn't
2429.24s: necessarily feel that way like really
2430.84s: wants you to be you just gave away the
2433.60s: secret yes okay when we have those
2436.20s: conversations it turns out that he loved
2438.56s: you and he wants you to do well but that
2441.40s: we just picked up his anger around
2445.48s: working so hard trying to provide for
2447.52s: the family the taxes come the rent was
2450.56s: raised just anger around all those
2454.04s: things and are
2458.56s: what what we're not infantile but our
2460.80s: youngest self absorbs all these and
2464.92s: reinterprets that message in a way that
2468.24s: doesn't serve us oh my gosh there were
2470.72s: times that I misunderstood some things
2472.84s: my dad said you know totally I just
2475.28s: misheard the words and it created an
2478.52s: image in my mind that I carried forward
2481.20s: for a long time I see so that's a great
2483.76s: observation thank you Eric yeah
2485.92s: interesting
2487.56s: um so to Pivot then to kind of like this
2490.28s: idea of a a less apparent thing for
2493.92s: somebody to think about to transform
2496.56s: their trading lives what's something
2499.32s: that you come across fairly regularly
2502.32s: but a Trader might not consider for
2505.68s: themselves that they would want to know
2508.40s: about change be aware of as it pertains
2512.20s: to their ability to be a successful
2513.92s: Trader yeah I think that we we already
2517.36s: looked at the most deepest thing and
2519.80s: that is our identity our beliefs and our
2523.00s: behaviors and the foundation of who we
2525.16s: are and are we deserving and that's the
2528.16s: hidden framework that most traitors it
2531.04s: doesn't even occur to them to go that
2533.52s: there but without that positive
2536.04s: foundation without that rapport with all
2538.24s: parts of ourselves weend end up
2540.76s: sabotaging the
2542.52s: typical Equity curve of a Trader who
2546.12s: comes to me let's is Bo
2550.48s: Bo boom bo bo bo bo boom and and that at
2557.84s: that top of that Peak there uh you know
2560.88s: what's going on and
2564.00s: sometimes
2566.64s: it's the impostor S I mean sometimes
2569.68s: it's just so powerful to realize how
2571.92s: your life will change if you can do that
2574.40s: consistently and just keep increasing
2576.28s: size
2577.72s: oh my gosh and we do a lot of
2580.92s: visualizations like okay you have uh $10
2584.48s: million in the bank now what what house
2588.48s: do you live in what who what friends do
2590.44s: you have oh my friends are just s trying
2593.32s: to suck off of me or uh my friends don't
2597.28s: you know they just not comfortable uh or
2600.20s: I don't tell anybody and I just keep it
2602.36s: private so we we look at stepping into
2606.48s: that success
2607.68s: place and imagining it and visualizing
2610.44s: and getting a visceral feeling for it
2613.24s: because until you can viscerally step
2616.72s: into
2617.84s: success parts of ourselves will not let
2621.00s: us go there because we don't know the
2623.00s: risk so my job is to give them a
2625.72s: visceral experience of success check
2628.72s: just like we look back in the driveway
2630.76s: check all the things that are resistant
2632.92s: to that so that they can have rapport
2635.68s: with that experience
2638.88s: when you think about this process of
2640.88s: creating like these Vis visceral
2644.24s: responses or perceptions of something or
2647.36s: this self-analysis
2648.84s: what are your thoughts
2651.12s: on inviting the world of excess
2655.24s: analysis and creating a cycle where
2659.40s: everything becomes so analyzed that it
2662.36s: kind of locks somebody up
2669.72s: yeah for me the model that works for me
2673.32s: recently is life is a wave in other
2676.80s: words there's all sorts of Parts when
2678.92s: I'm building a strategy it's excess
2682.48s: analysis all the way I'm aware I'm in
2685.76s: analysis I'm aware that I am thinking
2688.60s: details whatever okay I go out of that
2691.84s: and I go into a different part of the
2693.32s: wave so the important part is I think
2696.52s: what you implying is if we get locked
2698.80s: into that excessive analysis that top
2700.96s: part of the wave well that means that
2704.04s: we're cutting out our intuitive creative
2708.40s: abilities uh we're cutting out the
2710.60s: ability to execute Faithfully maybe so
2713.96s: for me uh like having The Three Hats if
2717.76s: I think of Life as a wave okay and I can
2720.92s: intentionally I'm going into analysis
2723.44s: right now and I'm going to spend the
2725.04s: next two days or three days just in
2727.60s: analysis
2729.12s: um when I was had a floor trading
2734.72s: firm the uh part of it was cftc SEC the
2740.52s: the Pacific Stock Exchange uh the tax
2744.52s: authorities
2746.44s: uh tremendous amount of paperwork you
2748.96s: know piles like this and as a
2753.16s: Trader no way I could even look at them
2756.04s: so I had to end up going in on a Sunday
2759.20s: and I'd Pace back and forth and look at
2761.56s: that paperwork and Pace back and forth
2763.96s: finally I'd say okay I am going into
2767.32s: operational details and then I'd pick up
2770.04s: one piece of paper handle it give it to
2773.68s: the right person to follow through or
2775.24s: whatever it needed and then I could do
2778.32s: that so I can step into that operational
2781.72s: phase I can step into analysis phase I
2784.72s: can step into creativity stage and the
2787.64s: important part is as an agent in my life
2790.40s: what part do I want to be in and how do
2793.12s: I trigger that so if I can do that be
2797.20s: aware of what part I'm in and eventually
2799.48s: great create the agency to determine
2802.48s: what part I want to be in that is
2806.48s: heaven I see so we have around 10
2810.52s: minutes and I want to continue that
2813.92s: thread specifically on this idea of like
2815.84s: self-analysis
2817.92s: because one of the things I find that's
2820.60s: so different and again maybe this is
2822.20s: just because I'm I'm generally a lay
2825.12s: person that just kind of starts doing
2827.16s: things is that I go through a layer of
2830.52s: analysis typically on something and then
2833.32s: if I feel like it's good good enough I'm
2836.92s: cool executing it and then moving on and
2839.68s: I think a lot of that also just stems
2841.28s: from the military because we we want an
2843.64s: 80% solution now executed violently
2847.60s: over a 100% solution later yeah oh man
2852.52s: when when I think about the world of
2854.36s: Traders now and the wealth of
2857.12s: information I could just see the
2859.40s: propensity even from a self analysis
2862.36s: perspective like when we're thinking
2864.12s: about ourselves our worthiness if
2867.00s: there's misalignment between our values
2870.28s: I could just see that also becoming
2872.64s: gridlock and kind of
2874.80s: circuitous so when you think about
2877.36s: somebody that's going through this
2879.16s: self-analysis process to like better
2881.68s: understand themselves their psychology
2884.00s: decision-making are there any methods
2887.44s: that they can employ so that as they're
2890.44s: analyzing something they're coming to an
2893.00s: output that then they're satisfied with
2895.24s: that output perceivably and then can
2897.60s: move to the next output versus cycling
2900.56s: on the same thing well I certainly
2903.76s: understand what you're saying something
2905.28s: executed right now 80% immediately
2908.92s: violently learn adjust execute uh and
2913.96s: that is so important because
2916.28s: it uh extended analysis means you're not
2919.60s: learning dicks
2921.48s: yet so execute execute execute learn
2926.60s: adjust learn execute adjust again it's a
2930.36s: wave so if you say I'm going to get 80%
2933.88s: analysis I'm going to execute I'm an
2936.04s: execution mode I'm in review mode and
2939.68s: I'm going to look at what happened I'm
2941.44s: going to improve uh analysis 80% 70%
2945.80s: execute and so you have that wave where
2948.92s: you and you know where you're where
2950.28s: you're at I do have clients that come to
2953.00s: me that just in agony over their
2956.60s: strategy and they'll they'll send me 20
2960.16s: pages of details of their strategy and
2962.76s: where they and should I adjust this by
2965.72s: 01
2967.80s: 1% and when we get down to it many of
2970.64s: them are
2973.04s: afraid of being wrong of executing of
2977.40s: learning in the chaos that they're
2979.92s: looking for a structure to give them
2982.44s: comfort so the more I analyze the
2985.12s: structure the more comfortable I feel
2987.68s: and yet there's something gnawing at me
2989.56s: I I'm not moving forward and I'm not
2991.44s: getting done so what I do is said well
2994.32s: okay let's just play and we let's set up
2997.48s: a demo account and your job is just to
3001.36s: execute at
3002.76s: 70% that's it we're not there's no money
3005.40s: involved but consistently execute the
3008.60s: strategy just consistently and we're
3010.96s: going to measure you not on the
3013.60s: p&l but did you execute the strategy and
3017.12s: they'll execute maybe at 40% of the time
3020.36s: okay we're going to we've now measured
3022.32s: the 10 trades you're executing 40% let's
3025.20s: move it up to 60% 70% 80% until we're
3029.28s: executing consistently now we're
3031.96s: learning so we're also learning that
3034.48s: every
3035.60s: trade every trade has a reason not to
3039.80s: make it in that moment because if
3043.24s: they're wasn't I mean if there wasn't a
3046.12s: reason
3047.60s: it then it's probably not a good tra
3052.12s: right there's always reasons not to
3053.84s: execute so again it's a wave know where
3057.08s: you are in the wave and Analysis
3061.68s: paralysis uh executing that 70% if
3064.68s: you're consistent with it you'll learn
3068.16s: more one of the most impactful things
3071.08s: that took me a long time to get over
3073.72s: especially when I was a younger dude
3077.80s: um I always felt like I had to
3081.48s: perform exceedingly well and it never
3085.36s: really felt imposed externally it always
3088.12s: felt like it was just an expectation I
3089.64s: had of myself for whatever reason I
3091.00s: don't know the background behind it but
3093.96s: when I think about one of the big pivots
3096.20s: I made in my trading career it was
3099.48s: becoming okay with losing
3102.48s: trades now I find and I know you don't
3105.88s: like the term there might be a better
3107.16s: term but I find that there's a balance
3110.28s: or maybe you know uh not sure the the
3112.92s: term I would want to use here but that
3115.64s: there's a balance between
3118.60s: desensitizing and not tying the outcome
3122.32s: of an individual trade to me as a human
3125.04s: being but also treating losing trades
3128.44s: with respect because they deserve
3130.92s: respect they understand what happened
3134.12s: what what would you surmise the role and
3137.64s: the optimal relationship with losing
3140.96s: would be for a Trader yeah what I do is
3145.32s: is we measure
3148.28s: the percent of Trades that are executed
3152.44s: well and so we have trades that are
3156.80s: executed well and trades that aren't
3158.68s: that's the only measurement that we lose
3161.16s: that we
3162.88s: use and so our job is to execute all the
3167.12s: trades well and that's it and if the
3169.64s: strategy doesn't hold up we're going to
3172.00s: learn that um so there is no loss so you
3176.56s: you know from
3177.92s: Neuroscience that our brains deliver
3180.72s: twice the amount of pain for a x loss as
3184.28s: it does for an X gain so what we do is
3187.88s: we only measure the execution so if I
3191.48s: can get my execution up to 80 90% of my
3195.04s: strategy that's a big win and we no
3197.72s: longer lose so we we don't look
3203.04s: to somehow not feel the losses but we
3207.24s: reframe it so that our win is execution
3210.84s: when we're in execution mode and we'll
3213.36s: say oh well looks like that strategy
3215.48s: didn't work very well in this market
3217.48s: nothing to do with us no failure it's
3220.12s: just the strategy and the market and our
3222.04s: job was just to execute the strategy
3225.28s: okay can I is there indications that I
3228.64s: could look for a different Market mood
3230.56s: to put this strategy in so then all of a
3233.48s: sudden we're not in the situation where
3235.88s: we're having to feel the loss at all
3238.60s: because our only job is to execute the
3242.04s: strategy and execute it
3244.96s: well that's a really different
3248.72s: perspective and it's interesting to hear
3251.52s: because to
3252.92s: me hearing that it sounds like I would
3255.76s: say that that person's hiding from
3257.84s: reality that they're unable to accept
3262.64s: loss and that we can't even use the term
3265.52s: loss
3267.28s: what do you think what do you think
3269.64s: about that do you think that that's
3270.88s: misguided or like my my perspective or
3273.88s: do you think that it's relative to a
3276.64s: person of course everyone's different
3279.80s: but I find that moving
3283.46s: [Music]
3285.60s: from handling
3288.72s: loss to just executing the trades is
3292.92s: something that's totally under your
3294.28s: control totally
3296.92s: so have a have a
3300.00s: category of of trade executions that if
3303.72s: you're rested you did your research
3307.84s: analysis you determined what strategy
3310.36s: you're using and you executed it
3313.52s: absolutely that is a lucrative
3316.24s: trait doesn't matter if it's profitable
3318.52s: or not so it's either lucrative or it's
3322.20s: not lucrative and our goal is just to
3325.44s: make lucrative trade Tres now everything
3327.36s: in a lucrative trade is under your
3329.60s: control so you can have 100% lucrative
3333.12s: trades now you can sit back afterward
3335.36s: say and say okay in fact I have a
3337.44s: spreadsheet especially for this that we
3340.12s: look at uh each strategy and we can
3343.64s: determine and we look at the market mood
3345.84s: and we can determine well H how's this
3348.24s: strategy working in this market mood but
3350.60s: what that does is it removes our ego our
3353.88s: our need from the equation because our
3356.48s: when I was on the floor trading my job
3359.48s: was just execute the trades they The
3361.72s: Firm gave me the values I bought under
3364.16s: and sold over that's all I I did so
3368.12s: again The Three Hats you know are you in
3371.00s: uh research and strategy building are
3373.84s: you in risk management or are you in
3376.64s: execution mode and once you're in
3378.68s: execution
3380.44s: mode
3382.16s: the uh losses is is not something you
3385.64s: even consider
3388.20s: because there is no loss you're making a
3390.80s: series of lucrative traits now when you
3392.72s: look at it and review it then you can
3395.52s: determine accurately whether that
3397.16s: strategy and that market mod is working
3399.44s: but it's not you and it's not your
3403.12s: failure fascinating yeah it's so
3405.72s: interesting I love and I love the way
3408.56s: that you kind of share like a very
3412.44s: different perspective in the way that
3414.44s: it's still I can see how that would
3416.24s: would work for somebody and when I look
3419.20s: at the the path of Traders it obviously
3422.40s: seems highly
3424.24s: individualized people have a lot of
3426.32s: different motivating factors and the way
3427.96s: that they perceive things when you look
3430.88s: across your overall experience doing
3434.12s: what you do what are some of the most
3436.84s: common themes that you find among
3440.44s: Traders discipline willpower I need more
3443.92s: discipline I need more willpower that is
3446.24s: is the one that keeps coming up um I
3450.68s: don't execute my strategy I just need
3452.84s: more discipline and willpower and so
3455.60s: again just like going from lousy to
3458.92s: lucrative trading and reframing
3461.64s: that I say there is no such thing as
3464.24s: willpower there's no such thing as
3466.40s: discipline what there is is your
3469.92s: experience of stepping into a state and
3473.32s: an execution that feels better in the
3475.40s: moment so let's set it up so that
3478.36s: following your strategy feels better so
3481.24s: that it's oh I want to be there I want
3484.04s: to be there I want to be there um as
3487.32s: just a side note what's interesting I'll
3490.00s: often trade with my active Traders I'll
3493.20s: be there on zoom and I'll just be in a
3496.20s: window and I'll have them just kind of
3498.48s: think out
3499.84s: loud not one Trader has ever violated
3503.24s: their strategy well maybe once but that
3506.12s: it just the almost
3508.76s: never violated their strategy while I
3512.04s: was their
3514.48s: present why is that they didn't need
3517.68s: willpower they didn't need discipline
3520.48s: but I keep inviting them to their higher
3522.92s: level agency and they know I'm there and
3526.92s: and so what that our training goes is to
3530.56s: have them incorporate that internally so
3533.16s: they have that higher level agency
3536.36s: I love that that's fascinating too I
3538.72s: think the idea of becoming more familiar
3541.52s: like self-aware with agency is probably
3544.52s: something we have to spend more time on
3546.60s: in the future because it seems one of
3549.40s: those topics that as you talk about it
3551.44s: it's kind of you know straightforward
3553.28s: generally transparent you kind of know
3554.68s: it's there but obviously it's incredibly
3557.32s: nuanced so I I love that you bring that
3560.80s: to everybody's attention and something
3562.32s: for them to to focus on but um as always
3566.28s: every time I talk to you the time flies
3568.56s: and it's it's incredible I I really
3571.92s: enjoy just learning the perspectives and
3575.08s: I think that you offer a lot of really
3577.12s: interesting ideas and approaches that
