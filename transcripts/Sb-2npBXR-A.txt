409.00s:  I'm curious about from here is we
414.00s:  we
416.00s:  that hopefully. Now, one of the other things that we did is spend a little bit of time
421.92s:  piecing together when he got into these other positions, which I actually think is a really
427.28s:  important process that we went through because it highlights a few things to me, but one of them
434.00s:  primarily being he had like this really heavy scale day on the 22nd that then tailored off.
444.08s:  And it seems this almost seems like happenstance that ends up going on here. This is what 35,000
452.24s:  contracts, like I don't know, it's just these seem, these seem weird to me.
461.84s:  I haven't really been able to get to the bottom of that from at least a perspective standpoint.
467.36s:  So I am very curious here.
473.36s:  Now, where we left off, we had gone through, we understood his stock position when he added
480.80s:  what the residual basis was that he needed to add all that stuff was in here. I also went
488.80s:  through and I took a look at the time, the time distribution of entries, which I do think this
493.92s:  is kind of interesting if, oh no, I don't want that. I want to insert a chart.
502.32s:  So what I did is, I don't want a line chart, I want like a frequency.
511.36s:  No, that's not it either. These aren't what I want. Yeah, I'll deal with this later.
518.00s:  What I noticed when I was looking at his entries is that there was a lot of frequent entries
525.44s:  at the same time frames. So you can see this 12 handle, which is right before the market closed,
530.88s:  is really dominant in his entries. And we can see a couple stuff near the morning, but not many.
538.72s:  So if we were to eyeball this, get rid of this, super chart. So let's do like 11 o'clock in past.
547.52s:  This is a count of eight, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, out of 24.
564.88s:  So the majority of his entries occurred in that 11 and past
570.96s:  handle, which is really interesting.
573.84s:  Nick says, thanks again for doing this. Eric, this is actually an awesome series,
578.24s:  how you're statistically analyzing the trades. It's amazing. Yeah, for sure. Happy to do it.
582.48s:  Part of this is I am genuinely, I'm just super fucking curious. This is the kind of thing that
589.76s:  I actually really enjoy spending the time looking at this with you guys because it's such a,
596.24s:  there's so many elements of it that are so fascinating. I was actually, I was texting with Newton.
601.60s:  What he and I were talking earlier today. He was telling me about the PSA grading thing,
609.68s:  which is really interesting. Oh, he just texted me again. Hold on. He's telling me about his next hype date.
621.60s:  And I'm asking if we started a tracker.
623.60s:  I really want to see how these different hype dates work out. Specifically from Newton.
634.40s:  Because I know like on on Reddit and stuff, I see like a lot of people just kind of take pot shots at
639.84s:  stuff. Cedric says seventh, no. Yeah. So I see he told me it's seven, no. And he says, I'm asking
652.24s:  them for some details around it. Like what's the general thesis behind it?
657.76s:  And then I also am asking if we have a, if we have like a tracker, because that would be really cool
664.64s:  to keep an eyeball on.
668.24s:  All food says I love the clip he posted. You know what you're going to do.
674.00s:  I don't know what that's in reference to. Misty.
676.32s:  Groan.
681.60s:  Not a real name. That's almost like diaper. Oh my God. What is what the fucking handles in here today?
693.84s:  So we got, we got misty growing. Would you and Newton consider opening an escape room franchise to get?
703.76s:  I don't think so. I've never really been in the escape room. I've done like two of them in my life.
711.84s:  So I'm not so sure that I would go into the escape room franchise business. But
718.80s:  Viam Pyrrdu says having joined the stream. He's always welcome. Yeah, it's an open door. I asked him
724.00s:  a couple times and he said that he was busy. So I haven't been asking him just because you know
729.52s:  what that's like. You don't want to make somebody feel like you're you're pestering them. But the
734.64s:  last time I invited him on, I told him it literally I do these every single Saturday and he's welcome
739.68s:  to join me quite literally whenever he feels like it. And then I told him as well, if he ever wants to
745.28s:  try to set up another period in time, that works better for his schedule. Like if it's something
750.88s:  earlier in the morning or whatever, like I'm cool with that. But right now I think he's kind of happy
754.96s:  with his production schedule. And I also, I remember when he and I first started speaking.
760.08s:  One of the first things he told me is that he actually doesn't really do like collaborations.
764.16s:  Quote unquote that he kind of does his own thing typically. So yeah, that's my that's my guess is
772.48s:  that he's just kind of like enjoy and do in his thing. I think the live streams he enjoyed,
777.04s:  you know, when we when we spoke about it. But I didn't get the sense with the competing interests
782.40s:  that he has now, you know, that it fits in well. But yeah, like I said, he and I we literally
787.52s:  text almost every day. So we'll find something at some point. But it's I know what it's like to be
794.00s:  super busy. And I wouldn't want him to feel any pressure whatsoever. Because that just kind of sucks.
799.84s:  Because one of the worst things is like sometimes I'll have friends that invite me to do something.
803.68s:  And it's like two or three times in a row that I can't do it. It starts to make me feel like
808.24s:  shit to say no. It feels like like I'm letting them down. So I don't like putting other people
814.40s:  on that circumstance. But yeah, definitely always, always down to chat with the dude and same thing
821.20s:  with Prove and Bull. And I have kept in touch via text. And I'm I'm working. Well, I like we
830.16s:  don't really have anything lined up. But we're working on a couple other things for now. But we'll
838.24s:  will do something else again in the future. Because I he and I both get along really well on top of that.
843.52s:  That's another thing that I've noticed so far is like most of the people and it's people that you've
847.60s:  all put me in touch with. By the way, it's not people that like I've found because I don't know the
852.08s:  folks in the space as well as a lot of you do. But when I first started doing the GME videos,
857.76s:  I've had a handful of people reach out to me, be like, oh, you should talk to Richard Newton. I
862.56s:  obviously I had no idea who he was. And then I connected with them and enjoyed like all of our
869.36s:  conversations. He and I have even gotten into some like philosophical stuff, which has been cool.
873.60s:  And then even with Prove and Bull, you guys put me in touch with Prove and Bull. Like a lot of
877.84s:  you said, like, hey, reach out to him. He would be another cool guy to talk to. And he and I, we spoke
883.92s:  very briefly before the live stream. Like the last time the first time I actually like spoke with
889.36s:  him was on that live stream. And then he and I had another phone call, I think like last weekend,
894.16s:  where we spoke for a bit just about other stuff. And he's another just really solid dude. I like
901.52s:  him a lot. So you guys have you guys have put me on like put me in touch with some like really,
908.96s:  really cool people, which I'm thankful for. Prove and Bulls fascinating because of his his broader
913.68s:  background. I like I don't know how much I'm not familiar with his content. And that's not out of
918.72s:  any disrespect him. I literally just do not watch like trading content typically. But so I'm not
925.44s:  familiar with it. I don't know how much he talks about like his own trading and stuff like that. So I'm
929.92s:  not going to dox him. But that's one of the things that he and I spoke a little bit about. That
936.72s:  was really interesting to like understand the the background he has from like a studies perspective
942.64s:  versus the practical perspective. So he has a lot of really interesting perspectives on things
949.68s:  which is fun to fun to dive into. So yeah, you guys haven't missed yet with the recommendations.
956.00s:  I'm super appreciative because one of the things is I actually find I find I really like
963.04s:  collaborating a lot with people like a ton because it's also like the same thing this do in the
968.32s:  live streams is way more fun for me than making videos like hands down. It's if there was like a
974.08s:  better trading presence on like Twitch or something like that. I probably would just do that
978.88s:  versus YouTube because most of my stuff on YouTube like I built a lot of the core content as it sits.
986.08s:  But like the process of like making videos. I don't care about I like sharing information.
991.04s:  So the collaboration side of things have been super super fun.
995.36s:  Dipper King says the collapse bring different perspectives in a single combo which makes them
999.76s:  very fun and interesting. Yeah, definitely. And the other thing is I think I think collaborations.
1009.60s:  Well, like the first one we did was a lot of me understanding his perspective and kind of
1014.16s:  picking his brain on the broader context. So that's one of the things I wanted to do in the future
1019.84s:  is have one where it's kind of more of an open dialogue about different ideas and stuff.
1025.44s:  Just to kind of probe a little bit. I don't like when I'm first getting to know somebody,
1029.92s:  I much prefer to like shut the fuck up and listen and understand them as much as I can. But I think
1037.28s:  he'll be another kind of person that will be fun to kind of go back and forth and explore ideas.
1042.40s:  I completely agree.
1046.00s:  The impureta says you could do a react of Richard's new video which goes over his 7 November theory.
1053.92s:  Oh yeah, maybe I could do that. I'll text him and see if he's cool with that. I don't really
1057.20s:  know how that works in terms of like YouTube if it's going to turn us off.
1062.08s:  I'm texting him really quick.
1063.44s:  I'm like.
1069.44s:  Pull up your video and watch it with the stream.
1075.76s:  I'd like to see if he's cool with it. I wouldn't just watch somebody else a shit on mine without at least asking them first.
1088.40s:  Misty Grine is wild of a name. What if Trump and Harris revealed they have common interests
1118.32s:  of scrabble and wine and the nation heals bigly. That would be on fleek would love that. And it's
1124.64s:  not even like Donald Trump and Harris. I think it would be cool if like all of them like just
1130.16s:  Democrats and Republicans. We're just fucking chill with one another. That would be dope.
1134.48s:  Dr. Zay says we be kind of interesting to see Eric on the PP show. They are true degens though not
1139.36s:  sure if the vibe would be right. However, they do have extreme deep knowledge of the saga.
1144.96s:  I yeah, I've heard you guys mentioned the PP show a couple times. I don't know. I literally don't
1149.28s:  know anything about them though. So yeah, you guys would have a much better sense if it's like a good fit
1154.88s:  to connect with them. I think at one point somebody said that there was a stream going on
1161.68s:  not recently like a few weeks ago. And I popped on the stream and I reached out to them there.
1166.72s:  But I think the audience was not having that. I think the audience was I think they went right
1172.48s:  down thinking that well, just saying that I'm a shale and all that kind of stuff. So I don't know.
1179.12s:  Yeah, maybe it's maybe it's not a good fit. But I did reach out to them on one of their live streams
1182.72s:  at one point. But I never heard anything from them. I told them, you know, I tried to do it not
1188.96s:  not. I didn't want to interrupt the stream. But I don't think they had like an email or something.
1193.68s:  I don't remember. That might be them or somebody else. I can't fucking remember.
1197.44s:  That was somebody I tried to reach out to. I fucking I reach out to a lot of people. I get rejected
1202.72s:  by the most most of them. I mean, it's I say that partially in just people are just fucking busy,
1207.28s:  man. So I totally get it. I unfortunately, I'm not as responsive as I would like to be. So I
1213.20s:  totally get it. Cedric says Eric don't go to P.P. Why not?
1218.40s:  Vim Pyritus says they're shady. Oh, okay, got it. Yeah, see, that's the thing is if it's
1223.12s:  if it's something that wouldn't be good, I don't want to do it. But if it's something that if
1227.92s:  it's something that you guys think would be fun, I'm always down. But yeah, like I don't like working with
1237.76s:  I don't like doing fanatical stuff like people that are too into their own theories and stuff.
1244.40s:  I don't do well with and people that aren't willing to have like an open conversation about ideas.
1252.56s:  Like I prefer to align and work with people that are pursuing like truth and actual information.
1259.36s:  That's what I care about. And there are some people that are good at doing that. And there's
1263.60s:  some people that are not doing good at that. So yeah, I don't I don't really.
1271.68s:  Cedric says avoid P.P. like to play. Dipper says wild tin flo in speculation. I see.
1277.20s:  Okay. Yeah, and I mean, a little bit of tin foil school, right? Like I have my tin foil hat.
1283.60s:  I actually really love exploring some of the crazy ideas. But at least from my perspective,
1290.48s:  I think it's just important to be able to acknowledge when we're going out on a fucking limb and
1296.16s:  just having a good time going out on a limb versus what our rational brain can quantify, qualify,
1305.52s:  and prove I keep those two deeply partitioned in my brain. And I wait what I can prove or
1313.68s:  disprove light years more heavily than what I think feel might think could be those kinds of things.
1321.60s:  So yeah, I don't really, I don't really go that route.
1327.76s:  All right. Oh, and it looks like Vim Pyritus gave out five outlier training memberships.
1333.84s:  Thank you so much for doing that. Looks like Vim Pyritus hooked a few people up.
1338.00s:  Make sure that if you hooked you up, you say thank you. That would be super nice of them.
1342.88s:  Thank you very much. I so let's let's pick up somewhere where we left off here.
1352.32s:  We had just finished getting through these. We understand this trade. So now let's go back here.
1357.84s:  And then let's start working through these other updates, I say.
1362.16s:  And then oh, yeah, that's the other thing we were doing that was kind of a bigger.
1366.88s:  We got all the way through here. Didn't we? Yeah. So we got all the way caught up with the positions.
1373.28s:  So then on to June, this is where we start. And I, oh, yo, you guys didn't even fucking,
1383.36s:  how could you guys betray me like this? I rely on you all to keep me on task, on hand,
1389.92s:  doing the right things at the right time. And you guys didn't tell me to pull up our fucking
1396.56s:  eight map. Any new ads to this. So we still don't have anything from Papua New Guinea or
1403.60s:  Madagascar. We're missing those for sure. We're still missing Iceland, Greenland.
1410.80s:  What's this little place? The Faulkland Islands? Oh, no, I mean this one.
1415.60s:  South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands. Do you guys even know that this was a place?
1425.60s:  Is this? What do you guys think? Magnum says you have to have thick skin for the Pepe show.
1434.24s:  That's hilarious. That's good. I mean, but yeah, I mean, I
1438.32s:  spent most of my adult life in the Marine Corps dog. So I think thick skin is essentially all
1446.08s:  that I have. Why my skin is so fucking ugly. I need Google maps, though. Google maps.
1454.96s:  And we need to go to this place, which is what? South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands.
1468.40s:  Is there anywhere that we can see from here?
1475.04s:  There is. Okay.
1484.80s:  Okay. So let's see. This looks like a little city. Let's see what they got going on here.
1491.68s:  Oh, God damn.
1500.64s:  Yo. This is like
1510.72s:  okay. This is, uh, this is next level, nothing.
1522.40s:  This looks like nothing, nothing.
1529.84s:  Wow. Oh, shit. We're inside.
1539.36s:  Dude, Google maps is so fucking cool. The Larsden.
1547.20s:  Yo, this is so sick.
1552.64s:  I love these kinds of things, those kinds of places.
1565.92s:  All right. So they have a lot of rust.
1570.72s:  What are these people? Oh, this is like a tour. I don't, I'm not about to try to be like super
1577.04s:  racist or anything. I'm not a racist, but I'm guessing that these are Asian people.
1586.80s:  Where'd they all go? The reason I say that is more often than not,
1594.48s:  whenever I travel and I see people in like the same kind of, uh, raincoats like this,
1601.04s:  it's super frequently as Asian people.
1607.20s:  I'm guessing that they came in off this cruise ship and like a boat dropped them off.
1615.28s:  Whoever it is.
1620.32s:  But yeah, when we were in Iceland, we came across this massive tour group of Asian folks
1626.88s:  that were, let's see, hard to tell.
1637.84s:  Same people there.
1648.88s:  This is crazy.
1656.72s:  Okay. I mean, that looks Asian to me. I think I'm on, I think I'm on point.
1667.68s:  Yeah. When I went to, when I went to Iceland and when I went to Norway,
1675.68s:  we, we came across two really big groups of like tour groups and they, they were Asian people
1683.36s:  and they all had like really nice kit and it was all the same, same color.
1690.08s:  Not red though. They were yellow and the other one. They don't look Asian. That's definitely not Asian.
1698.00s:  I love it how this dude has his face blurred out and then they're just like,
1704.24s:  fuck, fuck both of you.
1709.76s:  That's hilarious. Yeah, definitely not Asian. See, this is why like validating
1717.04s:  hypothesis is you can, yeah, definitely not Asian.
1722.16s:  That's a, that's a old white dude. See, perfect.
1729.04s:  Had a hypothesis, clearly disproven.
1732.72s:  She's thrown up gang signs. Who knows where she's from? I don't.
1737.60s:  EOS 70D for 60D. I have one of those. Where are y'all from? Can't see.
1747.52s:  I want to know where you people are from. We're going on a tour with them though. This is kind of
1751.12s:  nice. It's that symbol. I don't know that symbol. Damn. This is crazy. This place is nuts.
1766.56s:  Very, very cool. That's grit to grit to grit to whatever in. Oh, it's the red people again.
1773.84s:  These are different red people. Oh, I see what's going on here. They make them more red so they don't
1779.60s:  fucking lose them. That's exactly what this is. This is so that they keep eyeballs on them.
1787.60s:  That's hilarious. Wow. So they literally, they put them in red so that you can fucking,
1796.32s:  you can fucking see them.
1804.00s:  Where's this? This is like a little loop trail.
1809.76s:  Now these people are in blue.
1817.68s:  Uh-huh. Fascinating. Very, very cool.
1827.68s:  All right. So what we need is to find somebody from here though is what that looks like to me.
1831.84s:  We need somebody from South Georgia.
1833.44s:  It looks like somebody said they had England here.
1853.04s:  I'm in nook, Greenland. Misty groin. Is that true?
1857.84s:  Misty groin. Are you being honest or are you just trying to get my hopes up?
1863.92s:  Don't play with my heart, Misty Island. Misty groin.
1869.04s:  Nook. Don't play with my heart.
1878.00s:  Hey, it's growing, Titty. What up, growing, Titty?
1887.04s:  I need to know if Misty groin is is fucking with me or not.
1891.36s:  Because if we have somebody from Greenland, that's like a massive win in my world.
1896.96s:  But I'm scared to get my hopes up.
1903.92s:  Let's see what it looks like around Nook's crib.
1910.24s:  Yo, look at everybody. Wave. Make sure you take the time to wave to Misty groin.
1918.08s:  Misty groin says, do I sound like a jokester to you? No, I don't think so.
1924.80s:  Hey, yo, somebody hooked us up. Somebody said this on the last stream that homie from
1930.88s:  there was, I forgot fucking homie's name, but they said that they were going to hook us up
1934.88s:  with somebody from the Middle East. So we got Ali from Iraq. Fuck yes. Ali, where in Iraq are you from?
1948.40s:  I don't say bagged at because we're going to start having fucking flashbacks and shit, but
1954.24s:  hopefully another town in Iraq. Where in Iraq?
1968.64s:  Roryn Clity says Misty groin, yo, I can't even say these fucking names anymore.
1973.76s:  Some people, they don't really like sometimes when I curse, but as I'm sitting here saying these
1981.28s:  names, I'm realizing that it's just out of control. Like I'm talking about roaring,
1988.08s:  titty roaring, Clity, Misty groin, like we are, we're all over the map here. Babylon?
2006.56s:  Got it. Cameron, thank you so much for the $5 Canadian that will go to the door-to-night,
2017.68s:  and we got Winnipeg. Winnipeg, wrapping the set, all right. Do a quick. See what the deal is in
2031.04s:  Winnipeg. All right, let's pick somewhere that looks cool. This looks like it would be rich people.
2042.80s:  Where are the homeless people here? This is where the homeless people are. Let's see if we can spot
2046.48s:  some homeless people. Okay, this looks like just a nice little park. Looks super gray. Don't love
2058.96s:  that for you. Super gray. Looking for the homeless people. Bet you there's one in there.
2069.76s:  Aha. I fucking told you.
2077.20s:  New it. Listen, I grew up, I grew up spending a lot of time in the Bronx, New York. I know exactly
2086.16s:  where the fucking homeless people are. Can always tell exactly where they would want to. Oh,
2092.08s:  now it's sunny. Here we go. Oh, now it's gray. Damn. Those are just people living their best lives.
2102.80s:  All right. So now we know what it's like around Cameron's crib. We visited Cameron.
2109.60s:  Got a tour right through here. Weed. All right. We can shut this down. I think we can shut this map
2118.48s:  down because I didn't see. Liecaster England. I think we have somebody from England. I don't know
2127.36s:  where. Liechester. Kester. Lie Kester. Oh, you fucking say it. Let's see.
2140.72s:  Oh, yeah. Maybe.
2144.00s:  Lester. Thanks, Nick.
2151.44s:  Nick. Hello. Who is this? Who fuck is it? Sneo.
2155.76s:  He'll. Sneo from Lester. I mean, it's not fucking Lester. Let's let's let's lie.
2164.72s:  Sester. Lie Sester. There's fucking extra ease and shit. There's no, no, it's not Lester.
2171.76s:  I mean, I'm sure it's Lester. I'm sure you're correct. But I just I fucking
2176.16s:  absolutely hate when we disrespect letters like that. In the English language is terrible.
2182.40s:  That way, I'm not saying English is good because English is not. But we're just disrespect and let
2186.80s:  we're literally disrespect and letters, right? Because Lester, there's a fuck. What about this E?
2193.76s:  Even if we're going to pretend that this C is an S sound fine. Okay.
2200.64s:  Less S. There's a fucking E. I would be down if we said less Sester. That's okay. But
2212.96s:  Lester is just straight bullshit. It would be lie Sester. So I'm petitioning to call it
2221.28s:  lie Sester. But speaking of England, what's the beef between England and like the UK? Why do you
2227.20s:  guys? Why is it like such a big, big breakdown when we look at South and North here? What's the problem?
2237.12s:  I think y'all should just get along. Hey, Isle of Man is cool because there's a big motorcycle race
2243.36s:  that goes on there that's fucking crazy. Those dudes whip around these on 600 CC bikes.
2251.84s:  I think it's, I don't know if it's actually on this island, but it's called the Isle of Man, which is
2256.00s:  nuts. Okay. So we have a good, we have a good covering of this map. We have Greenland added.
2264.00s:  We still need a Madagascar, Papua New Guinea, something like this would be good. But we're filling in
2273.04s:  here. This is good. All right. Then let's close our map down and let's get to work. I feel like it's
2280.96s:  time to start getting to work here. Okay. Let's see what we have on the agenda. This we need to zoom
2294.08s:  out super far. And we have our workbook. Okay. So this will go here. This will go here. And what I'm
2309.12s:  going to do now is pick up from here and pick up with what trades he has. So at this point, we,
2323.68s:  I'm just going to put hold because I don't know when he bought to open. Right now he holds
2329.28s:  120 K of the 21 June 24 20 calls. And when does he post this?
2346.96s:  Well, we know he started getting into these in the 20th of May. So 20 May,
2353.28s:  21 June 32 DTE. These are shorter term. These are much shorter term when he started getting into
2370.24s:  these. This is very, very different than most of his other entries from the time that he posted this.
2386.80s:  So he holds 120 K of the 21 June 20 calls. He did that for $5, $6, $7, $5, $4. And this is when he started entering,
2402.96s:  started entering 31 32 DTE. I already forgot because I'm an idiot. What was it? 32. Damn it. I knew
2413.44s:  is a 50 50 chance. It's the good old 50 50 90 50 50 chance 90 percent chance. I'm going to pick the
2418.40s:  wrong one. So this is I consider this to be actually quite noteworthy. So if we plot out of curiosity,
2435.20s:  how can I do this simply? I could do it like this. So this is 495
2445.36s:  52 107. Make this easier.
2465.76s:  1498.
2473.76s:  458 3.
2486.72s:  Got to carry my list with me.
2492.16s:  94
2493.52s:  the
2497.52s:  168
2503.52s:  229
2508.52s:  229
2512.52s:  138
2517.52s:  137
2523.52s:  32
2534.52s:  Fascinating. What do you guys think of this?
2547.52s:  This to me looks like he fucking knows something I have to be completely honest.
2554.52s:  That's what that looks like to me.
2558.52s:  That looks like you fucking knows something.
2576.52s:  Average is 180 dTE.
2584.52s:  There's literally two.
2590.52s:  There's two entries here that are sub 50 dTE.
2596.52s:  If this was 50 dTE, I would have bought it.
2601.52s:  Like that would be okay.
2604.52s:  Meaning it would fall more in line with this.
2609.52s:  This we know we can see back. This was clearly in earnings play.
2615.52s:  That's what this one was.
2629.52s:  That's fucking something, man.
2634.52s:  I believe
2641.52s:  I believe it's something.
2648.52s:  This I don't know though.
2651.52s:  Roryntady says yes, but what did he know?
2654.52s:  We'll take a look.
2656.52s:  I think we'll be able to have some ideas.
2660.52s:  The reason I so let me be clear.
2664.52s:  I look at this and it's an orange in my mind.
2669.52s:  This is a it seems more likely than not.
2673.52s:  That something is known.
2675.52s:  That's it seems like it.
2677.52s:  And I'm emphasizing the fact that it seems like it versus saying something like it is.
2683.52s:  Because it's still 32 dTE from when he started scaling in.
2688.52s:  So I do believe that that's topical.
2691.52s:  So let's go on demand.
2694.52s:  Let's go to this year.
2698.52s:  Let's go to 20 May.
2710.52s:  Pause it.
2718.52s:  Pause it.
2721.52s:  Pause it.
2724.52s:  Pause it.
2727.52s:  Pause it.
2731.52s:  Pause it.
2736.52s:  Pause it.
2739.52s:  Pause it.
2742.52s:  You know what this looks like to me?
2746.52s:  Pause it.
2749.52s:  Pause it.
2752.52s:  Pause it.
2757.52s:  This is.
2767.52s:  Pause it.
2774.52s:  Pause it.
2779.52s:  Pause it.
2782.52s:  Pause.
2786.52s:  Pause it.
2791.52s:  Pause.
2794.52s:  Pause.
2796.52s:  this
2815.28s:  I wish that I could fucking filter it by what I want.
2822.28s:  17, 0, 5, 2, 0, 2, 4.
2827.28s:  Doesn't let me do this.
2829.28s:  Oh, no.
2830.28s:  Damn it.
2835.28s:  The tens.
2840.28s:  Let's do tens from the strike.
2845.28s:  10, 10, 4.
2852.28s:  26, 4.
2862.28s:  26, 4.
2865.28s:  25, 4.
2868.28s:  24, 1.
2875.28s:  Yo.
2886.28s:  Yo.
2896.28s:  24, this is.
2903.28s:  This is interesting.
2906.28s:  This is really, really interesting.
2911.28s:  24, 25, 26.
2926.28s:  Dude.
2932.28s:  This.
2936.28s:  This looks like he tested a position.
2942.28s:  This looks like he tested a position and then replicated it once it worked.
2952.28s:  So if we go to 24 April, 1,000 of the tens,
2964.28s:  25 April, then there's 1, 2, 3, 4,000 more.
2971.28s:  We go to 26 April, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,000 on top of that.
2987.28s:  This looks like he was testing an idea.
2992.28s:  And this looks like he started testing the idea on the 24th of April.
3003.28s:  And then it looks like his idea worked.
3010.28s:  So if we go to April 24th.
3018.28s:  This is where.
3020.28s:  Now I can't, I'm not sure if he started testing it before this.
3024.28s:  And this is when he started scaling.
3031.28s:  But the fact that this started on 24 April.
3040.28s:  Let me take a look at another reference period super fast.
3043.28s:  Let me go to the 20 March.
3046.28s:  March.
3052.28s:  Go somewhere in here.
3061.28s:  This is fascinating.
3081.28s:  So my best assumption right now of what the cat is doing is this looks like he had an idea.
3099.28s:  I don't know why the idea started with an entry here.
3103.28s:  But it started with a light entry on the 24th.
3106.28s:  So let's see what happens is we move from the 24th to the 25th.
3112.28s:  That goes up.
3116.28s:  25th.
3119.28s:  He, I want to be super clear.
3121.28s:  He is in big air quotes.
3123.28s:  This person.
3125.28s:  Teams.
3126.28s:  To then add.
3128.28s:  And it looks like they add.
3131.28s:  Up to one, two, three, four thousand more contracts.
3137.28s:  That's the 25th.
3139.28s:  Let's go to the 26th.
3143.28s:  Up again.
3147.28s:  26.
3148.28s:  We scale.
3150.28s:  One, two, three, four, five, six.
3154.28s:  And then we go to the 26th.
3160.28s:  These are in the money at the time now.
3170.28s:  Exactly what I think happened here.
3172.28s:  I can't prove it.
3199.28s:  I can't prove it.
3205.28s:  I can't prove it.
3213.28s:  Oh, man, my fucking.
3217.28s:  My head is spinning right now.
3222.28s:  I'm going through my mind.
3231.28s:  This looks like.
3239.28s:  This exit here.
3243.28s:  Looks like a test.
3248.28s:  So this is one.
3254.28s:  Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
3259.28s:  Comes down.
3264.28s:  This could be a fucking mistake too.
3268.28s:  Because then we buy right back in 30 minutes later.
3274.28s:  So.
3283.28s:  This is so interesting to me for a lot of reasons.
3288.28s:  The first one is there's obviously something around this time frame.
3293.28s:  That led to interest.
3297.28s:  So.
3300.28s:  I have to understand more around this time frame.
3303.28s:  What was going on?
3306.28s:  But I think that this was testing an entry, meaning starting with a much smaller position and seeing how the market would react to the size and to the liquidity.
3319.28s:  And most importantly, seeing how the stock would react.
3323.28s:  My hypothesis here is starting to believe more and more that in this time frame, he didn't think or didn't know or didn't.
3335.28s:  It wasn't at a larger scale of how much he was influencing the price of GameStop.
3341.28s:  I think here he comes in fully knowing how much he can influence the price of GameStop.
3348.28s:  And he knows that here.
3351.28s:  And I think what he's doing in this instance is testing the market response to this specific trade.
3360.28s:  Then I think he's testing the market response to scaling in at a much smaller size.
3366.28s:  And then I think he's testing the perceived movement of it from that point forward.
3374.28s:  Dr. Zayah says, how can a single trade influence the entire stock? It's a great question.
3379.28s:  So the way that this can influence the stock is on the 24th when he entered those were at the money.
3388.28s:  These tens were at the money.
3390.28s:  And if we look at the volume, let's take a look at a curiosity.
3394.28s:  The volume here was 4.8 million.
3398.28s:  The volume of the day before was 2.5.
3401.28s:  My guess is when this 1000 lot came through that triggered a few things to happen.
3409.28s:  The first is they likely were starting to hedge some of the calls.
3415.28s:  The second thing is I think that between the buying activity and the hedging of the calls that probably led to other market participants starting to think, oh, there's something going on here.
3427.28s:  Again, this is how I personally find trades as well. That's why I think this.
3432.28s:  So it's not that I know what's going on, why it's going on. I have no idea.
3437.28s:  But this looks like testing an exit on this and then buying in more because these were bought when they were in the money it looks like.
3449.28s:  So the really interesting part about all this is that my big assumption as it sits now before we go further into the rest of this, which will be informative for me.
3465.28s:  But my current hypothesis is at this point, he knows how impactful his trades can be.
3474.28s:  And I think he knows that his movements can move the stock. That's what I think.
3481.28s:  And it looks like there's a lot of little testing going on here. If this is him, if this is him, I cannot confirm that this is him.
3492.28s:  But I find a couple really interesting components to this where we start on the 24th of April and we're getting into 17 May,
3505.28s:  and then if we take a look at the follow on trades when he did come back and post a yellow update, it's a very similar DTE on the original entry.
3519.28s:  So very interesting to me. Very interesting to me because there was none of this activity prior to this point in time.
3530.28s:  And then the activity started at this point in time. So that's why I believe they're linked again can't confirm it, but that's what I believe.
3539.28s:  So now let's see what happens to these let's go into May.
3547.28s:  And they get unwound 15th 16th let's let's actually track these now at a curiosity.
3559.28s:  So I'm going to move these down here.
3567.28s:  And I'm just going to do some scratch math.
3575.28s:  We'll put this over here.
3579.28s:  So then we have 24 April.
3585.28s:  This was at 1214 29.
3590.28s:  We don't have to worry about GME size was 1000.
3595.28s:  Premium is 114.
3602.28s:  This will be in thousands.
3619.28s:  Then we have 25 April.
3625.28s:  See 0 819.
3630.28s:  I see 1000.
3633.28s:  And then this looks like he all floated 145 K worth.
3649.28s:  And then that happened at.
3669.28s:  Interesting.
3672.28s:  So 25 April.
3696.28s:  So 25 April.
3702.28s:  A sale order comes in here.
3708.28s:  And then 25 April again.
3712.28s:  We buy back 0 8 20 30.
3719.28s:  That movement is interesting.
3729.28s:  That movement is interesting because it looks like.
3734.28s:  This should be 19.
3737.28s:  This looks like he tested like a day in entrance before exit the next day in the beginning.
3744.28s:  And then entered right back in after it.
3747.28s:  So this looks like he's testing how the markets responding to these transactions 25 April.
3756.28s:  Then 0 948.
3763.28s:  33.
3765.28s:  I was here 1000 again.
3769.28s:  This is 140 K.
3775.28s:  Then there's 25 April 12 32 46 10181 25 April 12 46 43 10146.
3800.28s:  This is scaling here 25 April.
3804.28s:  For whoever this is, I think it's him.
3808.28s:  But 12 49 17 1665.
3820.28s:  Then we have 26.
3833.28s:  It's so 26 May.
3838.28s:  0 7 16 16 1000.
3846.28s:  100 K.
3850.28s:  0 8 16 25,000.
3858.28s:  0 5 0 8 39.
3866.28s:  56,000.
3871.28s:  0 5 2 20 0 8 57.
3880.28s:  32,000 25 0 9 100.
3890.28s:  24,000.
3894.28s:  227.
3898.28s:  0 9 0 8 0 6 1000.
3906.28s:  Minus 235.
3913.28s:  0 9 33 31 1000.
3919.28s:  60.
3930.28s:  Nuts.
3933.28s:  Absolutely not.
3942.28s:  And then let's take a look at here.
3945.28s:  Let's take a look at these on lines.
3952.28s:  5 May.
3955.28s:  Verse 6.
3956.28s:  Wait, I'm in, I'm in it. This is April.
3972.28s:  Then here we have 6 May.
3979.28s:  0 7 11 10.
3983.28s:  We took down 5,000.
3987.28s:  And we took in 3 mil.
4002.28s:  We took in 3 mil.
4009.28s:  We took in 3 mil.
4017.28s:  We took in 3 mil.
4025.28s:  So this is our sale.
4032.28s:  15 May.
4039.28s:  15 May.
4046.28s:  15 May.
4054.28s:  15 May.
4061.28s:  14 May.
4069.28s:  14 May.
4076.28s:  14 May.
4081.28s:  14 May.
4088.28s:  And this is.
4093.28s:  0 8 24.
4096.28s:  0 1.
4100.28s:  This is 1000.
4104.28s:  This is 2.38.
4108.28s:  0 8 27.
4115.28s:  52.
4122.28s:  1000.
4126.28s:  2.3.
4131.28s:  0 8 30 20 1000.
4137.28s:  2.35.
4143.28s:  8 32.
4146.28s:  1 1000.
4149.28s:  2.3.
4152.28s:  So this looks really, really interesting because what I'm seeing here is he tested selling a 1000
4165.28s:  lot here.
4167.28s:  Then on the 6th he opened with trying to sell 5000.
4176.28s:  And my guess is he didn't get a price that he wanted.
4181.28s:  So because he didn't get a price that he wanted, he then scaled down into 1000
4187.28s:  and tried to exit on these smaller sizes.
4194.28s:  That's my guess here so far.
4197.28s:  Let's all 15 May and then we have 16 May.
4201.28s:  The thing I'm going to do after this is take a look at all of the actual numbers and see how they line up.
4213.28s:  So this is 16 May.
4217.28s:  So this is 12 16 49 1000 1.
4226.28s:  9.
4232.28s:  This is the same.
4235.28s:  31 28 1000 minus 1.91.
4244.28s:  Now I don't know what to make of these last two.
4253.28s:  These last three are a little weird.
4260.28s:  Let's do size at least 50 or something like that.
4272.28s:  I'm just going to make the assumption.
4275.28s:  I don't know how true it is.
4276.28s:  I'm going to make the assumption that each of these is actually tied to essentially a 1000.
4284.28s:  Let's just do the math really quick. Let's see.
4287.28s:  So here.
4295.28s:  There's 6000 at the end of this.
4301.28s:  Here.
4303.28s:  There's 6000 again.
4308.28s:  This is a total of 12,000.
4313.28s:  And then this is less seven.
4322.28s:  No, it's more than that.
4324.28s:  Oh, I'm an idiot.
4326.28s:  I was doing count.
4327.28s:  I'm so stupid.
4329.28s:  This is 11,000.
4331.28s:  We have to count this again really quick.
4333.28s:  Oh, it fortunately worked out because these are all 1000.
4337.28s:  So this is 11,000.
4342.28s:  So far.
4345.28s:  My guess is just one of these is him somehow.
4350.28s:  I don't know which one.
4354.28s:  We could just make the assumption that there was another 1000 somewhere that we didn't track and there was 13 and both of these represent the remainder of that doesn't really matter that much.
4365.28s:  Um, man.
4371.28s:  This is fucking interesting.
4373.28s:  Yeah, okay.
4374.28s:  So Dr. Zayah says that there's a meme spree.
4376.28s:  So we have to pull up those memes now.
4378.28s:  I definitely think we need to take a look at that.
4380.28s:  I'm going to grab another salt water really quick because this is about to get busy.
4401.28s:  You
4431.28s:  You
4462.28s:  All right.
4471.28s:  We are back up.
4476.28s:  I'm going to grab another one.
4486.28s:  Vladimir says those are 17 May and 24.
4488.28s:  Why would you told them together?
4490.28s:  Yeah.
4491.28s:  So I'm just I'm eyeballing numbers.
4493.28s:  I'm not because I can't tell what's discreetly him.
4497.28s:  What's not him.
4499.28s:  This to me like moving in these 1000 lots.
4503.28s:  So I'm just trying to see if they work out in the aggregate and realistically they actually kind of do right.
4509.28s:  So if we looked at the total size for all of these using all of them combined from the jump.
4522.28s:  And we look at the exits in May.
4525.28s:  We can see that essentially what adds up here is what's here.
4531.28s:  I think it looks like using two different expressions.
4533.28s:  That's my.
4536.28s:  That's my current guess here.
4537.28s:  Now again, it's all this stuff is always open to interpretation and what we have to break through.
4544.28s:  Because I think the next big step here is for us to actually go through his.
4551.28s:  His posting.
4552.28s:  I want to see if we can glean anything from there because my guess is there will actually be some messages.
4560.28s:  In there.
4561.28s:  That's the current guess.
4562.28s:  So.
4568.28s:  Vladimir says Gil was never on record buying anything other than monthly op-ex contracts.
4572.28s:  Yeah, I don't think that matters.
4574.28s:  Right.
4575.28s:  Like him being on record for.
4577.28s:  Dude, like I guarantee you Gil is done a lot of things that you haven't seen.
4582.28s:  Right.
4584.28s:  I understand using it as a reference.
4586.28s:  And I think it's a smart way to think about references.
4589.28s:  Because I agree with you in general.
4591.28s:  That's the same way that I personally would look at it as well.
4597.28s:  The part that I'm departing is because I just it looks like to me that even with this other trade here.
4607.28s:  When he scooped some 3 DTE options.
4615.28s:  Like this is a pretty stark departure as well.
4619.28s:  So just as this 3 DTE and this 30 DTE is a departure.
4625.28s:  I don't see why there couldn't have been a departure in expiration cycle.
4634.28s:  So, but I agree with you again all of this is a guess we don't even know if this is him.
4639.28s:  Blancway's he says maybe because weeklies are more likely un-head.
4642.28s:  No, that's not it.
4643.28s:  That's not it at all.
4644.28s:  The he's disincentivized from going into the weeklies in general.
4648.28s:  It looks like the the weeklies themselves.
4653.28s:  They're less liquid so he would prefer those other contracts because he he was building into bigger size as longer ideas.
4661.28s:  So I generally agree with off Putin that he hasn't done non-monthlies before.
4668.28s:  I just don't think that necessarily he is relegated to them.
4675.28s:  So, off Putin says look at 12, 15 and 20 strike he typically buys out of the money not in the money.
4682.28s:  I think the problem there is you're getting too locked into a reference.
4687.28s:  And I think that you're not adapting to the data as it fits because for example,
4693.28s:  he going off of like what he did before.
4697.28s:  He also never bought anything other than one isolated occasion options that were less than 50 DTE.
4705.28s:  This in here looks like a and this is genuinely part of what I was expecting to see.
4710.28s:  This looks like a different overall approach.
4713.28s:  That's what I see here.
4715.28s:  This looks like somebody that's playing the overall value change in something.
4719.28s:  This looks like testing an idea.
4722.28s:  That's what I think this is.
4724.28s:  Don't know what, but I think the him typically buying stuff that's out of the money is completely fair.
4732.28s:  But I think the way that he traded in this period is different than what I see so far from this period.
4741.28s:  It literally looks like a general change in approach.
4746.28s:  So, at least that's again, just loosely part of what I'm seeing so far is a general change in approach.
4755.28s:  Let me, I have to grab some drugs real quick.
4760.28s:  I forgot I skipped my dosing. Give me one sec.
4771.28s:  All right, we're back.
4790.28s:  Getting hot in here.
4793.28s:  I'm going to take top off soon.
4798.28s:  So, yeah, this looks like that.
4803.28s:  Now, let's take a look at the breakdown now between these.
4810.28s:  Look at April.
4815.28s:  I'm just going to color code them.
4818.28s:  So, this is one.
4824.28s:  Well, here's a 500 in here in a 798.
4828.28s:  So, these are.
4830.28s:  So, there's definitely some other positions that were built out that got split up.
4835.28s:  So, there's definitely more in here.
4837.28s:  But I see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten of these.
4845.28s:  There.
4848.28s:  And then this is probably another one.
4852.28s:  And then one, two, three, four, five, the 15.
4856.28s:  Yeah, I mean, that's kind of a clean number as well.
4860.28s:  It looks like 15.
4868.28s:  Fascinating.
4869.28s:  And that's fast.
4884.28s:  So.
4899.28s:  So, I know that amount of money he doesn't care about.
4925.28s:  So, this would be, this would be in consequential.
4931.28s:  Which is why I think this is him testing something.
4939.28s:  And then he unwinds a thousand here.
4942.28s:  It's hard to tell which thousand might have been unwound.
4945.28s:  It's essentially impossible.
4947.28s:  Well, let's just, let's make the assumption that he had.
4954.28s:  So, that would be, this minus.
4963.28s:  I guess plus because it's a negative this plus this.
4972.28s:  What is it if I do negative out of curiosity?
4975.28s:  Yeah, okay.
4978.28s:  Absolute value of that minus that.
4995.28s:  I'm so thought.
5007.28s:  I just want this to be scalable for whatever this ends up turning into.
5035.28s:  I don't know what yet.
5051.28s:  I'm just almost 200 grand there.
5056.28s:  And then these are all.
5059.28s:  These are all eggs.
5064.28s:  So.
5066.28s:  Three two dot three eight.
5069.28s:  You know three five two not.
5072.28s:  I fucked that up.
5073.28s:  I didn't do that three five to.
5077.28s:  Three five.
5087.28s:  Two dot three five one dot nine one dot.
5095.28s:  And then these are all negative.
5105.28s:  I'm just going to kind of loosely eyeball what the rest of this looks like.
5122.28s:  This is five of them.
5125.28s:  So this would be not this one, but one two three five all these.
5133.28s:  32.
5135.28s:  Damn, he would have made a lot of money here.
5139.28s:  He would have made a whole lot of money here.
5142.28s:  That's not so bad.
5160.28s:  I'm just turning all these into the same format so I can.
5174.28s:  Newton's cool with us watching his video.
5177.28s:  So I'll pull that up in a little bit.
5183.28s:  Damn.
5185.28s:  I'm so fucking.
5188.28s:  I'm so curious now.
5193.28s:  This these I can get rid of.
5198.28s:  Let me start exiting here.
5200.28s:  So this equals this.
5206.28s:  Minus.
5209.28s:  This one.
5211.28s:  This one one.
5213.28s:  You three four five.
5220.28s:  1000.
5239.28s:  I'm just going to fill these in super fast. So it's easier for me to track.
5246.28s:  And one two.
5252.28s:  This equals this minus this.
5263.28s:  I'm here.
5275.28s:  One two.
5281.28s:  That's right.
5284.28s:  So this.
5299.28s:  It looks like almost 11 million dollars.
5304.28s:  I'm going to fill this in.
5314.28s:  And I think it's a little bit more than that, to be honest.
5319.28s:  So this looks like a test run to me.
5330.28s:  I'm going to fill this in.
5340.28s:  Let me take a look.
5344.28s:  I want to take a look now at his Twitter.
5350.28s:  I want to see if there's anything.
5355.28s:  I'm going to take a look at that.
5358.28s:  That's the thing.
5365.28s:  I forgot how to like quickly get to the bottom of this thing.
5375.28s:  Oh, the other thing.
5380.28s:  I'm going to take a look at this one.
5390.28s:  So can you guys take me to where 24 April is please.
5403.28s:  I'm going to take a look at this one.
5413.28s:  This is a big one.
5417.28s:  This is a big one.
5421.28s:  This is a big one.
5428.28s:  I'm going to take a look at this one.
5438.28s:  It's always hard for me to tell how much he tweets.
5444.28s:  I'm in media.
5451.28s:  The guy in the seat is the start.
5455.28s:  Oh, that's right.
5459.28s:  Wait, this is when he came back.
5462.28s:  He didn't do anything before this.
5469.28s:  This was on 12 May.
5483.28s:  This looks like take a look.
5486.28s:  Started getting in here 24 April.
5491.28s:  Had a couple test exits here and here.
5501.28s:  And then on 6 May, he made $2 million.
5508.28s:  And realized that this thing works.
5513.28s:  12 May made this post.
5518.28s:  When is 12 May?
5521.28s:  The Sunday 6 May was the was the Monday before.
5527.28s:  I don't know what to make of any of that if anything.
5533.28s:  So to me, this looks like he was testing an idea.
5540.28s:  Yeah.
5553.28s:  And it lines up very, very well with the timing of these trades.
5562.28s:  The thing that doesn't line up well are the entry times.
5579.28s:  He has a lot more morning stuff here, which I can't explain.
5582.28s:  That's a hole in the theory compared to these.
5587.28s:  But my guess is I don't think he's weighing the time that heavily.
5590.28s:  I think he's generally trading early morning towards the close.
5595.28s:  That definitely holds true.
5597.28s:  And then I think the rest of it is probably just when he happens to be logging on.
5603.28s:  Like I don't think he's purposely trying to get on it like a specific time.
5607.28s:  I don't see why he would.
5609.28s:  I don't think he'd care.
5614.28s:  Wow.
5620.28s:  I mean, that looks pretty fucking clear to me, to be honest.
5628.28s:  That is some shit.
5635.28s:  Now what the fuck?
5638.28s:  24 April.
5640.28s:  I 24 April.
5645.28s:  What happened?
5646.28s:  24 April.
5649.28s:  I'm going to ask perplexity.
5653.28s:  Let me go into a new thing.
5659.28s:  Summarize all key news and events around GameStop.
5668.28s:  And it's stock on 24 April.
5680.28s:  Rowan to the says why are you so surprised?
5685.28s:  I don't understand.
5687.28s:  I'm surprised for a couple of primary reasons.
5690.28s:  The biggest reason why I'm so interested now by this is I see a massive shift in approach.
5698.28s:  Massive shift in approach.
5701.28s:  This entire time frame is somebody that's trading this thing on a value perspective.
5708.28s:  Thinking that something is going to grow in value get bigger.
5712.28s:  Just overall up kind of idea.
5715.28s:  That's what these trades all mean to me.
5718.28s:  The way that we're entering longer term positions.
5721.28s:  The way that we're scaling in and out.
5723.28s:  We're holding them for typically long duration of the trade.
5728.28s:  All of those things really lead me to believe a very specific approach which is based on expected value in the future.
5737.28s:  This is a quite literal complete departure from that complete departure.
5745.28s:  And it signifies between this time frame a complete change in approach has occurred.
5754.28s:  Don't know what, but I can tell you that based on the trades I see coming back from 24 from his departure 2021 and 2024.
5765.28s:  Assuming, and this is a big assumption, assuming that this is him, which it fucking looks like it is to me.
5772.28s:  All of those conditions being the case indicate a significant change in overall approach.
5783.28s:  That's why I'm really, really surprised slash interested in this change.
5797.28s:  Roryntady says it's kind of devalue just short-term swing trading, not at all.
5802.28s:  I mean, I get your point, but it's not.
5804.28s:  And the thing is is that we know he changes from being a value investor.
5807.28s:  He talks about it.
5809.28s:  So value, like value doesn't materialize in a month.
5816.28s:  Value is the kind of thing that takes years.
5818.28s:  And again, signified by his first option is trade that we can trace back to being 495 days.
5826.28s:  Right. So like this is absolutely a value play.
5831.28s:  But then you can see as we start getting near and near in time, even to these trades in 2020, like as we look across this latest entry of trades, they come in massively in time.
5843.28s:  168 DTE, 137 DTE.
5846.28s:  So the overall trend actually starts to contract in overall time here as we get near and near in his overall in his overall time frame doing this.
5860.28s:  Right. Up here, he's doing, he did a stupid small little play with his, this was an earnings play.
5867.28s:  We already know that.
5869.28s:  But like, but when he bought in here on 14 Jan 2020, 450 DTE, 190 DTE, then as we get into July, he start coming down 137 DTE.
5880.28s:  So the time frame started contracting a little bit.
5883.28s:  I think part of that just has to do with what options were open as time was passing, right, where the next primary expiration was that's far out in time.
5891.28s:  But this is a complete departure from that. This is literally a different approach.
5896.28s:  So that part is real interesting because then for me, it begs the entire question of what is the approach.
5909.28s:  And I'm hopeful that as we go through a couple more of these, we'll be able to see a little bit more detail of like what the approach is because there's something going on here.
5924.28s:  Ricky says, I mean, are we surprised his most recent trades are a lot more pump and dumpy.
5930.28s:  I mean, to be completely honest, they are.
5934.28s:  I don't think it's with the idea of.
5939.28s:  I don't think it's the idea of like trying to dump on retail. I don't think he'd do that.
5944.28s:  But I do think it's him understanding he can move the market and playing the movements that he can do in the market. That's what I think.
5956.28s:  Because this is out here.
5964.28s:  So I think it's going to be around $3,220,220 and then when he, these are what?
5971.28s:  20 May to 21 June.
5975.28s:  These other ones came in.
5978.28s:  24 April.
5981.28s:  Yeah, so those are also about a month.
5983.28s:  So I cannot help but find that also completely completely different.
5990.28s:  So one that was 52 DTE and he had one that was three and I actually think that the one that was a 52 DTE.
5997.28s:  Where is that one?
6000.28s:  This one.
6007.28s:  That looks like playing something. I don't know what.
6011.28s:  But he had one there and then again, this three, we know exactly what that is.
6016.28s:  So all of this, they're typically trades that are greater than 100 DTE.
6021.28s:  Then we get two back to back series of 30 day trades.
6030.28s:  That's real interesting.
6032.28s:  That's completely different than the rest of the modus operandi that we see here, completely different.
6040.28s:  Which again, it harkens back to the idea that we have a change of approach.
6047.28s:  And this, this looks like measuring the impact.
6056.28s:  What happened on 6 May?
6061.28s:  Let's do this. Let's go to May.
6065.28s:  Ricky says like to everyone that isn't a blind diamond hands holder, I thought it was obvious.
6076.28s:  He was profiting off manipulating GME in his most recent trades.
6081.28s:  I don't it's hard to say with respect to like the manipulation that starts to get into like that terminology,
6087.28s:  like the specific meanings and stuff and that part I'm not personally positive of.
6092.28s:  But I do see your point and I do broadly agree.
6099.28s:  Yeah.
6116.28s:  And then he says, is it manipulation if there are a lot of unhedge calls and he is using that?
6121.28s:  There's not going to be a lot of unhedge calls.
6125.28s:  So another thing to keep in mind is I actually, and I think I talked to you guys in the discord.
6131.28s:  This isn't loading for some reason.
6133.28s:  I'm going to put you guys over on the second screen so I can close out and log back in.
6137.28s:  Sometimes that helps. So I'll put you guys over on the screen.
6141.28s:  But I was speaking with one of my buddies.
6144.28s:  Well, he is one of my friends, but he's much older.
6147.28s:  He's been in the market making business and options trading business for a really, really long time.
6152.28s:  And he I we spoke briefly a couple times and I spoke with him a couple of weeks ago about a couple things that I was finding as I was doing different research on the cat.
6163.28s:  And I asked him about a meme stocks in general in how meme stocks have changed the market making space and how they react to stuff like that and whatnot.
6175.28s:  And essentially that boiled down to him saying that like in a broad perspective, market makers have gotten a lot more calculated with the risk that they'll take.
6189.28s:  That looks like thinkerswim is being updated because it's trying to log in right now and it can't.
6194.28s:  So that's that other goes.
6199.28s:  So yeah, I that goes back to sad, Drake, I don't think that there is a lot of un hedged calls in something like GameStop.
6207.28s:  I think that they would have they would have been hedged if they thought that there was some sort of risk there.
6216.28s:  Blancway, he says he's not manipulating on low volume under the right conditions, a reasonable size, bulls position has some decent impact.
6224.28s:  Yeah, but again, Blancway, this goes back to like what are we defining as manipulation because that that that is like if that's the thesis for the trade that's not trading something under the guys of like a change in fundamental value.
6239.28s:  Right, that's obviously trading the expected movement of something based on a broad market effect and impact.
6249.28s:  So yeah, I don't I don't know what people call or define manipulation as personally, but I think that that's part of the effect here.
6262.28s:  So it looks like it looks like this is down.
6269.28s:  So what I'm going to do is grab good old I'll actually use trade view because I'm trying to get a little bit better with using trade view.
6278.28s:  I don't really or trading view maybe I should call the right name first that can be a good start.
6284.28s:  I definitely need to change this settings though, how do I change the settings so that it's dark there we go.
6290.28s:  That's better.
6291.28s:  And then let me go to GameStop.
6296.28s:  How do I change the settings on this so that the this is dark in the background like burning my retinas.
6304.28s:  This.
6314.28s:  No.
6320.28s:  You guys know I don't know how to use this thing right click got it. Thank you.
6326.28s:  Right template.
6329.28s:  Like the settings top right settings.
6333.28s:  Canvas.
6336.28s:  Back.
6338.28s:  Much better. Thank you.
6341.28s:  Ridlines.
6347.28s:  Where are the grid lines there we go.
6359.28s:  That's cool. That's great.
6362.28s:  Fantastic. Thank you guys. That's super helpful.
6367.28s:  All right. So now let's go back.
6372.28s:  Does it not display of damage to change all those things don't you.
6379.28s:  Text needs to be white.
6384.28s:  Line should be like that.
6389.28s:  Okay, so now I can see there we go.
6392.28s:  All right.
6402.28s:  I'm going to get caught up.
6411.28s:  Ricky says.
6414.28s:  I'm not using manipulation in a negative context he knows the post making impact on the stock so he loads up. Yeah, I don't.
6420.28s:  I don't think that that's a poor thesis, be honest.
6427.28s:  If you buy a shit ton of in the money calls the market maker whoever sold them is probably going to hedge that's correct.
6433.28s:  That's definitely correct.
6435.28s:  It's also if you buy stuff that's like at the money they typically will start hedging a little bit.
6441.28s:  Yeah.
6445.28s:  Lonzo as he says if he was testing if they are hedge I don't think he's testing if they're hedged.
6450.28s:  I think it's really important to like decouple the different participants here.
6455.28s:  I don't think the market makers are the main people that he's trying to test here whether or not they're hedged or not.
6462.28s:  I think that he's probably seeing what broader positioning looks like.
6468.28s:  That's my guess.
6470.28s:  I don't think that he's playing a bunch of games with market makers.
6474.28s:  I think that makers have a pretty defined purpose and it's not that expansive.
6479.28s:  But other institutions that might be systemically short something like GameStop that's a completely different story.
6488.28s:  I think at least.
6490.28s:  I need to add how do I add some shit I just need to add moving averages at least.
6499.28s:  Do they have no I don't want that ribbon might be fine.
6510.28s:  Normally they'll have like an envelope which is a way for me to do to.
6521.28s:  Because I think I only get like a certain number of indicators or whatever.
6526.28s:  On this intercolon of the ribbon.
6529.28s:  Yeah, okay.
6531.28s:  This will work.
6534.28s:  And then I need to change.
6539.28s:  So we want a 10, 20, 50, probably 150 or 180, 150 is fine.
6552.28s:  The colors are inverted which is the worst.
6555.28s:  So now I have to flip these.
6559.28s:  I'm going to do a 10, 20, 50, 150.
6568.28s:  Perfect.
6574.28s:  Francis says I do think that those are tests for his algo maybe cooking his own algo to beat the head.
6580.28s:  I don't think he's running an algo that's not what that looks like to me.
6583.28s:  I think that those would be so fast.
6586.28s:  And he's also not going to be able to essentially create an algo that would outpace the like what a purpose of an algo is.
6594.28s:  At least in that context.
6597.28s:  So.
6599.28s:  I think.
6603.28s:  The movement that we saw in April.
6607.28s:  That looks like him.
6609.28s:  So I think that's what I'm expecting something to happen here.
6614.28s:  Or expecting the impact of his trades to be something.
6619.28s:  So.
6622.28s:  I don't know what.
6626.28s:  If how what the thought was around this 13 may 14 this time frame.
6633.28s:  Is that part's interesting.
6635.28s:  So the time for the positions is actually like not good in with respect to that it's it's quite mistimed.
6643.28s:  So the unwind started six May.
6648.28s:  Which would have been here.
6651.28s:  And then we see the next unwind was on 15 May.
6657.28s:  So he would have done the same of most true apes which is hold through the peak.
6664.28s:  Start unwinding on the 15th and then the 16th take the rest down on the on the decline. That's it. That's what that is.
6674.28s:  So from that perspective, it's really interesting because it's clear.
6680.28s:  Again, this is not a perfect time thing.
6684.28s:  Like that's what I see here. This is not a perfectly timed system.
6688.28s:  I don't think that this is some sort of you know, understand the the tea leaves and projecting some sort of hyper specific date.
6701.28s:  Like that's not what this is because if that's the case, even with him building the position on 24 to 26, he wouldn't have sold anything on the sixth.
6711.28s:  And he sold a good bit of it on the sixth.
6714.28s:  He wouldn't have sold on the 15th and the 16th.
6717.28s:  If again, that is the case where he knew something was going to happen on the 14th or whatever it is.
6725.28s:  I don't I don't think that at all.
6728.28s:  I think that he thought something could happen from his trades.
6734.28s:  I think something did start to happen from his trades.
6737.28s:  I don't know.
6739.28s:  Do we know when I think we started looking do we know when he bought those shares.
6744.28s:  That would be highly informative here actually when the 5 million shares came online.
6752.28s:  I know that we have like windows and stuff, but do we know the specific dates.
6760.28s:  Let me look at the dark pool.
6769.28s:  And we're looking.
6776.28s:  Let's look in April.
6798.28s:  Okay.
6807.28s:  Let's sort this by premium.
6819.28s:  So this.
6825.28s:  We had 5 million shares here on two June.
6830.28s:  Based on what I see here to June.
6837.28s:  Let's go to March.
6848.28s:  Okay. So quiet in March.
6857.28s:  Generally quiet in April.
6866.28s:  Very busy in May.
6878.28s:  Very busy.
6889.28s:  So one of the things I was trying to test here.
6892.28s:  I was very curious if he bought shares before he bought those options.
6896.28s:  The reason why I wanted to test that is because one of the theories I've here.
6900.28s:  I've heard thrown around is that he kind of is using the share buying or the option buying to cause a wave that he's then using.
6907.28s:  For the other side of the transaction.
6910.28s:  And I don't.
6915.28s:  I don't see that from April at least before those April trades.
6923.28s:  Because these are very small.
6931.28s:  So I don't think.
6935.28s:  I don't think he did that here.
6938.28s:  Now for his.
6941.28s:  May trades that started on the 20th.
6944.28s:  There's an argument to be made.
6947.28s:  That he could have been participating in this time frame when it got busy.
6953.28s:  Let's go to the beginning though.
6957.28s:  Well, that's kind of annoying.
6959.28s:  Let me go to the next page.
6963.28s:  Let me close this window down.
6965.28s:  What did I say the 20th?
6966.28s:  So let's look at this before the 20th.
6974.28s:  Yeah, so this doesn't look like.
6979.28s:  Nothing on the 17th.
6985.28s:  Let's take a look at the.
6991.28s:  16th.
6993.28s:  I know of may.
7003.28s:  Interesting.
7006.28s:  Super, super interesting.
7009.28s:  So what.
7012.28s:  I think it's not.
7015.28s:  I think it's not.
7018.28s:  It doesn't look like he bought shares.
7022.28s:  At least who knows.
7024.28s:  But it doesn't look like he was sizing into shares massively.
7027.28s:  Leading into.
7029.28s:  This period.
7031.28s:  Looks like this was through options.
7033.28s:  I can again also see and confirm that this is not.
7037.28s:  If this is him.
7038.28s:  This is not perfectly timed.
7041.28s:  But it's a very soply.
7046.28s:  Trendy reason.
7053.28s:  acoustic ability.
7055.28s:  That's like mapped out these dates.
7060.28s:  That's what you'll see.
7061.28s:  What I see evidence.
7062.28s:  So far, at least in this comeback period.
7066.28s:  Is.
7067.28s:  I feel like he knows he has an impact on the market.
7070.28s:  to start having the options chain built out like that is, is pretty detectable. I've already told
7077.00s:  you guys this is where I first caught wind of GameStop from my scanners was the beginning of man. I
7083.48s:  think it was the third or the fourth something like that. So this is when I started looking at playing
7091.24s:  GameStop myself because I could just see that it was becoming activated right it was very busy
7099.88s:  and that's different though than what it was doing for a significant periods of time prior,
7106.84s:  like massive massive periods of time prior. So I don't think I don't think that there's like specific
7122.12s:  specific dates though. I don't see that because the exit here again from like a specific date
7128.84s:  perspective is also mistimed. Now let's take a look. What time is it? Oh shit, I gotta get my
7143.00s:  dinner order off. Whenever I'm doing this time is like a fucking vacuum, like a vortex vacuum,
7151.24s:  what it feels like to me, vortex vacuum. I'm stoked for dinner tonight. I'm purposely getting
7169.40s:  shitty food. We're getting a place called crispy burger so that I can get some burgers and then
7175.80s:  chicken fingers. There's a barbecue place in New York that we used to go to in love called
7181.24s:  dinosaur barbecue and I just found that you can get the dinosaur barbecue sauce online. So I
7187.96s:  ordered them and they got in yesterday. So I needed to get a meal that I could do a shit ton of
7193.40s:  dipping and all these different sauces. So I'm very excited for that.
7198.60s:  Off-Poon says it looks like he bought this 5 million shares on May 19 to 29 based on his
7205.16s:  cost basis. I don't, I think that's too hard to say because like the probability of him moving
7214.68s:  in and out of things is so high that I think it's going to be difficult to peg that down. So
7223.88s:  could be like I think your thesis is completely viable. I think it very well could be that but
7228.44s:  there's no way to confirm or deny it. So it's kind of one of those things that I would earmark
7232.76s:  as an idea, but it doesn't really impact a whole lot. I don't think.
7239.96s:  Roin-Klitty says when you say mis time, do you mean that perfect timing would be holding them
7244.20s:  right up to X-ray? No, no, no. I mean better timing would be essentially that X-its with respect
7250.52s:  to the movement of the underlying, right? Like better timing would have been exiting on the
7255.40s:  14th or even exiting on the 13th, 14th, 15th, right? Because when I look at this, the first exit that
7263.56s:  happened here is 6 May and that was a 5,000 unwind. So if we take a look at 6 May, that's here.
7272.04s:  So this is a little bit of a pop for sure, right? Made a ton of money, no doubt. But not
7277.24s:  is anywhere near as much as what would have been made if we had a date, right? Like if we have some
7283.48s:  sort of date that we are super convicted in, then we would play that date. So yeah, that's why
7294.68s:  I don't think that there's like a specific date that he's playing here. There's no artifact of
7301.72s:  that. Even the fact that we have two X-its on the 15th and 16th reiterates the fact that there
7308.12s:  is no date. Because if there were a date, let's say the date was supposed to be the 14th or the 15th,
7314.84s:  then that's fine. But then whenever the move happened around that date, then the exit would happen.
7322.04s:  But it didn't. The exit was spread over a couple days. My guess is he was waiting to see
7327.48s:  if it started to rebound back up. It might have. So that's my, that's my best guess as I look at this.
7337.72s:  Roryng Titty says, how would we know how to follow BlackRock? I don't think that's happening at all.
7342.84s:  Yeah, I don't think that's it. Again, I think, I don't think Roryng Kitty has like this crazy access
7349.08s:  to information that nobody else has or has like a super secret decoder ring that he's using.
7354.28s:  Like I really don't think that. I think based on what I'm seeing in his trades, and at this point,
7359.72s:  I am starting to feel more confident in speaking about what I can see from again, not an opinion
7366.36s:  perspective, but like an evidence-based perspective based on looking at, we literally have looked at
7371.96s:  all of his old trades now. And it looks like he's playing movement. Now this recent change is
7382.68s:  interesting because before he clearly was playing value. Now he's playing movement. So
7393.40s:  that's a little bit of a change.
7401.80s:  XRTFTD, I don't think he's using FTDs. I really don't. I think he knows about them. And I think that
7409.00s:  he's, I think he probably integrates them. The problem with FTDs is that they don't work all the time.
7421.40s:  So I don't think he's basing it on FTDs for that reason.
7430.68s:  If he was using FTDs, there would have been a lot of other triggers that may or may not have worked.
7439.08s:  So yeah, I don't, I don't think the FTDs is the big thing here.
7453.56s:  Jimmy says they work all the time, half the time. Yeah. That's the problem. Again,
7458.44s:  and that's one of the things like when Newton and I, when we discuss things back and forth,
7463.64s:  I think sometimes Newton is a little bit too much in terms of confirmation bias in terms of
7469.96s:  trying to see what he wants to see. And even when we did a few live streams together, there were
7475.00s:  instances that I highlighted for the conversation of the live stream because it's very easy,
7481.08s:  historically to look back and say like, oh yeah, you know, big volume here, big jump here,
7486.84s:  and obviously there was a move. But what I encourage him and everybody to do is when you're
7492.76s:  analyzing these things is to analyze the signal by itself and to assess the efficaciousness
7498.52s:  of the signal. Right. So we can look at either volume expansion, FTDs, and we can run a regression
7506.36s:  to see how effective they predict the movement. And I've done that. And they don't,
7512.44s:  they, there's definitely a correlation to be clear with the movement. A lot of times that
7516.68s:  there's movement, these other things do move. But I don't think it's a causal relationship. I don't
7522.60s:  think that the FDD movement is now forcing the movement in GameStop. I do think there's a
7528.84s:  relationship. And I think it can exacerbate it. I think it can start it. I think that there's
7534.60s:  a lot of relationship intertwined there. But I don't think when we've looked back at these other
7544.76s:  periods where either there was massive volume expansion or massive changes in FTDs,
7551.56s:  I didn't see a clear signal from those. So yeah.
7564.84s:  Vladimir says this shouldn't be that difficult. His yellow account was under 204 million to June.
7573.80s:  What are you talking about when you say this shouldn't be that difficult? What is this?
7577.40s:  Just out of curiosity. The impureta says doesn't always work, but they're meaningful. Yes,
7583.56s:  I agree. They're very meaningful. And they're important. I think they're very important. I think
7586.84s:  they're a part of this whole puzzle. The main thing I'm just highlighting is I don't think they're
7591.64s:  predictive. That's an important element. Now again, are they related to movement? Sometimes when
7598.20s:  they happen, I absolutely think so when we can see evidence of it. The problem is when I'm
7602.76s:  assigning something predictive capabilities, it needs to have some sort of consistency in its
7611.56s:  ability to predict a future movement. So I and I don't see that. That's the main problem with
7619.72s:  using like FTDs as the like a predictable pattern, so to speak. Now I do think that we very likely
7631.72s:  and I mean, this is the interesting thing going forward. We have to I'll have to check out that
7635.56s:  Newton video maybe tomorrow or something like that. I would like to go through and see what he's thinking
7641.40s:  from his from his you know, from his thesis because what was his last date? I think he had a big date
7650.28s:  on like the eighth of August, right? Wasn't there a big one in August that he was thinking?
7660.76s:  I don't remember what it was. Do you guys remember?
7665.48s:  I'm trying to see if is that highlighted 888.
7670.76s:  Yeah, and it doesn't look like anything happened here.
7685.72s:  The prior day close was 2083 and then the open was 21 with a high of 2188. So yeah, that didn't
7694.84s:  really do anything. Again, so even Cedric, the way that you frame that, right? It jumped a little,
7700.04s:  I think that's that's confirmation bias that's looking for and perceiving what you're wanting to see
7711.88s:  because I look at the the close before it was 2083. The open the next day was 20,
7720.76s:  2101. So if I look at the close to the high 2083 and it hit a high of 2188, it moved a dollar.
7731.48s:  Right? So that's using the prior close from 87 to in a that's giving it the benefit of using the high
7741.48s:  of the next day, which realistically, you wouldn't necessarily use the high there. But I mean,
7749.96s:  again, I would give it the benefit of the doubt for sure. So the main thing is, and again,
7756.52s:  like this is supposed to be an opx tailwind, which is supposed to have a thing. And then there's
7761.80s:  a bunch of the the T dates assigned to it. I think he has a calendar somewhere in terms of like how
7767.64s:  effective the different opx periods are. That's actually one thing I would be interested to look at.
7774.60s:  Did this one? No. No. No. No. No.
7792.92s:  No.
7798.20s:  Well, on Swazie says I don't think it's in the sheet anymore. Oh, damn it.
7804.76s:  Did he.
7807.00s:  Because he had a whole thing tracking. I don't know why he would get rid of that. Why would he get rid of
7812.04s:  the the prior movements?
7815.48s:  So it's one of his just buried somewhere.
7827.24s:  Yes. Let me text them.
7841.72s:  Did you get rid of, I'm just going to ask him, where is the table in the, what is this thing?
7852.60s:  And the GME.
7856.12s:  Eat that tract. The prior opx tailwinds and whether or not they connected
7867.56s:  the POSA movement. Let's see. I'm curious about that.
7882.36s:  Yes. So we'll see if that's in here because I wanted a I wanted to look at that.
7885.48s:  Oh, there it is. Wait, is this it? This is it. Never mind. Never mind. Big dog, DAWG. I found it.
7904.20s:  Here. So this was, oh, I guess. So this is supposed to be
7915.72s:  like this here. Obvious tailwind price improvement volume often gap up or gap down.
7922.28s:  I feel like that's the problem is I just I get.
7929.72s:  I struggle with that. I actually don't agree that that's like a opx tailwind here.
7936.36s:  Let's go to because there's going to be a spike in volume. That's for sure.
7940.92s:  But that's because it's just an opx. Right. Like there's, there wasn't a gap here.
7953.00s:  It's essentially within the same candle. I mean like a small gap. I wouldn't consider that
7957.08s:  anything. But yeah, I think is like I wouldn't consider this something necessarily like a tailwind
7971.48s:  hitting volume actually contracted leading into it. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, I just don't see it there.
7994.60s:  Oh, no, that was in 888 of 22. He has an updated. Okay, I see. So he didn't count this one. Let's
7999.64s:  take a look in 22 just out of curiosity. Where the hell is 2022? Here it is. I just want to see
8013.80s:  what he's looking at. August and he said it was August 5th. Yeah, I got it. Okay.
8023.72s:  Yeah, this 100%. I would consider that for sure. Not the fifth, but definitely the eighth, the following
8037.48s:  Monday, the fourth to the fifth. I don't think there was much of anything, but this, this into this,
8044.92s:  there definitely was definitely an expansion and volume, note down, but not significant.
8053.16s:  17 and a quarter to 17.8. Like that's not a big change. So Jimmy says, I got to chat you
8061.88s:  Pt to explain what a top op x tailwind is. That's kind of like a, it's it's not really anything.
8067.56s:  The idea behind a op x tailwind is that when you go into an options expiration, there's going to be
8072.76s:  an amalgamation of trading activity that's going to move the stock price up. That's why he refers
8078.76s:  to it as a tailwind, but op x is just options expiration. Now, whether or not options expiration
8086.28s:  is a tailwind or something else, you know, that's a, that's a whole other, whole other story.
8093.32s:  But this one I can totally see some elements of so that I'm following, following along with.
8102.76s:  Interesting. Okay.
8112.44s:  That Lauren says quadwitching day did a thing that was hilarious, which is also funny,
8116.76s:  because quad, it's not even called quadwitching anymore for anybody that's curious about it.
8121.64s:  I did a video talking about it, because that's like an options derivatives focus topic.
8129.00s:  Here's a video about quadruple witching. It's essentially just triple witching now.
8134.84s:  And it's because of the way that different expiration cycles have aligned.
8139.32s:  So it's still, I mean, you could call it quad, but it's really not.
8145.56s:  The other thing is with so many additional explorations now opened up,
8151.16s:  the overall impact of triple witching quadruple witching is severely diminished.
8157.40s:  It used to be a much bigger deal when it would happen. And
8166.36s:  there was only a handful of explorations available. That's a completely different story.
8170.76s:  But that's not so much what it is anymore. All right. So let's take a look at
8180.20s:  where there are any changes in his positions here, not until here. So let's just skip to that.
8190.04s:  Actually, no, let's not get lazy. We're already here. Let's just do the thing.
8202.60s:  Yeah, it's not even that many. I'm going to be lazy, Eric.
8205.64s:  So let's do region,
8214.52s:  dixion,
8217.32s:  and June, 13 June.
8227.56s:  Regune. Just slide this off so I can easily see.
8233.40s:  Not too many left. So TG, 8546, 3161.55,
8246.68s:  the hash is 29276 400.56,
8254.52s:  and then value is 289276 400.56. Okay. And then there's no change to anything here.
8266.04s:  6 June, we have a TG of 382513161.55. We have cash of 29409.005.
8287.72s:  Oh,
8293.96s:  I did it go up that much.
8300.76s:  All right. And value is at 586459.005.
8310.68s:  Okay.
8315.40s:  Then we have, and June,
8324.52s:  TG is 31. That's fucking crazy. 31, 513. This goes back.
8334.20s:  There are no fucking dates. I don't think, man.
8337.88s:  You don't go from $382 million in gain down to 31.
8344.60s:  29409.005.
8353.24s:  Value 235459.005.
8364.84s:  That's wild.
8365.64s:  And then let's go to 13 June.
8373.88s:  So TG now is 5136454.99.
8385.32s:  We're at 634372401.
8395.64s:  And then 268452844.
8402.76s:  Got a one. And then here, we had an exit.
8414.12s:  And then we also have ad shares.
8417.56s:  This is bought to open 4 million.
8426.68s:  Here's. Okay.
8431.64s:  So let's see what happened to these.
8439.72s:  I know I have to get off in a minute.
8442.12s:  I don't want to rush through this.
8443.80s:  So the last thing that we're going to have on the agenda for this then is to
8448.52s:  analyze.
8453.48s:  I'm taking a note here.
8456.44s:  Analyze, RK, 13 June options, exit.
8467.40s:  But it'll be the next thing.
8469.00s:  Vimperida says SEC and lawsuits would happen if it was an actual pump and dump, hence holding.
8474.92s:  And the meme about SEC coming.
8478.36s:  Yeah, I mean, we'll see because the
8485.56s:  in his case, I think the idea of pump and dump would be really, really blurred.
8491.64s:  Because like even the dudes at fucking whatever that penny stock trading pump and dump
8498.20s:  were the one dude pled guilty and was obviously convicted and like the other dudes fought it
8503.88s:  and they got out on some bullshit technicality even though they're fucking guilty, I think.
8508.76s:  They, I don't want to say their name.
8511.48s:  They
8513.48s:  to prove something like that is very difficult.
8517.32s:  But if you read through that case, it was pretty fucking clear that they were very
8523.88s:  purposefully trying to mislead people and manipulate people. With somebody like the cat,
8529.00s:  the only thing you could even attempt to say is that he knows if he posts a meme, which is true.
8535.16s:  I think so. If he posts a meme, GameStop is going to move. Like I think he knows that.
8540.60s:  So because he knows that, I think it opens up a different conversation then around
8550.20s:  and like ultimately what that looks like in terms of any sort of manipulation. But I think you
8558.20s:  probably will struggle to call that manipulation. So yeah, it's a tricky one.
8566.12s:  Ricky says, what are they going to do? He uses memes as evidence. Well, the funny thing about
8569.16s:  that stuff too is like sometimes I noticed like when they depose rappers and stuff, they'll use
8576.76s:  the, they'll use like rapper lyrics as evidence, which is hilarious.
8583.40s:  So yeah, it's very interesting. I don't really know what to make of it. I'll make a video tomorrow
8592.68s:  about just kind of like the latest of GameStop and kind of where we're sitting now.
8598.84s:  Of note though, one of the things I wanted to do before we balanced is, do you guys
8606.44s:  have a list of any primary thesis or DD or ideas behind like what people think is going on here?
8619.56s:  Because as I'm doing this, I'm starting to create what I believe is going on. But I'm very curious
8626.20s:  if other people like what the most popular analysis is on what's going on because I want to take a
8634.12s:  look at those. I want to start pulling those up. Cellar Box Theory. Yeah, well,
8639.08s:  Cellar Boxing is a thing. It's not even really a theory. But that, I mean, that's probably what
8644.20s:  was going on with GameStop in Cohen's intervention. That's for sure. A region on Superstank has the cat
8651.64s:  error theory. Yeah. So for any of those kinds of theories, if you guys can either email it to me
8656.76s:  or just drop it in the discord outliertrading.io. So you guys can shoot me an email with a link to
8665.72s:  whatever it is so that I can take a peek at it because I want to start looking through them.
8670.68s:  Because once we wrap up the trade here, that'll be the next step, I think, is to better understand
8675.56s:  what's going on now. What happened between 21 and 24? That kind of thing. So we will, we'll see
8685.16s:  how that goes. All right, gang, that wraps me up. Awesome catching up. Always enjoy doing these
8690.04s:  sessions with you all. If you need anything, hit me up. Always around. And then if there's anything
8695.56s:  that you want me to take a look at for the GME, we'll kind of, it'll be a market outlook video
8700.20s:  tomorrow. But I'll include a piece on GME just because I haven't covered it specifically in a
8704.12s:  little while. So we'll take a look. Being outlier, being ape, being outlier, ape, whatever makes
8710.20s:  you happy. See you guys later.
