0.00s: What's up, everybody? Welcome back to the Outlier podcast. I have David Hunter back yet again.
7.32s: We're going to talk about the market, the economy, all things stock market and as per usual,
12.48s: it feels like there's no shortage of things for us to dive into. So welcome back, David.
16.60s: Good to see you.
17.60s: Yeah, thanks are good to see you. It's an absolute pleasure. So first things first, what
23.08s: do you make of the market as it sits today? We are hovering near highs. We see slight divergences
29.16s: between some of the different indices, what not, anything catching your eye in particular?
32.68s: No, I think it's the, you know, we're in the meltup and somebody asked me today, you know,
38.04s: or is the election in a cause us not to have the meltup. I said we've been melting up, you know,
43.56s: it's, it's we're up, the S&B is up 68% and the NASDAQ 84% I think to the highs from the October 22
55.88s: lows. So, you know, that's a meltup in my book. We've been melting up. I think the next stage will
62.04s: be a what I call a parabolic final stage to this market. So I think we're coming to the end of a
68.44s: 42 year second of a bull market thing I've talked about with you many times. And of course, we're
75.24s: two weeks out from an election that in my opinion is probably the most important elections
81.08s: country's history. It's easy to overlook, you know, Civil War, Lincoln and certainly George
88.20s: Washington, but I think at least in modern history, you know, the choices here are stark.
94.92s: We either go in a direction where we kind of begin to take back and get back to a capitalistic
102.36s: free market economy and back to, you know, solutions that are not all government solutions
108.60s: and get away from what I call the New World Agenda, New World Order Agenda of the left.
115.64s: Or we go in the direction of we could we could see the court packed and all of a sudden you
121.24s: don't have a constitution anymore because you've and you may not have two party elections anymore.
126.68s: So I think it's that stark that I know there are people that are, you know, selling their vote
132.84s: for Trump, a boy that alternative is basically we won't see America back to the way it
137.72s: ever was before. So I think we're two weeks out from that. People keep saying, well,
144.36s: does that mean the melt-ups gonna end here? And I said not necessarily. In fact, I don't think so.
149.56s: My conviction is still high that we're going to, I just raised my S&P target 7500 from 7000.
157.72s: I think we could be there this year. So, you know, within the next, basically two and a half months.
164.36s: And it doesn't have to. If it rolls over, I mean, if it takes into the first quarter that's fine,
170.68s: but I think a parabolic means you can cover a lot of ground in a hurry and we'll see a rally like
176.04s: we've never seen. Don't know whether it'll be completed by the end of the year or not, but it's
181.00s: going to be, I think, a big rally. So that's kind of where I stand. Obviously, there are wild cards
188.36s: that can come in between what's going on in the Middle East. Certainly Ukraine, although there
195.32s: doesn't seem to be likely imminent thing there that's going to change. And what can happen
202.92s: between now and election time or even at the election. As I said today on Twitter,
209.40s: I think the things we have to worry most about is the left really has made it very clear that
216.52s: it's almost under no circumstance, do they want Trump to be present again. So that means they
223.88s: feel they are justified in doing almost anything to stop them. We've seen two assassination attempts.
230.44s: We've seen they've got sitting senators saying on their side saying we're not going to
240.12s: certify his election if he wins. And you've got certainly the cheat that's been going on. So
246.52s: and they're setting up one of the just department file suit against the state of Virginia for
254.12s: trying to clean their roles up, their voting roles up because there are an awful lot of illegally
261.64s: immigrants that are not by law supposed to be able to vote. And just department suit is to leave
271.40s: those those names in there. That tells you exactly what the left is trying to do. I hate to be so
277.80s: blatantly political here, but we're two weeks out from something that's I think going to be very
282.60s: very important. Yeah, well, and I mean, it's it's in my opinion, I think it's completely reasonable
289.24s: for people to share their thoughts and opinions on this stuff. It's the only way that information
292.68s: moves around. So yeah, I think you sharing that is kind of part and parcel to the point of doing
297.88s: stuff like this. Now, obviously, we have to beg the question here, though, the S&P made what
304.92s: high today of 5927, 75, long way away from that. What's the what's the catalyst to move from
314.68s: let's just call it, you know, 59 and a quarter to 7500 in your eyes? Yeah, I think I certainly think
322.36s: there's a set up here where I could make the case that we might see a 3% pullback. So you know,
328.04s: back down to certainly 5700 wouldn't surprise me, but I don't think we're setting up for a big
335.24s: reversal here. You know, it's a bit of a sell off and certainly as that could be a little more than
341.08s: that. Russell could be a little more than that. But ultimately, I think it's any pullback here,
347.00s: I think a short live might last several days. And then I think the real move here is what has
353.32s: moved this market for a long time here, which is we still have an awful lot of people who have one
359.08s: foot out the door. They they they see the momentum and they feel like they have to be part of it,
365.96s: but they're nervous as hell and they're saying, you know, this thing could end anytime. I think that
371.16s: wall of worry is a source of fuel to keep this thing going. What can move it? Well, I'm seeing clearly
380.04s: the earnings are still in pretty good shape. The economies defied logic in terms of all the
386.68s: tightening that was done and yet it's still reasonably strong. You're probably still going to get a
390.76s: 3% GDP number. And the consumer seems to have enough left to keep going through the year. So I
400.44s: think at least for the next quarter, there's, you know, basically all systems go interest rates,
406.28s: although they are scaring people because they've backed up. My look at the charts and my look at
413.24s: the overall inflation picture and the economy, et cetera, I think we're bottoming in the bond market
420.60s: and topping in rates here. We had a backup from 360 back to, you know, almost 410, you know, 409. I
429.24s: think I think we're the next move. I think it's going to take interest rates down to three and a
434.52s: quarter, maybe 3% and ultimately, as I've said, before we get through the meltup, we could see
443.80s: 2.5 on the 10 year. So from, you know, from over 4% down to 2.5 is a hell of a move in rates.
452.12s: It will keep the economy from tanking anytime in the next few months. And I think it'll be
458.92s: wind at the back of the market. At same time, I think the dollar as rates start rolling over again,
464.92s: the dollar's poise for a big drop. I think that's bullish. So there's a lot of things there, I think,
471.72s: to complete this. Now people have to remember, the valuations are very high. We're 42 years into a
477.56s: secular bull market, certainly two years into a very strong cyclical move. So, you know, I'm not
485.64s: pretending that this is the beginning of, you know, a long run. But I think you're going to cover a
490.68s: lot of ground in a short period of time on the upside. What do you make of the move in the 10 year
497.88s: yields from 3595 that was on 17-SEP, so where it is today? I think that surprised quite a few people,
506.28s: the strength that it showed from there over the last month. Yeah, I just say step back, look at the
512.84s: the bigger picture. You know, we came down from 475 to 360. It's just as I use the term, it's just
522.04s: part of the normal stair step. You know, obviously in the short run, the catalysts were those that
529.00s: wanted to believe that, you know, you buy the rumor sell the news. So, you know, you've got, you had
535.32s: the Fed cut rates. And then all of a sudden, you have a strong labor number, you know, strong jobs
541.32s: report last Friday. Those kind of things just fed into the idea that, hey, you know, this is the end
548.36s: of the bond move, not the beginning. And so they used it to sell off. I don't, I'm not going for
556.04s: that hook. I really think that's a correction in a bull market in bonds. And as I said, I continue to
564.12s: be, I know there is nerd about their tops of this, but I continue to believe inflation is in very
570.52s: good order right now, moving towards the Fed's target. And that's not going to change. And in fact,
576.60s: I think next year we're going to see deflation ultimately. So I'm not worried about this, you know,
582.92s: the Fed's, the Fed was wrong to go 50 base points and it's going to reignite inflation. I think that's
589.00s: that shows the nervousness that it's out there. I think it's wrong headed. But I think it's what,
593.80s: you know, that's people are kind of adding two and two and getting six.
597.64s: Yeah, can you talk to me a little bit more about that specifically the Fed opening with the 50
603.88s: bases point cut because I think that bounced around a lot for a while and that that I think is a
609.08s: little unnatural for them. Yeah, well, if you look, the Fed fund rate was close to five and a half,
616.36s: you know, five and three, it's five and a half. The, the long bond was down at four percent or below.
624.36s: And the 10 year was down at, you know, it's at three 60. So so when they
631.08s: looked at their policy, they said we're clearly too restrictive. You know, no matter what anybody
636.68s: thinks about the the strong jobs number or not, the policy was restrictive and the economy is not
643.48s: all that strong. In fact, I'd take apart that labor report, you know, there you really have to be
650.04s: a little bit, you know, even if it's not conspiratorial or that they're, you know, playing with the numbers
657.80s: because it's a, you know, month out from an election. And they have shown over and over the revisions
663.88s: have been revisions downward. You know, they get a number and you think, oh my god, and then the
669.08s: revisions are bigger than the number. So so I don't I'm not in the camp that says, you know, laborers
675.64s: doing great shape or jobs picture and great shape. The Fed when they first started talking about a
681.24s: 50 base point cut, you know, a few weeks ago, you know, they were worried that the previous jobs
688.04s: number had been weak. And in fact, the Fed was getting criticized for not cutting in in August or July.
696.76s: So the 50, I don't think they were trying to make up for that, but I do think that really was
702.76s: driven. I had said this way, well before the meeting that I felt just based on I think Austin
710.20s: rules be probably the guy I list think of a handle on this, apparently, but he and he had made it
715.56s: very clear. He he said, you know, a quarter points not going to get us anywhere near where we
722.12s: should be in line with, you know, what the marks times we should be or what the numbers are telling.
727.64s: So I don't think the 50 was in any way a panic to a weak economy nor was it I think a mistake in
735.32s: terms of doing too much too soon. I think it was a step in the right direction to saying we got
740.84s: to get policy back in line with certainly what the market is telling us it should be and also with
747.00s: inflation as telling so it should be. I see one of the things that I've been trying to understand
753.40s: myself is when I'm looking at bond pricing, like even a month ago, it was showing a 29% probability
761.80s: of another 50 basis point cut. And that's essentially completely gone now. Now it's looking like a
767.88s: 88% probability of a 25 dips cut. The part that I'm trying to understand with that is that seems
774.28s: like a pretty erratic move, like 29% probability dumping to zero. Kind of like what are your thoughts on
781.56s: that kind of behavior in the pricing of the future cut coming up? What is it? Seven know.
786.76s: Yeah, you probably could tell me better than I can if you're in that trading world.
793.80s: The erraticness is due to the behavior of the traders. I mean, they're moving that
799.48s: frankly, they don't have a clue. They're reacting to every data point.
803.72s: And so, I think I'm much more steady as she goes. Typical macro strategists looking at a bigger picture.
813.72s: And it's silly to me. You've heard me say in previous meetings. So it's been a while, I've been saying this.
821.24s: I think the feds behind the curve. They're not hurting anybody. They're shrinking the balance she's
828.92s: still. And rates are behind what the yield curve tells them they should be by quite a bit by
835.72s: over 100 basic points. So, you know, to me, I think you've got a lot of traders who have lots of
844.92s: opinions. I don't think they're necessarily being proven very oppression in their views. So
852.60s: they keep going back and forth based on, you know, emotions and based on data points or data releases,
859.00s: you know, and I think it's a silly, and it's always been there, but it may be more so lately.
866.12s: And I think that is partly a sign of how nervous people are. But I've been following the fed for
871.80s: 50 years. I'll put my ability to read the fed and understand monetary policy against anybody.
878.76s: And I just think a lot of people are amateurs at best in terms of analyzing the fed.
886.76s: I think it's fair. I think I also really resonate with your point just on the skittishness.
891.88s: Because that's what I've been kind of sensing from things is kind of, it feels like everybody's waiting
896.60s: for the shoot to drop and not really knowing if slash one that's going to happen.
901.80s: I mean, I probably underestimate how different my perspective can be because I'm a contrarian.
910.60s: So it's like the nervousness that causes most people to say there's something out there. It doesn't
916.84s: feel good. It's the same thing that causes me to have conviction and say as long as everybody's
923.16s: nervous, I'm fine. So I think part of it is just the natural contrarian at me. I don't get shook up
930.12s: by the street going completely in that direction. Yeah. So leading into the 7 November meeting,
937.72s: what's your general thought there? Obviously right now it's looking like a 25-bips cut. But I'm also
943.40s: just curious in terms of what you think the fed might address during that meeting, not to pre-empt
950.60s: the move and not that the fed drives the market. I'm just kind of curious your thoughts on what the
954.28s: focus is here. Yeah, I think it's going to be pretty much there. And I think Paul's been saying this
962.44s: for a while. They're trying to be steady as she goes, not jump around with the markets and not
969.00s: jump around with the data and say, when we look at the trends and when we look at overall picture,
976.04s: we think the move is in the direction of ease or less restrictive. But it doesn't mean that it has
985.24s: to be big steps. We're still going to be kind of diligent in how we approach this. And so I don't know
995.88s: what it's going to be 25 or 50. I don't think it's going to be anything outside those two. I think
1001.64s: people who are worried that there's going to be no cut are wrong. I think people who think there's
1005.88s: going to be something bigger are wrong. But I think it can be 25 or 50. And frankly, I don't think
1012.92s: it matters what it is in terms of my market outlook. I'm bullish either way.
1018.52s: Leads me to a follow-on question though. Your perception if it is 25 versus 50 just for like a
1025.72s: learning case study, how would you differentiate perceiving those two different outcomes if they do
1031.88s: 25 or if they did 50? Like what would you take away from that? And you've heard this from me before.
1038.44s: I think I really pay much more attention to the bond market than what the Fed does in any given
1045.24s: meeting because the Fed follows the bond market. Not precisely and they're not, you know, sometimes
1051.24s: they're going up the direction of the bond market. But I mean the general move in rates is first
1057.72s: dictated by the bond market. And the Fed is kind of looking at backward looking debt and driven by
1067.96s: they just tend to be later or slower. So I'm getting my lead, I'm taking my lead from the bond market.
1077.40s: And as I said, I think you bottomed in the bond market, you know, whenever it was a few days ago.
1084.28s: And then you kind of had a gap up one of those one or two of those days. And today you're
1090.12s: filling back into towards that bottom. So I think you're getting kind of a very short retest.
1096.04s: And so I think you're basically at the lows at the highs and rates and lows in the bond market here.
1102.68s: And I, you know, as I said, I expect to go from, you know, 49410 down to towards 3%.
1111.80s: And if you're getting that, I'm not too worried about whether you get it before November 7th or
1118.36s: after whether they do a quarter now and a half in December or do two halves or two quarters
1127.48s: in the bond markets can be there. The Fed doesn't drive the bond market. The bond market drives the Fed
1134.52s: or sort of drives the Fed. So I'm, I have more faith in the collective wisdom of the bond market,
1143.00s: not any individual bond investor, but the collective wisdom of all those entries into bonds.
1148.84s: I have more faith in that as a dictator who are rates are going. And I think I can consistently
1155.40s: or see more consistency in the fact that rates are, you know, head lower. You know, I have more faith,
1161.80s: I guess, in being able to read the bond market than read members of the FOMC.
1169.80s: It makes sense. Now that's always been a phrasing that I'm really interested by. The idea of
1176.84s: dictated by the bond market versus predictive. Do you think the bond market actually dictates
1183.96s: meaning forces the hand of the Fed? Or do you think that the bond market is really good at
1189.08s: preempting what the Fed is most likely to do just from a causal relationship analysis? Yeah, because
1194.44s: the bond market is not rates. There's a misnomer out there. Rates are not driven only by what the Fed's
1201.64s: going to do up or down. You know, there's, there's the economy. There's inflation. There's,
1210.76s: obviously, a job spicture that the Fed's looking at. But there's a lot of things out there's
1216.12s: supply of bonds coming from the Treasury. You know, if we're just speaking of the Treasury market.
1221.96s: So it's supply demand driven. It's data driven. But it's bigger picture driven. It's the overall sense
1229.24s: that a, you know, a bond crowd, meaning all bond investors altogether as one one market,
1237.40s: inputting all of the factors and variables that are there that, you know, you'd have to have
1244.44s: some supercomputer to do. But in the aggregate law of large numbers, the bond market is pretty
1249.96s: efficient at capturing all of that and determining what I think the future direction of rates is.
1257.24s: So it's not just the Fed. It's really, you know, just like warmly making calls on the stock market.
1264.04s: Stock market is pretty good at, you know, when you look back, you go, who would have thought? The
1268.60s: market would have, would have gone up from 3,500 to 5,900 in two years based on what everybody thought
1277.32s: in the last two years. But the market in its aggregate predicted correctly that we didn't have a
1283.24s: recession. The economy held together better than people expected. Earnings turned around and have
1289.80s: been better. And so, you know, again, not really efficient market, but law of large numbers,
1297.32s: it tends to get things over time pretty right. Now, that's not to say it doesn't have cycles,
1302.84s: and it goes one direction and the corrects back the other. But, you know, I'm just, I'm not
1309.40s: Fed-driven in terms of looking at rates. I'm really more, you know, markets telling me,
1315.88s: you know, and I look at it both fundamentally and technically, technically, I think the
1320.44s: bond market looks like it had a pretty normal correction given how far it had come,
1326.04s: and has now poised for another leg up. Got it. Do you think that there's any impact or
1333.40s: relationship with the Chinese market as it sits now? Obviously, the last couple weeks,
1338.60s: they started talking about different stimulus. Huge, huge run in all sorts of
1344.12s: Chinese-based ADRs. Does that fit into your broader thesis at all?
1350.60s: I think what we saw in China was a big part of it was short-covering. I mean, you know, people were
1358.60s: so, it was in a bigger way akin to the Japanese carriage raid, and that everybody was betting on,
1369.40s: you know, the end had been falling for over years. And so, even though people knew at some point
1375.96s: in reverse, nobody was expecting it when it happened, and when it happened, it happened in a
1380.68s: vacuum and went up fast, and it forced the carriage raid reversal. So, this one wasn't carriage
1388.20s: raid, but it was, again, people had pretty much written off China saying, you know, they just
1394.04s: got too many problems. We're looking elsewhere, you know, or folks, not China. And, you know,
1399.08s: even if the valuations they are looking cheap, we don't care because China's got a problem,
1404.52s: you know, huge problem on their hands. And then all of a sudden, China's prizes and nobody
1410.12s: anticipated, they all knew kind of like Japan. You all knew at some point it would happen.
1415.16s: The people, the investor, didn't anticipate it would be immediate that China would also come
1421.64s: up with a big policy reversal. And they did. And because that vacuum was there, and a lot of
1429.48s: shorts, you had this big rally, some big part of that, I think, was short covering. And just people,
1437.16s: you know, the David Teppers, the world, looking and saying, wow, look at the kind of reversal and
1442.84s: liquidity we're going to see there. That's bullish for not just the next two weeks. So, you had
1448.28s: and people follow him in. So you had that, my guess is it'll, you know, obviously it's corrected
1454.68s: pretty sharply from that initial run. And then you'll have another run, I think, more orderly run.
1461.88s: So, you know, China, China, it's the own, you know, kind of it's its own picture. I don't see it
1470.28s: as a long bull market, but I do see it as probably rallying along with the rest of the world as we
1477.40s: finish out this cycle. And I don't, you know, their liquidity obviously helps global liquidity.
1485.32s: The fact that they've turned on the taps a bit now helps global liquidity. But I think this
1493.48s: basically the seeds were sown for this belt up. And China's, you know, might or might or help
1500.68s: out. Got it. And out of a general personal curiosity perspective, do you have any thoughts on the
1508.92s: real estate market there and any potential impacts to the melt up if there is some sort of big issue
1514.76s: with the Chinese real estate market? Because that's always in conversation to a degree. But I don't
1519.88s: know exactly how important that is. It sounds like the market less so anything from the real estate
1525.00s: side. I will say because you know, I am looking for a global bus next year. There's no doubt my
1532.92s: mind trying to play a role in that. There's no doubt my mind that China real estate is going to play
1539.24s: role in that. So I don't think it's over. I don't think they're out of the woods. I don't think
1542.76s: it's a market made your bottom. I think this was a bottom on the way to a much deeper bottom in the
1548.12s: bust. So and target the markets, but also the real estate same thing. You might get a little
1554.52s: relief there as you know, they provide liquidity and they do some of the things they're going to try
1560.44s: to do that, you know, stop the meltdown. But ultimately, I think there's a much deeper bottom
1568.68s: coming for the whole world, but certainly for China and China real estate next year.
1574.20s: Got it. And for the yen carry trade specifically, that's been
1581.32s: prolific almost at this point. It's been ongoing for so long, so much conversation around it.
1587.56s: Why do you think that it went down the way it did specifically in terms of the at least your
1593.32s: perception of the unwind and people being caught off guard? Because to me, it seems like there's
1597.24s: so many eyes on it. How do you miss it? You miss it because you didn't anticipate
1604.36s: when it actually happened when the end reversed, it reversed in such a violent way because it wasn't
1609.80s: a vacuum. That immediately made those carry trades very expensive. I mean, you know, people
1617.16s: it's not just interest rates. It's the foreign currency on that rate that you and so all of a sudden
1623.24s: it drove your cost of carry up so fast, you know, overnight, that and people were leveraged with that
1633.48s: that people had no choice but to say, I got to look with it. You know, I can't carry this.
1640.52s: So you had the whatever percentage of those that we're using, the yen
1646.68s: for there and I'm borrowing in Japan, whatever percentage were in a very tight spot and very leveraged,
1657.24s: that had to happen almost immediately. Then the balance of people who had more
1662.68s: less leverage and had more ability to kind of work out of the situation, we're given plenty of time
1668.44s: in the following weeks because the end the end backed off, you know, we've had the end back off
1675.24s: for less basically two months. So, you know, those that had the luxury of time have been able to work
1684.20s: out of the trades, you know, and so you had the immediate, you know, what you always do, the kind of
1689.80s: the immediate margin call and then others who said, yeah, I don't want to be there long term but I
1695.96s: don't have to look what they write now. And I think the odds are that if you didn't do it in the last
1702.68s: two months when you've given the second chance, I don't know what you're waiting for. So the odds
1709.16s: are that the majority of that carriage rate has been reversed. Got it. Switching gears a little bit
1715.64s: over to commodities. Crude oil had a pretty wild move relatively, not crazy, but it hit a low of
1724.76s: 65 in September. And then it hit a high of what was the high here, 78, 48 on the 8th of October.
1734.84s: Now it's been trailing down. Thoughts on the move there. Yeah, I mean, as you know, I've been
1740.92s: the bear on the street for oil and you know, I'm still looking for 60 and I actually think there's
1746.84s: a decent chance we see something in the 50s before the end of this year. So obviously a wild car
1753.40s: is a middle east and you know, if it ran hit the oil fields or Israel hit their oil fields,
1760.20s: you know, we could have some disruption there. But my sense is the higher probability is
1767.96s: that oil is going to turn, continue to turn down that we had that scare, you know, that move from
1773.08s: 65 to 78 was entirely based on the middle east and entirely a scare. It wasn't based on Splint Man.
1780.36s: And now we've rolled over and it looks to me like he probably had it for 60 barring something,
1788.28s: you know, happening immediately here. And I would take, I would say it can get into the 50s,
1795.08s: then bounce, maybe it bounces back to the high 60s or the 70s. And then ultimately in the bus
1802.92s: next year, I think we'll see 30 bucks. And that will be, I mean, I only know what the 30s,
1809.64s: the, you know, the bottom, but somewhere down there. And then that will be lows in oil and coming out
1816.60s: the other side of the bus when there's so much money printed to deal with the bus. You'll begin a
1822.28s: long bull market in oil. So if you get, let's say 30 is the bottom, I think you'll see 500
1829.56s: by early in the next decade. So 30, 2030, 2031 somewhere in there, $500 from 30 on oil.
1839.64s: And then you can imagine what that does for any oil equities. So I think you just got, you know,
1847.24s: we're in the bear market in oil. It's been down since 130 and in the spring of 2022 and
1855.16s: Russia went into Ukraine, it's like the 130 from 85 and it's been working its way down ever since.
1861.96s: So people don't seem to understand these things all move in a jagged form. It's a stair step process.
1871.40s: You're going to have moves down and then you're going to move it back up and people always
1876.04s: want, they are always asking me, are you done with your bear call? You know, do you think now?
1880.28s: You finally got this wrong. I said, I'm going to get this wrong. It's what's expected. You're going
1885.48s: to go, yeah, you had a big sell off. You're going to have another bounce. Did it go farther? Sure,
1891.24s: because of what's going on in the least. I would have not been surprised by 75, some needs a little
1898.36s: higher than I would have expected, but I'm not surprised by it at all because of the big things
1904.44s: going on in the least. But I think barring a big event over there, I think you're on your way back
1912.76s: down. What do you think the thought processes between OPEC production right now? Why are they
1919.80s: maintaining the current path that they are? Yeah, I mean, they can't keep cutting because they
1928.76s: need revenue. They've cut a lot and they certainly don't want to increase at this point. So I think
1936.12s: it's kind of, they'll do little cuts at the margin maybe or at least talk cuts, give some rhetoric
1946.68s: and things like that. But basically, and this is a surprise, but we're producing a lot of oil in
1955.48s: this country, in spite of it being in the Biden administration. Yes, Trump would be producing more,
1961.88s: but we're producing quite a bit. The oil companies have really been doing a lot.
1969.00s: Of course, China was down and wasn't demanding oil. I had a conversation this week or there was a
1976.04s: stream of conversation on my feed about the EVs in China. I focused US so I don't pay much
1984.60s: but I guess they've made huge inroads over there in terms of switching over to ED.
1991.88s: They're demand for oil has been going down for that reason, but it's also going down because
1995.88s: there economy has been tanking. They're doing far less in heavy industry, etc.
2005.00s: Pull them back from all that stuff, China wind inflation out and all that. Now they've started
2010.60s: going the other way because it was hitting the real estate so hard. All of that I think is,
2017.88s: China's a dominant player in the oil markets and just didn't have the demand.
2025.08s: To my credit, I wasn't focused on China so much, but globally I said there's a lot more oil in the
2033.16s: world versus supply and people are versus demand and people are giving
2040.60s: accounts to. I think we are seeing that that's going to continue right into the global bust.
2048.92s: Ultimately, we have excess supply over demand and that's not going to change in the next year.
2056.20s: Got it. Another thing that's been really interesting is even the latest news with Google
2061.88s: talking about their entrance into nuclear power to help essentially power their AI and GPUs
2070.04s: required to run the AI. What are your thoughts on nuclear power?
2074.28s: Yeah, I think nuclear has to be part of the answer. I've been pretty vocal in saying,
2081.72s: which is part of my $500 oil call, is it's nice to talk about the alternative energy,
2088.20s: but we're nowhere near being able to replace fossil fuels in terms of what we're going to need.
2095.08s: And if you have what I fully expect, which is a goosing up of the next cycle,
2101.48s: as we print money like we've never printed before because of a free falling financial system
2107.48s: next year, global bust, if we see 20 trillion in new money in this country and proportionally
2114.28s: around the world, you're going to boost demand like you've never seen because it's also coinciding
2121.40s: with us reshoring and starting to go more industrial again, etc. The demand for oil is going to go
2128.36s: through the roof. The demand for energy is going to go through the roof and there's nothing
2134.60s: not going to be able to produce enough wind power or solar power to offset the need for energy.
2142.44s: So it goes right back to oil. And of course, oil takes many years to develop a new oil field.
2151.56s: And we've spent all this time forcing our oil companies to do less drilling and less searching.
2158.04s: And we're trying to move them away from it. You're going to have a goosing of demand in a very
2165.72s: short five-year time span and not the ability to produce supply to meet it and what gives it's price.
2176.60s: So that's a long way of saying we're going to have other alternatives and nuclear is one of them.
2181.96s: And the fortunate thing is the technology has progressed to the point where it'll be not the big
2189.56s: 20-year projects, but rather the smaller nuclear plants that they've got the technology that I think
2199.32s: the regulation is going to, particularly under Trump, is going to improve time wise so that you can
2205.88s: actually put those things in on a timely basis. So there's no question we're going to see more nuke.
2212.76s: What are your thoughts on gold? Gold's been hovering near highs essentially from the 26th of November,
2222.52s: trended sideways for a little bit, dipped down into like the 26th, 27th handle and now it's hitting highs.
2230.20s: Yeah, back, I guess it's probably several weeks now. I don't know whether it's a month, but certainly
2236.44s: in the last months, so weeks. I raised my target on gold. I had a $3,000 target, what I call pre-bust
2245.16s: target, meaning before next year's global bust and probably a first quarter, probably happened in
2251.72s: the first quarter. I had a 3,000 target and when gold was starting to push up against that,
2259.16s: been kind of consolidating in the 24 or 500 area. Around there, I said, I'm raising my target, so my
2266.92s: new target is 3,400. I think we could be there in the first quarter very much. I think that's likely.
2274.92s: So I'm very bullish gold here. You'll have pullbacks along the way as with every market. So
2282.20s: maybe it goes to $2,900 and pulls back 100 points or something, but I think we're on our way to
2288.84s: 3,400. Then in the bust, as with most assets, it's going to go down. So you might go
2297.64s: 3,400 back to the mid-20s, 25, 200, 200, 400. It might even go all the way back to 2,100
2305.40s: where it broke out from last year. That would be more than a 35% pullback I would. So
2319.00s: 35% to 40% pullback. I think that's possible in the bust. But big run up here,
2328.36s: correct. And then my target for end of this decade, early next is 20,000.
2335.64s: So there's a lot of side gold still to come.
2339.80s: And gotta talk about the catalyst there. It's having around 27, 12. So I assume it has everything
2349.24s: to do with your broader thesis. But what's the order of operations here? We have market melt-up,
2358.28s: then we're talking about gold starting to run. How does the relationship between these different
2362.52s: things work in terms of specifically the gold estimate? Yeah, I've been pretty consistently
2367.96s: saying for the last year or two that I felt the metals and the equity market would move up
2373.16s: together. And people would take me to task on my bearer. So I'll call because they go,
2377.96s: oil and gold always go up together. I go, no, they don't always go up together. And they're not
2381.64s: going to go up together. They obviously haven't. So I think, yeah, I think their coincidental, I think
2388.20s: you will see the equity market melt-up to 7,500. I think the S&P and I think gold, you'll see,
2396.20s: it's not a melt-up, it'll run to 3,400. And I have 75 on silver. So there's big runs I think in
2406.36s: metals and in the equity markets and in bonds. And what drives the gold market? I think it's a
2413.08s: weak dollar. The dollar's been counter-trying rally here for a while. I think that's pretty much
2419.32s: run its course. I would expect from this 103 in change to see the dollar down to certainly down
2426.84s: to the mid-90s and maybe 90 within the next three, four months, five months. And ultimately down to,
2434.84s: I had been saying 80, I've raised a little bit to 82 is my ultimate dollar target.
2441.88s: And that happens, could happen early in the bus storm before the bus, but given how far it has to come,
2447.80s: I wouldn't be surprised if the early part of the buster is still going down in the dollar.
2451.88s: In the bus, in the guts of the bus, the dollar can rally back to 120. People are going to
2458.12s: flee to safety around the world. The dollar will still get that flight safety trade.
2463.24s: But for the next six to nine months, I see the dollar heading straight down. That's probably the
2469.08s: biggest driver of gold is that weak dollar. And then lower interest rate certainly helps gold.
2478.76s: And fears of fetis and leading to inflation could be a part of the narrative. Like I said,
2486.04s: I'm worried about deflation, not inflation, but that doesn't mean the market won't worry about
2490.60s: inflation. And how does silver play along here? Because silver was interesting. It hit a high of
2496.84s: 33 and about a quarter, like the beginning of this month, end of last, I think. And it's been kind
2503.00s: of running a bit sideways here. It had a little bit of a pullback and then has been running sideways.
2507.16s: So yeah, curious how silver fits in. I expect, you know, and it could be momentarily, you know,
2513.96s: tomorrow, next week. I expect silver to have a child pay school, you know, I think it's starting
2522.36s: up here. It kind of had to pull back. I think it got ahead of itself a little bit this week.
2529.88s: But ultimately, it looks, I said yesterday, I think on Twitter, you know, we're there. Basically,
2535.56s: we're at that point where it's about to break above that 33 level that it's gotten to. And I think
2541.80s: you can probably see it up to mid 40s in the next, you know, certainly this year, maybe in the next
2549.48s: couple months. And then from there, you know, make keep going or may pull back for a little while
2557.64s: before, but ultimately 75. And I think so gold and silver, I think trade together with, as is normal
2564.52s: in bull markets, silver outpaces gold and metal market bull markets. So I think that's going to be the
2570.92s: case. The miners, I think, will will finally reward investors who have been very frustrated by the
2579.24s: fact that, you know, certainly gold's done very well. And and silver is up 90% from its lowest
2584.92s: of a couple of years ago. And yeah, you know, the miners have been languishing. So they're starting
2591.32s: to get a little more bid. And I think that's just going to accelerate from here.
2596.60s: What's the thought process in your perspective of people to choose silver over gold or gold over
2603.80s: silver? Do you think most people that are moving into the metals like this are splitting between the
2608.20s: metals? I want to understand from a broader perspective how you break those down in the
2612.52s: perceptions of people and how they use both of them. Yeah, simply put about certainly first of all,
2618.52s: gold is obviously more of a monetary metal. You know, it certainly is a lot of it is, you know,
2625.08s: world events a lot of it is the dollar a lot of it is, you know, some place where you can
2632.68s: get away from concerns about inflation, etc. Silver on the other hand has real
2639.16s: much more real cyclical exposure to, you know, solar panel markets and EV and lots of other things.
2649.72s: So there's more of a cyclical component to silver. But right now, I think there's plenty of
2656.04s: demand for silver cyclically and silver has that other component, which is it is poor man's gold.
2663.80s: So it's not it's not a pure monetary metal, but there are a lot of people that will run to
2669.16s: silver when gold's getting a little bit expensive. And you know, you get more bang through,
2674.04s: but it seems or you know, it's like it's like stocks, but see any able to buy more of it if you
2680.36s: can buy the 30 something and you know, golds at 2700. So, so but the simplest way to put it in terms
2690.68s: of as I see it anyway in terms of gold versus silver is that in gold markets, silver will help
2698.44s: pace gold typically. So that that gold silver ratio, which was up around 90, you know, year go or
2706.68s: whatever, should get down towards 40. If gold divided by silver gets down by gets down from 90 to
2716.20s: 40 that tells you silver's way outpacing gold, right? So in a bull market, you want to be probably
2723.00s: more heavily weighted silver. And then in the correction or when when we go through the pullbacks
2729.16s: in these metals, particularly during the bus, if you can only either one, I'd probably own gold, you know.
2737.08s: And then on the other side of the bus, they're both going to be sky rockets and you know,
2744.12s: it's personal preference as to where you want to be there, but silver will probably help pace.
2749.00s: Now, when we're thinking about this, the broader bust here though, do you like where do you think
2757.32s: the the transfer or I'm maybe projecting here, maybe the reason, but do you think maybe it's
2763.48s: the best way to phrase it? Do you think that there's a transfer of capital from equities into metals?
2769.08s: And if so, where's that relationship? When does that start to happen in droves?
2775.16s: Yeah, the biggest time in gold will silver probably hit much harder than gold in the bus. So gold,
2781.72s: gold will outpace equities during the bus. If if I'm calling for an 80% bear market in the stock market
2788.20s: in the US stock market and I say gold could drop back 35 to 40%. Obviously that's a much better
2797.32s: place to be than equities if you had to be somewhere. Silver on the other hand, if it goes 75,
2804.04s: it could easily come back to 30 or maybe even back into the low to mid 20s because it is so
2811.08s: cyclical. And if we go through a you know, worse economy, worse financial situation we've had in
2817.96s: POS World War II era, you're going to see big hits to things like silver. So silver is not something
2825.00s: that's going to protect you on the downside in a in a bus. The bigger story, which is I think what
2830.44s: you're really wanting to know is the post bus era when you know when we're coming out of that
2838.04s: bottom and the feds printed so much money, it is going to be a cycle where commodities with
2844.68s: commodities of all kinds will far outpace the equity markets. And it'll be a high inflation
2851.32s: environment ultimately it'll start out slow but but in the decade we could see 25% inflation.
2857.24s: I expect gold and silver to be leaders of the pack in terms of performance leaders,
2863.88s: outpacing almost everything else at the end. But during that commodity cycle,
2870.84s: you know you can have as I say if the market drops if stock market drops 80%. So let's say
2877.88s: I used to it was easier math when the SME might target with 7,000 and I'd say you can go down 80%
2883.72s: it's 1,400 but from 500 let's say it's 1,500 what it is. You can you can triple that number
2893.16s: and be a 4,500 or 5,000 and still be way short of that 7,500 cycle peak this year. And obviously my
2903.56s: numbers are just my guesses but so you can have a cyclical bull market that will never come close
2911.88s: to the peaks of this cycle. On the other hand gold and silver and copper and oil and ag commodities
2921.16s: are going to see highs many fold beyond anything they've ever seen before because it's going to be
2926.92s: driven by all that money it's going to be an inflation cycle and so natural gas natural gas might
2933.56s: get down to a dollar in the bust. Who knows where gas goes next cycle natural gas might be 40 or
2939.64s: 50 dollars. You know go from a dollar to 40 or 50 that's you know 40 or 50 times. You know gold going
2948.12s: from let's say 2500 to 20,000 you know that's a huge run silver going from let's say 20 to 500
2959.08s: is my target in the next cycle. So those things while pace oil will go from let's say 30 to 500
2967.08s: meanwhile you've got maybe you can have a couple of years where the equity market is still
2973.00s: you know it's not keeping pace with other things but I mean it's not going to be what the
2976.76s: commodities are through that whole cycle but for a couple of years it might be a pretty good place to be
2982.52s: but then what you're going to run into is the headwinds of higher rates. If interest rates can
2988.68s: and interest will track inflation. If inflation can go from deflation next year to 25 percent inflation by
2997.40s: let's say 2030 or 31 then interest rates are going to go from I have said I expect the 10 year
3005.48s: to be down to zero next year in the depths of the bust you could go from a zero 10 year to 15 or 20
3014.28s: percent 10 year by the you know early next decade. So so if you have interest rates doing that
3023.32s: that's a huge headwind for the stock market because P multiples are the inverse of rates you know
3031.08s: they move inversely to interest rates. So that's really what drilled the last 40 years as we had
3037.56s: interest rates go from high double digit nearly 80s down to you know almost you know below 1 percent
3044.92s: in 2020. So you had P multiples go from single digits to 25 or 30 and that's you know we're
3053.24s: going to have the reverse of that post bust because it's going to be a huge inflation cycle.
3059.24s: A curiosity I have with respect to the bust is normally when we see markets go through these
3064.20s: larger corrections even to bear markets extended bear markets normally there are still elements
3071.24s: of strength either in markets commodities somewhere do you see anything showing strength at all
3078.68s: during the bust or is this literally everything is coming down together just in different degrees.
3086.12s: Two things one treasuries if if I'm looking for a zero 10 percent in the bust and let's say it's
3093.48s: to 250 before the bust that's still big run up in the treasury between 250 to zero and short rates
3101.56s: will go below zero probably the long buy to pry get down to a quarter or a half so you got
3106.68s: that will be one asset that will not only not be going down but will be going up while everything's
3112.84s: falling apart. So that's the huge that's the number one asset in the bust in my opinion and why
3118.76s: because of the government guarantee because of the printing press as I say in 2030s when all collapses
3126.68s: they won't be sorry because you won't have government the government guarantee won't mean much
3130.60s: because the government will be bankrupt but in this because of the printing press I think you
3136.20s: can pretty much be assured that they'll honor all those treasuries. So the treasury is first and
3143.16s: foremost and the only other asset I come up with is the dollar and not from year but from that
3149.40s: 82 at the lows or wherever it goes to if it can go back up towards 120 you know you got you got
3156.44s: two appreciating assets and the rest of the asset structure whether it be private equity whether it be
3164.20s: you know leverage loans whether it be corporate bonds and particularly jump bonds whether it be
3170.04s: stock market whether it be commodities they're all going straight down so having having your money
3176.44s: and either an FDIC insured savings account or treasury bond or any treasury security any maturity
3187.32s: or the dollar those those about the only things that will I think protect you.
3193.00s: I see. Last question before we wrap up is obviously your thoughts are that we're in the
3199.08s: meltup now that's likely to hit a crescendo you know either towards the end of this year or Q1 next
3206.04s: what are some of the the warning signs as far as you can see now of when we're in the meltup
3212.76s: what does it look like when the meltup is slowing and starting to show cracks.
3217.88s: Yeah I think what you're going to have is an all-in mark so right now as I say
3223.48s: people are starting to raise just looking at Wall Street strategist for example they're starting
3229.96s: to raise targets you know you've seen a couple 6,000 numbers out there lately I was the only one
3237.00s: for two years I mean people thought I was crazy but now you're starting as you can get it closer
3242.36s: to it you're starting to see the numbers raise and so you know people are people who had targets of
3248.52s: 51 or 5,200 six months ago now are talking about 57 or 800 or maybe 6,000 for a couple
3257.40s: as we move along here you can see those targets raised you're going to start hearing more talk
3263.32s: about this has legs that it's you know it's not just into the end of the year that because of
3269.32s: the fact because we're starting a new easing cycle that this might run for a couple of years
3275.32s: or longer that's what will capture the the institutional investors attention is if they think this
3283.08s: isn't the end of something it's a beginning of something where they can they can discount the earnings
3289.08s: out a couple of years that are higher earnings out a couple of years and maybe even longer their
3295.88s: models will now be able to make sense of this where we are because they've been struggling with
3301.48s: the valuation and saying you know they're not much room left you know this thing is going to come
3306.28s: to an end here shortly and we don't want to be buying the top if they really believe this is
3311.16s: a start of something you'll see them ramp up and that's why I think you're going to see the whole
3315.72s: final move happened in two or three months or less and it sounds crazy to say you can go from
3321.96s: 5,958,5900 to 7,500 in you know between now and the end of the year except if if everybody comes to
3330.04s: the same conclusion that oh the fed you know the fed is actually really easing that the economy isn't
3338.36s: strong that there's a cycle ahead they'll act on that in a short period they're not going to
3345.08s: wait months to act on that so you can get you know you can get that parabolic final run
3351.72s: that now of course they're not going to be looking for a bus I'm looking for a bus they're
3355.88s: going to be thinking the cycle's just getting going well so what you'll be looking for from a
3362.04s: stock market standpoint is everybody being bullish everybody being all in everybody having that
3367.96s: bullish narrative that says this has legs and it can go for two years or three years
3374.44s: when when you hear people saying it's cold elox and you've got you know earnings are moving up
3380.60s: interest rates are moving down inflation's under control the fed did the right the fed manages
3386.76s: perfectly those are the pieces of the narrative that I think we'll tell you you're getting close to
3391.96s: the from a stock market standpoint from a looking for signals of the other side
3400.68s: it's going to be tricky because you know if we're up if we're up on stills it's you know
3408.60s: people aren't stupid out there if they see the signs of things are getting bad it won't be
3413.00s: up on stills but I think initially weaker economy slowing because I'm still in the camp that says
3421.32s: the recent strength is kind of a facade that basically yes we're getting a last run
3428.12s: it's over and things but there are cracks showing underneath and the labor isn't as strong as
3433.80s: those numbers indicate etc so I wouldn't be surprised in the next you know between now and the
3439.08s: end of year if we start getting some signs things are moving closer to recession or you know aren't as
3445.40s: strong as we thought at recessions looking more likely but that's not necessarily going to be
3451.08s: received bearishly because it means if that's going to have to get more aggressive so they'll
3456.36s: be great when when it turns into more bearish is when it turns out it's not a soft landing it's not
3462.92s: a mild recession it's oh wow things are really deteriorating fast we almost had that in July right
3469.48s: we had some numbers there that surprised us to the downside and it looked like it was speeding up
3474.92s: and then we got quite a breath again and we got you know a little more strength
3479.08s: eyes to expect before the end of the year it's going to go back the other way it'll be received
3483.48s: initially bullishly and it's only I think as we get into early next year where the number what
3489.56s: you'll be looking for is the numbers to start really accelerating to the downside whether it be
3494.04s: you know ISM numbers retail sales housing because I think homes are kind of getting a last to
3501.56s: rob because those that felt they missed it are getting reprieved because rates are coming down
3507.16s: mortgage rates are coming down but thereby almost too quickly because rates are going to come
3513.72s: further down but there won't be more buying power behind that because those that want to buy now
3519.72s: are kind of jumping the gun now and soon after this it's going to be you know there's more
3526.04s: inventory there's not another wave of buyers and also the house prices start slipping I think that
3533.16s: will be one of the early signs that you know the next year is not going to be what this year was
3538.12s: I see fascinating yeah it's really interesting to see the the meltup thesis and seeing how unfolds
3546.92s: so as always thank you for kind of sharing and walking through that with us before we wrap is
3552.28s: there anything else though that we didn't talk about that you want to hit on yeah the only thing
3557.32s: I would say just kind of furthering out to talk about the bust is people just have to remember the
3563.88s: the meltup seemed crazy at the time too and people you know fought it and fought it and fought it
3571.08s: until now now people were throwing around term meltup but you know for two years they really thought
3577.08s: I was crazy for thinking the market could do and like it's done the bust you know people want to
3585.00s: be able to see it they you know they they think now they're starting to question you know
3590.60s: isn't it possible your dad wrong in the bifurcise yeah it's certainly possible but my
3595.16s: my conviction is still high that that's where we're headed but don't expect that it's going to be
3600.12s: obvious that you know you as a retailer investor or even you as an institutional investor
3607.16s: not you but anybody you know that it if we're obvious we'd be we'd be acting on that now so it
3616.04s: it's not going to be obvious for a while yet don't don't use that as the sign that it's where
3621.16s: we're not going to have one because it'll all of a sudden show up but I think we've still got
3626.60s: between now and balance of this year for sure plenty of room for this thing to run and bust type
3634.04s: signals are just not going to be there fascinating David always absolute pleasure chat and thank you so
3640.92s: much for taking the time sharing a little bit about I don't know your thoughts your experience I
3645.96s: always appreciate that you're willing to go through the different questions that I have because it
3651.16s: helps I think a lot of people piece together this this broader picture because it's fascinating so
3656.44s: obviously people can get a hold of you on x I will throw a link to your profile just to make
3661.88s: sure that they're going to the right spot if they're interested and then you also have your
3665.16s: newsletter I presume and if they're interested in that they can DM you yeah I just I just put
3670.84s: my fourth quarter letter last week and as I said I raised my targets on S&P to 7500 and
3678.04s: SX 25,000 from 24 and then raised my you know gold target to 3,400 so that that is a letter that I
3690.52s: send out to subscribers so it's by subscription there's a cost to it if people have interest yeah
3695.88s: they can just direct message beyond x or twitter whatever you want to call it and I'll be glad to
3702.92s: give details and they can decide whether it's something they want to subscribe to. Yeah perfect so
3708.20s: then I'll have that in there is always David great hanging out thanks for sharing and we will see
3713.08s: you next time. Yeah great see you Eric and I think the you know two weeks from now we're gonna
3718.12s: we're gonna see some history made. We'll come forward to it one one way or the other.
