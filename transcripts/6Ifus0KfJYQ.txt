0.00s: What's up, outliers? Today, I'm going to show you exactly how I analyze the stock market
6.32s: to come up with a disposition. So this informs everything that I do to make sure that the
12.20s: individual positions I'm putting on make sense relative to what I think is going on in
17.92s: the big picture. So we're going to walk through three different levels that I like to look
22.88s: at. And then I'm going to give you specific tools that you can use to analyze the specific
27.60s: data points that I like to look at. So what's up, everyone? Eric here. We'll come back
32.08s: to the outliers. Let's get right in. So the first thing we're going to start with is kind
35.92s: of this approach to analyzing the stock market. You see that there's there's three levels.
40.48s: At the very top level, I need to understand a little bit about the economy, whether I'm
45.84s: trading really, really short time frames or much longer time frames. I still want to know
52.04s: what's going on. Now to be clear for shorter term time frames, I kind of care less about
57.56s: the much larger picture, but my trading typically spans multiple time frames. So I'm going
63.72s: to start with the economy. Then I'm going to rotate over to the stock market. This is where
68.76s: I'm looking at things at a bit of a higher level. And then I'll get down into individual
72.40s: stocks. So let's start with what this process looks like. How do we start with the economy?
76.80s: Well, I'm going to look at general production and productive indicators, both for the
83.40s: economy writ large, but for then individual contributors, us as consumers and as producers.
90.56s: So I'm going to look at things like GDP, which kind of summarizes a lot of that for us.
94.80s: Inflation metrics like CPI and PPI. I'm going to look at unemployment, FOMC stances on
101.52s: things FOMC right now is a lot more topical than it is sometimes. It's not always invoked
107.20s: and not all of these things matter the same over different periods of time. But I'm kind
111.52s: of starting zoomed out and then clicking in because knowing if we're in expanding or
117.40s: contracting economy, that's really important. Understanding the direction of inflation,
121.44s: so on and so forth. So I'm zooming you down into different metrics that kind of matter,
126.52s: but in descending order almost. So then after we get through kind of the broader government
131.96s: stuff, I want to start looking at production, so things like manufacturing and then also
137.60s: consumers. How are the consumers doing because they're going to consume what's been manufactured?
144.84s: They're going to be massive participants in things like the housing market. So this is how
150.12s: I visualize the broad market by starting with the economy. So how can we see all these
157.68s: different things? Well, there's a few tools at your disposal and most of them are free.
162.44s: So the first one I'll show you is from Fred. And this is a really great website that you can
168.52s: set up your own dashboards that look at the specific metrics you're interested in. So here I'm
175.72s: looking at the federal funds rate here. I'm looking at the consumers. So I'm looking at the
179.40s: linkancy rate on credit cards. I want to see single family residential mortgage chargeoffs
184.84s: or delinquency rates. Then I can look at chargeoffs based on businesses because people aren't paying
189.24s: their bills. I can look at personal savings consumption. Literally, whatever you want is in here.
194.68s: I look at broad sales. As you can tell, I look at things like GDP, unemployment, all of those metrics
200.28s: matter to me. You literally can build your own dashboard right here in Fred. It's completely free.
205.40s: So that's the first resource I would put in front of you for economic data. The other resource is
210.76s: also very cool. Within think or swim, you can come up here to the analyze tab, go to economic data,
217.88s: and they have a ton of stuff. A lot funny enough, they pull in from Fred. So you can come in here,
223.08s: you can look at the monetary data and you can say, well, I'm curious what M1 looks like. It'll give you
228.28s: all different kinds of variations to be clear. A lot of them are discontinued. So you have to pay
232.76s: attention to that, but a lot of them aren't. So you can see, okay, well, what's M1? Here it is.
237.16s: You can look at it across different time frames. So this right now is the max, but I could look over
241.32s: at the last five years, which wonder where COVID was. And you can tinker with this in a bunch of
248.20s: different ways, just like you can with the rest of your charge. So this is another really favorite
252.36s: place that I feel like is generally underutilized in think or swim. So next up, we have the stock market.
258.20s: How do I look at the stock market? There's a couple big steps. And again, it's in the same thought
263.24s: process as what I was sharing before. I'm going to look at the performance of the indices relative
268.20s: to one another. I'm going to look at breadth indicators like net highs lows, tick trend.
273.64s: Then I want to look at individual sectors and see how they're performing. I want to understand
278.68s: what earnings trends are going on. What does volatility look like? And then I want to even get
284.44s: down into the correlations and broader themes that I see happening in the stock market. So today,
290.52s: some of the bigger themes I see going on are we care a lot about inflation, which is highly impacted
297.88s: by all of these different kinds of production metrics and efficiency metrics, how well we're
302.92s: doing as an economy. That's in laser focus right now. From a stock market perspective, I like to
308.84s: start by looking at a grid of charts. So here, you've seen this before in my videos. And this is
315.40s: where I just take a look at the broad indices. So this is looking at spy cues, I WM. A lot of times
321.96s: I like to use the futures, but a lot of people resonate with these more. So I just leave them up,
326.28s: because they're equally easy to look at. So the spy is S&P 500. The cues is technically not
332.44s: just tech, but it's very tech dominated. I WM is 2000 plus small cap stocks. Then I have other
339.72s: breadth indicators like this is the percentage of S&P 500 stocks above their 50 period moving average.
347.32s: Here I have bonds. Sometimes this will switch between bonds and crypto currencies. And then here,
352.52s: I have volatility. So when I'm looking at this, I'm looking at all sorts of things. I want to know
356.68s: how they look in relation to one another. Like, for example, I WM had a really outsized move today,
362.52s: but it's been lagging compared to both the cues and spy spy is knocking right at the door
369.32s: of near term highs, whereas cues still has some ways to go. So tech is lagging a little bit.
375.32s: Then other tools I like to use are net highs lows. So this one down here is for the New York Stock
380.36s: Exchange kind of broader. This over here is for the NASDAQ Exchange. Again, you'll get a little
385.56s: more tech skew in here. So I use all of these tools starting from the top economy, then clicking down
392.60s: into the individual indices themselves. See how they're moving by themselves, but then also in relation
400.52s: to one another. So this is a three month chart. I also like to zoom these out. Take a look at a six month
406.92s: chart and see what the overall trend has been, especially if I see all the trends are aligned.
411.88s: Sometimes I'll click in a little bit and say, okay, well, how has this actually looked over a long
416.36s: term time frame like this right here? Notice that difference. On a six month time frame,
420.36s: the standard deviation channels are negative sloping. But then if I click into a three month time frame,
425.80s: I actually see them ascending. So it tells me that there's a level of recovery going on right now.
431.64s: So by tinkering with different time frames, it gives me different visualizations. The other
436.04s: thing I like to look at is volume. And there's also an average volume line here that's for the past
441.88s: 20 trading days last month, essentially. And I want to see is volume picking up on the down moves
447.96s: is volume picking up on the up moves is volume expanding, contracting all of these different
453.64s: data points feed in to what I'm looking at. Then I can use other tools like this next grid,
461.16s: which lets me look at all of the individual sectors within the S&P 500. So I can see how the S&P
467.32s: 500 is doing here by itself. And then I can take a look at all of the component sectors and see
474.52s: what sectors are doing well, what sectors are not doing well. So like in this case, I can see
478.84s: XLK, which is technology is actually running negative compared to a lot of other things. And XLB
485.64s: kind of builders, they're running about sideways, but real estate has been on a tear over the last
491.32s: three months. And then again, sometimes I will come in here and change the time frame to be
495.96s: slightly longer term for me. Three months is about my sweet spot for what I tend to trade and care
501.16s: about, but giving you some ideas on what to look like. The other thing that I want to bring up is
507.00s: using other tools to summarize stuff like what's going on with current earnings are companies
513.80s: beating or they not beating chat GPT is great for this. And then themes and trends, this is what
519.56s: lets me kind of come up with broader ideas like for example, one of the themes I see right now is
524.44s: real estate is been on a tear relative to tech. And tech has been slowing down. So that's just a theme.
532.20s: And maybe when I'm coming up with different trade ideas that will feed into what I'm looking for.
536.52s: And then the last part of analyzing the stock market we come down to the individual stocks,
540.36s: which is super simple looking at technical analysis and fundamental analysis. I have a video down
545.48s: below that goes into technical analysis for stocks. It runs through them in detail. But if you
550.68s: guys are interested in another video that walks through analyzing stocks specifically happy to do
555.80s: it. Just let me know in the comments. As always, any questions? Let me know be an outlier. I'll see you guys
561.40s: later.
