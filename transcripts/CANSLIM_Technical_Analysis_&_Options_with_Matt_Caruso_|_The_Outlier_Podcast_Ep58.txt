2.32s: what's up Matt welcome back thanks for
4.72s: thanks for having me Eric yeah beautiful
6.60s: so I had to do a quick intro because we
8.12s: were just talking about Freddy Krueger
9.72s: because you're wearing the Blue version
11.60s: of his sweatshirt but you were saying
13.44s: you don't really watch horror movies I
15.72s: need at least the audience members to
17.76s: vouch for me here and make sure that
20.00s: they at least can validate my perception
23.16s: but we were just talking about we don't
25.24s: actually know how he what his thing is
28.00s: cuz I always thought it's like he kills
29.24s: people in their sleep I don't really
30.40s: know how that works though I I didn't
32.92s: see the movies but uh all I know is I'm
35.52s: happy to keep you on your toes you know
36.92s: I have to make sure that you're not you
38.56s: know as a former Marine I got to be able
40.16s: to also guard my six I I tell you what
43.12s: man like I've never done the little Zin
46.68s: nicotine pouches but I'm thinking about
48.76s: it so that there's 0% chance that I even
51.08s: like blink too long for you to creep my
53.44s: dreams and and murder me but um you know
56.88s: it's always good to see you man welcome
58.52s: back on thanks thanks for driv me it's
60.32s: always always fun that to chat that's
61.72s: for sure yeah yeah I bet that is the
63.96s: case cuz I feel like you are a really
66.84s: great example of kind of like the a
68.60s: professional and I am the example of a
71.76s:  degenerate so it is always good
74.20s: to get those two at least in the same
76.60s: proximity as one another but talk to me
79.00s: a little bit about your 2023 we haven't
81.76s: talked for a minute and I found last
84.96s: year yeah last year was fascinating for
87.20s: me in a lot of different ways but this
89.00s: ain't about me I'm curious what it
91.04s: looked like for you so for me it was an
93.96s: interesting year uh so I'm I'm an active
96.44s: guy but I try and build up position so
98.96s: I'm looking for those Trends 2023 if you
101.16s: look outside of QQQ there weren't a lot
104.00s: of Trends but I was I was fair I was
106.04s: fairly active and I think I my timing
108.52s: was pretty good I mean I was very
110.36s: aggressive coming into 23 year end there
112.96s: was there was it's funny like there's
114.52s: every part of your system if there's any
116.00s: kind of weak point the market will you
117.92s: know uh bring it out and for me one
120.44s: thing is is I I would have had a a very
122.36s: good year but I there was two earnings
124.36s: reports I was heavily invested in was
126.08s: Shopify and going into February of last
128.36s: year which a gap down and fell 25 30%
131.04s: and smci which frustratingly is now the
134.16s: hottest stock in the market which I had
135.84s: a monster position going into earnings
138.40s: last August which like really tagged me
140.80s: out of that and so as but I mean the
143.64s: good the good thing is if if you can
144.76s: kind of learn from it and I've put
146.08s: together different hedging strategies to
147.52s: help me survive those these massive
149.20s: earnings reports so that kind of like
151.12s: instead of it being a phenomenal 2023
153.16s: was like ah mediocre 2023 but
156.96s: uh that is so frustrating on smci I was
160.52s: just looking at it today and I had a a
163.44s: ratio called diagonal in it and this is
166.40s: one of the few instances where I trade a
169.56s: larger account so I'm not like typically
171.32s: super concerned about utilization but I
173.64s: was like I was like bro it's like a $600
175.96s: stock like I'm actually kind of happy to
177.60s: be using options for leverage here
179.28s: because if you want to scoop up a few
181.44s: like few hundred shares you're like
183.16s: starting to get into decent sizing for
186.20s: just just Equity outright but what um
191.28s: what was the thesis in smci and then was
194.84s: it just the earnings that got you taken
196.36s: out because that actually this is a
197.48s: frustrating this is a frustrating thing
198.96s: right so like the whole thesis I built
200.68s: out is what's playing out now and it's
202.52s: like now you see the stock more than
203.88s: doubled and you hear the same stuff
205.20s: being echoed back to you you're like
206.68s: yeah but uh so really I mean basically
209.52s: the issue is earnings reports the
211.20s: reactions have become pretty insane I
213.80s: mean even meta I mean meta's a I mean
216.24s: massive one of the world's largest
217.40s: companies up 20% on earnings like the
219.08s: moves have become so surreal I mean I
221.56s: like when I started off trading I mean
223.04s: earnings were always something but they
224.52s: weren't a big deal single digit moves
226.68s: percentage wise now these 20 30% so I
228.80s: mean I had a good cost basis going to
230.68s: the last earnings I think my cost was
232.28s: like 240 something earnings the stock
234.60s: was maybe 340 pre- earnings and they
236.68s: like knock that thing down back to 230
238.88s: and and I had size in there like I that
240.48s: was like a big part of my portfolio so
243.12s: you know you head on out Risk Management
245.44s: try and uh you know take a few dollars
247.56s: out of it at the least it's such a
248.80s: sizable reversal and now a few months
250.84s: later it's it's rocking and rolling but
252.28s: it's I mean that's that's the game right
253.48s: you're always constantly learning so so
256.44s: what what was the exit decision was it
258.64s: like right after earnings and you were
260.28s: like okay yeah so when that that broke
261.96s: badly so that broke down see like two so
263.84s: like same day was massive drop getting
266.52s: almost like a cost basis so I mean like
269.16s: I have like
270.36s: I think every Trader has a rule where if
271.80s: you're making really good money on a
273.00s: stock the last thing you want to do is
274.28s: that end up with a loss on it so as it
276.52s: kind of approached like a break even I
278.04s: was out of it I mean and look I mean by
280.40s: what was that October this was even
282.04s: lower out to 226 I mean at a certain
284.48s: point you have to call call it a day and
287.04s: and now from here we kind of went
288.20s: vertical so I mean that's the market
289.92s: right it's always gonna keep you on your
290.80s: toes isn't that something where like the
293.08s: move from where my mouse is now to hear
296.56s: is from 260 to 220 but it looks like
299.20s: nothing because of the it's not a log
301.48s: chart so just that move there 40 points
304.32s: or whatever it looks like nothing but to
306.44s: your point that is a meaningful move
308.60s: especially with where your basis was and
310.76s: you know like you're talking about at at
312.16s: the size that you were were you looking
313.76s: at a re-entry in this or not I was I I I
317.88s: you know touched it a couple of times
319.32s: but I mean this is had had a lot of
321.20s: volatility to it I mean the the sides of
323.20s: the ranges of the bars were were sizable
325.44s: there were a lot of kind of fake type
327.04s: moves that never really went anywhere
329.32s: and really I mean it start it was
331.32s: lagging the market too I mean coming out
332.80s: of October a lot of stocks were moving a
335.20s: lot hotter than smci so I mean that's
338.48s: the market right it'll pivot sometimes
340.12s: but you know I always try and like I
341.64s: think to be a Trader professionally you
343.48s: have to be an optimist even if you you
345.24s: know although most guys will become
346.76s: cynical when they trade long enough I
348.68s: think though if you want to keep it
349.80s: going you have to always have that spin
351.04s: of like okay like let me at least take
352.92s: away some kind of lesson from this so
354.76s: since then I've been putting in
356.68s: different types of hedging strategies
358.08s: around um earnings to kind of not go
360.80s: through that same experience again I
362.92s: mean even even know the novice will say
365.00s: well at least hey you didn't lose money
366.08s: on the deal but that that doesn't factor
368.36s: in the emotional drain of of having you
370.80s: know a big position I think it was like
372.44s: a 40 50% account position being up
375.08s: nicely from you know 240 to 350 then to
378.28s: suddenly five minutes later be back at
380.40s: Cost it's like oh that's it's
381.88s: frustrating so you know
383.72s: live well and you also bring up a funny
385.84s: point about the novice Traders because
387.52s: what one of the I was I just did a not
389.76s: too long ago it's not out yet but it it
391.44s: talks about some of these different like
393.32s: I call it the the outlier mindset right
394.88s: we're on the outlier podcast what one of
396.52s: the big things I try to talk to people
397.80s: about is like changing your perspective
399.48s: because like you said a lot of beginners
401.20s: they would look at it as oh you didn't
402.32s: lose money well that's not what pays the
404.76s: bills not losing money is not what makes
407.12s: money like you need to make money
408.84s: trading so I totally totally understand
411.52s: the way you were looking at that cuz
412.60s: it's yeah that's you still made some
414.16s: money but just an annoying move to go
416.36s: through now another like question I had
419.68s: and wanted to get your perspective on
421.16s: specifically with this I mean this seems
424.72s: for like a $300 stock to double over the
428.44s: course of what is this actually it's
430.64s: like week half two weeks yeah yeah like
434.44s: what what what benchmarks do you have
436.52s: for that CU I know that you look at big
438.28s: moves and that's a big part of your
440.16s: system but like
443.04s: how how anomalous is this kind of move
446.28s: at least based on your broader
448.32s: perspective
450.04s: well you know that's the thing you know
452.24s: uh the the amazing thing about stocks is
455.12s: it's the stock that's probably already
457.00s: showed you some kind of extreme strength
459.24s: that's likely to show it to you again in
460.68s: the future so again that again that's
462.52s: another kind of you know that fallacy
463.64s: people look for the stocks that are
464.72s: really beat down to you know to and and
466.48s: obviously you look in retrospect you can
468.00s: look at stocks that took big losses that
470.24s: then will come back and say oh big
471.60s: percentage gain but it's a probability
473.52s: thing if you really want to find a stock
475.08s: that's gonna have a big move it's
476.16s: probably already had a big leg somewhere
478.68s: before so it's not surprising to see
480.84s: that kind of a move uh because you know
482.88s: to cause that first move especially if
484.80s: it's a stock of of a decent market cap
487.32s: they have to be on to some kind of new
489.12s: trend some kind of major Improvement and
492.28s: that usually it comes from a Technology
493.80s: stock unless it's something that has
495.68s: some kind of a supply shock like in the
497.40s: commodity market so I'm not surprised to
499.76s: see it kind of catch up because really
501.48s: what happened here was this was somewhat
503.76s: of a sleepy business uh which was you
506.12s: know servers and racks where you know
508.44s: it's being trans form there's massive
510.28s: new capex coming in and management
513.24s: different managements have different
514.24s: styles they're the kind of management
515.52s: where they really kind of under promise
516.76s: and overd deliver sometimes they overdo
519.24s: that under promise and overd deliver and
520.68s: they scare markets like what they did on
522.20s: that call last summer and then when they
524.36s: finally deliver it like they did now you
525.84s: get this this massive move so you know
528.80s: it's a matter of I think a lot of times
530.52s: management trying to manage expectations
533.48s: and I think alos play a big part moves
536.68s: are far more extreme than they used to
538.36s: be even in the short term I like I
540.32s: always call like Alo gone wild you know
542.04s: there there's some really dramatic move
544.12s: sometimes and and that's where you see
545.64s: these things so I'm not I'm not
546.68s: surprised to see the move happen wish I
548.56s: would have caught it the second time
549.60s: around but um that's what it is yeah
552.76s: that's interesting yeah because I mean
554.36s: to your point and I know a lot of the
555.68s: stuff that you look at will will show
557.56s: big moves like this the part that really
559.12s: just blew me away is something that goes
560.84s: from 300 bucks to 600 bucks in yeah two
566.04s: weeks that that just seems wild to me on
569.64s: such a big company cuz I know a big part
571.40s: of the the canslim methodology typically
573.64s: is looking for smaller companies that
576.44s: more prone to have big legs
579.72s: but what do you think of something like
582.92s: this that's now up you know just near
585.32s: nose blade levels right like typically
587.20s: you want to look for strength you're
588.76s: seeing strength but now it presumably
592.24s: this would be a higher risk entry by a
593.72s: long shot yeah so how do you view stuff
596.52s: like this yeah you know it's like you
598.72s: need to manage so many things at once I
600.52s: think that's where people have a hard
601.80s: time because like what we do like even
603.88s: yourself Eric like you know some people
605.00s: say like you Benchmark against the
606.20s: NASDAQ or the Russell or Arc or you know
608.40s: what when you're actively managing like
611.00s: that you're not always fully invested
612.88s: there's you're really kind of running a
614.24s: business it's not really something
615.76s: you're benchmarking you're not just
617.72s: having this constant portfolio so you
620.04s: know it really comes down to probability
621.60s: it's it's not easy to find stocks that
623.24s: are going to have this kind of move so I
624.64s: mean you're going to have a lot of
625.60s: failure in your attempts to try and find
627.56s: this kind of move or not just failure
629.16s: like you know smaller returns stocks
630.48s: that have a good return but are not the
632.28s: outstanding ones and so you know if
634.60s: you're taking these different shots like
636.00s: you always have to have that risk
637.12s: management in mind because I mean you
638.48s: don't have unlimited capital and and if
640.36s: you want a meaningful impact on your
641.96s: portfolio if you want size you need to
644.32s: control that risk I mean so you know if
646.44s: you think a stock has a chance of
647.64s: doubling but there's you know a 10%
649.88s: chance of that happening that's your
651.88s: expected return so you know you have to
653.36s: factor in what kind of risk am I going
654.88s: to take on and up that the risk reward
657.16s: is just not great anymore so a lot of
658.52s: times it's it's kind of you have to walk
660.20s: that fine line between which dos have
662.24s: all the upside potential but then that
664.28s: restraint for I need to at least find a
666.40s: a place where I'm going to be adequately
668.12s: re rewarded for the risk I'm taking on
669.96s: so you have to have those two balancing
671.80s: forces all the time kind of going uh
673.80s: within your mind it's and the reason why
676.44s: I ask you that specifically because it's
679.12s: something that I see all the time where
682.36s: at least a lot of people in my community
684.48s: they commit what I consider to be it's
687.68s: not like a big sin
689.68s: but they miss out on a lot of stuff CU
691.80s: they're waiting for too much
693.04s: confirmation they're waiting for like
696.00s: the the clearest trending move and then
698.84s: what I try to explain if we're trading
700.40s: directionally even with options in those
702.64s: kinds of instances you're you're just
704.40s: increasing the risk you're taking
706.32s: because you need to give something a
707.96s: little bit of room to move if you've had
709.52s: a really strong consolidation period you
711.76s: now have a pretty clear snapshot on how
713.68s: you can manage your risk around that
714.84s: kind of spot and then if you start to
717.04s: see this breakout and you're late to
718.96s: trading it like too late now all of a
721.08s: sudden the base is still down here so
723.48s: you have to either have a really low
726.08s: expectation that the trade will work out
727.48s: but if it does might be a great win what
730.28s: do you think about putting on positions
732.60s: like that cuz like you're were talking
733.60s: about in this instance it was a big part
735.32s: of your portfolio so then is your
738.40s: approach in that instance the remainder
740.84s: of your
741.84s: portfolio you also have that super
744.44s: concentrated or is it that you have this
746.56s: one really speculative concentrated
748.68s: position
749.40s: and then you have the rest of it into
751.32s: other things cash whatever to try to
752.96s: balance some of it off did you ever read
755.52s: the book uh reminisces of a stock
757.20s: operator I'm assuming you did yeah y so
759.44s: so my my Approach really it's funny
761.44s: because I at one point I thought I had a
763.36s: stroke of Genius that I had like
764.92s: invented a way of like building into
766.56s: positions and then after I was rereading
768.56s: that book I'm like oh I just kind of
770.00s: ripped off Jesse Livermore in this
771.32s: chapter when he was talking about so
773.08s: there's one chapter where he talks about
774.60s: he's looking I think at like wheat and
776.08s: corn or something like that he puts a
777.60s: position on both and like wheat keeps
780.08s: going up and he keeps like adding to it
781.68s: progressively and getting a big position
783.60s: corn never moves he never adds to it and
785.48s: he ends up selling it for like a small
787.00s: loss and the wheat's this major winner
789.08s: so for me like so some people I think
790.68s: will misunderstand saying oh yeah this
791.92s: big position you must be gambling like
793.44s: I'm incredibly risk averse like I hate
795.88s: risk and and the reason is is like I was
798.12s: a market maker for years and I used to
799.52s: trade a lot of these Miners and stuff
800.76s: where they love to raise money and so so
802.80s: many times you see this like big update
804.44s: and if you say like oh it's a breakout
806.04s: and you bought it like that night at
807.92s: like 405 financing and it's 10% lower
810.60s: and so you're getting slamed so I I got
812.84s: so used to having to work around like
814.84s: possible like overnight gaps and event
817.00s: risk like if I'm going to get a
818.12s: concentrated position it's and it take
819.32s: me time and I have to build it with PE
821.68s: with profit so I have that profit
823.24s: cushion building to protect my original
825.08s: capital and so it takes time to get
828.16s: concentrated positions if it's a great
830.20s: Market can I have three or four
832.60s: concentrated positions going at once
834.16s: sure but it's kind of like what the
835.88s: market gives to me so like last year for
837.52s: example when I had smci last summer was
839.56s: a bit of a thinner Market there weren't
841.12s: as many great movers so that was like my
843.92s: concentrated positions of that moment
846.28s: other times I have a few more going on
848.52s: but it's like I don't start off saying
850.64s: I'm buying four stocks I'm putting
852.00s: massive size and let's see what happens
853.64s: it's really like what the market gives
855.00s: me got it so then in the example of smci
859.24s: the way that I typically break out
860.88s: trades at least mentally is I have what
862.76s: I call an allocation so upfront I
866.08s: typically determine how much of my
867.64s: portfolio does that trade get and then I
870.08s: have two other metrics I have the
871.72s: initial outlay so of that total
874.12s: allocation how much am I giving it up
875.92s: front and then I have scaling So based
878.12s: on whether it's certain dollar moves
879.80s: whatever the case is how much am I
881.24s: adding in different
882.56s: frequencies what's your approach in an
885.00s: instance like this with
886.52s: smci yeah so like I usually start around
889.24s: 10% of the portfolio my aim is to scale
892.12s: things to the 30 to 50% range that's
894.20s: where I feel comfortable like have I
895.64s: I've gone above that but then like I'm
897.96s: personally getting out of my you know
899.24s: like when you're pushing your own
900.20s: personal comfort zone you know it's like
901.64s: like I I get above sometimes it's rare
903.68s: but I'm I know I'm kind of pushing it
905.56s: and it better be working if it doesn't
907.20s: I'll scale back quickly but that's kind
909.00s: of the range that works I mean some
910.24s: people like their heads explode explode
912.20s: thing of that kind of concentration but
914.16s: if you do it carefully like by the time
916.04s: you're getting to a 30 40% concentration
918.52s: you're already up like 10% on the
921.44s: average cost basis so I mean you're
924.04s: protected against a random overnight gap
926.32s: down or bad news or downgrade or some
928.36s: kind of situation like that so there's
930.08s: ways to kind of still work around it but
932.64s: you know those really outsize Returns
934.92s: come when you get a a good Trend you get
937.52s: an early you get that concentration it
939.20s: it takes that effort to really bring it
940.68s: all together but when it works it's it's
942.16s: like it's fireworks you know but it
943.92s: takes that effort that diligence to get
945.88s: to that point yeah and I think for a lot
948.60s: of Traders they're always fed the you
950.80s: know individual position should never be
952.40s: more than 8% of your account or whatever
954.32s: the case is right they just throw out a
955.96s: random
956.92s: number when you look at building these
959.68s: positions though you've found that if
961.80s: you want to get big moves you have to
963.72s: add the size so how do you think people
966.04s: can make that mental leap from where
968.00s: they're given this really in my opinion
971.36s: extremely risk averse and then trying to
974.56s: get to a point where you can actually
975.60s: make like meaningful money on moves
977.28s: provided that you're still controlling
978.92s: your risk on the bigger positions how do
980.96s: people make that jump you know so I I
983.20s: think there's like you have to make
984.48s: different ground rules I think for
985.96s: everyone it's going to be different
986.88s: numbers some people could be even more
988.52s: more aggressive than me some people are
989.56s: incredibly averse so you have to first
991.52s: you have to kind of come to terms with
993.24s: what works for you like there's like
994.80s: really what's your maximum for some
996.20s: people it'll be 50% some people will be
998.48s: 10% of a portfolio that's the max they
1000.24s: can accept but so there's two tricks
1002.20s: that kind of work for me one was it was
1004.72s: years ago I was in a slump I think it
1006.28s: was 2011 I I had a great 2010 and that's
1009.28s: another kind of pattern I noticed after
1011.36s: my really big years the next year tends
1013.00s: to kind of not be so good uh because you
1015.52s: get sloppy and stuff like that but I
1016.92s: remember 20111 keep humble
1019.12s: yeah yeah the market will keep you
1020.48s: humble my friend but I was in a slump
1022.48s: and I remember I was sitting next to a
1023.96s: guy so I was the youngest guy on the
1025.04s: desk next to me was kind of the oldest
1026.28s: guy on the desk and it's almost like you
1028.44s: know you're you're at that point where
1029.64s: every time you touch the mouse you lose
1030.88s: money like it's like almost like you
1032.60s: know you're just scared to to put a
1033.92s: trade on and he's like Matt I don't care
1036.08s: he's like you figure out what's an
1037.72s: amount of money that's not going to
1038.76s: bother you to lose and you just keep
1040.12s: trading with that amount until you get
1041.88s: back your groove and so that's kind of
1043.48s: where I started the Dollar Stop concept
1045.20s: so for every trade and you know as my
1047.28s: account moves I'll adjust
1048.92s: every few months but there's a maximum
1051.24s: dollar amount that I'll lose on a trade
1053.32s: now I like although it's kind of based
1054.96s: on percentages but our returns work in
1058.12s: percentages but our our our gut works
1060.40s: with dollars you know we live in dollars
1061.88s: you know how much it takes to buy a car
1063.32s: how much it you know takes to go out for
1064.64s: supper so at the end of the day that the
1067.08s: dollar loss is going to hurt you
1068.44s: probably more than the percentages
1069.64s: that's more like the industry things we
1071.28s: watch so when I set that dollar stop it
1074.76s: kind of created this level of comfort
1076.56s: where like okay I can put on my trade I
1078.68s: know what I'm going to lose I can live
1080.08s: with that and it created this like
1081.92s: openness of this you know this this
1084.44s: feeling of being able to kind of go out
1086.60s: there and not worry about am I going to
1088.36s: screw this up that's my Max loss if I
1090.12s: get there I'll get out and I'll reassess
1091.68s: it took off a lot of pressure and a
1093.48s: second kind of tool that helped me was I
1096.36s: would then after kind of we tend to
1098.68s: circumvent our own kind of uh safety
1101.08s: features would be like okay that's
1102.96s: that's my my maximum dollar risk so I'll
1105.00s: put on a bunch of Trades really quickly
1107.20s: you know one after another you end up
1108.68s: building all this size and then you
1110.04s: still have this this risk if there's a
1111.64s: gap down because you you put on all
1113.64s: these trades but they're all right next
1114.76s: to each other so basically I have so
1116.44s: much I'll lose on a trade and then I
1118.48s: want my stocks to go up at least by four
1120.08s: or five percent before I add to them
1121.96s: just to prevent myself from kind of
1123.88s: constantly adding in the same range
1125.68s: without any kind of real profit cushion
1127.40s: so if I have a maximum loss and I need
1129.56s: at least some kind of a gain before I
1131.00s: add everything's got to be going my way
1133.08s: before I'm I'm getting concentrated so
1134.76s: that's my way of of being safe and
1136.56s: getting concentrated yeah I love that
1138.80s: and then how do you view adding is there
1141.00s: a certain amount of you start with maybe
1143.24s: 10% of the portfolio like you're saying
1145.76s: how do you view when you get that four
1147.72s: to 5% move what's your thoughts on
1150.12s: adding there I try and do another I try
1152.48s: and do similar size I try and be
1154.00s: consistent I mean like I won't you know
1156.24s: if the stock gets too extended from a
1157.60s: base I'll just let it go at that point
1159.12s: but I try and start near basing
1161.80s: structure so I have a good kind of
1163.04s: foundation where if it does ultimately
1164.68s: break away I'm already nicely
1166.60s: concentrated like I hate sometimes like
1168.44s: have a position in in Palo Alto like uh
1171.40s: I wish I had more sometimes they just
1172.96s: kind of get going and you don't get your
1174.24s: position and it sucks to see a nice
1176.20s: winner and you're like oh I have like a
1178.04s: third of what I really wanted in there
1179.44s: so never has the same kind of meaningful
1181.04s: impact but uh I try and be consistent
1183.24s: with my U my position
1185.12s: sizing yeah well I think the idea of
1187.88s: consistency of position sizing it gives
1189.48s: you a known good because I think if if
1192.64s: you don't do that especially with
1194.72s: options when you're dealing with kind of
1196.32s: two different sets of values you have
1198.00s: the premium of an option and then you
1199.52s: have the notional value of whatever it
1200.84s: is you're controlling but if it's yeah
1204.28s: kind of a crapshoot I've always found
1205.80s: that to be impossible then to project a
1208.12s: system forward to even have any
1210.20s: confidence in the the perspective return
1212.40s: for it so
1215.12s: 2023 was obviously then a lackluster
1219.72s: kind of boring year for youh coming into
1222.76s: 2024 what were your original
1225.36s: expectations and how have they panned
1227.80s: out so far so things have kind of gone
1230.72s: similar to what I expected for me the
1232.68s: biggest frustration I think is I think a
1235.28s: lot of probably active professionals
1237.32s: will feel it it's just the QQQ is so
1239.20s: strong because there's a small group
1240.68s: that that so it makes it it kind of
1242.40s: makes everyone who's an active manager
1244.16s: who's not keeping up with like the top
1246.24s: five names look like a loser you say ah
1248.28s: look what they but it's an abnormal
1250.04s: Market in a sense like I've never seen
1252.40s: the QQQ do that but the Russell 2000 be
1254.72s: stuck in a bare Market not that you
1255.92s: should be in the Russell 2000 but most
1257.44s: stocks probably fall in between so it's
1259.20s: a bit of a a frustration in that sense
1261.24s: but it's played out as as I expected I
1262.76s: had a good end of year like a good push
1264.60s: into the end of the year coming into the
1267.08s: um into the start of the year I I the
1269.60s: markets were frothy there's some other
1271.36s: tools I look at to get a sense if the
1272.88s: markets are frothy or not so I bought a
1274.68s: lot of protective puts I was going away
1275.92s: on vacation I said look number one the
1277.64s: Market's frothy I'm going to be on the
1278.96s: beach I don't want to have to be
1280.04s: attached to my phone so I bought a lot
1281.76s: of protective puts I even bought some
1283.08s: out- of- the- money puts so I could be
1284.36s: aggressive if things did fall so that
1286.24s: all worked out very well um obviously
1289.72s: you know there's the cost of those puts
1291.24s: there's a bit of like a draw on
1292.64s: performance for that respect but it
1294.64s: allowed me to keep a lot of my positions
1296.32s: which I'm still not positioning we're
1297.52s: going to earning season with protection
1299.24s: so at least the profits finance that
1301.40s: protection we'll see how that ultimately
1302.92s: plays out so if I wouldn't have been
1305.08s: protected some stocks took some sizable
1306.68s: drops which I was kind of without
1308.40s: protection would have been a painful
1309.88s: start to the year so I was able to work
1311.60s: that each year I pick a new focus of
1313.92s: what I want to really specialize on and
1316.44s: improve this year was Equity curve
1318.72s: management and so that's kind of I'm
1320.20s: running some new like hedging ideas and
1322.32s: so so far so far so good because I you
1324.92s: know if you're looking outside of QQQ a
1328.20s: lot of stocks took some I mean Arc
1329.56s: innovation's down like what 13 14% in
1331.96s: the first month you know I think
1333.08s: Russell's down 8% depending where you
1335.32s: were standing it was a very different
1336.72s: January and uh so for a guy where my
1338.96s: preference is not usually you know two
1341.04s: trillion dollar companies you're looking
1342.44s: for Innovative growth it could have been
1344.80s: very damaging so I was I was happy with
1346.56s: the hedges
1348.48s: yeah and it's good that you bring up the
1350.32s: the cost of those Hedges because the way
1353.36s: that you're thinking about hedging
1354.76s: obviously is as a professional where a
1357.20s: lot of people that I find think about
1358.84s: hedging they want to hedge because they
1361.12s: just don't like seeing red it's a it's a
1363.84s: vis response right they don't like
1365.36s: feeling like a it's all those kinds of
1367.20s: things which to me those are all the
1368.48s: wrong reasons to hedge you have a very
1370.32s: clear business case that you're
1372.52s: implementing with with your hedging when
1375.04s: you're using something like long puts
1378.56s: obviously I got to ask how do you think
1380.64s: about those like do you go further out
1381.76s: in time deeper in the money you said out
1383.52s: of the money on some of them what's your
1385.72s: general approach there yeah so it's
1387.76s: something I've been it's like a strategy
1388.88s: I've been working on for a little while
1390.00s: I started to kind of implement it you
1391.36s: know I always like to study something
1392.76s: without any money involved and I do with
1394.40s: a little bit of money before I roll it
1395.76s: out intensely but so the aim was like
1398.40s: you said if you just try and buy puts
1400.52s: all the time to protect yourself I mean
1401.80s: you'll never make any money you're just
1402.92s: going to give all your money to the uh
1404.56s: to the you know the other side so really
1407.12s: what I try and do is really those
1408.76s: moments in time where you're looking at
1410.52s: the market sometimes just from a almost
1412.64s: like a game theory perspective you know
1414.40s: like I have these sizable
1416.48s: gains you know all these indications are
1419.12s: showing me that we have you know the
1421.60s: possibility for a larger correction may
1423.44s: not happen but if there is a larger
1425.24s: correction I have a lot to lose and if
1427.16s: it keeps going you know I'm positioned
1429.00s: so it makes sense to pay the insurance
1431.32s: at that point in time um so I'm sorry
1435.56s: what was the question again Eric I I
1436.92s: went a bit off uh you were going right
1438.84s: down the right path fortunately it was
1440.80s: just how do you think about implementing
1442.28s: the puts so yeah sorry that's right yeah
1444.40s: so so that's I was say so so you have to
1447.00s: step back and say okay it's not about
1448.68s: always protecting your account because
1450.16s: this is a g a business of risk it's
1451.52s: about a business of managing risk not
1453.20s: taking No risk if you want no risk you
1455.00s: won't make any any reward so it's about
1457.24s: finding those points in time and that's
1459.04s: what I've noticed with my own personal
1460.28s: situations like with smci where okay
1462.72s: just from a game theory perspective um I
1465.80s: have these huge gains I have this
1467.12s: concentrated position
1468.60s: even if you say look at this point
1469.64s: there's a 50/50 chance that we have a
1471.24s: hard break or we just keep going while
1473.32s: that Heart Break would be really
1474.56s: expensive relative to the cost of
1475.92s: insurance and so it just makes sense at
1478.36s: that point to hedge it on when you're
1479.68s: already at these very elevated levels so
1482.00s: that's when I'm looking to kind of put
1483.68s: on the hedges at specific times I'm very
1487.44s: careful even like with some some of my
1488.92s: members it's like they get that same
1490.08s: kind of sense like well why don't we
1491.12s: hedge more often it's just too expensive
1493.16s: you're just always going to be paying
1494.12s: hedges hedges and and uh it's really
1496.48s: about those times where
1498.32s: there's that you know asymmetric place
1500.16s: where if there's a break it's going to
1501.28s: get ugly and and you know if you've been
1503.68s: Trading long enough you kind of know
1505.04s: where you're getting on that you know
1506.44s: knif edge of where we can keep going but
1508.44s: it's going to be painful if everyone has
1509.84s: to the exit at the same time yeah so
1512.56s: then when you're looking at hedging do
1514.36s: you just try to hedge a certain
1516.04s: percentage of your position's value do
1518.00s: you hedge 100% of the value how do you
1519.96s: think about that yeah so again you know
1523.00s: some people are asking you should I do I
1524.48s: do a full Delta hedge or whatever it's
1526.04s: like you know again it gets more
1526.92s: expensive so I just just said like look
1528.60s: I have let's say I'm on a stock I'm up
1530.64s: 35% and it's been a good move I'm
1532.72s: concentrated position if I can hedge and
1535.08s: usually most pullbacks again you know I
1537.20s: try and use an actual perspective most
1538.64s: pullbacks are three to four weeks down
1540.60s: to let's say a 50-day moving average
1542.64s: that's what I'm trying to protect
1543.72s: because some of these stocks you'll see
1544.64s: historically they'll get 25 or 30% away
1546.76s: from their average then they'll come
1548.12s: back down so to smooth out those drops
1550.52s: which are are likely so basically I say
1553.48s: I have this 35% gain it's going to cost
1555.60s: me 4% to hedge this position for the
1557.48s: next next three to four weeks um for me
1561.32s: that's that's a good business decision
1563.04s: not not is it going to absolutely drop
1564.60s: now I don't know I I can't predict I
1566.72s: want to stay long the stock because I
1568.32s: think they're on key trends it's a
1569.60s: leader in the market relative strength
1571.52s: the market has good strength all the
1572.84s: rest but I don't want that huge downside
1575.48s: to the 50-day moving average so I hedge
1577.28s: at the money and I just instead of doing
1579.92s: a full Delta hedge I just consider the
1581.24s: at the money puts for the position I
1582.64s: have as my cost of insurance I know it's
1584.56s: going to waste away a bit at a time but
1585.92s: it's like you buy fire insurance for
1587.80s: your home you're not upset if the house
1589.08s: doesn't catch fire and another kind of
1591.48s: um idea I've had I've been toying around
1593.36s: with a little bit was then at the same
1595.80s: time looking at the really far out of
1597.16s: the money puts like okay if we do have a
1598.84s: break now and we get down to that 50-day
1600.68s: moving average you know not likely to
1603.12s: get there but you can get puts for super
1605.04s: cheap and then after just about the time
1606.80s: everyone's freaking out because the
1608.12s: stock's down 25% in like two weeks which
1610.68s: is you know it's always stairs up
1612.16s: elevator down well I can step in with
1614.88s: confidence on that same average and I
1616.92s: can buy some stocks and and I know from
1618.44s: experience because I many times have
1620.48s: sold on that that average when I should
1622.24s: have been buying just because had a fear
1623.44s: of the size of the drop so just trying
1625.04s: to kind of circumvent those natural
1627.08s: tendencies we have to panic when we
1628.76s: should be buying yeah that's really
1631.68s: interesting have you also looked at
1633.56s: potentially going deep in the
1636.72s: money yeah but I didn't want to give
1639.16s: like the aim is to not give up too much
1640.80s: upside as well but I'm not as um you
1643.60s: know experienced as you are with options
1645.56s: so I'd love to hear what what
1647.72s: perspective is on it yeah do you have uh
1650.84s: just a general stock you're even
1652.08s: remotely interested in now uh sure well
1655.04s: do you want something that has earnings
1656.28s: coming up or that's already passed
1657.56s: earnings or earnings a ways away
1659.32s: whatever makes you happy well let's take
1660.84s: a look at uh let's say
1666.44s: Shopify so let's say in this instance
1671.72s: you have long long share I'm so used to
1674.16s: selling that's so funny if you have long
1676.84s: shares
1678.36s: and for our long shares how many like
1681.52s: what size would we be looking
1684.24s: at well I mean uh whatever you could
1687.52s: just put a thousand shares just for
1688.72s: Simplicity sake perfect and then do we
1691.84s: want to pretend that we have a bit of a
1693.96s: profit already if so I can adjust yeah
1695.60s: so let's say my cost is around I think
1697.20s: $64 let's say would have been better if
1699.68s: it was 69 but 64 is
1702.16s: acceptable okay so there are a bunch of
1706.48s: different ways I look at hedging this
1709.16s: kind of thing the first thing is if I'm
1711.72s: buying options I actually typically
1714.52s: prefer to go further out in time and the
1717.68s: reason for that which as you know beta
1720.08s: Decay for everything that's within 60
1722.64s: days is going to be grossly accelerated
1724.76s: so if we look at just the at the money
1727.52s: puts here you're losing 17 cents every
1730.24s: single day this is all x transic value
1732.76s: so that will all bleed out over time
1735.56s: whereas if we go further out out in time
1738.04s: to like 168 days something that's still
1740.92s: at the money your Theta is now down to 3
1743.24s: pennies now a couple small notes the
1746.20s: first one is you will notice that the
1747.88s: strike changed here so your premium
1751.00s: quote unquote right the amount that you
1752.36s: would lose before your protection kicks
1753.92s: in will change slightly but one of the
1757.40s: things I really like to do for stuff
1759.16s: like this is actually to go in the money
1761.68s: now there's a couple things to know the
1763.72s: first one is if we go deeper in the
1766.36s: money you're going to get a better de
1768.16s: Delta for Delta move so if Shopify drops
1771.76s: a dollar here you're going to get 86
1773.64s: cents of that dollar movement as
1775.48s: compared to 37 cents whatever it is
1777.88s: you're also going to immediately
1779.56s: decrease your Theta massively in two
1782.36s: instances the first instance because
1784.44s: we're very far out in time that
1786.08s: decreases Theta Decay the second is when
1788.76s: you're far in or out of the money so in
1793.60s: this case you're paying more upfront
1796.56s: right there's a bigger upfront cost this
1798.36s: would be 3700 bucks which we could look
1800.24s: at a couple examples in a second but of
1803.32s: this 3700 bucks only
1805.84s: $210 is actually extrinsic value so if
1810.88s: you don't get an accommodating move
1813.40s: which would help you if you don't get an
1815.56s: accommodating move and time continues to
1817.96s: run here your option will lose less
1822.28s: overall so you're putting up 3700 bucks
1826.04s: but if everything remains the same
1828.56s: roundabout you're only going to lose
1830.00s: $200 of that and that's the rest of this
1833.12s: is intrinsic value so this starts to
1836.16s: hurt if you get a big accommodating move
1838.84s: so we can look at an example here let's
1841.00s: do something like this 115 just for an
1845.24s: example so in this example I'm going to
1848.68s: zoom this out a lot so that we could see
1850.48s: where it would start to hurt if we what
1854.20s: would you typically hedge so right now
1856.12s: we're hedging a tenth of the the
1857.40s: position do you like to hedge 100% say
1859.64s: let's say you bought 10 puts yep
1862.80s: okay so in the example here you'll
1866.40s: notice a couple things the first one is
1870.44s: if we buy too many puts we need
1873.84s: obviously a big move in our favor before
1876.04s: we break out of whatever we're capping
1880.36s: but the cool part is if you look to the
1883.12s: downside your risk OB you're completely
1885.80s: capped here so we're taking let me take
1888.52s: a look your p&l let's say let's say
1892.56s: right here would be
1895.28s: 188 your p&l here is
1899.88s: 18658 so you're not actually losing a
1902.32s: bunch of money because the protection on
1904.28s: a percentage basis is actually very low
1907.04s: if if you stay about we the same whereas
1912.60s: because you have so many long Deltas
1915.12s: you'll notice we need a pretty big
1918.00s: accommodating move until we start to
1919.68s: break out of it at expiration that's
1921.76s: what the blue line is the purple line
1923.32s: would be today so if we compare that
1926.60s: real quick let's say the 110 at the 110
1928.88s: you'd be making 46 Grand at the 110 in
1932.16s: this instance you're making 28 grand
1934.84s: that's obviously the drag from the long
1938.44s: puts so the that's one of the benefits
1943.16s: though of going deeper in the money is
1946.08s: that you actually can get decent
1947.92s: protection without having to put on one
1950.48s: to one because if you're at the money
1953.64s: let's say you're using like this near
1955.28s: term at the money you're saying like
1957.36s: four weeks so we'll just do the 42 it's
1959.88s: kind of
1960.76s: close this is giving you 38 Deltas so
1964.52s: let's say we buy 10 of
1971.32s: those so this is the original example
1973.88s: we're looking at of the deep in the
1975.08s: money far out in time if we use the near
1978.12s: term you'll notice a couple things your
1980.52s: upfront profit if you start to get a
1983.52s: non-accommodating move we're going
1985.12s: against you make a little bit less money
1987.28s: 18 Grand was I think it was 188 compared
1989.92s: to
1990.84s: 113 at expiration so a little bit less
1993.72s: if we don't get our move but to your
1996.08s: point and to the broader movement here
1998.40s: you have much better upfront return
2001.60s: profile if you get a big move near term
2005.72s: the issue is to maintain the protection
2008.00s: for this obviously you would have to
2009.76s: continue doing it you were pretty
2011.16s: selective so you might have found a
2012.68s: pretty efficient way to manage that so
2015.32s: if you don't like carrying protection
2016.60s: for too long the other thing that I
2018.88s: think could make sense is by having a
2020.92s: shorter term protection profile like 60
2023.48s: or 90 days and then I actually like to
2026.24s: do two things where I use both in the
2030.08s: money for the dollar Delta to Delta move
2032.96s: but then also a further out of the money
2035.68s: in case it's a big accom accomodating
2037.48s: move for the Hedge itself it's cheap to
2040.52s: hold that not a lot of theta Decay but
2042.96s: if you get a big move they're going to
2044.28s: have a giant percentage
2048.80s: return yeah interesting yeah I think the
2051.12s: first example for me is difficult to
2054.00s: kind of uh put on because the whole
2055.64s: point of being in the stock is I have a
2057.08s: bullish you know outlook for it anyway
2059.16s: in in in the first place the whole point
2060.52s: is just to like um avoid those worst
2064.04s: case scenarios like smci last August
2065.92s: where you dropped like 30 % in a week
2068.16s: it's just to basically hedge out against
2069.76s: those massive kind of downside moves but
2072.60s: you know the aim is to not give up the
2074.72s: upside like the whole point is you know
2075.96s: you think you're in a bull market you
2077.08s: have the stock that's doing great you
2079.36s: want to maximize that upside so that's
2081.44s: that's why it's trying to kind of walk
2083.40s: that a fine line um I'm interesting you
2086.44s: know if you can maybe show something
2087.28s: like you were talking about how if you
2088.56s: also bought something out of the money
2090.72s: how that would what kind of profile that
2092.12s: would um bring you yeah definitely and a
2095.72s: couple notes on that the the first thing
2098.40s: is I think it also depends on how you
2101.60s: feel about the downside risk like if the
2103.88s: if the goal is to like purely cap and
2107.12s: not have any downside risk whatsoever
2109.96s: completely agree with you that going
2113.24s: super deep in the money is a more
2115.00s: expensive expression of that the main
2117.84s: benefit to that is you're going to
2119.44s: preserve more of your upfront profit
2121.96s: today as it is so if we don't get a
2125.80s: giant accommodating move
2127.52s: in your case I agree with you I don't
2129.56s: think it makes a ton of sense
2131.36s: specifically because like that's the
2132.60s: entire premise of you being in that
2134.04s: trade your looking for that big
2136.32s: accommodating move so the way that I
2139.44s: think about that then is if you want the
2142.48s: cheaper style hedge then I actually
2145.40s: would probably just go a little further
2146.64s: out in time
2148.60s: because in this example even if you go
2151.28s: right at the money you're losing about
2153.60s: that that's where Theta Decay is the
2154.84s: highest cuz extrinsic value is the
2156.56s: highest
2157.32s: M so you're Los you know of your 465
2162.80s: every day pretty manageable but that's
2166.00s: not insignificant especially as a
2167.64s: percentage basis of the premium so if
2170.20s: you do something similar to that maybe
2172.12s: just go out to like 60 I would go out to
2174.72s: like 90 days if I could not expecting it
2176.96s: to hold it for the whole 90 to be clear
2179.32s: it's almost like you're putting a
2180.32s: deposit down but you're expecting to
2182.00s: take some of it back I wouldn't hold
2184.36s: this all the way into expiration but
2186.84s: going further out in time beyond that
2188.52s: 60-day window we just really decrease
2191.44s: the amount of theta we're paying on a
2192.88s: daily basis so in this case for that
2195.24s: same let's look at the same strike let's
2197.60s: just use the 80 the 80 in this instance
2199.72s: you're paying 465 losing 7 cents a day
2203.28s: if we use that same 80 you're paying 575
2207.52s: but you're losing 4 cents a day but in
2210.76s: an extreme downside move you lose more
2213.20s: extrinsic value with the further out
2214.80s: option right in an extreme down move you
2219.72s: would lose more Theta you're saying or
2222.60s: on the well like I mean like at the 80s
2224.72s: let's say so ultimately let's say the
2226.04s: stock drops to $50 doesn't come back by
2229.20s: exp by
2230.44s: expiration in this case here you're
2233.40s: you're losing that you know 570 versus
2235.56s: let's say the $4 do with the shorter
2237.60s: term
2239.48s: option if I see what you're saying so a
2242.76s: couple things if the stock does drop
2245.28s: there this these are going to go up
2247.84s: value no no I understand yeah no I
2250.96s: understand that of course but but I mean
2252.76s: like like your Delta is going to be
2254.80s: lower on this one right so like as it's
2256.84s: kind of dropping down that extr value is
2258.76s: being lost along the way there's there's
2260.48s: more to be lost like overall like so
2262.44s: let's I mean like let's say you buy both
2264.32s: options and the stock drops
2266.20s: significantly the one that you bought
2267.80s: further out is gonna be the more
2269.96s: expensive way in that case of protection
2273.40s: we could yeah we could take a look at it
2275.08s: because in in both of these instances is
2276.72s: if the stock drops it's both of those
2278.84s: positions are going to look
2280.92s: healthy yeah I know but because I'm
2282.76s: thinking of it in terms of like
2284.12s: holistically with the
2286.16s: stock I see I see I see I
2293.60s: see so this top one here is the 15 March
2297.68s: and What scenario do you want to look at
2299.64s: if we let's say this goes to $60 by um
2303.56s: by expiry or whatever yeah yep so in
2306.32s: this case you would have a net position
2310.20s: positive 11,300 bucks okay and so let's
2313.28s: see with the other
2315.28s: option
2317.12s: 10,200 yeah so that's what I meant there
2319.48s: like there's that extra cost in in more
2321.52s: of a worst case scenario definitely
2324.32s: definitely especially if your intention
2326.60s: is to hold it to expiration because the
2329.64s: and that's also another great caveat
2331.72s: right is to think about the way that you
2334.00s: manage the option hedge itself
2337.32s: because for me again depending on the
2340.36s: way you think about the Hedge it's
2343.72s: double-edged sword you want the Hedge on
2346.04s: and when the Hedge is working you want
2347.44s: the Hedge on because the Hedge is
2348.80s: working that's not necessarily a great
2350.36s: time to unwind the Hedge however if the
2354.44s: intent is to take it to expiration you
2357.32s: have to remember in this case you will
2359.12s: have to cycle this this 15 March several
2362.44s: times yeah in order in order to get the
2365.00s: same overall protction as the 19 April
2368.92s: so this 15 March actually comes out to
2371.24s: be more expensive in that scenario MH
2374.64s: but that's if you're maintaining a
2375.68s: continual at least a hedge for that 90
2377.52s: days or whatever so a lot of it also
2379.36s: comes down to the timeline of the Hedge
2381.32s: so yeah it it guess tricky because
2383.84s: because I'm using these in conjunction
2385.32s: with with a view of the stock and and
2387.16s: the direction of that stock you know so
2389.04s: like for example I had Hedges on uh SQ
2392.44s: block going into the beginning of the
2394.24s: year and so like I had to manage that
2397.04s: that uh option for the exact same reason
2398.84s: so I had bought the stock I think at
2401.44s: $75 um I don't for me want to bring a
2403.40s: chart up on SQ so I bought that like at
2407.36s: $75 in December that area no was it 75
2411.40s: or yeah I was like l i knew I was late
2412.80s: in the move but I just I wasn't sure how
2414.80s: this Market was going to act going to
2415.92s: end of the year so I bought at 75 then
2417.52s: it was like at 80 or so I said you know
2419.56s: this Market's probably come going to
2420.84s: come off or it's going to explode
2422.20s: vertical right now I'm not sure which
2423.56s: way so what I did was I bought some puts
2425.92s: and uh um I said if this does break
2428.40s: we're probably going to break back down
2429.76s: to that 50-day moving average area of 65
2432.04s: or 66 so when I actually did get down to
2434.16s: there I pulled off my hedges and so I
2437.12s: kind of I kind of used that gain on the
2438.68s: put to kind of lower the effective cost
2441.20s: of my stock that's the only reason why
2442.68s: I'm still in the stock I actually had
2444.56s: bought the out- of- the money puts which
2445.72s: I used to even add down at those levels
2447.60s: which I'm still still fighting with
2449.16s: overall it hasn't really rebounded
2450.52s: aggressively but at least despite the
2452.32s: drop but definitely you're right because
2453.76s: if you don't manage the the puts after
2456.36s: move happens then yeah there's that big
2458.08s: kind of you know uh that big value there
2460.56s: that that will ultimately you know waste
2462.92s: away all the whatever time value is left
2464.68s: in there will go away if you don't kind
2466.12s: of manage it yeah and I think the the
2469.40s: way that I typically look at out of the
2471.36s: money versus in the money it really just
2472.80s: comes down to the deductible right it
2475.44s: comes down to the strike because if if
2477.60s: you're buying it at 73 75 whatever and
2483.12s: we get up to 80 you're like okay time to
2485.72s: put on a head
2487.04s: depending on what strike you pick that's
2489.80s: your upfront deductible for whatever
2491.44s: your loss is going to be so if you go
2493.92s: further out of the money all that means
2495.88s: is you have a bigger upfront deductible
2498.24s: before the protection starts to kick in
2500.72s: now that is good in a big move like this
2504.96s: if you have a big move those far out of
2507.84s: the monies will compound quickly gain
2509.76s: gamma gain Delta and then obviously they
2512.48s: start to offset meaningfully where they
2514.96s: don't help you too much is in a smaller
2517.04s: move yeah and that's where the higher
2519.48s: Delta starts to come in but the good
2521.76s: part about you going further out of the
2523.64s: money is it's also just cheaper it's a
2526.12s: more efficient purchase the the main
2528.84s: issue with at the money stuff especially
2530.80s: less than 60 days is you're you're just
2533.16s: losing a lot of theta Decay if I liked
2535.92s: at the money I would try to gain that
2538.28s: same Delta going a little further out in
2540.00s: time to your point though if you're not
2542.12s: going to cycle that hedge you do have a
2544.00s: larger hedge exposure that will
2546.88s: eventually have to be dealt with but if
2548.32s: you typically have a four-week hedge
2550.64s: that you take in and then put back out
2553.12s: to me I would just be out in that second
2555.28s: expiration up front which will help
2556.64s: offset some
2558.60s: cost it's really interesting you know
2560.56s: the thing is I find it's in a way it's
2562.32s: almost unfortunate so many option guys
2564.64s: are just options Traders and stock guys
2566.20s: are stock traders that that was one of
2567.52s: the beauty of working on a trading desk
2569.16s: you had a little more of sharing of
2570.60s: ideas because even if you buy a book on
2571.84s: options it's always like so option
2573.80s: Centric it's like when you're kind of
2575.24s: trying to combine the too it starts to
2577.36s: require like a good understanding of
2578.64s: both to kind of build a strategy that
2580.36s: works for you but I think the beautiful
2581.72s: thing is that you can get to different
2583.60s: scenarios where like I I found it's
2586.52s: there's one quote by I think uh Paul Tor
2588.52s: Jones says the best offense is a good
2590.00s: defense which I'm sure he's taking from
2591.84s: someone else but I found since I've been
2593.92s: kind of working with this approach it's
2595.44s: allowed me to be much more aggressive
2597.20s: because like once I have some good
2598.68s: protection on in the paths where I'd
2600.88s: rather usually be like sitting around
2602.32s: saying okay well I'm already pretty
2603.72s: exposed I mean it's say Okay I I was
2605.60s: able to find that protection with gains
2607.24s: and now let's look around for other
2608.40s: opportunities so yeah if it's a bad
2610.68s: Market reversal you know you're you're
2613.24s: there's the cost of your your puts
2614.80s: whatever are going to cost you but if
2615.88s: the market continues you're actually
2617.20s: getting the opportunity to put on a lot
2618.92s: more leverage but in a safe way because
2620.60s: you have protection on some parts so
2621.96s: it's it's kind of freed up um a
2625.08s: different kind of uh mindset to be a
2627.52s: little more aggressive while being
2629.24s: defensive so I I've been enjoying it
2630.84s: it's something I'm I I always love to
2632.60s: try new things I've I think I've tried
2634.16s: every strategy I could just because it I
2635.60s: always learned something new and it's
2636.80s: been it's been fun to to play with well
2639.04s: one that I that I I still am just so
2642.32s: curious I'd love to do a study sometime
2644.80s: like to to see how you would think about
2647.44s: this stuff is like rather than using the
2650.56s: equity using options to gain your long
2653.20s: exposure because in in that kind of
2656.52s: scenario let's say we're trading Square
2659.76s: again back in and we're getting in at 75
2661.80s: like the the prime strategy that I would
2664.92s: run if I was a can style Traders what I
2667.24s: call a ratio called diagonal where I'm
2670.24s: just using a far out in time so again
2674.48s: typically like 90 to 180 days so
2677.04s: something like this far out in time deep
2679.64s: in the money call so something like this
2682.20s: 90 Delta so you gain The Leverage of the
2685.52s: option if I buy one I'm controlling 100
2688.56s: shares and I'm paying 2500 bucks MH in
2692.92s: this scenario if we compare these we can
2695.80s: get get rid of
2697.68s: this and then we can just look at
2700.85s: [Music]
2702.72s: buying so if we compare the two
2705.28s: different strategies if we're long
2708.16s: equity and we get a plus one standard
2710.64s: deviation move to 7450 from where we're
2713.28s: at right now you make
2715.96s: 675 in that same scenario with the
2718.24s: options you make
2721.08s: 589 the difference is instead of putting
2724.88s: up 67 bucks times 100 you're only
2729.24s: putting up 2500 bucks so technically I
2732.28s: can gain the same size by effectively
2735.20s: doing two of these and I still would be
2736.80s: smaller actually in terms of overall
2739.20s: cost but now I'm making 1,200
2742.04s: bucks so yeah and by going far out in
2746.00s: time you give yourself a ton of room to
2748.72s: move and it's kind of those same
2750.64s: benefits that we were talking about
2752.16s: before where there's not a lot of theta
2753.96s: Decay it's mostly in intrinsic value so
2757.36s: it's it's it's just a pure leverage play
2759.32s: it's a directional leverage play yeah
2762.04s: yeah but that if I'm typically trading
2766.72s: like a leverage directional strategy
2768.72s: that's normally what I what I go to and
2770.60s: then to your point I actually really
2772.48s: think there's a lot of efficacy behind
2775.04s: like mixing options and equities like I
2778.32s: trade a coverage strangle and the basis
2780.68s: of that position is long shares and
2782.64s: something and then I will amplify that
2785.92s: by selling short calls at a ratio so I'm
2788.84s: not capping my upside short puts to gain
2791.80s: more exposure also to capitalize on put
2794.00s: skew I also like to integrate ratio
2796.40s: diagonals with Longs actually as a hedge
2799.32s: to offset cost
2802.56s: but options man yeah there's it's it's
2806.44s: interesting you know like like I because
2807.80s: I'm aware too you know like long stock
2810.12s: long put it's you know your
2811.24s: synthetically long call I get it you
2813.00s: know but for me it's kind of it's not so
2815.96s: you know part of it is like I said Le
2817.60s: once you have hedged things out then you
2818.92s: do have that leverage it's like it's
2820.20s: like you switched from being long a
2821.44s: stock to long a call so obviously you
2822.76s: can go out and do other things but it's
2824.56s: like my mindset still kind of you know
2826.36s: stock Trader first building up this
2827.96s: position for an extended move and you
2829.88s: know avoiding if you're always just long
2832.28s: calls because then you can you know you
2834.04s: can take it to the logical extreme
2835.32s: saying well why ever buy stock just
2836.88s: always be long calls and your your risk
2838.72s: is always limited but then there's all
2840.00s: the Decay and all the rest you have to
2841.52s: deal with so it's always like that you
2843.48s: know it's that interesting always that
2844.92s: managing it always down to that same
2846.40s: kind of thing so it's almost like I in
2848.76s: theory I'm I'm a long stock but I'm
2850.68s: switching to a long call when I feel
2852.16s: it's a high risk situation then I'm
2853.48s: going back to Long stock you know so so
2855.76s: I'm only you know doing that at certain
2857.84s: points in time to minimize the drag of
2860.40s: option Decay you know so it's definitely
2863.08s: definitely something that I'm looking
2864.68s: more and more into for sure yeah and and
2867.12s: in your scenario like if I were trading
2869.88s: a a year plus thesis I would use the
2872.64s: equity myself I I would just forego the
2875.36s: Leverage
2876.52s: if there's something that I feel there's
2879.56s: a propensity for a shorter term move
2882.28s: that's exactly when I would use options
2883.80s: because most of my directional plays
2885.48s: they're they're not to the same
2886.44s: magnitude of what you're looking at so a
2888.92s: lot of the stuff I'm playing it's
2890.20s: typically expressed within three months
2892.32s: something like that so I'll use
2894.68s: six-month options to to gain the
2896.84s: requisite exposure to it but yeah I when
2900.16s: I look at really good stock traders that
2902.32s: can pick directions so well I'm always
2904.48s: just thinking man like your
2906.76s: pockets would just overfill with money
2909.36s: if we just use options just sometimes
2912.36s: just I like I like sound of pockets
2914.32s: overfilling with money it's a good it
2915.84s: sounds good yeah that's that's the sales
2918.56s: pitch that's the sales pitch to continue
2920.80s: trying to convince people to move more
2922.80s: into options is I'm going to bait
2925.32s: everybody with the you know Scrooge
2927.32s: McDuck gold coin
2929.80s: bathtub too the truth is you want me
2932.64s: buying because you're selling that's the
2934.08s: truth I know the way it works
2937.00s: unfortunately actually for those for the
2939.68s: hedges that you're buying now I probably
2942.24s: am selling those I know but I'm not
2944.56s: selling this the 60-day plus because the
2946.52s: Theta Decay is it's just too slow I want
2949.36s: that Theta Decay curve maximize bro I
2951.80s: want that steep Peak crashing that's
2955.24s: what I'm looking
2956.60s: for it's amazing you know because
2958.52s: because every strategy like uh has like
2962.68s: such common themes you know so it's like
2964.48s: now I'm more TR Focus now but like I was
2966.84s: a market maker for years and it's like I
2969.12s: wasn't really focused on big trends was
2970.60s: in and out and so you know you're trying
2972.16s: to take that Theta Decay as a market
2974.04s: maker you're trying to take that spread
2975.36s: over and over and your mindset so
2977.20s: different whereas you're just it's like
2979.16s: you know Turn and Burn like as much as
2980.88s: you can it's all about like you know
2982.40s: turn over and turn over and turn over
2984.44s: and so it's like it takes dramatic
2986.20s: changes of mindset but at the end of the
2987.76s: day it's like so like the way you talk
2989.60s: it's like I know exactly what you're
2990.96s: thinking and what you feel like because
2992.20s: i' I've done the same mindset just
2994.04s: through Express through a different
2995.20s: vehicle which was Market making in a
2996.88s: different way but I totally get it
2998.92s: toally well and and the cool part is is
3001.36s: you know like I I always talk about
3003.60s: finding something that aligns with you
3005.48s: like just the way you think about the
3006.88s: world right because I I've told you this
3009.20s: a million times like I've never seen a
3010.60s: 300% year I've never had that but I've
3013.68s: had two down years my whole trading
3015.36s: career from 2007 too so the like just
3019.24s: our games are different and it's
3022.16s: obviously the way that you think about
3024.44s: markets and risk even to be able to
3026.32s: build a 40% 40% position in like an
3028.88s: individual stock man like I would
3030.80s: struggle with that if it wasn't some
3032.40s: sort of like index ETF sector ETF like a
3035.12s: really just something I just was really
3038.08s: really convicted in but typically I
3040.64s: can't find stuff that scratches that
3042.76s: itch for me more often than not be like
3044.68s: ah like you I consider myself risk
3047.00s: adverse so i' be like how can I
3048.84s: offset some of this risk and well if I'm
3051.00s: in a sector ETF or an index ETF that
3054.08s: gives me a little diversification so
3056.56s: that scenario so I find these kinds of
3060.12s: conversations it's literally one of the
3062.44s: the reasons why I love talking to you so
3064.92s: much because it puts a completely
3067.04s: different approach in front of me it's
3068.40s: like completely different and I think
3070.40s: that that's one of the most beautiful
3071.92s: things about trading to be honest I
3074.44s: agree I think trading when you get deep
3076.40s: into it it's amazing on so many
3078.76s: different levels you know and everyone
3080.44s: has their their their their profiles I
3082.64s: think a a part of getting to consistent
3085.44s: profitability is after trying many
3088.04s: things and not wanting to listen to
3090.16s: yourself finally saying okay this is the
3092.04s: way I'm built and this is how I can can
3094.28s: trade because if you try and do with
3095.88s: someone like for example like Bill
3097.08s: O'Neal which you know again like I I
3099.16s: love his stuff and I I model my work
3101.04s: around his but you know I've done my own
3103.20s: my own history and different things as
3104.72s: well but you know like this guy he was
3106.96s: he was built different like I know from
3108.88s: you know stories and even his son has
3110.72s: spoken about it like in the 90s he had
3112.56s: he had 200% of his of his wealth which
3115.12s: was already sizable in Amgen and it went
3118.00s: on a 400% advance and he made I don't
3120.40s: know how much money I mean you don't
3122.00s: become a billionaire without having that
3123.80s: kind of size but like for me it's so I
3126.24s: mean you find I'm concentrated and I I
3127.88s: sit back and I look at him and you know
3129.32s: they call him the ice man they used to
3130.56s: say he had ice in his veins because he
3131.92s: was he was cool about it like he wasn't
3133.88s: stressed about it like I'm probably more
3135.28s: stressed with a 50% position than he was
3137.00s: with a 200 but that's his car like I
3139.96s: don't think I can sleep at night if I
3141.32s: had 200% of my account in one stock but
3144.08s: we're all built different we're all
3145.48s: different you know so that's and that's
3147.60s: why you know I I always aim to be a
3150.52s: legend but that's why there some people
3151.96s: are legends and others are are very good
3153.88s: Traders good Traders you know trying to
3156.24s: be good Traders and you know they're the
3158.68s: rest you know so it's you got to try and
3160.44s: level up over and over it's just like a
3162.24s: constant NeverEnding battle to improve
3164.44s: yourself yeah and then there's the
3166.16s:  degenerates like me that are
3167.76s: just out here just doing whatever we're
3170.00s: just flopping around bro you talk
3171.76s: yourself down too much man you talk
3173.28s: yourself down too much yeah it's I I
3177.40s: think the there there I really do think
3180.28s: that there's fascinating cross-section
3182.68s: between like can slim General style in
3186.40s: options I just haven't seen it done do
3189.04s: you know anybody that does that not
3191.68s: really I I I think now you know options
3194.24s: markets have become more liquid also a
3196.72s: lot of the stocks that like tend to be
3198.56s: can slim are more liquid these days but
3200.56s: you know originally um the s in can slim
3204.08s: if you look at the early editions of the
3205.44s: book stood for small capitalization
3207.64s: which now then eventually you change the
3209.20s: sales and all the rest there but so
3210.96s: small cap stocks don't work too well if
3212.48s: you want liquidity and if you want
3213.60s: options it's hard enough to trade
3214.84s: already there's a lot of stocks I won't
3215.96s: trade just because the liquidity is not
3217.72s: there and if you're taking on size and
3219.68s: stuff like you don't want those Gap
3221.48s: moments where you can't get out of the
3222.76s: stock kind of thing you know so I think
3224.88s: that's why it hasn't really been been
3226.36s: done but um you know it's the first time
3229.60s: for everything right markets keep
3230.68s: evolving it's like it's always the same
3232.04s: game that just slightly evolves to
3233.36s: creating new opportunities so we'll see
3235.36s: and I mean like you're saying we also
3236.92s: see smci a $300 stock doubling in two
3239.64s: weeks so may maybe you know the
3241.72s: small cap stuff you know just find
3243.72s: apparently just find $300
3245.88s: stocks yeah I know it's wild you know
3248.08s: and never you know I what I find more
3249.52s: impressive than that because you know
3251.72s: now it's becoming a little bit of a
3252.68s: bigger market cap but to see Meta which
3254.64s: is already a monster stock move up 20%
3256.92s: on earnings that is insane like what's
3260.96s: the market cap that it picked up just to
3262.92s: like never mind like smci yeah like you
3265.52s: know I think you go from a 15 billion to
3267.20s: 30 billion you know it's a surprise grow
3269.64s: story but to like put on 200 billion a
3272.64s: market cap like overnight like you know
3275.20s: how incred like I mean that's got to be
3277.84s: like the GDP of some countries like it's
3279.56s: just incredible it's incredible yeah you
3282.28s: know yep that's when I started yeah
3283.72s: because I was when I was looking at smci
3285.60s: I was just like how many shares does
3287.32s: this thing even have right and what is
3289.04s: it like 55 55.8 million or something
3292.24s: it's like number of shares is like
3294.08s: pretty damn small and when I first was
3296.60s: looking at it I was like wow that's kind
3298.72s: of Novel cuz if you start looking at the
3300.96s: other tech stocks like like how many
3302.16s: shares does meta have just out of
3305.44s: curiosity yeah man
3308.24s: 2.56 2.6
3311.20s: billion yeah it's a lot of
3313.68s: shares and obviously yeah M massive um
3319.44s: one other thing I I did want to touch on
3321.88s: quickly I don't know if you you still
3323.36s: have a few minutes but I would to see if
3325.96s: you'd be willing to walk us through um
3329.08s: maybe in a bridge version I I have
3330.60s: plenty of time I just don't want to keep
3331.76s: you too long but I'd love to see if you
3334.48s: could give us like a cliffnotes version
3336.04s: or whatever of your process for
3338.32s: evaluating these kinds of
3340.44s: stocks sure you know maybe what we can
3342.72s: go over is we also spoke about kind of
3344.04s: Market Direction which I think would be
3345.40s: helpful because because one thing I've
3346.64s: noticed about these kind of stocks just
3348.68s: you know growth in general or whatever
3350.80s: it's highly dependent on environment you
3352.88s: know so like I'll always tell people and
3354.28s: stuff you know like
3355.88s: yeah the stock story is important like
3357.64s: smci is an important story whatever but
3360.40s: these moves no matter as good as a story
3362.60s: is these moves always happen in a
3364.80s: conducive Market environment it's like
3366.36s: it could be the best story in the world
3368.24s: but if the Market's no good the stock
3369.92s: won't react till next quarter so like
3372.48s: step one is you have to identify that
3375.04s: healthy environment so if you want I
3376.44s: could share my screen real quick yeah
3377.88s: man
3378.72s: please uh where is it here
3382.92s: okay can you see uh there we there's
3385.24s: meta up right so at the bottom this is
3387.28s: something I've been tracking now for a
3388.80s: few years this is basically these green
3390.96s: and red bars shows the net highs or lows
3393.56s: for the NASDAQ so basically the number
3396.76s: of 52 we highs today minus number of 52
3399.20s: we lows if there's more highs you got a
3400.84s: green bar if you have more lows you got
3402.12s: a red bar and it's such a simple tool
3405.84s: but this has become really so obviously
3407.68s: meta last year was like a vertical type
3409.20s: of move but if you take up let's say um
3411.36s: I don't know what kind of what stock can
3412.56s: I bring up here let's say Shopify okay a
3415.44s: stock that was a little less in its own
3417.36s: kind of world of of Nvidia or meta I
3420.00s: mean you can really see all the weakness
3421.76s: comes in the stock when we kind of move
3424.52s: from this period of net highs back to
3426.00s: net lows you get all these bad breaks
3427.48s: and then as soon as the market becomes
3429.00s: conducive and more stocks are breaking
3430.48s: out you see these very nice powerful
3432.80s: Trends so for me like the step the first
3436.40s: step and and this I think goes to show
3438.52s: regardless of what the QQQ is doing
3440.40s: because again it's been kind of in its
3441.72s: own world let me just move this up a
3443.80s: second
3445.32s: if you take a look at just internally
3447.08s: what most things are going on this has
3448.80s: been a very difficult time for someone
3451.32s: looking for Trends because you have
3452.56s: these short cycles of you know a good
3455.24s: environment more stocks making new highs
3457.04s: and all of a sudden most stocks are
3458.12s: making new lows and this is rare so most
3460.72s: people will look at this and like that
3462.00s: just must be how the market is generally
3463.80s: if you take a look you go back like this
3465.20s: is the covid bull market solid Bank of
3467.88s: green uh if you go back further uh you
3471.04s: can see this is like that 2016 to 2018
3474.48s: period you know you can call it like the
3475.88s: Trump rally and then after that like
3477.72s: this was a solid Bank of green so more
3479.92s: stocks uh doing better than than than
3482.40s: not uh let me bring up the QQQ to go
3484.92s: back further one second which fun fact I
3488.88s: I've been trading qld a bit and it's
3492.48s: just because when I normally run the
3494.48s: coverage triangle it's in something like
3496.52s: iwm which has been lagging hard and I
3498.72s: was like I need exposure to I need
3500.20s: exposure to something that's working so
3503.16s: yeah yeah yeah so I just to say so so in
3505.96s: in healthy markets you will see these
3508.24s: sizable Trends in net highs it's just
3510.36s: the way markets function so this has
3512.16s: been a tricky Market because it's been
3514.64s: led by the few yeah I mean most stocks
3516.88s: obviously are off the lows of where they
3518.40s: were in in 2022 but the powerful moves
3521.64s: like the sustained moves have been in
3523.12s: the few um but getting this right like
3527.44s: learning when to operate in these
3528.92s: environments of net progress that's
3530.92s: where all the fireworks come up so what
3532.60s: I did was if you go even a step further
3534.24s: and this this is this is what really was
3535.24s: kind of eye opening for me we can
3537.24s: overlay the same kind of color coding
3539.16s: right onto the charts let me just kind
3540.56s: of and the these are free tools I
3542.04s: published for anyone who wants them
3543.20s: they're called um us markets net highs
3545.48s: lows and this is the overlay if you want
3547.52s: to Overlay it on the chart so for anyone
3549.04s: who wants to kind of add this in trading
3550.36s: view you can just add it on so if you
3552.72s: bring up for example like Amazon this is
3554.84s: something that I found really
3555.64s: interesting if you go back in
3557.28s: time and here let me just kind of take
3560.24s: off the rest of this noise all the
3561.72s: averages and all the rest and minimize
3564.12s: this so the interesting thing is if you
3566.16s: put a log chart and you look at okay
3567.88s: Amazon's been one of the great kind of
3569.60s: growth stories uh the past 20 years
3573.04s: obviously where did all of the good
3575.28s: happen where did all the bad happen so
3576.80s: all of like the lengthy advances always
3578.68s: took place with net highs all of the
3580.88s: pain the sharp drops this is a log scale
3582.88s: so these are you know decently sharp
3584.48s: drops all take place when the market
3587.24s: environment is not conducive or all the
3588.96s: sideways volatility happens when the
3590.68s: Market's not conducive and you can see
3592.96s: here all the big drops so getting the
3594.36s: envir right is so key even if you look
3596.12s: at Monster Beverage which is again one
3598.44s: of the the great Market winners if you
3600.76s: take a look at its um like massive early
3603.80s: Advance this is such a a cool chart to
3606.40s: look at so this stock goes from when
3609.40s: they invented like the monster drink
3610.72s: from this is split adjusted but from
3612.20s: like 4 cents to like $4 I mean
3616.16s: unbelievable move right so you're almost
3618.32s: going vertical where are the few times
3620.36s: this thing actually stops to catch its
3621.84s: breath it's when the market turns sour
3623.88s: so you have the stock that's going up
3626.00s: like a hundredfold but when the market
3628.32s: goes sour it still puts it into sleep so
3631.12s: for me that became just a really kind of
3632.88s: like a light bulb moment and and I've
3634.28s: looked at so many different tools this
3635.88s: is something like I know like William
3636.72s: O'Neal will have his follow through day
3638.24s: and distribution days and people use
3640.04s: averages and all the rest but you're
3642.20s: relying a lot on the index and the
3643.84s: indexes now are far more skewed than
3646.72s: they've ever been I mean like that's a
3648.44s: just a statistical fact and there's
3650.08s: never been a time with the S&P 500 at
3652.60s: alltime highs and the Russell's still in
3654.12s: a bare Market minus 20 it's never
3655.60s: happened before so this is it is unique
3657.28s: times in that respect but if you're not
3659.52s: just trading that if you're not playing
3661.08s: just the game of beating the markets and
3662.48s: you're trying to find uh you know those
3665.60s: big growth names those big movers
3667.96s: adapting to those healthy environments
3669.64s: is when all the fireworks happen and you
3671.24s: can see it uh if you any kind of stocks
3673.44s: you bring up let me um let me think of
3675.72s: even just say for example Square we were
3677.16s: talking about Square before I mean when
3680.08s: did this stock get back into gear it's
3682.16s: when the market turned healthy and you
3683.28s: have this big powerful move up when did
3684.80s: it get smoked every time when the market
3686.40s: wasn't working and and it's only
3688.32s: Amplified by whether or not it's a
3689.76s: quality stock or not so if you bring up
3691.36s: let's say smci which is under heavy
3693.36s: heavy accumulation now where did the
3695.32s: monster moves happen well they happened
3697.04s: when the market was also conducive so
3699.44s: like really first step before you're
3701.44s: making any other kind of decision for me
3703.40s: at least is I'm going to be wanting to
3706.24s: kind of get very aggressive when the
3707.60s: Market's already healthy and and for me
3709.84s: just logically if more stocks are making
3712.32s: 52 we highs and 52 we lows there's more
3715.08s: accumulation it's the most like kind of
3717.12s: basic test of whether or not you have a
3718.76s: healthy Market or not it's it's not
3720.20s: market cap weighted it's not even you
3722.48s: know Advanced decline where you could
3723.92s: say like you know is the stock only up
3725.12s: 10 cents today like no did the stock
3726.80s: make higher prices than any other time
3728.64s: in the past year someone's buying that
3730.96s: stock is this stock breaking to new lows
3732.68s: over the past year someone wants out of
3734.32s: that stock I find it's the most kind of
3736.40s: basic and pure measure and it's it's one
3738.92s: that's been very helpful for me to to
3740.28s: navigate which was a a really kind of
3742.84s: back and forth year last year for
3744.12s: someone trying to do Trend following it
3746.08s: was it was tough yeah it's a really
3749.32s: really cool tool especially the overlay
3751.96s: question for you do you have a
3753.92s: perspective on the duration that starts
3757.68s: to become more meaningful if we're in
3760.68s: net highs or net lows right so obviously
3762.48s: these are like highlighting if there's
3763.68s: like three days in a row but some of
3765.80s: them are very brief and some of them
3767.88s: obviously are quite wide is there a
3769.80s: duration where you're like okay we're
3771.56s: starting to see like a clear net High
3773.64s: trend being set
3775.84s: here so it's hard to know ahead of time
3778.52s: usually if you overlay this with
3779.96s: interest rates especially high yields
3781.84s: you'll see a really strong correlation
3783.40s: so really I mean that link yields in the
3785.48s: market it's always been always will be
3787.72s: but kind of Beyond looking for that what
3789.76s: I found to be more meaningful is if you
3792.44s: actually kind of break this if you
3794.04s: double click on this you can instead of
3795.44s: seeing the net number you can see both
3797.64s: the highs and the lows so if you kind of
3799.60s: plot it like this you you won't see the
3801.08s: you'll see the number of highs and lows
3802.88s: I found that rather than looking for for
3804.56s: like how many days or duration or
3806.24s: whatever if you kind of let me just get
3808.12s: the right number
3810.28s: there um one second let me put a
3813.96s: horizontal
3816.16s: line I found when you have like about 50
3819.20s: or more net new highs you're you're
3822.32s: probably in a healthier environment so
3824.32s: you'll here let me kind of take off the
3826.60s: polka dot um stripes for a second but if
3830.20s: you take a look if you kind of ignore
3832.40s: the background and you look at just like
3833.96s: the environments when you have you know
3835.96s: you have 50 or more stocks making new
3837.64s: highs that's a good secondary test so
3840.20s: there are some times where the Market's
3842.48s: just kind of generally quiet and like
3844.20s: yeah maybe there's you know 17 new highs
3847.20s: and only six new lows on that day but
3849.32s: there there's no meaningful Direction in
3850.96s: either way so I noticed that the really
3853.12s: good bull markets not only do they have
3855.00s: more highs than lows but you can see
3857.00s: here for example in 20120
3859.28s: 2021 like you're meaningfully above 50
3862.68s: stocks making you 52 we highs each day
3864.88s: so I I kind of used those two to balance
3866.96s: to kind of gauge whether the signal is
3868.68s: is a little more valid or not and and
3870.68s: and for me it's not like again an all or
3872.20s: nothing like oh net highs gotta buy 100%
3874.88s: it's like okay let's look now to start
3876.28s: building those positions and the market
3878.52s: feedback will will guide you further do
3881.20s: you have a preferred exchange to focus
3882.88s: on it's funny that you have this because
3884.96s: I I have a similar version of net highs
3887.60s: and lows I don't have the cool color
3889.68s: coding mes and thinker swim but I
3891.64s: actually use two moving averages with
3893.80s: mine
3894.68s: I use like a 50 period and then a 21
3897.08s: period oh no a 150 period and a 21
3900.08s: period moving average do have you ever
3902.12s: first tinkered with any moving averages
3903.84s: with this or do you use that fixed level
3905.44s: of 50 I have but um then I found like
3908.72s: the look back period makes a difference
3911.12s: for fast moving like you know it's very
3913.56s: interesting if you look at let's say uh
3915.84s: Market breakdowns let me just bring up
3917.60s: let's say QQ again and right you know if
3920.96s: you have a lot of positions on Market
3922.64s: breakdowns happen fast and and you want
3924.44s: to be cognizant of those so this kind of
3927.08s: like saved me in 2020 because if you
3929.20s: take a look at when that top came in and
3931.08s: the whole Co thing was starting by
3933.60s: looking at just the net number if
3935.24s: there's like a dramatic shift in the
3936.64s: markets it will show up right away and
3939.64s: and that's why I like to often also
3941.36s: break the numbers apart is it are we
3943.48s: getting a net number because just you
3945.52s: know there's no new highs today the
3946.88s: Market's taking a pause or is the market
3949.56s: breaking down you can really see um when
3953.24s: that bre moves started you can just see
3955.52s: how even on the first day or two you had
3958.44s: a surge of stocks making 52 we lows I
3960.96s: mean like you were three or four days
3962.80s: from the bull market high but you almost
3964.80s: had the same number of lows as you had
3966.52s: during the depth of the correction of
3968.08s: the summer before before went I mean
3970.28s: these were extreme figures obviously so
3973.68s: um rather than use the moving averages
3975.64s: I'll just kind of look at those levels
3977.28s: and I'll I'll dial in to see like okay
3979.04s: is this a normal pause because stocks
3981.28s: are taking a break it's been a hot run
3982.84s: or are we seeing an increase as well
3985.04s: under the hood and new lows breaking
3986.56s: down to me that's kind of how I like to
3988.00s: implement it yeah yeah that that's
3989.96s: actually really really cool and then do
3991.80s: you have a preferred exchange that you
3993.08s: focus on I see this is the NASDAQ yeah
3995.12s: this is Nas I found NASDAQ because you
3997.68s: know again that probably comes down to
3998.92s: style for my style where I'm looking for
4000.48s: high growth nasdaq's more representative
4003.20s: some people like to put them all in
4004.56s: there which you have that option if you
4005.96s: want the mix or if some people say like
4007.52s: look I if I was someone focusing more on
4010.00s: slower moving stocks for a a commer
4012.48s: portfolio I I would use NY so I think it
4014.96s: just uh depends the flavor you're
4016.88s: looking for but I I found the NASDAQ
4019.52s: maybe because you know the um the more
4022.40s: sensitive stock gives the earlier signal
4024.44s: I find it's helpful to look at the
4025.76s: NASDAQ but uh that's my personal
4027.76s: preference that's a good way to to frame
4030.28s: it as well I that would actually be the
4032.64s: the statistical side of my mind would be
4034.84s: so fascinated to do like run a study
4036.88s: between the two of them in terms of
4038.12s: their predictive capabilities like the
4040.20s: different exchanges but
4042.92s: that's it's one of the cleanest ways I
4046.04s: can think of to measure broad Market
4048.68s: sentiment because you know people spend
4050.44s: I find a lot of time chasing their tails
4052.24s: right they're like what what what did
4054.12s: this economic what's M2 doing what's the
4056.92s: yield inversion like there's a lot of
4059.20s: stuff you could look at and the cool
4061.64s: part is at least from a trading
4062.80s: perspective most of that is going to be
4064.64s: baked into what you're seeing here I
4067.48s: agree and you know like I'll always talk
4069.04s: well of Bill O'Neal because I you know I
4071.00s: I was so fortunate to meet him in 2010
4073.12s: and I think he's done amazing amazing
4074.20s: things and all the rest but you know to
4076.56s: be I don't want to say critical but I
4077.96s: think just markets change so you have to
4079.32s: be aware of tools like one of the tools
4080.92s: he taught and used for many years was
4083.04s: the distribution day concept where you
4085.04s: know if the market kind of came down
4086.48s: more than 0.2% on increased volume and
4089.16s: he had all these kind of rules first of
4090.64s: if you had four days in a 20-day window
4092.56s: then five then six because markets CH it
4095.16s: just kind of stopped working like I
4097.00s: found as an effective tool so I mean so
4098.88s: sometimes you know I find like you said
4101.00s: this is just such a simple to the point
4103.88s: Point tool that doesn't require complex
4107.04s: analysis and at the end of the day yeah
4108.92s: even if it's lower quality stocks
4111.64s: breaking down and you know you could say
4113.72s: I'm in a higher quality stock those are
4116.16s: kind of like the canaries in the coal
4117.32s: mine like yeah you know maybe a stock
4119.20s: doesn't have to go up but it doesn't
4120.52s: have to break down if stocks are
4122.52s: actively being sold down to 52 we lows
4125.68s: there's some kind of problem if it's
4127.08s: happening on a wide wide basis so I find
4130.04s: this has just been the most helpful tool
4131.76s: for me to navigate which you know the
4133.76s: markets which have been some pretty
4136.20s: abnormal times with between inflation
4138.24s: the spread between large caps small caps
4140.32s: and all the rest it's been it's been a
4142.44s: weird couple of years man dude massively
4145.92s: so at least from an options trading
4148.52s: perspective though it's kind of nice I
4150.04s: know for you guys it's not so much sorry
4152.24s: about that but last year last year was
4155.36s: fantastic yeah I can imagine I can
4158.88s: imagine and you know that's the
4160.44s: frustrating because you look at the QQQ
4161.84s: and you say wow last year was the best
4163.28s: year ever for certain names but if you
4165.32s: kind of like look around I don't want to
4167.40s: say Arin vest is the best gauge but
4169.20s: there I feel like there's no great gauge
4170.88s: for just growth in general look at the
4172.72s: just up down up I mean if you weren't
4174.28s: quick to take a profit somewhere you
4175.52s: were smoked so many times even if you
4177.20s: look at let say the QQ QJ the next 100
4179.84s: largest stocks outside of the NASDAQ 100
4182.40s: I mean just take a look at the the the
4185.60s: back and forth and that's fine but if
4187.12s: you're someone who's trying to play
4188.80s: Trend that's that's a it's a difficult
4191.12s: Market to work with because by the time
4192.52s: you put your positions on the trend's
4194.08s: over two weeks later and it's like a
4195.40s: vtop and if you aren't if you aren't
4197.64s: quick on your feet and if the individual
4199.20s: stocks you hold are the wrong stocks and
4200.96s: you don't cut your losses I mean there
4202.96s: could be some dramatic moves against you
4204.52s: things like uh I mean we always look at
4206.04s: what worked out well but you have to
4208.04s: understand the risk you're taking like
4209.08s: for example digital ocean you could see
4211.32s: my my original kind of like oh is there
4213.00s: something going on and then oh bad
4214.20s: earnings and from 46 you're $18 or $19
4217.88s: and it's another Cloud stock but it's
4219.88s: smoked right so you you have to you know
4222.48s: you have to know what you're dealing
4223.36s: with to work with it there's big upside
4225.16s: but there's also downside you got to
4226.40s: manage the two of them for sure for
4228.84s: sure it looked like it could have been a
4231.96s: cup with handle and then the handle just
4234.00s: fell off yeah well there's some you know
4236.24s: there's some things that were just too
4238.08s: deep of a move and there something like
4240.16s: just you're watching and nothing to do
4241.60s: and then all of a sudden you just kind
4243.32s: of die so we'll see what happens but
4246.88s: again look you know when did The Mark
4248.16s: when did it when did it fall apart when
4249.68s: the market went sour and when did it
4251.08s: start to come back when the market
4252.24s: turned healthy again so that's just the
4254.24s: the power of of knowing your Market
4256.24s: environment is really really important
4258.80s: yeah and what one of the things that
4260.92s: your net highs lows have that mine
4263.40s: doesn't that I really really like and I
4265.32s: think it adds a lot of clarity um is
4268.64s: both sides of it together because the
4271.80s: the way that mine's coded right now I'm
4273.76s: I'm literally after we get off I'm
4275.24s: literally going to see how to change
4276.60s: mine to see if I can add like that lower
4278.88s: part cuz that's that's such a a really
4281.76s: great perspective I feel like it adds a
4284.04s: lot to it um yeah because mine right now
4287.44s: obviously is just tracking the net highs
4289.40s: and how many or net lows and how
4291.48s: many well I think a good example just
4294.24s: like more recent is even at the
4296.80s: beginning of the year I mean we had a
4298.52s: really hot Market coming off of October
4300.40s: went pretty vertical even let's say
4301.72s: we'll bring up uh iwm just to give like
4303.84s: a a less concentrated perspective we had
4306.60s: this really hot move and then we had
4308.64s: this pullback but the pullback was
4310.64s: really just because the number of stocks
4312.48s: making new highs took a break yeah you
4315.40s: had a little bit of a pickup and and and
4317.20s: new lows but nothing dramatic so this
4319.08s: you know that's why for me I was still
4321.28s: you know stayed bullishly POS positioned
4323.24s: was looking to add to things and all the
4324.88s: rest you know it's you haven't seen a
4326.64s: massive breakdown I mean look look at
4328.32s: other points in time where things got a
4331.04s: lot Messier a lot a lot quicker so I
4333.92s: think it's important to look under the
4335.08s: hood too it provides that added value
4337.76s: yeah yeah that's absolutely awesome well
4339.88s: dude thank you so much for walking
4341.68s: through that I I absolutely love that AB
4345.28s: I think on on our next session it would
4348.32s: be cool to work through like a couple
4351.08s: maybe like a stock or two and to see how
4353.60s: you piece this whole thing together into
4356.40s: the you know the Matt Caruso special and
4361.12s: yeah I think I I would I would really
4362.80s: just love to to run through that process
4364.84s: with you because the one of the things I
4367.28s: find really interesting about the way
4369.88s: that you and I both trade is that
4371.52s: they're with all Traders just so many
4374.28s: similarities but then there are key
4376.36s: departures that send us into me using
4379.04s: derivatives and you sticking primarily
4381.32s: equities but the way that you're looking
4383.16s: at Broad Market Trend analyzing sub
4385.88s: Trends and whatnot those are all like
4387.96s: very native to me but I think a big
4390.84s: difference and something I would love to
4392.40s: really dive into with you is like your
4394.32s: capability to find these things that are
4396.32s: like spring coil to whereas I'm using
4400.52s: leverage to create decent Returns on
4403.56s: smaller moves maybe it's just because
4405.44s: I'm a lazy degenerate so I just use fake
4408.00s: online money to make money but you're
4410.00s: looking for actual moves like
4413.04s: actual as long as you fill those Pockets
4415.20s: up that's what matters Eric I tell you
4417.20s: what that is what I tell myself because
4418.68s: I I love trading but as long as it you
4420.44s: know keeps making dollars it makes sense
4421.96s: to me that's it that's it that's the way
