0.68s: what's up outliers I've got three things
3.32s: on the docket for us today I want to
5.00s: talk about avgo and kind of the tech
7.56s: sector as a whole because avgo is
10.04s: reporting earnings right now and it's
12.04s: not going great then I want to take a
14.96s: look at a couple Market scans to help
17.84s: give some context about the broader
19.84s: Market picture that we're currently in
22.60s: and then I want to take a look at
24.56s: GameStop at the end of the video uh I
27.60s: mean quick Preamble I I did a quick
29.48s: stroll through I didn't see anything
31.16s: like jumping out at me but there are a
33.76s: couple things that I think are worth
34.92s: highlighting so I'll spend a little time
37.04s: taking a look at that towards the end
39.00s: all right so first things first right
41.00s: now broadcom avgo is in the process of
43.56s: reporting its earnings we can see that
45.72s: they beat on EPS they came in at 124
48.48s: versus 95 cents expected and they're
53.12s: down they're down 10 points from 152
56.00s: trading right now at 142 now it's still
57.84s: unfolding so there is a chance that this
61.44s: might bid up a little bit but it's
64.88s: struggling in a couple different areas
67.72s: so when I was looking through the
69.52s: earnings to get a sense you can see here
72.64s: it says uh broadcom boost AI Revenue
75.16s: Outlook but it falls after mixed
77.08s: earnings so it's kind of talking about
78.20s: the the rest of the operation of the
79.56s: company and I haven't gone through all
82.04s: the way through in detail so there's
83.52s: going to be tons of better information
85.52s: with respect to the the nuances of the
88.32s: qualitative components of their release
90.24s: itself but um from a high level overview
93.72s: as it's unfolding right now what I can
95.44s: tell you is the market doesn't like it
97.60s: so I think this is topical because
100.76s: broadcom is another really large company
104.44s: and when we look across the broader Tech
106.96s: sector right now it was just starting to
110.56s: grab just anything it can hold on to
113.32s: right so we can see in the cues it's
114.56s: have these two days side by side
116.24s: consolidating which looks okay until you
119.28s: look at the tech sector specifically and
121.76s: you can see it's had this big massive
123.88s: drop off come to Third and it's just
125.88s: holding on for dear life right here now
128.52s: from a broader Market perspective what I
130.52s: don't love are the things that I've been
132.76s: highlighting that are showing strength
134.92s: are starting to rotate a little bit so
136.84s: for example
138.08s: XLF big drop down here don't like that
141.56s: XLV big dropdown from the high that it
144.64s: posted yesterday xlu is still hanging in
147.40s: there it posted a high did close down a
149.28s: little bit lower so I don't love that
150.84s: but it's still showing highs xlre still
153.60s: hanging out near highs xlp near highs
156.44s: xlb continuing that downtrend xlc
159.64s: starting to level out a little bit XLE
162.76s: down to the floor so we're still seeing
165.68s: this broader capitulation which I
167.44s: continue to point out because if you're
169.04s: trading broad sectors like the S&P 500
171.36s: it's very Tech heavy Tech right now is
173.96s: not doing a lot to prop up this index so
176.36s: it's these other it's the combination of
178.92s: these other sectors
180.76s: that are generally keeping us alive here
184.04s: as soon as they start falling off a
185.76s: cliff 2 then there's really nothing
188.80s: holding this up which I just don't love
191.64s: it goes back to this tentative point I
193.68s: continue to highlight um the percentage
196.20s: of S&P 500 stocks above a 50-day moving
198.48s: average has now dropped to
201.84s: 66% so it's not abysmal yet but this is
205.20s: not good I don't like seeing this below
208.40s: 75% for kind of these like really
212.52s: aggressive down moves sometimes it'll
215.24s: dip below 75% that's not abnormal right
218.16s: if I zoom this out to a longer term time
220.48s: frame it'll happen but you'll see that
222.32s: it also spends massive amounts of time
225.32s: above that 75% when it's in these
227.48s: broader accumulation phases obviously
229.32s: nothing really revolutionary there but I
232.04s: don't like how steep this is starting
234.04s: and the reason why I care about this is
235.40s: because again this is the percentage of
236.80s: stocks within the S&P 500 above a 50-day
239.52s: move moving average so if the percentage
242.68s: of stocks above their moving average is
244.36s: Contracting it tells me the bread
246.72s: underneath the surface is starting to
248.48s: rotate over now this again isn't all
251.40s: doom and gloom I don't think that the
252.88s: market is necessarily clearly heading
254.68s: lower yet but I also don't think that
256.40s: it's not I think that we are still at a
259.44s: very very tentative time when I look
262.24s: across the markets we can see that the
263.76s: moving averages the shorter term are all
265.48s: rotating over on spy and now we're just
268.16s: about to bump into this 50-day moving
269.72s: moving average I don't have the 200 days
271.44s: on here right now we have that on the
272.84s: main chart but it just looks rough is
277.52s: the way I look at it now the vix is not
279.28s: confirming a lot of this so that gives
282.32s: me a little bit of interest that the
284.44s: market isn't necessarily you know super
287.28s: concerned about this down move but even
289.20s: down to momentum indicators they're all
291.20s: starting to flatten out rotate over I
293.52s: already have my maximum exposure right
295.88s: now in S&P futures I intend to not add
298.88s: anything more until we start to
301.00s: stabilize it doesn't look bad here again
303.04s: we're still well within Striking
304.96s: Distance of highs term highs here is 565
308.24s: against where we're at right now 549 but
311.44s: this kind of rounding top just isn't my
314.40s: favorite so that's the market at large
317.24s: now I want to show you two different
318.20s: scans this scan is looking at the stocks
322.32s: that have options so this isn't the
324.32s: entire stock Universe these are stocks
326.28s: that have options that are within 5% of
329.16s: a 50 2 we high and I'm just want to show
331.08s: you the number of returns here there's
333.40s: 1719 that are 5% off 52 we highs now if
337.16s: I change this now 5% but I'm going to
340.04s: update the script so that we look for
341.64s: 52e lows remember it was just over 17
344.52s: 1719 is what you saw before you see 426
347.80s: in the same population so looking across
350.88s: this quickly it still tells me that
352.92s: there are lots of companies that are
355.04s: doing absolutely fine here and when I
357.56s: look across the things that are near lad
360.32s: again this
361.40s: is um filtered by optionable which is
364.76s: important because this isn't everything
366.04s: in the the universe this isn't
367.32s: representative of everything this is
368.68s: just closer to what I would trade but I
371.16s: see energy and materials and Industrials
373.56s: this makes up a significant bulk of what
375.24s: we see here Information Technology isn't
378.16s: really the bulk of what I'm seeing in
380.60s: here so it tells me that there are some
382.96s: companies that are obviously falling off
385.88s: and approaching towards lows but even
387.52s: stuff like Nvidia that has had a bit of
389.80s: a Down move it's clearly not hovering
391.92s: near lows so now if I change this again
394.68s: one more time and I want to filter It
397.00s: Again by the sectors so that you can see
399.12s: for the
400.16s: high part of this equation what that
402.80s: looks like and you'll get a a sense of
406.96s: how things are broadly
409.36s: performing so just give this a second to
411.92s: run we'll filter It Again by sector I
415.80s: have a bunch of custom scripts in here
417.80s: like a lot of these are custom that's
419.00s: why you see like slowly trickling in
421.52s: because I'm asking it to do actually
423.32s: kind of a
424.80s: lot and let's take a look so I see a few
427.88s: in energy few in Industrials not much I
430.16s: still see financials really leading this
432.12s: and again this is what I've been talking
433.56s: about for a while follow the strength I
436.08s: see information technology I see two
438.20s: companies within it that have options
440.76s: that are near highs so it tells me that
442.80s: we're in a bit of a distribution phase
444.80s: for things that dominantly fall within
448.52s: Tech so it's just none of this is like
451.60s: massively game-changing information but
454.04s: hopefully it provides a little bit of
455.80s: context on how we can look at the market
458.24s: in a couple different levels and look
460.52s: for confluences of information or look
462.80s: for divergences in information so now
466.04s: the last thing I want to take a quick
467.88s: look at with you as I promised in the
469.68s: beginning is
470.88s: GameStop now again there isn't a whole
473.36s: lot that I wanted to dive into on this I
475.88s: actually am saving a lot of the material
478.16s: that I want to look at for for the
479.92s: GameStop live stream which is scheduled
482.84s: for Saturday at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time
486.04s: and that one I want to spend quite a bit
487.68s: of time going through roaring kitties
489.96s: old options positions using on demand to
492.40s: go back in time and like actually look
494.16s: at the markets when he was placing those
496.12s: trades to really help me understand some
498.64s: of the decisions he's making and stuff
500.76s: now that part aside looking at GameStop
503.40s: as it sits today we continue this
505.04s: sideways Trend it is downtrending again
507.40s: from this recent slight Peak High here
510.08s: but again I see a higher low so far so
513.44s: this is our low kind of just looking at
515.64s: this small range window here see a low
518.04s: here now I see a higher low being built
520.24s: so hopefully that's sustained and then
522.16s: kind of turns into a bit of a rally
523.80s: point but again we have earnings coming
525.12s: up so it's always a crapshoot whenever
527.40s: you have earnings involved now the main
528.96s: thing I wanted to show you is from the
531.48s: options chain I still see that 2:1 ratio
535.72s: calls to puts total and I see the call
538.96s: side growing a little more aggressively
540.64s: than the put side now this still is
543.08s: moderate enough that like I'm not
545.80s: thinking anything massive is happening
547.60s: here it's a little too early to decide
549.96s: anything like that but it does tell me
552.60s: that there's still at least a bit of
554.56s: bullish activity going on in here
556.16s: although we're just not seeing a lot of
557.48s: movement at a GameStop so my game plan
560.28s: Remains the Same as per usual I am very
563.16s: eager to see earnings come out I know
565.40s: that we have some ideas on what it will
566.88s: look like but I'm eager to see the way
568.60s: that the options mark Market's position
570.64s: before earnings I'm really eager to see
573.16s: the way that markets move after earnings
575.48s: comes out I'm eager to see if there's
578.08s: some sort of readen to the way that
580.40s: we're going to use the money that
582.52s: GameStop has again I've been told a few
584.72s: times by folks to kind of not expect
586.52s: that so I'm relaying that forward so
588.92s: that my eagerness doesn't turn into
590.56s: other people's disappointment but it
593.44s: looks like based on what I've been told
594.80s: it's unlikely that they'll share
596.20s: anything like that I still hope they do
599.04s: because I want to know so yeah there's
601.40s: some of those things coming down the
603.56s: pike but otherwise relatively quiet in
607.00s: here as far as I am concerned and the
610.44s: other thing that I do want to highlight
612.60s: though from the options picture itself
614.92s: is that if we take a look specifically
617.80s: at expiration that includes earnings is
619.72s: it's quiet yeah it's 3 to1 ratio calls
623.48s: to puts but the reason why I'm eager is
626.12s: because I think we need to get through
627.48s: this week I think we need to see these
629.32s: these 100,000 27,000 roll off and then
633.32s: move into the next front expiration
635.24s: which will be earnings now what I want
637.04s: to know is will the earnings expiration
639.40s: get more spicy than what we see in this
641.92s: non earnings weekly expiration and sucp
645.60s: because that tells me if there's people
647.00s: actually playing the earnings so I'm
648.40s: going to monitor this 13 step expiration
650.84s: and see if we start expanding above
652.68s: 100,000 pretty quickly because then that
655.04s: tells me that yeah there's people not
656.48s: only rolling over into the next front
658.12s: expiration but also trying to play
659.96s: earnings so I am very interested to see
663.72s: how that goes the way I'm looking at
665.76s: markets right now is taking varanis
668.28s: premium opportunities as they emerge I'm
670.80s: tentatively looking to Trend follow the
672.48s: indices with Futures but very very light
674.52s: right now because they are not trending
676.48s: and I'm looking for directional plays
678.44s: using things like ratioc called
679.72s: diagonals and stuff like that because
681.48s: there are a lot of opportunities to find
683.44s: strength it's just in smaller groupings
686.04s: right now so it takes a little more
687.80s: research to come across those and the
689.52s: portfolio but the one thing I can say is
691.92s: this is not a place where I'm looking to
693.56s: use and deploy a ton of capital because
696.00s: I do not like when the market is hanging
698.12s: out near all-time highs and starting to
700.20s: stall I never like that that again does
702.88s: not mean that we crash but it means I
704.84s: don't want to top tick start getting
706.44s: long at the very top before we have some
708.04s: sort of pullback because then again
709.96s: there's an opportunity to cost to that
711.40s: Capital so name of the game agile fast
714.72s: on the feet even though you boy a
716.44s: herniated disc I'm not really fast at
718.04s: all maybe my thumb will be super super
719.52s: fast something like that as always
721.52s: anything you want me to take a look at
722.80s: let me know be an outlier and I'll see
725.08s: you all later
