0.46s: [Music]
0.76s: GameStop has just reported its earnings
3.88s: so it's time to take a look see what's
5.60s: going on how things are going and as you
8.44s: can see we closed at
10.44s: 2693 and right now we're trading in the
12.76s: low 28s now so we've up ticked a little
16.28s: bit because right after the release this
18.24s: actually down ticked not too
21.32s: insignificantly but as the news is being
24.24s: digested it definitely is starting to
26.88s: tick back up so let's see what's going
29.72s: on on now there were a couple changes
33.08s: and adjustments in the reporting period
36.04s: as a lot of people forecasted the
37.60s: options markets told that we kind of
39.12s: knew that that was coming so they
40.72s: decided to move to today after the close
43.20s: and we can see overall the company has
46.40s: done pretty well so let's talk about it
48.60s: so net sales were at 0.86 billion
51.76s: compared to
53.00s: 1.78 billion for the prior year third
56.20s: quarter so this is one of the marks
59.00s: against it to a degree
60.48s: we did see overall sales come down a
63.76s: little bit selling General and
66.16s: administrative sgna expenses 282 million
69.40s: for the period compared to 296 that's
71.48s: kind of what you would expect that that
73.40s: will e and flow depending on what's
74.80s: going on in the back end we really care
76.60s: about stuff like this net income 17.4
79.20s: million compared to the net loss of 3.1
81.32s: million for the prior year quarter this
83.12s: has a lot to do with the cash horde that
85.08s: they're sitting on and able to make some
87.24s: money from so Cash Cash equivalence and
90.04s: marketable securities we at 4.61 16
92.76s: billion so that helps them a lot you can
95.44s: earn a decent amount of Interest off of
98.12s: that now quick note that's not what a
101.24s: company is for right so even though it's
103.84s: great that GameStop is sitting on a pile
106.60s: of cash it gives them time and choices
110.04s: but that's not a you know just sit on a
113.32s: cash pile and then count your gold coins
115.36s: the company still has to be a company it
116.84s: still has to generate positive Revenue
120.36s: over time now I see a lot of people that
123.08s: are just kind of talking about how much
124.68s: interest they can earn from the cash
126.28s: which is good but what investors in the
129.64s: market is going to want to see even more
131.88s: importantly is how is it going to start
133.96s: using that cash to drive income to drive
137.64s: sales right now it's giving it a cushion
140.20s: which is beautiful during the quarter
142.20s: the company completed its previously
144.40s: disclosed at the market Equity offering
146.76s: so we already know all that went through
148.68s: they sold 20 million shares of the
150.12s: common
151.00s: stock um for the aggregate gross
153.88s: proceeds of about 400 million the
156.48s: company does not anticipate any further
159.28s: at the market offerings involving the
162.20s: offer and sale of its common stock
163.64s: during the current fiscal year so this
165.24s: is them letting everybody know kind of
167.12s: what the road map looks like going
168.40s: forward they did not hold a conference
170.68s: call which is their norm and they just
173.52s: ran out through the uh ran the
175.84s: information out through the 10 Q so
178.36s: let's see what else is going on that we
180.36s: saw a couple things that took my eye EPS
184.88s: obviously we had a beat on EPS we were
188.16s: what was it expected at originally it
190.36s: was expected at nothing came in at like
193.40s: 6 cents or 4 cents I think yeah so it
196.40s: came in at 4 cents adjusted was 6 cents
199.68s: so we did have a little bit of a profit
201.92s: on EPS which is solid this is what I saw
206.08s: uh stuck out to me is sales kind of fell
211.20s: not tremendously short but on a smaller
214.44s: metric like this in terms of smaller
216.68s: overall sales number this is a not
219.68s: insignificant Miss and I think that this
222.04s: was part of the initial reaction but we
224.84s: can see that we're in profit which is
228.56s: awesome like that's incredible for the
230.76s: stock especially this time of year even
233.56s: those sales has declined because of what
235.24s: it's able to do with the cash pile so
237.72s: let's take a look at the stock itself
239.84s: it's now down a little bit into the high
242.52s: 27s we'll see where this settles but so
245.12s: far this looks like we'll have a little
247.84s: bit of a gap up on the day tomorrow now
250.40s: it's still going to take time for all
251.56s: this to settle then we need pre-market
253.16s: tomorrow all that needs to settle in
255.80s: before we'll really know where this is
257.16s: going to land but we can at least come
258.80s: up with some Context Clues on where it
261.12s: might wind up but it is being bid down a
263.76s: little bit more it's hanging around 27
265.40s: A2 this is what I first saw it at so I
267.56s: would love for it to stop here it's
269.84s: continuing to go which would be great if
272.00s: you chill out any second now we'll let
274.24s: that sort its life up but let's take a
275.48s: look at the options chain because the
277.72s: options chain was really interestingly
279.24s: positioned for this there was 79,000
282.12s: calls against 279 on the put side but if
285.08s: we take a look at this front expiration
286.64s: that includes earnings you can see
288.56s: massive P skue so this is people across
291.64s: the board definitely playing earnings
294.00s: because that's the only reason why
294.92s: you're in this expiration this heavy and
297.52s: they're playing it to the upside and you
299.32s: can see that the skew in this is
302.16s: significant especially for front
303.84s: expiration skew so to me this looks like
306.32s: a lot of people that were
308.00s: expecting a bit of a positive result and
310.72s: it makes sense right because we could
312.80s: all see from A Million Miles Away that
314.72s: the earnings estimates EPS were about
317.16s: flat but everybody knew that they're
319.04s: sitting on the cash SW we can all do the
320.44s: math and see what they're going to yield
322.00s: from that from just holding the cash so
324.08s: we knew that they were going to come out
325.04s: a little bit positive so we knew that
327.24s: they were going to beat at least a
329.16s: little bit
330.60s: so that probably was largely priced in
333.44s: it's not everybody knows that right so
335.24s: it's not this massive source of deep
338.00s: information that folks don't know but
341.52s: it's still good to see the activity in
343.76s: the front so leading for the rest of the
346.48s: options change though you can see that
348.60s: we really have a dense centralization of
351.92s: options that out in 17 gen2 that's super
355.64s: cool that is people playing a longer
358.60s: term idea these options have been
360.80s: dominant on the chain for some time now
363.00s: so even though we clearly have some
364.56s: speculation for the 13 DS 20ds most of
367.28s: the open interest is way out here in 17
370.64s: Jan 25 which is fantastic taking a look
374.20s: at the actual earning statement released
376.52s: by GameStop there was a couple other
378.20s: things in here that stuck out to me so
380.40s: everybody's talking about the net sales
382.04s: falling a little bit short and kind of
384.28s: Contracting over the prior period but
387.64s: what I find also so noteworthy is take a
391.12s: look at the cost of the sales cost of
393.64s: the sales has come down noteworthy so
397.60s: that means in terms of gross profit
398.88s: we're down a little bit but it's not
400.76s: quite as bad at face value of just net
403.00s: sales missing for a bit because we did
405.36s: have cost contract at the same time
407.08s: which is fantastic operating losses did
409.84s: expand interest income we saw also
413.00s: expanded to the downside a little bit
415.32s: and you can see the total income here
418.52s: though was is up marginally and net
421.92s: income or healthy like really really
424.64s: healthy from this perspective so the
427.72s: company itself is doing okay now it goes
432.32s: back to what I am Oho eager to know
435.32s: which is what is the plan for the cash
437.72s: pile there's there's a plan you know
439.72s: that there's a plan there are smart
441.60s: people involved in this company looking
443.48s: at how they continue to move and
445.04s: transform it we know that they're taking
447.00s: their time with what they want to do
448.48s: with the money as they should they
450.04s: should identify good opportunities that
451.84s: they're comfortable with that they think
453.04s: will reflect positively on the company
455.96s: but I want to know what the damn plan is
458.40s: I'm so curious because there's a lot of
459.80s: ways that they can go with this thing so
461.84s: they're in a great spot that's as I look
463.52s: through this that's
466.04s: overwhelmingly what I'm seeing take a
468.40s: look at net or total current assets
471.16s: absolutely ballooned up from this right
473.68s: here which is just cash right sitting on
477.76s: an absolute pile of cash inventories
481.28s: came down a little bit prepaid expenses
483.36s: upload so it's like they they have money
485.68s: to use when they're ready to use it
488.28s: total assets is up significantly one
491.32s: slight thing that's a little interesting
493.08s: here is even with the cash total assets
496.72s: isn't up quite as much as I might expect
500.48s: so I don't think it's a big deal but it
503.88s: is something I'm just keeping an eye on
507.00s: because that tells us obviously that of
509.72s: this cash is being used for some
513.04s: business use cases as it's the company
516.92s: itself is navigating what it's going to
518.84s: be doing liabilities is up we know that
523.76s: we can skip through there and let's take
526.48s: a look at this we can see we're starting
528.52s: with our net income net cash flows is up
533.72s: 24.6 um compared to 19.1 so that's
537.40s: pretty solid and this is going to be a
541.08s: large reflection of just how much cash
542.40s: we're sitting on for cash equivalence
543.96s: obviously so yeah overall earnings I
547.04s: think is pretty solid all things
548.56s: considered the company looks like it's
550.28s: in a pretty good position here now it's
552.72s: all about what's what what does gam stop
555.56s: become and that's kind of fun to think
557.16s: about as much as I want to know I kind
559.12s: of like not knowing because it leads to
561.44s: a lot of really fun conversations and
563.20s: brainstorming from people on where they
564.80s: think the company might go so that's the
567.00s: question I leave you with where do you
568.32s: think GameStop goes from here what does
570.60s: it do with the money be an outlier see
573.64s: you later
