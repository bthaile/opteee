132.00s:  you
134.00s:  you
136.00s:  you
138.00s:  you
140.00s:  you
142.00s:  what's going on outliers apes the
144.00s:  outliers
146.00s:  you know what's going to do that I was ready for it don't even worry about it.
148.00s:  OBS sometimes tries to trick me into thinking that I'm not be able to look at this stuff but
154.00s:  cannot hold me down cannot hold game stop down.
158.00s:  I'm actually really excited for today's session and it's because
162.00s:  the last
164.00s:  shit like two months
166.00s:  we've been going through all of
168.00s:  roaring kiddie's old trades which has been really fun we learned a lot and
174.00s:  on the last video we actually went through and kind of
178.00s:  summarized all of that which again I'm like really really stoked on that.
182.00s:  However the thing I'm most excited about now is the
186.00s:  opportunity for us to start opening up or scope a little bit more
194.00s:  and I want to start diving deep into the primary game stop theories due diligence
202.00s:  research and I literally want to apply similar methodology to what we've just done
208.00s:  with
209.00s:  roaring kiddie's old trades and I want to go through them in depth I want to understand
214.00s:  how different people are thinking about the movement in game stop as a whole and then most
220.00s:  importantly I'm focusing on the predictive capability of things because as I continue to remind everybody
226.00s:  there's two very distinct sides of my brains when it comes to this whole thing.
232.00s:  The first thing is I think a lot about game stop as just in absolutely
240.00s:  fascinating study of markets literally love that and then the second part though
246.00s:  is a way to make money. I was actually texting with Newton earlier today
252.00s:  about some of the stuff that I've been working on and I was like just reflecting a little bit on how much time I've
260.00s:  spent analyzing game stop and we're on like for the live stream series we're on a few months in.
270.00s:  So the goal for today is we'll do a recap on game stop first I want to talk about what happened last week what that looks like
278.00s:  for game stop going forward and then I want to actually go through super stonk and then I also want to go through
286.00s:  GME those two reddits so that I can look I'm literally going to sort it by top posts and I'm going to see what I can find
294.00s:  I'm sure a lot of it will be like just memes and jokes and stuff of course but I want to find the due diligence and I want to specifically go through in depth
304.00s:  the due diligence and see what we can learn and try to piece things together because I've been studying from my own perspective the movement in game stop not just from when I really started getting more involved in the community.
320.00s:  From this past May but I started going back further and further and what I started to identify were a massive string of different perceived signals and I've been regressing them
340.00s:  and literally that's just statistics speak it sounds fancier than it is but it's just analyzing relationships that's essentially what a regression analysis is.
350.00s:  And it helps me understand from a quantitative perspective the predictive capability of things the reason why it's so important is because the human brain is so primed to remember things that validate what we want to see.
365.00s:  And we forget things that invalidate what we don't want to see and that is a really insufficient way to analyze really anything right that's why most people I find fascinating from a political standpoint where people think that like the other side of whatever side your honor like dumb and stuff like that and it's like people have different preferences right and the example of one political person saying well the other side is dumb is less.
394.00s:  It's literally them being so wrapped up in their own bias that they can't even understand somebody else's perspective taking that into trading and I use the political sphere for that because it's so common to see that and I think just about everybody has seen that.
409.00s:  Meanwhile, I will do my best to understand what my bias and preferences are compartmentalize those and then still conduct objective analysis that's what I do is I look at things as objectively as humanly possible to analyze and it is because I recognize my own fallibility is a human being I understand deeply my own biases even in cognitive processing and I don't trust myself that's what it comes down to.
438.00s:  But that mistrust leads to like really, really, really effective analysis.
447.00s:  Alright, so first things first I need to grab our map and I need to see if we have any people from our hard to reach places.
457.00s:  So we have our ape map and where are we from if there's anybody that hasn't told me previously where you are from you got to throw it in now so that then I can catch you on our map.
475.00s:  We finally we have somebody from Greenland, which is I think that's pretty cool. I think that's a fair accomplishment in and of itself, but we still are missing Africa.
486.00s:  Germany we have a couple, but we'll add pot stem.
490.00s:  Oh shit.
493.00s:  Croatia. So fun fact for Croatia, we're actually looking at maybe going there in the winter.
501.00s:  Who is that Chris Chris is Croatia cool in the winter. I'm not being cool is in like cold. I don't care. We don't care about the cold or cool with that.
511.00s:  But like is it like a cool place to see.
515.00s:  And then alright, so let's get pot stem.
522.00s:  Add a little pot stem. Where's that at in Germany?
526.00s:  Oh, so it's just like Southwest of Berlin.
529.00s:  Interesting.
532.00s:  Let's uh, well, you already know I I'm an interest like I'm just interested in everything I find myself being a generally curious person.
544.00s:  So with this being close to Berlin.
548.00s:  I just want to see what it looks like around your hood.
553.00s:  So let's just do a quick little peak here. Let's go for a quick stroll through pot stem.
559.00s:  This looks like a good spot. Hey, look at that. Perfect start. We got good taste.
565.00s:  Okay. Okay.
569.00s:  This looks a little different than expected. I have to be honest. Let's go over here.
575.00s:  Very gray. I want to go across this bridge.
586.00s:  A lot of bikes. Can I not go across this bridge? What's the what's the issue here?
592.00s:  Do the Germans not allow that? I know the Germans are real big on their fucking rules.
600.00s:  So very green.
609.00s:  This looks like a capital building of some sort.
613.00s:  Star bar, star bag.
619.00s:  Oh, doing a little bit of. Hey, look at that. That's pretty.
624.00s:  Listen, all I'm saying is that the Germans might have a lot of rules, but their shit always looks on fleek.
632.00s:  Their stuff looks cool.
636.00s:  Chris says better to go in late summer, beautiful coast, bay.
642.00s:  And it may be rainy and windy. The winter. So you have to be lucky to get good weather.
646.00s:  I'd recommend late spring or fall. Okay, got it.
649.00s:  Because that's actually really helpful because yeah, I mean, rain is never good when you travel in general, just because you know, it's more difficult to like walk and see places.
658.00s:  But I like me. They're us really like the like the heat.
662.00s:  Roaring Titty says rabbit hole Eric. Fuck no, this is part of the process. I love seeing where people are from. I love traveling. I love looking at stuff.
670.00s:  So now look at this. Yo, you guys have some fucking super cool buildings.
677.00s:  Love this.
684.00s:  Moody Blues says, what are what are nice areas to live in San Diego for a person looking to move from the Midwest? Well, it doesn't really matter where you're moving from.
692.00s:  I think it depends more on like what what you like.
695.00s:  But best possible piece of advice I could give is the same advice that I'm going to heed myself when we move because we're moving out of here in the not so distant future is just come visit.
710.00s:  Like if you like the city and stuff like that, then that's cool.
715.00s:  Down south is perfect for that. There's a lot of beautiful places along there.
719.00s:  We like stuff that's a little more out out of the way. So we live in a slightly different area that's we live next to a nature preserve.
728.00s:  So we're like four miles from the beach not far at all. It takes us less than 10 minutes to get there.
733.00s:  But we're.
736.00s:  We don't have like a bunch of houses around us. That's the tricky part in San Diego is in order to avoid being surrounded by houses.
743.00s:  You either have to go too far inland where it's scorching hot or.
750.00s:  I mean really that's your only choice or get really lucky.
754.00s:  Okay, so next we had Croatia.
766.00s:  Croatia is good.
772.00s:  And then we have.
776.00s:  Hold on.
780.00s:  Am I missing any others that you guys threw in?
787.00s:  I'm not sure if you guys are going to be there.
793.00s:  Dan says I'm in Colorado Springs for 10 years now.
797.00s:  City is growing almost too fast going to be bigger than Denver. Yes, you like that part.
801.00s:  I don't really I'm not super stoked on because that's I don't know Dan if you're if you already know, but that's literally exactly where we're looking to move.
808.00s:  We're looking at like the black forest area or I'll show you.
818.00s:  So the areas that we are looking at.
823.00s:  We're looking at the broad more in here.
828.00s:  And then we're looking at.
831.00s:  Black forest out here, I think.
834.00s:  Those are like the main spots that we're looking at.
839.00s:  But we have to go stay for a while. That's the that's the main that's the main part is we I've been to Denver.
847.00s:  But.
849.00s:  I haven't been here enough, but I mean obviously you could tell even the time that I spend looking at other places.
856.00s:  Like the the broad more looks cool. The main thing I like is that it's on the foot hills.
861.00s:  But the tricky part is is like I hate this.
864.00s:  I hate when it's just like fucking house on top of fucking house.
869.00s:  Like that is the bane of my existence.
872.00s:  And it's one of the reasons why I start looking for stuff so early is because I would be looking for something that's kind of by itself that has a really nice view hopefully.
883.00s:  But has a little bit more room around it. I do not like stacked houses on top of each other.
889.00s:  I like a little bit of space because otherwise you're living experience is just so much predicated on who you live around, which kind of sucks.
898.00s:  And says that area is also subject to getting big hail storms.
901.00s:  Few years back all the cars parked at the zoo were total.
905.00s:  That's crazy. I did not know that.
908.00s:  Dan is that specific to the broad more just because of like the elevation gain. I'm guessing it has a little bit that's nuts.
915.00s:  I did not realize that that's really, really good to know.
918.00s:  And then it looks like we have Montreal.
923.00s:  Add that to our list.
927.00s:  Dan says it's right next to the Cheyenne mountains so the cold air comes off the mountains and it hits the place got it.
933.00s:  That's crazy.
935.00s:  The channel says Alaska is roomy.
937.00s:  I say we just went to Alaska. You know that and we loved it.
941.00s:  But I'm also wise enough. I know Alaska in the summer is a very different vibe than Alaska in the rest of the year.
950.00s:  That's the that's the main problem with Alaska is that you have.
955.00s:  When are I'm not trying to deal with.
958.00s:  TVH.
959.00s:  All right. So.
961.00s:  Let's move over to the main screen.
967.00s:  This one.
969.00s:  And then.
971.00s:  Let's take a look at GameStop to start.
976.00s:  So GameStop had one of its busier weeks for literally some time now.
984.00s:  It's been a minute since we've seen really anything resembling life.
989.00s:  And I was elated to see some of this activity.
994.00s:  Now I know a lot of people right now are getting a little bit beat up on short calls because a lot of people think short calls are like free money that you get when you're holding long stock.
1004.00s:  And this is the find out part that starts with fuck around.
1011.00s:  So.
1013.00s:  Vladimir says most places in the US have shitty weather for six months of the I mean that literally I can't think of any place that doesn't have periods of shitty weather.
1024.00s:  It's the level of shitty that varies quite a lot like even San Diego during May and June.
1030.00s:  It's fucking foggy.
1032.00s:  It's like they literally call it May, Grey, June, gloom.
1035.00s:  It's like two months.
1036.00s:  Again, it's not terrible. Right?
1037.00s:  Like it's fine.
1038.00s:  But it's like two months that you don't see the sun.
1040.00s:  And it's because the Marine layer comes in and it just sits there all day.
1044.00s:  So yeah, everywhere will have its quirks for sure.
1050.00s:  I've not found a perfect place and I don't think it exists.
1053.00s:  I think any place that you look to live is just a series of trade-offs and like what you value.
1058.00s:  One of the reasons why we stayed in San Diego for a while is because I was really big into surfing.
1062.00s:  I liked surfing a lot.
1063.00s:  And I've fallen out of favor with surfing.
1068.00s:  I don't really surf that much anymore just because it started getting way too crowded.
1071.00s:  And it kind of kills the experience for me.
1073.00s:  But yeah, if if you're not like super into the ocean, I or the beach maybe I just don't know why somebody would live in San Diego.
1083.00s:  Reng Titty says the San Diego also have San and it does.
1086.00s:  We're actually having it right now.
1087.00s:  This is probably my favorite time of year because it's cooler out like in the evenings it gets to the low fifties.
1095.00s:  And then the Santa and a wins.
1097.00s:  They're like these really warm wins.
1099.00s:  It's just a very cool feeling.
1101.00s:  It's really, really neat to me.
1103.00s:  I like it a lot.
1104.00s:  But we do absolutely get the Santa in us.
1111.00s:  All right.
1112.00s:  So let's take a look at the overall move that we got in GameStop.
1118.00s:  So on the eighth, we landed just shy of 25.
1122.00s:  We're at like 24 87.
1124.00s:  I know a lot of people were sitting there pointing at Max Payne, you know, saying that it was being manipulated down and stuff like that.
1131.00s:  Which is again, I can't weigh on that either way because this is close enough where it's realistic.
1137.00s:  It's very realistic.
1139.00s:  The other thing though is that I always try to remind people that Max Payne does move.
1144.00s:  Max Payne is not a static figure.
1147.00s:  It moves as options move.
1149.00s:  And you have to think about what's going on here when it comes to Max Payne.
1155.00s:  So what I mean by that is let's say for example, we figure out, I think there's a website that does Max Payne, right?
1165.00s:  This one.
1168.00s:  I'm just looking for.
1175.00s:  Here we go.
1179.00s:  So here.
1181.00s:  So this website shows us for an expiration.
1184.00s:  This is using the primary expiration of.
1188.00s:  Oh, no, this is the next expiration.
1189.00s:  I'm sorry.
1190.00s:  And it shows the Max Payne here.
1192.00s:  And Max Payne is at 20.
1197.00s:  What will happen as the week goes, this will move.
1202.00s:  It won't stay at 20.
1204.00s:  You can look at this in two days and it will move the reason why this moves is well, there's a few reasons.
1212.00s:  The first reason why you'll see it move is because as options come up on their expiration.
1222.00s:  People will naturally move out of their options that are further out of the money.
1228.00s:  And then Max Payne will drift towards at the money because people that are further out of the money
1236.00s:  tend to close their positions out and move on into something else.
1240.00s:  So just something to be aware of.
1242.00s:  And again, I'm not saying there's no, there's, I have a video talking about Max Payne.
1246.00s:  And there's absolutely evidence that manipulation does occur.
1250.00s:  The problem now with something like GameStop is it's becoming large enough that manipulating the stock price
1257.00s:  any significant degree becomes more and more challenging with the more shares that exist, the higher the float that's out there,
1264.00s:  it just becomes more difficult.
1267.00s:  That's not to say it can't be done.
1269.00s:  And again, looking at Friday's close, it is, I mean, that's like less than 20 cents a way.
1275.00s:  If I'm a market maker, I'm absolutely doing that.
1278.00s:  So I'm sure those motherfuckers are doing that.
1280.00s:  But the main thing is like, actually, I'm curious.
1285.00s:  Let's take a look at like a five minute.
1291.00s:  I'm just looking at the ebbs and flow of volume.
1298.00s:  So standard surge.
1302.00s:  This is really interesting.
1304.00s:  Like nine big surge surge.
1306.00s:  And then this is interesting that there was a big surge that came in around 11,
1311.00s:  who's normally you would see this kind of volume over here.
1317.00s:  But this doesn't surprise me that it ended up getting getting bid down.
1323.00s:  And the main culprit there is literally just an artifact of it had really strong volume to propel it into this.
1331.00s:  But then that volume gave up.
1333.00s:  It didn't stay strong and seller stepped in pretty big time.
1337.00s:  Again, whoever those sellers are, what their motives may be.
1342.00s:  That's another story.
1344.00s:  But this absolutely would not surprise me at all.
1348.00s:  If it was manipulated below 25, I can 100% see that.
1354.00s:  So big volume spike to big, big volume spike.
1359.00s:  We have to talk about that.
1361.00s:  Because if we take a look at the seventh,
1366.00s:  the seventh had a five day volume of 5.4, 20 day volume of 5.7.
1372.00s:  When the 20 day volume and the five day volume get that close to one another,
1376.00s:  it tells us that we're kind of at like a proverbial floor level of volume that there's just not that much going on.
1386.00s:  And then we have literally like three times that amount on the eighth, a massive spike.
1397.00s:  You can see 305% relative volume on the 20 day.
1402.00s:  So big, big, big volume stepped in here.
1407.00s:  And a lot of it was by volume, which is really, really interesting.
1411.00s:  So if we take a look, we'll grab.
1416.00s:  Unusual whales.
1418.00s:  Is there perfect for this.
1421.00s:  And let's take a look at the order flowing game stop specifically.
1427.00s:  Friday.
1430.00s:  Eighth.
1436.00s:  And I have puts turned off.
1438.00s:  I'm looking at everything bid, mid ask offer, nothing, just so that I can see what's going on.
1445.00s:  And then I'm going to sort this by premium.
1450.00s:  And I mean, there's some big options trades coming in.
1453.00s:  This is definitely larger than what we've seen recently, but it's still like this isn't roaring kitty sized.
1463.00s:  As far as I can tell, this just looks like a bit of a step up, but not crazy.
1470.00s:  This starts getting more interesting, but this is a little further out in time, 20 days, 2000 to the 25s.
1478.00s:  Then we saw the 15 noves those got hammered. We talked about that already.
1486.00s:  So let's take a look at the last two weeks.
1495.00s:  Yeah, so what I'm doing is I'm eyeballing how much of this activity is like really centered in the recent days, which most of it is.
1503.00s:  Like most of these larger trades.
1508.00s:  Which is interesting.
1510.00s:  We're into the says how we looking for a gamma ramp. Let's take a peek.
1519.00s:  Not good.
1522.00s:  Yeah, not good.
1524.00s:  It's not terrible, but it's not good.
1526.00s:  The reason why it's not good is because the 25s here are heavy AF.
1531.00s:  These will help a lot because there was a ton added as well.
1538.00s:  And we have volume exceeding open interest.
1542.00s:  So there's going to be net add here, no matter what.
1545.00s:  And there was already 10,000 added on the day prior.
1548.00s:  So there's massive build out going on here.
1551.00s:  The problem that we have is that like this here starts to slow down a little bit, but this is still 10,000 more added on the 26s.
1560.00s:  Which that's pretty good.
1562.00s:  So if this hits well enough, that absolutely can start bidding people via hedging behavior on these 25s to go out by the underlying.
1572.00s:  Definitely that would impact price because that's enough to start doing it.
1576.00s:  But then we have a pretty giant gap at the 25 and a half.
1580.00s:  But if there's enough hedging activity that happens simultaneously here on the 25s, it could skip essentially any real requirement on the 25s.
1589.00s:  And it can start pressure in the 26s.
1592.00s:  The problem is after that, it kind of falls off a cliff because then here again, there's net add no doubt, but it's light.
1600.00s:  There's a net add here as well, which is also light.
1604.00s:  So that's the problem.
1606.00s:  The 30s are heavy for sure.
1608.00s:  They'll have another 10,000 added at least.
1611.00s:  But the problem like there's just not a lot in here to get there.
1616.00s:  The prospects for a gamma ramp are really, really specific and most importantly, stock availability.
1624.00s:  And there's tons of available stock right now.
1627.00s:  That's like the biggest issue that we're going to have with the prospect of a gamma ramp is that with the stock being so readily available.
1637.00s:  It is really difficult for a gamma ramp to take massive hold because there's enough liquidity.
1643.00s:  So in general, that's again, not suggesting that there couldn't be one at all, but I wouldn't expect like based on what I see here.
1655.00s:  I don't see like a massive run coming that's going to be based on gamma.
1661.00s:  That's not to say that a massive run couldn't come from something else that then is therefore amplified by the options chain.
1669.00s:  But it doesn't look dense enough for like a massive run again from like a gamma ramp perspective specifically.
1677.00s:  I would consider this more of like a contributing factor at this point.
1682.00s:  Let's take a look.
1685.00s:  I want to I'm going to use this for now just because I can zoom out a little bit more and keep better scale.
1693.00s:  This has been really interesting and I think worth a conversation because we have absolutely started to build in a floor here and this line that's been on the chart.
1702.00s:  We've talked about this a little bit this line here.
1705.00s:  I've drawn this a while ago and then same thing with this alert down here at 1932.
1710.00s:  Actually, I wonder if I can see the details.
1714.00s:  Yeah, I can hold on a second.
1717.00s:  I'm going to move you guys over to the screen real fast.
1720.00s:  I just don't know if this is going to show any information like personal information. It doesn't.
1725.00s:  When does this show.
1733.00s:  Alerts.
1735.00s:  Here we go.
1745.00s:  I'm just trying to find game stop specifically.
1753.00s:  And here it is.
1755.00s:  So that was set on the fourth of October at 1621.
1763.00s:  That's when that alert was set on the fourth of October.
1767.00s:  Bring you back over here.
1770.00s:  So fourth of October.
1772.00s:  This went on.
1774.00s:  And.
1777.00s:  If we zoom out.
1781.00s:  Essentially what I'm doing is using this recent price action to determine that level.
1787.00s:  And the reason why I think this level is important is because this is after we had the additional offering.
1794.00s:  And I think this like 19 and a half level would at least to me be generally the lower the lower floor.
1806.00s:  And then we have 20 and a half as the bottom of this channel that's has been defined pretty heavily.
1815.00s:  And then we still have a ways up to the upside.
1820.00s:  And I think that there's a giant volume note here on a six month daily to me.
1825.00s:  That's a probably a much bigger reason why the stock didn't rally up and out through 25 is because my guess is that there are armies of people right now that have a really high cost basis that are happy to get out of it here.
1840.00s:  That's my guess.
1841.00s:  We go out to a year.
1842.00s:  Yeah, like look at this.
1844.00s:  It makes it makes a ton of sense.
1846.00s:  So if you go back here, you can see this other volume note on an even longer term timeframe.
1853.00s:  This volume node literally ends at like 25 and change.
1857.00s:  It's there.
1858.00s:  So what that tells me is that there are going to be lots of people over the past year specifically within this timeframe that have probably scaled in really heavily way too much during these giant spikes up.
1873.00s:  And then we have a terrible basis that they've continued to add money into to cost average themselves down.
1880.00s:  And a lot of them will be very happy to get out here.
1883.00s:  And I think that's why we saw last week a pretty even distribution of sellers starting to step in throughout the day.
1892.00s:  It still was overwhelmingly a by date to be abundantly clear.
1895.00s:  But there was still 24% of the volume was sales.
1898.00s:  So there were absolutely people happily unwinding, especially as it started drifting up to that.
1904.00s:  Because again, if we take a look here, you can see most of that sale volume didn't come in until here.
1911.00s:  And guess when this timeframe was this is when it was at 25 and that timeframe literally matches up with these longer term volume nodes of people that have gotten really just way too oversized.
1927.00s:  At way too high of a basis.
1929.00s:  And this is exactly what they're dealing with right now.
1932.00s:  So that doesn't surprise me.
1934.00s:  This is going to serve as near term resistance in my opinion that again, as always doesn't mean that it can't overcome near term resistance.
1942.00s:  It always can.
1943.00s:  And it's just a matter of time before it does.
1946.00s:  But it's typically not a just clear shot through unless there's just overwhelming strength behind it, which right now it doesn't look like that that's here.
1956.00s:  So.
1958.00s:  Cedric says so you don't think that was to keep those 25s out of the money.
1962.00s:  It's I can't say it that discreetly.
1964.00s:  It's it's probably a mix of things.
1966.00s:  But what I say that the primary price movement here was only to keep the 25s out of the money.
1972.00s:  I don't believe that.
1974.00s:  And the reason why I don't believe that again is because it matches up with these very common broader human tendencies.
1980.00s:  So for example, let me give you an alternative.
1984.00s:  Let's say for example, let's use this here, this volume node.
1990.00s:  So at 1698, let's call it 17 down here at 17.
1995.00s:  There's a really small volume node, right?
1998.00s:  So that means that people transacted here.
2000.00s:  But in terms of overall volume of people that transacted at that level, it's not massive.
2006.00s:  It's not a ton.
2008.00s:  When you look at something like this where it's almost as big as the point of control, this is the second largest volume node on the for the past year.
2017.00s:  So that means over the last 52 weeks again, most of it centralized here in April, May.
2023.00s:  Tons of people transacted at these really high prices.
2026.00s:  So the very, very common thing.
2028.00s:  And again, you can see it happen as it gets near this 25 handle here.
2033.00s:  It got near the 25 handle here.
2035.00s:  That's human psychology because there are people that again got into this thing for 30, 40, 50.
2041.00s:  And then they start buying more and more and more as it's going down to try to reduce their basis.
2047.00s:  So that then when they are offered a chance to get out with their money, they do.
2052.00s:  And this is why something like volume profile is so informative because it can help us forecast the overwhelming majority of what people are likely to do in different.
2062.00s:  Circumstances.
2064.00s:  Now again, it's important.
2066.00s:  There's a lot of depth that goes into this a lot of depth that goes into this because say for example, when we see a game stop here.
2076.00s:  And let's say that this volume node right here again at the 25 handle.
2082.00s:  Let's say that this was built over the last entire year.
2087.00s:  Well, guess what?
2089.00s:  It's less informative.
2091.00s:  It's less informative because it can represent all different kinds of people that got in at all different kinds of prices for all different kinds of reasons.
2100.00s:  It still can tell us some things, meaning that people have been at that level for some time.
2105.00s:  And they might be eager to get out or it could be larger positioning for larger durations.
2110.00s:  You don't really know the beautiful part about the context of the volume profile here is I know for a fact because of the chart that the all of the all of the buying.
2120.00s:  Activity at 25 or above literally happened between here and here.
2126.00s:  So what that tells me is that looking out over this time frame lots of people got in at lots of really high prices.
2135.00s:  So that's why I think every time you see this thing coming up near 25 people are getting the fuck out because there are tons of people that have lots of money at really high prices that they probably averaged into reducing their basic.
2149.00s:  But consuming more and more money.
2152.00s:  That is probably what's going on here.
2155.00s:  So looking at something like this is really clear that 25 right now has to be broken.
2162.00s:  And the cool part though about once 25 is broken in terms of support and resistance.
2169.00s:  It starts to look pretty fucking open right.
2174.00s:  So if we get through this 25 handle, which is kind of like this whole block here.
2180.00s:  Above that guys the limit there's there's literally no overhead resistance at that point.
2185.00s:  You can see that there's a tiny amount of people that got fucked and there's stuck up here that just sucks to suck.
2193.00s:  A lot of those people probably would have transacted at additional points to lower their basis.
2197.00s:  My guess is the majority of this bulk here is this.
2203.00s:  So once that's moved through then it's much easier movement even on a six month timeframe.
2210.00s:  That's the same level again.
2212.00s:  It's it competes with the point of control.
2214.00s:  It's such a transacted level on all these different time frames on a three month word.
2220.00s:  We haven't really been there for very long.
2223.00s:  So that's where people are starting to step in them to exit.
2227.00s:  So really, really interesting.
2231.00s:  Now taking a look at the options chain for next week just to run like a standard analysis here.
2239.00s:  Very volatile were definitely sitting high relative IV.
2246.00s:  Let's take a look at the surface.
2254.00s:  I'm just going to use the primary explorations for now.
2259.00s:  And wow, that's fucking crazy.
2265.00s:  Jesus.
2269.00s:  This is crazy.
2276.00s:  Lots or lots weird here.
2279.00s:  Cliff notes really high call IV.
2283.00s:  Really, really, really jagged put side IV.
2287.00s:  So unclear pricing on the put side very, very, very unclear for 20 days massive call IV relative, which is very interesting.
2302.00s:  Look at this.
2303.00s:  This is crazy.
2306.00s:  So these 23s and 15 over so cheap compared to the 20 days.
2316.00s:  What did I say the 23s?
2319.00s:  Why is that so cheap?
2327.00s:  86 that is cheap.
2331.00s:  Why are those so cheap?
2339.00s:  I don't understand why these are so cheap.
2342.00s:  They're incredibly cheap.
2349.00s:  That's fucking bizarre.
2352.00s:  So I don't know how to explain this in a way that's not super nerdy and geeky.
2361.00s:  What the fuck do I do this?
2364.00s:  Let me start with the summary and then if you're interested, tell me and I'll go more into detail, but I don't want to start getting into more technical shit that nobody cares about.
2376.00s:  Okay, few things.
2379.00s:  First thing, 20 days notice how the 20 days expiration implied volatility is 94.59%.
2388.00s:  So if you're interested in the 20 days expiration, you can see that the 20 days expiration is a lot more than the 20 days expiration.
2394.00s:  So the 20 days expiration is a lot more than the 20 days expiration.
2398.00s:  So the 20 days expiration is a lot more than the 20 days expiration.
2403.00s:  So the 20 days expiration is a lot more than the 20 days expiration.
2408.00s:  So the 20 days expiration is a lot more than the 20 days expiration.
2412.00s:  Relative to what you see here, the 23s here are 103, 104% IV compared to 80.
2421.00s:  Yet the overall chain here is much lower than the overall chain here.
2428.00s:  So that's a really distinct variance between those individual strikes for a bunch of different reasons.
2435.00s:  The fact of the matter is is if you tried to buy and sell them to play it, a lot of times you won't get a fill because I play relative value movement and game stop all the time.
2445.00s:  And it's difficult sometimes to get a fill at the prices that show the the skew, but that's a massive skew.
2452.00s:  Just really, really interesting.
2455.00s:  So the to click one level in that's like the overview level.
2461.00s:  And to go one level in further than that, this entire period of front expiration lower IV strikes compared to 20 days means something.
2476.00s:  What exactly it means I have no idea, but it means something and it's because normally you won't see this level of a variance between these.
2486.00s:  This is a big discrepancy. This is again 87% compared to 104%.
2493.00s:  That's a big, big variance.
2495.00s:  That's an easy trade to make because you can run on the put side.
2499.00s:  You can buy the 15s and fade the 20s.
2502.00s:  You're just playing IV something on something like that.
2507.00s:  And it's a really good looking trade to me.
2510.00s:  The liquidity is OK.
2513.00s:  So the way that this would look would be these are cheap.
2520.00s:  Those are the 23s.
2524.00s:  These are expensive.
2530.00s:  Something like this.
2532.00s:  And if the movement goes as expected, either direction, meaning we see implied volatility rise.
2542.00s:  If we don't get a price movement and IV rises, our current PNL will still move up.
2549.00s:  It will still go up.
2551.00s:  Then if it doesn't, that's when we lose.
2555.00s:  But the idea here is that it would move.
2560.00s:  That's what I would guess is that just looks that looks to be the case to me.
2566.00s:  Which is really interesting.
2568.00s:  That's a massive skew there.
2571.00s:  Let's take a look at a couple other things really fast.
2574.00s:  Let's do.
2575.00s:  Oh, I.
2578.00s:  So light.
2580.00s:  Light options chain.
2582.00s:  567.
2584.00s:  18.
2585.00s:  So big call skew.
2587.00s:  But relatively small sizes.
2593.00s:  We do see a little bit more of front expiration.
2599.00s:  And then the next biggest expiration, though, is still way out in 17 Jan.
2604.00s:  17 Jan's interesting because I don't think this is people playing 17 Jan as if, oh, I think something's going to happen in 17 Jan.
2612.00s:  I think this is people just putting on longer term positions in GameStop to play the Delta movement leading into that.
2619.00s:  And what I mean by Delta movement that simply put is if we take a look at these 17 Jan's.
2629.00s:  And if we go out this far, let's just say that you grab something that's like a good Delta like these 46s, 59 Delta, something I prefer a little bit in the money.
2641.00s:  If there's good, you know, strong conviction in the overall direction for the ticker, you kind of, you know, get yourself out of really massive theta decay.
2651.00s:  And even if you're out this far in time, if you get a big move, you'll be able to profit from it.
2660.00s:  And we can look at an example of that.
2663.00s:  Let's go back to 25 and I'll literally show you a trade that I put on here.
2668.00s:  And as I saw this volume, we've talked about this before on the 25th of October, we had a pop in volume that was followed by more volume on the 28th.
2679.00s:  This is every single time I've seen GameStop move. It is with the same kind of volume behavior.
2687.00s:  And this is the most predictive thing that I've found after my like literally probably 200 hours of research specifically into GameStop.
2697.00s:  I actually would say that that's probably lowballing it probably about that.
2702.00s:  And volume is been the most predictive thing that I can eyeball.
2710.00s:  On the 25th, we had obviously a big day, big volume, but it ended up selling off that then ended up being caught on the 28th.
2720.00s:  So the 28th, this turned into just a standard breakout play.
2724.00s:  So once we started getting into the mid 20s, mid 21s, just buy some options. That's all it was.
2731.00s:  And I still have my longer term standing positions. I actually think like a lot of you, if I'm not mistaken, I think I have a short call.
2739.00s:  I'm going to have to manage. I don't know where they're at.
2744.00s:  But I could tell you, so I don't remember.
2749.00s:  Let's see.
2751.00s:  Where are these short calls at?
2760.00s:  They are definitely.
2764.00s:  They're definitely in the money.
2767.00s:  That is for sure.
2769.00s:  And they have six days of expiration. So we're going to have to manage those. I have the 23s that just straight up got ran over.
2776.00s:  But I have 17 April 25s.
2781.00s:  I have 30s out there.
2783.00s:  And then I also have some nearer stuff that I'll show you.
2788.00s:  So we can use this literally as an example here. So if you go to the 28th of October.
2803.00s:  Over 28th.
2807.00s:  We need to be a little bit earlier in the day because towards the end of the days when it was rallying up and out.
2816.00s:  And here it is. I think it's still a little too far, maybe like 10 hundred.
2831.00s:  And looks like it's updating.
2836.00s:  Citrix says, why do you do these color purple? Because I said it that way. It makes it easier to see. Hey, it's our boy Newton is texting us.
2844.00s:  What's Newton got?
2853.00s:  We're talking about hopping on a call.
2867.00s:  And then we pick his brain on some stuff.
2881.00s:  All right.
2884.00s:  So from here.
2887.00s:  If we take a look at an example.
2891.00s:  We have this big run that we see going on. And we think it's likely to grab some legs.
2901.00s:  We can come either to the 23s. I ended up going to the 25s. And it was literally just for liquidity.
2909.00s:  There was more room here for me.
2912.00s:  These are all old trades from other examples. So I'll just do a one lot for the example.
2920.00s:  And it's down at the bottom there. So what I want to show you is how this will move compared to something like this.
2932.00s:  And I'm doing one lots. I'm purposely doing one lots. I'm not doing the same dollar amount.
2938.00s:  Just because I want you to see the example.
2943.00s:  And then let's go to the seventh of November. I think it already started rallying here.
2957.00s:  And we can see where these land.
2974.00s:  Notice the difference.
2979.00s:  So price moved in our favor.
2984.00s:  Without without a doubt price moved in our favor yet.
2989.00s:  On the 25 calls here, you literally lost money so far.
2996.00s:  You are directionally correct entirely.
2999.00s:  You are completely correct in terms of your directional disposition.
3004.00s:  In terms of your PNL, you are fucked.
3008.00s:  You are right, but wrong.
3011.00s:  Why did this happen?
3014.00s:  What happened to the poor soldier at 15 know.
3020.00s:  Why would he be in such poor shape compared to the soldier that's at 17 Jan 25 same strike.
3030.00s:  Ruin to the says IV less so IV in this instance.
3037.00s:  IV would have contracted a little bit so definitely wouldn't help, but that's not the primary thing.
3043.00s:  Theta you got it. That's exactly correct.
3046.00s:  So the problem is as we fast forward at time.
3050.00s:  This thing has been suffering theta decay.
3053.00s:  And because it's getting closer and closer to expiration, its theta decay is growing exponentially.
3059.00s:  Each day, this 15 know of 25 call is losing $6.70, whereas the 17 Jan 25 calls is losing $2.84.
3073.00s:  Significantly less.
3076.00s:  And this because it didn't have a big enough move fast enough, even though it did have a good move, it still wasn't enough in order for it to break through.
3088.00s:  And make money.
3091.00s:  This is the problem with short dated options is that you really need to move and you need to move quick.
3098.00s:  And this is why I like to use longer dated options.
3102.00s:  So this is exactly why I didn't go to 15 know of and it's exactly why I was out in 17 Jan and it's why I'm out in 17 April.
3110.00s:  And I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out in 17 Jan and I'm out
3140.00s:  And it's like, sure, like there absolutely was movement last week. I saw a couple posts on Superstank about it, but like you're already late, right? If you look at the depth of the move, most of it happened on the 28th.
3153.00s:  And if you're looking at the move from the course of last week, you are, I don't want to say a day late dollar short, but you're definitely late to the party.
3162.50s:  Because if you look at here, it went from 22 to 25, but if you look at here, it went from 20 to 25, right? So you miss about half the move by catching it last week.
3174.50s:  Now again, that's not saying top ticking bottom taking it's impossible. But these kinds of days on expanded, volume can't be ignored. That's all.
3183.82s:  And it's also a really important thing to note that just because volume spikes doesn't mean it goes up. There's a very specific reason why.
3192.50s:  I didn't get into it on the 25th and it literally did start breaking out, but it didn't go far enough for it to make sense. So all that does is gets added to a watch list for the next day.
3207.50s:  And then I say, what happens to the volume and does it actually start breaking out of the recent price action? And if so, then obviously I'm very interested. If not, then I am less interested.
3223.50s:  That's the way that I tend to look at this kind of thing because supply and demand always behaves in specific ways. It's not super predictable, but it does have tendencies that we can generally rely on.
3241.50s:  A car list as market makers will not let the price move up. They want your money playing call options is a good way to lose your money. That's not true. It's not true at all.
3251.50s:  Market makers make money by transactions.
3256.50s:  And they make money through your transactions by capturing the bid ask price. They can make a little bit more money if they're able to suppress price.
3269.50s:  But if you suppress price, then you have no movement. You have no movement. You have nobody that enters the stock.
3277.50s:  So it's really important again to try to remain objective. I'm not saying market makers are angels. I'm not saying market makers don't manipulate anything. I'm not saying any of that.
3287.50s:  But what I'm saying is that market makers do not have full control over the price of anything.
3295.50s:  It's a bit of a different context to remember. Again, we already talked about it at the beginning of the live stream. The probability of a market maker manipulating the price here to try to drive this down with their buddies is super fucking high. I would not put it past them at all.
3310.50s:  But there's also a reality that the market maker didn't stop this from going from 20 to 23. They didn't stop this from going from 22 to 23. They didn't stop this from going from 23 to 25.
3327.50s:  So the problem is is retail traders, especially retail traders that are not familiar with options. They get pissed off because they're losing money because they're making bad choices and they want to blame something or somebody.
3342.50s:  And it's just escapism. I just gave you an example. I can literally guarantee you that if this kind of thing happened here.
3354.50s:  On Reddit or somewhere like this. If that kind of thing happened.
3361.50s:  The redder.
3363.50s:  Would far more likely than not. Call manipulation on this. They would look at this and be like, oh, this is all rigged. This is all fully manipulated.
3375.50s:  And not understand that it's literally the way that their trade was built that it didn't that's why it didn't work.
3383.50s:  So yeah.
3385.50s:  Dan says, our case seems to know how to rig it in his favor. I don't think so. I generally don't think so.
3392.50s:  After we went through all of his trades from this, the overwhelming majority of his money didn't happen during these periods that we're talking about FTDs and cycles and stuff like that.
3405.50s:  The like if we look at the change in the portfolio value, the first massive jump is here and here.
3413.50s:  So in 2020, we had a 400% gain and then a 600% gain.
3418.50s:  And then in what is this 2020 in April, we had a 570% gain.
3425.50s:  And then if we take a look at down here in 21 during the squeeze, there was a massive gain on 27 Jan and then on 13 Jan.
3440.50s:  And then when he came back in 24, he was up 511% from where he left.
3447.50s:  And at this point, he went from 34 mil to 210.
3450.50s:  And then he went from 34 mil to 10.
3453.50s:  And then he went from 34 mil to 10.
3456.50s:  And then he went from 34 mil to 10.
3459.50s:  And then he went from 34 mil to 10.
3462.50s:  And then he went from 34 mil to 10.
3464.50s:  And then he went from 34 mil to 10.
3467.50s:  And then he went from 34 mil to 10.
3469.50s:  And then he went from 34 mil to 10.
3471.50s:  And then he went from 34 mil to 10.
3473.50s:  And then he went from 34 mil to 10.
3475.50s:  And then he went from 34 mil to 10.
3477.50s:  And then he went from 34 mil to 10.
3479.50s:  And then he went from 34 mil to 10.
3481.50s:  And then he went from 34 mil to 10.
3506.50s:  He went from 35 mil to 9.
3507.50s:  You have this way to rig the game in his favor as if we think that that's a common theory.
3515.62s:  You don't go through that because it decreases how much money you can make.
3518.98s:  It decreases how much pain you can put on the market makers, whatever you're, you know,
3523.18s:  whatever we think the incentive here is.
3527.42s:  So I don't think that there's a rent.
3530.30s:  He says his timing is time and pressure.
3532.18s:  I literally think that's it.
3534.14s:  The overwhelming majority of what we see here reflects that exact thing that it's building
3541.14s:  massive positions, having absolute zen-like ability to hold through incredible drawdowns.
3554.70s:  And again, I think the reason why he's able to do this is because this is money, a small
3559.02s:  amount of money that was put into a Yolo account into something that he could clearly see
3564.38s:  opportunity that he was significantly convicted and and ride the motherfucker out.
3569.66s:  And each time it started moving, he placed bigger and bigger bets and guess what he did.
3575.54s:  He didn't place bets with stock.
3578.34s:  The vast majority of his bets came through options and it's for the leverage.
3584.66s:  He used leveraged growth.
3588.06s:  That's exactly what you see here.
3590.98s:  Leveraged growth at work, which is, I don't know, I think that's really cool.
3596.42s:  Really, really need to see.
3599.78s:  But that is a very specific approach to making hundreds of millions of dollars that is wild.
3607.50s:  The portfolio volatility is fucking crazy.
3610.34s:  Literally is absolutely crazy.
3611.98s:  Very cool.
3612.98s:  But it's crazy.
3614.18s:  Like here, he went from $48 million here and he was down to $17 million here.
3624.82s:  Like to be able to just, eh, fuck it, hold through that.
3629.02s:  That's crazy.
3630.82s:  And that's exactly what he did.
3632.66s:  And then when he disappeared, he had 34.
3634.50s:  He came back with 210.
3636.46s:  Then he went from 210 to 590 down to 268.
3641.54s:  And really doubled his money and then undoubled his money.
3646.42s:  That's essentially what happened here.
3648.66s:  Fucking crazy.
3650.22s:  Very, very cool though.
3652.02s:  The whole thing is, I don't know, just fascinating.
3657.18s:  Look at which is what I want to spend the last part of the session today on actually
3662.86s:  is I want to go through some of these subs.
3666.50s:  And I want to start trying to pick up, like the primary, these, like I want to look at
3673.10s:  these DDs.
3675.42s:  Are these the right ones to look at?
3676.94s:  Yeah.
3677.94s:  I didn't know that this even exists.
3680.94s:  Whoa.
3682.74s:  What the fuck?
3688.54s:  What the fuck is this?
3694.42s:  What am I looking at?
3696.42s:  What are these?
3707.90s:  Are these sorted somehow?
3714.06s:  How do you sort them by popularity?
3718.62s:  What the fuck?
3725.62s:  Dog.
3733.62s:  This is fucking sick.
3736.62s:  God damn it.
3739.58s:  This is so cool.
3741.30s:  The fact that people took the time to build a fucking magazine rack with all this stuff
3748.58s:  in it.
3749.58s:  Oh my God.
3753.82s:  There's so much work to be done.
3756.90s:  All right.
3757.90s:  I guess we got to start from the oldest to newest.
3762.58s:  I guess we start here.
3766.42s:  This is cool as fuck.
3769.42s:  All right.
3770.42s:  I got to have my notes ready.
3776.82s:  You need like another tab.
3779.90s:  This will just be like, uh, do you mean notes?
3784.66s:  All right.
3786.46s:  Let's see.
3789.98s:  Dude, a fucking.
3794.26s:  Oh my God.
3797.42s:  This is so cool.
3800.30s:  This is literally so cool.
3802.38s:  The fact that somebody turned this into like a magazine series, this is some of the coolest
3808.26s:  shit about the fucking ape community.
3811.78s:  The fact that somebody does this is so fucking cool.
3816.86s:  No, there's not another stock that does this.
3819.90s:  You don't go to Apple and you don't go through that Apple DD.
3823.58s:  They literally took the time to make it a fucking library thing.
3828.38s:  Just the fact that they took the time to do this and to have a fucking crossword puzzle
3834.94s:  in here.
3835.94s:  That's so cool.
3837.94s:  Look at this thing.
3839.70s:  Oh, that's so awesome.
3843.94s:  That's so fucking awesome.
3845.14s:  All right.
3846.14s:  I love this.
3847.14s:  Can you go in between the different issues from here?
3850.06s:  Do you have to click out?
3853.94s:  This one.
3856.54s:  All right.
3860.94s:  Bring Zayevs in there.
3864.46s:  This is so cool.
3866.46s:  MSM bullshit.
3868.42s:  Ask clown Jim Kramer.
3870.54s:  Might have another note.
3874.54s:  That's so good.
3878.42s:  Ask clown Jim.
3882.42s:  I love these.
3885.78s:  This is so fun.
3887.74s:  Is that Lauer?
3888.74s:  That's our boy, Dave.
3889.74s:  I just did a podcast with him.
3890.90s:  I think he and I, we did a podcast last week together.
3894.50s:  A boy, Dave.
3898.14s:  How do you read this?
3906.70s:  What are the times?
3916.06s:  I'm confused.
3917.06s:  What do the times mean here?
3919.62s:  Is it just like picking something for like flow or is there a meaning to them?
3924.70s:  I never know.
3925.70s:  It's impossible to fucking know.
3929.50s:  Dave Lauer.
3930.50s:  Cool finance guy.
3932.50s:  That's awesome.
3934.02s:  This is so cool.
3937.02s:  Okay.
3938.02s:  Cool.
3939.02s:  Yeah.
3940.02s:  So it looks like they're just kind of building stuff bad guys.
3942.22s:  Here we go.
3943.22s:  Citadel, Melvin Susquana.
3945.46s:  0.72 virtue.
3947.22s:  Finra DTC.
3948.22s:  God.
3949.22s:  This is a long enemy list.
3950.62s:  Glacier capital or K.
3951.82s:  Ghost.
3952.82s:  Don't worry.
3953.82s:  Our K.
3954.82s:  Ghost got theirs.
3955.82s:  CMBC Wall Street Journal market watch Bloomberg.
3959.06s:  Okay.
3960.06s:  So all traditional finance media.
3962.06s:  Benzinga gets fucked.
3963.06s:  What did Benzinga do?
3965.34s:  Is there any history on that?
3967.86s:  Why don't we like Benzinga?
3970.10s:  I know people over at Benzinga.
3971.18s:  I think they're cool.
3972.90s:  Did they do something bad?
3977.94s:  Woman sex.
3979.94s:  Okay.
3980.94s:  Saturdays and Sundays.
3981.94s:  Wait.
3982.94s:  Oh, because the market's closed.
3983.94s:  That makes sense.
3984.94s:  Okay.
3985.94s:  All right.
3986.94s:  Who's their fucking haters?
3990.54s:  Oh, really?
3991.54s:  They.
3992.54s:  Bad articles on GME.
3994.14s:  Okay.
3995.34s:  Y'all gotta be.
3996.34s:  Y'all gotta be chill because it's.
3999.34s:  Well, it depends on who if it's like some of their contributors that are not part
4004.54s:  of Benzinga.
4005.74s:  That's a little bit different.
4009.94s:  Uh.
4017.14s:  Dude, I don't even know how they fucking make these.
4026.14s:  Look at that.
4028.14s:  Look at that.
4030.14s:  Ah.
4034.14s:  Look at this fucking dude's face.
4042.14s:  Oh, my fucking god.
4045.14s:  Dude.
4047.14s:  Yeah.
4051.14s:  London correspondent reports the lights run and buildings in Canary Wharf to do.
4056.14s:  This is.
4057.14s:  Yeah, that's Kramer.
4058.14s:  That's exactly who that was.
4059.14s:  Hold on.
4060.14s:  Let's go back to the front.
4062.14s:  That's Jim Kramer.
4068.14s:  Oh, it's.
4070.14s:  I'm not sure if it's a fucking classic.
4074.14s:  New CEO map for long is he ready for Moas?
4080.14s:  Okay.
4087.14s:  I see this is.
4090.14s:  Old school hyping a certain day.
4092.14s:  So hyping has been around since the fucking what 2021?
4101.14s:  Dude, this is incredible.
4104.14s:  This is literally I am loving this.
4109.14s:  Lucy commissar.
4112.14s:  Who the fuck is this?
4115.14s:  Who is this?
4119.14s:  Lucy.
4123.14s:  I'm a sir. Who are you?
4126.14s:  He's a journalist.
4132.14s:  I'm a critic.
4134.14s:  What's.
4136.14s:  You mean.
4153.14s:  Who was this?
4159.14s:  Who is this lady?
4167.14s:  You did an AMA.
4172.14s:  Okay.
4174.14s:  Lucy.
4177.14s:  Loret Dezzer as I like to go Ellie.
4186.14s:  Okay.
4189.14s:  Lucy.
4193.14s:  Loret Dezzer as I like to go Ellie.
4201.14s:  Okay. So we like her.
4204.14s:  I couldn't tell.
4205.14s:  I couldn't tell if this is good or bad what I was going to get into.
4210.14s:  Okay.
4211.14s:  Okay.
4212.14s:  So we're excited to have Lucy around.
4214.14s:  That's great.
4217.14s:  Okay.
4221.14s:  Talking about overthrowing dictators, which is fucking sick.
4227.14s:  Heyman islands.
4234.14s:  But what you're telling me is I don't understand is that offshore means secrecy.
4237.14s:  So you still have an offshore account in the U.S.
4240.14s:  Oh, I see what they mean.
4243.14s:  Yeah.
4244.14s:  That's absolutely a thing.
4246.14s:  That's really cool.
4250.14s:  Introductions exist all around.
4257.14s:  I mean, I don't.
4258.14s:  I actually don't agree with this.
4259.14s:  I mean, I literally think one of the elements of an offshore account is that it's like,
4263.14s:  literally offshore.
4264.14s:  I understand the power lines that she's using it in here, but
4269.34s:  because she's talking about the rights and privacy of different entities being formed in
4273.82s:  different places, which is completely true. It's why a big reason most people in the US,
4279.10s:  when we're forming LLCs and entities like that, we will form them in Delaware, Wyoming,
4284.62s:  those kinds of places. Delaware is really, really well known for their privacy.
4289.66s:  But that's still penetrable. It's not impenetrable. But by going offshore, it can become way more
4299.10s:  impenetrable, which is the nature of having offshore entities.
4304.30s:  Okay. Offshore system connected short selling. Oh, this is interesting. And it's about the
4322.70s:  Sedona story 20 years ago, Sedona software company, basing King of Prussia. Okay. Deal was
4330.14s:  vaset. Okay. Let's do us all a big favor. We'll take this whole thing. I'm going to throw it into
4339.82s:  chat GBT. I'm going to tell it to summarize this. I don't want to besmirch her work, but it's just a
4350.38s:  lot of fucking words. Okay. So let's see what she's talking about here. Sedona,
4359.10s:  Pennsylvania software company, sought funding, engaged investment banker, Michael, whatever the
4365.98s:  fuck owned by from a group of from a group owned by icon. That's interesting because what,
4377.26s:  there's a recent photo of Ryan Cohen with icon, isn't there? Pretty sure there is.
4383.66s:  That's an arranged 2.5 mil financing deal. Lenders would be repaid in shares. Okay.
4390.30s:  Depending on the strike price, that conversion, that's that spiral financing.
4397.26s:  Thomas, in Andreas, bait in advisors, intermediaries, leveraging an offshore fund,
4404.54s:  Amro International registered in Panama Beach, or in Panama, based in Zurich.
4409.90s:  He'll include it as social, questionable entities, yeast, I mean, it believes short setting.
4415.42s:  Sedona's contract prohibited shorting as it would depress stock prices, increase share
4420.46s:  issuance upon conversion. Despite this, bait and orchestrated aggressive short selling through
4427.82s:  brokers at Reffko fucking bastards, causing Sedona's stock to plummet from six to 10 cents within
4435.42s:  a month. Fucking hey. But that's, see, that's the problem with shorter float stuff because short float
4443.66s:  stuff can be manipulated much more easily, right? So taking something that's essentially a penny stock,
4450.14s:  right? 5, 6 bucks and taking it down into sub dollar is really not that crazy. So this makes sense.
4458.22s:  Manipulation accounted for 40% of the trades.
4465.26s:  Yep. Harm Sedona, loss business, secure new financing, turned SEC.
4472.06s:  Rowing City says seller boxing. This isn't seller boxing. The reason why this isn't seller boxing,
4477.90s:  at least from a functional standpoint, is a big part of seller boxing is you actually implement
4483.02s:  management that's complicit. So this based on what I'm seeing here, the management was not
4487.98s:  complicit. The management was trying to figure out what the fuck is going on and they're trying to
4493.18s:  fight back. So a bit different than seller boxing. Huh, who knew? Who fucking knew if we were going to
4508.30s:  take a screenshot or a clip from this, that's it right there because this is obviously earth shattering
4514.14s:  for everybody that's in attendance right now. The fact that major financial firms can enable
4521.90s:  fraudulent practices. Who would have guessed fucking caught me off guard here? That's crazed news
4529.18s:  to me, unbelievable as some might say. That's fucking hilarious.
4537.66s:  Oh, another one, another just bombshell that believe it or not guys, you might want to,
4544.70s:  I just stood up, but you guys might want to stand, sit down unless you have, you know,
4549.58s:  perneated this and stand up. But believe it or not, believe it or not, this is going to come as a
4555.74s:  surprise. Regulatory bodies such as the SEC and courts may not adequately
4566.06s:  protect victims. Could you believe that? I mean, shit. Here I am sitting here thinking that
4575.82s:  clearly financial firms would in no way enable fraudulent practices or that the SEC, they would
4583.10s:  perfectly protect us. This is crazy. I can't believe this. The SEC here I have, I've just held
4589.02s:  them in such high regard my entire life. And then I see this unbelievable. Despite rag shell,
4598.70s:  loopholes persist enabling practices like naked short selling later such as GameStop. This is
4604.86s:  fascinating. Wow, what a great fucking offshoot. This is so fun.
4617.74s:  Feels the deliver put out a paper saying only for us to trade on exchanges. That doesn't include
4626.54s:  the dark pools. West Christian told me that 1200 hedge funds offshore accounts were working
4632.78s:  through more than 150 broker dealer market makers to strip these small medium companies with
4636.94s:  a value with these desparal deals. Yep, super common. Okay, that's dramatic. But it's more common
4641.90s:  than people think this. I've spent a lot of time reading about this just out of general curiosity.
4662.86s:  Okay. Well, what's happened in that case and there's a lot about this was discovered
4673.82s:  bringing the cases federal court got to a certain level. Might be knocked out in certain cases,
4680.30s:  judge rule, SEC jurisdiction. Okay. You go to court, state court, demand document. Okay.
4687.26s:  Okay. Wow, this is neat. Okay. Let's grab this. Oh, wait, whoa, whoa, let's click this.
4711.10s:  Chatchy BT out here with the truth. Sorry to given us the loopholes.
4717.82s:  Rule implemented. Yees brokers are required to have reasonable grounds to believe that shares can
4723.18s:  be borrowed for delivery before allowing short sales. This is meant to prevent naked short selling
4730.06s:  where a short seller does not actually borrow the shows before selling them lead into provincial
4734.38s:  FTDs, FTDs, mandates, clearing agencies report them. Let's see the loopholes, grandfather clause.
4741.50s:  One of the most criticized elements was the initial grandfather clause, which exempted existing
4745.74s:  fields to deliver before implementation for mandatory closing requirements. This allowed large
4750.94s:  amounts of short positions to remain unresolved. Options market maker exemption. Market makers
4757.26s:  and options contracts were initially exempt from locate and delivery believe that they needed the
4762.14s:  flexibility to facilitate trading. This is one of the problems like this. I don't like.
4767.18s:  I under liquidity is important, but when it is the only guiding force for what we're doing,
4773.10s:  you lose transparency. It's kind of like the similar phrasing of anybody who I forgot the
4779.34s:  fucking who the fuck said this shit. It's something like anybody who over values, security over
4788.62s:  liberty deserves neither. Some shit like that. I think it's Benjamin Franklin at home. I forgot
4793.34s:  the exact saying, but it's something like that where if you prioritize security so much,
4799.02s:  and it essentially becomes an infringement on liberty. So that's kind of what I see here.
4809.18s:  Exemption was exploiting allowing market makers to create synthetic short positions. Same oversight.
4813.42s:  Yep. Off exchange transactions. Right show. Primarily focused on public exchanges did not cover
4820.22s:  dark pools and then extended settlement periods. Short sellers could extend the settlement period
4826.86s:  or create complex trading structures to delay the closing out of fails to deliver, which we know.
4833.18s:  This allowed them to prolong positions without actually delivering the shares. Yep, we know
4836.70s:  that they do this. So oh, wait, grandfather, close was gone. This is hilarious.
4844.30s:  So there's a lot of fucking loopholes and there's a lot of not plugging of the loop. If this was a
4851.74s:  boat, it's at the bottom of the fucking water, which is hilarious because if this was a boat,
4857.10s:  my guess is these loopholes would be fucking plugged a lot better than this. Just love that.
4863.02s:  That is epic. All right, let's go to part two.
4867.18s:  Okay.
4880.94s:  Bottom line two questions. Do you believe major media outlets have been compromised,
4885.02s:  compromised in what a lot of financial reporters do is rewrite press releases? Yep, that's normal.
4892.54s:  All right, I'm going to just grab all this.
4896.94s:  Wow.
4908.38s:  This is another great one.
4913.02s:  How did Rick show impact the game stop? Yo, chat GPT is the suggestions that it has are on
4919.58s:  the floor.
4920.70s:  Extreme short interest, negative short selling. Yep.
4924.30s:  Fails to deliver. Yep, loopholes. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Okay, here we go.
4932.22s:  Exposed challenges and fully enforcing reg show, especially in the case of highly shorted
4937.02s:  stocks and under conditions of extreme market volatility demonstrated that certain participants
4942.54s:  could still find ways to engage in or benefit from manipulative short selling.
4947.90s:  And calls for increased transparency, which we haven't got.
4953.98s:  Yo, I can't even get my next question out because of all these suggestions are literally perfect.
4960.54s:  List SEC reforms after a reg show.
4964.06s:  Grandfather clauses gone options market maker exemption gone closeout rule.
4969.58s:  Two or four introduced to closeout FTDs mandated brokers must close out FTDs.
4977.74s:  By the beginning of regular trading hours on the settlement day after failure occurred to
4981.98s:  Pulse 4. It failure persisted that broke Ruby restricted for making further short sales
4987.26s:  without first borrowing or ranging to borrow the security. That's actually kind of interesting.
4991.10s:  Because if you think of this as a forcing function, it's actually not really a forcing
4997.10s:  fund. Because all it says is that you can't short more. It doesn't, it's not saying you have to
5003.58s:  close out your existing shorts. Which that's a little bit interesting. And short sale circuit breaker,
5017.74s:  short selling stock price falls by 10% or more in a day, transparency, that's execution.
5027.02s:  SEC proposed regulation best execution is sure that brokers meet their duty to seek best
5030.86s:  execution for the customers orders, which we know they do not do. This is from something like
5035.74s:  payment for order flow. We know for a fact this doesn't happen. This proposal reflects a broader
5040.06s:  commitment to improving the integrity, transparency, and trading environment, including short selling
5044.14s:  practices. Okay. Requires certain market participants to disclose more detailed information about
5051.02s:  short sales. Public reports on aggregate short positions. And oh, that's interesting.
5058.86s:  Enhanced focused on FTDs, increased scrutiny on FTD in the use of dark pools, text,
5066.30s:  huge short sales. That's cool. The focus was on ensuring that rules surrounding settlement
5069.98s:  transparencies were being adhered to. I like that. Technology data and it'll like,
5076.38s:  sub-editor track trading practices. That's interesting. Okay. Summarize this.
5086.70s:  I was wondering what kind of theories and stuff that we were going to be focusing on. But I
5090.78s:  can already tell you the very first thing that we are going to be focusing on is going through
5097.50s:  all of these. Because I'm super interested in them. And my guess is a lot of the DD that I want to
5107.98s:  learn about is going to be baked into this. Okay.
5129.02s:  Uh, GPT, what do you say? All right, here we go.
5132.70s:  How customers can discern between trusted and compromised media outlets. Okay.
5141.74s:  Lucy emphasizes verifying claims with documented evidence and maintaining a record of media
5146.14s:  accuracy over time. Mainstream media such as CNBC may not always be reliable.
5153.26s:  Communities like Superstung provide valuable data based analysis off and more informative. Yep. Okay.
5162.62s:  Yeah.
5164.62s:  Complex options strategies to create phantom shares by inflating the number of shares shorted without
5169.74s:  actual delivery. That's interesting. Explain number four more.
5184.78s:  Brokers and hedge funds use complex options strategies to synthetically create shares that do
5190.62s:  not exist, such as buying shares while simultaneously selling calls or puts. These trades allow
5196.54s:  participants to create synthetic long that can be lent out as if it were the real stock that's
5201.42s:  facilitating short shares without the actual underlying shares. Buying right, buy right transactions
5207.34s:  and resetting obligations, buys the security sells a call on the security allows the trader to use
5213.02s:  the bought shares to cover a short position while simultaneously creating a new delivery obligation
5217.66s:  through the call option. That's fucking super smart. Effectively bypassing the standard settlement
5225.34s:  requirements of T plus two. Damn. Good question. How well understood are these things by people like
5237.74s:  in the community writ large? Like I'm curious.
5246.22s:  T.C.M. King says this is why cycles happen sort of. I actually don't fully agree with that.
5251.50s:  The reason why I don't fully agree with that is because by going through this synthetic
5256.78s:  process, it essentially means that like this can be done into perpetuity.
5263.02s:  Right? So it would actually be the antithesis of cycles because by doing this, they get themselves
5272.54s:  out of T plus two. And by being out of T plus two, they no longer are constricted. They
5281.34s:  have used this loophole to locate. So the problem is, with these loopholes that literally
5291.50s:  give them ability to do essentially synthetic locating, it essentially gets rid of
5299.90s:  the cycle theory because there wouldn't be a cycle because they're not beholden to the time frames.
5307.34s:  Evene de Griggs says, been aware of this for three years, but I'm curious like
5312.62s:  to the depth. Like what is the overall depth that people understand this stuff?
5318.38s:  All Putin says T plus two is no more. That's correct. That was revised recently. We actually talked
5325.50s:  about this. FDDs sold by settlement date. Yep.
5336.94s:  regulatory bodies has the CDAG taken limited action. Yeah, we know. They don't fucking care.
5342.70s:  Okay, now part three.
5347.66s:  So let's see.
5364.38s:  Let's see.
5374.38s:  Sedric says not deep in depth besides a couple of DD writers.
5379.10s:  Titi says back when DD was actively being done, people posted videos on the DD people
5383.54s:  went in depth explaining the DD basically died.
5386.62s:  Why did the DD die?
5387.62s:  I don't understand that.
5388.82s:  With so many people looking at this, to me, it seems like it would just be really logical
5393.54s:  that it would move closer and closer to viable information that everybody could then probably
5399.14s:  make money off of.
5400.74s:  So why they got bored.
5403.14s:  Okay.
5404.14s:  Yeah.
5405.14s:  I could see that.
5406.14s:  That's actually one of my superpowers.
5407.34s:  Honestly, it's like when I start doing shit, I just keep doing it, whether I'm bored or
5410.82s:  not.
5411.82s:  So but I can totally understand how people could get bored.
5415.90s:  TCM says most of the community believes that short interest is much greater than reported.
5421.10s:  The rest of the whole OS is that short interest is still very, very high.
5424.46s:  I got it.
5425.46s:  Okay.
5426.46s:  So it's still the real emphasis on a squeeze versus just game stop going up.
5431.10s:  Okay.
5432.10s:  Yes, we know this.
5437.30s:  Media's role.
5438.62s:  We know this.
5441.82s:  They know what occurs in regulated spaces, but like transparency in off exchange.
5449.30s:  Okay.
5450.30s:  Consider it adopting a system of unique numerical identifiers for each share known as hard locate
5456.10s:  to prevent repeated shorting of the same shares.
5458.26s:  That's cool.
5460.46s:  That's also interesting that it was rejected.
5462.50s:  I don't know why.
5464.62s:  Why would that have been rejected, guys?
5466.66s:  Any ideas?
5467.66s:  Manipulation by overstock in 04.
5477.62s:  I don't hear this reference much.
5479.94s:  I hear people reference like, what is it?
5484.66s:  Volkswagen?
5486.18s:  Is that it?
5488.42s:  I there's another reference I hear all the time.
5492.66s:  Some are tactics used.
5500.18s:  Yeah.
5501.18s:  I don't hear many people talk about overstock.
5506.54s:  I hear people talk about overstock.
5513.54s:  Yeah.
5514.54s:  A lot of research.
5516.54s:  And she's coming out with the book.
5517.54s:  That's cool.
5518.54s:  Is anybody ever read the book?
5519.54s:  I assume her books out.
5520.54s:  I assume that this is pretty old.
5523.54s:  Huh.
5527.54s:  Fascinating.
5529.54s:  That was very cool.
5530.54s:  All right.
5531.54s:  Let's get back to this.
5532.54s:  They'll got a couple minutes left.
5542.54s:  All right.
5546.54s:  Who's this guy?
5551.54s:  Alex.
5554.54s:  Oh, he is on a live.
5581.54s:  What?
5584.54s:  Because own life.
5586.54s:  June mistakenly believing he lost 750K in Robin Hood.
5605.54s:  I mean, it's fucked up.
5609.54s:  It's fucked up that their platform was off.
5615.54s:  But it's still my guess is just there is probably something not.
5620.54s:  Not okay with him.
5624.54s:  Because that's still that's a massive leap, bro.
5626.54s:  You just declare bankruptcy, right?
5628.54s:  Like if you're so far.
5631.54s:  If you're so far underwater, you can declare bankruptcy.
5634.54s:  Get your debt absolved.
5638.54s:  There's terms to it.
5640.54s:  But all I'm saying is I just this strikes me as somebody who wasn't in a clear frame of mind.
5646.54s:  Obviously seeing something as stressful as that can put you out of a frame of mind.
5649.54s:  And it sucks that fucking Robin Hood their app essentially led to that, which is fucking awful.
5658.54s:  But.
5666.54s:  Yeah.
5674.54s:  And what what did you guys know what the trade was?
5692.54s:  Things like that.
5694.54s:  Same thing hand correctly as sign more money than I should have my bought.
5700.54s:  I more money than I shoulda.
5702.54s:  My bot puts.
5705.54s:  I have covered the puts I sold.
5709.54s:  I don't understand this.
5713.54s:  If this.
5714.54s:  is family, I'm not trying to talk trash, I just try to look at stuff objectively. And
5718.90s:  if you have a bunch of short puts, that's like way oversized and you're not ready to see
5725.46s:  the account move, even if you know, this looks like bullshit.
5729.18s:  Man, it just, it strikes me somebody like this shouldn't trade. Like that's, that's
5735.82s:  what I see is like somebody with this kind of temperament shouldn't trade.
5740.98s:  Thanks for reaching out, want to let you know that we're getting back to you as soon as possible.
5748.22s:  Okay.
5751.46s:  Later that day.
5754.18s:  Oh, so this was impulsive as fuck too.
5758.70s:  So this was it happened the night before, got in touch the next day, they said they would follow up.
5763.98s:  And then that same day, he did this.
5767.22s:  Fuck man.
5780.74s:  Oh, that's fucking awful just across the fucking board. Damn, man. That sucks.
5787.50s:  Yep, this makes sense, right? Like he should not have been trading. He definitely should not have been trading options.
5803.58s:  That's, there's no doubt about any of that.
5809.50s:  But that's crazy. Fuck that's.
5818.50s:  In a note to his parents, how was a 20 year old with no income able to get a sign almost 1 million worth of leverage?
5825.82s:  The puts I sold, I bought, Sess shows should have canceled out, but I also have no clue what I was doing now on hindsight.
5832.58s:  Yeah, man, like, this is tricky because I really believe that people should be responsible for what they do.
5842.82s:  And like if he's doing this and he doesn't know what he's doing, like,
5851.70s:  yeah,
5854.10s:  there was no intention to be assigned this much and take this much risk. And I only thought I was thinking about the money that I actually owned.
5860.94s:  I don't know.
5868.02s:  Ranty, he says, no, he didn't mess it up. Robinhood messed it up. No, I mean, he did too. Again, I'm not, I'm not saying anything disrespectful towards him.
5876.74s:  This is just an objective analysis, like the thing that he messed up was this, but I also have no clue what I was doing now on hindsight.
5885.86s:  Right. So if you're trading derivatives, which are leveraged products and you say you have no clue what you're doing, like you are absolutely partially responsible for the thing.
5897.78s:  Now this is obviously a permissions issue, but again, this permissions issue being wrong doesn't force him to use options.
5908.10s:  So this is their bad for having this wrong. And you can see that they have it wrong. Where was it up here for lots of people, hundreds of people, they fucked that up for you guys know I hate Robinhood.
5920.86s:  I'm not defending Robinhood. I fucking hate Robinhood.
5924.02s:  But I just there's there's layers to this and it's not just Robinhood's fault that this happened.
5930.94s:  Where is it this 600 examples of Robinhood customers who shouldn't have been approved for options trading. So yeah, like they completely fucked up.
5946.06s:  But God, that sucks. That really, really sucks.
5960.98s:  But like this is really tricky, right? Because this essentially,
5968.38s:  this is essentially saying, I don't know, again, like I'm really a massive advocate of personal autonomy.
5975.38s:  And this essentially means that somebody else needed to do something for him to make a different choice there, which again, it's not unfair to say that.
5984.10s:  But I would just love so much more if he felt more comfortable and confident with what he was doing.
5990.46s:  So it's one of the reasons it's why we do these videos. It's literally why I spend time doing shit. I don't think of this deep of a scenario most frequently to be completely honest.
6000.18s:  But I do think about the the strife and strain a lot of people go through learning about options and losing money that they don't have to lose because I've been there. I know what that's like.
6012.62s:  So that I really, I really agree with. Yeah, crazy.
6018.82s:  Okay.
6026.86s:  These are very cool. I'm learning a lot of stuff. I'm going to get through the rest of this row. And then I'm going to pop off and go grab dinner.
6035.42s:  We're having our chef tonight made us chicken parm. I'm actually pretty stoked on that.
6042.82s:  Let's see.
6049.82s:  Do diamond hands work in zero gravity. That is fucking awesome. Oh, that's classic.
6058.82s:  I love that.
6061.82s:  Let's see. When moon.
6064.82s:  Is this an actual picture of RC or these I can't tell if they're like doing stuff to make these pictures or not.
6075.82s:  Okay. So this is actually a picture from that's awesome. It's fucking hilarious.
6083.82s:  How much fuel is in this rocket to the moon?
6089.82s:  Why did they stop doing these? These are so awesome.
6094.82s:  Look at this. You get a personal personal rocket career. How great is that?
6115.82s:  Oh, did I just do this one?
6122.82s:  Good old Dave Lauer.
6126.82s:  The homey.
6136.82s:  Interesting. All right. I'm not ready to be done.
6139.82s:  I was hoping to find like another thing I need to look at a lot of stuff about for a long.
6150.82s:  March call.
6152.82s:  I'm not ready to do this.
6164.82s:  Oh, Newton hit us up.
6173.82s:  I found the DD library from super.
6177.82s:  This is awesome.
6186.82s:  That's another thing that I absolutely just love about GameStop is that it introduced me to Newton and Newton and I are very different people.
6196.82s:  But he is such. He's just such a great guy and it's so fun to bullshit with him and to think like our entire relationship in general is based on fucking the stock.
6212.82s:  And he and I we had some really interesting conversations about like religion because you guys know he's like super religious.
6219.82s:  And what that's one of my favorite things about he and I because when it comes to like belief systems, we are like polar opposites because he's not just religious in like a standard, you know, like kind of religion.
6235.82s:  Like the type of beliefs that he has with his religion are like very specific and they're a little I don't want to call it extreme. That's dramatic.
6244.82s:  And that doesn't convey the correct point, but they're like more I don't want to call it strict, not strict either. I don't know the word to use here, but it's like there's more to it than like standard.
6256.82s:  Yeah, thank you.
6257.82s:  Rowing to the perfect. Thank you, rigid. That's the word. Thank you.
6260.82s:  They're more rigid and the like the belief system is very rigid.
6267.82s:  And I am very much a libertarian. Like I want everybody to believe and do what they want.
6275.82s:  And a big part of his belief system is that he thinks everybody should be and believe the setup that he has.
6284.82s:  But the way that he believes that is so different because it's not like a missionary style like go convince people.
6290.82s:  Right. It's still let other people be their thing. It's just one of the one of the coolest things ever.
6299.82s:  Rowing to the says, what does libertarian have to do with religion? I use libertarian not in the context of a political party.
6306.82s:  But libertarian is a belief system and a big element of a belief system is that like if somebody came to me and they said like Eric, should I be Muslim or should I be Christian?
6318.82s:  I would not say you should be Muslim or Christian. I would say you should be what you want to be.
6325.82s:  Whereas somebody that's from a more strict faith, they would say something like you should be blank, whatever blank is.
6336.82s:  Because they obviously genuinely believe that that person should be whatever blank is.
6344.82s:  But his brother approached to it is really interesting, right?
6350.82s:  Because Sadrik says he doesn't give a shit what you think or do. That's and that's the cool part, right?
6355.82s:  Is that he that's exactly right. He has his own belief system that's very rigid.
6361.82s:  But he's still so open, which is really cool. Because he and I spend a little while talking about beliefs.
6369.82s:  And it was just a really fun conversation. We both really enjoyed it.
6374.82s:  I take coming up.
6378.82s:  Celebrate the fulfillment, Reno Nevada, classic Reno 9-1-1 memes.
6383.82s:  Cool.
6386.82s:  That was that one. Wait, did I skip a row?
6391.82s:  I didn't.
6400.82s:  Close up. I love all the fucking GME Apollo program.
6406.82s:  The breakening.
6413.82s:  I love all the 69 Lego memes. That Lawrence says he puts out positive vibes. I appreciate that massively positive vibes.
6421.82s:  The other thing I love about him is that whenever we talk, it's like an exchange of ideas.
6428.82s:  And it's not like all these superficial things. It's actually more cerebral thoughts, which is fucking awesome.
6435.82s:  You don't find a lot of people that are like that, to be honest.
6438.82s:  That's not to say people aren't cerebral. People definitely are.
6441.82s:  There's a lot of people that are super smart.
6444.82s:  But to find people that are like truly self reflective is completely different.
6452.82s:  Real intentions unclear. I thought he was just kidding, but he was being serious.
6459.82s:  Oh, this is perfect. Be excellent to each other. We're literally just talking about that.
6467.82s:  No.
6470.82s:  Both of these should be okay.
6475.82s:  Both of these should be okay.
6480.82s:  Damn. I just got straight up out of here. This magazine got me nuts.
6493.82s:  I'm holding Jordan Holberg.
6500.82s:  Look at this cat.
6507.82s:  Only you can prevent naked shirts.
6510.82s:  I like a butterfly hold like a bee.
6513.82s:  I'm not sure if it's a butterfly hold.
6518.82s:  I'm not sure if it's a butterfly hold.
6523.82s:  I'm not sure if it's a butterfly hold.
