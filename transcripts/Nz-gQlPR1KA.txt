0.00s: How I grew my trading account from just $3,000 back when I was in high school to over
9.20s: $1 million today over the course of 14 full trading years, 15 partial.
14.96s: What's up everybody? Eric here. I'm going to walk you through four things.
18.96s: And I think these four things, if you take them seriously, have the capacity to completely
24.84s: change the outlook of your trading portfolio and your future wealth.
29.96s: So I want to walk through these four things and at the end, I explicitly want to dive
34.84s: into some of the other important investing asset classes that have helped me seriously
41.16s: compound my growth. All right, so first off, save aggressively. This cannot be overstated
46.44s: early on and it is because the power of compounding interest is amplified by the principal
51.84s: amount of money you have to start. So I want to walk you through visually. This is from
57.44s: investor.gov and I'm taking an initial principle of $3,000 and I'm forecasting it out over 15
66.80s: years and in this scenario, we're adding $0. So that $3,000 at 12% return, which is essentially
76.08s: an average market return over the course of 15 years will net you $16,420. Sounds pretty
84.40s: lame. I agree. Next, we have the same exact scenario. However, now we're adding just $100
93.12s: a month. That's it. $100 a month. Theme everything else takes you from $16,420. Now to 61,15
105.08s: $156. That's just an additional $100 a month. I think you're starting to get the idea here. However,
113.80s: I don't know about you, but I don't consider $61,000, swimming in money or really two aspirational.
121.72s: So let's amp this up a little bit. Again, everything else is exactly the same. However, now instead
128.84s: of doing $100 a month, we're doing 1,000 and our future value is $463,000, half a million. Now,
138.44s: I want you to take a step back. If you saw the $100 and you're like, yeah, okay, super doable. Let's
144.76s: do that. And then you see the thousand. You're like, whoa, way too much money. Don't sweat that.
150.12s: The reason I say don't sweat that is your savings rate should change as you expand and grow in your
158.52s: roles at work, ideally, until you're able to do whatever the fuck else you want. But as you grow
165.24s: in your salary, this is essentially just an average. So early on, I was not putting $1,000 into my
174.60s: account. I was literally would have been a third of the entire account that I saved from my entire
179.56s: life up until when I first started. But if I averaged out my contributions, then we start to have
187.40s: a different conversation. So I want to show you one other of these before we move on. And this one
192.36s: is if we start saving $2500 a month, I just want to show you that at a $3,000 principle, if you put
202.12s: in $2,500 per month, again, at 12% interest, you're a millionaire in 15 years. So this again, might be
209.96s: a little aspirational for people, but the point being is you might not just be starting with $3,000.
215.80s: All I want to show you is with a low principle amount, but consistent contributions can make a
222.20s: humongous difference over our outlook. Okay, cool. Next thing on this is take risk. So we now know
230.20s: we have to save aggressively, but what do we need to do with that principle in order to make money?
234.92s: You got to take some risk. So on the right hand side of this, this is just another compound return
241.56s: calculator. I have the same setup as before. However, here's the difference. We're not adding in any
249.56s: additional money, but I slashed the rate of return from 12% down to 6%. So this is that a 6% return.
260.76s: Same everything else. And notice we walk out with $7,200. However, at a 12% return, I want you to
269.96s: notice something very important. We more than double. So even though this is only double the rate
278.20s: of return from 6 to 12%, which is still 12% market average, depending on what time frame you pick,
284.44s: but we've more than doubled the future value. That is compounding returns working away. If you are
291.48s: young, you should be open to risk. I truly wish I was more receptive to risk. Now, once you decide to
299.40s: start getting in, that's for passive investors. If you want a passive invest, that's a great way
304.44s: to go. But if you're interested in really accelerating this time frame in a pretty big way,
309.96s: we got to get a little more active. So this is where these things come into play. On the left hand
315.24s: side is my trading plan. On the right hand side is actually a snapshot from a bunch of back testing
320.52s: that I'm doing right now. You got to start tracking this stuff. So if you decide to start trying to
326.44s: trade actively, I have a couple videos that will be of extremely used to you on trading plans,
332.76s: trading logs, strategy outlines, how to get documentation and good notes so that you can become a
339.00s: better trader and ultimately find yourself closer to this kind of thing. This on the bottom left hand
345.96s: side is taking an initial principle of $3,000 again 15 years ago. We're adding $1,500 per month. However,
356.20s: the return is 22%. How did I pick 22%? Well, my compound annual growth rate right now over the
363.88s: last 14 years is 22.8%. So this is an unlimitedly and very achievable rate of return for people who
373.16s: take this seriously. If you have asset, you will not even beat the market. You probably won't even
378.28s: be profitable. But if you take it seriously, I am nothing special. I've done nothing special. I'm
384.12s: not that smart. So if I can get to something like this, other people most certainly can. I'm not in
389.80s: the US investing championships like Markman of Variety with 300% returns on a year. That's not what
396.36s: this is. This is steady, consistent returns over a moderate period of time with relatively moderate
403.16s: savings. Again, relative to where you're at in your career progression. And if you'll notice on
407.88s: this alone without touching anything else, we're at 1.6 million. Now notice how this is about investing in
415.48s: various assets. This is a wire in that I got this year from a rental property that I sold.
422.92s: This is why spreading into other asset classes is super important when it becomes available to you.
429.64s: So this is why I got into things like angel investing real estate. Like you see here with rental
434.36s: properties, but also selling the properties when it makes sense to me. So by using your capital
439.96s: in different areas, you get to take advantage of different market conditions and make Buku bucks.
445.48s: Get out there, make some money. Money cannot buy you happiness. Poverty can't buy you shit.
451.24s: So make some money. You'll probably be happier. Until next time, be an outlier. If you enjoyed the
