0.52s: what's up outliar time for your weekly
2.68s: GameStop update and things look rough
6.92s: around the edges it is what it is but
8.76s: let's talk about it so first things
10.92s: first we can see that price is
13.52s: continuing to drift down we saw this
15.60s: pretty big down move on the 10th we saw
19.04s: yesterday on the 11th a slight recovery
22.84s: and then today it actually gapped up it
25.48s: had a a decent start to the day but then
27.64s: it rallied back down so GameStop is
30.20s: hovering in this next general value area
34.56s: and this move down here does surprise me
37.32s: a little bit but it's not anything too
39.20s: crazy I think that it's a little bit
41.92s: early to tell um where this next trading
45.52s: range is going to be established but I
47.72s: do think it's super important to
49.20s: remember about GameStop is that right
52.32s: now part of what you're seeing is really
55.28s: also due to the broader Market the
56.80s: broader Market is going through a
59.56s: massive
60.56s: undertones of change and what I mean by
62.64s: that is if we take a look at small caps
64.60s: just for a more like comparison and
67.96s: let's just take a look at the size of
69.28s: the move from this most recent decline
72.44s: this represents a 133% drop that's not
75.68s: even using the highs from over here
79.84s: which represents more like a 20% drop so
84.04s: the market is struggling now I do think
87.72s: small caps aren't the exact right
89.28s: comparison for Gamestop cuz it's a
90.72s: little bit more like a midcap with all
92.16s: the cash that it has but the broader
94.76s: point is it's going to be a little more
96.36s: volatile than something like the s&p500
98.12s: and that's very much what we've seen
100.84s: it's it's had a pretty big down move but
103.44s: if we take a look at this most recent
104.96s: down move down 24% so it's almost double
108.64s: that of what we saw from iwm and then if
112.72s: we take it from the highs to where it
114.96s: sits now this represents a
117.92s: 36% decline so the majority of this move
121.68s: that we're seeing is really accelerating
124.72s: from this point in time so what does
127.48s: this mean for GameStop well it means
129.52s: first we really have a pretty big
131.28s: earnings coming up that's slated for the
133.96s: 25th of March after the close and if we
136.40s: take a look at the options chain really
138.56s: fast to just kind of vet if that makes
141.64s: sense for the 25th of March we can see
143.88s: that the volatility reflects it because
146.04s: the 28 March expiration is at 105%
150.04s: volatility where is the primary
151.60s: expiration before it is at
153.68s: 83.6 so definitely pricing and earnings
156.68s: for this 28 March expiration we're still
159.68s: maintaining really really heavy call
162.12s: skew as per usual now what I want to do
164.12s: is see how we're positioned though for
165.68s: this earnings event and it's very
168.60s: bullish 36
171.32s: 36,7 14 calls against 9742 on the put
175.36s: side which is pretty significant
176.96s: especially for a non-standard expiration
180.04s: to have that kind of skew the next
181.64s: primary expiration 21 March is at
183.88s: 999,000 against 26 and then this front
187.44s: is at 90 against 20 so 21 March and 14
191.68s: March are about the same 28 March will
193.44s: be the next big thing to take a look at
196.16s: with earnings coming up the volatility
198.64s: picture looks very similar across the
200.36s: board there is a little bit of contango
202.64s: and backwardation mixed in across the
204.48s: terms now a quick update however on the
208.56s: coverage strangle position this was
210.80s: asked and I definitely owe you all an
213.00s: update one because this is the exact
214.96s: kind of Market that's worth discussing
217.16s: this strategy so uh before I show you
220.36s: that I want to show you what it all
222.44s: looks like so this is the position as it
224.52s: sits I've loaded it in again this is a
226.88s: pass through IRA account this isn't my
228.64s: actual account but I use it to show
231.00s: everything to keep the Account Details
232.68s: off but this is the position that I have
235.00s: on right now you can see we're long 250
237.60s: shares at 2821 we're short five of the
241.12s: 17 April 23 puts which are going to be
243.40s: topical here we're short two of the 21
247.04s: strike puts for $153 same expiration 17
250.92s: April and then also 17 April this is a
252.96s: recent change from I think yesterday or
255.04s: the day before where we took down some
258.20s: of the prior calls and now we offered
261.32s: two of the 28s now the 28s effectively
265.72s: are like in the money meaning they are
268.12s: below my basis and that's something I
271.12s: have to monitor pretty carefully because
273.04s: I have no intention of allowing these to
274.88s: be assigned there but I sold them there
277.88s: because I'm trying to collect a little
279.48s: bit more money with this suppression and
282.76s: you can see that the basis of my long
284.76s: shares is still 2821 so if we take a
287.88s: look at the overall utilization that
289.92s: we're sitting at it's actually moved up
292.60s: to 91% because I've added these the
295.24s: reason why I've added these is because
297.60s: my expectation is is when I go to roll
302.80s: these that I'm probably going to try and
306.08s: decrease the size using some of the
308.24s: accounting for these new puts that I
310.28s: offered here so that I can start freeing
312.56s: up a little bit of money to buy shares
314.24s: outright because with us being 30% off
317.72s: of Peaks there I would love to grab at
319.68s: least another 50 if not another 100
321.60s: shares with us down here in the low 20s
325.64s: but I still need the underlying to
327.72s: stabilize before I would start buying in
330.36s: any significant volume and again this is
332.32s: all relative to the small position I
333.88s: have earmarked here which is a $25,000
336.60s: allocation now one super important note
340.52s: if we take a look at the performance of
342.04s: GameStop from the start of this exercise
344.84s: is at 2431 now it's at 21.99 that
347.40s: represents a 9.5% decline from the entry
350.44s: if we take a look at the return on
353.00s: invested Capital this includes the total
355.80s: p&l the total p&l of the position that I
358.80s: have as it sits to today is still
361.96s: profitable how is it profitable that
364.76s: from when I first started trading this
366.28s: position the stock has gone down 9 and a
367.96s: half% and this is a long Delta strategy
370.96s: well it's for two reasons one because of
372.48s: the short puts and how much volatility
375.08s: I'm able to collect from these there're
377.32s: super high volatility trades the second
380.44s: thing is if we take a look at the call
383.92s: side again they're not making a bunch of
386.04s: money but they're also not making
387.40s: nothing so the short call side the
389.80s: equation is still producing a source of
392.32s: returns for GameStop so even though the
395.64s: underlying itself is definitely
397.16s: struggling at the time of the position
399.00s: my position is literally up money now I
403.56s: did choose to roll these so you can see
406.92s: I took it from the 25s to the 23s these
410.00s: came down for a small debit 205 bucks I
413.64s: could just write that off as you know
415.64s: just taking the trade down putting up a
417.04s: new one here it doesn't really matter
418.92s: but just so that you understand that the
420.44s: accounting here is
422.68s: otherwise differentiated in my mind it
425.44s: is technically a roll from this
427.92s: position so now let's take a look at
431.24s: what's been going on in GameStop under
433.40s: the hood I haven't seen any sort of
435.88s: significant news breaking anything like
438.04s: that if we take a look at the options
440.12s: Chain Looking Back over the last 7 days
442.72s: I mean it's literally a nemic we're
444.76s: seeing the lightest premiums that
446.96s: effectively I've ever seen so game
449.52s: GameStop is about as quiet as it can get
453.80s: from an options perspective and then if
456.04s: we take a look at what uh that's the
458.20s: wrong one if we take a look at what the
461.16s: net flows represent in
465.40s: GameStop you'll notice a couple key
467.84s: trends specifically we did see a small
471.56s: spike in call flows yesterday but the
474.72s: majority of it has been net negative on
477.08s: the call side meaning people selling
478.68s: calls and this isn't inherently a bad
481.60s: thing this is also a lot of people that
483.52s: have positions that are just selling
487.52s: calls against their long shares and it's
491.08s: a pretty smart thing to do when the
492.80s: underlying is churning down like this so
496.48s: if we take a look at the last couple
498.88s: things related to GameStop there's still
502.40s: this conjecture about GameStop's
506.20s: involvement in Bitcoin but there's
508.88s: really nothing that's been very
511.44s: confirmed as of yet we can also see
516.20s: across this that I thought was that like
518.12s: pretty interesting from last month where
520.76s: there was an expansion of positioning in
524.12s: GameStop by a lot of these large funds
526.00s: like Black Rock Morgan Stanley Goldman
527.84s: Sachs these all came through uh the 17th
531.76s: of Feb is when they were reported but I
534.04s: find that to be pretty interesting given
537.40s: the price behavior of GameStop s so the
541.56s: last thing I'll note is I think earnings
546.40s: is the next big thing that's on the
548.92s: table and I don't really have these
551.08s: grandor expectations of earnings because
553.20s: it's really going through a broader cost
554.88s: cutting cycle right now so the
556.72s: probability of these being some great
558.36s: incredible earnings is very low but that
560.72s: doesn't mean that we might not at least
562.76s: get some sort of hint of what's going on
566.32s: I hope with the cash that they have
568.64s: although I'm not expecting it as of this
570.40s: point but it would be a great surprise
572.80s: so it's a bit of sit and wait manage the
576.04s: positions no issues with any of them I'm
578.08s: in a great spot with the coverage
579.32s: strangle I think that right now is a
581.96s: great time to continue trading
583.64s: especially short premium strategies and
586.40s: we will see where the next trading range
588.80s: is between that and earnings that's what
590.56s: I'm keeping an eyeball on as always if
592.68s: there's anything you would like me to
594.00s: take a look at let me know be an outlier
595.84s: I'll see you later
