1.04s: let's talk about the wheel versus my
3.52s: favorite the coverage strangle i wanted
5.36s: to show you an example of why i tend to
8.24s: prefer the coverage strangle not saying
10.00s: that the wheel's bad but for the way
11.92s: that i trade the covered strangle tends
14.16s: to be a little more optimal now first
16.64s: let's start with level setting what's
18.80s: the difference between the two it's
20.24s: really my new the primary difference
22.96s: between the wheel and the coverage
24.40s: strangle is when we're selling
27.04s: additional short puts so they both start
30.80s: with a cash secured put you can manage
33.52s: this cash secure put however you like to
35.76s: manage puts so for me i have different
38.24s: profit and loss taking metrics normally
40.24s: around 60 credit received or um if i'm
44.32s: within a certain time frame i might look
46.48s: to manage the trade kind of like i have
49.12s: outline in my main video on the coverage
51.44s: strangle
52.80s: now
53.68s: let's say we continue to deploy the cash
56.40s: secured put until we're assigned at that
58.80s: point we would look to sell a covered
61.68s: call that's the same in both strategies
64.64s: however this is where the difference
67.04s: emerges once we sell that covered call
70.32s: in the wheel we stay there we continue
73.76s: to sell short calls against
76.64s: our long stock position that we were
79.12s: assigned on until it goes away
81.36s: in the covered strangle
83.52s: while that covered call is working we
86.00s: would sell additional cash secured puts
89.44s: and this is the primary reason why i
91.84s: like the coverage strangle because
94.24s: it allows us to remain a little more
96.72s: sensitive to price it also allows us to
100.72s: be more active and get more trades on to
104.16s: realize more profits
106.56s: so
107.68s: let's take a look at an example what i
110.24s: did was i went into think back
112.72s: this is december 2nd of 2015 right here
117.28s: so that's what this chart is and then
119.28s: this is where i just neutralized the
121.60s: position it definitely would have gone
123.76s: on longer i just made an assumption in
126.16s: terms of the short calls being assigned
128.08s: and coming off so that we could just
130.48s: kind of talk about it now what i want to
132.88s: walk through is why i chose this time
135.76s: frame one it was random i literally
137.36s: picked a random time frame because i
138.80s: think that's helpful but i did look for
141.04s: something that i knew that there was a
142.72s: drop included because that's really
144.96s: where the risk lies in this strategy so
147.84s: if i had just picked a scenario where
150.24s: you know the
151.36s: price was just going up we would just be
153.76s: essentially selling the same short putts
156.32s: so i wanted to walk through when we're
158.48s: actually managing the trade taking stock
160.40s: and things like that
161.84s: so this was the outcome i will go
164.56s: through the details of the trades and
166.56s: whatnot in just a second but i thought i
168.48s: would give you what happened up front
170.56s: and as you can see the total p l for the
173.20s: covered strangle
175.76s: is 952 bucks this is assuming a thirty
178.96s: thousand dollar account
180.56s: and that walks out at around a three
183.52s: percent return on invested capital from
186.08s: december 15 until about may
190.40s: 16 2016.
192.56s: and then this is the wheel
195.60s: and they came out at about 788
198.48s: and a 2.63 percent return so not a big
201.04s: difference but again there's a
202.80s: really significant limitation in this
205.12s: study in that i didn't actually wait
207.60s: until the trade was neutralized i just
210.16s: neutralized it at the end so what that
211.84s: means is this strategy would have had
214.00s: additional cash secured puts tied on to
216.64s: it that this one didn't but i didn't
219.52s: want to have this really long study that
221.76s: nobody could uh really have the
223.60s: attention span to walk through so this
226.08s: will serve the purpose for now of really
228.24s: displaying the the point i made earlier
230.24s: in terms of being more active
232.40s: so what we have here is the very first
235.04s: trade so let's take a look at what this
238.08s: actually was so what i did again i went
240.64s: back to december i think first or second
242.72s: let's just go to the first and this is
244.56s: on demand so i'm literally flipping
246.40s: through time so this is the day that we
248.32s: entered the position
250.00s: and this is the first position that was
252.96s: entered on both sides iwm was trading
256.00s: what around one
259.60s: call it 119.
261.60s: and
263.20s: on both sides i sold one of i'm sorry on
267.68s: the covered strangle side i sold one of
270.56s: the eight jan 16 116
274.08s: puts collecting 1.38 and then the only
277.20s: difference on the wheel side is i did
280.00s: two and the reason for this is that's
282.40s: kind of one of the primary differences
283.92s: between the wheel and the coverage
285.04s: strangle is we're going to use more
287.36s: capital up front because we're not
289.20s: necessarily planning on adding more
291.60s: short puts as the trade continues so in
295.04s: order to really have any sort of
296.72s: near-peer comparison here you would need
299.04s: to use more money in this this strategy
301.52s: up front otherwise it will just get
303.20s: completely blown away by what you can do
305.68s: with the coverage strangle so that's why
307.20s: i went with the two lot there compared
309.68s: to
311.28s: the one lot that you see in the coverage
312.88s: strangle because on the coverage
314.00s: strangle side we are anticipating part
316.96s: of our management plan is to scale into
320.00s: the trade as it goes against us via
322.88s: those additional cash secure putts
325.60s: okay so this is the first trade
328.08s: now i am going to fast forward time
331.92s: what i did since we have no existing
334.08s: position on right now i literally just
335.92s: went straight to expiration now what i
339.52s: will mention is
341.28s: we could most certainly have a
343.76s: discussion around when we would manage
346.16s: the puts how many of them we would get
347.84s: on and things like that but again just
350.00s: for the nature of the study keeping it
351.60s: relatively simple for at least this
353.76s: iteration i went to expiration on the
356.00s: first short put
357.60s: so that led us immediately to getting
360.40s: assigned because again we entered that
362.24s: trade before that drop as you will
365.04s: remember if we take a look here right so
367.44s: we enter here and then we go through a
368.72s: drop so that's why we are already
371.52s: getting assigned now i'm gonna bring
373.44s: over kind of my working excel sheet that
375.60s: i made just for this like i said it's
378.64s: kind of simple but i didn't want to over
380.96s: complicate it here for the sake of the
382.72s: conversation so
384.48s: here's where we originally started and
388.08s: that was selling those short putts at
390.08s: this point we just fast forward to 11
392.32s: jan this is the week of expiration
395.28s: of or i'm sorry this is after expiration
398.16s: so
399.28s: our puts expired on 8th jan which was
402.16s: that weekend right here
404.64s: and essentially we would have been
406.72s: assigned on the 9th on saturday and then
408.80s: this is the next trading day that we
410.56s: could take a look so what we're going to
412.08s: do now is literally go through the trade
414.40s: essentially as i was comparing them
417.92s: so now it's 11 jan first trading day at
420.64s: this point in time we are going to have
423.60s: um a
425.04s: 100 shares on the coverage strangle and
427.92s: then we're going to have 200 shares on
430.00s: the wheel
431.20s: now
432.08s: on the wheel side of things at this
434.48s: point in time we would be looking to
436.48s: sell short calls same thing for the
438.56s: coverage strangle but what you'll notice
442.40s: is we're trading down at 102. so let's
445.52s: take a look at what possible short calls
448.72s: we have that are at our basis we're at
450.24s: the 116
451.68s: we're gonna get nine cents
453.60s: there's no short call to sell here in my
455.52s: opinion if you wanted to make nine
457.52s: dollars on that short call you could but
459.60s: i do not think it's worth capping the
461.76s: upside especially
463.52s: limiting what you could sell it for if
465.20s: you get a move in your favor it's just
467.28s: too little money so in this instance for
470.24s: both i chose not to sell a short call
473.04s: now it's worth noting my protocol for
475.76s: selling short calls is essentially the
477.68s: same in both of these i'm applying the
479.04s: same paradigm the main difference here
480.72s: is i can sell two of them over here and
482.96s: i can only sell one of them in the wheel
485.20s: because i only have 100 shares
487.76s: all right so that is
490.24s: this trade has now come off the table
493.92s: because we were assigned on those
496.96s: and at this point in time we have 100
500.24s: shares here 200 shares on the wheel
502.64s: which is purple
504.16s: now what i had on was this i added on 11
509.52s: gen so that would be the day that we're
511.12s: looking at right now i added the 26 fab
513.84s: 100 puts collecting 2.50 cents
517.36s: so the reason why i'm doing this is
518.96s: multiple-fold the first one is if i get
521.12s: assigned we will reduce our strike
523.68s: significantly we're going to come from
525.76s: 100 shares at 116 to 200 shares at
529.92s: 108. so we get a pretty good reduction
533.60s: in our basis if we're assigned as
535.52s: compared to this scenario the other
537.84s: thing is we're collecting another 250
539.84s: bucks we're continuing to realize
542.64s: profits not just yet obviously if we
544.88s: sell that put it's open but
547.44s: once we get to the point where we're
549.52s: going to realize the profits you'll see
551.28s: what i mean
552.64s: all right so now i'm going to fast
554.56s: forward
555.68s: to 26 fab i'm going to go straight to
558.08s: the expiration here now the reason why
560.16s: i'm going straight to the expiration on
562.16s: this is because i
564.24s: before i did this video i flipped
566.00s: through each week to see if there was a
568.72s: place to sell short calls against the
571.04s: positions and there wasn't and you'll
573.12s: see why it continues to stay
575.68s: pretty much suppressed so i'm just
578.64s: saving you all time by telling you i
581.44s: looked each week but there wasn't a
583.12s: great opportunity to sell short calls
585.04s: and again you'll see that in just a
586.16s: second
587.28s: so we just fast forwarded now it should
590.08s: be 26 feb so we got assigned originally
594.32s: over
595.52s: uh let's double check the date just to
597.12s: be sure we got a sign on the 9th of
599.92s: january
602.24s: is where we saw the first so somewhere
604.64s: in here
605.76s: and as you can see
607.60s: we didn't have a short call that looked
609.60s: good there we definitely didn't have a
611.52s: short call that looked anywhere in here
613.04s: it went lower it literally went lower so
615.76s: this is
617.52s: now expiration
619.76s: of our short puts that we sold on the
623.36s: covered strangle side
625.28s: and on this day they were trading
627.84s: essentially i could have let them
629.28s: expired but i didn't i just decided to
631.28s: take them down for a penny
632.88s: so at this point in time
634.88s: quick trade recap we are sitting on 200
637.28s: shares at 116 in the wheel there is no
640.56s: short call available to us so nothing to
643.52s: do here on the wheel we now just secured
647.04s: profits on our second um
650.96s: cash secured put so this takes our
653.52s: realized gain we have the 250 realized
656.40s: as well as the 138 from when we were
658.32s: assigned again and that's where we're at
660.96s: right now quick caveat that i didn't go
663.52s: over before on the wheel side we would
666.56s: have realized the 276 dollar
671.12s: profit from those two short puts that we
673.60s: sold so
674.80s: overall realized p l in the wheel up
678.00s: until this point is 276
680.88s: and then realized p l
682.96s: is on the covered strangle side
686.88s: is 387 so i just did the math right
689.20s: there real quick for you all um so we
691.68s: have 387 realized here 276 realized here
694.72s: 200 shares out the door in the on the
696.80s: wheel 100 shares out the door on the
699.36s: coverage triangle okay so we've just
701.92s: realized the p l there now i am going to
705.92s: scoot us forward to the next trading day
709.20s: so that would have been friday
710.32s: expiration we're just going to fast
711.60s: forward real quick to 29 feb
714.88s: and on 29 feb i sold another cash
718.72s: secured put
719.92s: so this time we put out the eight april
722.64s: 100s again collecting 1.82
725.68s: and
726.64s: now what i'm going to do is just show
728.72s: you what i'm looking at for selling
732.00s: covered calls because we still don't
733.36s: have any covered calls out
735.52s: now again we're at the 116 basis so
738.24s: let's say we're going out 46 days we got
740.80s: to go to the 116's to see what we can
742.48s: get and you can get a nickel that's to
744.88s: break even
746.48s: on the stock and then you would collect
748.80s: obviously the premium there again simply
751.68s: not enough to make it worthwhile
753.68s: so what i did was i did the same thing
756.16s: as before i looked at when we could kind
759.44s: of have a viable point to add short
761.28s: calls
762.16s: which i found on the 21st of march so
765.52s: let's go to the 21st
767.36s: and then i want to walk you through my
768.80s: thought process here
770.64s: so now we're fast forward to the 21st of
772.64s: march we were assigned at 116 on the
776.96s: 9th so again somewhere right in here and
780.40s: now we're finally starting to get kind
782.80s: of improved on our underlying to our
788.32s: basis the underlying at this point is
790.40s: trading for like 109 and change
793.12s: so let's pause this and take a look
795.76s: let's say we go out 60 days and let's
798.56s: take a look at our 116s
800.48s: at our basis
802.80s: we could sell a call against our
805.28s: position for 51 cents something like
808.40s: that
810.24s: in my opinion if i was deploying the
812.96s: strategy i would not
815.36s: offer calls here yet they are still
818.48s: very far out of the money
820.32s: if i was trading the wheel
823.20s: i might send these calls out because i'm
825.52s: not making any money at this point in
826.96s: the wheel i'm just holding on to long
828.88s: stock not the end of the world but i'm
831.20s: not making a bunch of money whereas on
833.12s: the on the covered strangle i'm still
835.28s: generating
836.56s: returns via the cash secured put side of
839.92s: things so i would be even less inclined
842.32s: to add short calls out because you're
844.16s: getting pennies on the dollar
845.92s: essentially this is at our basis there
848.08s: is an opportunity cost to be holding the
850.80s: stock for this period of time even so
852.96s: far so in order
855.12s: to make any money here we would
856.56s: essentially have to sell right at our
858.80s: basis so what that means is on the wheel
862.72s: you would make a hundred dollars and you
864.96s: would make no money on the stock to me
867.52s: that's not a great payout i would prefer
870.16s: to wait and this is one of the reasons
871.60s: why i trade something like iwm because i
874.16s: don't care about waiting it's a good
875.92s: product it has inherent diversification
878.64s: so that is what i chose to do in this
880.56s: example is weight
882.56s: so now i'm gonna fast forward to eight
885.44s: april which is the expiration for those
888.00s: short puts again
889.60s: i did not see any really attractive
893.12s: short call offerings and just to show
896.16s: that i'm not you know just picking and
898.64s: choosing random dates that look good i
900.96s: will show you the chart it went down
902.56s: afterwards so the short calls that we
904.08s: just evaluated got worse essentially
907.28s: so
908.80s: let's take a look now
910.80s: at what we have going on
914.56s: so
915.68s: it's 8 april we're going to collect this
917.76s: 182 dollars because our short put is at
920.96s: 100 bucks
922.24s: and the underlying is trading at 109.
924.56s: again you could conceivably just let
926.40s: them go into
928.96s: go to expiration keep it all but i
930.72s: closed them out so now what i'm gonna do
933.44s: is move to the next trading day which
935.84s: would be monday
939.04s: the 11th
941.04s: so here i'm looking to see if i'm going
943.04s: to sell more short puts or if there's a
945.36s: covered call offering again we already
947.44s: evaluated the covered call scenario
949.68s: there isn't anything here that looks
951.28s: good to me so what i did was add more
954.56s: short puts so i did the 20 may
957.52s: 105
959.04s: short puts for 1.29 so at this point in
962.56s: time i essentially will have realized
965.28s: profit on three rounds of short puts
968.40s: totaling 568 dollars i have another 20
971.92s: 128 out
974.00s: and notice that all of these short puts
976.00s: that i'm doing
977.20s: would offer me the ability to lower my
979.68s: basis if i was assigned on the wheel we
983.20s: are still waiting for a good point in
985.84s: order to sell
987.68s: short calls
989.52s: so what i did was i found
992.72s: a time
994.88s: to start looking at some short calls so
997.44s: on
998.72s: 11 april we already took a look so let's
1001.44s: go to 9 may so again what i did was i
1004.64s: just fought fast forward time before i
1006.32s: did the video to look for a period where
1008.72s: selling short calls started to look
1010.48s: attractive that turned out to be 9 may
1012.88s: again you'll see the chart reflect that
1014.56s: in just a second as soon as it updates
1019.20s: all right so the chart is taking an
1020.96s: eternity to update this is kind of one
1022.72s: of the plagues of doing think back or on
1025.76s: demand that's okay because we can see
1027.92s: where it's currently trading at which is
1029.20s: 117. so what i did was is actually
1032.00s: evaluated some short call options
1035.92s: and i think let's see what i actually
1038.08s: went with for both of them i went with
1040.08s: the 30 junes
1041.44s: so what i did was is i went out 52 days
1044.48s: and then again our basis right now would
1046.64s: be giving us a dollar in change so i
1049.12s: went out two dollars to get 58 cents
1052.56s: now i know what you're saying you said
1054.32s: you're saying eric you could have gotten
1056.40s: 50 cents before why didn't you do it but
1058.56s: you're doing it now
1060.00s: it's because i'm giving the stock
1062.48s: appreciation room so when it was trading
1065.12s: at 50 cents before it was at our basis
1067.52s: we would make zero dollars on the stock
1070.24s: in this scenario we're going to be able
1072.00s: to collect 50 something bucks but then
1074.24s: also we have two dollars of capital gain
1077.12s: space for the stock so that's exactly
1079.92s: why i chose that scenario
1083.28s: now to kind of wrap this thing up i just
1086.80s: went fast forwarded to 20 may and
1090.08s: essentially neutralized everything
1091.92s: assuming best case scenario so let's say
1096.00s: uh we go to 20 may
1097.76s: and what hap what would have happened
1099.92s: here
1101.20s: if this was expiration for everything is
1103.52s: i would have made the money on the short
1104.88s: puts on 20 may that is definitive uh
1108.32s: simply because that's where i went and
1109.60s: these would have expired out of the
1110.72s: money so that leaves us overall a short
1115.12s: put p l of 696 dollars
1118.16s: now i
1119.68s: went with the assumption that on 30 june
1122.88s: these would have expired
1124.72s: um for a profit we can take a look right
1126.96s: now i'm pretty sure that they would have
1129.04s: expired in the money or close to it and
1132.48s: let's see
1135.76s: so it looks like it was at 114 so we
1138.08s: would have been slightly out of the
1139.28s: money essentially all that would have
1140.88s: happened is we would have collected
1142.48s: money on both of these short calls
1144.48s: realized that profit offered new short
1146.56s: calls at a higher point as well as
1148.88s: offered additional short puts but again
1151.36s: i didn't want to go too crazy with the
1153.68s: example here it's already a 20 minute
1155.52s: long video but i wanted to show you a
1158.00s: really important aspect which is by
1160.64s: trading the covered strangle we can be a
1163.04s: lot more active in realizing profits and
1166.08s: we offer the ability for us to reduce
1168.64s: our overall basis once we're assigned on
1172.08s: subsequent short puts now the one
1175.20s: potential upside for something like the
1177.36s: wheel is let's say we're trading around
1180.64s: where we are right now in the example
1182.56s: and it's 114. you could choose to only
1185.84s: sell one short call
1188.08s: at your basis so you could say i'm going
1189.84s: to sell one short call at 116 i'm going
1192.16s: to leave a hundred shares open
1194.48s: and then you have the ability to
1196.08s: appreciate more on the upside than you
1198.32s: would on the covered strangle example
1201.44s: so there are ways to optimize both of
1203.76s: them but again just based on my
1206.00s: experience trading both of these
1207.60s: strategies the reasons why i explained
1209.68s: to you are explicitly why i gravitate to
1212.72s: the coverage strangle because bear
1214.64s: markets or when we crash
1216.72s: tend to last for a pretty long period of
1219.68s: time it's something like 290 something
1221.68s: days i just did a video on it not too
1223.28s: long ago
1224.40s: so they allow me to stay more active
1226.56s: reduce my basis more effectively and
1229.04s: overall i am a big advocate really of
1232.24s: either of these strategies but i think
1234.08s: that the coverage strangle slightly
1235.36s: edges it out for the reasons i shared as
1237.60s: always if there's any questions or
1238.80s: anything that you all want to see me go
1240.40s: over let me know hit me up in the
1242.24s: contact info in the video description
1244.00s: and until next time be an outlier
