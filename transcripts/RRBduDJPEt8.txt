398.00s: you
400.00s: you
402.00s: you
404.00s: edge in my system.
416.00s: How to measure.
422.80s: Super interesting question.
426.68s: And the reason why it's so interesting is because it hits at the heart and soul of
432.28s: what this whole trading thing is about.
434.20s: It's actually why I want to open with this question.
438.16s: And it's because there really is absolutely nothing at all that matters in trading until
446.88s: you arrive at a point where you have some sort of edge.
452.76s: And sans edge effectively means that there's nothing for you to do until you find a way
462.20s: to create an extract edge.
465.64s: So there's no point in dealing with all of your discipline issues, trying to figure
473.52s: out what forecasting method works the best.
477.52s: Like all of that is secondary to the concept of edge.
481.84s: And this is why I very regularly introduce and reinforce the outlier strategy process.
492.12s: Here.
494.44s: And this is really just a way to think about finding and extracting edge.
502.68s: That's it.
503.68s: Notice the first thing that we talk about is a profit mechanism or a market effect.
510.92s: That that is where edge is from being able to monetize some sort of market effect.
521.44s: And if you're unable to identify a market effect to monetize, then you're like you're
529.24s: genuinely pretty much dead in the water.
531.00s: There's nothing for you to do at that point.
532.96s: So in a way that's actually kind of cool because it gives you myopic initial focus.
540.04s: There's nothing else that matters.
541.52s: It doesn't matter if you're going to trade options.
544.16s: It doesn't matter if you're going to trade stock.
545.80s: It doesn't matter if you're going to trade futures.
547.92s: Literally none of it matters.
549.32s: Those are all just different assets.
551.36s: What ultimately matters here is how do we think about edge?
556.80s: So there's a couple ways to consider edge.
561.00s: Now a lot of people will talk about it in the context of alpha.
569.32s: Defectively there's different versions of this as well, but it's just outperformance
572.84s: of the market.
579.20s: This is stuff like risk adjusted returns, typically especially if you're looking at it in
584.36s: the context of an institution, although from a retail trading lens, it doesn't matter.
588.96s: If you take on more risk, but you outperform, right?
591.12s: You're not beholden to some sort of client that has risk parameters.
598.12s: So this is one way to think about edge.
602.36s: Another way to think about edge, I think, is a little more appropriate is essentially
607.80s: to be able to get what you want.
616.36s: Now, that sounds a little nebulous, but the point of framing it this way is I can think
625.64s: of people that I've chatted with before that effectively are just trying to trade for
632.20s: income, for example.
634.52s: And they're not necessarily trying to outperform the market in terms of their percent return,
639.48s: but they might be trying to outperform the market in terms of reduction of draw downs
643.40s: in maintenance of their income.
646.08s: So most people might look at that and say, well, that's not alpha because you're not
649.28s: outperforming on a risk adjusted basis.
651.68s: However, it's still a completely reasonable goal for somebody to have.
657.40s: And if you're able to consistently hit that goal, I think it's fine.
661.40s: So those are the couple different ways that I think people would think about edge.
666.44s: And the outlier strategy process is designed to give you a lens to look for edge.
672.16s: And that's when we're talking about these things I refer to as profit mechanisms.
676.28s: And you've heard me use that term a million times and we talked about them actually in
679.56s: depth.
680.64s: So I'm not going to rehash them if you have follow on questions.
683.48s: Now it's the place to have that conversation.
686.00s: But the main thing here is being able to look at the markets and to find different ways
692.48s: to monetize them.
694.24s: If you're able to do that, then that's effectively the way of finding edge.
699.60s: And again, I wouldn't limit yourself to something like having to be risk adjusted returns.
705.24s: I would say you should define what you're trying to do and then work off of that.
711.48s: So that's the first question.
713.08s: Let me open the door for a throw real quick and then we'll get back.
720.08s: All right.
722.08s: So I saw a couple comments come in.
732.08s: So let's talk about those recess.
734.08s: So probably because I'm small stacks, but I only get margin treatment on purchase shares
738.72s: not cash secure puts margin treatment.
742.88s: I don't know what you mean by that here.
744.16s: So it often makes more sense to do a buy right.
746.32s: Did you have this issue?
749.00s: I don't follow your question fully.
750.64s: When you say margin treatment, you just mean it's when you're selling a put, it doesn't
755.52s: allow you to sell a naked put, but is cash secured?
762.36s: Because then I don't know how you make the comparison fully cash secured got it.
765.88s: So then I guess I don't understand the comparison you're making between the margin treatment
773.32s: on the shares versus the cash secured puts because on the shares, it's the same thing.
778.12s: When you buy shares, you have to use your cash first.
780.80s: So it's effectively the same amount of cash that's required.
784.20s: So I don't follow that one totally.
788.16s: H says getting run over on short calls and game stop versus what I sold them for.
792.32s: Happy on the shares side though, trying to average in but pull the trigger early.
795.68s: There's edge and selling ball there moves quick though.
798.64s: Um, yeah, I mean, there's definitely without a doubt edge in selling ball in general and
804.40s: also in really highly volatile names like game stock.
807.20s: But what you're coming across is what I actually regularly talk about in terms of not capping
812.40s: your upside.
813.40s: If you're holding stock, one of the silliest things you could do in my opinion is cap your
817.72s: upside.
818.88s: You're holding all of the downside risk.
821.68s: So if I draw you a risk profile for a stock position, this is the zero line.
829.60s: Your stock position looks like this.
832.36s: It's linear, right?
833.76s: As it is price goes up.
835.28s: So this is spot price.
838.08s: This is PNL.
841.04s: As price goes up, you make money linear and then as it goes down, obviously you lose
846.00s: money linear.
848.12s: When you run and this isn't necessarily for age because age is saying, been selling
852.76s: the 40s against a third.
856.36s: So they're already doing ratio, which is good.
858.76s: Now for those that are unfamiliar, what I'm talking about, the concept of a ratio is simple,
863.72s: right?
864.72s: So if I have 500 shares of whatever stock XYZ, it doesn't matter if it's game stock,
870.92s: it's literally whatever you're holding.
873.04s: If you sell to open five calls at whatever price, this is effectively what happens.
884.48s: You cap your profit potential above your short strike.
889.52s: Whatever your short strike is plus the credit you receive.
892.60s: Your cap now.
894.56s: So a massive difference is instead of doing five, maybe you do two or three.
901.56s: What happens is if you have 500 shares, and in this case you have 500 short delta,
908.92s: 500 long delta, your delta is net out to zero.
912.12s: Once you get to the 500 delta, because remember if you're selling a 30 delta call,
916.52s: it's starting at 30 delta.
919.16s: So you're effectively making money on this short call until it's so far in the money,
923.08s: it has a delta of one.
924.52s: That's when your profit goes away up to the upside in terms of like exceeding whatever
929.88s: it is above that short strike.
932.04s: So now if instead of this scenario, you have this scenario where you're long 500
937.72s: deltas, but then you're only short 300 deltas.
941.08s: What this means is you have 200 deltas that are uncovered that do not have any overhead
946.92s: from the short call side of the equation.
949.08s: So then you can enjoy your profit potential based on that.
952.68s: So instead of this scenario, it looks more like this.
955.96s: You're still not going to profit as much as if you were uncovered,
960.84s: but you will profit way more than this scenario.
964.04s: And the way to think about that is pretty easy, right?
966.52s: We just think about it in terms of how much money do I want up front versus what do I want
971.80s: my profit potential to be?
973.08s: And this comes down to whatever you think about the underlying.
975.96s: If it's something that you think is going to go up a lot, then you want to lighten up this
980.60s: ratio. You want to maybe do one or even zero and not put any on.
985.48s: But then if it starts to slow down and it's kind of migrating sideways,
988.76s: but you still want to hold it longer term. It's just not moving as fast.
992.20s: That's when you can up the ratio a little bit and maybe go to two or go to three, something like that.
997.64s: So the ratio component is super important because even in H's scenario where they're saying that
1004.28s: they're selling the 40s against the third of the portfolio or the third of the position,
1008.44s: the cool part there is if you're not using much, then you can always add more short calls
1015.80s: to increase your total profit potential. And I'll show you what that means.
1021.24s: So let's say that we use the scenario here where we're long the 500 shares.
1029.32s: And let's say that our basis on those 500 shares is 25.
1033.96s: And I'm just spitballed stuff.
1037.96s: So this is basis. This is size.
1042.60s: And let's say that we get some short calls out there. So then let's do the strike for the short calls.
1051.08s: Let's do the lot size. Let's do credit. I'll do premium. And then we'll have our exit trades.
1061.80s: And then we'll have a couple calculations here. So we'll have max profit potential.
1073.16s: We'll have credit received.
1077.08s: And I think that's probably fine to start. I'm going to move all this over.
1083.56s: So that we can make these the correct size.
1086.04s: Okay. So now let's say that you have a too lot that you sold.
1095.72s: And let's say that your, I mean, we can literally do a live example, but be a little faster if we
1102.12s: don't. So let's say that your basis is there. Let's say your strike price is 30.
1106.28s: You have your too lot. Let's say you collected a dollar and premium.
1109.56s: Okay. So the first thing we know is the credit we receive is simply the premium times the lots times
1116.84s: 100. So you collected $200. We can calculate what the current cash secured put requirement or cash
1125.00s: secured to maintain the position, which is simply the number of shares you have times the basis.
1135.72s: So you're using $12,500. We can look at our credit return on invested capital
1144.12s: here and see how much you're making. Again, I didn't put in like DTE or anything.
1149.24s: So it doesn't really matter. And we can figure out what our max profit is for the short calls.
1156.76s: Now you can absolutely do a more complex formula, which is super simple, but for the sake of simplicity,
1163.08s: all I'm going to do is I'm going to figure out what the max profit is for the number of shares
1168.28s: that I have using only the share side of the equation, not including the credit. And I'll show you
1174.12s: what I mean. So what we're going to do is take our strike price less the basis, which is 25,
1182.44s: that gives us our five point move times the lot size times 100. And this shows you how much
1192.04s: money you would make on your position. In this case, using just the 200 shares at this point.
1198.84s: Now again, you can make this more accurate if you're so inclined by adding in the credit here.
1205.80s: And then you can also add if you're so inclined, the residual 300 shares at this price versus this
1211.24s: price. But again, that's not the point. The point of this is just to visualize what the max profit
1217.16s: might be on those short calls. Okay, so now let's go back to the scenario where the underlying goes
1224.28s: up and we have to adjust these and let's figure out how to do this. So we're only using a two lot
1232.84s: and our premium is a dollar. So let's say that we have to close these for a dollar 50.
1237.88s: And this is for the sake of the role. So now we'll figure out what our PNL is for the position.
1255.32s: And this is only the option position, by the way. So our PNL
1262.20s: exit plus whatever we got to start times lot size times one Hyundai. So we lost a hundred bucks
1273.32s: there. So now let's say that we decide that we want to roll these calls. And let's say that the
1281.56s: option is super far in the money at this point on a relative scale. And let's say the underlying
1286.28s: trading at like 35 or something like that, whatever. So if you try to roll an option on something
1292.60s: that's really far in the money, it's very difficult to collect a credit. And I'll literally we
1297.32s: can look at an example so that you can visualize it. Take a look at Palantir. So let's say that
1306.52s: when Palantir is around a hundred bucks, let's say that you sold like the 105 call. Again,
1316.36s: I'm just giving you an example. And let's pretend that your 105 call is coming up on expiration next
1322.44s: week. And we can literally figure out what it traded at. We can do all the actual math, but again,
1328.36s: it doesn't matter so much for the sake of the conversation. I just want to show you what this
1332.52s: could look like. So let's say that you have those 105 calls that are set to expire next week.
1338.36s: Those 105 calls right now, they're trading for 17, let's just call it 18, 18 and change.
1345.96s: So if we go out and we say, well, I want to roll these, these 105s, I'd have to close them for
1353.40s: 18 bucks. Maybe let's just call it 1850. I have to close it for 1850. If I go out 28 days,
1360.60s: and I know I have to close those 105s for 1850, can I roll these 105s to the 110s and move them
1368.60s: further out of the money? I can't because if I have to close those for 18, these are trading for
1375.08s: 16 and change. It means you're on a net debit on that roll. Now again, for those that are
1379.32s: familiar with the more advanced approach to rolling options, there's nuance you could technically
1384.20s: depending on what it all look like. The point that I want to make here specifically though is as
1389.08s: these short calls get buried, it becomes more difficult to roll them and increase your basis.
1395.24s: But there's an interesting scenario here. So let's just use the Palantir numbers since they're up.
1404.84s: And I'll show you. So we just said to close out those other options, it was going to be 18 bucks.
1410.84s: And these were for the 105s. Right now, we're trying to get to the 110s and the 110s are trading for
1419.32s: 1630, whatever, it doesn't matter. 1630. So we can see we're not going to make it, right? We're going to
1428.76s: we're going to have a debit on this roll. And let's say that we had that same too lot, but we had 500 shares.
1437.40s: So that means that we still have a bunch of uncovered shares right now. That's going to be useful
1446.76s: because if we look at closing this trade, it's going to take us the 18 bucks.
1464.12s: Here's your total cost. And let's say that you're trying to do
1471.88s: same lot size. So you're trying to go to the two lot and you're trying to do the same thing.
1477.88s: So the net here,
1488.68s: whatever the original sale was, let's say that the original sale was
1492.12s: three bucks. And let's say it was a two lot. This way, we can actually look at
1500.44s: probably something that's close to the hypothetical.
1507.56s: So you originally got 600 bucks. This one, you're going to have to close for 18.
1511.88s: So let's say instead of three bucks, let's say that you sold these for two. And let's say maybe
1525.56s: you sold it for like 150. I'm trying to make it so that we get a negative. I'm cherry picking the
1529.88s: numbers more for the sake of the example because what I'm going to show you is the benefit of being
1535.56s: able to use dynamic lot sizing. So we still have these 500 shares right now. We're only covering two
1541.96s: of them. And in this scenario to get that $5 basis adjustment where we're going to collect 1630,
1548.36s: get in 30 to 60, you're still going to be in the red in this very hypothetical cherry pick scenario,
1554.44s: which still is reflective of reality, by the way. This isn't like making a worst case scenario.
1559.16s: This absolutely happens. I'm just cobbling it together super fast for the example.
1564.36s: So now instead of this trade, let's look at a different trade. Let's say instead of
1569.64s: a two lot, let's say we do a three lot. Well, if you copy the rest of this stuff using a three lot,
1578.20s: I'm going to slide this one out of the way for now.
1583.00s: What do you notice? Well, now we can make actually decent money. We're going to make a decent amount
1587.72s: of money on the total rolls. But what if instead of just going five points, maybe we try to go a
1595.80s: little further. So instead of going from the 105 to the 110s, maybe we go to something like the 115s.
1603.24s: Those are trading for 1290. Can we make that trade? So if we go to the 115s and we get to 1290,
1610.12s: do we still make money? We do. Now what just happened here? Again, we have to remember
1617.56s: what the max profit was for the stock. And again, let's say that we got into this when it was 95 bucks.
1625.88s: Again, I'm just grabbing random numbers. So your max profit in this scenario from the original
1632.28s: position is your 105 less your 190 times your lot size times 100. And again, this is for going
1643.32s: the credit that you get. So your max profit here was going to be two grand. And that's on the shares
1651.32s: that you're holding. Now what happens if we change this? Even though we added more short calls
1666.60s: in capped our profit potential on an additional 100 shares, we were able to adjust the basis on
1675.16s: these shares by 10 points. So by adding that additional trade here, you'll notice that your max
1683.24s: profit on the covered shares went up, but it's also because there's another 100 shares in there.
1690.20s: So then if we normalize this and we do it on a per share basis, which is this times 100,
1700.04s: you're getting 10 bucks per share profit here. You're getting 20 bucks per share profit here.
1710.36s: So this is a slightly longer than intended example. Maybe hopefully not too detailed. I don't
1717.00s: want to lose you. But the stuff that I want you to take away from here is by selling your calls
1724.20s: at a ratio, you give yourself way more choices to do different things based on what your overall plans
1733.16s: are. So this is just an example of that. Okay. Next. Lauren says, if you hit your yearly goal,
1740.28s: do you move it or try to sustain it? Lauren, can you explain a little bit more? When you say move
1747.40s: it, do you mean for that year or do you mean in general? Because there are two very different things.
1753.48s: If I hit my profit target for a single year, I just keep trading, but I become more selective.
1760.60s: I'm trying to find the best possible opportunities that I can identify. If it's a different scenario where
1770.20s: I hit my profit and I'm not going to start changing my general annual return target until I have
1782.92s: enough repetitions with the portfolio to see what I'm capable of producing.
1789.88s: So the summary to that is, let's say it's May. This is a perfect example, right? My annual
1798.68s: target is really conservative now for a bunch of different reasons I've talked about. And I
1803.72s: surpassed it within the first month. So does that mean that I stop trading or that I change my
1810.12s: target? No. The way that I think about that target is that that's just my planning factor.
1816.60s: And the reason why that it's my planning factor is because I'm coming up with what is the
1821.32s: minimum target I need to consistently hit in order to grow the portfolio where I want it to be.
1827.16s: Now, if I have a year where I'm hitting it hot and I'm doing a good job, then I can absolutely
1832.20s: scale. I can put more on if I'm so inclined. But the main point here is that there's no part of
1839.08s: me that would like stop, slow down. That doesn't happen. But I become really selective.
1845.00s: And I wouldn't change the goal. The goal is just a planning factor for a minimum viable product
1851.56s: to keep me on my longer term path of developing wealth, right? Like that's the broader intention.
1860.92s: So to show you what that looks like in context, on the website, you know, that I have a compound
1870.12s: growth calculator for literally for you to play with these kinds of numbers. So let's say we have
1874.44s: $25,000. Let's say we're saving on average, $1500 per month. And we do this for 20 years. This is
1881.64s: longer term timeframe. And let's say my target is 15%. So the way that I look at it is I'm trying
1890.04s: to hit at least the 15%. If I hit at least the 15%. It puts me on track for my longer term goal.
1900.84s: If I essentially outrun that and I have a higher return, well, then great. It just means I'm
1909.40s: accelerating the overall timeline. But I wouldn't guide the goal up because then you're absolutely
1916.52s: taking more risk to get it. And as long as I'm actively moving towards the goal that I planned
1923.48s: and reconciled myself with, that's the main point of that target. So I wouldn't adjust it. I would
1929.24s: just keep trading, but be selective, like be more selective for sure.
1937.56s: Shahzad says, what are your thoughts on going entirely variance risk premium profit mechanism?
1943.24s: I think what the tasty folks preach, they're definitely not trading the RP.
1949.00s: What tasty does is very different than that actually because they do take a lot of directional
1955.32s: bets. They just prefer to be on the sell side. But there's a different, like if you sell premium,
1960.92s: you're not inherently attempting to capture risk premiums. Now that might be a subtext.
1967.80s: But a lot of times they're trading actually very directionally, which is not risk premium at all.
1973.88s: It's just a sub factor part of that. So I would say depending on what your goal is and what your skill
1982.52s: set is, if that gets you to your goal, there's nothing wrong with that. It's definitely not what I
1987.96s: would do. I don't see any benefit to just hobbling yourself as an options trader and just doing one
1994.84s: thing. I think that's one of the biggest mistakes that an options trader can make because
2001.56s: depending on what kind of toolkit you're able to build, some of my most profitable trades have been
2007.56s: with long options. So if I only sold premium, I would never see those. Now that being said, I absolutely
2017.64s: think there's nothing wrong with if you're constrained by time or constrained by effort, energy,
2025.56s: and you're willing to make concessions on what you're doing. And effectively being comfortable
2031.24s: saying like, yeah, I might not be able to earn the return that I wanted to. But it's easier for me
2037.08s: to do this. I can more reliably consistently do this. Then that's okay. But you just have to acknowledge
2043.56s: the trade-offs. So summarized the answer for Shahazad would be there's nothing wrong with doing that.
2051.00s: But there's an associated opportunity cost. And me personally, I wouldn't give up on that opportunity
2057.00s: cost. It's not worth it to me. I'm happy to try the other things as well. And they typically do well.
2064.92s: Shahzad says, while chatting to Tom Saazn, if you guys talked about percent utilization,
2069.80s: if you're using 70% and you calculate your returns on this money investor, the overall portfolio,
2074.76s: always the overall portfolio. Because it's still what's in there, right? You're taking 70% of something.
2082.84s: So the only reason there's a difference between rock and roick.
2092.76s: This is on capital, which is Spanish for your account. And then this is on invested capital.
2115.48s: This is how much is being used. So if you'll recall the example I gave back here when we were
2122.44s: doing the Palantir trade or whatever the GameStop would, whatever the example is I was giving you,
2126.68s: I did roick. And effectively what I'm saying is if I have a portfolio of $10,000 and we're using
2134.68s: $12.50 in this individual trade, I'm not going to calculate the return on the entire portfolio
2141.24s: in that context, although I absolutely do in general, there's nothing wrong with that.
2146.20s: But I want to see how efficiently the capital is being used. That's why I'll look at roick. So
2154.52s: when you were talking about deploying the entire portfolio, right, how we're using the whole
2159.32s: portfolio and the utilization of it being 70%, that 70% represents the roick, the invested capital.
2168.44s: But when we're talking about end of year returns, when you're looking at
2175.56s: this metric here, this is on the account because again, you're taking 70% of that total number.
2185.16s: If your account is smaller, this 70% you're taking as smaller. So we care a lot about that whole
2191.24s: the entire size of the portfolio. So that's what we use ROC for. So ROC return on capital for the
2198.04s: account. And then roick is typically related to individual positions, although even for individual
2204.60s: positions, you can still calculate the return relative to a larger bucket of money.
2211.40s: There's nothing wrong with that either. There are just different ways to analyze the utilization
2218.28s: of capital. Now one thing I will note is that it's really, really important to avoid vanity metrics.
2226.52s: So what that means is a lot of times, especially options traders will focus on the roick of like
2235.48s: really cheap option, right? And they'll tell some sort of ridiculously stupid number because they
2243.48s: bought a really cheap option and it compounded a lot. So here's what I mean by that.
2251.08s: If we buy a nickel option and let's say that the underlying shoots up and now that nickel
2257.88s: option is trading for $3.50. If we look at a one lot, this nickel option obviously costs you
2266.04s: your five bucks. And then if we take a look at what it turns into based on your big move,
2275.96s: $350. So then if we look at what the actual return is on this trade, it's obviously massive.
2285.64s: Huge percent return. But it's because it's a super cheap option that happens to compound.
2296.92s: And a lot of retail traders will get wrapped up on bullshit numbers like this. And it's actually
2301.96s: why it is so, so, so important to understand the differences between using percentages and raw
2309.56s: numbers and when to flow in between them because you do need to flow in between them, right?
2315.16s: So in this case, that's a great percent return. But you literally made $345. Who gives a shit?
2321.48s: $345. Doesn't matter. So think of it in the context of
2329.08s: rock is ultimately what matters. At the end of the year, that's what matters. You have X
2335.32s: number of dollars in your account. This is what you were able to produce leveraging that account.
2340.28s: However you so chose, that's the ultimate number that matters.
2345.48s: It's a good question.
2348.52s: Ricky says, what profit mechanism do you think is the hardest to capitalize off?
2354.28s: Well, it depends on when we say hardest because like there's tons that are literally just
2358.76s: not accessible to retail traders. So to be, to take that literally, I think those, right? So things
2366.68s: like dispersion, not doing that. Retails not doing dispersion. Another one is scalping.
2378.60s: Flash high frequency trading. I don't mean scalping in the colloquial sense that you'll hear thrown
2384.52s: around in retail trading circles. I mean like the actual term scalping. And this is stuff that's like
2392.52s: moments of holding something. Another one, another profit mechanism that's essentially not going to
2400.36s: happen for retail traders is market making. Now this is on standard markets, equity markets.
2410.12s: You can absolutely make money as a retail trader and other markets. I've actually talked about this
2415.32s: through things like the new event based markets. That's not saturated yet with market makers.
2421.24s: So you can literally make markets. I was working with a couple of buddies actually on models to do
2426.28s: that. So, but that's another side of the things, right? Like we're talking about a different market
2433.24s: than equity markets and equity markets. Retail traders not, you're not, you're not market making. It's
2437.40s: not going to happen for you. So when I think about like the most difficult profit mechanisms,
2441.80s: it would be stuff like this. And again, these are like things that are just essentially not going
2446.76s: to happen. Now, if I were to advance us one level into things that are more generally accessible,
2454.52s: but still things that I personally would avoid or things like day trading.
2464.84s: The reason why day trading is so difficult is because when we look at really, really,
2471.96s: short-term market behavior, it's based on things that you really can't forecast very well.
2478.84s: And it's why I always get a kick when I see these different YouTube shorts or like TikToks about
2484.44s: order filled. And then it's somebody trying to trade some like intraday thing and they make $36,000
2491.24s: on their individual trade. The reality is, is I know full well that even if they make a good
2497.32s: amount of money on that first one, there's probably so many other losers that have happened or
2501.96s: are going to happen that it is hands down the most difficult time frame. Hands down, the most
2509.16s: difficult time frame to trade. And it's because market effects are so fickle in that short term of
2516.76s: a time frame that it is so difficult to do that effectively. This is why other things that are more
2524.76s: well researched are typically good places to start, stuff like momentum,
2529.00s: variances premiums like you heard earlier. Stuff that's generally persistent.
2533.88s: The other thing to always keep in mind from a retail trading perspective is transaction costs
2538.68s: are always against you. And do not let the illusion of no commissions trick you into thinking
2544.44s: that your transaction costs are good or cheap. They're not. It's just that it's hidden from you.
2550.60s: So what happens from that lens is you are trader and I forgot we have to actually have to draw
2559.72s: our favorite trader. Here. That's their head, by the way.
2572.76s: And because the markets have been good, we have a big ol' dripped out chain
2586.28s: with diamonds all over it.
2593.64s: And you guys already know who this is. Hold on, we need the arms. Those are the arms.
2599.40s: And then for scale reference.
2617.72s: This is Empire State.
2620.92s: Building.
2627.48s: And then as always, we have the cell phone.
2634.84s: We're slaying in trades. Okay. So I literally forgot what I was even talking about when I started
2643.24s: making this. Oh, order and where the costs are. I remember now. So as our crowd favorite
2651.00s: submits a trade to the broker. Maybe the broker.
2661.56s: And this is for Palantir. The broker might say, yo, don't worry, it's on the house. It's full
2672.20s: of free. I'm just that nice of a person. But they're not. They don't care about you.
2678.20s: They're actually little gremlins. I don't really know how to draw a gremlin other than having
2681.96s: like a little fucked up back. So these are the brokers. They're little gremlin backs.
2689.88s: And they're not, they're not going to do it for free. What they do is they sell your order flow.
2699.16s: Market makers.
2705.32s: So when your order for Palantir comes in, goes to your broker, your broker will then bundle
2711.96s: a whole bunch of orders like this. And then they'll submit that order to a market maker.
2720.44s: The market maker is literally paying money for this. Why would they do that? You can derive
2730.60s: their incentives. Then the market maker will either internalize the order, take care of it here.
2737.80s: They might route it to an exchange out here. But the overwhelming majority of instances,
2744.76s: your order is going to go to these people. Why does this matter? It means that the fill that you
2751.64s: get on your trade is effectively completely different than what it would be if it was done on an
2759.08s: open competitive exchange where people are actively competing for each order. But they're not.
2765.16s: Your order flow is being bought. So anyways, to take this all the way back to the day trading example,
2771.16s: if you have a ton of cycles on your trades, even though you think, even though you think that
2782.04s: your trading might be cheap, it's not. It's just that the cost is hidden from you. That's all.
2789.72s: But it's still there. Do not forget. Okay.
2801.32s: Shahzad says in the past six months, I started and stopped trade log four times. I feel like I
2806.36s: tried to capture too much and it's up being too much. What would you think are the minimum things
2811.08s: that should be captured? How do you track options? Meaning you track by expiration date, date closed?
2816.44s: That's awesome. That's a great question. It's actually one that we work through in detail with
2820.20s: the pro community because it's something that we talk about a lot. So I'm really, really glad you
2825.40s: asked that. The answer is very simple. So you already know the outlier strategy process.
2842.20s: Oops. Yeah, where the fuck did that go?
2860.12s: Hey here. Okay, great.
2862.36s: So how do we answer this? What do we track in a trade log? Let's say that we're trading something
2872.76s: like variances premiums. Do I care about a price breakout? Maybe, maybe not. How do I know?
2887.56s: I will know by completing these two steps.
2893.88s: The way that this second step works is I say to myself, I'm researching variances premiums.
2899.48s: I have no idea what really matters to this and what doesn't. The first thing I'm going to do is read.
2907.16s: I'm going to go to places like SSRN and I'm going to look for existing research on the market
2913.64s: effect for a starting point so that I'm not just guessing. There's no reason to just blindly guess.
2920.52s: Do homework first. As I read about variances premiums, I might find things like the relationship
2929.64s: between implied volatility and realize volatility matters a lot. I might find things like
2937.16s: vol regime matters a lot. I might find things like implied vol and realize vol durations
2952.28s: and trends matters. This is just from reading. This isn't from looking. This is just from reading.
2961.40s: Then I'm going to say to myself, okay, based on peer reviewed research, this is the stuff that
2968.04s: they find that matters. I'm going to use that as a starting point because I don't know.
2972.52s: On top of this, what else do I think might matter? What other stuff do I think could matter
2982.92s: for something like a risk premium? Well, maybe something related to liquidity.
2990.92s: Maybe something related to industry.
2995.96s: On fact, things like biotech, for example, super high-vol, why? Because they experience binary events
3001.72s: non-stop. Things like earnings, economic releases. So as I just brainstorm other stuff that might
3016.76s: to the profit mechanism, I'm going to track these next.
3023.72s: So the idea in the beginning is to this isn't with respect to a strategy at all yet. This is
3031.56s: literally just measuring it so that you can determine what actually matters because this is the
3037.40s: only way to figure out what actually matters is by looking at it. You're not going to be able to
3041.88s: just guess it into existence. So then from here, the next steps are pretty simple. When we then
3050.44s: understand the behavior here, we understand these different things, the different values, how they
3056.92s: behave, then we start going into building a strategy. So then if I'm trading variants for
3065.80s: previous and I'm relegating it to an earnings release for this specific subset of that strategy,
3072.68s: a verper, that's actually kind of a really fun verper. So if I'm trading verper,
3080.84s: then I know things like earnings release matters. I know things like prior earnings releases matter
3091.64s: and so on and so forth. So what I'm going to do is as I'm building the strategy, I'm going to list
3097.32s: out the inputs that matter to the specific strategy that I'm building and then I can figure out how to
3104.68s: track important inputs. This is how you solve that question. So it's literally just following the
3117.24s: process. It's that simple. So it's a great question. And fortunately, there really isn't a much
3124.76s: not a whole lot to it. It starts with it's one of those things where there's not a whole lot to it
3129.64s: just to do it. That's it. Roryng Clity, Ayo, what up? It says in your podcast with Mr. Saznoff,
3139.24s: you talked a bit about account utilization and the numbers surprise me. Tom said their account is
3144.28s: usually around 30%. How might we figure out what utilization we should target for a specific
3149.88s: trader, the whole account? What would change the equation to increase the decrease utilization?
3155.48s: It's a good question. So the reason why you find his utilization is so low,
3162.36s: because you're using options. They're levered. That's the point. You don't have to use anywhere near
3166.52s: as much of your account. And as your account grows, you'll find you'll typically use less and less of it.
3174.04s: Now, this is another thing we actually discussed in the pro livestreams because again,
3178.60s: it's like a really pertinent point. So I'm very glad that you asked it. And what this comes down
3184.44s: to is not so much utilization per cent. But I think of it as how many trades should we have on?
3196.36s: And the answer to this is super simple. We use the reverse engineering path.
3202.04s: So we start by developing our goals. And we say, okay, I decide based on me playing with a compound
3210.52s: interest calculator, reconciling what my savings rates might be, reconciling what my initial
3215.08s: amount that I'm going to trade with might be against my investment horizon against my first three
3221.56s: years of trading performance to get a sense of what I'm capable of returning. And you pick your
3226.52s: number, whatever that number is, then we essentially say, okay, I'm going to target 15 percent.
3232.76s: Okay, great. So now what we do is we say, if I have that $25,000 account,
3241.48s: and I'm looking for 15 percent, I know over the course of a year, I'm looking to make 30, 750.
3250.76s: I now know if I break this 3750 into a monthly target, I need to make $312.50, this is not
3258.68s: including taxes. Taxes you can pat it a little bit. Or if you're trading in a retirement account,
3264.68s: don't pat it, because it doesn't matter, because you ain't got to be worried about it.
3269.00s: So now you have a target. So then when we're thinking about how much money to use the way that I
3274.92s: approach it is I do this math. And then I say, what's the minimum amount of money that I need to
3280.44s: make this month in order to hit my target. Now again, what you can't do is say, I'm going to put on
3288.76s: three trades. Each one of them is going to be worth $105 max profit. And if I do these three trades
3300.92s: and they all hit max profit, I hit my number. Why can't you do this? Because they're not all going
3305.96s: to be a max profit. The market's going to move. So what you can do is calculate it on an expected
3313.16s: return basis. We trade options. Options give you probabilities. It's a beautiful thing. So you can
3320.04s: say, well, there's a 60% chance of this trade making money. There's a 62% chance of this trade
3326.52s: making its max profit. And there's a 35% chance of this trade making its max profit. So then what's
3333.08s: the actual expected return on these trades?
3346.44s: Now we realize we ain't there. We have more to do in order to get on what we need to have on
3355.24s: in order to figure out how many trades we need to have on.
3364.52s: So the first part of the answer here is to figure out how much you're trying to make.
3371.88s: It's not a random number. We don't just say, oh, I'm going to use blank percent of my account.
3377.88s: It literally doesn't mean anything. We have to make sure that what we're doing is aligned with
3383.16s: our broader game plan. So then you have to do the additional exercise and figure out what the
3388.92s: drawdown risk is here and so on and so forth. Then for the other part of the question,
3394.60s: how do we figure out how much we should target for a specific trade or the whole account?
3398.36s: It's a great question. And again, it's very simple. This is for the entire account.
3403.56s: Now for the individual trades, it's going to depend on the strategies that you've built in how
3408.52s: they perform. And here's why that matters. Let's say that I'm trading my breakout approach.
3417.00s: And let's say my breakout approach has a 35% hit rate. It means that I'm making profit targets
3427.64s: 35% of the time, which somebody might hear that and they might say, well, man, that's trash.
3433.96s: That's like real bad. Not great, but it doesn't matter. Because let's say on the 35% of instances,
3443.16s: I'm making $5,000. And let's say on the 65% of instances, I'm losing $300.
3451.40s: If we calculate the expected return of this system,
3455.48s: it's super profitable, super profitable. And this is why people who focus on winrate are literally,
3470.60s: they're so mistaken. It's not funny. They're so focused on the wrong thing. It's amazing to me
3477.96s: to be that far off target, but people will do that. So in the context of this kind of strategy,
3485.00s: I know how I need to size things. Because based on the thing that I observed, based on how I think I
3492.04s: can trade it based on my paper trading results, I can say, well, I can really tightly control my risk.
3498.76s: And I can size this appropriately to the portfolio. So then if we say that I'm losing $300
3504.28s: on average and let's say that we have $5,000 portfolio, it means per trade, you're still at a pretty
3517.00s: decent size position. You're at 6% of the portfolio. So then if this is the case, it might mean you
3527.16s: need to size these things down so that on each one of these instances, you're not losing 6% of your
3534.12s: portfolio. You might have to cut this down so it makes sense. So the way to think about it here is
3543.64s: based on the actual strategy that you're trading and the performance of it, how it behaves,
3550.12s: that's going to inform how much of the account it should get and what the total risk should be in it.
3557.48s: Otherwise, again, if you're just picking random numbers like some people will say, never more than
3561.80s: 1% of your portfolio in a trade. Well, why would that make sense? Because if I put, let's say 10%
3571.96s: of the portfolio to buy the position, but I'm going to control risk at 3% or 2%
3578.84s: completely different scenario. So to summarize all of that, it's a complete at the portfolio level,
3587.08s: it's this exercise, essentially reverse engineering based on what you're trying to do.
3592.76s: This down here is based solely on the strategy that you're trading based on the strategy. How does
3598.92s: it behave? What does that mean? If I have a high losing rate strategy, it means that I'm going to
3605.16s: have to make sure that the risk is controlled. If I have a high win rate strategy, it means I'm going
3610.60s: to accept slightly lower winners size and I'm going to accept slightly bigger losses because that's
3618.68s: how the probabilities are going to bear out. That's a great question. Shahzad says the only thing I
3625.24s: noticed is that when the markets are down, I do better is option premium offset the losses, but when
3629.72s: the market runs up, I underperform. That could be the case. It just means that you're not doing a good
3635.80s: job adapting to the market. That's what I would consider there.
3642.36s: One of the main jobs you have as a trader is being able to move in between things. Again,
3649.56s: if you choose to stick to a fastball, meaning one specific market effect or one specific approach,
3656.92s: that's fine, but it means that there's going to absolutely be periods where you're sitting out
3660.84s: or where you're not doing anything and that's going to be normal.
3664.44s: Now, for me, the way that I typically would try to trade is just to be a little bit more adaptable.
3669.96s: Now, it doesn't mean that you have to be like sitting in front of the computer. That's at least
3673.80s: the last thing I would ever want to do. Trading is one of those things where the vast majority
3678.44s: of the work is done now. It's done on the Friday evening when the market's closed and you're going
3684.44s: through conducting research. Then the amount of time that I would spend trading during the day,
3690.28s: I mean, you have to think, I spent a long time on active duty in the military.
3694.76s: Effectively, no time. There's very little time during the day to sit on check out the markets
3700.36s: that effectively would very rarely happen because even the spots that I were on base, I didn't get
3704.52s: sell service. So what that means is you have to figure out what your approach to trading is going
3713.00s: to be. For me, it was to try and be able to take advantage of different market conditions.
3719.40s: So because of that, I need to have a slightly more varied toolkit to be able to do so.
3725.32s: It's a good question. Cool. If you guys have anything else, please throw it in the chat. There
3732.84s: was a couple other questions that I did want to get to from the email and Thor's
3736.12s: scratching at the door, BRB.
3753.80s: Here he is. He heard that there was a Q&A going on. So we opted to come say hi to everybody and
3764.44s: come check it out. Oh boy. I can't get his vibe. He looks a little reserved.
3774.52s: He's grown, he's grown tired and weary based on you guys. That's what I'm getting. Let's see.
3784.36s: He's still hooking it up with the paw. Oh boy. Oh, bad.
3791.56s: Okay. So one of, this was another one that I literally couldn't identify more with.
3806.92s: Here. So this is something that takes a really long time to get your arms around.
3815.16s: So essentially they were asking like, why would they emphasize consistency and iteration over
3824.20s: trying to get better returns? And it's such a funny question because I entirely understand where
3831.16s: they're coming from. But the ultimate troll in this question is the fact that if you emphasize
3839.80s: consistency and iteration, that's ultimately what yields. I returns. It's literally
3847.80s: comical in that way. But that's exactly the case here.
3854.04s: So the reason why it's such an important thing to follow along with
3861.00s: is because think of anything that you've ever tried to get better at in your life. Anything.
3868.60s: The first thing that you will be told is that you need to practice. And the point of practice
3876.20s: is to build repetitions. Then the concept during those repetitions is to slowly refine the movement
3887.08s: or the exercise of whatever you're doing so that you can become better at it. More efficient,
3895.08s: whatever the thing is, if you're into music and you play instruments, I never did other than
3901.24s: whatever that thing is you playing like fourth grade, the recorder, whatever it is that nobody ever
3906.36s: sounds good at that thing. I did that and I sucked with everybody else. But if I ever wanted to get
3912.92s: good, does anybody ever actually get good at the recorder? Are there like people that are banging
3919.88s: with the recorder? Because I feel like I've never heard of any sort of music that slaps
3927.48s: that somebody's rolling with the recorder. But maybe I'm just not well versed enough. That would
3931.72s: be a fun exercise at some point to figure that out. But that exact thing is what carries over to
3941.96s: trading is your ability to iterate your ability to take information to refine what you're doing
3952.60s: and to attempt to improve again and again and again and again. I use basketball a lot because I
3960.20s: like basketball. Same thing with Jiu Jitsu, I like martial arts a lot. I like the same thing if you're
3966.36s: in Moitai and the first time you try to throw a tip that's going to be trash. The way you develop
3972.92s: a sound tip is by doing tons in tons of tips. It's the same thing in trading. So the way that you get
3981.80s: better as a trader is the same way you get better at anything else, which is by putting in really
3988.04s: robust practices and the way that we practice is very different. The way that we practice as
3993.32s: traders is again, for me, typically it's when markets are closed, do a bunch of research. It's
3998.52s: understanding how things move, behave, understanding trends so that I'm more able to read what's going
4005.48s: on and then adapt to things. That's the idea. So this is an interesting one because I understand
4011.72s: the question, but the funny part is it's consistency and iteration that literally yields the higher
4018.04s: returns that most people are pursuing. Ricky says, what are the most effective ways to manage
4024.68s: risk as a trader without being too restrictive? That's super easy. It's the size, trades logically
4031.00s: before you put them on and then following whatever that rule set is that you defined.
4036.76s: So again, going back to why the outlier strategy process is so important because if I decide myself
4044.20s: that no matter what, I'm going to close all trades at 8% of the portfolio drawdown. So if I have a
4051.00s: trade that is losing more than 8% value of the portfolio, that trade comes down. It just doesn't
4058.28s: make sense. And it's because things need to be put on in a size that reflects what the strategy is.
4067.16s: And they should be all put on together in a way that aligns with the broader portfolio risk.
4074.68s: Tolerance. So the way to manage risk is to spend more time planning trade entries than most
4084.76s: people probably do, like without a doubt. For sure.
4089.16s: Roaring says, you talk to Tom about utilization during the tariff pullback.
4098.84s: He said his account utilization went up to 60%. Why would that be expected? Unutilized
4104.84s: dollars to buy the dip? To me, it was actually slightly unexpected.
4110.28s: I thought that he would have scaled up a little bit more. So I would have expected him to be deeper
4122.12s: in like the 70% 80% handle, which I think he ended up saying that it was like close to 70. So that
4128.04s: ended up being in line with expectations. And that's simply because when things are going a
4136.44s: right, your margin requirement is going to go up naturally. So that's how much money you're
4141.96s: going to have to set aside for margin requirement from the broker. And then there's the amount of
4149.48s: adjustments, especially for somebody like in his style, what he's going to have to do.
4154.84s: So during those kinds of periods for options traders in general, you tend to increase utilization.
4162.28s: I do as well, but the way that I increase is slightly different than he does. So the reason why
4169.16s: I was expecting something close to 70, a lot of it is just intuition based on having a general
4175.00s: sense of like what the portfolio looks like leading into the drop, what the drop look like. And then
4179.96s: just intuiting my way through what I think it likely looked there. But the short answer to that
4187.96s: is it's simply because the portfolio is going to be more utilized when markets are going down both
4193.48s: from a defensive posture, but then also from trying to capture more opportunities.
4201.00s: That's what I would think.
4203.64s: Where Enclity says maybe snake charmers do they use recorders? What do snake charmers use?
4209.16s: Actually, I don't know. What do snake, what instrument? I think it's like a flute. What instrument
4218.04s: do snake charmers use?
4224.12s: Oh, shit. They use a pungi also known as a bin bean when instrument made from a gourd with two
4235.72s: read pipes inserted one for melody and one for drone. The pungi is played with continuous
4242.12s: droning melody which snake charmers use during performances. Yo, that is so cool.
4251.32s: That's so cool. Learn something new.
4256.60s: All right, let me move you guys here so I can keep a better eye.
4264.28s: James says, I've heard other people base risk on wing width. What are your thoughts on this for
4269.64s: evaluating risk? I feel like it's the nice way thinking about it, but really don't know how to
4273.64s: refute it. No, I think that's completely fine. There's plenty of times where I'll put on a trade and
4279.00s: use the width of the wings to define the risk. That's kind of the point of putting on a vertical of
4285.88s: some sort, whether it's in iron condor, in iron butterfly, a butterfly, anything that has the
4291.88s: protective wings that's literally the point of those wings is to define your risk.
4300.60s: So I don't think it's naive at all. Now, the thing I would keep in mind though is that
4306.68s: the width of the wings and whatever that max loss represents still has to make sense.
4312.68s: Right? So if we're trading a $5,000 account and we're trading something that's $10 wide
4321.40s: and let's say that we're getting $2.30 we're not really getting a whole lot and
4327.32s: we calculate our max risk as $7.70 and let's say we start with a one-log.
4343.88s: What did I miss out on this? You're risking $770 here. This is a percentage of the portfolio
4354.44s: is 15% of the portfolio. Huge risk. So just because there's a wing doesn't mean that
4365.48s: you don't size it, still has to be size logically. So on something like this, obviously the $10 wide
4371.88s: isn't that you're at the smallest size you can get. So there's no scaling down the trade size.
4379.96s: So you have to tighten the wings. That's your only choice here.
4385.80s: So yeah, there's absolutely nothing wrong with using wings to define your risk. That's actually
4390.44s: the literally the point of adding the wings is to define the risk.
4395.88s: A shot that says how, why and when you move from IWM to leveraged ETF.
4403.96s: How was just by trading a different ticker? Why is because small caps used to be way
4419.72s: higher performing relative to large caps for a really long time? And that ended up changing.
4430.68s: So because that changed especially during COVID when the rate environment when hey,
4435.88s: wire will really post COVID I should say. But let's take a quick look.
4442.52s: So if we look at all of the major indices and I'm going to zoom these out far, we'll go max time
4450.76s: frame weekly.
4460.28s: One of the things you'll notice is that if we look at essentially price behavior
4468.20s: between the mid teens and mid to late teens and definitely earlier. So I should say like up
4477.32s: to the mid to late teens. Growth stocks use to generally outperform large cap.
4487.24s: Now after tech started really taking off that all changed. And a big part of that is because
4495.96s: tech is still a very big part of large caps. So it's led to a strong outperformance of these.
4504.84s: So that's the purpose behind the switch from IWM. And it was about that time frame. It really
4512.76s: started phasing out in like I would say the late teens. And then definitely by the early 20s,
4521.08s: it was out. It was into other stuff like spy cues and trading leverage ETFs there as well. But
4535.80s: it has to do with identifying different market regimes and adapting to them.
4539.96s: Charles that says, but why but then why leverage ETF you didn't use TNA but you're using TQs.
4547.48s: Oh, you mean why didn't I, is the question why didn't I rotate from IWM into a levered ETF
4557.40s: instead of making the changes into cues and spy or are you asking why didn't I use TNA
4566.92s: back prior? Is what makes sure I answer the correct version of the question.
4575.56s: For those that don't know, there's a really tasty water thing. I think it's called
4585.08s: liquid IV super good. And while Shahazad is clarifying for me, James says I thought it would be
4597.96s: more important to consider probability expected return, etc. Well, that's that's way more to do
4602.68s: with the strategy. So that always has, yeah, that always has to matter. But
4607.96s: yeah, that like I consider using the width to define the risk of very, very different process
4617.64s: than deciding like what gets the spread, right? Because that's still a reflection of whatever
4625.96s: the overall approaches that you have. So I would view them as very, very different things personally.
4636.12s: So yeah, like even with the vertical spread, you need to without a doubt pay attention to all
4642.04s: of those other factors. To me, that's a given behind putting the trade on.
4649.08s: Shahazad says why from IWMTQ's why not Q's also why not TNA back then? Yeah. So I absolutely have used
4659.16s: without a doubt leverage ETFs from effectively when they're around. But if we go back
4666.28s: to when TNA was launched, what do you notice? TNA didn't have the track record early on because it
4674.44s: was new. It was very, very new. TNA was launched essentially what like, oh, eight, I think like
4681.64s: late, oh, eight. So there was no real good data sample to go back on on the operation of it. But
4688.92s: I absolutely use leverage ETFs on and off. There's a difference between talking about the coverage
4695.64s: strangle is a reflection of like the core allocation in the way that I typically would run those
4702.04s: versus using it as a speculative allocation, which is typically the case for me. It's still the case
4707.56s: today when I'm trading a core allocation of a levered ETF that's done in the context if I'm
4716.84s: essentially sizing it as if I was trading the same size with a non-levered ETF. But there's
4724.28s: another approach with the coverage strangle where I trade it as a speculative play. And there's
4729.40s: way more of a momentum following approach attached to it. So for TNA, the reason why not so much
4736.44s: back then, I definitely did trade it, but not anywhere near as much is lack of track record for
4743.24s: sure with the underlying itself. And then the reason why I switched to Q's and you pro or S&P 500
4753.48s: levered is two reasons. And it's because like I was telling you earlier, post 2000 large cap has been
4762.84s: outperforming massively. So I'm not going to trade the underperforming index compared to the others.
4770.04s: So that's the main reason for the switch. And then with respect to why the levered stuff,
4777.64s: that's really, I mean, from the core allocation, that's only part of it. The main reason why I started
4784.04s: those examples that I run for the sample portfolio that I share with you all is to just show different
4792.20s: things. So I was actually just talking about switching, I think out of you pro into something else.
4802.04s: Oh no, it was using you pro still, I think, but doing like a dollar cost average example. So I'm
4807.80s: just literally showing a live example in that portfolio. That's only a subset of like what my
4813.64s: actual portfolio looks like, which still absolutely has just the base ETFs without a doubt.
4822.04s: So those are the main reasons why I do think about and expect a time where growth stocks
4835.80s: will look better again, but for the time being just not seeing it. It's such a restrictive
4842.68s: environment for them. Super, super, super difficult. Lawrence says, what do you think about the
4847.80s: large amount of money recently added to the tech sector? Not surprising at all. I think especially
4852.76s: with the recent drawdown that we saw in the broader market, you almost can't, I couldn't see anything
4859.48s: else happening logically. And it's also because tech has become especially like really stable tech
4869.32s: almost becomes safer than things like bonds and whatnot, which is kind of crazy.
4875.32s: Microsoft, for example, effectively started behaving like a bond, especially during like post
4882.36s: COVID when yields were going all over the place. So I think in general tech is still likely to be
4891.16s: the bell of the ball. I think it's going to be a primary driver of growth. I think most places
4898.44s: will see that and likely position themselves. So if we take a look at sector flows really quick.
4907.48s: And let's take a look. Zoom out. We'll do like six months.
4918.28s: So if we take a look at like what's been happening.
4924.92s: Well, let's keep calm services. We'll get rid of the rest.
4938.36s: So you can also see a pretty significant bifurcation between tech and calm services in terms of net
4949.48s: flows into them over the last month. But you can see that there was a massive outflow.
4956.20s: So the money that you see moving into and out of, I also think is reflective of a bit of a
4963.56s: correction from this phase, right? Because we saw general funds starting to flow out towards the end
4970.84s: of Fed. So yeah, I think that's a primary driver is to why you're likely seeing some of that
4980.68s: activity going into tech. But I think it makes sense to go into tech because even for longer term
4986.84s: positioning now that it does look like the tariffs are likely to chill out and likely to continue
4993.48s: the extension process of not having them with that is the case. I would imagine they would continue
4998.12s: to do well. One says any upcoming earnings place you'd recommend for a 40k account. I don't
5005.72s: recommend shit. That is all up to you to decide for yourself. Now earnings plays in general.
5012.84s: I think they're completely viable. We review a lot of those actually during like the market prep
5019.00s: stuff on the Sunday streams. And it's because for me, there are a really simple way to gain access
5025.32s: to non correlated returns. But the way that I just essentially apply the standard approach,
5031.80s: there's a video I think on the YouTube channel that you might have seen. If you just go to the
5035.24s: channel and you like search like keyword search earnings, like just the term earnings, you should
5041.80s: see it. Let me see if I can I can find the video really quick. But I want to see if I can find a
5046.04s: way to show you guys how to search the channel well because I think there's
5053.64s: I'm not mistaken. There's like literally a search box now. Yeah, perfect.
5060.76s: So if you go to the channel and you just pop into this thing, you can literally search the
5067.96s: channel for keywords, right? And bingo, there you go. So you can watch something like this to get a
5073.00s: sense of some of the basics that I would apply. But those are very much the basics. And it's
5079.40s: because it's like anything else, right? Like there's no way that I could distill down everything
5085.24s: that goes into building an earnings trading approach in 20 minutes. It's there's just so much
5091.40s: context. But it's the cradle principle. You can definitely get the bulk of it. And like the
5096.36s: major muscle movements. Now the other thing to note though is that earnings is winding down.
5101.56s: So you are coming up at a point where at least for me, I absolutely like I slow down massively
5110.04s: with what I'm trading now because there's just not
5116.04s: there's just nowhere near as much stuff that's interesting to me coming up. So like PDD,
5122.20s: Octa, those are like maybe we can take a look at one of them really fast at a curiosity.
5131.16s: Yeah, I mean, this does not look good.
5142.92s: It looks interesting from a long wall, but I very rarely would trade long wall. There's like
5148.68s: three ways that I would trade earnings. There's the expansion of all into earnings. There's the
5153.00s: contraction post earnings, whether it's done via entry before after completely context dependent.
5158.60s: And then there's the directional move pre and post earnings. So depending on the stuff that I'm
5164.36s: looking at, I effectively apply those filters to sort that out. But yeah, Lauren says, how did I not
5172.92s: know? There was a search bar. There is a search bar. Yeah, which is super useful, right? Because
5180.84s: you can get through because the channel is a ton of right is 600 fucking videos. How many videos
5186.60s: can I possibly have a ton? So you can literally just drop different keywords in the search bar,
5192.20s: which is a little bit easier. A yo, Mr. J. W. H. I think I know who that is. Happy birthday,
5198.36s: my friend. I should be heading down to you guys pretty soon. I'll probably wrap this up in
5203.40s: like the next five minutes or so. And then I'll head down. I was going to see
5207.72s: the
5212.68s: Mel probably ain't making it, but I should be able to make it down. Happy birthday, though. It is
5217.80s: his birthday. So
5222.76s: Shahzad says, do you prepare your zero DTE to outside more everything? Literally everything.
5228.76s: The big, literally the biggest thing, the most time intensive thing that you do as a trader
5233.48s: is not clicking the button that that's not the time any decision making is really done.
5239.48s: Like that's it. There's nothing that's not a thing. Because when the market's open,
5246.92s: you get a completely different information set. But all of the work is done when the market is closed.
5252.52s: That's again, when you're following that research process that I talked about with respect to
5257.32s: the outlier strategy process, right? That's like that's the time consuming thing. You have to do the
5263.00s: fucking homework to know what exists, how it behaves. And then when you're going to place trades,
5269.80s: it's super easy. It literally takes seconds because you already know what you're doing because you
5273.96s: did all the research ahead of time. But that's where all the work is done is in the research. So yeah,
5280.36s: like, like literally everything is done when the market's closed for me. When the market is open,
5286.44s: it's looking at things, seeing what's going on. And for the like the total amount of button
5292.60s: clicking is so true, it's minimal because it doesn't take that long to click buttons and put
5297.32s: stuff on. All of the work is done when markets are not running.
5304.52s: James says, is there a tool that shows historical price movement leading up to an after earnings?
5309.00s: Well, this does. I think our swim does. I use a few tools that are a little more effective, I think.
5318.60s: So one of them, as you guys see me regularly use unusual whales, they have a pretty cool tool.
5325.32s: So if we take a look at PDD and we go down to earnings, you can see effectively what the move is
5335.96s: preimposed earnings. This isn't the lead up right away, but this shows you the lead up in a table.
5344.04s: So there's that. There's also bar chart has one. And so does O rats literally all the ones that I
5355.64s: typically use. Let's go to
5365.56s: here. So you can see like pretty easily here. The other thing you do is literally just have
5374.36s: Chatchy PT build it for you. You can download the market data for something then download when the
5380.44s: earnings releases are and then just calculate it off of that. So yeah, between unusual whales,
5387.88s: I like this one probably more than the others O rats is another really good one big fan of that one.
5394.36s: And then like this is cool, right? Because this gives you the ability to look across different time
5400.68s: frames and to analyze what the average moves are leading into earnings over different time frames.
5407.72s: Like that kind of stuff is useful. But from a data analysis perspective, this actually isn't that
5413.96s: useful, right? Like this is a cool visual, but I'm applying way more of a data analysis approach.
5419.96s: So I like to download the data and all of
5427.56s: sweet. Any other last minute questions or anything that you guys want to hit on?
5432.12s: I'm going to try to do maybe like one of these Q&A's like once a month, but I thought doing it
5436.52s: after the prior series, hopefully was useful. And then for those that I didn't get a chance to cover
5444.52s: all like honestly, most of the emails, I'll probably try to bake those into a couple of the
5450.20s: upcoming live streams on like Wednesday and stuff like that. So wait, all right gang, well that wraps
5457.72s: me up then. I'm going to go hop in the cool vet and drive down, go see my buddy for his birth day.
5465.72s: As always, if you guys need anything, hit me up, be an outlet. See you guys later.
