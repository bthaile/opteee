0.68s: I love me some irony the this video is
4.04s: going to be about irony it's going to be
5.72s: about Andrew left in catron research and
9.60s: what's going on with them because
11.72s: there's some really interesting
12.96s: information that's starting to come out
14.60s: with a recent doj filing which we're
17.56s: going to go into all of that this is
19.12s: primarily going to be about that with a
20.64s: quick recap of GameStop's expiration
23.44s: today so for those tuning in today's
25.88s: about GameStop for 2 days in a row
28.36s: you're going to have to get over it for
29.52s: those that want to see something else we
31.08s: will have time for that for sure but
34.56s: there's always time in the schedule for
37.56s: Just Some solid irony so here we have
41.48s: citrone research Andrew left's firm and
45.16s: this was back on 3 June and in here it
48.68s: says we what made Keith Gil interesting
52.08s: initially was his authenticity skip a
54.48s: bunch of words this time it feels
56.52s: different appearing more like
58.48s: manipulation without a thesis H now
62.44s: again trying to be as objective as
64.92s: humanly possible I could see a world
68.56s: where somebody could think that if you
70.16s: don't know anything else about roaring
71.80s: Kitty and you probably operate in a
74.52s: really scummy place where people do
76.80s: stuff like that all the time sure maybe
79.92s: but here's the
83.68s: irony Andrew left
86.80s: 54 charged with a 16 million stock
90.88s: market manipulation
93.16s: scheme but but but raring Kitty is the
98.72s: one manipulating things love that just
100.96s: love that it's you know one of the best
103.32s: ways to try and keep the spotlight off
105.64s: you is to cast rocks at other people for
108.08s: the that you're doing so I want to
110.92s: highlight for the non gme folks
114.64s: something to be aware of the ape
117.64s: Community which I still very much view
119.64s: my myself as a guest I do not have the
122.20s: depth with the entire story I'm still
124.52s: learning about it literally every day I
127.00s: am not as well versed in this stuff as
128.92s: everybody else but I begin to understand
132.96s: their perspective of the world of
135.36s: markets and why they say and think the
139.68s: way they do at times because if you talk
142.64s: to an ape or somebody that's been around
144.24s: the gme community they'll pretty much
145.84s: tell you that everything's rigged it's
147.20s: all and I don't fully fall into
150.56s: that camp myself I do think that a lot
152.76s: of the market is efficient to a degree I
155.44s: don't think it's perfectly efficient to
156.68s: a degree but also to their Credence
160.04s: there's very clear examples of this
163.84s: a very clear manipulation so as I try to
167.28s: remind you guys my my goal when I'm
170.12s: reviewing any sort of information
172.08s: specifically investing trading financial
174.04s: information to come up with ideas I want
176.04s: to try to be as objective as possible
178.76s: how can I look at this information and
181.08s: strip away as much of my bias as I can
184.72s: acknowledging the fact that it's never
186.08s: fully gone it'll still be there to a
188.00s: degree but I want to be cognizant that
190.04s: it's there and I think for the people
192.84s: that are not as close to the ape
195.28s: Community the gme story stuff like this
197.80s: I think those people sometimes are in la
200.04s: la land where they think that markets
201.60s: are efficient it's all fair it's
203.32s: competitively priced and then that's one
205.80s: of the reasons why some of those folks
208.04s: might make the jump and say oh you know
210.84s: the the gme community they're they're
212.68s: all tinfoil hats conspiracy theorists
215.52s: they've all gone off the deep end and
217.28s: it's so easy to dismiss broad Concepts
220.00s: and ideas like that and lose all of the
222.04s: Nuance because something gets people to
224.76s: that level so what I would say for the
228.44s: people that aren't familiar with the gme
231.08s: story this is why this is why you have
235.08s: people in the ape community that are
236.64s: like this is all and how could
238.88s: you blame them you have some dude that's
241.36s: throwing rocks at somebody talking about
243.08s: manipulation yet this guy has what 17
247.88s: counts of Securities fraud and one count
250.56s: of Securities fraud scheme like that's
254.20s: really difficult to reconcile now for
256.96s: the gme folks I also think it's
258.96s: important to not go too far to where you
261.68s: think everything is rigged because then
264.84s: it kind of begs the question why even do
267.52s: why do anything here right so so to me
270.64s: the truth typically lies in the middle
272.88s: of perspectives like this to a degree
275.24s: but it is really important to
277.88s: acknowledge that when people hear about
279.84s: GameStop the ape Community the gme
282.04s: movement like all those kinds of things
284.16s: it's not this radical idea there are
287.48s: clear and very
290.20s: straightforward elements of different
292.64s: kinds of Market manipulation to
294.20s: different degrees different kinds of
295.68s: fraud that are in Broad daylight
299.08s: that nothing has happened for a long
301.00s: time and now it looks like the SEC is
304.08s: finally doing something now this goes
307.40s: down a whole other path where I see
308.88s: people saying like oh well this doesn't
310.72s: fix anything or this is just a drop in
312.52s: the bucket and I don't disagree this
314.32s: doesn't inherently fix anything this is
316.20s: this this is not even anything yet right
318.80s: these are just charges this is just an
320.60s: accusation technically he's not
322.32s: convicted of so we're we're at the
325.84s: very infancy of all of this but what I
328.28s: try to remind people is that it's a step
331.40s: in the right direction and if you ever
333.56s: get to the point where you're so
335.80s: disenfranchised that a step in the right
337.96s: direction still is meaningless to you
341.08s: then you probably got to try and reenter
343.72s: yourself just a little bit so that you
345.96s: can at least see that this is this is at
348.80s: least a positive direction does this
351.40s: entirely fix everything absolutely not
353.56s: absolutely not but it's something and
356.92s: seeing stuff like this starting to come
358.88s: to light
360.16s: is encouraging to me so I'm excited to
363.00s: see it plus again like I said in the
365.24s: beginning I love me some irony
368.60s: especially when you have some sort of
370.00s: shitty person like this that's throwing
372.36s: rocks at somebody else that's being
374.36s: accused of this now it is important to
378.56s: say that he's charged he's accused of
382.88s: this this doesn't mean he did this and
385.60s: again trying to be middle of the road
388.36s: and to try to allow system some time to
390.68s: work then based on the rest of the
393.16s: evidence that we see based on the
394.92s: arguments that come out then we can make
396.76s: a decision an educated one but right now
399.48s: he's just charged with this stuff so I
402.96s: probably again like to just bear myself
406.16s: to you guys my bias is I think this dude
409.04s: did this I do think that but I'm
412.00s: not going to let that bias dictate to me
414.40s: that I conclude with him being charged
417.56s: that he did do it I need to the
419.84s: information still but I do lean that way
423.16s: now the other important thing here is
425.84s: that he might have done some of this
428.52s: typically when people are going to be
429.68s: charged like this they the doj is going
431.68s: to come with everything that they can
432.96s: find in the hopes that as much of it
434.96s: sticks as possible there's also a
437.08s: reality where he did more than this and
439.28s: this is just what the doj thinks that
441.72s: they can pin to him all of that boils
444.84s: down to the fact that something is
446.44s: happening here and I'm really really
449.00s: excited to see how this plays out and
450.96s: what kind of attention this gets that's
452.60s: the thing I'm that's why I'm making a
453.72s: video about it I'm not in a turny I
455.24s: don't know anything about any of this
456.36s: stuff I like I said I don't even know
457.92s: that much about GameStop I've been
459.00s: learning about it for a few months now
461.28s: and I have a long way to go before I
462.76s: fully know all the details in the story
465.32s: but I'm really excited to see this and
467.92s: I'm trying to help spread information
470.52s: about it because I think it's important
472.00s: that this gets out far and wide so
474.84s: that people can stop looking at the gme
477.32s: and the Apes as just tin foil had people
480.04s: that have gone off the deep end and
481.52s: start to understand some of the
482.72s: perspective but then also to see that
484.24s: there's some going on in the
486.36s: market and people need to be aware of it
488.40s: and I see this as the doj finally
491.24s: starting to even pretend to do something
493.24s: about it whether I'm eager to see how
495.24s: this goes based on another case recently
498.08s: with uh Atlas and all those guys there
500.08s: was some nasty components to that that
502.04s: left a bunch of those guys getting off
504.12s: which is kind of frustrating to see
505.56s: because that one was also pretty clear
507.60s: based on the evidence that I saw that
510.04s: there was some shady things going on but
512.68s: because of some technicalities
514.52s: essentially quite a few of them got off
517.52s: which the funny part about that though
518.60s: is one of them took a plea deal in the
520.40s: beginning and I think that one that one
522.60s: took the plea so they obviously are
524.16s: getting hammered to a degree where
525.48s: everybody else got off CU they fought
526.92s: through it but I mean they rolled the
528.32s: dice and they were able to navigate it
531.16s: so I guess that part is okay for them
534.12s: but it's shitty to see that case go like
536.08s: that so I hope this doesn't follow that
538.16s: example but let's see what this is so it
541.40s: says if convicted he faces up to 25
543.60s: years in prison on the Securities fraud
545.80s: scheme 20 years in prison on each
549.44s: Securities fraud count so there's 17 of
552.88s: those depending on what the average
554.64s: lifespan is and depending on how fast
557.08s: Elon Musk can start implanting chips in
559.16s: people's brains and replacing limbs
561.40s: we'll see but based on current human
563.96s: biology this is the rest of this dude's
566.08s: life in 5 years in prison on the false
569.40s: statements count which this one right
571.44s: here separately the sec's complaint
574.92s: alleges that left engaged in a 20
577.72s: million multi-year scheme to defraud
580.76s: followers by publishing false and
582.52s: misleading statements regarding his
584.04s: supposed stock trading recommendations
587.28s: the SEC is seeking
589.88s: disgorgement not going to lie no idea
592.24s: what that means in this
593.64s: context active giving up something okay
596.40s: so you got to give stuff up prejudgment
598.72s: interest and civil monetary penalties
601.08s: against left and his companies satron
602.96s: and conduct based injunctions an officer
607.20s: and director bar and a penny stock bar
610.12s: so essentially not letting him
611.80s: participate in Securities the other side
614.72s: I think that the government interest is
616.32s: trying to regulate through cases they
619.68s: prosecute as a result of a mean stock
622.48s: craze um left has been around since 2001
625.76s: his attorney tells axios these guys the
628.68s: dogs indictment is based on contorted
631.68s: rhetoric trying to make it appear like
633.72s: he was telling lies and there was not
635.96s: one lie alleged that is provable love
640.96s: that I mean listen shout out to the
643.32s: attorney he's not even trying to play
645.40s: anything other than technicalities he's
647.80s: not saying my boy didn't lie he's not
649.40s: saying my boy did lie he's just saying
651.48s: prove it which is
653.60s: hilarious so this is epic and it says
657.32s: left is expected to be arraigned in the
659.44s: next few weeks in the US District Court
660.88s: in Downtown
662.68s: LA so here's the rest of this statement
666.92s: you guys are free to look through this
669.12s: as much as you want it's kind of
671.44s: essentially a uh a double down this was
674.28s: just like a good synopsis that you could
675.68s: check out which is pretty good
678.76s: and uh let's see there was a couple
680.92s: other statements from this lawyer here
682.24s: it
683.64s: says the investor plans to fight the
686.20s: charges there is no crime here he said
688.64s: Mr left is a publisher who has taken
690.48s: extraordinary steps to comply with all
692.16s: laws and neither the doj nor the SEC
695.16s: alleged that he ever once published
696.68s: information he believes was not true and
698.16s: published that's notice that right he
701.40s: believed was not true and published so
704.56s: his attorney again I'm not a lawyer
706.36s: there's probably going to be really good
707.32s: lawyers that look at this stuff but for
709.16s: me I'm seeing that as provable and in
711.84s: this case he believed not true when
714.84s: published right Nuance they're looking
717.32s: for nuance here so that's interesting
720.04s: because there's there's not a statement
721.68s: here saying that he didn't do this again
725.12s: they're being really calculated with
727.04s: what they're saying which I actually
728.16s: think is uh smart from his attorney's
732.52s: perspective so I mean this has been
736.16s: fascinating to see going down I'm
738.00s: excited to see where it goes and yeah
740.48s: let's take a quick look at GameStop now
742.72s: so today was I mean one of the most
745.44s: inside days you can think of we had a
748.32s: high of 24 77 in a low of 2411 yep you
752.72s: heard that right that is a just tiny
757.48s: range for the stock 66 cents is all it
760.76s: moved today it just hung out pretty Rock
763.92s: Steady here I don't think anybody really
766.84s: anticipated anything else the stock has
768.80s: been quieting down today's sale volume
772.00s: was massive 97% sale volume and you can
775.48s: see even though that it was that much
777.48s: sale volume the stock didn't move a ton
779.68s: so again it's just hanging right around
781.96s: this area of support and resistance and
784.96s: the other thing I want to make a quick
786.08s: note about there's been a couple videos
787.48s: where I say like technical analysis
788.84s: doesn't matter and I realize people are
790.64s: taking that literally rightfully so
792.20s: because that's what I'm saying but I
793.48s: just want to clarify what I mean by that
795.36s: when we're looking at something like
796.60s: this technical analysis is essentially a
800.00s: study of human behavior and habits so
804.44s: when we look at standard technical
806.36s: analysis we're trying to make inferences
808.84s: based based on standard human behavior
811.16s: and how that essentially leads to
813.08s: different behaviors in the markets the
815.48s: reason why I say technical analysis
817.52s: doesn't work really what I should be
818.80s: saying is standard technical analysis
821.00s: doesn't work because the things that you
823.20s: would typically apply in a quote unquote
826.24s: normal technical analysis approach
828.76s: depending on how colorful or how
830.52s: quantitative you want to get don't
832.28s: really hold here so what that means is
835.32s: for example when I'm figuring out what
837.44s: kind of technical analysis tools I want
839.28s: to use the standard deviation channels
841.44s: the different moving averages the volume
843.20s: profile I'm not just picking stuff that
845.60s: I think I can see Trends I'm testing it
847.68s: I have a really large data set that I've
850.08s: purchased from sibo that includes
851.96s: underlying and options data so I test
856.36s: the objective performance of the
859.00s: different tools by themselves that means
862.00s: without my interpretation of them how
864.00s: does this Tool objectively Work what is
866.88s: its overall efficacy how frequently what
870.40s: is the standard deviation and the
872.24s: variance from whatever its alerts or
875.72s: signals are so that I have an
877.84s: understanding of the tools that's why I
879.36s: have what I have and when I do all of
881.96s: that with GameStop all of the standard
884.24s: relationships that I see generally break
886.68s: down they go away stuff that I see in
889.20s: literally hundreds of other underlyings
892.08s: does not work here so that's what I mean
894.84s: because what I can tell you is that the
896.88s: frequency that you see things that go
898.68s: from9 995 to 65 80 plus pre-market is
903.52s: seldom that's not normal so when you
906.76s: think about the application of
909.28s: standardized technical analysis you're
910.96s: trying to pick up on standardized
912.88s: Behavior so support and resistance the
915.52s: idea that every time price gets to this
917.52s: level people continue to buy it or sell
919.56s: it keeping it you know within a certain
921.56s: range of some sort that's what it infers
924.80s: that doesn't work here because the other
926.92s: thing that you probably would assume
928.44s: then is as soon as it started getting up
930.44s: here where was at 16 from 10 well it
933.76s: just kept going up and then why would it
935.92s: keep going from here so I'm not saying
938.12s: that it can or can't but what I'm saying
940.12s: is that the standard analysis that you
942.08s: would apply to things like this there
944.04s: are so many anomalies when you look at
947.24s: the price performance of the stock that
949.84s: standard analysis breaks down so I make
952.84s: that differentiation because the way
954.36s: that I look at this is through technical
956.28s: analysis but it's very modified the way
959.04s: that I interpret the information that
960.72s: I'm looking at is very different than if
962.96s: I'm looking at something like apple the
965.72s: way that I'm going to analyze price I
967.40s: mean just look at the difference in the
968.40s: chart it looks completely different and
970.40s: if you look at most other large cap
972.60s: stocks the chart will look something
974.76s: like this so what I'm highlighting to
977.12s: you is that when you look at something
978.40s: like GameStop or even things like
980.16s: biotech stocks it's not specific to just
982.28s: GameStop but there's a completely
984.96s: different series of catalysts that are
987.00s: moving the price and that leads to
989.60s: different price behavior and airgo a
992.36s: different requisite analysis needed in
995.60s: order to apply technical analysis
998.84s: because if you're applying standard
1000.16s: technical analysis this will leave you
1002.72s: behind over and over and over again so
1006.20s: yeah things that I really like to wait
1008.92s: in terms of analysis are price and
1010.84s: volume right that's standard and for me
1013.64s: that's one of the biggest things here
1015.44s: because when you look at stuff like this
1018.16s: the moving average are ascending they're
1020.56s: widening in terms of the distance
1022.52s: between them there's no reason
1025.04s: technically from a moving average
1026.80s: perspective why this would crater like
1028.72s: that if these are doing that that
1031.00s: typically means you'll get some level of
1032.48s: continuation it's across all of them but
1034.40s: it doesn't happen here and it's because
1036.52s: of a bunch of structural reasons that
1038.84s: lead this to behave very differently so
1041.76s: I just wanted to clarify that I'm not
1043.48s: saying that you can't apply technical
1045.04s: analysis I do all the time it's how I
1046.48s: find the trades but what I really trying
1049.12s: to say is that there is a different kind
1051.92s: of analysis required when you're looking
1054.12s: at stuff like this that's all you'll
1056.08s: find periods especially going back over
1057.88s: the last 3 years where Binger bands are
1060.36s: telling you that something is supposed
1061.72s: to explode they're super constricted and
1064.52s: then nothing happens and it doesn't
1066.36s: happen for weeks so it's a really really
1069.12s: nuanced product I'm actually in the
1070.80s: process of analyzing tons of different
1073.92s: indicators just because it's so
1075.84s: anomalous to me and I want to know the
1077.68s: other indicators that I don't
1078.88s: technically use that much maybe they
1080.28s: work even better in this than what they
1082.52s: work in the other products that I tend
1084.00s: to trade that's the fun part about
1086.04s: something like this about something that
1087.40s: behaves so
1088.96s: differently so yeah there's that all
1091.44s: right let's take a look at the options
1092.56s: quick we got a few things going on
1095.04s: volume today 161,000 calls versus 51,000
1099.88s: puts and if you take a look it again
1102.32s: looks like more positions moving out at
1104.44s: the 25 so at the 25 we had
1107.76s: 22,000
1109.32s: volume in the front expiration and then
1113.96s: in two a next week next week's
1116.28s: expiration we had 14938 to me I would
1119.72s: assume I haven't looked at this yet I
1120.96s: would assume if I open this up the 25s
1123.16s: will have decreased from
1124.92s: yesterday and my guess is well they're
1127.64s: all going to be gone now because they
1129.04s: expired but that's my first guess let's
1130.56s: see 25s did they damn it completely
1134.04s: wrong that surprises me so anyways my
1137.44s: hypothesis was starting
1139.40s: yesterday I thought that most people
1141.84s: were rolling out now we'll be able to
1143.72s: see how many of these did move out net
1146.40s: net because there was a lot of volume
1148.20s: yesterday so it just means that not all
1150.08s: of it was rolling out it means that some
1152.36s: people were opening positions here so
1154.32s: now let's take a look at the two a and
1156.16s: my guess is the 25 strike the 25 calls
1159.52s: would be expanding in oi that's my guess
1162.20s: here let's
1163.28s: see okay got that one right we're one
1166.52s: for two which doesn't mean much so you
1169.36s: know I would throw essentially
1170.32s: everything I say out but what I also can
1172.32s: tell you though is objectively speaking
1174.36s: there's 15,000 volume against 10,500 oi
1177.48s: so there is going to be at least another
1180.88s: 4,000 plus added onto this so people are
1184.40s: still scaling into these 25s that's for
1186.44s: sure so this surprised me a little bit
1188.60s: to see people still opening 25s but
1190.92s: there was enough of people opening 25s
1194.44s: that it accounted and overwhelmed the
1196.92s: number that were moving out rolling out
1198.76s: to this that's essentially what that
1199.92s: means and the reason why I didn't edit
1202.68s: any of that out and make it look like I
1204.16s: know is because I think you guys should
1206.76s: be completely full well aware that it
1210.24s: we're wrong Traders are wrong all the
1212.40s: time I am literally wrong all the time
1214.52s: nobody knows everything one of the worst
1217.28s: things that you can find in somebody is
1219.56s: that they make a bunch of guesses
1220.92s: predictions and then the only thing you
1222.96s: hear from them is when they eventually
1224.88s: get something right that right there is
1227.48s: somebody who's too tight to their ego
1229.36s: and they're a artist they don't
1231.08s: want you to look at the failed track
1232.44s: record they only want you to look at all
1233.92s: the that they got right however few
1236.16s: or large that is compared to the sample
1237.92s: that was wrong and from a consumption
1241.20s: standpoint in terms of receiving
1242.52s: information you guys have to be so
1243.76s: careful of that because there's so many
1245.48s: people that just like seeming infallible
1248.16s: and it's we're wrong all the
1250.16s: time I'm literally I was literally just
1252.48s: wrong so don't ever listen to somebody
1256.00s: just blindly and think that because
1258.28s: they're making a video or doing
1259.72s: something like this that they know what
1261.28s: the they're talking about we're all
1262.84s: figuring it out together so I I just
1265.64s: think it's so important to reiterate
1267.20s: that message because I see a lot of
1269.52s: people sending stuff in of all these
1271.12s: different people coming up with these
1272.60s: different theories and ideas about what
1274.40s: might happen and that's cool but the
1277.32s: problem is is that if you buy into them
1279.72s: each one of them thinking okay this is
1281.60s: the one and then this is the one and
1283.76s: then it continues not being the one that
1285.64s: leads to a disenfranchised human being
1288.04s: that then when there might be really
1289.68s: good information they're just like ah
1291.12s: it's all none of this matters
1293.52s: and it sends you down that path which to
1295.44s: me is not an effective path especially
1297.36s: for something like trading so yeah
1300.40s: completely wrong there back to this
1302.12s: though I see a few other things going on
1305.32s: as you could tell the chog is still
1307.64s: being built out let's see to what degree
1309.56s: though so if we check out the
1311.96s: oi
1314.16s: and interesting so this is starting to
1316.96s: scale up more so we're now at
1319.52s: 750,000 total calls to 400,000 total
1322.80s: puts so this is now getting closer and
1324.96s: closer and closer to being at least two
1327.68s: to one calls to puts which again that's
1329.80s: the
1330.76s: general um configuration that I've seen
1333.16s: previously when this thing was starting
1334.84s: to make big moves up it's still not
1336.24s: there to be very clear we still have a
1337.40s: ways to go but it's at least drifting
1341.04s: that way and then let's take a look at
1342.64s: these expirations so the two Aug has
1345.08s: 71,000 versus 34,000 so it's essentially
1348.04s: 2 to1 but very light there's not a lot
1350.80s: of conviction in two a N9 OG is 26 to
1354.28s: 9,000 just not much there 16 a is the
1357.92s: next one and again this is almost 2 to1
1360.96s: 200,000 calls to 109k puts so this to me
1366.40s: looks like the next expectation of a of
1368.68s: a busy cycle which again this aligns
1371.52s: beautifully this is very standard for
1373.64s: options this is not novel to GameStop
1375.80s: where you tend to see more activity in
1378.92s: the monthly expirations they're more
1381.40s: liquid that's what's happening here now
1384.84s: if I'm not
1385.96s: mistaken there was a couple bigger
1388.20s: positions being built out yeah so like
1391.00s: these I've been keeping an eye on these
1392.80s: 24s and it's because it's not a ton of
1395.80s: options but they're right at the money
1398.40s: and there was another 2,000 traded today
1401.04s: I'm assuming not all of that is closing
1402.56s: I probably would wager more of that as
1404.12s: opening than closing and net over
1406.32s: yesterday was plus500 so people starting
1408.84s: to build out these 24s that's
1410.44s: interesting because these are right at
1412.04s: the money as people are buying stuff
1413.88s: like that it forces the market makers to
1415.68s: consider how they want to manage that
1417.36s: position so it's already over a 50 Delta
1420.16s: it's only got s days left to go so you
1422.40s: don't want to not have the underlying in
1424.88s: order to hedge these if you get an even
1426.96s: moderate price accommodation and they
1428.36s: fall further in the money because then
1429.60s: you have to start hedging the rest of
1430.80s: these that are now bigger by buying more
1432.28s: and more shares notice the configuration
1434.88s: here this is actually interesting to me
1437.04s: 2,100
1438.88s: 10,000 1,000 3,000 1,000 2,000 right
1441.96s: that's a lot of shares and they're all
1444.24s: stacked like that so as market makers go
1448.00s: out and they have to buy the
1450.12s: 24s by to cover the 24s I should say
1453.72s: then that could conceivably push the 24
1456.60s: and a halfs in then the 24 and a halfs
1458.56s: go in then we have to buy to hedge those
1460.68s: and that could push us just enough to
1462.32s: put us in the 25s which is a much bigger
1463.96s: strike now we got to buy even more which
1465.92s: can easily push you to the 25s and a
1467.72s: half to the 2 sixes over the C and you
1469.76s: get what I'm talking about this is
1470.96s: essentially what starts a gamma squeeze
1472.64s: now I don't want to get people's hopes
1473.88s: up I think you would need much deeper
1476.04s: options chains but it wouldn't surprise
1477.92s: me to see a smaller element of that
1480.40s: potentially go with that kind of buying
1482.16s: Behavior
1483.44s: because it's so low volume because it's
1486.60s: so low volume because there's not a ton
1489.52s: of transactions happen on a daily basis
1492.04s: those kinds of relative style
1493.64s: transactions can start to have a bigger
1495.60s: impact on the Chain but again going all
1497.80s: the way back to was saying nobody knows
1499.76s: nobody is has been omnipotent I don't
1502.36s: think anybody's got a right yet so what
1504.44s: I'm talking about should be completely
1506.04s: filtered very heavily so that you are
1508.88s: doing what's right for you but that's
1511.08s: just an interesting function here again
1513.60s: in order for this to be like a true
1515.12s: gamma squeeze or something like that
1516.36s: these would have to be really heavy and
1518.84s: we would need the market makers
1520.04s: essentially punching each other in the
1521.44s: face so that they can grab shares so
1524.24s: that they can cover theirs which would
1526.44s: make it more difficult for another
1527.64s: Market maker to get their shares really
1529.88s: skyrocketing price I don't necessarily
1531.68s: see that here but I do see an
1533.84s: interesting stacking of OI for all of
1536.32s: these right at the monies which that is
1538.24s: interesting to me we'll have to see if
1540.32s: that leads to some sort of upside
1542.92s: pressure in the underlying I just
1545.24s: realized I'm already at 25 minutes
1546.72s: rambling about this so I am going to
1548.80s: wrap it up here if there's any questions
1550.56s: let me know be an outlier I'll see you
1552.92s: guys later
