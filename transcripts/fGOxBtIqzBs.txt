0.00s: What's up, outliers? Today we're going to talk about the weather, how nice the week
5.86s: was the fat. I'm obviously kidding. We're going to talk about GameStop today because things
11.80s: have gotten a little spicy. And I love this. I literally love this every time that it
18.80s: looks like GameStop starts slowing down, being a little bit sleepy. All of a sudden
23.88s: you get a day like this. And as you can tell, it just makes me smile.
28.88s: And we have to give shout out to my boy Jim Bulls from the discord who obviously
34.20s: dug this piece of gold up from one of the reddits. And I mean, it's beautiful, isn't it?
43.36s: It's exactly exactly what's going on here. So this move was really interesting, really
50.92s: interesting. And there are a few reasons why now let's start with what's been going
57.52s: on very quiet across the board, right? Volume quiet running below averages overall quiet.
66.28s: Then today we run into 61.8 million volume where the five day averages 18 mill and the
76.16s: 20 day average is 13 mill. So we got active. We got real, real active. And there's a lot
83.64s: of conjectures to what's going on because there's the at the market going on. And we don't
89.16s: know if where we're at in that process, we haven't really seen any information. So that
94.80s: could be part of what we're seeing here. But let's start with the dark pools. And then
103.04s: we will slowly, slowly move in because I also want to show you the options side of things
109.52s: because again, there's an interesting series of events going on. So let's grab GameStop.
119.44s: And then we're just going to look at today. And then let's sort this not by time, but let's
125.60s: sort it by premium. And you can see that we have some absolutely massive positions coming
134.60s: on today. There was 4.6 million shares traded to kind of kick us off in the morning. The
141.52s: overall premium there was 92 million dollars. And then we go 19 mills, 16 mill. And you can
148.00s: see a lot of this is throughout the day. But notice a lot of this starts kicking on in the
151.80s: afternoon. This is Pacific time, by the way. That's why you'll see like 1301, 1358. This
158.80s: is pretty much market close, which is very common to be clear. Like you'll very often see
163.64s: bigger orders towards market closes for liquidity reasons. This is very, very normal. But if
168.92s: we take a look at the kind of trades that came through, we see a lot of average price trades,
174.60s: which is really, really interesting because notice what the word picture here, it says a trade
181.40s: where the price reported is based upon an average of the prices for the transactions and a security
186.12s: during all or any portion of the trading day. And it's because these are bigger positions.
190.84s: Like you're not going to put on, you know, a 4.6 million dollar position and just have it
197.08s: magically slide through, which is not how it works. So there were a ton, a ton of really big
204.92s: trades going on. Now a quick reminder, there's a difference between orders that go through dark pools
210.92s: versus lit exchanges versus orders that are internalized orders that go through dark pools
217.32s: still hit the consolidated tape. They're not internalized inherently. Now you can have internalized
225.72s: dark pool orders, but then you wouldn't see them because they're internalized. They don't hit
230.20s: any tape. So these will still hit the consolidated tape, which is exactly why we see the volume going
237.00s: absolutely bonkers as we look at this through like a time scale. Because again, this is going to
243.24s: track the cumulative volume as we move around. Right? So you see 34 million 56, but like it
248.28s: starts scaling meaningfully right into right into the end of the day. So fascinating,
255.64s: fascinating price movement here. Now this is what I'm also very excited about is if look at this,
263.32s: we have some pretty big trades coming on and they're not out into perpetuity. Right? This
269.24s: is looking at 18, on October 24th. And this is almost a half a million dollar in options.
276.12s: Somebody came in, they grabbed the 21 calls, they grabbed 2000 of them. And that is a not
284.60s: insignificant size trade. And then we can see essentially an hour directly before that,
290.44s: there was also something for the same expiration, the 18 ox. And we can see that it's a $250,000
298.04s: trade. So we're starting to see some bigger trades in the front expirations. All three of these
304.20s: largest trades, options trades on the day are all in the front expiration 18, 18,
312.20s: oct. So now let's take a look at the options chain then and see what's going on here. First,
318.60s: let's take a look at volume. And you can see that big volume day, big volume day. So we have 516,000
327.24s: calls traded against 107,000 puts. And the majority of the calls were at the offer or above,
334.52s: meaning we've bought them. And then the majority of the puts were actually at the bid or below,
338.52s: meaning we've sold them very bullish configuration across the board. Now, when I look across the volume,
345.24s: I can see a lot of concentration in 27, 27 set. This makes a ton of sense. I'm sure there are
350.60s: tons of people who are very, very happy that they were able to get a few dollars out of their
356.68s: calls that we're expiring today. Otherwise, and essentially save some of their position, right?
362.36s: Because that's essentially most of these we're going to expire worthless until we see a 12%
367.40s: up move on the day. Then a lot of these calls got pushed a little bit in the money. It's not a matter
372.68s: of whether or not they're in the money. It's just if, you know, underlying goes up, which it did.
376.36s: So it saves them. So love to see that rather than pouring one out for all the the homies we lost,
383.64s: which we still lost some, not a ton, but we get to pour one out for the homies that made a few
388.28s: bucks today, which is even better in my opinion. Then if we take a look at open interest,
394.20s: this is getting even more interesting. So the put OI is not changing that much. It's still low
399.40s: three three three 13 right now call OI is changing a lot and notice how big this 18 oct
406.76s: expiration is becoming. Take a look at all these yellow boxes cropping up. Those are big positions
412.76s: being built out in this expiration. So we have some interesting things to look at here because
419.16s: notice, VAL has popped massively. These were all below 80 just yesterday and the day before. Now
426.04s: they're creeping up over 100 on overall. And then we can see that the option chain is starting to
432.76s: get built out. So right at the money's we have 5800 here 4000. Then we have 19,000 OI here with
441.00s: another 96 hundred traded today. We have 19,000 out here at the 30s. So this starts to look really
448.20s: interesting. Now as far as where we go from here, that's a great question because it's a little bit
453.80s: early to tell, but this obviously is the exact kind of stuff that I look for. So this popped up on a
460.12s: few of my scans primarily on a volume perspective with the volume exceeding the five day end 20 day
467.16s: average intraday. It tells me that when that VAL when that hits intraday that we're going to run past
472.36s: it, right? Because when we're looking at the five day average of 20 day average that's looking back
476.44s: over the entire trading day for five days or 20 days. So if you exceed the entire day average before
483.00s: the days out, it's fairly telling that volume is picking up meaningfully. So now we get to see does
490.20s: this volume continue forward, but what I can tell you is that there was tons of shares traded today.
496.36s: And I can also tell you that the options market is also starting to get involved, which again,
502.84s: I'm very eager to see all this goes. So we'll keep an eye on it as usual. We do have the GME live
509.40s: stream tomorrow at 5 p.m. Pacific time. We're going to continue going through all of Roryne Kitty's old
515.40s: trade. So this will be part three. I don't know how many parts there are going to be. I actually
519.08s: thought we might get through them through it all in one video. Obviously that was completely wrong,
524.52s: but I'm happy it's wrong because I'm really enjoying looking at this stuff in detail with you all.
528.36s: So tomorrow at 5 p.m. Pacific time, we're going to be going through and we're getting to the point
533.32s: where he's starting to unwind some of his trades. And there's some really interesting behaviors
538.60s: that I'm picking up from him. One being that he's clearly not unwinding positions based on a profit
544.44s: target. It's actually right now looks like it's based on time in the trade. Good old tit. So I want
551.96s: to see if that holds up. And I'm most eager to see if I can detect a change in his approach
558.04s: because I have a pretty good fingerprint for the way that he's using options right now. And I'm
561.64s: so eager to see if there's a material shift in what he does. Because right now I think we're in
568.36s: like really 2021 ish. So we're getting to where things start getting very interesting. So that's
574.52s: the game playing for tomorrow. And then later today we have outlier options trading for beginners
579.88s: and come hang out. We're going to go over three common beginner mistakes in how to avoid them
585.32s: and then general open Q and a. So we're out here. We're active. We're busy. As always, if there's
591.00s: anything you need or want me to take a look at, let me know. You can shoot me an email, drop it in
594.60s: a comment, whatever makes you happy. Makes me happy. Be an outlier. See you all later.
