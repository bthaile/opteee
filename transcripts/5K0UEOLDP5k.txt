0.00s: Let's talk about trading options in low volatility periods.
3.84s: The reason why this is important is because we're kind of in one right now, but also kind of not.
8.48s: And I think a lot of traders get hung up on this exact concept because if you build two unilateral
16.16s: of a skill set meaning maybe you just sell premium only, it can be kind of difficult to pivot
22.00s: and find good opportunities when the market conditions shift. So we're going to talk about two things.
30.16s: How to identify the type of volatility environment so that you know where to look for opportunities,
36.24s: which is the second part. And then at the end of the video, I'm going to show you some of my
39.60s: personal scans that I use to help me find where opportunities are either for long-vol, short-vol
48.08s: opportunities in low volatility markets. What's up everybody? Eric here. Welcome back to the outliers.
54.08s: Shout out to the Patreon family. Let's talk about it. So here we are.
58.72s: Pretty low volatility. So what this is showing you is a frequency chart of VIX closing prices in
67.60s: essentially on the left hand side over here in five dollar increments. And then on the right hand side,
73.44s: we zoom in a little bit more, which is kind of important. And I'll explain to you why the reason
79.84s: being is right now, if we take a look at where volatility is, I'll grab a chart. We'll go to VIX.
89.44s: And you'll see that right now we're at about 13 1292 is where we closed recently. And if I zoom
96.48s: this all the way out, let's go even further. Let's do like a 10 year monthly. You can see that we are
102.96s: kind of at these fairly suppressed levels. We're definitely not what we were enjoying back in 21,
109.12s: 22 and even the beginning of 23. So this begs the question, well, then what kind of volatility
117.68s: environment are we in? And let's take a look. So over on the left hand side, this shows us the
123.92s: frequency of closing prices just as a raw count and then percentage on top from 1990 to 2024,
131.44s: the 24th of May. And you'll see that over 30% of the time, volatility is essentially below 15.
138.32s: And within that breakdown, if I slide myself slightly out of the way so you can see a little bit
143.76s: better, we can see that the vast majority of this sub component of overall sample size is 12 to 14,
154.08s: is where we see essentially 17% of VIX closure sub 15. So what I'm highlighting is that while the
164.96s: current market environment definitely is lower volatility, this is nothing novel, this is nothing new,
169.68s: and this is nothing extreme. All of that matters because a couple things. A lot of people think that
174.96s: volatility is mean reverting and it definitely is, but we're not even really at in extreme. If it was
181.04s: down below 11, sure, that is definitely an extreme. But volatility being between 12 and 14,
188.64s: it can stay there for some time. So if you're going out loading up on VIX calls, thinking, well,
194.48s: vol is really low and I'm going to load up because it's going to pop anytime soon, maybe, but
199.92s: probably not. Volatility clusters, it can stay in a specific area for quite some time. So what we're
206.72s: identifying here is that yes, volatility is low, not supremely low. The other thing that I want
212.64s: to caution people against is that when we see the VIX, the volatility index, people use that for
217.84s: the volatility across the entire stock market. And I actually think that can be confusing to some
223.28s: people because when we're identifying the period of volatility that we're in, it's first really
230.24s: important to identify whether it's systematic or unsystematic. Systematic meaning if it's kind of
236.08s: across the entire stock market and that's actually really useful to identify VIX because the volatility
243.04s: index obviously tied to the S&P 500 index, which encompasses all of the large cap stocks or over 500
249.84s: of them within the US. So it's useful. But notice how I kind of tied that chain together for you,
256.32s: VIX, SPX, S&P 500 large cap companies because there's more than just large cap companies in the US.
266.72s: So if we go over here and we go to visualize, you can see that yes, there are obviously a lot of
271.44s: large cap companies. But if we go in here into the Russell, there's a lot more companies. So what
277.52s: I'm trying to highlight to you is that if you're using VIX to then assume if all stocks across the
283.44s: entire stock market are now no longer volatile, you're grossly mistaken. And you're really cutting
288.16s: yourself off from finding a lot of great opportunities. Now unsystematic is whether or not we're looking
293.76s: at an individual product. So you'll definitely find individual products all the time that go into
299.44s: and out of volatility. So the current vol environment as I see it is large caps definitely lower volatility.
307.20s: But there's still volatility to be found. It's not across the entire stock market universe. So
314.40s: let's talk about what we can do to clearly find what kind of volatility environment we're in. Well,
321.92s: I just kind of showed you the start of scanning the indices. So we can see if we look at the primary
328.56s: indices. So SPX, how volatile it is, IV percentile is at 15%. So very low. And if you're unfamiliar with
336.32s: IV percentile and why that's a better measure than IV rank. In this case, I'll throw a video in
342.24s: the notes below on that exact thing, but IV percentile in this case matters. So SPX is showing
347.60s: very low vol. Now let's take a look at the right 10%, even lower vol, not great NDX also 12%. So
355.52s: what we're seeing is kind of across the board low volatility. We're not seeing pockets of elevated
360.96s: volatility across the various indices. Now the other thing we can do to see what kind of volatility
366.24s: environment we're in is look at highs and lows for different sectors and different exchanges.
373.52s: So in this case, we have the NASDAQ here and then the New York Stock Exchange down here. The
377.76s: reason why I like using both of these is because they look at slightly different companies,
382.00s: you'll see more kind of tech companies and larger companies in the NASDAQ and then the New York
387.28s: Stock Exchange and Compuses a lot of small caps. So looking across this while it's very, very clear
393.60s: that we're going through kind of a bit of a dampening period without much going on. What I'm seeing
399.28s: here is kind of muted movement and that typically will translate to lower volatility. If we have
405.68s: things that are also flying off the handle to the upside, that also will translate typically to
410.80s: lower overall volatility. Now if we see things accelerating to the downside like this, that tends to
416.72s: higher volatility and for the outlier pro Patreon members, you have access to these
422.24s: things scripts in the Patreon shop so you can go grab one of those if you're so inclined.
426.64s: But if not, there's different permutations of high lows accessible to everybody out there.
432.08s: So the next thing we can do is take a look at the individual sectors. So all I'm doing here is
439.20s: taking a look at different time frames going kind of from further out in time, 30-day change in
445.76s: sectors down to the five day into the one day. And I just want to see which one of these are
450.96s: moving all over the place. So a decent example of this would be noticing energy down here at the
456.32s: bottom coming up towards the top in a five day period and then in a one day period. That's not
461.44s: really that advantageous for what we're looking for here. But we can take a look at energy. I would
467.12s: suspect it would have slightly elevated volatility compared to something like financials, which has been
474.24s: essentially towards the center of this group the entire time. So let's take a quick peek at energy
480.40s: which we have up here and the implied volatility percentile for energy right now is 22%.
486.32s: And then if we go to financials, that's at 4%. So you can kind of see the point. This is the
491.36s: way that we can use the sectors just to eyeball where we might find opportunities. And now if I was
496.80s: so inclined, I could go deeper into energy itself. But there's a couple other things we can do here.
503.36s: So let's take a look now at some really important concepts. The first one is even if it seems like
510.56s: from a broad market perspective, there's not volatility. There's always volatility. We just have
515.52s: to learn what to look for it. So this list of things is kind of just a starting point for you.
521.28s: Things like upcoming earnings, base trial releases from biotechnical companies or even news
527.76s: updates, anything in biotech tends to be more volatile because it's often small companies that
533.36s: are completely predicated around a single product getting FDA approval or advancing towards that.
539.20s: And each one of those trial releases is kind of a big deal. So you'll find volatility there
544.40s: quite a lot. Upcoming economic events, things like FOMC statements, things like GDP,
550.88s: things like anything right now tied to inflation is quite topical. So as we're looking at CPI,
558.88s: PPI, unemployment, all of those kinds of things absolutely are tradable events sector events. So
566.80s: right now kind of to the upside, we're seeing AI, which would be contracting volatility because
572.56s: most things are drifting up due to that. But you can find other instances where entire sectors are
577.60s: being negatively impacted by something that's again, another draw for some volatility.
582.08s: M&A news, large stock price movements. So I'll show you a couple scans to identify that. And then
588.80s: even in commodities, sometimes if you're not finding in equities, you can find volatility over in
593.68s: the commodity space. Now that's if you still just want to trade volatility and mostly to the
599.04s: short side, the contraction thereof, you can also dust off your broader skill set as a trader.
605.36s: You can look into things like directional plays and run things like ratio diagonals. I'll
611.60s: throw a link in the notes below on how I like to go about that. You can still trade pairs trades,
618.40s: variance risk, premium plays, even if volatility is low. Sometimes when volatility is low is the
623.68s: best time to extract VRP from the markets. You can trade the monthly bond rebalancing dividend
630.72s: capture strategy. The point being there are so many things to do out there that you have to
635.76s: broaden your skill set just a little bit so that you don't feel like you get stuck if the market
641.36s: is not doing the one thing you want it to do. So as I look across my own portfolio so far this year,
648.80s: I notice a few things. The vast majority of my returns are actually coming from speculative
654.88s: plays. One of my larger speculative plays right now is using T-Triple Q. So three times
660.40s: leverage ETF. That's another place that you can find volatility. Now there's a lot of risk in
664.72s: that. It's not quite as simple as just go in there and then you have great volatility and everything's
669.36s: flowery, not so much, but there's opportunity there. Zero DTEs, tons of opportunity and they're still
675.36s: earnings plays as I talked about directional plays via diagonals. My poor allocation is only
682.16s: performing at this rate so far because it's gotten most of the portfolios capital, but I've slowly
688.00s: started rotating that not too long ago. So if you add up all of these numbers, the speculative
694.24s: allocation is contributing 10.9% of my overall return so far the year where we're setting, not a
700.88s: great year, but not a slow year. It's kind of right in the middle. It's exactly what I'm looking for.
704.64s: So when I look across this, there are lots of opportunities and now I want to share with you
709.44s: just a few scans to help get you started. So we'll look first at being able to find earnings.
714.96s: Very, very simple. If you go to any sort of stock market calendar, you can filter by earnings.
720.48s: And one of the cool things about earnings is you'll notice it's kind of perpetual. And what that
726.16s: means is if I click through, you'll notice that even though these are new months, it's not really
731.52s: any completely dead months, even this as a slower month still has some opportunities for earnings.
738.80s: So there will be periods where it can be slower and also the reason why this starts to get really
743.68s: sparse is because it's so far out they haven't announced their dates. But what I'm highlighting is
747.92s: that this is a great return source. Now if you're an options trader, you probably will want to have
755.12s: some sort of filter to make sure that what you're trading is optionable. I normally will look for
760.64s: something that has weak lease and you'll see that that naturally limits this a lot, which is okay,
766.00s: it's one return source out of several, but that's essentially you can find upcoming earnings.
770.80s: And then you want to analyze how they're doing for upcoming earnings releases. I have a video on
776.08s: trading earnings, which is kind of a variance, premium play. And I'll throw that in the description
781.36s: below as well. Now economic events is pretty simple. You can use any sort of website and see what's
786.64s: coming up this coming week. Now you have to get a little more attached to what is topical to the
792.24s: market. But again, right now interest rates, anything to do with interest rates inflation,
796.48s: it's going to have at least some sort of impact on the market. Now I want to show you just a couple
801.28s: scans, some general scans that can work really well for this stuff. First one about as basic as it
806.88s: gets. I'm looking at all optionable stocks that have weekly explorations. And I'm looking for things
813.28s: that have an implied volatility percentile quick admin note. This is in thinkorswim. So this is
818.24s: actually implied volatility rank. They have it messed up. So just know that there's a difference here.
823.84s: But anyways, I'm looking for things that are at least 40 or higher. And if we take a look at
830.08s: the output, there's 206 names. There's tons of names in here for you to comb through and
836.96s: find what looks interesting. So if we grab just kind of a random one here, this first one,
842.16s: XLC, and as of 73% implied volatility percentile. Okay. So you can start taking a look in there and
849.36s: see if anything looks good to you. The point being is again, you now have over 200 names to go take a
854.88s: look at a couple of the things you can look for that I like to check out are a quick implied
860.80s: volatility expansion. So in this case, I'm looking for implied volatility that's blowing up by at
866.16s: least 15% over. You could do whatever previous period today is the Sunday. So that's why I'm using
871.76s: three bars ago to get me into the last trading week. This only has 16. So we can open that up maybe
878.48s: to five bars and see what that pulls up 19. But again, now you have another 19 names to go poke
885.28s: through and see if anything looks interesting to you in here. Now a big part of trading volatility
891.92s: to the short side is trading a lot of sloppy things that have really wide markets that are smaller
898.24s: flow. There's just a lot of opportunity there. So you have to be prepared if you're looking for
902.80s: crap to trade high volatility and you're going to find high volatility stuff. Now there's one other
908.00s: scan that I want to show you guys and it's a pretty simple one. But we can use it to trade a
914.24s: couple different things. So what I'm going to look for is something that has a kind of big price
921.36s: but I'm looking for a breakdown. So we can start in all stocks. That doesn't matter so much. But
927.92s: again, we want optionable and let's say that we want to find stuff that's actually kind of
933.60s: fallen off a cliff to the downside. So let's look for stuff that's at least 10% less than when it
939.28s: was 10 days ago and see what we get as a return here. Now here we have another 65 names to go through.
946.32s: Now this one's kind of cool because you can trade things either continue to the downside. So if we
951.68s: take a look at DKNG, it's in a bit of a free fall. This might be a great short opportunity.
957.20s: implied volatility percentiles only 27% but it's still elevated enough at 46% raw volatility that
964.16s: you can still trade volatility in here very reasonably well. So a bunch of places to go find
971.12s: opportunities. They're there. Your job as a trader is to identify what the market is doing and then
977.28s: to fit what you're doing to what the market is doing. We don't just get to pick one specific thing
982.40s: that we want to see. You can do that but you're going to spend a lot of time sitting on the sidelines
986.56s: unnecessarily. If you have any questions, let me know in the comments. If there's anything you want to
991.36s: add, also throw it in the comments so other people can learn with you. Like, subscribe, share,
995.44s: be an outlier. See you guys later.
