0.76s: man oh man what a busy week for this guy
4.04s: you guys have sent me so much material
5.76s: to take a look at asking me to explore
7.72s: these different thesis and hypothesis
9.84s: and cycles that people think may or may
12.00s: not be happening and I've been spending
14.52s: dozens of hours consuming and trying to
17.28s: understand and synthesize the data set
19.48s: so I was watching the video from Biggy
21.40s: Smalls from Reddit I've been watching a
24.20s: bunch of different Richard Newton's
25.60s: video I got one pulled up right now and
27.92s: man like how fun is the puzzle I'm
30.68s: having a blast from somebody like me
32.40s: that's been in markets for so long like
34.24s: I'm I'm in my 17th year of trading
36.64s: finding really interesting things like
38.96s: this to try to dissect is very
40.76s: entertaining for me it's just a cool
43.52s: thought exercise to run through so what
46.36s: I'm working on now is actually a model
48.92s: that takes the different rule sets that
51.12s: they're outlining in terms of their
52.64s: assessment of when a cycle kicks off and
54.88s: some of the different things that might
57.44s: um emerge over the course of a cycle
60.60s: and seeing if we can project forward any
62.56s: of it because the guys are doing a great
64.60s: job specifically trying to stay as
66.40s: objective as possible nobody's like
67.72s: pontificating this is what's happening
69.52s: most of them are saying things like if
71.72s: this is the case if this is true which
73.48s: is massive that's really important for
74.88s: you people that watch the videos because
77.36s: what you don't need are people that are
80.20s: skewing the way you receive information
82.16s: as you can tell I'm very against that I
84.28s: want you guys to be able to make your
85.80s: own inferences based on the data that we
87.72s: can find and they're doing a great job
89.24s: at that so I'm hopeful that maybe I can
91.64s: help pitch in in a really small way but
94.28s: I'm mostly learning from them in terms
96.56s: of these theories they're incredible now
99.56s: I'm not ready to dive into any of that
101.88s: yet it's way too early I need to collect
103.60s: a much larger data sample I did a bunch
105.80s: of different Monte Carlo simulations to
107.28s: get an idea of what this could look like
109.12s: using some historic data to shape the
110.88s: model but it's way too early I don't
113.64s: want to throw noise out there when we're
115.96s: really trying to solve a puzzle so until
118.56s: I have something a little more concrete
120.76s: I'm going to continue sticking to what I
122.36s: know how to do which is looking at
123.92s: options markets looking at markets in
125.64s: general and seeing what's going on and
128.08s: today is the 23rd of June and we are
131.08s: back at another interesting weekend so
134.28s: what I'm doing now is comparing the
137.32s: options chain from 21 June to 23 June
140.76s: and I'm looking at a few different
142.04s: things I'm tracking this expansion of
144.80s: volatility for each expiration cycle
148.00s: across all of them essentially going all
151.00s: the way out the full options chain and I
153.60s: want to see what the variance or the
155.76s: Delta and volatility is between the 21st
158.72s: and the 23rd I want to see how they're
160.64s: calculating that on a all per day
163.36s: remaining and I'm kind of building this
166.16s: out in parallel because one of my ideas
169.24s: is market makers are pretty smart so if
172.92s: this is something that we on the retail
175.04s: side are starting to get a glimpse at my
177.64s: hypothesis is the market makers already
179.60s: know all of this I have to make that
181.52s: assumption because they get to see all
183.24s: this data we're piecing it together from
184.88s: all these other pieces and yet they
187.24s: already have the picture because they're
189.40s: pretty much the ones executing it in
191.72s: especially in biggy Small's idea in
194.12s: terms of them internalizing orders
196.24s: there's a lot of questions I have with
197.64s: that just in terms of the sourcing of
199.28s: the shares and stuff like that but again
201.96s: I'm not looking to add a bunch of
203.04s: conjecture out there I'm just looking to
204.84s: understand right now right just like our
207.72s: boy what was it seven habits highly
210.04s: successful people seek first to
212.36s: understand then to be understood so I'm
214.28s: very much in that first phase seeking to
217.00s: understand now when I look across the
219.96s: options chains the very first thing I'm
222.36s: noticing is that the absolute gross
226.00s: variance in volatility per day is
228.84s: essentially happening 19 July and in
233.12s: because that takes us even to 20% or
237.20s: 0.2% V variance on a per day basis going
241.72s: out 26 DTE and then it really starts to
244.12s: drop off precipitously beyond that so
247.08s: what that tells me is that we're still
248.88s: seeing relatively more action in these
252.08s: near-term expirations which is very
253.88s: common that's nothing super novel with
256.56s: options in general the front expirations
259.28s: derivatives really across the board
260.64s: we'll see way more activity in the front
262.72s: expirations they're going to be more
263.80s: liquid more active stuff like that so
266.96s: nothing in here screaming at me as
269.96s: strange what is strange to me though is
273.28s: looking at the variance variance in
275.84s: volatility between this coming week and
277.92s: the next week this is very big so the
281.32s: change that we we've seen so far in
283.64s: volatility from the 21st to the 23rd for
286.28s: this 28 June expiration cycle is not
288.88s: insignificant the 27.7 point variance
292.44s: invol which is
295.52s: 5.55% Vol per day as compared to
298.28s: everything else which is sub 1%
300.44s: so again this goes back to kind of this
303.40s: standard game of hypothesizing what's
305.96s: going on and one of the things I noticed
308.32s: right out of the gate let's look at the
310.28s: out of the
311.16s: monies is that we're seeing the same
316.20s: massive call implied volatility skew so
319.80s: again the reason why I put the cursor
321.96s: here is so that you can see where it
323.88s: caps out on the put side which is right
325.76s: now like 487 488 something like that and
328.92s: on the call side we have vs all the way
331.84s: out at the 128s that's like
335.12s: 580 and again we can confirm it by going
337.88s: out here we could pop out to those 128s
340.28s: take a look at the current Vault 580
341.72s: right on the nose so a few things going
344.32s: on here the first one there's a lot of
345.96s: activity in these really far out of the
347.44s: monies and this is probably a lot of
350.04s: people throwing their money away
351.20s: genuinely speaking and I don't want to
352.40s: see that and I say it that way because I
355.56s: made a video that I'll link in the
357.52s: description below for you to check out
358.84s: on how to buy call options specifically
361.24s: and things like GameStop smarter because
363.64s: what's happening is the market makers
366.04s: are juicing up these really far outof
368.60s: of-the money premiums and again this
371.00s: isn't necessarily to like screw it to
373.20s: the retail Traders it's because if they
375.84s: assess risk that's where they're going
378.28s: to try and cover their risk and what
380.04s: that means is as they're trying to make
381.80s: a market way out here in the nose bleeds
384.56s: they have to carry this crazy inventory
387.16s: that again for something like Gam stop
389.84s: there's always the puncher chance that
392.16s: this thing just flies off the handle and
394.00s: you don't know when yet waiting to see
397.28s: how much Headway we can make on these
398.96s: different cycle hypothesis but right now
402.16s: we really don't have a
403.76s: concrete understanding of when they kick
405.76s: off or not and I actually one of the
408.56s: things one of the reasons why I'm
409.48s: tracking volatility like this is I
411.24s: actually think we might be able to see
413.04s: the market makers pricing it in if they
415.04s: know it's going to happen before it
416.88s: happens now it's kind of difficult
418.84s: because sometimes with these really far
420.16s: out of the money strikes there will be
421.84s: kind of flash orders that get sent out
423.64s: there by the market makers and that's
424.96s: because they don't want to expose their
427.12s: volatility calculations if there's no
428.72s: Market being made right now so
430.36s: essentially what that means is they'll
431.84s: rest orders at a v that they don't
434.68s: actually think it is right now but if
437.20s: people start coming in to kind of trade
439.12s: on the market they would update their
440.72s: orders and this is more of competition
443.16s: between market makers as compared to you
445.32s: versus them but anyway you should know
448.24s: that that's a thing as well
450.04s: so when I am looking at this chain I'm
453.00s: seeing a ton of really far outof the-
455.28s: money options now this becomes really
459.28s: really important if big if if GameStop
464.00s: starts Rising like crazy if GameStop
467.96s: starts flying up this creates massive
472.24s: buying demand from market makers because
475.04s: here's the deal right now even for these
477.64s: right here for example there's
480.76s: 14,600 volume at the 30s it looks like
484.84s: and they're only a 21 Delta so right now
487.88s: the market makers aren't super
490.04s: incentivized to carry a full hedge they
492.84s: probably maybe useing synthetics the way
496.08s: that they do their business is obviously
497.56s: discreet to them I don't know but we
500.20s: know kind of the general approaches that
502.12s: they will take what we do know is that
504.24s: there's no incentive for them to have
506.08s: 100 shares in their account to cover
508.08s: this 21 Delta position we know that the
511.08s: reason why it becomes really interesting
512.80s: if there's a big price increase is
514.80s: because as these get closer to at the
517.60s: money the market makers need to
519.48s: accumulate more shares unless they can
521.24s: internalize the order meaning provide
523.60s: from their own
524.92s: inventory that creates buying pressure
528.40s: the more that that happens the more that
530.76s: they have to hedge this is exactly what
533.12s: a gamma squeeze is that's the primary
535.28s: differentiator between a gamma squeeze
537.08s: and a short squeeze is a gamma squeeze
539.60s: is driven by market maker activities
542.56s: they're just trying to hedge their
543.60s: position to capture the bidas spread and
545.40s: go home with the money that they made on
547.48s: the spread but in order to do that they
549.72s: need to get rid of and scrub off the
551.88s: excess risk because the thing is for
554.00s: options that are further in the money
555.80s: especially you know like 60 Delta plus
558.16s: they already have most of the position
559.68s: if not all of it hedged especially as it
561.64s: gets closer to expiration but for these
564.20s: out of the monies they're not at that
566.16s: point because they're more likely than
568.00s: not going to expire out of the money but
570.64s: if for whatever reason there's a
572.76s: catalyst that starts driving price then
575.04s: they're forced to start hedging these in
577.52s: a really short-term time frame that is
579.88s: where things start to get very
581.68s: interesting does that mean that's going
583.52s: to happen this week we have no idea yet
585.24s: we literally have no idea yet when I
586.96s: take a look at the price action overall
590.32s: in GameStop take a look let me get my
592.72s: head out of the way take a look at the
594.96s: volume it's just become a neic and the
598.88s: other thing I find interesting is the
601.00s: amount of sale volume that came in on
603.80s: the 21st that also very interesting to
607.00s: me there could be a theory that the
610.72s: market was trying to scrub the price
612.88s: below the 24 handle why would they want
615.68s: to do that because then the 24s then
618.52s: expire worthless and that's close enough
620.44s: that that's not outside the realm of
622.68s: possibility now especially with
625.64s: something that had really low relative
627.52s: volume it was 28 million shares on the
629.96s: 21st so going into this week what I'm
633.60s: really wanting to keep a close eye on is
636.12s: how does the front V play I want to keep
639.72s: an eye on this smile because my
643.60s: expectation if this week follows
645.72s: anything like last week is the put side
647.92s: is going to start jacking up which again
650.28s: for options Traders that's a tradable
651.96s: event you can trade the expansion and
654.00s: put side VA compared on a relative basis
656.48s: to the calls side VA or both of them in
659.60s: conjunction which is probably even more
661.24s: likely the case in this scenario because
663.48s: we saw both the put and calls side Val
665.96s: for the far out of the monies jack up
667.92s: into the expiration this past week the
671.56s: other thing I want to keep a really
672.68s: close eye on is the order flow so I have
674.80s: a bunch of different alerts and scans
677.24s: set to track both large orders and total
681.80s: flow so that one I can see if any
685.40s: anomalous purchasing starts occurring or
688.32s: two if there's any big pricing
691.12s: opportunities that emerge from what
693.92s: we're seeing so far at least that's what
696.76s: we got for today if there's any
698.64s: questions or anything else that I should
699.96s: follow up with let me know I love seeing
702.20s: what you guys are sending me so any of
703.80s: these different videos post anything
705.68s: like that that you think is worth taking
706.96s: a look at let me know because again I've
709.16s: said it a million times you guys know
711.04s: this stuff way better than I do I am
713.28s: getting caught up I know options really
715.04s: well that's my space but getting into
718.32s: all the lore and the background behind
720.36s: this product and the history behind it
721.80s: is kind of what I am in the drinking
724.24s: from the fire hose phase getting caught
725.92s: up as fast as I can all right you guys
728.16s: be an outlier enjoy your weekend see
729.56s: youall later
