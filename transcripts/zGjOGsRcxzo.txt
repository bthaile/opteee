376.00s: you
378.00s: and
380.00s: you
382.00s: you
384.00s: and I would include it here with a summary.
390.12s: Imagine, Grack, Grack will be able to scour
393.40s: the internet pretty quickly and see if it can locate it.
396.00s: I unfortunately do not have access to it.
401.88s: So we'll see.
404.72s: I think this is the text copy paste.
407.72s: Where's it from?
408.88s: It doesn't let you post links in YouTube,
411.20s: which is super annoying,
412.04s: so you have to post it in the Discord
413.56s: or tag me on like X or something
415.28s: and then I can grab it from any of those.
417.20s: You could DM it to me on X wherever.
419.36s: Shoot it to my email, I don't care.
421.44s: I can look at all of it.
426.64s: Yeah, okay, so even Grack says that it's hitting a paywall.
433.20s: I'll see if Grack can summarize it.
435.40s: In the meantime, hopefully we'll be able to locate that.
440.24s: I imagine somebody somewhere probably has a copy of it.
443.12s: Just have to imagine somewhere, somebody somewhere.
446.08s: Okay, so I'm gonna read this summary though.
451.64s: Wait, it looks like it's here.
456.84s: Anybody that read it?
463.16s: Yeah, it literally looks like it's here.
464.76s: We might be in luck.
465.76s: Let's look at it together.
468.80s: Yeah, it's kind of interesting to host something for free
471.00s: and then put it behind a paywall
472.76s: because you know it's out there.
474.68s: It's not gone.
477.20s: But right now, Brock is, it looks like to give me
481.56s: the whole thing, so I'm just waiting.
487.20s: It looks like a lot of fucking words.
489.00s: Jesus Christ.
498.84s: Oh my God.
501.16s: I don't know if we're gonna get through this whole thing, guys.
503.72s: I'm fucking cool.
505.12s: I see wigglyworm, you have it too as well.
507.96s: Let me see if I can find it.
510.20s: Very foundations on Reddit.
514.96s: Yeah, I'm happy to spend time.
516.48s: Let's, I'm gonna change the title of the stream
518.72s: and take a look at that.
522.20s: Michael, very,
524.08s: I think that's a good idea.
531.08s: Okay, big short squeezes, what is called on super.
537.28s: Thong.
539.52s: And then I'm looking for the big short please.
549.32s: Fuck, if I could spell squeeze right,
552.48s: I would get me pretty far.
561.44s: Did you say this?
564.32s: Fuck, you get this exact thing.
569.92s: Oh, it's from a common Jesus.
573.80s: Can I copy and paste that in wigglyworm?
575.64s: Is that how this thing works?
577.08s: Well, this work, if I, if I do that,
583.00s: okay, okay, okay, okay, I think we got it.
585.44s: Think we got it.
589.20s: I believe this is correct, right?
593.84s: Hey, yo, everybody in the chat
595.68s: give a huge shout out to wigglyworm
597.76s: for digging that up on note.
599.24s: That was, that was fast as fuck.
602.48s: Thank you wigglyworm, huge.
603.72s: And funny enough, I think this is exactly what Grock found.
607.52s: It did.
608.68s: Well, good to know that we're on the same source.
611.00s: All right, let's see.
612.96s: So this is from five days ago.
616.20s: And I'll zoom this in for you guys.
620.12s: I know that's a, that's a common request.
623.44s: Tor a blade from my lawn.
625.88s: Oh, fuck, it's one of these.
632.64s: Fuck.
635.32s: Okay, I'm just gonna skip through.
640.20s: Back in science conference room, S&P,
643.72s: stock guides every month back to 68.
646.80s: guaranteed you have not heard of the vast majority
648.60s: of companies in those guides.
651.52s: Okay, okay.
659.32s: Okay.
661.92s: I'm trying to find the, like where this begins.
670.40s: Okay.
674.76s: Okay, this actually looks important.
677.36s: This looks important.
680.24s: If one is rather young has 50 to 70 years left,
682.92s: then one absolutely should be
683.96s: almost entirely invested in common stock indices,
686.52s: preferably S&P or NASDAQ or both.
689.64s: Live life, touch, gas, chief real things,
692.04s: automatically reinvest dividends,
693.24s: like compounding in X-Gods do the work.
694.96s: I actually fully agree with this.
696.72s: Because this is something I've thought about.
699.60s: A lot of people will at least ask me,
701.36s: especially when it comes to like,
702.56s: why do I have a YouTube channel,
703.76s: if I'm successful as a trader,
704.92s: why do I have a community, why do I do that kind of stuff?
707.52s: A lot of it has to do with that.
708.76s: The literally this thing right here.
710.64s: Because the very thing that makes trading so incredible
714.96s: is a simultaneous drawback.
717.28s: We'll make trading so incredible is that it's literally just you.
720.48s: And you are everything.
722.72s: You do risk management, you do sales,
725.72s: you do research, you do trading, execution,
727.72s: you do everything.
729.32s: And it's a really cool skill to have,
732.80s: but it is solo, it is just you.
736.36s: And there's this really, really weird thing that happens
740.12s: where you get to a point where you have
742.88s: more than enough money you have access.
745.72s: And the capital is good,
749.24s: but incremental gains of that money
752.08s: over what you have does not provide some sort of like
754.92s: parabolic increase in happiness satisfaction impact,
758.32s: and many of that.
759.36s: It's funny because a lot of people are wondering why
761.60s: Michael Burrie is now writing substax.
764.76s: It literally is the same thing.
766.12s: He's leaning towards this kind of thing, impacting people.
769.80s: Because it does feel good.
771.44s: It feels good to help and share stuff with people.
775.60s: And even for him, his substax is making him a ton of money.
779.84s: But I guarantee you he's not doing it for the money.
782.08s: He has it priced ludicrously cheap for his brand
786.36s: and what he does.
787.76s: But he's getting something for his expertise as he should.
791.04s: Nonetheless, he's trying to impact.
794.52s: So this I understand, this is a real thing.
798.76s: Of course, some of us just do not want easy.
801.96s: Welcome to the trading world.
803.32s: What I tell people sometimes people ask me like,
805.32s: what does it take to be successful at trading
807.24s: or how do you know if somebody might be successful at trading?
810.04s: The easiest litmus test that I can typically give
812.84s: is like if you tell somebody that the overwhelming probability
817.04s: is that if you attempt trading,
818.76s: you're probably not going to figure it out super fast,
821.20s: maybe not at all.
822.64s: And if that doesn't dissuade them at all,
824.92s: and they're like, yeah, okay, I think I can figure it out still.
827.80s: Those are the people that typically find their way.
830.00s: Okay, for them, well, they're God gave them GameStop.
834.32s: Avanti, 2001 GameStop 2020 turned out well,
837.40s: Pilla text, O2, Taylor, Brens, and 2020, not so well.
841.20s: From the beginning to the end of my professional money
842.96s: management career, I repeatedly did not do easy.
846.08s: These are not all I do, but on balance,
848.24s: I've been batting about 0.7, so I keep coming back.
851.20s: And there would be no gamestop if there was no Avanti,
853.48s: trust me, I always do this.
854.76s: Okay, Avanti, third quarter, 2001,
858.08s: looked up the stock of a company,
860.24s: the industry leading electronic design automation,
864.84s: software for the design of semiconductors
867.48s: and was looking its way because the company
870.60s: had been found guilty of stealing source code from cadence.
875.12s: Five of their executives went to jail, Jesus.
878.12s: Shareholders dumped the stock viciously dropping 80%
881.20s: I salivated that overstates it.
883.20s: I thought this could be interesting.
884.52s: I called friends at Zillinix and Altara
889.52s: to the biggest fabulous chip design companies,
892.92s: very local, learned of Avanti,
895.36s: learned of Avanti at Best and Class products,
897.36s: Apollo, Astro, Milky Way, database,
899.92s: but it was not run by nice guys.
901.56s: They did all my research free form in a notepad back then,
905.20s: lower my first Avanti 10K skin review
908.88s: and my first Avanti call notes.
912.00s: I think that's what these are.
916.52s: I think that might be what these are.
918.24s: Let me see, let me take a little peek.
922.56s: I need to log in in order to download those,
926.08s: but I don't have access.
928.56s: Okay, cool.
929.76s: ZX says Zillinix is now bought by AMD.
933.60s: Hi, how are you?
934.40s: Hi, how are you?
935.60s: Says, I don't get why you're so anti-GME.
938.52s: Is this the Twilight Zone?
940.36s: Are you one of those stupid people?
942.52s: I'm curious what would lead you to believe that.
945.08s: Okay, the stock had fallen more or less
948.52s: two times free cash flow and I started buying.
951.48s: I also called their CFO arranged to call
953.36s: with hard money financing from NotePad.
957.12s: The FO not savvy, AVNT not desperate,
959.88s: blank blank most interested in death spiral convertible.
963.08s: CFO doesn't know what death spiral convertible is.
965.36s: That's funny.
966.52s: I like the stock.
967.64s: Fallen where it was trading less than one years free cash flow.
971.80s: That's actually like a diamond in the rough.
975.88s: That is a pretty powerful actually metric.
981.48s: Heavenly shorted, well-known Jim Cheneos
985.08s: on the news, pitching it is a short.
987.16s: Looks like Cheneos was winning, but I kept buying.
989.36s: Thesis had nothing to do with short interest.
991.08s: Pure value buying industry leading products
993.12s: at a discount to free cash flow.
994.84s: I wrote Jim Clark at Brady Wine asset.
1001.16s: And he says,
1003.24s: a VAMT still makes me feel like I'm sleeping
1007.84s: with the village slot.
1009.20s: There we go.
1010.60s: No matter well, no matter how well my needs are met,
1013.00s: I'll ever brag about it.
1015.20s: You can still brag about it.
1016.96s: The creep factor is off the charts.
1019.12s: I think that if I pushed a VANTY too hard,
1023.24s: I'd end up being terrorized by the Chinese mafia,
1026.16s: failure.
1028.40s: Okay.
1029.56s: Warren Buffett, Graham, had cigar butts.
1033.16s: I do not speak like that.
1034.16s: Therefore, his memorable Jimogue,
1035.88s: that a door to Michael Lewis, found herself
1038.96s: on the pages best seller, did not make it to Hollywood.
1041.04s: Okay.
1041.88s: First three to four years at Sion was wild west.
1044.28s: Letters to investors never identified the investments
1046.48s: as a result investors left me alone.
1048.64s: And appreciated the returns they earned by leaving me alone.
1051.60s: No one knew about the village slots.
1053.76s: And nobody was hurt by not knowing
1055.32s: science capital black box was simple fundamental equity
1058.44s: research worked great.
1060.16s: That is not the way of hedge funds today.
1061.68s: So it is VANTY worked out as I wrote in Sion
1064.60s: capitals, investors in early January 2020.
1067.84s: So where did he begin entering?
1077.04s: Third quarter of 21.
1080.92s: Did he say in here when he started actually buying?
1083.80s: Does anybody know?
1088.24s: I don't see where he actually started purchasing shares.
1093.80s: I don't know wiggly worm,
1094.84s: if you caught that in your reading of it.
1099.64s: Anyways, I'm just curious how long he was in the position
1102.04s: for.
1102.64s: So I see third quarter of 21.
1105.00s: And then I see January of 02.
1108.04s: So it's really not that long of a duration.
1112.80s: Within the third quarter, I explained the fun
1114.64s: is averaging down in a stop, which this is another funny thing.
1119.00s: You will always find Lawrence's,
1123.24s: I'm not sure I skipped this part.
1124.64s: What?
1125.60s: Unbelievable.
1126.64s: You skipped the mean potatoes, Lauren, I can't believe you would do that.
1130.44s: But this kind of thing, averaging down in a stop,
1134.84s: that's one of those things that different kinds of traders
1138.64s: will say, never do this, never do this.
1143.32s: The irony is, in trading, there's kind of a time to do
1147.52s: most things.
1148.96s: You never want to blow up.
1150.52s: There's never a good time to do that.
1152.28s: But other than that, it really is way more open ended
1156.56s: than people think.
1158.60s: So the fact that he was averaging down in a stop
1160.64s: is typically something you generally want to avoid.
1163.80s: But there's a switch that happens when you're doing it
1167.48s: at a more professional level.
1169.28s: And you're not averaging down to try to decrease your basis
1172.52s: so that you could get out out of scratch.
1174.52s: For somebody like Burry, it's very clear
1176.00s: that he had a very, very specific idea in his brain.
1178.72s: And as it got cheaper, his bet got better,
1181.84s: effectively, the way that he's expecting to see the stock move.
1189.40s: OK.
1190.24s: So the future performance of the position
1191.96s: will have absolutely no correlation with either the performance
1194.52s: of the general market or further terrorist attacks.
1199.64s: At the quarter and however, the position sat at a point low,
1202.16s: trading valuation just three quarters,
1203.92s: recast flow and trailing 12 months.
1205.92s: Many businesses faded rapidly during a one,
1208.12s: businesses achieved more or achieved record for cash flow.
1211.56s: Yet again, during the first half of 2001,
1214.16s: I will not put prospects for a recovery in this position
1216.48s: during the fourth quarter or wholly in question.
1218.44s: However, over the next year or two,
1219.72s: especially over the next five years,
1221.68s: there is high profitability of substantial gains
1224.36s: as a result of this investment.
1225.92s: This is super, super cool.
1228.12s: This highlights the way that you can think about different time
1233.24s: frames.
1233.60s: It highlights a few things that highlights somebody
1235.72s: that does the kind of research is burry.
1237.88s: He also recognizes the fact that he does not,
1241.12s: he's not like perfectly timing things.
1243.20s: He's saying that this could take several years.
1245.84s: But over that duration, there's a really good opportunity
1253.68s: based on what the underlying ends up doing compared to where you get in.
1257.40s: So this is a longer term thesis.
1260.12s: So the fun continued to purchase security during the first days
1263.40s: of October.
1265.32s: We did not have to wait five years or even a year to stock tripled
1269.00s: off its quarter and lows by late October.
1272.36s: During early December, competitor agreed
1274.60s: to buy a all stock of the common company
1276.64s: at a price that amounts to nearly seven times its price
1279.72s: as of 30-sep 01.
1281.24s: That's lucky.
1282.64s: So this is a great example of a really good thesis,
1286.52s: a good idea, but it was done via luck.
1289.96s: The fact that the stock tripled, that's less luck.
1293.56s: That's more what he was looking for.
1295.36s: But the fact that there was a buyout, that's luck.
1297.60s: He didn't mention a buyout as part of his research
1299.48s: and that's kind of the cool thing.
1300.84s: If you can position yourself into cool stuff,
1302.76s: sometimes cool stuff happens.
1305.32s: All right, let's get to Jamie.
1307.52s: 2018 running through my list, spot Jamie,
1309.84s: do some prelim work, exclaimed out loud
1312.16s: for my wife to hear Eureka, I found another village slut.
1315.48s: Fuck yeah.
1316.88s: Started dabbling in the stock during 18
1319.84s: noted Jamie call options were very active,
1321.72s: which even relatively now they are.
1325.32s: Reggie says averaging down is always burned me.
1328.40s: It can, yeah, especially if it's not done thoughtfully.
1332.52s: It absolutely can hurt.
1333.68s: It was a pretty normal.
1335.72s: Let's take a look at,
1339.08s: wait, what is going on right now?
1342.36s: That's not right, there it goes.
1344.12s: So 646,000, so 650K calls against 170 puts.
1349.84s: This is the status quo for something like GameStop.
1354.08s: It's super, super volatile and super, super busy
1358.72s: in terms of speculators.
1360.92s: When you have a stock that effectively,
1363.48s: if the cat comes back and he makes a tweet
1366.92s: or a post, you know that that sends the stock up
1370.40s: and you never know when he's gonna come back
1372.28s: because it's kind of random.
1373.96s: I know I was talking with Newton
1375.64s: and Newton was saying that, you know,
1380.16s: actually let me take a look.
1384.84s: I need to just say hi to him while I'm thinking about it.
1394.36s: It made me think, I remember he was talking about cat day
1397.80s: and maybe expect him to see if the cat came back.
1402.96s: But I didn't see any evidence of it myself.
1406.04s: Okay.
1409.00s: Started dabbling in 18,
1411.04s: TME call options active, type of thing would play a large role
1414.44s: later, actually no, I did not say that to my wife.
1417.36s: That's kind of boring.
1420.80s: And most of October calls spiked
1424.76s: in volume recently before the recent move.
1427.84s: So front running the move,
1429.36s: they look like this, this is one of them.
1432.12s: The cool thing is this unusual whales
1435.76s: gives you a pretty similar version of this,
1437.52s: which is actually really, really nice
1439.40s: because it gives you the call price volume
1442.84s: and then also the underlying price movement as well
1445.84s: which is a great comparison factor.
1453.44s: All options seem top for a reason.
1455.16s: As an investor thing and game stop
1457.96s: should have gone away a long time ago,
1459.88s: which I agree with.
1461.24s: But it had not.
1462.56s: I wanted to know why.
1463.68s: PC gaming had a major threat for many years
1465.88s: but the console cycles still strong.
1468.36s: Prior console cycle had peaked in 14.
1472.20s: Next console cycle delayed until 20.
1474.96s: My only analyst Joe noted,
1478.28s: GME was in trouble back in 14,
1480.72s: but we had not shorted it.
1483.04s: Note about Joe.
1484.76s: Pired as a cannibalical engineer at a Leigh high
1488.16s: and turned with me.
1490.08s: I don't really care.
1491.08s: Okay, I'm skipping all that.
1492.60s: Pired them in 13 graduation law school.
1497.00s: He attended to become a better trader.
1498.68s: Okay.
1500.40s: He was skeptical in 18.
1504.84s: And he was burr is getting more interested.
1508.96s: In 18, I was looking for that console refresh
1513.72s: to boost the stock.
1514.72s: I was early, I knew,
1516.40s: but I usually am.
1518.44s: And I saw, I thought I saw a number of catalysts.
1520.88s: That is an interesting,
1522.28s: artifact of burry style.
1524.08s: That's actually very different than my own.
1526.16s: And that he does tend to get in earlier than I typically would.
1531.16s: I'm not really comparing the performances.
1533.64s: Just saying in terms of the way that we think about it.
1535.52s: He definitely gets in early.
1537.84s: And I think it's because he gets in
1539.96s: when he sees the signals that he's interested in,
1545.52s: irrespective of what the stock price is.
1549.96s: Whereas I don't really operate like that.
1552.80s: I very, very frequently instead will wait
1557.96s: until there's at least some sort of confirmation.
1560.52s: Lawrence says that he buy options he does.
1562.72s: Actually, his most recent thing
1564.92s: that got completely misunderstood and misrepresented
1567.64s: by the news cycle was the puts that he bought in Palantir.
1571.52s: So he does use options to directionally speculate.
1574.96s: It doesn't look like he's trading
1576.56s: in actual like advanced options book.
1578.88s: In any capacity, it looks like most of what I've seen
1581.64s: is him trading them mostly for leverage
1585.12s: is what I come across.
1588.20s: Stock seem undervalued.
1589.72s: Had a slug of cash.
1591.12s: Does that sound familiar to you guys?
1593.12s: Decent cash flows for being solely in cycle.
1597.08s: Does that sound familiar to you guys?
1599.20s: Some of 18, a lot of talk from brokerage houses
1601.88s: about GME going private in a leverage buyout,
1605.00s: which could be a good catalyst.
1606.76s: Also looking to sell off its spring mobile
1608.84s: a chain of 1284, 18T wireless stores.
1611.76s: I actually didn't even know that that was a thing.
1614.04s: For a decent amount of cash.
1615.72s: Okay, so you just identifying the different catalysts
1618.48s: that caught his eye.
1620.28s: So had 354 million in owners earnings each of the four
1624.80s: prior years, 800 million cash,
1628.60s: poultry compared to what we got now,
1631.60s: and 1.3 billiard market cap.
1639.00s: It actually screened well and was cheap.
1642.28s: That is always a warning sign.
1644.64s: Okay, income came down in 17,
1648.84s: brought weakness to price.
1650.08s: Hypothesis was typical late consul cycle pessimism.
1653.96s: That would be remedied within a few years.
1655.48s: So again, notice these timeframes, right?
1657.64s: Remedy within a few years.
1659.16s: Quite a few of these ideas that he has
1661.28s: about GME stop as well are things that are over
1663.96s: different timeframes.
1664.80s: The other thing that I would actually be really curious
1667.20s: in what his analysis is.
1670.44s: So for those that don't know,
1671.76s: the efficient market hypothesis has three forms.
1675.44s: Actually, instead of drawing them out sloppy,
1678.08s: I will get it off of,
1680.08s: I'm going to invest a PDF for you guys.
1681.80s: You've efficient market hypothesis in Vesto, yeah.
1693.44s: It says critique, I don't know what to critique.
1695.16s: This is what I'm looking for.
1699.20s: I can get rid of this one.
1701.36s: So for those that don't know,
1703.04s: the efficient market hypothesis has three forms.
1706.52s: And a lot of people don't know that.
1707.84s: Most of the time when people are citing
1710.24s: a efficient market hypothesis,
1711.76s: they're inherently citing strong,
1715.16s: which is all information is known, that kind of stuff,
1718.04s: which we know isn't true, which is why people cite it.
1721.04s: People will cite that and say,
1722.40s: well, this is why the efficient market hypothesis is incorrect.
1726.04s: But in terms of the semi-strong,
1728.36s: that's an interesting middle ground in my opinion.
1732.00s: If you believe in this,
1734.60s: you can believe that not everything is instantly priced in,
1738.44s: and that you can't use technical or fundamental analysis,
1744.76s: which that I find curious,
1749.00s: like pretty significantly.
1751.24s: I find it curious because when we look at somebody
1754.08s: like what Burry is doing,
1755.80s: he's effectively saying that he believes
1759.04s: that this is from typical late console cycle pessimism.
1765.08s: This clearly indicates that he doesn't believe,
1768.20s: even in the semi-strong form,
1769.96s: because he's effectively saying these people
1771.80s: are too pessimistic for what this is.
1774.40s: And he's taking the overbet that it's gonna rebound.
1780.48s: We literally worms to superglad a tuned in today,
1782.84s: so I could watch someone with brains talk about this thing.
1785.32s: Well, we'll see.
1786.72s: We'll see how that pans out for the group.
1789.44s: Significant cash flow and cash from the sales spring
1793.12s: could play into a very big and consequential buyback.
1796.52s: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
1798.12s: Still not very convinced.
1799.64s: Kept a position small through 18 inventories were building
1803.40s: in a bad way.
1804.24s: They did a sell-off of spring for 700 billion cash
1808.64s: in a giant accounting loss later that year.
1812.12s: With that sale and surprising large fourth quarter
1815.28s: inventory liquidation cash jumped to 1.6 billion.
1819.96s: Okay?
1821.44s: Activists arrive but not the Calvary.
1824.84s: Permit capital enterprise and Hesty
1827.88s: a capital partner sent the letter to GameStop's board.
1830.44s: Following up on a prior letter,
1832.40s: we are long term stockholders in the company
1834.60s: permit since 2011, Hesty is since 12.
1837.84s: GameStop represents the largest holding for both funds due
1840.76s: to our belief that the company's dramatically undervalued.
1843.16s: And significant upside potential.
1845.80s: We are not typically activist investors.
1849.44s: However, the board's lack of meaningful response
1852.08s: following Hesty is 12.
1854.56s: Bavutary open letter to the board,
1856.88s: a link which can be found here in Hesty
1858.60s: is considerable efforts to engage with the board
1860.48s: has driven us to group together and speak publicly now.
1863.16s: It's our goal to work constructively with the board
1865.08s: to address the editor-in-chief.
1866.52s: Okay, so this thing about the board as well
1870.16s: has gone on for a while with GameStop's board.
1872.60s: Multiple times, mind you.
1875.24s: I find I didn't know this history.
1877.00s: I'm actually learning a lot here.
1878.20s: I appreciate, again, a massive shout out to Wigglyworn
1880.80s: for finding this in a shout out to Lauren,
1883.56s: for bringing it up.
1884.80s: Thank you both very much.
1886.00s: Because I'm learning a ton of history here
1887.68s: that I was generally unaware of and I find furious.
1891.92s: But the history of the board facing issues
1896.52s: is something to pay attention to to some degree.
1901.00s: So let's see.
1902.92s: I'd also been asking the company to do buybacks,
1905.76s: but with almost all the catalysts that I expected to play out,
1908.88s: sold my GME position to zero during the second quarter of 19.
1913.12s: I was puzzled that the relentless selling pressure
1915.64s: in the face of seemingly good news
1917.28s: and decided maybe there was something I did not understand
1919.24s: had a relatively small losses and took them.
1922.00s: Stock kept falling, crashed to 782 to 504
1925.76s: bad earnings and initially confusing Steve Drop
1927.96s: and the cash balance.
1929.52s: I don't remember that.
1931.32s: Immediately, seven June, they responded
1933.76s: by announcing a modified Dutch auction tender
1936.96s: for 12 million shares, 12% of the shares
1939.56s: outstanding at a cash purchase price of not more
1941.72s: than six to share, not less than 520.
1944.36s: Now I'll close that 502, interested again.
1947.16s: Modified Dutch auction tender
1949.32s: involved shareholders naming their price
1950.96s: within a range, the company chooses the lowest price
1954.36s: within that range at which you can buy
1956.08s: all 12 million shares.
1958.00s: I thought the stock would fall after I was not happy
1960.92s: with the amount of shares being bought.
1962.76s: I wrote only to myself as Joe is not doing well.
1968.84s: Wonder why?
1971.24s: Why did he write to himself?
1972.32s: Why not just he said that he takes notes
1974.12s: and like the other note taker?
1977.88s: I don't know why I did that.
1978.64s: Okay, anyways, this should keep game stop
1980.76s: in its range until 10 July, might buy back in at some point
1985.08s: but not soon, this buy back is one fifth the size
1987.64s: of originally contemplated so clearly.
1990.00s: They heard from Cheryl holders that they need
1991.84s: to do a buy back and respond it with this.
1994.60s: And that is what happened.
1995.44s: The stock stayed in a range and then weakened
1999.08s: after the tender was over.
2002.28s: All expected, here I put in, I put 2019 into an
2007.20s: anacronistic chart post split
2009.32s: that you can see prices and volumes in today's terms.
2013.80s: Wiggly says, I send myself emails all the time,
2016.48s: finally something burying I have in common.
2018.12s: That's really, really interesting.
2020.12s: I'm actually really interested in that
2023.32s: because I normally, I just use like note pads.
2026.44s: I will send, well, I used to send myself text
2028.92s: but now I just use my wife as my note pad
2031.72s: if I need to send a text.
2037.04s: Okay, and then Sion got in pretty damn cheap.
2042.44s: 15 July, bought back in a game stop both hands.
2045.16s: Made it one of my larger positions,
2046.72s: had a brand new thesis.
2048.68s: Brought along most of the points of the prior
2050.56s: been buying their hard assets such as real estate,
2053.32s: thinking of sale lease buybacks as a source of cash,
2055.80s: which is absolutely correct.
2057.16s: It's one of the things that I actually still see
2059.20s: that even as they're selling off their unprofitable stores,
2062.52s: they do still have some level of property,
2066.68s: which is always good.
2069.36s: They don't look like a lot Mark Kapp formed
2071.60s: a million, half a billion in cash,
2073.32s: Sherlock Holmes, every note can cranny.
2076.32s: They do disclose the plane on their death 14A,
2080.16s: still it needs to go.
2086.60s: New thesis, apparent undervaluation,
2089.48s: under evaluation, regarded a pinch of catalyst,
2092.12s: high short interest, 74% of the stock exchange
2094.32s: shares were shorted, rising fast,
2096.36s: built to buy back the size, could work some magic.
2099.44s: Man, this is really interesting
2101.96s: because the way that I trade
2105.96s: stuff like this, because I traded both squeezes,
2109.16s: and well, I guess there's more than two,
2110.68s: but kind of like the two, the two big ones.
2113.56s: And I kind of just saw options volume popping off
2119.76s: very intriguingly to me.
2122.64s: But the way that he does this fundamental analysis
2125.44s: is really interesting because you can tell,
2127.72s: I actually see a bit of a mismatch
2130.44s: between the way he trades and what his thesis is.
2134.16s: There's a really strong component of timing
2137.84s: to get good valuation for these buying.
2140.40s: But then some of the stuff that he's tracking
2142.64s: are like really short term catalysts,
2145.16s: but I guess it's a long window expectation
2148.84s: because the catalyst can happen sometime across that window,
2152.08s: which is a very interesting way to do it.
2157.52s: Let's see.
2159.52s: Built to buy back of this size could work magic,
2161.60s: retired 12% of their shares,
2165.00s: thought they had to do more,
2167.00s: and might be amenable to doing more.
2169.32s: GameStop had an usually high volume net summer
2171.56s: that could be a buyback of size to get it done quickly.
2175.96s: All right.
2177.12s: Another way to think of it,
2178.16s: one third shares, 30 million tender,
2180.48s: Dutch auction over a month, 236 shares traded,
2184.72s: 2.4 the outstanding count.
2186.48s: Who is tendering?
2187.92s: Rainew shareholders typically would be institutions
2190.20s: that can't sell in the open market,
2192.12s: but the open market gives lots of liquidity to sellers,
2194.84s: 236 million shares were bought.
2197.16s: Extraordinary of the numbers here in many ways.
2199.76s: Okay.
2204.20s: Mass amount of sharebase turning over increasing speed,
2208.20s: triggered big buy on 15 July,
2211.04s: invested in overstock for over a decade,
2213.40s: oh, over a decade prior,
2214.84s: when naked short selling became very big
2216.96s: and controversial concern,
2218.80s: five volume of ledge comes with
2220.24s: think it's worth selling more on this later.
2221.80s: Also, took to, I'm gonna assure my whole team
2223.76s: that it was in crazy.
2229.12s: This is perfect, right?
2230.68s: Like that is as good of a pet talk
2234.20s: as you could possibly provide in my expert opinion.
2239.84s: I'm not a moth to a flame.
2241.60s: I do not think.
2242.60s: There.
2244.08s: Visit a game stop store.
2246.00s: It did not work, even the stuff
2247.80s: that was not on sale look like it should be on sale.
2251.16s: 28 July road game stops ported directors
2253.52s: focusing on the opportunity to buy back a mass
2255.44s: of portion of the company very quickly
2256.96s: due to the high volume.
2258.68s: We suggest you will never find an easier
2260.44s: safer opportunity to double their triple
2262.12s: game stops at earnings per share,
2263.80s: while increasing change of a book value
2265.68s: by more than 100%.
2267.28s: This may be accomplished simply by completing
2269.20s: the 300 million share buyback,
2270.68s: the board authorized earlier,
2272.76s: given the market cap at 362
2274.64s: completing authorization would require about two thirds
2277.36s: of outstanding shares tripling EPS.
2279.72s: The denominator would be one third as large.
2281.68s: The numbers are striking and demand action.
2285.12s: Bloomberg reports show short interest
2287.36s: of game stop is at 66.9 million,
2292.72s: about 74% of the 90 million outstanding,
2296.92s: again, per Bloomberg.
2299.08s: As the highest short interest percentage
2300.88s: of outstanding shares, yeah.
2304.04s: And I think we've even identified instances
2306.56s: where the shares outstanding literally exceed
2308.96s: the short selling exceeds shares.
2312.40s: So this is nothing new.
2315.72s: We do not recommend public comments
2318.08s: or disparaging disparagement of short sellers
2320.52s: in our review shorts or part of a healthy market,
2322.68s: however stocks with high short interest
2324.16s: tend to have high volume relative to shares
2325.92s: outstanding game stop is no different.
2327.64s: We can extend this enhances the current opportunity.
2330.88s: Good.
2331.88s: Oh, that's funny.
2336.72s: To be honest, because of the book in movie,
2338.92s: felt my name and that of Sion would create a stir
2341.96s: and maybe even management.
2344.92s: And then Joe passed away in four August.
2349.72s: 10 days after Joe passed return from the funeral,
2352.04s: sat down on my desk,
2352.96s: paused for no small reflection,
2354.88s: started by a more game stop.
2357.44s: Letters stimulated many emails
2359.08s: from GameStop Shareholders,
2360.48s: most of which I ignored,
2362.40s: fistedously as I did not want to form a group
2365.16s: under SEC rules.
2367.12s: If I and even one other shareholder combined
2370.56s: for over 5% of the shares,
2373.56s: and we did not file schedule 13D,
2375.84s: we could be subject to SEC.
2380.48s: Ah, and then he addresses Rhin Kidney,
2383.36s: which makes sense.
2386.36s: So when Keith Gail emailed me,
2387.92s: he was just another GameStop shareholder
2390.12s: to avoid.
2390.96s: I ignored it like all the others.
2392.16s: I cannot regret it because I was in that mode.
2394.92s: I did not who he was or that Keith Gail had emailed me
2398.04s: until the SEC investigation later on 21.
2402.44s: A month later, unbeknownst to me, Keith launched as Rhin Kidney
2407.12s: began posting GME thesis taking it up on 19,
2410.56s: engaged with the company, superficial,
2414.84s: agreed to do a short interview with Take Him at Barons.
2419.88s: Another letter to GameStop,
2423.72s: several of the board started buying shares
2426.12s: in September, perhaps in response,
2428.68s: monitoring game stop trading closely,
2431.00s: stock for signs of a buyback I watched.
2432.64s: Patterns companies cannot buy back,
2435.84s: cannot buy back stock from 30 minutes
2437.76s: before the close for instance, did not know that.
2441.16s: I deduced, that's actually interesting.
2444.24s: 30 minutes from 30 minutes, but I deduced GameStop
2448.68s: was buying back stock.
2449.80s: They were doing it through Merrill Lynch Smart.
2453.08s: I used Excel to record in real time,
2455.16s: both buyback efforts and signs,
2456.68s: ownership percentage, yep.
2463.36s: OK.
2465.72s: So then GameStop sent somebody out to meet him
2470.28s: and then contacted by Cohen.
2472.72s: So he and Rhin spoke for two hours.
2474.76s: Mostly not about GameStop at all,
2478.84s: since neither of us wanted to form a group under SCC rules.
2481.60s: I enjoy the talk, which were in many directions.
2484.96s: Like Rhin a lot, deep value investor,
2487.64s: plenty takes very big positions and weights.
2490.16s: So this is also giving you really important insight
2494.04s: into what he's doing right now.
2496.72s: Cohen is doing right now with the cash that GameStop has,
2499.60s: waiting.
2500.76s: This is a clearly a part of the way that he views things
2505.36s: and how we approach his markets.
2509.00s: Well, as far as going investment at the time,
2510.52s: seem like long way due to asset cap did not care.
2515.60s: This is partly the freedom of not running money for others.
2518.36s: This is another big thing people ask,
2520.36s: like why I don't open up a fund if I'm successful as a trader.
2526.76s: And it's literally because when you run money
2529.36s: that includes other people, there are a lot of things
2532.56s: that go with it.
2533.40s: One of the reasons why Bernie closed down
2535.08s: in Cyan Capital.
2536.72s: And you can make a lot of money doing it,
2539.84s: but there are drawbacks.
2541.68s: And if you go back to once you have a decent amount of money,
2545.84s: then it doesn't just become a question of,
2547.64s: how do I make as much money as humanly possible?
2549.48s: It's also like what the fuck do I want to deal with
2551.36s: and tolerate?
2552.56s: Fun fact.
2553.80s: Personally, a whole stocks a lot longer
2556.60s: than I do when running a hedge fund,
2559.04s: nature of the beast, many other managers are the same way.
2564.00s: Ryan struck me as more patient.
2568.88s: Did not talk again.
2571.56s: I was surprised when he took this stake in positions he did.
2575.28s: I met with GameStop Management on 21,
2577.72s: on 19, discovered both George, Sherman, and Jim Bell
2581.20s: were veterans.
2582.56s: Otherwise, the meaning did not achieve much.
2584.60s: I like them as people.
2586.16s: As a result, Hesty Unperman,
2588.04s: that my pressure, they bought back 38 million.
2590.56s: When is their last buyback that they've done?
2593.24s: I'm actually curious about that.
2594.12s: I'm gonna ask when was GameStop's last buyback?
2608.28s: What does it look like?
2613.00s: Tabuary?
2614.64s: Is that right?
2618.04s: I'm just gonna answer the question,
2622.44s: I'm gonna go.
2623.52s: Nice.
2629.52s: Repurchase shares 300 million the board on four March.
2636.36s: Yeah, okay.
2638.00s: That was in 19.
2641.92s: Okay.
2644.64s: Here.
2646.20s: There was no short squeeze.
2649.16s: High volume continued.
2650.32s: 2020 average volume 15 million a day.
2653.76s: Less than 25 outstanding.
2656.36s: Okay.
2658.60s: Sort interest up and then some board changes.
2664.68s: Holy shit, how much is in this?
2667.16s: Okay, we're almost done.
2668.24s: All right, okay.
2669.08s: We're doing well.
2670.12s: I saw the scroll bar and I was just like,
2673.32s: fucking hell.
2675.80s: Well, we're good.
2678.48s: Okay, non-event is to any shorter long thesis dynamic.
2682.08s: Short interest remain at all time high.
2683.72s: The stock did not react in April 2020 stock felt new low.
2688.60s: It was interesting as JKC of Pet Smart joined the board
2695.24s: as a well-former Nintendo President as well
2697.96s: as a former Nintendo President and Walmart USCEO.
2701.60s: JK was interesting because of the potential connection
2703.88s: between JK and Ryan Cohen.
2705.76s: Pet Smart had bought Chewie and May 2017 for 3.3 billion.
2710.56s: Ryan ran Chewie until March 18.
2712.68s: Okay.
2713.76s: Continue to hold my positions,
2714.92s: Game stops, the tension shifted to also strengthening
2717.36s: the balance sheet, which they've done a good job
2718.96s: in reducing debt with cash flow,
2720.68s: which makes sense.
2721.52s: Yeah, I agree with that as well.
2723.20s: Little dust up with the board sign in another activist
2726.36s: during 2020, but nothing relevant.
2728.60s: 28 August, Cohen's firm filed a 13D.
2734.24s: There was 65 million outstanding
2736.44s: and Ryan had 5.8 million and Sion was at three.
2743.24s: Sion was just below the threshold on purpose.
2746.24s: Already made my splash earlier to no real impact.
2749.04s: Did not wanna go over five.
2750.72s: Also traded a portion of my position around something
2753.00s: I do when stocks are indulgence for a while
2754.80s: and did not want to have to file after every trade.
2757.48s: That's another big thing.
2759.04s: Ryan was well above the threshold with the purpose.
2762.64s: The D in 13D meant Ryan was free to influence management.
2768.12s: As well, this was his money and a lot more of it.
2772.40s: My firm was never that big because I did not market it.
2775.84s: Chewie had IPO'd a little year, a little over a year earlier.
2780.84s: GME jumped over 20% the next trading day.
2784.48s: Ryan was 35 average age of the millennia retail trader
2788.68s: was you guessed at 35.
2790.68s: Okay, this talks a little bit about Chewie and COVID and stuff.
2798.36s: Increasingly,
2800.16s: Fresno speculation over Ryan's motives hit another level
2802.88s: in 16 November,
2803.76s: led her badgering game stop to new technology
2805.88s: for a direction.
2807.68s: Ryan's letters stopped short of recommending
2809.92s: a comprehensive strategy,
2811.12s: but made it clear the company needed
2812.48s: to become more technologically with the times.
2815.76s: Gintana to push the company in that direction.
2818.68s: So again, the interesting thing about this
2821.52s: is that it actually gives us a little bit of insight
2824.20s: to how Cohen might be thinking about what to do with this cash,
2827.48s: especially if he's driving them into a deeper technological focus.
2831.88s: Also, give me one second, beer beat.
2848.68s: We back.
2860.16s: All right, where we up.
2862.60s: First three days of trading stopped, did not move.
2866.16s: Everything Cohen suggests is either
2867.60s: already being done or highly speculative.
2870.08s: I did not say it, but I agreed, then the stock took off.
2874.12s: By the months and sign was out coming to the end of 2020,
2877.04s: carried full game stop position three million shares.
2880.64s: There's 16 months, most of that time,
2882.72s: I lent my shares out at very good rates, high double digits.
2886.36s: This is one of the smarter ways realistically,
2893.36s: for somebody that's a holder of this thing
2895.00s: to make good money, especially on things
2896.84s: that are hard to borrow.
2899.08s: It doesn't really apply as much anymore simply
2901.60s: because game stop itself is now,
2905.40s: I think they're still easy to borrow.
2906.88s: If I'm not mistaken, if nothing, hold on.
2910.16s: Yeah, they're still easy to borrow,
2911.64s: just because of the offerings,
2914.64s: they have pretty good capital and pretty good availability right now.
2919.68s: Lucrative, big part of the trade,
2921.16s: do not believe I ever earn so much money
2922.88s: by simply being short a stock.
2925.24s: Of course, far less than if the chart
2927.48s: below represents science holding time
2929.88s: as a top-long position of them.
2932.32s: I have each costs 332 when it really started
2936.60s: to run in 2020 soldaposition at 1350.
2940.60s: Short interest is a percent of the flow,
2942.68s: I accident here we go.
2943.80s: 128%.
2950.04s: Let's see this part.
2956.28s: I could have analyzed the situation better,
2958.72s: a new game stop inside and out thought
2960.80s: I understood the volume short interest to other dynamics, blinded by what I saw as execution risk.
2968.40s: As well, I am a human seen byback shrink shares by third in the setting of 100% short interest.
2975.68s: Do you organizing as a board of directors selling a spring that had the narrative against
2980.24s: up was just bad? Figured what had already been, raw was more concrete than the vague technology
2987.20s: forward makeover, so I used Ryan's unveiling as an opportunity to close out. I had no idea what
2992.24s: was coming. I had no idea that Ryan Kitty existed. I love that. Ryan Kitty specifically has mentioned.
2997.76s: That's fucking awesome. I had no idea that a widely distributed gamma squeeze with thread
3003.20s: the needle to become the one and only legal market corner. So funny enough, this is where I ended up
3010.96s: getting more involved. It's because from the options market, it was actually quite clear that
3018.48s: something squirrely was going on. So if I zoom this out and we go back and years.
3029.44s: During this period, in this end,
3032.40s: this is like six months we'll go back like a year. This is like a year long.
3046.00s: So in this period, there was some really, really interesting activity going on in game stop.
3057.52s: If you go back further, you can see, especially during a lot of the period that brewery was
3062.16s: involved. It's kind of like oscillating sideways, trending down slightly. And then all of a sudden,
3068.88s: you can see this spike in volume. This line, oh, no, you guys can't see it. Sorry. So below this
3075.28s: plot is a volume plot or a relative price plot. And you can see that everything started going
3082.48s: absolutely ballistic back here. This is where it caught my eye, literally in this zone,
3090.16s: which funny enough, as brewery is doing a lot of this really, really deep detailed analysis and
3096.88s: shout out to him for it, then there's a fucking knee in or tall like me that sees something that
3103.12s: looks weird in terms of price and the options market and then I get involved. But the cool part
3110.16s: about the way that I don't think I've ever done like a dedicated video on how I traded game
3115.20s: stop through here because it was actually really fun. I did a bunch of different stuff. But this was
3121.92s: for me, like the calling card. It was like the bat signal. So it's interesting that almost
3128.32s: Rue, his article, is where I end up picking up and entering this equation. So let's continue.
3141.60s: Or did I go? Okay. No idea distributed gamusquees. I did not think more about it during fourth quarter
3148.24s: of 20 other worries. We dropped a very large separate account due to a management change.
3154.56s: Countless over 25% of their assets and required sales across the portfolio as they approach here.
3163.60s: That sucks. During 2020, basically doubled their money, but no new money was coming in as I just
3170.88s: did not market. He mentioned that. Withdrawal Lawrence says you should make that video. Yeah,
3177.20s: I actually will have to go back through my archives as well because I haven't all logged, but
3182.16s: I don't remember like the specific things I did in when. I think that could also be a fun post
3188.00s: Mortum really just for me to see like what I did and how I did it because my expectation is
3195.84s: I would have done things differently. That would be my guess looking back now what four years.
3202.24s: I probably would have done things slightly differently. There's a reality behind the longer you do
3208.00s: something the better you get it at even if you're already good at it. As I've told you guys,
3214.80s: I'm creeping up on 20 years of trading and even though when I'm in like the mid of that,
3222.48s: right, 15 years at that point, I'm completely competent and good at what I do. But I'm still learning.
3228.56s: I would call it at an exponential level, which is interesting. It's nowhere near as exponential
3234.16s: as it used to be. A lot of the stuff that I learn now is way smaller in terms of like what it is
3240.80s: and how broad the impact is in terms of like other factors, but it can make a profound impact on
3248.08s: profitability. Okay. No, the withdrawals came in from others as well. Needed cash to pay taxes on
3256.72s: gains selling note across the portfolio. So sat on the sidelines. Okay, 50 days or so after
3263.12s: Sion got out, the business became the bill of the ball. They could not take their eyes off it and
3270.64s: either could I. January 13, 21 broke out of the teens and almost touched 39.
3280.24s: A stock with 67 million shares outstanding. I did not believe I seen that before. Then the stock
3285.04s: went sideways and falling volume for about a week. If I had not sold and I would have sold that
3292.00s: at the peak. My years long investment might have turned 12 million into a billion, but that was never
3297.36s: a possibility. I also noticed GameStop call options were crazy volume again. Again, that was my
3302.64s: calling card. So this is another fascinating example of how two different traders and investors
3310.80s: can wind up in the same place, but for very different reasons. He did this really rigorous
3317.68s: fundamental analysis a lot of fundamental projections interacting with the board, which is cool
3323.76s: for a long time before this point several years. And the thing that drew me and was
3330.80s: effectively unusual options activity. Like that's the nutshell of what drew my attention here.
3337.52s: As of July 19, noticed call options trading abnormally high volume in the stock, both in and out
3345.36s: of line came before. In January of 21, volume is 10 times bigger on shares and call activity.
3352.64s: Okay. What was happening has been well described, but for those who had not heard yet go over
3357.84s: briefly, retail traders in the thousands eggdond by Roy and Kitty bought massive volumes of calls,
3364.24s: orders of magnitude more than typical. The other side of that trade remark, it makers hedge funds
3367.92s: prop desks. The two biggest word by far, the market makers Citadel in virtue. Those two have the
3374.32s: capital required to sell that volume of calls. This is where the Greeks come in. It is not my game.
3379.44s: I hate the Greeks, the symbols, not the people, but they play it a big role. That's funny. I could
3385.20s: see why he would hate the Greeks because especially for him that's trying to play a specific thing.
3389.60s: They can kind of sabotage that, but I happen to find them pretty interesting.
3394.88s: Anyways, when Citadel market maker sells a call, it buys the stock on the open market in
3400.72s: amounts such as the entire position is Delta Neutral. Funny enough, this actually is not correct at
3405.12s: all. That surprises me that he would say this. That's completely incorrect.
3412.00s: Completely incorrect. That's actually shocking. I see, maybe I'm, let me read a little bit more
3418.64s: for it. But in a nut like this, I would never say this is completely wrong. Delta reflects
3424.40s: sensitivity to price movement. Yep. Gamma is the slope or rate of change of Delta. Yep.
3429.84s: As Gamma increases, making intuitive sense harder to maintain a balanced Delta Neutral position
3433.92s: over time. Yes, Gamma fights attempts at Delta Neutrality. Yes. When a market maker dealer sells a
3440.40s: call option, it becomes short Gamma. Normally, not a problem. Buy stock and manage towards
3448.00s: Delta Neutrality. Again, this is not correct. Not correct. The coordinated buying of calls by the
3456.24s: thousands, all the ones created a systemic Gamma exposure across all dealers at the same time leading
3463.68s: to a systematic rise in short Gamma. That still is correct. Made it very hard to maintain Delta
3469.68s: Neutrality. Fine. To restore neutrality, all the dealers had to buy stock at the same time. Again,
3475.92s: I don't agree with that. And that's a big part of what happened in GameStop is called a Gamma
3481.60s: I have a completely different take of this. Okay. That's dramatic. Not a completely different take.
3487.84s: But there's actually a decent amount of nuance missing from this. I think I have a video on Gamma
3495.76s: squeezes, but I'll summarize my yeah, here we go. I'll summarize like the parts in here that
3508.40s: I just would call out as slightly inaccurate. The first thing is a market maker does not inherently
3519.28s: immediately buy stock on the open market. In an amount that the entire position is Delta Neutral.
3526.56s: They actually very frequently do not do that. And it actually four goes understanding what the
3533.44s: rest of the market makers book looks like. For example, let's say that you have market maker
3539.84s: C for Citadel. And we look inside their basket. Let's say in their basket, when we look at
3546.88s: the specific partition, this is blown up for clarity. In the specific partition of GameStop,
3553.44s: they're long and short calls and puts all over the place, all different kinds.
3560.80s: So this idea that they need to immediately go into the market and buy shares to offset the Delta,
3568.96s: it completely four goes with the rest of their book looks like. That's the first thing. The second thing
3574.24s: is more often than not, you don't want a completely hedgeer position because it costs money to do so.
3580.80s: So if you think you can get away with leaning your Delta's slightly, you often will do that.
3587.44s: So if somebody wants to buy a call, so they're going to buy to open a 10, or let's do like a 50
3596.08s: Delta call. And on the other side of this, a market maker sells this call.
3604.96s: 50 Delta call. The net position here in a vacuum, by itself, means that they're short 50 Delta's,
3611.44s: 50 shares. However, their first way to manage this is not to go into the open market and buy to
3620.64s: open 50 shares. One of the first things that they're going to do is analyze their gamma.
3631.60s: And let's say that this makes them short some gamma. Let's say that they're short 0.3 gamma.
3639.60s: So one of the first things they're going to do is find an option that gets rid of this gamma.
3647.76s: If they don't already have it in their book. So in this case, they can get that long gamma in a bunch
3655.68s: of different ways depending on how they choose to get it. They're going to buy something to get it.
3659.92s: But you get rid of this gamma.
3662.96s: Whatever you buy to get rid of this gamma is immediately going to impact your Delta requirement
3669.52s: in some capacity. It could increase it decrease it, whatever. Then you might go buy an hedge,
3675.28s: either all or some. The way it typically works is if you're further out from expiration,
3682.16s: you're not going to hedge the entire position. As you get closer and closer to expiration,
3686.72s: if you have options that are in the money, you'll hedge the full position because you know that
3689.84s: they're going to get called away. Or if it's something that you think somebody has insider information
3693.92s: of the sunk capacity. Massive caveat. I'm not a market maker. I've never been one.
3699.68s: I've talked to several and one of my really good friends and mentors is one and still is one.
3707.36s: So all of my knowledge on this is second hand, but from a first hand source. So you should always
3713.60s: take what I say with a grain of salt. But you should be aware of this structure. It is not as linear as this.
3720.08s: And this also isn't what causes the gamma squeeze necessarily. The fact that everybody's going
3726.32s: out at the same time just to become delta neutral on something that they just sold. A lot of it
3731.68s: has to do with managing their existing book. But my other guess is he probably knows all of that.
3737.68s: I would have to assume my guess is he's just simplifying it here, without going down the rabbit
3744.08s: hole of the world of options because you naturally lose a ton of people when you do that. So that's
3749.76s: my guess. I think he knows this. But I just don't want the over simplification here to confuse
3754.96s: anybody that's on the string. All right. Let's continue fairly quickly watching a legal market
3763.60s: corner traditionally a corner is a group of investors buys up enough supply of a commodity
3768.56s: investment to artificially drive prices higher and cause squeezes. Very common in the days of railroads stock
3775.92s: bubbles. Game stop specific forums online with pseudonym leaders actively promoted the gamus squeeze
3784.32s: is a way to get the shorts and it was given the cape of righteousness retail sticking it to Wall Street.
3789.12s: Wall Street of course spends all its days sticking it to each other. But that's populism for it.
3794.88s: If a hedge funder group of hedge funds did the same thing executing a continuous days or week
3798.88s: long gamus squeeze, it would have been illegal. If a couple of non Wall Street people had the
3803.76s: capital to do the same thing, not legal. Just to be the corner coordination broadly enough and it
3810.80s: just becomes a free market which in turn makes the corner pointless with no advantage. Say if you
3817.04s: thousand do it, maybe it's a collective they find a sweet spot of distributed coordination where it works
3821.68s: like a corner and is by default legal simply because enforcement isn't possible. Market a symmetry
3826.88s: continues no enforcement in the corner works as he said no thank you carry on carry on.
3832.00s: Kudos to retail for threading that needle. I do not believe this has been seen before. Once done
3837.68s: it spreads like lightning. COVID gave retail traders personal time. Exactly at the point where
3842.64s: in kidding and Ryan Cohen took the mic. Then COVID strikes naked short sellers going back 20 years
3848.16s: naked short sellers entered field. Okay. So I know how dirty this game can get but contrary to
3855.12s: popular belief. I believe most of that 140% short position in game stop is not naked short selling but
3860.40s: rather simple legal layering of trades. What? When a stock is borrowed from an owner
3873.68s: owner ensured to a buyer who then in turn lends the shares for shorting a cyclist created and
3879.68s: repeated and if demand for shorting is high the cycle will become fairly elegant and long sequence.
3885.20s: I don't know maybe I'm too far in the tin at this point but I actually don't believe this.
3893.84s: I believe what he's saying can happen but I do not believe that the majority of that 140%
3901.76s: was legal layer of trades. I think they were trying to sell their box that thing.
3906.24s: But just my take doesn't mean anything it's just my opinion.
3915.92s: Most of the exposures in the chain are actually synthetic sounds terrible. Perfectly legal and
3921.12s: correct. Every one of those transactions in sequences recorded and properly settled the wiring
3925.28s: of the market deals with this just fine during normal times. It would take a very big volatility event
3932.48s: to upset it. Humans are not idiots. Game stop was unprecedented. All that layering, all
3939.76s: the synthetic had to be unwell and urgency at the same time. Beautiful sequencing, broken down dealers
3945.92s: have temporary exemptions to be nakedly short which is also not usually a problem for one correlation
3953.28s: events like game stop happens. This is a big part we have to talk about. Hey yo everybody,
3958.16s: big massive shout out to Lauren in the chat for looking up five people and given five people
3966.16s: channel sub. Thank you so much for doing that. This part is the important, the important thing.
3972.16s: This naked short issue and this has a lot to do with the absolute obsession with liquidity and
3980.00s: a focus on liquidity. That's why dealers get this temporary exemption. The problem with that is
3988.00s: I actually believe it gets abused and I think that we can see it happening and see it being abused.
3994.48s: I don't love that. This is what happened with GameStop. All that call buying retail created the
3999.84s: aforementioned Game of Scwees and layering became a mess. See but this is I don't agree. I just don't
4006.32s: agree with this. The reason why I don't agree with this is maybe it's the way that they frame it.
4013.92s: Maybe again maybe he's inferring it differently and then I'm reading it differently.
4020.32s: But I believe that the call buying by retail created the ramp for a Gamma squeeze. I actually do
4029.36s: not believe retail in any capacity actually caused the squeeze. I don't see that.
4036.80s: What ends up happening here again. Think of it in terms of what he's talking about
4043.04s: and the way that we know that market makers hedge. They absolutely
4050.40s: find a niche that they can operate in for the retail traders but it doesn't inherently cause
4059.28s: this squeeze. You need people going to the open market really aggressively. So one of two things had
4064.72s: to happen. All of the retail trading volume all had to came in all at once driving that behavior
4072.16s: which didn't happen or you have more of a Gamma ramp. The concept of a ramp is very different.
4080.56s: And I'll show you. If we look at the current options chain and we look across the near term
4091.76s: options. Here's effectively what goes on. As the underlying near term in time, this is still kind of
4099.12s: far out by the way 27 days. It would be even near term that really starts to get interesting.
4105.28s: But what ends up happening is these out of the money options are not necessarily being
4111.52s: hedged fully. They might be a partial hedge. But it's because the overwhelming probability is for
4117.12s: them to be out of the money and they don't want to carry the cost to hedge. As things fall in the
4124.16s: money, especially as you close to expiration, the probability of them staying in the money are
4129.68s: pretty high. So you have to hedge that. As more and more fall in the money, that's what causes
4136.00s: the delta to shift broadly. It's not just their existing book and the Gamma on that shifting.
4143.04s: But it's also the delta changing based on Gamma. But then the composite effect of more and more
4151.28s: options falling in the money. So I think there's another layer to this that isn't being mentioned.
4158.00s: And I would reframe this personally. And I would say that the retail didn't cause the
4162.80s: Gamma squeeze. I think retail created a Gamma ramp and then the subsequent behavior of dealers and
4170.96s: naked shorts caused the Gamma squeeze. It was resolved by panic buying, which we saw. Right. I think
4178.56s: you guys told me a couple times that there were a few instances where like partial shares were
4185.76s: trading for an insane amount of money. Professional fund managers, short sellers were caught out in this
4191.68s: way. Identifiable real shares became scarce. This was an absolutely critical, critical, critical
4197.92s: piece to this. If these shares were not so scarce, this wouldn't have happened. But because of
4207.44s: the shares were so scarce. And because a Gamma ramp was laid, that's what led to a squeeze.
4216.08s: Which is again, really important to know. Again, here, no shorts had to be naked for this to happen.
4223.04s: Sure, there were some, but naked short selling was not a prime factor. That part I can't
4227.84s: debate either way. I'm really not sure how big of a factor naked short selling was or wasn't
4235.12s: during that. That I can't weigh in on because I don't know, but I definitely don't think it
4238.96s: really matters that much either direction. It really depends on what the positions were. Okay.
4246.40s: A lot going on middle of 21 thought it was less fun. Meemstocks had become an almost sober
4251.44s: investment strategy, egg done by celebrity CEOs, 21 NFTs sword,
4257.68s: several say shell, I say village sluts. We're partying like 99. Game stops sold over 1 billion
4264.56s: in stock at 225 a share. Absolutely a smart move, which I completely agree. But man, I just thought
4270.24s: retail was going to be shredded on this means thing. I had been on the sidelines, but I felt
4274.72s: I should speak up. I gave an interview to parents and late June trying to warn people. People wonder
4280.80s: why do this? But if there's one thing I wish it could have done, effectively warned or spoken
4285.28s: about what was happening in a O5-07, did myself know favors not smiling during that walk in
4291.92s: front of the cameras, Barry Burrie forever. Early but much less than usually AMC collapsed. Okay.
4302.80s: Hope some listen to any event, GameStop 2025 market capitalization near 10 billion on the surface
4308.24s: given his rate, GameStop that number is stunning. Not only relative to what I was paying
4312.24s: for the stock and what the company was worth. There's a few years ago. If I held my
4315.84s: game stop this entire time investment, we were 250 million. Roughly the same amount might
4320.56s: evontion investment would have become over 25 years and they had a very good dual-police.
4325.20s: GameStop has been a run for some time now by Cohen. His tenure not been perfect. The company
4331.12s: is recently produced significant free cash flow again, very large-large part due to
4337.36s: cash and then also cutting expenses.
4349.04s: Has a ton of cash on the balance sheet, some very asymmetric convertible debt,
4352.96s: and a business model that has been revamped to be more online, more digital, more crypto,
4356.96s: more collectibles and fewer stores, which is good. As a melting ice cube and a capital structure
4361.52s: with some optionality game stop is roughly as I approached it in 18, except it's only 16%
4367.12s: shorted, which is a completely different scenario. All the numbers are 10 times bigger and Ryan is
4371.76s: running it for better for worse. Those who know me as well of those read my post, know that I
4376.56s: believe history often lends a valuable perspective to analysis. This post is along those lines.
4381.68s: It's a foundation's post. These post-cover subjects that would feel at home in a book if I were to
4386.40s: write one, they're meant to provide both foundation and a reference for future ideas.
4393.60s: What you're analysis of current opportunities, whole saga valuable lesson, hope for some of you.
4398.40s: This second and final-plus game stop many series will be an idea post, break down game stop as an
4404.32s: investment today until next time. That's a really cool article. I appreciate him very much
4410.56s: for writing that. Massive shout out to Wiggly for finding it, Lauren, for bringing it up.
4418.16s: Then also, I will thank Lauren on behalf of kicking wing, cram of the crop, mark, T, Houghton,
4426.64s: and TYD for Huck and Emma. Appreciate everybody. I want to spend a minute
4435.44s: talking about where game stop is now and how things look current state.
4442.88s: Because after this recent earnings, this drop wasn't highly surprising.
4451.12s: With where game stop is now, I find it like a lot of other names running up to a decision point.
4459.60s: Because it is in this very, very narrow window. I believe it has two two directions.
4470.48s: I still believe that this down here looks more of a floor to me than anything.
4478.24s: But we need to take out this volume profile to the upside. If we look in a little closer,
4486.56s: volume has not been super impressive, especially on some of these updates.
4494.64s: The volume itself is a little bit light. The distribution of options is still extremely
4503.84s: extremely bullish in terms of overall positioning. But I am starting to see more of this,
4511.44s: which is a ton of short call premium. The reason why you're going to see short call
4516.88s: print on part of the short call premium, I have a covered triangle right now in game stop where I
4520.88s: sell calls against the shares at a ratio. The reason why I do that is because the volatility in
4527.20s: game stop is so high, you can't really deny it. So much is Michael Burie, how he lent his shares.
4535.36s: That's kind of what I'm doing with the short calls and allowing people to buy them.
4539.44s: If we look at what this is, once it's loads, if it loads, I want to show you the rest of the,
4550.88s: I don't know why those are broken. Anyways, if you look at what the ball is, for stuff that's
4555.84s: marginally out of the money, the 32 delta calls are like 43% of all. The 32 delta puts which are
4566.24s: somewhere in here are about 40%. So you still have really strong, really strong call skew. And it
4574.48s: actually gets aggressive AF as you get further out, but then it slows a lot. And then you're actually
4582.24s: seeing put skew, which is a little less normal. So what's happening right now is the market has
4587.52s: calls skew for pretty close out of the money and then it explodes relative, but then Taylor's often
4593.52s: in terms of its slope. Whereas the put sites inverse, the closer stuff is a little bit depressed
4599.60s: in terms of vault, but then it gets parabolic out of the tails. Sometimes in game stop out of the
4605.44s: tails is actually where you'll see insanely high vault numbers relative. But this puts skew that you see
4612.16s: is actually more quote unquote normal for standard names that there's hedging done with long puts to
4622.00s: the downside. All of that at least right now leads me to believe that the market itself is split on
4631.04s: this, but it does look like most of the volume that we see, at least I would imagine is not like
4636.40s: bearish short calls as this is necessarily outlining. You have to read between the lines a little bit.
4642.80s: My expectation is that most of those are short calls against some sort of shares and taking advantage
4649.84s: of that vault. For a reminder, my coverage strangle on the year right now is up 22.7%
4665.92s: Whereas on the year, game stop is where is game stop?
4677.04s: 31, 84, it started so it's down 29%.
4685.12s: That's generally speaking the power of trading the vault in this thing.
4691.92s: Having that vault allows me to trade stuff like this even as it's having a bit of a bumpy year.
4700.08s: And it's because there's so, so, so much vault. So there's a couple ways people can trade this.
4705.20s: I prefer to trade it. I'm looking at GM by the way. Why am I doing that?
4712.48s: There we go. I was noticing that that dip seemed too deep because a lot of those dips that I see
4718.16s: in game stop were a little bit shallower, but I was thinking of these.
4722.72s: So we're in game stop proper now. And if we look at net premium, it shouldn't look all that
4728.48s: different. The front is typically long out of the money calls, but you could see those same bearish
4733.20s: bars out here, same same. The big difference though with game stop as well is it's typically played
4737.92s: more so in the front that people are rolling out. That's for gamma. And they're trying to gain
4742.80s: increasing exposure to gamma. Anyways, the few ways that something like this can be played is
4752.80s: I prefer to trade the coverage triangle in there because I think holding the underlying one.
4758.24s: I do it literally again just as nod to the community. But more so than that it allows me to trade
4766.64s: if there is a squeeze a bit more liquidly. But I do not foresee a squeeze on the horizon because
4774.16s: there's no underlying catalyst for it. Even if the options market remains active,
4780.48s: it's still missing the compression of underlying shares and availability of underlying shares.
4789.28s: If we take a peak really quick, let's find what the shorts look like.
4797.44s: So short shares, I mean, there's still a lot of them. FDDs look like they're coming down. The
4807.68s: borrowing rates are way back down to earth although still by the way very high, but relative, not
4815.76s: insane. And the overall short volume is not, it's not overly profound as far as I'm concerned.
4827.20s: And the total short volume ratio still. So I think if you're trading game stop at least at the
4838.16s: moment, you're kind of trading it from a fundamental lens more than anything. Something as in
4843.28s: you like the company, you think Ryan Cohen has a turnaround story in mind that kind of stuff.
4850.72s: And that's a big part of what I'm doing again along with the the element of vault because again,
4856.08s: I will mention again, the the vault in there is super strong. And that's a beautiful, literally, a
4864.24s: beautiful part of what the underlying provides. So I think to summarize all of that, the main thing that I
4877.92s: would pay attention to with game stop at least here in the front is if you believe
4885.36s: in Cohen and what Cohen is broadly doing, then I think you're in a pretty good spot.
4895.52s: If you don't quite think that way, then that puts you in a slightly different bucket. And going
4903.52s: and trying to play some sort of squeeze factor right now, I actually think is a like a pretty damn
4911.04s: hard sell just because it does not look like it does not look like that's so much on the
4919.28s: dock it. But those are just my opinions. Any questions or anything that you guys think we should
4929.44s: take a look at before we bounce? I am happy to poke around if you guys want otherwise. Mills hit
4938.08s: me up for Dinden what you want. I believe the vault will do well. What vault? What vault?
4953.12s: The NFT thing? Is it something else? What vault lord? What fucking vault?
4973.60s: Beta testing with cards. Is it the NFT thing though or is it something else?
4983.20s: What is this? Something else? I saw them talking about a NFT thing but
5003.04s: okay let me look it up. GameStop Vault reverse the secure storage system integrated in the
5008.00s: power pack platform launched in partnership with PSA so I know about the partnership.
5015.20s: So it's primarily for PSA graded cards that allows the vault allows users to store physical items
5025.60s: securely. Okay so I was just paying attention to the digital ownership component.
5033.36s: Yeah I understand. Wiggly says they basically sell physical loot boxes now with PSA graded
5039.84s: member Belia. Yeah I think the cool part about the vault though is that you get still like the
5050.08s: tangible idea of having the thing because you get a digital ownership element because I think one of
5058.48s: the big things that wouldn't work well with the vault idea is if somebody just goes and puts a card
5064.24s: in there because the people that collect those cards like to be able to look at them or show them to
5068.80s: somebody having the card in a vault and then having an NFT version of it that you could show.
5075.44s: I'm like oh yeah this is the thing I can look at it that is pretty cool. So yeah that I get so
5082.80s: it's becoming a little bit more of a hybrid retailer in an asset custodian. The thing is
5088.08s: is I'm just just don't know how big the market is for that. So power packs is a game of
5096.48s: five online experience. They purchase digital packs starting at 20 to 50 random PSA graded cards.
5102.96s: You ripped the pack digitally to reveal the card mimicking the excitement of opening physical
5107.44s: boosters. The revealed cards are stored in PSA's modern climate controlled vault facility in Delaware
5115.52s: with 24-7 security asset management 100% insurance. Keep items in the vault indefinitely.
5123.60s: Request shipping. Seller trade digitally. You and manage the collection online.
5131.28s: Yeah so it looks like it's only five bucks. Oh hold on it says game stop pro members get discounts
5138.00s: five dollars off shipping monthly. I see okay.
5140.72s: So they're right now focusing on trading cards Pokemon magic the gathering but community
5147.84s: speculations suggest future additions like comics, Funko pops. Yeah I think comics that's literally
5154.00s: the first thing I was thinking comics can be that's a big market. So I think if they can get into
5159.52s: comics that would be huge because then you can also have the physical or the digital comic book which
5165.36s: is not that hard to get. Yeah that looks awesome. I completely agree with you.
5172.48s: I think that that's a really really really neat idea. I wonder what the total market potential is that for
5180.72s: that. What is the total market potential for this kind of idea?
5188.40s: No one says a couple larger creators have been making noise about mispriceings of the cards
5198.56s: via the card ladder index. I don't know the fuck that is. And how it derives price. Well I imagine
5207.44s: well I don't know if that's just like an unrealized value for it but I imagine the
5212.24s: standard supply and demand market value would rule. Wouldn't it? I would be mine guess.
5218.40s: You see multiple people sit in bloc tens of thousands in the span of a few minutes. Yeah yeah.
5227.84s: Wiggly says you're getting in a nitty gritty about pricing. What do you mean about pricing?
5238.16s: Oh you mean like the the card ladder pricing? I see.
5241.84s: Wiggly says do you know what back it is for sports cards and collectibles? I've noted I never
5249.36s: was into any of that stuff. I remember in like junior higher high school I played you heal.
5256.16s: I remember doing that with my friends a little bit but that was it. I never got into like any sort of
5260.56s: collectibles. Okay so to assess the potential total market
5271.44s: impact or addressable market. They focus on the relevant sectors. Okay so approximately 15 to 16
5279.52s: billion which is the global trading market overview. Sports trading cards account for a significant
5288.48s: portion about 33 to 34 billion. So massive of which trading cards alone are 15 billion.
5301.20s: Grated trading cards represent a high value niche within this while direct
5306.96s: Tam isn't isolated. Authentication grading services are valued at 2.2 billion globally.
5315.28s: Yeah that's my guess reflecting the ecosystem scale volume wise over 10 million sports card
5320.72s: are graded annually. That's the thing is like I'm just not convinced that there's some sort of
5328.00s: massive market opportunity there. This to me looks like a standard case of game stop is doing
5333.92s: what they should be doing, which is leaning into their strengths, consuming peripheral markets
5340.40s: and growing those which I fully agree with. But I'm just not sure there's like some sort of
5345.76s: massive opportunity unlock in that kind of markets. It's actually a pretty small market at 2.2
5352.88s: billion in globally because then you know you're not going to penetrate all of that.
5361.28s: So yeah I'm super interested. So it's expected to reach 21 or 23 billion by 2030 or 24
5367.68s: at a compound annual growth rate of 6.8% that just sounds completely random to me.
5374.16s: I think it's going to increasingly move digital personally. I know that there will always be
5379.20s: physical trading cards and a cohort of people that like to do that. But I view it going the way of
5383.68s: like manual transmission cars. I enjoy manual transmission because I just think it's more fun to drive.
5390.24s: But there is very there's fewer and fewer of them even though there are a number of enthusiasts
5397.52s: like me. That's one of the reasons when I was buying them a clarinet. I was kind of bummed by it
5401.84s: because I wanted to mid-engine because I've never had one before. But those are only paddles.
5407.04s: Like they're still manual thankfully, but they're paddle, which is not really quite as fun.
5413.12s: And that's why the C7, the Corvette that I have, I was so stoked on the accident, it's manual
5418.00s: 7 speed and it's just a different experience driving a manual if you're enthusiastic.
5426.96s: Wiggly says would you rather own an NFT of a McLaren? No. No, I've opened prefer not the NFT.
5434.56s: I actually prefer I prefer the physical car. But I'm a car enthusiast. That's what I tell people.
5442.16s: It's like I think people that buy cars for status symbols literally are fucking stupid and cars
5447.84s: are terrible investments. So unless you really enjoy cars, it literally is such an awful place to put
5454.32s: money. But I am the kind of person that genuinely drives a lot of marginally utility from it.
5460.48s: It stems from when I was a kid. My brother and I, we literally had to learn how to fix cars
5465.92s: so that my mom could drive to work because she couldn't afford going to a mechanic. So we kind of,
5471.76s: we both took that as something good to know, but we turned it into a hobby more than something that
5479.44s: were forced to learn and then begrudgingly do. And I mean, I literally have a lift in my house
5486.24s: for my cars. I have a couple of photos that I put up a while ago where I took the entire McLaren
5492.32s: apart. I had it in pieces in the garage just so I could look at it and see how it works. So yeah,
5499.28s: there for somebody like me, they're not status symbols in the least, even McLaren's niche. Nobody
5504.56s: even knows what they are. They're born out of like a race car culture. That's why the McLaren
5510.24s: is orange. It's from the days of black and white tape so that the orange would stick out as a
5516.08s: different hue of black. It's like shit like that. I like a lot. But in its why I never bothered with
5522.48s: like a Lamborghini, although I really like Lamborghini. So I think they're cool. I think the
5526.08s: beginning of them from a fucking tractor company is awesome. But those honestly have a little too
5531.76s: many people that are in that that are just doing it for status, which I just think is super lame. And
5537.92s: I don't want to remotely be associated with that. Okay. So looking at this though, the total size
5544.08s: does not seem huge. That's the, that's the rug. I see graded authentication subset is like two to three
5551.76s: billion. Five to seven billion of non sports collectibles, eight to ten of sports collectibles.
5565.04s: So yeah, it just doesn't seem huge.
5572.24s: No one says paper tiger trading in goblin where the main two I heard making noise about it. I have no idea
5583.60s: of the fuck that is. Joseph, do you think the recent decrease in volatility is made the CSS less interesting?
5590.56s: At what point would you look to pivot elsewhere? Well, a couple of things on that. The first thing is
5596.00s: as a, again, as a general reminder, I maintain the game stop position again, broadly as like a nod to
5603.04s: the community. I still view myself as a guest in the game stop community. And I like being a part of it.
5609.92s: I like learning about it, but I haven't been around quite that long. So it's just a way for me to be
5616.48s: in a bit of solidarity, right? Show some love. That aside, I think people confuse volatility massively.
5625.76s: And it's because of this, the volatility has come down in game stop. It's still at 50%
5632.64s: vol. And that represents one percent implied volatility percent tile. That means literally
5639.60s: one percent of occurrences are lower than where vol currently is. So then you can say to yourself,
5645.20s: do I think that means vol might expand? I fall generally more so into that camp. And the other thing is
5651.36s: at 50% gross ball, you can still absolutely, you can still absolutely make a ton of money.
5660.08s: Let's take a look at a comparison. Let's just take a look at selling a put at, we'll do like a put
5666.32s: per delta just so that we can get something that's a little more normalized.
5673.36s: Here. If we take a look at this short put,
5678.00s: I was just weird what this being half on two screens. The 38 delta put 0.38 is giving 0.7 in terms of premium.
5691.92s: This should be like a dollar. Fuck me, 0.7. And then the 23 delta is giving us 0.36.
5708.08s: These are for the puts.
5716.80s: If we put this at a ratio per delta,
5721.44s: I'm just going to take the premium divided by the delta.
5725.28s: And I'm going to get what the ratio is of premium for delta.
5733.20s: Let's take a look at some other names really quick. We'll take a look at Apple.
5742.72s: We'll be in the same expiration. They have a 37. We'll track that one. So the 0.37.
5754.24s: And that 0.37. I needed to get the strike price as well to normalize it. That's kind of a
5762.96s: fuck that up. Sorry guys. That's okay. So the 0.37 you're going to get like 320.
5778.00s: Okay. And the strike price for that is 270.
5784.24s: Go back to games up really quick. I'll just do the top one.
5792.32s: Strike price there is 22.
5799.36s: Okay.
5813.68s: So here's the little metric that I just built for you. Effectively, what I did was this one is
5826.80s: game stop this one's Apple. If you're on the wrong part of the keyboard, you get whatever that
5834.24s: these are the strikes. This is your delta. This is your premium. This first ratio is just taking your
5841.68s: premium divided by your delta. So how much premium are you getting per delta?
5846.80s: Then this one is taking that ratio and it's putting it as a percentage to the strike price just so
5853.68s: that you can normalize across price. Otherwise the raw number of Apple is always going to be more.
5859.52s: So you can see that what you're getting per delta per cost is insanely higher in something like
5865.92s: game stop 8.4% versus 3.2. So the summary of that story is just because game stops
5874.24s: ball is lower relative to itself doesn't mean it's low ball. It is super high ball still.
5880.32s: And the other fun fact is very frequently there's a relationship between implied ball
5889.76s: and realize ball specifically during periods like this that can make it super lucrative.
