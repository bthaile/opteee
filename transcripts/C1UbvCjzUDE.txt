514.00s:  you
516.00s:  you
518.00s:  you
519.00s:  terms of net premiums for calls and puts. And then where we're seeing institutional positioning,
525.80s:  what things like the COT report look like, which we're going to go through all of that.
531.76s:  Now let's talk quickly about where things landed last week. Also take a look at this,
538.92s:  we talked about this a little bit. The I was looking at maybe fading laser and I started
545.12s:  stepping into something and funny enough I ended up getting out of the trade pretty fast,
550.24s:  but this move here still seems just bullshit to me. But anyways, let's get into the overall
561.20s:  markets here. So if we take a look, we can see a lot of the activity that happened Friday.
566.64s:  One of the things that jumps out to me is XLB actually had a pretty big dip down compared to
572.32s:  everything else just about everything else showed a bit of strength and I'll show you.
577.12s:  So if we take a look at XLB, you'll see that materials actually started contracting. And I think
585.04s:  that this is a reasonable short at this point for the near term expectation of things like tariffs
591.36s:  and the near term potential impacts of them. Now another broader note is when I looked at overall
600.08s:  net highs lows, one of the things that is jumping out at me here is the NASDAQ is still lagging pretty
610.00s:  heavily over the New York Stock Exchange. And if you take a look at the constituents there, New York
615.12s:  Stock Exchange actually favors a lot of these kinds of companies. So I think that there's likely
620.56s:  going to be some bleed through from this, but this looks like it'll be under near term pressure.
626.96s:  One of the big things to keep in mind about Trump's tariff policy, I think that there is currently
634.16s:  a pretty big misunderstanding, at least as far as I can tell with respect to how the tariffs might
639.76s:  go on. And it looks like people seem to think or are pricing things as if this is going to be
646.88s:  tariff city on every country. And if we actually peel back some of the things that Trump has
654.96s:  specifically spoken about with respect to the tariff policy, it actually looks like they're
659.68s:  trying to be more scalpel than that. And it looks like they're trying to structure it as if there
664.64s:  is an unfair trade relationship between the US and whatever other country they're looking at,
670.80s:  that's then when the tariffs would come into play and then it would be at a variable rate based
675.76s:  on the trade relationship. That matters because when we look across the total market impact,
682.08s:  that scenario is vastly different than the scenario of it's going to be hand in tariffs out like
689.28s:  it's Halloween and everybody's just going to get more tariffs. That differentiation is actually
694.00s:  really important in the expectation of the market reaction to things. The other thing that stuck
700.08s:  out to me specifically from last week, I think the relationship between tech and comm services
708.56s:  looks like it's just about come back online. So if you take a look at the move on a relative
715.20s:  basis between XLC and XOK, they look super similar. So what this means is that pairs trade is in my
722.48s:  book, I already told you I've wrapped up the pairs trade between XLC and XOK, but it does look like
728.16s:  it might be done at least for now until that relationship becomes decoupled again in the future.
734.24s:  The other thing that I noticed is staples and discretionary. Take a look at discretionary leveling
739.68s:  off and I still have to expect broader weakness potential from discretionary as compared to staples.
747.68s:  This largely is just due to what they are, right? Think of it. Staples are things that people
753.20s:  need to survive to conduct their day-to-day living. Not totally. If we looked inside staples,
759.52s:  you actually find some stuff in there and you're like, that's a staple, but that aside, in general,
766.56s:  a lot of the names that you'll see in staples lean more that direction and then discretionary.
770.40s:  Obviously, there are things that people prefer. They like it adds value to their day-to-day life.
774.72s:  And funny enough, you'll find some things in discretionary that actually can hold up really well
779.36s:  that perform almost more like a staple. It's kind of a fun game with markets. If you take a look at
785.28s:  defense contractors, ITA, massive, massive movement, and there's actually a new pairs relationship
792.88s:  that has caught my eye here. So if we break this down, let's do a quad.
802.88s:  And let's take a look at LMT. Let's take a look at RTX. Let's take a look at Boeing. And Boeing is
811.12s:  likely going to see a bit of an uptick. I would surmise. That's actually another simple trade I
817.76s:  have for tomorrow. He's looking to just trade Boeing to see how it opens, but then just trade Boeing
825.36s:  to the upside short term, probably just intraday, but with the announcement of the new fighter.
832.40s:  And I forgot, I already forgot the name of it. Is it like the Boeing 49 or something?
836.80s:  New fighter jet.
841.44s:  F-47. That's close enough, right? F-47, F-49, whatever.
847.60s:  But this, I think, is probably going to cause a little bit of near-term price appreciation.
857.20s:  One thing to note about this is this announcement actually is not really new.
863.36s:  This is something that we expected. And you could actually see some of these artifacts.
870.16s:  However, typically what happens is when this kind of news comes from the level of Trump,
876.32s:  it has way more eyes on it.
880.72s:  Sorry, enough. Thor is walking around the office crying. So now he has to wait before I can let him out.
887.12s:  But because there are way more news articles on this now, you'll actually see that information
895.28s:  being ingested and incorporated into price a little more quickly. This goes back to this broader
900.96s:  momentum concept of information discreetness, whether it's discreet or industry. And this kind of
907.68s:  information coming out at this level is likely to cause at least a near-term reaction to things.
914.24s:  And then the other one, what do we want to add in here? I guess we could do general dynamics.
922.96s:  And let's see. So notice Boeing compared to Lockheed Martin compared to Raytheon.
931.52s:  This movement itself, again, is already something that we can eyeball for a potential opportunity.
938.16s:  Because right now the relationship between Lockheed Martin and Boeing is probably a little more
943.84s:  extended than Raytheon. But the main cause here is that some of the underlying drivers are a
951.60s:  little bit different. So the pairs of the pair structure in general looks better between Raytheon
960.72s:  and Boeing because you can see their general price performance largely mirrors one another
965.68s:  much better than Lockheed Martin. But these short-term distortions sometimes can be faster ideas.
972.56s:  So we'll have to see how this ends up playing out. But it is something that I'm keeping an eye on
978.72s:  because these just become simple little trades. They don't necessarily make a ton of money,
984.08s:  but they can be interesting to watch. So if we take a look at Lockheed Martin and then if we take
990.16s:  a look at Boeing and we just analyze the pairs relationship again, you can see that the
995.44s:  total relationship over time has absolutely been contracting. However, the main reversion,
1002.00s:  this is using a Hearst exponent, is not super high. So it's not something that I've traded that
1007.36s:  much in the past, but it's something I'm watching because I am curious if this gets as extended as it
1013.68s:  is, if it now opens up an opportunity, which we'll have to see. So that stuff aside, let's now talk more
1024.48s:  about some of what we saw last week. And I'm going to let this do it out.
1044.24s:  The dude needed, he needed to go run around.
1053.84s:  So one of the broader themes that I was picking up on towards the end of last week is you can see,
1060.24s:  take a look at the call premium relative to put premium and the overall trends here. This is
1066.80s:  over the last seven days. You can see that call premiums really started falling off. And then you
1073.44s:  can see that on between the 19th and 20th, we saw them peak up. And then we've seen them essentially
1078.80s:  steadily decline from there. So I really am eager to see what kind of options activity we see on
1087.76s:  Monday in the broad market because I do think that the options markets have been pretty decent
1095.28s:  in terms of their expectations so far. Now one note that is worth highlighting here is the
1101.76s:  put side, his ran off massively. So even if we're not seeing massive speculation via long calls,
1109.84s:  coming online, we are seeing long puts or just puts in general, starting to slow down. So that
1116.40s:  I do think is at least again, worth general general noting. So let's now take a look at some of
1127.52s:  what we have coming up this week again for those that are receiving the newsletter. You will
1134.32s:  have seen this in the newsletter already, but we'll poke through it really fast together. I have
1140.56s:  this zoomed out just literally because when I put it in the newsletter so I can grab a screenshot,
1144.80s:  that's a little cleaner. But here I like to do this did not mean that.
1151.28s:  All right, so let's see what we have now for the newsletter more often than not. I focus on
1160.48s:  like the three star items quote unquote, they're just like the much higher impact or expectation.
1166.16s:  But I when we're doing it on this stream for this kind of preparation, I think going down one
1172.00s:  click, the problem is is for those that don't know the ranking systems are pretty good because
1176.64s:  they have a lot of noise in here. Now again, honestly, I tend to look at the majority of this,
1183.04s:  especially because trading things like futures, understanding what's coming up and what the
1188.40s:  expectations are in terms of the crops. Like that's actually really usable information, but that's
1193.44s:  not really for the purview here. So we can see Chicago PMI is coming out tomorrow. Chicago PMI is
1200.64s:  nothing that special, but I do think seeing how the Dallas Fed, how their data lines up with
1210.96s:  the Atlanta Fed. I'm very curious how well the general stories between those two align
1220.16s:  because a really big conversation point right now sits on what happens with rates.
1228.88s:  So let me grab the Fed rate.
1232.48s:  Where's the Fed watch?
1248.48s:  Take a look at this. So if we take a look at, I want to look at the historical.
1257.28s:  And seven may is fine. Yeah, see, take a look at this. Right now, this is starting to skyrocket
1266.96s:  relative, which is a little surprising, actually. So let's see what's happened here.
1276.40s:  And this is looking back over a few different time frames. You can see that the probability of no change
1283.52s:  originally started at 67 and it's been slowly creeping up to 86 right now the markets currently
1290.96s:  pricing in two cuts. And the I think that I don't know, man, I can see it and the the pressure from
1301.92s:  Trump is also an interesting inject there, but we're also coming into a really interesting growth
1308.96s:  phase with respect to GDP because with all of these attempts to find areas to cut federal spending,
1316.48s:  for example, which is a massive, massive element of GDP that actually slows overall growth.
1323.60s:  Now of no, there is the question of, well, does the federal spending like, should it even be in GDP,
1331.20s:  which I actually think there's an argument there depending on what the spending is. So
1336.40s:  some of me, I don't necessarily care that much of GDP contracts a little bit because government
1341.28s:  spending is being cut down and that's being reflected there. But the other thing I noticed that
1347.84s:  is a little interesting and this is actually a call out for job openings is as these different
1356.00s:  federal fields are being hacked and slashed. I am surprised to see unemployment and unemployment
1366.48s:  expectations coming in as light as they've been. I do think that there's a reality where
1374.64s:  unemployment might actually start to speak up a little bit and then how that feeds into a
1381.76s:  potential cut and whether it's one or two is a different scenario, I think. But all of these
1390.00s:  data points, at least from a trader's lens are things to be aware of. But the really cool part
1395.76s:  about being a trader is other than the fact of being generally interested in this stuff, which I
1399.76s:  am and hopefully you are right because it's super cool. Like the markets are fascinating. The cool
1404.56s:  part about being a trader is as long as you have the general context on these things that are going
1409.28s:  on and what may or may not happen, you actually don't have to come up with a really strong,
1413.60s:  definitive idea because you can play the idea as it's unraveling. That is one of the very few
1421.28s:  advantages of being a retail trader. I actually have a couple videos coming out. One of them is,
1426.08s:  I don't know when it's going to land. It's already made. It's going through my editor now.
1430.48s:  But it talks about some of the advantages of retail traders because retail traders are
1435.60s:  beat over the head with the fact that they have zero advantages and it literally is not true.
1439.44s:  It's like 100% not true. That in no way means that retail traders are advantage. That's not the case.
1447.76s:  But there are certain advantages you have and that's one of them is that you do not have to
1452.00s:  front run the moves. We are small and agile enough that we can get in as a move is happening,
1459.60s:  which unloads an insane amount of the burden of coming up with these grand your ideas because
1468.72s:  big institutions, they have to not only come up with the idea, but then they have to position
1473.60s:  themselves slowly so that they can get the position they want at a price that's reasonable
1477.68s:  to then play the idea. A little bit of a cool function of being a retail trader.
1483.76s:  I wouldn't surprise me to see job openings coming up. Now, everything I've seen so far from
1489.36s:  CPI, PPI, PMI, it does look like manufacturing is starting to see some pretty big changes and I
1497.28s:  think a lot of this has to do with the expectations around tariffs, tariff impact and how pervasive
1504.72s:  that's going to be, especially in things like manufacturing. That absolutely will be a pretty
1511.92s:  big line item. We'll take a look at the options market in a second to see how the S&P 500 is
1518.56s:  just expecting from this stuff and you'll see it's actually kind of light.
1525.60s:  Then we have services PMI on Thursday, payrolls, unemployment on Friday. The average hourly earnings,
1536.88s:  I actually care about the month over month here because one of the things that I've showed you all
1541.76s:  before is one second, let me log into my Fred account and I'll show you the economic dashboard
1549.44s:  that I'd like to use this one. One of the things that I'd like to keep an eyeball on is the
1556.96s:  delinquency rates of different kinds of credit lines. Then I also like to see the health of the
1564.80s:  consumer, which you'll see here. You can see things like personal savings and personal
1571.04s:  consumption. The relationship here is actually pretty strong. It's hard to tell because these are
1579.12s:  kind of squished down. You'll notice that if you take a look at personal consumption,
1583.68s:  that's what this brighter, thicker blue line is. You'll see that this is down ticking. Then if
1590.48s:  you take a look at savings rate, it's actually upticking. This to me shows that the consumer is
1598.48s:  actually pretty accurately playing this so far. It means that they're being conservative,
1605.52s:  starting to slow spending early. Now, if we take a look at delinquency rates,
1611.52s:  delinquency rates for mortgages look completely fine. This doesn't look as healthy, but again,
1619.12s:  this is a little bit lagging. The business loans thing. I'm not seeing any huge activity
1626.08s:  from the delinquency rate side of things that at least for me start to draw some sort of
1633.36s:  concern. I don't really feel that way so far. If we double click into this, you can see
1640.88s:  it looks pretty centrist parabys. I don't see a ton of changes coming through here that again,
1649.04s:  draw my attention. I think the consumer right now looks healthy enough, but I think that they
1660.88s:  probably are in a tenuous position. I think that that's pretty fair to say.
1670.40s:  Now, anything else in here that's worth looking at? I don't really think so.
1676.96s:  No, no, no. I think the debt picture. There's also the balance sheet, so the Fed is definitely being
1687.52s:  a little cagey with the balance sheet runoff. There is an argument to be made depending on how
1694.80s:  pervasive these tariffs go, what impact that's going to have on the dollar. But again, I think from
1700.48s:  the broader perspective, the impact of the dollar becomes a little macro level, which,
1708.08s:  again, I think it's good to be aware of, but I think from a standard trader's activity,
1714.56s:  it won't really matter that much. So I'm not going to spend a ton of time on that.
1720.00s:  Let's take a look through just the pre-market here from bar chart. See if they have anything that
1725.44s:  we haven't come across yet. Then we'll talk quick about the portfolio and then start running through
1729.60s:  some scans. Thursday's final reading GDP, 830, comprehensive, backward look of economic growth.
1738.32s:  We already know that this is being revised down. So yeah, that doesn't matter much,
1745.36s:  manufacturing services. We know that that's coming up. Housing market. So the housing market's been
1751.84s:  really interesting. And we're not seeing any massive changes in the mortgage front yet, although
1757.20s:  the 10 year is starting to oscillate a little bit. So nothing jumped out of me in there.
1764.00s:  Let's take a look at the S&P 500 really fast. And let's see where the S&P 500 is seeing anything
1773.76s:  busy here, definitely. So you can see this jumps up about three quarters of a point, the 28th of March.
1782.08s:  So if we overlay that with the schedule for the week,
1797.76s:  this week, I was wondering, I had it as I fucked that up, my bad guys. I was wondering because I
1804.56s:  had this as next week, but they consider it this week. So I was like, this stuff doesn't
1807.76s:  fucking line up. That's what I was. Yeah. Anyways. So it's the S&P composite manufacturing services. Yeah,
1816.16s:  that's better. A bunch of Fed speakers. The 28th, the 27th, there's the GDP reading. Here you go.
1825.44s:  So the 28th or PCE. So that's probably what the market is pricing in here.
1833.28s:  So that economic calendar we looked at earlier from here, I was looking not at this coming week,
1837.84s:  but the next week. That's why it didn't match up. And that's really the big day as far as we can tell.
1845.28s:  Now, various risk premiums in the S&P 500 have been some of the best I've ever traded.
1850.88s:  And I've been running a bunch of different duration strategies. A couple have been working
1856.56s:  much better than the others. One of the themes that has absolutely been the case is funny enough,
1862.40s:  the zeros have been a lot more stable than the overnight weekend or other variable entry times.
1873.28s:  The one day risk premiums have been really, really solid, but they're highly specific.
1880.80s:  If you, one of the things a lot of retail traders do with like the SPX trading strategies,
1885.60s:  if you guys have seen some of my videos on like zero DTEs, I have a video coming out soon that's
1889.44s:  comparing zero to one DTEs. A lot of people try to come up with what we would call a dumb strategy,
1896.48s:  not that the strategy itself is dumb, but that it's just a defined ahead of time. And then you just
1901.68s:  continue to execute that strategy itself. And that doesn't work well because the conditions,
1908.08s:  it's a very conditional style trade that has to be modified, but you have to be so careful with
1913.20s:  the modifications that you're making that they actually add value because otherwise you can start
1921.68s:  overlaying filters that don't actually matter. But a big thing that I pay attention to is actually
1927.44s:  the options activity on the day. Okay, so we can see that the vol though for this front cycle is
1937.28s:  actually pretty light, right? It's only 18. Vol in general is pretty light. So that's what I'm
1945.04s:  seeing from a broad market perspective. Let's take a quick look at and I have from the pro questing
1952.48s:  question sheet. I have one question flagged that we will absolutely get to. I'll hit this one
1961.12s:  in a little bit, but let's take a look at the covered strangles as they sit.
1965.84s:  So right now we are about 71% utilized in TQs. We are 52% utilized in SSO. So actually a little
1979.36s:  bit lighter there than I would care to be. I bits at 60 game stops at 74.
1985.04s:  The key notes here is you'll see that the equity side of things is still a little bit on the
1991.84s:  light side. I actually would start looking to start scaling these up closer to like 30%. So I'm
1997.20s:  going to be adding little bits here and there. And then the cash secured put elements. I probably
2005.04s:  will keep these about the same other than the fact that SSO is too light. So and this is because
2011.36s:  some of the trades came down last week and it's also saving some of the capital so that I can
2018.40s:  apply it to some of the roles that are going to happen. One of the things that I pay very close
2023.44s:  attention to with the management of the covered strangles is if I am too utilized especially when
2032.96s:  I have cash secured puts that are underwater and are going to need management. I actually slow
2039.28s:  roll scaling into the equity side of things so that I can ramp up a little bit of my capital use
2045.12s:  to help me with the roles. And I'll give you an example because T triple Qs is in a pretty rough spot
2052.40s:  as is SSO. Well, let's take a look at TQs. So if we take a look at T triple Qs right now, I'm short
2060.32s:  for example the 75s. That's a great example. Those 75s are Ella underwater. So if I show you were
2068.96s:  75 is on this chart, it's looking like it's right about here. So as you can tell, this is an
2079.20s:  un favorable level for short puts, right? Because it means that if I'm assigned, I effectively have
2086.32s:  to take those puts all the way up here when the market's down here. Don't want that especially
2090.00s:  because my current basis is 66. So if I had to buy I have 500 shares at 66. So if I bought another
2096.08s:  500 shares at 75, that would murder actually a pretty good basis right now. A basis of 66 is
2102.32s:  absolutely fantastic because I've been trading this and while I have been trading this,
2109.92s:  we started this on the 20, not the 20th of February, we'll call it 15 October.
2119.92s:  So this was over 75 bucks when I first started actually trading and scaling into things.
2128.40s:  So if we go 75 and we take a look at where we sit now, 62, 18, that's a 17% drop. So the fact that
2137.36s:  the basis that I have right now is actually so close is pretty solid. I'm happy with that.
2144.64s:  Now all that aside, let's take a look at these puts and finish out that example that I was just
2148.96s:  explaining to you. So we have the 17 April, we have the 75s which still have a little bit of
2156.56s:  extrinsic value not much. The midpoint on these, it's probably a little closer. Yeah, I was guessing
2162.64s:  closer to the 13 Hano versus the mid to high 13s. This is guessing mid 13s. I would expect it to be
2168.40s:  kind of around the 13s. So let's just eyeball this as we're going to close these for 13, 25,
2178.48s:  something like that. So if we mentally bucket closing those at 13, 25 and we go out maybe to 2
2185.44s:  May, the first thing is to see where can we get 13, 25, we can get it at 75s. So we can essentially
2193.60s:  roll out flat, which is fine, but that's not the target here. We want to be able to reduce this
2200.72s:  basis. So one of the ways that we can reduce this basis is instead of just rolling it same size,
2207.28s:  I can add contracts and I'll show you what that actually looks like. Do I have the, I do have it in
2215.28s:  here. Great. So this copied over, which is good. And let me show what the fuck happened to this.
2226.80s:  We're missing. One sex. Sorry. Oh, because it overwrote it. That's a little annoying.
2242.32s:  Damn, Daniel. Let me, let me undo all this. How far back will it
2253.28s:  be? Doesn't seem like.
2263.04s:  Damn. Anyways, we can just do some back of the napkin map. It just means that this stuff is
2269.12s:  broken here, but we'll just, we'll sort it out real quick. Don't you worry.
2275.36s:  So we'll drop this in. I don't know what ticker this is for, but it'll be.
2283.12s:  Okay. Five. Oh, this is perfect. This is literally for this exact trade. Fortune, fortune favors us.
2290.96s:  So I want to show you something. So these again, we eyeballed that we would take it down for like 1325.
2298.96s:  So now if we take a look, this stock is at 6218. The stock has had a pretty significant move
2309.44s:  against us up until this point. And this should be AJ.
2318.08s:  AJ 18. You guys. This here. The AJ 18. So you can see the total move. So the total move here
2332.80s:  is 37% against which obviously from the entry on these short puts, that really is a pretty profound move.
2344.88s:  That's not easy to just navigate around. So because of that, we have to pay pretty close attention
2356.08s:  to how we ultimately manage our movement, which I will show you how we can use dynamic lot sizing
2365.28s:  for that. So let's say we run it up to a six lot. And let's see if we can get to the 71s maybe.
2376.08s:  Because that's really the only next strike. That's another frustrating thing in this goes back
2380.32s:  to expiration liquidity. Notice how there's no 74 73 72. It's only 75 71.
2388.32s:  That makes the game of rolling more difficult. Reason why it makes the game of rolling more
2394.40s:  difficult is because I have less choices available to me, which I mean realistically in this case,
2400.96s:  I shouldn't, but you know, should shouldn't doesn't matter. I do. And it literally goes from 75
2406.80s:  to 71 because I would have a much better role potential here if I was trying to go from 75 to 74
2412.80s:  or 75 to 73, but I'm not. I have to go the next choice I have is going down to 71.
2418.72s:  So let's say I go down to 71 and let's say at 71, let's see what we might be able to take in 1045.
2425.20s:  Let's see if this works for us. So this does indeed work. And I'll show you.
2434.96s:  So here's effectively what would happen in this case. Now by adding a single lot, right?
2444.64s:  So I don't have to add a whole bunch, but by adding a single lot, what I'm doing here is taking my
2453.92s:  basis down 5%. I am rolling for a debit, which is really important to note. This is a debit,
2463.60s:  which the last trade was also a debit. The reason why I'm emphasizing this is because so many
2469.60s:  people are used to always hearing you have to roll for a credit, which you don't. You have to track
2476.88s:  the P and L. That's what you do have to do. And that's exactly what is relevant here.
2485.76s:  So if we take a look, what is this 23 March, I just have to throw a date in here so that this
2490.80s:  math is done from you as well. So by moving my basis here, this shouldn't be read. So for those that
2500.80s:  don't know, I dropped this over from another log that I use. That's why all the formatting and numbers
2504.88s:  are dorked up. But the main premise stuff here is ultimately what matters to us. So so far,
2514.48s:  we're going to be increasing the total capital requirement by 5100 bucks. That is really important,
2522.64s:  because if you take a look at the cash secured requirement for a five-law at 75, it's 3,500.
2530.88s:  So I'm adding an entire additional contract. We would expect that that one additional contract
2537.44s:  would cost us an additional $7,100. But it doesn't. The reason why it doesn't is because for the five
2544.88s:  existing contracts, we're taking the basis from 75 to 71 that represents savings. So that means
2553.92s:  instead of adding $7,100 of cost, we're only adding $5,100 of cost. This is such an important
2561.52s:  thing to track because it is one of the absolute most important ways to managing these positions.
2569.44s:  Because in doing so, we can use not all of our capital to slowly grind this basis down. And
2577.68s:  literally by adding a single contract, I'm able to move the basis down 5% from 75 to 71. It's still
2585.68s:  deep in the money, which is suboptimal. But it's much better off than we're at, and I'm not adding
2592.64s:  a ton of money to do it. That's the main point here. So this goes all the way back to the original
2597.76s:  thing I was explaining to you. How I often will hold off on adding additional shares even though
2604.64s:  I typically would want to because I'm accounting for this scenario that I have to do.
2615.84s:  So that is that's what we need to see in Teachable Cuse.
2624.48s:  Essentially, this role will be done. It'll increase the utilization ever so slightly. We might
2629.44s:  even do another lot on top of this just because I probably want to use a little bit more here.
2634.08s:  But Teachable Cuse is a little on the higher end already. So I don't want to go crazy.
2639.28s:  And really what I'm waiting for then is if this option, if this 71 strike trades for a dollar 48,
2646.88s:  that's when I get out at a scratch. And then anything over past that that remaining dollar 48 would
2652.64s:  then start leading to a profit, the total profit potential given everything so far is $885. So
2661.20s:  again, it's not the $885 on $4,600. That's nothing I would be supremely proud about. But if you
2671.84s:  actually take a look at the return potential here for how much is being tied up and for the annualized
2678.16s:  return of this trade, it's actually pretty decent. It's still a 19% return. Now again, one of the
2685.68s:  key notes here is with favoring the basis adjustment, I'm really deprioritizing the total P&L
2693.68s:  of the short puts. And my goal is to get this basis down, down, down, down as much as I can. The
2698.80s:  further down I get at the more opportunities I have for adjustment. So that is an update and
2705.76s:  really that same methodology is exactly what I'm going to use in SSO. Okay, a couple other things
2712.40s:  really fast. And then I will open it up to Q&A. I'll hit that other question that we have. I want
2719.12s:  to take a look at a couple broad market scans. And the main reason for the scans is I want to see
2729.84s:  a few trends. So let's take a look first. I want to see the gap up versus gap down. So this I've
2742.72s:  been tracking for a while now. This is almost like tracking market breadth. Very often when the
2747.76s:  market is strong, you'll see actually a pretty comprehensive list of gap ups. Now to be clear,
2752.32s:  this isn't like every stock that's gaped up 5%. There's overlays in terms of things that have
2756.32s:  options with at least 500 open interest and stuff like that. But it's on a relative basis.
2761.12s:  Right. I'm not comparing this against the total universe. I'm comparing this against itself in my
2766.08s:  observations of historically. So 5% gap up. There's only three names that immediately tells me
2772.48s:  markets generally weak. If we take a look at gap down, we can see that there's 15 names.
2778.80s:  So about three times. And some of these names have actually been in pretty serious price extensions.
2784.72s:  So this to me becomes eyeball for shorter term mean reversion. Now an admin note here.
2793.68s:  A lot of my trading, especially because this is a free version. So some of the folks on the
2799.04s:  stream right now won't have this total context of what I've been doing. But a big thing that's been
2803.60s:  happening, especially with my directional trades is the timelines have come in significantly,
2808.96s:  meaning my average holding durations are very, very short. Maybe two weeks if that. So a lot of
2815.20s:  these things, I'm actually purposely playing even one, two day ideas. So if we take a look at
2820.72s:  something like QUBT. QUBT had a pretty significant initial rally here. And you can see that that,
2830.48s:  I mean, that's this is what a 2.8 standard deviation move. If you take a look at these up,
2836.40s:  upside standard deviation moves, it is absolutely absurd. How many outsized moves this thing has had,
2847.76s:  it is beyond a statistical phenomenon. It has 3.2% instances where moves exceed a 3 standard
2855.44s:  deviation that effectively should not happen right from a statistical lens from a normally distributed
2860.24s:  curve. Two standard deviations being 25% of instances is very high. So this means that this stock
2870.08s:  frequently has pretty big moves against volatility expectations. Now this most recent down move
2878.00s:  to me starts to look interesting to play either a continuation or if this was a larger move,
2887.20s:  price, mean, reversion, but right now the move that we saw on Friday was actually very inside.
2893.20s:  The total move there was 0.45. So 0.46 standard deviation. So well within one standard deviation,
2900.80s:  nothing to be done here. But that's what I'm looking for. And as I flip through some of these,
2905.44s:  so that you know what my eyes are going to. So BCH like this, this is a massive down move.
2911.76s:  This is a 2.9% standard deviation downside move. So even with the dividend,
2919.44s:  and this has been trading really strong, this I actually would be interested to eyeball it for a
2927.60s:  potential upside play. Big put OI. And let's see where most of those puts are
2938.88s:  in July 18 and 18 July and 17 oct so much further out in time. I would be in here in 16 May. Super
2947.36s:  liquid. So I would probably have to play the front. And again, this would be a standard trade that
2954.72s:  would not be suitable for my account. But if I had a smaller account, I would be looking
2959.92s:  potentially to size it down massively, trade a one lot too lot. Again, depending on the size of
2964.32s:  the count, but for my account, this is not tradable. There's nothing, nothing useful to me,
2972.56s:  unfortunate, but an idea at least to be aware of. In V, this will be the same case.
2982.64s:  And this one actually has decent risk premiums. You could see it's been trending sideways in
2990.80s:  this three handle for a really long time. So this could be an interesting short strangle.
2996.64s:  Again, all of these names that are like this small, you kind of just have to
3002.56s:  see if it's something that's even worthwhile for the portfolio. But this is, well, this actually
3008.16s:  shouldn't even be in this scan. One on here. How is this in this scan? The reason why this
3019.28s:  shouldn't be in the scan is because the gap down should be at least 5%. I'll show you that the
3023.52s:  scan is and total OI should be greater than 500. So something with less than 100 options shouldn't
3034.96s:  be in here. Let's see if these are overriding one another. Why would this be in here?
3043.28s:  Yeah, anyways, I don't want to get to it. That shouldn't be any. Let's take a look at LALAS.
3051.28s:  Turnings now. LAN NKE NKE. 2.4% downside standard deviation. This has been rolling down though.
3062.80s:  So this is a tricky one. How did it do on earnings? Be on EPS, bad guidance for sure.
3073.84s:  So even though this had an extended downside move, I actually don't favor this for a price
3079.92s:  mean reversion. I actually favor this for a continuation.
3082.88s:  The market seems to like a little bit of upside activity here. Interestingly enough.
3096.48s:  Huh. Let's see really quick.
3100.40s:  So what I'm doing now is seeing how it recently has been behaving.
3115.60s:  Yeah, that makes sense. Call premiums falling off a cliff. Exactly what I would expect to see.
3121.60s:  Take a look. This is what I want. So big changes in March 21. So obviously that's people moving
3136.96s:  around. And then so it's all the front. Like most of them are in the front explorations.
3143.36s:  Yeah, okay. So then this would be, how's the skew? Don't love that.
3163.84s:  Yeah. 27% vol. The 31s.
3176.80s:  28. So actually it's pretty flat on the call skew.
3183.20s:  Yeah, I mean, this could be something easy for some short calls, gain some short delta's.
3188.72s:  This is a little bit more appropriately priced. So it's easier to trade. I don't love the 72 and a
3193.04s:  half. I would prefer it to be an even strike. But I don't really like the liquidity here on the 75s.
3199.68s:  So this would be fine. So that's an idea. Basic short calls and something like this.
3208.40s:  Again, for me, shorter term ideas. And the reason why short calls is I don't actually favor it.
3215.04s:  Or some sort of like big downside break. But I do think it would be slower to recover
3222.16s:  up past 75. And the reason I'm saying 75 versus my strike of 72 and a half is there's just an
3228.48s:  easy role in there. Because it effectively hasn't been above 82. So even managing the longer term trend
3238.64s:  with respect to the previous six months. Because again, remember, I'm not really trading in my lens.
3246.16s:  I'm not really trading things for three, four, five month hypothesis here. Just the market has become
3252.08s:  a little too active for that. Let's take a look at a couple others. These again, just looking at kind of
3257.20s:  some short delta ideas.
3264.32s:  The other thing to keep in mind is ADRs have been doing really well. So I still have my Boba trade on.
3273.20s:  And like the ADR world has actually been performing really, really well.
3286.24s:  Let's take a look at FedEx. FedEx has been another interesting one as I was thinking about it. Yeah,
3290.48s:  look at this.
3293.52s:  Mist on earnings. So I'm sure guidance was soft. Let's just poke through. What do we got?
3298.64s:  1750. We got a few minutes. Let's take a look at FedEx. Earnings really fast.
3305.04s:  And see if anything jumps out to us from the report itself.
3317.28s:  Earnings release here. Earnings presentation. This is what we want.
3328.96s:  And we'll zoom in.
3331.60s:  Now again, when I'm doing these personally, a lot of times what I'll do is I'll scrape the
3336.80s:  internet and then I'll actually run it through chat you PT now. But when I'm doing these streams
3341.84s:  with you guys, I actually think it's really important to crack open a few of these. One,
3345.76s:  to get familiar with looking at them. But then two, to get exposure to first hand source information,
3352.40s:  to take information that you see in a presentation like this and then to turn it into usable information.
3359.28s:  So let's see if that's the case here. I don't know yet.
3370.96s:  Yeah, so like revenue is trash.
3378.64s:  Revenue is absolute trash. So they are really not effectively expanding. We know this.
3384.64s:  Industrial economy remains weak. We know this.
3389.12s:  Volume trends by service. Let's see.
3399.68s:  International exports going up, freight going down, ground package going nowhere,
3407.20s:  priority and deferred flat. So the next thing to do is to figure out how much of the business
3416.32s:  is tied to these different things. So let's take a look at FedEx.
3427.92s:  And let's see.
3437.92s:  I mean, it doesn't. It's surprising. It actually surprises me that it looks this soft.
3445.84s:  How is it doing compared to UP? Yeah, see like look at this.
3452.16s:  The forward P E's 11. This is weaker. This is weaker. And exactly they're even trailing UPS.
3466.00s:  Wow. It's actually surprising. So this tells me a lot of stuff out of the gate. But
3472.16s:  from a high level, it surprises me to see like this level of weakness specifically in FedEx.
3482.32s:  Look at this.
3490.24s:  Wow. What is going on with you guys?
3494.00s:  I want to see their. I want to see the earnings call. Oh, no, I don't care about this.
3508.40s:  Do they have the transcript?
3515.12s:  So what I do with this again, feed it to chat GPT. I have a specific research analyst tool
3521.68s:  that I've been building to help me with stuff like this.
3527.04s:  So I'm going to ask it analyze this transcript and summarize all key trends specifically
3536.24s:  identify forecast information. All right, let's see what it's got.
3542.64s:  I'm telling you guys, if AI isn't firmly integrated with your process, you are literally so
3556.48s:  underpowered. It's not funny. Like using AI for stuff like this is just it literally is a cheat code
3564.32s:  because these typically take me a little while to read and synthesize. But now it's like,
3568.88s:  okay, so FedEx will separate FedEx freight within 18 months.
3598.88s:  There we go. Sorry, guys. Where did I leave off? No, so it's still this fucking CPU GPU issue.
3616.16s:  Sorry about that. Where did I leave off? I was talking about FedEx. I was talking about the spin off.
3622.80s:  Did you guys catch that or no?
3629.28s:  I can backtrack. I just want to reduce
3636.56s:  most, I think. Okay, I'll just highlight it super fast. So one of the key themes that they're
3641.92s:  talking about is separating freight within 18 months, which makes sense because freight is underperforming.
3647.92s:  I think freight highlights is the largest LTL carrier by revenue.
3654.64s:  They're operating profit increase 25% it did increase and it looks like they're looking to
3659.76s:  expand a little bit. They're expecting to achieve 4 billion in savings. He note savings.
3669.28s:  Cost optimization is one of the levers somebody can pull to increase profitability.
3677.28s:  Normally, if you have a company that is aggressively expanding or consuming market share,
3683.04s:  you care less about costs and you care more about acquiring new business. So the fact that
3689.12s:  they're expecting to see that amount in savings and cost reduction means that the company is
3693.76s:  slowing down massively. They're looking to roll out network 2.0, which is an initiative to consolidate
3704.40s:  operations, one truck, one neighborhood that is designed to target 2 billion in savings by 27.
3712.16s:  Tri-color air strategy, again, efficiency and density. So a lot of these things are
3720.40s:  really designed savings costs. Let's take a look at guidance.
3724.16s:  Revenue expected to be up slightly. You're over here in Q3, Q4, Cyber Week boosted expected
3730.08s:  Q3, USPS contract headwinds, peak season volumes ahead of forecast in December, but not expected to
3738.00s:  carry through second half. Great expected to have seen revenue trow in Q2, so expecting sequential
3745.84s:  improvement. Okay. So it looks pretty soft. ISM shows 24 of last 25 months in contraction. This is
3757.68s:  for industrial economy. 60% of express and 90% of LTL revenue or business B2B, business to business
3766.00s:  linked. So this not only impacts FedEx, but this impacts a lot of the B2B consumers that they
3774.32s:  work with. And you can see why they're trying to unwind great, which makes a lot of sense.
3780.24s:  Interesting. Super interesting. So the tradable ideas from here, in my mind, is short FedEx.
3790.64s:  I would feel pretty comfortable with that kind of broader idea. Yeah, take a look, take a look at this.
3799.92s:  10 strike wide. Let's take a look at five strike wide. So one quick note is if you're looking at
3806.24s:  a standard expiration and it's too wide to get the level of fidelity you want on probabilities,
3811.28s:  you can always click in to a weekly or get closer in time. And as you do that, you'll tend to see
3817.68s:  more strikes. So you'll see five strikes there, five strikes there, 10 strikes in the standards.
3824.24s:  Let's see if they have singles in here, no in there. Two and a halfs in here in the 12 days.
3830.48s:  And two and a halfs in here. So let's take a look at the two and a halfs, just that curiosity.
3835.36s:  What I want to do is get a sense of the skew.
3841.04s:  So I mean, look at, look at this. This is all you need to see up out front. Look at the volume
3846.24s:  build out. That's not. So for those that don't know, this is a custom vol over,
3852.08s:  oh, I script that I made that tracks on a relative basis and the in the put build out is huge
3858.72s:  in the near term. Let's take a quick look here. FDX.
3875.60s:  Exactly what I expected to see.
3880.24s:  Exactly what I expected to take a look at the put build out.
3884.80s:  That's short AF. So this would be the kind of thing that for me, again, with the shorter term
3891.84s:  timeframes and short calls tend to take some time in order to come in. What I would do is actually size
3897.36s:  the trade up a little bit more than I would want. That's how I would gain the speed. And again,
3903.44s:  sizing up means give and take, right? If it moves against me in a big way, it would hurt.
3908.80s:  So it does require active management. But
3915.36s:  that's the general way I would play. You can see most of the puts were actually being sold
3921.28s:  that occurred at the bid. But 50% took between the market and
3927.36s:  and 24% of the calls were bought. That's actually a little higher than I would have expected.
3935.52s:  28 March is where a lot of that volume build out is. Let's take a look at the surface really fast.
3943.76s:  Yeah. So the market is pricing in a higher probability of a smaller downside move with actually
3958.72s:  some upside severity. Interestingly, the tails on the out of the money calls being that high is
3964.56s:  a little surprising. That's what I see here. Cool. All right. I got to say 1800. I'm going to turn
3977.92s:  to questions. So feel free to throw whatever you want to take a look at in the chat. I'm going to run
3985.28s:  to the kitchen real quick. But I'm going to pick up with this one from Sky Omen and then throw
3992.24s:  anything else you want to take a look at. I'll be back in like a minute.
4052.24s:  I'm going to grab some sugar. Pretty bad. All right.
4080.00s:  So James says to oversimplify, VRP equals HV minus IV. You can do it that way. Involuntos seems to
4093.28s:  use a 30 day forward implied. However, in your VRP video, you use HV20. What's the reason in the
4103.12s:  discrepancy for the look back date? It's a really good question. And it's a perceptive question.
4109.60s:  So what is the timestamp? We're at like one hour eight minutes.
4116.16s:  So here is the answer to this. And it's actually a very simple answer.
4123.12s:  The reason why you see this is because the dates used in each are different.
4133.52s:  So implied volatility uses calendar days. Historic volatility uses trading date.
4140.08s:  So that's why you see 30 for IV, 20 for HV.
4143.76s:  And their guess is exactly what we would expect without any context. What if thought it would be 30, 30?
4153.76s:  And that's why it's not. Next part.
4165.28s:  When we look at the plot, it shows forward 30 days.
4170.08s:  If we want to see if VRP exists in weeklies, there's a way that shows you to define period.
4175.12s:  Yeah, definitely. So that's exactly why you see the plot on mine built as it is.
4184.96s:  So if you take a look at, and again, this is the basic one, the actual surface that I'll use for
4190.24s:  VRP is in Excel. Because it's a little denser. And I run a couple other things in conjunction with
4196.96s:  it. But for kind of like simplicity and tracking, you can see what I do here is I run different periods.
4205.44s:  One day, vol, two day, vol, seven day, 30 day, 365 annual. And then I can take a look at risk
4212.08s:  premiums for one day, two days, seven day, 30 day, and so on and so forth. So you can custom code
4219.28s:  these to grab different periods and look back periods. The other thing that's kind of cool is
4223.76s:  you can change the way that it calculates historic vol. A lot of times things will just use close to
4230.72s:  close, which is okay. But close to close only tells half the story, right? If something closes
4239.44s:  like this, close to close, but it has a massive big day like this, there's way more vol in this day
4247.68s:  than what the close to close would show you. Close to close would show you effectively going from
4252.24s:  here to here. Whereas in reality, it went from here to here to here to here, much bigger day.
4261.44s:  So that's another thing to tinker with with respect to using the vol calculations is for realized
4268.80s:  vol, you can use a lot of different things. And then for forward vol, you can either site from the
4273.52s:  options chain, right? So we can take a look at the front explorations for near term vol. But the
4281.12s:  other thing is you can take the 30 day vol and you can turn it into any period you want, right?
4285.84s:  It's just a matter of doing the square root of time. And you can tinker with different time frames
4292.08s:  using the base vol from the underlying from here. Or you can create your own vol surface to come up
4300.24s:  with different expectations for different durations. But yeah, you in a nutshell can custom script
4306.64s:  that to be a lot of different things depending on what you're interested in. So that's a great question.
4311.36s:  Glad you asked. I'm going to James. Are you? Okay, James is on the chat good. So James, you got your
4317.28s:  answer here, but I was going to tag you in the in the discord, but it looks like you're here.
4323.76s:  So yeah, that's that. Any other questions you guys want to take a look at? Risa says I've seen
4329.04s:  heavy put selling broadly assuming because elevated IV, but tough to read. Yeah, that's a little
4336.08s:  ambiguous. That's a little ambiguous to. So with it like really depends on what you mean by put
4344.24s:  selling and what broadly means if we're talking sectors like yeah, what the overall
4350.32s:  what the overall trend is that you're seeing, but the market itself absolutely is showing
4363.44s:  a series of different hands and we can look at it from a broader breadth indicator, but I think
4371.12s:  the market right now is actually in a very defensive posture. That's what I pick up broadly.
4376.48s:  And the other thing that I identify here is we can take a look at different period
4382.24s:  volatilities, right? So we can look at 90 day compared to three day and actually now I'm going to
4390.32s:  update these super fast because I think it would be good to have beyond 90 day with
4396.96s:  how things have been going. I think we can go out to probably like 150 day. We can add that
4405.44s:  but anyways using just the 90 day unfortunately because the vol has really peaked up near term,
4412.40s:  right? You can take a look at the five day vol even in individual tickers. Let's take a look at
4417.04s:  it's like spy and you can see that compared to 90 to five day, it's still way more volatile on a
4424.80s:  relative basis. Same thing for the average true range, two different measures of vol. So
4430.24s:  definitely seeing vol pick up across the board, but one of the big things to keep track of,
4436.88s:  especially with the broader market is the behavior of something like VIX. And VIX is actually showing
4443.04s:  you a lot. So we're seeing short term daily vol actually quite high. And then if we're taking
4455.20s:  look at the trend in VIX, VIX has actually been unwinding pretty nicely. Now I had a couple short VIX
4465.04s:  plays on playing two different things. One of them was literally playing raw price direction.
4471.52s:  And I was trying to hold out for 30, but as soon as I saw this double peak at 29 and a half,
4477.60s:  as soon as it started dipping below 29 as when the fades came on. And this is just playing
4484.64s:  the transit transitory phases of vol. And I don't think it's done here. I think that the
4489.28s:  probabilities in my mind lead towards another potential spike in vol. I don't think it's done,
4496.32s:  especially with the releases this week. And then more importantly, with the tariffs coming out
4503.36s:  on the second, I think you'll see a lot of that bleed through into the broader market expectations.
4510.16s:  So yeah, I think vol definitely is here. I think the VIX is only telling us one side
4519.36s:  of the broader vol picture, but I think there's a little more going on.
4523.44s:  Then if we take a look, Reese want to take a peek at Nvidia. Happy to. I think I agree. I still
4530.32s:  think Nvidia. I don't think it's baby with the bathwater because if you look at the multiples
4535.52s:  on Nvidia, Nvidia was was pretty pretty strong. So let's take a look at Nvidia here.
4546.08s:  And if we take a look at the forward PE, it's come down massively. The trailing PE was a bit higher,
4556.00s:  and this has been trending down as well. So I think the valuations on Nvidia actually are coming
4562.56s:  into a really interesting place. I think for a long time in video was a pretty high flyer,
4570.24s:  actually. So this recent activity, I think, has brought it back down to Earth, so to speak.
4579.12s:  Now, the question is always from a trader's lens is, well, what matters to us?
4588.32s:  And that typically is going to be some sort of price behavior, right? We care about
4595.28s:  what price is doing. And for me, it's still not doing well. So this isn't the point where from
4603.04s:  a trader lens, I would run in and start putting on positions. And it's really for that reason.
4609.60s:  I think it doesn't, I don't think it looks great. I think it needs to still gather its feet.
4615.68s:  And in a long term, I absolutely think, and I've said this multiple times, I think all of these
4620.48s:  periods, effectively, with it dropping below 120 or just fantastic long-term investment opportunities
4627.12s:  in video, I just don't think there's any other way to look at it. It is literally at the
4630.80s:  epicenter of all of the broad technological changes that are coming down the pike. And I think
4636.48s:  that it's non-disputable. I think there's been a lot of people that have made tremendous amounts
4644.16s:  of money in Nvidia. So at some point, there's going to be people taking profits, right? And
4650.48s:  rightfully so, because on a split-adjusted basis, I mean, take a look. On a split-adjusted basis,
4655.76s:  the point of control right now is at three, no, I lied, 451. So let's take a look at what that
4663.92s:  represents. So this is 451 with price peaking at 153. That represents a 3,292.5% return.
4681.92s:  And if you take a look at the basis of these people when they got into it, again, around these
4686.56s:  levels, it's not even like we're going back super far, right? People back here got in for less than
4692.16s:  a dollar on a split-adjusted basis. But a lot of these people were getting in in 19 and 20 at these
4697.44s:  levels. So for those folks, when you see stuff coming up at these high levels, there's going to be
4704.48s:  an uptick in selling to some degree, because why would you not start locking in some of those
4711.28s:  profits, which is exactly what I think you're seeing some of this near term behavior? We take a look
4718.96s:  inside our behavior. Let's take a look. So I want to sort this by date. I want to see the recent stuff.
4731.44s:  So this is 21 March, all of these. And what do you see? It's exactly what I would expect to see.
4739.68s:  It's more senior level folks that are taking profits, which is exactly correct.
4747.28s:  The smart move.
4752.72s:  With something trading at these levels, and with the amount of profit that a lot of these folks
4758.96s:  will have built in here, I genuinely believe it's the smart answer. And I think longer term
4765.92s:  anyways, it's healthier for the stock, because I think in video, even it's crazy to say this,
4774.48s:  but it's almost becoming a bargain buy, which is absolutely nuts to say in my opinion.
4784.96s:  I think the idea that this is a bargain play is absolutely insane, but I do think that is what
4794.88s:  you're seeing here. So because of that, I think longer term idea, good, I think shorter term idea,
4803.04s:  tenuous, I think it's reasonable to trade the vol around this period, but beyond that,
4811.44s:  not a whole much more in addition to that from my lens, at least than the near term.
4818.32s:  But for me, I have exposure personally to Nvidia through the teacher-pacuse position,
4824.64s:  through the SSO position that I've had. And I actually have swing traded in video a little bit
4831.20s:  as things move around just because it has been really volatile. If you take a look even at this
4837.12s:  most recent move, not from the lows, but from the closes, this is a 15% move in a couple weeks.
4846.80s:  But that being said, it definitely is weak. I don't think that there's a whole lot of debate
4857.60s:  in the near term that can be had about the weakness because it is continually trending down.
4863.68s:  It is starting to try to find a floor, but it's not found yet. Right? Lower, high, lower, high, lower,
4869.68s:  high, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, lower, low. So if this starts to
4876.48s:  consolidate and buck this trend, then obviously we start to see a reversal of the trend. But before that,
4883.28s:  this isn't there. Yeah.
4888.56s:  Any other questions? Anything else that you'd like to take a look at while we're on here hanging out?
4894.88s:  I just put in my dinner order. It's not going to be here for a while. So I still have some time.
4900.08s:  There was a question in the discord that I actually want to flag more broadly.
4908.24s:  So let me grab this. I think it's a good conversation point. Most of you will have seen it.
4917.76s:  Again, from the discord more broadly, but Elizabeth had a question earlier today about tracking
4927.84s:  indicators. And this is a really, really great question because one of the important things
4934.08s:  that we can do as a trader while we're building a system is have like intentional actions.
4942.56s:  So one of the things that people will do is they'll just kind of like put on trades,
4947.92s:  just put on ideas, see how it goes, and then they'll have this really slanted memory of how things
4954.16s:  actually went. And that's wrong. So in this context, what we're trying to do is build a system
4962.08s:  that allows us to monitor the things that we're looking at to explore a trade idea. So then we
4968.48s:  can make an evaluation on their efficacy. That's exactly what this is. And that's very, very cool.
4974.40s:  It's something I think is really important to do, especially for highly directional turnover
4980.16s:  style trades because you really are relying on a lot of those kinds of indicators, especially
4985.92s:  for trading things like long options, which I'm not sure if this is that. But the way that I think
4991.04s:  about doing something like this is actually very, very simple. If we go into a Google sheet and we
4999.04s:  just grab, I'm no idea what all this is. This is my scratch sheet. So we'll just clear all this
5006.16s:  nonsense out. And let's say for a simple example, our idea, if I can type into this without it
5017.04s:  freezing, our idea is let's say, Intraday price, cross over VWAP, trade in the direction,
5036.08s:  set a stop below initial VWAP, cross. Very simple idea. So then what we would do
5045.84s:  is we would build the infrastructure to actually track this. We would again go into our trading plan
5052.64s:  and we would define this further in our strategy outline. We need to figure out what kind of tickers
5057.12s:  apply to this. What the profit mechanism is those kinds of things. But to just show you in a simple
5064.56s:  example here. So then we would have something like date, probably a time because that actually
5070.80s:  will matter for intraday trading date time ticker will have the price level. And then we can have
5078.96s:  VWAP level. You can do VWAP level a couple of different ways. You can do whatever the VWAP level is.
5087.04s:  I actually like tracking something like VWAP level. And the reason is because then you can do a
5096.96s:  bunch of math that gives us a ton of context without having to do things yourself like is price
5104.00s:  above VWAP? Is price far above VWAP? How much further above VWAP is it? You can literally do all of
5112.48s:  those calculations over here. And then the important thing as always is the ability to aggregate this
5118.80s:  data up into something usable. So the way that that works is once we have enough samples in here,
5125.28s:  we can take a look at the trends. We can say price on VWAP or price behavior for the
5133.76s:  X period of time following VWAP tends to be blank and so on and so forth. Then you actually
5139.28s:  can build a trade idea off of that. So this is exactly how I would go about building the technical
5145.60s:  analysis tracker so that it's something you can aggregate the data and have ideas of their performance.
5153.68s:  What I do in a lot of my tools for stuff like this is I build an aggregation tool that does
5165.20s:  once I'll grab the headers for you. That does this. So what I do is this is the aggregation level.
5176.40s:  So then I would have on this side over here things like strategy or in this case it would be
5183.04s:  analysis indicator and I would list them all out and then I would track some of these metrics.
5189.76s:  And then beyond tracking of the metrics I would also pay really close attention to time frames.
5196.16s:  So above it I have a secondary version of this that I can input date windows so I can say like one
5204.96s:  Jan to one March. And then what it does is it pulls up I would input the strategy so in this case
5212.64s:  let's say it's iron condors. I would input the strategy it then goes through the strategy performance
5218.72s:  from here. It pulls up the top level performance for the entire strategy and then it also pulls up
5226.48s:  the sample performance from all of this stuff down here which are the individual trades.
5231.36s:  So I literally would do this and it's because it will help a lot with again quantitatively
5242.24s:  identifying what's working for you and in what way because what doesn't work is guessing.
5248.00s:  Guessing works terribly. In fact.
5252.96s:  All right. Mateo, what up? Good to see you Mateo.
5257.76s:  Tulk fee says are you confident with Nvidia long term because you have a belief that AI will develop
5262.56s:  towards a GI or is there more that you think in demand for GPUs will continue even if AI development
5269.04s:  plateaus. That's a great question. I think it's because Nvidia's involvement in technology. Notice
5274.88s:  how I didn't restrict it to AI. I do think AI is probably going to going to be one of the largest
5281.36s:  revolutions that might outpace even the internet definitely pace it but might even outpace the
5290.24s:  total impact. So because of that the adoption of AI is going to be literally profound. It's going
5301.12s:  to be insane. We can already see it starting to happen. Now from that lens I think AI's ability to
5309.76s:  transform the landscape is so huge and I think Nvidia's involvement in that process is massive.
5316.40s:  So I think that gives it a massive singular way to benefit in the future but I think beyond that
5323.28s:  Nvidia has ingratiated itself in just about all major technological adoptions that I can find
5331.76s:  even down to supplying chips to automotive manufacturers which are becoming increasingly
5338.32s:  dependent on technology and chip production. So because of all of that and how expansive it is
5347.92s:  I don't see technological innovation slowing. I see it continuing to expand and evolve in a lot of
5353.60s:  different ways and I think so far Nvidia has positioned itself almost as a hedgemon because Intel
5361.84s:  does not pace Nvidia obviously different business as well but Intel Nvidia doesn't really have a
5370.72s:  lot of big competition at this point with what it does and how how expansive it is. So that's why
5378.24s:  I think it has a very robust business with a tremendous amount of potential. Now I think a lot
5386.00s:  of that potential at different points has been priced in but I do think the longer term
5394.24s:  multiple that it's at now is actually pretty conservative. Well, I think this thing having a
5399.44s:  lower than industry PE for the four or 12 months is actually nuts. I think that's like a straight
5405.12s:  up bargain and then I also think the value on the name is pretty strong.
5412.16s:  EHODGE says do you have a video on how you analyze a company for long term investing?
5416.72s:  I don't because honestly I don't do it. Most like the overwhelming majority of I like I really
5425.60s:  don't hold anything long term. Even the equity component of the coverage triangle when I'm trading ETFs
5431.44s:  that would be like the longest term holdings and very frequently like it's not holding the same shares
5438.88s:  for multi-year periods. I'm cycling through the shares held, scaling in,
5443.92s:  scaling out as things move around. So I don't actually think I have
5450.56s:  I don't think I have much material on like the long term investment approach because it's just
5454.16s:  really not something I do. I think in general I keep in mind those ideas and those potentials
5461.04s:  because I know different people have different time frames that they're trying to invest in.
5465.04s:  So obviously I try to be helpful but yeah for myself the majority of what I'm doing is going
5469.84s:  to be shorter term. Now when we're in a bull market I definitely hold stuff longer but it's still
5474.48s:  not long term. It's still not multi-year periods for me typically.
5483.36s:  Paulus says I read that some of the 40% of price of a car is electronics and software. I definitely
5489.12s:  think it would depend on the car but let's see real quick. So break I'm asking in chat
5498.80s:  breakdown the cost the current cost to produce a car by category. What percentage of the cost
5513.12s:  comes from chip usage?
5515.60s:  Let's see we'll find that out. What else you guys got? Jonathan says AMD could have been
5530.88s:  competition but they kept filming the law. I completely agree. There was a pretty long period
5536.24s:  actually where those two were very very dominant competitors. So if you take a look at Nvidia
5544.72s:  and then if you take a look at AMD and then if we zoom these out much longer term let's go to
5549.68s:  like a 10-year period of this. Let's go to a 10-year here.
5556.64s:  For a long time actually these guys were pretty strong competitors and I think
5564.56s:  your observation that AMD kept fumbling the ball couldn't be more correct because there is a period
5572.88s:  realistically that AMD was even outpacing Nvidia. Take a look at the relative move here.
5581.04s:  So let's take a look at 21 into 22 this period here. If you take a look at those relative periods
5587.12s:  to one another it's not even close. It really isn't. If we isolate 21 into 22
5597.04s:  21. Oh damn. Damn Daniel.
5607.28s:  21 I don't want a short change.
5613.52s:  21 into 22 right like the move in here is just significant. So I definitely think
5624.00s:  there was an opportunity there and then they unfortunately weren't able to successfully capitalize on it.
5631.60s:  So yeah I think it's a completely accurate observation.
5640.72s:  Mateo sorry Paul says talking of chips what is ARM feeling? Let's see. ARM. Nothing.
5650.96s:  Chips are hurting really across the board.
5656.56s:  They do look a little bit better.
5672.16s:  Their earnings look soft.
5673.76s:  I mean I guess they're crushing expectations though. They are crushing it.
5687.44s:  Yeah I mean it really does look like they're like performing a little bit better here.
5694.48s:  But still short term downtrend. Take a look at the options chain.
5700.16s:  I mean all skew and a lot of that call skew is in for April actually.
5706.72s:  When's it's earnings? Oh that's weird. That's really weird.
5712.88s:  So it has earnings on 7 May but take a look at all of these calls in for April.
5720.32s:  3000 against 2000 okay so it's not that much.
5726.56s:  It just looks dominant.
5731.12s:  Imagine most people would be playing it for earnings. Yeah 19 against 26.
5734.48s:  They're their hedging downside on earnings.
5738.40s:  What about these longer term options?
5740.08s:  Yeah and then people are playing it long term to the upside.
5742.48s:  That's just long term bullish bias.
5746.00s:  28 June is 27 against 18. 16 Jan 123 against 58.
5750.24s:  This is just long term long term stock replacement.
5755.12s:  That's exactly what that is.
5757.84s:  I'm going to tell you this if you wanted to buy leaps to run the poor man's covered call
5762.40s:  which I don't trade that personally. I trade ratio-called diagonals and collect income.
5767.76s:  Where would you be looking in why at those tickers?
5770.08s:  Yeah that's a great question.
5770.96s:  I have actually an entire playlist on the ratio-called diagonal in how I trade that.
5777.84s:  But effectively the premise that I'm looking for in a ratio-called diagonal
5782.72s:  if we were to use just the general outlier strategy process.
5788.40s:  Hold on Mateo says my understanding is that you want to buy low IV long term look for high
5793.12s:  short term IV to sell or over. See that is completely misunderstanding the game.
5799.60s:  It's a common mistake and there's a specific reason why that's completely misunderstanding the
5806.80s:  game. Let's take a look at an example. Let's find something that actually looks even remotely
5820.16s:  reasonable. I'm just going to grab something from this list here. This is like a bullish scan for
5828.80s:  stuff see if any name here. Fix out to me. Yes. Yeah this is fine. So WGS.
5843.60s:  So looking at WGS if we're trying to trade something to the upside.
5849.76s:  Let's just do a little bit of ballparking here.
5855.52s:  If we take a look at the ball ring here which I actually realize
5871.84s:  we should update the script shouldn't we?
5874.00s:  I think this script would be good if we had a little bit of context on the high and low.
5888.32s:  So let's grab this.
5894.56s:  And then this is going to be part of the example by the way. I didn't forget you.
5899.04s:  And then for this let's do update the script.
5914.32s:  So at the beginning of the IV label there is a h-l.
5929.28s:  That's actually a lie.
5931.52s:  Update the script.
5939.20s:  So the 7 and 30 IV HV and VRP label include the high.
5961.04s:  Oh fuck. I don't know what's up.
5965.76s:  Include the high, low, and average for the period.
5974.16s:  Okay so we're going to let that run. And then while this is doing that I'll get back to the example.
5981.84s:  So your question of we should be looking to get low long term IV and then high short term IV.
5992.40s:  Now there's nothing wrong with that. That is what I would call a secondary function though.
6000.00s:  And I'll explain why.
6001.76s:  WGS right now has an implied volatility of over 100%.
6009.76s:  We don't know if that's higher low but on a relative value IVPS 54.
6014.08s:  So that means that right now the implied volatility is higher than it is over half the time.
6018.24s:  So objectively it's high.
6020.16s:  However if we look at the performance of this strategy or of this underlying even from before
6028.88s:  earnings here from like the second of seven Feb to current it's a 77.7% move.
6041.36s:  So if you're optimizing for a secondary function in this case I want to get lower IV then that
6050.72s:  would lead this to be not suitable for a long option strategy which would be a mistake.
6056.48s:  It's really important when you're trading strategies to always put first things first.
6061.12s:  And in something like a ratio called diagonal or in your instance a poor man's covered call
6067.36s:  is the way that you really make money on something like that is if it goes in the correct
6073.04s:  direction if it goes up you want upward movement. Now for a poor man's covered call it is a
6078.08s:  slightly different scenario because typically you'll actually have upside risk which I actually
6083.44s:  find to be a shortfall with how most people set up something like a poor man's covered call
6089.28s:  versus how I trade ratio called diagonals but the primary profit mechanism here is still price
6095.36s:  direction. You need price direction and move in your favor. So I think there's nothing wrong with
6102.72s:  sub optimizing or trying to get in with good IV parameters because IV is a big part of this.
6110.72s:  And if you grossly overpay for IV unless you are very correct in terms of your directional
6118.56s:  hypothesis then it will hurt. But in the example of a ratio called diagonal it doesn't really matter
6127.04s:  how much you pay for IV as long as the direction your trading is correct. You can have IV that's
6133.52s:  really overstated that contract significantly during the move but as long as the move is big enough
6139.44s:  because your analysis is looking for that it will easily overpower the IV move.
6144.64s:  So that's the context as to why and a quick reminder for something like that is you can always
6150.32s:  just use the Greeks right so if you go out to 19 step they only go out 180 days versus leaps but
6155.92s:  close enough. And if you take a look at delta or even a slightly in the money option it's 67.
6164.40s:  You look at the Vega it's 27 right so delta your directional exposure is literally over two times
6171.12s:  that of your vol exposure. Now you have to do a little bit of an analysis based on how much
6176.72s:  the volatility moves compared to how much the direction moves and that's exactly how you can
6181.68s:  use things like ADR, ATR, total ranges for sure that's typically what I would do for that broader
6189.76s:  context but yeah in this case if you over optimize for IV well you're over optimizing for the wrong
6197.84s:  thing it's you need direction so. Jonathan says even recently with the pricing of the 1970
6208.64s:  they're trying to emulate what Nvidia yeah I agree and AMD has been on the back foot for some time
6214.64s:  actually which is a bit of a bummer because I really do think that they were pretty well positioned
6219.28s:  for a while. Paul says many chip companies did did have extravagant P.E.s and that's why you
6225.20s:  saw them get crushed so hard even though that the prospects look so good for them in a high
6230.96s:  inflationary or even a recession prone environment high P.E. names get crushed because expectation
6238.72s:  of future earnings naturally contracts pretty massively so yeah I think that that completely aligns.
6247.76s:  All right cool that about wraps me up so just to summarize the game plan for the week it does
6254.40s:  look like there are a couple bigger releases for the S&P 500 we see that later definitely later
6262.24s:  in the week I think that the near term game plan remains about the same for me it will include
6269.04s:  probably managing those coverage strangles this week specifically on the short put side.
6273.52s:  Risk premium trade specifically in the indices continue to be extremely lucrative the
6279.36s:  ball trade and VIX also extremely lucrative especially for pops above 25 so keeping eyes on that
6286.56s:  I think the other thing I'm paying attention to is any residual earnings movement so post
6292.00s:  earnings announcement drift although the time frames I've been trading those is contracted
6296.00s:  and then most of what I'm trading right now is short premium strategies and it's because the market
6300.80s:  more broadly is favoring that not just because of the vault but because of the actual price movements
6306.24s:  a lot of the price movements have been way more choppy as compared to trendy so that benefits
6312.72s:  sell side strategies so that's what it's looking like as always if you guys need anything you can
6317.76s:  hit me up in the discord you can use the ask Eric channel that's the one I monitor the most
6323.28s:  closely so anything directly for me I will see it there if you need anything else in the meantime
6328.56s:  let your boy know be an outlier see you later
