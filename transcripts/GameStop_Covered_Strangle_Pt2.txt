0.64s: what's up outliers quick market update
3.28s: specifically on GameStop actually I'm
4.92s: going to start doing a few videos per
7.08s: week covering a couple different covered
9.76s: strangles that I trade and as we
12.76s: discussed in the introduction video
14.88s: specifically for GameStop I have an
17.28s: allocation of the portfolio that I'm
19.28s: using to trade a coverage strangle in
21.64s: GameStop and then I also have other ones
23.28s: in some leverage ETFs ibit for Bitcoin
26.04s: and those will be separate videos so the
28.12s: goal for today is to walk you through
29.60s: some updates on the position as it sits
33.48s: you a quick overview of what seems to be
35.92s: going on in GameStop because had a
38.80s: really good day today especially with
40.52s: the rest of the market showing as much
42.08s: weakness as it did GameStop is genuinely
46.64s: showing Market strength which is very
49.20s: very cool to see so from a quick
51.60s: technical overview looking at a
53.08s: six-month daily chart that's what's up
54.84s: here now we can see that it's been just
57.60s: kind of running up along the trend line
60.80s: for a little while now and it's
63.52s: progressively posting higher lows and
66.68s: higher highs which obviously is
70.32s: associated with an uptrend now one thing
73.08s: that does stick out to me when looking
74.68s: at GameStop specifically is this trend
77.76s: line is really steep what I do for
80.64s: things like this is I monitor the
82.48s: relationship between the trend line and
85.08s: the standard deviation channels or
86.76s: linear regression channels whichever I
88.28s: happen to have up at the time and I look
90.72s: at the slope in comparison the reason
93.56s: for that is because when we tend to see
96.44s: I guess I tend to see these kinds of
99.16s: more aggressive moves they generally
103.08s: will be followed by a period of
104.68s: consolidation and the reason for that is
107.08s: this is a really aggressive growth
109.24s: trajectory if we take a look from Fall
112.40s: of last year it was around 2053 and as
116.24s: it closed today at 3337 that's a a big
119.44s: move for just about any company over
121.40s: that time frame so this is an aggressive
123.96s: move now GameStop does tend to move a
126.32s: little bit more aggressively than other
127.96s: things that we might trade on a more
130.88s: regular basis and to demonstrate that
133.56s: though I want you to take a look both at
135.76s: the average daily range and the average
138.20s: true range again for a quick reminder
140.92s: average daily range looks at the move of
144.20s: the day and then average true range
147.28s: encompasses the overnight gaps between
149.88s: Queen days so the 5-day average daily
154.04s: range is
155.44s: 6.47% the 20day is 6.6 and then the
158.76s: 90day is 5.98 so about six what I'm
162.60s: showing you is that this has become
165.88s: slightly larger
167.92s: ranges as we get shorter on our time
171.44s: frame that we're looking at that tends
173.04s: to show a little bit of volatility
175.32s: entering the picture this isn't
177.36s: significant because the difference
178.56s: between the 90day and the 5 day isn't
180.32s: massive but still that's something I pay
182.40s: attention to and then the same thing
184.32s: when I look at a 90-day average true
186.88s: range which is
189.16s: 4.65% against the 5day which is 6% so
192.92s: this is demonstrating that very clearly
195.40s: the near-term time frame is more
197.60s: volatile from both a price General Trend
201.88s: perspective but then also from an actual
204.76s: daily price movement perspective as well
208.00s: so there's not a whole lot to take away
210.48s: from that other than bolstering the fact
212.44s: that this is continuing to be an ideal
214.80s: candidate for something like the
215.92s: coverage strangle which if you're not
217.40s: familiar with what that strategy is I
219.16s: encourage you to check out the video in
220.92s: the description below that's the
222.44s: introduction to this series so that you
224.56s: have an idea of what I'm going to be
225.56s: talking about in a minute so the implied
228.32s: volatility is 117% very very high and on
231.08s: a relative basis 58% so also relatively
234.96s: high on a relative basis so it tells
239.80s: tells me that we're still seeing pretty
242.96s: significant volatility even though
245.32s: there's not a whole lot coming up like
247.24s: right now obviously we will be coming
249.08s: into earnings in a couple months but we
251.04s: still have a bit of time before we get
252.76s: there so this is a little interesting
255.96s: that it's that volatile with not a whole
259.44s: lot on the radar right now we can see
262.44s: that the 17g 25 expiration is at 140.6
267.28s: Vol and then it dumps after that 123 24
270.60s: this is the market telling us something
272.20s: is going on here I don't know what it is
273.92s: I I can't see it right now but I can
276.04s: tell you that the market is telling you
277.32s: something is going on here so it's
279.20s: something to be aware of maybe you all
280.96s: know there might be an announcement
282.48s: coming out I haven't looked too far into
284.60s: it yet I'm still getting caught up from
286.56s: coming back from traveling and whatnot
288.20s: so I I haven't done a bunch of deep
289.76s: Dives on the typical names I follow
291.48s: maybe you can get me schooled up but
293.68s: something's going on I can tell you that
294.88s: the market is pricing something in so
296.52s: that's kind of the cool part again about
298.32s: options trading is that you don't
300.04s: necessarily have to know the details of
302.12s: everything to be able to see that
303.76s: something's going on which is clearly
305.68s: the case here now call skew is huge
312.24s: 896
313.88s: th900 calls against
317.20s: 278,000
318.72s: puts that's massive that's almost a
321.76s: three-time variance between these it is
324.04s: essentially three times variance between
325.68s: these normally this will hover around
328.12s: two so there is undoubtedly a lot of
333.44s: action coming into the call side and I
335.56s: want you to
336.76s: notice the colors of these little
338.76s: rectangles you see how they're like that
340.64s: neon blue that neon blue is 17
344.92s: Jan the same expiration that seems to
348.36s: have really high IV so one of the
350.88s: reasons why 17 Jan might have elevated
354.72s: IV compared to the others at least part
356.60s: of it will be because of this because
359.92s: there's so many options in that
361.80s: expiration on a relative basis let's
363.28s: take a look 17 J has over half of that
366.88s: options chain so if we look at all
370.80s: series there's
373.76s: 897 and if we take a look at 17 Gen by
376.88s: its very self it's
379.88s: 477 so that tells you a lot and that's
383.64s: absolutely going to be a contributing
385.32s: factor as to why we see this being as
388.64s: elevated now it might be confusing cuz
390.44s: the colors change when I flip back and
391.80s: forth but now it's the purple that is 17
394.44s: Gen so I find that generally interesting
397.96s: now let's talk about the trade that's
401.64s: sitting right now after some adjustments
404.44s: today and I want to walk you through
406.60s: what I did and why now first things
409.12s: first following up on I got to move this
411.76s: over a little bit so you can see here so
414.64s: following up on the stream from Saturday
417.64s: when we did the gme Stream I had asked
421.04s: what allocation should we use I
422.92s: originally had earmarked $155,000
426.00s: because from prior conversations that
427.92s: seemed to have been closer to like an
431.32s: average GameStop holding size and then
433.56s: when I did the poll on this Saturday it
436.84s: was 25k was a little over half of the
441.20s: submissions for people so I've bumped up
444.52s: the allocation to 25k and I'll continue
448.28s: to modulate this as we go but one note I
451.44s: want to make abundantly clear the base
454.12s: position that I originally started using
456.48s: I'm not going to continue pulling from
458.20s: my existing shares so I want to explain
460.48s: this to you right now if you just
463.00s: pretend over here I have a bucket of
466.04s: GameStop shares relative to My overall
468.92s: portfolio that's Buy and Hold designed
470.96s: to just sit there for this exercise what
474.32s: I've done is grab a portion of this and
478.44s: this is the that I'm using so the 200
483.36s: Shares are part of this broader holding
487.48s: that I've alluded to before but when I'm
490.92s: manipulating this going forward like
493.64s: today I am not going to continue tapping
497.20s: into this existing pool of shares
499.80s: because that doesn't represent the
501.32s: actual strategy and what it would be
502.92s: like to actually run the strategy as of
505.28s: today so for example when I bought the
509.00s: 100 shares today in GameStop at
512.84s: 3223 I've added more this is a net new
517.00s: add to the portfolio so I just wanted to
518.88s: be really clear as we're going forward
520.64s: this was pulling from a portion of an
522.76s: existing holding everything going
525.48s: forward from here is going to be whether
527.68s: we're adding or subtracting based on
529.52s: what's actually happening today and
531.88s: that's just so it's more efficacious for
533.28s: you to follow along right because if
534.96s: somebody's trying to figure out what I'm
536.20s: doing they're like well I don't have
538.04s: shares like this to be able to pull from
540.12s: which I understand it it wouldn't be a
542.84s: great example so I'm just clearly
545.24s: delineating that this was just to start
547.80s: the position and then everything going
550.36s: forward now will be added or subtracted
554.04s: just as I would on a standard open
556.60s: market so all that being said that takes
560.32s: our current Holdings to 300 shares at
563.12s: 2695 I'm actually not super jazzed to
566.04s: buy a bunch of shares here but I need to
568.76s: scale up
570.12s: so that is what it is and when I say
572.64s: that you can see originally I was
575.32s: configured for $15,000 so I think the
578.28s: utilization was like 12 or 13k but now
581.64s: we're at 17K and I need to move this up
585.88s: just a little bit more which I'm going
587.44s: to explain how I've done that through
589.28s: this here so we are 67 a half% utilized
595.96s: the base position Foria shares is set
600.08s: and we have two different expirations
603.24s: now of short puts these are cash secured
606.76s: we have the 21 Feb
609.20s: 28s we have two of those and we have the
614.00s: 10 genan which is this Friday the 32s so
618.36s: notice the difference between these two
621.00s: this is literally a 3 DTE trade against
623.96s: I think this is using different years
626.00s: that's probably why it's confused yeah
627.44s: so this would be 24 is when it was
628.96s: entered
630.00s: that will fix that and you can see this
635.04s: is really shortterm and it's also a much
637.20s: higher Delta I entered this one at a 25
639.28s: Delta entered this one at 44 Delta what
641.04s: am I doing here I'm actually trying to
642.40s: get assigned I'm putting on a trade that
645.60s: is essentially at the money with the
647.84s: expectation of getting assigned that's
649.52s: the game plan right now so if we float
652.68s: into expiration and I get assigned on
654.60s: these great if I don't that's okay I'm
657.24s: going to lay them out for the next week
658.92s: at the money again and this is a way for
661.76s: me to receive a pretty healthy premium
664.56s: relative to the time frame right because
666.52s: take a look this is giving me
668.60s: $287 per contract for a 52-day trade
672.24s: this is giv me 95 cents for a 3-day
674.24s: trade but it's because it's such a
676.32s: higher Delta so on a relative basis this
679.16s: is paying me really really well and this
681.00s: goes back to that example I was just
682.92s: giving you we go back here to this up
686.16s: here the volatility is very high so
689.52s: that's why I'm not buying the shares
691.84s: outright as I typically would I did
695.00s: already to start scaling up because I
696.68s: was grossly uncal but instead of buying
699.80s: 200 shares or 300 shares I chose to buy
703.32s: 100 shares and then sell at the money
706.52s: puts with the intention of getting a
708.44s: sign but I'm going to capitalize on the
710.20s: volatility until that happens and then
713.16s: we will continue to play the game now
715.12s: the other thing I'm going to do is
717.20s: probably sell one more short short call
720.44s: so I have 300 shares and I only have one
724.28s: short call so it's a 3:1 ratio which is
727.20s: about good for a longer term holding for
730.40s: something like this I really want to
732.96s: capitalize on this volatility while it's
735.08s: here so to do that I will ratchet up
738.52s: that ratio a little bit so it would be
740.44s: at a 2 to 3 or 3:2 depending on what
742.28s: you're looking at first shares 3 to two
744.60s: so I would have 300 shares against two
746.12s: short calls maximum 200 Short deless and
749.88s: the intention is not to get aign on
751.52s: those short calls so they would be
753.32s: managed against the long shares via
756.96s: aggressive management meaning I'm paying
758.56s: close attention to it I'm not just
759.72s: letting it go and seeing what happens so
761.68s: that I don't get assigned the risk is
764.80s: that I could get assigned early that is
767.48s: a thing especially if something like
769.52s: GameStop squeezes while I'm in doing
772.28s: this and I have short calls there is
774.84s: absolutely a potential for somebody
776.48s: that's being squeezed that has those
778.68s: calls to exercise them early that's the
780.92s: risk that I run and that's why I'm not
782.56s: trading it at a one:1 ratio I don't want
784.56s: to unwind the whole position I don't
786.12s: even want to unwind 2/3 but I want to
789.80s: make sure that I'm trading in and out of
791.80s: this thing so that we can generate as
793.64s: much money as we can based on where
795.40s: GameStop started the year which I'm
797.44s: going to track right here and we will
800.40s: see how we are able to
803.08s: progress so far the trade is performing
806.12s: really really well where on a return on
808.44s: an invested Capital standpoint meaning
810.76s: we're using this
813.08s: 168 for the basis it's returning really
816.08s: well we we're sitting on a total p&l of
818.56s: three grand on again a total allocation
822.72s: of now 25k was um 15K right before this
827.96s: so this really is is starting to
830.72s: progress pretty well and it's perfect
832.88s: for this kind of Market that we're
834.12s: seeing in gain stop really high V not
836.76s: massive price movements yet and and that
839.84s: is the game plan going forward so my
842.08s: hope is to continue sharing updates like
844.04s: this I hope it's useful and as I'm doing
846.32s: these if you have questions please ask
848.76s: it's the entire purpose of me doing this
850.72s: I already know what I'm doing I know how
852.20s: to do all this stuff it's what I do for
854.80s: a living so this is really to try and
858.36s: share some of the skill set of options
860.56s: trading with the GameStop Community just
862.68s: to give you more tools not saying this
864.08s: is the right way this again to be very
866.04s: clear is not exactly how I would trade
868.04s: this in a nutshell I have other things
870.56s: that I do in something like GameStop
872.60s: specifically volatility related for more
875.24s: directional plays using single options
877.00s: with kickers and stuff like that but
878.76s: those are different strategies this I
880.80s: chose for this series because it's based
884.72s: around a Buy and Hold position which I
889.00s: think most people that trade GameStop
891.24s: like to maintain something like that so
892.84s: I thought it was relevant if you have
894.64s: any questions let me know be an outlier
896.52s: I'll see you later
