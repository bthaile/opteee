0.00s: This Dramatic Technical Analysis Part Two,
2.68s: the first video walk through what my overall
5.24s: technical analysis methodology is,
7.50s: and then the specific tools that I use.
9.88s: This video is the next in line
12.24s: where I'm gonna walk you through the process.
14.76s: How do I bring all of these things together
17.40s: to create a comprehensive picture
19.00s: that allows me to better understand the market
21.96s: that I'm looking to trade?
23.08s: What's up everybody?
23.92s: Eric here, welcome back to all the alligers.
25.56s: And as usual, shout out to the Patreon family.
27.76s: You guys make content like this possible,
29.84s: and if what I do helps you consider signing up,
32.04s: it helps make better stuff for you guys.
34.16s: So with that, let's get into the process.
38.16s: There are two big things that I'm gonna be looking at.
40.92s: The very first thing on the left hand side over here,
43.12s: you can see the portfolio.
44.84s: My technical analysis, weird enough,
47.12s: always starts with looking at the portfolio.
48.96s: And this is gonna be for multiple reasons,
51.08s: but it's because I look at the portfolio first,
53.36s: and I need to understand one of two things.
55.92s: What is generating the origin of this trade?
59.88s: Is it that I look at the portfolio,
62.20s: and I realize that I need something?
65.04s: Sometimes we need to put on risk.
67.36s: You might look at the portfolio and say,
69.04s: wow, I don't have enough capital at use.
71.40s: I need to get some more out there.
72.68s: Or you might look at the portfolio and say,
74.32s: holy shit, my beta weighted spy deltas
76.92s: are so massive right now.
78.76s: Was that yodeling I just heard,
80.64s: or did you just say what I thought you said?
82.72s: I need to get some short deltas in there.
84.72s: The reason why this is so important is because
86.64s: if there's a need, it will shape what you're looking for,
90.28s: what analysis scans we're gonna put together
92.88s: to help us find what we need.
94.72s: Or it might be an opportunity.
97.32s: The opportunity is simple.
98.48s: It's when you look at something and you say,
100.48s: wow, that looks interesting to me for whatever reason.
103.80s: And a lot of times the analysis is just to help us understand
107.28s: what makes sense in terms of a position
110.72s: that fits the opportunity that we've come across.
113.72s: So whenever we're conducting our analysis,
117.00s: we're looking to answer a basic question.
120.20s: How do I think about this individual thing
122.48s: I'm looking at and what approach makes the most sense?
125.16s: Those two things, that's what I'm looking to answer.
127.80s: So my technical analysis is always gonna start
130.76s: with an orientation phase.
132.32s: And this is where I look at the big picture.
134.92s: Now, to be clear, if you were intraday scalping
137.88s: zero DTE options, the orientation
140.72s: will probably be very, very quick for you.
142.40s: It'll be something like, how's the stock market behaving?
144.88s: How are the indices behaving in a recent time span?
147.72s: And then that's about it.
148.56s: However, if you're generating a six month thesis,
151.12s: it's different.
151.96s: Things like the economy, the stock market,
154.04s: the individual indices and sectors all start
156.36s: to matter much more.
157.60s: So what am I looking for in the economy?
159.40s: Just what's the overall backdrop?
160.80s: I'm not here to give you an economics lesson,
162.72s: but for example, right now inflation is very high.
165.40s: I know that that has a negative impact
167.52s: on small cap growth stocks.
169.16s: I know that.
170.00s: That feeds into the way I'm looking at things.
173.00s: When I'm looking at the stock market,
174.44s: I just wanna know how are we trending?
176.48s: How are the different indices behaving against one another?
179.52s: What's our average volatility?
181.08s: How much are we moving per day per week per month?
183.56s: It gives me an idea on how things are currently behaving.
186.24s: And then the sectors.
187.32s: This is important because as I'm looking for, let's say,
190.88s: risk and I wanna put on a bullish trade
194.32s: and I want it to be in an individual stock.
196.84s: Let's say I know I wanna put on a ratio called diagonal,
200.20s: something like that.
201.04s: And I wanna put it on in an individual stock.
203.44s: What would you do?
204.48s: Let's say that this is gonna be three months trade.
207.28s: So let's say we look at the six month sector
210.20s: and you see utilities is down 11%.
212.64s: Remember, ratio called diagonal is bullish.
215.12s: So would you place a ratio called diagonal in utilities,
219.72s: which is down 11% on a six month,
222.16s: which is down 9% on a three month,
224.44s: which is down on a one month 7%,
228.48s: and in a five day period it's down 7.3%.
231.64s: If you're bullish, is that where you're gonna go?
234.20s: Me, to be clear, this does not mean
236.92s: that individual companies within the utilities can't do well.
239.84s: That's not what it means at all.
240.88s: Well, what it does mean is I'm looking at trades
243.64s: as you recall from the last video,
245.44s: I'm looking for a confluence of evidence.
247.40s: I'm not looking for things to be okay.
249.48s: I'm looking for things to be great.
251.52s: So if I'm bullish, I'm not gonna waste my time
253.68s: with the indices that are the sectors
255.44s: that are not doing well, not worth my time.
257.80s: I'm looking for as many things to be stacked
260.52s: in my favor of my thesis as possible.
262.92s: So I'm gonna be spending way more time up here
265.00s: in these indices.
266.20s: And then what I'm gonna do is actually come in
268.12s: and find the strength within the indices.
270.80s: And then I'm gonna find the strongest performers
273.12s: within the strongest sector, within the strongest subsector.
276.40s: That's how I'm structuring building
279.32s: a profitable probabilistic outcome.
281.64s: Now, a couple other things to know,
283.28s: when we're looking at indices and stock market in general,
285.92s: you can have the stock market writ large,
288.20s: not performing well and still have stocks doing well.
290.68s: But what I can tell you is that as soon as the stock market
293.60s: starts to turn up and gain some momentum,
295.92s: all of the stocks that wanted to perform well
298.24s: and might have been performing okay, they're gonna slingshot.
300.68s: And it's because of the overall movement of liquidity
303.80s: and a rising tide lifts all boats.
306.28s: So that's why I'm looking to stack the market
309.16s: that indices the sectors all in alignment
312.32s: if I'm looking for a specific thing to fill the portfolio.
315.76s: Next up, we have the trend and strength.
317.60s: This is where I'm gonna apply all of those tools
320.40s: that we reviewed in the last video.
322.88s: The way I'm thinking about this again
324.80s: is I'm gonna start with various time frames
326.96s: and analyze what I'm looking at.
328.76s: So to do that, let's take an example.
330.84s: As you all know, I like to trade IWM
333.12s: and I like to trade the coverage triangle.
334.60s: That's one of my go-to's.
336.00s: Yeah, no shit.
337.20s: So in this case, let's say I wanted to put on a coverage
339.88s: triangle in IWM is right now the correct time.
343.08s: Well, let's figure it out.
344.24s: First of all, the coverage triangle for those that don't know
346.60s: is a longer thesis trade.
348.12s: So it can be anything over a year,
349.92s: but a lot of times it'll have positions
351.64s: that are rotating in and out within a month,
353.64s: within two months for sure.
355.00s: So that's the backdrop.
356.40s: So as I look at something that's had this giant decline
359.36s: in recent time, am I bullish here?
361.64s: Now, to be clear, as I look at this,
363.64s: the first thing I'm thinking is,
364.92s: am I bullish long-term like over a year?
367.28s: Maybe, maybe not.
368.16s: That's a slightly different analysis.
369.80s: But if I wanted to start loading things up,
372.40s: do I think that this is the right time
374.12s: based on what I'm seeing in recent time?
375.68s: And my short answer is no.
377.20s: And there's a bunch of different reasons for it.
378.88s: The first one is, we made lower highs here,
382.32s: and we've been trending down,
384.20s: if I move this in from a six-month daily
386.28s: into this three-month daily, you can see.
388.32s: It's really struggling.
389.48s: This is why changing time frames
390.96s: is such an important part of this process
392.72s: because it changes our perspective.
394.32s: The other thing like you'll recall from the last video,
396.48s: the moving averages are almost completely inverted
398.92s: with the 50 just now crossing underneath
400.96s: the 200 day moving average.
402.40s: But the 21 is below the 50,
404.84s: and the nine is below them all with price below all of them.
407.24s: That's not good.
408.08s: The other thing I see here is that even if this starts to rally,
412.16s: it's running into a giant period of congestion.
415.52s: Wow, that really got zoomed in
417.36s: into a giant period of congestion right here.
419.92s: And this matters a lot because again,
421.92s: if you'll recall from the last video,
423.52s: the more recent price action is going to impact
426.52s: the current price far more simply from a transaction standpoint
430.20s: because a lot of people are transacting in that area
432.80s: and recently so.
434.20s: So this area starts to become interesting
436.84s: in terms of resistance.
438.20s: Now, let's say if I wanted to get long IWM,
440.72s: I could then chart the price and see, okay,
442.84s: well, I got from 177 up until 184,
447.04s: essentially before it starts to hit this congestion zone,
449.44s: is that worth it to me.
451.16s: And in this case, it would be no
452.68s: because I still see primary risks to the downside.
455.32s: The linear regression channels are all negative sloping.
457.60s: We see a lot of problems with this to the upside.
460.68s: Now, in the context of a much longer term position,
464.08s: what do I think?
464.92s: Well, if I was planning on holding this for over a year,
467.56s: this actually starts to look like a value zone to me.
470.16s: You can see how low we are in context
472.48s: and we can see that over the last year,
474.56s: it already has been up to nearly 200 from 177.
477.48s: That's a pretty sizable move for something of this price.
480.16s: Let's move back out to a two year daily.
482.16s: Again, if this is like a five year hypothesis,
485.12s: this does start to look more interesting
486.80s: because again, this looks like a value zone
489.36s: where we're actually starting to move
490.96s: in the correct direction because this is a lower low
493.72s: than a higher low than a slightly higher low, higher low,
497.48s: higher low.
498.32s: So each time that I'm seeing this higher low pop up,
501.04s: I become interested because it's obviously trending
503.64s: in the correct direction or long term timeframe.
505.64s: This is exactly why applying different time frames
508.20s: is so important.
509.16s: So you can use all of these different tools again,
512.16s: in line with whatever it is that you're looking to trade,
514.52s: but the whole idea is I'm going to start with an orientation.
517.32s: Then I'm going to get into trend and strength
519.08s: actually looking at the individual product
521.08s: and then from there I'm getting into precision.
523.00s: So from here what I'm talking about in terms of precision
525.84s: is what strategy fits the hypothesis I'm looking to trade.
529.48s: So again, going back to this.
531.32s: If I wanted to trade the covered strangle right now,
533.52s: this might be okay for a really long term trade
536.32s: but for a short term trade, it doesn't look good.
538.56s: So let's already telling me that
539.88s: whether I'm going to trade this or not,
541.96s: that's one question, but then if I were to choose a trade,
544.52s: I would definitely be trading something long term,
546.88s: not something super short term.
548.60s: So this allows me after I conduct this analysis
551.32s: to figure out what strategy I'm going to use.
553.12s: However, again, remember, sometimes I will come into this
556.08s: already knowing what strategy I want to put on
558.48s: and then filtering for that strategy.
560.56s: So the important part here is also understanding
562.68s: that individual strategy you have in your toolkit
565.08s: and what conditions benefit it, what hurts it
568.36s: and then finding things that fit that.
570.40s: Another couple of points here
571.60s: when we're talking about the precision hypothesis
573.92s: action targets.
574.84s: What this means is as IWM is moving around,
577.52s: if I come up with some sort of the hypothesis,
579.44s: actually let's look at a different hypothesis.
581.16s: This is a current example.
582.44s: I was recently talking about the VIX ratio call diagonal
585.76s: that I was establishing because of the contextual understanding
589.00s: that 12 VIX is very low and volatility also serves
592.80s: as a good hedge for the broader portfolio, Yada, Yada, Yada.
595.56s: Now, really important to note that different products behave
598.32s: differently with different analysis.
600.12s: For example, the VIX doesn't really follow
602.48s: stereotypical technical analysis.
604.32s: Same thing like if you're trading stuff around earnings,
607.12s: it typically is not going to follow your typical
609.20s: technical analysis.
610.36s: So different products can behave differently,
612.16s: but in this case, notice how when I was building
614.52s: the position, it was back when VIX was below 13.
617.56s: So my hypothesis was VIX is going to go up.
620.12s: I don't know when, but at some point in time.
622.16s: So I had a bullish thesis based on an opportunity.
625.88s: So then to figure out the right strategy to fit to that,
628.36s: I looked at my toolkit and I said,
629.92s: well, I don't really know when this is going to happen,
632.36s: but I have conviction that it would happen at least
634.88s: to see a increase in VIX over the next year.
637.84s: So that's how I established a ratio call diagonal
640.32s: using long dated options.
642.16s: What were my targets?
643.20s: How did I expect it to behave?
644.84s: I expected it to move around this range and then
648.04s: to have these upticks with pullbacks.
650.16s: Now, why does this all matter?
651.84s: Because if it starts behaving differently
653.56s: than I'm anticipating, I need to update my plan
656.36s: to fit what's actually happening in the landscape
658.76s: because I'm also going to base PNL targets off of the action,
662.68s: the expected action.
664.00s: So when I'm looking at this and I'm saying,
665.64s: what are my PNL targets?
667.04s: Well, for the lost side, that's pretty easy
669.92s: because VIX is so low and VIX rarely drops below 12 in general.
674.92s: So like if we go out super far, we go out five years daily,
678.12s: you can see VIX dropped below 12 back in 2019
682.28s: and it went down to 11.
683.56s: So immediately for me, I would look at this and say,
687.20s: okay, let me draw a spot here that makes sense
689.68s: for the way that this is behaving.
690.96s: I'm actually going to erase this one for now
693.00s: and I'll throw in this really long term one.
695.12s: And for me, if we trade down at this level,
697.84s: essentially sub 12, that tells me I'm wrong.
700.24s: So I'm setting up my loss, not on some random mass percentage,
704.60s: but this is a directional thesis.
706.72s: So I'm setting up my loss, my loss management,
709.72s: exactly using a directional thesis.
712.92s: So the way I would treat this is perhaps this 1298,
716.40s: this 13 handle becomes my initial stop, my mental stop.
719.64s: And then if we get down to 1191,
721.96s: that tells me it's time to get out. I'm wrong.
723.68s: Now for the upside, if I look at, again,
726.12s: this is over a year long trade,
728.20s: and if I look at where we hit kind of like the mid 20s,
731.16s: where there was a decent amount of volume contracting here
733.88s: and we hit a high of 35, I can pick where I think I want to get out
737.64s: at based on a probabilistic range
739.92s: based on the duration of my trade.
741.52s: So in this case, maybe something around 25 makes sense.
744.40s: A lot of the chart was trading above that level.
746.76s: So I'm waiting for some sort of pop and volatility
749.04s: that gets me to that timeframe
750.28s: or that gets me to that target within that timeframe.
753.52s: The other thing is I use the charts in my analysis
757.44s: to help me identify various red flags.
761.08s: So what that means is if I think that this is supposed
764.12s: to get up to 25 and we consolidate here at 18 for a long time,
768.08s: the broader market news starts looking positive,
770.48s: yada, yada, yada.
771.56s: And I have two months left in the trade.
773.80s: That starts to become a red flag
775.28s: because my thesis isn't happening in the correct time frame
777.84s: and I'm up on a decision cycle.
779.44s: Do I take the trade down at a decent profit
781.76s: given the time that's left?
782.96s: Or should I leave it on and try to attempt
784.92s: to play out the whole hypothesis?
786.52s: You take the blue pill, the story ends,
789.48s: you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
792.60s: You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland
795.44s: and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
798.12s: All of this is predetermined before entering the trade.
801.36s: Now I want to talk to you about some best practices.
804.36s: The very first few things, less is more,
807.00s: this simply means that you don't need to have a million indicators.
810.60s: If you remember from the first video,
812.16s: I do have several indicators,
813.52s: but a lot of them are versions of the same thing.
815.56s: And the other thing is they look at very specific things.
818.72s: I don't have a lot of duplicates of the same thing.
820.68s: It doesn't help me.
821.56s: So simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication.
825.44s: It's a great quote and it's something
826.72s: to integrate into your technical analysis.
828.60s: There is no magic.
829.44s: This simply means there is no technical indicator
832.40s: that leads to success by itself.
834.16s: Massive point to get out upfront,
836.48s: simply because so many people waste
838.96s: so much time looking for this.
840.52s: It doesn't exist.
841.36s: I'll tell you right now.
842.20s: I've spent thousands of hours studying technical analysis
845.04s: indicators and fundamental analysis indicators.
847.20s: There's nothing out there.
848.08s: So find the things that align with what you're trying to do,
850.96s: track them closely, which is the third point,
853.44s: to evaluate what works, what doesn't work
855.84s: and what has the most efficacy for what you're doing.
858.16s: Next three things.
859.68s: When I'm using technical analysis,
861.24s: I'm not using it as predictive inputs.
863.40s: I'm literally using it to help me understand
865.24s: probabilistic outcomes.
866.40s: Using that previous example,
867.56s: we were just looking at with the VIX.
869.12s: It is more probable for the VIX to rise above my entry point
873.12s: than to rise below my stop loss.
875.76s: I can visualize that probabilistically,
878.00s: not only using just the technical analysis
880.08s: I've done based on recent price transactions,
881.92s: but I can also use options and the implied volatility
885.28s: to help me to understand ranges.
886.84s: The other thing product quirks,
888.16s: I kind of talked to you about that,
889.48s: but understanding that different rules apply
891.36s: in different times.
892.32s: So again, volatility products behave very differently
894.68s: than everything else.
895.52s: Things around a catalyst.
896.76s: So things around earnings,
898.40s: things around different approvals,
900.92s: if you're in biotech,
902.36s: things where there's giant news that comes out,
905.04s: that's an injection of brand new information
907.12s: like CEO was committing fraud for a decade.
909.80s: All of those things will have huge impacts on whatever you're using,
912.48s: and it's going to violate whatever typical technical analysis
915.20s: you would attempt to apply.
916.32s: And that leads into exactly this idea of catalyst.
918.64s: And then the last grouping right here is guardrails and scaling.
922.76s: So I use technical analysis again to set my P&L targets,
926.68s: and then also to help me understand
928.16s: when should I be scaling into or out of different products
931.36s: either for profits or losses.
932.96s: The other two things I want to talk about
934.80s: is P&L validation and waiting.
937.04s: P&L validation is essentially,
939.44s: when we look at whatever we think,
941.76s: our tolerable max losses,
944.00s: or what we think our probable max profit is,
946.72s: and to make sure it makes sense against the chart.
949.24s: So for example, if we look at the VIX,
951.60s: and let's say that the max loss
953.24s: for a position I have on right now at 12 down here,
956.96s: let's say the max loss would be $100,000.
959.68s: If I look at that and I say,
961.24s: well, there's a pretty fair probability
962.92s: that we hit 12 to the downside,
964.88s: but I'm super not comfortable with that loss.
967.68s: That tells me that there's a discrepancy with my P&L
971.16s: based off of the probabilistic outcomes of the chart.
973.76s: You have to rectify those.
975.04s: And the last thing is waiting.
976.44s: Depending on what you're trading,
978.04s: it makes a lot of sense to wait different indicators differently.
981.84s: And I talked about this in the first video,
983.48s: but if you are trading intraday zero DTE stuff,
986.96s: the one your chart doesn't matter to you.
988.56s: However, if you're trading one year stuff,
990.60s: the zero DTE chart doesn't matter to you.
992.56s: So you have to figure out what it is
994.00s: that you're actually trying to trade
995.44s: and then use the tools that correspond with that timeframe.
997.76s: So if you have any questions,
999.80s: comments, concerns, anything that I left out
1002.24s: or anything that you've really liked,
1003.92s: throw it in the comments below so that I know
1006.20s: and I love chatting with you guys.
1007.48s: It gives me an opportunity to connect with you all.
1009.40s: As always, don't forget to be an outlier,
1011.36s: like, subscribe, share, be an outlier.
1013.68s: See y'all later.
