 This Dramatic Technical Analysis Part Two, the first video walk through what my overall technical analysis methodology is, and then the specific tools that I use. This video is the next in line where I'm gonna walk you through the process. How do I bring all of these things together to create a comprehensive picture that allows me to better understand the market that I'm looking to trade? What's up everybody? Eric here, welcome back to all the alligers. And as usual, shout out to the Patreon family. You guys make content like this possible, and if what I do helps you consider signing up, it helps make better stuff for you guys. So with that, let's get into the process. There are two big things that I'm gonna be looking at. The very first thing on the left hand side over here, you can see the portfolio. My technical analysis, weird enough, always starts with looking at the portfolio. And this is gonna be for multiple reasons, but it's because I look at the portfolio first, and I need to understand one of two things. What is generating the origin of this trade? Is it that I look at the portfolio, and I realize that I need something? Sometimes we need to put on risk. You might look at the portfolio and say, wow, I don't have enough capital at use. I need to get some more out there. Or you might look at the portfolio and say, holy shit, my beta weighted spy deltas are so massive right now. Was that yodeling I just heard, or did you just say what I thought you said? I need to get some short deltas in there. The reason why this is so important is because if there's a need, it will shape what you're looking for, what analysis scans we're gonna put together to help us find what we need. Or it might be an opportunity. The opportunity is simple. It's when you look at something and you say, wow, that looks interesting to me for whatever reason. And a lot of times the analysis is just to help us understand what makes sense in terms of a position that fits the opportunity that we've come across. So whenever we're conducting our analysis, we're looking to answer a basic question. How do I think about this individual thing I'm looking at and what approach makes the most sense? Those two things, that's what I'm looking to answer. So my technical analysis is always gonna start with an orientation phase. And this is where I look at the big picture. Now, to be clear, if you were intraday scalping zero DTE options, the orientation will probably be very, very quick for you. It'll be something like, how's the stock market behaving? How are the indices behaving in a recent time span? And then that's about it. However, if you're generating a six month thesis, it's different. Things like the economy, the stock market, the individual indices and sectors all start to matter much more. So what am I looking for in the economy? Just what's the overall backdrop? I'm not here to give you an economics lesson, but for example, right now inflation is very high. I know that that has a negative impact on small cap growth stocks. I know that. That feeds into the way I'm looking at things. When I'm looking at the stock market, I just wanna know how are we trending? How are the different indices behaving against one another? What's our average volatility? How much are we moving per day per week per month? It gives me an idea on how things are currently behaving. And then the sectors. This is important because as I'm looking for, let's say, risk and I wanna put on a bullish trade and I want it to be in an individual stock. Let's say I know I wanna put on a ratio called diagonal, something like that. And I wanna put it on in an individual stock. What would you do? Let's say that this is gonna be three months trade. So let's say we look at the six month sector and you see utilities is down 11%. Remember, ratio called diagonal is bullish. So would you place a ratio called diagonal in utilities, which is down 11% on a six month, which is down 9% on a three month, which is down on a one month 7%, and in a five day period it's down 7.3%. If you're bullish, is that where you're gonna go? Me, to be clear, this does not mean that individual companies within the utilities can't do well. That's not what it means at all. Well, what it does mean is I'm looking at trades as you recall from the last video, I'm looking for a confluence of evidence. I'm not looking for things to be okay. I'm looking for things to be great. So if I'm bullish, I'm not gonna waste my time with the indices that are the sectors that are not doing well, not worth my time. I'm looking for as many things to be stacked in my favor of my thesis as possible. So I'm gonna be spending way more time up here in these indices. And then what I'm gonna do is actually come in and find the strength within the indices. And then I'm gonna find the strongest performers within the strongest sector, within the strongest subsector. That's how I'm structuring building a profitable probabilistic outcome. Now, a couple other things to know, when we're looking at indices and stock market in general, you can have the stock market writ large, not performing well and still have stocks doing well. But what I can tell you is that as soon as the stock market starts to turn up and gain some momentum, all of the stocks that wanted to perform well and might have been performing okay, they're gonna slingshot. And it's because of the overall movement of liquidity and a rising tide lifts all boats. So that's why I'm looking to stack the market that indices the sectors all in alignment if I'm looking for a specific thing to fill the portfolio. Next up, we have the trend and strength. This is where I'm gonna apply all of those tools that we reviewed in the last video. The way I'm thinking about this again is I'm gonna start with various time frames and analyze what I'm looking at. So to do that, let's take an example. As you all know, I like to trade IWM and I like to trade the coverage triangle. That's one of my go-to's. Yeah, no shit. So in this case, let's say I wanted to put on a coverage triangle in IWM is right now the correct time. Well, let's figure it out. First of all, the coverage triangle for those that don't know is a longer thesis trade. So it can be anything over a year, but a lot of times it'll have positions that are rotating in and out within a month, within two months for sure. So that's the backdrop. So as I look at something that's had this giant decline in recent time, am I bullish here? Now, to be clear, as I look at this, the first thing I'm thinking is, am I bullish long-term like over a year? Maybe, maybe not. That's a slightly different analysis. But if I wanted to start loading things up, do I think that this is the right time based on what I'm seeing in recent time? And my short answer is no. And there's a bunch of different reasons for it. The first one is, we made lower highs here, and we've been trending down, if I move this in from a six-month daily into this three-month daily, you can see. It's really struggling. This is why changing time frames is such an important part of this process because it changes our perspective. The other thing like you'll recall from the last video, the moving averages are almost completely inverted with the 50 just now crossing underneath the 200 day moving average. But the 21 is below the 50, and the nine is below them all with price below all of them. That's not good. The other thing I see here is that even if this starts to rally, it's running into a giant period of congestion. Wow, that really got zoomed in into a giant period of congestion right here. And this matters a lot because again, if you'll recall from the last video, the more recent price action is going to impact the current price far more simply from a transaction standpoint because a lot of people are transacting in that area and recently so. So this area starts to become interesting in terms of resistance. Now, let's say if I wanted to get long IWM, I could then chart the price and see, okay, well, I got from 177 up until 184, essentially before it starts to hit this congestion zone, is that worth it to me. And in this case, it would be no because I still see primary risks to the downside. The linear regression channels are all negative sloping. We see a lot of problems with this to the upside. Now, in the context of a much longer term position, what do I think? Well, if I was planning on holding this for over a year, this actually starts to look like a value zone to me. You can see how low we are in context and we can see that over the last year, it already has been up to nearly 200 from 177. That's a pretty sizable move for something of this price. Let's move back out to a two year daily. Again, if this is like a five year hypothesis, this does start to look more interesting because again, this looks like a value zone where we're actually starting to move in the correct direction because this is a lower low than a higher low than a slightly higher low, higher low, higher low. So each time that I'm seeing this higher low pop up, I become interested because it's obviously trending in the correct direction or long term timeframe. This is exactly why applying different time frames is so important. So you can use all of these different tools again, in line with whatever it is that you're looking to trade, but the whole idea is I'm going to start with an orientation. Then I'm going to get into trend and strength actually looking at the individual product and then from there I'm getting into precision. So from here what I'm talking about in terms of precision is what strategy fits the hypothesis I'm looking to trade. So again, going back to this. If I wanted to trade the covered strangle right now, this might be okay for a really long term trade but for a short term trade, it doesn't look good. So let's already telling me that whether I'm going to trade this or not, that's one question, but then if I were to choose a trade, I would definitely be trading something long term, not something super short term. So this allows me after I conduct this analysis to figure out what strategy I'm going to use. However, again, remember, sometimes I will come into this already knowing what strategy I want to put on and then filtering for that strategy. So the important part here is also understanding that individual strategy you have in your toolkit and what conditions benefit it, what hurts it and then finding things that fit that. Another couple of points here when we're talking about the precision hypothesis action targets. What this means is as IWM is moving around, if I come up with some sort of the hypothesis, actually let's look at a different hypothesis. This is a current example. I was recently talking about the VIX ratio call diagonal that I was establishing because of the contextual understanding that 12 VIX is very low and volatility also serves as a good hedge for the broader portfolio, Yada, Yada, Yada. Now, really important to note that different products behave differently with different analysis. For example, the VIX doesn't really follow stereotypical technical analysis. Same thing like if you're trading stuff around earnings, it typically is not going to follow your typical technical analysis. So different products can behave differently, but in this case, notice how when I was building the position, it was back when VIX was below 13. So my hypothesis was VIX is going to go up. I don't know when, but at some point in time. So I had a bullish thesis based on an opportunity. So then to figure out the right strategy to fit to that, I looked at my toolkit and I said, well, I don't really know when this is going to happen, but I have conviction that it would happen at least to see a increase in VIX over the next year. So that's how I established a ratio call diagonal using long dated options. What were my targets? How did I expect it to behave? I expected it to move around this range and then to have these upticks with pullbacks. Now, why does this all matter? Because if it starts behaving differently than I'm anticipating, I need to update my plan to fit what's actually happening in the landscape because I'm also going to base PNL targets off of the action, the expected action. So when I'm looking at this and I'm saying, what are my PNL targets? Well, for the lost side, that's pretty easy because VIX is so low and VIX rarely drops below 12 in general. So like if we go out super far, we go out five years daily, you can see VIX dropped below 12 back in 2019 and it went down to 11. So immediately for me, I would look at this and say, okay, let me draw a spot here that makes sense for the way that this is behaving. I'm actually going to erase this one for now and I'll throw in this really long term one. And for me, if we trade down at this level, essentially sub 12, that tells me I'm wrong. So I'm setting up my loss, not on some random mass percentage, but this is a directional thesis. So I'm setting up my loss, my loss management, exactly using a directional thesis. So the way I would treat this is perhaps this 1298, this 13 handle becomes my initial stop, my mental stop. And then if we get down to 1191, that tells me it's time to get out. I'm wrong. Now for the upside, if I look at, again, this is over a year long trade, and if I look at where we hit kind of like the mid 20s, where there was a decent amount of volume contracting here and we hit a high of 35, I can pick where I think I want to get out at based on a probabilistic range based on the duration of my trade. So in this case, maybe something around 25 makes sense. A lot of the chart was trading above that level. So I'm waiting for some sort of pop and volatility that gets me to that timeframe or that gets me to that target within that timeframe. The other thing is I use the charts in my analysis to help me identify various red flags. So what that means is if I think that this is supposed to get up to 25 and we consolidate here at 18 for a long time, the broader market news starts looking positive, yada, yada, yada. And I have two months left in the trade. That starts to become a red flag because my thesis isn't happening in the correct time frame and I'm up on a decision cycle. Do I take the trade down at a decent profit given the time that's left? Or should I leave it on and try to attempt to play out the whole hypothesis? You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. All of this is predetermined before entering the trade. Now I want to talk to you about some best practices. The very first few things, less is more, this simply means that you don't need to have a million indicators. If you remember from the first video, I do have several indicators, but a lot of them are versions of the same thing. And the other thing is they look at very specific things. I don't have a lot of duplicates of the same thing. It doesn't help me. So simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication. It's a great quote and it's something to integrate into your technical analysis. There is no magic. This simply means there is no technical indicator that leads to success by itself. Massive point to get out upfront, simply because so many people waste so much time looking for this. It doesn't exist. I'll tell you right now. I've spent thousands of hours studying technical analysis indicators and fundamental analysis indicators. There's nothing out there. So find the things that align with what you're trying to do, track them closely, which is the third point, to evaluate what works, what doesn't work and what has the most efficacy for what you're doing. Next three things. When I'm using technical analysis, I'm not using it as predictive inputs. I'm literally using it to help me understand probabilistic outcomes. Using that previous example, we were just looking at with the VIX. It is more probable for the VIX to rise above my entry point than to rise below my stop loss. I can visualize that probabilistically, not only using just the technical analysis I've done based on recent price transactions, but I can also use options and the implied volatility to help me to understand ranges. The other thing product quirks, I kind of talked to you about that, but understanding that different rules apply in different times. So again, volatility products behave very differently than everything else. Things around a catalyst. So things around earnings, things around different approvals, if you're in biotech, things where there's giant news that comes out, that's an injection of brand new information like CEO was committing fraud for a decade. All of those things will have huge impacts on whatever you're using, and it's going to violate whatever typical technical analysis you would attempt to apply. And that leads into exactly this idea of catalyst. And then the last grouping right here is guardrails and scaling. So I use technical analysis again to set my P&L targets, and then also to help me understand when should I be scaling into or out of different products either for profits or losses. The other two things I want to talk about is P&L validation and waiting. P&L validation is essentially, when we look at whatever we think, our tolerable max losses, or what we think our probable max profit is, and to make sure it makes sense against the chart. So for example, if we look at the VIX, and let's say that the max loss for a position I have on right now at 12 down here, let's say the max loss would be $100,000. If I look at that and I say, well, there's a pretty fair probability that we hit 12 to the downside, but I'm super not comfortable with that loss. That tells me that there's a discrepancy with my P&L based off of the probabilistic outcomes of the chart. You have to rectify those. And the last thing is waiting. Depending on what you're trading, it makes a lot of sense to wait different indicators differently. And I talked about this in the first video, but if you are trading intraday zero DTE stuff, the one your chart doesn't matter to you. However, if you're trading one year stuff, the zero DTE chart doesn't matter to you. So you have to figure out what it is that you're actually trying to trade and then use the tools that correspond with that timeframe. So if you have any questions, comments, concerns, anything that I left out or anything that you've really liked, throw it in the comments below so that I know and I love chatting with you guys. It gives me an opportunity to connect with you all. As always, don't forget to be an outlier, like, subscribe, share, be an outlier. See y'all later.
