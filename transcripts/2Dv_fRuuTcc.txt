0.00s: What's up everybody? I'm going to explain to you exactly how I go about selecting what option strategy
6.04s: I'm going to apply when and it's because one of the biggest changes I made to my trading
11.52s: It was revolutionary was not attempting to always trade one or two strategies because the market doesn't care about
19.80s: What strategy you like the market is going to do whatever the market is going to do so it's on us as traders to develop a toolkit that
27.68s: Allows us to take advantage of the current market condition
31.24s: So I'm going to walk you through how I build this process to determine what option strategy I want to use at the end of the video
37.52s: I'm going to walk you through exactly what option strategies I use in various market conditions to give you some ideas to start with
44.72s: So what's up everybody Eric here? Welcome back to all of the outliers a huge shout out to the patreon family and the YouTube members
50.80s: Thank you guys for the support you make videos like this possible and with that let's get right into the detail
56.20s: So the very first thing you'll notice here is process driven this is by design most of what I do has a process
61.76s: Involved and it's because it allows me to be more efficient and I reduce the variance
66.60s: What do I mean by reduce the variance?
68.44s: Well, it lets me identify what works in what market conditions because sometimes if you buy stock in scenario a and then
76.46s: scenario a pops up again and then you buy an out of the money call and then scenario a pops up again and then you buy a
81.76s: Deep in the money call and then scenario a pops again and then you sell a putt if you don't figure out which one of those works
87.76s: Best in scenario a we're wasting a lot of time
90.48s: So the idea here is to figure out what works in what market conditions against your preferences as a trader and then
96.64s: Cautify how we get there so for me personally there are two scenarios that I start with and what I mean by this is when I am
105.04s: Starting for a trade. This is the first scenario or folio driven
109.04s: What I mean by this is as I'm reviewing my portfolio
113.52s: I'm seeing what I need and this is what I'm reviewing I have a video that goes through portfolio management in depth
120.08s: So I'm not going to go through all of these here
121.92s: But these are some of the things that I take a look at so I'm going to look at the portfolio and I'm going to see
126.80s: Do I need risk? Do I have too much risk? Do I have too much directional risk?
131.60s: But not enough total risk
133.36s: I'm going to review the entire portfolio and then look at the end result to see what do I need to change here
139.28s: And if it's nothing the other scenario that exists is an opportunity driven trade
145.28s: So the difference between these two is when I look at the portfolio and then I identify that I need something
151.28s: I'm already specific to what I'm looking for so what I mean by that is if I look at the portfolio and I realize ah
158.24s: I need more long deltas
160.40s: Well that immediately starts to narrow down what strategies are going to give me long deltas same thing with my gamma risk
167.52s: My vagarisk all of those sorts of things when we're looking at an opportunity
172.08s: This is typically going to be tied to some sort of event for me
176.08s: So FOMC meetings that's an opportunity. There's already a certain subset of strategies that fit that opportunity
182.96s: So how do we figure out once we identify?
185.76s: Okay, I'm looking for something based on a portfolio review or something that's opportunity driven
190.72s: How do we pick what strategy to use? Well, it's simple for me the first thing I'm going to do is define the hypothesis
196.56s: And then contextualize the hypothesis which I'll get into in a minute and then we're going to fit a strategy to it a lot of times
202.24s: one or two strategies may actually work for a specific trade and that's totally cool
208.24s: But in this scenario, I want to walk you through first the strategies and then how I fit them to the specific opportunities
214.80s: So over here you get to see in general. This is most of what I'm going to do
219.92s: This isn't only exhaustive, but this is most of it
223.20s: So for bullish trades, I'm going to be doing the coverage strangle
226.32s: This is kind of a specific strategy that I almost always have exposure on in as for a whole bunch of reasons
233.52s: I'm not going to go into in this video
234.64s: You can check out my playlist on the coverage strangle
237.04s: I'll throw that in the notes below but almost always have this trade on so it's almost
241.60s: It's definitely bullish strategy, but I don't consider it as part of this because I have a specific ticker
245.92s: I'm going to run in this and it's kind of off by itself now for other
249.52s: Dispositions though where let's say I'm looking at Apple and I think Apple is going to go up
254.56s: I'm typically not going to trade the coverage strangle in there
256.72s: I'm going to look at some of these other ideas like a long call a short put a ratio call diagonal
262.08s: Which I actually have one on right now in Apple for that exact reason for long stock
266.56s: And I throw this in here because it's good for options
269.44s: Traders to know that you can still always buy stock. It's not going to hurt anything for bearish trades
274.64s: It's essentially the inverse of most of these short call long put ratio put diagonal
279.04s: That's pretty much it and notice how I don't do short stock typically
282.16s: And it's just because it costs money to hold it and in general
285.28s: I can get the risk profile that I want via long puts or ratio put diagonals
289.84s: And then there's kind of this third bucket notice how I don't put neutral
293.20s: If I don't feel like rice is going to go up or down
296.24s: That's really kind of a bad reason to place a neutral trade when we're talking about neutral trades really what I'm focusing in on is volatility
302.80s: Do I have an opinion on volatility?
305.20s: So if I'm bullish in volatility meaning I think volatility is going to expand specifically relative to historic volatility
312.48s: I might buy a straddle if I think volatility is overstated like I very typically do doing FOMC meetings when big daddy j
318.80s: Pows out there slam and the hammer down on everybody then in those scenarios
322.64s: I'm probably just going to short a straddle
324.32s: Now the other thing to notice here though is that there are kind of these two words ratio and skew
329.68s: Sometimes I have a primary volatility disposition
333.84s: But a slight or secondary directional disposition
337.92s: So sometimes I'll skew these a little bit for the straddle
340.48s: Maybe I'll sell two calls against the one putt still a straddle
343.92s: But I'm adding more likes to it and skewing the risk profile in a certain direction
348.24s: For a strangle if I'm more bullish than bearish
351.12s: Maybe I'll scoot up the delta on the short putt all of this gets into the details on the strategy execution
357.28s: Themselves but the point here is that they're very different and it allows me to then capitalize on various market conditions
363.12s: So now this ultimately begs the question how do I pick if I'm bullish in apple
368.48s: Why do I land on a ratio call diagonal versus long stock or short putt or long call and it comes down to an analysis of
376.24s: These items I'm going to take a look at do I want defined or undefined risk that is an important first threshold
383.04s: Because if I want defined risk then I'm going to be immediately looking at things like ratio call diagonals
389.76s: Long calls the coverage strangle those were defined risk
392.64s: So by adding this filter I immediately start to narrow down my choices
396.96s: Then if I have a preference for defined or undefined profit that also does the same exact thing
402.32s: Now you might be thinking why would somebody want specifically defined or undefined profit
406.48s: Well, it's because it's not just the profit the other side of this profit scenario is the probabilities
412.08s: So when I'm talking about undefined risk undefined profit baked into both of these together is really the probabilistic outcome
419.20s: So those aside then I get into my other criteria like the duration what's the duration of my hypothesis
426.16s: So for example if I'm trading the f1c meeting
428.72s: I don't have any sort of super long term duration on volatility in those scenarios
433.20s: I'm specifically trading the release itself same thing for earnings plays
436.40s: I'm trading the volatility around the earnings play
438.48s: So I don't really care as much about super long term trades
442.24s: So again, this is naturally going to start narrowing down my choices
446.16s: So for example, I'm not going to trade any sort of these ratio diagonals
450.32s: If I have a one day or two day or one week hypothesis
453.52s: I'm going to trade something else
455.28s: So what I'm showing you is as I'm stitching together these various preferences
460.00s: I'm naturally backing in to only a couple strategies
463.44s: So the same thing for volatility what's my volatility disposition?
466.56s: Do I think volatility is expensive? Do I think it's cheap?
468.96s: Do I think it's transitionary?
471.04s: Do I think we're going between volatility clusters?
473.68s: That is also going to naturally determine where I'm going to go in terms of strategy
477.52s: Then also theta do I want to be longer short theta?
480.64s: Again, that inherently will knock off a bunch of these trades
483.44s: If I want to be collecting theta then I'm going to be looking at selling strategies
487.76s: If I want to be long gamma I'm going to be looking at buying strategies
491.68s: If I look at my portfolio and my deltas are too high
495.44s: Now I'm looking for short deltas
497.04s: There are different ways you can gain short deltas
499.28s: You can either sell deltas in something that is positively correlated with your product
504.64s: Or you can buy inversely correlated deltas
508.00s: So there's a lot of different ways you can structure these trades
510.64s: But the point being is once you outline the trades you trade
514.24s: The circumstances that these belong to
516.64s: And then you qualify with what your hypothesis is
520.40s: And fit that around these other criteria
523.28s: You're naturally going to back into whatever trade that you're looking for
528.56s: Because it's naturally going to limit down different choices
531.76s: So overall you don't have to make this a super complex strategy
535.60s: It doesn't have to be exhaustive
537.20s: But once you have a decent idea of the criteria that you're looking for
540.64s: Then you are going to be selecting what fits that disposition
544.32s: So if you have any questions let me know
