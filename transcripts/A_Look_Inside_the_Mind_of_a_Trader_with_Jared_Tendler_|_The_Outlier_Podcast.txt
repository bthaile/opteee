2.28s: what's up everyone welcome back to the
4.40s: outlier podcast I have Jared here today
7.36s: to essentially let everybody know how
9.92s: messed up we all are in the head I'm
11.72s: sure he you have no shortage of insights
14.80s: into that side of the world but before
16.72s: we get into talking about the psychology
19.24s: of trading kind of the correlations that
21.56s: you found between different things like
24.00s: I see golf clubs I know that there's
25.96s: some betting side of the stuff trading
28.00s: side a lot of different ways to to talk
30.40s: about like the mindset in the human
31.76s: psyche which interestingly enough
34.20s: Marines we're not really the smartest
37.12s: group around but we actually are pretty
39.20s: introspective we like to spend a lot of
40.76s: time understanding what makes us tick so
43.28s: I'm actually really really eager to to
44.96s: chat with you so first thanks for coming
46.44s: to hang out for a little bit yeah happy
48.00s: to be here man good to chat about this
50.52s: stuff I know it's important for a lot of
51.68s: people that sometimes don't always have
53.64s: a framework to uh uh understand it well
56.60s: we'll say well and that's actually a
59.12s: great starting point to be honest
60.48s: because before we get into your
61.84s: background um we'll just kind of Jump
63.68s: Right In one of the things I find so
65.28s: interesting is for newer Traders when
68.36s: you hear people talk about like trading
69.80s: psychology it sounds like the hogwash it
72.72s: sounds like just this random stuff
74.56s: that's in The Ether around the world of
77.04s: trading and then once you trade for a
79.04s: while you realize like at least in my
81.44s: opinion there's no amount of psychology
85.56s: that will inherently create Edge you
87.84s: have to have some sort of system that is
89.60s: profit
90.44s: but you could have a very profitable
92.36s: system and if you don't have the correct
94.20s: psychological Constitution to execute it
97.20s: good is it so I actually wanted to talk
100.40s: to you about that what comes first the
102.40s: chicken or the egg The Edge or the
104.60s: psychology The Edge 100% I mean like
109.36s: military training I mean I know it
112.28s: offhand not directly uh you know they're
115.52s: training you to uh thrive in situations
118.84s: where you might die and so the standard
121.52s: for that training is really really high
124.60s: so that your emotions are not going to
126.84s: do something that's going to get you
128.04s: killed but I'm sure you know there's
131.16s: plenty of situations where that's not
133.24s: feasible and somebody gets you know
135.64s: injured and and SO trading is is no
138.80s: different like the training though often
141.72s: happens in the live market there isn't
144.12s: really a good simulator that can
145.92s: actually help to inoculate you to that
148.60s: environment so you know early on Traders
151.24s: are just kind of feeling their way
152.32s: around meanwhile there's just a a huge
154.56s: swings in their emotions but those huge
157.00s: swings in emotions you know I think are
159.60s: largely to do with the fact that they
160.96s: have no idea what they're doing you know
163.16s: and and and so you really need to have a
166.68s: a very robust strategy it does not have
169.92s: to be wildly profitable yet but you have
172.96s: to have something that you can kind of
175.16s: anchor yourself to in order to then be
177.40s: able to tease out like where are my
179.44s: emotion
180.76s: actually affecting my execution CU When
183.36s: you are too new and don't have that then
186.92s: it's easy to get sort of swept up in the
189.32s: frustration from losing but like that
191.44s: frustration might be because you don't
193.72s: know what the f you're
195.12s: doing and and the fear might be because
198.48s: you don't know what the f you're doing
200.12s: and so you know to to not have a lot of
202.72s: confidence in is correct to get
205.24s: overconfident and think you know what
206.76s: you're doing is going to be really
208.56s: really damaging so you know the humility
211.52s: to be able to
212.72s: say I I need to establish a clear
216.76s: understanding of what I'm doing
218.20s: technically strategically first uh is
221.44s: really really important there's
222.40s: definitely people in this space who say
225.28s: that trading is all about psychology and
227.76s: they are absolutely full of [ __ ] right
231.12s: you know there's no amount of tactics
233.00s: that that um can be rep there's no
235.52s: amount of mentality that can be replaced
237.20s: from uh poor t poor tactics I I mean I I
241.00s: the mentality the mental game can only
243.24s: help to bring out you know what you know
246.24s: it can't uh create it what a what a
249.88s: great way to frame it and you mentioned
251.52s: another thing there to dovetail off of
253.20s: it slightly and you mentioned like this
254.76s: you know level of like overconfidence at
256.60s: some point I've I've always been really
259.44s: interested in just research I just enjoy
263.76s: reading different kind of stuff you can
265.12s: find off of ssrn there's a great paper
267.60s: that's called the behavior of individual
269.16s: investors anybody that's familiar with
271.04s: my work will know I've cited that a
272.48s: million times because I think everybody
273.56s: should read it one of the things they
274.72s: talk about in there is the Dunning
277.68s: Krueger effect and I'm sure you're
280.20s: familiar with that when there's this
283.80s: really interesting thing though where I
285.88s: feel like people can be familiar with
287.84s: the Dunning Krueger effect but I don't
290.76s: think familiarity with it stops people
293.36s: from still falling over that same Edge
296.64s: do you think that there's some method
299.08s: for Trad
300.76s: that and for those unfamiliar well maybe
302.24s: you could talk a little about the dun
303.12s: and Krueger effect first in your lens
304.84s: and then we can move on to the second
306.16s: part yeah so dun and Krueger effect has
309.04s: two sides you know one is that you don't
312.24s: even know what you don't know and so as
314.56s: a result you become you know
317.00s: overconfident and you know I would
319.88s: classify these people in the uh uh
325.12s: American Idol contestants who like have
328.40s: no con con cep of like what you know
331.68s: Elite level singing looks like and so
334.28s: they've kind of been in this like bubble
336.44s: they've gotten all this sort of positive
338.20s: feedback um because people you know need
341.12s: to get positive feedback and need to
342.72s: have that belief and all those
344.64s: affirmations y y yada well they're you
346.80s: know delusional they they they do not
349.88s: have the skill to be able to properly
352.76s: determine where they rank and so they
355.16s: naturally become overconfident and
357.56s: interestingly enough there's also a lot
358.84s: of research that describes how prevalent
361.20s: overconfidence is in Western society and
363.88s: I don't mean that it's not doesn't exist
365.32s: in uh in eastern cultures as well it
367.44s: just it's been researched more here and
370.16s: and so you know around 70% of people um
374.36s: rate themselves as having above average
376.76s: intelligence above average sense of
378.68s: humor level of attractiveness so you
382.20s: know and and that doesn't uh account for
385.60s: the people who are on the other side of
387.20s: the Dunning Kruger effect which is those
389.12s: who are undervaluing what they bring to
390.92s: the table so it might not be 20% of
393.48s: people are overconfident it might be
394.64s: even higher than that so uh yeah the
397.92s: other side of the joh ker fact is people
399.32s: who have a ton of skill who uh end up
402.96s: having lower confidence because they
404.84s: falsely assume that everybody else knows
406.72s: what they know and what they have is
408.28s: just not that worthwhile so what this
410.04s: really helps to show us is that
411.76s: confidence is not causal right being
414.28s: confident for the sake of being
416.00s: confident you know could actually be
417.72s: quite dangerous because I have clients
420.12s: who you know are new and they
422.80s: objectively have more confidence than
425.44s: some of my other clients who've been
426.76s: doing this for 30 years and it that
429.52s: should not be I mean there's not a
431.08s: single chance in the world that if I was
433.08s: asked who I would bet on making more
435.36s: money in 2025 that I would bet on the
438.08s: two-year uh newer Trader uh so
441.04s: confidence is not causal uh and and
443.60s: we're really looking at kind of the
444.60s: underpinnings of of your competency
447.04s: because that is ideally what should uh
449.96s: align your
451.16s: confidence super interesting and
453.32s: obviously you've spent a lot of time
455.24s: both you've written a couple books
457.04s: analyzing a lot of the psychology of
459.04s: trading and you obviously have your
461.04s: client base so you you have a good
462.44s: sample of people that you've looked at
464.52s: one of the things that I've always found
466.36s: so interesting is that there's this
468.80s: effect it's obviously so obvious but I
473.12s: just I can't understand a way around it
475.80s: the effect is if you are talking to that
479.04s: two Traer and you're explaining to them
481.76s: the stove is hot if you touch the stove
484.08s: you're going to burn yourself and yet
486.44s: there are still there's that compulsion
488.56s: to like have to touch the stove like you
492.36s: can't just take it secondhand from
494.20s: somebody like what is that and is there
497.64s: a way to coach people so that you
500.64s: actually can effectively learn lessons
503.32s: you know secondhand without having to
505.04s: touch everything yourself yeah I mean
507.56s: look some people are just experiential
509.48s: ERS um and I would put myself in that
511.92s: category U if I'm going to learn a
514.28s: concept I need to have kind of some uh
518.04s: experience to really be able to kind of
520.00s: anchor that concept too so I can kind of
522.44s: learn it first but very quickly my mind
524.40s: is going to kind of start to wander and
526.52s: not really be uh that interested in like
529.04s: Reading More Concept like I need to just
531.00s: go experience it and I need to go touch
532.60s: that stove in
534.56s: trading I you can touch the stove make
536.80s: sure it's not like burning hot that's
538.44s: actually going to like you know know
539.60s: create you know six degree burns right
543.36s: you can scale down this thing so you can
545.44s: gain experience at very very low cost
547.68s: and very very low pain uh but like gives
551.40s: you the ability to kind of stick your
552.84s: hand in the water and feel around and
555.04s: and get a sense of it gain some
556.32s: experience so yeah there are some people
558.36s: that that just you just cannot learn
560.40s: everything from the sidelines you can
562.48s: gain Concepts you can gain wisdom
564.68s: experience uh gain knowledge from other
567.04s: people's experience but then you have to
569.20s: get go and start to translate it for
571.44s: yourself and then ultimately developing
573.56s: your own fingerprint your own style as a
576.36s: Trader so yeah some of it is just that
578.92s: but I think maybe more to your question
581.24s: is the people that have already started
584.40s: to put their hand in the stove and they
587.04s: themselves feel the heat and they get
590.60s: burned but then they keep doing it
593.20s: again and that is a bit more complicated
598.04s: now we're getting into you know more of
600.64s: the kind of the the underlying drivers
603.76s: with which compels us to do things so
606.32s: for example a lot of Traders get into
609.04s: this Enterprise or I should say a lot of
611.56s: people they're not Traders yet a lot of
613.84s: people get into this Enterprise looking
616.04s: to make money quickly looking to make
617.88s: easy money thinking that they can you
620.00s: know they see stuff on Instagram
622.16s: elsewhere you know driving Lambos and
624.12s: beach houses and flying around the world
626.00s: and yada y y well I want that too and
629.64s: truly they're no different than somebody
631.56s: who is you know going to buy a Powerball
633.84s: ticket but they're convincing themselves
636.80s: that it's you know more of a a skill
640.08s: which it is but they're not actually
641.92s: interested in acquiring the skill so you
644.60s: know where this is going to show up
645.92s: mostly and them just kind of continuing
647.40s: to touch that fire it's you know fomo
649.80s: but something's ripping you know don't
652.28s: get in unless you have like a viable
654.48s: setup and if you missed it like all
656.48s: right it sucks stay out hold your
659.68s: capital and wait for another opportunity
661.48s: uh that's going to present itself like
662.84s: no well I want to make money quickly and
666.00s: easily this seems like an opportunity to
668.88s: do that and that compulsion right to to
673.16s: objectively you and I might say well
674.88s: you're actually sticking your hand right
676.20s: in that stove again to them they're
679.28s: blinded by that desire to make money
682.28s: quickly and easily and that blocks out
684.72s: any perception in the moment that
687.08s: there's any any danger right to them
688.88s: it's just like no no this this stove is
691.00s: gold like I have to put it my hand on it
692.96s: in order to grab something so that
694.60s: that's just like one example of where
696.56s: you know those underlying flaws biases
698.76s: wishes Illusions can compel us to do
701.72s: some dumb things so what got you
705.48s: interested in like the psychological
707.92s: element of the world really because
710.16s: again like we were talking about in the
711.12s: beginning it's not really relegated to
712.56s: just trading you have actually a pretty
714.44s: varied background yes I've worked with
717.04s: golfers and poker players and you know
718.96s: Prof professional gamblers Sports
720.48s: betters um esport athletes pool players
723.04s: Radiologists lawyers doctors you know
725.72s: business people so it it's it is like
728.52s: the psychology of performance um and
731.80s: what got interested in was like my own
733.56s: mental Hang-Ups trying to you know play
735.28s: professionally as a golfer uh 97 tried
738.96s: to qualify for the US Open uh played
741.80s: amazingly well TD green now the US Open
744.76s: has two two you know kind of rounds of
746.68s: qualifying this is the first round so
748.00s: it's not like I'm you know I was like on
749.68s: the doorstep to actually playing in the
750.88s: open but you know at 18 like I was close
755.48s: getting through to that in that second
756.96s: stage like you're playing with PJ tour
758.52s: players like this is this is real um and
762.16s: you know I missed a bunch of putts you
763.64s: know of this length where you know
765.20s: putting was my weakness but you know the
767.08s: pressure really kind of got to me and
768.92s: that was the first time that I'd ever
770.24s: played in an event of that magnitude um
772.76s: I'd Gotten Good very very quickly uh
774.80s: having been you know a baseball player
776.36s: tennis player and you know kind of chose
777.96s: golf because I was 411 as a freshman in
780.48s: high school and you know figured my uh
782.88s: my prospects of playing professionally
784.32s: in that sport was going to be a little
785.48s: bit higher than uh baseball and Tennis
787.88s: um so I I just kind of dove into it good
790.40s: really quickly and then um you know
792.12s: suddenly kind of in this position where
793.48s: it's like wow like you're on the
795.00s: doorsteps of living a dream and you know
797.88s: basically just kind of peeped on my on
799.12s: my shoes so it again it happens once
801.44s: like it's not that big a deal but then
803.28s: in the in the USA qualifier later that
805.12s: year same thing happens like just played
807.36s: awful and and now you know kind of
809.76s: pattern starts to take hold and I you
812.08s: know just like dove into golf psychology
814.12s: reading a bunch of books and trying to
815.60s: find answers to this issue and generally
818.44s: speaking my performance continued to
820.32s: elevate now I was this was like the
822.68s: summer after my freshman year at College
825.00s: uh and I had won two events in that
826.88s: freshman year and you know won a few
828.60s: more the following year and was a
830.44s: All-American in division three um
833.16s: continuing to get better except you know
835.72s: when I would step out and play in some
837.16s: of these big you know events that were
839.20s: more aligned with my longer term dreams
842.04s: and so at that point you know I was like
844.00s: all right well I'm not one to just kind
845.52s: of like you know try something I wasn't
848.28s: going to turn Professional without
849.96s: really feeling like I had an answer to
851.48s: this and so I decided actually to derail
855.36s: my uh aspirations at that point and go
858.40s: and get a master's degree in counseling
860.52s: psychology uh what I reasoned was
862.60s: missing from the sort of sports
864.92s: psychology golf psychology equation at
866.88s: that point was an understanding of the
869.20s: cality right a lot of what I was reading
871.08s: a lot of what was being expressed was
873.00s: very kind of Behavioral in nature
875.24s: meaning like you're feeling too much
877.16s: pressure we're going to teach you to
878.12s: relax you're not feeling confident
879.32s: enough we're going to boost your
880.28s: confidence you're getting angry to calm
882.04s: down it was to me kind of ones and zeros
884.80s: and as I said it worked but not under
887.36s: the most intense pressure heat and
888.84s: stress where any weakness is going to
890.88s: get magnified and ultimately affect you
894.36s: but therapists right their job is to
896.96s: dive deep and to problem solve uh at
899.76s: very personal levels and you know at the
902.88s: time I was thinking maybe this was
904.20s: personal what I've come to found out
906.04s: find out is it's not always personal
908.92s: it's more of these performance flaws
912.00s: biases wishes Illusions how we're
913.76s: perceiving ourselves our skill sets the
916.76s: environment our competitors etc those
920.16s: misperceptions the flaws in which we're
922.00s: sort of seeing you know all of those
924.48s: factors ultimately create the emotional
927.32s: volatility now yes there can be personal
929.56s: issues that are are you know that can be
932.96s: part of the equation there it doesn't
934.84s: have to be so I get my Master's Degree
937.76s: uh from nor Eastern uh you know spent
939.84s: two years getting license as a therapist
942.16s: and then as soon as that happens you
943.48s: know July 20 uh
945.36s: 2005 I I basically now have like
948.20s: beginning to kind of incorporate my
950.12s: system or beginning to build my system
952.32s: which is combining those two things um
954.96s: and I uh move to Arizona start working
957.68s: uh with golfers at a well club and start
960.40s: building up a roster worked with a gal
962.16s: who you know won on the LPGA Tour few
964.48s: other professionals some other good
965.72s: Junior players uh but ultimately I kind
968.24s: of found Traction in professional poker
970.76s: um there was a big enough base of people
972.52s: who U understood that uh if they were
976.60s: not sharp they were going to lose money
979.40s: and you know golfers have a way of kind
981.28s: of convincing themselves that uh you
983.64s: know that it's more about you know
985.28s: hitting the range and hit the put and
986.40s: green and working on their technique
987.88s: which again we we talked about is
989.84s: important but ultimately when you know
992.20s: there's enough uh impairing your
994.12s: judgment it's it's not just about that
996.28s: anymore so uh you know started building
999.20s: up a big roster of of clients in in
1001.20s: poker wrote a book in 2011 mentally a
1003.20s: poker um and in 2013 shortly after my
1006.20s: second poker book came out Traders
1008.04s: started picking up the first one saying
1010.20s: you look if you change the word poker to
1011.76s: trading it all app same stuff so I start
1014.76s: building up a roster of of Traders and
1016.68s: you know uh land an Institutional client
1018.92s: where I'm flying in person working with
1020.68s: 40 of their Traders over the course of
1022.28s: four or five days and doing sessions all
1024.44s: day and you know really kind of diving
1026.20s: into that and you know start building up
1027.72s: a roster of retail Traders and you know
1030.04s: independent people and some other um
1031.80s: opportunities along those lines um
1034.28s: landed gig with uh Team Liquid which is
1037.08s: one of the largest esport teams
1038.96s: organizations in the world working with
1041.20s: the DOTA teams and Counter-Strike teams
1042.80s: and again environments what I'm not you
1045.20s: know an expert in right golf is my you
1047.48s: know primary of expert of expertise but
1049.88s: I translated what I did there into poker
1052.76s: into trading into Esports you know and
1055.16s: then into other areas and you know in
1056.96s: doing that have really kind of honed my
1059.64s: system you know over all these years and
1062.20s: yeah it applies in every environment
1063.80s: there's obviously unique uh
1066.28s: applications but at the end of the day
1068.12s: it comes down to you know us being human
1070.36s: beings and you know we're just not that
1073.28s: unique we're not that special at this
1075.56s: point you know there's just not a lot of
1077.44s: novelty in the underlying causality of
1079.92s: what I see there's a lot of variety and
1083.08s: uniqueness of the people that I work
1084.56s: with and the way that they experience
1085.96s: those problems but at the end of the day
1088.12s: it's it's just not that unique we're not
1089.72s: that special right and obviously you
1093.32s: still have clubs to swing around so how
1095.60s: did golf end up going for you 2007 um
1100.28s: this is sort of of an interesting kind
1102.08s: of note like I firmly kind of solved my
1105.04s: issues at that point was playing some of
1106.60s: the best golf of my life started playing
1108.56s: some mini tour events um you know kind
1110.44s: of the minor leagues of golf um and you
1113.48s: know not doing terribly great but like
1116.04s: started to see some some signs that like
1118.52s: okay you know um I'm I'm ready to kind
1120.76s: of give this a go you know you kind of
1122.48s: estimate at that point it's about you
1124.20s: know 250 Grand over three years of you
1127.00s: know travel expenses training Etc to
1129.20s: really make it worthwhile obviously a
1130.88s: big expense didn't have the capital
1132.56s: probably could go find it but poker is
1135.00s: like ripping like things are taking off
1136.80s: and it's like okay you know here's work
1139.04s: in the road I could take a risk on
1140.68s: myself or I could continue to kind of go
1143.16s: down this path and see you know and
1145.60s: maybe I'll have another opportunity um
1148.24s: because truly like at that point like
1150.12s: poker was the safer bet so you know I I
1154.04s: I still played at high level you know
1155.84s: even more recently this is you know now
1157.28s: 20 years later um and truly what I've
1160.40s: kind of come to is uh I love the game uh
1165.64s: but I'm incredibly happy with the
1167.28s: coaching practice that I've developed
1169.00s: and and the work that I do and yeah I
1171.80s: think I I would not be as uh as
1173.88s: fulfilled as a person if I was a
1175.72s: professional golfer I'm certain I'd be
1177.44s: happy I'm not saying that I wouldn't be
1179.16s: happy you know having to live out a
1181.16s: dream but um you know the the road
1183.88s: that's taken me here is uncovered
1185.32s: aspects of my character my personality
1187.08s: my ultimately my intelligence that I I
1189.52s: just never would have found otherwise um
1191.72s: it turns out I was dyslexic didn't know
1193.64s: that as a kid you know didn't really
1195.36s: know it till I was in my 30s which
1197.04s: explains why you know education was
1199.52s: challenging frankly even now golf was
1202.44s: challenging I'm not saying that was the
1203.52s: cause of my pressure but certainly the
1205.20s: way in which I made decisions out there
1206.76s: was a little bit affected so um having
1209.32s: you know uncovered a lot about myself um
1212.24s: you know through this has really been um
1216.00s: uh I think a a a big source of what
1219.72s: validates and and fulfills me today uh
1223.08s: because I look at my own everyday
1224.68s: coaching as now my primary area of
1226.76s: performance and I take my my work
1228.64s: incredibly seriously and you know want
1230.36s: to be the best I can be with it yeah
1232.56s: that's super cool it's it's also really
1234.60s: interesting to find you know the
1236.64s: original idea of what we think the
1239.24s: journey is going to look like and then
1240.64s: kind of accepting the pivots as they
1242.16s: come reminds me of I'm really big into
1245.00s: martial arts and Jiu-Jitsu is you know
1247.44s: obviously part of that game and there's
1249.60s: a a famous teacher um John Daner and
1254.20s: he's very similar to this where he's not
1257.64s: like personally had a massive Jiu-Jitsu
1260.72s: level career he's successful but he's
1262.68s: not like some sort of renowned Jiu-Jitsu
1264.80s: player or anything like that but the
1267.08s: people that he coached now are
1268.36s: essentially the best in the world so he
1271.48s: definitely it sounds similar to you like
1273.56s: found his calling he found the thing
1275.96s: where he really enjoys it which is it's
1278.40s: just always cool you know to to see that
1281.08s: match up with people totally I want to I
1284.96s: justly like you know sometimes you know
1287.84s: the criticism of people in my you know
1290.92s: spot or you know like the guy you're
1293.12s: just mentioning you know it's like those
1295.12s: who can't teach but the reality is that
1297.84s: those that do those that do oftentimes
1300.64s: can't teach right Tiger Woods is aw is
1303.56s: an awful golf coach he would be a
1305.20s: terrible coach to most most golfers
1307.04s: right just be better oh sick thanks yeah
1310.08s: he's he's good with other professionals
1311.84s: because they kind of talk the same
1312.92s: language but when there's a huge skill
1314.40s: Gap he's not capable of really like
1317.16s: filling it so yeah it it like kind of
1320.08s: takes somebody and I think what I've
1321.64s: been able to bring to Poker and trading
1324.32s: you know specifically is like almost
1326.40s: like a anthropologist sociologist kind
1328.68s: of perspective where I've really like
1331.32s: researched a you know the way in which
1333.84s: Traders talk and experience these issues
1337.20s: and you know ideally kind of reflecting
1339.64s: back to you you know where some of the
1342.04s: big holes are and I'll I'll just throw
1343.68s: one example out here and I'll kind of
1345.20s: turn the back to you like with fomo fomo
1349.08s: is a is an awful term because it's
1351.44s: really really imprecise people talk
1353.20s: about it like it's a problem but you
1355.52s: know if you went to the doctor and the
1357.00s: doctor said you know you we W you
1358.72s: weren't feeling well and something was
1360.52s: wrong you know clearly something was
1362.00s: wrong he said you know what Eric you're
1364.68s: sick like like what what does that mean
1367.96s: like no you're sick like you know just
1369.68s: go home and get well I
1371.88s: mean obviously that would be a
1373.96s: horrendous doctor you'd never go back to
1375.48s: again right right when when a lot of
1377.32s: Traders say that they have fomo they're
1379.36s: effectively saying the same thing it's
1380.92s: so imprecise that you're not really able
1383.68s: to correct it right once you start to
1385.68s: peel back the layers and understand that
1388.56s: you know anger and overconfidence and a
1391.16s: lack of confidence and fear can all
1393.20s: produce
1394.12s: fomo then we got we've got you know an a
1397.36s: like avenues for being able to dissect
1399.28s: it in how you experience it because that
1402.16s: is what matters to being able to correct
1403.84s: it so things like that even like greed I
1406.36s: mean
1407.44s: greed your job is to make money like is
1411.68s: is Tiger Wood was Tiger Woods greedy
1414.12s: because he wanted to win you know every
1416.56s: major championship in every tournament
1418.08s: and practically did like no we of course
1420.92s: he prays in it like Patrick Mahomes was
1423.40s: not greedy trying to win a third Super
1425.56s: Bowl in a row right didn't do it but
1427.92s: that doesn't make him greedy so you're
1429.88s: not greedy when you try to make more
1431.32s: money you're greedy when the execution
1435.20s: of your tactics go beyond what you know
1438.76s: is sound right when Patrick tries to
1441.84s: make an aggressive throw into traffic
1445.20s: like maybe we could say he was a little
1446.76s: bit greedy early on I'm not again it's
1448.88s: to him it's for him to decide right
1451.52s: armchair quarterbacks not really that
1453.44s: great at analysis but the point is like
1455.72s: the greed is a determination based off
1457.96s: of where your strategy got
1460.40s: excessive not based off of some you know
1463.88s: like overarching idea that is bad right
1466.64s: Traders make you know your job is to
1468.40s: make money that it's the same thing as
1470.00s: tiger or Patrick trying to win
1472.36s: championships it's so funny that you
1474.76s: pivoted to greed because I literally
1476.40s: wrote it down in my notebook to to
1478.76s: mention that one next and it's because
1481.28s: the funniest thing I find about greed is
1483.92s: a lot of Traitor I I don't think it's
1486.44s: actually the correct terminology but I
1487.72s: always call it like uh false attribution
1490.04s: where they'll say oh I I you know I got
1493.24s: greedy so blank happened and to your
1496.24s: exact point I always think of it from
1497.60s: the perspective of okay yeah there there
1499.96s: might be an element of that but what
1502.12s: about like where was the presence of a
1503.84s: plan of like an actual profit management
1506.20s: Point Loss Management Point like these
1507.88s: things that are typically predefined
1509.40s: before you enter a trade that kind of
1511.36s: just sort circuits the greed it doesn't
1513.16s: matter necessarily if it's there if you
1514.92s: already have these areas pointed that
1517.28s: the main thing is just to Echo your
1518.56s: broader point where it's like I feel
1520.28s: like a lot of times people arrive at
1521.96s: like these superficial answers that they
1524.04s: think sound smart and self you know
1526.16s: revealing but really it's still just
1528.44s: like the very tip of the iceberg so to
1531.16s: turn and a lot of times that happens
1533.36s: because people can't tolerate
1534.84s: uncertainty to say I don't know why this
1538.24s: happened is way harder to tolerate
1541.08s: because like you'd rather know something
1543.96s: You' rather attach yourself to a false
1546.12s: idea for the sake of not feeling unsure
1549.48s: and frankly like if you're unsure of
1551.40s: something that means you're you're in a
1553.48s: position where you actually can learn
1555.80s: again it goes back to that false
1557.12s: confidence right if you're one of those
1558.52s: people who are overconfident in this
1560.68s: case overconfident in your ability to
1562.52s: dissect and diagnose your trading issues
1565.76s: well then you're going to be in a
1566.80s: position where you're never uncertain
1568.16s: which means you're never going to
1569.60s: learn what a interesting point it be
1572.96s: yeah it just kind of becomes this
1574.60s: vicious cycle that feeds on itself which
1577.68s: is follow yeah the the followup I wanted
1581.32s: to ask you there which is so I feel like
1584.92s: Traders go through this series where
1587.44s: they get to the point where they feel
1589.24s: like they're self-identifying these
1591.00s: issues right like I'm greedy and that's
1593.28s: what caused this to go bad but obviously
1595.84s: as we're talking about a lot of times
1597.32s: that's actually quite superficial what
1599.64s: are some methods that you use to help
1602.80s: Traders move past that superficial top
1606.44s: level analysis into the actual positive
1609.52s: attribution of like what's the the
1611.72s: feeding forces that are leading to this
1613.68s: Behavior yeah so I'd say easiest way to
1616.48s: do that is um what I call a data
1619.12s: collection worksheet okay uh free freely
1621.96s: available on my website Jared tender.com
1623.72s: backwork sheets and but like the basic
1626.92s: ideas are are pretty basic so you're
1629.16s: identifying in real time around your
1631.48s: trading mistakes the triggers for that
1634.64s: what you think is greed or at least your
1636.48s: emotions uh the thoughts that you have
1639.32s: in that moment whether they're you know
1641.56s: in your head or things you say out loud
1644.20s: you know trying to kind of peel back the
1646.44s: emotion right describe what the emotion
1648.68s: is in that moment describe the actions
1651.08s: or the behaviors or the physical
1652.72s: Sensations you feel at that time right
1654.40s: are you kind of just like locked into a
1657.16s: a one chart when you should be having a
1659.56s: kind of U zoomed out focus you know are
1662.28s: you toggling down to uh you know lower
1665.00s: time frames um uh yeah are you just like
1668.80s: turning off certain factors uh you know
1671.64s: or indicators that might might help you
1674.20s: how does your perception of the market
1675.72s: change how does your perception of your
1677.20s: positions change how does your
1678.64s: perception of of your own strategy
1680.20s: change be very very detailed in as
1683.52s: capturing as much data as you can you
1684.76s: might not get all of those points you
1686.64s: know at any one time but you get like
1687.88s: two or three well now all of a sudden
1689.76s: you start to uh create some some data
1692.72s: that's going to help you gather more
1694.48s: data right in other situations or see
1696.68s: with clients I'll have them print this
1698.16s: out or have it on their computer and you
1700.48s: know situation comes up where right they
1702.64s: feel that fomo they feel that greed they
1704.28s: feel that fear of losing the Revenge
1706.64s: trading whatever right they are
1708.56s: capturing as much data as they can in
1710.80s: real time after the trading day is over
1712.76s: they'll go back review it add any
1714.40s: additional notes they can you do this
1716.16s: day over day all of a sudden now there's
1718.32s: going to be start start you're going to
1719.72s: start to see some patterning you're
1720.88s: going to start to see some repetition
1722.96s: and frankly like I wrote the mental game
1724.72s: of trading help like within mind that
1728.00s: you could find like kind of comparing
1731.36s: the data you find with what you see in
1733.52s: the book and then the book can help to
1735.32s: kind of walk you through you know what
1737.56s: might be underlying those particular
1739.48s: issues yes you can obviously spend some
1741.68s: time reflecting asking yourself some
1743.36s: questions and trying to figure out why
1745.32s: you're experiencing what you're
1746.28s: experiencing and get good answers but
1748.72s: the book right I'd say captures about
1751.24s: 80% of what Traders are experiencing so
1753.36s: it's definitely a littleit a cheat code
1755.64s: to being able to kind of dissect it for
1757.28s: yourself because I've given you a little
1758.44s: bit of a road map to be able to do that
1760.92s: yeah that's it's super interesting and
1763.68s: another question I have dovetailing off
1765.44s: of this idea of self-analysis and this
1768.64s: might be a little bit of the the caveman
1771.28s: side of my brain but I've I always found
1775.04s: the ju to position between analysis and
1779.20s: actually like root cause analysis to be
1781.36s: useful but then I feel like there's
1784.36s: another layer of that where it's over
1786.72s: analysis where we're just like almost
1788.96s: analyzing new problems into creation is
1792.52s: that something that you've seen at all
1795.04s: and if so like what are some methods for
1797.84s: people people to conduct effective
1799.84s: analysis where they're getting to an
1801.24s: answer and then they're confident in
1803.72s: this answer and then able to move on to
1805.52s: you know the the next piece well the key
1807.44s: word you said is
1808.84s: confident they come to an answer and
1810.80s: they're actually not confident it's the
1812.08s: same reason why Traders system hop right
1814.28s: where they're continually looking for
1815.76s: kind of the next best thing because
1818.20s: there's not a base of confidence that's
1820.72s: being established and ultimately as I
1823.80s: said before it needs to come through
1826.12s: competency right your confidence is most
1828.64s: align with your con
1830.80s: competence uh when it's when it's
1832.88s: effective when it's grounded so you know
1836.40s: if you're continuing to
1838.88s: overanalyze then you have to come back
1840.96s: and ask yourself like do I feel like I
1843.96s: have the skill to properly determine
1847.52s: whether or not this is the problem or
1849.40s: not and if the answer is yes then you
1853.72s: have to invariably trust that first
1856.56s: answer and then go read research and
1859.00s: test whether or not you were right or
1860.36s: not if the answer is I'm not sure or no
1863.84s: then get better at that analysis first
1867.12s: before you go and start analyzing
1869.08s: another problem because like it doesn't
1870.92s: mean or if you you might choose to
1872.28s: analyze another problem but you're doing
1875.16s: so in the spirit of trying to maybe
1876.92s: solve something but also get better at
1879.76s: that analysis like there's kind of two
1881.64s: parts to it you know as a Trader as an
1885.96s: independent um you don't have the the
1888.08s: ability to uh well I mean that's why
1890.92s: people hire me right it's like they to
1893.48s: kind of bring them on your team but like
1895.00s: you know if you're on a on a on a sports
1896.96s: team right you have people naturally
1899.68s: around you who you rely on to do that
1902.92s: diagnosis that's what really good
1904.52s: coaches are able to
1905.96s: do uh not just help you to analyze but
1908.72s: also figure out from a a training
1911.24s: standpoint how to be better how to solve
1912.88s: those issues and if it's something
1914.16s: mechanical they'll find experts to fill
1915.88s: those gaps and right I mean really good
1919.00s: coaches uh know what not to focus on so
1921.88s: that you can really Zone in and focus on
1924.40s: uh what you do when you're trying to be
1926.56s: a coach for yourself from a mentality
1929.40s: standpoint from a risk management
1930.76s: standpoint from a technical standpoint
1932.68s: it's hard to kind of toggle between
1934.16s: those but it it sort of begins with the
1936.48s: honesty to say like all right you know
1938.08s: what I'm not very good at this thing yet
1940.60s: so let me just keep
1943.00s: practicing and not kind of getting
1944.88s: accessive with I think that's a way of
1946.52s: of slowing down that that extra analysis
1949.76s: yeah that's that's super useful it's
1951.64s: interesting um another thing I've come
1955.04s: across that I'm interested your
1956.92s: perspective on are looking to achieve
1960.24s: things either I don't know the correct
1962.32s: terminology but when you're trying to
1964.12s: achieve something to achieve the thing
1966.12s: or when you're trying to achieve the
1967.68s: thing to avoid failure I don't know the
1970.12s: correct I don't know what that's called
1971.80s: but doesn't matter yeah I don't I don't
1973.68s: either yeah okay well whatever that
1976.12s: thing is is is that something that
1978.72s: you've analyzed across your clients and
1982.44s: have you come across any commonalities
1985.40s: between specifically the trading world
1987.96s: where if it's more effective when people
1989.96s: are trying to hit something because they
1991.92s: want to hit this versus avoid that or
1993.72s: vice versa they're both effective you
1996.84s: know the the fear of failure the fear of
1998.68s: losing the fear of being destitute uh
2001.48s: the fear of not being able to pay your
2002.96s: mortgage and have your like all those
2005.44s: things the hatred of losing like all
2007.56s: those say like the all the avoidance
2010.04s: motivators um can be very very effective
2012.92s: however they're limited when you know
2015.96s: like you're actually successful um you
2018.84s: know I mean Jordan Michael Jordan was
2020.80s: famous for um constantly needing people
2024.28s: to think less of him and to slight him
2026.28s: and to find that like anger that's what
2029.96s: drove that's what allowed him to be his
2032.04s: absolute best but he had to like create
2034.68s: it and he had to like mentally
2036.28s: manipulate his mind and he was expert at
2038.12s: being able to do that it's hard for you
2040.36s: know Mortals to like do that reliably
2043.84s: and continue to find failure and fear at
2047.24s: a at a you know at a at a high level so
2050.08s: invariably you know they'll kind of go
2052.60s: through those waves of like all right
2054.92s: don't [ __ ] up don't fail don't right and
2056.68s: then you're like oh okay I can breathe
2058.08s: the end and then then you got to fall
2059.76s: back down to earth only to kind of find
2061.56s: that next pivots like well what's going
2063.40s: to keep you kind of contining to thrive
2065.48s: some people right are much more
2066.76s: motivated by their asp
2068.48s: aspirations um and so yes I think when
2071.88s: you have a more pure motivation towards
2074.44s: your goals towards what you want to
2076.84s: accomplish there is an independence to
2079.28s: that right you're not relying on
2081.08s: external outcomes to drive it but
2085.00s: sometimes maybe you're not as
2086.68s: aspirational as you could be because
2088.52s: what you envision your own potential to
2090.64s: be is based off of you know your own
2093.04s: perception of yourself which could
2094.96s: actually be too low right you might be
2098.48s: capable of making you know eight figures
2100.92s: a year or eight figures period and
2102.84s: building that kind of wealth but if
2104.84s: you're only kind of aiming lower because
2107.48s: you know you have a strange relationship
2109.40s: with money because you grew up poor or
2111.76s: you know your parents uh you know
2113.40s: weren't super supportive and so you're
2115.72s: you know having a little bit of that
2117.24s: impostor syndrome you know when you're
2119.12s: having success well then you know that
2121.16s: undervaluing may not give you the sort
2123.64s: of authentic real you know aspirations
2127.40s: so
2128.48s: there's not like kind of a one-size
2129.80s: fits-all that's going to help everybody
2131.12s: I think at the end of the day is like
2133.08s: you know once you achieve some success
2135.20s: and you find right that you you know
2138.12s: maybe need to be a bit more aspirational
2139.92s: and less defensive in a sense you know
2142.64s: or you need to be more offensively
2144.56s: minded I mean you know a little bit more
2147.64s: um you know in that kind of
2149.48s: corrective uh place to to fix some of
2152.80s: the the faulty uh perspectives you have
2155.36s: to yourself so you can actually be more
2156.92s: offensive
2157.82s: [Music]
2159.64s: um it everybody's kind of got to figure
2162.76s: out their own mixture and formula uh for
2164.84s: what's going to allow them to be
2165.72s: successful I don't think there's a
2166.92s: one-size fitall option but we kind of
2169.24s: solve it for everyone sure sure so in
2172.60s: that essentially you you haven't found
2174.40s: like some sort of stronger correlation
2176.52s: or output if somebody is acting out of
2179.84s: fear-based incentives versus
2181.84s: aspirational it's kind of just very
2183.24s: specific to the individual yeah got it
2186.40s: and I was smiling for cuz you started
2188.60s: doing that thing again where I I I in my
2191.48s: defense I wrote this one down earlier
2193.32s: but it was the very next thing I was
2194.64s: going to move on to that you naturally
2196.16s: started blending us into which is this
2198.68s: idea of trying to balance like thinking
2201.64s: big right aspirations trying to not
2204.20s: glass cealing yourself but then
2207.28s: also being
2209.16s: realistic and balancing the ever
2211.72s: presentent you know potential for
2214.08s: failure so for Traders
2217.76s: are there any tips or tricks that you
2220.44s: have with respect to helping them figure
2223.84s: out like what the right focuses what the
2226.44s: right target is which obviously will be
2229.60s: highly personalized and commencer with
2231.68s: individual performance capabilities but
2234.08s: from a broader perspective I think the
2236.60s: the biggest thing is not getting
2237.92s: emotionally attached to the bigger
2239.92s: Vision um that's that's where your
2243.12s: energy um when it get or your emotions
2245.48s: when they get too attached to
2248.16s: those bigger
2249.32s: aspirations um that they can cause a lot
2251.48s: of problems and I think people having
2253.52s: done that before maybe in other
2255.52s: environments and having gotten whacked
2257.88s: and not being as successful as they
2259.28s: wanted to and uh they end up kind of
2262.84s: naturally like aiming lower right
2265.84s: because they don't want to get swept up
2268.00s: in that
2268.88s: emotionality um so you're really kind of
2272.00s: band-aiding the problem by like not
2274.48s: engaging in it versus like no have those
2277.76s: massive
2279.00s: aspirations but use them to guide you to
2282.68s: understand like what's required in the
2284.76s: next month three months six months or as
2287.16s: far out as you can plan generally you
2289.60s: know you get a year out like you're kind
2291.00s: of making estimates and it's you know
2293.04s: General ideas but like that's that's
2295.68s: where your nose needs to be like on the
2297.60s: grindstone doing the work day-to-day
2299.92s: really expanding your Precision with
2301.60s: your ex with your execution with your
2303.20s: improvement with your learning whatever
2305.40s: mentality technical risk management
2307.60s: right all that is what matters dayto day
2311.04s: but sometimes having those bigger
2313.28s: aspirations out
2315.04s: there um can place greater demands on
2318.36s: your time help to make you make better
2320.76s: choices I'm not saying you have to have
2322.72s: them right you you're you can you know
2325.88s: want trading to be like a really nice
2327.68s: side income that's going to give you the
2329.00s: ability to take your family on on like
2331.04s: one nice trip a year and if that's your
2332.88s: aspiration awesome like you know make it
2335.48s: happen but the same thing is true like
2338.04s: you know like what's required what
2339.96s: figure out what is required to reach
2341.56s: that outcome uh you know best way I
2343.68s: could describe this is like results and
2346.00s: process fit together right results
2349.00s: demand a certain process which you're
2351.00s: not really sure what it is yet but
2353.24s: you'll know based on the results you
2355.48s: know over enough time right did I do
2358.00s: enough to achieve my goal no okay well
2360.36s: let's retool and figure out yes cool
2362.48s: okay well what's next uh and so results
2365.40s: and process fit together it's not like a
2367.72s: long journey it's a journey with many
2370.40s: destinations and those destinations that
2372.44s: are predetermined give you feedback on
2374.92s: your process right if it's just
2377.08s: processed with no outcome I mean then
2379.72s: there's kind of no wrong answers right
2381.20s: theoretically so we want to have the
2383.24s: ability to know whether or not you're
2385.20s: meeting targets or not you know but we
2387.52s: don't want to be emotionally attached to
2389.12s: those targets because that will like
2391.48s: demotivate us or blind us to the
2393.24s: realities of what's required to give us
2395.08s: a chance of getting there and if we fall
2396.76s: short fine figure it out and fill figure
2399.28s: out how to fill that Gap right whether
2401.44s: that means uh you know reaching outside
2403.84s: of your immediate purview to do more
2405.80s: research and find people who can help
2407.32s: you to do that
2409.52s: interesting and you mentioned something
2412.12s: in there that I'm really interested in
2415.56s: which
2416.40s: is I
2418.52s: found I'm a little more in that first
2420.64s: group where I did grow up fairly poor so
2424.44s: my original goal was still at the time I
2428.16s: considered really aggressive obviously
2430.68s: as I got close to it became pretty
2432.84s: modest in nature and I I found myself
2435.96s: for a long time telling myself like I'm
2439.84s: okay with blank right whatever this
2442.44s: thing is and then I started to realize
2445.88s: that part of that was essentially me
2448.12s: lying to myself and just being
2450.52s: comfortable with where I'm at because
2451.92s: it's comfortable there and that's the
2453.40s: reality and the prospects of potentially
2455.92s: reaching induces failure potential and
2458.20s: stuff like that I had like this really
2460.24s: interesting just self reflection that I
2462.68s: went through as I started identifying
2464.52s: that how do you guide people through
2468.00s: that process of setting good goals but
2473.72s: making sure that the goals aren't based
2475.80s: on Comfort where if somebody says to you
2477.52s: like Jared I am I'm completely
2479.68s: comfortable with just my trading being
2481.68s: the side income whereas if they had the
2483.68s: potential for the trading to actually be
2485.92s: their full-time job they would jump on
2487.40s: it immediately but they're concerned to
2490.08s: make that
2491.64s: jump it's hard I mean I I my
2495.84s: um you know without talking to somebody
2498.56s: right I think it's part of part of the
2500.00s: question without talking to somebody um
2503.20s: it's hard to kind of know where a little
2505.52s: bit of that BS lies right where
2507.76s: something's just a little bit off um you
2511.12s: know like you said two things that I'll
2513.56s: challenge you specifically on it maybe
2515.36s: gives those that are watching some ideas
2517.36s: of like how to find this but like write
2519.40s: out your goals and then write out the
2520.96s: wise behind your goals and and if you
2524.04s: find language that feels a little bit
2525.92s: soft feels a little bit you know wafy or
2529.56s: undefined or unclear well then that's
2532.08s: probably an indicator right so when you
2533.64s: said you know I'm okay with X that
2537.24s: basically means that you're saying I'm
2539.44s: okay being
2541.48s: okay that's truly what you want well
2544.28s: then cool okay is enough
2547.64s: but is okay enough clearly it wasn't U
2550.84s: that was one two um I'm completely
2555.72s: comfortable uh whenever time we add
2558.64s: those um superlatives or I don't know
2561.04s: what the right word is like adjectives
2562.64s: on top of the the Comfort like it kind
2566.08s: of tells us that we're trying to
2567.24s: convince ourselves of something like I
2569.24s: am
2570.84s: comfortable with making this kind of
2573.32s: money I'm comfortable with the idea and
2575.04s: I have evidence to prove that right I'm
2577.32s: completely comfortable are
2579.64s: you are you trying to convince yourself
2582.16s: of that um those will be kind of a
2585.32s: couple things to look out for yeah super
2587.40s: interesting I I I very interesting
2590.36s: especially like the the add-on language
2592.32s: that makes a lot of sense um I know that
2595.52s: I don't have you for too much longer as
2597.12s: you could tell I literally can talk your
2598.56s: ear off because as soon as you say stuff
2600.48s: more stuff gets written down and it's
2602.36s: this vicious cycle for you but don't
2604.64s: worry I made a promise to you I'll keep
2606.36s: it but okay the the next thing I wanted
2608.96s: to talk to you though one of the most
2611.32s: fascinating things I find about trading
2613.28s: is that it's it's like very holistic
2615.40s: meaning as a retail Trader you have to
2617.68s: be researcher you have to be the boss
2619.76s: you have to be the risk management
2620.96s: department you have to be this part
2622.24s: psychologist you have to there's a lot
2623.88s: of things you have to do and it feels
2625.72s: like one of the things you mentioned
2627.28s: earlier really stuck out with me which
2628.84s: is when you're dealing with some systems
2631.52s: that add pressure just about any of your
2634.40s: weaknesses are going to eventually come
2637.60s: to light you're going to see them do you
2639.64s: have any tips for Traders as you know
2643.36s: they might be newer not fully sure what
2645.36s: their weaknesses might actually be yet
2647.32s: because they don't know what they are do
2649.08s: you have any tips for those kinds of
2650.52s: people to become more self-aware of what
2652.76s: some of those weaknesses might be look
2655.36s: at other things you've done seriously
2657.28s: you know Hobbies don't really count
2658.68s: because it's not really going to draw
2659.84s: them out but things that you really
2661.76s: cared about uh will give you at least
2664.44s: some guide post to maybe like you hate
2667.12s: losing because you've you know hated
2669.36s: losing since you were a kid or you know
2671.48s: you tend to feel a lot of pressure when
2673.16s: you're taking tests or giving
2674.48s: presentations or you know when you're
2676.56s: really kind of um like kind of under the
2678.96s: heat um you're not really a confident
2681.48s: person uh you tend to be a little bit
2683.36s: arrogant you're a little proc bit of a
2685.96s: procrastinator uh you know you can see
2688.72s: these patterns in elsewhere in your life
2690.36s: and maybe they don't um harm you in
2694.08s: significant ways they don't they don't
2695.36s: really kind of impair like you're again
2696.88s: like like happy and
2698.76s: satisfied you know but in trading
2701.72s: they're going to come out and they're
2702.44s: going to be problem so you can kind of
2704.80s: start to get ahead of it before you even
2706.52s: develop the sort of technical Precision
2709.28s: to have a strategy that's going to maybe
2711.64s: show some of these problems to to be you
2715.16s: know uh damaging and costly in trading
2719.24s: uh ahead of time and and especially the
2721.40s: ones that are related to work ethic and
2723.68s: responsibility and discipline
2727.52s: motivation like those are ones you
2729.48s: really want to get ahead of because they
2731.20s: are absolutely going to slow you down
2734.44s: they'll be the Barnacles on your ship
2736.28s: here that reduce the friction or that
2738.76s: increase friction and slow down your
2740.36s: growth curve uh so yeah if you see any
2743.12s: of that stuff then then absolutely get
2745.12s: ahead of it um and it doesn't mean I'm
2747.32s: not saying like like work e work ethic
2749.52s: in this space sometimes means like nose
2752.40s: to the grindstone you know just full
2755.48s: board uh there is definitely a
2758.08s: relationship where you know you got to
2760.20s: start thinking about yourself as a
2761.64s: performer and and you know this is not
2764.84s: like you're taking a test once like
2767.12s: you're studying for the mcats or
2768.56s: studying for the Gres or whatever like
2771.56s: this is not nine months of study before
2773.36s: you start trading I mean I I've worked
2776.32s: with a a handful of people that have
2777.96s: done that but they've already known that
2780.76s: that is their style of learning and they
2783.88s: know that it works you know if you spend
2788.12s: a year just studying before you start to
2790.68s: enter the live market you know if you're
2793.04s: not certain that that style is going to
2794.88s: work you are at risk of getting into the
2799.76s: market with expectations that are way
2802.12s: too high because I I would think of the
2805.16s: transfer from studying and and preparing
2809.16s: yourself and learning to the live market
2812.32s: to like a a a
2814.72s: funnel right like you're only going to
2816.72s: get get a little bit through at a time
2818.88s: right our our mind only has bandwidth
2821.20s: for so much and so when you feel like
2824.20s: you're really strong command of certain
2826.68s: ideas Concepts Etc you know in study or
2829.84s: even in the
2831.48s: Sim it may not necessarily all just kind
2834.52s: of copy paste over right it's it's going
2837.12s: to take some time so those faulty
2839.56s: expectations are really damaging um you
2842.84s: know when when you spend an inordinate
2844.92s: amount of time studying before you
2846.48s: actually you know kind of make the
2847.92s: transfer but that's just kind of one tip
2849.40s: on top of the the overall idea of what I
2851.64s: was mentioning earlier and just kind of
2853.04s: using past other performance
2855.52s: environments to kind of help understand
2857.12s: what what issues may may affect you yeah
2860.20s: I I love that what what a great way to
2863.00s: try to add a little Clarity to something
2864.60s: that's truly ambiguous by using
2866.20s: references like that that super smart I
2869.04s: have two questions left we only have
2870.48s: time for one so I'll let you pick the
2872.24s: one that you like the most one of them
2873.84s: is really boring so I'm actually not
2876.24s: even going to pitch that one to you I'm
2878.60s: happy to go Lightning Run I can I can

2881.76s: to so beautiful okay then let's do that
2884.48s: what are the most common destructive
2887.08s: behaviors you see in
2892.72s: Traders say uh assuming that they know
2897.04s: the cause of their
2898.68s: problems love
2900.64s: that what are the most
2903.60s: common nefarious destructive Behavior
2907.12s: for Traders the differentiation I'm
2909.36s: making here is something that's commonly
2913.00s: afflicts people but people don't know
2915.48s: it's a normal Affliction meaning that
2918.16s: it's something that impacts a lot of
2920.04s: people but it's commonly
2927.24s: overlooked I mean I want to say Revenge
2929.32s: trading but I know it's so commonly
2931.56s: talked about so maybe we'll go like
2934.40s: desperation where there is
2937.60s: um like such a deep desire because
2940.36s: sometimes
2941.24s: desperation where you're just um you
2944.44s: know really violating your rules in ways
2946.68s: that feel so justified in the moment
2949.28s: right you're uh either leveraging up
2951.28s: sizing up you know eliminating stop
2953.96s: losses daily loss limits Etc to like
2957.24s: like sustain the hope that you can still
2959.20s: make money today make money in this
2960.92s: trade continue to kind of move
2963.44s: forward there's not a lot of emotion
2966.96s: that feels present in real time there's
2970.04s: just this
2972.48s: compulsion that is like driving you to
2975.24s: violate like all of your rules and it
2977.40s: feels as I said Justified at the moment
2979.96s: um so that that's probably the one that
2981.88s: like again it's not always in a very
2983.60s: emotional experience sometimes it could
2984.88s: be filled with anger um but there at the
2987.72s: heart of that is a very strong weakness
2989.60s: and confidence that um underlies it
2993.20s: interesting okay last one easy one what
2995.92s: are some of the most common traits that
2998.56s: you see in successful traitors I know
3000.00s: you've answered this a million times but
3001.36s: you got to ask when you're talking to
3002.60s: psychological
3003.88s: dude same thing as anything else you got
3006.92s: to have a love and a passion for it and
3008.96s: and that love and the passion translates
3010.64s: into doing the work required so it's the
3013.80s: passion and the work ethic I mean it's
3016.44s: it literally is no different than
3017.56s: anything else and and the love and
3019.04s: passion some of you can't um uh fake it
3022.96s: like you can be like in infatuated by
3026.80s: trting you can like really enjoy it and
3029.92s: still be good at it but in order for you
3032.40s: to be great you have to love it it has
3035.24s: to be like a part of you and that means
3037.04s: that you're going to be obsessed by it
3039.16s: you know um and and that Obsession to
3041.72s: others is going to look like you know

3088.32s: appreciative of trying to open the lens
