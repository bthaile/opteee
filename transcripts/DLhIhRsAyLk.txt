0.00s: What's up, outliers?
1.80s: Calling in from Florida, we're on the mobile set up,
4.12s: so forgive the lighting, but I want to talk about two things
6.24s: today.
7.08s: We have the recent new filing regarding roaring kitty dropping
11.44s: as chewy position, which you can see here,
14.04s: this is nothing new, we can kind of take a look
15.96s: and deconstruct what actually happened there.
18.08s: And then I also want to take a look at GameStop
20.24s: in kind of parallel because I had a pretty big move yesterday
23.00s: while I was traveling.
24.28s: And then I also want to look at DJT because I actually
27.68s: have on a pretty significant trade in here.
30.16s: We'll talk about the trade another time,
31.80s: but I do want to talk about the underlying itself
34.28s: in its movements.
35.40s: So first things first, let's grab this.
38.44s: And let's take a look at this new 13G.
43.72s: So you can see the date that it requires the update, which
47.32s: was the 30th of September.
49.88s: And you can see now that T holds nothing.
54.28s: So the interesting part here, actually,
56.60s: I wanted to see if it doesn't say anything about the cat.
60.20s: I wonder why not.
62.36s: Do you make anything of that?
63.44s: Because the first time he had the joke in there,
67.16s: I am not a cat.
68.60s: But this one doesn't, which I just find that interesting.
73.52s: I don't know if it actually means anything
75.68s: noteworthy or not.
76.52s: But yeah, so this obviously happened a little while ago.
80.88s: So let's take a look at 30 September on the chart.
84.08s: And let's see what it looks like here.
86.36s: And it's for a couple of reasons
88.20s: that I want to talk about this.
90.04s: The main thing is if we go to 30 September, which is right here,
96.16s: you can see this is very unlikely where he unwinds position,
100.80s: just because the volume is so low.
102.64s: But I think the broader speculation
104.68s: is that it happened in here-ish about the 20th of September
109.12s: and then he has a window that he has to provide an update on.
112.80s: So from essentially that point forward, though,
115.68s: Chuy has just been rolling over.
117.12s: And this just goes back to the fact
119.00s: that we can clearly tell the cat just likes to play around.
122.36s: He's just playing games.
123.36s: He's just trolling.
124.32s: He just picked up nine million shares of a company
126.72s: to play around, have some fun.
128.76s: And he unwinded it.
130.44s: I haven't done the math yet.
131.64s: We could take a look at it on the GME stream this weekend.
134.52s: But it doesn't look like he did super great in there.
137.56s: It doesn't really look like much happened
139.68s: in terms of proper loss, at least in terms
141.40s: of what he would care about.
142.60s: So it's literally for the lulls, which is hilarious to me.
146.32s: Now, this also is kind of interesting,
149.80s: because if we take a look at GameStop,
151.68s: GameStop had a massive day yesterday, of course,
154.84s: while I was traveling, it got active.
157.28s: So GameStop yesterday opened at 2083,
161.04s: and then it closed down at 2273.
163.76s: So a really, really significant run here.
166.48s: And today it's actually holding, which is quite fascinating.
170.12s: I imagine the news today from the cat dropping Chuy,
172.84s: probably will impact this.
174.68s: That would be my underlying assumption, at least,
178.04s: for a little bit, just because most people
180.56s: will make the natural leap out of Chuy.
183.08s: Maybe it was out of GameStop, maybe not nobody knows.
185.60s: We'll be back in GameStop.
186.64s: We'll know if he posts another yellow update.
188.56s: What is new cost basis is?
190.08s: Because unless he can time it perfectly,
192.08s: which would be exceedingly unlikely,
194.64s: we'll be able to see.
195.72s: So it's just a matter of time,
196.84s: until we find out what ended up happening
199.52s: with the GameStop position while he moved over to Chuy.
203.52s: So not a whole lot of reason to speculate there.
205.72s: But take a look at the volume here.
207.08s: Even the volume on the 25th started jacking up pretty
211.48s: meaningfully before the 28th.
213.64s: So this is actually, I talked about this in the discord,
216.36s: but I ended up buying calls that I thought were cheap,
219.64s: a little further out in time.
221.76s: I think 15 April 25 is what I ended up getting.
224.68s: I want to say the 30s, were the 20s?
228.92s: Either of those, I don't remember.
230.44s: But the whole idea was that position was relatively cheap.
235.64s: So I wanted to take advantage of it
238.12s: and I saw the volume starting to expand.
239.96s: So I just put on a little bit of a tester position
242.36s: that now I'm just kind of continuing to hold
244.84s: because it's working.
246.60s: So let's take a look at GameStop options here.
249.32s: We still have 623,000 calls against 226 puts.
253.40s: So pretty massive call, oh, I just realized,
256.28s: I got a little thing on the screen there,
257.56s: gotta get that off.
259.12s: And I, I mean, this just hasn't been super active.
263.84s: And I'm very curious if this will start
266.68s: to become a little more active
268.40s: in the next couple days or not,
269.92s: based on this new news.
271.20s: I'm gonna keep a very, very close eye
273.64s: because now that that capital, we know it's already been
277.04s: rotated out, at least out of Chewy from the cat.
280.64s: We can see if he's doing anything back in here.
283.12s: The other thing is, I don't think the timing
285.28s: of him releasing that news on Chewy
287.20s: was inconsequential because he has a lot of opportunity
291.72s: in terms of what the window was for the reporting period.
294.36s: He had some time.
295.76s: So I do think that there's a little bit of purpose behind it
298.48s: although a little early to tell what that is just yet.
302.72s: So volatility definitely has ticked up last time I looked
305.68s: at this there literally wasn't anything even over 100.
308.60s: And now we see 111, 161, 100,
310.96s: so plenty of volatility in here.
313.04s: Really, really interesting stuff, I think.
314.96s: So we'll have to keep an eye on any big transactions coming
318.48s: through, we can see 32% of the transactions today
321.08s: were calls and there was 180,000 of them.
323.92s: So that is people starting to get active again
326.32s: based off of the cat news as I would imagine.
329.04s: And the OI tomorrow will become very interesting
332.28s: because take a look at this, the volume 180,000 contracts
336.52s: are literally for the one-nove expiration.
339.56s: So you can see that's good old three days from now.
341.64s: So people are jumping into these near-term options.
345.24s: We can also see in the 15-nove,
347.08s: there's a little bit of build out going on,
348.44s: which is interesting.
349.72s: All right, now let's take a peek at DGT.
352.52s: And I also have a position on in here
354.76s: that I entered into a little while back,
356.76s: just based on the movement.
358.44s: This was not cheap in terms of a wall perspective.
360.60s: It was actually quite expensive.
362.04s: But it just looked generally interesting to me.
364.64s: And now it's still holding over 55.
367.76s: This is a parabolic move.
370.12s: It's gone from 11.75, essentially, to 55.
373.80s: And it's done that from the 24th of September until today.
379.04s: So it a month, absolutely, absolutely maddening move.
383.84s: Take a look at the volume today, 167 million.
388.00s: And if you take a look at the five-day average volume,
390.72s: it's 85 mil against what is it for the 20, 51 mil?
395.92s: So just explosion in volume.
399.40s: For me, this is a highly speculative play
401.88s: that I actually have to update a couple candle alerts here.
407.08s: Because for me, I'm just following it up.
409.08s: I've already taken a pretty meaningful part
411.32s: of the position down on the 28th.
414.52s: And what's left now are just runners.
417.36s: There are things that I can essentially let go to zero
419.84s: if I want.
420.36s: And I still would be sitting on a very significantly sized
423.56s: winner in here, which will do a trade wrap up on it
426.76s: when it's done.
427.60s: If you're interested in the trade in DJT,
429.24s: let me know.
430.08s: Happy to talk more about it.
431.08s: But it's just in progress.
432.44s: So I don't know exactly where it's going to go yet.
435.04s: So volatility is 327% 100% IVP.
440.72s: So absolutely jacked to the tits.
444.32s: And the call and put volume in here is about even.
448.16s: And I think this is people seeing this insane move.
451.56s: And we're starting to see people stepping in front of it
453.80s: to take it to the downside.
455.04s: Because the reality here is that there's
458.04s: been no real fundamental change in the value of the company,
462.28s: the profitability of the company, what the company's doing.
464.48s: So this is generally pure speculation
468.12s: and a proxy for an election outcome, which we don't exactly
471.96s: know what that's going to look like just yet.
473.72s: Let's take a look at the open interest for it.
478.80s: Yeah, exactly.
479.40s: So people are starting to play it more to the downside.
481.36s: There's 608,000 puts for 36 on the call side.
485.20s: And I have to be honest, even from my own perspective,
488.40s: I'm getting to the point where I probably
490.16s: will look to reverse the position not all too late.
493.12s: Because there's also the unknown on how this is going
496.00s: to act if Trump wins, which right now he's favored,
498.72s: what this will look like.
500.24s: And because even if you blins, it doesn't magically
503.16s: make this company have different fundamentals.
505.40s: I think right now, this is truly behaving as a meme stock
507.96s: with a lot, a lot of fervor behind it.
510.20s: And it wouldn't surprise me to see people trying to short it
512.76s: here.
513.76s: You can already see it's hard to borrow.
514.76s: So we'll have to do a little bit of digging
516.36s: to see just what the internals of it look like.
518.68s: But I mean, another what?
520.08s: Almost 10% A, 8 and 3 quarter.
521.96s: So massive, massive move here.
523.88s: So tons of opportunity, literally,
525.92s: options changed with 450% IV.
528.80s: The only thing I would notice people are coming in here
530.56s: saying, oh, I want to sell puts, oh, I want to sell calls.
534.24s: The problem with selling options in something like this
537.28s: is you have to remember.
538.64s: If you're selling puts or if you're selling calls,
541.04s: those are still directional traits.
544.08s: People have gotten way too used to the if IV is high sell
547.72s: if it's low by.
549.00s: There's still a delta component to these traits.
551.60s: So if this thing continues to move crazily,
554.12s: it doesn't matter if IV is high, it's pinned at 100.
556.80s: Guess what?
557.56s: It can stay there for a while.
559.04s: When IV is that high, it means the underlying is moving
563.88s: a lot, which is not good for short single options
567.44s: with undefined risk.
568.64s: So something to keep in mind.
570.24s: As always, if there's anything you need,
571.60s: let me know, be an outliner and see you later.
