0.56s: what's up outliers we got a quick market
2.32s: update with three things on the agenda
4.36s: we're going to talk about Nike's
5.92s: earnings and how things are moving after
8.04s: hours because there's probably a trade
10.12s: to be had tomorrow we're going to talk
12.48s: about the current state of affairs in
14.88s: the Middle East touching really quick
16.72s: mostly on the market impacts but giving
18.64s: an update on what's going on there and
20.56s: then we're going to touch on Nvidia
22.84s: really fast because we saw some really
25.04s: interesting price movement there as well
27.44s: today and then for the gme folks my
29.52s: fellow Apes don't worry we will have a
31.32s: GameStop video out tomorrow uh a couple
34.08s: things popped up today that I really
35.52s: want to cover from a broader Market
37.24s: perspective but I obviously have not
40.52s: forgotten about you okay so let's get
42.44s: into this what's going on first and
44.20s: foremost first I guess the easiest not
46.76s: so much foremost but the easiest is uh
49.32s: Nike so Nike did have earnings and it
52.96s: had a bit of a pullback so if we take a
56.36s: look after hours as it sits now Nike
59.28s: closed at 8 93 and right now it's
61.48s: trading right around
63.36s: 84 so not a massive drop not an
66.72s: inconsequential drop we're looking you
68.92s: know right now about 5% is depending on
72.32s: how we choose to open tomorrow and
75.96s: Nike's been struggling for a little bit
77.56s: right last earnings came in also quite
79.80s: soft comparatively so if we take a look
82.68s: it came in 99 EPS versus 85 cents so it
86.24s: beat but take a look at the guidance
88.36s: Market did not like the guidance
90.00s: cratered and then if we take a look at
92.04s: today it came in at 7 cents versus 51
95.72s: cents so again beat on EPS pretty well
99.76s: but it's the guidance again that plagues
103.04s: us not the deployment within EPS for
106.40s: that specific quarter so what happened
109.12s: here well we can see that there's the
111.52s: article here is talking about sluggish
113.08s: demand and it says that we also have
117.96s: John donaho is stepping down on 13
122.68s: October this happened uh last month but
126.36s: I think that there's just a bit of
127.52s: turmoil that's what this is highlighting
129.12s: is that there's change going on and we
131.68s: need to see a bit of a transition and
134.00s: again you can see that highlighting here
136.20s: so I'll read this to you this is from
138.04s: the executive VP and the CFO it says a
141.20s: comeback at this scale takes time but we
143.12s: see early wins from momentum in Key
145.16s: sports to accelerating our PR of new our
148.24s: pace of newness and Innovation our teams
151.56s: are energized as Elliot Hill returns to
154.52s: lead Nike's next stage of growth so
158.76s: overall they're talking about a bit of a
161.16s: turnaround Cinderella story but you can
162.76s: see down here H the numbers don't lie
165.68s: typically right so net income came in
167.76s: 1.05 billion. 7 cents per share and it
171.72s: essentially came in at 1.45 billion
174.92s: year-over-year and again it's really
176.32s: important to compare year-over-year
177.56s: because there's a lot of seasonality
179.40s: differences
180.48s: so this is the kiss of death here sales
184.64s: starting to contract now I want to be
186.08s: clear when I say kiss of death I don't
187.36s: mean Nikes going bankrupt anything like
189.08s: that but this is the market doesn't like
191.00s: this we do not like seeing sales go down
194.24s: and we can tolerate a lot of stuff if
197.64s: sales and pipeline still looks okay but
200.40s: this does not so what does this look
202.80s: like for tomorrow well for me this
205.20s: actually looks like probably a great
207.84s: open entry to trade down move because my
210.80s: guess is that we're going to see a bit
211.92s: of a Down move tomorrow obviously we'll
214.24s: probably gap down a little bit on the
215.92s: open but my expectation is that there
218.00s: would be a little bit of a continuation
220.20s: for me these kinds of Trades are very
221.88s: very short term I'm not looking to stay
223.76s: in the trade much longer than a day I
225.96s: will look to trade the prolonged down
228.56s: move in this instance probably a little
231.08s: more actively because we can see that I
233.84s: mean it's been in a bit of a decline for
235.40s: the last six months let's take a look at
236.76s: the last year yeah I mean it's been
238.12s: contracting so I actually wouldn't mind
239.96s: holding this to the downside for a
241.40s: little bit longer um as I look at this
244.04s: but it'll probably be a relatively
245.96s: short-term trade overall looks
247.76s: interesting to me okay so now let's
250.16s: pivot over and talk about what's
252.28s: happening from a bit more of a macro
254.24s: perspective and for this I'm actually
256.36s: going to pull up the Futures so that you
259.04s: can see a few things happening here the
262.08s: e- minis had a bit of a down day qes
264.52s: down Russell down vix up so what's
268.08s: happening right now actually is is a few
270.76s: events coming together we do have some
273.84s: disturbances going on in the Middle East
276.96s: which we can talk about now and it's
279.48s: mostly between Israel and kind of its
282.88s: neighbors that Israel tends to struggle
284.96s: with so you can see down here Israel
287.08s: began a limited ground assault into
288.72s: Lebanon Iran launched a ballistic
291.04s: missile attack I'm not covering live
293.72s: news of the war or the conflict in and
296.08s: of itself although I follow that stuff
297.88s: very closely from my military background
300.16s: the main thing I'm approaching this
301.56s: dialogue from is from a market
303.16s: perspective so you have this going on we
305.88s: also have the strike that just started
307.76s: that looks like it's probably not going
309.52s: to be a massive impact just yet if it
312.48s: can be contained but that does add
315.44s: pressure to things so right now if we
318.16s: look across the market in general things
320.96s: are a bit mixed and we did see some
324.80s: decent economic data come in so right
327.48s: here you can see job openings they Rose
330.80s: 329k to 84 804 million so labor market
335.96s: generally looks okay because you can see
337.92s: the expectation there and then we can
339.88s: also see manufacturing though came in
342.52s: lighter than expected so this continues
345.04s: to go down the path of mixed news so
348.64s: what does this mean shortterm volatility
350.48s: that's essentially it there are things
351.56s: that are performing very well right now
353.28s: there are things that are not performing
354.64s: very well the name of the game for me is
357.12s: to kind of discern between them pretty
360.24s: carefully this goes over to the strike
364.56s: as we talked about so you can see that
367.44s: um ports from Maine to Texas shut down
370.28s: and this is the first strike since 1977
372.60s: they were asking for like a
374.32s: 77% pay increase I think and they were
376.76s: granted I want to say up to a 50% pay
379.60s: increase which is pretty good yeah down
381.04s: here so the opening offer 77% pay raise
385.44s: over a six-year contract um the base
388.76s: salary is 8 1K and I mean I don't know
393.04s: seems like a lot I don't know Monday
395.00s: evening the alliance says that it
396.28s: increased its offer to 50% raises over 6
399.52s: years so still 25% off of this so this
403.20s: is like a actually kind of a pretty big
404.80s: deal and we can see but take a look down
407.44s: here this is what I thought was
408.92s: interesting so we can see that Joe Biden
411.96s: under the 1947 Taft heartley act could
415.56s: seek a court order for an 80-day cooling
417.92s: off period that would suspend the
420.08s: strike um and they essentially
422.76s: approached him with his said are you
423.84s: thinking about doing this and he said no
425.84s: and he
426.80s: says because it's collective bargaining
429.40s: and I don't believe in Taft Harley
432.52s: interesting so the name of the game now
434.64s: for this is to monitor impact because
437.08s: it's early stages I definitely would
439.00s: offer that what we're seeing in the
440.68s: Middle East is a much higher near-term
442.60s: impact we can see that represented in
444.16s: crude oil flying off the handle today
446.64s: and we can even see things like gold
448.64s: starting to show a little a little bit
449.80s: of life well a little bit more life I
451.72s: should say it's been doing really well
453.60s: but starting to take up a little bit
455.08s: more okay last thing I want to cover is
458.40s: a look at Nvidia and Nvidia today was
461.44s: actually kind of interesting so if we
463.44s: take a peak in here we can see that it
465.76s: was down 3.66% and it's down again after
469.96s: hours to 116 so this I think is topical
474.72s: because this starts to look like a
477.32s: failed Trend reversal to me it's too
480.00s: early to tell but we have a high we have
482.60s: a lower high we have a lower high and
485.28s: now so far we have another lower high
488.68s: the thing that started to look like a
490.08s: bit of a reversal was we had a low a
493.04s: higher low depending on where this goes
496.00s: this could show a higher low and that
498.16s: starts to kind of push us into this tiny
500.88s: little range that then a breakout
503.60s: normally will occur one way or the other
506.40s: but we're starting to get scrunched way
509.04s: down in here as we're moving along and
512.36s: this failed new high I think is kind of
514.60s: important to keep an eyeball on because
516.36s: if we take a look across the q's in
519.96s: general we saw Q's break a new high here
524.12s: and now it's starting to fall back into
526.28s: this range so across technology RIT
529.96s: large we're kind of seeing this cycle
532.08s: where technology is still struggling to
534.16s: some degree in order to form back to
538.16s: near-term high recovery which is just
539.96s: not there yet so overall thought that
542.48s: was interesting right now markets are
544.68s: fascinating tomorrow's YouTube live
546.24s: stream will be about trading meme stocks
548.52s: we're going to take a look at a watch
549.64s: list that I've been building and
550.72s: hopefully look at some trades together
552.96s: um I want to model a portfolio for that
555.20s: I think that'll be fun for the Wednesday
556.56s: series as always if there's anything you
557.96s: want me to take a look at let me know be
559.36s: an outlier I'll see youall later
