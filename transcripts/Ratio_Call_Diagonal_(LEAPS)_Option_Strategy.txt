0.56s: what's up to all the outliers eric here
2.48s: i got a video for you today on the ratio
5.76s: diagonal option strategy that i run very
8.56s: frequently you will also hear me refer
11.04s: to it as the call leaps diagonal because
13.84s: i do trade it to the call side more
15.52s: often than the put side and leaps are
18.08s: very commonly a part of the equation but
19.76s: not always
20.88s: so i have a series that's actually
23.52s: really in depth on this my goal for this
26.16s: video is to provide a 65 to 70
30.64s: level of depth overview however in one
33.52s: video so i'm looking to pack a lot of
36.56s: information into this one video so it's
38.88s: easier for people to find the strategy
40.64s: because it is one of my favorites so
43.36s: let's do a quick overview of what is a
46.72s: diagonal in general
48.80s: and then what is the ratio diagonal
51.84s: so in short a diagonal is very very
55.04s: similar to a covered call and the main
58.56s: difference is instead of using long
61.12s: stock you use long calls
64.56s: that's pretty much it
66.24s: so it's also still
68.40s: similar to a calendar in that it's
70.40s: typically across different expirations
72.96s: however it's different than a calendar
75.12s: because it's not typically at the same
77.76s: strike for the long call to short call
80.08s: so quick synopsis the ratio diagonal has
83.52s: two parts a long call and a short call
86.72s: typically the long call will be further
88.64s: out in time the short call will be
90.48s: nearer in time although it doesn't have
92.32s: to be that way
94.00s: and then the big difference the in the
96.56s: way that i traded as
98.88s: introduced to me by my mentor the guy
101.12s: that i reference very frequently i bring
103.36s: it up simply because this trade was not
105.28s: my idea it's it's his and i'm not gonna
108.24s: take credit for it i do have my own
110.16s: tweaks to the strategy but it is not my
112.32s: own
113.12s: so anyways with that out of the way the
115.76s: main reason why trading it i like to
118.40s: trade it at a ratio is it has a very
121.44s: different and in my opinion more
123.92s: advantageous risk reward profile so
126.40s: let's take a look at what a normal
128.08s: diagonal looks like we're going to be
129.76s: looking at vlo this is actually what i'm
131.76s: going to run an example um back and
134.16s: forth as we go through the content
136.16s: because i actually recently put a trade
138.88s: on in via vlo leveraging the strategy so
141.68s: i thought it was a good fit
143.28s: okay
144.56s: so first let's take a look at the risk
147.92s: profile this is what a normal or typical
152.48s: diagonal will look like we have risk to
154.88s: the downside the max risk to the
157.60s: downside will be the debit you've paid
160.40s: and then we see this kind of triangle
163.44s: shape where our max profit is
166.24s: and then if it starts moving up too far
170.08s: then we actually start to have upside
172.08s: risk and what's happening here is the
175.28s: long call delta is being overwhelmed by
179.60s: the expanding short call delta
183.52s: that's all it is but that's where your
185.52s: upside risk comes from in a typical
188.32s: diagonal
189.52s: now this is kind of my take on the
192.80s: diagonal and you'll see it is a very
196.08s: different risk to reward profile
198.40s: namely
199.52s: if we keep going to the right you'll
201.76s: notice that there's no max upside and
205.28s: there's no upside risk whatsoever i only
207.84s: have risk to the downside
209.84s: so similar to the traditional diagonal
213.04s: my downside risk is going to be capped
215.76s: to the debit i paid to enter the
217.84s: position
218.96s: now the reason why
221.04s: i have this upside or this upward
224.72s: sloping angle is i am selling these
228.16s: short calls at a ratio to the long calls
232.16s: so what you see down here is an actual
234.08s: trade that i had on and i had six long
237.60s: calls but only three short calls and
241.44s: we'll get into the different kinds we
242.96s: can structure the ratios in a little bit
244.80s: but suffice it to say at least for the
247.04s: example that if we have fewer short
250.24s: calls
251.20s: than our long calls we can eliminate
254.88s: upside risk and we can also uncap it so
258.32s: that it's unlimited now there's some
260.00s: caveats to that in terms of where we
262.56s: place the short call in relation to the
264.88s: long call and things like that we'll get
266.40s: into a little bit of that detail in a
267.76s: little bit
268.80s: um but that's the the general idea here
272.64s: by
273.84s: trading the short at a ratio to a long
276.88s: we get rid of this scenario we
279.04s: appreciate to the upside very similar to
282.16s: a covered call
284.16s: but it's even like doing a ratio covered
286.32s: call where we have more long stock than
288.48s: the short calls we're selling against it
290.64s: so
291.92s: this is the breakdown now let's get over
295.28s: here and start getting into detail now
297.84s: it's gonna look a little wordy on the
299.36s: screen i have a lot of talking notes but
301.28s: don't worry i will be flipping back and
303.36s: directing your attention where it should
304.96s: be so let's get right to it so
307.52s: as for any strategy i like to have a
309.84s: couple buckets that i outline this is
312.72s: again my preferred approach for
316.00s: outlining a strategy it's called a
317.44s: strategy outline they're kind of
318.96s: individual sections that fit into my
320.64s: broader trading plan so these are
322.56s: excerpts from my strategy outline for
325.20s: you all and i'm always going to start
327.28s: with the executive summary get into the
329.12s: setup how we're actually going to set
330.72s: this trade up the management of the
332.24s: trade and then i'm also going to run you
333.52s: through some tips and tricks throughout
335.20s: the video okay so let's talk about the
337.92s: setup we already talked about the
339.20s: executive summary what the strategy is
341.52s: so for the setup
342.96s: essentially we're going to be applying
344.96s: whatever long stock analysis criteria
348.72s: you typically
350.40s: apply to your long stock positions now
354.08s: the criteria in the analysis is going to
357.36s: differ by time frame because
360.48s: for the long call side of the trade
362.64s: which is kind of like the base of the
364.32s: trade
365.44s: i go anywhere from 90 days to expiration
368.80s: out to the max allowable
371.60s: in the case with vlo you'll notice that
374.80s: i was out to 20 jan 23. so if we pull up
378.72s: the options chain you can see that that
380.48s: was
381.48s: 257 days out
383.92s: there's a couple ways you can think
385.52s: about the days to expiration the longer
389.04s: days you give the trade the lower your
392.16s: theta decay is going to be regardless of
394.72s: the delta but the delta will amplify how
397.68s: much we can reduce the theta decay so
400.00s: that's the first thing the second thing
401.84s: is you give the trade more time to work
404.48s: instead of having to be right in 90 days
407.36s: we can be right in 200 plus days
410.48s: now the downside it's more expensive so
413.76s: again using this example when i entered
416.00s: the trade it was trading around 31 or
418.88s: something like that
420.40s: if i look at it now let's just use the
423.04s: current price so it's easier right now
425.36s: the 80
427.76s: in the 80 call that's deep in the money
430.72s: right now it's at 87 delta again we'll
432.80s: don't worry too much about those details
434.40s: yeah we'll get to it just want to talk
435.68s: about the price
436.88s: right now it's trading for call it 5130.
439.68s: if i look at something that's expiring
441.96s: 131 days out again let's look at that
444.88s: same
445.84s: um
446.96s: 87 delta which would be the 95 call in
450.16s: this case that's trading for 30 you know
453.36s: six dollars so you get the point it's
456.16s: much more expensive the further out in
457.84s: time you go especially because i like to
459.68s: trade these deep in the money which is
462.32s: really the next point here there's a few
465.04s: reasons why i like to trade them deep in
466.80s: the money meaning an 80 delta plus i'm
469.44s: gonna lower the theta decay as i
471.12s: mentioned because as you all should know
474.48s: theta decay is the highest for at the
477.04s: money options
478.88s: and it obviously accelerates as we get
480.96s: closer to expiration so we're doing two
482.96s: things to decrease the theta decay we're
485.68s: going far out in time and then we are
488.08s: also going deep in the money and if we
490.72s: take a look at the theta decay
493.20s: it's
494.08s: less than a penny a day essentially it's
496.40s: so far in the money what happens is
498.00s: thinkorswim actually has an issue
499.76s: calculating it so as you can see out
502.16s: here it's two cents a day two cents a
503.76s: day one cent a day this isn't two cents
505.60s: a day this will be under um
508.72s: under a penny or a penny and change
511.68s: so there's two things we're doing to
513.20s: really limit the theta decay we also
515.52s: experience lower vega which is also
518.64s: important because depending on how we
520.80s: structure the strategy although change
522.72s: in volatility might be helpful to us we
525.12s: don't want it hurting us so it
527.92s: assists with that as well and then the
529.92s: last thing is by going with a higher
531.52s: delta we
532.84s: enjoy more of a move of the underlying
536.00s: because again if we're buying an 80
538.80s: delta call for every one dollar option
541.68s: for every one dollar move in the
542.96s: underlying those options are going to
544.24s: move by 80 cents all things being equal
547.68s: so that's super important for this
550.16s: strategy to make money for us if you go
553.12s: really far out of the money you might be
555.36s: able to again um appreciate more
558.72s: compounding of your debit paid to entry
562.40s: but you're not gonna make the same gross
564.56s: number of dollars so that's why i like
567.04s: to go with a higher delta it's gonna
569.12s: lower our theta lower vega and then
571.12s: we're gonna enjoy more of a move in the
572.64s: underlying
573.84s: okay so let's move on to just some of
576.00s: the background of the trade max profit
578.88s: technically should be undefined there
580.88s: are instances where if we sell at a
582.96s: one-to-one ratio
584.72s: we might have a defined upside trade so
587.44s: for example if i start adding more short
589.76s: calls in this hypothetical scenario and
591.76s: i go
592.64s: six to six
594.08s: so this means one to one i have six
596.00s: longs six shorts notice how we still
598.80s: have that kind of you know peak that you
600.88s: saw in the other more traditional
602.72s: diagonal but there's still no upside
604.48s: risk it's just capped now
607.28s: meaning we can't make more in
610.40s: more money essentially anything above
612.32s: 148 on
614.16s: so
615.52s: that is
616.84s: um a scenario where we could have capped
620.00s: upside risk which would be somewhere
621.92s: around the short call
623.36s: um but in general it should be undefined
625.60s: if we're structuring it
627.36s: max loss is going to be your debit paid
629.12s: and that's going to be at expiration
631.44s: there's two things that we're looking
632.72s: for this is the primary thing we want
634.96s: the stock to go up in price we're
636.72s: trading this just like a covered call
638.56s: ideal scenario is the underlying blows
642.64s: through our short calls and we're seeing
645.20s: a loss on those short calls that's
646.96s: perfect scenario
648.56s: a lot of people get really confused
650.24s: about that with covered calls thinking i
652.00s: wanted to be below my short strike or
654.56s: before below the short call and it's a
657.04s: misconception it's just a mental block
660.08s: because they don't want to have a trade
661.52s: that's technically
662.80s: a part of the trade that's technically
664.40s: losing but max profit rest assured is
666.72s: the higher it goes
668.80s: and then the other scenario that does
671.12s: help the strategy is if implied
673.60s: volatility expands now again we're going
675.60s: to be
676.40s: we're going to experience lessened
678.08s: sensitivity to it because of the way we
680.24s: structure the trade to reduce vega but
681.76s: nonetheless if we go from iv percentile
685.04s: that's 10 and it goes to 60 your leaps
688.72s: will appreciate somewhat in value
691.12s: so that is the other scenario so one of
693.84s: the first hurdles i'm going to be
695.76s: looking for when i'm looking for this
698.00s: trade is i want to see something that
700.48s: i'm bullish in and if you need some
703.04s: ideas on how i like to apply fundamental
705.60s: technical analysis i have a whole
706.88s: playlist on it so feel free to go check
708.72s: that out
709.76s: because i'm not going to go super far
711.12s: into detail
712.32s: in the interest of your time but anyways
715.28s: that's from a technical standpoint but
717.28s: i'm also going to look for implied
718.56s: volatility ideally to be a little bit
720.32s: lower so that i have the the
723.36s: exposure to enjoy if implied volatility
727.04s: actually expands that helps the position
730.00s: okay so let's talk through really the
732.00s: four main steps to entering this trade
733.84s: and then i'm going to give you some
734.80s: detail on all of these in the meantime i
736.96s: am going to throw out some of these tips
739.28s: and tricks uh so that we can kind of
741.12s: talk about it as we go
742.88s: now one of the things that i do want to
744.40s: talk about up front is this right here
747.84s: the ratio trade-off
749.92s: so when we're structuring this trade
752.08s: there's a couple ways to look at it
754.24s: if i
755.44s: buy six and sell three i'm gonna make a
759.20s: certain amount of money
761.28s: if
762.16s: i sell
764.00s: six against my long six
766.96s: the amount of money i'm gonna make up
768.80s: front
769.68s: increases because instead of getting
772.80s: three
773.76s: credits for whatever the premium is of
775.76s: the option i'm gonna get six of them
777.92s: so it's super important to think about
780.08s: the trade-off here
781.76s: if you sell more
784.08s: short calls against the longs you're
785.92s: gonna collect more money up front and
788.24s: you're gonna give away
790.08s: upside potential
791.76s: and then the inverse is true if you sell
794.80s: fewer short calls you're going to
797.12s: collect less money up front
799.44s: and give up less upside potential so you
802.56s: can apply that thought process
804.32s: throughout the life cycle of the trade
805.84s: if you want to wait collecting more
807.92s: money up front then sell more or sell
810.32s: more aggressively closer to the money or
812.08s: your basis
813.20s: if that's not the case then consider
815.20s: selling less so that you can enjoy more
817.04s: of the upside totally up to you
819.44s: so
820.40s: it's important to think about that
821.52s: trade-off early
823.20s: another super important part of the
825.44s: setup is
826.84s: liquidity it is so important to check
830.32s: the liquidity especially on the long
833.52s: calls or puts the further out in time
836.40s: you go so one of my favorite ways to do
838.48s: that is to check out the bid ask spread
840.56s: as well as the open interest so if
842.88s: you'll notice here the open interest
845.04s: there's you know 1800 contracts which is
847.52s: pretty deep
848.72s: and for something that's 257 days out
852.40s: there's a 60 cent wide bid ask spread
854.88s: that is very liquid
856.40s: especially for something that's 130
859.36s: this is so important to check because if
861.68s: you find something let's say if it was
863.84s: the same trade you know vlo same
866.56s: everything but this was ten dollars wide
869.92s: big problem same thing if we look at
872.72s: some of these shallow open interest
875.76s: um
876.88s: strikes right so if i look at this 35
879.12s: call there's
880.80s: eight of them and if i look at the 30
882.64s: call there's four of them and then if we
884.40s: look at the 25 there's zero so liquidity
887.76s: can absolutely become an issue trading
890.56s: liquid underlyings is super important
892.72s: for this strategy because otherwise you
894.88s: might be able to worm your way into the
896.64s: strategy but you can get stuck pretty
898.88s: bad if you can't exit the trade for a
901.84s: profit even if it's showing a good
903.52s: profit you might not be able to get out
905.36s: so liquidity is so important here the
908.00s: other thing is the products that you're
909.44s: trading again i'm not going to go super
911.04s: far in a product selection but in
912.80s: general i'm going to be looking at index
915.28s: etfs sector etfs s p 500 stocks things
919.44s: like that i absolutely will trade this
922.40s: in more speculative products as well
924.56s: it's not limited to those but the reason
926.64s: why i bring that up is especially if
928.64s: we're applying the leaps side of things
930.72s: meaning we're going really far out in
932.24s: time i want it to be something i'm
934.08s: comfortable holding for a long period of
935.68s: time
936.80s: all right
937.76s: with all of that let's talk about the
940.08s: actual steps to setting this trade up
942.96s: first off portfolio review and allocate
945.68s: this is what i do for every single trade
947.44s: i'm gonna look at the portfolio see what
949.12s: i need see what gaps i have and then
951.52s: also to gain some information in terms
953.44s: of where i can add risk where i can't
955.28s: things like that
956.56s: then i'm going to allocate what this
958.48s: means is i am going to set aside a
961.12s: certain amount of money for my portfolio
963.52s: that i'm going to apply to this trade so
965.76s: for this specific trade in vlo i'll even
968.80s: show you the little excel sheet that i
970.24s: have here i was setting aside 25 000
973.60s: for that trade i do that up front to
976.56s: avoid any conflict of emotional interest
979.28s: over the life cycle of the trade i like
981.44s: to do it before the trade is on when my
983.20s: mind is very clear that i've found to be
986.32s: a great practice and then the outlay so
989.60s: this is what i'm going to initially
992.16s: offer the trade that's my initial outlay
995.68s: so again using the current example in
998.08s: vlo
999.28s: i
1000.40s: allocated twenty five thousand dollars
1002.72s: the initial outlay was nineteen thousand
1005.60s: and twenty dollars so i used seventy six
1008.72s: percent of my allocation for the trade
1012.00s: and what i allow for that varies over
1014.24s: time but again for the sake of this uh
1017.20s: conversation it's just super important
1019.12s: to differentiate between what you're
1020.96s: offering to the trade what the outlay is
1023.44s: the reason why i like to break it up
1024.96s: that way is because it allows me to
1026.56s: scale into the trade over the life cycle
1029.04s: of the trade meaning if it goes in my
1030.56s: favor or against me i will evaluate the
1033.52s: product and look at committing more
1035.44s: capital if it's moving against me and i
1038.80s: add a little bit more risk it's a good
1040.72s: way to manage my basis same thing to the
1043.28s: upside if i'm getting a move in my favor
1046.00s: and i add a little bit of risk that can
1048.08s: actually help me a lot by keeping my
1050.88s: overall basis a little bit lower while i
1052.80s: gain more exposure
1054.32s: so what i typically use for that is
1056.00s: around a five percent move i'm going to
1058.08s: take a look at it and then decide do i
1060.48s: want to scale in more or not simple as
1063.12s: that
1064.72s: so now that we have the
1066.96s: allocation set aside for the trade we're
1069.20s: gonna figure out we might have already
1071.20s: had the trade identified what product we
1073.44s: wanted to enter but then we're gonna
1075.68s: apply our screens to it so again
1078.40s: checking things like that liquidity
1080.72s: i'm also going to apply my typical
1082.56s: technical analysis fundamental analysis
1084.56s: for a bullish trade so i'm going to look
1087.44s: at moving averages across different time
1089.52s: frames the time frame should correspond
1092.48s: to what i'm looking at so for example
1095.28s: in this vlo trade since i was 257 days
1098.08s: out i started pretty far out and i
1100.88s: zoomed in so i actually started with the
1102.96s: two year daily to get a broader sense of
1105.04s: it
1105.68s: zoomed in to a one year to again make
1108.00s: sure that i'm still in an upward sloping
1110.08s: linear regression channels the moving
1112.24s: averages were aligned as i wanted them
1114.32s: earnings was looking good quarter over
1116.80s: quarter all of those sorts of things
1119.76s: so
1120.48s: when when all that's done you decide
1122.32s: that this is a good product for you you
1123.68s: like it then we got to structure the
1125.20s: trade so we're going to look at the long
1128.24s: side first and then the short side for
1130.48s: the long side you got to pick what base
1132.48s: expiration you want to run what delta
1134.80s: you're going to use which is typically
1136.24s: easy 0.80 or higher and then what size
1139.84s: and again even this is pretty easy based
1141.92s: on your allocation and then how you want
1144.16s: to consider your initial outlay i
1146.16s: typically don't like using more than 80
1148.88s: of the allocation on the initial outlay
1151.52s: a lot more times is closer to 50
1153.92s: but it depends on what i'm trading and
1156.00s: what i'm thinking that's just to give
1157.20s: you some ideas
1158.80s: and then for the short i do like to keep
1161.28s: that shorter
1162.88s: days to expiration than the long so my
1165.44s: long
1166.40s: typically in the shortest scenario would
1168.24s: be 90 days out and that's rare normally
1170.40s: it's six months at least that's a common
1172.72s: time frame six months to a year and
1174.80s: change
1175.76s: the short will be 20 to 40 days to
1177.60s: expiration this is so that i can kind of
1179.36s: churn them out and do my best to stay
1182.24s: sensitive to theta decay because shorter
1185.28s: days to expiration the theta decay curve
1187.84s: accelerates
1189.12s: and another important note is that on
1191.52s: the first
1193.04s: entry sale of those short calls when you
1195.60s: first get into the trade that's when
1197.52s: you're going to make your most money on
1199.44s: the short calls because typically the
1200.96s: market's going to start moving and then
1202.88s: you don't have as much fidelity so i
1205.52s: typically like that 20 to 40 days it's a
1207.76s: sweet spot
1209.28s: and then the other thing to keep in mind
1211.44s: we talked about this ratio before
1214.16s: what i like to do is maintain a specific
1216.56s: delta ratio
1218.08s: so the delta ratio is a way for me to
1220.88s: make sure that i'm not um experiencing
1223.44s: upside risk and uncapping my upside so
1226.64s: to figure out your delta ratio you just
1228.64s: take the number of long calls that you
1230.56s: have multiplied by your delta divide
1233.28s: that by 2.1 times your short call deltas
1238.00s: so this is just making sure that you
1240.16s: have enough long deltas to overwhelm the
1242.96s: short call deltas so again in this
1245.92s: example if we go to the risk profile
1248.96s: you'll see that i have a maximum of long
1252.88s: 600 deltas i have a maximum of short 300
1257.04s: deltas i have 300 excess deltas that's
1260.40s: how i know i have no upside risk and i
1262.48s: have no capped upside this is just a
1264.48s: simple way to keep that kind of um top
1267.76s: of mind easy to think about
1270.16s: and i use a calculator for it so that's
1273.68s: exactly how i figure this figure out
1276.08s: right here
1277.20s: is by using that delta ratio
1281.28s: so
1282.32s: let's talk about the final details here
1286.48s: building a sheet entering the trade
1288.32s: again i showed you my excel sheet the
1290.08s: other more in-depth video i have on this
1292.88s: will go into detail on the excel sheet
1294.80s: so i'm not going to spend a ton of time
1296.40s: on it
1297.68s: but then let's talk about managing this
1299.84s: trade
1300.88s: so there's a couple scenarios that
1303.20s: happen in the life cycle of the trade we
1305.12s: can have the stock trends sideways so
1308.64s: one scenario we can have a scenario
1311.52s: where our short call falls in the money
1314.08s: and we can have a scenario where the
1315.68s: stock drops meaning our short call would
1318.08s: be out of the money and potentially even
1320.40s: even our long call in a worst case
1322.00s: scenario so let's start with the first
1324.32s: this is easy the stock goes sideways
1326.88s: depending on where your short call is
1329.04s: you're just going to harvest it you're
1330.24s: going to wait until it's about 70 max
1332.16s: profit that's what i like to take out of
1333.68s: it
1334.48s: and
1335.44s: take the trade off
1336.88s: if the short call falls in the money
1340.00s: there's two things you can do the
1341.36s: easiest one is to close the entire trade
1344.08s: at a profit it's actually what i did in
1346.08s: vlo
1347.20s: i had a pretty big rally in the
1349.36s: underlying short calls were in the money
1351.36s: i just took the whole thing off
1353.20s: now really important note when you do
1355.52s: choose to take the whole trade off i
1357.76s: typically like to kind of volley back
1360.24s: and forth what i mean by that
1362.16s: is i will sell
1363.92s: one of the long dated options i'm
1367.12s: gauging market liquidity without
1370.08s: offering myself upside risk because what
1372.24s: you don't want to do
1373.60s: is enter or i'm sorry exit all of your
1376.16s: long calls then you have naked short
1378.16s: calls that's a market risk if for
1380.32s: whatever reason at that exact moment or
1383.28s: right around that time the underlying
1385.12s: just runs away this is stupid risk to
1387.68s: take
1388.40s: so i like to exit with one of the long
1391.36s: dated calls find the market make sure
1393.60s: i'm okay exiting at that price
1395.92s: then i will exit all of the short calls
1398.64s: at once and then i will go back to the
1400.88s: long calls and exit the rest of those
1403.52s: accepting the fact that there might be a
1404.96s: little slippage in the time it takes me
1406.64s: to do that but i find that that to be a
1409.76s: really efficient way to get out of the
1411.68s: trade with really no risk because that
1414.88s: scenario i outlined although not likely
1418.40s: it could happen and how angry would you
1420.96s: be
1421.68s: if you entered all of your longs you get
1424.00s: this big rally all of a sudden and now
1426.24s: you have a huge loss that was completely
1428.80s: avoidable i don't want to go through
1430.64s: that that flow so i don't do it
1434.24s: now slightly more complicated scenario
1437.60s: is if you choose
1439.76s: to
1440.64s: sell
1441.92s: close your short calls at a debit
1444.40s: then what i like to use is the long
1446.80s: calls to cover the cost so what i mean
1449.20s: by that is if i have short calls that
1452.16s: are in the money i'm going to figure out
1454.56s: the debit to close those short calls
1457.44s: then i'm going to look at and see how
1459.92s: many long calls i need to sell in order
1463.20s: to cover the cost for those short calls
1466.40s: because what's going to be happening in
1467.68s: this scenario is if you structure the
1469.20s: trade properly the short calls will be
1471.28s: trading at a loss but your long calls
1474.16s: will be trading at a profit so you're
1476.40s: going to be realizing a net profit
1478.72s: overall
1479.76s: so that is exactly why i like to use the
1483.04s: long calls to cover the short the cost
1485.20s: of the short calls
1486.56s: once you do that you have to pay
1489.12s: attention to your critical strike
1491.84s: this is a way for us to see
1494.96s: where we can sell
1496.96s: short calls without locking in a
1499.04s: potential loss
1500.40s: this is a little more complicated so i
1503.04s: don't want you to get turned off at the
1505.28s: site of this
1506.72s: there's a formula it's right over here
1509.28s: but the punch line is the critical
1512.00s: strike lets you know
1513.68s: where you can sell short calls without
1515.92s: locking in a loss
1517.36s: because over the life cycle of the trade
1519.52s: as you add long calls get rid of long
1521.84s: calls add short calls get rid of short
1523.84s: calls
1524.80s: you are moving money in and out of the
1526.48s: account you want to make sure that
1528.64s: you're essentially keeping all short
1531.04s: call sales above your basis just like a
1534.32s: covered call if you're long stock at 100
1537.44s: and you sell a short call at 99
1540.56s: you can lose a dollar obviously not
1542.96s: accounting for the credit received from
1544.24s: the short call but you get the point on
1546.08s: the underlying itself that's all we're
1547.76s: doing here
1549.28s: so
1550.00s: once we calculate that critical strike
1552.24s: it's just telling us where we can sell
1553.84s: short calls if we want to
1555.60s: if the long calls are currently trading
1558.40s: more than your adjusted long call basis
1560.64s: as calculated by your critical strike
1562.96s: you can essentially just trade short
1565.36s: calls wherever you want
1566.88s: now if the long call is trading below
1570.00s: your adjusted long call basis
1572.08s: you've got to use your long call basis
1574.40s: which will be higher than where the long
1576.24s: calls are currently trading so that you
1578.32s: don't get stuck and again i have example
1580.48s: videos that run through this and if you
1582.72s: need a refresh
1584.56s: on calculating your critical strike you
1588.00s: can take a look at these two formulas
1589.68s: over here we're going to use our
1591.68s: adjusted long call basis minus wherever
1594.72s: the long calls currently are priced
1596.64s: divided by the current long call delta
1599.28s: plus the stock price that gives you your
1602.16s: critical strike to figure out your
1604.40s: adjusted long call basis this is the
1606.88s: formula down here we're going to take
1609.04s: the long call debit plus any short call
1612.48s: debits to close minus sold to close long
1616.00s: call credits divided by the number of
1618.56s: long calls existing times 100 that
1621.04s: probably makes absolutely no sense to
1622.88s: you right now which is totally fine you
1624.80s: can replay the video to go through the
1626.56s: formulas and if you build it out in an
1628.96s: excel sheet again like i have in those
1631.76s: other videos it starts to make a lot of
1634.24s: sense so to give you a quick look at
1637.28s: what this looks like based on the
1639.52s: current pricing of the trade as i had
1641.20s: modeled it i could sell
1643.20s: up to 4.97 short calls against the long
1647.36s: before i start adding upside risk
1650.40s: obviously you can't sell 4.97 calls so i
1653.44s: round this
1654.40s: down
1655.84s: the other thing you'll see over here is
1657.76s: the adjusted leap basis so this is the
1661.20s: formula as i outlined it over there to
1663.28s: figure out the current basis for the
1664.80s: long calls i use leaps because a lot of
1667.04s: times they are leaps but this is just
1669.28s: long calls
1670.64s: and then the critical strike this is
1672.48s: telling me where i can sell short calls
1674.56s: so in this example my short call is 109.
1677.52s: as long as as long as i'm selling short
1679.60s: calls at 106.65 and above
1682.40s: i am not locking in a loss so again you
1685.36s: can't sell a short call at 106.65 so you
1687.76s: got to round this one up and you can
1690.32s: build your very own version of this
1692.24s: using the formulas over to the left
1694.96s: so i know it's a lot but this is one of
1698.16s: my favorite strategies the ratio
1701.20s: diagonal this is looking at the call
1703.20s: side you can trade them on the put side
1705.28s: as well it's a very similar approach
1707.44s: this video is just about 30 minutes long
1709.68s: so i'ma kill it right here if you have
1712.16s: any questions or anything let me know if
