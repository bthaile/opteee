0.00s: Let's talk about trading earnings with options.
2.80s: Why would you do this?
4.48s: I'm going to walk you through exactly that.
6.56s: I'm going to walk you through the way we can structure different strategies around earnings.
11.76s: And at the end of the video, I'm going to walk you through exactly how I think about trading
16.08s: earnings with options and then some best practices.
18.48s: So what's up everybody?
19.60s: Eric here. We'll come back to all the outliers.
21.60s: Shout out to the Patreon family and the YouTube members with that.
25.04s: Let's get right into it.
26.32s: Let's start off with the hypothesis.
28.48s: I wish I was high on partners.
30.88s: This is why we even bother trading earnings with options.
35.20s: And it's because when we're in an earnings cycle,
38.32s: we're getting a lot of new information.
39.92s: Companies are reporting how they're doing at a point in time.
43.20s: They're giving their details on how they performed over the past quarter.
47.36s: But then what my face is blocking right here is they're also helping us understand the future
54.00s: projections.
54.72s: So we want to have an idea of how this company is going to do going forward.
58.88s: And this helps us with that.
60.88s: So as you can imagine, there's a lot of information wrapped around these events.
66.32s: These are what we like to call binary events.
68.96s: Meaning there can be a big move after this event up or down binary because a lot of information
75.60s: is being released at once.
76.80s: Now, just a quick add-in note.
78.48s: Sometimes some of the details of an earnings report will be leaked early.
83.44s: And you can even kind of find that in the options.
85.28s: It's not super common.
86.16s: It's illegal.
86.72s: But sometimes you can see it.
88.00s: But anyways, when we're talking about earnings releases,
90.00s: there's essentially a calendar that tells us when they're coming.
92.24s: And I can show you that in just a second.
93.60s: And you'll notice here, we have AM or PM.
96.64s: That is when the earnings are going to be announced.
99.52s: So if we come over here to the platform and today is the 12th of May,
103.20s: and we're looking out at an upcoming earnings release.
105.76s: So this is the 16th of May and I see HD, which is Home Depot.
109.68s: So down here, if I highlight that,
112.00s: you can see that this is the Q1 earnings release.
114.56s: And it'll tell you when it's estimated to be announced.
118.00s: So in this case, it's before the market.
119.84s: And if we take a look at a chart,
121.68s: a lot of times you can even see previous earnings releases.
124.64s: And when those were announced,
126.32s: so in this case, the last earnings they announced was on the 21st of February.
130.40s: And that was also before the market.
131.84s: They tend to report around the same time frame each year.
134.96s: So now we know that there's an event coming up with a lot of new information.
138.24s: If you trade options,
139.36s: what should be tinkling in your head is volatility.
141.60s: Because that's what's going on here.
142.96s: As we're coming into an earnings release,
144.80s: implied volatility is going to start to expand.
148.16s: The reason why it expands is there's an expectation of new information
153.52s: that could significantly move the product.
155.60s: That's the nature of implied volatility,
157.20s: fallward looking volatility.
158.80s: So what you'll notice is typically about two weeks
161.52s: into the earnings release,
162.72s: we will see implied volatility start to expand slowly.
166.16s: Now, if you could isolate all other variables,
168.64s: this would be much easier to see.
170.16s: But as you know, markets move.
171.68s: So sometimes this movement could be hampered by different things.
175.68s: This is not just my own observations,
178.00s: although I do track a very large data set on earnings plays.
181.28s: But this is also very well studied.
183.20s: If you look up SSRN, earnings releases,
185.36s: I have a bunch of links to throwing here in the notes for you to check out on different papers that I like.
189.36s: But the punchline here is this release will start to spur IV expansion.
194.48s: And if we take a look, I'm actually curious what Home Depot is doing over the last few weeks.
198.64s: We're just starting to get into the window,
200.48s: essentially when implied volatility will start to expand.
203.28s: So you can kind of see this uptick about two weeks ago
206.24s: and there could have been other things going on as well.
208.00s: But nonetheless, I assume that that would be part of that expansion
210.96s: from what we saw over here.
212.32s: And one of the things that's really useful for traders to be aware of
215.68s: is this idea of an unexpected move.
217.52s: This kind of helps us conceptualize what we think,
220.32s: the expected implied volatility is telling us the underlying might move.
224.32s: So for example, if we pull up something like Home Depot,
226.88s: which again has earnings coming up on the 16th before the market had over here to trade,
231.60s: what we want to do is we want to go to the expiration cycle,
234.64s: the closest expiration cycle that has the earnings event in it.
238.72s: That part's really important because if it doesn't have the earnings event in it,
241.92s: then the implied volatility is not going to expand for that cycle.
244.96s: So if we pull up this 19 May, we can see this at the money straddle.
249.36s: And then this is essentially how we figure out roughly how much we think it's going to move.
253.44s: So in this case, you would just take the at the money straddle,
255.68s: which is $7.60 over here, call it $7 over here,
259.36s: so about $14.60.
262.00s: So $14.60 move up or down is what's currently being priced in.
266.08s: Now this will adjust as it gets closer.
268.48s: This is just kind of an initial look,
269.92s: and that's a really important note for folks.
271.76s: Because if you start trying to plan all of your earnings plays,
275.04s: let's say on the weekend, because that's when you do your homework,
276.96s: that's okay, but you need to refresh it right before the release,
280.56s: because other things happen in the market.
282.24s: So what you first saw might be impacted by other things,
285.12s: really important to stay close to the event.
287.44s: So one other note here that's kind of a good thing to keep an eye on is the implied volatility
292.72s: for the cycle. So let me switch my camera real quick,
295.52s: so it's easier for you to see.
297.04s: And over here, we have 47.3%, and then notice how implied volatility goes down a lot.
302.88s: 37%, 34%, 32%, 31%, notice how close all of these are to one another,
308.72s: and then how high this one is relative to the others.
311.28s: This tells you something's going on here.
313.28s: And very frequently, you can identify when earnings is coming up,
316.32s: because of something like this.
317.44s: If we pull up something like maybe lows,
319.76s: which is reporting further out in time,
322.08s: they're reporting on the 23rd before the market.
325.68s: Notice how the run, earning cycle,
327.76s: this is a, the front expiration cycle is high,
330.24s: but this doesn't really matter, because it's already passed.
331.84s: But if we take a look at the 19 May expiration cycle,
335.04s: that's only 30%.
336.32s: Then it jumps to 39%, and then down to 36%.
339.60s: Again, sometimes the difference might be smaller,
342.40s: but sometimes it can be pretty significant.
344.16s: And one other quick example, if we pull up Apple,
346.48s: which I have a position on right now,
348.80s: which is a covered or a ratio diagonal,
351.84s: but if we take a look at the Apple implied volatility ratings over here,
355.28s: you can kind of see that it goes from 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%,
359.92s: and this is normal.
360.72s: The reason why this is normal is typically the more time we have,
364.00s: the more volatility we expect there to be,
366.08s: because there's more time for that position to move around and do things.
369.28s: But you'll find an anomaly here where a newer term expiration
372.40s: is higher compared to a later term expiration,
374.48s: and it's typically because there's a reason, like earnings.
376.80s: So about two weeks out, implied volatility is going to start expanding
380.08s: everything else remaining the same.
381.36s: Then after the earnings release,
383.04s: we're going to see a pretty significant contraction in implied volatility.
386.80s: And that's because all the information is now known.
389.52s: We know what's going on.
390.72s: So leading into, there's a lot of anticipation,
393.12s: a bunch of information is going to come out,
394.32s: then boom, there goes the earnings release,
396.48s: and we have all of the information out there,
398.96s: all that implied volatility is going to contract down.
401.36s: And really what's not really is both of these are tradable events.
404.32s: If we're talking about wanting to trade the IV expansion,
407.84s: I'm typically going to try to be long implied volatility.
410.96s: Again, everything else remaining the same.
412.72s: So this is going to be mostly long premium strategies.
415.52s: And then when IV contracts,
417.28s: we're going to want to be short implied volatility,
419.84s: but you have to be short before the release,
422.80s: which will get into in a minute in terms of timing
424.56s: and what specific strategies I use.
426.24s: To give you some ideas for long implied volatility,
428.64s: I'm mostly going to use long straddles.
431.04s: The vast majority of the time personally,
432.80s: that is what I'm going to trade as long straddles.
434.56s: I very, really would trade long singles,
436.48s: but that's if I have potentially a really strong directional hypothesis,
440.32s: but I typically wouldn't in this scenario
442.08s: I'm focusing on the implied volatility first and foremost.
444.48s: So I'm going to default to a straddle.
445.76s: And then after the earnings release,
447.44s: if I have a strong directional hypothesis,
449.68s: short single options, meaning short call short put,
451.92s: again, typically not the case, more often than not,
454.40s: it's going to be a short straddle or strangle.
456.48s: Notice how I don't have strangles over here.
458.56s: I don't tend to buy them leading into the announcement.
461.44s: And that's just because my data set and the way I trade them,
464.32s: I tend to do better with straddles.
465.52s: So I trade those.
466.48s: But after the earnings release,
468.08s: sometimes I do have primarily an implied volatility hypothesis,
472.80s: but I kind of amplify it with the directional bias.
475.36s: So if we use, again, Home Depot for an example,
478.32s: right now it's been pretty range bound,
480.24s: so I don't have any sort of strong directional hypothesis here.
483.60s: But let's just pretend that it actually,
485.84s: this is when it was reporting earnings.
487.44s: And it was reporting earnings after, you know,
489.52s: the next day after this, I would have a little bit of a short bias,
492.24s: just because it generally overextended there.
494.56s: And the momentum it would need to get over this plus two linear regression channel
498.00s: would be pretty significant,
499.04s: could happen after earnings, but nonetheless,
501.12s: that would be just an example of when I would skew them.
503.28s: Now, let's get into this idea of how we actually trade these.
506.80s: And again, you can see that there's two distinct hypothesis here.
509.92s: I have the expansion and contraction.
511.68s: Again, when I'm trading around earnings,
513.28s: that's the primary hypothesis I have.
515.60s: I can amplify it with direction,
517.52s: but just about never would I trade earnings just because of direction,
522.24s: because it's a binary event.
523.52s: The way earnings behave, the reason why they're a binary event
527.28s: is because they move a lot and they can go many cycles in a row
531.36s: where they don't really do anything.
532.48s: Just kind of boring and they're not gapping up or down.
535.20s: And then all of a sudden you can have a release that moves, you know,
538.40s: four times the expected earnings, the biggest ever that happens.
541.60s: That's why there's such false elements.
543.28s: So when we're talking about these two different time frames,
545.52s: you should already know this answer,
546.80s: but when we're trading, I have the expansion,
548.88s: we're going to start about two weeks out.
550.40s: Typically, maybe it would be one week out,
552.24s: and then contraction, it's going to be right around the release.
555.04s: So what I mean by this is when you're trading the implied volatility expansion,
558.48s: it is very, very important, really when you're trading both of these.
561.20s: You have to include the date that has the earnings release.
564.88s: So if we come back over here and we take a look at Om Depot again,
568.00s: if you had traded this 12 May expiration cycle,
570.64s: attempting to trade the expansion and volatility for 19 May,
573.68s: you might see some of it, but not most of it.
576.40s: And it's because the markets are smart.
578.40s: They know this expiration cycle is not exposed to the earnings.
581.68s: So it's not going to have a bunch of volatility applied to it.
584.24s: Whereas this earning cycle will.
586.24s: So it's really important to stay closer,
588.24s: lash to bang,
589.28s: closer to the actual event because this is where our hypothesis lives.
593.20s: Now when we're trading contraction,
595.36s: I typically am going to enter right before the market closes before the release.
606.32s: You're late.
607.36s: So if it's a Tuesday PM announcement, meaning after the close,
611.68s: I would get in Tuesday, right before the close or as close to it as I can,
615.60s: maybe five minutes out if I'm, you know, just trying to get a fill.
618.64s: And then if it's reporting Wednesday morning, same exact time frame, right?
622.00s: That's the same cycle that's going to gain you exposure.
624.48s: And it's going to be the closest expiration that I can find.
626.64s: I already talked to you about the directional structures.
628.72s: This is more just for your general notes.
630.32s: But again, these are really the main trades I'm going to throw on.
634.16s: And more often than not, it will be this one with my really screwed up circle
639.36s: that actually crossed it out.
640.64s: It would be that one for contraction.
642.24s: And then this way for expansion.
643.76s: And again, for me, it's typically not going to be a strangle.
646.48s: It typically would be just a long straddle.
648.56s: And the other, and these are, if there's, these are,
651.84s: directional.
652.64s: So notice how the way I make the straddles and strangle's directional
655.60s: is by including a skew or a ratio, meaning I could trade the 30 delta strangle,
660.72s: but sell more calls than puts.
662.40s: Or I could sell more puts in a straddle than the calls.
665.52s: You can skew these strategies a bit so that it does take a little more of a directional
670.08s: overall disposition.
671.12s: But for non-directional, again, pretty vanilla, long straddles, short straddle
675.60s: strangles, either of those.
676.80s: And then, days of expiration, we want to be closest expiration right after their earnings release.
681.60s: So now I want to talk to you quick about some best practices.
683.60s: The first one is sizing.
684.64s: You got to size these pretty smart, because this is not just my own observations,
689.12s: although I do track a very large data set,
691.52s: our undefined risk strategies.
693.20s: So I tend to size down into earnings.
695.76s: And it's just because things move a lot, and there's a lot of occurrences.
698.64s: So I'm not worried about getting one to be a super great home run.
701.76s: There's a lot that's released in an expiration cycle.
704.64s: The second thing is liquid.
706.08s: Most of the earnings I trade are within the S&P 500,
709.12s: and it's because they're super liquid.
710.48s: I like things that have weak lease, but the liquidity part can't be overstated,
713.92s: because let's say something is a big miss,
715.92s: and it just all goes to hell in a hand basket.
719.68s: If it's illiquid on your way trying to get in,
722.00s: just imagine how tough it is to get out when everybody else is trying to crawl up to the door,
726.24s: when something's going poorly.
727.60s: You get chopped up there.
728.88s: So liquidity is kind of really important in this context.
731.84s: And the other thing to notice around volatility in general,
734.40s: liquidity inherently expands.
736.40s: So you can have something that's liquid,
738.08s: and even before the earnings releases out,
740.32s: we can have this giant expansion and volatility
743.84s: because of the release itself,
745.44s: and that negatively impacts liquidity right out of the gate.
747.92s: P&L defined.
748.64s: This does not mean that I am defining only trading to find P&L
753.28s: or to find risk strategies.
754.48s: Notice how pretty much none of these are.
755.92s: All I'm talking about here is I'm going to have a very clearly defined profit target
760.56s: and loss target that I'm going to manage these trades.
762.72s: More often than not, I'm going to put them on before the close,
765.60s: first, specifically the contraction, which this is most of what I do.
768.48s: I do the expansion, but it's mostly the contraction.
770.80s: So when I'm trading these, I'm going to put it on close to the event,
773.92s: and then after earnings is released,
775.76s: I might give the market a few minutes after the open for the volatility to drain out meaningfully,
780.56s: but after that, I'm getting out.
781.68s: I'm not waiting to see how it does the rest of the day.
784.16s: And it's because there's too many times that something can reverse.
787.20s: There's too many times that something can have a really bad continuation.
790.16s: So sometimes people get really bad confirmation bias.
792.88s: They want to trade an earnings release.
794.32s: They wait until the announcement, and then they hold it all day,
797.76s: because they think they can squeeze out more money.
799.68s: And sometimes you can, but a lot of times it'll reverse.
802.00s: Sometimes you can't.
802.96s: Remember, we're trading the volatility here, not the direction,
805.76s: at least the way I'm structuring these in general.
807.60s: So I'm trading around the volatility of the event.
809.92s: I'm not waiting for the fall through more often than not.
812.24s: Now, one quick note, there is another implied volatility contraction strategy
815.92s: that I do run, which is immediately after the release.
819.36s: This is going to significantly decrease the amount of money you'll collect via premium,
824.24s: but sometimes you can follow along with the direction.
826.64s: So it's a slightly different hypothesis in that scenario.
829.36s: But again, in general, I'm going to trade them like this.
831.92s: Portfolio risk.
832.88s: This is just important to note that if you're trading a bunch of earnings,
835.36s: things can go wrong at once.
836.72s: So be mindful of how different trades interact with one another.
839.92s: Track and watch.
840.80s: This is really important.
842.08s: So I actually maintain a pretty big watch list of different earnings products that I follow
847.84s: so that I get a sense of how they move.
849.52s: So for example, if we come back here to Home Depot,
851.76s: what I might do is I like to go back at least six quarters, preferably eight.
857.20s: And I'll see how it did around earnings.
859.44s: What was the expected?
860.64s: What was the actual earnings per share?
862.32s: What was the close price before the release?
864.64s: What was the open after the release?
866.40s: What was the high price after the release?
868.24s: What was the low price?
869.36s: All of those details give me on text.
871.60s: Notice how I say they don't inform me on what's going to happen.
875.28s: Because again, you can have something that reported a certain way for a long time
878.96s: and then one report at all changes and it's completely different.
881.60s: It gives you some ideas on what to generally expect in a large data sample.
887.36s: So outlier moves are common here.
889.84s: But nonetheless, you can still get an idea of how things tend to move,
893.84s: which is useful for me.
894.72s: Hedging is expensive, which is exactly why most of these do not have legs.
899.20s: But that does not mean never cap your risk if you're super uncomfortable.
903.04s: Just be really thoughtful about how you choose to hedge these strategies.
905.92s: Because again, for example, if we're trading implied volatility contraction,
909.20s: our entire hypothesis is that implied volatility is high compared to the expected
914.88s: historic volatility.
916.00s: So if you're selling options to capitalize on that,
918.80s: but then you're also buying them, what you're buying is relatively expensive.
922.48s: So we want to be careful about how we choose to manage hedging.
927.28s: In general, I won't hedge stuff to the downside.
930.00s: But if I'm trading some sort of tech stock or something like that,
933.20s: I will always consider capping the upside risk.
936.24s: Because most things, if it's a strong stock,
938.88s: it can fall down most of the time sooner or later it'll come back up.
942.00s: But if you are talking about something that is a great earnings release,
945.60s: it can skyrocket up and out super fast.
948.48s: And that can be really difficult to find the door quickly enough.
951.52s: I was just mentioning this IVHV.
953.76s: This is really the entire concept of earnings place.
956.32s: We are assuming that implied volatility is going to be elevated compared to historic
960.96s: volatility. So if we come over here and look at an example,
963.12s: that's what this chart is down here.
964.56s: Yellow is implied.
965.60s: Kind of the white in the gray is historic.
967.92s: And in general, you're going to see implied tracking above historic.
970.88s: But if we go back through, we can come in here and see some of these previous releases.
975.12s: Just for an example, let's take a look at MGM.
978.48s: And we can also take a look at what's another one you guys want to look at.
983.20s: Maybe EA.
985.04s: So let's take a look at MGM and we can see how it did around earnings.
988.56s: So notice here, before earnings implied was tracking above realized,
992.88s: but then after earnings realized actually went over implied.
996.56s: That means that the expected move was not high enough for what the realized move was.
1000.88s: So if you just traded volatility here, this might have been a tricky trade because the move
1005.04s: was bigger than what implied volatility was giving us.
1007.76s: Another quick example is if we pull up maybe EA.
1011.04s: And I don't know how these did.
1011.92s: I'm just kind of pulling up random ones.
1013.20s: This is funny enough.
1014.40s: An example of the inverse.
1015.52s: So we can see earnings was here.
1017.04s: Notice how high implied volatility was leading into the release.
1020.48s: And then after the release, we get this implied volatility crush as it's referred to.
1024.72s: It's just a rapid contraction implied volatility.
1027.04s: And notice how it tracked above historic volatility.
1030.24s: That is the scenario we're looking for where IV is greater than HV and maintains it through the earnings.
1034.88s: The other three things I want to mention, the first one, fundamental analysis,
1038.08s: technical analysis, really limited efficacy around earnings.
1041.92s: And it's because there's so much new information coming out.
1044.40s: I don't wait these that heavily.
1046.32s: Meaning if something has a really good multiple,
1049.36s: I don't necessarily think that's going to support us a whole lot through earnings
1052.80s: compared to the current multiple that's being shared with us in that earnings release.
1056.64s: Same thing for technical analysis.
1058.32s: You'll very frequently see these big moves that you might say,
1062.08s: oh, okay, resistance is here at 127, but then around earnings, it just doesn't care.
1067.12s: That is such bullshit.
1071.12s: So just know that fundamental analysis, technical analysis around earnings, limited efficacy.
1075.60s: We talked about the cycle IV already, so I'm not going to beat that again,
1078.48s: but that's a really good thing to keep in the back of your mind.
1080.56s: That they period that has the earnings release in it,
1083.60s: the monthly volatility would tend to be higher.
1085.36s: And then the last thing is positive earnings announcement tripped.
1088.16s: This is kind of a notion where if we get a really big earnings beat,
1091.20s: and a big subsequent move post earnings up or down,
1094.00s: that we tend to see a continuation over the next quarter.
1096.40s: This is still in play, but in the recent two years,
1099.92s: this has contracted a lot for S&P 500 stocks.
1103.44s: So the PID is not as impactful for S&P 500 stocks as it used to be,
1107.92s: which I just think is an important general admin note.
1110.24s: So hope it was useful for you.
