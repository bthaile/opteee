0.00s: What's up to the apes, a humble welcome to the outlier trading channel.
5.12s: Today is promised I'm going to take a look at GameStop.
7.88s: I had a couple questions asking just to look into recent price performance and what not
12.16s: the last time I did a video on this was this weekend.
14.68s: So it's about time just to touch base on things.
16.96s: As you know, I've been doing videos every day.
19.72s: However, it's been a little bit quiet in here.
22.40s: So I'm not doing GameStop every single day.
24.20s: I'm kind of looking through the markets and trying to share different things I'm looking
27.16s: at.
28.16s: I'm going to be talking about GameStop.
30.64s: So quick, Admin note tomorrow, I'm doing a live stream at 1700 Pacific time with Peruvian
37.12s: Bowl.
38.12s: And we're going to look at GameStop together.
39.80s: So there's actually a lot of GameStop content planned for this week because then we also
43.56s: still have getting through the rest of Roaring Kitty's trades.
48.16s: I think this is part five of analyzing all of his old trades.
54.04s: So we should hopefully wrap that up this weekend and continue moving through the rest of
59.76s: the backstory on this thing.
61.36s: So I am eager to see where we go from here.
65.04s: And then if there's anything that you want me to take a look at with Peruvian Bowl,
67.44s: just let me know happy to integrate as much content from you guys as I possibly can so
72.96s: that we're talking about the stuff that you're most interested in.
75.64s: That's the whole point.
77.04s: So to level set us here, taking a look at GameStop, it's been, as I already mentioned,
82.52s: it's been really quiet.
83.68s: And that's just kind of what it is.
85.32s: I know it's easy.
86.32s: Well, I know a lot of other people, they really go the route of like trying to pump and,
90.56s: you know, give people a ton of hope about everything.
93.00s: And I'm honestly just much more stoic than that.
96.68s: And that's not that I don't have emotions.
98.28s: It's just the fact that I kind of wait until I see things, right, that are moving.
103.60s: Now one thing you will notice is that I did zoom in to a three month daily.
107.92s: Why would I do that?
109.08s: Because I'm actually trying to get rid of these moves up here so that it fits a little bit
114.84s: better.
115.84s: And I'm actually going to turn off the log scale for the time being.
120.84s: And I want to just see what it's doing in the near term.
124.56s: So we obviously had a bit of a dip after earnings.
128.88s: Then we've had this rally and we've just been rotating a little bit sideways.
132.84s: Now again, we're falling below the point of control.
137.48s: And I find this generally noteworthy, mostly from the fact that volume is still very light.
143.92s: And we're kind of falling like a feather as I see it right now, meaning it's not like
148.20s: being sold off super heavy by people coming in and unloading shares.
153.32s: But it's also not being supported by buyers.
156.32s: It's mostly sale volume as it sits now, 91% for today.
161.16s: And I think that that's just something to keep in the back pocket.
163.80s: Now, from a broader macro perspective to keep in mind, GameStop and small caps in general
171.04s: have been struggling.
172.44s: So if we take a quick look at IWM, it's been kind of exhibiting similar behavior.
177.80s: Now previously I was actually very excited because we saw GameStop starting to rally a little
183.16s: bit when small caps were coming down.
185.52s: That's cool to see because that's positive divergence.
188.36s: It shows me strength in something.
191.36s: Now that aside, it's kind of been going the opposite way now where we're seeing IWM continue
199.52s: to contract.
200.52s: We got a little bit of a bite today.
202.24s: But if I look at this compared to GameStop, or I guess try to combine them into one ticker,
207.84s: but if I look at this compared to GameStop, we've had kind of these two down days here
211.00s: that looks like that divergence has slowed down a little bit.
215.40s: So again, generally noteworthy, I think from a broader perspective, understanding some
220.52s: of the sale pressure that might be coming in here.
223.64s: But yeah, the last thing I have to continue to reiterate because I've had this conversation
228.44s: with a lot of different people about like, oh, this person is able to do really good technical
233.64s: analysis.
234.80s: And that's really cool.
235.96s: Technical analysis is always going to be very unique to the individual.
238.64s: It's kind of like a shoe that happens to fit really well the way you do it and stuff
242.12s: like that.
243.12s: But again, I'm more of a data driven person.
246.84s: So what I've done with something like GameStop is I've taken its entire lifespan of price
252.28s: action.
253.28s: And I've analyzed all standard indicators in a few different formats, but I've used all
259.52s: different oscillators, primary oscillators.
261.76s: So RSI, MacDees, the Castics, that kind of stuff.
264.88s: I've used moving averages, volume profiles, Fibonacci's, volume, volume averages, volatility.
273.00s: Valtzility through ATR, ADR, implied volatility, realized volatility.
277.36s: That's kind of an overview of the broad buckets that I've looked at.
280.08s: And I analyze the predictive capability of these different tools.
283.32s: I actually have a video that's coming out this Saturday that talks a little bit about
286.88s: the behavior of meme stocks in general and how they tend to move.
292.28s: But what I'm trying to highlight is you can absolutely analyze something like GameStop.
297.64s: That your standard technical analysis that most people use to analyze just price and volume,
304.20s: it will work way differently in something like this.
307.72s: Standard technical analysis does not work well in GameStop.
310.40s: And I'm saying that from a quantitative perspective, I'm not saying that there isn't a way
313.48s: to use technical analysis to come up with ideas.
315.48s: Of course there is.
316.68s: But again, I differentiate the way that I look at these things because it's so easy to
321.60s: give yourself confirmation bias.
323.04s: Like, oh yeah, you know, I knew for sure it was going to do this.
325.44s: And then you see it happen.
327.08s: So then that artifact gets logged.
329.56s: But then when we look at that same indicator over the last X period and it doesn't trigger,
335.44s: we're not actually logging those failed signals.
338.36s: The only reason why I'm highlighting this to you is because I found in my brief duration,
344.24s: brief, looking at GameStop this closely over the last five months or so that it tends
349.16s: to have very specific behavior that does not coincide with standard technical analysis
354.88s: indicators well at all.
357.32s: So the reason why that is, if you think about the profit mechanism of something like GameStop,
362.84s: we have a couple of them, right?
364.24s: One of them is the business, hopefully, is continuing to innovate and changing direction.
370.72s: That's a long-term process, right?
373.12s: We're talking about years, literally years, for this pivot to happen and then GameStop
379.00s: to consume more and more market share as it expands its business lines.
383.60s: Maybe it gets into collectibles.
385.04s: Maybe it gets into e-gaming.
386.04s: I've heard people come up with all sorts of ideas that sound pretty cool.
389.88s: That's one route, long-term.
392.32s: Short-term are these really erratic price movements.
395.88s: These erratic price movements sometimes squeezes, either general short squeeze, sometimes
401.04s: it's gamma squeezes, sometimes it's other factors that kind of combine into something that
407.20s: causes these movements.
409.00s: These have very specific traits and they behave differently compared to what normal technical
415.84s: analysis is designed to analyze, which is price and volume movements, right?
420.60s: Because the reason being is these are structural constraints that cause these movements.
426.88s: This isn't the accumulation of institutional investors who are now very eager to get
431.88s: into GameStop and they're piling in hand over fist over the course of two days driving
436.64s: up price of multiple of six plus, right?
440.20s: That's not what's happening here.
441.60s: What's happening here is we're having again, some sort of short squeeze where people
445.48s: are being forced to liquidate unwind to cover risk that does not work with standard technical
452.20s: analysis.
453.20s: So, I just encourage people that look at this to try and think about what it exactly
458.88s: is that we're trying to look for and make sure that the indicators that we're doing
462.88s: align with that.
464.12s: The last point I'll make on this is support and resistance, right?
469.36s: Support and resistance tend to work generally well in normal periods.
473.16s: So if I take a look at this three month period, this looks like a very normal chart, right?
478.48s: We've had some pretty big movements, but still we're falling within standard deviation
482.24s: channels, which tracks size of moves, 95% of data will be captured in here.
486.96s: Okay, cool.
487.96s: I'm seeing things that are having normal price rotation.
491.88s: I'm seeing consolidation where we get multiple days in a row of these kinds of prices, so
495.84s: not so forth.
497.04s: That's normal in GameStop exhibits normal tendencies until it's not normal.
504.28s: So here you might be looking at all this consolidation, seeing all this stuff going
507.40s: on.
508.40s: And the first thing that I noticed that kind of keys my interest is seeing a spike in
512.36s: volume in something like this.
515.08s: I know spike in volume doesn't always mean something is going to happen, but I do know
519.44s: before something has happened throughout its entire history, it does have a spike in
523.88s: volume.
524.88s: So now I look carefully and I'm thinking, okay, you know, what does this potentially
527.96s: look like?
529.12s: And you can draw all the support and resistance lines you want.
532.32s: Not one of them matters.
533.76s: Not one of them.
534.76s: There's essentially no consolidation here on a relative basis given these kinds of moves
539.16s: in this phase.
540.84s: This defies standard price movement and therefore defies standard technical analysis.
546.84s: You can't apply it here.
548.24s: So I want to be very clear, you can apply technical analysis here, but you have to modify
554.20s: what you're looking at and what you're using because standard technical analysis does
559.88s: not work well in GameStop when it's going through its phases.
562.68s: It can this is standard and here completely standard.
565.48s: Nothing offbeat about it, but the interesting stuff about GameStop for the short term
569.48s: price movements via some sort of significant peak.
573.28s: Those break all the standard rules.
575.00s: So a little bit of an interesting conversation I was having with a few folks and somebody
579.36s: actually sent me an email asking about it.
581.84s: So that essential part of this video is from Mike who was just curious about how application
588.40s: of standard technical analysis works with something like GameStop and notice how I'm very
592.96s: particular.
593.96s: I'm not saying technical analysis, I'm saying standard technical analysis because we can
597.12s: still come up with tendencies profiles, things like that that use short squeezes, which
601.84s: again, that's a primary profit mechanism for stuff like this, not limited to GameStop
606.20s: for the short term movements.
608.16s: And again, the video on Saturday will go through that way more in detail so that you have
611.88s: a sense of how to look at this objectively for yourself.
615.12s: Okay, so now let's take a look at the options really fast.
618.92s: And it's because there's a few things that stuck out to me.
621.76s: The first thing is we're still well over two times call to puts.
625.52s: I find that interesting and I continue to find that interesting even with today.
630.36s: However, the part that is a little more concerning to me as I think about it is we can see
637.92s: that there's a lot of short calls being offered.
641.20s: And that's people probably who have shares that are selling calls against them.
644.40s: I sell calls against my shares when it's in periods like this because it's a way for
648.12s: me to make some more money while GameStop is moving sideways or rotating over.
653.04s: That's exactly all there is to it.
654.96s: And I know some people get upset about that, which I always find funny because actually
658.36s: if I sell calls, then that requires a market maker to buy shares that hedge the position
663.84s: as it gets close to expiration, especially if my strike is in the money.
667.20s: So really, I thought people would be happy about that.
670.32s: But I get it and I joke because a lot of people just don't want anything negative GameStop,
674.72s: which I respect.
675.72s: I understand, but I'm a trader.
677.60s: It's what I do.
678.60s: So I have my shares as I continue to reiterate, but that's more of a participation thing
682.44s: than anything.
683.44s: I'm not actively trying to trade those.
685.24s: And then I trade options around it as it's moving, but really the only options I have
689.56s: right now are short calls against the shares, not covering them.
693.40s: So I have uncapped profit potential.
696.32s: And but I'm not trading directly with options right now just because it's relatively quiet.
701.36s: Now the other thing I want to highlight is looking at the volatility surface.
705.08s: We see a couple anomalies.
707.32s: One of them is here in 17 Jan 25.
710.16s: Notice how high that volatility is relative to everything else that's around it.
714.68s: So that's something I'll keep an eye on because those I do try to trade in here, they tend
718.28s: to work really well for kind of a short term relative value play for volatility.
723.72s: But that's kind of playing it between a couple of explorations.
726.88s: Maybe, you know, like a few weeks if that.
729.92s: So it's a short term thing that's essentially trying to play the relative movement of this
734.40s: volatility compared to something else.
736.80s: So for example, you could do this and expecting this to expand this to contract stuff like
742.56s: that.
743.72s: So that's that.
745.36s: Now the last thing I want to look at with you is actually just going through unusual
749.88s: whales really quick.
752.00s: And I just want to pop into a few things specifically any interesting order volume that
758.24s: we've gotten.
759.24s: And I mean, Cliff notes is I haven't really seen anything come through, but I'll still
763.20s: take a look at it with you.
764.68s: Let's take a look at what is today the second of October here.
769.76s: So I mean, we're like real real quiet in terms of larger volume, right?
775.72s: So we're even catching stuff that's hundreds of dollars.
778.08s: But very, very quiet today.
780.64s: If we take a look at yesterday, we had one coming in at the 17 Jan 25s.
789.12s: What I'm noticing is these longer term options have been getting hit so much more than they
795.36s: tend to at least based on what I've seen.
797.68s: Because I also know that the 35s got hit out there.
800.84s: So I want to highlight that just from a simple departure from the way that I've seen this
808.40s: typically move where the overwhelming concentration of OI and volume has been in the front
813.76s: expirations.
814.76s: That is genuinely not the case now.
816.48s: It is a bit of a mixed bag.
819.00s: So if we look across the different series right now for oct this coming Friday is, you
824.36s: know, 125 K versus 25 K 11 is 36 versus 13 18 is 269 versus 92.
831.48s: That is relatively new.
832.92s: So what that tells me is things are just a little more quiet here.
836.40s: That's really what this tells me.
838.12s: And out at that 17 Jan expiration, which we've seen hit a few times now is 180 over 96.
843.76s: So that means that we have actually several explorations that are higher than the front
847.88s: expiration, which tends to just mean quiet.
851.08s: But again, the one thing we have to reiterate with something like GameStop is that it is
854.48s: quiet until it's not, it happens fast.
857.68s: So just because it's quiet today doesn't mean it's not quiet tomorrow.
861.32s: You have to really stand your toes.
863.28s: I have again a series of different nets that I use to track movements, not just in GameStop,
868.68s: but in anything for me to trade and anything like this, they tend to move really fast.
873.88s: So you have to be ready to pivot quickly, which kind of is what makes them fun.
877.48s: So that's what I'm seeing in GameStop is always anything that you want to take a look at.
880.92s: Let me know anything we should look at in the live stream tomorrow with Proveum Bull.
885.08s: Let me know.
886.08s: And then the same thing for the Saturday, GME live stream, we're typically focusing on
889.60s: roaring kiddie's old trades, but anything else that we should dive into after that goes
893.88s: super far into the weeds.
894.88s: You know, I'm here for it.
895.88s: Do you need anything?
896.88s: Let me know.
897.88s: I'll be an outlier.
898.88s: I'll see you all later.
