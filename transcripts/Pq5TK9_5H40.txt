0.00s:  What is going on everybody? I am here with the man, the myth, the legend, the comedian,
8.00s:  the CPA, the therapist, the, I'm pretty sure you were a professional. I'm just kidding,
12.80s:  but you really do. You really seem to do a little bit of everything, which is awesome,
19.00s:  but I'm here with Bob Wheeler. I was actually on your podcast pretty recently and I literally
24.04s:  love the conversation. Like I was just telling you before we started the recording, you
27.60s:  are one of those gems that makes talking about tax engaging and I think there's a lot you
34.40s:  bring to the table. So first off, thank you so much for, you know, since some time
38.34s:  aside to come talk to us. Well, absolutely. I love talking about taxes. I love talking
42.84s:  about money. We all think about it. So my is well at least make it a little bit fun.
48.44s:  Yeah. So and I think the perfect intro is a lot of people when they think about taxes,
53.84s:  right? We, it's not really something a lot of people want to dive into. It's complicated.
59.16s:  It's busy. There's not, it's not very fun paying taxes. So how the hell did you become
64.64s:  a CPA? What threw you in that direction? Well, you know, I wanted to be a lawyer and then
70.20s:  I met a few lawyers and I was like, yeah, I don't want to do that. So I was actually taking
74.68s:  accounting classes just to help my great point average, believe it or not. And I was like,
80.28s:  and of course, it's not something you can go into if it's easy because it's got to be
83.56s:  painful if you're going to make money. So but ultimately, ultimately, I accounting was
88.60s:  something that I really enjoyed and came easy. But you know, as I got into my tax practice,
94.92s:  I just realized so many people had so many issues. And the truth is, so did I. I was telling
100.28s:  other people follow these rules, but then I wasn't following them because I had an excuse
105.56s:  in a story and a mindset. And so once I started looking at my own personal mindset and self-sabotage
112.52s:  around money. And I started talking with my clients, mostly that are entrepreneurs and people
116.76s:  making nice incomes, getting into their stories because even like this last week has been tax
123.40s:  deadlines and so many clients, even though they're making a half million dollars, generating a
128.76s:  million dollars in grocery revenue, they're like, this is the worst year ever. I didn't make any
133.16s:  money. I'm like, you got three houses in LaHoya. You just flew to Paris, not buying it, right? But
141.40s:  their mindset is there's such impoverty. And I'm sure there are many people would be happy to
145.56s:  swap out with them. But so that's really got me fascinated. It was just how we have the
150.12s:  subconscious money mindset that we're operating with. We're making decisions all day long. And
157.00s:  we're trying to figure out how to get through it and navigate it. And we don't know. And we think
160.20s:  everybody else knows, but we don't. And so that was just really, I wanted to be able to help people.
165.24s:  And it wasn't because I was like, oh, I'm so much better than everybody else. And I learned all this
169.80s:  stuff. I wanted to be able to learn the rules. So I can figure out where to push the rules, right?
173.88s:  Because if I don't know the rules, then I can't know that I crossed a line or I can't know where I
178.44s:  can push and reinterpret. So figured learn the rules and see how I can help people.
185.88s:  I love that. And I actually really admire the fact that you tie in the concept of helping people
190.52s:  because most people, when they think about, oh, you know, damn, I gotta go talk to the accountant,
194.92s:  you know, this is gonna suck. But I have actually found that exact thing that literally I was just
200.68s:  talking to my accountant last week. And the conversations I have with him, it always feels like a very
206.04s:  team team project. And one of the things I noticed from his perspective, and I'm curious if you
212.68s:  identify it with this is that yes, there are the rules. But then it seems like every, you know,
218.84s:  client has like its individual puzzle pieces that you're trying to move. Do you view it as a puzzle
224.20s:  or how do you view, you know, the list of issues that you're trying to solve for your clients?
228.84s:  Yeah, absolutely. It's definitely a puzzle. And every person is unique. And so I need to know the
234.20s:  story. So when I'm gonna tax return, when the government looks at it, it needs to at least in
241.00s:  theory feel like a nonfiction, right? Right? Maybe it based on a true story. But I want to go in
249.40s:  there and get the facts. And so I was explaining to somebody the other day, a high profile person who
254.76s:  has his account is not writing certain things off. You know, if I'm a teacher and they, and you
261.32s:  cut, and I come in and say, look, I'm spending $80,000 a year in travel. That's probably not realistic.
268.44s:  Probably $80,000 worth of travel doesn't apply to my business. But if I'm an influencer, if I'm
273.80s:  somebody in the public eye and I'm traveling all the time and I'm going to events, $80,000
279.40s:  a travel might be just a drop in the bucket. And so knowing what the story is so that I can look
285.72s:  at that and say, well, that's a gray area. But I actually, I can support the fact that this
289.88s:  supports your business. And if I can find a tie-in, most of the time the IRS, they might say, well,
295.64s:  we agree with you 90% or actually we agree with that line of thinking. And so it's learning each
302.36s:  person's story and then figuring out how can I advocate for them and keep them on track, right?
307.96s:  We want to avoid taxes. We don't want to evade them. I'm not looking for prison time. I want to do
312.60s:  what's right. But there are lots of places where there's a lot left open for interpretation.
317.88s:  And I'm going to push it to the envelope when I can.
321.40s:  I you're hitting like the things that I look for in the county, which is actually one of my future
327.32s:  questions because one of the things that I found early on is like everybody else, I was super cheap
332.68s:  and I wanted to do my own taxes. And I actually think for simple tax profiles, it's a good exercise
339.00s:  because you at least understand some of it. But then when I started doing the YouTube stuff and
346.04s:  the trading and all these other things, I found, okay, like this is getting kind of heavy. And
351.16s:  when I had my first conversation with one of the accountants, I was kind of interviewing
356.12s:  not for the channel, but like for my business. And they made it sound like, oh, I try to follow
362.60s:  the letter of the law, stay away from audits, stay as far away. I never get audited, nothing like that.
368.52s:  And I'm sitting there thinking like, that seems like an interesting approach. Obviously,
372.60s:  audit's not ideal, but I love that you talked about the gray area and trying to find something that
378.84s:  there's some room for interpretation. So can you talk a little bit about just that gray area
385.64s:  in how you look at your different clients and perceive, okay, maybe I could push a little bit here,
391.88s:  maybe not so much here. Yeah, so again, I work with a lot of entrepreneurs. I'm in LA, I work with a
399.16s:  lot of entertainers. I work with a lot of people in the entertainment industry. So somebody that's
405.08s:  got Hulu and Netflix and Disney Plus and all those things, they might actually really be watching
410.44s:  the stuff. Yeah, one, because they want to watch it, but two, because it applies to their job,
414.28s:  they might be wanting to look at how something's edited. They want to see what kind of music's
417.80s:  popping these days. And so there might actually be a reason that they're going in,
423.56s:  getting on the internet, looking to make sure that they're getting the royalties for the stuff that
427.24s:  showed up on a TV gig and things like that. So there might be real reasons that that is research
434.44s:  and not just a personal, oh, I need to watch TV. Same thing with whether it's travel, maybe I'm
442.68s:  building some real estate portfolio and I'm traveling to other cities because maybe it's
447.64s:  better buying property in Ohio than it is in Los Angeles. And so I want to go check those things out
453.32s:  or maybe I'm thinking of starting a business with the buddy and they live in another state. So I
457.88s:  want to go travel and you know, and maybe it doesn't pan out, but it's still an expense in exploring,
464.20s:  expanding my business. And so I want to look at those different things and see if there's a
469.96s:  reasonableness to incorporating that into the business. There are certain things like, you know,
475.64s:  I remember I had this client that was just, I go to Costco and everything's business and I'm like,
480.84s:  yeah, that's a let's don't be greedy. They got audited and you know, had they, the auditor even said,
486.84s:  look, if they had done every other receipt or if they had taken half of all the receipts,
491.64s:  but they were going through there like toothbrush, underwear, and some people would say, well,
496.68s:  you know, I need underwear to go to work. Well, maybe you do, maybe you don't, but it's a personal
502.84s:  item. Your dog is not your company mascot, right? So there are certain things. If you're buying
508.28s:  stuff at Victoria's Secret, unless you're a model, it's probably not a write-off. Maybe if you're
514.60s:  on a MyFans page or something like that, you might talk about my business like that. That's
518.60s:  another business. You got to do what you got to do. You got to do what you got to do. I just had to pay
523.48s:  $690 from a utility bill. That only fans page really needs to get pop and suit. Exactly.
531.72s:  But yes, so that's what we're doing. We're trying to look at those areas where, where can we
536.36s:  maximize and does it make sense? And there's other places where I'm like, you know, you did not
540.36s:  spend $80,000 in dry cleaning. You will work at a bank. Right. So one of the fascinating things
550.44s:  about your story is obviously the line between comedian and CPA. Those seem like dichotomies.
560.60s:  I have got to know like how those two exist in the same ecosystem for you.
567.32s:  Well, you know, it's funny. Bob Newhart is my role model. He was a CPA.
571.64s:  Working for the sales department. For me, like, you know, I'm always analyzing with comedy.
579.00s:  You're always analyzing. You're always observing. You're paying attention to things. And then how do
582.76s:  I bring that back in? So in a way, it's the same thing when I'm doing a county. I'm looking, I'm
587.32s:  I play detective. I'm trying to ask for the questions you're not sharing with me. I'm trying to
592.68s:  read into the paperwork that you think I won't figure out. And, and so really most of my job is
598.76s:  playing detective and being really incredibly skeptical. Because clients will say to me, oh,
604.52s:  this and this happened. I'm like, really? Because it seems like this and this happened. Oh, yeah,
607.72s:  you're right. Or the client will call me up and say, you screwed up my taxes. You put down. I made
613.24s:  $300,000. I'm like, okay, did you make this deposit? This one? This one? This one? Yeah, yeah,
618.20s:  that equals 300,000. Where's my money? Well, that's a different question. But the numbers are right. So
624.44s:  for me, being able to use those skills as a comic also then helps me to get people to let their
630.76s:  defenses down. Share information with me. I don't joke about people's tax spills. I'm not like,
636.12s:  oh, my god, look at you owe this much money. I know there are certain things where I can't really
640.20s:  joke. But I can use it as a way to play around and get information from people to just relax them
646.36s:  because people do come in very tense when they're meeting with their CPAs most of the time.
651.00s:  Yeah. And I think the other correlation that I consider is the fact that, you know, you talked
656.68s:  about that gray area in a CPI, which in or a CPA, like when you're looking at taxes, and in my
662.20s:  mind, I'm thinking like, that's there's some creative license in there to see what kind of story you
666.68s:  could tell. So I could totally see how those two actually play off of each other specifically
671.88s:  a comedian to CPA. That's actually a really good structure, I think. So when I think about
678.60s:  traders in general, which is most of my people, you know, we hate taxes just like everybody else.
687.00s:  And we expose ourselves to additional tax, right? So most of us, they get a paycheck from somewhere,
693.48s:  put it in a trading account, and then they start trading. So and ideally at the end of the year,
698.36s:  we walk away with some money. One of the things that I see traders talk about is wash sales and
706.68s:  tax harvesting. So I want to talk about a couple of those specific concepts with you and to get your
713.48s:  thought process. So wash sales, could you walk us through, you know, you don't even have to speak to
719.72s:  me like I'm five, because I mentally, so just speak to me and tell me, you know, what wash sales
726.36s:  are in your world. Yeah. So wash sale is, you know, a lot of times we'll sell off stock to create a
734.04s:  loss so we can take that loss to offset some gains, because maybe we just don't have any faith
738.44s:  in that that stocks can ever recover. And so we might do that, or we might sell some stuff,
743.32s:  we might sell some stock off, take the loss, and then repurchase some stock thinking, oh, I'll get
748.76s:  that loss. However, there's this wash sale rule that says if you do that within 30 days, and you turn
757.48s:  around and sell that, we're not going to give you the loss. You're not going to get that right now.
763.16s:  And so what happened in the last couple of years is I had a couple clients with four, five,
767.24s:  six hundred thousand dollars worth of wash sales. They were correctly thinking,
771.88s:  create if I generate a loss, I can take it against my other capital gains, what they didn't realize
776.84s:  was I needed to wait more than 30 days. And so there is a big disconnect. And when we got to
784.60s:  the taxes, I'm like, well, you've got a million dollar gain. And they're like, no, you did it wrong.
788.84s:  No, you did it wrong. You weren't paying attention to the 30 day rule. And so if you're going to be
795.32s:  trading for people out there that they're just starting, have some conversations, do a little research,
800.28s:  find out what a long term and a short term capital gain is. The tax isn't always 15%. And even
806.60s:  though it might be 15%, it might also be plus 4% for the additional investment tax that gets
812.76s:  added on that a lot of people don't factor in. And if you're making over a couple hundred thousand
818.52s:  dollars, these are some extra taxes you got to be careful about. And so a lot of my clients are like,
823.40s:  what's this? Well, you got to know the rules. And that's again, why I became a CPI, I want to
829.48s:  know the rules so I can figure out how to work around them. If you don't know the rules when you're
833.88s:  trading, you're going to put yourself in a bad situation. And I was sharing with you, I have a client
838.52s:  who had a, had a, almost a million dollar capital gain. And he sold it two days within being a long
845.24s:  term capital gain. He'd been trading forever. And so when I asked him, don't you know the, do you know
849.72s:  the difference between short term and long term? He's like, I have no idea what you're talking about.
854.12s:  And with the money he's putting in the market, that's something you might want to know. It's a small
859.64s:  fact, small fun fact. Don't pay extra taxes. Wait two days.
867.32s:  Well, and I think that, you know, there is always this bit of you don't know what you don't know.
872.68s:  And that's why it's so useful to talk to people like you. So obviously we have the, the wash sale
879.72s:  stuff. And I think that the overview did, there was super useful. Can you talk to us a little bit
885.00s:  about short term versus long term capital gains tax? Yeah. So basically anything held a year or
892.04s:  less, you know, is, is a short term capital gain. And that means you're going to, whatever tax
896.76s:  bracket you're in, that's the tax you're paying. Now you might be in the 24% tax bracket and
902.36s:  effectively paying 17% because it's a graduated table. But the fact of the matter is, you know,
910.84s:  some of these clients of mine will get RSU's, they'll get all these stock options and things.
915.80s:  And they get added to their paycheck. And so their W2 will say they made a million dollars. And
919.72s:  they're like, they made a mistake. I only made 400,000. Well, 600,000 is short term capital gains
927.08s:  basically that you're paying on that later on when you sell the stock, you'll have basis. Right.
932.04s:  But in that moment, you're paying ordinary income tax. And so it's really important to know
939.40s:  that GFI wait two days, if I can wait two days and pay that lower tax rate, I definitely want to do
945.40s:  it. And so I think again, people are just not aware of, oh, there's a real big difference between
951.56s:  short term and long term. And sometimes it's just waiting a day or two. And that's an important
956.52s:  factor. And I think the other piece which you mentioned about calling the losses, harvesting the
962.84s:  losses. And this can be good. But again, here's a thing that's come up with me several times this
970.04s:  year. Somebody will say, you know what? I lost $100,000 in crypto. Man, I can't wait to write that off
974.44s:  on your taxes. And I'm like, wow, you're going to be writing off $3,000. And they're like, no, no,
980.68s:  no, I lost $100,000. I get to write off $100,000. Do you have $100,000 worth of capital gains?
986.76s:  No, you're going to be writing off $3,000. And so I'm surprised at how many people still don't
992.68s:  understand that on your tax return, that line item is not going to be more than $3,000,
999.80s:  right? Unless you've released some passive losses from the sale of some real estate or something
1003.88s:  like that. But for the most part, you can only offset your losses against capital gains. And then
1011.08s:  plus three. And I think there's a big disconnect there. The example that I give is I had a client
1017.16s:  who had a million dollars worth of capital losses. Somebody walked in and offered to pay him $3,000
1024.68s:  million for his house. And he had after his exemptions and everything, he had a million dollar
1029.16s:  capital gain. Well, he paid no tax on that because the stock happened the year before the house
1036.28s:  happened the next year. Now, if he had reversed that and he had sold the house in the first year,
1043.96s:  and then he lost a million dollars, he would have paid tax on the million. And then he would have
1047.88s:  written off $3,000 a year until eternity. Right. And so it's so important to pay attention to
1056.04s:  that capital loss piece because I had another client who was buying appreciating stock,
1061.64s:  buying appreciating stock, very risky stuff, ultimately lost about $7,800,000. Then the
1068.92s:  financial advisor moved them into high dividend stocks. So now to sudden she's getting $80,000
1076.68s:  in dividends. And I'm writing off $3,000 a year on this 700,000. I finally called the broker and I
1084.28s:  said, Hey, you got an understand. I need you to be buying appreciating stock, not stock that's
1091.32s:  paying dividends. They're like, Oh, got it. Right. So you got to be CPA and your financial advisor
1098.92s:  need to be communicating. I to be honest, I love that you bring that up. And I find for myself,
1106.04s:  I'll talk to my accountant at least quarterly, typically even more than that, at least via email
1111.32s:  and stuff because some of the timing things that you brought up, especially the one about the house
1116.04s:  and the capital loss, like that is really important for people because that is a huge difference
1122.68s:  in what the money you take home looks like. So I think little things like that are so incredibly
1129.80s:  useful. Now I want to ask your thoughts on something. I lament the tax harvesting mindset for
1140.92s:  traders. It bothers me. But from your background, specifically coming at this from like a money
1147.56s:  psychology perspective, when you think about it, obviously there is a benefit to that in terms of
1153.72s:  the overall tax picture. But do you see people who are using that as an excuse for essentially bad
1160.36s:  positions they had? And it gives them an easy out. Yeah, you know, it's interesting. You know,
1167.24s:  when people come to me and say, Oh my God, look, I'm going to be I'm able to create a loss and
1171.16s:  they're super excited. I always say you created a loss. Let's start there. Let's not get excited.
1179.08s:  You lost money. Right. Now it's great that we're going to get a tax benefit if we can. And so
1184.04s:  let's use it, but let's don't get excited about losses. Me personally, and this is probably my own
1189.96s:  little bit of emotional peace in there, even though you should not use emotions when you're
1193.24s:  investing or doing business decisions. But I'm always holding hope out that even my worst stock is
1201.08s:  going to one day turn around and rally and freaking I'm going to get my money back. Yep. Just
1207.56s:  just waiting to catch a bid. I'm just waiting. And so, you know, I'm not as excited to sell it off
1213.72s:  because in my mind, it's a loss. And yes, I know sometimes you have to cut your losses. And I know
1219.24s:  there are a lot of people out there that will just buy and sell based on a schedule and not look
1224.76s:  emotionally at how it's doing. You know, it's like, yep, it's time to sell. But me personally,
1232.28s:  when I've got clients that I know if they're advisor and everybody's like the stocks never
1235.56s:  going to rebound, okay, take your losses and get the benefit for sure. But I, you know, me personally,
1243.00s:  I tend to like wait till the last minute because I hold out hope. And I just don't like the
1250.84s:  I don't like being in the mindset of hooray, I lost money. I'm in the you know, my hope is that
1257.48s:  I'm always making money. Yeah, I always viewed that as, you know, the ego obviously is so powerful.
1263.80s:  And I always thought that that was just a way for the ego to preserve itself because I feel the
1269.40s:  same as you do. Most people will say, Oh, well, you know, I don't want to get taxed on this. And I
1274.76s:  typically would say something like you get taxed on games. Like yeah, yeah, we want to get taxed
1279.88s:  as little for sure. But it's only on games. So chill, fuck out and accept the fact that this isn't
1286.92s:  the worst case scenario here. Um, yeah. So a couple of things that I wanted to pick your brain on,
1293.16s:  the first one is I personally found that when I started integrating real estate into my broader
1300.44s:  portfolio, specifically is it pertained to trading my end of your taxes actually started looking
1306.52s:  a lot better. I wanted to get your thoughts on the integration of real estate and its ability to
1313.72s:  help you as a CPA help essentially somebody's tax footprint, you know, you're over here.
1319.80s:  So I like real estate. I'm not going to say so I would say I love it, but it's not always fun,
1328.76s:  right? Real estate can I've got so many nightmare stories. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.
1334.44s:  But I've had clients where real estate would really help them and they will say my dad was in real estate.
1339.96s:  It was a nightmare. I will never do it just because dealing with tenants. So that just means you
1344.44s:  need to find somebody to manage the properties or invest in a reate, right? Like you could still
1350.20s:  get into real estate and not have to be the property manager. But having said that, I do think that
1357.88s:  real estate is such a great way to save on taxes, even if it's not immediate, right? And so for a
1367.80s:  lot of my clients, we're not going to get the $25,000 right off. And maybe they're a real estate
1373.88s:  professional and then they put in the time and they meet the requirements and then maybe I'm going
1378.04s:  to get that right off. But most of my clients, it's going to sit and I tell them, you're going to
1382.68s:  have this bucket. It's just filling up with passive losses and one day you'll get them.
1387.96s:  What I like about that sometimes as well is if my client doesn't and you know, I'm not saying I do
1395.16s:  this all the time, but if I have a client that doesn't have the best to receipts, but they know they
1398.76s:  spent $20 or $30,000. Well, if I put that in on a passive loss, loss that's going to be suspended,
1405.88s:  nobody's coming in and looking through my numbers and going, wait a minute, wait a minute. So I may be
1410.52s:  picking up losses that I'm not going to realize for 10, 15 years. Nobody's going to come back and ask
1417.00s:  me to explain those numbers 10, 15 years later. And so I'm not as worried about my numbers because
1424.76s:  I'm not taking them right now. So even if somebody's spending a lot of money renovating a yard
1429.32s:  or redoing a kitchen and it's a lot of money, I'm not taking the loss. The IRS doesn't care at that
1434.28s:  point. Right. And so I've got a little wiggle room. But being able to knowing that you've got that
1441.40s:  and then understanding that you've got these passive losses, that's one reason to be with an
1446.68s:  accountant and stay with an accountant because I've had a couple of situations. I had somebody come in
1450.68s:  and say, look, I was so excited to sell my property. Everybody told me I was going to get a big refund.
1455.08s:  My accountant did my taxes and I owe $40,000. Well, I looked when I looked at the return. They forgot
1460.20s:  to pick up. They forgot to release all the passive losses when they sold the property. And instead of
1465.08s:  owing a significant amount of money, he ended up getting back 20,000. Right. But thankfully, he came
1471.00s:  and asked me. Right. But by the same token, I had a client who was like, look, you're just doing a
1476.68s:  schedule, e that's losing me money. And I'm just going to go and do my taxes myself. And I said,
1482.68s:  okay, that's fine. I totally get it. You want to say, if 700 bucks, here's the thing. Do me a favor.
1487.40s:  Let me see your tax return before you send it off just the first year because I'm afraid you're not
1492.20s:  going to pick up the passive losses. And sure enough, they didn't pick up the passive losses. And they
1496.84s:  had a couple hundred thousand dollars. Well, if you've got those passive losses and your income drops
1502.28s:  below the one 50 and you can start tapping into that bucket, you're reducing taxes. And again,
1508.76s:  they saved 700 bucks. But if I hadn't been adamant, said, look, you've been a long time client.
1514.84s:  Let me look at your return anyway. They would have just lost so much money. But hey, they saved 700 bucks.
1522.84s:  Right. Yeah. And it's forced through the trees, right? Like, yeah, whenever it comes time to pay
1528.12s:  the CPA, it's always not not the greatest time on earth because it can be expensive. But yeah,
1533.56s:  I do think and I personally have found tremendous value in it, especially over when I was doing my
1538.68s:  own taxes, even when my own taxes were simple. So I genuinely think you guys are worth your weight
1544.44s:  and gold. And speaking of that, one of the things I love talking to CPAs about is you have the
1551.32s:  perspective to see what lots of people are doing with their money and what really successful people
1556.92s:  are doing, what moderately successful people are doing. I would love to, you know, in obviously,
1562.04s:  I know you can't get super far in a detail, but from like a high level overview, what are some of
1566.68s:  the common threads you see very successfully financially speaking people doing that maybe,
1573.88s:  other people would need to be privy to or would like to be privy to?
1578.04s:  So I think that a lot of people invest in real estate. And even if they're not managing it
1586.36s:  themselves, they're either, I mean, some people put money in reads, I don't see that as much,
1592.28s:  but I do see people buying in real estate and having somebody else take care of that.
1598.44s:  The other big thing I would say is that a lot of people do have their brokerage accounts,
1603.32s:  but they don't manage them themselves. They've got somebody else staying on top of it because
1609.24s:  they don't have the time, they're busy. Now, unless you've got the time and you want to be a trader
1613.96s:  in things like that, that's different, but a lot of my clients are trying to create their business
1618.12s:  or come up with the next big thing and they don't have time and paying somebody that money,
1625.00s:  that one or two percent to keep growing their portfolio. Those are the people that I see
1631.72s:  significant growth for the most part. And I also, which great is I have a few clients that will say,
1637.96s:  can you just look at my portfolio and tell me that they made me a lot of money or
1644.60s:  it's worth paying them the 2% because they seem expensive. Now, one of the things I think it's
1649.64s:  important to think about in terms of a financial advisor, their job, in my opinion,
1654.76s:  isn't to make you millions of dollars. If you've got millions of dollars, their job is to preserve it.
1660.60s:  And to then grow it, but not in a way that's irresponsible. And so, yeah, it's great that some
1667.64s:  of these people can go out and say, oh, I'm going to make you all this money. But again, you got to be
1671.64s:  choosy about your financial advisor. Do the research. Make sure they feel comfortable to you because I
1676.84s:  had a client who really wanted to get into investing. They were nervous to come to a broker that I
1683.16s:  knew I said, leave the money in a savings account for six months before you do any investing. Sure,
1689.56s:  sure, sure. Three months later, they've invested it in something. It loses $20,000. His $100,000
1695.48s:  loses $20,000. And I called up the broker and I was like, what did you do? You just broke his trust.
1701.16s:  And the broker says to me, it was a sure thing. And I said, well, if it was a sure thing, there'd be
1706.44s:  $20,000 more in his bank account. It's not a sure thing. And so, of course, that guy never wanted
1712.84s:  to invest his money again, ever again, and he didn't trust anybody. And of course, I never used
1717.32s:  that broker again. It's all about trust. And so you've got to trust your broker. If they're asking
1722.68s:  to borrow money from you, that's illegal and run. But you'd be surprised how many clients have told me
1729.00s:  an advisor asked to borrow some money or asked him to invest in something on the side.
1734.20s:  Run for the hills. But it is important, I think, having an advisor or somebody that's in the
1741.16s:  know if you don't have the time. So now, I do also have clients that invest in silver and gold
1747.08s:  and stuff like that, precious metals. I don't see that as much. I like investing in that stuff
1751.64s:  because I'm assuming the apocalypse is coming. I live in LA. I want to have little silver coins
1757.16s:  to buy my food. But that's, you know, that's the, you know, that's my, the world is not coming to
1764.28s:  an end. But just in case it does, I'm going to have lots of little silver coins.
1768.28s:  Hopefully those are still in, in Vogue at that point. Exactly.
1774.20s:  So when I think about just people's approach to finances and something I've thought about myself
1783.24s:  is I went through a pretty prolonged phase where I was cavalier with risk. And then I got bit.
1791.64s:  I had a huge portfolio drawdown because like most traders, I am a fucking idiot. And I made
1798.84s:  poor choices. But, you know, luckily, I was able to find my way through that. One of the things I'm
1804.44s:  curious about, we were talking just a little bit about kind of the psychology there behind
1810.12s:  different financial choices. And one of the things I feel like is a lot of my generation,
1815.40s:  I'm a millennial, I'm 31, but it feels like a lot of us are very risk averse. And I'm curious
1821.32s:  if you see that kind of thing from your side of the equation. Yeah, I mean, nobody really likes
1828.52s:  to lose money. For the most part, I mean, there are maybe a few people that find joy in it. But,
1834.20s:  I don't, no, I think most people are risk averse, especially as they've started to accumulate a
1839.72s:  little bit. You know, I got a hundred bucks and I lose a hundred bucks, who cares? You know,
1844.12s:  I'm buying some penny stock right now. It's 1500 bucks. I lose 1500 bucks, who cares? If it turns
1848.92s:  out to be 800,000 sweet. But like, but other stuff, you know, even myself, even though I know
1856.20s:  don't get emotional about investments, you know, I put some money into a couple of funds. And then,
1861.00s:  of course, everything tanks. And I'm still like, I know it will turn around. And I know I can play
1867.32s:  the game of waiting, but still emotionally. So, hey, don't go in and look at your brokerage statement
1872.84s:  every day. If you've got a lot of money sitting in things you're not going to move for a while,
1877.00s:  then don't go in and just remind yourself of the pain. Just wait it out. Like, don't create more
1882.92s:  anxiety. But I haven't come across a lot of clients that are willing to take a lot of risk.
1889.64s:  The client that I was saying that had that 700,000 worth of losses and high yield dividend stock,
1896.12s:  she was investing in stuff that was incredibly risky in her 80s. And she was like, I don't care.
1902.36s:  You know, and she's like, because if I hit it, I hit it. And you know, where's Ksenaria? I'll sell
1907.48s:  my house. It's worth a couple million. But I was like, this is so dangerous for you. She's like,
1913.16s:  I love that. I'm doing it anyway. She was a, she was a trailblazer. I loved her. She just recently passed.
1919.08s:  But she was, she was, you know, she didn't care. But she was not the norm. Most people are,
1924.52s:  right? And you don't want to be from a scarcity mindset of like, oh my God, I have to hold on to
1928.36s:  everything ever forever. You got money, ebbs and flows. So you got to, you can't hold money so tight
1935.00s:  that it can't grow and leave. You know, it's just going to suffocate if you just hold onto it.
1940.04s:  But finding that balance of a tolerating a little bit of a, a, a little loss and a little bit of risk.
1946.52s:  But like, I don't even like going to Vegas. And like, when I was 20s, man, let me go in and
1950.60s:  blow my money in Vegas. Now, I don't even want to spend a hundred bucks unless I consciously say,
1955.00s:  I spend a hundred bucks and then I walk away because I don't want to give away a hundred bucks.
1959.16s:  That's a hundred bucks that could buy a stock. That's a hundred bucks that I could do something
1963.16s:  with it. Other than just give it to the casino. Yeah. And, and I like that because I think a big part
1969.08s:  of at least finance for me over time has been learning like what I actually value, like what is worth
1975.40s:  the purchase for me? What is not worth the purchase for me? And where's the marginal utility? And
1979.72s:  I think you hit on a good, a good bit of that there. So a couple other questions I wanted to ask you.
1986.44s:  Obviously, you know, there's all different kinds of CPAs out there, different philosophies,
1991.72s:  different approaches to taxes. But if you were to summarize your approach to tax in general,
2000.20s:  what are, like, how would you summarize it? Like, what's your general strategy?
2005.16s:  So my strategy is let's figure out how to avoid taxes. I love working with entrepreneurs
2010.04s:  because I've got corporations. I've got structures in place that I can use to my advantage.
2014.84s:  You know, I don't really work with a lot of W2 people because I can't do a whole lot.
2020.92s:  Unless you've got rental property and things like that. So I want to, I work with people with more
2025.56s:  complicated returns because I can actually make a difference there. But somebody can walk in
2031.88s:  making $500,000 on a W2. I can't do anything for you. There's nowhere to go. And so we work with people
2040.04s:  as a team. I don't look at tax returns as tax returns. I look at the work I do as relationships.
2045.64s:  So I'm in a thousand different relationships because I've got a thousand clients. And I actually
2050.20s:  care as much or more than they do when they're paying taxes. You know, if they owe a bunch of money
2056.20s:  that we didn't foresee, I am like, oh my god, that's so painful. Yeah, I'm not writing the check. But
2061.96s:  I have compassion and empathy for my clients who even though they know they made the money
2068.20s:  psychologically, they didn't put the money aside. They were just like, oh, it won't be that bad.
2072.52s:  And then when we see the numbers, they're like, oh, my goodness. And so I feel for them because
2078.12s:  I know they're not sitting around going, I should be putting away 25% every day. And oh, I need,
2083.56s:  we're not all sitting around thinking about taxes. It's my job. So I am always thinking about taxes.
2088.52s:  Oh, that's going to come back and oh, we need to plan for this. And I try to help people
2093.16s:  outsmart themselves. So, you know, some business owners, they might just don't want to take a
2098.52s:  salary. And I'm like, look, take 500 bucks a week. It's all going to go to taxes. You won't miss it.
2103.24s:  And at the end of the year, we're going to have all your taxes, almost all your taxes paid.
2107.64s:  And then at the end of the year, we do it. And they're like, oh, this is much better.
2112.04s:  It's all paid. Like, yeah, there are ways to do it that don't have to be big,
2118.20s:  leaps. We can do things in baby steps, which is what I love. Small, digestible bites. And so
2124.12s:  that's what I try to do with my clients is lead them toward financial literacy, financial
2129.00s:  awareness, conscious, intentional, planning around their money so that they get a better outcome.
2135.24s:  But I don't try to do it by shame or telling how stupid they are. But by just trying to show them,
2141.40s:  here's some simple ways. Incromanally, we can start to get you ahead.
2145.08s:  I love that. I love that mindset. And I can tell you, even from our first conversation,
2151.56s:  that you are diamond and the rough, because I have talked to quite a few accounts at this point.
2155.96s:  And the way that you think about it is refreshing to hear, to be honest, because
2161.16s:  there's a lot that people can benefit from those kind of relationships, which really
2165.80s:  segues into my next question for you. Obviously, you know, you already have a thousand clients,
2171.64s:  there's going to be people that need a Bob Wheeler in their life, maybe they're in Florida,
2176.44s:  maybe there's somewhere else. What are some of the things you think people should look for when
2182.20s:  they're shopping for an accountant or a CPA, you know, when they're trying to make that jump?
2187.56s:  What are some of the qualities you think are useful for people to keep an eye out for?
2191.48s:  Well, one of the first things I think is important to ask if I'm in real estate.
2195.80s:  I want to know if the accountants got real estate. I want to know that they've had to actually
2201.32s:  deal with real time personally, with having to deal with the limitation of the $25,000,
2208.12s:  or having to deal with a 1031 exchange, or any of those things that are real estate.
2213.08s:  If I've got a lot of stocks and I've got all kinds of passive income and K1s,
2218.20s:  I want to make sure that that's something that they're comfortable with. It's amazing to me.
2222.84s:  And one of the things that's been great for me is I didn't want to be this standalone guy that
2230.20s:  worked out of his bedroom and his underwear doing 100 tax returns and calling it a day.
2234.84s:  I wanted to have other CPAs around me. I wanted to have a staff. And so I built a practice.
2239.80s:  And a lot of CPAs go into accounting because it's very logical. And so they're going to play it as
2247.96s:  safe as they can. They're going to not cross a line. They're going to stay 10 feet from the line.
2252.68s:  Well, if the line's over there, I'm going to move 10 feet and I'm going to touch the line.
2256.52s:  I'm not going to cross the line. And so I think some CPAs are just very
2262.52s:  not willing. They're so conservative. I don't understand it. Therefore, you can't take a deduction.
2266.68s:  I had a client come to me and we were looking at the returns and I said, you know, you've paid about
2271.80s:  $20,000, $30,000 for the last five years more than you should have. They were like, yeah,
2275.88s:  we just felt bad about leaving our account. And you know, they were getting older. And we knew we
2279.88s:  were paying. I was like, so you willingly paid $25,000 extra dollars for five years.
2287.16s:  Knowing it was a bad decision because you felt bad. Don't feel bad. Like, yeah,
2291.56s:  get the information. But you want to find somebody that you can gel with. If you want to be
2295.40s:  shamed, find a CPA that will shame you. I know a few of them. But there's a lot of folks out there
2301.08s:  like me that are actually trying to help people and actually care and really want to keep, like,
2306.60s:  we don't just do a return and go, there's your taxes, you owe money. No, we're going to go wait a minute.
2309.88s:  You sure there's not this. We'll do a tax return five or six times. Go wait, wait, wait, wait.
2314.60s:  One more thing. Let me think about this. You sure? And oh, sure enough, there's another piece of
2318.76s:  the pie that just brought it down. And so we tend to, you know, I tend to review tax returns four,
2324.28s:  five, six times and I sleep on it. A lot of stuff happens while I'm sleeping. I wake up and I'm like,
2327.64s:  oh my god, there's a passable oscario over I forgot about or they have this other business. And
2332.68s:  I don't just do it one and done who cares. It's just it's the Smith return. I'm looking at each one
2338.36s:  of these thinking about how if it were my tax return, am I doing the best? And so I want somebody
2344.20s:  that I know is going to advocate for me. I want to know somebody that knows how to deal with real
2348.12s:  estate. I want to know that somebody that's familiar with pension plans. If I'm a, if I'm a
2353.16s:  corporation and I'm trying to decide if I want a 401k or a defined benefit plan, I want somebody
2358.28s:  that understands those things. I want somebody that knows that if I started DB plan and I ended on
2363.32s:  1230 in the first year, I can get a double dip because I have a mismatched year that a lot of
2369.48s:  people will come to me and go, you can't do that. I'm like, check with your manager. You can do it.
2373.08s:  And they're like, oh my god, I didn't know that. You should know that, right? So you want people
2378.76s:  that are constantly trying to learn stuff. I don't, there's so much out there. I don't know everything.
2384.92s:  I have a lot of experience. I know a few things and I'm going to keep asking. So I don't go in with
2389.80s:  the assumption of like, I've got it all dialed in. I want to keep doing the best I can for people.
2394.92s:  I want to keep learning. So I think there's so much value in that approach too because it's exactly
2400.76s:  as you say it and especially as tax evolves and whatnot, it would be very difficult to be omnipotent
2406.12s:  perpetually. But I think, you know, you have the again, like the exact mindset I would be looking
2412.60s:  for, which is I know what questions to ask to get to the answer we need. And I think that that's
2418.28s:  tremendously valuable for any of your clients. So I know that we're coming up on time here.
2424.36s:  There's a couple, a couple lingering items I had for you. Yeah. The first one is you mentioned
2429.96s:  money self sabotage earlier, which was a very interesting terminology. I've heard of it before,
2436.36s:  but I'm generally unfamiliar with it. I would love to know a little bit more about that concept
2441.32s:  and what you see as it pertains to it. Yeah. So surprisingly, or maybe not, there are a lot of people
2448.12s:  out there that will say, I'm going to start a business. But unconsciously, they'll say to themselves,
2454.12s:  I know it won't happen for me. I'm the one person that it's not going to happen for. Right. And so
2460.20s:  they'll still go in and start the business and they'll do things to sabotage to be right about
2465.40s:  the fact that they're going to be the one person that can't make it work. I had a client who
2471.16s:  fortunately was very willing to talk, but every five years her business would go into the,
2476.60s:  just it would just go into the gutter. And you know, she'd be making a million dollars, a million
2480.76s:  dollars, almost bankrupt. This happened and she was client for like 20 years. And so this happened
2487.64s:  three times. And I said, let me ask you a, can we just talk a little bit? I just like, let's
2492.92s:  forget about the taxes, but let's just walk me through what's going on. Like you had this amazing
2497.32s:  year, you had this amazing year, then all of a sudden this happens and then what happens? And so
2502.12s:  we started talking it out and she realized that when she loses all of her money, her mom comes in
2509.80s:  and saves her. And her mom really loves to come in and show her that she's her savior, savior.
2515.16s:  And that's how she knows her mom loves her. And so I said, ah, that's a really long way to get
2521.32s:  an I love you. And then once she realized that she went, oh my God. Yeah, I could just ask my
2529.32s:  mom, hey, do you still love me? Right? I don't need to run the business into the ground to see if she'll
2534.04s:  come to my rescue. But that was the old story was mom will rescue me. And that's how I know she loves
2539.40s:  me. Once we got real clear on that, she was able to then say, okay, now I'm aware of what I'm doing.
2545.72s:  But when she would start to get depressed, nobody loves me, my life sucks. She would just slowly
2550.68s:  start self sabotaging the business so she could get to a place of mom's going to save me. I had
2557.08s:  another client and this happens a lot. Why? I had a client that had their own business. It was failing.
2562.92s:  They were given an opportunity to go run a division of a company and make $250,000.
2569.72s:  Eight weeks of vacation, all kinds of benefits. And I said to them, look, your business is not working.
2575.88s:  People aren't paying you. You don't enjoy that. You love doing what you do.
2580.20s:  Right. You should take this job, close down your company. The lease is coming up. This is the
2584.20s:  perfect time to walk away and transition and really make bank. He said, my mom will be so disappointed.
2591.16s:  I can't, I can't do this proactively. So in essence, he made a choice to let it. Yeah.
2599.72s:  He just, and so he let the business fail, but it wasn't his fault. He didn't walk away.
2605.96s:  Of course. But had he just walked away, okay, mom's upset a little bit. If you just said, hey, mom,
2611.80s:  these are the choices. This is actually advocating for myself. And so rather than do what makes the most
2618.28s:  sense, people will stick with, well, I made a promise or this person will be disappointed.
2624.60s:  Or, and so that's the self sabotages where I know better, but I'm not going to do it because it
2632.20s:  doesn't align with my story. That seems so counterintuitive to me. You know, I typically would assume
2638.92s:  business owners super pragmatic would, you know, perceive the problem for what it is and solve for
2644.36s:  the problem. But obviously you see this very like in-depth emotional side to this stuff. I wouldn't
2652.68s:  have guessed either of those stories. Like I just, yeah, like to me, it seems like if I see a business
2657.72s:  that's failing, I would think, okay, how do I maximize whatever I can out of this and then,
2661.56s:  you know, move on in the next. That's what I'm trying to do. But I'll share my own personal self-sabotage.
2669.88s:  So I've just sit for the CPA exam and you have to get a 70, 75 or 76 to pass.
2676.04s:  And yeah, that's all you need. That's all you need. We're almost, we're almost just like the Marine Corps.
2683.08s:  Not kidding. But I would go in and I'm like, man, if I can just get 75%. So I would get 75%
2690.12s:  of 75%. I wouldn't pass. And so I took this course that everybody said, if you take this course,
2696.20s:  it will take you over the line. This is what you need. And the first night, the instructor said,
2703.56s:  listen, I'm here to help all of you pass the CPA exam. But if you right now in your heart know that
2709.32s:  you can't pass the CPA exam or that you won't, you should get your money back because I guarantee you,
2715.16s:  you will make yourself right. And I said to myself, I know I'm not going to pass the CPA exam,
2720.92s:  but I hope this course will be what it takes to get me through it. And I didn't pass. It wasn't
2726.44s:  until I decided that I could pass it, that I passed it. And it was frustrating because people
2732.28s:  assumed I was a CPA before I was. And they're like, but someone says the CPA and you're smarter than
2736.84s:  him. And I'm like, yeah, I'm a bad test taker. Right. I had to find all these stories as to why I
2740.92s:  didn't do it. But the truth was I had a belief that deep down, I wasn't sure I could really be a CPA.
2747.96s:  And, and so I just kept letting that narrative dictate until I was ready to go, that's not serving me
2754.68s:  at its BS. Right. I, I cannot tell you how much I identify with you because for the longest time,
2762.68s:  I would always say to myself, I'm not good at math. And I used to say that to myself all the time.
2767.32s:  And guess what? I wasn't bad, but I wasn't good. Right. And I randomly just decided to stop allowing
2773.96s:  myself to say that. And then suddenly during my undergrad and grad, I took a bunch of statistics
2779.72s:  courses and it was off to the races. I still am not a savant at math, but I'm competent. And
2786.84s:  I love that you are even willing to share that kind of story because I think that a lot of
2792.44s:  people exhibit, again, both of us, right. We exhibit that exact behavior and it's probably pretty
2797.88s:  prevalent. So I think that's, that's a really powerful message. So we are wrapping up here.
2804.92s:  The last question I wanted to ask you before we get into how people can get a hold of you and
2809.80s:  things like that is what keeps you doing what you do as a CPA? Like why do you choose to continue to
2818.04s:  run your business? Why don't you just go be a full-time comedian? Go do something else? What
2822.76s:  keeps you there? You know, well, a couple things. It's always been there for me when everything
2828.68s:  else wasn't and it's something that I'm good at. And so that's been something that just gives me comfort.
2834.04s:  But the reality is I love people. I like being with people. I like connecting with people. And for
2839.08s:  me, it's a way that I can help people in an industry where not everybody is willing to help. And I think
2844.92s:  most of my clients get that I'm advocating for them and that I actually really care about them as
2850.44s:  a person. I actually care more about making sure they feel good about what we've done than me making
2856.36s:  an extra 300 bucks. I'd rather lose 500 bucks or wave the fee on a tax return than feel like I've
2862.68s:  given up my integrity. And I think people hopefully resonate with that. But you know, I like helping people.
2869.64s:  And this is something that I'm good at. And it's something that just even when I worked for
2874.20s:  other CPA firms, you know, I would help do things. And of course, my bosses would go take credit for
2879.08s:  my stuff. I'm like, oh, that's sort of not nice. But at the end of the day, I knew that I had
2885.40s:  had a knack for this stuff and that, you know, I love it. It's somewhere I can feel like I shine.
2892.36s:  That's, it's awesome. I had a sneaky suspicion that was going to be something in line with
2897.16s:  your answer because I could tell, you know, that even the information you've really shared here
2902.20s:  is impactful. And that like wanting to help people really, I think is so awesome. I love that
2908.12s:  about you. So speaking of helping people, if somebody needs your help, how can they get a hold of you?
2912.92s:  The best way to get a hold of me is our website, the Money Nerve, which also has my CPA firm. It's got
2918.84s:  my workshops. It's got all kinds of free resources. The money nerve.com. And then info at the Money
2925.88s:  Nerve is the best way to reach me. And again, I've got a CPA firm, but that information's on the
2931.16s:  website. It's just easier to have it all in one place. And we can help people with their, with their
2936.52s:  taxes. We do a lot of international. We do multi-state. Small business corporations is our, is our
2943.40s:  sort of niche. And, but I also do other things, workshops, work with people one on one on their
2949.00s:  money, mindsets and financial coaching, slash therapy. Anything about money? Let's talk about money.
2955.00s:  And let's try and take those emotions out. Bob, you're absolutely awesome. Thank you so much
