0.00s: What is going on everybody? I am here with the man, the myth, the legend, the comedian,
8.00s: the CPA, the therapist, the, I'm pretty sure you were a professional. I'm just kidding,
12.80s: but you really do. You really seem to do a little bit of everything, which is awesome,
19.00s: but I'm here with Bob Wheeler. I was actually on your podcast pretty recently and I literally
24.04s: love the conversation. Like I was just telling you before we started the recording, you
27.60s: are one of those gems that makes talking about tax engaging and I think there's a lot you
34.40s: bring to the table. So first off, thank you so much for, you know, since some time
38.36s: aside to come talk to us. Well, absolutely. I love talking about taxes. I love talking
42.84s: about money. We all think about it. So my is well at least make it a little bit fun.
48.44s: Yeah. So and I think the perfect intro is a lot of people when they think about taxes,
53.84s: right? We, it's not really something a lot of people want to dive into. It's complicated.
59.04s: It's busy. There's not, it's not very fun paying taxes. So how the hell did you become
64.56s: a CPA? What threw you in that direction? Well, you know, I wanted to be a lawyer and then
70.16s: I met a few lawyers and I was like, yeah, I don't want to do that. So I was actually taking
74.64s: accounting classes just to help my great point average, believe it or not. And I was like,
80.24s: and of course, it's not something you can go into if it's easy because it's got to be painful
84.00s: if you're going to make money. So, but ultimately, ultimately, I accounting was something I really
89.12s: enjoyed and came easy. But, you know, as I got into my tax practice, I just realized so many people
97.20s: had so many issues and the truth is, so did I. I was telling other people follow these rules,
102.00s: but then I wasn't following them because I had an excuse in a story and a mindset. And so,
108.08s: once I started looking at my own personal mindset and self sabotage around money,
113.12s: and I started talking with my clients, mostly that are entrepreneurs and people making nice
117.76s: incomes, getting into their stories because even like this last week has been tax deadlines and
125.44s: so many clients, even though they're making a half million dollars, generating a million dollars
129.28s: in grocery revenue, they're like, this is the worst year ever. I didn't make any money. I'm like,
134.32s: you got three houses in La Jolla. You just flew to Paris, not buying it, right? But their mindset is
142.72s: there's such impoverty. And I'm sure there are many people would be happy to swap out with them.
146.64s: But so that's really got me fascinated. It was just how we have the subconscious money mindset
152.16s: that we're operating with. We're making decisions all day long. And we're trying to figure out how to
158.00s: get through it and navigate it. And we don't know and we think everybody else knows, but we don't. And so,
162.48s: that was just really, I wanted to be able to help people. And I wasn't because I was like,
167.52s: oh, I'm so much better than everybody else. And I learned all this stuff. I wanted to be able to
170.64s: learn the rules. So I can figure out where to push the rules, right? Because if I don't know the
174.80s: rules, then I can't know that I crossed a line or I can't know where I can push and reinterpret. So
181.92s: figured, learn the rules and see how I can help people.
185.84s: I love that. And I actually really admire the fact that you tie in the concept of helping people,
190.48s: because most people, when they think about, oh, you know, damn, I gotta go talk to the accountant,
194.88s: you know, this is gonna suck. But I have actually found that exact thing that literally I was just
200.72s: talking to my accountant last week. And the conversations I have with him, it always feels like a very
206.08s: team, team project. And one of the things I noticed from his perspective, and I'm curious if you
212.64s: identify it with this is that, yes, there are the rules. But then it seems like every, you know,
218.88s: client has like its individual puzzle pieces that you're trying to move. Do you view it as a puzzle
224.16s: or how do you view, you know, the list of issues that you're trying to solve for your clients?
228.88s: Yeah, absolutely. It's definitely a puzzle. And every person is unique. And so I need to know the
234.16s: story. So when I'm gonna tax return, when the government looks at it, it needs to at least in theory
241.36s: feel like a nonfiction, right? Right? Maybe it based on a true story. But I want to go in there
249.60s: and get the facts. And so I was explaining to somebody the other day, a high profile person who
254.72s: has his account is not writing certain things off. You know, if I'm a teacher and they, and you
261.36s: cut, and I come in and say, look, I'm spending $80,000 a year in travel. That's probably not realistic.
268.40s: Probably $80,000 worth of travel doesn't apply to my business. But if I'm an influencer,
273.28s: if I'm somebody in the public eye and I'm traveling all the time and I'm going to events,
278.72s: $80,000 a travel might be just a drop in the bucket. And so knowing what the story is so that I can
285.60s: look at that and say, well, that's a gray area. But actually, I can support the fact that this
289.92s: supports your business. And if I can find a tie-in, most of the time the IRS, they might say, well,
295.68s: we agree with you 90% or actually we agree with that line of thinking. And so it's learning
302.08s: each person's story and then figuring out how can I advocate for them and keep them on track,
307.84s: right? We want to avoid taxes. We don't want to evade them. I'm not looking for prison time.
312.08s: I want to do what's right. But there are lots of places where there's a lot left open for
316.80s: interpretation. And I'm going to push it to the envelope when I can.
321.44s: I you're hitting like the things that I look for in the county, which is actually one of my future
327.28s: questions because one of the things that I found early on is like everybody else, I was super cheap
332.72s: and I wanted to do my own taxes. And I actually think for simple tax profiles, it's a good exercise
339.04s: because you at least understand some of it. But then when I started doing the YouTube stuff and
346.00s: the trading and all these other things, I found, okay, like this is getting kind of heavy. And
351.12s: when I had my first conversation with one of the accountants, I was kind of interviewing
356.08s: not for the channel, but like for my business. And they made it sound like, oh, I try to follow
362.56s: the letter of the law, stay away from audits, stay as far away. I never get audited, nothing like that.
368.48s: And I'm sitting there thinking like, that seems like an interesting approach. Obviously,
372.56s: audits not ideal, but I loved that you talked about the gray area and trying to find something that
378.80s: there's some room for interpretation. So can you talk a little bit about just that gray area
385.60s: and how you look at your different clients and perceive, okay, maybe I could push a little bit here,
391.92s: maybe not so much here. Yeah, so again, I work with a lot of entrepreneurs. I'm in LA. I work with a
399.20s: lot of entertainers. I work with a lot of people in the entertainment industry. So somebody that's
405.04s: got Hulu and Netflix and Disney Plus and all those things, they might actually really be watching
410.40s: this stuff. Yeah, one, because they want to watch it, but two, because it applies to their job,
414.32s: they might be wanting to look at how something's edited. They want to see what kind of music's
417.84s: popping these days. And so there might actually be a reason that they're going in,
423.60s: getting on the internet, looking to make sure that they're getting the royalties for the stuff that
427.28s: showed up on a TV gig and things like that. So there might be real reasons that that is research
434.40s: and not just a personal, oh, I need to watch TV. Same thing with whether it's travel. Maybe I'm
442.72s: building some real estate portfolio and I'm traveling to other cities because maybe it's better
447.76s: buying property in Ohio than it is in Los Angeles. And so I want to go check those things out. Or
453.60s: maybe I'm thinking of starting a business with a buddy and they live in another state. So I want
458.00s: to go travel and you know, and maybe it doesn't pan out, but it's still an expense in exploring,
464.16s: expanding my business. And so I want to look at those different things and see if there's
469.92s: a reasonableness to incorporating that into the business. There are certain things like, you know,
475.68s: I remember I had this client that was just, I go to Costco and everything's business. And I'm like,
480.88s: yeah, that's a let's don't be greedy. They got audited and you know, had they the auditor even said,
486.80s: look, if they had done every other receipt or if they had taken half of all the receipts,
491.60s: but they were going through there like toothbrush, underwear, and some people would say, well,
496.72s: you know, I need underwear to go to work. Well, maybe you do, maybe you don't, but it's a personal
502.80s: item. Your dog is not your company mascot, right? So there are certain things. If you're buying
508.32s: stuff that Victoria's secret, unless you're a model, it's probably not a write-off. Maybe if you're
514.56s: on a MyFans page or something like that, you might talk about my business like that. That's my
518.72s: other business. You got to do what you got to do. You got to do what you got to do. I just had to pay
523.52s: $690 from a utility bill. That only fans page really needs to get popped into exactly.
531.76s: But yes, so that's what we're doing. We're trying to look at those areas where, where can we
536.32s: maximize and does it make sense? And there's other places where I'm like, you know, you did not
540.32s: spend $80,000 in dry cleaning. You will work at a bank. Right. So one of the fascinating things
550.40s: about your story is obviously the line between comedian and CPA. Those seem like dichotomies.
560.56s: I have got to know how those two exist in the same ecosystem for you.
567.36s: Well, it's funny. Bob Newhart is my role model. He was a CPA for the sales department.
577.44s: I'm always analyzing. With comedy, you're always analyzing. You're always observing. You're paying
581.60s: attention to things. And then how do I bring that back in? So in a way, it's the same thing when
585.44s: I'm doing a county. I'm looking, I'm looking for, I play detective. I'm trying to ask for the
590.00s: questions you're not sharing with me. I'm trying to read into the paperwork that you think I won't
594.96s: figure out. And so really, most of my job is playing detective and being really incredibly skeptical.
601.68s: Because clients will say to me, oh, this and this happened. I'm like, really? Because it seems
606.56s: like this in this app. Oh, yeah, you're right. Or the client will call me up and say, you screwed
611.68s: up my taxes. You put down. I made $300,000. I'm like, okay, did you make this deposit? This one,
616.88s: this one, this, yeah, yeah, that equals 300,000. Where's my money? Well, that's a different question.
621.84s: But the numbers are right. So for me, being able to use those skills as a comic also then helps
629.60s: me to get people to let their defenses down. Share information with me. I don't joke about people's
634.80s: tax spills. I'm not like, oh, my God, look at you owe this much money. I know there are certain
639.04s: things where I can't really joke, but I can use it as a way to play around and get information
644.96s: from people to just relax them because people do come in very tense when they're meeting with
648.72s: their CPAs most of the time. Yeah. And I think the other correlation that I consider is the fact that
656.00s: you know, you talked about that great area in a CPI, which in or a CPA, like when you're looking at
661.36s: taxes, and in my mind, I'm thinking like, that's there's some creative license in there to see what
666.08s: kind of story you could tell. So I could totally see how those two actually play off of each other
671.12s: specifically a comedian to CPA. That's actually a really good structure, I think. So when I think
678.16s: about traders in general, which is most of my people, you know, we hate taxes just like everybody else
687.04s: and we expose ourselves to additional tax, right? So most of us, they get a paycheck from somewhere,
693.52s: put it in a trading account and then they start trading. So and ideally at the end of the year,
698.32s: we walk away with some money. One of the things that I see traders talk about is wash sales and
706.64s: tax harvesting. So I want to talk about a couple of those specific concepts with you and to get your
713.52s: thought process. So wash sales, could you walk us through, you know, you don't even have to speak to
719.84s: me like I'm five because I mentally, so just speak to me and tell me, you know, what wash sales are in
726.72s: your world. Yeah. So wash sale is, you know, a lot of times we'll sell off stock to create a loss so
734.48s: we can take that loss to offset some gains because maybe we just don't have any faith in that that
739.04s: stocks can ever recover. And so we might do that or we might sell some stuff, we might sell some
744.08s: stock off, take the loss and then repurchase some stock thinking, oh, I'll get that loss.
750.64s: However, there's this wash sale rule that says if you do that within 30 days and you turn around
757.68s: and sell that, we're not going to give you the loss. You're not going to get that right now.
763.12s: And so what happened in the last couple of years is I had a couple clients with four,
766.96s: five, six hundred thousand dollars worth of wash sales. They were correctly thinking,
771.92s: create if I generate a loss, I can take it against my other capital gains, what they didn't realize was
777.60s: I needed to wait more than 30 days. And so there is a big disconnect. And when we got to the taxes,
785.20s: I'm like, well, you've got a million dollar gain and they're like, no, you did it wrong. No, you did
789.68s: it wrong. You weren't paying attention to the 30 day rule. And so if you're going to be trading for
796.00s: people out there that they're just starting, have some conversations, do a little research, find out
800.64s: what a long term and a short term capital gain is. The tax isn't always 15%. And even though it might
807.36s: be 15%, it might also be plus 4% for the additional investment tax that gets added on that a lot of
814.08s: people don't factor in. And if you're making over a couple hundred thousand dollars, these are some
819.44s: extra taxes you got to be careful about. And so a lot of my clients are like, what's this? Well,
826.00s: you got to know the rules. And that's again, why I became a CPI, I want to know the rules.
830.40s: So I can figure out how to work around them. If you don't know the rules when you're trading,
834.72s: you're going to put yourself in a bad situation. And I was sharing with you, I have a client who had
839.04s: had a, had a almost a million dollar capital gain. And he sold it two days within being a long-term
845.52s: capital gain. He'd been trading forever. And so when I asked him, don't you know that, do you know the
849.84s: difference between short-term and long-term? He's like, I have no idea what you're talking about.
854.16s: And with the money he's putting in the market, that's something you might want to know. It's a small fact.
860.40s: Small fun fact. Don't pay extra taxes. Wait two days.
867.52s: And I think that, you know, there is always this bit of, you don't know what you don't know.
872.64s: Right. That's why it's so useful to talk to people like you. So obviously we have the
878.88s: the wash sale stuff. And I think that the overview did, there was super useful. Can you talk to us
884.40s: a little bit about short-term versus long-term capital gains tax?
889.12s: Yes. So basically anything held a year or less, you know, is a short-term capital gain. And
895.04s: that means you're going to, whatever tax bracket you're in, that's the tax you're paying.
899.44s: Now you might be in the 24% tax bracket and effectively paying 17% because it's a graduated
905.76s: table. But the fact of the matter is, you know, some of these clients of mine will get RSUs,
912.80s: they'll get all these stock options and things, and they get added to their paycheck. And so their
917.92s: W2 will say they made a million dollars and they're like, they made a mistake. I only made 400,000.
922.80s: Well, 600,000 is short-term capital gains basically that you're paying on that later on when you sell
929.76s: the stock, you'll have basis. Right. But in that moment, you're paying ordinary income tax. And so
937.44s: it's really important to know that GFI wait two days, if I can wait two days and pay that lower
943.76s: tax rate, I definitely want to do it. And so I think again, people are just not aware of,
949.60s: oh, there's a real big difference between short-term and long-term and sometimes it's just waiting
953.84s: a day or two. Right. And that's an important factor. And I think the other piece which you mentioned
960.08s: about calling the losses, harvesting the losses. And this can be good, but again, here's a thing
967.76s: that's come up with me several times this year. Somebody will say, you know what? I lost $100,000
972.56s: in crypto. Man, I can't wait to write that off on your taxes. And I'm like, wow, you're going to be
977.28s: writing off $3,000. And they're like, no, no, no, no, I lost $100,000. I get to write off $100,000.
984.56s: Do you have $100,000 worth of capital gains? No, you're going to be writing off $3,000. And so I'm
990.64s: surprised at how many people still don't understand that on your tax return, that line item is not going
997.44s: to be more than $3,000. Right. Unless you've released some passive losses from the sale of some real
1003.20s: estate or something like that. But for the most part, you can only offset your losses against capital
1009.76s: gains and then plus three. And I think there's a big disconnect there. The example that I give is
1015.68s: I had a client who had a million dollars worth of capital losses. Somebody walked in and offered
1023.60s: to pay him $3,000,000 for his house. And he had after his exemptions and everything,
1028.40s: he had a million dollar capital gain. Well, he paid no tax on that because the stock happened
1034.96s: the year before the house happened the next year. Now, if he had reversed that and he had sold the
1041.84s: house in the first year and then he lost a million dollars, he would have paid tax on the million.
1047.20s: And then he would have written off $3,000 a year until eternity. Right. And so it's so important to
1055.20s: pay attention to that capital loss piece because I had another client who was buying appreciating stock,
1061.68s: buying appreciating stock, very risky stuff, ultimately lost about $7,800,000. Then the financial
1069.36s: advisor moved them into high dividend stocks. So now the sudden she's getting $80,000 in dividends.
1078.48s: And I'm writing off $3,000 a year on this 700,000. I finally called the broker and I said,
1085.36s: hey, you got to understand. I need you to be buying appreciating stock, not stock that's paying
1091.52s: dividends. They're like, oh, got it. Right. So you got to be CPA and your financial advisor need to
1099.20s: be communicating. I to be honest, I love that you bring that up and I find for myself, I'll talk to
1107.20s: my accountant at least quarterly, typically even more than that, at least via email and stuff,
1111.76s: because some of the timing things that you brought up, especially the one about the house and
1116.16s: the capital loss, like that is really important for people because that is a huge difference.
1122.72s: And what the money you take home looks like. So I think little things like that are so incredibly
1129.76s: useful. Now I want to ask your thoughts on something. I lament the tax harvesting mindset for
1140.88s: traders. It bothers me. But from your background, specifically coming at this from like a money
1147.60s: psychology perspective, when you think about it, obviously there is a benefit to that in terms
1153.68s: of the overall tax picture. But do you see people who are using that as an excuse for essentially bad
1160.40s: positions they had? And it gives them an easy out. Yeah, you know, it's interesting. You know,
1167.28s: when people come to me and say, oh my god, look, I'm going to be I'm able to create a loss and
1171.20s: they're super excited. I always say you created a loss. Like let's start there. Let's not get
1178.24s: excited. You lost money. Right. Now it's great that we're going to get a tax benefit if we can.
1183.60s: And so let's use it. But let's don't get excited about losses. Me personally, and this is probably
1189.52s: at my own little bit of emotional peace in there, even though you should not use emotions when
1192.96s: you're investing or doing business decisions. But I'm always holding hope out that even my worst
1200.56s: stock is going to one day turn around and rally and freaking I'm going to get my money back.
1206.80s: Yep. Just just waiting to catch a bid. I'm just waiting. And so, you know, I'm not as excited to
1213.12s: sell it off because in my mind, it's a loss. And yes, I know sometimes you have to cut your losses.
1218.64s: And I know there are a lot of people out there that will just buy and sell based on a schedule and
1224.24s: not look emotionally at how it's doing. You know, it's like, yep, it's time to sell. But
1230.32s: me personally, when I've got clients that I know, if they're advisor and everybody's like the
1235.12s: stocks never going to rebound, okay, take your losses and get the benefit for sure. But I,
1242.08s: you know, me personally, I tend to like wait till the last minute because I hold out hope.
1248.16s: Yeah. And I just don't like the, I don't like being in the mindset of, hooray, I lost money.
1255.60s: I'm in the, you know, my hope is that I'm always making money.
1258.96s: Yeah, I always viewed that as, you know, the ego obviously is so powerful. And I always thought
1264.88s: that that was just a way for the ego to preserve itself because I feel the same as you do.
1270.16s: Most people will say, oh, well, you know, I don't want to get taxed on this. And I typically would
1275.28s: say something like you get taxed on gains. Yeah, we want to get taxed as little for sure. But
1282.16s: it's only on gains. So chill, fuck out and accept the fact that this isn't the worst case scenario
1288.00s: here. Um, yeah. So a couple of things that I wanted to pick your brain on. The first one is I
1294.48s: personally found that when I started integrating real estate into my broader portfolio, specifically
1301.84s: is it pertained to trading by end of your taxes actually started looking a lot better.
1308.00s: I wanted to get your thoughts on the integration of real estate and its ability to help you as
1314.72s: a CPA help essentially somebody's tax footprint, you know, your over year.
1321.52s: So I like real estate. I'm not going to say, so I would say I love it, but it's not always fun,
1328.80s: right? Real estate can I've got so many nightmare stories. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.
1334.40s: But I've had clients where real estate would really help them and they will say my dad was in real
1339.04s: estate. It was a nightmare. I will never do it just because dealing with tenants. So that just
1344.16s: means you need to find somebody to manage the properties or invest in a reate, right? Like you
1349.92s: could still get into real estate and not have to be the property manager. But having said that,
1356.56s: I do think that real estate is such a great way to save on taxes, even if it's not immediate.
1366.16s: Right. Right. And so for a lot of my clients, we're not going to get the $25,000 right off.
1372.40s: And maybe they're a real estate professional and then they put in the time and they meet the
1376.48s: requirements. And then maybe I'm going to get that right off. But most of my clients, it's going to
1380.40s: sit and I tell them, you're going to have this bucket. It's just filling up with passive losses.
1385.52s: And one day you'll get them. What I like about that sometimes as well is if my client doesn't
1394.40s: you know, I'm not saying I do this all the time. But if I have a client that doesn't have the
1397.20s: best to receipts, but they know they spent $20 or $30,000. Well, if I put that in on a passive loss,
1404.72s: loss that's going to be suspended, nobody's coming in and looking through my numbers and going,
1408.16s: wait a minute, wait a minute. So I may be picking up losses that I'm not going to realize for 10,
1413.92s: 15 years. Right. Nobody's going to come back and ask me to explain those numbers 10, 15 years
1419.60s: later. And so I'm not as worried about my numbers because I'm not taking them right now. So even if
1426.56s: somebody's spending a lot of money renovating a yard or redoing a kitchen and it's a lot of money,
1432.08s: I'm not taking the loss. The IRS doesn't care at that point. Right. And so I've got a little wiggle room.
1438.24s: But being able to knowing that you've got that and then understanding that you've got these
1444.16s: passive losses, that's one reason to be with an accountant and stay with an account because I've had
1448.96s: a couple of situations. I had somebody come in and say, look, I was so excited to sell my property.
1453.28s: Everybody told me I was going to get a big refund. My accountant did my taxes and I owe $40,000.
1458.16s: Well, I looked when I looked at the return, they forgot to pick up. They forgot to release all the
1462.16s: passive losses when they sold the property. Instead of owing a significant amount of money, he ended
1467.36s: up getting back 20,000. Right. But thankfully, he came and asked me. But by the same token, I had a client
1474.48s: who was like, look, you're just doing a schedule, E that's losing me money. And I'm just going to go
1481.04s: and do my taxes myself. And I said, okay, that's fine. I totally get it. You want to save 700 bucks.
1486.40s: But here's the thing. Do me a favor. Let me see your tax return before you send it off just the first
1490.96s: year because I'm afraid you're not going to pick up the passive losses. And sure enough, they didn't
1495.04s: pick up the passive losses. And they had a couple hundred thousand dollars. Well, if you've got
1500.24s: those passive losses and your income drops below the one 50 and you can start tapping into that bucket.
1506.72s: You're reducing taxes. And again, they saved 700 bucks. But if I hadn't been adamant, said, look,
1512.96s: you've been a long time client. Let me look at your return anyway. They would have just lost so much
1520.16s: money. But hey, they saved 700 bucks. Right. Yeah. And it's forced through the trees, right? Like,
1526.00s: yeah, whenever it comes time to pay the CPA, it's always not not the greatest time on earth because
1531.68s: it can be expensive. But yeah, I do think and I personally have found tremendous value in it,
1537.44s: especially over when I was doing my own taxes, even when my own taxes were simple. So I genuinely think
1543.04s: you guys are worth your weight and gold. And speaking of that, one of the things I love talking to
1549.12s: CPAs about is you have the perspective to see what lots of people are doing with their money. And
1555.52s: what really successful people are doing, what moderately successful people are doing. I would love to,
1561.28s: you know, and obviously I know you can't get super far in detail, but from like a high level overview,
1565.76s: what are some of the common threads you see very successfully financially speaking people doing
1572.48s: that maybe, you know, other people would need to be privy to or would like to be privy to.
1578.00s: So I think that a lot of people invest in real estate. And even if they're not managing it themselves,
1587.60s: they're either, I mean, some people put money in reads. I don't see that as much. But I do see people
1593.44s: buying in real estate and having somebody else take care of that. The other big thing I would say
1600.48s: is that a lot of people do have their brokerage accounts, but they don't manage them themselves.
1605.60s: They've got somebody else staying on top of it because they don't have the time. They're busy.
1610.72s: Now, unless you've got the time and you want to be a trader and things like that, that's different.
1615.28s: But a lot of my clients are trying to create their business or come up with the next big thing.
1621.04s: And they don't have time and paying somebody that money, that one or two percent
1626.16s: to keep growing their portfolio. Those are the people that I see significant growth for the most part.
1634.56s: And I also, which great is I have a few clients that will say, okay, can you just look at my portfolio
1639.68s: and tell me that they made me a lot of money or it's worth paying them the 2% because they seem,
1646.96s: it seems expensive. Now, one of the things I think it's important to think about in terms of a
1651.92s: financial advisor, their job, in my opinion, isn't to make you millions of dollars. If you've got
1657.36s: millions of dollars, their job is to preserve it. And to then grow it, but not in a way that's your
1664.00s: responsible. And so, yeah, it's great that some of these people can go out and say, oh, I'm going
1669.36s: to make you all this money. But again, you got to be choosy about your financial advisor. Do the
1673.84s: research. Make sure they feel comfortable to you because I had a client who really wanted to get
1679.12s: into investing. They were nervous to come to a broker that I knew. I said, leave the money in a
1685.36s: savings account for six months before you do any investing. Sure, sure, sure. Three months later,
1690.72s: they've invested it in something. It loses $20,000. His $100,000 loses $20,000. And I called up
1697.44s: the broker and I was like, what did you do? You just broke his trust. And the broker says to me,
1703.20s: it was a sure thing. And I said, well, if it was a sure thing, there'd be $20,000 more in his bank
1707.92s: account. It's not a sure thing. And so, of course, that guy never wanted to invest his money again,
1713.76s: ever again. And he didn't trust anybody. And of course, I never used that broker again. It's all
1719.12s: about trust. And so you've got to trust your broker. If they're asking to borrow money from you,
1723.92s: that's illegal and run. But you'd be surprised how many clients have told me an advisor asked to
1730.16s: borrow some money or asked him to invest in something on the side. Run for the hills. But it is
1737.04s: important, I think, having an advisor or somebody that's in the know if you don't have the time. So
1744.40s: now I do also have clients that invest in silver and gold and stuff like that, precious metals.
1748.56s: I don't see that as much. I like investing in that stuff because I'm assuming the apocalypse is
1754.24s: coming. I live in LA. I want to have little silver coins to buy my food. But that's, you know,
1761.28s: that's the, you know, that's my, the world is not coming to an end. But just in case it does,
1765.68s: I'm going to have lots of little silver coins. Hopefully those are still in in vogue at that point.
1771.36s: Exactly. So when I think about just people's approach to finances and something I've thought
1781.84s: about myself is I went through a pretty prolonged phase where I was cavalier with risk. And then
1790.64s: I got bit. I had a huge portfolio drawdown because like most traders, I am a fucking idiot.
1797.76s: And I made poor choices. But, you know, luckily I was able to find my way through that.
1803.36s: One of the things I'm curious about, we were talking just a little bit about kind of the
1807.68s: psychology there behind different finance choices. And one of the things I feel like is a lot of
1814.56s: my generation, I'm a millennial, I'm 31, but it feels like a lot of us are very risk averse.
1820.16s: And I'm curious if you see that kind of thing from your side of the equation.
1824.80s: Yeah, I mean, nobody really likes to lose money. For the most part, I mean there are maybe
1832.16s: a few people that find joy in it, but I don't. No, I think most people are risk averse, especially
1838.40s: as they've started to accumulate a little bit. You know, I got a hundred bucks and I lose a hundred
1842.48s: bucks who cares. You know, I'm buying some penny stock right now. It's 1500 bucks. I lose 1500
1847.28s: bucks. Who cares? If it turns out to be 800,000 sweet. But like, but other stuff, you know, even
1854.32s: myself, even though I know don't get emotional about investments, you know, I put some money into
1859.20s: a couple of funds. And then of course, everything tanks. And I'm still like, and I know it will turn
1865.12s: around. And I know I can play the game of waiting, but still emotionally. So, hey, don't go in and
1871.84s: look at your brokerage statement every day. If you've got a lot of money sitting in things you're
1875.52s: not going to move for a while, then don't go in and just remind yourself of the pain. Just wait
1881.60s: it out. Like don't create more anxiety. But I haven't come across a lot of clients that are willing
1887.52s: to take a lot of risk. The client that I was saying that had that 700,000 worth of losses and high
1894.24s: yield dividend stock, she was investing in stuff that was incredibly risky in her 80s. And she
1900.72s: was like, I don't care. You know, and she's like, because if I hit it, I hit it. And you know,
1906.40s: where's Ksenaria? I'll sell my house. It's worth a couple million. But I was like, oh, this is so
1911.68s: dangerous for you. She's like, I love her. I'm doing it anyway. She was a, she was a trailblazer. I
1916.96s: loved her. She just recently passed, but she was, she was, you know, she didn't care, but she was not
1922.88s: the norm. Most people are right. And you don't want to be from a scarcity mindset of like, oh my
1927.52s: God, I have to hold on to everything ever forever. You got money, ebbs and flows. So you got to,
1933.20s: you can't hold money so tight that it can't grow and leave. You know, it's just going to suffocate
1938.56s: if you just hold on to it. But finding that balance of a tolerating a little bit of a, a little loss
1944.64s: and a little bit of risk. But like, I don't even like going to Vegas. And like when I was 20s,
1949.76s: man, let me go in and blow my money in Vegas. Now, I don't even want to spend a hundred bucks,
1953.92s: unless I consciously say I spend a hundred bucks and then I walk away because I don't want to give
1958.00s: away a hundred bucks. That's a hundred bucks that could buy a stock. That's a hundred bucks that,
1962.16s: I could do something with it. Either they just give it to the casino. Yeah. And I like that because
1968.08s: I think a big part of at least finance for me over time has been learning like what I actually value.
1974.08s: Like what is worth the purchase for me? What is not worth the purchase for me? And where's the
1978.64s: marginal utility? And I think you hit on a good, a good bit of that there. So a couple other
1984.56s: questions I wanted to ask you. Obviously, you know, there's all different kinds of CPAs out there,
1990.56s: different philosophies, different approaches to taxes. But if you were to summarize your approach
1997.68s: to tax in general, what are like, how would you summarize it? Like what's your general strategy?
2005.12s: So my strategy is let's figure out how to avoid taxes. I love working with entrepreneurs because
2010.24s: I've got corporations. I've got structures in place that I can use to my advantage. You know,
2015.52s: I don't really work with a lot of W2 people because I can't do a whole lot. Unless you've got
2021.60s: rental property and things like that. So I want to I work with people with more complicated
2026.16s: returns because I can actually make a difference there. But somebody can walk in making $500,000
2033.12s: on a W2. I can't do anything for you. There's nowhere to go. And so we work with people as a team.
2040.72s: I don't look at tax returns as tax returns. I look at the work I do as relationships. So I'm in
2046.24s: a thousand different relationships because I've got a thousand clients. And I actually care as much
2051.52s: or more than they do when they're paying taxes. You know, if they owe a bunch of money that we
2056.48s: didn't foresee, I am like, oh my god, that's so painful. Yeah, I'm not writing the check. But
2062.00s: I have compassion and empathy for my clients who even though they know they made the money
2068.16s: psychologically, they didn't put the money aside. They were just like, oh, it won't be that bad.
2072.48s: And then when we see the numbers, they're like, oh, my goodness. And so I feel for them because
2078.16s: I know they're not sitting around going, I should be putting away 25% every day. And oh, I need,
2083.60s: we're not all sitting around thinking about taxes. It's my job. So I am always thinking about
2087.92s: taxes. And oh, that's going to come back and oh, we need to plan for this. And I try to help people
2093.12s: outsmart themselves. So, you know, some business owners, they might just don't want to take a
2098.48s: salary. And I'm like, look, take 500 bucks a week. It's all going to go to taxes. You won't miss it.
2103.20s: And at the end of the year, we're going to have all your taxes, almost all your taxes paid.
2107.68s: And then at the end of the year, we do it. And they're like, oh, this is much better.
2111.84s: Right. It's all paid. Like, yeah, there are ways to do it that don't have to be big leaps. We can do
2119.20s: things in baby steps, which is what I love. Small, digestible bites. And so that's what I try to do with
2125.04s: my clients is lead them toward financial literacy, financial awareness, conscious, intentional
2131.68s: planning around their money so that they get a better outcome. But I don't try to do it by shame
2138.48s: or telling how stupid they are. But by just trying to show them, here's some simple ways.
2142.80s: Incramentally, we can start to get you ahead.
2146.16s: I love that. I love that mindset. And I can tell you, even from our first conversation, that
2152.00s: you are a diamond in the rough, because I have talked to quite a few accounts at this point. And
2156.88s: the way that you think about it is refreshing to hear, to be honest, because there's a lot that
2162.56s: people can benefit from those kind of relationships, which really segues into my next question for you.
2168.40s: Obviously, you know, you already have a thousand clients. There's going to be people that need a
2173.84s: Bob Wheeler in their life. Maybe they're in Florida. Maybe there's some more else. What are some
2178.48s: of the things you think people should look for when they're shopping for an accountant or a CPA?
2185.12s: You know, when they're trying to make that jump, what are some of the qualities you think
2188.96s: are useful for people to keep an eye out for? Well, one of the first things I think is important to
2193.84s: ask if I'm in real estate. I want to know if the accountants got real estate. I want to know
2200.16s: that they've had to actually deal with real time personally, with having to deal with the
2206.16s: limitation of the $25,000 or having to deal with a 1031 exchange. Or any of those things that
2212.24s: are real estate. If I've got a lot of stocks and I've got all kinds of passive income and K1s,
2218.16s: I want to make sure that that's something that they're comfortable with. It's amazing to me. And
2223.04s: one of the things that's been great for me is I didn't want to be this standalone guy that worked
2230.48s: out of his bedroom and his underwear doing 100 tax returns and calling it a day. I wanted to have
2235.60s: other CPAs around me. I wanted to have a staff. And so I built a practice and a lot of CPAs
2243.04s: go into accounting because it's very logical. And so they're going to play it as safe as they can.
2249.20s: They're going to not cross a line. They're going to stay 10 feet from the line. Well, if the lines
2253.44s: over there, I'm going to move 10 feet and I'm going to touch the line. I'm not going to cross the line.
2257.76s: And so I think some CPAs are just very not willing. They're so conservative. I don't understand it.
2265.04s: Therefore, you can't take a deduction. I had a client come to me and we were looking at the
2269.52s: returns and I said, you know, you've you've paid about $20,000, $30,000 for the last five years,
2273.68s: more than you should have. They were like, yeah, we just felt bad about leaving our account.
2277.76s: And you know, they were getting older and we knew we were paying. I was like, so you willingly
2282.40s: paid $25,000 extra dollars for five years. Knowing it was a bad decision because you felt bad.
2289.60s: Don't feel bad. Like, yeah, information, but you want to find somebody that you can gel with.
2294.64s: If you want to be shamed, find a CPA that will shame you. I know a few of them.
2299.60s: But there's a lot of folks out there like me that are actually trying to help people and actually
2303.84s: care and really want to keep like we don't just do a return and go, there's your taxes, you owe money.
2308.80s: No, we're going to go wait a minute. You sure there's not this. We'll do a tax return five or
2312.72s: six times. Go wait, wait, wait, wait, one more thing. Let me think about this. You sure? And oh,
2317.12s: sure enough, there's another piece of the pie that just brought it down. And so we tend to,
2322.48s: you know, I tend to review tax returns four or five or six times and I sleep on it. A lot of
2325.84s: stuff happens while I'm sleeping. I wake up and I'm like, oh my god, there's a passable
2329.28s: off carryover I forgot about or they have this other business. And I don't just do it one and
2334.32s: done who cares. It's just it's the Smith return. I'm looking at each one of these thinking about how
2340.16s: if it were my tax return, am I doing the best. And so I want somebody that I know is going to advocate
2345.36s: for me. I want to know somebody that knows how to deal with real estate. I want to know that
2349.04s: somebody that's familiar with pension plans. If I'm a, if I'm a corporation and I'm trying to
2354.48s: side, if I want a 401k or a defined benefit plan, I want somebody that understands those things.
2360.48s: I want somebody that knows that if I started DB plan and I ended on 1230 in the first year,
2365.04s: I can get a double dip because I have a mismatched year that a lot of people will come to me and go,
2370.24s: you can't do that. I'm like, check with your manager. You can do it. And they're like, oh my god,
2374.16s: I didn't know that. You should know that, right? So you want people that are constantly trying to
2380.56s: learn stuff. I don't, there's so much out there. I don't know everything. I have a lot of experience.
2386.32s: I know a few things and I'm going to keep asking. So I don't go in with the assumption of like,
2390.72s: I've got it all dialed in. I want to keep doing the best I can for people. I want to keep learning.
2395.84s: So I think there's so much value in that approach too because it's exactly as you say it and
2401.44s: especially as tax evolves and whatnot, it would be very difficult to be omnipotent perpetually.
2407.36s: But I think, you know, you have the again, like the exact mindset I would be looking for, which is,
2413.12s: I know what questions to ask to get to the answer we need. And I think that that's tremendously
2419.76s: valuable for for any of your clients. So I know that we're coming up on time here. There's a couple,
2425.36s: couple lingering items I had for you. Yeah. The first one is you mentioned money self sabotage
2432.00s: earlier, which was a very interesting terminology. I've heard of it before, but I'm generally unfamiliar
2438.00s: with that. I would love to know a little bit more about that concept and what you see as it pertains
2443.04s: to it. Yeah. So surprisingly, or maybe not, there are a lot of people out there that will say,
2449.20s: I'm going to start a business. But unconsciously, they'll say to themselves, I know it won't happen
2455.04s: for me. I am the one person that it's not going to happen for. Right. And so they'll still go in
2461.36s: and start the business and they'll do things to sabotage to be right about the fact that they're
2466.00s: going to be the one person that can't make it work. I had a client who, fortunately, was very willing
2472.48s: to talk, but every five years her business would go into the, just it would just go into the gutter.
2478.40s: And you know, she'd be making a million dollars, a million dollars, almost bankrupt.
2483.28s: This happens, and she was client for like 20 years. And so this happened three times. And I said,
2489.36s: let me ask you, can we just talk a little bit? I just, like, let's forget about the taxes, but let's
2494.24s: just walk me through what's going on. Like you had this amazing year, you had this amazing year,
2498.64s: then all of a sudden this happens. And then what happens? And so we started talking it out. And she
2504.08s: realized that when she loses all of her money, her mom comes in and saves her. And her mom really
2512.08s: loves to come in and show her that she's her savior, savior. And that's how she knows her mom loves her.
2518.24s: And so I said, ah, that's a really long way to get an I love you.
2524.56s: And then once she realized that she went, oh my god. Yeah, I could just ask my mom, hey,
2529.68s: do you still love me? Right? I don't need to run the business into the ground to see if she'll come
2534.80s: to my rescue. But that was an old story was mom will rescue me. And that's how I know she loves me.
2540.08s: Once we got real clear on that, she was able to then say, okay, now I'm aware of what I'm doing.
2545.76s: But when she was started to get depressed, nobody loves me, my life sucks. She would just slowly
2550.72s: start self sabotaging the business. So she could get to a place of mom's going to save me. I had
2557.12s: another client. And this happens a lot. Why? At a client that had their own business, it was failing.
2562.64s: They were given an opportunity to go run a division of a company and make $250,000.
2569.60s: 8 weeks of vacation, all kinds of benefits. And I said to them, look, your business is not working.
2575.84s: People aren't paying you. You don't enjoy that. You love doing what you do.
2580.16s: Right. You should take this job, close down your company. The lease is coming up. This is the
2584.16s: perfect time to walk away and transition and really make bank. He said, my mom will be so disappointed.
2591.12s: I can't, I can't do this proactively. So in essence, he made a choice to let it.
2598.48s: Yeah. He just, and so he let the business fail, but it wasn't his fault. He didn't walk away.
2606.16s: Of course. But how do you just walk the way? Okay, mom's upset a little bit. If you just said,
2611.44s: hey, mom, these are the choices. This is actually advocating for myself. And so rather than do what
2617.68s: makes the most sense, people will stick with, well, I made a promise or this person will be disappointed.
2624.56s: Or, and so that's the self sabotages where I know better, but I'm not going to do it because it
2632.24s: doesn't align with my story. That seems so counterintuitive to me. You know, I typically would assume
2638.88s: business owners, super pragmatic would, you know, perceive the problem for what it is and solve for
2644.32s: the problem. But obviously you see this very like in-depth emotional side to this stuff. I wouldn't
2652.80s: have guessed either of those stories. Like I just, yeah, like to me, it seems like if I see a business
2657.76s: that's failing, I would think, okay, how do I maximize whatever I can out of this and then,
2662.40s: move on in the next? That's what I'm trying to do. But I'll share my own personal self sabotage.
2669.92s: So I've just sit for the CPA exam and you have to get a 70, 75 or 76 to pass.
2677.04s: Yeah. That's all you need. That's all you need. We're almost, we're almost just like the Marine Corps.
2683.12s: Not kidding. But I would go in and I'm like, man, if I can just get 75%. So I would get 75%
2690.08s: of 75%. I wouldn't pass. And so I took this course that everybody said, if you take this course,
2696.24s: it will take you over the line. This is what you need. And the first night, the instructor said,
2703.60s: listen, I'm here to help all of you pass the CPA exam. But if you right now in your heart know that
2709.28s: you can't pass the CPA exam or that you won't, you should get your money back because I guarantee you,
2715.12s: you will make yourself right. And I said to myself, I know I'm not going to pass the CPA exam,
2720.88s: but I hope this course will be what it takes to get me through it. And I didn't pass. It wasn't
2726.48s: until I decided that I could pass it, that I passed it. And it was frustrating because people would
2732.32s: assume I was a CPA before I was. And they're like, but someone says the CPA and you're smarter than him.
2737.04s: And I'm like, yeah, I'm a bad test taker. Right. I had to find all these stories as to why I didn't do
2741.20s: it. But the truth was I had a belief that deep down, I wasn't sure I could really be a CPA. And
2748.88s: and so I just kept letting that narrative dictate until I was ready to go, that's not serving me.
2754.64s: And it's BS. Right. I, I cannot tell you how much I identify with you because for the longest time,
2762.64s: I would always say to myself, I'm not good at math. And I used to say that to myself all the time.
2767.28s: And guess what? I wasn't bad, but I wasn't good. Right. And I randomly just decided to stop
2773.44s: allowing myself to say that. And then suddenly during my undergrad and grad, I took a bunch of
2779.12s: statistics courses and it was off to the races. I still am not a savant at math, but I'm competent.
2785.76s: And yeah, I love that you are even willing to share that kind of story because I think that a
2792.08s: lot of people exhibit again, both of us, right? We exhibit that exact behavior and it's probably
2797.68s: pretty prevalent. So I think that's a, that's a really powerful message. So we are wrapping up here.
2804.96s: The last question I wanted to ask you before we get into how people can get a hold of you and
2809.84s: things like that is what keeps you doing what you do as a CPA? Like why do you choose to continue
2817.92s: to run your business? Why don't you just go be a full-time comedian? Go do something
2821.76s: else. What keeps you there? You know, well, a couple things. It's always been there for me when
2828.32s: everything else wasn't and it's something that I'm good at. And so that's been something that
2832.64s: just gives me comfort. But the reality is I love people. I like being with people. I like
2837.36s: connecting with people. And for me, it's a way that I can help people in an industry where not
2842.56s: everybody is willing to help. And I think most of my clients get that I'm advocating for them and
2848.88s: that I actually really care about them as a person. I actually care more about making sure they
2853.68s: feel good about what we've done than me making an extra 300 bucks. I'd rather lose 500 bucks or
2860.32s: wave the fee on a tax return than feel like I've given up my integrity. And I think people
2866.00s: hopefully resonate with that. But you know, I like helping people. And this is something that I'm
2870.64s: good at. And it's something that just even when I worked for other CPA firms, you know, I would help
2876.48s: do things. And of course, my bosses would go take credit for my stuff. I'm like,
2879.92s: oh, that's sort of not nice. But but at the end of the day, I knew that I had a I had a knack
2886.00s: for this stuff and that, you know, I love it. It's somewhere I can feel like I shine.
2892.40s: That's it's awesome. I had a sneaky suspicion that was going to be something in line with your
2897.36s: answer because I could tell, you know, that even the information you've really shared here
2902.16s: is impactful. And that like wanting to help people really, I think is so awesome. I love that
2908.16s: about you. So speaking of helping people, if somebody needs your help, how can they get a hold of
2912.56s: you? The best way to get a hold of me is our website, the Money Nerve, which also has my CPA firm.
2918.40s: It's got my workshops. It's got all kinds of free resources, the money nerve.com. And then info
2924.40s: at the Money Nerve is the best way to reach me. And again, I've got a CPA firm, but that information's
2930.96s: on the website. It's just easier to have it all in one place. And we can help people with their
2936.32s: with their taxes. We do a lot of international. We do multi-state. Small business corporations
2942.40s: is our is our sort of niche. And but I also do other things, workshops, work with people one on one
2948.80s: on their money, mindsets and financial coaching, slash therapy. Anything about money? Let's talk about
2954.40s: money and let's try and take those emotions out. Bob, you're absolutely awesome. Thank you so much
