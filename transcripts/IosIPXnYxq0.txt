0.00s: What's up everybody, Eric here? I am back again with David Hunter, like I was just saying,
6.60s: this is actually the fifth time I'm connecting with him. We've set up this really cool quarterly
10.60s: cadence. And I was actually explaining to him just like it is on the last video. It's
15.40s: really cool to kind of get a download of what you're seeing right now, get an idea of
19.64s: how different up and coming have impacted what you're seeing and your projections. So
25.40s: there's a lot to talk about. Obviously, as per usual, I mean, I started a YouTube channel
29.36s: like the perfect time because there's no shortage of drama almost every single time I
33.60s: connected to you. So before that, though, as always, welcome back. Thank you for joining us.
37.92s: Yeah, thanks Eric. Thanks for having me back. Yeah, I'm looking forward. There's a handful
42.88s: of things that I'm really excited to talk about. I want to talk a little bit about 2022.
47.44s: Then I obviously want to talk about 2023 and looking forward from there. But to kick us off
52.80s: keeping it in a general logical order, looking back at 2022, what were some of the major economic
60.64s: themes that stood out to you? Yeah, for sure. The Fed was a dominant story. And before that,
68.56s: Ukraine, I think we came into the 2022. I had expected a correction and then a quick return
76.56s: to new highs, maybe spend a quarter in correction and then go. But then Ukraine hit and
84.40s: changed the whole landscape, it drove oil through the roof and it caused inflation to spike.
91.92s: From there, as we say, the Fed took over. So those were probably the dominant things.
100.48s: And we're still dealing with both, obviously coming into this year. The difference is the Fed,
108.08s: the Fed hike aggressively faster than we've ever seen them hike. The rate increases that we saw
114.80s: both from the Fed and in the bond market were the fastest on record. And it's not so much the
122.72s: level of rates, but the speed of that hike or the speed of that rise in rates that really has hit
129.68s: the economy. And as I think when I hit it very hard as we move through this year. So it's easy to
136.48s: get caught in historic numbers and say, the interest rates are 4.5% big deal. When we've been at
147.36s: double digits, we've been at 7 or 8%, we've been a lot higher than this even not that many years ago.
155.04s: But it's that rapid rise from almost 0% rates to where we're heading for 5%.
162.16s: And I just don't think the Fed grasps how dramatic an impact that's going to have on the economy.
168.72s: And I don't think they really understand
171.20s: that it's going to get there. It just doesn't get there all at once. So if you're looking at that and
178.72s: saying, well, we're not seeing the damage, we don't think it's so bad. I think they're going to be
183.36s: very surprised that all of a sudden they're going to see the damage. It's too late.
188.72s: It's interesting that you talk about seeing the damage. The recent PPI figures came out and they were
194.40s: significantly lower than what most people were projecting something to the tune of like 1.2%
200.48s: below the recent forecast. Do you think that that's part of that coming to fruition where we've
206.72s: had this really aggressive cycle? And now we're starting to get to the back end where it's almost
211.68s: like the inverse where some of these metrics are just contracting so fast. And is that what's
216.80s: happening here? Or are you seeing something different? No, it is what's happening. I mean, we are,
222.96s: even since last summer, I've been talking about inflation coming down a faster than
228.16s: and coming down a sharper than the Fed understands or than a lot of people understand.
233.12s: Yeah, we were seeing, I mean, look, look what gasoline prices have done. Look what oil prices have
237.92s: done. It took a while to get there. I was beat up because I was calling for oil to fall back
245.12s: into the 80s and then lower than that. And oil was still up in the hundreds and they're going,
251.76s: you're looking the wrong direction. It finally, when it happened, it happened pretty quickly,
256.88s: but it took a while. I think you'll see the same thing in jobs and a lot of other parts of the
263.60s: economy is, yeah, it takes a while for Fed policy to work through the system and have its impact
271.60s: when you're financials. When you look at, we're just starting to see the credit deterioration
277.84s: in the banks. That's going to hit hard, I think, by the second half of this year. And, you know,
285.76s: again, the Fed's kind of looking at it months to months and saying, we're seeing deterioration,
289.92s: but it's not anything alarming and we're not worried about it yet. The problem is, but, you know,
295.52s: policy works with such a long lag that by managing policy that way, you're guaranteed. You're
303.68s: going to be way late. So, yeah, I mean, PPI did not surprise me, nor did CPI. I mean, I think we're
311.28s: at that point where you're finally going to have year-over-year numbers, you know, because
316.40s: the numbers a year ago were high. As those high numbers drop off, it's getting lower. Plus,
323.20s: if you look at, you know, I follow, obviously, commodity futures a lot. Look at what you're seeing
328.32s: as I said, gasoline, but look what you see in lumber prices. You know, it was 1700, a year and
334.08s: a half ago. And, you know, now it's down to 350 or whatever, 400. So, you know, those are huge
343.20s: drops. And we're seeing that we saw it in copper. We saw it in steel prices will come down hard.
348.96s: So, there's a lot of and a lot of metal prices will come down hard. So, there's a lot of things that
354.96s: you could tell that we were just, you know, you had to get that point where it really impacted
360.64s: the indexes. And I think it's just starting. So, so the news going forward and people keep wondering
367.68s: how you can be bullish with all the negative news, particularly the economy getting weaker as I
371.76s: expect. The thing is that you can probably assume going forward, not every month, baby, but going
380.48s: forward, you're going to have easier inflation numbers. So, that means if fed somewhere in here,
384.80s: you're going to wake up and say, I guess we did do our job or I guess it has impacted.
390.80s: But the problem is, at the same time, that's happening. The economy is getting impacted. And by
395.92s: the time they finally figure out the inflation has been beaten, they've already done tremendous
402.56s: damage to the economy. Leads me to a follow-on question. This is more of a personal one. I've noticed
408.16s: it with a handful of economic releases over the past two weeks or so, where the forecasts are
414.32s: whatever they are. And then the actuals have a pretty significant variance. This is everything from
420.56s: existing home sales, PPI, CPI, unemployment. Like there's been a bunch of them so far. I want to
426.96s: understand beyond the superficial, you know, yeah, okay, the Fed or the different entities that are
433.28s: tracking these metrics, they're just guessing in their way off. Like, why are we so far off on these
439.28s: estimates versus actuals? I assume there's got to be more to it than just there were
444.56s: thrown in some numbers in and it's just way off. I just don't understand it.
448.40s: And it's not bad at all. I mean, in fact, I don't try to forecast month to month.
454.96s: But the economists do, they're pretty good. They have a pretty good handle on putting the indexes
462.08s: together and breaking apart and figuring out the various components. The problem is,
468.00s: you're getting to a point where you're, you know, I call it an inflection point, but you're at a
472.16s: point where things are starting to break down. So if you're kind of extrapolating or basing it on,
478.32s: you know, the gradual change that you're expecting, also, you know, things happen slowly until they don't.
486.56s: And then all of a sudden, things break in the other direction. So I think it's just that we're coming
492.72s: to an inflection point not to mention also the jobs. I mean, you saw all of a sudden they had
501.76s: they worked on the jobs in the year over year. Number was way off. I mean, they had, you know,
508.64s: what they had reported over the past year was off by a lot. And some of its seasonal adjustment
515.20s: factors, you know, that stuff is, I just don't pay attention to monthly numbers like that,
521.12s: particularly not jobs because you do see these, you know, all of a sudden, once a year or whatever they
529.28s: they find this big error and they adjust it. So, you know, the fence actually managing policy
537.12s: by monthly numbers, basically, you know, looking at data monthly, when that data we know,
542.72s: all of a sudden, either can all of a sudden change, or you're going to find that data you're
548.32s: relying on, needed to be, you know, was recalculated and found out it was way off. So,
555.60s: from reality. So I'm not a big fan of managing monetary policy on a month to month databases,
563.12s: but that's, you know, when they say they're dead at the pendant, that's what they mean.
568.16s: So I'm, you know, much more focused as a strategist on trends, and knowing full well that I'm
575.28s: timing wise is going to take time, and I'm not going to be able precisely know, but, you know,
582.08s: that's, to me, trends are far more important than months and months data.
587.12s: Which leads me, that helps a lot. That was actually my guess, was that essentially there was some sort
591.60s: of typical scaling factor they were using, and then there's an acceleration essentially that
595.84s: occurs at some point that they kind of get caught with. So it's, it seems kind of in line with my
601.12s: general, my general guess. Another personal question that I have for you, I've talked to a handful
609.28s: of friends and whatnot. There's economists from all different walks of life, essentially.
614.56s: There's an interesting theme I noticed. Most of them don't actively trade. Some of them invest,
621.36s: but most of them seem to not actively trade. This could just be my small sample, but
626.56s: is there, why is that? Like, why am I even seeing that small sample trend?
631.60s: You're talking about economists generally or yeah. I think, you know, again, economists are
640.64s: understand that month to month is highly unpredictable. You know, they try to predict it, but
647.84s: they're, they also know themselves that, you know, they're not going to hit it right all the time.
653.28s: And I think so they're, they carry that over to the market where they think they're shorter,
658.00s: the horizon, the less predictability. That's my view. Unfortunately, retail investors come in and
665.28s: lots of official traders as well, thinking the most predictable is the shorter time frame.
671.04s: I'm quite the opposite, you know, that could be a longer time frame and I could tell you what
674.88s: I think is going to happen. I think it's because economists and strategists are looking at
681.12s: bigger picture. You know, it's, again, you know, that old saying about you can't see the forest for
685.92s: the trees. You know, the retail trade or the retail investors focused on the trees, the economists
691.84s: and the strategists focused on the, you know, the forest. Makes total sense. And again, my hypothesis
698.64s: where there was that you have to have a certain part of you that's at least partially unhinged
705.12s: to actively trade because of exactly that. Like, when we look at just markets in general,
710.72s: I can quantitatively display to you positive drift over five, 10, 15, 20 years. I can't show you
718.16s: that on short time frames, other than sometimes post earnings. But that's exactly what I was expecting.
722.88s: It's just that it's almost like they know better and they kind of wait their, their effort more
728.48s: efficiently than that. But yeah, I was just curious. Obviously, you're in that same group and you know
733.28s: far more of them than I do. But yeah, to be fair to good traders because there are good traders out
738.96s: there. You know, they can, they're, their methods are focused on short term and they can think of
745.20s: things that have some predictability and, you know, you're playing probabilities with all of this
749.84s: anyway. So it's not to say that some people can't be successful at trading. There are certainly
755.04s: very successful traders. It's that the majority of retail investors have come in with almost a
762.48s: gambling mentality that they think they can kind of try to predict what's going to happen
768.88s: in the next week or month or a few days or whatever. And the odds are they're not even understanding
775.04s: the relationships, you know, the, the leads and lags, the, the diskind nature of markets and the fact
781.20s: that what they're focused on, they may be judging it based on news. And that news may have been
787.52s: discounted a while ago. So there, that's why I think oftentimes investors are confused when they say,
794.24s: well, we got exactly what we're looking for in the market went down. How come? You know,
798.96s: well, it's because it's, you know, it's less times it's by the rumor cell the fact, you know, it's
803.44s: so there's a lot of that too that goes into investing. It's understanding that markets are
808.56s: discounting something in the future. You know, markets can be discounting six to nine months out.
814.16s: That doesn't bring they are adjusting along the way. But, you know, thinking that today's news is
821.12s: today's market, I think is a big mistake. So really, really good point. It's actually something I
826.16s: talk out against a lot because I see people do that with earnings a lot. So obviously, I'm a
831.04s: derivatives trade. I trade a lot of options. And people will say, oh, they, they missed earnings.
835.92s: Why did it rally? Yep. And it's, you know, that exact force you're talking about.
841.36s: Another question I wanted to dive into with you because from a militaristic standpoint, I have a
847.04s: general concept of, you know, essentially Russian, Vating Ukraine and the implications. And I also had
853.28s: a bear idea of the economic implications at the time of with natural gas wheat, things like that.
859.12s: Now that this is like still going on, it's a pretty prolonged engagement. Are there any like
865.20s: longer term implications of this that me focusing on the trees I'm missing from the forest?
872.32s: I'm sorry. I'm primarily curious about Russia invading Ukraine. When it first happened,
881.04s: I was able to come up with a couple themes. I understand the natural gas aspect of things,
885.92s: the food aspect, those kinds of stuff, especially coming into the winter. But I'm wondering since
890.32s: this has been a pretty prolonged engagement, the market in my opinion probably is synthesized a lot
895.44s: of the implications of this. But I'm really curious about the longer term implications of Russia
902.24s: invading Ukraine from an economic standpoint. Yeah, it's a lot of it was just kind of early on.
908.16s: Obviously oil very quickly ran there and then, you know, it's been heading south since.
914.80s: You know, wheat and corn, if you look, the biggest, the bulk of the spike happened very quickly.
923.76s: And so I think what happens is you have an emotional response to it initially. Some of it based on
930.72s: reality, but it's emotional. And then you settle down and you realize that these markets are
939.28s: global markets. The oil is fungible. It can find its way even though the oil may not go from
948.24s: Russia or the natural gas from Russia to Germany anymore. It's still out there and it may go to
956.24s: so let's say it goes to India or China. That means they may not need some of the oil they were
966.48s: buying from other sources. So that goes somewhere else. So, you know, these are global markets and
971.60s: that the other resources, it's a global demand story as well. So some of it is that that's often some
978.96s: you know, what would otherwise be operations or, or, you know, authorations to what the normal
986.80s: landscape is. And some of it is, I think we just don't know. I mean, you can discount things
995.52s: based on probabilities to some extent, but as this drags on, you know, I get people constantly saying,
1002.24s: well, how does, you know, what if Ukraine does this or what if Russia does this?
1007.44s: This happens, what does that do to your forecast? And I generally don't answer because it's like
1011.84s: I can't forecast that. I'm not going to play hypotheticals that I can't forecast. I can get,
1017.36s: you know, the minute I say that, then you're going to say, okay, so you're, you know, you change in
1022.40s: your forecast. No, you know, wars tough to know what, you know, you can't predict what,
1029.76s: and particularly with, with Boop, and you can't predict how long it's going to go on or,
1033.84s: or those kind of things. What I can do is look at the markets and see the impact that's had so far
1040.72s: and say unless something dramatic changes, yeah, I think that's already discounted.
1046.88s: That makes a ton of sense. And on that same thread, is that why we're seeing natural, I'm,
1053.84s: I personally am surprised that natural gas has contracted as much as it has in price. It's gone
1058.00s: from like ten and change towards the end of last year. Now it's down at like three.
1064.40s: Is it because of those alternate sources, essentially, are finding their way into the global market?
1069.28s: It's some of that. Obviously, you know, the storage was done ahead of time. So all the doom and gloom
1077.44s: is really, you know, we knew they had filled their storage tanks that, you know, Germany and
1084.96s: Europe were pretty well prepared for this one or what, what happens going forward is a bigger question.
1090.64s: Mark, but it's, it is some of that, you know, the markets are vulnerable. It's also, I think,
1099.44s: and at least it feeds into my view that, you know, there's a lot more damage being done by the
1106.56s: central banks underneath the surface and it's going to, it's impacting demand, you know, two,
1113.76s: two things impact the main one. One price has run up. People, people start using less of something.
1121.92s: You know, so when gasoline prices went to five dollars, you know, driving became somewhat,
1128.64s: you know, people were more careful with their driving. They weren't planning as long trips, etc.
1134.56s: And, and the other thing that impacts it is the economy and if the feds overstaying,
1140.00s: it's welcome on the tight side, the economy's getting weaker and, and I think is that's, you know,
1145.60s: you know, I'm called for a global bust later this year. It's not that we're going to be fine until
1151.20s: we get there. We're going to be in recession and then recession goes into global bust. I think
1155.76s: that's true of the world. You know, the world's demand for these items is being impacted by central
1162.96s: banks who are focused on yesterday's problem. Yesterday's problem was inflation. I think tomorrow's
1169.36s: problem is deflation and they haven't recognized it yet.
1174.24s: Got it. And that actually touches kind of neatly on the next topic. The last few times we were
1181.76s: talking, the general sentiment you were sharing was kind of this parabolic rise into a, you know,
1188.64s: 80% plus global bust. And over the different times we've spoken, there's been different catalysts
1195.92s: that have intervened and essentially just your analysis of that. So it sounds like that's still
1201.20s: generally your forecast here. Is that right? And if so, can you just walk me through what you're seeing?
1207.12s: Sure. Yeah. My view has not changed at all. I think we saw the end of the bear market on October
1213.52s: 13th when, you know, the, you see, if I came out, the market went down below 3500 in the first hour
1221.68s: and reverse quickly. And we haven't looked back since we, you know, we haven't seen 3500 since then.
1229.04s: We, we ran up to 4000. We're right around that 200 day moving average and it backed off
1236.72s: to we all before before that's again, in December, we backed off to 3,800. And then in January,
1247.04s: we've run back up to that 4000 area and backed off to 3,900. I suspect we are ready to break through
1255.20s: the 200 day moving average probably next week. I mean, we've probably, you know, we've broken
1260.56s: a little bit before we backed off. But I think the size of the graphic through it next week.
1266.24s: And probably see 4,300 pretty quickly. And not that long after that 4,600. That's kind of where I
1273.60s: am in terms of the more, you know, near term intermediate term. I don't pretend to put as much
1280.32s: faith in my short term stuff. But I do think we're probably ready to ramp up here. And that's
1286.88s: kind of ironic in that everybody's thinking we're on the verge of a meltdown. You know, that we're
1292.88s: we're going to see 3000 very quickly. Not not see you move up. So I think if we, if we do see what
1300.00s: I'm expecting here, it's going to cause a lot of because there's there's a large majority of
1308.24s: both market analysts and investors that are expecting down, not up. And thinking that we're,
1314.08s: you know, we're this bear market rally is almost over. And I'm saying, no, this is the beginning
1319.92s: of the next bull leg. And that we will push through here. And once we push through that 200 day with a
1326.64s: umph, a decisiveness, it will cause at least some of those bears to begin rethinking and saying,
1335.52s: hmm, and I'm not so sure this is the bear market rally anymore. Many will stay to a bear market rally,
1340.72s: but have higher targets, you know, say, okay, well, it's going a little higher, but you know, it's not
1346.00s: it's not off to the races. But ultimately, I think that's what we're going to see is you can have
1350.96s: shorts having to cover. You're going to have people who allocated to bonds having to reallocate
1356.88s: equities. And I think that's what, you know, the first quarter and probably the first half of this
1362.56s: year is going to be about is, you know, we spent much of 2022 with people reallocating away from
1370.40s: equities, uh, becoming, you know, as they became more and more bearish. And in a fairly concentrated few
1377.12s: months, I think a lot of that allocation, that reallocation that happened over say nine months
1384.00s: um, could, could be reversed in the state three months. And that's why I can talk about such a big
1390.40s: move, as I think we're going to have a very illic with rally, um, or, or bull leg, if you will,
1397.84s: because I think it happens in a more concentrated period of time. You know, the down happened over
1402.72s: nine months. The up happens over let's say three or four or five months.
1409.12s: So it sounds like there's a couple primary catalysts that would drive this move for you. It seems
1414.16s: like some of it is the inflation data continuing to show some cooling, which might put some wind in
1419.92s: the market sales. It sounds like you were talking about, um, shifting of broader institutional capital
1425.44s: from risk off into more risk on trying to catch the move. And is, or those are main catalysts
1432.48s: that you're seeing that we drive kind of the move from like four thousand say forty six.
1437.68s: Well, those are the mechanical catalysts, I guess, you know, the it's, um,
1442.64s: position it, repositioning, um, and flow of funds is obviously going to be important to any
1448.96s: any market rally. Um, but the catalyst might be a week dollar, you know, the dollar breaking down
1455.44s: further. Um, the catalyst will be, you know, the 10 year going from, you know, three forty to say
1463.12s: two fifty in the next few months, uh, as, as the weakness in the economy becomes better known.
1469.92s: And probably the biggest catalyst is going to be it's, it's why I've kind of, um, not been worried about
1477.44s: what everybody else is worried about is work, no matter what you think in terms of how many more
1484.00s: hikes there are or whatever, the bulk of the feds tightening is behind us not ahead of us.
1490.24s: And, you know, we can, we can argue over how many more hikes are going to be whether it's two more
1496.00s: quarter point hikes or whatever, they can't ignore this weakness in the economy for much longer.
1502.56s: You know, what we saw in industrial production this, this week, what we've seen in the ISM reports,
1507.52s: what we've seen in the consumer, you know, it just, they cannot just continue to say, oh, our whole
1514.64s: focus is on, um, jobs, uh, we don't believe inflation to be in yet. And we think the stock market has
1523.28s: to go to three thousand before we can ease. I mean, those are ridiculous statements of ridiculous
1528.88s: ways to approach policy. And I don't think they're going to be able to ignore the weakness for
1534.40s: that much longer. So whether we get a quarter point hike in February and another quarter point
1540.00s: March, whether we get a half point and a quarter point, I don't really care. I've said for several
1546.88s: months now, the bond markets are going to lead the fed and the bond market's already telling you
1552.72s: that the fed's gone too far and it's time to ease. So that's exactly that because I, I follow
1558.96s: the bond market's pretty closely and it looks like already the latter half of this year, they're
1563.28s: looking to price in essentially lower rates. So what's the defunct there? Why are those two so decoupled?
1570.64s: Well, this is always true. I mean, that's why I don't like the fed targeting the stock market. And
1577.60s: that's essentially what they're doing is saying we're going to, we have, we have an opinion on where
1583.04s: the stock market should be and we aren't going to stop tightening until we get it there. So every time
1589.84s: the market lifts its head, I'll get to your question in a second, but every time the market lifts its head,
1595.76s: outcomes, some of the F.O. MC members or some of the, you know, Powell's minions,
1602.48s: calling for, you know, more hawk, you know, they talk very hawkishly and calling for more hikes and
1608.96s: saying we're not anywhere near done. It's so transparent. They're trying to scare the market the way
1614.00s: they talk. They're, they don't, you know, I call them captain obvious. I mean, it's very,
1618.96s: very clear what they're trying to do. They're trying to job on the market down because they've bought
1624.32s: into Bill Dudley's thesis that, you know, we aren't going to be inflation unless we really tighten
1631.68s: financial conditions and tightening financial conditions can't happen without the market being
1637.76s: much lower. So that's their, that's their focus. Unfortunately, I think that's their biggest focus.
1645.28s: And then along with that, it's so well, we aren't going to stop tightening until we see the jobs
1650.24s: really break. That's a heck of a, you know, poor way to manage policy in my opinion, but that's what
1656.24s: they're doing. And, and markets lead. The reason I hate so much that they are focused on the market
1664.48s: is the market is a lot as a, as a predictor. They don't know, and the market is always
1669.12s: that right. But in the aggregate, the market is a much better predictor of the future than
1674.64s: is any economist than is the Fed. And, and, this bond market as well. So stock and bond markets.
1682.48s: I've said, really, since early in 2022, in January 2022, I was making statements about
1689.92s: the bond market will lead and the Fed will follow. And that's exactly what we're seeing. So,
1696.40s: so the 10 year got up to 430 and changed 435 or whatever it was. And is now, you know, down at 340
1705.28s: and was down at 335. So 100 base points lower. And the Fed's still talking about higher, higher rates.
1713.04s: Well, I'll trust the bond market much more than I trust stock market. I much more than I trust
1718.80s: Fed because in the aggregate, the bond market has a, a history of seeing the future. And, as I've said,
1726.56s: it discounts the future. So, you know, I don't, Fed has a lousy tracker, not just this FOMC,
1733.92s: this current makeup, but FOMC's and, and Fed's forever have had a lousy record when it comes to
1742.08s: predicting the economy and when to stop tightening and when, you know, when to stop easing.
1748.56s: Fed's not very good at that because, again, they're backward looking. They're focused on data that
1753.12s: is by definition looking backwards, telling you what's already happened, now what's going to happen.
1759.20s: Markets are forward looking and not, not any one person, not any, you know, 10 pundits,
1766.24s: but in the aggregate, the market will have large numbers. It's a discounting mechanism and it
1772.88s: is discounting has a good tracker curve of seeing the future better than, than any forecaster. So,
1780.96s: so right now you are, if you were looking at the bond market, you would say the bond market is telling
1786.24s: you inflation's been conquered, or at least to a large extent, and that, you know, the economy's
1794.56s: weakening. And that's exactly what I think. So, meanwhile, the Fed is saying inflation has not
1801.92s: been conquered and we think we're, we're engineering us off landing. I mean, who, who do you trust?
1807.68s: I trust the bond market and, you know, stock market's a little different story, but the bond market
1814.96s: basically is telling you that. Yeah, and I think that that's really my, my point of confusion is
1821.04s: exactly that is obviously the Fed can see that themselves. Is it, are they just trying, it seems
1827.44s: to me that in a lot of ways the Fed is trying to maintain their cadence. They've been supersteady
1833.04s: ever since they decided that this was the path they were going to take. It's been almost every
1838.24s: single Fed meeting the same story. Is it literally just that that they just don't want to change what
1843.20s: they're messaging until it's exactly time to change? Because to me, that's the part I don't
1848.64s: understand is the bond market is already showing us this. I know the Fed can see it, but they're still
1854.16s: messaging something that's so far away from that. That's like the decoupling that I just, I can't
1859.44s: understand. It's a number of things. First of all, they got burned, you know, Paul got burned by
1864.72s: being late to the game. He, you know, he thought inflation was transitory and he argued that
1872.08s: into this year and then got caught, you know, flat-flitted when it took off. So, and you know, there
1879.92s: are lots of people criticizing him for that. And, and it, you know, there was a lot of supply side
1886.00s: issues that were contributing to it. And then in Ukraine, it wasn't necessarily predictable. So,
1892.24s: you know, you got to give him a pass on some of that. But I think he took that criticism to heart.
1898.00s: And again, it's human nature. And now he's doing the exact opposite. He's saying, well, I don't
1902.56s: want to get caught in that place again. He doesn't realize the place he's going is going to be even more
1908.32s: criticism than, I think, more dire in terms of its its impact. But so it's partly that. It's partly
1917.84s: history does show the inflation. If you, if you back off from fighting it too soon, you can get caught
1928.00s: saying, I shouldn't have done that because, you know, it, yes, it came down, but then it
1933.04s: reversed quickly and now I've got an even harder job trying to reign it in again. So, you know,
1939.44s: some of his legitimate worry that if they, if they stop short, they're going to make their job
1947.36s: even tougher and, and, you know, and then don't forget, there's a cost to this. If inflation
1955.36s: isn't conquered and it does break out to higher highs, interest rates are going a lot higher.
1962.16s: And we have a government with, you know, massive debt that it could, it could afford maybe at
1971.12s: 2%, but it's going to have a hard time affording at five or six or seven or eight percent. I mean,
1977.84s: that's part of my story for later on in the decade, but, you know, they, they are, there are
1984.32s: legitimate reasons for them wanting to fight. My, my only contention right now is that I think they've
1991.20s: gone too far that, you know, their worries are the wrong worries right now. Like I said, I think,
1998.00s: you look at the inversion and the yield curve, you look at, you know, what's happening in some
2004.32s: of the commodity prices like lumber and you, if you know, leads and lags the way I do, you're seeing
2013.04s: all the evidence you need to see to say deflation is a risk, not inflation and they're just not there
2019.28s: yet. But I think the next few months, it's going to be hard for them not to be there. They probably
2026.40s: aren't going to be in the deflation camp, but they, they may get to the point where they say,
2032.40s: we at least have to pause because it looks like we've done some damage here. We have to pause and see
2036.96s: how much damage we've done or how, how slowly it kind of is getting. So, you know, people, again,
2043.28s: wanting to focus on pivot and I go, I'm not even, my, my aggressive stock market forecast is not
2050.32s: based on a pivot. They could or they may pivot more likely they pause. And that pause is going to be
2060.16s: a big, that's going to be received in a big way by the street, you know, if, because that was a
2067.28s: pause mean to the street, a pause means they finally woken up and understand that, you know, they
2075.84s: may have gone too far. They aren't ready to say they have gone too far, but they've at least,
2080.48s: and in the streets mind, it's going to be tightening over. Of course. And that's, you know, that's,
2085.28s: that's one bottomed in market's hapless. So, that's when you're going to see that,
2090.00s: instead of a stampede for the exits, it's going to be a buying stampede, you know, in bear market,
2096.40s: you get this, you know, somebody else fire in a crowd of theater and everybody's running through
2100.40s: the same exit. And that's why prices drop quickly. In this case, it's going to be the reverse of that,
2105.44s: where, right, if, if, if everybody, if, if the fed pauses, you can have on awful lot of people
2111.36s: who are on the bearer side reach the same conclusion at once, which is, gee, fed tightening may be over,
2117.12s: this is the time to buy. And then you'll see how to look with this market is.
2122.56s: I think from at least the trader's perspective, I could not agree with you more on that. Even the
2127.68s: last few fed meetings, they're already, the markets are ready saying, oh, this might be the pivot,
2131.92s: we might be pivoting. So I completely agree with you. As soon as they see anything, that looks even
2136.80s: close to that. It's going to be a broad capitulation. We're coming up on time. I just want to throw,
2141.92s: I just want to throw in a caveat because this is, you know, just from my life on Twitter, I know this,
2148.48s: that does not mean it's straight up to 6,000. Right. You know, you're going to have stair steps along
2155.12s: the way. You're going to have pullbacks along the way. But it does mean that all those people say,
2159.92s: oh, 4,000 is high as you're going and you're going back to 3,000 or 3,200 or whatever.
2165.76s: It means more likely, 4,000 is the beginning of something, take you like I said, the 4,346,
2172.08s: maybe new highs. And where I think the real takeoff point comes and you may pull back from there,
2177.68s: you know, for a while. But the real takeoff happens, I think. Once we make new highs in a decisive way,
2186.88s: that's where you get that parabolic meltup. So, you know, those that want to believe that I'm saying
2194.08s: from 4,000 to 6,000 is going to happen in 10 minutes or not. I don't know how that the shape of that
2200.80s: is going to be. It's going to be, it's going to be fast. And I think steep and faster than we've
2205.12s: seen in history, maybe. But that doesn't mean you can't have pullbacks along the way that last for,
2210.88s: you know, weeks at a time. So, um,
2214.40s: Anyway, yeah, it's, I think it's an important note. A lot of people, especially traders,
2220.32s: were known for our patients. So as soon as something does he immediately play out how we want,
2226.16s: then yeah. Um, so we're coming up on time, but your, your community always lights me on fire.
2234.16s: If we don't talk about precious metals, so I refuse to exit the conversation without asking
2240.16s: your view on precious metals, which is actually, you know, kind of purposely
2244.08s: place this way, one for just, but also because I've been trading gold quite a bit lately myself.
2249.04s: And it just love your thoughts on that because the last few times you had a really interesting
2253.28s: perspective on specifically gold, but yeah, what are your thoughts on precious metals as we sit now?
2258.88s: Yeah, I'm, I'm very bullish on the metals. I think they, you know, they've led this year.
2264.00s: I may not feel like at, uh, at times because they, you know, they were ran up and then they correct,
2269.60s: but um, we're seeing the both gold is, is up at levels that we haven't seen for a while.
2277.84s: And, and sovers, uh, you know, near 24. I think we are going to see a very strong next six months
2286.00s: in the metals and, um, me, I'm continuing to call for 50 to 60 and, and more likely 60 on silver
2294.40s: and 3000 on gold and that 3000 may or may not be aggressive enough, but that's where I'm at.
2301.04s: I mean, I, I think that may be good enough, but it's possible given the move that I see coming
2306.08s: in silver, gold could move even higher than that. So, um, I think we have a big move in the
2311.60s: metals coming, um, part of it's the dollar, part of its lower interest rates, part, you know,
2318.00s: a big part of that I think will be if you get, if you get the feeling the feds done tightening,
2324.72s: that's the most bullish thing you can tell the metals market. You know, it's wind at your back
2329.60s: instead of in your face. Um, and so I think that's all going to happen. The miners will be sympathetic
2336.72s: for all ears with that with some big moves miners typically, you know, in a bull market in the
2341.68s: metals, the miners will perform the metals. So, um, you know, you should have some pretty good moves in
2346.96s: the, in, you know, gold miners and the silver miners as well. And by the way, is not just
2353.20s: precious metals copper looks great here. Um, it's another reason why it's a little hard to be negative
2359.84s: on the market, because, you know, if we were, if we were heading into, you know, the real dumps,
2367.84s: copper would not be moving up like it is. So part of that is probably China reopening.
2373.68s: No question, but I think, you know, I've been calling for $6 copper and I was saying that last
2379.44s: year when it looked possible, copper was only going down, but I do think we're probably going to see
2385.92s: $6 copper. So, you know, that's another one that should do well. Even the steels look like they're
2391.76s: waking up. So there's a lot, and I'll tell you, look where the Dow is. Dow is not that far off of new highs.
2398.16s: You know, yes, and that's that goes a long way to go. That's P.S. a long way to go. Russell has a
2402.40s: long way to go. The Dow doesn't have that far to go to new highs. And it's, you know, to me,
2409.20s: industrials, commodities, all those things look like they're in play.
2415.44s: I think it's really enlightening, especially to see kind of this broad orchestra of bullish
2421.60s: movements. And as always, you do have some audacious targets, which are always fun to keep an eye on
2427.20s: and see how things play out. So first off, again, as always, absolute pleasure. Thank you for
2431.52s: spending some time, you know, sharing what you've learned over decades with us working people find
2437.68s: you. I'm sure. Yeah, they can find me at Twitter. I'm on their most days getting, you know,
2444.32s: giving it out as well as getting it. And it's my handles at Dave H. Conn Trarion. I want to just
2453.44s: reiterate there are some people, particularly right now that are out there using my name
2459.84s: with a different handle, making it look like it's maybe sometimes even pretending to sound like me,
2465.20s: but with some, you know, sarcasm in it or, you know, trying to start fights, making it look like
2470.96s: I'm trying to do that. So that's not my, that's not my M.O. Be very careful and look at the handle
2476.88s: to make sure it's me. Again, it's at Dave H. Conn Trarion. And so be aware there are fake accounts there
2485.68s: that are not me. And I also write a investment letter that comes out quarterly. I just had my
2494.16s: most recent one come out. And if people have any interest in that, it is a subscription,
2500.32s: newsletter. So there's a cost to it, but they can always direct message me on Twitter. And I'll
2506.72s: be glad to provide information on that. Awesome. Yeah, that sounds great. I'll throw the links,
2512.72s: you know, to your Twitter in the video description below. And again, thanks for hanging out. I'm sure
2516.72s: we'll catch up again in another quarter or so and see how everything's panning out. Yeah,
2520.80s: sounds great. They are a good weekend. Are you too? Thank you.
