 you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you history you you you you you I actual reality that you thought this was going to be for. It's kind of funny. Because when you first start trading the idea of, again, turning a small account into a large account really fast and easy, it's so far fetched. It's unbelievably unlikely to occur. However, there will be instances where it can happen. People do win the lottery. It's the same style concept. But that's not reliable. It's not something that you can count on. It's something that you might hope for. But that's not going to cut it. If you're thinking about what you're trying to do as a trader, it's much deeper than that. And if your way to get there is just hope, that's not a great way to go about this thing. So episode one was taking the very, very common initial ideas, hopes, desires, dreams that are funny enough, all of us have myself included coming into trading and essentially throwing them all out. And it's looking at the reality of this thing, taking it for what it is, which is a good thing, by the way, because there's a massive opportunity here, but it will only exist for those that can get over the initial hurdle of throwing away your naive hopes, dreams, goals, and instead digging into the details. That is exactly what this is. So if you can focus less on wanting to turn your account into a ton of money, if you can focus less on that in more unbuilding, a solid foundation, you will actually position yourself to be able to realize those hopes and dreams in a real sense as compared to just the aspirations of thinking of them. So that was episode one, episode two, we literally ran through an actual approach, how to do this thing. And this is kind of a fun conversation, I think, because it takes a lot of the common ways of thinking, the common questions that I know that I had, and we literally talk through all of them. So these are things like, how do you even start thinking about how to make money? We talked about that with examples. How do we think about managing risks at the trade and portfolio level? We talked about that with details and examples. How do we combine all of this into employing a portfolio? Chakr, we talked about that with examples. And you'll notice that a lot of this started from thinking through what you're trying to do and creating a plan, which is exactly what's the next part of that original second episode was about, which is literally giving you steps to follow, literally laying the framework, do follow this path, and it will get you much, much closer to where you're trying to go. Now, the funny thing with trading is you can do all the right things and still lose money. You can do a bunch of wrong things and still make money. But what will happen over your trading career is if you focus on a foundational process, your results will approximate towards your skill set. This is the quintessential concept of law of large numbers. And it's a really important concept to understand because essentially, when we're looking at markets, we know it's not normally distributed, pretend that that's a normal distribution. We know this isn't it. If we think of stock prices, we know that they're skew and kurtosis. We know that there's a higher probability. We'll see a little bit of a right skew, but fatter tails, like this. That's terrible drawing, but the point is that there's a higher probability of a smaller positive move and a lower probability of a negative move. But there's a much higher probability out at the tails of bigger moves. If all that doesn't mean anything to you, that's okay. Just listen, let the random words enter your brain in overtime, it will make sense. This is a this is a world of repetition. None of this shit made sense to me either. But this is the fact. So now if we take this concept and we apply it to your trading, let's take a look at a P&L plot. And let's say that this is a time series. So this is T0 and then this is TX, whatever point in the future we want to refer to. And here's your P&L. What will happen is this is your zero line for P&L. What will happen is over time you're going to start plotting trades. So your first trade, the worst thing that can happen is it's a nice big winner. And then your second trade is also a winner. Your third trade is a winner. Your fourth trade is a small loss. And then what will happen is this will fill in with tons and tons and tons of trades. Now the idea is if you are progressing as a trader, here's what will happen. In the beginning, if we just add a time hack here, let's just call it T1, it doesn't matter what Dora 1 month, 1 year, it doesn't matter, short term timeframe. Your performance plot might look something like this. If we drew a line of best fit, through this, it might be something like this. And you might see, AM, I'm crushing it, I'm doing really, really well. But then what will happen is let's say that first year just happened to be a stroke of luck. Let's say that you started selling puts into a decade long bullish cycle, for example, just throwing stuff out there. And you continue to trade. Well, what will end up happening is we don't just see what happens in this section here because your performance will carry over. But what you'll see happening is your P&L will start to do this. And you'll say, okay, I'm still doing well. I don't like that the P&L is declining, but maybe this is just one year more and so on and so forth. And if you're still not learning as a trader, what will happen is we add again, more and more patches into this time series. And literally what you will find is that your your line of best fit will literally negatively invert despite how successful you were in the beginning. If you keep doing this long enough, you will start to lose unless you can embrace exactly what I'm outlining here that you have to focus on the process. Yes, if this doesn't make sense to you, please tell me because it is absolutely worth taking the time to understand this concept. It's the same thing that if you looked at you get a lottery ticket, you buy one lottery ticket, you win 50 bucks and you say, well, they are. I made 50 bucks. What if I take this 50 bucks and then I go buy five $10 lottery tickets? You would have been better off taking this and going away because these will be losses. This one might be scratch. And then this one might be 10 bucks. And this is not a terrible outcome for this scenario, by the way, this is a really good probabilistic outcome. This typically wouldn't happen. And then you're like, oh, well, I get another ticket out of this one. So maybe I'll get this ticket. I'll reinvest this one. And now you get your two tickets. Well, what's going on here? The first thing is you started with one ticket. You walked out with 50 bucks. Then you got five tickets. Now you're back down to two tickets. You're going the wrong fucking way. And this is what will happen with lottery. It's the same thing with trading. If you do not pay enough attention to your development of your skill set is your money will fucking evaporate even if you're successful in a short term timeframe, unless you cash out and don't go back. So you have to figure out what's right for you. If you put on a super lucky trade and you're like, wow, I identified that I was super lucky. And I still want to learn how to trade. But I don't want to necessarily light on my money on fire. Take 95% of the money out. Keep five percent in and see what you can do to learn. Or do the logical thing and go to paper trading. I know nobody likes that because it's not fun. But guess what? It's a really great way to learn. Trading or option says that's what happened to me at the beginning. It is so common. I completely identify with you. It's what happens to a lot of us. I call it the illusion of path. And the illusion of path is you don't have this kind of context. You see your P&L curve going like this and you're like, wow, this is awesome. But again, if this was year one, this literally whatever the slope is of this, it doesn't matter. It literally doesn't matter. Because once you plot this out to be year 30, whatever happened here provided you didn't blow up is completely irrelevant. And whatever happened here probably doesn't matter. Meaning you're learning the core concepts. You're not at the point yet where you're actually building good infrastructure for what you're doing. You're just learning how markets work. So in the beginning, you just have to accept that that's really the bulk of what you're doing is just getting general understanding of things. And then it's off of that that you can eventually learn and grow, which is the cool part. And this is why if you emphasize the process, the rest of that learning curve will happen. It will happen. There's nothing that difficult about what we do as traders. There really isn't. It's one of those kinds of things where most of it's out there. The general stuff is what it is. And as long as you can pick it up, then you will be fine in the long run. But so many people get stuck in that first three year window because they can't get out of their own way because they have the wrong expectations and they haven't built an approach. So this is the second thing that we talked about that as you could tell is massively important to your success longer term as a trader. Okay, great. Next. We then talked about how to execute as a trader in a day to day lens. We talked about literally how to start with a top down analysis of the economy, the stock market to build context, to then literally how to build a portfolio. And we talked about how to size things, how to manage risk. We talked about all of these different concepts because this is where the rubber meets the road. This is where you actually build something and it's not haphazard. You're not building something that you're like, oh, I feel like this is going to go up or I feel like this is going to go down. That's nothing. That doesn't mean anything. That's a random opinion that nobody cares about, especially the market. However, if you learn to apply a general trading approach that's repeatable. Again, you get a lot of really valuable feedback. For example, if I have a trade log and I look back over my last 50 trades, let's say I'm trading directionally with long calls. I look back over the last 50 and I have a little note section in there because in the beginning that note section is really useful and you're dissecting your notes and you start to realize like, man, these mean reversion trades really are not working that great. Whenever I think something is overbought, somehow it keeps going or when something's oversold, somehow it keeps rolling down. I thought it was going to do the opposite. If you have good documentation and good approach for your entries, you can then identify that. That is a really valuable point of feedback integrate into your process, which is I need to take a closer look at these mean reversion strategies and see if they're even working because right now they're not. And that doesn't mean that they can't work, but it means that you have to look at the ugly part and address it directly. So now we talked about execution in a broad sense of kind of this context, conducting that analysis, building strategy, placing trades, how to create that feedback loop. Then we talked about the idea of managing a portfolio. And in the idea of managing a portfolio, we started with probably the most important thing, which is defining goals upfront, making sure that those goals are even partially realistic and then going from there. So I would love for any of you that actually has or even don't have your trading goals yet, put them in the chat. Let's talk about your goals because we're on episode three in the review so far and all of these so far depend on what your goal is. So if you have a bad goal, the rest of this is off. Completely skewed right out of the gate. That doesn't mean that you can't sort it out over time, but it means you're starting hobbled, which we want to avoid. So throw whatever your goal is for your portfolio and we can talk about it. The reason is we can literally fact check your goal based on how many years you have in trading. And most of you already know what my general guidance is with respect to setting goals as a new trader. It's really simple. If your year zero, really I call it year one, year two, your first two years greater than zero is awesome. It's good. It's not sexy, but that's good. Year three, four, five, we should start approximating towards whatever the target is. If it's the out performed the S&P 500, you should start approximating towards that. Does it mean that you're going to do it right away? But you should start that direction. And by year five, you should have a pretty good idea of what you're doing. You're still going to be way off from expert level. That's just the reality. It just takes time. It just takes time. But you should be on the right path. So looking at mine, one, two, three, four, I didn't outperform the market my first four years of trading. And then I outperform the market in my fifth year, which is also when I had my largest drawdown. And my outperformance on the fifth year was only because the market had like a completely sideways year. And then my sixth year, I underperformed. I still had pot. I was like very close to what the market was. I have the market at 15.88%. I was at 15.39. So it's just shy. And then after that is when I started pretty much always beating the market from that point. So it essentially took me six years to figure that out. So it's just to give you some context because the other thing I can say unequivocally is like I didn't have anywhere near the resources that you guys have now. The first five years, a lot of it was literally reading books because there's not like a depth of information that you can find from all these different places that exist now. And there certainly is no fucking AI, which is the biggest game changer I can possibly think of. Lauren says my goal is actually to net zero. I'm $167 away from that goal. Now that's actually kind of funny because when we're thinking of goals, you have to give yourself a little bit of wiggle room. Obviously, Lauren is saying hers partially ingest. So I'm not necessarily talking directly to hers in a vacuum. But one of the things when people are setting goals, they'll say things, one of the most common things I see, especially like the coaching side is when people say like, oh, I want to consistently outperform the market or something to that effect. But then when we talk about like the concept of consistent, what does consistent even mean? I know what the definition is, but what is your version of consistent in your trading, right? It's that kind of conversation that is really interesting to me because a lot of people don't really consider it that strongly. So getting to that level of detail matters a lot because what I can tell you is that, let's say for example, your goal is to have a positive return every single month. It's doable, but that's going to come with a lot of sacrifices and you're probably going to outperform on each individual month in terms of not having a down month, but you're probably going to really underperform over the course of a year because of how compounding returns work and how volatility you got to pick your poison. So it's that kind of stuff. Juicy bot says year zero stay in the black, get account to 10k. I think that's good. And if getting your account to 10k comes largely from savings, then I like that goal a lot. I don't know what your starting account number is. So I don't know what 10k would, what it would take to get there. But again, like if you're starting with a $5,000 account, getting to 10k is crazy, unless there's really good savings associated as double in your account. Even though it's not a big dollar amount, that's still a really high percent return. And this is why balancing between using percent returns and gross returns is really important because they both provide very, very needed content or context. Sorry. Juicy bot says started around three to four K. Yes, savings, both of that's perfect. That's good. Because again, remember in the beginning savings is literally, it's literally your absolute best friend like without a doubt. And I'll show you an example. So I'm not going to waste your time with like a compound growth calculator and all that shit. You guys have all seen that a million times. But let's say that we have a $5,000 account and let's say that we save $500 per month. And let's say that we just, we just keep on saving that $500 per month, no matter what. We just keep it going. So we can figure out what this will grow into over time like this. And we can see how significant that $500 is in the beginning. Notice how if I just plot this loosely, what I want you to see is how this savings number is so high in the beginning. If you save that $500 on that $5,000 account in your first month, that is equivalent to a 10% return in that first freaking month. If you annualize that kind of performance, it's literally out of this world. So for those that don't know what 10% monthly is, 213.8%. That's the annualized return in this context. Now it will be diminishing returns, right? Because now you're saving $500 and $5,500. But my point is the next month, guess what? 9.1% return. Your savings in the beginning is so unbelievably important to growing your account. That if you can stick with it, then you'll find yourself in an insanely better spot than starting with a small account and then trying to just trade your way there. For the first two years of your trading, if you take a look at what the return is on a monthly basis, it's still over 3% a month. Again, let me show you what 3% is monthly. Annualized. It's a 42.6% return. Nobody, you're not better than that. I'm not better than that. Nobody is better than that. And I don't mean that you can't beat that. That's not what I mean. What I mean is anybody that's sound of mind would say 42% year, whatever that is, I'm interested. I'm absolutely interested. Regardless, now this entire scenario changes. And I want to show you how it changes. Now let's say you have a $500,000 account. I think that's 50. And we're using the same 50 bucks. It doesn't really matter. We do the same thing over here. What do you guys notice about the return on a monthly basis? You're return collapses on this saving. This is still fine. You're still getting 0.1%. But again, if we annualize 0.1% per month, it's a 1.2% return. Literally nobody cares. So this is why in the beginning, your savings rate is with out of doubt your most powerful tool because you have access to this, which is awesome. And then as you have a developed account, your actual return amount as a percentage then starts to take hold in terms of what you're able to produce. Because again, let's say that you're able to produce 20% over the course of a year. If you take a look at what you can yield from that, I'm just showing you how to do the math. I think, well, I imagine most of you know how to do this math, but nonetheless, I will show you. You make your $100,000. $100,000 again, regardless of where you're at financially, is still enough. Like that moves the needle. Even if you're a deck of millionaire, you still care about 100K. There's nobody that doesn't care about 100K. It means different things. For some people, that can be life changing money. Once you develop money, that becomes the equivalent of like $500,000, $1,000, something like that, depending on how much money you have. Like what quote-unquote moves the needle for you will scale as your total resources scale. But this is still a lot of money no matter who you are or where you're at. If we take the same scenario, and we apply it here, you get $1,000. I mean, $1,000 is still $1,000. Same return, same 20% return. So what I'm showing you is that finding a balance between focusing on percentages and raw dollars is in your best interest. Because in the beginning, savings is literally your super power. After and this is why in this phase, we're not worried about trying to take your trading account and turn it into your future wealth. At this point, you are building the skill, the process. Like we talked about, you're building this background so that you can achieve this kind of return when you have this kind of money because then this is a meaningful amount of money at that point. Again, $1,000 is meaningful to everybody. $1,000, that genuinely does start to become negligible. Obviously, you still care about it, but it's a much lower threshold, especially if you have a lot of money in to put this into context. Let's say that you end up with $5 million. Take a look at the difference in scale of what percentage your wealth this constitutes. When you have $5 million, this $1,000 represents 0.02%. When you have $5 million, this $100,000 counts as 2%. That's still a decent amount of money. So it's all scale and context that you have to be mindful of. But the most important thing to pay attention to here is the relationship between percent returns and gross returns. Because this return is absolutely incredible. If you can maintain a 20% return, it's absolutely incredible. In the beginning, it's completely underwhelming. $1,000. But again, if you can continue this, when you build your money, this becomes a meaningful amount of money. I think I've made that point pretty clear at this stage. It's such an important point that, again, if you have any questions on this, please tell me it's worth the conversation. This is part of setting up realistic and healthy good initial expectations for you. This goes back to setting good goals. If you have bad goals, the probability of this working out for you is very low. Straight up. I get to open door for Thor. Okay. Point made. I presume. So next, let me get caught up on the chat real fast. I'm going to take my drugs. Trading or option says buying and selling shares based on weekly charts. It looks like you're just talking about your approach. This is cool. Trading option says so I'm trying to average the S&P 500 if it's more than better. Oh, I see. Yeah. So even that kind of goal, you have to be more specific. Because if you're saying something like I'm trying to average the S&P 500, the question that you genuinely have to ask yourself as a trader is like, why trade? If the goal is to do what the S&P 500 is doing, just buy the S&P 500, decrease your cost, and then get with the S&P 500 returns, right? There's nothing wrong with that. For a lot of people, it's a great choice. And I'm not saying that's what you actually want, but what I'm saying is that's why it's important to like fully define your goals. James says I'm trying to get to the point of positive expected return. That's good. But again, I would define what positive expected return means. Because if you segment your return, you might have a three month period where your expected return is negative. But then you might have an annual period where it's not and it's positive, right? So you can do stuff like that, but that's why being really specific is super important. Arielle says, wish my dad wasn't making me pay $500 for a parental student loan. So I could save it instead. What is a parental student loan? parental parental parental student loan. What is that? Lone taken out by a parent to help pay for the child education? Oh, so like it's for your education? I already paid my portion of it. This is a parent plus, which is in his name. I sent him a money. I want to pay off the high interest ones, but he doesn't understand interest percent always maxed credit cards. That, well, that sounds just like a general mess from like an underlying starting point to be completely honest with you. Because like if you guys weren't on the same page with taking out student loans or whatever, that's a giant mess. I mean, my reality is I was not going to take out student loans. My original game plan was to just enlist in the Marine Corps, like my brother did. But I had a high school teacher that talked me into going the officer route and trying for the scholarship. But without that, there was no chance that I was going to go. Lauren says I'd assume he's paying his dad back for loans. Yeah, I mean, I definitely think you should pay for your own loans. That's without an out. Like you should absolutely pay for your own shit. But if there was like a, if there was a difference between the original expectations, that's problematic for sure. Okay. I think we're clear on this point. Let us continue. So we already talked about this. We talked about this. Let's talk about this. So there's a couple of things that I want to discuss now for the sake of this session. Plus we need, we need, we need a place to play. We need some drawing space. Lauren says I don't have a goal and I don't do well without goals. I have to reassess. Yeah, definitely. It's the starting point. If you do not begin with the end in mind, that's from Steven Covey or the Marine Corps version of that is reverse plan. The probability of you landing where you want to land is so low. It's like literally unbelievable. It's Han's solo solo. It's a terrible joke. But I thought it was kind of fun to say. But I completely agree with you. You absolutely need to reassess because that is the first step in this journey is to set goals. Without goals, it's all random behavior because you have no idea how to do anything. And what I mean by that is if you're a call, when we're talking about managing a portfolio, what's one of the first things we talked about? We talked about figuring out how much risk I need to have on figuring out answering the questions like how many trades should I have on? And it shouldn't be like, oh, I should have five trades on. The fuck does five trades mean? It's completely random. So the way that we add clarity and structure around this is by starting with a goal because then we can say, okay, if I have my annual goal, I can break that down into monthly targets based on that monthly target. I can assess how much risk I need to have out at a given point in time based on the expected return of the individual trades that I have on. That's beautiful part about options. I can tell you at the onset of the trade, what is the probability of the various profit potential scenarios occurring? And again, if we want to refresh of that, tell me, and we can literally run through it. It's not difficult. But that process is how you cleanly determine what should be on when and how much, but all of that is driven by your original goals that you set. So in my opinion, that is the absolute first thing before you do any of this other stuff is build those goals. Cool. Joe says, Han Solo Solo, how's the first time I heard it? Probably because it's really dumb. I, yeah, it's a silly thing to say, but it's kind of fun. All right. So now let's talk about really this series of things that you see here, sustaining your work, optimizing, and then integrating these components. So I'm actually going to take this, put it on this slide. We'll squish all this down. Let we can talk about it. Great. So the first thing that we need to discuss is this idea of building a sustainable approach. This is the same thing that goes into building a sustainable approach for anything for you. So I'm going to talk to you from a moment from my own lens. This is like a selfish way to frame this versus me taking the time to like try to consider your lens more, but it's easier for me to frame it from my lens and then see what you can draw from it. So when I think about sustainment, we'll start down down here. There's a few things that I know I need. I need structure. I need a process. I need to build it into a habit. So let's talk about these individually really quick. Structure is me fitting the entire context of what I'm doing into one spot. So when I think about the structure of your approach as a trader, it really is this here. This more or less is the structure that's going into this. It's kind of identifying what we need to do to make money and then how we plan to execute that. That's the structure. So we've already built that in the prior sessions. The process is really important because I've already defined a few processes for you. There's the outlier strategy process. There's the outlier trade process. These are two examples of defined sub-process within this structure. So this is the way that my brain looks at it. And the reason why my brain works this way is because it allows me to be consistent in detail in what I'm doing if I'm not reinventing what I'm trying to do each time I'm doing it. So for example, the four steps that go into the outlier strategy process and trade process, it's the same. For any strategy that I'm exploring or building, I'm going to apply that same process, that same rough outline. Now the details will be different. Same thing when I'm doing something like scanning. Or even a daily rhythm. This process building this cadence of a regular way of doing things, it really lowers the threshold that you have to get over in order to do it. So if you're thinking about the process of building a strategy, it can be really overwhelming. So if you're thinking about what goes into building a strategy, if you try to think about the problem that's not in an organized manner, you're going to miss things. And you're probably going to say things like, well, I don't want to do that part because that's a lot of work. Or what I'm doing now is good enough. You'll come up with all these different things because it's the same saying that you've heard how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time. It's the same kind of idea. If you look at the whole elephant, you get overwhelmed. So by building these different process, not only do you build a repeatable pattern, but you make big, complex things much more palatable to work through. It's not a section. It's not like a problem set of like, how do I build this entire positively expecting strategy that does everything that I want? Right? That's a big problem to solve. But again, if you refer back to the Outlier Strategy process, the very first thing that you do is think of a profit mechanism and analyze it. That's it. That's your homework. That's your entire focus when you're trying to build a trading process. The first step is to think of the profit mechanism. The homework could affect and analyze it. That's it. That's your homework. That's all you have to focus on. You don't have to worry about anything else. You don't have to worry about sizing. You don't have to worry about your stops. You don't have to worry about how often you should trade it. You don't have to worry about how many times none of that matters yet. You focus on that one thing. And if you can continue to focus on the one thing at each stage in the process, the output is something that's pretty robust. So this process nature is really important to me. It's what I do for everything. From weightlifting, I have a very specific periodization and process that I follow. Like literally everything I do. And it's because it's more efficient and you'll get a better result. So when I'm trying to think about a sustainable approach, I view this section as an investment because the cool part is once you build an effective process, guess what? It's there. The effective process is consistent. It's there. So you don't have to reinvent the process, building it, building the infrastructure at first can be a little difficult. But once it's there, it's there. You can tweak it over time and stuff. But my point is is that you now have something you can reliably use and modify it as you go. But it's not doing the entire thing over and over again in a novel way. The last thing for me, and this is like a big like me ism is habit. I consider myself the most disciplined, undisciplined person on earth. And what I mean by that is I have to barter with myself all the time to do things, to not do things that I want or don't want to do. And through that, you get used to it. And then it becomes less and less and less of a mental hurdle to get over each time. A great example of this is a trade log. If you build a trade log that has 62 inputs, the probability of you filling that in is not super great. But there's value in making yourself do it. So what I would do with something like a trade log is I would sit down and I would say for this strategy, what variables are important to me? For this strategy, I would list them all out. One, two, three, so on. And then when I got to the end of what I think is relevant to it, I would build that into a log. And let's say that it's 50 inputs because I don't know what matters yet. What I would tell myself is I don't have to do 50 inputs forever. I need to do 50 inputs until I can see a clear defined trend in the usefulness of the inputs. So here's a great example. If I'm trading something like zero DTEs in SPX, do I think the 10-day MA matters? If I'm being honest in the beginning, I don't know. I don't know. So I track it. But then as I put on 200 of these, and I noticed that the correlation of 10-day MA to outcome, to severity is very low. And I analyze the robustness of the feature through something like random forest or something like that. Then I can confidently say I don't need this anymore. So then what I do is I start with however many inputs I think matter. And I tell myself until I get a data sample large enough, I'm going to do this. And then once I get a data sample that shows me clear trends, then I am willing to update what I track and maybe get rid of the 10-day MA. And whatever else doesn't necessarily matter. I'm making an agreement with myself. Because I know how my brain works. If I look at this and I say, fuck, I don't want to do 50 inputs forever on this thing. That's really annoying. So then I'm going to quit right in the beginning. I might do it once or twice because I'm excited. I think it's going to be cool. And then after a while it's like, damn, like I'm not near the computer. And then that happens a couple days. And then I have a backlog. And then I have a big problem. So I'm making agreement with myself. And I literally say do it for X period of time. And it depends on the strategy. How many samples I need. And if I adhere to that, then I can adjust it. And I know I'm not cheating myself. I know I'm not being lazy. I know that I've taken a look at this thing and I can confidently say this does or does not matter. That's what I do here. So this in my opinion is all part and parcel to building a sustainable approach. Because if you get burnt out and you stop doing things, if you start cutting corners, none of this will work. So you have to find something that's repeatable to you. And that's why the consistency element is on this list. Because if it's not consistent, it's not really going to work for you longer term. Because then you do not have that precious feedback loop. That feedback loop is what will eventually make money for you. All right. The next thing to talk about here is building resilience. This idea of resilience really comes down to what I would consider exposure therapy. So this is things like it's why I insist when we talk about rolling a trade. I insist on somebody being able to say I booked a loss. I insist on that. If somebody can't say that, we have a problem. We have loss aversion and we need to get over that. Or another thing I would find with myself sometimes where if I took a trade off, that was a small loss, I wouldn't want to log it. It's a small loss. It doesn't really matter. I just want to put it in the data. But then if I take a look, the small wins are sure shit in there. Loss aversion. So resilience comes from forcing you to look at markets as what they are and accepting them. This is why you'll find traders that have been around for a long time really don't have a problem with being wrong. They might some of them might like being right more than others. That might be a more valuable component to different traders. But all of them won't have a problem with being wrong. And it's because guess what? You're exposed to it long enough. You learn that this is part of the trade is what it is dog. Accept it. Same thing with scaling. This one's difficult at least for people like me because I'm risk averse. I definitely know that from my underlying starting point with markets and scaling was always difficult. So let's say that I put on a one lot and let's say that the P&L variation on a daily basis is like 50 bucks. If I look at that long enough, I become desensitized to that P&L variation of 50 bucks. But if I jump to a five lot and now I have P&L variation of 250 bucks, I become uneasy. I'm concerned. I start second guessing things. Is this a new path? It does the strategy not work anymore. So on and so forth. So I set myself up for failure. The times where this was happened is when I was too focused on the profit potential, not enough on the risk side of the equation. And then when I start seeing some of the risk, I get nervous, I get shaken out that kind of stuff. So the solution here for me was exposure therapy. It's literally going from a one lot to a two lot. So now when I see the $100 movement, I assess how I feel. If I feel a little bit off about it, I remind myself this is sized appropriately. This is less than a percent total risk. I'm fine. It's just a new number. Get used to the number. And then the same thing. So then as your account goes from 50k to 100k. And in order to keep the same size, let's say this was like whatever 0.5% of the total account, I'm obviously not checking the math. But in order to keep the same half point exposure, again, if we go from 50 to 100, this would have to double. But that can be uncomfortable. So I don't immediately make the double. I'll go to three. See how I feel at 150, look at 150, see how it behaves at 150 in terms of the P and R range. And then I'll scale this way, exposure therapy, same thing for anything else. The same way that you build muscle in the gym, it's literally exposed with therapy. So this I think is really important to get behind in terms of building a sustainable approach is avoiding Goldilocks analysis, focusing on the outputs that are the outcomes that you want and putting on trades that are missized. Work your way up. Next, great example, literally absolutely fantastic example for those that are OGs in the chat that have been around since I started the channel literally just over five years ago, the channel launched on four May 2020. When I talked about the coverage triangle, what was the ticker you would have heard me talk about? For the people that have found the channel in the last six months, if I talk about the coverage triangle, what ticker do I talk about? Recent James, I see two OGs. For somebody that found the channel recently. There you go. Jordan says, I bit TQs, the stuff that I'm in. What do you notice? It changed. Why did it change? This markets are dynamic. There was a time period where I WM was far superior for my use case for a litany of reasons. It performed well by your vault, so on and so forth. However, what's happened in the last five years? We've had a massive shift where large cap tech is grossly outperforming. Things like Bitcoin is grossly outperforming. So this is where I embrace the dynamic nature of markets. I can always tell an immature trader when I see somebody, and it honestly doesn't happen with you guys too much, which is good, but I see it happen in other communities where they'll say to somebody, they'll say something like, but you said blank. And the problem with the, but you said is you are lingering at something that was said at a point in time relevant to that point in time and shit changes. So for example, if somebody told you whenever the market goes down, I'm going to rotate into gold or even better, whenever the market goes down, I'm going to rotate into bonds. For a long time, for a really long time, that would have worked. But guess what? If you blindly followed that in the last few years, you would have had your face ripped off. If you cannot accept the fact that you have to be dynamic, this is not for you. So embrace that fact because with that dynamic nature, more opportunities emerge. Great example. If you think about SPX, it used to have only opX. Third Friday. Then all of a sudden, it has weaklies. Then all of a sudden, it has mid weeks. Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Then all of a sudden in May of 22, it now is daily. This is a dynamic change that's fantastic because now this is where an entire strategy has been born. Zero DTEs. Zero DTEs did not exist before this because you couldn't trade them on a weekly basis. That's not enough occurrences. So you get a chance to get something with way more repetitions. It's a beautiful part, an absolutely beautiful part about the evolution of markets. You got to embrace it. I bet another great example. We're in a new Bitcoin ETF. That's in the portfolio already. Why? Because it's a great way to trade a strategy that I like in a new product that makes sense. So learning to look at changing markets and not have your feet stuck in concrete is very, very important. Very, very important. If you can't do that, you get left behind. So you have to learn to monitor what's going on and be open to changes, which leads beautifully into the last topic here, developing wealth. One of the things that I tell people is a W2 is super risky. Not only are you directly trading time for money, but you are one bad period away from not having this one bad time. We saw this during COVID. What happened during COVID? Tons of people got laid off. It's not because the companies are evil and they don't want you. It's that the company has to do with the company has to do in order to fucking survive. This you literally serve at will. So the problem here is that you can't scale in a lot of W2 jobs. If you're in sales or something you can scale, meaning to a certain degree, but literally nothing is the scalability of markets. With the click of a button, I can go from a one lot to a ten lot. I can 10X my size literally by clicking a button. If I'm in sales, I can't 10X my calls per hour once I get it fully optimized. There's only so much time you can put into calls into that hour. It's going to take time. It's the same thing if you work a standard W2 job. You're going to run into a threshold at some point where you cannot scale it anymore because of this equation. That's a beautiful thing about markets is that with the click of a button, I can scale at will to whatever I want. That's huge. Now, the next thing to keep in mind is that as I mentioned, markets change. I am a firm believer in what I call, I don't call it the wealth triangle, but I call it the three levers of wealth. This somewhere in here, be towards the beginning, this. Three levers of wealth. The idea is to focus on your savings rate, start investing, build an income. This immediately, this coupling of investing in income is really solid. It's because you now are building robustness for yourself. This is why I structure myself the way that I do is for the sake of robustness. It's because I give myself staying power. You guys have seen in the Discord, I show you different places that I make money from and how I make money from it. People will say, Eric, why do you get into this other thing if you're good at trading? I am good at trading and I actually have investments and other things that underperform what I do as a trader. Once you have a decent size pie, meaning amount of money, you want to make sure that I don't know what's going to happen with markets and I'm not going to pretend that I do. I think they'll be here. I think options trading will still be a thing 20 years from now, but I don't know. So I'm building robustness in the approach and it's something to consider. Once you get scaled to a point that you can start breaking off different amounts of money and putting it into other kinds of assets is something to consider. For me, it started really simple. It started with residential real estate. Well, this is when I was more developed because all the way back in college, I started with things like hard money lending, angel investing, flipping stuff, all that kind of shit. But then as I scaled, I started getting into real estate and actually getting into more structured angel investing. And then I started getting into different kinds of real estate, commercial real estate, all of these other kinds of asset classes that perform very differently, but there's a place for them. And it's because sometimes there will be ebb and flow between them. But regardless, no matter what, we will see some sort of return, again, ideally, that will scale with us. So it's something else to consider when we're talking about this just outlier options trading approach is although the developing wealth conversation that we just had doesn't really pertain to options. It pertains to you as the options trader and your ability to build money. So let me see first and foremost, do you guys have any questions whatsoever? Bramins says, what's the purpose? We already talked about that. So I can't tell if you just don't like the answer or what, but we talked about that one actually a couple times. So I think we've successfully discussed that one. Are there any questions on anything that we've talked about so far? Setting a good foundation via a good landscape analysis and creating an orientation to building your approach, to creating steps, to actually enact that approach, to then executing the approach that you framed, how to manage a portfolio, how to build a sustainable approach to this path as a trader. Now, if all of that has resonated well and you don't have any questions, just let me know. And in the meantime, I want to talk about this thing that we refer to, why I refer to us as outliers and what this means. Bramins says, I missed it. Oh, you just asked that. I think on the video a couple days ago, didn't you? Because I answered it in that live stream. That would have been on Wednesday. So yeah, whenever, if you check out that live stream, whenever, whenever you asked it last, I talked about it because you asked this one before. So yeah, I think it would have been in the one's day live stream. So the reason why I call it outlier trading, and the reason why I call our community and you outlier and outliers is there's a couple different ways in my opinion to be an outlier and they complement one another. The first one is here. When you think about the actual mindset that needs to be embraced, this is the first step. This is accessible to everybody right now starting today. You can be an outlier by adopting a different mindset right out of the gate. Then there's the outcome. But this precedes this every single time. You have to have this, which is why I call us outliers. It's literally to give you your own subconscious queuing for your brain. That's exactly why I do it. And it's because I've told you this story before, but it is something I deeply believe in. And it's back in like middle school. I forgot what grade junior high or some shit like that, where I used to tell myself I'm bad at math. I'm bad at math. And I always struggled in math for some reason. Yet I one day I literally just said to myself, I'm just going to stop saying it. That's it. I literally just told myself I'm going to stop saying it. And then all of a sudden I started, I was never great at math. Maybe I didn't become like a fucking math genius, but I was fine. I absolutely did fine. I was in all honors. Everything was fine. So the point is I'm literally using our community as a vector to queue your mind to try and start that subconscious adoption to a different mindset. That's why. So you literally can become an outlier literally today, today by adopting a different mindset. So what is this mindset that I'm spending so much time harping on and talking about? Well, let's think about it. First, let's think about what the normal normal, crater, embodies, most are lazy, most want immediate gratification, most want really high returns, most want to be able to achieve this with low risk, most want to not have to spend a lot of time. And so on and so forth. So we can see what normal looks like. And we know what the output of normal is in markets because I literally have this again on the website so that everybody can see because I think taking the reality of trading for what it is, right? So if you go under resources and you go to do traders make money, I literally give you specific specific studies. This isn't like my opinion. These are actual facts from peer-reviewed research for you to look at on your own. But the reality is most that start trading, wash out within five years, 7% will proceed past that. So 93% gone five years. For a large majority over that time frame, they will underperform the market on average by six and a half points. A really dangerous thing is of that 7% that continues beyond the five year mark, a minority of those are still underperforming the market. They don't outperform the market. They just keep doing it. This is the reality. This is what normal is. And this is why you need to do other things. You need to adopt a different approach. So this is the same, what I'm showing you is the same thing that I always do. Notice how the beginning of the series starts with an orientation, a landscape analysis. That's what I'm giving you literally in adopting an outlier mindset. I'm giving you a landscape analysis here. So now what do you guys think? What are some of the behaviors that you would imagine in outlier in trading in bodies? Let me see what you guys think. And in the meantime, you already know, gotta pop the door for the old boy. What do you guys think? Think of the specific habits, behaviors that serves as an antithesis to what I just showed you, what normal is. I literally showed you exactly what normal looks like. One sec. I'm just coordinating with my visit and friends. Jared says beginning with the end in mind, I literally couldn't agree with that more. So notice how when we started this whole thing, we talked about setting realistic goals. And reverse engineer. Why? Because again, this back checks literally all of this in one in one swoop. One fell swoop. You get all of this. So I literally couldn't agree with that more. That's probably one of the best first possible stops that you could begin with. J. T. Erick says consistent discipline and focus. You can't get better at something that you don't spend time on. So if you don't make a conscious decision to actively scale, then this will not work. So I think that that's absolutely massive. With out of doubt. What else do we think? There's a couple other things that I would integrate into this. Something like if you don't take the time to actually learn about markets and to learn about something like options before you start trading them, it's as simple as that is. The majority of people that start trading options spend far too little time actually understanding how they work. And then they're surprised that they lose money. Now again, I don't disagree with the Tom Sawznaf approach of just take a small account and start doing things that you know aren't going to hurt you. Vertical spreads are in condors. It's not what I would do, but I think that's fine. But the point is that person is starting that process from the point of placing those trades simply to learn. They're not placing those trades trying to make a bunch of money. They're trying to see how things work. So I think spending the time to learn as dumb as that is is probably one of the greatest differentiators for an option trader. It's crazy to say, but that is exactly it. And I've given you guys literally a syllabus that I think is good, that I think makes sense. That's available for everybody. It's on the website. It's called the All-R trading guide or some shit like that. You look at that whenever you want. But the cool part is if you take the time to actually learn about options, then all of this other ship becomes so much easier. You actually start to realize that having the quote unquote best strategy really doesn't matter. You start to identify all these other things that you spend so much worthless time on because you don't know any better. And it's actually a big corner to turn in my opinion. So I think those are like three super, super simple first steps on how you can change what I would consider to be an outlier mindset. So are there any questions on what we've talked about? Are there any elements that we went through that you're not sure of anything like that? I want to make sure that we have a chance to hit everything. And the meantime, I'm getting my dinner order ready. Lauren says no excuse for laziness over here. That's right. Nobody cares. Laziness is literally unacceptable. It will never work in markets. You don't necessarily have to be completely obsessed like I am, but you absolutely do need to integrate some of what you're doing on like a realistic basis, meaning if some of what you're doing is just selling covered calls, that's great. But it means that there's a really good chance you're not going to outperform the market in that context. It's exactly for that reason. So you can find things that generally fit in with your expectations and what you're trying to do. But again, you have to analyze things objectively and take it for what it is. Braimes says, is it better to buy Jamie stock or play options? This is a great question. And it's so funny because it literally shows a misunderstanding of literally what we're talking about right now. And I don't mean that to poke at you. But I mean, it's like such a great example. And oh, weird. So again, let's go back to see if we can answer that question. Is it better to buy Jamie stock or to play options? Well, you guys already know exactly how we would answer that. We have to start first by defining what is better. What are we trying to do? One from there, we have to take a look at what our skill set is because I know for me what the answer is, for me, it's a blend without a doubt. I wouldn't do just one or the other. But for somebody else, it may or may not be because it's going to be individualized and it's going to be based on the skill set. So the important part though, and the point that I want to drive home is this, define. What's the goal? What is what does better mean in the context of that goal? And then from there, you can work down a logical flow, hopefully to, you know, find that. Arrive at something that is satisfactory for you. But that's exactly how I think about it. I would start with defining that. And then you can determine what makes the most sense. Brimis says, I suppose in my opinion, if it's one wanted to invest rather than gamble on the ticker, let's completely different. You're talking about that is that's irrelevant to GameStop. What you're doing there is you're saying one of them is investing, which I assume you mean buying stock. And then you're essentially saying that if you trade options, you're gambling. And fun story on that. I literally have a video that I released not that long ago. No, that's a lie. It's not out yet. I have a video that's coming out towards the end of the month that talks about the exact discussion of is options trading just gambling. Now that part aside, really what this is, I think, it's a reflection of the way that we think about it. Brimis says longer term, I mean, but you can go longer term with options. Again, this is why understanding the products is so important. I can buy options in GameStop that are 945 days out quite a while over two years. And then I can roll those if I want. I can move them further and further to maintain the position. So again, this is exactly why going through these steps are so important, right? Making sure maybe we'll do, we'll add a step here. I think that's actually a worthy add in to like decisively learn about markets and options. Because if you do this, then we might be able to solve for some of this stuff. So yeah, and that's kind of like the fun exercise, right? It comes down to again, what the goal is and then how might we get to a point where we hit that goal? Now the last thing that I want to hit on before we wrap up is I want to talk a little bit about the reality of this thing because I think for a lot of people, you might see where I'm at now after doing this for a long time. And it is a completely unfair comparison for really anybody. And it's because everybody has their own little world that they're operating in. And it's not like this shit just magically all came to me and all worked at the same time. It's just not true. So because of that, I think if you accept the fact and give yourself some grace to learn to make mistakes, we all make mistakes. I make mistakes to this day in trading. It will never fully go away. There's always little things. But if you give yourself a little bit of wiggle room and you don't for me, at least what I would do is beat myself up quite a lot if I made a mistake. And there's a point of diminishing returns. So I think embracing the fact that it's something that's learned over time is really, really important. So don't hold yourself to some sort of crazy standard that you aspire to and think that you're going to hit it out of the gate. Because it's really, really difficult to do that. And then you kind of set yourself up for failure, I think. If that's how you evaluate yourself, whereas you might be doing really, really well, but it just might not be exactly to what you're wanting to do at that point. But give yourself a little bit of grace as long as you're continuing to learn, I think you're already well on the way. What I would do is literally set up a cadence where every week, maybe on Friday, I would do like a weekly quiz in chat UBT. And I would start with a general topic that I wanted to teach me. And then the questions that I got wrong on the next quiz, I would ask it to ask me similar style of questions for this topic that I got wrong until I get it right. And that's exactly what I would do. So keep that in mind, please, because this stuff is doable, even if it looks a little bit heavy up front. As always, if you need anything, you can hit me up in the discord, be an outlier. See you guys later.
