706.00s: I
710.00s: you
713.00s: Gene
718.00s: closer to the actual reality that you thought this was going to be for. It's kind of funny.
723.76s: Because when you first start trading the idea of, again, turning a small account into a
728.32s: large account really fast and easy, it's so far fetched. It's unbelievably unlikely to
735.76s: occur. However, there will be instances where it can happen. People do win the lottery.
741.52s: It's the same style concept, but that's not reliable. It's not something that you can count
748.04s: on. It's something that you might hope for, but that's not going to cut it, right? If you're
753.56s: thinking about what you're trying to do as a trader, it's much deeper than that. And if your way to
758.76s: get there is just hope, that's not a great way to go about this thing. So episode one was taking
766.60s: the very, very common initial ideas, hopes, desires, dreams that, fun enough, all of us have,
775.40s: myself included, coming into trading and essentially throwing them all out.
782.84s: And it's looking at the reality of this thing, taking it for what it is, which is a good thing,
788.12s: by the way, because there's a massive opportunity here, but it will only exist for those that can
795.88s: get over the initial hurdle of throwing away your naive hopes, dreams, goals, and instead
804.28s: digging into the details, that is exactly what this is. So if you can focus less on wanting to turn
816.60s: your account into a ton of money, if you can focus less on that in more unbuilding, a solid foundation,
825.32s: you will actually position yourself to be able to realize those hopes and dreams in a real sense
832.84s: as compared to just the aspirations of thinking of them. So that was episode one.
837.88s: Episode two, we literally ran through an actual approach, how to do this thing. And this is kind
847.32s: of a fun conversation, I think, because it takes a lot of the common ways of thinking, the common
857.00s: questions that I know that I had, and we literally talk through all of them.
862.76s: So these are things like how do you even start thinking about how to make money? We talked about
867.00s: that with examples. How do we think about managing risks, get the trade in portfolio level? We
871.88s: talked about that with details and examples. How do we combine all of this into employing a portfolio?
880.68s: Shocker, we talked about that with examples. And you'll notice that a lot of this started from
888.52s: thinking through what you're trying to do and creating a plan, which is exactly what's the next
896.44s: part of that original second episode was about, which is literally giving you steps to follow,
903.56s: literally laying the framework. Do follow this path, and it will get you much, much, much closer
910.20s: to where you're trying to go. Now, the funny thing with trading is you can do all the right
918.12s: things and still lose money. You can do a bunch of wrong things and still make money.
923.48s: But what will happen over your trading career is if you focus on a foundational process,
933.64s: your results will approximate towards your skill set. This is the quintessential concept of law
942.36s: of large numbers. And it's a really important concept to understand. Because essentially,
949.24s: when we're looking at markets, we know it's not normally distributed, pretend that that's
954.68s: a normal distribution. We know this isn't it. If we think of stock prices, we know that they're
960.44s: skew and kurtosis. We know that there's a higher probability. We'll see a little bit of a
966.76s: right skew, but fatter tails, like this. That's terrible drawing, but the point is that there's a higher
976.36s: probability of a smaller positive move and a lower probability of a negative move. But there's a
984.20s: much higher probability out at the tails of bigger moves. If all that doesn't mean anything to you,
990.52s: that's okay. Just listen, let the random words enter your brain in over time, it will make sense.
997.56s: This is a this is a world of repetition. None of this shit made sense to me either. But this is the
1003.40s: fact. So now if we take this concept and we apply it to your trading, let's take a look at a PNL
1010.84s: plot. And let's say that this is a time series. So this is t zero. And then this is t x, whatever
1019.16s: at point in the future we want to refer to. And here's your PNL. What will happen is this is your
1026.68s: zero line for PNL. What will happen is over time, you're going to start plotting trades. So your first
1033.72s: trade, the worst thing that can happen is it's a nice big winner. And then your second trade is
1040.12s: also a winner. Your third trade is a winner. Your fourth trade is a small loss. And then what will
1046.04s: happen is this will fill in with tons and tons and tons of trades. Now the idea is if you are
1061.16s: progressing as a trader, here's what will happen in the beginning. If we just
1069.56s: add a time hack here, let's just call it t one, it doesn't matter what Dora one one month, one
1074.68s: year, it doesn't matter short term timeframe. Your performance plot might look something like this.
1081.56s: If we drew a line of best fit through this, it might be something like this. And you might see
1089.56s: AM, I'm crushing it. I'm doing really, really well. But then what will happen is let's say that
1096.52s: first year just happened to be a stroke of luck. Let's say that you started selling puts into a decade
1105.40s: long bullish cycle, for example, just throwing stuff out there. And you continue to trade. Well,
1112.60s: what will end up happening is we don't just see what happens in this section here because your
1120.44s: performance will carry over. But what you'll see happening is your P and L will start to do this.
1130.04s: And you'll say, okay, I'm still doing well. I don't like that the P and L is declining, but maybe
1136.20s: this is just one year more and so on and so forth. And if you're still not learning as a trader,
1143.16s: what will happen is we add again, more and more. Hashes into this time series. And literally,
1151.16s: what you will find is that your your line of best fit will literally negatively invert. Despite
1158.12s: how successful you were in the beginning, if you keep doing this long enough, you will start to
1163.08s: lose unless you can embrace exactly what I'm outlining here that you have to focus on the process.
1169.32s: Yes, if this doesn't make sense to you, please tell me because it is absolutely worth taking the
1176.52s: time to understand this concept. It's the same thing that if you looked at you get a lottery ticket,
1184.36s: you buy one lottery ticket, you win 50 bucks and you say, well, they are. I made 50 bucks.
1193.00s: What if I take this 50 bucks and then I go buy five $10 lottery tickets?
1204.92s: You would have been better off taking this and going away because these will be losses. This one
1213.00s: might be scratch. And then this one might be 10 bucks. And this is not a terrible outcome for
1221.32s: this scenario, by the way, this is a really good probabilistic outcome. This typically wouldn't happen.
1227.16s: And then you're like, oh, well, I get another ticket out of this one. So maybe I'll get this ticket.
1233.40s: I'll reinvest this one. And now you get your two tickets. Well, what's going on here?
1239.56s: The first thing is you started with one ticket. You walked out with 50 bucks. Then you got five tickets.
1244.44s: Now you're back down to two tickets. You're going the wrong fucking way. And this is what will happen
1248.92s: with lottery. It's the same thing with trading. If you do not pay enough attention to your
1254.20s: development of your skill set is your money will fucking evaporate even if you're successful
1260.20s: in a short term timeframe, unless you cash out and don't go back. So you have to figure out what's
1268.44s: right for you. If you put on a super lucky trade and you're like, wow, I identified that I was
1274.44s: super lucky. And I still want to learn how to trade. But I don't want to necessarily light on
1280.60s: my money on fire. Take 95% of the money out. Keep five percent in and see what you can do to learn.
1288.04s: Or do the logical thing and go to paper trading. I know nobody likes that because it's not fun. But
1294.76s: guess what? It's a really great way to learn.
1297.80s: Trading or option says that's what happened to me at the beginning. It is so common. I completely
1305.40s: identify with you. It's what happens to a lot of us. I call it the illusion of path. And the
1313.56s: illusion of path is you don't have this kind of context. You see your P&L curve going like this
1323.72s: and you're like, wow, this is awesome. But again, if this was year one, this literally
1330.60s: whatever the slope is of this, it doesn't matter. It literally doesn't matter. Because once you
1336.12s: plot this out to be year 30, whatever happened here provided you didn't blow up is completely irrelevant.
1345.16s: And whatever happened here probably doesn't matter. Meaning you're learning the core concepts.
1351.24s: You're not at the point yet where you're actually building good infrastructure for what you're doing.
1356.84s: You're just learning how markets work. So in the beginning, you just have to accept that that's
1362.84s: really the bulk of what you're doing is just getting general understanding of things.
1369.32s: And then it's off of that that you can eventually learn and grow, which is the cool part.
1374.36s: And this is why if you emphasize the process, the rest of that learning curve will happen. It will
1380.60s: happen. There's nothing that difficult about what we do as traders. There really isn't.
1387.40s: It's one of those kinds of things where most of it's out there. The general stuff is what it is.
1394.44s: And as long as you can pick it up, then you will be fine in the long run. But so many people get stuck
1401.88s: in that first three year window because they can't get out of their own way because they have
1406.68s: the wrong expectations and they haven't built an approach. So this is the second thing that we
1411.08s: talked about that as you could tell is massively important to your success longer term as a trader.
1418.76s: Okay, great. Next.
1423.24s: We then talked about how to execute as a trader in a day to day lens. We talked about literally
1433.24s: how to start with a top down analysis of the economy, the stock market to build context,
1439.16s: to then literally how to build a portfolio. And we talked about how to size things, how to manage risk.
1446.76s: We talked about all of these different concepts because this is where the rubber meets the road.
1452.52s: This is where you actually build something and it's not haphazard. You're not building something
1459.80s: that you're like, oh, I feel like this is going to go up or I feel like this is going to go down.
1465.80s: That's nothing. That doesn't mean anything. That's a random opinion that nobody cares about,
1470.60s: especially the market. However, if you learn to apply a general trading approach that's repeatable.
1479.48s: Again, you get a lot of really valuable feedback. For example, if I have a trade log and I look back
1486.92s: over my last 50 trades, let's say I'm trading directionally with long calls. I look back over
1491.40s: the last 50 and I have a little note section in there because in the beginning that note section is
1496.84s: really useful and you're dissecting your notes and you start to realize like, man, these mean
1502.60s: reversion trades really are not working that great. Whenever I think something is overbought,
1509.72s: somehow it keeps going or when something's oversold, somehow it keeps rolling down.
1517.48s: I thought it was going to do the opposite. If you have good documentation and good approach
1523.16s: for your entries, you can then identify that. That is a really valuable point of feedback
1528.68s: integrate into your process, which is I need to take a closer look at these mean reversion
1533.88s: strategies and see if they're even working because right now they're not. And that doesn't mean
1538.36s: that they can't work, but it means that you have to look at the ugly part and address it directly.
1545.72s: So now we talked about execution in a broad sense of kind of this context, conducting that analysis,
1554.36s: building strategy, placing trades, how to create that feedback loop. Then we talked about the idea
1563.00s: of managing a portfolio. And in the idea of managing a portfolio, we started with probably the
1569.40s: most important thing, which is defining goals upfront, making sure that those goals are even partially
1574.76s: realistic and then going from there. So I would love for any of you that actually has or even don't
1583.24s: have your trading goals yet, put them in the chat. Let's talk about your goals because we're on
1590.12s: episode three in the review so far and all of these so far depend on what your goal is.
1598.28s: So if you have a bad goal, the rest of this is off. Completely skewed right out of the gate.
1606.92s: That doesn't mean that you can't sort it out over time, but it means you're starting hobbled,
1610.92s: which we want to avoid. So throw whatever your goal is for your portfolio and we can talk about it.
1620.44s: The reason is we can literally fact check your goal based on how many years you have in trading.
1628.84s: And most of you already know what my general guidance is with respect to setting
1636.04s: goals as a new trader. It's really simple. If your year zero, really I call it year one, year two,
1644.36s: your first two years greater than zero is awesome. It's good. It's not sexy, but that's good.
1652.44s: Year three, four, five, we should start approximating towards whatever the target is. If it's the out
1660.68s: performed the S&P 500, you should start approximating towards that. Does it mean that you're going to do it
1665.24s: right away? But you should start that direction. And by year five, you should have a pretty good
1672.60s: idea of what you're doing. You're still going to be way off from expert level. That's just the
1677.48s: reality. It just takes time. It just takes time. But you should be on the right path. So looking at
1686.60s: mine, one, two, three, four, I didn't outperform the market my first four years of trading.
1697.64s: And then I outperform the market in my fifth year, which is also when I had my largest drawdown.
1705.32s: And my outperformance on the fifth year was only because the market had like a completely sideways
1710.76s: year. And then my sixth year, I underperformed. I still had pot. I was like very close to what
1716.76s: the market was. I have the market at 15.88%. I was at 15.39. So it's just shy. And then after that
1725.00s: is when I started pretty much always beating the market from that point. So it essentially took me
1734.04s: six years to figure that out. So it's just to give you some context because the other thing I can
1743.32s: say unequivocally is like I didn't have anywhere near the resources that you guys have now.
1747.88s: The first five years, a lot of it was literally reading books because there's not like a depth of
1755.96s: information that you can find from all these different places that exist now. And there certainly
1760.76s: is no fucking AI, which is the biggest game changer I can possibly think of.
1767.88s: Lauren says my goal is actually to net zero. I'm $167 away from that goal. Now that's actually
1774.76s: kind of funny because when we're thinking of goals, you have to give yourself a little bit of
1783.40s: wiggle room. Obviously, Lauren is saying hers partially ingest. So I'm not necessarily talking
1789.24s: directly to hers in a vacuum. But one of the things when people are setting goals, they'll say things,
1796.04s: one of the most common things I see, especially like the coaching side is when people say like,
1799.80s: oh, I want to consistently outperform the market or something to that effect. But then when we talk
1808.28s: about like the concept of consistent, what does consistent even mean? I know what the definition is,
1813.72s: but what is your version of consistent in your trading, right? It's that kind of conversation that
1819.96s: is really interesting to me because a lot of people don't really consider it that strongly.
1826.60s: So getting to that level of detail matters a lot because what I can tell you is that,
1832.36s: let's say for example, your goal is to have a positive return every single month. It's doable,
1837.56s: but that's going to come with a lot of sacrifices and you're probably going to outperform
1842.12s: on each individual month in terms of not having a down month, but you're probably going to really
1847.32s: underperform over the course of a year because of how compounding returns work and how volatility
1852.84s: you got to pick your poison. So it's that kind of stuff.
1858.84s: Juicy bot says year zero stay in the black, get account to 10k. I think that's good. And if
1865.72s: getting your account to 10k comes largely from savings, then I like that goal a lot. I don't know
1872.04s: what your starting account number is. So I don't know what 10k would, what it would take to get there.
1878.20s: But again, like if you're starting with a $5,000 account, getting to 10k is crazy,
1883.00s: unless there's really good savings associated as double in your account. Even though it's not a big
1888.68s: dollar amount, that's still a really high percent return. And this is why balancing between using
1895.32s: percent returns and gross returns is really important because they both provide very, very
1900.52s: needed content or context. Sorry.
1907.24s: Juicy bot says started around three to four K. Yes, savings, both of that's perfect. That's good.
1911.64s: Because again, remember in the beginning savings is literally, it's literally your absolute
1919.72s: best friend like without a doubt. And I'll show you an example.
1929.48s: So I'm not going to waste your time with like a compound growth calculator and all that shit.
1933.56s: You guys have all seen that a million times. But let's say that we have a $5,000 account
1939.32s: and let's say that we save $500 per month. And let's say that we just, we just keep on saving
1945.48s: that $500 per month, no matter what. We just keep it going. So we can figure out
1956.04s: what this will grow into over time like this.
1964.04s: And we can see how significant that $500 is in the beginning. Notice how if I just plot this
1979.72s: loosely, what I want you to see is how this savings number is so high in the beginning.
1988.68s: If you save that $500 on that $5,000 account in your first month, that is equivalent to a 10% return
1996.44s: in that first freaking month. If you annualize that kind of performance, it's literally out of this
2006.28s: world. So for those that don't know what 10% monthly is,
2013.48s: 213.8%. That's the annualized return in this context. Now it will be diminishing returns,
2020.84s: right? Because now you're saving $500 and $5,500. But my point is the next month, guess what?
2026.84s: 9.1% return. Your savings in the beginning is so unbelievably important to growing your
2035.88s: account. That if you can stick with it, then you'll find yourself in an insanely better spot
2045.08s: than starting with a small account and then trying to just trade your way there.
2051.56s: For the first two years of your trading, if you take a look at what the return is on a monthly
2058.20s: basis, it's still over 3% a month. Again, let me show you what 3% is monthly.
2066.44s: Annualized. It's a 42.6% return. Nobody, you're not better than that. I'm not better than that. Nobody
2074.68s: is better than that. And I don't mean that you can't beat that. That's not what I mean. What I
2078.92s: mean is anybody that's sound of mind would say 42% year, whatever that is, I'm interested.
2087.40s: I'm absolutely interested. Regardless, now this entire scenario changes. And I want to show you
2095.96s: how it changes. Now let's say you have a $500,000 account. I think that's 50.
2110.52s: And we're using the same 50 bucks. It doesn't really matter. We do the same thing over here.
2117.08s: What do you guys notice about the return on a monthly basis?
2126.84s: You're return collapses on this saving. This is still fine. You're still getting 0.1%. But again,
2137.56s: if we annualize 0.1% per month, it's a 1.2% return. Literally nobody cares.
2147.96s: So this is why in the beginning, your savings rate is with out of doubt your most powerful tool
2156.52s: because you have access to this, which is awesome. And then as you have a developed account,
2164.84s: your actual return amount as a percentage then starts to take hold in terms of what you're able
2172.76s: to produce. Because again, let's say that you're able to produce 20% over the course of a year.
2185.08s: If you take a look at what you can yield from that, I'm just showing you how to do the math.
2193.40s: I think, well, I imagine most of you know how to do this math, but nonetheless, I will show you.
2203.08s: You make your $100,000.
2212.76s: $100,000 again, regardless of where you're at financially, is still enough. Like that moves the
2219.72s: needle. Even if you're a deck of millionaire, you still care about 100K. There's nobody that doesn't
2225.88s: care about 100K. It means different things. For some people, that can be life changing money.
2233.40s: Once you develop money, that becomes the equivalent of like $500,000,
2240.28s: $1,000, something like that, depending on how much money you have. Like what quote-unquote moves
2244.20s: the needle for you will scale as your total resources scale. But this is still a lot of money
2249.72s: no matter who you are or where you're at. If we take the same scenario,
2253.80s: and we apply it here, you get $1,000. I mean, $1,000 is still $1,000. Same return, same 20% return.
2276.12s: So what I'm showing you is that finding a balance between focusing on percentages and raw
2286.92s: dollars is in your best interest. Because in the beginning, savings is literally your super power.
2297.32s: After and this is why in this phase, we're not worried about trying to take your trading account
2306.20s: and turn it into your future wealth. At this point, you are building the skill, the process.
2313.24s: Like we talked about, you're building this background so that you can achieve this kind of return
2320.36s: when you have this kind of money because then this is a meaningful amount of money at that point.
2327.48s: Again, $1,000 is meaningful to everybody. $1,000, that genuinely does start to become negligible.
2334.76s: Obviously, you still care about it, but it's a much lower threshold, especially if you have
2339.80s: a lot of money in to put this into context. Let's say that you end up with $5 million.
2350.44s: Take a look at the difference in scale of what percentage your wealth this constitutes.
2367.96s: When you have $5 million, this $1,000 represents 0.02%.
2375.88s: When you have $5 million, this $100,000 counts as 2%. That's still a decent amount of money.
2384.04s: So it's all scale and context that you have to be mindful of. But the most important thing to pay
2390.68s: attention to here is the relationship between percent returns and gross returns. Because this return
2398.76s: is absolutely incredible. If you can maintain a 20% return, it's absolutely incredible.
2408.36s: In the beginning, it's completely underwhelming. $1,000. But again, if you can continue this,
2416.84s: when you build your money, this becomes a meaningful amount of money. I think I've made that point
2423.56s: pretty clear at this stage. It's such an important point that, again, if you have any questions
2429.48s: on this, please tell me it's worth the conversation. This is part of setting up realistic and healthy
2437.00s: good initial expectations for you. This goes back to setting good goals. If you have bad goals,
2442.52s: the probability of this working out for you is very low. Straight up. I get to open door for Thor.
2453.56s: Okay. Point made. I presume. So next, let me get caught up on the chat real fast.
2467.56s: I'm going to take my drugs.
2481.00s: Trading or option says buying and selling shares based on weekly charts. It looks like you're
2485.08s: just talking about your approach. This is cool. Trading option says so I'm trying to
2493.24s: average the S&P 500 if it's more than better. Oh, I see. Yeah. So even that kind of goal,
2502.12s: you have to be more specific. Because if you're saying something like I'm trying to average the S&P 500,
2507.64s: the question that you genuinely have to ask yourself as a trader is like, why trade?
2512.12s: If the goal is to do what the S&P 500 is doing, just buy the S&P 500, decrease your cost,
2518.12s: and then get with the S&P 500 returns, right? There's nothing wrong with that.
2525.00s: For a lot of people, it's a great choice. And I'm not saying that's what you actually want,
2529.00s: but what I'm saying is that's why it's important to like fully define your goals.
2535.32s: James says I'm trying to get to the point of positive expected return. That's good. But again,
2540.04s: I would define what positive expected return means. Because if you segment your return,
2547.72s: you might have a three month period where your expected return is negative. But then you might
2552.52s: have an annual period where it's not and it's positive, right? So you can do stuff like that,
2559.88s: but that's why being really specific is super important.
2566.52s: Arielle says, wish my dad wasn't making me pay $500 for a parental student loan. So I could save
2577.40s: it instead. What is a parental student loan? parental parental parental student loan. What is that?
2591.00s: Lone taken out by a parent to help pay for the child education?
2599.80s: Oh, so like it's for your education? I already paid my portion of it. This is a parent plus,
2606.68s: which is in his name. I sent him a money. I want to pay off the high interest ones,
2612.04s: but he doesn't understand interest percent always maxed credit cards. That,
2617.80s: well, that sounds just like a general mess from like an underlying starting point to be
2625.32s: completely honest with you. Because like if you guys weren't on the same page with taking out
2631.72s: student loans or whatever, that's a giant mess. I mean, my reality is I was not going to take
2637.80s: out student loans. My original game plan was to just enlist in the Marine Corps, like my brother did.
2643.16s: But I had a high school teacher that talked me into going the officer route and trying for
2650.04s: the scholarship. But without that, there was no chance that I was going to go.
2658.28s: Lauren says I'd assume he's paying his dad back for loans. Yeah, I mean, I definitely think you
2662.92s: should pay for your own loans. That's without an out. Like you should absolutely pay for your own
2667.72s: shit. But if there was like a, if there was a difference between the original expectations,
2676.68s: that's problematic for sure. Okay. I think we're clear on this point. Let us continue.
2685.24s: So we already talked about this. We talked about this. Let's talk about this.
2689.16s: So there's a couple of things that I want to discuss now for the sake of this session.
2697.96s: Plus we need, we need, we need a place to play. We need some drawing space.
2707.00s: Lauren says I don't have a goal and I don't do well without goals. I have to reassess. Yeah,
2712.04s: definitely. It's the starting point. If you do not begin with the end in mind, that's from Steven
2717.40s: Covey or the Marine Corps version of that is reverse plan. The probability of you landing where
2722.84s: you want to land is so low. It's like literally unbelievable. It's Han's solo solo.
2728.84s: It's a terrible joke. But I thought it was kind of fun to say.
2734.28s: But I completely agree with you. You absolutely need to reassess because that is the first step
2740.68s: in this journey is to set goals. Without goals, it's all random behavior because you have no idea
2747.24s: how to do anything. And what I mean by that is if you're a call, when we're talking about managing
2752.60s: a portfolio, what's one of the first things we talked about? We talked about figuring out how much
2758.20s: risk I need to have on figuring out answering the questions like how many trades should I have on?
2764.60s: And it shouldn't be like, oh, I should have five trades on. The fuck does five trades mean?
2769.64s: It's completely random. So the way that we add clarity and structure around this is by starting
2780.20s: with a goal because then we can say, okay, if I have my annual goal, I can break that down into
2785.40s: monthly targets based on that monthly target. I can assess how much risk I need to have out at a
2789.64s: given point in time based on the expected return of the individual trades that I have on. That's
2794.04s: beautiful part about options. I can tell you at the onset of the trade, what is the probability of
2799.08s: the various profit potential scenarios occurring? And again, if we want to refresh of that, tell me,
2803.64s: and we can literally run through it. It's not difficult. But that process is how you
2810.68s: cleanly determine what should be on when and how much, but all of that is driven by your original
2817.56s: goals that you set. So in my opinion, that is the absolute first thing before you do any of this
2825.56s: other stuff is build those goals. Cool.
2829.16s: Joe says, Han Solo Solo, how's the first time I heard it? Probably because it's really dumb.
2836.92s: I, yeah, it's a silly thing to say, but it's kind of fun.
2842.20s: All right. So now let's talk about really this series of things that you see here,
2850.92s: sustaining your work, optimizing, and then integrating these components. So I'm actually going to take
2857.64s: this, put it on this slide. We'll squish all this down. Let we can talk about it.
2882.28s: Great.
2887.72s: So the first thing that we need to discuss is this idea of building a sustainable approach.
2897.00s: This is the same thing that goes into building a sustainable approach for anything for you. So
2906.20s: I'm going to talk to you from a moment from my own lens. This is like a selfish way to frame this
2912.20s: versus me taking the time to like try to consider your lens more, but it's easier for me to frame
2917.48s: it from my lens and then see what you can draw from it. So when I think about sustainment,
2927.24s: we'll start down down here.
2933.56s: There's a few things that I know I need. I need structure.
2939.32s: I need a process. I need to build it into a habit.
2953.64s: So let's talk about these individually really quick.
2956.84s: Structure is me fitting the entire context of what I'm doing into one spot.
2964.28s: So when I think about the structure of your approach as a trader, it really is this here.
2971.24s: This more or less is the structure that's going into this. It's kind of
2978.20s: identifying what we need to do to make money and then how we plan to execute that. That's
2983.72s: the structure. So we've already built that in the prior sessions.
2988.44s: The process is really important because I've already defined a few processes for you.
2996.68s: There's the outlier strategy process. There's the outlier trade process.
3001.64s: These are two examples of defined sub-process within this structure.
3008.76s: So this is the way that my brain looks at it. And the reason why my brain works this way
3014.44s: is because it allows me to be consistent in detail in what I'm doing if I'm not reinventing what
3022.04s: I'm trying to do each time I'm doing it. So for example, the four steps that go into the outlier
3029.08s: strategy process and trade process, it's the same. For any strategy that I'm exploring or building,
3034.76s: I'm going to apply that same process, that same rough outline. Now the details will be different.
3040.44s: Same thing when I'm doing something like scanning.
3046.28s: Or even a daily rhythm.
3055.48s: This process building this cadence of a regular way of doing things, it really lowers the threshold
3064.84s: that you have to get over in order to do it. So if you're thinking about the process of
3069.72s: building a strategy, it can be really overwhelming. So if you're thinking about
3081.64s: what goes into building a strategy, if you try to think about the problem that's not in an organized
3089.16s: manner, you're going to miss things. And you're probably going to say things like,
3093.64s: well, I don't want to do that part because that's a lot of work. Or what I'm doing now is good
3098.92s: enough. You'll come up with all these different things because it's the same saying that you've
3104.68s: heard how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time. It's the same kind of idea. If you look at the
3108.52s: whole elephant, you get overwhelmed. So by building these different process, not only do you build a
3113.88s: repeatable pattern, but you make big, complex things much more palatable to work through.
3120.20s: It's not a section. It's not like a problem set of like, how do I build this entire
3125.00s: positively expecting strategy that does everything that I want? Right? That's a big problem to solve.
3132.92s: But again, if you refer back to the Outlier Strategy process, the very first thing that you do
3137.48s: is think of a profit mechanism and analyze it. That's it. That's your homework. That's your entire
3142.52s: focus when you're trying to build a trading process. The first step is to think of the profit
3146.68s: mechanism. The homework could affect and analyze it. That's it. That's your homework. That's all
3151.40s: you have to focus on. You don't have to worry about anything else. You don't have to worry about
3154.68s: sizing. You don't have to worry about your stops. You don't have to worry about how often you should
3158.28s: trade it. You don't have to worry about how many times none of that matters yet. You focus on that one
3162.04s: thing. And if you can continue to focus on the one thing at each stage in the process,
3169.96s: the output is something that's pretty robust. So this process nature is really important to me. It's
3177.24s: what I do for everything. From weightlifting, I have a very specific periodization and process
3183.88s: that I follow. Like literally everything I do. And it's because it's more efficient and you'll
3189.72s: get a better result. So when I'm trying to think about a sustainable approach, I view this section
3198.44s: as an investment because the cool part is once you build an effective process, guess what?
3209.48s: It's there. The effective process is consistent. It's there. So you don't have to reinvent the process,
3219.08s: building it, building the infrastructure at first can be a little difficult. But once it's there,
3225.40s: it's there. You can tweak it over time and stuff. But my point is is that you now have something
3230.20s: you can reliably use and modify it as you go. But it's not doing the entire thing over and over
3237.80s: again in a novel way. The last thing for me, and this is like a big like me ism is habit. I consider
3248.52s: myself the most disciplined, undisciplined person on earth. And what I mean by that is I have to
3258.36s: barter with myself all the time to do things, to not do things that I want or don't want to do.
3266.60s: And through that, you get used to it. And then it becomes less and less and less of a mental
3275.80s: hurdle to get over each time. A great example of this is a trade log.
3284.52s: If you build a trade log that has 62 inputs,
3293.96s: the probability of you filling that in is not super great. But there's value in making yourself do it.
3304.04s: So what I would do with something like a trade log is I would sit down and I would say for this
3311.16s: strategy, what variables are important to me? For this strategy, I would list them all out. One,
3322.76s: two, three, so on. And then when I got to the end of what I think is relevant to it, I would build
3331.48s: that into a log. And let's say that it's 50 inputs because I don't know what matters yet.
3341.72s: What I would tell myself is I don't have to do 50 inputs forever. I need to do 50 inputs until I
3350.28s: can see a clear defined trend in the usefulness of the inputs. So here's a great example.
3361.80s: If I'm trading something like zero DTEs in SPX,
3370.12s: do I think the 10-day MA matters? If I'm being honest in the beginning, I don't know. I don't know.
3378.44s: So I track it. But then as I put on 200 of these, and I noticed that the correlation of 10-day MA
3388.44s: to outcome, to severity is very low. And I analyze the robustness of the feature through something
3396.68s: like random forest or something like that. Then I can confidently say I don't need this anymore.
3404.20s: So then what I do is I start with however many inputs I think matter. And I tell myself until I get
3412.04s: a data sample large enough, I'm going to do this. And then once I get a data sample that shows me
3417.80s: clear trends, then I am willing to update what I track and maybe get rid of the 10-day MA.
3425.88s: And whatever else doesn't necessarily matter. I'm making an agreement with myself.
3430.84s: Because I know how my brain works. If I look at this and I say, fuck, I don't want to do 50 inputs
3436.04s: forever on this thing. That's really annoying. So then I'm going to quit right in the beginning.
3440.76s: I might do it once or twice because I'm excited. I think it's going to be cool. And then after a
3444.28s: while it's like, damn, like I'm not near the computer. And then that happens a couple days. And then
3449.72s: I have a backlog. And then I have a big problem. So I'm making agreement with myself. And I literally
3458.76s: say do it for X period of time. And it depends on the strategy. How many samples I need.
3465.16s: And if I adhere to that, then I can adjust it. And I know I'm not cheating myself. I know I'm not
3469.64s: being lazy. I know that I've taken a look at this thing and I can confidently say this does or
3475.00s: does not matter. That's what I do here. So this in my opinion is all part and parcel to building
3483.40s: a sustainable approach. Because if you get burnt out and you stop doing things, if you start cutting
3489.00s: corners, none of this will work. So you have to find something that's repeatable to you. And
3494.68s: that's why the consistency element is on this list. Because if it's not consistent,
3499.80s: it's not really going to work for you longer term. Because then you do not have that
3504.12s: precious feedback loop. That feedback loop is what will eventually make money for you.
3511.72s: All right. The next thing to talk about here is building resilience. This idea of resilience
3518.68s: really comes down to what I would consider exposure therapy.
3525.32s: So this is things like it's why I insist when we talk about rolling a trade. I insist on
3536.84s: somebody being able to say I booked a loss. I insist on that. If somebody can't say that,
3543.80s: we have a problem. We have loss aversion and we need to get over that.
3549.08s: Or another thing I would find with myself sometimes where if I took a trade off,
3553.32s: that was a small loss, I wouldn't want to log it. It's a small loss. It doesn't really matter.
3559.40s: I just want to put it in the data. But then if I take a look, the small wins are sure shit in there.
3566.44s: Loss aversion. So resilience comes from forcing you to look at markets as what they are and accepting
3575.16s: them. This is why you'll find traders that have been around for a long time really don't have a
3580.04s: problem with being wrong. They might some of them might like being right more than others.
3585.40s: That might be a more valuable component to different traders. But all of them won't have a problem
3589.80s: with being wrong. And it's because guess what? You're exposed to it long enough. You learn that
3595.00s: this is part of the trade is what it is dog. Accept it. Same thing with scaling. This one's
3603.56s: difficult at least for people like me because I'm risk averse. I definitely know that from my
3609.24s: underlying starting point with markets and scaling was always difficult. So let's say that I put
3617.08s: on a one lot and let's say that the P&L variation on a daily basis is like 50 bucks.
3624.04s: If I look at that long enough, I become desensitized to that P&L variation of 50 bucks.
3630.52s: But if I jump to a five lot and now I have P&L variation of 250 bucks, I become uneasy. I'm
3638.52s: concerned. I start second guessing things. Is this a new path? It does the strategy not work anymore.
3645.32s: So on and so forth. So I set myself up for failure. The times where this was happened is when I was
3651.72s: too focused on the profit potential, not enough on the risk side of the equation. And then when I
3657.24s: start seeing some of the risk, I get nervous, I get shaken out that kind of stuff. So the solution here
3662.20s: for me was exposure therapy. It's literally going from a one lot to a two lot.
3668.60s: So now when I see the $100 movement, I assess how I feel. If I feel a little bit off about it,
3676.04s: I remind myself this is sized appropriately. This is less than a percent total risk.
3682.36s: I'm fine. It's just a new number. Get used to the number. And then the same thing. So then as your
3688.44s: account goes from 50k to 100k. And in order to keep the same size, let's say this was like whatever
3695.88s: 0.5% of the total account, I'm obviously not checking the math. But in order to keep the same
3701.32s: half point exposure, again, if we go from 50 to 100, this would have to double. But that can be
3708.68s: uncomfortable. So I don't immediately make the double. I'll go to three. See how I feel at 150,
3716.36s: look at 150, see how it behaves at 150 in terms of the P and R range.
3722.92s: And then I'll scale this way, exposure therapy, same thing for anything else.
3727.00s: The same way that you build muscle in the gym, it's literally exposed with therapy. So this I
3732.28s: think is really important to get behind in terms of building a sustainable approach is avoiding
3738.52s: Goldilocks analysis, focusing on the outputs that are the outcomes that you want and putting on
3743.08s: trades that are missized. Work your way up. Next, great example, literally absolutely fantastic
3752.76s: example for those that are OGs in the chat that have been around since I started the channel literally
3760.20s: just over five years ago, the channel launched on four May 2020. When I talked about the coverage
3766.92s: triangle, what was the ticker you would have heard me talk about? For the people that have found
3774.60s: the channel in the last six months, if I talk about the coverage triangle, what ticker do I talk
3781.16s: about? Recent James, I see two OGs. For somebody that found the channel recently.
3790.84s: There you go. Jordan says, I bit TQs, the stuff that I'm in. What do you notice? It changed.
3801.16s: Why did it change? This markets are dynamic. There was a time period where I WM was far
3811.96s: superior for my use case for a litany of reasons. It performed well by your vault, so on and so forth.
3823.32s: However, what's happened in the last five years? We've had a massive shift where large cap tech
3834.20s: is grossly outperforming. Things like Bitcoin is grossly outperforming. So this is where
3841.80s: I embrace the dynamic nature of markets. I can always tell an immature trader when I see somebody,
3852.12s: and it honestly doesn't happen with you guys too much, which is good, but I see it happen in
3856.92s: other communities where they'll say to somebody, they'll say something like, but you said blank.
3863.16s: And the problem with the, but you said is you are lingering at something that was said at a
3871.24s: point in time relevant to that point in time and shit changes. So for example, if somebody told
3878.36s: you whenever the market goes down, I'm going to rotate into gold or even better, whenever the market
3884.20s: goes down, I'm going to rotate into bonds. For a long time, for a really long time, that would
3891.80s: have worked. But guess what? If you blindly followed that in the last few years, you would have had
3897.32s: your face ripped off. If you cannot accept the fact that you have to be dynamic, this is not for you.
3904.84s: So embrace that fact because with that dynamic nature, more opportunities emerge.
3912.28s: Great example. If you think about SPX, it used to have only opX.
3921.96s: Third Friday. Then all of a sudden, it has weaklies.
3929.64s: Then all of a sudden, it has mid weeks. Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
3935.40s: Then all of a sudden in May of 22, it now is daily.
3941.32s: This is a dynamic change that's fantastic because now this is where an entire strategy has been
3954.92s: born. Zero DTEs. Zero DTEs did not exist before this because you couldn't trade them on a weekly
3963.24s: basis. That's not enough occurrences. So you get a chance to get something with way more repetitions.
3971.16s: It's a beautiful part, an absolutely beautiful part about the evolution of markets. You got to
3976.68s: embrace it. I bet another great example. We're in a new Bitcoin ETF. That's in the portfolio already.
3985.00s: Why? Because it's a great way to trade a strategy that I like in a new product that makes sense.
3992.52s: So learning to look at changing markets and not have your feet stuck in concrete is very,
3999.56s: very important. Very, very important. If you can't do that, you get left behind.
4004.76s: So you have to learn to monitor what's going on and be open to changes, which leads beautifully
4013.80s: into the last topic here, developing wealth. One of the things that I tell people is a W2 is super
4022.84s: risky. Not only are you directly trading time for money, but you are one bad period away from
4039.08s: not having this one bad time. We saw this during COVID. What happened during COVID? Tons of people
4048.76s: got laid off. It's not because the companies are evil and they don't want you. It's that the
4053.64s: company has to do with the company has to do in order to fucking survive. This you literally serve
4061.72s: at will. So the problem here is that you can't scale in a lot of W2 jobs. If you're in sales or
4071.88s: something you can scale, meaning to a certain degree, but literally nothing is the scalability
4080.44s: of markets. With the click of a button, I can go from a one lot to a ten lot. I can 10X my size
4089.00s: literally by clicking a button. If I'm in sales, I can't 10X my calls per hour once I get it
4098.28s: fully optimized. There's only so much time you can put into calls into that hour. It's going to
4103.80s: take time. It's the same thing if you work a standard W2 job. You're going to run into a threshold
4110.92s: at some point where you cannot scale it anymore because of this equation. That's a beautiful thing
4121.32s: about markets is that with the click of a button, I can scale at will to whatever I want.
4129.96s: That's huge. Now, the next thing to keep in mind is that as I mentioned, markets change.
4137.72s: I am a firm believer in what I call, I don't call it the wealth triangle, but I call it the three
4144.36s: levers of wealth. This somewhere in here, be towards the beginning, this.
4155.96s: Three levers of wealth. The idea is to focus on your savings rate, start investing, build an income.
4163.88s: This immediately, this coupling of investing in income is really solid. It's because you now
4170.68s: are building robustness for yourself. This is why I structure myself the way that I do
4179.56s: is for the sake of robustness. It's because I give myself staying power. You guys have seen in
4187.80s: the Discord, I show you different places that I make money from and how I make money from it.
4193.16s: People will say, Eric, why do you get into this other thing if you're good at trading? I am good
4199.40s: at trading and I actually have investments and other things that underperform what I do as a
4204.04s: trader. Once you have a decent size pie, meaning amount of money, you want to make sure that
4214.12s: I don't know what's going to happen with markets and I'm not going to pretend that I do. I think
4218.52s: they'll be here. I think options trading will still be a thing 20 years from now, but I don't know.
4225.80s: So I'm building robustness in the approach and it's something to consider. Once you get scaled
4232.04s: to a point that you can start breaking off different amounts of money and putting it into other
4236.92s: kinds of assets is something to consider. For me, it started really simple. It started with
4242.36s: residential real estate. Well, this is when I was more developed because all the way back in college,
4246.44s: I started with things like hard money lending, angel investing, flipping stuff, all that kind of
4252.04s: shit. But then as I scaled, I started getting into real estate and actually getting into more
4257.40s: structured angel investing. And then I started getting into different kinds of real estate, commercial
4262.44s: real estate, all of these other kinds of asset classes that perform very differently, but there's
4268.92s: a place for them. And it's because sometimes there will be ebb and flow between them. But regardless,
4279.72s: no matter what, we will see some sort of return, again, ideally, that will scale with us.
4288.68s: So it's something else to consider when we're talking about this just outlier options trading
4295.00s: approach is although the developing wealth conversation that we just had doesn't really
4299.48s: pertain to options. It pertains to you as the options trader and your ability to build money.
4305.24s: So let me see first and foremost, do you guys have any questions whatsoever?
4314.68s: Bramins says, what's the purpose? We already talked about that. So I can't tell if you just don't
4336.52s: like the answer or what, but we talked about that one actually a couple times. So I think we've
4342.52s: successfully discussed that one. Are there any questions on anything that we've talked about
4352.92s: so far?
4358.36s: Setting a good foundation via a good landscape analysis and creating an orientation
4365.16s: to building your approach, to creating steps, to actually enact that approach,
4371.00s: to then executing the approach that you framed, how to manage a portfolio,
4376.68s: how to build a sustainable approach to this path as a trader. Now, if all of that has resonated
4383.64s: well and you don't have any questions, just let me know. And in the meantime, I want to talk about
4392.92s: this thing that we refer to, why I refer to us as outliers and what this means.
4403.88s: Bramins says, I missed it. Oh, you just asked that. I think on the video a couple days ago,
4407.88s: didn't you? Because I answered it in that live stream. That would have been on Wednesday.
4413.72s: So yeah, whenever, if you check out that live stream, whenever,
4422.36s: whenever you asked it last, I talked about it because you asked this one before. So yeah, I think
4427.16s: it would have been in the one's day live stream. So the reason why I call it outlier trading,
4435.88s: and the reason why I call our community and you outlier and outliers is there's a couple
4444.12s: different ways in my opinion to be an outlier and they complement one another. The first one
4451.72s: is here. When you think about the actual mindset that needs to be embraced, this is the first step.
4461.72s: This is accessible to everybody right now starting today. You can be an outlier by adopting
4466.36s: a different mindset right out of the gate. Then there's the outcome. But this precedes this
4477.96s: every single time. You have to have this, which is why I call us outliers. It's literally to give
4485.80s: you your own subconscious queuing for your brain. That's exactly why I do it. And it's because I've
4496.52s: told you this story before, but it is something I deeply believe in. And it's back in like middle
4501.48s: school. I forgot what grade junior high or some shit like that, where I used to tell myself I'm
4508.60s: bad at math. I'm bad at math. And I always struggled in math for some reason. Yet I one day I
4518.12s: literally just said to myself, I'm just going to stop saying it. That's it. I literally just told
4523.08s: myself I'm going to stop saying it. And then all of a sudden I started, I was never great at math.
4529.24s: Maybe I didn't become like a fucking math genius, but I was fine. I absolutely did fine. I was in
4533.80s: all honors. Everything was fine. So the point is I'm literally using our community as a vector to
4541.72s: queue your mind to try and start that subconscious adoption to a different mindset. That's why. So you
4551.48s: literally can become an outlier literally today, today by adopting a different mindset.
4564.28s: So what is this mindset that I'm spending so much time harping on and talking about?
4570.12s: Well, let's think about it. First, let's think about what the normal
4578.52s: normal, crater, embodies, most are lazy, most want immediate gratification,
4593.80s: most want really high returns, most want to be able to achieve this with low risk,
4610.52s: most want to not have to spend a lot of time. And so on and so forth. So we can see
4623.88s: what normal looks like. And we know what the output of normal is in markets because I literally have
4632.84s: this again on the website so that everybody can see because I think taking the reality of trading
4640.68s: for what it is, right? So if you go under resources and you go to do traders make money, I literally give
4645.80s: you specific specific studies. This isn't like my opinion. These are actual facts from peer-reviewed
4654.68s: research for you to look at on your own. But the reality is most that start trading, wash out
4664.28s: within five years, 7% will proceed past that. So 93% gone five years.
4671.48s: For a large majority over that time frame, they will underperform the market on average by six
4682.52s: and a half points. A really dangerous thing is of that 7% that continues beyond the five year mark,
4695.16s: a minority of those are still underperforming the market. They don't outperform the market. They
4702.20s: just keep doing it. This is the reality. This is what normal is. And this is why you need to do
4715.16s: other things. You need to adopt a different approach. So this is the same, what I'm showing you
4723.40s: is the same thing that I always do. Notice how the beginning of the series starts with an orientation,
4729.80s: a landscape analysis. That's what I'm giving you literally in adopting an outlier mindset. I'm
4735.40s: giving you a landscape analysis here. So now what do you guys think? What are some of the behaviors
4749.80s: that you would imagine in outlier in trading in bodies? Let me see what you guys think.
4761.24s: And in the meantime, you already know, gotta pop the door for the old boy.
4778.92s: What do you guys think? Think of the specific habits, behaviors that serves as an antithesis
4799.64s: to what I just showed you, what normal is. I literally showed you exactly what normal looks like.
4809.64s: Whenssac
4817.40s: What's that that works?
4825.24s: Oh yeah,
4838.84s: I'm just coordinating with my visit and friends.
4849.36s: Jared says beginning with the end in mind, I literally couldn't agree with that more.
4853.92s: So notice how when we started this whole thing, we talked about setting realistic goals.
4866.84s: And reverse engineer.
4871.20s: Why?
4872.20s: Because again, this back checks literally all of this in one in one swoop.
4884.96s: One fell swoop.
4887.36s: You get all of this.
4889.80s: So I literally couldn't agree with that more.
4891.64s: That's probably one of the best first possible stops that you could begin with.
4897.88s: J. T. Erick says consistent discipline and focus.
4903.36s: You can't get better at something that you don't spend time on.
4907.72s: So if you don't make a conscious decision to actively scale, then this will not work.
4918.72s: So I think that that's absolutely massive.
4926.24s: With out of doubt.
4932.76s: What else do we think?
4934.64s: There's a couple other things that I would integrate into this.
4943.40s: Something like if you don't take the time to actually learn about markets and to learn
4955.36s: about something like options before you start trading them, it's as simple as that is.
4964.00s: The majority of people that start trading options spend far too little time actually understanding
4969.24s: how they work.
4971.16s: And then they're surprised that they lose money.
4973.28s: Now again, I don't disagree with the Tom Sawznaf approach of just take a small account
4980.40s: and start doing things that you know aren't going to hurt you.
4983.16s: Vertical spreads are in condors.
4984.88s: It's not what I would do, but I think that's fine.
4988.48s: But the point is that person is starting that process from the point of placing those
4993.08s: trades simply to learn.
4995.72s: They're not placing those trades trying to make a bunch of money.
4998.28s: They're trying to see how things work.
5001.76s: So I think spending the time to learn as dumb as that is is probably one of the greatest
5012.96s: differentiators for an option trader.
5015.48s: It's crazy to say, but that is exactly it.
5020.32s: And I've given you guys literally a syllabus that I think is good, that I think makes sense.
5028.44s: That's available for everybody.
5029.44s: It's on the website.
5030.44s: It's called the All-R trading guide or some shit like that.
5034.08s: You look at that whenever you want.
5036.16s: But the cool part is if you take the time to actually learn about options, then all of
5040.76s: this other ship becomes so much easier.
5042.56s: You actually start to realize that having the quote unquote best strategy really doesn't
5046.72s: matter.
5047.72s: You start to identify all these other things that you spend so much worthless time on because
5052.48s: you don't know any better.
5054.68s: And it's actually a big corner to turn in my opinion.
5060.24s: So I think those are like three super, super simple first steps on how you can change
5071.60s: what I would consider to be an outlier mindset.
5074.92s: So are there any questions on what we've talked about?
5081.04s: Are there any elements that we went through that you're not sure of anything like that?
5089.20s: I want to make sure that we have a chance to hit everything.
5096.12s: And the meantime, I'm getting my dinner order ready.
5106.20s: Lauren says no excuse for laziness over here.
5108.84s: That's right.
5109.84s: Nobody cares.
5110.84s: Laziness is literally unacceptable.
5114.28s: It will never work in markets.
5117.56s: You don't necessarily have to be completely obsessed like I am, but you absolutely do need
5124.20s: to integrate some of what you're doing on like a realistic basis, meaning if some of what
5132.80s: you're doing is just selling covered calls, that's great.
5135.48s: But it means that there's a really good chance you're not going to outperform the market
5139.20s: in that context.
5140.20s: It's exactly for that reason.
5144.24s: So you can find things that generally fit in with your expectations and what you're trying
5150.76s: to do.
5151.76s: But again, you have to analyze things objectively and take it for what it is.
5156.88s: Braimes says, is it better to buy Jamie stock or play options?
5160.68s: This is a great question.
5161.84s: And it's so funny because it literally shows a misunderstanding of literally what we're
5167.48s: talking about right now.
5168.68s: And I don't mean that to poke at you.
5171.08s: But I mean, it's like such a great example.
5174.48s: And oh, weird.
5183.12s: So again, let's go back to see if we can answer that question.
5196.68s: Is it better to buy Jamie stock or to play options?
5201.76s: Well, you guys already know exactly how we would answer that.
5206.68s: We have to start first by defining what is better.
5216.52s: What are we trying to do?
5219.52s: One from there, we have to take a look at what our skill set is because I know for me
5227.32s: what the answer is, for me, it's a blend without a doubt.
5231.32s: I wouldn't do just one or the other.
5234.68s: But for somebody else, it may or may not be because it's going to be individualized and
5239.44s: it's going to be based on the skill set.
5242.32s: So the important part though, and the point that I want to drive home is this, define.
5248.88s: What's the goal?
5250.76s: What is what does better mean in the context of that goal?
5255.32s: And then from there, you can work down a logical flow, hopefully to, you know, find that.
5261.00s: Arrive at something that is satisfactory for you.
5263.92s: But that's exactly how I think about it.
5265.32s: I would start with defining that.
5267.24s: And then you can determine what makes the most sense.
5273.36s: Brimis says, I suppose in my opinion, if it's one wanted to invest rather than gamble
5278.20s: on the ticker, let's completely different.
5282.36s: You're talking about that is that's irrelevant to GameStop.
5286.36s: What you're doing there is you're saying one of them is investing, which I assume you
5289.40s: mean buying stock.
5290.40s: And then you're essentially saying that if you trade options, you're gambling.
5294.60s: And fun story on that.
5295.92s: I literally have a video that I released not that long ago.
5300.80s: No, that's a lie.
5302.80s: It's not out yet.
5304.04s: I have a video that's coming out towards the end of the month that talks about the exact
5308.96s: discussion of is options trading just gambling.
5312.92s: Now that part aside, really what this is, I think, it's a reflection of the way that
5325.20s: we think about it.
5326.80s: Brimis says longer term, I mean, but you can go longer term with options.
5330.80s: Again, this is why understanding the products is so important.
5338.52s: I can buy options in GameStop that are 945 days out quite a while over two years.
5351.04s: And then I can roll those if I want.
5354.60s: I can move them further and further to maintain the position.
5358.76s: So again, this is exactly why going through these steps are so important, right?
5368.68s: Making sure maybe we'll do, we'll add a step here.
5376.60s: I think that's actually a worthy add in to like decisively learn about markets and options.
5396.84s: Because if you do this, then we might be able to solve for some of this stuff.
5404.44s: So yeah, and that's kind of like the fun exercise, right?
5407.84s: It comes down to again, what the goal is and then how might we get to a point where we
5414.28s: hit that goal?
5416.08s: Now the last thing that I want to hit on before we wrap up is I want to talk a little bit
5422.44s: about the reality of this thing because I think for a lot of people, you might see where
5428.52s: I'm at now after doing this for a long time.
5432.44s: And it is a completely unfair comparison for really anybody.
5441.80s: And it's because everybody has their own little world that they're operating in.
5447.56s: And it's not like this shit just magically all came to me and all worked at the same time.
5455.40s: It's just not true.
5457.32s: So because of that, I think if you accept the fact and give yourself some grace to learn
5468.44s: to make mistakes, we all make mistakes.
5472.56s: I make mistakes to this day in trading.
5476.04s: It will never fully go away.
5477.36s: There's always little things.
5479.28s: But if you give yourself a little bit of wiggle room and you don't for me, at least what
5483.36s: I would do is beat myself up quite a lot if I made a mistake.
5487.20s: And there's a point of diminishing returns.
5490.64s: So I think embracing the fact that it's something that's learned over time is really, really
5497.04s: important.
5498.04s: So don't hold yourself to some sort of crazy standard that you aspire to and think that
5504.24s: you're going to hit it out of the gate.
5505.44s: Because it's really, really difficult to do that.
5507.52s: And then you kind of set yourself up for failure, I think.
5510.60s: If that's how you evaluate yourself, whereas you might be doing really, really well,
5514.92s: but it just might not be exactly to what you're wanting to do at that point.
5519.16s: But give yourself a little bit of grace as long as you're continuing to learn, I think
5526.24s: you're already well on the way.
5528.24s: What I would do is literally set up a cadence where every week, maybe on Friday, I would
5533.20s: do like a weekly quiz in chat UBT.
5536.84s: And I would start with a general topic that I wanted to teach me.
5542.20s: And then the questions that I got wrong on the next quiz, I would ask it to ask me similar
5549.04s: style of questions for this topic that I got wrong until I get it right.
5554.68s: And that's exactly what I would do.
5556.64s: So keep that in mind, please, because this stuff is doable, even if it looks a little
5563.88s: bit heavy up front.
5566.00s: As always, if you need anything, you can hit me up in the discord, be an outlier.
5569.60s: See you guys later.
