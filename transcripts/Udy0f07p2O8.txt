0.00s: Okay.
1.00s: Here from Alaska, I saw a lot going on in the market.
3.52s: I want to take a look at it with you guys and know, I am not an angel.
6.68s: This is just some light bleeding in from behind me because we are on the mobile setup via
12.00s: the laptop.
13.00s: So actually, first thing I want to play is, where's Walgo?
16.56s: If you can see where we are in this photo, let me know.
21.64s: And I'll give you the answer, but throw it in the comments if you can find us.
26.12s: And if you couldn't, we are right here.
28.32s: You can tell by this big shadow that's kind of casting out from where we're at.
33.52s: But the reason why this water is so blue, we've learned is because of stuff called rock
38.36s: flower, which is from glacial water, which is pretty neat.
42.00s: And then just a couple other photos really quick for you guys.
44.64s: Kind of like a preamble.
46.44s: I'll obviously share a lot more when I have a chance to pull it all down from the drone.
51.68s: But let's get over to the markets, Gally.
54.20s: I have a few things I want to talk about today.
56.20s: I want to talk about the indices writ large.
58.44s: Then I want to talk about where I'm still seeing strength.
61.40s: Then I want to talk a little bit about crowd strike and using it as a conversation for
66.40s: reversals, which was a question that I got from the out our community.
71.36s: And then I also at the end wanted to go look at GameStop because there were some really
75.04s: interesting options activity that occurred in the last couple days, specifically with
81.00s: some 125 puts.
82.72s: So we'll take a look at those.
84.36s: But first, looking at the indices, what's going on here?
87.04s: Well, as far as I can tell, it looks like the market is really in a mix up, but this
92.76s: is broadly what I'm expecting to see as a broad pullback.
97.84s: So if we look across the indices, we have the eminies, the NASDAQ, the Russell, these
101.64s: are the futures, but there it's essentially the same thing as what you'll see in spy,
106.80s: QQ and I don't know.
109.24s: So first things first, we're seeing a sell off across everything.
113.48s: Pretty clear, no duh, but the structure of the sell off is very different.
118.52s: And what I mean by that is if you take a look at something like the Russell, this is gone
122.48s: parabolic up, trended sideways and is now returned essentially going parabolic down.
128.96s: And it's almost back to where it started, which is kind of insane.
133.76s: And you can use small caps in this kind of setting is like a proxy for what's going on,
139.28s: what the market is thinking.
141.36s: And right now it's obviously thinking constrained specifically for smaller tap companies.
148.04s: And that's because of a slew of mixed economic data that we're getting in.
154.40s: So we're seeing still probability of a cut in the next meeting.
159.88s: And it's varying quite a lot because the market is starting to show signs of weakness.
164.84s: And because of that, you'll see small caps definitely taking the brunt of this.
170.08s: This is this original rise that you see here is when things were looking good and the
175.00s: market was expecting a cut.
177.24s: And then things started kind of chopping sideways for a little bit and then starting last
181.88s: week into this week, there's been a pretty meaningful contraction in small caps because
187.24s: of this.
188.24s: Now tech is a slightly different story in my opinion because you can see take a look
192.56s: at the slope of this pullback.
196.16s: Take a look at the slope of small caps pullback, right?
199.76s: So small caps essentially gave this all back up over the course of one, two, three days.
206.08s: It's just pure parabolic in nature.
209.16s: You'll see these kinds of moves when it has this kind of parabolic up move unless there's
213.84s: something that really maintains the momentum.
216.84s: And that's because there's not a lot of support and resistance built into price when it moves
221.88s: like this.
222.88s: This is an insane movement.
224.96s: So that's part of the reason why you'll typically see something like this pattern in small
229.52s: caps is it did not build and consolidate on the way up.
234.00s: So on the way down it kind of follows suit, whereas something like tech, you can see it's
237.72s: definitely still drawing back no doubt, but it's a completely different structure.
243.36s: And the eminies, they're kind of somewhere in the middle.
246.20s: They definitely showed a healthy dose of weakness starting on the second.
250.68s: And then it's starting to level out a little bit more than what you're seeing in the
255.04s: NASDAQ.
256.32s: So all in all, pretty interesting price performance so far as far as I'm concerned.
262.12s: Now I want to take a look at a couple of things a little more closely.
266.36s: So let's grab a chart here and let's grab a spy.
269.56s: And right now I can't see where I'm at in OBS because I am on my laptops.
275.36s: I only have the same screen you guys are, but I'm guessing I'm covering up some stuff
278.92s: down here.
280.24s: But you'll have to take my word for it.
282.20s: Let me slide this up.
283.20s: Maybe you can see that.
284.20s: I don't know how much you guys will see this, but essentially I'm trying to show you the
287.86s: net highs and lows here.
289.92s: And we came to a point.
291.36s: This is looking in the NASDAQ where even up to the 31st, we still had pretty strong net
297.76s: highs lows.
298.76s: But you'll notice that it was still downward sloping.
301.32s: It wasn't at a point where it was fully consolidating.
304.64s: And the breath indicator really turned pretty heavy.
307.28s: And we saw this massive expansion in lows, gross lows happen on the fifth where we
315.12s: peaked out at negative 331 as compared to highs of 110.
323.20s: So this is a pretty big negative rotation over, but it's already starting to kind of
328.84s: mellow back out and coming back towards the zero line.
332.12s: So what I'm highlighting is that it's definitely a bit of a broad sell off here that we saw
336.72s: happen on the fifth, but it doesn't look like it's heavily sustained so far.
341.68s: And we're definitely dipping into this value area pretty heavily.
344.92s: As you can tell, the point of control in spy specifically is still like 512 513.
351.40s: So because of these kind of small details, the pullback that we see in my opinion is still
359.12s: generally in line with what I would expect to see for something that has had this kind
364.64s: of first six month move.
366.32s: It's just been a little bit aggressive, which I think is taking some people, I surprise,
371.32s: but it's at a point now where I definitely think you have to be careful with laying out
376.52s: risk.
377.52s: I definitely am.
378.52s: I'm being very cautious with how much capital I'm offering the market right now, which
382.76s: funny enough, I've already made the joke a couple times where it seems like whenever
386.04s: I'm going up on a trip, the market decides to sell off a few people in the discord and
390.24s: highlighted that too, which is just kind of comical.
392.36s: So my portfolio just naturally happens to be pretty light right now, but I'm still trading.
397.36s: I was trading zeros today and those were actually really, really successful.
400.88s: This is one of my favorite periods of time to trade zeros or really any type of variance
408.00s: risk premium style plays and it's for this exact reason, right?
411.84s: Like we can see, Val is just so that offers a really big opportunity.
418.44s: Now you have to understand that the way that these cards were is you're making a forecast
424.04s: on what does it look like essentially tomorrow.
426.88s: So what I'm highlighting is because realize this so high over implied doesn't inherently
433.20s: mean that where you're at right now is an in opportune time, something like this where
438.32s: it's trending above definitely more in opportune.
442.72s: But with this kind of really large movement, a bit of positive momentum, taking a look at
447.36s: the intraday charts and spy didn't look quite too terrible.
451.24s: So it looked a little bit interesting to me.
453.28s: So now I want to take a quick look what we have coming up on the week and you can see
459.80s: a few things.
461.52s: So if I grab this week's data and we take a look kind of like from a broad perspective,
471.44s: we had PMI come in pretty light.
474.04s: It was expected at 56 came in at 55.
476.92s: The composite PMI also came in light.
479.16s: It was expected at 55 came at 54 or 3.
482.52s: So again, we're just seeing some level of weakness and the market is overwhelmingly going
490.00s: to react violently to this.
492.00s: And it's because of where we're at in the current cycle.
495.32s: And you'd better believe that any sort of future economic data that releases is going to
502.28s: be looked at with an absolute, it's going to be looked at with a microscope.
506.60s: Because the market is now starting to get a little bit jittery with where we're at.
511.04s: So on the seventh, we have one that I'm interested in.
514.60s: I don't think the market's going to care that much about but consumer credit.
517.24s: I really want to see that.
519.00s: And then on the eighth, jobless claims are going to be a big deal.
521.92s: There's no doubt have to keep an eye on jobless claims.
524.48s: If that starts moving to aggressively outline of expectations, I think the market will
529.24s: kind of have a freak out about that.
531.76s: So it's something else that I'm keeping in on.
534.08s: Right.
535.08s: Let's take a look at CrowdStrike.
537.44s: And specifically, I want to look at this idea of trading reversals because one of the
543.20s: questions was it looks like CrowdStrike was starting to base out.
546.96s: What do we think about potentially trading this for a reversal play?
550.04s: And like I've been talking to you guys about this trade for a while because I had been
554.00s: trading it to the downside via ratio, put diagonals.
557.48s: And then I ended up getting out just naturally before the trip, funny enough, which happened
563.12s: to be really good timing on the trade.
565.04s: But I would have just kind of followed it otherwise using just stops.
570.40s: But I would have no problem trading this to the upside.
573.76s: The tricky part here though is that the rest of the market isn't to accommodating.
578.60s: So what I mean by that is if I'm trading some sort of price, mean reversion play like
582.12s: this, it is absolutely snapped all the way out like a rubber band super, super far out
588.32s: of line in my opinion.
590.32s: And when I see this kind of price behavior, it does interest me to the upside, especially
594.64s: with this follow through day that I had now, typically speaking, what I would do is essentially
600.44s: look to enter if we come down, we base below this and then you break above in this case,
606.24s: it's the 222 handle, then essentially trading that using the 222 handles to stop, but it's
611.72s: a super speculative play.
613.12s: The probability of getting stopped out is really strong.
615.72s: Now the other thing that's even more important in this context is what the broader market is
619.24s: doing that does not have big market wind at its back, meaning tech is doing really
624.04s: well.
625.04s: But it's also important to remember that for CrowdStrike specifically, this move was entirely
629.00s: precipitated by an impact only to window systems, less than 1% of the total systems in its
637.24s: network.
638.24s: So even though like it's impactful, right, like there was a lot of issues caused by it,
645.04s: it's not like this crazy thing that's going to, in my opinion, completely cause CrowdStrike
649.60s: to go under or anything like that.
652.12s: This just looks like a visceral reaction.
654.32s: And again, this is a really well known phenomenon in the stock market.
658.08s: This is price in discreetness, meaning information is not priced in super well and it causes
663.36s: these kinds of movements.
665.12s: Now as far as the reversal, like I said, that's an interesting play here.
669.00s: It doesn't have the broader wind at its back, which is something that I do consider.
673.56s: But when I look at the options chain for something that's fallen down so far, take a look
676.96s: at this.
677.96s: It is 344,000 calls against 328,000 puts.
683.56s: So it literally already has calls skew in terms of OI for something that is literally
688.68s: in freefall.
689.96s: So what this tells me is the market is starting to play the upside.
693.32s: And you can see this also the volume, just the number of transactions today, 78,900 calls
699.68s: transacted against 51,000 puts.
703.12s: So again, people in the options markets are trading this to the upside in a pretty clear
708.84s: way.
709.84s: So if we look at the overall call volume today, 27% were at the offer or above.
715.24s: So those are people that are buying calls.
716.96s: And only 16% were at the bit or below in terms of selling.
720.28s: So yeah, in my opinion, what we're seeing are people buying calls, we see people selling
724.68s: puts.
725.68s: If this were me, that is the initial way that I would play it only because the broad market
730.92s: is not wind at its back.
733.40s: If we had tech still doing really well, I would have no problem playing this with something
737.92s: like a ratio call diagonal.
739.44s: I like this kind of place for these larger expected reversion.
743.64s: But again, with the way that the broad market is behaving, I don't necessarily love that.
748.44s: And to me, it looks like first stop in terms of price level would be something around
752.00s: there, 261.
753.64s: If it can get above even this small congestion zone.
756.76s: So this would be the first hurdle to get over in my opinion.
759.60s: And then this would be the next spot that I would be looking at.
761.80s: It's just because there's a big volume node sticking up.
765.16s: So yeah, that's kind of two things wrapped up in a one looking at crowd strike specifically.
769.20s: But then also this idea of trading in reversion place.
772.36s: It's catching off all in knife.
773.96s: You want to wait for a little bit of strength generally speaking again, my approach.
778.16s: But then you have to be kind of careful and have really strong expectations of getting
782.28s: stopped out.
783.28s: There's absolutely really, really high probability of happening.
786.68s: All right.
787.68s: Let's get over to everybody's favorite.
791.32s: Game stop.
792.84s: So what's going on in here?
794.40s: A few things.
795.68s: First, I am really happy to see it literally came down to this 18 handle that I had drawn
801.84s: for a long time ago talking about where I saw essentially the next node of volume.
808.64s: And it essentially hung out right by it and started bouncing up a little bit, which
812.92s: is great to see.
814.56s: Now, I still don't love that this is a lower low.
817.60s: And the other thing that I don't love is just the volume.
820.68s: It's an emek.
821.84s: There's so light volume.
823.48s: Now, it's great that there's a pretty large percentage of by volume that's fantastic.
828.80s: But the problem here is it's not necessarily doing a lot.
834.24s: It's good that this is starting to break up above this handle.
837.44s: This 2021 handle that's huge.
840.72s: But it's not doing it on a lot of volume.
843.12s: So there's not a copious amount of participation going on here.
847.64s: And I think it's important to flag that for people.
850.36s: And it's because with this kind of movement, any sort of strong volume can absolutely
856.96s: start to move this thing because there's such light volume in it, as it says.
862.60s: So let's take a look at the options, chain really quick.
865.12s: And then I want to take a look more specifically at some of those bigger plays that we saw.
869.88s: So right now there's 683,000 calls against 365,000 puts.
875.84s: So this is getting still better, moving closer to the two to one ratio calls to puts.
880.96s: And again, that's just what I typically see more in a bullish configuration.
884.28s: The other thing that you'll find different than what we've typically seen as of late with
888.48s: GameStop is take a look at where the larger volume for calls is.
892.80s: It's not in the front expiration.
894.68s: It's in the next expiration, this 16 of that's where all these blue boxes are.
899.68s: So I've already highlighted this rotation for a while now.
903.36s: I can see it happening essentially real time.
905.92s: But what that implies to me is that this expiration cycle doesn't look like a lot of spiciness
911.48s: is happening.
912.88s: I see 91,000 calls against 39,000 puts.
916.16s: And then in 16,237,000 calls to 100,000 puts.
921.08s: So you can see the we're doing what I would expect to happen, meaning playing the next
926.04s: primary expiration cycle.
928.00s: Now we still see some slightly elevated implied ball in the front.
932.84s: And then in 16, it's down to 105.
935.68s: But overall still, if we move this to the out of the money combined, yeah, that's a really
941.52s: jagged profile.
943.68s: You can see that on the call side, meaning to the upside for the 16, the out of the money
950.20s: calls, they're priced a little bit rich compared to the puts on a relative basis compared
955.64s: to some of these other expiration cycles.
957.96s: So again, what that tells me is just pricing in potential upside moves, which for something
963.92s: like game stop, you have to do because you literally just do not know when it's time
968.64s: for it to make that kind of jump.
970.80s: So what I want to do now is take a quick look at some of these thicker strikes, specifically
977.52s: these 125s I'm assuming, yep, out in 16 aug, there's 39,000 of those now.
984.04s: So if we grab all of these strikes, we go out to these 125s, take a look at that.
990.88s: That's very different.
992.80s: So over yesterday to today, 6,000 of these were closed in terms of net ad net subtract,
1002.04s: 6,000 of these contracts accident, which is actually really interesting.
1006.60s: And 2,000 of them traded today, I would be very interested to see if this continues
1010.88s: to be closing volume versus exposing new grade volume because I'm actually seeing a lot
1018.16s: of general closing volume here, even in the 16 aug expiration cycle, which is kind of interesting.
1023.64s: Now here, the 25s are getting super active still with 21,000 OI with 6,000 volume today,
1031.52s: and then same thing with these 23s, they're fairly busy.
1035.16s: The 20s are holding pretty steady.
1039.04s: That's actually really interesting to me.
1040.84s: There's 10,000 OI, negative 6, so almost pure balance between yesterday's volume with
1047.84s: 37,000 transacted today.
1049.48s: That's probably some people taking, I'm guessing, a little bit of profits on the upside move
1054.68s: here to unwind where they can.
1058.16s: And let's take a quick look, actually we're going to use unusual whales for time and sales.
1062.32s: So let me take a quick look through this to see if anything jumps out.
1065.52s: I haven't looked at this yet.
1067.24s: I just want to see if anything looks really interesting.
1070.92s: So 16 aug, 30 aug, 9 aug.
1073.28s: So it's a lot of the front explorations I'm seeing.
1075.92s: And there's a healthy mix.
1077.40s: So I'm seeing a healthy mix of the mid points between bid-ask and I'm seeing sales and
1084.16s: buys kind of a little bit of everything.
1086.72s: So let's take a quick look at unusual whales.
1089.80s: And I think we'll be able to see a couple things here.
1094.08s: So let me slide that out of the way really quick, put that back.
1099.04s: And so this is looking at contracts traded from the fifth and this is just the last two
1103.48s: days calls inputs.
1105.72s: And there's one thing that jumped out of me, which is this series right here, which we're
1110.12s: going to talk about.
1111.44s: Now up at the top, the other thing I want to highlight is that there was a 278,000 dollar
1117.72s: trade in the 20 set, 22 puts at the author.
1123.88s: So there's still people buying downside movements here.
1128.68s: And you can see it in a pretty big size.
1131.32s: Most of the transactions that you see of these larger sizes, right?
1134.32s: So I typically will use like a hundred thousand as the cutoff.
1136.88s: So think right here, all of these essentially were puts with a block here for 127,000
1145.16s: dollars at the 16 Jan 26, which we're also seeing now.
1150.12s: A lot of these build out in these further explorations, which is interesting.
1153.64s: Let's take a look at these.
1155.04s: We have a series.
1156.68s: This is clearly one person because you could take a look at the execution times.
1160.36s: They're all right around one another, they're all the same size.
1163.68s: So I would absolutely feel pretty confident saying that this is overwhelmingly likely to
1168.40s: be the same person.
1170.68s: And it's all the 125s out in 16 Jan 26.
1174.20s: They're at the bid.
1175.40s: So that means that we're selling puts.
1178.44s: And this is an interesting amount of capital.
1182.60s: Because if you take a look, this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
1187.72s: nine blocks.
1188.72s: So it's essentially a million dollars of sold premium.
1194.48s: And this is generally a bullish trade.
1197.80s: You want it to go up.
1199.68s: Now if we take a look at modeling this trade so you can see exactly what this looks like.
1205.64s: So if we go out here to the 16 Jan 26 is.
1212.16s: And we go out here to the 125s.
1213.96s: Let's sell these really quick.
1215.72s: We grab those analyze that trade, pop into the risk profile so that you can see what it
1221.86s: looks like.
1224.00s: So you can see that essentially all the way out to expiration.
1230.04s: I mean, this is just a wild, wild position.
1234.64s: It does have quite a bit of downside risk.
1238.92s: But because GameStop is so low already, it's quite limiting.
1243.88s: And if we pop back over just to see how many total transactions, it's 90 contracts.
1250.40s: So let's take a look at this at size.
1255.12s: And I wouldn't be surprised if it's 100 if there's another 10 and there somewhere just
1258.44s: because that would be more natural human being.
1262.48s: See if I can find those really cool.
1264.00s: I'm just curious.
1265.00s: The 125s.
1266.00s: There they are right there.
1268.72s: So there's another 20 actually.
1272.44s: And these are both at 100 and 5000.
1275.36s: And were there any more that came through?
1278.00s: Let me recap.
1279.00s: That's 1, 2, 3, 4.
1282.40s: That's 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
1286.40s: Interesting.
1287.40s: I wouldn't expect 11.
1288.40s: It's kind of just a strange size.
1290.92s: Here we go.
1291.92s: Here's a couple more.
1292.92s: 12.
1293.92s: Right.
1294.92s: So we have two blocks of 5.
1297.64s: 12.
1298.64s: That kind of a more natural number, I would say.
1301.60s: So let's take a look at what this would look like at 100 and 400.
1310.60s: So in the near term, I mean, this is essentially behaving just like long stock.
1316.04s: You can see that the total downside for this trade is like $200,000.
1321.04s: Nothing catastrophic.
1323.28s: And on a daily basis, they are going to collect some premium.
1326.20s: Now the interesting thing here is they're just not going to collect that much, which I
1330.96s: can't help but find interesting.
1333.48s: So if I look at the theta that they would get on this on a daily basis at the dollar.
1339.88s: So it's just not a lot of money to sell things that far in the money.
1343.40s: So this could be some sort of cover put position.
1346.80s: So it's kind of the inverse of selling deep in the money cover calls.
1350.72s: You can do that essentially on the put side, which is maybe what this is looking like to
1355.52s: me.
1356.52s: It's hard to tell because you're not selling these to collect a bunch of premium.
1360.44s: Even if you get a massive move, right?
1362.60s: Like let's say they're expecting by selling these puts and they want it to go above 125.
1366.88s: If you think it's going to go to above 125 in this sense, you would make so much more money
1371.44s: using calls.
1372.76s: So the fact that they're not doing that leads me to believe that this is part of some sort
1378.04s: of cover put scenario.
1380.44s: I just can't totally see what the other side of this trade is or what the purpose is, but
1386.04s: it's likely being used to offset something else.
1389.28s: That's not guys.
1390.80s: So quick update on the markets as always.
1394.12s: If you guys need anything, let me know.
1395.96s: Be an outlier.
1396.96s: You see guys there?
