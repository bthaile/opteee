0.72s: stop over emphasizing probability of
3.36s: profit it is an important part of a more
6.06s: important equation that most Traders
8.58s: don't pay attention to and it's
10.74s: unfortunate because you can have a very
13.50s: high probability of profit and still a
16.68s: losing strategy meaning as you deploy
18.96s: that strategy you're not making money
21.06s: even though you have a 90 win rate like
24.06s: a lot of people look for it is a way to
26.70s: satiate our egos we like high
29.46s: probabilities of profit we don't like
31.56s: being wrong who doesn't like a good old
33.42s: winning trade the problem is there's
35.70s: more to this story than just that one
37.92s: piece of the broader equation that is
40.14s: expectancy or expected returns which I'm
42.78s: going to walk you through now I want to
45.00s: explain what they are how you can use
46.86s: them as a Trader how to create an Excel
49.02s: tracker for it and then how to
50.46s: interpolate the results so that you can
52.32s: optimize a strategy and make more money
54.48s: out there what's up everybody Eric here
56.10s: welcome back to all the outliers let's
57.54s: talk about expectancy like I said pop is
60.66s: popular look at me go over here with my
63.18s: jokes it's part of the puzzle and you
65.46s: can see this parabolic rise in
68.16s: probability of profit it's actually
69.54s: comical but the issue with it is it only
73.08s: gives us a small piece of the broader
75.54s: more important puzzle which is
77.54s: expectancy expectancy includes probably
80.94s: profit it's one of the variables we need
83.34s: to input into the formula but let's talk
86.04s: very quickly about expectancy this is
89.10s: from statistics it doesn't just apply to
91.14s: trading it applies to anything really
93.12s: and we just modify it slightly for
95.52s: trading and it quantifies performance
98.04s: it's a way for us to codify the output
101.58s: of a system and see how that system will
104.70s: continue to perform into the future so
107.88s: that's where we get these two different
109.44s: views historic and implied we can see
111.96s: how a system performed or we can look
114.78s: forward and see how a system will
116.64s: perform going forward and both of those
119.76s: are really important pieces to this so
121.80s: what is the fabled equation how crazy is
125.04s: it as you could tell it's unbelievably
127.68s: easy very simple we're going to take our
130.14s: win rate as a percentage times the
132.96s: average win we're going to add the loss
135.48s: rate times the average loss
137.88s: that's it there it is
140.52s: there's nothing to it but for whatever
142.98s: reason people aren't taking this step
145.14s: they're looking at probability of profit
146.76s: they're thinking that's good enough and
148.92s: they're forgetting the rest of this
150.78s: equation and let me show you why this is
152.34s: so important here I have a 100 Trade
155.10s: sample system and we have 85 winning
158.40s: trades 15 losing trades so an 85 win
161.58s: rate our average win is 30 our average
164.64s: loss is 170 and let's take a look at the
167.58s: expectancy here what is that number to
169.80s: you because to me it's zero it means
172.44s: that you've won 85 percent of the time
174.90s: but because of the rest of the variables
177.06s: in this equation you make nothing
178.86s: actually you would lose money once you
180.66s: add in commissions and whatnot so this
183.18s: is my point you can have a really strong
186.42s: win rate but if you do not have a grasp
190.02s: on expected profit you could literally
192.54s: just be losing money
194.10s: now where do we get this information
195.96s: where do we get our winning trades our
198.24s: losing trades you get it from your
200.40s: trading log that you have right that's
203.58s: tracking the performance of what you
205.56s: have written down in your trading plan
208.08s: which you surely have
210.66s: right
212.52s: you get my point here without those two
215.04s: pieces a trading plan and a trading log
217.14s: one without a trading plan you're not
219.54s: even taking responsibility for what
221.10s: happens you're just slinging trades and
223.20s: hoping something works out the bigger
225.12s: problem with that is what are you going
226.62s: to optimize that's the next part of this
228.66s: video is I'm going to walk you through
229.98s: how to build this very quickly and then
231.96s: teach you how to optimize it but if
234.24s: you're not gonna if you don't have an
236.16s: existing system to optimize there's
238.32s: nothing to optimize so the very first
240.30s: thing is down in the video description
242.04s: below I'm going to throw a link to a
244.74s: video on trading plans and trading logs
246.78s: that will walk you through how to create
248.46s: them the reason why it's so important is
250.62s: because as I talk about adjusting and
253.20s: optimizing these strategies we have to
255.36s: understand the impact that it will have
257.64s: so for example let's say we change this
260.76s: system just a little bit and our average
263.04s: win goes from thirty dollars to thirty
265.80s: five dollars what just happened here
268.56s: well we now have a positively expectant
272.52s: strategy but is it that simple it might
276.18s: be that simple it might not be and what
278.46s: I mean by that is typically
281.10s: when we have an average win or an
283.44s: average loss and we start playing with
285.18s: those numbers typically these numbers
288.12s: will change the number of wins and the
291.06s: number of losses so it's important for
293.52s: us to be able to look at our trading
296.10s: plan in our trading log and say okay if
299.28s: instead of taking these down at 30
300.72s: profits I let them run to 35 profits
303.48s: maybe you just haven't thought to do
306.00s: that before and you were just being
307.68s: super wasteful and that's an easy win
309.66s: and none of this changes that would be
311.88s: great what's more likely to be the case
314.46s: as you have an optimized strategy and
316.92s: we're clawing our way to optimize just a
319.98s: little bit further is as we let this win
322.68s: rate run a little bit then we're going
325.02s: to start to see maybe some more losing
327.12s: traits and that's important for us to
329.64s: calculate because then we need to
331.14s: understand the trade-off if we start
333.36s: raising our win rate by five dollars and
335.82s: we only add two more losing trades are
338.94s: we profitable this calculator will show
341.28s: you that so there's a few broad Concepts
344.88s: I want to share right now I run my
347.40s: expected
348.78s: um expected return by strategy this is
351.90s: how I've been so successful this year in
354.48s: 2022 when the Market's down 18 to 20
357.48s: percent most of the year I'm walking out
359.88s: at a tidy profit and it's because of
361.98s: this because I was looking at systems
363.96s: that worked in applying those and the
366.72s: systems that weren't working I wasn't
368.70s: using them anymore it allows me to
371.34s: rotate into what's working for the
373.44s: individual Market environments so
376.32s: let's talk really quickly how to build
378.72s: this and then I will walk you through
380.52s: how to optimize it so winning trades
383.34s: losing trades again this should be
384.96s: pulled directly from your trading log
386.40s: which hopefully you sincerely do have if
388.98s: not they're easy enough to build but
391.02s: this is where we're getting this very
393.48s: first figure your win rate and your loss
397.98s: rate we're going to take winning trades
399.96s: losing trades that gives us our total
401.94s: trades then to figure out your win
403.56s: probability you're just going to take
405.30s: your winning trades divided by your
407.64s: total trades and then for your losing
410.28s: trade probability you're going to take
412.26s: your losing trades the number divide
414.12s: that by your total trades that's how you
415.68s: get these percentages if you wanted you
417.60s: could just take 100 subtract it by this
419.64s: same same but the point being that's how
422.04s: you get those two figures then the
424.08s: average when an average loss again this
426.06s: is when having a trade log becomes super
427.50s: handy I have it auto calculate in Excel
429.72s: for me but if you don't you go through
432.06s: these 100 trades you put them in Excel
434.82s: or whatever tool you want to use or if
437.64s: you want to do it by hand which I don't
438.96s: recommend because it's very error prone
440.58s: but then you figure out of the winning
443.16s: trades what was the average win size of
446.52s: the losing trades what is the average
448.76s: loss once you have that you can make
451.86s: this right here expectancy done
454.56s: that's all there is to it now the
456.36s: expectancy ratio just turns this into
459.36s: division as compared to addition that's
461.94s: it it just gives you another way to look
464.04s: at the same information and then the r
465.84s: multiple this is just telling us what is
469.08s: our profit divided by risk what is our
472.56s: risk multiple that's what our multiple
474.36s: is and you could view that a lot of
476.22s: different ways I'm not going to go into
477.30s: that into this video it's less important
478.98s: really what I want to highlight here is
480.42s: expectancy
481.56s: not even expected ratio don't worry
483.30s: about that just worry about expectancy
484.68s: right now what we want is this number to
487.08s: be as high as possible we want expected
489.24s: to go up up up so in this case by
491.94s: letting our winds run a little bit more
493.68s: our expectancy went up by four dollars
496.50s: essentially so that means that as you
498.42s: run this system this is what you can
500.34s: expect to make now a couple things per
503.40s: trade by the way now a couple things to
505.86s: think about as we're creating these kind
508.38s: of structures
510.00s: the historic looking data is one thing
512.76s: the implied looking data is slightly
514.80s: different you can imply how systems will
517.98s: work going forward you can just increase
520.92s: these sample sizes based on the
522.60s: percentages of that specific strategy
524.16s: that you're running you can say okay on
526.86s: average I trade this this many times and
528.90s: if I dump more trades into this so
532.14s: instead of using 85 and 15 you already
534.96s: know your win and loss probabilities
536.70s: you've just thrown a bigger number and
537.96s: you're saying if I continue doing the
539.34s: same exact thing this is what I'll get
541.50s: so it's a really useful way to forecast
544.20s: things out but you have to remain
546.48s: sensitive to changes because it's a
549.12s: forecast the underlying circumstances
551.58s: will vary a little bit or a lot a bit
553.68s: and that can really impact this so it's
555.84s: important to continually update these as
557.82s: you go along so you have the best
559.32s: picture available
560.64s: last thing let's talk about optimizing
562.62s: this as you look at this sort of layout
565.68s: and we're using expectancy as our
567.30s: primary lens we have a couple levers we
569.28s: can pull we can either total trades or
572.34s: overall I don't necessarily worry about
574.62s: that too much the first lever we can
576.78s: pull is how many winning and losing
578.40s: trades we have there's different ways we
580.02s: can pull that lever but that directly
582.06s: impacts your win probability and your
583.80s: loss probability the other lever you can
586.44s: pull is your average win size and your
588.90s: average loss size so let's talk about
591.00s: all these very quickly if you want to
592.86s: increase your win probability who
594.30s: doesn't that's when we go through our
595.98s: trading plan we figure out the best time
597.84s: to deploy specific strategy and we
599.64s: deploy that strategy in the best
601.38s: environment we can find maybe this is
603.84s: timing your trades better if you're a
605.58s: day trader maybe this is being more
607.86s: selective when you are buying or selling
609.84s: strategies based on implied volatility
611.40s: percentile there's a lot that goes into
613.38s: increasing your win rate but that is the
615.36s: first and it'll be strategy dependent
617.04s: the first level we can pull try to win
619.02s: more trades next we be going to the risk
621.72s: management side of the equation meaning
623.46s: how are we treating profits and losses
625.50s: as you saw in this example I simply just
628.20s: said okay instead of taking profits at
630.18s: an average of 30 we'll take them at
632.10s: thirty five dollars see how that goes
634.50s: same thing for average losses we could
636.72s: try to decrease our average loss and
639.00s: there's a few ways to do this that's
640.20s: actually picking low-hanging fruit one
642.78s: of the easiest things you could do is
643.98s: look at your losses and it this is an
646.86s: average so there will be a an average of
650.16s: this average so that you can figure out
652.26s: okay where are the outliers where am I
654.66s: doing really well managing losses what
656.88s: are the losses that I'm just letting run
658.32s: real big maybe you see the scenarios
661.08s: where you had your two biggest losses
663.12s: and figure out what happened there and
665.34s: just see what happens to this average
666.78s: loss if you get rid of the biggest loss
669.90s: that you took on that strategy if you
671.94s: can codify that out that's an easy win
674.28s: and again it's the same thing for the
676.32s: average win if you're just too trigger
678.00s: happy and you're taking trades down too
679.80s: fast maybe you're just being too trigger
682.74s: happy and you could legitimately squeeze
684.84s: out another five dollars of profit by
687.30s: just waiting that could be the case some
690.24s: people are way too trigger happy which
692.04s: is a very common investor Trader trait
694.38s: so it could be that simple or it could
697.32s: be your average wins are falling down in
701.70s: a specific environment depending on
703.38s: whatever you're trading and you just
705.36s: stop trading in that environment and you
707.58s: pivot to something else this is how we
709.68s: can make data driven decisions about
712.44s: your strategy and to optimize it but
715.08s: notice how I keep referring back to this
717.60s: plan because if you say let's say for
720.84s: example there were two really big losing
722.88s: trades that skewed this average loss
725.04s: result pretty heavily you can modify
727.32s: that you could say okay I took this
729.30s: average loss because I held it through
730.98s: earnings going forward I'm not going to
733.92s: hold this trade through earnings and see
735.84s: how it goes that will likely have a
738.06s: pretty profound impact on the overall
739.62s: profitability of the system name of the
741.54s: game here ladies and gentlemen is
743.46s: expectancy forget probability of profit
745.74s: as a standalone metric it's important
747.60s: it's part of the this equation this is
749.76s: probability of profit win rate that's an
751.44s: important part of the equation however
753.36s: it is not the bell of the ball which I
755.76s: would argue is expectancy or expected
757.44s: return this is how we can see how
759.66s: strategies actually performed in
761.58s: different markets and then project that
763.08s: forward and make better trading
765.36s: decisions if you made it to the end
767.46s: don't forget to like the video subscribe
769.62s: to the channel see you all later be an
771.60s: outlier
