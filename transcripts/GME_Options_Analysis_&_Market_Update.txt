0.42s: [Music]
0.56s: bit of a hectic market today I want to
2.08s: talk through a couple broader Concepts
4.52s: on what I saw going on today to share
6.28s: with you all and then I want to take a
8.40s: look specifically at a handful of
10.36s: questions I got on GameStop as I'm
12.64s: always happy to look and share what I
15.40s: can see with you all so what happened
17.44s: today a couple things the major thing I
19.92s: noticed was this broad rotation in
22.96s: movement of capital because if we take a
25.92s: look across the primary indices the SPX
28.40s: literally gapped down that's not crazy
31.80s: but it's not common if you go back
33.40s: through this chart and you look for
34.92s: periods where this is over the last six
36.80s: months where it actually gapped down
38.56s: like this it's not super frequent that
41.80s: it makes those kinds of movements the
43.24s: SPX spy whichever you want to use it
46.04s: tends to be a little slower than that so
49.64s: we were at a just crazy high level the I
53.60s: wouldn't start freaking out when you see
56.56s: something come off a high and go into a
59.28s: consolidation that's a very normal
61.20s: behavior I feel like sometimes people
62.88s: get so used to things kind of going this
65.32s: parabolic up that we forget that there
67.68s: are other directions so that's one thing
70.64s: I saw the other thing I saw was when I
73.16s: look across technology using the NASDAQ
75.68s: as a proxy it took way more of the brunt
79.16s: and that's probably because Tech has
81.32s: been so focused on for so long that this
86.60s: is no surprise to me everything within
89.40s: Tech essentially needs to exceed
92.24s: extremely high expectations so this also
96.04s: looks like something that probably needs
98.08s: to consolidate in base for a little
100.00s: while in order to shake out the weekends
102.48s: get in some new money and to base
105.16s: appropriately for a solid foundation
107.40s: this to me doesn't look like okay Tech
110.56s: is falling off a cliff and everybody
113.28s: that has exposure Tech is screwed
115.16s: nothing like that but this does look
116.64s: like it is entering a consolidation
118.48s: period this is not an insignificant gap
120.80s: down I flattened out my tle Q's position
122.80s: today because it ran through a bunch of
124.56s: my zones and then the other thing I want
127.12s: to show is the
128.96s: Russell because it is showing relative
131.56s: strength so everything else gapped down
133.76s: today this did not it's partly because
137.08s: in my opinion the Russell is playing
138.92s: catchup it has been so lazy on the year
142.36s: compared to everything else until we
144.04s: started getting a change of rate cut
145.92s: environment things like that which sent
147.80s: it up and off into the mo
150.44s: to catch up so that's why in my opinion
153.32s: we're not necessarily seeing the kind of
155.76s: rotation across here all right so that's
158.08s: enough from a broad Market perspective I
160.24s: really want to talk about some of these
162.20s: gme updates because there's some
164.40s: interesting things going on with a down
167.60s: dat today crazy right so right now
170.76s: GameStop closed down 1.96% and after
174.40s: hours it's trading around 2760 is so
178.08s: about another 40 30 40 cents lower than
181.12s: where it sits right now this also looks
183.80s: normal to me it's not surprising to me
186.00s: at all to see GameStop come down today
188.20s: when the broad Market was down that's
190.08s: not to say gam stamp gam stamp GameStop
193.16s: couldn't go up because it can when the
196.36s: whole Market's down because I always
198.28s: Endeavor to remind everybody this it
200.04s: behaves differently what I mean by that
202.60s: is say for example you're looking at
204.60s: another sector let's say you're looking
205.96s: at the financial sector and you're
207.84s: looking at stuff like Wells Fargo City
210.72s: Group you're looking at Bank of America
214.16s: JP Morgan Morgan Stanley and if you look
216.92s: at that basket of stocks all five of
218.80s: them let's say financials are going down
220.76s: RIT large the probability of one of them
223.60s: being up when the rest of the basket is
225.96s: down is not impossible but it's pretty
228.44s: low that's not common at all it's the
231.00s: same thing for GameStop a rising tide
233.04s: lifts all boats and if we have a waning
236.36s: tide it tends to pull things down in
238.64s: Mass so there were segments of strength
242.00s: today but they were confined they was
244.36s: not strong across the board by any means
247.04s: obviously so to see GameStop come down a
249.48s: little bit today to me seems completely
250.88s: normal it's been on an up move
252.68s: essentially from the 1 of July it's just
254.96s: been moving up the other thing I want to
257.84s: highlight if we move in closer is that
261.68s: if you look at the S&P 500 it gapped
264.32s: down if you look at GameStop it didn't
266.68s: gap down it's essentially just an inside
268.56s: candle here relative to the the previous
270.28s: day so on a relative basis this is
273.04s: actually showing strength which is
275.00s: hilarious because how often would you
276.84s: consider finding strength and GameStop
279.52s: compared to the S&P 500 which today
282.60s: technically it was the other thing I
284.60s: noticed here is the volume we still have
287.60s: higher than average volume over the past
290.20s: two weeks most of it was sale volume but
293.36s: price didn't really crater that much
296.92s: that's telling to me because there was
298.84s: definitely selling pressure today but
301.04s: GameStop didn't capitulate to it and
303.60s: it's kind of hanging out here so this
306.20s: doesn't look bad to me at all this looks
308.56s: like it might be consolidating a little
310.40s: bit which again it's completely normal
312.48s: for products to go through these
313.64s: consolidation phases it's it's important
315.80s: for them to do that so there's that and
318.44s: I know that there was a lot of
319.40s: excitement today a couple people were
321.08s: asking me about the the thesis I guess
324.16s: there was some dude on Reddit somewhere
327.24s: that was referencing access to like a
329.08s: Bloomberg terminal as some sort of like
331.12s: Oracle of information and that today was
333.00s: supposed to be a big day let's break
335.56s: that down the first thing in trading is
338.08s: you're going to come across this all the
339.32s: time this appeal to Authority I know
341.64s: somebody that's a market maker I know
343.12s: somebody that's at a prop firm I know
344.84s: this I know that I have this tool I have
346.52s: that tool that's not to say you should
348.24s: ever dismiss those data points they're
349.96s: still viable data points but they're not
353.48s: necessarily the Arbiter of Truth or some
356.72s: sort of forcing function that's really
359.76s: unique to that scenario it's not never
362.56s: the case but it's rarely the case
364.36s: especially with something like GameStop
365.64s: the longer I look at this the more I
367.12s: find there's tons of people trying to
369.44s: make guesses about when we're going to
372.00s: see some sort of big move because it's
373.60s: fun right but the problem with that is
376.60s: you can come across a lot of really
378.96s: convincing arguments that just don't pan
381.64s: out because the market doesn't care the
383.32s: market doesn't care how good a
384.60s: hypothesis is to see these kinds of
386.96s: moves you need very specific conditions
389.16s: to merge and sometimes they're very
391.72s: difficult to pick up on ahead of time I
393.80s: definitely didn't top tick any of these
395.48s: I didn't get into this at 10: and out at
398.24s: 6483 it's super difficult to do that
400.52s: kind of stuff so what I would recommend
403.40s: to people is the digestion of
406.80s: information is good being open to
408.60s: information is good but coming out and
411.20s: then asking which I literally had people
413.68s: send me um different Snippets of I I
416.40s: didn't see the post but different
417.40s: Snippets about that post and there has
419.56s: asking if they should buy Super far out
421.92s: of the money short-term calls for this
423.80s: week predicated on that information
426.04s: which you probably already know my
427.12s: response to that I chuckle because it's
428.60s: hilarious I think like what a difficult
431.00s: way to make money in this business
432.56s: long-term doing something like that it's
434.52s: so low probability but I always go back
436.92s: to you got to do what's right for you
438.40s: but what I would encourage people to do
441.08s: is be receptive to information always be
443.84s: skeptical healthy skeptical meaning
446.52s: requiring a certain level of validation
448.48s: so for example Bloomberg terminals are
450.12s: really cool I've messed with them for a
451.28s: long time there's a lot of great data in
452.68s: there there's nothing magical in there
454.80s: there's no secret Edge that's baked into
457.32s: a Bloomberg terminal there's literally
459.36s: thousands of people that are on there
461.32s: every day looking for them so for
463.40s: example I know that they were
464.84s: referencing swaps you can see the swaps
466.96s: so we know that they're there it's not
470.00s: this insanely impactful Insider
472.80s: information that nobody knows it's
475.08s: somebody that's talking to the CEO that
477.48s: knows that there's going to be some sort
478.68s: of big acquisition it's nothing like
481.12s: that right it's it's still generally
482.68s: publicly available information yeah you
484.12s: have to pay for the Bloomberg terminal
485.48s: but anybody could get one if you're so
487.28s: inclin it's just like what 20 grand a
489.12s: year so all I'm going back to is be open
493.20s: to information be skeptical but to try
497.40s: and bet your life savings on these slew
501.56s: of different calls that we see coming
503.36s: out difficult to do you got to do what's
505.72s: right for you that's the the name and
507.36s: the nature of being a Trader but it just
509.56s: it just kills me that's why I'm
510.96s: obviously talking about it is because I
512.52s: I don't want to see people lighting
514.44s: money on fire chasing things and you
517.16s: know for some people this might be the
518.72s: last $55,000 that they can invest and
521.12s: then they're going to throw it in super
522.68s: far out of the money's YOLO for this
524.96s: week and it's like I just hate to see
526.76s: that I would love to see people taking a
528.64s: slightly more pragmatic approach to this
530.76s: to hopefully see some SE success in this
533.68s: long term because you you do get moves
535.36s: in GameStop GameStop does move that's
537.00s: one of the cool things about it it even
538.32s: moves now some some people are not
540.60s: missing or fully appreciating the fact
543.36s: and are missing the fact that from the
545.76s: 1st of July until yesterday is it's up
548.68s: like 20% that's in like two weeks that's
551.00s: a that's still a respectable move that's
553.96s: not
555.04s: insignificant so all of that to
558.20s: summarize is just be thoughtful pay
560.40s: attention to what makes sense for you
562.60s: digest information but always be careful
565.52s: about overweighting data from other
568.00s: people and be careful to to fall too
570.16s: quickly in line with appeals to
572.20s: Authority that can mislead your decision
575.80s: cycle I think that's where I would leave
577.68s: that so let's take a look now at the
580.08s: options we did see a big trade come
583.80s: through we have
585.68s: 3,000 of the 26th July 30 calls these
590.04s: came in closer to the bid so the market
593.36s: was 226 X 235 so it's a little closer to
596.64s: the bid side which would infer likely a
599.04s: SA
600.48s: my guess is these are some sort of
602.04s: covered calls that's my best guess here
604.48s: and this looks interesting to me but
607.40s: it's nothing to write home about
610.00s: because it's one now if we start seeing
613.44s: more of these coming in then you could
615.84s: make some guesses about who that could
617.84s: be but right now this is somebody that
621.48s: has probably a decent stock position
623.28s: that's selling shares or selling options
625.12s: against it and it's still a big stock
627.36s: position potentially
629.72s: but it's a little early to decipher too
632.52s: much other than the fact that this is
634.04s: something to be aware of that's the way
635.64s: I look at that kind of
637.24s: thing looking out at total volume today
640.24s: it was very high
642.52s: 312,000 calls against
646.16s: 67,000 puts very heavy call volume going
650.28s: on here the vast majority of it still is
654.04s: right in here at the 30s 19 July
657.60s: 2430s are on fire they're so active hey
663.20s: I sold a couple of those today so oh
665.80s: yeah I forgot to update you guys I
667.32s: typically don't like talking about my
668.48s: positions I don't want it to be about my
669.96s: positions it it does shouldn't matter to
671.84s: anybody I don't want to mislead
674.64s: anybody's conscious or subconscious
677.16s: processing based on what I'm doing but
679.12s: these are some short calls that I were
681.12s: able to move up from the
682.92s: 29s and the market being the market the
685.76s: Perpetual comedian that it always is it
688.04s: has this really interesting
689.92s: ability to make everybody wrong at the
691.44s: same time even if they have opposing
693.16s: positions and this my 29s were like in
695.96s: the money at the money and then as soon
697.68s: as I rolled them out here for a slight
699.60s: profit then we dropped below
702.40s: 28 perfect love that for me so sick but
707.08s: these are still just against both long
710.24s: options and long
712.28s: shares this is well I I'm part of this
715.80s: volume party today except my volume will
718.24s: actually decrease
719.96s: potentially well on this the 29's my
723.64s: volume will decrease the oi cuz I was
726.08s: closing my positions out but these are
728.68s: very active the 30s still have
732.24s: 77,500 oi with 48,000 transacted today
736.60s: that's a that's a really really busy
739.08s: really busy strike with 7,000 oi added
742.32s: net over yesterday so these are getting
744.76s: very active lots of interest in them
747.48s: volatility is up in the without a doubt
751.12s: 212% but right now that just looks like
754.76s: standard High GameStop volume that
757.20s: doesn't look like anything that I'm
760.16s: looking at as really anomalous here for
763.40s: the product it's anomalous in general
765.44s: compared to normal products I should say
767.68s: but for this so far it's not crazy we
771.36s: see the puts going off the shelf as they
774.64s: always do this is very normal and this
778.40s: doesn't surprise me it's grossly
780.44s: outrunning the calls though when we were
782.52s: seeing a lot more of that bullish V skew
785.32s: to the calls the calls literally were
787.16s: outpacing the puts but that's not what
789.68s: we're seeing now so the market is not
792.20s: heavily pricing andol on the call side
794.48s: it is pricing invol heavily on the put
797.12s: side so the last thing I want to talk
798.92s: about was another question I got about
800.44s: these spreads so people were talking
802.84s: about hey there was a bunch of you know
804.64s: puts that traded yesterday and there was
808.96s: but but these were seemingly part of
812.12s: spreads so that matters because it
814.76s: exhibits a little bit less conviction
817.76s: than had they been single trades the
820.04s: whole point of trading verticals is to
822.52s: decrease the sensitivity of the position
824.96s: and the positions that I saw got put on
827.12s: were really interesting it looked like a
829.20s: mix of 40s 45s and 50s so what I mean by
834.72s: that is if we take a look at these
836.52s: Series right you can see that there's a
837.92s: bunch of 30s came through at the 40 puts
842.48s: and then you can see that there's blocks
843.80s: of 15s that came through at the 45s so
847.88s: if I sort these by time you'll see a few
850.68s: things you'll see that a lot of these
853.56s: traded around one another near the same
856.28s: time as they were being filled the other
858.84s: thing is if you click these little
860.20s: arrows they're really useful here
861.64s: actually they help us identify things so
864.36s: for example I can see 15 of the 40 puts
868.44s: came through at the mid and then I can
870.16s: see 15 of the 45 puts came through at
873.16s: the bid at the same exact time at the
875.16s: same exact size that again tells me that
878.56s: these two are overwhelmingly likely tied
881.04s: to one another and it looks like a 40 45
883.92s: put spread and for these if the bid is
887.96s: at the 45 that means we're selling this
890.56s: one the 45 is the further in the money
892.64s: in this case and then we're buying the
894.92s: closer to the money we're buying the 40s
897.68s: so if you click this it'll show show you
899.32s: what it thinks it's tied to you can kind
901.20s: of Link the sizes pretty clearly and
904.44s: yeah so that's still a big position
906.84s: there was a ton of them that got hit but
909.76s: I don't think it's quite as exciting as
911.28s: some people thought it was based on you
913.76s: know somebody buying up the entire chain
916.20s: or selling the entire chain they're
918.24s: spreads but still if we take a look at
921.00s: the way that these look if you're long
923.28s: the 40s and you are short the 45s I'll
927.40s: model that trade for you
929.76s: looks a little bit like this so really
932.44s: it's a bullish trade it wants the
935.00s: underlying to go up but it needs to move
938.56s: in order for them to really start making
940.48s: money the positive to this is it does
944.52s: have downside risk protection there's a
947.40s: lot of things you can read into with a
948.96s: position like this it's very interesting
950.52s: to me because it's not the purest
953.08s: expression of an idea it's a sizable
955.12s: trade it's inefficient to trade them via
957.92s: vertical spreads as compared to single
959.56s: options and sizing down but you never
961.64s: know what's going on in the rest of the
963.80s: book you never know what else is going
966.24s: on what else this could serve to hedge
968.60s: it's you know difficult to tell but this
971.24s: is definitely a inform Trader you don't
973.60s: trade something at this size by happen
976.16s: stance by just slinging something so
978.12s: they there's an idea here but we just
980.44s: can't really fully look into it I just
982.76s: wanted to make sure everybody knows
984.08s: though that this isn't some sort of
986.48s: massive buying or selling of options
988.24s: it's actually both it's a vertical
989.84s: spread so that's that all right you guys
993.60s: so we have a couple days left into
996.12s: expiration and we are eagerly waiting to
999.80s: see what's going on here overall it
1003.00s: looks like the options positioning is
1005.84s: standard I would say meaning I'm not
1008.72s: seeing a bunch of super crazy volatility
1012.88s: but I'm also not seeing any I'm not
1015.00s: seeing crazy skew just yet so this looks
1018.40s: like a little bit of a let's see how it
1021.96s: goes scenarios so as always if you have
