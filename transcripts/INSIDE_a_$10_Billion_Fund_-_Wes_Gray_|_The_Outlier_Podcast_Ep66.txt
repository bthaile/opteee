2.56s: what's up everyone Eric here welcome
4.32s: back to the outlier podcast and I have
7.08s: my relatively new friend Wes here from
10.60s: alpha architect what's up Wes thanks for
12.40s: joining me hey you got it Eric
14.52s: appreciate being here so obviously I did
17.16s: a little bit of homework on your
18.52s: background and I realized that you
20.80s: decided to be a gross overachiever did a
23.44s: NBA PhD I'm just curious do you like how
26.00s: many letters do you have after your name
27.68s: at this point are we missing some
30.60s: I always just tell people I used to be
32.12s: really motivated when I was younger and
34.56s: I just for whatever reason kept grinding
36.96s: and did a bunch of [ __ ] but I'm a lot
39.24s: lazier now so uh you know that's in the
41.72s: past I'm I'm living on Legacy uh I'm I'm
44.80s: not I'm not that cool as like I used to
46.80s: be is what I would say so you really had
51.52s: a fascinating background I ended up
53.72s: catching one of your podcasts with I
56.12s: think our mutual friend um Michael GED
60.16s: and a lot of what you guys were talking
61.88s: about really resonated with me and
63.28s: literally as I was just talking to you a
65.20s: little bit before we started recording
67.16s: the way that you've gone about
68.84s: essentially your entire career and then
71.32s: entrance into Finance is kind of
73.28s: anomalous where you started education
76.64s: took a break went and B did the Marine
78.80s: Corps thing for a bit spent some time I
80.88s: think it was in Iraq
83.16s: advising and then y you came back and
86.24s: decided to do the big brain stuff can
89.44s: you just talk a little bit more about
92.68s: how that all molded into your entry into
96.12s: markets eventually because I think one
98.40s: of the things a lot of people from my
100.24s: audience may or may not understand is
101.88s: that a lot of people find their way into
103.96s: markets from all different kinds of
106.36s: crazy backgrounds and I think you
108.68s: represent that to a pretty pretty
110.48s: significant degree yes let me give you
113.48s: the nickel Tour on how the hell I ended
115.64s: up where I am right now right so this go
118.76s: so I grew up on a c Ranch in the middle
120.88s: of nowhere in the Colorado mountains and
122.68s: we were broke as [ __ ] right and when I
125.68s: was a kid I used to have to go hang out
127.68s: with Hae and work irrigation ditches
130.36s: flipping hay bells and like just doing
132.64s: all this manual labor and I hated it and
135.96s: I kept asking my dad I was like I don't
138.24s: want to do this for the rest of my life
140.08s: I'd rather have money you know because
142.60s: this sucks like it was just that blatant
145.40s: and he's like well you know he's he's a
147.24s: freaking Cowboy he doesn't know anything
148.96s: about Finance but I I had a grandmother
152.36s: who who actually lived in San Diego
154.00s: where your based who was into like this
155.92s: guy called Warren Buffett and and my
158.40s: dad's like hey you should go talk to
159.60s: Grandma Jenny because she's in investing
161.72s: and like knows all this stuff so I
163.40s: talked to her and she got me into the
165.60s: whole like Ben Graham Warren Buffett
167.36s: thing so I started literally when I was
169.32s: a kid like you know not not five at that
172.40s: time you know but probably like 10 or 12
174.72s: where I was like oh man this is really
176.40s: cool like you could take money and make
179.08s: more money and I don't have to do any
180.92s: work duh and so I just initially it was
184.44s: purely financially motivated to not be
186.92s: broke and it seemed like Finance was
189.92s: like a good way to do that like I can't
192.16s: it's just was that grotesque I just
194.40s: wanted to get rich uh and then what
196.80s: happened is I went to to college and I
200.56s: started you know was at uh at this fancy
203.44s: undergrad business school um and I just
206.36s: started actually liking the topic right
208.44s: like I started getting obsessed with I
209.96s: read like every book everything that I
212.12s: could even get my hands on related to
213.84s: investing and and it became like more
215.92s: like an intellectual Obsession like
217.88s: obviously I still wanted to get rich in
219.24s: the back of my head but really was just
221.20s: interesting right and then then what
223.36s: happened is I did really well in one of
225.32s: these classes and the professor's like
227.24s: hey you know you should consider doing
228.76s: research which was code word for hey be
231.28s: my data monkey programming [ __ ] and
234.20s: like you know do all the nasty stuff and
236.32s: then I'll put my name on it the look
237.80s: smart but at the time it sounded great
240.08s: professors asked me to do something and
242.04s: in the end it was great but like then I
244.44s: got my hands dirty in like the Deep
246.20s: research like programming data stuff and
248.60s: I was like and I just kept getting more
249.72s: and more interested in it as a topic and
252.52s: then what happened is is all the staff
255.92s: there the professor said hey you know
258.28s: you should consider doing a PhD and I
260.84s: was like great how does that work
262.96s: they're like well apply to this place
264.32s: called University of Chicago I was like
265.96s: great I'll never get in they're like
267.28s: we'll get you in because it's very like
269.20s: close deal and all of them were Chicago
271.96s: phds so then I got in a PhD program and
275.08s: then you know I spent two years there
277.04s: and then I actually always wanted to do
279.08s: the service but I couldn't get the
281.28s: timing right so then I took a sabatical
284.00s: to go join the the Marines right I was
286.00s: in 04 to yeah 04 to 08 and then I came
289.60s: back to finish my PhD 08 to1 and I had
293.56s: to kind of like relearned Finance
295.00s: obviously and and then you know then it
297.08s: was great I was like I'm like already
299.04s: like all in on finance I still wanted to
301.48s: make money but then I got I got a
303.40s: professor job which I don't know if you
305.36s: know much about Professor jobs but it's
307.32s: not a real job right your job is to get
309.68s: paid a lot of money to sit around and
311.32s: think about things which is pretty
313.44s: awesome and so that's what I did and
315.52s: then simultaneous to that like way back
318.48s: in the day like this was probably I
320.52s: don't remember 2009 2010 time frame you
323.84s: know I was doing a blog like I used to
325.72s: be blogger blog spot some ghetto Google
328.76s: thing that I don't even know if it
330.28s: exists anymore and like for whatever
332.60s: reason this was again like there was
334.24s: like five blogs in the world back then
336.52s: and no one was doing like geeky Quant
338.56s: Finance oh yeah I we had I had literally
341.68s: I had a billionaire co- call me and said
344.52s: hey Wes I've been reading your blog I
346.52s: read your dissertation can we talk like
349.80s: just dumb luck man from a stupid blog
352.64s: like I'm sure someone like on your
354.12s: YouTube channel might call you up
355.84s: someday that's that's how what happened
358.96s: and and then was like oh my god this is
361.08s: my first opportunity to maybe start a
364.40s: business because I finally met a
365.88s: billionaire who's interested in what I
367.60s: have to say and you know one thing led
369.64s: to the next we got seated 2012 with 50
372.80s: mil and now the rest is history I quit
375.44s: my professor job and then we just built
378.12s: you know our business to I don't even
380.08s: know what we got now 10 or 11 billion
382.44s: dollars or something um so that was my
384.88s: journey how do you even track it all you
386.88s: know exactly my my whole life was just
390.00s: worried about trying to get 1 million or
392.36s: like hey will someone please give me
393.84s: 10,000 bucks you know I'm eating ramen
396.56s: noodles here this sucks and then now now
398.96s: we're at a stage where like you know we
401.08s: get a 100 billion or 100 million a day
403.16s: and I'm like yeah whatever rounding
404.64s: error like it's you know it's crazy that
407.48s: your how your perspective changes but
409.88s: I'm I'm still close enough to being
411.52s: broke that I still kind of remember the
414.20s: struggle but but I I'm you know I'm kind
416.00s: of getting soft and as I keep going into
418.76s: more and more a
420.44s: it you know I gota I gotta stay humble
422.20s: and grounded uh somehow I I I need to
425.32s: figure that one out so I don't don't
426.88s: worry I'm I'm I'm here to bring the poor
429.88s: degener good yeah yeah make sure we get
432.68s: I gotta keep the Humble Pie going you
435.00s: know get too big for your britches so
438.20s: first follow question from that is why
441.56s: PhD you obviously had finish the
444.00s: original prerequisites to go essentially
446.28s: start the workforce why do more
447.96s: education instead of enter the workforce
450.88s: it to me like obviously wasn't a
452.88s: monetary thing because I could have just
454.60s: left with the NBA and go made a lot more
456.56s: money for me it was just the challenge
459.44s: and like you know PC is kind of
461.28s: considered like the Pinnacle of what you
463.04s: can do and I and I was just like hey
465.64s: I've already done most of the work let's
467.44s: just bang this out and and that's what I
470.00s: just thought I just like I just want to
471.72s: try to get the highest you can get in in
474.56s: this world and so that's what I just did
476.32s: that you know and obviously that
478.20s: probably was a better finan decision in
480.44s: the long game because obviously you know
482.52s: a lot more you got a lot more
484.00s: credibility but you know it's also a lot
486.44s: easier to like not be a slave student
489.84s: labor force uh for some professors
492.56s: whether your PhD make a 10 grand a year
495.68s: probably been smarter to go make 150
497.76s: 200k you know in the short run but the
500.20s: long game I think it's worth it just go
502.72s: for it which is why I did I I can't
504.32s: really justify it from a financial
506.68s: perspective makes total sense then the
509.20s: next thing you mentioned that I was
510.88s: actually I had a written down as a
512.68s: question because I find it so
513.92s: fascinating one of the things I find
516.00s: interesting about life is that a lot of
518.36s: times there is to your point with your
520.52s: billionaire friend a healthy dose of
523.52s: just pure dumb blind luck that tends to
526.56s: coales with some sort of skill set that
529.08s: has you primed to take advantage of the
531.80s: opportunity so when that billionaire
534.68s: cold called you what was your approach
537.12s: to take advantage of the opportunity cuz
538.88s: I feel like a lot lot of people they
540.56s: might see those kinds of opportunities
542.48s: but either get Frozen and not do
544.60s: something about it [ __ ] it up and not
546.52s: take advantage of it the right way what
547.96s: did you do yeah so again going back to
551.12s: the luck component so this was this was
553.80s: right after' 08 right so so what had
556.48s: happened after 08 is that everyone got
558.88s: smoked out and no one believed in the
560.80s: Unicorn anymore right like all the hedge
562.96s: funds all the fancy stuff got vetted as
566.08s: saying like wait a second all you hedge
568.68s: fund people that were paying all this
570.44s: money to that were supposed to protect
571.88s: my money you actually are down
574.84s: 30% you know and the Market's down 50
577.52s: but you know you're not supposed to be
578.68s: down any percent and and so and then not
581.40s: only that but I don't you probably don't
583.52s: know this but possessions nine10 the LW
586.60s: so in those Partnerships what happens is
588.64s: during stress you say I want my money
591.32s: and they say you know what just joking
593.52s: we're going to gate the fund you know
595.52s: for fiduciary obligations we can't give
597.80s: you your money and you're like well I
599.44s: want my money and so you start like 2008
602.64s: was like a great wakeup call to the
604.88s: world that paying too much on fees you
608.36s: know not having control of your money
610.56s: paying too much in taxes is a way of the
612.76s: dodo bird there's got to be a better way
615.44s: so I was coming in right after that
618.52s: where said billionaire basically was
621.48s: tired of dealing with Wall Street and
623.36s: started reading blogs and and he finds
626.28s: this idiot called West Gray with his PhD
629.32s: he's innocent enough and he he's not
631.36s: like he's not uh he's not poisoned by
634.96s: the culture of Wall Street right he seem
637.08s: so so he reaches out and he's like
639.12s: listen man I read all your stuff I love
641.12s: your background we need help to
643.32s: transition our family's business from
645.96s: these overpriced hedge funds to
648.24s: transparent scalable lowcost like Factor
651.76s: index type strategies and obviously I'm
654.88s: a Quant by background and this is all I
657.60s: think about and all I do so so that that
660.36s: luck of just I Haven have that Quant
662.28s: skill set and a billionaire guy just got
665.04s: smoked out by all the hedge fund idiots
667.12s: and I's like I want your skill set I
670.12s: mean it was just easy right and then and
671.76s: then I was just at the time this is what
673.72s: I always wanted to do was start my own
675.48s: business but as you know in Asset
677.52s: Management you need a lot of money to
679.28s: start a start the business because no
680.96s: one wants to invest with someone that
682.28s: has 10 bucks um it was perfect so it was
685.68s: just I was ready uh going there um so
689.68s: yeah and then I'll give you another one
691.40s: which is because that one I kind of was
692.84s: waiting for I had a quick question on
694.68s: that one though sure yeah did you said
697.92s: it was easy did you when you started
700.76s: going down that path were you like super
704.00s: confident I know exactly what I'm going
705.72s: to do I know this is how it's going to
707.80s: work out and you executed a plan or was
710.48s: it a kind of building the plane as it's
712.56s: flying kind of scenario uh that one
715.32s: because I'd been obsessed with what I
717.04s: was going to do ever since I could even
719.32s: think about it in my head I knew exactly
721.72s: what I was going to do but it's more
723.00s: about dragging the client along right so
726.16s: we we actually that was 2010 and
728.84s: actually we didn't get seated till 2012
731.12s: because the other thing I ran into is is
733.92s: the dad of the family who's not
736.08s: technically in control for tax reasons
737.88s: but you know how you know Dad made all
739.28s: the money he's kind of actually in
740.60s: control you know they just got out of
742.92s: the seating business they're like you
745.00s: know they're just like we just got
746.32s: smoked by all these hedge funds that we
748.28s: we would give them money and then then
749.76s: we get a piece of their business we're
751.88s: not doing that ever again and so while I
754.64s: was coming in with the exact sort of
756.40s: capabilities they also said we're not
758.76s: seeding a new fund operation ever again
761.96s: and so what I said is like listen Okay
763.88s: cool give me two years we'll do
766.60s: Consulting we'll do work and and if and
769.00s: if we show our our you know if we show
771.04s: our value ad can you pee please beg and
774.28s: plead and and like can we work a deal if
777.00s: we do the right thing to get seated so
779.32s: so it it wasn't automatic it took like
781.72s: two years of grinding it out you know
783.72s: showing her capabilities and I knew
786.24s: exactly what I wanted to do I wanted to
787.84s: get seated and I wanted to get track
789.80s: records in our strategies as soon as
792.36s: possible but I you can only move as fast
794.48s: as as the billionaires going to move
796.36s: right so all that stuff was premeditated
799.28s: murder and I was just waiting for the
801.80s: opportunity but let me give you another
803.76s: example that that's wasn't like that so
807.44s: you know and now where I am right now
809.16s: where we run this massive infrastructure
810.96s: business how the hell does a Quant
812.60s: Finance PhD end up being a used car
815.72s: salesman for like infrastructure that
818.16s: makes no damn sense and now this
819.96s: business is way bigger than our other
821.48s: business well what happened here is you
824.44s: know and this is again just dumb luck
826.60s: like we're doing Alpha architect we're
829.20s: launching our own ETFs and we're you
831.52s: know I'm Marine my one of my business
833.16s: partners Marine is you know it's all
835.04s: about do more with less we don't need
836.96s: big army we'll go figure out this this
839.12s: stuff on our own and so that culture
841.16s: kind of like was with us so being idiots
844.36s: we said oh we'll just DIY all this ETF
847.16s: infrastructure and you know which
848.76s: obviously looking back was idiotic but
850.52s: at the time you know when you don't know
852.32s: what you don't know you just figure it
854.40s: out and so you know we did that for 10
857.04s: years and then you know five years ago a
860.56s: gal hit us up she's like why don't you
862.56s: guys let other people use your
864.16s: infrastructure because you guys do it so
865.88s: much more efficiently and cheaper than
867.44s: everyone else in the public market it'd
869.56s: be really nice if you'd like rent your
871.80s: your your infrastructure to me and we're
874.24s: like we're not going to do that we don't
875.64s: we don't do like monkey work we're just
877.72s: we're portfolio managers and we only do
880.52s: like the good stuff right the Rockstar
882.60s: job she's like but you guys would be
884.64s: really good at this and then anyways
886.32s: long story short we finally said okay
888.40s: fine we'll do it like you know not
890.64s: because we wanted to like who wants to
892.12s: be the garbage man for someone else and
895.08s: and that lucky decision not even
898.40s: planning on being in this business kind
900.16s: of just being nice to a friend that end
902.96s: up being an
904.60s: explosive business opportunity where
907.16s: when we just took our cost center turn
909.76s: it into a business and now everyone in
912.96s: the world wants to start an ETF and
914.68s: everyone in the world wants to do it
915.88s: lowc cost easy and
918.08s: transparently like we created this
920.00s: monster and that and that was never even
922.52s: close to being in the business plan I
925.64s: it's crazy like I would never in a
927.28s: million years have thought about a in
929.24s: this business and now this business like
931.08s: I said makes more money is a bigger
933.76s: business than the asset management
935.20s: business ever thought of being it you
937.20s: know you just you these things happen in
940.28s: life well I find they happen but it
943.40s: takes a certain temperament for it to
945.12s: happen right like there's even to your
947.60s: point at first you were resistant to the
949.36s: idea but then you turn around you're
950.68s: like yeah sure we'll give it a shot
952.44s: right even the fact that you gave me uh
955.24s: that first phone call we had right like
956.76s: you chose to just give me a shot to talk
958.20s: to you I find that people that tend to
960.84s: have that at why not you know what like
962.68s: what what's it going to hurt like just
963.88s: give it a shot tend to have interesting
966.08s: results because sooner or later I feel
968.48s: like that's what it takes to start
971.12s: seeing some forward progress now yeah
975.16s: going back to your first fund you had
977.68s: talked about the strategy that you built
981.08s: and that essentially you were waiting
982.96s: for a chance to deploy it how did you
984.84s: build that
986.44s: strategy yeah so this is a really long
989.60s: story uh I'll try to make it quick so
992.96s: make it as long as you want yeah yeah
994.68s: going way back in the day so just
997.20s: because everyone has their start in
999.16s: their world and that shapes their rest
1001.36s: of their investment experience right so
1003.64s: my first real investing was in like 98
1007.00s: 99 when there was an internet bubble
1009.20s: which was really weird because there's
1010.44s: so much Deja Vu I get in today's market
1013.32s: where all these tech stocks are going
1015.04s: crazy like it's insane and like all the
1018.00s: value kind of boring stuff is like
1020.08s: that'll never work they're never going
1021.48s: to have a business it was literally the
1023.08s: same story in 98 99 and I just happened
1026.80s: to be school I was trained because it
1028.72s: was my only training in Warren Buffett
1031.40s: value investing so so obviously when I
1034.24s: got started I was like God am I just an
1036.84s: idiot because like I'm not making any
1038.64s: money and everyone all these other
1040.08s: idiots gambling on tech stocks are
1041.88s: making thousand or per a year but
1044.52s: because I hadn't had enough time to
1046.28s: change my mind I got lucky as you
1049.16s: probably recall like in 99 the NASDAQ
1052.08s: triple Q went down 80% or whatever it
1054.68s: was or maybe it's 90% I can't even
1056.52s: remember it was insane and value stocks
1059.56s: made money and I was like damn and I was
1062.60s: stock picking I thought I was gonna be
1064.48s: warrant Buffett I didn't even know what
1065.68s: a computer was for for doing this stuff
1067.84s: right anyways so I start off as a
1070.60s: fundamental fuddy duddy value investing
1074.20s: you know loser type guy like what most
1076.64s: people consider a loser so that was that
1078.44s: was my visual training and then just
1080.56s: over time you know I I just got I was
1083.48s: interested in scalability making it
1085.28s: easier so naturally gravitate like well
1087.40s: can we do this with a computer it seems
1088.96s: a lot more efficient and so IID always
1091.12s: tried to systemize the value philosophy
1094.84s: with a machine because it's a pain in
1096.84s: the ass to read 10ks and like call
1099.20s: people up it's just annoying um and then
1102.24s: like in my grad school during PhD kind
1104.60s: of one of the things I kind of proved to
1106.20s: myself is that yes a computer can for
1109.24s: all intents and purposes replicate you
1111.28s: know 95% of what the people can do
1114.12s: anyways and so I kind of just there's
1116.32s: more to the story but I just totally
1118.44s: threw stock picking you know with my
1121.00s: brain in the trash can and I just became
1123.40s: a Quant if it's not if I can't coat it
1125.52s: up can't put it in a system with rules I
1127.52s: ain't doing it and so and and so I just
1130.40s: had cooked these different strategies up
1132.76s: and another interesting story which is
1135.08s: another which is a is a bad story in in
1137.64s: the end is right when I got out of
1140.20s: service my original attempt Is We I
1142.88s: launched a hedge fund I launched it in
1145.80s: September 08 which is literally the
1148.88s: Pinnacle exactly perfect timing just bad
1151.96s: luck in this case and and so I launched
1154.52s: this damn Quant value like like
1157.72s: systematic value strategy long short in
1160.12s: September 08 of course the first month I
1163.08s: launched they say it's basically illegal
1165.08s: to short like like they they were
1167.04s: recalling short positions on like
1168.76s: Russell 2000 like like things you would
1171.12s: never think you wouldn't be able to you
1172.64s: could short all the time literally like
1174.96s: interactor Brokers are like there's no
1176.36s: short available I'm like well how am I
1178.68s: gonna run a long short fund yeah yeah if
1181.68s: I can't short and and so I was like well
1184.80s: [ __ ] I just started this thing and I
1186.92s: can't even implement the very strategy
1189.32s: so then then because I was an idiot I
1191.48s: talked to the partners I'm like well we
1193.08s: can't do that we can go back to stock
1194.72s: picking and they're like sure if you
1196.64s: think there's and so I did that you know
1198.28s: blah blah blah blah and then that funed
1200.48s: up being a disaster as you can imagine
1202.48s: because I did stock picking it should
1203.92s: just been a Quant and then you know it
1206.44s: it eventually I had this whole
1208.04s: convoluted path where I kept I was a
1209.92s: value investor fundamental but then I
1212.28s: did it systematic and I had a few
1214.00s: permutations of it and then I wrote a
1215.68s: book where was basically a book about
1218.60s: this is how I would go about
1221.28s: computerizing what value investors do
1223.68s: it's called quantitative value right and
1225.92s: then that so that book is is the
1228.92s: strategy effectively we've obviously
1230.60s: tweaked it over time and that's what we
1232.40s: ended up getting seated so so this was
1234.24s: like probably a 10year you know strategy
1237.56s: experience development to finally get
1239.40s: there and we still run those strategies
1241.04s: to this day uh but but that that's how I
1244.20s: eventually kind of bobbed and weaved to
1246.68s: you know doing this systematic
1248.40s: quantitative value thing uh I was just
1251.20s: obsessed with it talk to me about the
1254.60s: focus behind that I think a lot of thing
1256.48s: for Traders and I imagine especially
1258.72s: going through your background there's
1261.00s: got to be a pretty significant period of
1262.48s: time where you're like testing different
1264.20s: things coming across new ideas different
1266.28s: approaches but you've kind of stayed
1268.72s: centered on your thing value investing
1271.08s: slightly different permutations and
1272.40s: whatnot so how did you stay so focused
1274.88s: on that and were you testing other
1277.16s: things and you kept coming back to home
1278.72s: base or what did that look like yeah so
1281.28s: so I always just like anybody like human
1283.60s: nature is to anchor on what you first
1286.08s: see and what you think is good and then
1287.80s: then once you get anchored on something
1289.40s: it's very hard to accept new ideas right
1292.52s: but luckily you know I was trained in
1295.40s: the depths of University of Chicago
1298.28s: which the culture of that place is it's
1301.52s: an idea like violent idea exchange and
1304.92s: like if you post an idea our job is not
1307.00s: to tell you how great your idea is our
1308.96s: idea is to tell you how stupid you are
1311.32s: and how screwed up it is which is not
1313.52s: exactly a fun culture to be in to be
1315.60s: frank but it's a great way to kind of
1318.32s: just be open to new ideas and never
1320.68s: think you have a monopoly on on what
1322.56s: works right but of course being a human
1325.12s: started off as a value picker it worked
1327.80s: great at the end of 99 and it worked
1330.20s: great through the early 2000s thought I
1332.48s: was a genius um then I have you know the
1335.20s: systematic value book use those systems
1337.48s: all good except you know being an
1340.12s: academic and being so exposed to
1341.96s: academic research where all you have
1343.84s: there is just phds turning data all day
1346.20s: to figure out ideas you know I was
1348.24s: always was aware of things like Trend
1349.96s: falling momentum and like gazillions of
1352.84s: strategies right it's just I was
1355.00s: resistant because I I knew and had
1357.56s: confidence and had ego tied to value and
1360.76s: then it it was only just I guess
1362.84s: actually one especially that billion
1364.76s: like like with respect to Trend falling
1367.16s: like if you would have asked me before
1368.88s: 2010 if I thought Trend falling was a
1371.24s: good idea I'd have told your [ __ ]
1372.88s: insane right because Trend following as
1375.16s: you can imagine in value investor
1376.96s: circles
1378.56s: is crazy like you're a devil worshipper
1381.60s: if you think you're going to move out of
1383.00s: the market like use Trend like price
1385.44s: trends to like like you it's literally
1387.84s: Insanity it's literally like being a
1389.52s: devil worshipper if you're in the value
1391.56s: religion camp and then I had this
1393.68s: billionaire guy telling me like hey man
1395.72s: because he's obviously interested in our
1397.00s: value stuff he's like he's like I've
1399.16s: been a Tren f for like 30 years man like
1401.80s: why don't you do that like it's common
1403.76s: secret I'm like well because professors
1405.44s: say it's stupid and you're an idiot he's
1407.96s: like well I appreciate you telling me
1409.92s: I'm an idiot even though I'm a
1411.00s: billionaire but you know you should
1412.68s: investigate it more and so I was like
1415.08s: all right whatever you know he's a
1416.16s: client I got I'll do it and then and I
1418.52s: started yeah exactly I'll appease him
1421.04s: but I know he's gonna be wrong and then
1423.24s: sure enough as I dug in I'm like holy
1425.76s: [ __ ] like this is one of the greatest
1428.32s: ideas ever why did all these damn
1430.84s: professors [ __ ] on this my whole life
1433.76s: you know and then after the fact like
1435.48s: the last 20 years there's been a lot
1436.96s: more research from academics to say oh
1439.24s: wow Trend falling Works to which most
1441.68s: people are like well no [ __ ] like we've
1443.36s: known that for 50 years but it it's but
1446.04s: it just takes time right so I had to
1447.92s: adapt because sometimes you just need a
1450.92s: trigger point to get you to think
1452.52s: outside of your own box and that I've
1455.08s: been around for so long I'm open to any
1457.36s: idea at some level I just want to make
1459.08s: sure is it evidence-based is it robust
1461.64s: is it is it grounded in like some sort
1463.68s: of financial economics or behavioral
1465.64s: issues like it's got to pass the sniff
1468.00s: test but I'm open to a lot of ideas
1470.56s: which is why we do value we do momentum
1472.36s: we do Trend I do you know anything you
1474.32s: name we probably do some element of it
1476.04s: now where that wouldn't have been the
1477.80s: case maybe 10 or 15 years ago that makes
1480.68s: a ton of sense that was actually going
1481.96s: to be one of my followup questions
1483.24s: because I do find a lot of times there's
1485.60s: a a really interesting Valley between
1488.40s: theoretical application and then actual
1492.24s: like inm Market application of ideas and
1495.92s: to me that's actually one of been one of
1497.80s: the the the benefits of being a retail
1500.08s: Trader is you do have the luxury of
1503.68s: looking at something and saying I like
1505.28s: this or don't like this throw this out
1506.76s: try something new and I mean you
1509.28s: obviously you're super smart I know I'm
1510.92s: an idiot so I don't trust any of my own
1512.88s: ideas I'm not really set on anything I
1514.92s: am very receptive now yeah one of the
1518.72s: follow-ups to that though is when you
1521.28s: look across your time in Academia
1523.44s: compared to like practically interacting
1526.16s: with markets MH what what are some of
1528.84s: the largest disparities you see in terms
1531.64s: of truths held in Academia that does not
1535.44s: cross over into
1537.44s: markets yeah so so the good thing about
1540.64s: Academia is there's not like a financial
1543.44s: incentive per se right it's an idea
1546.04s: place but but obviously if you're just
1548.36s: an idea Place Ivory Tower you think
1551.52s: about ideas but you you obviously don't
1553.68s: really consider like the practicalities
1555.68s: of these ideas right so I I really loved
1559.12s: academics because it teach you how to be
1561.16s: like a researcher and try your best use
1563.48s: like the scientific method you know in
1566.00s: theory come up with a theory and then
1567.60s: you have you have different hypotheses
1569.16s: you use data to test hypothesis to
1570.88s: validate it you know blah blah blah and
1573.04s: it doesn't work like that perfectly but
1575.32s: at least you don't have the financial
1577.12s: incentive of like selling someone a
1579.08s: product or selling someone a back test
1580.88s: so they give you money to make money on
1583.56s: right so I like the purity of it but of
1586.12s: course that's nice from an idea just
1588.28s: eration component but then we need to
1590.16s: also consider to your point well that's
1592.48s: great Mr Ivory Tower but you know you
1594.64s: can't do that because you can't short
1596.36s: you can't use the margin you can't trade
1598.16s: penny stocks with a billion dollars
1599.96s: without moving the stock whatever right
1602.08s: so obviously the practitioners are very
1604.28s: good at understanding the Nuance of
1607.44s: implementation but there's another the
1609.64s: biggest challenge I think is Academia is
1612.80s: great because it's basically trained
1614.40s: researchers trying to develop new ideas
1616.24s: that go through the fire of peer review
1618.60s: and of course they got bias and of
1620.44s: course they got issues like saying Trend
1622.36s: falling stupid and eventually they'll
1624.76s: change their mind which they've done but
1626.88s: they don't they have clean incentives
1628.44s: generally practitioners the issue there
1630.96s: is they're good at implementing
1632.24s: strategies but they have to deal with
1634.56s: other people's money so one of the
1636.32s: biggest dichotomies is retail investors
1640.08s: have this amazing advantage of the sense
1642.44s: that it's their money and they want to
1644.72s: maximize presumably their benefits right
1647.56s: we're third thir party managers in the
1650.40s: business of managing money you're now
1653.20s: managing money on behalf of someone else
1656.56s: and you need to look good and and how do
1658.88s: you look good well in the short run you
1660.68s: have benchmarks and so there's massive
1663.68s: constraints on professionals and
1665.48s: investors to conform to the status quo
1669.24s: because imagine if I have a strategy
1671.20s: that does the following it's
1673.16s: underperformed seven out of 10
1675.68s: years and it compounds $1 to say $100
1679.60s: but it underperforms seven out of 10
1681.56s: years and I'm managing other people's
1683.04s: money the other strategy basically beats
1686.96s: the market call it eight out of 10 years
1689.68s: but ends up doing $1 to say $95 so over
1693.32s: 10e period it's actually worse however
1696.04s: the path is a lot more marketable and
1699.08s: it's a lot easier to collect more money
1701.08s: to charge fees on other people's money
1703.40s: than a strategy that loses seven times
1705.80s: out of 10 right so so Prof professionals
1708.56s: have this very constrained thing that
1711.24s: that they have to deal with which is
1712.56s: called other people's money whereas
1714.64s: retail people can literally do whatever
1716.68s: the hell they want however retail people
1720.28s: can do whatever the hell they want but
1722.00s: now they also suffer a lot of times from
1723.76s: behavioral biases overconfidence and all
1727.16s: these other problems so there's no
1729.28s: there's no right answer it's all about
1731.08s: like what are the incentives what are
1732.32s: the
1733.04s: behaviors and and then that's going to
1734.88s: be the best solution for that particular
1736.72s: circumstance and yeah makes a ton of
1739.24s: sense and there's a lot of edge in there
1741.16s: like like retail people like you know
1743.36s: hey you want to go you want to go do
1744.72s: some Trend falling strategies on
1746.68s: GameStop I think that's a great strategy
1749.12s: same thing like crypto like if someone
1750.76s: if I didn't have so much compliance and
1752.32s: I could go do like a three-month Trend
1753.92s: fing strategy on crypto I'd be doing
1755.68s: that all day long I can't there's too
1758.76s: much compliance there's too much
1760.44s: everything like no no professional could
1763.16s: go gamble on GameStop or even do a smart
1766.16s: gamble on GameStop because it's too con
1768.28s: straining whereas retail if you can
1771.16s: click the button in Robin Hood you can
1773.04s: do whatever you want right so so there's
1775.40s: a lot of opportunities to as a retail
1777.60s: investor if you can
1779.48s: contain you know your behavioral issues
1782.36s: which which is because there's not so
1783.92s: many rules on you sometimes that can
1786.16s: actually make you make bad decisions as
1787.84s: well so it's it's all about trying to
1789.12s: weigh those cost benefits yeah you I
1792.84s: think did just huge service to analyzing
1797.64s: some of the retail perspective and I
1799.24s: think that's super important because I
1801.04s: try to remind retail traders that in
1803.08s: general you are disadvantaged in the
1805.32s: marketplace that doesn't mean you're
1807.28s: totally disadvantaged and you're
1809.04s: literally highlighting some of the key
1811.20s: advantages I think most of us may or may
1814.44s: not capitalize on so following that
1816.44s: thread a little bit more leaning into
1818.96s: the retail perspective and some of the
1821.24s: strengths they have you highlighted some
1823.12s: of the weaknesses being behavioral
1825.36s: biases if you were a budding retail
1829.56s: Trader how would you approach trying to
1832.64s: be a successful long-term retail
1835.72s: Trader yeah so what I would do is do do
1839.08s: weird stuff right like for example like
1843.00s: I I'll just give an example like kind of
1844.48s: what we do in the business because we're
1846.04s: one of the weird people that that we
1847.88s: just do weird stuff because I I
1850.04s: originally built strategies because I
1851.60s: wanted to do it for my own money frankly
1854.56s: even though it's not like anyone else
1855.92s: did it right so generally let's say we
1858.68s: do a signal that we have a lot of
1860.00s: confidence in call it factor x let's
1862.88s: just say the value Factor just because
1864.72s: everyone knows kind of generally what
1866.04s: that is and you're a retail Trader and
1868.60s: you're like all right everyone probably
1870.12s: knows that buying cheap stocks is a good
1872.08s: idea over the Long Haul but what's the
1875.32s: institutional other people money guy
1877.44s: going to do they're gonna be like wow
1878.80s: God if you buy cheap stocks over like
1880.96s: the next 50 years in general you get
1883.08s: like three or 4% over the market great
1886.32s: that's what they're going to look at how
1887.48s: much money money can I make on this damn
1889.40s: thing and you can do that because a
1891.20s: retail Trader can actually think 20 30
1893.80s: years out and they don't you can't fire
1895.92s: yourself the institutional Traders gonna
1898.04s: be like wait a second let's not we got
1900.52s: to be careful here because we know value
1902.84s: can lose its ass over many year
1905.12s: stretches we can't run like bu the top
1908.12s: 10% cheap stocks even though that
1910.00s: algorithm looks amazing well we're going
1911.88s: to do is we're going to go buy all 500
1914.12s: S&P stocks and do little tilts where
1917.52s: it's 99% the same as S&P but we're going
1920.56s: to call it value and carry on in life
1923.24s: because we're just in the marketing
1924.56s: business we're not in the investing
1926.08s: business whereas a retail person could
1928.04s: be like I'm not trying to sell my stuff
1930.68s: to other people I did the back test and
1933.72s: just buying the 10% cheapest PE stocks
1936.92s: makes 3% more than the market over long
1939.76s: Horizons and yeah it underperforms and
1942.60s: looks like puke sometimes who cares Rog
1946.24s: that I'm in like and I'm just giv that
1948.20s: as a simple example I'm not saying it
1949.56s: has to be value but anytime you identify
1952.20s: strategies that you know institutional
1955.00s: professional investors would puke on you
1957.44s: know you're on the right track and to
1959.52s: the extent that they're hard to hold and
1961.92s: if you had to show your statement to
1963.48s: your mom every day should' be like you
1965.48s: know what planet do you live on like
1967.60s: even though that's not doesn't sound
1969.36s: good that's actually the perfect because
1971.00s: that's where all your edges is doing
1973.16s: weird stuff that the institutional guys
1975.72s: can't really do and you have Horizon and
1977.96s: you can't fire yourself so any
1979.68s: opportunity that high level is weird and
1982.88s: hard to do and looks ugly in the short
1984.88s: run is usually a great strategy and
1987.96s: something that we have Competitive
1989.80s: Edge as a retail Trader effectively it's
1993.64s: funny to say that have you read the book
1995.56s: what works on Wall Street by of course
1999.24s: yeah yeah it's a great book it's funny
2001.60s: because he talks a lot about the
2002.88s: multiactor models and a lot of the
2004.60s: components that you're referencing there
2006.16s: which is it's funny because a lot of
2008.88s: what I've done on the retail side is
2010.52s: I've kind of Built My Own data set that
2012.44s: I can track various factors and
2014.96s: essentially conduct similar analysis I
2017.88s: find it interesting that you innately go
2020.20s: to kind of long run performance though
2023.12s: yeah is that your typical leaning yes
2026.24s: I'll tell you why I've hung around a lot
2028.12s: of rich people and the number one thing
2030.96s: that rich people are good at is avoiding
2033.60s: fees and avoiding taxes all right it
2037.92s: doesn't matter if you're going to try to
2039.96s: sque the markets are extremely
2041.60s: competitive in general and so if you you
2044.52s: think over any sort of long duration
2046.64s: period you're going to be able to Edge
2047.96s: out more than a couple percent without
2049.96s: taking extraordinary risk you're wrong
2052.24s: because it's just too competitive right
2054.60s: however what can you control fees and
2058.44s: taxes and what is the destructor and
2061.40s: what is the generator of fees and taxes
2063.92s: trading a lot so necessarily you have a
2067.32s: huge disadvantage as a retail investor
2069.76s: unless you don't have any money because
2071.48s: you're going to have high marginal tax
2073.04s: rates and you're usually going to have
2074.68s: high frictional costs compared to like
2076.64s: how the cost for me to trade and so you
2080.08s: have to in general if you want to
2082.60s: compound and you're not you know it's
2084.84s: it's just the math right like let's say
2087.12s: your your compounding rate is 10% well 1
2090.52s: plus 10% but you got a minus off fee
2093.44s: cost minus off tax cost that might be
2096.12s: five one plus plus 05 to the 50th is way
2101.28s: lower than say
2103.44s: 1.07 to the 50th well let's say you can
2106.08s: do a strategy that makes 7% but you can
2108.12s: do it low turnover and not have to pay a
2110.00s: lot of taxes that's better than
2112.16s: something that makes 10% but after fees
2114.64s: and taxes you make 5% it's just math so
2118.12s: so I've just noticed over the long haul
2120.36s: that rich people the reason they're rich
2123.16s: is not because they're genius investors
2125.08s: frankly they're usually okay they're
2126.80s: good enough for government work but
2128.56s: they're great at avoiding taxes and
2130.76s: they're great at minimizing
2132.96s: fees so that that's why I so focus on
2136.32s: long duration when you're an individual
2139.00s: because it's the only Edge you
2140.72s: got interesting yeah I I find that
2143.68s: absolutely fascinating because to me I
2145.84s: think one of the things retail Traders
2148.16s: can do to really amplify returns at
2150.80s: least as far as I've attempted to do is
2154.00s: WR along and try to Pace Market as best
2156.68s: as possible during up years and then
2158.56s: when the market is having draw Downs do
2160.72s: my very best to not participate at all
2163.16s: and I found by essentially having a
2165.76s: slightly more active approach than it
2167.32s: sounds like you would lean towards I
2169.96s: found that actually has worked super
2171.64s: well for me because Al I don't have too
2175.32s: many like crazy knock out of the
2177.48s: ballpark years I I've had two negative
2180.52s: years my first two and both less than
2182.88s: 5% so 100% there's you just got to solve
2187.36s: the fees and taxes problem so if you can
2189.72s: if you can somehow put this in qualified
2191.68s: accounts or get like buy real estate to
2194.28s: Shield it you just you got to get the
2196.20s: tax man off your back or you're never
2198.00s: going to be able to compound at the
2199.40s: appropriate rates even with a lot of
2201.20s: Edge and then as long as your your cost
2203.48s: of frictional cost you got manage
2205.28s: because you're you know which I'm sure
2206.40s: you do I'm not saying you can't do this
2209.12s: you just want to be very very painfully
2211.28s: aware of how do I do the strategy while
2213.88s: minimizing tax hits and fee hits because
2216.36s: that that's what that's like the
2217.60s: weighing fact it'll drag you down into
2219.64s: the mud at some point well and I also
2222.24s: think that's one of the things that
2223.64s: retail traders in general They Don't
2225.72s: Really acknowledge because especially
2228.84s: with the decline of commissions right I
2231.12s: think retail Traders still don't
2233.08s: understand all of the friction in each
2234.84s: of their transactions especially now
2236.64s: that it's essentially hidden and it's
2238.64s: behind the back via payment for order
2240.12s: flow and stuff like that they're not
2241.36s: seeing it up front so the fact I agree
2244.36s: the fact that you highlight that and
2245.96s: that's been one of the most common
2247.24s: threat spreads across professional
2248.88s: traders that I've spoken with I think
2250.40s: it's something that people should really
2252.16s: key into even though it's not something
2254.00s: you can directly see it's there yeah but
2256.92s: going to your point like you're
2258.52s: basically outlining a trend falling
2260.32s: strategy Trend falling is actually the
2263.72s: ultimate strategy that institutions and
2266.52s: professionals will generally avoid
2268.52s: because as you probably know like most
2269.92s: Trend strategies over the long Hall give
2272.00s: you the same performance with half the
2273.48s: draw down just generically the problem
2276.84s: is you get whip saw a lot which is not a
2279.68s: big deal like if you're Trend follower
2281.28s: that's Trend falling you're going to
2282.48s: lose probably six or seven out of 10 but
2285.04s: that's not the point the point is I
2286.60s: participate most of the time and win and
2288.84s: I avoid the big draw down but can you
2291.32s: imagine and unfortunately I've lived
2293.48s: this but you can imagine being a
2294.80s: professional managing other people's
2296.72s: money and you're Trend falling and like
2299.76s: the market goes ripping and you're flat
2302.28s: you know like you need a full cycle to
2304.32s: actually see if it's actually working
2305.80s: for you and it's just that's a strategy
2308.20s: just generically that fits in that mold
2310.00s: of extremely painful to do and it looks
2313.04s: weird in the short run and that and and
2315.80s: most professionals just can't do it so I
2318.48s: I mean I think that's a retail Haven you
2320.92s: now you just got to manage the taxes and
2322.56s: the fees and you got a Humdinger I'm all
2325.40s: in on that that's a great idea yeah it
2328.84s: well and it's funny too because I
2330.40s: primarily trade derivatives so you can
2332.44s: add leverage to some of it and you know
2334.72s: be a real regenerate out there but
2336.60s: that's you know that that's half to fun
2338.72s: is I pretty much have to report to my
2340.48s: board member which is my dog sitting
2342.44s: right here and he doesn't seem exactly
2344.36s: he doesn't care at all yeah I love it
2347.32s: and you and you can do smart things just
2349.40s: because you want to do them you're not
2350.88s: you don't got boards constituencies
2353.00s: you're not trying to impress somebody um
2355.72s: so retail individuals like I retail's
2358.96s: kind of got like a negative connotation
2361.32s: what I what I would say is direct
2363.92s: capital owners because you can be retail
2366.52s: and have 10 bucks or you could be retail
2368.28s: and have a billion bucks like I know
2370.08s: guys that have billion dollars that
2372.16s: don't have any advisors they just trade
2374.60s: their money and you know they're retail
2377.56s: it's it's really just are you do you
2379.36s: care about maximizing your own wealth
2381.84s: and then managing your own behavioral
2383.36s: issues or are you managing other
2385.32s: people's money which means you got a
2387.56s: whole another set of incentives and then
2389.68s: just those different groups have
2390.88s: different ways of going about it but
2392.24s: retail is not necessarily bad or good
2394.72s: it's just a different incentive
2396.12s: structure they you're dealing with which
2398.68s: has advantages and disadvantages yep I I
2402.04s: think that makes a lot of sense and I'm
2403.80s: glad that you brought up the behavioral
2405.08s: thing as well because it's something
2406.12s: that I refer people a lot I actually try
2407.76s: to get people on ssrn as much as humanly
2410.00s: possible and put them in front of
2411.64s: different kind of studies like one of my
2413.20s: favorites is the behavior of individual
2414.92s: investors by Leon Odin Barbara Leon Odin
2418.64s: and it it talks about a lot of retail
2420.64s: Trader Tendencies because to your point
2422.24s: I think the autonomy is good but it's
2423.92s: almost like when you give some people
2425.16s: too much autonomy they don't know what
2426.32s: to do with it and and then they try a
2428.04s: strategy for 2 weeks it's good path so
2430.60s: now they think they have it cracked then
2432.08s: there's bad path and now they abandon it
2434.00s: and so on and so forth It's U that's
2436.80s: actually something I'd love to follow up
2438.20s: with you on sometime a little bit more
2439.92s: about regulating more of the behavioral
2442.36s: side of trading for retail investors I
2444.80s: think that would be super super fun but
2446.40s: we are at time Wes and I am committed to
2450.04s: getting you out of here on time to enjoy
2452.12s: the rest of your day I genuinely value
2454.56s: you com in to hang out for a little bit
2456.08s: obviously I feel it immediate sens of
2458.48s: camaraderie with you so thanks for
2460.84s: kicking it for a little bit if people
2462.32s: want to get a hold of you or do you want
2464.32s: them to pop over to your Twitter page or
2466.56s: X or whatever I'm supposed to call it
2468.24s: usually uh yeah Al yeah what I still
2470.64s: call it Twitter too yeah I'm just Alpha
2472.52s: architect on Twitter um I'll throw a
2474.60s: link in yeah and just you know our
2476.80s: website's Alpha architect WE Post blog
2478.92s: posts and do all kinds of research ideas
2481.60s: that you could try to actually Implement
2483.76s: a lot like we're always post up new
2485.36s: ideas we don't do them all I'm sure some
2487.88s: of these blogs you know if someone had
2489.92s: the time they could code it up and start
2491.56s: trading on it probably make some money
2493.76s: um so yeah I appreciate what you're
2496.24s: doing too like it's very important that
2497.92s: retail and individual
2500.28s: investors just get it straight and don't
2503.52s: aren't get don't get told that like
2505.28s: money grows on trees it's so easy you
2508.32s: know that's just the worst situation and
2510.60s: and getting rich quick is never going to
2512.56s: happen reliably so so people like you
2515.56s: that kind of like say hey got to be
2517.52s: honest with it do the right thing work
2519.96s: hard all that I you know I think that's
2521.52s: a very important message for the
2523.04s: investing public yeah I appreciate that
2525.40s: I always think of it as the like the
2526.84s: Traders Paradox because pretty much all
2528.88s: Traders I know we start trading in the
2531.40s: attempt to make money fast and this is
2534.64s: one of the worst possible places to try
2536.64s: to do it it's literally a paradox It's
2539.44s: the funniest thing and the best part
2541.72s: about it is everybody that I meet that's
2543.56s: super successful in the business they're
2545.92s: all super [ __ ] hardworking go figure
2550.28s: so yeah that's how it works man that
2552.84s: seems to be the case in in every
2554.40s: business like if it was so easy everyone
2556.48s: would do it and everyone would get rich
2558.48s: but unfortunately to make money you can
2561.08s: always get lucky but in general you just
2564.36s: got to work hard and add value and you
2567.56s: know it's just unfortunately part of the
2570.04s: deal that's it man heads down get to
2572.96s: work everybody so thanks for hanging out
2574.64s: to the end and we'll see you guys on the
2576.88s: next one
