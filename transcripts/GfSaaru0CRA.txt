0.00s: Let's talk about a simple pre-trade checklist
2.88s: that I'm going to share with you all.
4.96s: The goal of this video is to give you the framework
8.52s: for a checklist that is in-depth enough
12.36s: to make sure that we're not making stupid errors,
15.00s: but not so in-depth that it won't be used.
18.72s: I found that to be a big problem for me
20.48s: when I first started trading is I would have all these great ideas
24.28s: on what I wanted to look at and what I thought was important.
27.52s: But then I'd run into the issue of,
29.76s: it became so burdensome that I wouldn't use it.
32.84s: So if something, although, might be super detailed
36.60s: and have everything that you could possibly need in it,
38.64s: it's completely useless if it's not usable.
41.00s: So this video is designed to strike a happy medium.
44.92s: I encourage you to add or remove things
48.16s: as you find suits your needs.
50.88s: The main thing I think about with pre-trade,
53.60s: post-trade checklists is that in the beginning,
56.56s: it should be a very manual process
58.84s: where we follow each step.
61.12s: But then over time, as you develop the skill set and the habits,
65.56s: you don't really have to have an actual checklist
69.08s: that you are tick boxing and filling out in that manner.
72.84s: I don't do that anymore myself,
74.60s: but I generally follow this process.
77.24s: So what's up everybody?
78.76s: Welcome back to all the outliers in a shout out
80.40s: to the Patreon family.
81.92s: You guys make content like this, pause, so ball.
84.24s: So let's get straight to it.
85.52s: Up front, broad screen.
87.32s: So let me lay some context here.
89.08s: The idea behind this video and the pre-trade checklist
93.80s: is that you've already found a trade that you're interested in.
97.00s: So we found something that you want to put a position on
100.56s: and then this would be the next series of steps
103.56s: that go along with it.
105.04s: Now, quick admin note, if you aren't sure
107.96s: how to find a trade that you want to put on,
110.64s: I'll throw a video in the notes below
112.80s: that specifically dies into scanning for trades,
115.68s: but we are just moving on past that phase.
118.28s: So from a broad screening perspective,
121.76s: the very first thing is the product liquid.
124.60s: This is kind of the easiest exonerating factor for a trade
128.88s: and the way that I think about these kind of pre-trade
132.52s: checklists is this.
134.48s: Now, I'll give you a second to soak this in
136.24s: because I know that the artwork here might be overwhelming.
139.12s: It might spur some sort of visceral emotional reaction
142.56s: as you feast your eyes and gaze upon the greatness
145.20s: that is whatever this thing is.
147.12s: It's a work of art.
148.36s: But what I'm trying to show you is a funnel.
150.60s: So what I try to do is apply these big screening factors
154.80s: upfront so that I get rid of a bunch of stuff
157.80s: without wasting time.
159.16s: This is a really efficient way to go about looking
162.44s: at any sort of position.
163.96s: So liquidity is kind of the biggest thing I can put up top
168.60s: that will get rid of a ton of things right out of the gate.
171.96s: So if you find something that you really like
173.84s: but it's not liquid, too bad time to move on.
176.00s: Now, there are different ways you can gauge liquidity.
178.64s: Bit asks spread specifically for the options traders
181.40s: is an important concept here.
183.24s: So if we take a look at something like TLT,
185.44s: what you'll notice is on a standard expiration,
188.68s: a weekly expiration, it's a $98 product
191.84s: and the bit asks spread is essentially three cents,
195.00s: very small.
195.96s: And if you don't know what good liquidity looks like,
198.56s: there's a few things to keep an eyeball for.
200.64s: Obviously the bit asks spread, the number of shares
203.36s: that trade in a given day, open interest is another good
206.88s: indication whether or not it has weeklies
209.80s: because they won't offer weeklies
211.96s: unless there's demand for those expiration cycles,
215.00s: stuff like that.
215.84s: And you have to figure out what makes sense for you.
217.12s: The one thing I can make sure is important to share with you,
221.72s: not really sure if I can make sure makes sense,
224.20s: but one thing I can say unequivocally is that if something
228.68s: is not going through a volatile period,
230.60s: this is as good as it gets.
232.56s: And if volatility starts to spike,
235.00s: markets widen considerably.
237.20s: So if you're looking at something that's not going through
239.28s: a super volatile period and you're like,
240.80s: man, this is kind of a liquid, it gets insanely worse
244.48s: if volatility kicks up.
246.00s: So you should be aware of that when you're thinking
247.60s: about liquidity.
248.60s: Now, the next few things don't necessarily tell us
252.52s: whether or not the trade goes on or not,
254.28s: but it informs our decision and our thoughts about the trade.
258.32s: The first one is, does the individual product
261.16s: have any upcoming announcements?
263.08s: Does it have earnings coming up?
264.88s: And those are important details.
267.04s: For example, if you're like, oh man,
268.84s: I really want to put a trade on in FedEx for whatever reason.
272.28s: I love it here.
273.64s: And you're not aware that it has earnings coming up.
276.48s: You are stepping in front of pretty significant risk
279.80s: and you're none the wiser.
281.08s: So when you're trading individual stocks,
283.12s: looking for earnings is important.
284.84s: Notice how on the last earnings cycle here,
287.36s: it had this big gap.
288.96s: You should be aware if something has earnings coming up.
292.04s: The main time I see this hurting traders
294.04s: is when they're looking for volatility.
296.00s: You're looking for your running scans
298.08s: that are looking for things with high implied volatility.
301.08s: And a lot of times that's going to be around an earnings event
303.88s: or an announcement of some sort.
305.36s: Maybe it's a biotech stock.
307.00s: And you don't connect those dots.
309.76s: And then all of a sudden, now you're
311.00s: putting a trade on that's going to take you through a binary event
313.68s: that's kind of a problem.
314.96s: The next thing is, are there any broad market events?
317.20s: This will impact trades differently,
320.12s: but you should be aware of what's coming up on the week ahead.
324.12s: A great tool to use for this.
326.28s: I really like them is called financial juice.
329.92s: And I am an affiliate for them.
331.76s: There's a link to their platform in the notes below.
334.48s: This isn't sponsored by them or anything.
335.88s: It's just a good product.
336.76s: And you don't have to sign up.
337.84s: You can get it without signing in.
339.72s: I like the sound of that.
341.20s: But this will tell you what's coming up on the week ahead.
343.68s: And the cool thing I really like about this website
346.00s: is that if you click, so for example,
347.84s: we have on 19 December, the housing starts.
350.04s: If we click that, it'll take you to the corresponding website,
353.24s: which I think is really slick.
355.00s: I love that a lot.
356.16s: That's why I actually started offering
358.12s: to be an affiliate for them, because I
359.32s: use them for a long time before that.
360.88s: And I was like, I like sharing good tools.
362.76s: But like I said, the video's not sponsored
363.96s: by them, it's just a solid product.
365.52s: But things like FOMC statements right now
368.48s: in the current market environment, they're massive.
370.40s: Have huge impacts on things.
372.56s: However, in 2016, the FOMC race statement
376.64s: didn't really have a whole lot going on.
378.68s: It didn't impact the markets that much.
380.80s: So you do have to be in tune with what's relevant at a given
383.60s: point in time and what the market cares about.
385.80s: Now, the last thing here, before we get
387.80s: into the rest of the checklist, is what does my portfolio need?
391.08s: Now, when we're scanning for trades,
392.48s: I always have a big process that's driven by this.
396.08s: And this belongs in your pre-trade checklist as well.
398.84s: And the primary reason is this.
400.36s: If you find the greatest trade that you've ever found,
404.04s: but your portfolio doesn't need that risk, it doesn't go on.
409.20s: That's all there is to it.
410.24s: So it's important to make sure that we're always keeping
412.80s: this portfolio concept in mind when we're
415.28s: looking at these different trades.
416.88s: OK, cool.
417.56s: So the next step here is hypothesis, generation, and confirmation.
422.12s: For me at this stage, I already know what the trade is
425.36s: that I'm thinking about putting on loosely.
427.24s: I haven't gone through the details of structuring it.
429.28s: But a couple of things I want to make sure I'm considering.
432.36s: The first one is, is this some sort of opportunistic trade
435.12s: or am I looking for specific exposure
437.64s: and to make sure that this trade fits this question?
441.60s: And still fits within the broader portfolio.
444.36s: This matters because the way that I size things,
447.80s: the way I scan for correlations for things,
450.76s: is really based on this.
452.36s: The next step here in hypothesis, generation,
454.92s: is what is your hypothesis, blanket,
458.28s: and how does the trade work?
460.64s: This is important because some traders
463.36s: have a hard time getting specific with this kind of stuff.
466.96s: And what I'm talking about is going back to this example,
469.56s: maybe you want to trade FedEx for some reason,
471.16s: and you think it's going to go up.
472.40s: Your hypothesis then would be, I am bullish in FedEx.
475.84s: I think it's going to go up potentially X number of points
480.24s: over the next X time frame.
482.80s: Those details are important specifically
484.96s: when you're trading options, because every single option
487.56s: of this trade you put on is time bound.
489.96s: So you have to get comfortable integrating
492.64s: a time element to your hypothesis.
495.32s: And this leads down to the next point,
498.64s: which is what is the breadth of analysis
501.56s: and does that line up with your hypothesis?
505.16s: So when you start going through this trade, again,
507.64s: for example, FedEx, we think it's going to go up.
510.20s: As I start overlaying my technical analysis,
512.88s: okay, I have an ascending nine day moving average,
515.84s: a gap between the nine, the 50 and the 200
518.16s: or widening, they're all positively sloping.
520.48s: It's near a plus two linear aggression channel,
522.60s: which I wouldn't love, yada yada yada.
524.44s: The whole point here is you might look at something
526.96s: and make a judgment call, but it's super important
530.08s: to go much further into detail to see and make sure
534.60s: that the confluence of evidence that you're looking at
537.16s: marries up beautifully with whatever your hypothesis is.
540.96s: And sometimes you might find out
542.48s: that what you originally thought actually
544.20s: doesn't look that great.
545.40s: And if you need some ideas on how I go about technical analysis,
548.64s: you could check out this video here.
550.12s: And if you couldn't tell, this beautiful handwriting
552.60s: is actually from a free download,
555.32s: which I'll also throw that in the notes below
557.32s: for you to check out to get this exact pre-trade checklist.
561.00s: You don't know I have to say that slow
562.20s: because I dork it up if I say pre-trade too fast.
565.40s: Yeah, pretty much a smooth brain.
567.00s: So now we get through this initial hypothesis orientation
572.00s: and now we get into the details of fitting a strategy.
575.12s: So we're bullish in FedEx over two months.
578.44s: What structure makes the most sense for this
581.08s: and what of my corresponding strategies should I lean towards?
584.88s: Then from there, I need to go through my typical
588.16s: trade setup protocols.
590.04s: I need to allocate to the trade.
591.88s: I then need to design my scaling protocols.
595.44s: I need to determine how I'm going to clearly state
599.40s: if my hypothesis is correct or incorrect.
601.88s: This is a really important part of this process.
605.16s: So for me, if I am bullish in FedEx
608.32s: and I say, okay, I'm going to trade it via a ratio
612.32s: called diagonal and I am going to use,
616.12s: let's say there's no near-term resistance.
618.96s: So I'm going to give it a little bit of room
621.12s: to the downside and say if it drops below 270
624.76s: near-term resistance, at least as far as I could see,
627.08s: then I know I'm wrong and I need to get out.
629.76s: This is creating a clear line in the sand on when I'm wrong.
633.48s: The other thing is time bound because again,
635.80s: options are time bound.
637.32s: So if I'm trading a ratio called diagonal
640.24s: and I buy something that's 120 days out,
642.64s: I already know based on that strategy,
644.64s: I'm going to manage it once it gets to the 60 day window
647.56s: on the long options.
648.88s: So there's an inherent baked in time element as well
652.72s: that disproves the hypothesis.
654.16s: Because if this goes sideways for 60 days,
656.80s: that's still wrong.
657.76s: I'm wrong, my hypothesis is not correct.
660.32s: So if you don't have that baked into the strategy,
662.32s: you should absolutely consider adding both a price
665.68s: and time element to this hypothesis concept.
668.52s: And that's actually the next bullet point.
670.04s: Beautiful, it's almost as if this is what I do.
673.16s: You don't say.
674.00s: And the last part here is kind of dovetailing off the scaling,
677.76s: but it's preemptively thinking about how you intend
680.12s: to capture profits and manager losses.
682.72s: And for me, it's going to be based on defining
686.28s: both of these generally before I enter the trade.
689.08s: I'm very strict about the losses.
691.52s: I'm a little less strict on the profits on some strategies
695.28s: like trend following strategies.
697.00s: But if it's a various risk premium style strategy,
699.20s: I'm going to be very strict on this as well.
701.08s: Because each of these individual trades
703.20s: really don't matter by themselves.
704.80s: It's how they operate in the conglomerate of a system.
707.60s: And it varies.
708.80s: You have to know what your individual strategies need.
711.48s: This gets its own section.
712.84s: So we've already, ideally, defined our P&L management.
717.16s: But in here is when you force yourself to outlight them
722.04s: in detail.
723.00s: That's it.
723.84s: That's why it gets its own section.
725.32s: Because nobody likes doing this,
726.68s: because this is when we have to face ourselves,
729.08s: we have to accept the fact that we might be wrong.
731.24s: And we have to plan for that scenario.
733.20s: And the last thing here, blind spot.
735.16s: This is just a quick way for you to sanity check
738.00s: what you're doing.
739.04s: And then before you click the button, you review your trade.
742.24s: There's no reason to fat finger a bunch of positions,
744.68s: because you're in too much of a rush.
746.00s: Things like that lead to just sloppy trading.
749.24s: And the way that you do one thing
750.76s: is the way that you do most the things.
752.80s: So looking at this at the end of the checklist,
755.68s: I'm just going to say, did I miss anything?
758.28s: Is there something that I think is important
761.60s: to this individual position?
763.28s: And did I not think of that?
764.84s: So it's literally just a quick ask of, what am I missing?
768.12s: Ideally, once you get through this, it's not much.
770.80s: But as always, if you have any comments, questions,
772.88s: concerns, let me know in the comments section below.
775.72s: Be an outlier.
777.24s: See you later.
