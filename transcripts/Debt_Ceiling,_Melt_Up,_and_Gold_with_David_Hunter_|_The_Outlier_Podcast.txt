2.22s: what's up everybody Eric here we are
4.62s: back with another outlier podcast and
7.80s: today I got David Hunter back again I
10.98s: think this is like your fifth or sixth
12.36s: time these are actually becoming really
14.40s: really cool for me to be able to see how
16.74s: things progress over our quarters you
19.02s: know in between conversations so welcome
20.58s: back yet again yeah thanks Eric glad to
23.76s: be back one of the interesting things I
26.04s: noticed from our conversations is unlike
28.56s: the the bull market like just about
30.96s: every time we talk there's some sort of
33.48s: Crisis or just crazy stuff going on that
36.78s: I'm really eager to get your opinion on
38.64s: and obviously the latest well the latest
42.48s: goes on and on but one of the things
44.34s: that's been in Vogue lately is the debt
46.14s: ceiling and I want to get your thoughts
48.72s: on that because here's the primary part
50.64s: I truly don't understand and this is the
52.98s: fun part of these is I get to ask really
54.60s: smart people questions and learn so when
57.66s: the federal government does their budget
59.76s: I feel like they have a general idea of
62.94s: our spend our run rate decent
65.04s: projections yet we almost always at
68.64s: least recently run into this debt
70.50s: ceiling problem where unless we pass
72.42s: something in a certain amount of time
74.58s: the government defaults on its debt why
78.00s: like why does that happen I don't
80.10s: understand why it always comes to this
82.08s: crisis moment is it down to the two
84.84s: sides kind of balking and trying to use
86.78s: the debt ceiling as a way to pass other
89.64s: initiatives or is there something
91.56s: economically intertwined that leads to a
94.02s: defunct between budgeting projections
96.60s: and then when it comes time for kind of
98.58s: the debt ceiling conversations
100.56s: yeah it's a good question I'll answer a
102.90s: few a few different pieces to it
106.44s: um years ago and I don't remember when
108.00s: the debt ceiling uh was put in there but
111.60s: they put it in to kind of put a some
114.90s: kind of a breaker on things to at least
117.00s: instill what they thought would be a
118.74s: little bit of a conscience or you know
121.74s: um some kind of limitation on our
124.20s: spending obviously it hasn't uh have
127.08s: worked that we've grown our deficits
129.66s: from you know sub trillion to 30 some
132.42s: odd trillion now so you know that that
135.24s: didn't work very well but
137.46s: um it was I think that was the intent
139.92s: initially was that if you have a ceiling
142.44s: you're gonna have to
144.78s: um consciously and with a vote come back
147.78s: to approve a higher ceiling so right but
150.96s: it's gotten silly because we we hit
152.70s: these ceilings so quickly every you know
155.28s: couple years and
157.50s: um and so you know there are people that
161.88s: are saying we shouldn't have the ceiling
163.62s: but you know it's it's a silly thing
165.36s: anyway where it's really you know you
168.42s: voted in a budget and you need to honor
171.78s: your you know if you're if you're going
174.12s: to have a budget and it exceeds you've
176.22s: got unless you want to default you've
178.02s: got to honor it so so you know it's
180.54s: almost an automatic you got to have the
182.58s: ceiling bumped higher I get that but the
186.12s: Republicans in particular have used the
188.76s: ceiling
189.78s: as something to at least give them some
192.78s: negotiating uh leverage versus a left
197.46s: that wants to just tax and spend right
200.28s: so I mean at least from my view
202.88s: Republicans haven't done a great job on
205.26s: Tesco will discipline themselves but
207.96s: if you're gonna look at two parties
210.72s: one is definitely tax and spend and the
213.18s: other one at least gives lip service and
215.04s: tries to some extent then still some
217.20s: discipline not very much these days but
219.66s: some so you know particularly in in the
224.04s: where we are now or the left has so much
226.68s: or the Democrats have so much power you
228.90s: know they control the Senate they
230.52s: control the the
232.62s: um
233.22s: presidency and they don't have you know
236.10s: and the Republicans are very small
237.80s: majority in the house you know the
241.38s: Republicans don't have a lot of places
243.24s: where they can gain leverage so the debt
246.72s: ceiling is something where some people
249.00s: say you shouldn't negotiate over there
250.50s: you should you know do a clean that's uh
253.38s: ceiling increase and you know negotiate
256.92s: the budget separately or in real in
259.56s: reality the house would not have much
262.32s: leverage and get anything you know to
264.78s: that be run over so they're trying to
267.48s: use this
268.62s: to instill a little bit of discipline
270.60s: and and I certainly from my perspective
273.24s: it's correct to try to put in some kind
276.18s: of limitations on future spending
279.42s: um and you know talking about one
281.10s: percent increases per year
283.86s: um in truth those increases are you know
287.10s: when we say we're only increasing one
288.90s: percent it's it's not truly a one
291.00s: percent increase it's a one percent over
292.74s: what we would normally increase right
294.60s: there's uh they build in so many
296.82s: automatic increases that it's it's kind
299.58s: of a silly comment say it's one percent
301.32s: but so they're not even really
303.12s: instilling tremendous discipline but in
305.58s: some and even that you know well the
308.28s: Biden Administration and the Democrats
310.08s: are blocking it because they feel
312.42s: they're in the driver's seat they want
313.98s: everything
314.88s: so and so what happens is you come down
318.84s: and we saw this in 2011 we've seen it in
322.02s: the past uh debt ceiling negotiations it
325.20s: and we've seen in frankly in almost
326.88s: everything it's uh you know you know the
329.94s: house of the Senate I mean the Democrats
332.22s: Republicans always come down to the last
333.78s: minute before they get budgets agreed to
336.66s: Etc so so I think this is no different
339.66s: you're going to come down to the last
341.34s: minute
342.18s: that's you know both sides are going to
343.98s: posture both sides are going to tell you
345.48s: that they're not giving in an inch uh or
348.48s: that there's very little they they can't
350.76s: see the other side's argument they think
352.56s: they have the the better argument and
355.32s: then in the end I think they'll they'll
357.90s: reach some kind of an agreement on it
360.54s: um you know that's part of part of it is
363.06s: silliness part of it is the art of
365.58s: you know this is what compromise is in
368.04s: in Congress and it just doesn't happen
370.14s: until you are forced to make it happen
372.48s: so you get a lot of rhetoric around that
375.90s: you know you get the media playing it up
378.42s: you get the Market's nervous over it
382.02s: um and there's always a possibility that
383.76s: you know they can't come to is that the
386.40s: the both sides get entrenched and you
389.22s: don't get an agreement initially and you
391.74s: do go past some deadline and you do run
394.98s: to do you know some payments not being
397.74s: made or what have you I think default is
400.20s: unlikely they'll probably they can they
402.90s: can go other places and not make you
405.00s: know not cover the outlays you know
408.90s: hopefully not Social Security or
410.52s: Medicare but it's a place like that they
412.32s: don't have they can pay their interest
413.88s: on their debt there's enough cash flow
415.62s: that they don't have to default on the
417.90s: debt
419.22s: um if if they understand the importance
421.26s: of maintaining that AAA and maintaining
423.66s: credibility in the world
426.24s: um so it's probably not a June 1
428.58s: deadline but it's going to get a lot
430.80s: Messier after June 1. so so the odds are
434.76s: we get an agreement I don't think
436.32s: they're really that far apart if
439.08s: um
439.68s: if the Biden Administration is willing
442.64s: to not feel like they got all the cards
445.86s: you know
447.12s: um it's silly after what we just spent
449.52s: in our last few bills because of the
451.92s: pandemic
453.00s: it's silly for them to say we we don't
455.16s: want to cut anything
456.30s: you know they they so so I think that's
459.72s: probably you know you're going to give
462.24s: your strongest
464.52s: um you're going to show your strongest
465.84s: cards first and then you know negotiate
468.72s: as you have to but so I'm I'm expecting
471.78s: the debt ceiling to be raised I'm
474.12s: expecting the house to get something
476.64s: they're probably not going to get all of
478.38s: what they have in their you know the bad
480.60s: budget they passed
482.70s: um
483.36s: and you may you may see the my
485.88s: Administration get something on the
487.56s: other side in terms of
489.30s: tax increases and some of the areas are
491.94s: cutting some loopholes you know from
494.58s: certain uh higher end income or
498.18s: corporate corporations what have you so
500.40s: I expect you're going to see compromise
502.20s: on this and it will happen but until it
504.78s: does we know we have a very
506.94s: dysfunctional government with two sides
508.80s: of don't agree on anything
511.98s: um you know pretty polarized so it's
514.62s: right for markets to be nervous until
516.66s: they see the likelihood of something so
519.72s: that's what we're going through and I
521.58s: think that's what we've been going
522.54s: through this week the markets
525.00s: um you know we're getting closer and
526.80s: it's still both side zoom and trench so
529.76s: markets get nervous you know that's what
532.38s: they do
534.06s: um so yeah that's you know that's the
537.00s: biggest thing hanging over us right now
538.74s: and it'd be easy to say ah you know we
541.20s: do this all the time just move past it
543.00s: but you really can because you know
545.04s: there's always that chance
547.20s: yeah and it's interesting you say
548.64s: there's always that chance because from
550.68s: like a trading perspective ever since we
553.92s: started going through these Cycles I
555.90s: started really carefully tracking the
558.12s: market around the debt ceiling
560.04s: discussion since because like since 2002
562.32s: to 2021 we've had like 20 of these
564.48s: conversations literally 20. and I
567.72s: started realizing these are actually
568.68s: pretty tradable events because bonds are
571.62s: pretty predictable leading into the
573.06s: conversation the Market's pretty
574.38s: predictable in terms of volatility
575.58s: leading into the conversation but
577.62s: there's always that Black Swan risk on
580.02s: the back end if if we did default and
583.50s: funny enough for that I typically will
585.90s: use teeny options I'll go far out of the
588.60s: money and I'll just scoop up some cheap
591.18s: options literally just in that it's a
593.70s: lotto it's just in case that happens the
595.92s: payout would be massive
597.90s: um so that's yeah what I will say though
600.12s: is that it's unlikely you know when we
602.40s: say default it'd be a temporary default
604.98s: they're not going to let this thing go
606.36s: very far you know if if one side or the
609.60s: other decides
611.04s: you know it's worth us to get something
614.00s: to hold our position and let it get past
617.10s: that deadline and see what you know get
619.38s: get people scared right yeah you could
622.26s: you know you could go past to a point
624.54s: where you know the ratings agencies say
627.00s: we're about to downgrade you because you
629.16s: guys haven't you know come to an
631.08s: agreement that's the only hasn't been
632.34s: raised or you know something else so you
635.70s: can have you know it may not be a June
638.28s: 1st deadline or it may not happen right
640.44s: you may not get the agreement right when
643.32s: you ideally should get it but they're
646.38s: not they're not going to go months
648.24s: beyond that and just watch the country
650.34s: fall apart you know they're the the
652.98s: agreement can be made there's there's
654.78s: definitely ability for the two sides to
656.82s: compromise and get this done
659.58s: um the sad part is and at the very least
662.40s: they can kick the can down the road a
664.50s: handful of months agree to some kind of
666.78s: a compromise short-term that you know
669.42s: gives them more time you so I I just
672.54s: don't see that this is a market moving
674.64s: event where you know there are people as
676.62s: you know out on the market
678.84s: um saying oh we're gonna this is what's
680.88s: gonna bring us down to 3200 or this is
683.16s: what's going to take us back to the lows
684.90s: of October I don't see that can we get
688.38s: you know can we get a few percentage
690.30s: points uh down go see percentage points
693.60s: down from here sure
695.58s: um I I doubt that we see 10 and on
698.58s: pretty positive we're not going to see
700.26s: 20 from this because it you know they
704.04s: can turn it around as soon as they want
705.84s: to it's just a matter of right they're
708.66s: they're posturing they're you know
709.98s: they're playing who who's gonna you know
712.08s: each one it seems silly to all of us
715.44s: bystanders but to them
718.32s: they they each want to win you know
720.66s: right who's going to get a win out of
722.34s: this
723.18s: um and and frankly we're the losers
725.16s: because they play that game but
727.80s: um so let's just followed I think it
729.90s: gives you more volatility but I don't
731.88s: think it's it's a game breaker anyway
734.52s: totally agree and that actually is a
736.56s: beautiful segue into my follow-on
737.94s: question which is if we typically know
741.36s: that on the back end there are these
743.64s: series of resolutions and we also
746.04s: because I completely agree with you the
747.90s: propensity for them to just let go of
749.76s: the wheel and let this thing crash is so
752.06s: unbelievably unlikely why do we even see
755.40s: the level of volatility that we do
757.08s: leading into these events because that
758.58s: really has baffled me because I
759.72s: typically trade volatility around bonds
761.88s: and markets into the announcement and I
764.58s: am well obviously you can't always
766.38s: completely isolate the volatility right
768.54s: there's other stuff happening in the
769.74s: world but it does seem to kick up around
772.80s: these debt ceiling conversations and it
775.26s: just confuses me as to why that even
776.76s: exists
777.90s: yeah well because there is uncertainty I
780.24s: mean it it does seem like the
782.16s: uncertainty gets overblown you know the
784.38s: media it should investors should be able
787.32s: to ignore the media and say hey we've
788.82s: been here before we see you know you
791.10s: guys always overreact Etc but there's
793.74s: still that uncertain you know
795.42s: uncertainty of what what could happen if
797.82s: this happens you know so that that's
800.58s: part of it and part of it certainly this
803.04s: time is where are you when you go into
805.32s: this and we're overbought you know we've
808.68s: had this run since October and of late
812.34s: we've had this run back up from below 4
815.46s: 000 up to 4200 so there was you know a
819.24s: bit of overbought and you were beginning
821.52s: to get people nervous that they were
823.50s: missing the market so there's more talk
825.72s: about
826.56s: and probably some activity in terms of
829.14s: people repositioning back for the upside
831.44s: so you were at a point where if if we
834.42s: were very oversold and this was going on
836.28s: you might have not seen this but because
839.16s: we were short-term overbought uh and
842.16s: they were becoming more Believers in the
843.96s: market because of the momentum
846.36s: um you know the the uh sealed debt
849.96s: ceiling
851.88s: um problem is an excuse to sell off I
855.54s: mean it gives you a reason to sell off
857.16s: so
858.54s: and before you commented a little bit on
861.00s: the capacity to serve as debt I'm
862.68s: curious what you make of the it's kind
865.92s: of out of the Limelight now but I'm
868.68s: still wondering your thoughts on the
870.42s: conversation about the reserve currency
872.34s: status of the dollar and the overall
873.84s: strength of the dollar what do you make
875.46s: of that dialogue
878.52s: um I think most of it keep in mind
880.26s: there's been there's been that school
882.30s: out there particularly the austrians
884.04s: that have been pushing this for a long
886.14s: time you know we've been talking about
888.00s: this for several years
890.40s: um so this is kind of they jump on this
892.80s: because of
894.66s: um you know what what obviously what
896.58s: China and Russia are doing what's the
899.04s: Saudis recently did with China you know
901.56s: all of that just fits into that
903.60s: expectation that hey the dollar is
905.64s: vulnerable and we're going to lose
907.70s: Reserve status so so that crowd is
910.86s: expecting it so this just feeds into
912.84s: what they're expecting
915.00s: um and others have jumped on to it
916.80s: because that's all over you know social
918.66s: media now and somewhat in Wall Street
921.90s: about that possibility I I continue to
925.44s: say and I've consistently said it for
927.18s: years I I think we can lose Reserve
930.36s: status down the road but I don't think
932.04s: it's in the next five years uh we will
934.98s: you know see it continually be eroded
937.50s: away some of this stuff independent
939.60s: deals and certainly we gave you know we
942.78s: gave our enemies an excuse or or more
945.54s: Firepower to go out and do this with
948.60s: using the dollar as kind of
951.30s: um a weapon you know we've we've
953.64s: weaponized a dollar in terms of trying
956.40s: to use it in the Ukraine war situation
959.10s: against Russia you know doing things so
962.52s: so I think I'm not sure we thought that
965.70s: through and I think we have hurt
967.62s: ourselves in that and I think the rest
970.38s: of the world even those that aren't
971.94s: having happened to them right now Sea
974.52s: House is a bit of a bully with the
976.02s: dollar you know we we have that power
978.00s: and we exercise it to get our way on
980.82s: things so so I I get where you know
984.30s: that's a risk
985.74s: I just don't think there's anything to
987.66s: replace it in the near term I think the
990.06s: IMF I didn't uh go farther than the
992.76s: headlines but I think the IMF uh
994.80s: commented in the last couple days about
996.30s: they don't see the you know dollar going
998.82s: away it's Reserve currency for any time
1000.68s: soon and
1002.24s: um and I would agree with that so
1004.70s: um and and kind of parallel to that as
1007.76s: you well know is this worry about a
1011.54s: um you know a digitized currency uh you
1014.30s: know a
1015.32s: um Central Bank currency uh or you know
1018.80s: coming out of that and I
1021.50s: that I have less
1024.50s: um
1025.28s: conviction on I I certainly am worried
1028.46s: about the the underlying agenda that
1031.58s: seems to be sweeping through this you
1033.62s: know New World ordered agenda whatever
1035.42s: you want to call it and this feeds into
1037.58s: that uh gives gives them more control
1040.46s: over the population and and the
1043.58s: population of money so I I hope we avoid
1046.46s: that for many years to come I think it's
1049.04s: dangerous
1050.78s: um you know Central Bank digital
1052.10s: currency but but uh I I don't have any
1055.40s: conviction in terms of timing for that I
1058.34s: I think the global bus that's coming
1061.46s: will Sidetrack any of that stuff they
1064.40s: may think they can introduce it in the
1066.14s: next year they're going to have so much
1068.24s: more on their plate that that I think is
1070.94s: going to get postponed so I don't know
1073.70s: when it comes I don't look forward to it
1076.28s: coming I think it's a
1077.96s: a huge danger
1080.42s: um and I hope we can keep kicking the
1083.06s: can down the road or keep fighting them
1084.92s: on it but uh that one I I don't feel as
1088.10s: confident I can say is you know more
1090.14s: than five years away
1091.46s: got him what do you make of the previous
1095.08s: earnings season as it pertains to the
1098.48s: overall strength of the market and then
1100.28s: more importantly do you think that
1102.80s: impacts the flow of funds into equities
1106.16s: out of equities
1108.44s: certainly earnings are a part of uh you
1110.84s: know a big part of what drives stock
1112.82s: prices
1114.62s: um and we've certainly had a hit to
1116.60s: earnings or decline in earnings in the
1119.54s: lab over the last 12 months because of
1122.72s: you know what's going on and with
1124.52s: Central Bank and interest rates Etc
1127.70s: um but what what the interplay is the
1130.88s: interesting part I think because what
1132.68s: you have as you well know there's a
1134.48s: quarterly game where the company's lower
1137.00s: expectations that when the reports come
1138.98s: out by then you know they're beating
1141.02s: expectations and that's what gets
1142.88s: reported an awful lot of the time
1145.64s: um but but I think the whole process is
1147.62s: why stocked discount things going in uh
1150.86s: you know
1151.76s: um you know one one particular Bearer
1155.18s: out there
1157.28s: um
1158.06s: who shall be nameless but I think you
1160.40s: can pretty much figure out who it is
1163.16s: um was really talking about first
1165.20s: quarter earnings being the Catalyst for
1167.06s: a move you know down to 3 500 or below
1170.60s: and
1171.86s: um and it didn't matter it didn't
1174.26s: manifest
1175.34s: and I think a lot of the number one I
1177.92s: think he overestimated the degree to
1180.92s: which the earnings were decelerating and
1183.74s: number two you know underestimated how
1186.74s: much has already been discounted I you
1189.56s: know my whole argument and you know I'm
1191.36s: called for melta my whole argument is
1193.82s: that the Market's not ignoring
1197.48s: um you know the what's going on in the
1199.82s: economy and just you know people
1201.88s: unfortunately particularly retail
1203.96s: investors think markets move on current
1206.96s: information I keep saying they discount
1208.52s: many months in advance six nine months
1210.68s: in advance you know last year's sell-off
1213.16s: was about what we're getting now you
1216.08s: know there's enough bleeding indicators
1217.94s: and things that you can look at to know
1219.74s: what's coming and so I think yeah we
1223.52s: bought them in October and what we're
1226.10s: doing now is we're
1228.38s: we have the first leg and first part of
1230.78s: that move up towards some you know final
1233.36s: highs that I'm calling for and we've
1235.88s: kind of gotten stuck in the train range
1237.86s: of you know the last few months because
1241.88s: everything you know earnings are not
1245.12s: moving forward there's you know the
1246.68s: central banks are not showing they're
1248.54s: ready to ease they're all that thing all
1251.24s: those things I think put the markets on
1253.34s: hold so they've been under trading range
1254.90s: with upward bias but a trading range I
1257.60s: think we pretty soon with the FED having
1260.60s: to I won't say capitulate by having to
1263.60s: you know move to the sidelines
1266.60s: um pause
1267.98s: um I think that's going to help uh as a
1270.98s: catalyst to move us up passes 4 200 I
1274.10s: think next stop is 42 4600 46.50
1278.54s: um
1280.30s: and uh from there you know I think we
1283.22s: keep going
1285.38s: still with you still out for a second
1287.18s: yeah I know exactly what that was but
1289.76s: yeah so yeah I got you at 46.50
1293.78s: um so one of the the things I'm curious
1296.96s: about when the last few times we've
1299.12s: talked we've kind of covered this idea
1300.86s: of the Melt up into the the bust and
1304.10s: definitely when we first started talking
1306.02s: about it the timeline is moved a few
1307.82s: times and new information comes out
1310.28s: that's part of the game so based on what
1313.58s: you're seeing now in like the current
1315.20s: markets where does your forecast stand
1318.68s: yeah it is true I mean I'm a moving
1321.92s: Target in terms of timing because it's
1324.26s: an end of cycle so yeah yeah and and
1327.38s: frankly it it frustrates Traders because
1329.84s: Traders are and even though I say don't
1332.24s: do it don't listen to me as a Trader
1334.46s: because of my timing is not going to be
1336.62s: right it's it's basically
1339.98s: um
1340.70s: just looking from a market standpoint
1342.86s: not the account but just the market
1345.08s: every time you get a consolidation it
1347.18s: extends things if a consolidation is a
1349.70s: month or two extends it or maybe a month
1351.62s: or two but if consolidations go on for a
1354.08s: while like they did last year
1356.60s: um it extends everything so
1359.06s: um and so I give some and maybe I'm I'm
1363.02s: the problem is I give some idea of what
1365.54s: could happen if this thing all falls
1367.52s: into place how fast it could happen but
1370.46s: I'm not saying that's that's some kind
1372.86s: of set time frame and and it's almost a
1375.74s: given that it's going to get extended if
1377.54s: the market extends so if if the consul
1380.18s: consolidations take time so right now
1382.88s: I'm kind of using late summer
1386.72s: um as the next time you know the where
1390.62s: everything if everything falls into
1392.00s: place if the rally gets going as soon as
1393.86s: I think it's going to which is you know
1395.92s: soon as soon as this thing you know this
1398.78s: next week or whatever the sell-off ends
1401.24s: the pullback ends
1403.46s: um you could get this back in the big
1406.04s: question is for me is 46.50 let's say or
1410.48s: maybe 40 even the old highs around 4
1412.88s: 800. if that's where the next step is
1415.48s: the real million dollar question from
1418.40s: there is do we get a sizable pullback of
1420.98s: say 10 I see some of you know
1423.86s: possibility of that and that could take
1426.68s: you you know a couple months and stretch
1429.56s: everything out if you if you instead
1432.28s: kind of you know pause at the highs and
1436.34s: then push right on through I think the
1438.56s: Melt up gets going very quickly and when
1440.72s: I think people don't understand is the
1442.58s: melt-up part of this
1444.20s: you could you could cover 2 000 points
1446.66s: in in you know
1448.94s: four to eight weeks so it's really it's
1452.36s: the the time that it takes to get to
1455.54s: that point where the Melt up really
1456.98s: kicks in is the UN unknowable you know
1460.10s: does it happen you know do we get 4 800
1462.98s: next month
1464.24s: and then uh spend three months or two
1467.78s: months pulling back before we go or do
1470.60s: we push through the new highs and that
1472.16s: gets everybody saying oh the bear
1473.78s: Market's over I'm going and you you get
1476.60s: that final search because you know this
1478.64s: is the last stage it's going to be once
1481.16s: it gets going it's going to be vertical
1482.68s: and so that's so I I think it's
1485.90s: definitely this year
1487.94s: um I think it's probably by Labor Day
1491.60s: um but if it pushed back beyond that
1493.64s: that doesn't bother me either
1495.86s: you know again it's the end of the cycle
1497.66s: it's also the and when I say end of
1499.88s: cycle it's the end of a 41-year bull
1502.52s: market cycle circular bull market cycle
1504.88s: yeah I'm not I'm not worried about
1507.08s: picking a precise time that that ends
1509.18s: it's it's you know we're on our way
1511.94s: so for like a 2 000 Point rally in eight
1516.02s: weeks or so that would at least from
1518.30s: here represent like a 50 gain something
1520.28s: like that
1521.36s: I think the question there is I mean
1524.18s: that's kind of an unprecedented move so
1526.40s: what what precipitates that what causes
1529.82s: that move is it the rakes I know last
1532.04s: time we talked about the conversation
1533.90s: around whenever the FED chooses to
1535.52s: finally pause which we're starting to
1537.32s: see some of that being priced into the
1539.00s: bond market
1540.62s: um I'm wondering like what's the primary
1542.06s: Catalyst here
1543.56s: yeah actually bond market in late day in
1546.62s: recent days has stopped pricing in that
1548.30s: they're pricing in you know more
1550.10s: concerned but I think it's over the debt
1551.78s: ceiling primarily you know you you had
1554.12s: and I've talked about it for not to jump
1556.16s: around but I've talked about for the
1557.78s: last
1559.22s: um month or two that there were there
1561.50s: are gaps up you know 10 year up around
1563.30s: 390 and even another one a little higher
1565.82s: uh in the third year up around four
1567.98s: percent and when the tenure was down at
1570.86s: you know 330 335 I said there's still a
1575.30s: possibility we might go back towards
1576.68s: four percent and that seems to be where
1579.14s: we're headed you know we got up to 375
1581.24s: yesterday
1583.16s: um so uh you know to me those things are
1586.82s: just you know you don't go in a straight
1588.74s: line uh you know the markets love to get
1592.22s: you looking one way and go the other
1593.72s: correct
1595.34s: um and so
1597.80s: um that's a part of it
1600.74s: um but I forgot what your question was
1603.74s: I'm curious about the Catalyst for like
1606.02s: 2 000 points essentially in a short time
1608.06s: frame yeah so so I think ultimately
1610.82s: you're going to have as the the
1614.38s: Tailwinds for this run will be first and
1617.90s: foremost
1620.18s: um the the FED going from tightening to
1624.14s: pause I don't you know it's possible
1626.66s: well during sometime during the Melt up
1629.18s: phase that they they you know things get
1632.60s: really ugly in the economy and they or
1635.24s: in the financial system and they say we
1637.04s: got to cut rates but more likely I think
1639.26s: they're going to be on pause
1641.18s: and pause to a lot of people is going to
1643.70s: be you know to the FED pause maybe we're
1646.58s: going to pause for a few months and see
1648.26s: what happens and then we may come back
1650.42s: and tighten but I think a lot of
1652.82s: investors are going to hear pause as the
1654.80s: fed's taking cycle is over
1657.68s: and I can't stress enough that the all
1661.10s: the bearishness that we've had from the
1663.44s: end of 2021
1665.24s: to now
1666.68s: has been driven and and the talk of
1669.02s: bearishness even six months prior to
1670.82s: that you know middle of 2021 we started
1673.28s: talking about the need for fat
1674.78s: tightening
1676.04s: that's been a headwind for the market
1679.16s: for you know basically a year uh I
1682.82s: should say basically almost two years
1684.50s: you know a year and a half
1686.48s: um and so if you remove that if
1689.18s: investors say wow tightening's ending
1692.60s: that I think people underestimate how
1695.06s: important that is now I know there's a
1697.34s: chart out there saying when the FED Cuts
1699.32s: rates
1700.28s: that's time to get bearish right you've
1703.16s: seen that chart that you know past
1705.26s: Cycles
1706.76s: um but pause is cutting rates pauses
1709.04s: just just giving investors reason to
1712.28s: believe the FED may be ending tightening
1714.50s: and for
1716.48s: for knowledgeable institutional
1718.58s: investors the end of tithing they can
1720.98s: then and and the beginning of ease they
1723.38s: can then look over the trough and say
1726.26s: with a six to month nine month lag we
1729.92s: can now start factoring in increases in
1733.46s: earnings we can now factor in a new
1735.92s: cycle a recovery cycle so that's why
1738.44s: that's also important and that will be a
1740.36s: big Tailwind along with that I expect uh
1744.38s: will be a big decline in a dollar I
1746.90s: think the dollar you know has been
1748.28s: backing up here short term came down 14
1750.86s: points it's it's risen you know two and
1753.20s: a half points that could go another
1755.24s: point or two but ultimately I see the
1758.84s: dxy down to 95 6 uh very quickly you
1763.34s: know during the next two three months
1765.80s: um and then might pause it there and
1768.32s: before it hits a lot lower than that so
1770.42s: the dollar is going to be I think a big
1772.76s: Catalyst or a big tailwind and then also
1776.48s: interest rates once they get done with
1778.76s: this backup and I think we're 90 of the
1782.42s: way through the rate backup you're gonna
1785.36s: then head for my target is 250 as the
1788.24s: next place where the tenure goes so if
1791.00s: you're up let's say you're up at four
1792.32s: percent that's a you know it's 150 base
1795.26s: Point drop in rates
1797.06s: uh probably this summer so you know you
1800.66s: get rates on your side you get the
1802.70s: Dollar on your side you get the FED on
1805.22s: your side
1806.30s: and and the one that I think is not
1810.86s: economic but it certainly is a big
1812.60s: factor is then you got momentum and
1815.18s: momentum may be the biggest thing that
1816.86s: drives people and pulls people into the
1819.20s: market everybody can talk about
1820.76s: fundamental reasons for why they're
1822.56s: bullish or bearish
1824.12s: basically if you look at you know look
1827.72s: at Twitter or look at anywhere watch
1829.70s: listen to investors most of it's driven
1832.22s: by momentum they're bearish when the
1834.20s: Market's going down they're bullish when
1835.64s: the Market's breaking above resistance
1838.84s: yep it will be a big part of it so they
1842.60s: can talk all they want about being and
1844.88s: and you could you could
1846.92s: um track this yeah you can listen to all
1849.44s: the investors all the pundits who are
1851.96s: bearish
1853.04s: because the Market's heading down right
1855.08s: now
1855.74s: if that thing pushes above 4200 and
1858.44s: certainly above 4 300 those same guys
1861.44s: that are so sure we're going lower are
1863.54s: going to be so sure we're going north at
1866.96s: that point because you know whether they
1869.12s: whether they even know it themselves
1870.62s: they're driven by the tape
1873.98s: last question I know we're at time but
1876.50s: the David Hunter precious metal Mafia
1879.80s: will murder me if I don't ask you about
1882.02s: Metals I've learned this the hard way
1884.90s: um last time we spoke you were looking
1886.34s: at 3 000 on gold this was back on 23
1889.58s: January you were looking at 3 000 in
1892.10s: Gold 50 to 60 for silver gold it looks
1894.68s: like we've gotten a bit of that rally
1895.94s: same for silver but how does
1899.42s: how do those targets stand and again
1902.18s: just succinctly you know not to take too
1904.16s: much your time but like what's the
1905.12s: Catalyst for us to complete the move
1906.74s: yeah I think I I'm glad you asked
1908.96s: because I think it is an important part
1910.88s: of the market and I think we're very
1913.52s: close to a huge turn
1916.52s: um it's it's been frustrating for both
1920.06s: gold and silver investors no question
1921.92s: you know they have I I consider gold and
1925.64s: silver to be the most undervalued sector
1928.52s: of the market and
1931.28s: um and a lot that's because they've
1933.68s: underperformed so long gold
1935.00s: interestingly the metal gold you're
1937.40s: right it's pushing up pushed up against
1939.50s: the highs actually ticked up to the
1941.54s: highs all-time highs so it's not like
1944.60s: it's acting poorly but it's had a
1946.88s: pullback of late so we're back down uh
1950.06s: you know
1950.92s: 1966. yeah so I think I think maybe 1940
1956.84s: 50 is is where I think it turns
1959.78s: so if we're that close I mean basically
1962.72s: that can happen in an hour a day so I
1966.62s: think we're very close to a turn and so
1968.72s: we'll track that Silver's pretty close
1970.82s: too to what I would call a level
1974.54s: um and so my my ex my near-term
1977.30s: expectation is that you see you know
1979.40s: gold push through those highs and then
1981.74s: you know it'll find a level whether it's
1983.60s: 23 4 500 probably closer to four or 500
1987.26s: 24 or 500 where it might have to pause
1989.84s: again but I still see 3000 this year I
1993.56s: still see uh silver at 60.
1997.70s: um Silver's a harder one because of the
1999.92s: farther to go a lot farther to go of
2001.54s: course in a bull market in a metal bull
2003.46s: market silver will outperform gold but
2005.86s: that's a big L performance and uh so you
2010.18s: know 35 is kind of a natural place where
2012.52s: it could get to where it runs in some
2014.20s: resistance once it pushes through there
2016.42s: I think you're gonna see it really gain
2018.04s: momentum and and get up to 50 and then
2020.68s: 60.
2022.24s: um so but it doesn't yeah I don't want
2024.16s: people to get ahead of themselves and
2025.66s: think that it just runs from you know 23
2028.90s: where it's at now to 60 without any
2031.72s: stair steps it's gonna you know it's
2033.40s: gonna have pauses along the way uh and
2036.22s: pullbacks along the way so but but I
2039.28s: think those are areas that are going to
2041.62s: be front and center in the Melt up
2044.50s: um I think cyclicals in general you
2046.36s: didn't ask this but
2048.22s: um I think cyclicals in general in this
2050.98s: last three month pullback where
2053.02s: everybody's talking about the the
2054.88s: narrowness of the rally you know up
2057.28s: until today you know it was a rally you
2060.04s: know we were 4 200 just a couple days
2061.66s: ago
2062.86s: um and it was driven by the fangs and by
2065.62s: you know a handful of
2067.60s: um you know Tech
2069.10s: the technology stocks that are growth
2071.68s: stocks because the economies you know
2074.38s: people are worried about the economy and
2077.08s: you know the girl stocks aren't that's
2079.54s: not so important what the economy is
2080.98s: doing so so they have and they were very
2084.04s: they came into this year very oversold
2086.44s: very undervalued or at least had come
2088.96s: down more than anything else so they've
2091.00s: had reason to Rally I think cyclicals
2094.30s: which had a pretty good early this year
2096.34s: you know they ran in January and and
2099.40s: they have been consolidating their gains
2102.22s: for a while
2103.84s: um several months they look poised for
2106.72s: big returns or big moves up here so I
2110.02s: think you can see a much broader Rally
2112.00s: from here
2113.68s: um with cyclicals doing well copper
2115.98s: interestingly to me has come down to a
2119.20s: pretty good trend line and uh pretty
2121.48s: important trend line and I I suspect
2123.82s: copper is going to do very well in this
2126.16s: run to the top
2128.32s: um you know Industrials should do pretty
2130.36s: well Housing Home Builders are
2132.46s: surprising everybody they didn't
2133.60s: surprise me because I I so as rates are
2135.88s: coming down down you're going to see
2138.10s: another bounce in housing it doesn't
2139.84s: mean you're going to see new highs in
2141.16s: home prices but you're going to see
2143.02s: activity pick up this spring and I said
2144.88s: that you know late last year when look
2148.90s: crummy for you know housing
2151.66s: um and that's what you're seeing I think
2153.28s: the home builders have outperformed this
2155.20s: year they've pulled back of late just
2157.66s: recently the last couple days but
2161.14s: um I do expect new highs on home
2162.76s: builders
2164.38s: um I think airlines are are waking up
2166.66s: here I think you're hearing talk of a
2169.00s: pretty good summer season for the
2170.56s: airlines travel season so
2173.56s: um and with oil down where it is uh
2176.62s: that's a benefit to Airline so you know
2178.78s: you got a lot of areas that have been
2180.64s: out of favor for a long time that can
2182.68s: they don't have to they don't have to go
2184.60s: Sky High but if they have big rallies
2187.18s: off a pretty low bases that can be a big
2190.66s: contributor to you know where the
2192.58s: indexes go
2194.32s: um and of course you know I continue to
2196.72s: push uh continue to talk about the semis
2200.68s: um you know and Nvidia against all the
2202.84s: focus but you know there's others you
2205.66s: know even even you know the you know the
2208.54s: kind of uh commodity to decide you know
2211.90s: the chip the commodity chips like uh
2214.90s: Micron you see and you're seeing uh
2217.42s: things pick up and I you know SMH
2221.86s: um I think can go to 400 and I think
2223.60s: that's a low low Target I would expect
2226.78s: it probably to exceed my target so you
2229.72s: know there's there's plenty of Runway
2231.34s: here ahead to drive this melt up
2235.54s: I dig it yeah Nvidia is reporting right
2237.40s: now too I'm curious how they do
2239.68s: yeah that is it is it out I don't know
2241.96s: yeah I I didn't see the press release
2244.96s: yet but they're they're after the market
2246.88s: yeah you should be out at any time yeah
2248.74s: yeah they should be really soon well I
2252.10s: gotta say David as always it really is a
2254.14s: pleasure I I get to learn a lot about
2256.06s: how you view the markets the economy
2257.92s: connect dots it's like really
2259.72s: educational and I want to continue to
2261.82s: implore people the I think some of the
2264.58s: most
2265.48s: thoughtful value that you provide is how
2269.20s: to view relationships between things and
2272.08s: I think people should really key into
2273.64s: that into the conversation so before we
2275.86s: sign off though for the people that want
2277.54s: to look you up how can they get a hold

2291.10s: my interviews is there are a lot of fake

2301.30s: have under a thousand and sometimes
2303.76s: under you know a few hundred so you know
2306.82s: uh it's kind of the
2309.70s: um the nuisance that anybody with a big

2339.10s: username the handle at Dave H contrarian
