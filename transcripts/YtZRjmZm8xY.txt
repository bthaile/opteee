0.00s: What's up, you guys? Take another look at roaring kiddie's position from yesterday, because
6.00s: I was in the middle of making a video. He dropped his position and I shared a hypothesis
10.44s: that I don't think is accurate. So I want to walk through what I'm seeing, what it could
14.76s: mean, and essentially why nobody can tell definitively what's going on here. Now, a
20.32s: couple of things. You guys have been sharing so much of the background of roaring kiddie,
25.60s: the way he behaves, which is actually really useful for me. And one of the things you guys
28.64s: said is, hey, he seems to exercise his options lock. He'd take another look and absolutely.
33.32s: And as we take a look at this, it absolutely could be the case, but it's kind of a bit
38.56s: of a stretch in different ways, depending on the scenario we're looking at, but some of
41.88s: them are very plausible. So let's quickly recap what his position was on the 10th of June,
47.36s: which is long 5 million shares at $21.274. And he was long 120,000 of the 20 calls at $5.67
57.64s: 4 cents. Now, a couple of things right out of the gate. These are big positions. When
61.76s: you're trading 5 million shares, 120,000 contracts of options, you don't just enter a single
67.40s: order to get into that position. It's something that you scale into over time. And the reason
73.12s: being is you don't want to bid yourself up. The other thing is in order to get essentially
78.12s: reasonable fills instead of just getting killed by submitting some sort of market order
84.60s: to get a fill at that, you again, would scale into the position over some time. So that
89.80s: tells us an important fact, meaning he averaged into these positions. We can also determine
97.32s: that and confirm it by the fact that there's more than two decimals on all these prices,
101.72s: meaning the average price paid varied more big positions scaled into over time. I'll
107.16s: kind of checks out. The reason why that matters is because that tells us specifically on these
111.68s: calls that some of the premium he paid was above this price. Some of it was below this price.
118.08s: How much higher and how many of those contracts we don't know and same thing to the downside.
123.52s: So it makes it really, really difficult to pinpoint what the premium he would have paid on the
129.36s: exercised options, which is what we're using to try to determine if that's what he did.
135.20s: So I'll show you what I mean by that. Now, a really probable scenario here is that he could have
141.12s: exercised 40,000 in 10 of those 20 calls that accounts for the number variance here. It doesn't
149.28s: account for the cost variance here, which is important. It could, but it doesn't outright equate,
156.72s: which is unfortunate because if it did, it would have been a much easier problem. But I guess
160.08s: that would have been less fun at least for me because I like looking at this stuff. So we'll
164.96s: kind of walk through the math of that. Now, one of my favorite scenarios that I have to give a
169.44s: shout out, just because it's so off the top rope is this scenario that he might have sold all
175.36s: 5 million shares and then exercised 90,000 in 10 options, which we'll take a look at that scenario
182.80s: as well. I think that's probably lower probability, much lower, but not again, impossible.
189.76s: So let's take a look at some math. What I did up here is show you the original position on the
197.28s: 10th of June for the equities and then the same thing on the 13th of June. Now, one important
203.68s: admin note is actually when you multiply his new basis of 23 4135 by 9,000,000 shares, it's
212.00s: crazy to use these sides of a positions in GameStop for retail trader. It's hilarious to me.
218.16s: But as you do that math, it actually doesn't come out to this. It comes out to like 210, 74,
223.60s: 9 and change. The reason why that matters is because I'm using what he has here on the platform,
232.00s: which might account for some other costs or whatever the case is. I can't say for sure, but just
238.16s: noting that variance. So if we take a look at the difference between what his equity position was
244.32s: and what it became, we can figure out essentially how much he bought and how much he bought per share.
249.28s: So in this case, the cost variance between these two is 104, 374, 465. The share delta we already
256.08s: know is 4,000,000,000. So that comes out to a cost per share of $26.9. Now, let's take a look at this
264.00s: scenario here where we exercise 40,000 in 10 options. That essentially brings us to a slightly
272.16s: different number. The combined assigned or exercise basis in this case would be $25, $67.54.
280.72s: We're taking the strike price, adding the premium. This is what the broker would calculate within
285.36s: the platform here. This is different than what the exact transaction costs would be for the shares
292.08s: on the market, which would be at the strike price. But after these shares are added at the $20 purchase
298.64s: price, the broker could then marry the premium paid in the scenario. So that leads us to 25,
306.48s: 67, 54, which is quite a bit off on a percentage basis as well from this $26.09. It might not seem
313.20s: like a lot of $41, but that's definitely a lot on a relative basis. And if we take a look at that
319.44s: exercise cost in the scenario of 40,000 and 10 contracts, the cost variance between what we see now
329.84s: as the difference between these two, which is 104, 374, this would show it as 102, 727.
338.96s: Close, but still off by $1.65 million. That's not an insignificant amount of money.
346.64s: Now, this could be explained by the fact that this is a small subset of this 120,000 lot position.
355.76s: It's essentially a third. So because it's a smaller subset, depending on whether he's using first and
361.84s: first out, FIFO or LIFO last and first out, and depending on the relative cost on the premium of
367.92s: the options that he happened to have exercised, this is not outside the realm of possibility for
374.48s: this 41 cents to come out here. It's not crazy. And because this is a smaller subset of this,
381.44s: that absolutely means that there can be a higher variance from the average. So that's within the
387.84s: realm of possibility for sure. Now, another scenario somebody threw out the crazy one I like is exercising
394.32s: 90,000 and 10. The problem is the variance is massive. Now, this is wrong here. This shouldn't be
400.64s: comparing it just to the equity. It should be comparing the total cost in this scenario.
405.76s: So the total cost here would be 231, 104, 275 and his cost was 210, 744. So that's a big variance.
415.28s: I just probably wouldn't see that happening because the other thing is it would not account well
421.76s: at this point because now instead of it just being essentially a third, it becomes three quarters,
427.60s: 90,000 and 10 to the 120,000. So then the probability there of a big variance from this average price
434.32s: goes down. So I don't see that one quite as plausible in this scenario. So all of this is to
440.96s: summarize a few things. One, we don't know definitively, two, he absolutely could have exercised
446.16s: some number of contracts and bot shares. He also absolutely could have simply sold all of this
452.48s: and then bot shares because if we take a look at the price of GameStop over the period that he
456.96s: would have been buying shares, it was trading all around essentially this exact basis, the 2609.
462.72s: So it's entirely possible. We don't fully know and the impact doesn't seem to be severe at
469.92s: least as of now because when we take a look at the way that GameStop behaved today, really inside
475.84s: day, it had lower than average volume. This is looking at a 22 day period for the average just to be
482.48s: clear. And it was mostly sale volume today. We also saw just in terms of price of very inside day.
489.52s: The range for today was 1186. The five day average daily range was 2524. And the 11 day average
498.00s: range is 3252. So pretty significantly less than those other reference periods.
504.48s: Now if we take a look at the options chain quickly and we go to roaring kitty strikes, I still think
509.60s: this 20 strike is his all the same. He put his print on it. It still has a lot of open interest. 64
517.36s: thousand seven hundred and eighteen contracts. Now a big drop from yesterday, which we expected,
521.92s: 58,145 and a lower volume today of 12,468. But there's still people in this for sure.
528.24s: And it's super deep in the money at this point. It's one delta. Now there are a couple other
533.52s: centralizations that I see at the 30s. There's 57,802. But today there was massive volume. 46,010. We
541.68s: don't know if that's opening or closing just yet. But that's just something to note. So either
546.72s: this number will probably go up pretty significantly or start to contract. My guess is probably the
551.68s: latter, but we don't know. And same thing for a couple other these noteworthy strikes like the 35
558.72s: and also the 40. The other thing I see here is the implied volatility across these
565.04s: expiration cycles is contracted massively. It's cratered. This was above 300 before. And now it's
572.56s: below 250. Same thing for essentially the next few series. The other thing I notice here is that
578.80s: if we look at the call open interest compared to the put open interest. If you look at the
583.12s: videos that we did the past few days, these used to be much bigger disparity for the calls.
589.76s: Even excluding Roaring Kiddie's position, there was still a lot of participation skewing this.
594.24s: These are now starting to normalize. We typically would see more puts than calls. People tend to
599.52s: hedge to the downside with options rather than speculate to the upside in mass at least. Obviously
604.48s: an anomaly here that we're looking at. So it looks like there's still a little bit more to the story.
610.40s: Perhaps Roaring Kiddie will let us know, but he also is the master of mirrors. He has my head in a
615.52s: blender trying to figure out what's going on here. And it's super fun to try to figure it out. So
620.16s: I'm really thankful to learn a long you guys about the history of this stuff and talk about
626.48s: options. So thanks for sharing so much with me. If there's anything else that I can help with or
631.28s: if any questions you guys have just let me know. And see you guys later.
