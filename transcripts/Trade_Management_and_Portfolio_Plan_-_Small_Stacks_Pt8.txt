0.64s: hey everyone eric here with a few
2.40s: updates to the small
3.92s: stacks portfolio so i wanted to
7.12s: give you a couple updates on some trades
9.28s: that i made
10.48s: and then just some new adjustments kind
12.48s: of to the overall approach
14.00s: so let's take a look at the uh
17.28s: screen here first off i talk about
21.36s: most folks first year trading and i i
24.24s: always say that the main goal should be
26.48s: consistency and being profitable
30.48s: okay so that part aside what i wanted to
34.08s: do
34.72s: is set some goals now that
38.40s: this account's been trading for a couple
41.12s: weeks we kind of have an idea of what
42.64s: this looks like for us
44.32s: so the first goal that i think is
46.56s: reasonable
47.52s: if i were to give myself a goal starting
49.52s: out again with the five thousand dollars
51.60s: i would probably target something like
53.12s: eight percent i think is fair
55.12s: and then my stretch goal would be 15 for
58.16s: the year
59.28s: and the reason why i like
62.48s: those really that that eight percent is
65.60s: smaller accounts have a hard time
69.20s: returning kind of meaningful amount of
71.12s: money so that's why i want to focus on
72.48s: the percent
73.28s: not so much the dollar amount and the
76.00s: reason why i say that is because
77.92s: you know if you look at returning eight
80.08s: percent on a five thousand dollar
81.36s: account it's
82.00s: 400 bucks you know who really cares same
83.92s: thing at 15
85.84s: and then what i even did is broke that
87.52s: down to a monthly target
89.20s: so if i wanted that eight percent it
91.12s: means i would need to make 34 dollars a
93.12s: month
93.76s: and for 15 at 63 a month
97.28s: all of those in and of themselves really
100.48s: don't mean that much the reason why
103.84s: i continue to pound on this
107.04s: you know drum
110.08s: reiterating over and over and over again
112.64s: that
113.20s: this small account isn't the account
115.52s: we're trying to grow
116.96s: you need more money if you want to
119.92s: really make money investing
121.52s: you need more money than five thousand
122.96s: dollars you're not going to turn this
124.16s: into your nest egg
125.60s: so what i'm truly focusing on is
128.16s: developing
128.96s: a consistent approach that i know i can
131.60s: apply
133.04s: and the reason why that becomes powerful
136.56s: is as this slowly starts to more from
140.32s: a 5 000 to a 50 000 to a 250
144.32s: 000 to a 500 000 account to a 1 million
147.60s: dollar account to a 2 million
149.60s: account all of a sudden these all
153.12s: these figures start to mean something
156.24s: so for example
159.36s: if you're using something like a 1.25
162.96s: million dollar account whenever you get
164.64s: to that space
166.56s: if you can still return that same eight
169.76s: percent
170.40s: that you're building the skill set for
172.32s: now instead of that
174.16s: being you know four hundred dollars for
175.76s: the year that's gonna be a hundred
176.88s: thousand dollars for the year
178.08s: so you're gonna make again if you can
181.28s: maintain consistency you're going to
184.08s: make
184.56s: 8 300 a month
187.60s: so my point is focus on the skill set
191.84s: let this account continue to grow this
194.00s: will help you
195.12s: modestly move towards that goal but if
197.92s: you're first starting out with pretty
199.28s: much anything less than 100k
201.36s: you you really need to focus on saving
203.52s: money because once you start getting
205.36s: over 100k that's when
207.04s: the amount of money that you can make
208.88s: starts to
210.08s: really help compound your growth but
213.28s: when you first start out it's still
215.20s: going to compound but
216.64s: it's relatively small and it's important
219.60s: to understand the the context of all
221.52s: this
222.32s: and then if you sit there and you say
224.56s: well what the hell's the point just
225.92s: remember
226.48s: right now a cd account i just looked him
228.48s: up rates today the
229.76s: a one-year cd the the highest i could
231.76s: find is
232.96s: 0.9 percent so if you take that 5 000
236.72s: you put it in a cd account you get 45
238.80s: for the year
239.76s: so for the for the younger folks that
243.12s: look at this and they scoff
244.88s: at the figures because it's a low amount
246.64s: i totally understand and identify with
248.80s: you
249.44s: you gotta you really gotta focus on the
251.44s: bigger picture here
252.56s: this isn't you're not going to turn five
254.24s: thousand dollars into your next big sum
256.08s: of money
256.56s: you're right now we're building a skill
258.96s: set
259.76s: that as your money slowly grows via
261.92s: investing and most importantly
263.68s: as you're saving that this is the skill
266.80s: set that's going to help you it's
268.00s: not going to be too many folks want to
270.16s: make to
271.44s: i think too much money on
275.04s: whatever they have and it just leads to
277.92s: a completely
280.32s: untenable approach that doesn't really
282.96s: help us
283.68s: when it comes time to start delivering
286.16s: on a larger sum of money so
288.24s: just keep that in mind so here's what i
290.80s: wanted to talk about in the portfolio
292.56s: this
292.88s: is what we're looking like these days
296.32s: i closed out pfizer yesterday that was a
299.36s: 402 dollar
300.72s: profit in total which is a good trade
303.04s: for that
304.40s: so if we take a look right now
307.84s: um total p l in the account is
313.88s: 557
315.04s: actually no it should be a little bit
316.16s: more than that um
318.56s: total pin p l in the account should be
320.80s: five
321.68s: 581 dollars i forgot to add the
324.72s: um coverage strangle to the p l so that
327.68s: that needs to get updated
329.36s: so we made 402 in
332.72s: the pfizer trade as a whole we made 155
336.48s: in kroger right now realized p l
339.52s: and then in xlf we made 24 bucks
342.64s: so all in all we're at 581 dollars
345.60s: profit which is
346.56s: about 10 return a little over which is
349.36s: really good you know
350.32s: starting on a 5k count essentially two
352.56s: weeks in
353.44s: that's something that i i think is great
355.52s: performance and
356.72s: i would you know hope i would love to
359.20s: maintain it but i
360.88s: totally expect there to be a little bit
363.28s: of pain along with this
365.44s: so right now we're pending
369.84s: what is it a hundred and nine dollars
374.24s: that's out which represents about a two
376.00s: percent return on the current
378.32s: account value of 55.81
381.36s: so overall i am pleased with where the
384.64s: account looks
386.00s: utilization is just over 3 000 which is
389.12s: just shy of 54 utilized
392.48s: and that is one of the beauties of
394.08s: trading the way that i trade is i'm
396.00s: continuing to make a really good return
397.84s: on the account
398.56s: and as i'm starting to make money and
400.24s: find opportunity i don't have to utilize
402.48s: as much to get there
404.08s: so what i did end up doing today is
406.16s: establishing
407.12s: a new call diagonal in bank of america
411.44s: so i am now long the 18 june 21
415.44s: 18 calls paid 8 dollars that's an 81
418.00s: delta
419.12s: and then i sold this 16 october 26 calls
422.40s: at 82 cents so that's going to be a
424.24s: little over 10
425.20s: return on invested capital for that
426.80s: trade would be pleased
428.80s: to make that money that's something that
431.36s: you know is
431.92s: completely reasonable for this account
434.16s: now of note
436.08s: kroger still has no short calls on it i
439.20s: have not put any short calls on the
441.28s: trade because although i can still make
443.20s: a little money on the short calls
445.28s: it's not enough for what i would want to
447.76s: make i want to make sure i stay
449.52s: at the 35 strike
452.64s: to be above my critical strike on the
454.96s: shorts
455.84s: so i'm i'm essentially waiting until i
458.40s: can make more money and i'm okay with
459.92s: that there's there's no
461.76s: real pressure on me in that position
465.12s: right now
465.92s: it's showing the leaps are showing
467.68s: obviously a loss
469.36s: but just takes a little time for the for
472.08s: the trade to start working out we
473.52s: already made 155 dollars in the short
475.92s: call so
476.96s: we have some time to go in here and
479.12s: remember
480.08s: this kroger trade i allocated fifteen
483.20s: hundred dollars for
484.16s: and we're about allocated because i
485.60s: scaled in a little bit whereas on the
487.76s: bank of america trade i'm also
489.44s: allocating
490.56s: fifteen hundred dollars but we only have
492.16s: a one lot i'm expecting to scale into
494.48s: this trade as well
495.84s: once we have some time so again of note
499.84s: for bank of america it's at a one-to-one
501.84s: ratio i typically don't like to do that
504.16s: but again small account we're
506.24s: constrained by capital
507.52s: i'm starting with the one lot expecting
509.36s: to scale into at max atula on the calls
512.80s: the long calls so it is what it is
516.40s: once i am able to have two long calls i
519.84s: likely will only sell
521.20s: one call against to unlock that upside
524.72s: now bank of america does have earnings
527.04s: coming up
528.00s: on the six on the 14th of next month and
530.64s: my expiration is for the 16th
532.72s: so what i'll end up doing is taking
534.32s: those short calls down before earnings
536.72s: and probably laying out additional short
539.04s: calls on earnings
540.72s: or very close to earnings so that i can
543.28s: capitalize
544.08s: on the increase implied volatility for
546.08s: that expiration cycle
548.40s: and see if we can make a few extra
550.48s: dollars
551.52s: again on the smaller account because
553.36s: that's what the name of the game is
556.00s: so right now this is what our leap or
558.96s: our call diagonal looks like in bank of
560.80s: america
561.76s: notice no upside risk to this diagonal
565.92s: testament to the way that i structure
567.36s: them so that there is no upside risk
569.52s: focusing on delta management
571.44s: and then once we're able to add another
574.72s: leap
575.36s: or these aren't leaps once i'm able to
577.44s: add another long call at some point
579.12s: this is more what it will look like but
581.60s: as of right now we're going to stick
582.88s: with one long
583.92s: and then scale into the position in the
585.84s: future so
587.36s: that about wraps up where i'm at in the
590.32s: small stacks portfolio
592.08s: a few things that i want to make sure
595.04s: are
595.60s: you know taken into account as we get
597.44s: closer to the election
599.12s: i am going to continue scaling out out
601.12s: of all of my accounts including this one
603.60s: and it's just because i view that as a
605.28s: very large binary event
607.12s: the market has been extremely emotional
609.28s: so i will continue to maintain
611.84s: exposure as i always do but i will be
614.40s: mindful what i have out leading into it
617.12s: because i just don't want to expose
619.92s: myself to that risk
620.96s: i i don't see a good return on that risk
624.16s: so i will be following through with that
627.12s: as we
627.68s: continue along so if there are any
630.40s: questions
631.04s: or any any trade ideas anything like
634.08s: that feel free reach out let me know i
635.84s: still have
637.28s: two thousand dollars to use in this
639.12s: account a little over close to twenty
640.48s: five hundred bucks so
641.68s: plenty of opportunity to be had once i
643.68s: see it but i am
645.12s: not forcing any trades because i don't
647.68s: need to
648.16s: right now we're maintaining good
650.24s: progress
651.52s: we're um at a good good return on the
654.24s: account so i'm i'm happy where things
656.24s: are right now
657.28s: all right until next time i'll catch
658.96s: everybody later
