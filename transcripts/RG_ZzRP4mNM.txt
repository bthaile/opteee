0.00s: What's up, outliers? Today's video is all about GameStop because we had a couple things
5.04s: happen today. I will do the standard market update later today during the options trading
10.00s: for beginners workshop. But yeah, there was just a couple of things in here that I think
14.76s: we need to spend a few minutes looking at. And for those interested tomorrow Saturday
19.36s: at 5 p.m. Pacific time, still have the standardized GameStop livestream. The game plan actually
25.24s: was to look through roaring kiddies old trades. So this seems to fall in line with it. So
31.96s: what's going on today? Well, at there's two time frames that I think are most important.
37.64s: The first thing is I got an alert and these are Pacific time, but I got an alert at 842
43.52s: that there was some really massive size trades that came through in GameStop. So there
51.72s: was 6,399 of the 22.5 calls expiring 13-sep. The spot price at these at the time was $1.75
60.04s: got in there for 1.12 mil. And then right below that essentially a second off. So I would
66.44s: absolutely consider these to be the same trade. There was 3660 of the 22.5 calls, same
73.88s: expiration for $1.69 giga-dee for $619,000. So this takes us over 10,000 contracts essentially.
83.64s: And there's some just really, really, really, really interesting behavior going on here. So 088,
92.44s: 42, 37, and 38. That's when these trades come through. Then we take a look at roaring kiddies
98.28s: Twitter. This happened at 0.9 on the nose today. So these trades came through. This came out.
110.44s: Then the stock started to move. So if I slide this out of the way, and then let's just take a look
119.40s: at like a today, let's do it today one minute. So it's clear. Take a look. So roaring kiddie
129.24s: post this again, 0.9. We see these two trades come through big block orders, 0.842.
139.00s: So let's take a look. What happened at 0.842? You can see that the market saw it.
145.80s: And absolutely bit up on that movement. That's very likely a mix of hedging behavior because those
152.28s: are big trades, hedging behavior coming on by market makers. Then we wait a few minutes. 0.9 on the
161.64s: nose, roaring kiddie posts that meme. So what do we see here? Massive volume spike immediately,
172.28s: all by side, all by side, massive volume spike. And for those that obviously are kind of one
179.32s: or what's going on here, the idea is this is what he originally posted on June 27th.
186.28s: And then we saw, I think the filing was for like the 26th or something like the day before. I
190.68s: don't remember. It doesn't matter that much, but you can throw it in the comments if you know
194.52s: which day it was because I don't recall. The point being though is notice green eyes. We were
199.24s: obviously flipping out about the blue background and all these different kinds of things. But
204.28s: the green eyes. Then I notice red eyes. I notice eyes pointing to the stage right eyes pointing,
211.40s: well, I guess stage left stage right, my left in this case. The main thing I see is green by red
218.36s: cell. Like that's what it looks like. And obviously the meme looks like the kid from toy story,
222.84s: dropping his toy. He's, you know, moving on from the toy. That's when he went and played with
226.52s: Buzz Lightyear like a chode and then he came back and realized that Woody's the homie. And he
230.60s: liked hoodie. Woody. I don't know if people are reading that far into the story. I personally don't
235.24s: think that's what's being inferred here. As in, you know, he's putting down Chewie and then like
240.84s: the movie actually, he's going to go back to Chewie because that's what he does with Woody.
245.56s: I don't see that personally. To me, this is just representative of him putting down Chewie.
250.60s: And the red eyeballs look like cell, right? Green by red cell. That's my tinfoil hat. That's my guess
259.00s: as what's being inferred here. So obviously a lot of the market also made that same inference
266.60s: because we see this massive skyrocket in GameStop shoots up. And it's trading around like this
274.52s: 22 handle that shoots up like 10% to 24. It was up like over 8% when I made that first video a
282.12s: little bit earlier. And then it started coming back down. But we can see definitely kicked off
289.00s: a strong movement. What I cannot help but find curious. And I don't know what this means. And I
295.48s: don't want to pretend like I know what it means. I just have to point it out. I see 5,000 blocks
302.20s: of the 22 and a half calls in 13 September being sold. So my inference. And again, I'm highlighting
310.20s: inference because is closely related as everything might point at something going on being somebody
319.24s: bought these and then sold them essentially a half hour later, which we're going to talk about in
323.40s: a second. That's what the immediate inference would be. And to me, that does seem likely. But that
330.04s: doesn't mean that's what happened. We don't know. And I always want to remind people that it's okay
335.72s: to have ideas on what we can reasonably conclude happened as in this case. But until we know for
343.40s: certain, I don't think it's smart to essentially take our idea as truth because here's what looks like
350.04s: what happened. I see 0842. These come out 0900. We see that tweet. I see 0919 and 0922 both 5,000
361.40s: lot of the 22 and a half calls same expiration being unwound. So if we look at this, we can see,
370.36s: okay, well, on this block here, he got he being whoever this is because again, even taking a step
376.76s: back, we don't know that this is roaring kitty. We don't know what I guess that it is personally.
382.28s: I would guess that it is. It seems very likely. But does that mean that it's him? No. And I don't know
389.24s: neither does anybody else until he posts a yellow update until he says something. Just want to drive
394.76s: that point home. So when I'm talking about he, I really am talking about whoever this is. I have
400.44s: who I think it is. And I'm sharing that openly so that it's not like this cryptic message. There's
404.92s: enough cryptic messages going on. But it's not to taint your analysis of things. That's why I'm
411.48s: specifically calling out my bias in what I think this is. So I see these go through and I see this
420.68s: happens at $1.75 and then this one unwinds. Let's call it 225, right? Let's just use that as a
426.52s: general guesstimate. Do I think if it were roaring kitty? Do I think roaring kitty would come in
435.32s: here at $1.75 and then after a move from let's take a look. 42, 842 to 919. Let's see what that
446.04s: looks like. 842 here. So right down here to 919. Over here is big red candle. Do I think that's his move?
462.28s: Personally, not unless something else is going on. We've seen this dude hold his position up
469.80s: over a quarter billion dollars, not a quarter million, quarter billion dollars. He has more money
478.60s: than he could ever need. So if this was him that bought here and if this was him that sold here,
488.52s: although it's going to come out in force because it does look like somebody pumped and dumped.
495.16s: Again, I'm not trying to cause chaos here. It's just that this is a quintessential style of that
499.88s: that behavior because typically this is what a pump and dump is where somebody front runs a move.
505.96s: We gain a position. We do something that we know is going to move something and then we exit
511.32s: after the move, typically in a really short term time frame. That's generally what it is.
516.60s: Do I think that that's what he would do? No, I genuinely don't. And do I think that's what he
522.68s: would do for this amount of money again for most mortals like us for thinking like shit, dog. That's
527.40s: like two million bucks, two point two ish, two point three almost like, yeah, I mean, I might do it,
534.92s: but joking aside, hundreds of millions of dollars. He doesn't care. He doesn't care that he made
543.08s: a few thousand dollars, tens of that hundreds of thousand dollars. He doesn't care. I've seen
547.40s: this do hold positions that again, we're up over 250 million dollars and just do nothing.
556.20s: So if this was him, I would be surprised for a few reasons. The first reason is again, I just
562.84s: don't think that's his behavior. I think it would take a lot more for him to do. Again,
566.92s: unless he's trying to do something else on the back end that we might not be privy to.
571.32s: The other thing that I could see that's slightly different is this is a really short term entry,
575.80s: seven days. I haven't seen based on what he's done previously, which again, tomorrow on that
581.88s: live stream, the goal is to go through this exact thing in detail because it's very interesting.
587.00s: But I haven't seen him go through these really short term trades like this. So not saying that he
591.80s: never could, but I that's just not the behavior I've seen from him. So I personally am left with a
598.76s: massive, massive question mark. I really, as per usual, don't really know what's going on here.
605.32s: So the other thing that I did to take a closer look at this is I looked at the 22 and a half specifically.
611.96s: And rather than just look at today, I want to look back over the last week and see what kind of
617.40s: behavior I saw going on in there. And there's just nothing. There's nothing even close to this
623.96s: magnitude in this time frame. So then the other thing I thought is, okay, I've seen we're in
628.76s: Kitty Do these before. A lot of times he does it like almost a month out is when he'll start building
634.44s: his position. So same, same. Go all the way out to August, come all the way into here. And let's
639.72s: take a look at these 22 and a halfs. Same exact thing. Being there's no activity before here. And
647.48s: obviously there's some activity, but this is all super small stuff compared to these. So the fireworks
653.96s: were today that obviously we can see pretty clearly what this all means and what it looks like.
659.56s: I really don't know, but my guess is if this is the case here, we will see an updated filing
666.92s: from him because he will have to share it within 10 days of this if it was today. If it was
674.28s: prior to today, whatever day it happens that he drops below that 5% threshold, he owes an amended
679.72s: form. So we'll see that at some point if that means he's sold enough to drop below the 5% threshold.
684.92s: Then the other thing I imagine what happened is we would see another yellow update at some point.
688.52s: Who knows when, why or how? No idea. That's kind of the tricky part about our friend,
693.40s: we're in Kitty. Is he's kind of there? He's kind of gone and you never really know which way he's
697.80s: moving, which is obviously part of his game. So just an absolutely firework day. I am, as you could
705.00s: tell, very engaged because this stuff is fascinating to me. It is so fun to look at and try to figure
710.04s: out what's going on with the thought pattern is behind it. Today I was able to trade the move in
714.36s: GameStop up a little bit and I was hot on the button because I saw this happen with Choui
719.32s: and I was not going to essentially try to ride the super far just yet. I still have my long shares
724.68s: all those positions, but I was trading it with options today in a much smaller sense because
728.84s: it's just too much movement to not pay attention to it. But man, what a day. So as always,
737.16s: any ideas that you have what's going on, any theories, anything you think we should take a look
741.00s: at during the live stream tomorrow, let me know because I am keen on it. I want to dive further
746.60s: into this stuff and try to figure out what's going on because it is just too interesting not to.
751.08s: As always, be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
