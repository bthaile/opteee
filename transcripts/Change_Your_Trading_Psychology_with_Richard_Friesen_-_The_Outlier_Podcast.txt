2.40s: hey everyone Eric here welcome back to
4.80s: the outlier podcast and I am here with a
8.46s: great referred friend I'm sure we're
10.74s: gonna have a great conversation uh but
12.54s: Richard Friesen and I actually learned
15.06s: about you via my good buddy Kyle from
17.34s: two bulls podcast like I was telling you
19.20s: and he had nothing but great things to
21.54s: say about you and that made me literally
24.24s: elated because I had a chance to look
27.00s: over some of your work which we'll get
28.50s: into your background in just a second
29.70s: and I literally loved it like I love
31.74s: what you're talking about I love the
33.24s: angle that you bring to this so first
34.86s: and foremost welcome to the channel
36.72s: thank you for hanging out for a bit well
38.94s: it's really great to be here and I
40.74s: certain we certainly have mutual respect
42.54s: for Kyle and I got a feeling we're going
45.54s: to have a creative conversation uh so
48.30s: the question is
49.74s: will an hour be enough but I let's we'll
52.74s: let's go for it and see what we can do
54.54s: well you know just a minor correction
57.48s: about that respect towards Kyle I don't
59.88s: know if you know this but he's in the
61.32s: Navy I'm in the Marine Corps so it is in
63.54s: My DNA to make sure that I insult him in
66.00s: some sort of way oh okay yeah so it's
68.46s: like it's kind of respect but maybe not
70.44s: okay but just just kidding I love Kyle
73.74s: so I had a chance to look over some of
76.80s: your background and stuff but I always
78.60s: like to kind of get it from the
80.94s: individual right because nobody knows
82.74s: you better than you and I saw that you
84.84s: spent time
86.28s: um on the Pacific Stock Exchange and I
89.16s: saw that you kind of had time in the
91.26s: cbot CME merolin she kind of you've done
94.02s: a lot of things so I would love to just
96.36s: start with maybe like a high level
98.40s: overview of how you got started in the
101.16s: markets and just your career path
103.62s: overall because I think that that helps
105.66s: set a good foundation for people to
107.28s: understand your perspective well it may
109.32s: be really brief and um I was uh going I
113.76s: was at Wheaton College just west of
115.38s: Chicago it's a Christian Evangelical
117.66s: school and there I met Joe Ritchie who
120.96s: uh founded Chicago research and trading
123.24s: he was one of the foremost
126.02s: innovators in option Theory and option
129.30s: valuation and trading and did very well
131.76s: with him and when my wife got tired of
135.00s: living in Chicago
137.70s: why what's the problem
140.52s: um so we came back to California and I
143.94s: opened my own firm on the Pacific
146.88s: exchange
148.34s: but leading up to that was Merrill Lynch
151.46s: and working
154.34s: with retail customers and then when I
158.04s: built my own firm I was working with
160.44s: Traders I
162.12s: uh trained them according to a
164.82s: methodology of trading options Futures
167.16s: and stocks and we were just we just hit
170.34s: singles and occasionally a double very
173.04s: careful it was grinded out and we were
176.40s: doing very well
178.02s: except
180.06s: some Traders
181.68s: well some Traders would just take the
184.74s: method and just take off and some
186.72s: Traders would do okay not great but some
189.42s: Traders just wouldn't make it and that's
191.22s: where my interest was and what is the
194.34s: mindset that makes the difference and I
196.98s: have told my story many times about my
199.08s: own mindset limitations but once I was
202.02s: there and the nice thing about trading
205.14s: is that it gives you immediate feedback
207.72s: reality is hard and fast
211.28s: whereas if you're let's say a career for
213.72s: an attorney or a doctor there's a while
216.72s: there you get some feedback is is to
219.00s: what you're doing so using that hard and
221.34s: fast feedback then I developed a
223.92s: therapeutic and coaching methodology to
227.22s: work with Traders and entrepreneurs and
229.68s: business people who want to expand their
233.82s: opportunities and their growth and
237.36s: and invite them into a mindset that
240.60s: makes that possible
242.52s: I love that and it's actually really
244.62s: cool with your options background
246.36s: because that's actually probably one of
248.40s: my primary trading Vehicles so I'm
251.22s: definitely looking forward to diving
252.54s: into that side of things just a little
254.04s: bit but uh before that one of my initial
256.68s: questions is to understand the jump from
259.32s: a very technical math based world of
263.70s: derivatives to something as nebulous as
266.88s: mindset what precipitated that
269.70s: transition for you well you know the
271.80s: transition was really from a therapist
274.74s: which I was uh originally started family
278.52s: and individual therapy and then Joe
282.06s: invited me Joe Ritchie of CRT invited me
284.88s: to Chicago and I thought oh I don't know
286.38s: enough yet so I'd joined Merrill Lynch
288.42s: first and then went there so rich
290.16s: Friesen philosophy major master's degree
292.20s: in Clinical Psychology
294.12s: a guy who
296.36s: has been identified with Don Quixote
303.36s: and so
305.40s: I went to to work for Joe and that was
307.98s: the real transition in fact my trainer
311.16s: in Chicago on the Chicago Mercantile
313.62s: Exchange told me that I was the worst
317.64s: trainee he had ever had
319.86s: [Laughter]
322.92s: so that was the difficult transition to
326.34s: actually be able to focus and eventually
330.54s: when you
332.58s: create enough repeated behaviors you
335.70s: know you get into a rhythm but also as a
338.34s: with my philosophy and psychology
340.20s: background I was really looking what are
342.66s: the underlying factors that can create
345.18s: trading behaviors that are successful so
348.60s: for two three years on the trading floor
352.92s: I have pictures of it we have these
354.78s: trading cards they're kind of heavy duty
356.88s: cards you can write on you write your
358.44s: trades and you keep track of things so I
362.10s: just kept a really small print
363.48s: everything I noticed everything I felt
365.70s: all my emotions the emotions of other
367.92s: Traders the mistakes they make the Smart
370.32s: Ones what they did and after a couple
373.38s: years I had a stack of almost a foot
375.66s: high both sides tiny print and that
378.54s: turned out oh I have it there but into a
381.18s: trading manual in a binder that I used
383.58s: to trade my train my Traders and again
387.66s: the deciding factor was not intelligence
391.86s: it was their mindset and so now that
395.64s: I've you know I'm I'm 70 oh oh my God
399.06s: I'm 76 this year
401.66s: congratulations thank you but at this
404.76s: age
405.90s: um you know what what can I do and that
408.54s: is share the mindset and so I created a
412.50s: specific set of
416.12s: exercises and processes to take people
419.40s: from traders who uh who you know think
423.96s: that they can just do it immediately
425.46s: that they're smart enough Engineers
427.56s: sometimes doctors and lawyers who who
430.02s: who are able to shape the world because
433.50s: of their presence
435.24s: Market doesn't give a
438.74s: so those principles then have turned
442.26s: into a a trading system and personal
445.26s: coaching that I that I use and we've
447.66s: been very successful and have a lot of
449.88s: happy clients
451.32s: that's awesome so why why the move from
456.30s: kind of family
459.24s: psychology focused work
461.88s: to trading why not
464.46s: um Sports why not big business like why
467.58s: trading for you well it was a total
470.46s: accident that my friend Joe had built
472.32s: started a trading firm I mean if he had
474.72s: started something else or another friend
476.28s: had I could have gone there but when I
479.10s: was training as a therapist in the early
480.96s: 70s everybody was being a therapist so
484.62s: uh and the methodologies that I saw when
488.76s: I was uh
491.30s: working with as uh I just dropped the
494.28s: word an acolyte for the some therapist I
497.28s: looked and said what they're doing is oh
499.74s: they're create they are recreating the
502.44s: processes that the clients are
504.54s: struggling with and allowing them to
506.94s: live within this process without really
510.30s: looking at the drivers and where they're
512.52s: going so one of the things that
516.30s: I work with with clients is I'm not
519.18s: afraid to go anywhere we'll look at
521.16s: their behaviors we'll look at their
522.60s: beliefs and we'll go down through their
524.34s: deepest identity to those things that
526.86s: they've quarantined that are still
528.78s: driving trading and other behaviors
532.20s: got it that's literally a fascinating
535.38s: process to go through to start us off
537.80s: have you spent
540.48s: well I guess I'll rephrase the question
542.46s: what's the breakdown of your effort
545.46s: between like a retail Trader and an
548.04s: Institutional Trader because I have to
549.96s: imagine that there's similarities and
552.12s: differences between the two
554.46s: yeah what's interesting is that my
557.10s: professional trading clients hedge fund
559.32s: managers and my
561.72s: beginning naive Traders there's still
564.90s: the same human brain now we're we're
569.04s: expressing our behaviors on a very
571.26s: different level between them but I'll be
574.38s: damned if it isn't some of the same
576.42s: drivers that are driving both of them
579.48s: got it that makes a lot of sense so I
582.42s: want to touch on the institutional side
584.70s: first briefly and then kind of spend a
587.28s: little more of the time on the retail
588.84s: side because that's going to definitely
590.10s: apply to most of the people listening to
592.08s: this at least for my audience
594.36s: um but I always find the juxtaposition
596.28s: between institutions and Retail
598.32s: fascinating from multiple levels so at a
601.50s: high level overview from your depth of
604.26s: experience observing the the two groups
607.08s: what are some of the similarities high
609.36s: level similarities and differences
611.16s: between kind of the the kind of services
614.04s: that you provide
616.08s: yeah well for the professional Traders
618.30s: what we do is we look at what is
622.20s: stopping them from expanding their
624.00s: success now they're very motivated the
626.52s: money is there I mean we can see every
628.50s: day the results of their behaviors and
631.68s: so they're very interested now they know
634.68s: the markets they know their strategies
636.54s: they're very sophisticated or they
638.82s: wouldn't be there so now we get down to
641.46s: just that really tiny layer of those
643.68s: thin things that are stopping them and
646.26s: that's sometimes comes down to the
648.48s: deeper levels of beliefs and identity
650.40s: the retail Trader on the other hand will
653.58s: be I'm going to be a Trader uh I'm you
656.34s: know I can learn stuff I'm an engineer
658.08s: I'm smart or whatever and and I have
661.44s: something called The Confidence Circle
662.88s: and it starts with just with a naive
665.46s: confidence oh I can do this you know
668.22s: much like I can learn how to be an
670.38s: engineer write software
672.84s: um and the assumption is that it's a
676.50s: thing out there to learn
678.54s: but as you well know and most people
681.26s: sense this that Trading
684.72s: touches our deepest part
687.36s: and our brains are not set to manage it
690.54s: because our brains developed on the
692.46s: Savannahs of Africa
694.20s: and with that primitive brain at the
697.92s: base of our neck
699.36s: we hit just freaking takes over
702.54s: sometimes so yeah I don't know if you've
705.30s: ever experienced it where you wake up
707.22s: the next morning you say
709.68s: why did I do that
712.02s: I know I shouldn't do that
715.32s: what was that about well in that context
718.62s: sometimes that primitive brain old
721.02s: patterns of behaviors and desires take
723.24s: over so the naive person thinks it's out
727.44s: there the sophisticated hedge fund
730.08s: managers knows it there's something here
732.36s: he's got all the external things managed
734.82s: so the naive Trader beginning Trader
737.58s: starts with uh just a naive confidence
740.40s: and then the next level of confidence is
743.10s: when I make a profitable trade
745.82s: whoopee look at me my dreams are going
748.32s: to come true the Mansion the car the
751.38s: trophy spouse
753.44s: I'm gonna do it
755.94s: but then we have three trait losing
757.86s: trades in a row
759.84s: oh my gosh my dream is collapsing
764.04s: so if they're persistent then they move
766.80s: to okay just making a trade I need to
770.04s: get a strategy and follow a strategy so
773.04s: then they experiment backdest do all
775.02s: that create a strategy and then the
777.36s: strategy starts to work out yes I'm now
780.72s: confident in my strategy yes I've got it
784.68s: but as I teach my clients all strategies
787.98s: eventually fail
789.84s: they have to if if strategies soon
793.86s: everybody would figure out a winning
795.42s: strategy and we'd all be rich well that
798.60s: doesn't happen the market says you have
801.06s: confidence in your strategy
802.40s: [Laughter]
804.00s: let me show you something in fact what I
806.70s: do is I have my clients map their
810.48s: strategy
812.16s: Heaven strategy Heaven is where this
815.34s: strategy just works create the volume
818.52s: the the movement the direction the
821.52s: volatility just to find the market where
824.28s: it really works and strategy hell is
826.86s: take the same strategy and to find where
829.68s: it just gets the crap be out of it day
832.56s: after day
834.00s: well once you do that then you say oh I
837.96s: need to know what Market mood or what
840.72s: Market type my strategy really works
843.30s: well in so then they become an expert in
846.90s: looking at the market and saying what
848.40s: strategy do I apply
850.26s: and finally there's this
854.52s: it's almost like a sound barrier
858.00s: that you go and you get over it and then
860.58s: you say I don't need to know anything
863.82s: I'm fully here with a market
867.96s: and I will trade
870.60s: from a level of it's not confidence
873.18s: because that can be run into
874.98s: overconfidence it's like I'm just it's
877.68s: me in the market and I don't need to
879.48s: know anything I don't need to protect
881.28s: the market I am just here with the
884.28s: market making trades and that final
886.50s: level where you don't need to know you
888.72s: is no ego there's no need for the your p
893.22s: l to prove anything who you are your
896.16s: value excuse me
899.22s: then all of a sudden you get over that
901.56s: hump now that doesn't mean you're not
904.02s: going to have difficult times for losing
905.76s: but
908.04s: excuse me I'm going to mute
913.74s: we're just taking a quick water
916.68s: so then that's the the progress for even
921.00s: the from everywhere and from the retail
922.98s: Trader to the professional
926.46s: I love that and it's really interesting
929.34s: to hear kind of the
931.44s: The Experience really I've gone through
934.74s: essentially that
937.02s: um so it's interesting to hear you talk
938.94s: about that that trajectory
941.22s: um one of the things that I'm always
944.04s: fascinated by and one of I guess I would
946.98s: consider like the biggest
949.58s: risks for new Traders especially on the
952.56s: retail side is the dunning-kruger effect
954.90s: which you're probably familiar with it
957.30s: but for those that aren't it's
958.80s: essentially when you know we have a
962.22s: little bit of experience a little bit of
963.84s: depth we start to feel comfortable and
965.70s: confident but we still there's still a
969.12s: lot that we don't know we don't know yet
970.98s: yeah and that typically places us
973.08s: directly in front of the train moving
975.60s: fast that is risk and a lot of times you
977.82s: get run over and I actually use myself
979.56s: as an example for that the largest
982.32s: losing trade as a percentage of my
984.54s: account the largest percent drawdown
986.04s: occurred I was trading for five and a
988.80s: half years six years at that point and I
990.96s: was doing well like relatively speaking
993.18s: I started really young I started trading
994.68s: when I was in high school actually
996.48s: um back in 2007. and when I was in
999.06s: college at that point I already had a
1001.34s: trading plan I had my trading logs like
1003.98s: I was getting very organized that's kind
1005.84s: of one of the ways I found success not
1008.12s: because
1009.38s: um I'm smart I'm actually probably about
1011.54s: as average as every other human being
1013.22s: out there it's just that I add
1015.26s: parameters and I track things that
1017.06s: allows me to make changes that work so I
1020.96s: was kind of confidently deploying and
1023.54s: then all of a sudden I get ran over it's
1025.76s: not even like an insane Black Swan event
1027.92s: just a larger move than I was expecting
1029.90s: and then boom there's my largest account
1032.12s: drawdown I exited the trade flattened
1034.28s: because that's what my risk parameter
1036.20s: said to do and as the market tends to do
1039.16s: it's swiftly moved back directly in my
1042.08s: profit Zone and I watched a trade you
1044.18s: know that was going to be a full profit
1045.62s: oh dear
1047.90s: perfect and mean I never looked back at
1049.94s: that saying oh I should have done this
1051.14s: should have like I don't think like that
1052.70s: it's all in the in the Marine Corps we
1054.62s: call it a round down range like the
1056.78s: stuff I set up was specifically and it
1059.30s: served me well in general didn't work
1061.10s: this one case that's okay but I wanted
1063.20s: to specifically ask you about the
1065.60s: dunning-kruger effect and if you have an
1067.52s: opinion on you know the the impact on
1070.22s: Traders and if so what are some of the
1073.10s: ways Traders can kind of navigate around
1075.08s: it because I regularly interact with
1077.60s: Traders right that's why I do this whole
1078.98s: thing is to just try to share
1080.24s: information very similar to you and a
1083.84s: lot of traders that are at that you know
1086.24s: three to six year mark they're starting
1088.10s: to find success they don't want to hear
1090.86s: that they don't know what they don't
1093.08s: know right you can't tell them that
1094.82s: because then defense comes on and then
1096.68s: they shut down but to me those are some
1098.84s: of the traders that are at the highest
1100.34s: risk of kind of these account drawdowns
1102.68s: so what are your thoughts on navigating
1105.08s: that as an individual but then also as a
1107.30s: community
1108.14s: well you really get down to asking the
1110.54s: hard questions Eric
1112.90s: oh not easy ones for Rich no
1117.38s: that's why you're here you're the expert
1119.66s: so it's uh the first thing that popped
1122.60s: into my mind is uh new Trader uh this is
1126.14s: true story uh I just hired him and it
1130.46s: was one of those weeks like four or five
1132.98s: days in a row where the retail was
1135.14s: selling option premium
1137.12s: or no no the retail was buying option
1139.52s: premium and the and the professionals
1141.92s: were selling operation premium in in
1143.96s: different strikes all over the floor
1145.46s: there was kind of a mass thing
1148.10s: oh my God you couldn't help but make
1150.68s: money
1152.84s: I mean mine
1155.48s: 25 implied volatility sell selling 40
1158.60s: volatility
1160.42s: okay that works
1163.28s: um so one of the brand new traders who
1165.56s: had been working that way came to me
1166.76s: says I'm up 10 grand for the day I'm
1168.56s: taking the rest of the day off
1170.42s: so I took all his money out of the
1173.60s: account I told him I did anyway it says
1176.18s: you're starting over because those times
1179.12s: are so rare
1181.04s: that you just keep going forward you
1184.28s: don't stop right and conversely to that
1188.72s: is when a Trader makes money
1193.96s: and it fills all their longing the holes
1197.66s: in their heart
1199.16s: it their dreams are going to come true
1203.00s: oh my gosh this is it I finally made it
1207.74s: when an actuality trading the one of the
1211.04s: wonderful things about it
1212.78s: is that it's a continual process
1217.04s: and it's a continually checking in with
1220.16s: yourself in fact what we have is uh a a
1224.18s: process called our set score Sensations
1226.46s: emotions thoughts so before you start
1228.86s: trading you check in and Sensations we
1231.68s: score these on a minus five to plus five
1234.26s: physical Sensations if I was uh uh drunk
1238.58s: out last night and I got a horrible
1240.08s: hangover I've got the flu and I burned
1243.38s: the muscles of my feet doing fire
1245.18s: walking
1246.76s: so physical Sensations are a minus five
1250.40s: uh plus five means I it's like a cocaine
1255.32s: uh I'm a hyper I'm just
1258.16s: my body's just getting my shape no legs
1261.08s: shaking down a zero
1265.46s: I'm fully present with you Eric my
1267.98s: body's relaxed our emotions s is for
1271.40s: Sensations e is for emotions and it's
1273.86s: the same thing emotions are hyper or I'm
1277.04s: fully depressed I can't get out of bed
1279.46s: uh on our T is our thoughts uh my
1283.70s: thoughts are self-critical my thoughts
1286.22s: are neutral or my thoughts are euphoric
1290.00s: I finally got it made so every Trader
1292.94s: then scores himself on these
1295.34s: three items before he starts trading in
1299.06s: order to Center himself and to know
1301.70s: whatever comes I'm here for it like when
1304.70s: I was on the floor every morning I would
1306.80s: get up and I would ask my Traders
1308.54s: where's the bullet coming from today
1311.42s: and I imagine a fog bank and a bull
1314.24s: coming right for my forehead and I would
1317.54s: say where's it coming from could there
1319.22s: be an interest rate change you know
1320.90s: interest rates impact options especially
1323.06s: if you have a lot of you know we'd have
1325.34s: thousands of conversions and reversals
1327.50s: on uh a short stock uh that you couldn't
1331.58s: borrow anymore uh you know what's going
1334.22s: to happen if there was a huge move in
1336.62s: the in the market what would happen
1339.26s: if the implied volatility dropped if the
1342.02s: light volatility exploded you know what
1344.60s: is going to put us out of business and
1347.18s: that's what we would ask every morning
1348.74s: there's no complacency the Assumption
1351.74s: being
1353.18s: that we were you know we're just a bump
1356.06s: on The Twig here and
1359.38s: we are extracting money very carefully
1362.96s: with a process of looking at Value
1365.80s: differentials and when you're in that
1368.42s: position
1369.56s: well on the floor of the exchange I
1372.32s: would say about 20 percent of the market
1373.82s: makers went bust every year
1377.30s: you have a long streak you're winning
1379.78s: and boy am I something
1383.80s: all my dreams are coming true and that's
1387.86s: when we really get hurt
1390.32s: got it so for a retail Trader who might
1395.48s: not have that support structure around
1397.28s: them right they might be the only person
1399.08s: sitting behind the screen and they might
1401.66s: not want to look at their p l because
1403.94s: it's bad and you know tomorrow's a new
1405.80s: day and we'll figure it out
1407.62s: they're not at the point where they have
1410.54s: like good external controls to help
1412.94s: audit these you know conditions and
1415.70s: they're still at a point where they
1417.02s: still feel confident you know they still
1419.36s: think they'll be able to figure it out
1420.44s: they'll figure it out tomorrow
1422.84s: is there a kind of practice that you
1427.04s: found to be successful for those
1429.86s: specific kind of conditions where it can
1431.72s: help a Trader maybe apply that Set uh
1434.36s: that set score is that something that
1435.74s: you think Traders should just integrate
1437.60s: early on and then this way they don't
1440.00s: come into this effect the dunning-kruger
1441.92s: effect where you know they think that
1443.72s: they know everything or they think that
1445.52s: they have it all figured out and then
1446.78s: they run into that risk oh there's
1448.82s: several layers here uh and that
1452.54s: awareness if you know every like I'll
1455.06s: have my new Traders set an alarm for
1456.86s: every 10 minutes every 10 minutes
1460.64s: what's my physiology I lean forward my
1463.46s: jaws tensed
1465.88s: in fact the short story I mean I don't
1468.92s: know uh how to rarely have I do have
1472.04s: clients in the same area as I am they're
1474.02s: all over the world
1475.34s: but the one was in the San Francisco
1477.08s: area so he had a problem so I went to
1479.96s: see him and he said okay let's I'm going
1483.62s: to do the uh demo account uh this
1487.04s: morning so he was looking at he says you
1488.96s: notice this pattern here that's not in
1490.64s: my pattern uh this is almost there
1492.74s: except the volume in and this and I
1494.66s: don't remember all the details but okay
1496.64s: now it's setting up no it didn't didn't
1499.46s: oh okay now it's setting up and he made
1502.46s: two or three trades two of them were
1504.62s: profitable on in Sim and one of them was
1507.56s: a small loss he says well you know I can
1510.02s: do this so I said okay let's go live
1515.24s: oh look what they're doing son of a
1517.46s:  they're going to take out they're
1518.78s: going to do this they're going to run
1520.28s: this freaking Market
1523.42s: it was like night and day between Sim
1526.58s: and actual trading so when we're doing
1529.16s: our set scores or Sensations emotions
1531.38s: and thoughts we immediately get an alarm
1534.98s: um and so
1537.26s: I had him at this point you know
1539.42s: exaggerate the physiology of that
1541.88s: exaggerate the emotions and it turned
1544.34s: out his father was judging him in his
1547.64s: mind when he was trading for real so
1550.46s: once we got that out then we could have
1552.68s: an imaginary conversation with a father
1554.90s: and this old pattern of a critical
1557.78s: father from when he was you know two and
1560.24s: three years old when he was live that
1563.72s: survival mechanism kicked in and and the
1567.62s: tension kicked in so you know one level
1569.90s: it's awareness
1571.70s: of of our physiology or emotions and
1574.34s: thoughts another thing that uh we do is
1577.94s: we have our
1579.82s: Market metrics program where you you
1582.98s: mark down all the trades what strategy
1585.62s: you were using what was your set scores
1587.72s: doing them was this what we call a
1590.00s: lucrative or lousy trade a lucrative
1592.16s: trait is one where everything lines up
1594.68s: you're following your your parameters
1596.36s: you exit you enter you exit you get
1599.66s: stopped out whatever that is a lucrative
1601.94s: trade not whether it's profitable but
1605.24s: it's lucrative do enough trades like
1607.52s: that and if you have Edge you're going
1609.68s: to have money so sometimes I'll have the
1611.48s: client figure out how much money will
1613.88s: you make with a lucrative trade on
1616.64s: average oh it's uh 750 great
1621.14s: this one lost money you made 7.50 and
1624.32s: that's to avoid the pain of loss we
1626.62s: re-frame that
1628.94s: the other thing we do to help break
1630.74s: people out is private coaching is I will
1634.10s: trade with them they'll share their
1636.44s: screen I'll watch them and it's amazing
1639.58s: they never screw up
1642.38s: why
1646.16s: because I keep them in their higher
1648.86s: level context I'm continually if I see
1651.50s: them to lean forward and crunch I'll go
1653.66s: okay notice your position notice your
1656.48s: physiology knows your breathing notice
1659.06s: your oh notice your lips what are your
1660.80s: lips doing oh
1662.48s: come back to a context of their highest
1665.60s: level self so and we also do group work
1668.66s: sometimes and whereby everyone brings
1671.90s: their Market metric sheets and they're
1675.32s: colored and coated so you can you can
1677.42s: see in in two seconds exactly where the
1680.30s: problems lay and knowing that you're
1683.30s: going to come to the meeting
1685.76s: keeps you from dropping down into that
1688.94s: primitive reactive state
1692.18s: I love that and there's two different
1695.18s: follow-ups I have for you but I want to
1697.22s: touch on kind of what I would consider
1698.66s: to be the simpler one first and one of
1701.36s: the the main like pivot Points in my
1704.72s: trading is when
1707.06s: um I created I like to call it like just
1710.24s: a healthy separation or disassociation
1712.46s: with the trading Capital that I had and
1715.28s: for like quick context I started trading
1717.86s: in high school because I had a single
1719.72s: mom she struggled with debt and I knew I
1723.02s: needed to do something otherwise there's
1725.84s: just a good chance you know she's gonna
1727.40s: have to go bankrupt or whatever the case
1729.08s: is
1730.10s: um you know I was young at the time but
1731.72s: I just saw a lot of risk like if the car
1733.88s: broke we couldn't fix it we I actually
1735.86s: learned auto mechanics to for those
1738.32s: exact circumstances because she drove to
1740.12s: work and that's all she had so long
1741.86s: story short when I first started trading
1744.44s: you know there was this
1747.16s: overwhelming sensation of you know oh
1749.90s: this is all my savings this is
1751.64s: everything that I put together I can't
1752.84s: lose it and then all of a sudden you
1754.58s: know looking back 16 years I'm realizing
1757.82s: you know the the harder you squeeze on
1760.10s: that money the harder it is to get it to
1761.84s: grow
1762.86s: I'm wondering if you have an opinion on
1765.92s: Traders creating kind of a healthy
1768.68s: disassociation with their trading
1770.42s: capital and if so what does that look
1773.42s: like
1774.44s: oh you couldn't have asked a better
1776.12s: question behind me is the book a private
1778.52s: conversation with money and one no
1781.82s: Trader ever has ever not one not a
1785.54s: hundreds it's ever come to me and said
1787.22s: Rich I'm really concerned about managing
1789.98s: success and being successful
1792.40s: oh no that'll be great that'll be easy
1795.02s: but we all have our limits we have our
1797.78s: relationship with money and what I
1800.18s: noticed about about 60 70 percent of my
1803.60s: clients they don't appreciate that they
1807.20s: have belief systems relationship with
1809.90s: money issues wealth and meaning like
1812.48s: just this morning a client
1814.52s: was trying to tell me that when he makes
1816.92s: it when he gets wealthy then he's going
1819.20s: to be able to be a philanthropist
1820.70s: because trading is really kind of icky
1824.54s: evil you're taking money and you're not
1826.46s: really his parents immigrants worked
1829.58s: three jobs in order to put them through
1831.92s: school to give him a better life and
1834.38s: somehow trading easily and just making
1836.36s: money that's you know it almost like it
1840.92s: uh was a rebuke to the all the hard work
1843.68s: his parents did
1845.78s: or you may have you know given that
1848.06s: story you may have a taste of that can
1850.82s: you really make money easily so what we
1854.66s: do is we have them step into that wealth
1856.94s: and then we have a number of exercises
1858.98s: one of them is we look back as wealth
1861.92s: and we look at all the people in our
1863.78s: family in our community
1865.70s: and I asked them okay who's all there
1867.80s: and they'll list the names I'll say who
1869.18s: objects to where you are now and
1871.88s: sometimes it'll be what they're all
1874.34s: happy they're cheering they're like at a
1876.50s: football game standing up and down and
1878.06s: cheering
1879.74s: well then what is your resistance oh my
1884.24s: gosh I had made up that somehow
1887.96s: or the other thing is oh my dad
1892.58s: he says the wealthy people are
1894.80s: he says that you know once you become
1897.20s: wealthy it changes you and you're not a
1900.08s: good person
1901.88s: so then we have the conversation with
1904.22s: the parents and we look for all those
1905.78s: sticky points because until we can
1908.24s: visualize being wealthy successful
1910.34s: Trader
1911.60s: until we can accept it
1914.06s: our survival mechanisms will keep us
1916.40s: from going there
1918.86s: so what are some of the methods people
1921.74s: can apply to create that healthy
1924.62s: separation with their trading capital
1925.94s: for me it was once I had enough money
1929.84s: saved up that I knew I could take care
1931.88s: of my mom that I knew that even if I
1935.66s: passively invested in index ETFs made
1938.12s: that average eight to twelve percent per
1939.68s: year that I was on a good Runway and
1943.58s: once I had kind of I guess what I would
1945.74s: call like my immediate concerns satiated
1949.22s: I was then able to start disassociating
1953.24s: with it and saying if I lose this it's
1954.86s: okay I can make more I have plenty of
1956.48s: time and all my immediate needs are met
1958.28s: and I even went to the degree of like
1960.98s: starting to find a balance because you
1963.98s: don't want to throw away money
1965.24s: definitely but I would even include it
1967.82s: in my language so that I would help me
1970.46s: believe it right by saying it be like oh
1972.50s: this is just trading Capital it's no big
1974.00s: deal oh I lost five dollars 100 whatever
1976.04s: it is no big deal put on another trade
1977.72s: like I was being very cautious about how
1980.96s: I opened that door for myself and it it
1983.00s: worked really well but I'm sure you have
1985.28s: even better techniques for people to
1987.62s: kind of create that disassociation so
1989.30s: I'd love to hear your thoughts yeah well
1991.82s: I have uh an exercise called the three
1995.48s: cheer exercise where we actually have a
1997.70s: conversation with money
1999.44s: and we look at our relationship to money
2001.78s: and what's interesting is we have them
2003.70s: become money
2005.02s: and talk back to themselves and that is
2008.02s: fascinating sometimes and there's a
2009.76s: third part where you have a wise person
2012.70s: but what you said is about language
2016.06s: oh my gosh
2017.50s: that is so important
2019.42s: our language repeated language
2022.42s: creates it reveals the way we're
2025.36s: thinking and repeated language creates
2027.46s: repeated thoughts which then for example
2030.04s: if a client says well I'm going to try
2032.02s: to do that oh time out
2034.38s: crying means we're setting up an
2036.94s: internal struggle so rather than that
2039.30s: try try this oh that's funny rather than
2043.48s: that invite yourself to step into your
2046.84s: new state of mind and see how that feels
2048.58s: oh that feels better okay so we don't
2051.16s: have to try we're just stepping into
2053.32s: something that's better is that right
2054.82s: yes
2056.14s: so the language about you know money is
2059.64s: how your relationship to it so if it's
2062.74s: like
2064.84s: a money for a Trader is is just like a
2068.32s: machine it's like like a tool it's it's
2071.20s: something that we use as long as we
2073.72s: associate it and I think this is what
2075.70s: you're pointing out that's so important
2077.14s: with something that we can't lose that's
2080.20s: really valuable it's going to pay the
2082.24s: rent and all that stuff then the
2085.72s: pressure on that trade to do it right
2087.82s: puts us back down into our survival
2090.40s: mechanism
2092.26s: yeah I I think that
2094.96s: that's really useful to to kind of hear
2097.66s: and it's something that I think all
2099.52s: Traders really need to consider and it's
2101.56s: it's one of the things I think I learned
2103.48s: a lot of that stuff from my my time in
2105.46s: the Marine Corps because you a lot of
2107.74s: times are under like really tense
2109.90s: situations and if you sit there and you
2113.08s: think about all of the awful things that
2115.42s: could happen you become paralyzed you
2117.40s: can't you know if you drive your truck
2119.26s: there's a chance you could be involved
2120.88s: in a IED or a complex Ambush or all
2123.40s: these awful scenarios and if you sit
2125.74s: there and cycle on those then you don't
2128.08s: want to do anything you're completely
2129.28s: stuck and there's nothing you could do
2130.78s: so what a lot of us do is we just say
2133.00s: yeah man that could happen but I can't
2135.16s: control that so let me focus on the
2136.90s: stuff I can't control
2138.76s: um and I think you know that's one of
2140.74s: the big things I notice at least from my
2142.84s: limited experience with new Traders
2144.40s: having issues so that leads me to my
2146.62s: next question which is when you look at
2149.44s: specifically retail Traders what are
2152.50s: some of the common psychological traits
2155.04s: that tend to lead to success and then
2158.50s: also failure
2160.24s: yeah let me first comment on your on
2163.72s: your combat experience that I've often
2166.48s: said trading is one of the most
2167.92s: challenging things you can do except for
2169.84s: combat
2171.10s: and there's just a lot of similarities
2173.38s: in fact I went and took some combat
2175.96s: training myself uh using uh pistols
2181.06s: rifles and clearing houses and stuff
2184.24s: like that because the similarities are
2187.30s: there and I felt that creating well you
2190.18s: know what muscle memory is having worked
2192.88s: with weapons so creating that muscle
2194.92s: memory uh so that those responses become
2199.12s: automated and in trading we can do the
2202.00s: same thing we can create that muscle
2203.62s: memory
2205.48s: and I forgot your question not that I
2207.82s: sidetracked it yeah no it's okay we I
2209.56s: can re-ask the other one but there's
2211.42s: actually a great follow-on there because
2213.16s: I think one of the other things that I
2215.32s: really consider especially in those
2216.58s: scenarios and I think it's really cool
2217.90s: that you took that kind of training is
2219.46s: you know the worst what I started saying
2222.82s: to myself is the worst thing that
2224.62s: happens in this is I lose money I'm not
2227.62s: going to lose a leg one of my friends
2229.12s: didn't get shot like none of this is a
2231.70s: big deal like
2233.52s: scenario is I lose money
2236.02s: but I feel like for kind of civilians
2239.08s: that don't have that that other you know
2242.44s: benchmark essentially to assess things
2244.78s: against you know I feel like it might be
2247.24s: difficult for them to losing money to
2250.18s: them literally might feel akin to losing
2253.24s: their life for a limb you know I think
2255.46s: it's absurd but I could see it happening
2258.40s: oh absolutely imagine you have a hole in
2261.58s: your heart
2263.20s: and you don't feel worthwhile worthy as
2266.26s: a human being you your beliefs about
2269.86s: everyone's out to get you you want
2272.44s: recognition and when you have a losing
2275.56s: trade
2276.82s: it feels like your life is evaporating
2279.94s: before your eyes so you're absolutely
2282.64s: right in the sense is you're going to
2285.34s: survive you're not going to get a leg
2286.72s: blown off
2287.98s: but the emotional feeling going down to
2290.86s: that darkest place can be really really
2293.50s: intense
2295.06s: it's interesting so to to go back to the
2297.82s: other question I had for you which was
2299.68s: what are some of the common traits that
2302.50s: you see specifically towards retail
2304.66s: Traders but what are some of the common
2306.16s: traits you see
2307.78s: um for both psychologically successful
2310.78s: Traders and things that tend to lead to
2313.42s: failure
2316.48s: I'm going to step into my master Traders
2319.00s: mindset for a moment here we go
2323.14s: Here I Am with You Eric perfect
2327.06s: I am fully engaged able to be here there
2332.08s: is nothing that you could say or do I
2335.08s: don't have to worry about what words are
2337.12s: going to come next
2338.56s: this is a one-to-one eyeball to eyeball
2341.80s: relationship I am fully here
2345.28s: so Translating that to the market
2349.42s: I'm fully here with a market I am
2352.36s: learning
2353.50s: there is nothing that can hurt me I have
2356.32s: my systems
2357.82s: I don't need to know anything I don't
2360.34s: need to even to trust my strategy
2363.70s: if something goes wrong I'll be wow
2366.70s: that's fascinating I've never seen that
2369.46s: before
2370.66s: so what it is is when I talked about the
2372.88s: confidence Circle
2374.32s: is when you don't need when you know
2377.50s: that you just give up knowing one of the
2380.32s: most powerful books I've read is the
2382.00s: book of not knowing by Peter Ralston
2383.94s: it's a tough book because you have to
2386.68s: really work through it and let go of a
2389.62s: lot of the
2391.60s: supports that you
2393.54s: a lot of us to have these this knowledge
2396.64s: supports or these things we believe to
2398.44s: support us
2400.18s: boom wipe out all those supports are you
2402.76s: still okay
2404.08s: now if we can come to the market or come
2406.48s: to combat
2408.22s: or I can come with you right now and say
2412.24s: I'm fully here
2414.58s: and I'm curious about what's going to
2416.56s: happen
2417.58s: I don't know
2419.32s: I don't need to perform
2421.54s: we're just going to be here and see what
2423.88s: evolves
2427.18s: I love that
2430.54s: yeah I love that so one of the things
2433.36s: that I think about and it's like you're
2436.00s: kind of
2437.44s: really highlighting it in a in a
2440.08s: fascinating way is
2442.24s: um I have a saying that all using the
2443.74s: Discord and stuff where I'll say like do
2445.36s: you want to be writer do you want to
2446.50s: make money and what I mean by that is I
2451.06s: feel like Traders go through a cycle
2453.34s: where we need to be able we think we
2455.86s: need to be able to explain what's going
2458.20s: on the relationships between everything
2460.32s: and the longer you're around the market
2462.88s: the more you start to realize how
2465.46s: fruitless that is sure you can have a
2467.44s: hypothesis on how something works no
2469.36s: problem you might just be curious but
2471.82s: being able to explain everything why
2475.24s: everything works
2477.16s: um I I always found that it's more an
2479.38s: ego driven event as compared to is it
2482.20s: something that I'm actually attempting
2484.60s: to make money off of
2487.18s: I'd like to understand your thoughts on
2491.08s: Traders being able and it's a big
2493.06s: question but on Traders being able to
2496.26s: identify how big of a role ego plays in
2500.74s: their trading and how they can kind of
2504.90s: self-analyze their egos a little bit so
2507.76s: that they can understand the impact it
2509.86s: has because I think
2511.66s: one of the biggest mistakes I used to
2513.70s: make was I would always say oh I just
2516.52s: have to trade mechanically I just have
2518.68s: to not employ any emotions just stick to
2521.14s: the plan and you know you kind of
2523.60s: realize obviously you laugh at it and I
2525.70s: laugh at it now too because I realize
2527.44s: just how ignorant that is right the only
2530.44s: way in my opinion to control emotional
2533.56s: inputs is to acknowledge that they exist
2536.74s: so going back to one of the most at
2539.38s: least for me and based on one of my
2541.54s: favorite studies is the behavior of
2543.04s: individual investors actually pulled it
2544.54s: up I don't know if you've read it it's
2545.86s: by um Barbara Lee and Odin or just
2548.14s: Barbara and Odin sorry it's a
2550.00s: fascinating trading uh study and it and
2552.10s: it talks about
2553.48s: things like the disposition effect the
2556.48s: naive reinforcement things like that all
2558.34s: of this kind of bundles back into this
2560.86s: concept of ego so to summarize that
2564.46s: really long sporadic question in a neat
2567.52s: little thing with a bow tie
2570.24s: you share your thoughts on the impact of
2574.24s: ego on trading and how can Traders kind
2578.02s: of self-analyze the impact that their
2580.60s: ego has on their trading oh my gosh
2583.18s: you've just opened another hour session
2585.28s: here we go yeah so condense tie a bow on
2589.30s: it uh you know I mentioned the hole in
2591.88s: the heart that's one part another is I
2596.02s: need status or I need to prove I'm right
2598.18s: what you said or I need something to
2601.78s: show how smart I am or to get my parents
2603.70s: approval or or whatever it is
2606.10s: so and then there's the eagle part that
2609.76s: says
2612.52s: I used to have beliefs that I thought
2614.50s: were absolutely true
2616.90s: and I won't go into the mall but
2620.10s: they were here and then I grew up a
2622.48s: little bit more than they were different
2623.56s: but they were absolutely true and
2626.32s: they're here and they're absolutely true
2627.88s: and by attaching ourselves to something
2630.28s: that's absolutely true that is a prop
2633.28s: for ourselves but as mentioned
2636.58s: when we let go of that
2639.64s: need for certainty then all of a sudden
2643.06s: we are curious and open to what is going
2646.66s: on in the moment I have an exercise
2649.42s: called the cocky clanger
2652.44s: and the exercises cocky clanger I'll
2655.90s: take them back to a trade where they
2657.52s: just knew they had it they had it made
2659.14s: they canceled their stops because it was
2661.42s: going to turn around okay how do you
2663.94s: feel and we'd go through the physiology
2666.22s: the thoughts in the head the emotions we
2668.80s: get them into that point where where
2670.90s: their ego is just driving everything
2674.02s: then we start to write down what is
2676.06s: aware of what's your breathing like
2677.26s: what's your heart rate like what's going
2679.18s: on your face what what's your jaws where
2681.16s: are your muscles what emotions are you
2683.50s: having what are the thoughts through
2685.24s: your head so we we Define the cocky part
2687.88s: of them
2688.78s: then we create a mechanical alarm I mean
2691.54s: well it's an emotional learn
2694.48s: and so we go through it and we have the
2697.12s: alarm rings and then we take them out of
2699.22s: that state back to being an agent of
2702.04s: their own lives move back into the
2704.20s: Cockiness the experience the physiology
2706.06s: the emotions and everything ring the
2708.46s: bell and then go out so when it's like
2711.04s: Pavlov's dog you know when you you when
2713.86s: you show the food
2715.30s: they start to salivate or when they ring
2717.28s: the bell they start to salivate so when
2719.26s: they're in that spot the mental bell
2721.00s: rings and they say oh I'm in a cocky ego
2724.42s: driven Place do I want to be here does
2726.64s: it serve me well
2728.14s: huh not so and by having to move into it
2731.94s: intentionally and creating it and
2734.92s: exaggerating it then moving out of it
2737.62s: intentionally
2739.30s: it gives them the methodology of moving
2742.66s: back and forth and that's the most
2744.16s: important part of the exercise
2747.10s: that's awesome so it kind of combines
2749.32s: the you know the the capacity to
2751.90s: self-identify but then also to navigate
2754.30s: it that's actually a really really
2755.50s: interesting approach
2758.08s: um we have about 15 minutes left and
2760.42s: this is kind of my my favorite time
2762.58s: because now I get to be selfish and ask
2764.44s: questions that I'm just curious about
2766.50s: and one of the the questions that I have
2769.72s: for you is
2771.46s: I went through a fascinating
2774.82s: um I don't know it was like a ebb and
2776.68s: flow in in terms of expectations so for
2780.22s: a lot of my life like I said I kind of
2782.32s: shared some of the details on my
2783.58s: upbringing and I grew up not in a great
2786.34s: area
2787.54s: um I like walked through metal detectors
2789.34s: every day to go to Junior High School on
2790.96s: like that kind of stuff and I've always
2793.96s: been good at managing my expectations I
2796.84s: always thought that it was important
2798.04s: it's something that I've learned from
2799.30s: the stoics and I think maintaining a
2802.66s: healthy maintenance over our
2804.22s: expectations helps increase overall
2806.92s: happiness
2808.92s: what I found is I've started to find
2812.92s: success that exceeded those managed
2816.52s: expectations
2818.08s: and part of it was by accident because I
2822.64s: wasn't necessarily attempting to and
2825.52s: it's because I had managed those
2827.44s: expectations I didn't think that this
2830.02s: was going to happen so I didn't really
2832.12s: plan for it and then when it started to
2833.98s: happen I didn't have much of a plan
2836.62s: so my question is how do you how do you
2841.12s: think people not just Traders but how do
2843.82s: you think people should kind of dance
2846.58s: this dance of having good managed
2849.46s: expectations so that we can live happy
2851.20s: fulfilled lives against having enough
2854.80s: room so that we can grow and strive
2857.80s: without having these self-limiting
2860.14s: thoughts because of managing those
2862.06s: expectations
2863.38s: Eric Eric hard questions
2866.58s: but the right heart questions so
2871.14s: expectations if you expect really good
2875.14s: things to happen to you and they don't
2878.38s: boom always easy oh set expectations
2881.14s: boom you don't get them and it really
2883.78s: hurts and it is discouraging
2886.24s: so what do we do
2888.70s: um I kind of think of Life as a wave and
2891.10s: in trading we pop our head up every now
2893.68s: and then say Oh what's our p l or we put
2897.16s: our head into our future self what is
2901.18s: that like when I'm you know 10 years
2903.28s: from now 20 years from now and then we
2905.86s: go back to process
2907.60s: we do the processes we improve the
2910.12s: processes we stick our head up look
2912.34s: around and say oh how's this process
2914.20s: working and then back down and we can
2917.26s: still have in the mind
2919.96s: step into this Future Vision of
2922.42s: ourselves unless we have a vision of
2925.24s: ourselves
2926.80s: and again I talked about stepping into
2928.90s: the Traders Master mindset and seeing
2931.24s: who objects
2932.98s: we by creating this vision of ourselves
2936.64s: then we can allow ourselves to get there
2939.40s: our survival mechanism will not let us
2942.10s: go to a place that we haven't conceived
2944.56s: of and feel safe so one we we can have
2948.16s: that vision
2950.14s: and then where we get our Thrills is in
2953.02s: creating the process
2955.42s: stick our head up look around how we
2958.66s: doing okay
2960.28s: back to process so I don't know if
2963.16s: that's a complete answer or if it's if
2965.92s: it help if that model helps at all but
2969.52s: it certainly helps me you know process
2973.14s: outcome vision
2976.00s: well I think the thing that I like about
2978.04s: that as I kind of consider it is it kind
2980.56s: of creates an opportunity to re-baseline
2983.14s: based on where you're currently at and I
2985.48s: think that's really actually important
2987.34s: because when when I was in high school I
2989.86s: was just sitting there thinking I want
2991.36s: to have a bunch of money it's not
2992.86s: because I wanted to buy a bunch of
2994.18s: things necessarily but it's because I
2995.68s: wanted the security that money you know
2997.30s: provided I like right now I'm getting
2999.16s: the entire side of my house resurfaced
3002.16s: because of all the rain that we've had
3003.66s: and it's a minor inconvenience I don't
3007.20s: want to do it because the noise but
3009.18s: financially I genuinely don't care and
3012.36s: that's what I really strive to for a
3014.58s: long time is to be kind of in a place
3017.10s: where I was comfortable but I never knew
3021.54s: exactly how to forecast out far enough
3024.00s: because I think without
3025.86s: strong enough and high enough
3027.66s: aspirations we kind of put a glass
3030.18s: ceiling on things so what I really like
3032.64s: about that process that you mentioned is
3034.92s: you know that kind of poking your head
3036.60s: above the wave observing things but then
3038.70s: coming back down to process it gives an
3041.52s: opportunity to re-baseline on the
3043.74s: success that we've had and then when you
3046.02s: look back up to think okay well this is
3048.78s: still managed expectations but this now
3050.70s: raises the bar a little further and it
3052.92s: kind of enables that growth I actually
3054.36s: really like that I haven't thought of it
3056.58s: that way before yeah so if you stick
3058.92s: your head up and you look back and you
3061.02s: go whoa my goodness look what's happened
3065.34s: oh that's wonderful so rather than
3068.34s: saying I set expectations here
3070.98s: I'm waiting I'm waiting oh nothing
3074.10s: happened oh no what we're doing is I'm
3077.94s: focus on process and then I can enjoy
3080.94s: the Improvement we made because it isn't
3083.82s: a goal out there in the sense that uh
3086.82s: well you you know that if you set a goal
3089.70s: to make yourself happy you know the
3091.50s: Mansion or the fancy car or the or the
3094.50s: trophy spouse or whatever when you get
3096.54s: there
3097.98s: oh my gosh I need something else you
3100.44s: know if we're trying to fill that
3101.88s: emptiness that hole in our heart that
3104.10s: meaning in life and we're trying to do
3106.32s: it with things then we set those
3108.24s: expectations out there and even if we
3110.04s: get them
3110.88s: sometimes they're not satisfying so you
3114.06s: know what you said about the wave
3115.74s: process poke our heads out outcome look
3118.86s: back appreciate our our gains and our
3121.74s: progress oh my gosh does that feel so
3124.44s: good
3126.00s: I love that yeah I really really love
3128.52s: that and in the last few minutes here I
3132.24s: want to ask a completely non-trading
3133.92s: related question one that I've thought
3135.90s: about a lot
3137.40s: and it's family related so I have an
3141.60s: older brother he's four years older than
3143.52s: me love him to death but we are
3146.58s: completely different human beings we
3148.38s: have things that are very similar about
3150.24s: us but everything from the way we think
3153.30s: about time we think about our
3155.40s: environment we're just so different
3158.28s: I'm really curious I'm sure you have a
3161.04s: depth of experience I've done a lot of
3162.60s: reading about this the difference
3164.04s: between like sibling trajectory and you
3166.14s: know the circumstances what they're
3167.10s: brought up in all those kinds of things
3168.56s: but I'm just fascinated by it so from a
3173.22s: just general personal curiosity question
3176.12s: why are my brother and I so damn
3179.10s: different
3184.04s: it doesn't matter you know the real
3186.84s: question is if you love your brother
3189.06s: and you say our relationship is the most
3191.52s: important thing in fact I'm uh working
3194.88s: with a group that I started called
3196.50s: healing the political divide and it is
3199.92s: focusing on how do we manage our
3203.64s: best relationships and relationships and
3206.10s: business and elsewhere when somebody has
3208.56s: a a different philosophic base that is
3211.94s: up opposing ours how do we handle that
3216.00s: relationship and for me it's I I use the
3220.38s: phrase Family First
3222.50s: that's it family first so my kids
3226.50s: there's certain things that they have
3229.44s: gone off and believed and are very
3231.06s: different than me and my response is
3233.70s: family first I want the relationship and
3237.42s: that the differences can we use them to
3240.54s: create something better you know can
3242.40s: that diversity actually improve in fact
3245.64s: I find that some of the best
3247.04s: conversations I had around difficult
3249.48s: problems
3250.68s: are the ones where we're very different
3253.50s: and sometimes out of this
3255.44s: all comes Something Beautiful
3258.78s: yeah definitely I guess from my
3261.48s: perspective and to be clear we we
3263.34s: actually have a great relationship we we
3265.68s: have a lot of similarities I guess I was
3268.50s: I'm more just genuinely curious is it
3271.74s: just a function of different human
3274.08s: beings grow different ways and even
3276.18s: though he's my brother we grew
3277.80s: differently
3279.06s: um but like we don't have conflict like
3280.92s: we have a great relationship and stuff
3282.60s: I'm just so fascinated by the like he
3285.18s: went to the same schools I did you know
3286.68s: what I mean like we had a very similar
3288.36s: storybringing but yeah just very
3291.12s: different oh my gosh you know
3293.84s: neonatal environment
3296.36s: uh just brains the way they operate uh
3301.20s: his he may have started an earlier
3303.84s: belief of X and you started an early
3306.12s: beef of why and why kind of work for you
3309.00s: and you grew it he had an early brief
3311.52s: EXO he sees everything through X and as
3314.58s: a result he's grown that direction who
3317.10s: the heck knows but if you love your
3319.74s: brother and you have a great time so
3322.14s: what enjoy the relationship yeah and
3325.44s: that actually was really informative
3327.00s: right there because that was my
3328.14s: underlying assumption is that at some
3330.48s: points people kind of pick up different
3332.70s: you know paradigms that they do the
3335.10s: world and then that just kind of shapes
3336.90s: the way that the rest of things go so oh
3339.24s: my gosh you know how we filter
3341.24s: oh oh it's it's like once you start a
3345.60s: certain filter then that filter engages
3348.84s: other people who have the same filter
3350.58s: who then expands that filter and that's
3353.04s: all you see and as a result I think
3355.50s: that's part of the political divide
3357.12s: issue is that our filters are
3359.96s: self-reinforcing the groups we belong to
3362.64s: our self-reinforcing and all those
3364.92s: things once you start even a little bit
3367.38s: in a certain direction it can blossom
3369.54s: and you guys can be very different
3372.42s: yeah God I love that so the last thing I
3375.30s: want to end us with here is if there was
3377.76s: like one tool or technique that you
3380.76s: think every single retail Trader should
3383.46s: deploy what is it that would be the
3385.98s: golden keys
3387.48s: first is awareness
3389.28s: you know doing your set scores checking
3392.16s: in setting the alarm and some
3395.10s: engineering clients I have have no clue
3398.22s: as to what's going on inside of them
3400.68s: they're all in their heads
3403.08s: but so physical awareness or emotions
3406.32s: and the quality of our thoughts are we
3408.12s: being critical or whatever our thoughts
3410.46s: like so the golden keys is awareness and
3414.36s: the second part is acceptance
3417.78s: if I say damn it I'm judging myself
3420.18s: again stop it Richard
3423.50s: not very helpful but if I say oh that's
3426.90s: fascinating I have judgmental thoughts
3429.36s: in fact many many years ago I I took out
3432.36s: a jar and got 51 dollar bills from the
3435.48s: bank and every time I had a judgmental
3437.70s: thought I put a dollar in the jar
3440.58s: the fifties dollars didn't last a day
3445.68s: so acceptance oh that's interesting I
3448.80s: just had a judgmental thought so it's
3451.20s: awareness acceptance and then it is
3454.44s: agency now what do I want to do
3458.10s: I'm aware of it I accept my one of the
3461.04s: things you said earlier that was really
3462.72s: important is not stifling the Motions
3464.82s: but being aware of them and I'll expand
3467.16s: on that letting them come and letting
3468.96s: them go
3469.92s: so awareness acceptance and then agency
3472.44s: now what do I want and with awareness
3475.08s: and acceptance you can then start to
3477.30s: build up the awareness part can actually
3479.76s: develop agency from your higher self and
3482.76s: make decisions that serve you better
3485.52s: I love that that's awesome man thank you
3487.62s: for leaving us with that so I know that
3489.72s: you have your book
3490.98s: um which I'll throw a link to that in
3493.02s: the video description below for people
3494.58s: but how else can people find you where
3497.70s: where can people learn more about you
3499.56s: yeah conversations.money
3502.50s: and if you go to conversations.money
3504.72s: slash Eric and that's e-r-i-k with a K
3507.90s: what I'm going to do is I'll give them a
3510.48s: coupon for a free online course around
3512.40s: money and this is the stuff that I've
3514.80s: learned from years of trading and
3516.54s: training Traders so although it's not
3518.88s: Trader oriented we go through all the
3521.94s: processes about our relationship with
3523.98s: money and and how we screw it up and for
3526.26s: Traders this is so important because
3528.60s: it's all about money that's it
3531.72s: that's awesome well Richard honestly
3534.06s: thank you so much for you know hanging
3535.74s: out with me Sharon just a small snippet
3538.14s: of your experience obviously there's a
3539.70s: lot of depth there and I definitely look
3541.50s: forward to chatting with you again in
3543.42s: the future I find this state these
3545.76s: conversations are always curious to me
3547.38s: because I consider myself a just
3550.20s: tremendously ignorant person so getting
3552.54s: an opportunity to like pick some of this
3554.46s: stuff up is I mean it's just massive
3556.20s: it's super fun okay I'm gonna give you a
3559.08s: chance to rephrase that I am a continual
3561.72s: learner that just loves meeting people
3564.72s: and learning
3566.28s: that too but I'm also an idiot so
3569.90s: well I can see that you need a little
3573.06s: private coaching and we're going to set
3575.04s: it up
3578.00s: thank you so much I'm going to invite
3580.26s: you into a much more positive space
