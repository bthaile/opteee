0.76s: what's up everyone quick market update I
2.96s: am going to talk about gme in just a
5.44s: second I want to talk about a couple
7.12s: other broad Market things really fast
10.64s: specifically if we take a look at CPI it
13.60s: came in pretty light today so this
17.24s: starts to become interesting as we move
19.96s: forward because the market immediately
22.48s: took this to mean that we are going to
24.44s: be moving into a period of rate Cuts
29.44s: that's exactly what the market shifted
32.04s: today because you could tell large caps
35.24s: came down SPX then if we take a look at
38.16s: the Russell that flew off the handle to
41.40s: the upside it had one of its biggest
43.92s: biggest gaps and days year-to date for
46.72s: sure and in the near term so the market
51.00s: is starting to Pivot a little bit here
53.84s: and I just think it's important for
55.16s: people to be aware of that we also saw
58.36s: bonds see a bit of an update here as
61.36s: well as a lot of folks know I have kind
63.96s: of positions in a lot of the different
65.40s: indices themselves even TLT had a pretty
69.12s: significant Gap up here so from a
72.72s: broader perspective outside of the
75.00s: individual product that I typically talk
76.64s: about on the updates here I do want to
78.88s: let everybody to know that this is
81.24s: happening and this will trickle down to
83.56s: the sectors and it offers a ton of
86.96s: trading opportunities so just for
89.60s: General consumption now let's get back
92.12s: to what most people are more interested
94.84s: in hearing about which is GameStop and
97.24s: today unfortunately it was kind of a
98.84s: quiet day actually the reason why I'm
100.12s: making this video is because I'm trying
102.12s: to maintain the Cadence so that we
104.76s: essentially have an archive day by day
107.72s: of what happened in this thing so what
110.04s: did I notice today well a couple things
111.84s: the first thing is we did crack 25 there
114.28s: were a lot of people talking about how
116.96s: they felt the alos just wouldn't allow
120.08s: above
120.96s: 25 I honestly don't want to touch that
123.68s: because I can see the perspective that
125.84s: people have with that and the potential
128.12s: manipulation but I really want to stick
130.56s: to the things that I can decisively
132.48s: prove and what I can decisively prove
134.92s: here is this is above 25 so it did break
138.52s: above there which is cool to see the
140.56s: other thing I notice here is we are
142.60s: still on this uh scent what I mean by
145.16s: that is we're seeing slight drift on
148.56s: each of these days
150.68s: right so if we go back to the term
153.76s: low of one July that was where we
157.88s: hovered right on this what is this the
160.04s: 50 and we've been slowly drifting back
163.00s: up towards the point of control and
164.96s: that's kind of where we're hanging out
166.36s: now in terms of volume today it was
168.88s: light not
171.32s: supremely strong volume but there was a
174.48s: lot more buy volume as you can see right
177.48s: behind my head there this was yesterday
181.12s: and then this is today obviously
184.16s: yesterday was vast majority sale volume
186.80s: today it's almost even split it's like
188.80s: 50/50 it's 45 buy volume 55 sale volume
192.64s: so that is kind of telling to me again
194.68s: like I go back to this thing where I
197.56s: feel
198.68s: like even
200.68s: though the vast majority of people that
203.16s: are shorting this stock would love
205.12s: nothing more than to push this way back
208.48s: down to sub 10 and again I try to talk
211.08s: about things that I can prove and from a
213.24s: short sellers perspective that's
215.64s: advantageous to their position they
217.00s: would want that so the fact that it's
219.88s: not being pushed down there even on this
223.04s: really light buy volume again is kind of
226.20s: telling to me it looks like we are
227.80s: building in a little bit of a floor now
230.84s: a floor can fall out at any point for
232.96s: any reason but the fact that it's been
235.32s: drifting in here tells me that there's
237.40s: at least some semblance of strength in
239.12s: the stock from a price perspective
242.08s: because otherwise with such light buying
244.76s: volume if there was Heavy selling it
248.08s: there would be nothing to support it
249.36s: here but the fact of the matter is
250.76s: that's not happening so that's been
253.36s: really interesting to keep an eyeball on
256.08s: pivoting over now to the options a
258.32s: couple things volume today
261.52s: cratered yesterday this was over
265.16s: 300,000 and today it's now sub 200,000
269.28s: so it's back back down to a pretty low
271.16s: point and when I look at where we're
273.28s: seeing most of the volume again we're
275.36s: starting to see more exposure to other
278.16s: expiration Cycles I see exposure to the
280.80s: 12 July which is the purple 19 July
284.04s: which is the blue and then the 26th July
286.88s: which is kind of like this pinkish red
289.32s: whatever this color is I'm not good with
290.72s: colors but whatever this is that one so
294.20s: we're still very very centralized in the
297.00s: front expirations right that's the next
298.72s: three in the cycle so if we take a look
300.88s: at the
301.80s: oi by these cycles and we take a look
305.84s: first at 12 July there is 157,000 that
309.08s: are coming down tomorrow there's 325,000
313.04s: in 19 July which is pretty
315.68s: massive and then in 26 July we're just
318.88s: starting to build out this is now at
321.36s: 58,000 so again as per usual all of the
324.56s: activities in these front two
325.60s: expirations that is without a doubt now
328.68s: a couple things did stick out to me here
331.80s: the very first one is going back to
333.28s: volume if we take a look at this this is
336.92s: the 19 July 30s they're they're active
341.00s: again they're very active we saw
343.32s: activity in these 30s not that long ago
346.80s: and they're definitely being transacted
348.60s: at again so if we pop in there's over
350.84s: 20,000 transactions there so if we come
353.84s: out here to the 30s right now the oi was
358.52s: 59,000 now it's up to 20,500 that's a
361.80s: big big change
365.84s: so it's hard to say right because this
368.80s: is really big volume for this and it's 8
373.28s: days out I sometimes do feel like I talk
376.56s: into the wind when I'm trying to help
378.68s: people think about buying options
380.76s: slightly differently this isn't a
382.92s: terrible trade if you're expecting big
385.44s: upside but it kind of just feels like
387.72s: people are going back into like the
389.04s: abusive relationship where it's not
391.36s: necessarily changing in the shortest
393.40s: time frame that we might want and it's
395.44s: taken a little longer and these people
397.72s: are just getting chewed up because
400.08s: here's the deal 26 Delta is not bad but
403.08s: take a look at the price of these
404.48s: options it's essentially 79.5 cents on a
408.40s: daily basis they're losing 11 to 12
411.60s: cents so let's take a look at that on a
414.32s: percentage basis 11 cents on something
417.92s: that's 79 cents 79 and a half I guess
421.96s: 795 it is
425.00s: 13.8% of the option premium that's
427.20s: decaying each day it's just a lot again
431.44s: I I have no problem adding kicker
433.00s: options or something where I think that
434.36s: there's going to be some sort of big
435.56s: move but this is just it's tough to make
438.28s: money this way so as you can tell it
440.36s: always pains me if we were getting a lot
442.60s: of like really big upside or if this is
445.16s: a really small subset of people's
446.96s: positions I would feel differently but
449.24s: again I can tell it's not because if I
451.64s: look at the open interest across these
453.68s: different expirations it's all in these
456.68s: super shortterm options if I go out here
458.76s: to 16 August which still isn't that far
461.00s: out it's 36 Days that's only at 140,000
464.84s: and I think I've already told you guys
466.12s: but I'm out here in the 20 September
468.44s: with like 10 other homies so I have much
472.80s: further expiration exposure and it's for
475.12s: a bunch of different reasons I'll link
476.36s: to that same video I've shared a bunch
477.68s: of times so far on how to think about
479.08s: buying call options to try to help some
481.16s: folks now when I look at the disposition
484.40s: of the transactions today callide was
488.16s: definitely sale heavy but only by three
490.64s: points right so 32% transacted at the
492.88s: bid or below and then on the put side
495.48s: the vast majority here was Buys so 26%
498.92s: was selling puts 34% buying puts so
501.84s: definitely some heavy heavy buying
503.64s: activity on the put side which obviously
506.52s: would favor the downside a little bit
508.96s: another important thing I'm noticing
510.40s: here take a look at the difference
514.04s: between the call and put oi we're
517.52s: starting to get very close to one
519.32s: another not not one to one yet but and
522.64s: we still have definitely a call skew but
524.80s: this is getting Tighter and Tighter than
526.16s: what it used to be this used to be easy
528.56s: two times three times four times what we
531.00s: saw on the put side not so much anymore
534.64s: right now we have 900,000 calls to
536.88s: 500,000 puts so that Gap is Clos more
539.88s: people are transacting on the put side
541.88s: and you can tell another thing that's
543.20s: really interesting in terms of where
544.84s: we're centralized on the put side it's
547.40s: kind of all over the place right so we
549.32s: have the 19 July we have what is this
552.84s: one the 17 genan 25 so people hedging
555.80s: long-term positions 16 o 24s I don't
559.28s: know what this one is let's see 18 o 24
562.60s: so the point is the these guys are all
564.52s: over the place where still the vast
568.44s: majority of the oi
569.88s: on the call side is in the shorter term
572.12s: expirations again the 12 July the 19
574.84s: July there are some spikes that we can
577.56s: see here like the 16 augs as well as um
581.96s: this one which again is the 17 J 25s but
584.52s: those are more the exception than the
586.04s: rule so the last thing I want to take a
588.60s: look at is from the volume
590.56s: today we did see again a lot of
593.68s: transactions here at the 19 July
596.20s: 2430s so I wanted to take a look at them
599.36s: and see what's going on there are an
602.40s: interesting number of Trades but all of
605.84s: these essentially that transacted on the
609.24s: what I would assume to be the buy side
612.08s: especially these ones also that are
613.56s: coming in at the mid like this one right
616.16s: it was bid at 71 offered at 75 so they
621.04s: flag it white as in coming in towards
623.40s: the mid but that's almost
626.04s: certainly a buy it's it's right right by
629.12s: the offer so I would assume that these
632.08s: are a a purchase same thing with these
634.20s: right bid at 72 offered at 75 came in at
637.28s: 74 I would also classify these as a buy
640.48s: it's much closer to the offer than the
643.20s: bid so when I look at kind of these
645.68s: series of purchase transactions this
647.88s: actually isn't a small total position
650.24s: but I also am not convinced that it's
652.64s: the same person necessarily because
656.12s: there's kind of a enough space between
658.36s: all of these transaction
660.32s: so all I'm saying is it's inconclusive
662.04s: you can't tell it absolutely can be the
663.88s: same person but this also could be other
666.52s: people that part is kind of hard to tell
668.88s: from this overall though some decent
672.40s: size coming into these right like these
675.68s: cumulatively equal a a pretty decent Siz
678.72s: position so it's something to keep an
680.64s: eye on as we're moving into specifically
682.92s: the 19 July but you can tell that this
685.72s: is becoming the way more interesting
688.04s: expiration right like a lot of people
689.48s: were betting on some big activity here
691.44s: the 12th of July and it still may happen
693.28s: right today's the 11th it we could see
695.64s: it on the 12th just right now it's not
698.76s: leaning that way as far as we can tell
702.16s: so what it's going to look like at least
704.12s: as far as I can see so
706.48s: far there are a lot of options with
712.00s: medium oi it's definitely not heavy oi
714.56s: for GameStop right like as I look at
716.96s: this the biggest is 16,000 which just is
719.24s: isn't that much and people have been
720.60s: going out to these really far
721.76s: expirations for a while now we did get a
723.88s: net change which is actually kind of
725.60s: crazy to me yesterday positive 554 this
728.12s: could be locating it that wouldn't
730.20s: surprise me but at this point it there's
734.12s: also a lot of single transactions in
735.92s: here which again to me looks like a lot
737.60s: of Lotto buying and and hoping which is
739.88s: a tough way again to make money in
741.60s: markets so the 12 July is kind of
744.24s: starting to slow down it looks like
746.12s: although we still see heavy activity
748.32s: here at the 26 is
750.88s: 14788 volume against 11,000 so there's
753.48s: people opening positions there that's
755.00s: definitive there's no doubt about it but
758.20s: the question is do we get a big pull
760.72s: through move tomorrow so if we look at
762.24s: this from uh options pricing as a
764.28s: probability tool standpoint we can come
766.52s: up with some ideas here so if we go to
768.52s: this probability
770.28s: analysis we can see what this might look
772.60s: like for tomorrow and we can see what
774.96s: the probability of touching some of
776.36s: these different prices are so if we take
778.60s: a look at the 12th the probability of
782.08s: touching
784.40s: 2334 is about 16% chance and then 2777
789.72s: is about 16 this is a one standard
791.40s: deviation cone by the way so that's why
793.32s: they're both at 16% but it just gives
794.88s: you an idea of range tomorrow it's a 16%
797.28s: chance of touching 27
799.40s: 16% perc chance of getting down to like
802.88s: 23 and A2 so not not a not a giant range
807.64s: now the interesting part though is that
808.88s: if this does start drifting up towards
810.60s: this 27
812.08s: handle these 26s fall in the money
815.40s: there's some oi not a ton so I don't see
820.80s: this serving as some sort of massive
822.72s: gamma ramp although I absolutely would
825.44s: expect to see some hedging activity
827.56s: coming into expiration if these do fall
829.60s: in the money so it can get interesting
832.12s: but this doesn't look like it would be
834.04s: the impetus for a massive massive
837.00s: squeeze whether it's a gamma squeeze
839.48s: short squeeze either or I don't really
842.44s: see that being the trigger here you kind
844.40s: of need like really heavy oi and
847.92s: especially if it's stacked right so in
850.48s: this case it's light across the entire
852.48s: exporation cycle so we'll see who knows
856.24s: you never know that's the fun part with
858.12s: GameStop it's kind of like watching
859.56s: heavyweights fight they always have a
861.80s: puncher's chance so because they have
864.04s: the power to put somebody to sleep they
865.32s: can lose five rounds and then in the
867.40s: fifth round essentially Knocks somebody
869.32s: cold so that could be the case here but
872.16s: so far it's looking relatively quiet
874.64s: until we see a little bit more of a
876.84s: catalist interesting that price was not
878.92s: pushed down but we will see how we
881.28s: follow through tomorrow obviously I'm
883.04s: here keeping an eye on it so any
884.52s: questions let me know be an outlier see
886.20s: you guys later
