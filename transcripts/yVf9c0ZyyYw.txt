586.00s: you
588.00s: get
590.00s: to
598.00s: sizing so that you don't necessarily feel quite that way.
602.88s: Because you shouldn't feel like that off about it.
607.88s: Slight level of discomfort, fine, but it shouldn't be that significant.
614.80s: So, um, Reese says, that's why I said discord things.
619.60s: Yeah, that's my bad.
620.44s: I totally realized that I had it as unlisted.
623.76s: I, the reason why is because I reuse old ones.
627.60s: So sometimes it'll adopt weird settings, but.
632.72s: Let's get back over to the flexible grid quick.
635.68s: So we already talked about the net highs lows and the lower breadth that we're seeing going through this general up move.
643.84s: Now, I want to talk about where we're seeing strength and weakness and what do you, what sticks out to you about this series of million charts.
655.44s: What's there should be something like.
658.88s: Directly drawing your eyeballs.
661.64s: The market has had one of its best one week periods, not like full trading week one day to Friday, but five days in quite a while.
672.56s: And there's something that immediately draws my eye.
678.24s: Take a look at the different sectors.
680.80s: Do we see anything in materials?
684.56s: No, dark mark is on the right track.
687.92s: Dark Mark says they look very similar movement.
690.48s: Most of them do.
693.52s: But there are a couple that's not and specifically one that sticks out like an absolute sore thumb.
703.96s: The reason why you have to train your eyes to look for these kinds of relationships is because underneath the surface of this is exactly where opportunity lives literally exactly where opportunity lives.
716.24s: So re says VIX.
717.80s: It's not VIX.
718.76s: I would look at VIX different than everything else already because it's a volatility exchange traded product.
724.84s: VTP.
725.68s: So not VIX.
728.52s: What do you notice about this one right here?
733.68s: It's kind of like where's Waldo because there's so many graphs.
740.28s: Lauren says XLV that's exactly correct.
742.76s: Literally 100% correct.
746.24s: Literally everything else is at least marginally participating in the upside here.
756.04s: Literally everything except XLV.
761.60s: XLV has been getting beaten down like a dog and it's not slowing down.
769.00s: It had one minor reprieve on the 12th and that was about it.
774.00s: So if we go to XLV just to look first at the sector level, this is what it looks like over the last six months.
783.48s: This thing is getting crushed.
786.40s: Then if you take a look at what might not be helping you and H.
793.80s: So you and H is literally down another 20, 30 points after hours.
803.12s: UNH is getting yes, I own sleepers on it exactly.
806.76s: Silen sleeper says UNH dying in after us.
809.60s: It's exactly correct.
810.96s: It's getting smashed.
813.04s: Now we talked about this on Sunday and I literally told you guys that immediately following that conversation on Sunday.
824.76s: I put a position on to trade it to the downside.
828.24s: I went with long puts and short calls.
831.16s: So I made synthetic shorts and it's honestly just because I didn't have a sense of severity.
836.76s: There's no part of my body that expected this gap or this continuation or the next gap that we're seeing.
843.92s: That's not why the trade went on.
845.32s: And there's no way that I would take any credit for that movement.
849.28s: I didn't expect that severity.
850.68s: I expected the direction.
852.52s: But if I expected this full severity, I would have gone long out of the money puts at scale.
859.52s: That's exactly how I would have played this had I known the future, but I didn't.
864.20s: So that's why I went with synthetic shorts because it gives you a little bit of both worlds.
869.48s: You can kind of finance some of the long puts from the short calls.
873.48s: The problem with stuff like this is the ball is all on the put side.
878.52s: So you actually have to size up on the call side quite a bit in order to get something close to what you might want to finance the long puts.
885.52s: So not fully optimal, but you make it work, right?
889.92s: That's the whole idea here.
893.52s: But identifying opportunities like this is huge.
898.36s: And it's not just you and H, by the way, it's again, if we go back into XLV.
905.12s: As the sector, we've seen this for a while where it's underperforming literally the rest of the sectors.
911.92s: So when you see something doing that, it should always draw your attention even from a very loose perspective.
919.92s: And when I say loose perspective, I mean, even from like, hey, this sticks out to me.
926.32s: So if we take a look at the sectors and then we go into healthcare,
932.92s: let's take a look at the five day change.
936.92s: On the five day change, I don't know how many names are in this in total.
941.72s: Then anybody know off the top of your head. I don't remember.
945.92s: So face it to say what I was going to give you is like the number that are up after the last five days compared to the number that's down.
953.52s: Just don't know how many ends and I'm not going to count.
955.72s: But what we can do is see how many are up, which is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty, three.
967.72s: And that's absolutely a minority because I have to scroll twice, essentially, to get to the rest of this list.
972.72s: So this gives you good pot odds from finding things to trade to the short side.
980.32s: And the other thing to pay attention to as you're analyzing stuff like this is take a look at PODD.
987.32s: If we look into PODD, PODD just had a baller earnings release.
998.32s: Absolutely crushed it. Notice how EPS actually underperformed, but they had a good overall earnings release.
1006.32s: Why am I showing you this? I'm showing you this because this gives you another great exercise to always add to your market analysis toolkit.
1016.32s: And that is when you see big sectors that are down that are literally getting dragged down by the bulk, find the strength.
1025.32s: See what's strong? That doesn't mean you have to trade this. I still personally wouldn't to be completely honest with you.
1031.32s: It's just not worth it. There's other opportunities out there. Is that a bad trade? I don't think it's terrible.
1036.32s: But there's other stuff out there that's more appealing to me right now. However, you had better believe that this gets added to a watch list because we know PODD is doing really well when the majority of this sector is absolutely sucking wind.
1052.32s: That's a good thing to keep in your back pocket because what do you think sometimes not always, but sometimes if in the near term if the timing lines up and health care for whatever reason starts seeing appreciation, a lot of times you'll see some of that bleed into the top performers.
1070.32s: Now, you can apply a wrote system though and say, okay, I'm going to go long PODD once health care goes up because there's a momentum factor.
1080.32s: And there's a really high chance for reversion in momentum, depending on what time frames you're analyzing. You have to be aware of this because otherwise you could very easily be setting yourself to be put in front of positions that you think should be better.
1099.32s: And they might not be so that's something to pay attention to here. Now with momentum factor, something to keep in mind is typically speaking, there's a couple key time frames that matter a lot.
1113.32s: So like one month, three months, six month, 12 month, those were like really common periods to analyze. Six months, 12 month, tend to have higher continuation. This is largely for growth stocks.
1124.32s: One month, three month often have reversion. So not always it's again, it's a statistical measure. There will be plenty that don't, but it's something to keep in the back of your mind as you look at it.
1134.32s: Because like seeing this kind of really good move over the course of one month, right, where a good majority of this move comes over the last month.
1144.32s: Well, you kind of have to pay attention to that now this does not get overwhelmed by post earnings announcement drift, however, if you have a really strong catalyst like post earnings announcement drift that can overwhelm a lot of momentum reversion tendencies.
1162.32s: Welcome to momentum, a lot of different factors. There's actually some really, really good studies out there. Let me find one of them for you from SSRN.
1171.32s: This is intro day. I don't want that.
1183.32s: No. This one.
1192.32s: This one.
1197.32s: So this one is a pre print. So it's nothing to overweight, but that is a great paper nonetheless. You just always have to again pay attention to what you're reading the pros and cons.
1214.32s: This is also a really great paper and this one is useful for shorter term effects. I'll drop these really quick.
1226.32s: In the discord so that you have access to them if you're interested in them, but these are really, really good to check out.
1239.32s: If you're interested in momentum, which I feel like a lot of people generally should be interested in momentum.
1247.32s: Because it is one of the simpler market effects that exists.
1253.32s: So.
1256.32s: Moody Blu says, can you take a look at AMD? It seemed to have broken down broken. It's downtrend. However, it's sold down this morning. Yeah, let's take a look.
1265.32s: The broader tech moves here have been absolutely incredible. Let's see.
1286.32s: Damn, that's a tough one.
1298.32s: So.
1306.32s: This still absolutely wouldn't be for me unless I thought there was some sort of big value play, which I don't know if there is we can check real fast.
1319.32s: But without some sort of value element to it, I don't like it here.
1326.32s: And.
1330.32s: Yeah, it's so tough because I feel like the reason I'm still conflicted here is because I feel like AMD is in such a great position to partake in such a significant amount of the broader AI adoption for a list of different reasons.
1347.32s: And so, I think that's a lot of the way that I'm not participating in the AI.
1352.32s: AMD is not participating well at all.
1356.32s: So it creates a natural conflict in the way that I look at it.
1360.32s: Because I do think that there is genuine opportunity here. And if you get into these things at lower levels, you reduce your overall risk.
1369.32s: And if you get into the AI, you're going to have to be able to do a lot of things.
1374.32s: And then you're going to have to be able to do a lot of things.
1379.32s: And then you're going to have to be able to do a lot of things.
1384.32s: And then you're going to have to be able to do a lot of things.
1388.32s: And then you're going to have to be able to do a lot of things.
1392.32s: And then you're able to bottom ticket, you just rode something for 56%.
1397.32s: So great move.
1399.32s: But again, if you're anywhere not even top ticking it, if you're anywhere up here, what I'm hovering on is the point of control, which is where the majority of people transacted over the last year, those people are down 52%.
1415.32s: And in total, I mean, they're just, they're not even close, right?
1420.32s: Because remember the way that percentages work.
1422.32s: When you're down 52%, you need a significantly larger upside move in order to get back to break even.
1430.32s: I have a table here that shows it to you on my website specifically for this reason, because it's useful here.
1443.32s: So if you take a look, 52% down move, you need 100 in 604.
1451.32s: You need in the reason why I'm adding 106 is you have to account for a little bit of the volatility component to it.
1460.32s: But in a gross move, you need essentially double and change in order to get back.
1466.32s: And it's not even halfway there yet.
1468.32s: Well, I guess it is just halfway there.
1470.32s: I should say give it some credit.
1471.32s: So that's why the value element in my mind is so important, there has to be something that justifies this.
1482.32s: So let's see what we can find.
1494.32s: Let's see.
1497.32s: I got to pop the door for Thor.
1507.32s: You sit there just one little scratch at a time.
1511.32s: Let me know it's time for him to come in.
1515.32s: So let's see.
1521.32s: I'm going to actually look more so at its earnings.
1531.32s: I also don't know why they would use the trailing 12 month for the PE ratio.
1535.32s: I care so much more about a forward PE.
1541.32s: Yeah, I mean, like what this like does this shock you?
1546.32s: I don't really care so much about HPE and C gate like you can call them closer or whatever.
1551.32s: But specifically AMD to micron and IBM, I think that's a fair comparison.
1557.32s: Take a look at the value.
1560.32s: Right.
1561.32s: It's it's really, really difficult to argue any sort of like value proposition here.
1571.32s: But could just be that people start to say like I think this is overvalued and not really interested in it at this spot, which I wouldn't blame on because like I told you in order for me to be interested in it, there literally would have to be some sort of reasonable value element to this that I just don't see at the moment with how at police house priced.
1598.32s: Let's take a look at the options though. That's way, way more than anybody needs about my fucking opinion.
1604.32s: And let's see what we can objectively learn.
1607.32s: What I'm doing is I'm throwing it up in another comparison tool real quick here.
1611.32s: The reason why I like this one is because it breaks down a couple things a little more in depth that I like to take a look at.
1619.32s: So this is these here are really useful.
1623.32s: So revenue growth is good.
1630.32s: Yes, he like this is better. This is way better.
1634.32s: And this is why like forward P.E. so much more than trailing 12 months because on a forward P.E. basis this actually looks good trailing 12 months.
1644.32s: I don't love it there, but price to sales is soft, but not do soft.
1661.32s: I mean, it's way cheaper on a relative basis than in video, which I would have to expect.
1683.32s: I don't care about these here growth.
1689.32s: Yeah, growth is growth is good.
1694.32s: So I think there is an argument there at least somewhat. Let's take a look at the options.
1700.32s: Market thinks so.
1702.32s: So 2.26 mill on the call side. That's pretty heavy.
1710.32s: On the day.
1713.32s: I can split. That's interesting.
1716.32s: bid to offer. Let's take a look on a weighted basis.
1724.32s: So this is either a pretty healthy bit of profit taking that you see.
1752.32s: And that's incredible.
1758.32s: The reason why I'm stuck on this is take a look at it on a relative basis.
1762.32s: If we look over the last 30 days, I mean, you've not seen downside premium this heavy.
1769.32s: So that's that's nuts.
1771.32s: So a bunch of volume in the out of the money super short term that's.
1777.32s: Part for the course.
1779.32s: We look at open interest, which I'm more interested in.
1783.32s: That's so funny. What a great pond.
1788.32s: Yeah.
1789.32s: So the options positioning is a little bit bullish.
1794.32s: I would say like overall options markets.
1797.32s: Now it's always really, really difficult to tell, you know, what the what the market is trying to.
1805.32s: What I mean is that the market is going to show.
1808.32s: What I mean, like the one 18s are heavy on the call side, the one 29s are relatively.
1815.32s: Not a ton.
1822.32s: And then let's take a look at the.
1831.32s: Across the board, like pretty heavy, pretty heavy calls you.
1837.32s: And let's do one other thing really fast.
1839.32s: Let's take a look at the.
1841.32s: Vault surface and then we'll take a look at another stock.
1846.32s: To the out of the monies.
1853.32s: About to Jan will clear off this front.
1859.32s: So elevated on the 20 June to the call side, but still standard.
1865.32s: Standard surface as far as I'm concerned.
1872.32s: And if we go super far out.
1875.32s: A bit flatter.
1877.32s: Yeah.
1880.32s: I think I would consider this like a really speculative recover kind of play.
1885.32s: I don't really if you like it longer term, you know, that's one way to look at it.
1891.32s: But the business in my opinion really needs to finish turning itself around what it's starting to do with decent earnings.
1899.32s: So I would want to see a couple personally.
1904.32s: The way that I look at it is it's not like there's anything that I think here is terrible with AMD.
1910.32s: But I have to look at it in the context of like where's the opportunity and how does this stack against other opportunities that exist.
1919.32s: And right now I just think there's so many great opportunities.
1922.32s: If you're trying to do like near term recovery style trading that this one at least for me wouldn't be super high on the list.
1930.32s: There's a lot of other stuff that I think looks really good.
1933.32s: But it does have wind at its back at how to good earnings.
1936.32s: It just has a really, really long history of a down move to work through right like this is just so much overhead resistance that companies that get bogged down like this.
1950.32s: They have to get through so much shit before they can really start to rally.
1955.32s: And it's this is why I like smaller growth names for directional trading a lot because a lot of them don't have the scars like this that they're going to have to overcome.
1965.32s: If you look at something like Reddit.
1967.32s: This is another great example of something that came out of the gate super hot.
1972.32s: And it's starting to show more strength and I like the way that it's looking.
1978.32s: But you can literally see even the price action on the day.
1982.32s: Right. I'm not super big into candlestick analysis, but I do like looking at what candles represent in terms of supply and demand right the overall drivers of the market.
1994.32s: And if you take a look at what happened it had a really aggressive up move on the day.
2002.32s: And then the market started selling off into it the market start saying I'll start de-risking here some of these people maybe they're happy to get out at break even or whatever the cases.
2012.32s: So when you have this near term overhead it always just serves as a natural suppressor to price.
2019.32s: And you can always go through it. It's possible, but you need a strong enough catalyst the longer.
2024.32s: The overhead is there and the deeper it is the more you need to overcome it.
2031.32s: So then the question to me always is not is there a trade here the outlier way to think about it is is this the right place for my money.
2040.32s: And that's why for me AMD wouldn't be right now.
2044.32s: But if you have a longer term perspective could be fine.
2051.32s: Next one.
2054.32s: Reese says where did you drop those links I dropped them in the pro side of the discord just because I had it up but I'll move them into the main discord as well so that you guys all have access to it.
2066.32s: Braimus says what are the purpose of the convertible notes.
2070.32s: GME issued the purpose of those notes is a slick way to be able to accumulate some capital to purchase Bitcoin without having to burn a bunch of their money.
2084.32s: So that's really the purpose and it's a way to do it without near term dilution there is a potential dilution in the future depending on how they choose to resolve them.
2093.32s: But in the near term there isn't so then you can overwhelm the cost let's say if you get into Bitcoin and Bitcoin does really well while you're in it that kind of stuff.
2105.32s: So it gives them some choices I would say.
2109.32s: Any thoughts on target one wants to know let's take a look at some TGT.
2116.32s: Up.
2127.32s: The tables is under performing discretionary.
2142.32s: I mean it looks awful.
2148.32s: That is that's about how I feel about it.
2155.32s: I'm a little.
2157.32s: Little angry at myself because this is like a standard near time short side play that I like to run that I completely didn't catch which makes me angry.
2174.32s: It's like a really high probability play.
2178.32s: And then what the dividend come damn I fucked out a big time I don't miss that.
2190.32s: I'm not the fuck I miss that it's frustrating.
2195.32s: Amen.
2198.32s: Let's see how it looks.
2201.32s: Coming into earnings so earnings is on the 21st.
2210.32s: Even split.
2214.32s: Yeah pretty even split.
2217.32s: So it's just a couple of months to put.
2220.32s: And let's take a look in the cycle itself.
2232.32s: Which this is the cycle that's going to hold.
2235.32s: So it looks like a pretty big long premium.
2241.32s: That split both ways.
2244.32s: So not really a clear directional trend from.
2249.32s: The options markets in the way that they've built out together also tells me that there's not like some sort of really strong near term speculation that is starting to pipe up they've literally been growing effectively in unison.
2265.32s: And then we're going to look at another.
2268.32s: So I find that.
2271.32s: Generally interesting.
2274.32s: Now let's take a look at the actual.
2279.32s: Exploration I want to look at it by premium.
2284.32s: And we need this expiration here.
2288.32s: So looks like.
2291.32s: And we're going to look at it more.
2294.32s: On the put side.
2299.32s: 290K at the 95s.
2305.32s: So that's a fair.
2309.32s: Downside expectation style positioning for earnings.
2313.32s: But what you're going to see is with so much.
2317.32s: You're absolutely going to see.
2322.32s: A big shift in the next earning cycle because what's going to happen over the next couple days in target.
2329.32s: You'll find that the front expiration is going to be pretty jacked in terms of volume.
2334.32s: And that'll be people moving out.
2336.32s: A little further in time.
2337.32s: So this is people playing this near term move.
2340.32s: And then.
2341.32s: They'll probably start positioning how they want for earnings.
2345.32s: So it'll be the next couple days in my opinion that will be a little more informative with how the market is looking to position.
2352.32s: But if I were trading this it would only be from an earnings lens.
2357.32s: And we can see.
2359.32s: How it typically.
2361.32s: Like to behave around earnings here.
2368.32s: Which is.
2370.32s: A little bit haywire.
2373.32s: And.
2374.32s: Yeah, I mean, it's literally all over the place.
2377.32s: So if we look over the last 12 quarters, six of them.
2380.32s: Have been outside.
2382.32s: So this almost becomes more for like a long premium style strategy.
2386.32s: But that's not really my go to.
2388.32s: I'm not going to say that I'm going to be trading for earnings.
2391.32s: So I wouldn't touch it for earnings either.
2394.32s: Rotter sector is not looking good to me.
2398.32s: So yeah.
2400.32s: The way that I look at stuff like this.
2403.32s: Is unless you have a direct opinion related to earnings.
2409.32s: This is just something I would wait until post earnings right and see how it resolves.
2415.32s: So I'm sort of directional speculation or a wall speculation for earnings.
2420.32s: Then it's a little too early to put those trades on in my opinion.
2424.32s: So I see a few ways to play it.
2427.32s: You can try to play the near term downside continuation.
2430.32s: Expecting vault to continue to slowly climb.
2434.32s: That's one way to go about it.
2438.32s: And you can see that generally reflected here, right?
2442.32s: 30 day term vault is sliding up.
2445.32s: And then you can interpolate that out to near term vault and, you know, probably expect a similar near term trend of climbing into the release.
2455.32s: So yeah, that's how I would generally look at it.
2462.32s: Near term downside.
2464.32s: Probably expecting fall expansion or just waiting till earnings.
2469.32s: I think waiting till earnings is probably the way that I would go.
2479.32s: F R says, what do you think about Tesla?
2482.32s: Let's take a look at Tesla for F R Tesla.
2488.32s: Interesting.
2491.32s: Tesla is notorious for how much volatility it carries.
2498.32s: And if you ever needed a reminder of that, you can always look at average true range average day ranges for pretty much any reference period realistically.
2512.32s: So because of that, I tend to like trading Tesla more from a vault perspective.
2520.32s: Now, if somebody has a directional opinion in Tesla, I feel like the one of the only suitable ways I could even conceive of trying to trade that is with a longer term play in mind.
2535.32s: Just because of how.
2539.32s: How it moves is a way to consider.
2543.32s: Riki says Tesla looks very do for a decent sized pullback.
2547.32s: You can't look at markets that way.
2549.32s: Like it's just not how it works.
2551.32s: Right. So if you take a look at Tesla on a longer term time frame.
2556.32s: You could argue like during this big up move, it was due for a pullback much earlier.
2563.32s: Right. And the reason for this actually is not even a whole lot from the stock.
2568.32s: It's from a mix of like stock and perception of things.
2572.32s: So with that in mind, I think trying to play things like that with the quote unquote like do for a pullback, unless you can quantify it in some sort of way and you're trying to play some sort of mean reversion than yes.
2588.32s: So like for example, what I can tell you is over different periods.
2596.32s: Tesla has displayed a pretty high tendency based on a Hurst exponent for price mean reversion.
2604.32s: And then what I can do is actually quantify the price that it tends to mean revert to relative to current price.
2611.32s: So right now it's a pretty fair Hurst exponent for a version back to like 279.
2619.32s: So that doesn't mean that it will do that.
2623.32s: But it means that there is absolutely a tendency for that kind of two sided movement.
2630.32s: So one of the ways that I would play something like that if I was expecting some sort of pullback is I would literally just set a couple alerts.
2640.32s: And then if it starts breaking down through this recent move, then I mean pretty much anything below here.
2648.32s: Right. Once it starts falling meaningfully below like the 316 317 handle if it does.
2653.32s: Then it starts to look like pretty likely to move down into the point of control.
2658.32s: At least somewhat, but right now if it starts plowing through this volume node, then it's a pretty clear sign to me that it's bid and people want to speculate upside.
2670.32s: So that's how I would play something like that.
2673.32s: And with options for these kinds of things, especially really, really short term ideas.
2679.32s: I generally speaking like to go further out in time, but these are the kinds of plays where I'm expecting to hold it for maybe five days if that.
2689.32s: So I don't go out that far in time. It's not like more of a positional style play.
2693.32s: It's like a very, very short term idea.
2695.32s: So for those you would probably find me in like 30 day or 60 day options.
2700.32s: I typically prefer the 60 days in this kind of thing, but the 30 day might be fine.
2705.32s: I'd have to take a look and see what theta looks like comparatively.
2709.32s: Let's see.
2712.32s: These are at 33 cents.
2717.32s: These are at 25 cents.
2722.32s: I don't think these would have no gamma though.
2727.32s: Yeah, the gamma is like super light.
2730.32s: So if I was expecting a near term move, I would probably do like the 37 and plant hold it for like five days.
2737.32s: But if you don't, if like I didn't get the move fast enough, yeah, time to time to bounce.
2743.32s: So and it's just because theta would be coming in way too hot and heavy in that instance.
2748.32s: My foot is hitting a crunchy toy.
2753.32s: This is under my foot right now.
2756.32s: Maybe this should go on the mic.
2759.32s: So this is the new, the new mascot door is looking highly concerned right now.
2769.32s: He's very, very concerned.
2772.32s: Hold on.
2782.32s: He will be getting.
2788.32s: He's not so sure about it.
2795.32s: It's a, it's a good hat.
2800.32s: So he's typically like really reserved with grabbing the toy.
2807.32s: So he knows that he's not supposed to unless he's allowed to like give him permission.
2815.32s: So if you guys want to see something cool, check this out.
2819.32s: Leave it.
2822.32s: Watch.
2824.32s: Leave it.
2825.32s: I can pat him with it.
2828.32s: Touch it.
2830.32s: I can put it on him.
2833.32s: You want to touch it until I say, OK.
2838.32s: And then you'll grab it.
2843.32s: All right.
2846.32s: Octopus.
2848.32s: Octopus primed down.
2852.32s: Yeah.
2853.32s: So I think.
2855.32s: I think Tesla goes back to 270 and time soon as if there's bad news with tariffs or some other market
2859.32s: calamity.
2861.32s: That's the, that's the thing, right?
2863.32s: Is like there is, there's, there's literally no way to know what causes it.
2868.32s: But what I can tell you is that the automotive industry is not in the greatest spot right now.
2874.32s: And the other thing I can tell you is Tesla did drop from 480 down to 220, right?
2883.32s: Like that doesn't just happen.
2886.32s: There's a reason why that happens.
2888.32s: And it's not just perception that will do that.
2891.32s: There are underlying factors that leads to some sort of concern.
2896.32s: So because of that, I wouldn't build stuff like that up in your head in that way, especially if you're a trader,
2904.32s: I would not say stuff like in order for something to go back to blank something big would have to happen.
2912.32s: And it's just because it's, it like skews the way that you then further analyze the name.
2919.32s: What I do in those instances is I would say something like this.
2929.32s: Or not.
2931.32s: What is going on here?
2935.32s: Oh, that's why I'm in the wrong spot like an idiot.
2939.32s: I look at the probability of a touch.
2942.32s: What's the probability of us touching 270 in the next 30 days?
2949.32s: The probability of a touch for 270 is 23%.
2953.32s: That's what's priced in the market right now.
2956.32s: So this is what I care about.
2958.32s: I care that based on current options pricing, there's about a 23% chance of it trading there for again,
2966.32s: and what choose your choose your adventure, whatever reason it feels like.
2970.32s: But that's how I prefer to analyze stuff.
2979.32s: So with that.
2983.32s: Yeah, I'm I'm indifferent on Tesla.
2987.32s: I think if it's just like AMD, like with these kinds of names, if you like it really long term, that's cool.
2994.32s: Otherwise, I want to see how it performs in this range.
2999.32s: And then make a decision from there again to give you like context, I just gave you a recent trade that I made in you and age, right?
3007.32s: You can see the difference is that there is a very clear direction going on here.
3014.32s: You can see it priced into the options markets.
3016.32s: You can see it literally just in the standard price performance.
3020.32s: So for me, I care about something that's easier to trade.
3026.32s: One of the things I find traders do pretty often, and I think it's a mistake is if you get too wrapped up with an individual name that you like for some reason.
3035.32s: And then you'd like try to find ways to force fit something in that name because you like it because you follow it.
3043.32s: And I really do tend to find that as a pretty big mistake.
3046.32s: Like if somebody were to say like Eric, well, how would you find a trade right now?
3051.32s: I would literally follow the scanning process that I've shared with you guys a million times, right?
3057.32s: I would start with building context on the broad economy and stock market.
3063.32s: We have that.
3064.32s: Then I would look at the portfolio and I would say what is the portfolio need?
3067.32s: Do I need long beta weighted delta short beta weighted delta does it not matter?
3071.32s: Do I need long premium short premium does it not matter?
3074.32s: And if there's no inputs from any of those, then it's just looking for opportunities.
3079.32s: And if I'm looking for opportunities, it's literally looking for stuff like this.
3083.32s: That's just a way better return on the risk from a probabilistic lens.
3092.32s: Then trading trying to trade something that's mid range mid range things can be really, really challenging.
3098.32s: But again, that's because I don't really have a longer term preference, right?
3106.32s: I will trade whatever it is as it presents itself.
3111.32s: So yeah, I think something like Tesla doesn't look terrible, but like I said in the beginning,
3120.32s: I would much prefer to trade this from a vol perspective than pretty much anything else.
3125.32s: And you can see if you traded it from a vol perspective recently here, I mean, you would have got smashed again,
3132.32s: depending on what term you're playing, but still like something like Tesla in the near term still can have like really rough.
3141.32s: Vol periods in terms of realized versus expected.
3146.32s: Let's take a look at vol.
3155.32s: Yeah, I mean, you can see it reflected pretty cleanly here.
3172.32s: And it's been running a negative risk reversal skew, which again, doesn't surprise me whatsoever because of how,
3179.32s: how volatile it's been recently.
3185.32s: So it's just been absolutely outperforming implied, which again, that's what happens when you trade stuff that's like this.
3198.32s: Silency persists at what point does UNH look like a good entry for a bounce?
3203.32s: Mine is 300, but we'll see again, I wouldn't bother.
3207.32s: That's not how I would trade UNH.
3210.32s: The way that I would look at UNH is it's in a defined downtrend until it starts to consolidate until it starts to rally,
3221.32s: it needs to consolidate, it needs to actually like display the behavior that you need to see.
3229.32s: So again, I don't look at these things and say like it's absolutely crashing.
3235.32s: When do I think that this thing is going to go up?
3237.32s: And it's because at some point it will likely go up, but while I'm sitting here trying to find that point in this,
3245.32s: there are things that are already going up heavily following a really great earnings release, and I much prefer to trade that.
3253.32s: Again, the question I would always tell you to think of before you place a trade is not, could there be a trade here?
3261.32s: The answer or the question always is, is this the right place for my money?
3266.32s: Like, is this the right trade?
3269.32s: I am always looking for easier opportunities more than anything.
3274.32s: I'm not looking to trade stuff that is wishy washy.
3278.32s: I much prefer again, stuff like this, like very, very clear defined trends that I can try to capitalize on or break out.
3286.32s: Again, I'll show you a really simple scan that I use pretty regularly.
3291.32s: If we go to screener, let's just look for an earnings move.
3296.32s: Let's say that we're looking for short deltas.
3299.32s: We'll tighten this up to like the last three days, so it's a little more relevant.
3304.32s: I'm going to move this off to the side that I can click through it faster.
3308.32s: And let's see.
3311.32s: So PFS PSFE.
3319.32s: So this, the way that I would look to trade this is if there is essentially a continuation below where it's at now.
3328.32s: And as a betting man, which is what I am, I do think that seems likely to occur.
3335.32s: I don't know for sure.
3338.32s: The market seem to like the call side of the equation, but again, if you take a look, most of it is short calls.
3345.32s: So from an OI perspective, you can be misled and you could say, well, there's 9,000 calls against 2000 puts, but what I can tell you from the recent activity today is that there's a lot of short calls going out.
3360.32s: So this is probably yet not super liquid.
3366.32s: I mean, it's fine. If you have a small account, you're only trading a few lots.
3370.32s: But this is like I would much prefer monitor this.
3375.32s: Well, let's see.
3379.32s: These are kind of tough with like these really just big parabolic drops.
3389.32s: This, I mean, it's super cheap, but really high ball.
3394.32s: The thing I would trade just short premium.
3400.32s: But these are more so the types of like downside, directional ideas.
3407.32s: That I would want to tinker with. And then for upside, there's tons that have had a really good earnings.
3412.32s: There's literally tons and tons and tons of names.
3415.32s: I got 213 returns in the scan for upside is compared to downside.
3420.32s: So the market is absolutely showing a little bit of upside strength here.
3424.32s: I think for sure.
3427.32s: Anything else you guys want to talk about?
3430.32s: I want to poke through maybe like a poster to from Reddit.
3434.32s: I like doing those towards the end of the stream just so that we can see what's happened.
3440.32s: And we'll take a look in options.
3443.32s: Let's see what's going on here.
3448.32s: And let's do.
3452.32s: And let's do.
3455.32s: Yeah, this is good.
3458.32s: All right.
3460.32s: Let's see what's happening in the world of Reddit.
3470.32s: Options trading strategy sharing.
3475.32s: Okay.
3482.32s: Let's take a look at this one.
3485.32s: This says thinking of getting into some long term 2027 at the money options.
3489.32s: I only have experience with six month out expertise.
3492.32s: I don't even know what that means.
3495.32s: What are your general recommendations for managing gains or losses?
3498.32s: I usually wait to lock in when Delta is closer to 08.
3504.32s: I'm going to have a 30 to 50% gain should I just be making the play with 12 months and then.
3509.32s: So this I like because they're asking the question.
3514.32s: But like this is a.
3517.32s: This is a really ignorant perspective to carry on trading options.
3524.32s: Because so like this, right?
3528.32s: And we're talking about.
3531.32s: If you're getting into longer dated options.
3534.32s: And the first question is you have to ask yourself why?
3538.32s: Why am I getting into this option?
3539.32s: Does this make sense?
3540.32s: To me, if you're going into these longer dated options, it's literally just because you want to hold something with leverage for a longer duration.
3548.32s: Like that's the point that you would go out to 2027.
3551.32s: That's okay if you are.
3553.32s: That should inform the way that you're managing gains or losses.
3557.32s: It shouldn't be based on Delta.
3559.32s: If like who cares if Delta moves Delta will move for different reasons.
3564.32s: I think what matters way more is what's your price expectation for the underlying and does it do that?
3571.32s: So and then it says should I be making the play within 12 months so like this again, it just is kind of.
3578.32s: Kind of random.
3581.32s: It looks like the cliff notes version for what I see here is like what I very regularly see, which is somebody that doesn't understand options.
3590.32s: And they're trying to piece together an approach, which is fine, but they don't understand options.
3597.32s: And if you understand options, you start to answer most of these questions for you because they're asking the wrong ones like worrying about what expiration if they're going to go to 2027 or 12 months or whatever.
3607.32s: And none of that really matters yet until you have the broader plan built, which is what do you expect the underlying to do and why are you using options in the first place based on that.
3618.32s: That's how I would build a management approach.
3621.32s: This is super common.
3623.32s: They're not doing anything that all of us haven't done before, but this is just kind of like cobbling it together as you're going, which typically doesn't work super great with options, especially this style.
3635.32s: So, yeah, interesting one to take a peek at last note, there won't be a stream this Saturday. I have some friends coming into town, but Friday will still do the foundational.
3654.32s: We still have one more episode to knock out for the outlier options trading foundation series, so we will do that.
3660.32s: I will be around as always, you can hit me up in the discord be an outlier. See you guys later.
