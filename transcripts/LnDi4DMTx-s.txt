798.00s: that or not?
800.00s: you
802.00s: should do that.
804.00s: and
806.00s: you should do that in the back of your mind
808.00s: So what we need to do is actually gain some context. So I'm gonna go further out.
813.88s: I'm gonna go over the last few weeks. What I want to do is see a sense of, man, look at the...
820.96s: These are big fucking trades, man.
825.28s: Hey, I'm...
827.28s: I mean, like, this is
830.24s: 250 returns of million plus
834.72s: trades. That's pretty incredible.
838.00s: Super active.
842.00s: Tons of these are short calls. This I expect to be the case as part of covered call campaigns.
852.88s: Because I know there are a lot of people right now that are sitting on heavy gains in
858.96s: volunteer that have gotten in when it was sub-20 that are just holding the stock and continuing
863.92s: to sell calls against it. Generating pretty decent money off of that. So that's what a lot of this
870.64s: will be.
875.84s: Yeah. Cool. All right, let's go through a couple other things super fast. I don't think this is
883.04s: the correct one. No, I think that was the correct one. Maybe is this one. One of these tells me
889.12s: something different. I don't know which one. No, that I know.
896.80s: This is just for the day. I don't care about this one. Right now. Okay.
906.00s: We go in here.
913.44s: Jesus Christ. Look at this.
919.92s: That is.
924.00s: This is profound.
927.20s: Like that's not being dramatic. That is profound.
933.44s: That is a ton of money and call premium that came through on Friday.
939.36s: The next closest was what? Here. At 53 mil.
950.08s: That's crazy.
956.00s: Net premium here was.
963.52s: 53.
966.08s: 20. 23 is the net here at 65 is the net.
973.76s: That's an insane. It's just an insane amount of activity.
978.32s: Let's see what people are positioning as.
987.44s: Huge build out in 19 Ds. That's actually really good to see, to be honest, because
996.88s: this kind of massive skew this further out in time, this represents positioning based on
1004.24s: longer term expectations.
1008.72s: But I mean, there's a lot of put activity as well.
1011.92s: Now again, we have to take a look at if the puts are actually bought or sold.
1015.28s: We don't know that just yet.
1016.48s: I mean, the put side of half to imagine is broadly being attached to long stock.
1023.44s: And we can figure that out in a couple different ways. We'll take a look at a sec.
1026.80s: Let's take a look at premium.
1034.24s: Yeah, so way more call premiums in general, like as I flip through this, we can see it,
1040.72s: this flips here in 19 Ds with big put premium.
1047.12s: That's really the only cycle.
1049.60s: It's very much dominated by bullish.
1054.96s: Bullish call premiums.
1064.56s: And the build out.
1073.60s: I mean, the build out is mostly overhead price.
1078.72s: Like these are kind of right at spa, but then you can see the 138s are heavy.
1083.36s: Even the 139s, which contracted, they're still heavy.
1088.56s: These aren't moving much. The 150s.
1094.40s: Yeah, I mean, it looks like, like as I poke through this, it absolutely seems in general,
1101.36s: like the market favors it to the upside.
1105.28s: Now, it doesn't look like necessarily a super short term, a super short term thing, though.
1113.76s: Meaning a lot of these positions are out pretty far in time.
1117.04s: So total, oh, I, I see two mill calls, two mill puts.
1131.44s: This was on the 30th.
1139.84s: Let's take a look at a couple other things. I want to see.
1150.80s: Ah, interesting.
1159.84s: Very interesting. So this seems like institutions have been offloading into the strength.
1169.52s: And let's see what insiders are doing. I imagine they would be offloading. Yeah.
1183.20s: In these kind of instances, you just have to expect this because if you see the stock
1188.40s: rallying like this, if you're an insider with a decent amount of your capital and your net
1195.04s: worth tied into a stock like this, like this is just strategic profit taking, I think,
1200.56s: because you have to remember a lot of these people, I don't know, the backgrounds,
1203.76s: but a lot of people, they'll look at insider transactions and say like, oh, the insiders
1208.16s: are selling the stocks going down. And for a lot of people, especially in smaller companies that
1212.16s: are starting to really hit their stride, a lot of them might have been toiling on this thing
1216.16s: for some time before starting to see like meaningful price appreciation on the shares that
1220.40s: they've been granted over the years. And it just gives them a chance to take some risk off the table.
1224.80s: Right? Like actually put some money in your pocket because like this person, Shane,
1229.76s: car, shy, I don't know anything about them. They're the CTO, but I mean, they just got like a two
1235.60s: mill, a two mill payday, but I don't know what their comp is over the duration that they've been
1240.96s: there. And I don't know how much they've made over the duration that they've been there. But this
1243.84s: makes sense to me. I would be absolutely expecting people to start taking some profit off the table.
1249.12s: People like Steve McCullough is a little bit different because we know we know that they're
1254.48s: sitting on cash. But yeah, super interesting. Let's take a look at a couple other things.
1266.00s: No, this isn't what I want. This is what I want.
1278.08s: So all I'm doing is getting a sense of what the near term price pressures might look like.
1295.84s: Which is fairly balanced actually. Definitely net long.
1305.52s: But with spot right now kind of in this zone.
1319.68s: Overhead is super light. It's all below spot right now.
1326.72s: Pistol shrimp. That's a fun name. What up? Pistol shrimp says,
1330.08s: hair, I can usually catch your videos after what caught your life for once. That's awesome.
1335.36s: I'm glad you're able to make it. We always enjoy poking through the markets a little bit and seeing
1340.32s: what's what's cracking. Chris says just got here to talk about GameStop yet. Nope, not yet.
1347.20s: That'll actually probably be next. So we're wrapping up the first stock, which is a volunteer.
1355.44s: Actually, and then we'll take a peek over at GameStop after this.
1367.20s: Here we go. This is stuff that I know probably doesn't mean that much for people. For me, I like
1373.92s: I like looking at the wall plots.
1393.36s: Nothing jumping out at me.
1394.64s: Let's take a look at one more thing. I just want to see any other recent news flow.
1414.56s: Here. Let's go to the platform itself.
1434.00s: This just helps me poke through really fast and see if there's any big news that looks interesting.
1439.60s: Volunteer stock gains as Trump expands companies rolling US government agencies.
1447.12s: This will continue to probably be the case for them as we were just talking about.
1452.96s: I mean, they got a good foot in the door. The one thing to keep in mind, though, specifically about
1459.44s: volunteer is that as price starts to skyrocket as much as it is, you do have to start questioning
1470.56s: valuations because valuations do matter longer term. And you need to see adequate supportive growth.
1476.56s: So like right now, the forward price to sales is 75.6 and it's at 265 times adjusted earnings.
1484.24s: That's kind of a lot. And it's 222 times forward earnings, which to me is more important.
1493.60s: So those kind of valuations are they really become highly prone for disappointment when things
1506.40s: are poised at those levels. So yeah, I think I think the main stuff that we're seeing here is the
1514.72s: company seems to be continuing to grow a big difference, though, is I would consider a lot of
1519.76s: its growth actually like solid fundamental revenue growth, which is good. That's good for the company.
1526.24s: Cool. Let us move on to the crowd favor. The heavy hitter, the golden child,
1535.36s: GameStop. And I also do want to crack open the DD library because last time we didn't,
1541.84s: I wanted to see if we can get through maybe one more from there and just kind of poke through those
1546.64s: as we go. So a couple of things we know that earnings has been solidified, right? So 10th of June,
1557.04s: done. And we also know that GameStop was on a hell of a tear. And again, the same thing I always
1566.24s: tell you guys and you were reiterating because it is always the case. Before we started seeing
1573.76s: levels up here at 35 down here from like the high 20s, what do you notice happens with volume?
1581.36s: Volume grows. And this isn't like some sort of again, this is not like, oh, Eric knows the secret.
1586.56s: That nobody like everybody fucking knows this. But the thing that's important is that as we spend
1592.96s: so much time talking about, you know, again, like the different cycle analysis, the different ideas
1599.60s: on FTDs and all of these other things. All of that stuff is completely fine to take a look at,
1608.00s: to tinker with, to explore, all that is completely fine. But from a trading lens, it is always the same
1616.88s: thing. Volume proceeds the move. It's never not done that. So I think it's super important to keep
1624.24s: that in mind when we analyze GameStop because from the trader lens, that's ultimately what matters.
1631.92s: So my position via the coverage triangle in here, I don't think has changed that much.
1637.92s: The only difference was is I was speculatively trading this move with just options, long option
1644.16s: separate from that. So those essentially are completely phased out now. But
1652.00s: it was in response to this day here, actually. So the total gain wasn't anything spectacular.
1659.04s: But it was still a moderate gain in a relatively short period of time. So we can talk about that
1665.44s: stuff later at another time. If you guys are interested, let's focus on the stock though.
1670.40s: So let's take a look. These days are almost rolled off. So you're going to see pretty soon
1678.88s: a big change in a bunch of the metrics because you can see we have implied volatility percentile
1685.60s: is showing us that 56% implied volatility rank is going to normalize soon.
1690.80s: Implied volatility rank got so messed up because of this. And it will stay skewed because of this
1699.36s: literally for an entire year. Whereas you can already tell implied volatility percentile does
1705.12s: a much better job compensating for outlier moves, just literally in the method that they're calculated.
1711.84s: This down move, we can say it's due to a bunch of stuff. But some of the main things that I do think
1724.80s: are worth highlighting were the moves based on the Bitcoin position. So this came out 28 May.
1738.24s: And if you take a look at this day, 28 May. So a big piece of what happened here is GameStop
1750.32s: made the announcement that it grabbed 47, 10 Bitcoin, which again, we don't actually know at what
1757.12s: price we can speculate what the current values worth based on spot price against that number. But
1762.72s: we don't know what their actual basis is. And that's why this says worth more than half a billion
1769.60s: dollars. Now the move here is really interesting. And I think there's a couple things that this
1781.52s: tells us about the positioning in the company based on the various parties. Random skate says by
1790.56s: the rumor, sell the news, it could be that kind of scenario. A big thing that this hints at though
1798.00s: is that there's a significant regime change underway right now for GameStop. And that regime
1804.48s: change is heavily dependent on what the company chooses to do going forward. Because now it has
1813.04s: two different flavors associated with it in a pretty big way. It has the brick and mortar game
1821.76s: stop, physical store thing with card grading and collectibles. And now it's starting to spread
1829.92s: a little further into the cryptocurrency holding side of things via Bitcoin. Now during we watch
1837.12s: the video from Cohen and Cohen was talking about how Bitcoin serves as a currency hedge, which
1846.40s: is interesting. I think that he's saying that more so because that's like a good talk track.
1854.72s: But I don't think anybody actually views the movement as that. I think the move is way more
1864.80s: associated with the thing that he slid on the end, which was the speculative nature and trying
1871.12s: to trade the appreciation of Bitcoin. Now the biggest question remains here, which is what is the
1881.60s: future and specifically for GameStop because the brick and mortar store is still struggling.
1890.64s: And it's starting to show that it's making some changes, which is great. But we still don't really
1898.40s: know what the ultimate direction is going to be. They didn't really use a ton of cash on this
1903.28s: Bitcoin position, which I'm actually very happy about. I wouldn't want to see a massive Bitcoin
1908.96s: position come on because we still don't have a sense of what the cash is doing. And we also know
1916.24s: that Bitcoin is super volatile. And if you go too heavy on Bitcoin and that's a big part of your
1922.80s: balance sheet that is compromising and people will say stuff like, oh, well, maybe Bitcoin will be the
1929.20s: next micro strategy. I absolutely hope not because micro strategy is effectively a Ponzi scheme.
1938.24s: And as soon as you stop getting new money to come in and Bitcoin goes down if it does go down
1944.72s: far enough, the music stops and the game becomes ugly over there. So that's like a very specific
1952.40s: strategy. I'm not saying it's stupid. I'm just saying that that's like a very specific strategy
1956.32s: that is very risk open. Whereas right now GameStop is in a different position. And the way I think
1964.56s: that it's trying to play cryptocurrency is likely in a completely different context than what you see
1969.76s: from micro strategy. Now I haven't gone through Superstonk to see what the vibe is. So we'll take
1978.32s: a quick look at that. If you guys know of any recent news or headlines that have come out any good
1988.00s: posts, let me know. I'd love to take a look at those with you. But let's see, let's see what the
1994.64s: deal is here. I just want to see from this last week. To the Bitcoin holders out there that are
2006.48s: curious as to why for the first time ever a company stock dip. Let me see Bitcoin holders are
2012.72s: getting their eyes open to the reality that when GameStop has good news that abusive short sellers
2017.60s: use it as an opportunity to push price down. I just don't agree with this. I don't agree with this.
2024.32s: You're unaware of how it's possible because ownership the entire stop market is decoupled from
2028.32s: buying and selling pressure enabled by was known as an indirect holding system. That's fine.
2033.12s: Investors don't buy ownership of public companies. They purchase what's known as security
2039.44s: entitlement. Many public companies are legally owned by a single entity. Wall Street picks.
2045.44s: The winners and losers. I don't agree with that. GameStop is holding the cash. They are holding
2051.28s: to set a floor for our share price. Welcome and enjoy the show. That's parts good.
2058.40s: A couple of things here that I just don't love about this post.
2063.12s: The first thing is that this doesn't make sense when a company has good news that short sellers
2072.88s: would use that as an opportunity to push price down. It doesn't make sense. It's kind of like
2080.48s: Sun Zoo and the art of war. The same thing we talk about in the Marine Corps when we're talking
2085.84s: about tactics. We talk about things like centers of gravity and critical vulnerabilities.
2092.32s: Center of gravity is where somebody's super strong and this could be a force. It could be a stock
2098.08s: whatever. Things have centers of gravity. That's where they're super strong. Critical
2102.00s: vulnerabilities is exactly what it sounds like. That's the weakness. So if you have something
2108.32s: that's reported the purchase of Bitcoin and that's perceived as good news, that's not a good time
2116.56s: to try to use what they're supposing as a strong positive catalyst as a time to short.
2124.24s: It literally doesn't make sense. It's attempting to attack a center of gravity, which would be the
2130.08s: most disadvantaged time to try to do that. It literally doesn't make sense.
2133.52s: Now, one of the things that I would also layer on top of this is that I actually don't know if
2145.60s: this is correct. That for the first time ever, a stock company dipped after announcing a Bitcoin
2151.76s: investment, I would have to look at that. And I mean, we could take a quick minute and look at it
2155.36s: because I don't know. And I question stuff like that because it does change the context. If this
2161.04s: actually is the case, I would feel a little curious about it. Although still the number of times
2168.08s: that this happens against this individual instance, the other fact of the matter is the stock coming
2173.52s: into this had made a rally of 25% in three days. Things that have those kind of parabolic moves
2184.48s: often show reprieve. They often will come down. And that's as the process of natural profit taking
2191.12s: occurs because there are people in stuff like this playing a lot of different time frames.
2196.64s: So let's take a quick look at that. I want to, I'm actually just genuinely curious about this
2201.68s: assertion that for the first time ever, a company stock dipped after announcing a Bitcoin purchase.
2207.60s: So what we're going to do is ask Groc create a list of stocks that have announced
2217.12s: purchasing of Bitcoin.
2222.56s: Include the date they announced the purchase. Let's see how many this comes up with.
2231.92s: And then I'm actually going to ask this also to something else. Maybe we'll do like Gemini.
2237.60s: I just like comparing the different answers. Let's see. So Groc has GameStop, MicroStrategy,
2246.40s: Trump Media, MetaPlanet,
2252.64s: Cooler technology. They don't know the date. We need to do like publicly traded companies.
2260.56s: Pick publicly traded companies from the US exchange. We want to be a look at price performance.
2273.12s: GameStop, MicroStrategy, Trump Media, Cooler, Tesla. We can take a look at those real quick.
2284.32s: GameStop. I'm looking now at Gemini to compare Tesla block.
2293.76s: Okay, so that's another one for us to take a look at. Let's just eyeball this super fast.
2297.60s: This is super small sample, so we don't have a lot to look at. Let's take a look at Tesla.
2303.36s: We don't hate Feb.
2314.08s: It's 2021. Yeah, we got to go back a ways, gang.
2323.44s: Oh, let's do 10 years.
2327.52s: And let's go in here.
2345.04s: This is 8 Feb. So Tesla is another instance where in 2021 they announced the purchase of 1.5 billion
2356.80s: of Bitcoin and it went down. Let's take a look at Square.
2364.72s: This is in 7 oct 2020.
2367.92s: Let's do what the fuck is the name of that charting website everybody uses. It's not popping up in here.
2382.64s: Creating view.
2386.72s: And we need to look at SQ.
2388.56s: We need to look at an old chart. So S log.
2411.76s: This is is it XYZ?
2414.24s: I want to see if that's.
2419.92s: Can we go back far enough?
2423.52s: 2020 it looks like we can.
2431.60s: So this says in October 7th of 2020.
2444.08s: I'm assuming more.
2450.80s: October 7th.
2453.68s: The down day.
2456.96s: It went up for a couple days after and then it rolled over super hard. So I would also call that down.
2462.40s: Down on the day and then if we use like a follow on five days. Also down.
2473.68s: Let's take a look at one more. So so far based on again and admittedly a very small sample size.
2482.40s: Like this assertion is just wrong where it says for the first time ever companies stock dipped after
2488.16s: announcing Bitcoin investment. And I'm not saying this to like shit on this person or poo poo on
2492.80s: the like I don't care. Like I'm they're doing their best. But the problem with stuff like this is
2499.20s: I find a lot of GameStop holders they've just created and not through their own faults.
2505.68s: But through looking at the broader context of things they've created this like everybody's against
2513.04s: us mindset. And I again feel however you want that's fine. But I think it is so important to do
2521.44s: our absolute best to remain objective with the information. Does it look like there's abusive
2529.12s: short sellers? Absu fucking lootly. I we've spent a lot of time looking at this stock. I think that
2537.44s: is apps of fucking lootly the case. But just because there are abusive short sellers. I do not
2544.40s: think that it means that Wall Street picks the winners and that now everything is
2551.44s: anti or against GameStop. I think that those two things can exist in parallel.
2557.52s: So let's just take a look at one more though. I again I'm like I'm genuinely curious because I've
2562.48s: not looked at this before like when companies announce Bitcoin. So right now we have three. So
2569.44s: GameStop, Tesla, Block, all three three for three have gone down after announcing not just on the
2578.72s: day but for the week following they've gone down. So like if you looked at price difference week
2585.36s: over week. Okay, there's an only KULR. This says May 25 but it doesn't give an exact date.
2598.64s: What's kind of useless? One did KULR announce its Bitcoin purchased.
2620.16s: It just says May of 25 but how can it not
2628.48s: be announced? Oh, when did KULR announce its Bitcoin purchase? I mean like there's gotta be a date on an article.
2644.24s: It announced its Bitcoin treasury which included plans to purchase Bitcoin on four December
2660.96s: and then it looks like the first completion went on December 26. I guess that's actually
2665.52s: really interesting. I had to use not GROC through X but I had to use GROC specifically like browser GROC
2681.44s: which is kind of interesting.
2685.44s: Okay.
2694.16s: So let's take a look.
2706.96s: 24 D's. Huge up day. 24 D's. So this is when it announced that it was going to do it.
2718.24s: So that's great. So we have a good data point. When did it lost my thing? When did KULR announce
2726.56s: it bought Bitcoin?
2734.24s: So I think it said 20... Yeah, oh, it's on four D's my bad. And then it bought it on 20-60s.
2740.00s: So big up day on when it bought it on the day so that's one out of four instances were on the day it
2748.24s: announced it went up big but then again that's still four out of four instances where the week after
2756.64s: it's down. So that's kind of like a mixed bag I would say.
2761.28s: Okay.
2767.28s: Pistolshram says I do feel like Superstong tends to buoy up random hype posts with no basis or
2772.16s: what you're saying everything is because it's game stop. The thing to be clear though is I agree
2780.08s: with you but I understand it. I do understand it. It's easy to fall into that. It's kind of like
2786.64s: if you've seen the rug pulled enough times you just assume it's going to be pulled.
2792.08s: So I do get it. I really do get it. It's not though I do my best to guard against those kinds of
2799.44s: things because it's so easy to fall into them but I understand how you arrive at them.
2803.92s: The problem with it is that it causes people to then not be able to objectively analyze stuff
2812.64s: which just hurts them. Your ability to objectively analyze stuff is always a good thing
2819.36s: and that doesn't mean you throw away what you know you can still maintain the background of
2826.64s: your experience because that's useful that's really useful information to include in a decision
2832.72s: cycle but it's really important to be able to to cordon pieces of this off where you say to yourself
2841.12s: like yeah I know that I have this bias. It exists for a reason. Bias isn't inherently bad. A
2847.04s: contrary to what people today say about like judging people have made judging out to be like this
2852.88s: terrible. It's not fucking bad. It's a good thing to do. Now it's not good to judge something
2859.12s: and then not be able to decouple your judgment from an objective evaluation. That's the dangerous part
2866.56s: but I understand how people get there. For sure.
2877.12s: So this is one out of four instances that we see Bitcoin actually this stock go up
2885.76s: on the Bitcoin purchase announcement and then we see it seems like four out of four instances
2894.24s: were following that up then it doesn't sustain the up move for the following week. That's what it
2904.80s: looks like to me. All right let's put let me get caught up on the chat real quick.
2913.52s: Jesse says you give good info. I appreciate it. Thank you so much.
2926.00s: random says DD is what GMU is based off of some have lost their way for sure. Well that's why
2931.60s: we've spent so much time going through the DD library is because the DD library has taught me a lot
2937.68s: not just about the way that people think about GameStop but the style of analysis that's completed
2942.40s: and it's a really good attempt at general analysis. The problem I find and I even talked to Newton
2949.76s: about this when he and I when he was like getting me crash course caught up on the story of Bitcoin
2956.32s: or I'm sorry on the story of GameStop where I absolutely notice that a lot of people that are
2964.40s: conducting the analysis on GameStop what they're doing is they're unfortunately not applying good
2973.20s: analysis techniques. What this looks like is if I'm trying to analyze something I might have a
2979.04s: hypothesis but when I'm going through the analysis my goal is not to try and justify my hypothesis.
2988.64s: My goal is to conduct an analysis around the hypothesis to assess whether or not I reject it
2998.24s: and unfortunately I find a lot of the DD that's done here is it's starting from the point of
3006.00s: I am trying to prove this thing that I think about this thing and that's almost always going to
3012.72s: leave to skewed results. It's a great example of this is like if I tell you wherever you're sitting
3019.76s: right now look around you and look for every instance of black that you can see and count it count
3027.76s: the number of times you see black as I get this hair out of my mouth there it is.
3035.20s: And then if I ask you well how many instances of red did you see probably have no idea
3045.44s: because you were looking for black red didn't even enter the equation whereas if I had prompted you
3052.40s: instead of look for black and instead I say look at the different colors how many different colors
3058.80s: do you see around you then all of a sudden you have a different answer so that's the problem
3063.84s: with that kind of like analysis is that if you go into something looking to justify what you're
3068.88s: trying to justify you're probably going to find stuff that supports it or skew things that you
3073.52s: see to support it which again it's just a broken it's a broken way to apply good analysis because
3080.56s: there's a lot of good analysis that I've come across in the community so far which like I said I
3086.08s: want to pop up in the dd library again so that we can check out another piece.
3095.68s: Iceman says also how does the logic in that post explain why it would only apply to GameStop?
3103.36s: I don't think it does and I think that's actually kind of the point I think what the post oh the
3108.64s: logic in the post I see that well we talked about this before the logic in the post like in this
3115.68s: it's really not great logic because they wouldn't use it as an opportunity to push price down but
3121.12s: the idea the theory that their post well I guess the hypothesis that they're posing is that
3128.80s: when there's a good piece of news then the short sellers use that as an opportunity to try and
3134.08s: suppress price or to even push it lower that's the hypothesis again the the problem with that is
3141.84s: that if you want to try to draw it.
3149.36s: We really know what context I want to use here water is what my brain is going to so we'll find a
3155.92s: way to use water so let's say that there are two pipes you have a pipe here
3165.44s: and you have a pipe here these look like j's but they're not their pipes
3168.80s: and let's say that your job is to do like a horizontal Mario meaning you know how like in the
3178.64s: video games Mario goes down well and these ones you have to go in you just have to go this way
3184.08s: in the pipes like this if there's a pipe where the inside of this pipe has a bunch of water
3196.08s: going this way coming out versus this pipe which has a little bit of water
3205.36s: that's going out which one of these pipes is easier for you to walk through the answer is super
3212.24s: obvious you don't go in the I'm just kidding the answer is super obvious it's this pipe
3217.20s: well this theory on using good news as an opportunity to push price down is akin to trying to go
3227.68s: through this pipe because in order for short sellers in the market if you have a stock price
3236.00s: in order for short sellers to push price down they need to overwhelm the buying pressure
3243.84s: if they do not overwhelm the buying pressure then they're going to get ran over and this is what
3250.24s: leads to short squeezes when shorts attempt to push price down but then buyers step in big time
3257.28s: because they see an opportunity and then you also have the added catalyst of knowing that there
3262.32s: shorts on the other side of this that are going to have to close if they get ran over too big to
3267.36s: the upside so then they end up having a buy to close which fuels the move this is when you get into
3273.92s: short squeezes gamma squeezes stuff like that so that's why the theory in this is not really
3284.16s: sound because it's essentially pitting your movement against a center of gravity versus a critical
3294.00s: vulnerability if you wanted to conduct this maneuver you would be so much better off trying to
3300.16s: push price down when things are quiet there's not a lot of buyers you're you're asserting against a
3306.80s: critical vulnerability versus a center of gravity so that it's I understand what they're trying to
3311.76s: get at I just don't think it's correct so anyways that that was their attempt at explaining it
3317.92s: again like props to them they're seeing something and they're trying to explain it so I give
3324.24s: I always give credit for stuff like that the the dangerous thing here is that I think when people
3330.24s: see this kind of stuff that aren't necessarily doing the analysis themselves and they'll say like
3335.76s: oh yeah wow this is crazy it's only game stop that has this done and then this starts to paint
3340.88s: this broader picture in their brain of this like backdrop that doesn't necessarily reflect reality
3346.16s: and again that just leads to a very skewed analysis which is always just gonna hurt you the more
3353.84s: objective you can be in your analysis the better off you're going to be it's just a useful skill to
3358.08s: have anyways let's continue marks Cuban mark Cubans AMA age like fine wine their goal was is never
3369.52s: to never cover their short but that would be to take the company going out of business or
3374.08s: being the less is completely correct that won't happen here is correct best thing you can do is
3378.48s: hold on to the stock and do business with game stop if everyone goes through website and buys for
3383.20s: them that is going to help the company which will help the stock and help everyone here is correct
3387.68s: if you have if you still believe the reason you bought the stock and that hasn't changed
3392.56s: by cell it's literally that's completely correct across the board and it's because everybody knows
3398.56s: the benefit well there's a million benefits for the short seller side of the equation
3408.24s: if the company goes out of business there's a ton of benefits so that's absolutely what they would
3413.84s: want I can open my window
3428.32s: they reap all of those different tax benefits so this is correct and by holding on to the stock
3441.04s: that effectively will stifle the total amount of downside pressure that can be exerted so yeah
3446.40s: that's that's absolutely correct this we looked at already which was the fact that people were
3453.36s: seeing that the cat was active on Reddit
3462.80s: all this momentum good news about game stop is going to piss off the hedges they will execute
3466.80s: an immediate ladder attack to try to get the paper hints the fold see and again like this is
3471.44s: one of the problems right because somebody saying this other people will look at and be like oh wow
3476.40s: that's exactly what happened and then we have a pretty a pretty broken analysis cycle so
3491.04s: yeah
3494.48s: let's see anything else
3498.48s: big share trading we know cool all right so let's take a quick look at a couple
3506.08s: other things and then we'll jump into the dd library we'll start with just like an overview
3512.64s: of game stop and see what's cracking this is good by the way the fact that game stop started seeing
3521.60s: the put premium plummet this hard that typically means that like the move the move had been made
3529.52s: and people that were trying to play via the long put side of the equation which you can see coming
3535.68s: in here are coming out of their trades which is actually good because again that means that the
3542.24s: the anticipated move had occurred which would lead me to believe that the overall downside pressure
3548.72s: might be abating that's what I see there let's take a look at the chain first here
3566.24s: so it looks like net build
3576.64s: yeah it looks like net build and I mean the oh I is still super long call heavy right like look
3584.88s: across all the strikes now the chart below which is not super shocking is a lot of this is pretty
3595.36s: near term so 30 may obviously which is past six June this number will go up as people move from here
3603.04s: to here and then from here to here 20 June the next primary expiration is super dense in terms of
3609.68s: oh I more so actually than typical and 369,000 calls against 64 put so it's actually very heavy
3619.92s: on the call side and the other slightly anomalous thing here is the fact that
3625.36s: typically it's the front expiration that's super hot and then the primary expiration normally has
3631.36s: something going on but not as heavy as the front expiration so this is actually distinct
3638.48s: and let's take a look at premiums
3645.44s: heavy call side until here wow that's a that's that big block though that we've seen a lot of those
3660.88s: are those in the monies which are still likely synthetic longs I think let's take a look at
3675.20s: what kind of flow we've seen over the last couple weeks clear those out
3680.96s: then I'm gonna get rid of the mids as well so that we can just see decisive pretty light premiums
3689.20s: though but it looks like
3702.32s: 21
3706.88s: this is kind of interesting
3708.08s: because these happen first I can't tell if some of these were sold
3718.56s: like some of these were sold or if this is oh not it's a different expiration that's just a
3723.12s: complete different position
3729.12s: pretty light from a premium perspective
3734.72s: oh GM duh I was like what the fuck thank you shout out the pistol shrimp there we go
3744.00s: this makes way more sense I was like what the fuck like this is like insanely light
3752.32s: yeah this is this is better
3755.76s: so most of the large build ah take a look at these I like these the reason why I like these is
3765.84s: because this shows a much longer term view
3774.56s: and this is interesting because it looks like some of this take a look this is some of the
3778.64s: unwind this is cool so what you see here is a pretty big build out on the 20th of May
3786.96s: right so this is 1.9 mill in premium total but then you can take a look at the cell side here
3794.64s: and the cell side actually has a decent amount of premium it's we would have to actually take a
3802.64s: look at the the flow itself to see what happened but this actually had a decent amount of cell
3811.92s: side so that's people that are clearing out some of the gains from the purchase like three days
3820.00s: prior which is actually super cool you can kind of clearly cleanly attach those
3826.00s: so a lot of these bigger trades are further out in time right so you see 26 here
3839.44s: you see 27 here these are the primary explorations out in 20 June here so they're they're not
3847.68s: necessarily playing the front super hard most of this is a little further out which again I always
3854.88s: argue that's healthier for the stock in general all right let's take a quick look at the dd library
3863.44s: here I have no idea where we left off but that's a lie I have an idea I just don't
3872.24s: feel like we've looked at this I think I remember the Oberos I actually have that this is what's
3880.96s: tattooed on my arm is a different version of the Oberos
3888.88s: yeah we definitely did this one I thought I remember doing this one but I don't remember doing these
3898.00s: let's take a look what do I remember
3900.80s: paper inflation
3909.52s: look at the Venetian banks that's cool
3913.76s: shit this just looks kind of interesting this is look at this one
3918.16s: feel like I remember it but I'm down to I'm done to look again
3923.52s: so this is just talking about different monetary policy what's the oh I forgot this is
3937.28s: talking about the idea of hyperinflation which is kind of funny because it's almost the opposite
3942.00s: of what's happening right now
3953.20s: I just want to see like what their broad idea was
3967.36s: the debt crisis will return but this time financial system government the entire economy needs a
3973.12s: bailout central banks are going to do it the idea that anyone can borrow forever
3983.12s: that's a tough one possible objects cannot exist forever history shows deadly consequences
3990.08s: for the nations that venture down either path the United States this is no exception I agree with
3994.16s: this so like excessive and this is actually why right now with the current administration again
4000.56s: regardless of what you think of the administration writ large but it's why you see debt as such a high
4008.32s: high ticket discussion item so I I agree with the concepts here but I think what goes into
4017.76s: what goes into hyperinflation is a little more specific than a lot
4025.12s: from there because there's a lot of tools that can be employed to manage stuff so
4034.24s: oh I remember this one this one is for oh are these from PB is this one from PB as well
4042.80s: oh okay this makes more sense
4048.56s: look I haven't talked to him in a while how is he
4052.08s: he and I we were doing podcasts to a little for a little while I have to hit him up
4058.32s: hey yo what up dog I haven't hit him up in a while let's see what he says here
4078.08s: when were these done 2021 so the thing with I mean we haven't seen it right
4087.92s: okay
4098.16s: okay we know this we know this so just the former attachment of the dollar to the gold standard
4110.64s: okay
4117.52s: okay
4120.56s: for those that don't know by the way you can go to Fred and you can create your own dashboards
4125.84s: for stuff like this is actually very very cool um I use it semi regularly because it's a great
4132.48s: way to get a general pulse of how the economy and how the market is doing I'll show you
4148.16s: here so it's completely free Fred is free but you can literally build your own dashboards to take a
4157.20s: look at different things you can overlay different metrics on top of one another that you're
4164.08s: interested in so money supply debt like all this kind of stuff which is kind of cool like I said I
4170.08s: I think it's super useful especially like the personal finance stuff I used to be able to keep these
4175.92s: all five together but you'll actually notice how these have become like almost not readable
4181.12s: which is hilarious the reason for that is because of the skew caused by these so I literally
4186.80s: actually have to break these out at some point I'll actually keep it up so I did after the stream
4191.04s: but yeah pretty pretty nuts so anyways back to this
4199.60s: okay
4203.84s: I'm getting
4214.00s: so a lot of this is talking about the relationship of a central baking entity and the motivations for
4223.04s: different currency changes and then the subsequent impacts to other market components based on
4232.16s: those supply and demand changes
4243.52s: all right let's see if the US loses world reserve currency status two things happen foreign
4252.24s: central banks start dumping their huge treasury dollar debt positions I think that that's correct
4259.12s: I definitely think that's correct the I think the premise that would go into that happening those
4265.68s: very very specific and also difficult difficult to get at in my opinion
4274.40s: swift number of banks
4279.04s: who hold dollar for cross-boughter payments decide to dump yep
4284.96s: then rambling massive the problem is is like there's no other viable alternative right now still
4291.28s: for the world reserve reserve currency status and it's why so much of this is still done in dollars
4300.40s: so I think one of the gaps in this is the assumption that like there's a really suitable alternative
4310.24s: and I think it also underestimates how central the US is to the global business cycle still
4322.72s: both from a consumption and supplying perspective but interesting piece
4328.80s: cool let's do one more this one why sideways oh shit this is a large one
4340.32s: okay why are we trading sideways borrow rates so low moon theory of everything
4351.52s: see these are the kind of fun parts of the dd library to be honest when people start like
4357.12s: attaching a lot of these other theories right like in pb's piece he's showing he's teaching history
4366.16s: about other reserve banks currency uses money supply this dude here is talking about
4376.40s: the range points which is really fascinating by the way so it's like I love that you get to learn
4383.92s: and talk about a bunch of other things in addition to the underlying itself but let's see
4389.44s: price stabilization
4395.20s: why is the bar rate so low why is the SEC sitting by why is there no volume
4402.80s: why have an institution spot like mad well why why would they especially at the point of this
4409.44s: in 2021 the company was in a really dangerous spot man
4419.28s: so I actually don't I don't see what the theory is on why institutions would be like super
4427.76s: interested to gain long exposure at this point like really really speculative and I'm sure you know
4433.92s: some did but that's a tough argument to make I think
4437.68s: one okay when moon here we go put into effect so this is talking about
4455.52s: ah back to cycle theories
4459.92s: won't sit at Dell and Jimmy shorts keep kicking the can they won't be able to because they're
4464.08s: not stabilized in the price they're talking about I don't understand this price stabilization thing
4471.92s: once the DCOCC members are protected volume explodes bar rates go up margin calls will trigger
4476.64s: the squeezes on okay
4484.32s: everyone knows the game stop shorts are going to default it's what's really interesting is
4489.28s: looking at how this has progressed from 2021 to 2025 on a lot of these
4496.64s: this is super interesting so buy and hold okay
4506.88s: do you believe in 10,000 1,000 a share not of the realm of possibility but we move that
4512.48s: medical outlier I agree with this yep I think this is this is a really great way to phrase it by
4517.76s: the way there's a non-zero chance which I think is correct but it's very very small yeah it's
4522.88s: completely fair
4527.04s: you
4544.72s: I just want to see the conclusion
4548.08s: hold okay getting close to another really big price move may not be the squeeze
4560.72s: so this is kind of like the same just kind of projecting future price performance
4571.04s: built on system common law every party positioning
4578.16s: so interesting one of the interesting things is the broader assumption on the the short behavior
4588.88s: I actually think from a game theory lens I think the apes unfortunately
4598.00s: I think the apes unfortunately vastly underestimate the other side and I think that's one of the
4606.08s: reasons why a lot of this stuff doesn't play out as expected because the other side of this
4614.32s: from like the short lens whether we think they're still there whether they closed up shop and
4618.64s: left like whatever that is I think they're smart they're really smart so we in these dds often I think
4631.36s: too to conservatively discount the other side and like what their motivations are and what
4640.40s: they might be doing hot nitrogen says have you tried copying pacing these asking Gbt to summarize
4646.16s: the longer ones definitely the other thing that we used to do is piece them out and the other
4652.32s: thing that I do is I've actually I have most of the like the the big dd for example that one I put
4660.24s: into google drive where I have jemeni and I've used that to summarize it so definitely I just kind
4666.88s: of flip through them because at this point most of the stuff in here is kind of like different versions
4672.40s: of stuff we've tend to have seen at some point not you know perfectly but in some context typically
4681.12s: and then from the conclusion I can see if there's something that like jumps out at me but I'm
4685.44s: normally just kind of skimming through them because I like to look at them and see if anything
4689.36s: catches my eyes so interesting okay so that leaves us off then at the sideways piece the other
4697.92s: stock that I promised to look at today was unity so I'm gonna do that now quickly let's take a look
4706.32s: at you let's think look at you that's kind of funny so what's crack in here
4718.96s: really big see this is interesting this kind of massive call premium buying
4728.00s: and then you can see oh that's so interesting because it's kind of like layered but this is
4735.44s: really really short term turnaround and then still really really big call premium on the 30th so
4743.44s: these days have gotten very wide compared to prior days so whenever you see these kinds of big changes
4751.04s: whether it's up down in terms of premium it doesn't matter the fact that there's this big of a
4755.60s: dispersion is interesting always because something's going on that's the only time that you see
4761.92s: premium start to get that far out of whack so we can take a look at the chain quickly and see
4770.80s: so it's mostly long calls well not necessarily long calls I can't say that it's mostly calls
4777.68s: assumption to be long calls but mostly calls and mostly calls that are what is unity trading at right now
4791.36s: or not we don't get to take a look at that I suppose
4799.20s: I said being so annoying 26 so these are out of the money so I would have to believe most of
4805.60s: these are long calls we'll be able to tell them a little bit and a lot of it is this is a pretty
4815.28s: big pocket for this upcoming expiration which tends to mean that somebody is expecting something
4823.52s: especially if we can see when those were built up which we'll find out in a moment
4836.56s: overwhelming call premium relative in general
4853.60s: and it really did spike in here and you can see
4856.56s: this is the largest spike I think that we've seen
4864.48s: which does look somewhat telling because a lot of that happened to be in that near term expiration
4876.08s: um I want to see none of this
4886.64s: not this either
4891.76s: I think it might be this
4896.64s: oh finally this is what
4905.04s: you know
4915.60s: literally just want to see
4919.28s: oh this is the total this is it the total flow from Friday
4923.92s: I mean that's a profound build out 23 mil
4938.72s: but that's much longer term
4943.36s: and then the 20th still has a significant build out
4947.28s: so what this tells me is that it does look like somebody's expecting something here we can take a
4953.68s: look at the options flow itself to see how that came in specifically for the for the 20th expiration
4963.12s: get rid of this and we got to get rid of
4969.84s: what else is
4974.96s: is it keep dealing that
4981.20s: and let's get rid of them mad I need to like this
4984.80s: and then let's take a look at this over the last two weeks what I want to know is if
5001.76s: those calls were being built out consecutively and this is for the call side
5010.00s: 30th
5014.72s: so this is like super heavy on the 30th
5019.52s: here we go yeah so like this is the stuff that I want to see take a look at this
5025.60s: so the 30s out in 2026 got pinged three times for several million dollars on the 28th
5036.32s: and then they got pinged again on the 30th that's an informed position going on that's being scaled
5043.68s: into without a doubt
5048.56s: without a doubt so that kind of stuff is super super informative and what I just did is I actually
5057.04s: added the puts back into the equation just for me to eyeball what kind of put premium
5066.16s: was ran and it's just not much
5081.52s: I mean it doesn't even register on this scale let me get rid of the calls for a second
5087.28s: yeah all the put stuff is super small
5090.72s: 80k is the biggest
5092.32s: so that's like a really significant skew I would say to the call side but a lot of it's
5104.64s: further out in time so that can be really interesting for like a ratio called diagonal or
5110.88s: something like that I don't know why the platform is not working it's actually kind of annoying
5116.32s: but if we take a look at the actual options chain and for those that are still hanging out
5121.60s: if there's anything that you want to take a look at or if there's any questions that you have
5124.80s: now is the perfect time because I'm going to wrap up in a little bit but before that I do want to
5131.36s: take a look at this expiration cycle I just want to see what these guys are trading
5142.08s: and there's my delta one delta so one of the things to pay attention to here is notice how
5154.88s: the 31 strike is at a 51 delta whereas typically 50 delta is the at the money and
5163.20s: what you're seeing here is a pretty strong bullish skew in volatility that's why the 50 delta which
5174.48s: is typically at the money is so far up here so that tends to be again upside expectation
5185.04s: and it's already being priced in I mean these are still like super cheap
5193.12s: so this could be easily something like a ratio called diagonal let's take a quick look at the
5200.40s: actual chart we need to default this good day
5222.16s: I think this is funny
5231.12s: I'm trying to get it to stop default into all these other fucking time frame
5244.72s: I mean the chart doesn't look great
5250.88s: I don't like I don't really like
5261.28s: like it pretty much needs to get above this near term
5269.12s: this near term overhead and it's like super sideways
5274.40s: but the options market is pretty fucking smart man so the fact that it's seeing that kind of
5280.24s: volume the way I would play stuff like this would be really really conservatively super light
5285.12s: but I would speculate in it because when you see that kind of large volume and premium sizing
5292.40s: in the options chain a lot of times that it's informed trading I had a couple trades like that
5296.48s: the last week that I was talking about in the in the discord and it's one of those things were like
5305.44s: I can put my biases aside and say well like typically I don't like this chart for this that
5312.56s: the other reason I mean it's starting to look healthier but I still absolutely would not call
5316.96s: this healthy so seeing it move this way is part of the equation but the fact that there's that
5325.44s: significant of options premium flowing in I think is important at least give it some credit
5342.56s: I mean it looks super weak right like super super sideways
5347.28s: Scott says how to time covered call sales into gme volume
5352.40s: I wouldn't actually try to time covered call sales in game stop based on the volume like I actually
5360.80s: wouldn't really do that the way that I would think about it is in it I do this with the
5366.72s: covered strangle that I'm trading right now I don't have shares of game stop I'm all in the short
5371.28s: puts because of the ball but the first threshold is I would want to target something above my short
5378.24s: strike or I'm sorry my basis so that the short strike is above my basis and with how range bound
5387.44s: and choppy game stop has been literally I mean we could take a look at the the time frame we're
5392.40s: looking at here is what going back to January right so essentially a six month chart and it's just
5399.76s: been oscillating sideways like this so anytime that I would get stuck with the short calls would be
5406.24s: stuff that I would adjust by rolling and keeping the the equity exposure if I wanted whereas right
5414.56s: now I don't want to hold the equity outright I'm preferring to trade the option side of it because
5422.24s: the volatility in it continues to remain so high do they have like IV
5430.88s: because that would be cool to show you guys doesn't look like it do they have realized ball
5437.84s: if historical ball
5450.80s: yeah there we go
5457.20s: these need to be scooshed though
5461.60s: so because of that like you can actually see we're even going through a transitory phase
5466.96s: with respect to ball like ball had been clustering pretty low in here but then you can see it
5472.00s: starting to jack up all the way back here again you can start to see these moves before like the
5477.20s: massive moves start to to happen so during these kinds of periods where it looks like ball is
5483.12s: starting to build is when I wouldn't look to sell necessarily I would be more interested in trying
5489.84s: to sell as this starts to normalize which can be easier said than done but I wouldn't necessarily
5496.00s: want to get you know the short short ball out when it's going through a transitory phase where
5503.36s: it looks like ball is climbing that that's typically a bad time to do it
5509.04s: next says would you mind giving your analysis on AMC I feel like it's about to make a pretty solid
5513.12s: move next few weeks just like game stop yeah let's take a quick look at AMC
5517.68s: so kind of the same story training sideways definitely saw pop on the 27th this is like a
5529.28s: sympathetic move with game stop let's take a look at the options
5537.36s: so mostly call side huge expectation here on 20 June huge expectation on 20 June
5551.76s: we'll size that out in terms of actual money and let's take a look at the build out
5557.60s: still generally positive build out although some of it's smaller which is going to be expected in
5568.56s: terms of total li let's take a look at li first
5576.96s: yeah okay and now let's take a look at premium let's go to the 20th 374 and 76 so heavy but not like
5598.16s: crazy now let's take a look at any of that build out in that cycle itself though
5611.36s: and this will look over the last two weeks I'm going to focus on the call side first
5620.16s: and let's focus on that actual cycle
5622.88s: I want to see if there's anything that's getting hit a few times these this is kind of like the
5632.96s: best bet the threes but still not really that big that big of a position
5643.44s: so it looks like the options market is pricing upside but again it's like I wish I could see the
5653.44s: volatility surface in here I don't know why this thing is so
5660.96s: but I can't look at anything in there I want to look at the vault surface
5664.16s: we can kill 60 day vault for now
5694.96s: and let's do 20 June
5709.28s: so slightly elevated on the put side
5712.00s: yeah slightly elevated on the put side
5728.80s: which no I'm sorry on the call side not on the put side I was going to say that that would be
5734.64s: the inverse of what I would expect those threes are slightly edge call side and then we see
5743.92s: moderate call side out to like the 15s and then it widens out a little bit
5752.00s: and definitely higher severity to the upside so I mean it looks like AMC
5759.44s: also has a bit of bullish till going on from the options market across the board
5766.72s: I would offer
5774.64s: but the sizing isn't as stark
5779.92s: right the fact that this is across so many different
5783.36s: explorations at these levels versus being concentrated in a single expiration with these
5787.52s: premiums it leaves me to believe it's just a general bias it's not necessarily like the 20th
5794.64s: op-ax clearly will have the most but
5800.80s: the fact that it's so evenly distributed
5804.72s: is interesting because it's just like a persistent an expectation that's why I would look at it
5819.36s: a shrinkage is I have 20 bull putt spreads that expires six six the 3028s I don't think there's
5828.80s: anything wrong with it I don't I don't really like those specifically like verticals if I can
5835.52s: avoid it but and in what
5845.76s: because that's obviously not in I assume you mean GameStop maybe so assume you don't mean AMC
5851.44s: same sees way cheaper than that maybe GameStop for shrinkage that would be my guess
5863.76s: yeah GameStop okay and you're out in six six
5871.12s: I think it's fine
5872.88s: I think the 30s like really aggressive on the putt deltas
5887.12s: and the good part is this is one of those rare instances where vol on the putt side is
5897.28s: actually relatively cheap until you get super far out more often than not when you would sell
5904.56s: the 30s you would get a slightly lower vol and then when you would buy the 28s you would be
5910.00s: buying higher vol on that which you wouldn't want but in this case it's the inverse so like you're
5914.80s: getting good vol I don't know what the prices were that you got filled at for two dollars wide
5924.00s: let me take a look
5929.20s: so if you let me know what you got filled at I'll be able to give you a couple other data points
5933.84s: I'm just running this through one of my calculators really fast
5939.04s: what's the underlying IV
5941.68s: let's just do it for the cycle fix
5962.24s: I just want to check out for the actual expiration cycle
5965.28s: so for the six
5972.24s: this here 63.7 63 points
5981.52s: so days to expiration those are
5988.40s: super soon six days
5997.20s: and you're at the 30 and 28s
6006.32s: let me see what did you put in your premium you didn't that's okay I can tell you what the
6011.04s: neutral premium needed to be what's the probability on those go back to the chain this is faster
6018.64s: for me to do one thicker swim but you can do it you're okay on the 30s
6025.12s: does this calculate probability not that's kind of it
6030.40s: yeah it's frustrating I can use deltas and approximation I just prefer not to I prefer to use
6037.20s: ND2 51 it's like 49
6055.44s: so you needed to collect
6068.00s: yeah you wanted we need to get rid of this
6079.68s: the two points
6087.20s: 12 over
6097.20s: yeah so especially with the volume you needed to get a little bit over midpoint on those
6119.52s: so in I doubt you would have gotten that what's the last 119 but yeah definitely not
6127.52s: you'd be slightly under a midpoint so you have to be directionally correct that's essentially
6132.88s: like you didn't get any sort of favor done with the spread but if it goes up obviously you'd be okay
6138.48s: but this overall wouldn't be my wouldn't be my way to go about it good for bringing it up though
6144.88s: hopefully it works out for you you got my vote all right gang wraps me up be an outlier jell-ed
