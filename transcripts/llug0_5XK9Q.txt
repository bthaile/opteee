0.00s: What's up, Outliers? Welcome back to another episode of the Outlier podcast. We have Richard
7.00s: back to talk to us about really just all the things that are psychologically wrong with
11.92s: me. It's always fun because I walk away understanding that I have a lot of problems, but it's great
16.48s: to see you again.
17.48s: It's so good to be here and be back. Our conversations are always so interesting because you are
23.64s: so upfront, you're available, and we're dealing with issues that all us human beings face
30.52s: rather than just superficial crap.
33.00s: Yeah, exactly. That's the way I look at it. I mean, what better test subject than
37.96s: somebody like me because there's nothing not to look at. Right before we launch the
44.04s: podcast, we talked actually really quick about the main things I wanted to cover today.
48.96s: So just to recap those quickly, you have a better version than I do. Maybe you give
53.12s: us the agenda for today because you're sounding way better than mine did.
56.76s: Well, you said let's do something easy that'll change lives. Let's do some find something
61.64s: hidden that'll improve traders lives. And then let's create a framework for analysis that
69.80s: will improve traders lives. So that was the three things I got. And I thought, geez,
75.20s: you're sure making it easy.
77.12s: I mean, you make it easier than chat GPT because all of those topics that I said were way
84.68s: less impactful than your versions. But yeah, that's kind of it. So after a few of our conversations,
92.76s: a lot of things come into my mind about the world of psychology with respect to trading.
97.24s: And one of the things that I try to remind traders of frequently is trading is that it's part
102.60s: of the gift in the curse is that it's it's just you. You are the researcher. You are the
108.20s: trader. You are the risk manager. You have a lot of hats that you have to wear. And I think a lot
115.08s: of us jump straight into the technical aspects of trading that we kind of forget some of these
120.92s: underpinning concepts. So I thought it would be really useful to start with some of those broader
127.48s: topics, kind of specifically those first two that you outlined so well. And then later, I would
133.32s: love to talk a little bit more about this process of like self assessment because I find it something
139.88s: I spent a lot of time actually trying to do is understand myself better my decision making.
144.28s: And one of the things I noticed from where I started trading back in 2007, I was a I was a teenager
150.36s: at that point. I was a young dude. And now I'm 33. So it's like just a lot of my perception of the
157.72s: world has changed even in that time frame. And hopefully it will continue to change as I gain more
162.84s: knowledge. So I find that the way that I analyze myself has changed a lot. And I find that a lot of
170.04s: what I used to do was very superficial. And I'm curious if there's ways that we can dive more into
177.08s: that. So take us back to the beginning though. I thought it would be really useful for us to
183.24s: identify some of the more common pitfalls that exist so that ideally we don't spend a bunch of
190.52s: time in there if possible. Well, this is really interesting because my assistant is accumulating
198.20s: over 2000 assessments that we've done. And the text of people saying what are their issues. And we're
207.96s: going to come up with a real list. Now intuitively I kind of have a sense of it. But one of the first
214.20s: categories is is there an easy exercise something that we can do that's a little more superficial.
220.04s: And you already started the topic. You mentioned traders have to wear a lot of hats.
226.36s: So there's the risk assessment hat. There's the strategy development hat and there's the
232.68s: strat and there's the execution hat. When I work for a trading firm, those were clearly divided.
239.48s: The analysts, the researchers, the risk people and the executors. So what I would get is a trader on
248.20s: the floor would be prices to buy and sell above and below. So I had one function execute, just execute.
258.04s: Well, what a wait a minute. What this is the no, don't worry about risk. We've got that managed. We've
264.28s: got a whole umbrella of things we're balancing just executed. But, but no, no, just execute, Rhett.
272.52s: But for the independent trader, you have a dream. You work on a strategy.
281.88s: Sometimes in a lot of times you don't even deal with the risk because somehow that is not
286.52s: comfortable. But even if you do, that's a separate hat. And then you have the execution. So what I
292.76s: work with my traders is literally, oh, she's having is to have three baseball caps, you know, like green,
299.88s: blue, red, red is the risk management. The blue is the execution. The green is the strategy
308.76s: development, for example. So you only do one function at a time. Once you've got your strategy
315.48s: development done, you've done your risk management. Now it's time just execute execute. And that is
323.16s: so hard to step into just that because you bring your strategy development, your risk management.
331.08s: And as a result, your execution is just tied up and oh, maybe I should wait a little bit.
336.36s: You know, this doesn't seem quite right. So the easy part, the first exercise is where different hats
344.36s: know which hat you're wearing. And when you come to execution, just execute.
349.48s: The interesting part there, and I noticed this about your process a little more regularly than
357.88s: I don't know, I would have intuitively thought. But I've noticed several times now that you use
364.04s: kind of almost visceral annotations of something, right? So like to your point, like a physical hat,
370.28s: like something something to cause a perceived change of environment.
376.60s: Can you talk a little bit more about that as like a tool that you use? Sure.
381.40s: When a judge steps into the chamber, he puts on his robe. And that says, I am stepping out of my
389.96s: personal biases. When you go into the military, you put on a uniform that says, I am here to serve
397.88s: my buddies and my countries. When a policeman puts on a uniform, a priest puts on their
405.00s: their robes. All this is a physical embodiment of me stepping in a role that is higher than myself.
415.64s: So if we can recreate that for traders, I think that is really helpful because in the heat of the
421.96s: moment, to stay in that one embodiment is really challenging because of our emotional nature.
430.04s: It leads me to another really curious question. Slight rabbit trail, but completely correlated,
437.40s: is I've always done a really purposeful thing where I create space like I have an office at my house.
445.96s: Right? So like when I'm in my office, there's certain things that happen in the office that don't
451.24s: happen in other spaces in the house. One of the things I find interesting with trading though,
456.92s: is that so much of it is done here. Yes. That's with me when I leave the office. That's with me when I go
466.28s: to the gym. So when you think about other ways for traders, at least to be not necessarily make a
473.64s: bunch of changes unnecessarily, but at least to be aware of because to me, that's as you mentioned
479.24s: that, I think about that. And I think like, that's actually kind of interesting because sometimes I'll
483.64s: be sitting in the hot tub and I'll hear an alert go off. And then I'll start doing my thing there.
489.88s: And that's probably not the same mindset that I would be if I'm in my office with my setup
495.96s: in structure. So when you look at it from a retail trading perspective, are there other things that
501.96s: you think they should be keeping in mind with respect to things like environment, when they choose
507.32s: to do things, whether it's like bounding it by time, anything like that. Yeah, I'm fact I have
513.16s: and we may have discussed this my mind metrics program. Yes. And what this is is a structure
520.84s: that sets us up to have a good strategy to analyze the strategy to be able to manage risk
529.48s: management to execute and then to see very explicitly which of our processes, including our mind
538.36s: body states, we have a place for that, our set scores of sensations, emotions and thoughts
545.72s: so that we can really see which of those inputs is making the biggest impact on our success.
555.08s: That's awesome. That makes a lot of sense too because yeah, when I think about the
560.84s: how easily what we do translates into wherever we are and the way that I think about things
567.72s: is different in different places and different settings. So that's it's kind of something I think
572.52s: is worth at least noting for people and I love that idea of the way that you come up with like
577.80s: your set score and making sure that we're tying things together that may otherwise be imperceptible
583.64s: because my guess is if people that are listening to this right now, if they took the time to take a
588.92s: look at their last 100 trades and even tie it to a location if it's not in one spot, there might be
595.16s: some sort of correlation. Yeah, so our sets scores are sensations, our physical sensations,
602.92s: our emotions and the quality of our thoughts and it's amazing that it's not a one-to-one correlation
611.16s: but as you enter those that they get color coded so you can see the colors and then you can see
618.92s: your P&L and broadly speaking you can see the waves of how our mindset, our emotions,
628.52s: our quality of our thoughts are correlated with our P&L and once you do that then you can start
635.64s: making choices as an agent that is sitting above those as rather just rather than being reactive
643.80s: inside of them. Yeah, yeah and it's another really interesting thing that I definitely notice
649.88s: that you've introduced me to more so than I generally would do with myself where you talk a lot
656.20s: about kind of almost like a third party analysis of you like outside looking at it and can you talk
665.24s: a little bit more about why you think that that's so important in the process of analyzing oneself?
671.08s: Sure, it comes down to a concept of agency. So let's say I'm driving down and in fact I just
679.48s: had an interview this morning we talked about I'm driving down the road, somebody just
683.88s: yeah, I see him come up behind me really fast he whoops around whoops right in front of me in
688.68s: between two cars and I'm going to sun up a big ride, I have no agency. That aggressive driver
699.72s: is determining my emotional state which goes into my physiology, my stomach, my acid, my heart rate.
709.00s: He is I am allowing him, it's always a him, it's women don't do that. I'm allowing him to actually
719.00s: shorten my life. So if on the other hand I say okay what is my job here and in this case
729.56s: my job is like a computer game to get my passengers to the destination safely and comfortably.
737.64s: Are there going to be assholes on the road? Absolutely, are there people? Yes, with self, you know
747.08s: texting, oh yes, are there going to people who are just tired or maybe inebriated? Oh yes.
753.88s: So now my job and this is where it's really cool, is I see that guy coming up behind me really fast
760.92s: and changing lanes quickly? Okay I'm going to move over, I'm going to move back, I'm going to do this,
767.88s: I'm going to give him the opportunity to do that and my passengers are not even going to notice.
773.40s: I'll do that a dozen times on a long trip where I am playing a computer game and at the end of the
781.40s: game when we were safe, I go yes, I played that game really well. I made one mistake here, I could have
790.36s: done that better but I'll remember that for next time. So did that person determine my emotions?
797.40s: No, I reframed it. So in training, you know you put in a bi, it automatically it puts in a stop,
806.84s: bang, it's hit immediately, son of a bitch, those guys came in and they just ran the stops,
812.68s: you know they were just waiting for us son of a bitch and now watch, it's going to go up,
816.92s: it's going to turn around, oh shit, what a, what if again this was the game and I enjoyed playing it
830.92s: and I have agency, in other words, I continually framed the world in a way that I am in charge
838.84s: of my own responses. I think one of the most powerful things about that too is it highlights
849.32s: how important self-understanding and control is. You highlight this, let's bracket the word control
857.80s: for a minute but keep going. Because when I think about, and it's funny because especially from
864.68s: a military background, we're a lot of the things that you talk about really resonate because it's
872.36s: a lot of the ways that we're taught especially as marine officers where you're going to be the
877.16s: dude that people are looking at. So as soon as we have a plan that we're trying to execute and
882.20s: just like in trading as soon as you try to execute it, some shit always happens literally,
887.24s: oh, we're not a doubt. And you're just, you get so primed in something happening that when it
893.32s: happens, you're not even like, I can't believe this happened. You're literally just like, I expected
898.68s: something. But your job is to handle those things as they happen. Okay, here's a new thing,
906.20s: it's going to test me and I'm going to feel so good when I rise to the equation. I feel so good
913.56s: that I can handle some chaos. I feel so good that I am so as such confidence in myself in the world
922.44s: that when things fall apart, I can be the man standing that everyone looks, looks to for guidance.
930.28s: Wow, does that feel good? So rather than having the chaos or the internet expected, go, oh,
935.24s: shit. Okay, this is a chance for Eric to shine. Now a follow on question, one of the things we do
945.00s: in the military a lot that I see in some other places where it's like typically more kinetic
949.96s: environments. So think like police officers, paramedics is you kind of, you use humor a lot.
958.52s: And it's is a coping mechanism. It's not necessarily because you think X, Y or Z is actually like
963.72s: that funny. But you notice that it becomes like a coping mechanism. So like in the military, a big
968.92s: thing, you know, you'll hear anybody in the military, you'll hear the saying like, if it ain't raining,
973.16s: we ain't training, right? It's just the fact that like you know that you're going to be out there
976.60s: for three, three weeks. And the first day you go out there, you're going to get dumped on with rain.
981.32s: And you just know it and it's you're going to be wet for the next few days. And you're just,
985.16s: you just you make a joke about it. You're like, man, well, at least we're getting some water
990.84s: training in it. You know, I mean, like you come up with something. Yes, humor is a way to develop
995.72s: agency because if you're in the middle of this and you're just a reaction to it, God is reading
1002.12s: it. You know, when I'm going to, you are just reacting. And the event is determined in your
1009.00s: experience. But humor means you need to have some agency and being able to look for a edit from a
1015.08s: higher level. Fascinating. Do you think that there's a point where if you develop almost,
1023.64s: is there a point where you can develop too much agency? I don't know if that makes sense in this
1027.72s: context. I think of it as sometimes I will have Marines that they get so used to everything going
1036.92s: wrong and making jokes about things that they almost don't know how to flip back the other
1043.08s: mode though. Word. Now it's time to execute. It's time to get serious. Like cut the fucking
1049.48s: joking. We need to go work now. The joking is good. It gets us to a certain spot. Then we have
1055.80s: to flip a switch and get back at it. I don't know if that translates into the concept of agency at
1061.72s: all our in trading, right? Because like I can think in trading where it's like we make the same
1065.80s: joke all the time. Oh, I placed a buy order and as soon as I place it, I get a stopped out or
1069.56s: whenever I place a trade, the market's going to make me wrong. But part of me is curious if there
1074.04s: comes a point where you start planting that seed in your mind subconsciously and then that actually
1079.40s: takes root in a negative way. Curious your thoughts on that. Yeah. Well, what you're pointing out is
1084.60s: another way to avoid agency. In other words, if I just say, just happening again, oh geez,
1092.36s: stopped out of here. Oh, it's raining again. It's like who cares that another
1099.32s: words, the event is so overwhelming or I lose my motivation as versus agency is, okay, here's
1108.20s: this event. I am capable, competent of handling and staying focused. So agency is a real powerful
1119.00s: state as versus when humor can sink into I don't give a you know what right, right? Okay, so it
1125.96s: sounds like for my understanding, it sounds like agency is like that balance. It's like being able
1130.68s: to strike the difference between, you know, whatever your the mechanism is to maintain awareness,
1136.52s: but not becoming like so desensitized like, oh, I'm stopped out again. Who cares? None of this
1140.76s: matters. It sounds like a real balance. Yeah, it's I'm not fond of the word balance. Okay,
1148.04s: but it is a self awareness. Now, okay, we're human beings. So we're going to have a waves of highs
1156.20s: and lows and emotions and focus and unfocused times where aware we're agents and we're fully agent
1163.24s: there's times when we just want to kick back with their times and are overwhelmed. But again,
1168.28s: what I do is the golden keys is first and so awareness acceptance and agency and so if we're aware
1175.80s: of what state we're in, then we have the ability to make the changes we want. I see. So then
1185.40s: dovetailing then off of kind of the broader question here when you're thinking about
1191.56s: a trader's path like a typical trader's path. I don't know how you would split the life span of a
1200.20s: trader. I don't know if you think of it in different stages in terms of if they're a beginner experienced.
1207.24s: But the main question I'm thinking of what this concept of agency is like, what does agency look
1214.28s: like throughout the life span of a trader? Like, what does agency look like for a beginner,
1219.88s: intermediate, advanced or however you would bucket it? Yeah, I have a PowerPoint slide. That's
1224.68s: just perfect. It starts out with all my gosh trading. I'm told I can make a lot of money. I look
1233.00s: at all those ads that incident well fast easy money. And this is going to fill my dreams. My father
1238.84s: will respect me. I'll get laid more often. I'm able to, you know, have a mansion in a car and I'll
1245.16s: be a pillar of the community and people will like me. So you have this huge dream. And
1252.44s: what this means is this dream is so central to what our hearts desire is that every tip in the
1260.76s: market our way goes, yes, cars, women, men, whatever fancy it's every tick against you is,
1271.08s: oh my god, my life is falling apart because my dream won't be there. Huge pressure on it.
1277.56s: So we move from every trade being profitable or unprofitable, which moves us emotionally in
1284.60s: one direction or the other to say, okay, we need to focus on strategy. So then we refine strategies,
1293.72s: we create them, we make them, we mess with them. And finally we have a strategy that has been
1301.80s: back tested and we're ready to go. We take it to market. And then we have our doubts and then
1309.24s: we're not sure if the indicators are all there or we think, oh, this doesn't, oh, we can violate
1316.04s: the strategy. And so then what we do is we lose confidence in our strategy. Very few of the
1326.04s: clients who come to me are able to execute a strategy consistently. Never mind that they have
1333.56s: confidence in it. Never mind that they've tested it. Never mind that they've done the mass so
1338.60s: that they actually executed. It would be very profitable. So then we come to the point.
1345.80s: Next step is, okay, we've learned to just execute this strategy. It doesn't matter if it's
1351.72s: going to make money or not. Our job is like my job on the floor of the exchange with my firm was
1357.48s: rich, just execute. Don't question, just execute. And they get to that point.
1363.08s: Oh my God. And then something happens. The strategy executing it very well. We're losing money
1371.16s: over a day, a week, even longer. So the next stage is the loss of confidence in the strategy.
1383.40s: And I have traders who argue with me on this. So this is a contentious point.
1390.76s: But that's the only way. That is all strategies fail.
1397.48s: And they have to in this age of artificial intelligence, affirms who have
1406.44s: PhD, quants, any strategy that's profitable for any length of time.
1414.36s: Every, you know, all the algorithms and all the other traders are going to catch onto it.
1419.48s: And when they all pile on, of course, it dissolves because the strategy doesn't have enough
1425.16s: liquidity for everybody. So if you are then in the place, say, okay, this strategy works in this
1433.64s: kind of market, this strategy works in this kind of market. In fact, in the mind metrics application,
1441.48s: we test strategies in different kinds of markets. And then we move to market moods. My job is
1448.84s: determine what mood the market is. And then once I get now that that's not trivial, by the way,
1455.08s: that's really hard. But I determine what the market mood is. I know what strategy tests well in it.
1462.60s: And that's what I do. And I know it's going to fall apart at some point. The most money that I've
1468.12s: ever made as a trader on the floors was when there was a shift in the market, what I call the market
1475.00s: mood. And I remember very distinctly, where you were in the options floor putting on the spread
1481.88s: was really profitable because the implied volatility between the two legs of the spread were
1490.52s: quite wide. So we were putting it on and we'd been doing this for a week or 10 days and kept
1495.40s: coming back and put it on and it was just like this money pump. And then all of a sudden,
1502.28s: I noticed the firms were coming in the other way. And I said, you know, something's different.
1508.28s: Every all the other market makers kept putting on the spread. I got out of my spread and I went the
1513.08s: other way. I reversed it. And all of a sudden the spread got wider and wider. And all the market
1522.28s: makers were getting squeezed and hurting. And finally they had to get out. But by that time,
1527.16s: I had a huge inventory being long that spread. I lit them all out and made the very happy to help
1533.40s: them out. Yeah, you just. I'm such a sweetheart. Sure, I'll take you. I believe what a nice guy I am.
1544.68s: But the point is that they did not shift. They did not have a sense of the shift in the markets.
1552.76s: So the primary skill of an independent trader is to determine when that market type format, whatever
1562.44s: you want to call it, market mood starts to shift. But if you are locked into a system and applying
1569.48s: that system across a large sample size, eventually it's going to come to a point where it's not
1575.40s: going to work as well. And then you start to redo the system. You start to, you know, just mess with
1583.00s: the different algorithms and and you're chasing the market and then it shifts again. So if you say,
1588.92s: okay, my sister works really. In fact, what I do is I have my clients described market heaven.
1596.76s: Oh, market heaven. Oh my God. If I have a trending system, it always when it breaks out into a trend,
1609.40s: it never goes back. It just trends for a long time. Reverse this a little bit stops me out.
1615.56s: I get to trend the other way. Oh, it's just so sweet. That's market heaven for my trending system.
1623.32s: Market hell for my trending system is the market center range. It breaks out.
1629.88s: And then it comes back and then it breaks out the other way and goes a little farther. But then
1636.04s: it comes back so that it's increasing the range. So I just get stopped out time and time and time
1642.84s: again. So once we understand what market heaven is and what market hell is, then we can start to
1649.96s: define it in terms of volume, implied volatility and options in terms of the length of each bar or
1661.96s: the volume, all sorts of criteria we can look at. And we're always looking for market heaven and
1668.04s: market hell. I love that. So then if you were to summarize then kind of the easy thing a trader can
1677.96s: do to change their trading life, is that what it would summarize up to? Well, the easy thing was just
1684.84s: knowing if you're in strategy mode, in risk management mode or in execution mode.
1695.16s: This is the most challenging
1700.04s: ask of an independent trader. And this is the most difficult. You asked about a framework for
1707.48s: analysis. We all avoid that because we focus on our strategies and we focus on our dream.
1717.24s: And we're looking for this perfect strategy when the really hard part is determined what's the
1722.76s: quality of the market and is it shifting. Our brains are set up so that if we get rewarded like
1728.84s: pigeons, you can teach them to walk and figure eight, you know, just by rewarding them. My wife can
1734.60s: get me to do about anything she wants by putting incremental rewards there for me. She's very good at
1741.72s: that. Yeah. So we get used to it. And like the traders on the floor in that example is once we
1752.52s: get used to something like during the dot com boom, a whole bunch of traders went to trading floors
1757.56s: that have never traded before. And they were given capital. And my god, they just made money,
1763.16s: made money, made money, but I have not talked to one trader who made money during the dot com boom
1770.60s: that kept it or any big part of it because they just got rewarded for doing the behavior and when
1778.12s: it ended, they couldn't believe it. And they just kept doing it until it was gone.
1783.40s: That makes a lot of sense. And I think one of the things I use for an example,
1787.80s: well, there's a couple of traders that I use for an example on this. But the idea that
1792.60s: the process of making money is obviously heart and parcel to being a trader, but then there's
1798.36s: the process of keeping money, which even some of the best traders we've ever seen struggle to do
1803.48s: that. Jesse Livermore is a prime time example. Yep. Yes, the equity curve. And what I work on,
1812.12s: no trader has ever come to me and said, Rich, my biggest concern is being able to develop wealth
1821.24s: and keep wealth and know that I deserve it and not sabotage myself. Not one, no trader has ever
1829.88s: come to me with the problem. And I say, well, let's work on your, your being wealthy and the issues
1838.20s: that will create. Oh, no, that's not a problem at all. Oh, no. But what happens is, you know,
1843.64s: there's the imposter syndrome. There's the sense of what if you were consistently profitable
1850.36s: trading, you increase your size slowly, all of a sudden, you are in very, rarefied atmosphere.
1859.72s: Your friends who are maybe a middle class life, you're stepping way beyond that, your community,
1866.20s: all the messages about wealth and success, maybe negative ones from your upbringing,
1873.40s: income taxes, bookkeeping, friends coming to you for money, you are stepping into a whole
1880.44s: new world of power. And many of my traders, they come to me, they get to that point.
1889.72s: And the sabotage usually is in a short period of time. Sometimes in a day, they'll lose six months
1895.88s: with the work or two to three days. Once they start down, the whole, their survival mechanism kicks
1904.12s: in, they forget everything they've learned, they double up, they try to recoup it,
1909.40s: and they end up giving it away. But the good news is now we're comfortable in, I am used to
1915.40s: struggle as a trader. The thought of not struggling as a trader is, I don't know what that's like.
1924.60s: I'm fascinated by this because I've been really fortunate in my trading career so far. And
1933.80s: I've never felt the concept of like self sabotage, but I assume it's probably there in some
1943.48s: former fashion based on the way that you're describing it. Well, it could be that you don't have
1950.68s: the identity issues. Usually it comes down to, I'm not worthy. And I could give you my own example,
1960.60s: in my life where, and I don't know, I probably told the story about how I was traded three years,
1967.24s: I traded on my own and made 200,000 every year. And the voice woke me up in the middle of the night
1973.16s: and said, Rich, you're not worth 200,000 a year. I got stuck at that level. And it's a 10 minute
1980.20s: story and I won't go into it. But I realized I was done with that internal limitation. And it had
1986.36s: to do with my beliefs about my own capabilities. And I had negative beliefs. And so I didn't allow myself
1995.88s: to make more money. And that day I went into the exchange early. The doors were still locked.
2000.76s: I got to the pit. The first trader there, I stood in the best pit. And I had to fight for that spot
2006.84s: because the guy that was always in the best spot, he was a tough SOB, right? So I stood my ground.
2014.60s: There was a thread of a fine from the exchange if we got into a fight. The bell went off and I just
2020.04s: went crazy. Rich, the pit thought, Rich, freezing a gun, that's by him, so I'm, I'm scream right now,
2027.00s: but I don't want to blow your ears off. But you know, I went on to make many times my 200,000
2032.60s: dollar limit. But it was just a mind game around my own identity and my worth. And traders do not
2044.92s: often get to the point where they're saying, am I worthy of this? Can I live in this rarefied world?
2053.56s: I mean, some of us are so used to struggle that we don't know what life is like stepping out of
2060.12s: struggle. In fact, we have survival mechanisms that say, I know how, Rich, Rich,
2066.60s: reason knows how to survive this struggle. He struggled with this, and with this, and he was a kid.
2073.48s: He knows how to survive it. So I'm going to keep this struggle going because we can survive it.
2079.24s: But can we survive something wonderful? Oh, no, no, we don't know that. So we're going to stay in this
2085.32s: struggle. That's absolutely fascinating. It really is because one of the things I love talking to you
2092.84s: is gaining exposure to like these other things that honestly, like don't really cross my mind. I've
2098.36s: never really thought about like my own worthiness in that context. And it goes back to something I,
2105.64s: I've always postulated about myself where it's like, I'm smart enough to know how to do things.
2111.56s: But I'm dumb enough to not spend enough time thinking about how I'm not that smart.
2117.72s: It's this little circle where I'm like the thought of assessing whether or not I'm worthy.
2122.44s: Literally, it never even comes up. Well, that's wonderful.
2126.44s: Well, maybe it's not. Maybe it's because I'm too dumb to think about it. But I think it's
2132.04s: a really interesting point, though, because at least I think for people like me that grow up poor,
2139.32s: the ability to like work really hard and then see an outcome, I guess for me, that
2145.32s: in and at least makes it feel somewhat like it's like worthy, right? Like put an effort,
2151.64s: have outcome. But I can see for other people different reasons why they might not feel worthy.
2158.28s: But I'm really curious from your research and from your work, what are the most common reasons
2163.00s: why somebody might not feel worthy themselves? Yeah. So what I do is I do a guided visualization.
2170.76s: Deep breathing, relax. In fact, we could do a really, this is usually an hour or two hours,
2178.52s: but we could do an abbreviated version. So if you understand this is like on five times speed,
2185.16s: create a the perfect trader's house. Successful trader's house is it by the ocean and the mountains
2191.80s: by his stream. Is it a log cabin? Is it modern design? So I have them design the house,
2198.36s: the glottic glass. Okay, you're standing on the road, on the driveway, looking at the house.
2204.92s: This is where a successful trader lives. So then I have them start to approach the house.
2211.00s: How is your breathing? How is your muscle tension? As you walk toward this perfect house for a
2218.36s: trader, what do you notice? What thoughts are you having? So then we go all the way up to the
2223.80s: porch, put our hand on the door handle. What kind of handle is it? What do you feel right now?
2231.16s: Okay, so I want you to look back and in the driveway is start is everyone who's ever impacted your
2238.60s: life. You are about to step into a successful trader's house. Who is objecting? My dad is objecting.
2252.28s: Let's go back. Let's talk to your dad. I grew up in the depression.
2258.28s: We had to work hard and to make money easily is just wrong. Do you know I work three jobs
2266.20s: to put your dad and your, I'm your grandpa, you know, to put your dads and your kids through,
2271.80s: we had eight kids. And here you are just thinking that you can just step into this easy life.
2279.40s: Whoa, now here's a message that is embedded in the past. And I'm exaggerating this a bit, of course.
2286.68s: So okay, so let's then we have conversations with dad, with grandpa or dad or mom or uncles
2293.72s: or brothers or whoever it is that has concern. And it almost always comes down to they want the best
2302.84s: for you. And they are sad that they had to work so hard, work their fingers to the bone in order
2312.60s: to provide just the essentials. And eventually we can come to the place where they can accept
2319.80s: you step into the house. And when we go up to the house again, we look back again, we open the door,
2326.12s: what are the physiology your experience in as you open the door, what's your breathing, your muscle
2331.24s: tension. We go to the trader's room, describe the trader's room, sit down. Do you deserve to be here?
2339.64s: Sometimes the answer is no, this isn't me. I don't deserve this. Then we go back and work on that.
2345.40s: So we we keep doing that until the person says, if they're identity, their beliefs and their behaviors
2354.84s: are all in rapport and they deserve to be there. Now when they go to trading, what we do is we anchor
2362.52s: that house, we visualize it, create a picture of it so that now that feeling of rapport and
2371.40s: the unification of their physiology, their emotions, their thoughts, all the history so that they can
2378.20s: now step into that state intentionally as an agent in their own life as versus having all these
2386.84s: old conflicts and voices fighting them all the way so that they end up sabotaging themselves so
2394.20s: they can go back and end that stress. Interesting. So then when you work with people that tend to have
2402.20s: this feeling of like a variance and worthiness compared to where they are, do you think that it
2410.68s: often comes from self-imposed perceptions that don't actually reflect reality necessarily. So to your
2420.68s: point, if we have the conversation with Grandpa in our mind and it goes like that, but then in
2426.92s: reality, Grandpa actually doesn't necessarily feel that way. Like really wants you to be
2432.60s: just gave away the secret. Yes. When we have those conversations that turns out that he loved you
2439.08s: and he wants you to do well, but that we just picked up his anger around working so hard,
2446.52s: trying to provide for the family, the taxes come, the rent was raised, just anger around all those
2453.08s: things and are what we're not infantile. But our youngest self absorbs all these and reinterpret
2465.72s: that message in a way that doesn't serve us. Oh my gosh, there were times that I misunderstood
2472.28s: some things my dad said, you know, total, I just misheard the words and it created an image in my
2479.32s: mind that I carried forward for a long time. So that's a great observation. Thank you, Eric.
2485.40s: Yeah, interesting. So to pivot then to kind of like this idea of a less apparent thing for somebody
2494.52s: to think about, to transform their trading lives, what's something that you come across
2500.76s: fairly regularly, but a trader might not consider for themselves that they would want to know about
2509.00s: change be aware of as it pertains to their ability to be a successful trader. Yeah, I think that we
2516.76s: already looked at the most deepest thing and that is our identity, our beliefs and our behaviors
2523.56s: and the foundation of who we are and are we deserving. And that's the hidden framework that
2530.04s: most traders, it doesn't even occur to them to go that there, but without that positive foundation,
2536.52s: without that rapport with all parts of ourselves, we end up sabotaging the typical equity curve
2545.16s: of a trader who comes to me. Let's, is boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
2556.04s: and that at that top of that peak there, you know, what's going on? And sometimes it's
2567.56s: the imposter syndrome. I mean, sometimes it's just so powerful to realize how your life will change
2573.24s: if you can do that consistently and just keep increasing size. Oh my gosh. And we do a lot of
2580.84s: visualizations like, okay, you have a $10 million in the bank now. What, what house do you live in?
2589.16s: What, what friends do you have? Oh, my friends are just trying to suck off of me or my friends don't,
2597.24s: you know, they just not comfortable or I don't tell anybody and I just keep it private.
2603.24s: So we, we look at stepping into that successful place and imagining it and visualize it and
2610.52s: getting a visceral feeling for it because until you can viscerally step into success, parts of
2619.24s: ourselves will not let us go there because we don't know the risk. So my job is to give them a
2625.72s: visceral experience of success. Check, just like we look back in the driveway, check all the things
2631.88s: that are resistant to that so that they can have rapport with that experience.
2638.76s: When you think about this process of creating like these visceral responses or perceptions of
2645.56s: something or the self-analysis, what are your thoughts on inviting the world of excess analysis
2656.04s: and creating a cycle where everything becomes so analyzed that it kind of locks somebody up?
2669.56s: Yeah, for me, the model that works for me recently is life is a wave. In other words,
2677.40s: there's all sorts of parts when I'm building a strategy, it's excess analysis all the way.
2684.20s: I'm aware I'm in analysis. I'm aware that I am thinking details, whatever. Okay, I go out of that
2691.72s: and I go into a different part of the wave. So the important part is, I think what you're
2696.84s: implying is if we get locked into that excessive analysis, that top part of the wave,
2702.52s: well, that means that we're cutting out our intuitive creative abilities,
2709.40s: we're cutting out the ability to execute faithfully, maybe. So for me, like having the three hats,
2717.48s: if I think of life as a wave, okay, and I can intentionally, I'm going into analysis right now.
2724.04s: And I'm going to spend the next two days or three days just in analysis.
2730.04s: When I was had a floor trading firm,
2733.64s: the part of it was CFTC, SEC, the Pacific Stock Exchange, the tax authorities,
2747.40s: tremendous amount of paperwork, you know, piles like this. And as a trader,
2754.04s: no way I could even look at them. So I had to end up going in on a Sunday and I'd pace
2760.36s: back and forth and look at that paperwork and pace back and forth. Finally, I'd say, okay,
2765.56s: I am going into operational details and I'd pick up one piece of paper, handle it,
2773.16s: give it to the right person to follow through or whatever it needed. And then I could do that. So
2779.00s: I can step into that operational phase. I can step into analysis phase. I can step into
2785.56s: creativity states. And the important part is as an agent in my life, what part do I want to be in?
2792.52s: And how do I trigger that? So if I can do that, be aware of what part I'm in and eventually create
2800.28s: the agency to determine what part I want to be in, that is heaven. I see. So we have around 10 minutes.
2811.24s: And I want to continue that thread specifically on this idea of like self analysis.
2817.72s: Because one of the things I find that's so different, and again, maybe this is just because I'm
2823.16s: generally a lay person that just kind of starts doing things, is that I go through a layer of
2830.36s: analysis typically on something. And then if I feel like it's good, good enough, I'm cool
2837.40s: executing it and then moving on. And I think a lot of that also just stems from the military,
2842.12s: because we want an 80% solution now executed violently over 100% solution later.
2852.20s: When I think about the world of traders now and the wealth of information, I could just see
2859.08s: the propensity even from a self analysis perspective. Like when we're thinking about ourselves
2865.40s: our worthiness, if there's misalignment between our values, I could just see that also becoming
2872.60s: gridlock and kind of circuitous. So when you think about somebody that's going through this self
2879.56s: analysis process to like better understand themselves, their psychology decision making,
2884.92s: are there any methods that they can employ so that as they're analyzing something,
2891.88s: they're coming to an output that then they're satisfied with that output perceivably,
2897.00s: and then can move to the next output versus cycling on the same thing.
2902.04s: Well, I certainly understand what you're saying. Something executed right now, 80%
2908.12s: immediately violently learn, adjust, execute. And that is so important because it
2917.40s: extended analysis means you're not learning Ditch-Shot.
2922.44s: So execute, execute, execute, learn, adjust, learn, execute, adjust. Again, it's a wave.
2931.24s: So if you say I'm going to get 80% analysis, I'm going to execute, I'm in execution mode,
2937.32s: I'm in review mode, and I'm going to look at what happened, I'm going to improve analysis, 80%,
2944.52s: 70% execute. And so you have that wave where you and you know where you're at. I do have
2951.72s: clients that come to me that just in agony over their strategy and they'll send me
2959.56s: 20 pages of details of their strategy and where they and should I adjust this by point
2966.04s: 0.01%. And when we get down to it, many of them are afraid
2974.04s: of being wrong, of executing, of learning in a chaos that they're looking for a structure
2981.72s: to give them comfort. So the more I analyze the structure, the more comfortable I feel,
2987.56s: and yet there's something non-at-me, I'm not moving forward and I'm not getting done.
2992.52s: So what I do is say, well, okay, let's just play. And I, let's set up a demo account,
2998.76s: and your job is just to execute at 70%. That's it. We're not, there's no money involved,
3006.28s: but consistently execute the strategy just consistently. And we're going to measure you not
3012.36s: on the PNL, but did you execute the strategy? And they'll execute maybe at 40% at the time.
3020.12s: Okay, we're going to, we've now measured the 10 trades, you're executing 40%. Let's move it up
3025.64s: to 60%. 70%, 80%. Until we're executing consistently, now we're learning. So we're also
3033.72s: learning that every trade, every trade has a reason not to make it in that moment, because if there
3044.12s: wasn't, I mean, if there wasn't a reason it, then it's probably not a good trend.
3052.20s: There's always reasons not to execute. So again, it's a wave, nowhere you are in the wave,
3058.68s: and analysis paralysis executing that 70% if you're consistent with it, you'll learn more.
3069.08s: One of the most impactful things that took me a long time to get over, especially when I was
3074.68s: a younger dude, I always felt like I had to perform exceedingly well. And it never really
3085.56s: felt imposed externally. It always felt like it was just an expectation I had of myself or whatever
3090.60s: reason. I don't know the background behind it. But when I think about one of the big pivots I made
3097.00s: in my trading career, it was becoming okay with losing trades. Now, I find, and I know you don't like
3105.96s: to term, there might be a better term, but I find that there's a balance or maybe, you know,
3112.12s: not sure the term I would want to use here, but that there's a balance between
3117.88s: desensitizing and not tying the outcome of an individual trade to me as a human being,
3125.88s: but also treating losing trades with respect because they deserve respect. No, understand what happened.
3133.88s: What would you surmise the role and the optimal relationship with losing would be for a trader?
3143.16s: Yeah, what I do is we measure the percent of trades that are executed well.
3153.16s: And so we have trades that are executed well and trades that aren't. That's the only measurement
3159.96s: that we lose that we use. And so our job is to execute all the trades well and that's it. And if
3169.32s: the strategy doesn't hold up, we're going to learn that. So there is no loss. So you know from
3177.40s: neuroscience that our brains deliver twice the amount of pain for a X loss as it does for an X
3186.36s: game. So what we do is we only measure the execution. So if I can get my execution up to 80, 90%
3194.36s: of my strategy, that's a big win and we no longer lose. So we don't look to somehow not feel the
3205.88s: losses, but we reframe it so that our win is execution when we're in execution mode. And we'll say,
3213.56s: oh, well, it looks like that strategy didn't work very well in this market. Nothing to do with us.
3218.68s: No failure is just the strategy in the market. And our job was just to execute the strategy.
3225.00s: Okay, can I, is there indications that I could look for a different market mood to put this strategy
3231.56s: in? So then all of a sudden, we're not in the situation where we're having to feel the loss at all
3238.44s: because our only job is to execute the strategy and execute it well.
3245.80s: That's a really different perspective. And it's interesting to hear because to me,
3253.88s: hearing that it sounds like I would say that that person's hiding from reality that they're unable
3261.16s: to accept loss and that we can't even use the term loss. What do you think,
3269.00s: what do you think about that? Do you think that that's misguided or like my perspective?
3273.64s: Or do you think that it's relative to a person? Of course, everyone's different. But I find that
3280.92s: moving from handling loss to just executing the trades is something that's totally under your control.
3294.60s: Totally. So I have a category of trade executions that if you're rested, you did your research analysis,
3307.80s: you determined what strategy you were using and you executed it absolutely. That is a lucrative trade.
3317.16s: Doesn't matter if it's profitable or not. So it's a lucrative or it's not lucrative.
3323.88s: And our goal is just to make lucrative trades. Now, everything in a lucrative trade is under your
3329.40s: control. So you can have 100% lucrative trades. Now you can sit back after we're said and say,
3335.80s: okay, in fact, I have a spreadsheet, especially for this, that we look at each strategy and we can
3343.56s: determine and we look at the market mood and we can determine, well, how's this strategy working
3348.92s: in this market mood? But what that does is it removes our ego, our need from the equation because
3355.72s: when I was on the floor trading, my job was just to execute the trades. The firm gave me the values.
3363.32s: I bought under and sold over. That's all I did. So again, the three hats, you know, are you in
3371.08s: research and strategy building, are you in risk management or are you in execution mode? And once
3378.28s: you're in execution mode, the loss is not something you even consider because there is no loss. You're
3390.20s: making a series of lucrative trades. Now, when you look at it and review it, then you can
3395.40s: determine accurately whether that strategy and that market mood is working, but it's not you and
3401.24s: it's not your failure. Fascinating. Yeah, it's so interesting. I love and I love the way that you
3409.32s: kind of share like a very different perspective in the way that it's still I can see how that would
3416.28s: work for somebody. And when I look at the path of traders, it obviously seems highly individualized.
3425.08s: People have a lot of different motivating factors in the way that they perceive things.
3429.56s: When you look across your overall experience doing what you do, what are some of the most
3436.68s: common themes that you find among traders? Discipline, willpower. I need more discipline. I need
3444.60s: more willpower. That is the one that keeps coming up. I don't execute my strategy. I just need
3452.76s: more discipline and willpower. And so again, just like going from lousy to lucrative trading and
3460.12s: reframing that, I say there is no such thing as willpower. There's no such thing as discipline.
3467.32s: What there is is your experience of stepping into a state and an execution that feels better
3475.16s: in the moment. So let's set it up so that following your strategy feels better. So that is,
3482.12s: oh, I want to be there. I want to be there. I want to be there. As just a side note, what's
3488.36s: interesting, I'll often trade with my active traders. I'll be there on Zoom. I'll just be in a
3495.64s: window and I'll have them just kind of think out loud. Not one trader has ever violated their
3503.48s: strategy. Well, maybe once, but it just almost never violated their strategy, or I was there
3513.72s: present. Why is that? They didn't need willpower. They didn't need discipline. But I keep inviting
3521.96s: into their higher level agency and they know I'm there. And so what our training goes is to
3530.44s: have them incorporate that internally so they have that higher level agency.
3536.20s: I love that. That's fascinating too. I think the idea of becoming more familiar, like self-aware
3542.28s: with agency is probably something we have to spend more time on in the future because
3548.28s: it seems one of those topics that as you talk about it, it's kind of straight forward,
3553.16s: generally transparent. You kind of know what's there, but obviously it's incredibly nuanced.
3558.04s: So I love that you bring that to everybody's attention and something for them to focus on. But
3565.56s: as always, every time I talk to you, the time flies. And it's incredible. I really enjoy just learning
3573.24s: the perspectives. And I think that you offer a lot of really interesting ideas and approaches
3579.16s: that can work for all different kinds of people. So first, you know, quick thank you for coming
3584.60s: to hang out for a bit. But before we fully wrap up, is there anywhere that you want to send people
3589.48s: over to you? Obviously, throw your website in the description below so that everybody can come
3595.40s: find you there. But anything else? Yeah, mind mussels or traders.com. That's FOR. Mind mussels for
3603.80s: traders.com. There are maybe 60, 70 different blogs on there addressing almost all the issues
3611.88s: traders have. There's ways that you can order my book, a private conversation with money.
3619.24s: You can schedule time if you want. There's a way to schedule time with me to do
3625.40s: a discovery session. And we can look to see how I can best support you. So it's all there.
3631.08s: Mind mussels for traders. And I'd be happy to help or talk to any of your listeners and to see
3637.96s: how we can support them in their goals to become a consistently profitable trader.
3644.52s: Awesome. Thank you so much, Rich. Absolutely. Pleasure for hanging out. And I look forward to
3649.00s: keeping in touch. We'll have you back on soon. Well, let's do it again. In fact, let's make it a regular.
3654.28s: You don't scare me. Oh, okay. Next time I'll I'll be a little scary, right? Promise.
3663.56s: All right. We'll live up to it. Okay. Okay.
