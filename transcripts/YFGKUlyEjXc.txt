 What's up, allies? Quick market update because Nvidia, you know, essentially the whole stock market rests on Nvidia's shoulders right now has earnings tomorrow, the 20th after the close. So I want to walk through what I'm seeing in terms of the options as relating into it. Actually, I had a position on in here that I recently adjusted, not just because of earnings, but some of it due to what I'm going to walk you through. So what's going on here? Well, if we just poke through really quick, we can see Nvidia is hovering near six month highs. If we take it out to a year, it's essentially sitting at one year highs, five year highs, all time highs. You kind of get the the gesture where we're just hovering at highs. So the reason why this matters is because as we go through what the market looks like it might be expecting from Nvidia for earnings, it really depends on how you feel about playing something like this. The premise of what I'm saying here is Nvidia has traditionally done very well. And if we go through its prior earnings, I'll show you what I mean by this. If we look at its past four quarters of earnings, you can see a pretty clear trend that it's positive surprises all around. Now, one thing I want to note for you is notice the severity of the surprise, right? So looking at the quarter ending 1023, that was a 26.7%. Then one 24 was 16.7%. Then four 24 13.7%. Seven 24, eight point three percent. The main thing I'm highlighting is although Nvidia is still unequivocally crushing it, this is narrowing pretty tightly. And that's not to suggest that it might miss on this next earnings. That's the nature of earnings. Nobody knows what's going to happen. You can position for it directionally if you're so inclined. If you haven't underlying idea about how it might behave, but regardless of what you think about that, you can clearly see that the surprises definitely are narrowing out here, even though we still are hovering near all time. So let's take a look now at Nvidia itself. And I want to zoom us into a six month and show you a couple things. The first thing is if we just loosely eyeball volatility, we can absolutely see this starting to expand pretty significantly, right? And this is both seven day vol and 30 day vol. This is very normal leading into an earnings release. Nothing stands out to me there other than the fact that we're seeing a normal price behavior coming into earnings. Now we did have a really big day today. It was almost 5% up move. And there's a bunch of news wrapped around it. I don't want to get stuck in the news. I want to focus more on what it's actually functionally looking like around earnings. So let's look at its past earnings. This is going back to Q323. And obviously you can see Q325 all the way up here. And I want to talk about the behavior that we see leading into earnings. Down at the bottom here, you can see the actual EPS and then the expected EPS, right? So it continues to outperform. I think we've seen that pretty consistently. Now if we take a look at the immediate price movement post earnings release, it tends to gap to the upside. Right? So we can see that in this occurrence, this occurrence, this occurrence, this occurrence. So that obviously does not mean it is going to gap anywhere because we can also see in several occurrences is actually trended to the downside. It trended down here. It trended down here. It still went up but still had a down day following. So this is kind of like an inside move. And then it trended down here. So after three of these instances, it clearly trended down. It's almost a mixed bag, right? And that's what earnings should be. Now what I can tell you though from a positioning standpoint, the ability to capitalize on a gap in this instance from 2075 to 23 from here it went from 305 to 370. And then from here it went from 674 to 785. From here it went from 949 to 1037. What I'm highlighting is that these are much bigger moves than the down moves that it shows. So there's some opportunity in that context because if you want to place something like this to the upside, you almost have a slightly lower risk trade to the downside. Again, this can blow out at any point and become a massive downside move. But based on the recent earnings history that we can see, the upside tends to be via gapping of some capacity and the downside seems to be more so from downside drift. So that is what it is. Now in terms of selling volatility into this earnings, it looks really ugly. And what I mean by that is if you take a look at imply volatility, which is like the orange, and then historical volatility, which is the yellow, if you're selling volatility into earnings, what you want to see is the orange line remain above the yellow line after earnings. That means that implied volatility was estimated much higher than the realized move. A good example of that is right here. You can see that leading into earnings implied volatility was at 49 and change following earnings at crater to 37. So nice big IV contraction. And then the realized move was within tolerance. It was with with bounds. So this would be a profitable something like a short-striple for Strangle for the earnings release itself. So this now leads to some ideas. If you have a really strong bullish thesis in Nvidia, then again, you can kind of play this propensity for gapping to the upside. And then even the follow on drift, which Pied is what it's called post earnings announcement drift is a thing. There's certain conditions that have to be met or to exist. But let's take a look at this, for example, here earnings were expected at $5.14. It came in at 612 really big, really big B. Then we can see that there is clearly a strong gap following earnings that generally leads to drift over the following quarter. So now this, the interesting part about the drift that you experienced here did go through that August dip. But before the August dip that was seen across the whole market, it was up and off to the races. And same thing similar here. The main note I'm making is that stuff like post earnings announcement drift definitely is a little bit weaker in super, super, super big market companies like Nvidia. But if it has a good enough earnings release, it doesn't matter. It can still exhibit it, which it has here. It has here. This was a little bit different. It didn't have the correct conditions. And this is one of the instances where it actually contracted post earnings. So now for the upcoming earnings release, we have some conjecture around how aggressive the expectations have become and what that subsequently might mean for the performance of Nvidia. Because sooner or later, the analysts projecting what EPS might look like, they can get a little too aggressive, which even though the growth might look really good, if it still doesn't top expectations, that's problematic. And it typically leads to the market not really digging the movements. So let's take a look at the options chain really quick. And let's see how we're actually positioned. We're about equal on calls to puts total open interest. Let's take a look at OI. Obviously that captures earnings, which would be 22. And we can see that we're looking at a million calls against 850,000 puts. So definitely callsque, meaningful callsque. The reason why I call this meaningful callsque is in big companies like this. A lot of people typically hold tons and tons of shares. So a lot of people will actually come in and hedge on the put side, even though they're not necessarily thinking that they're playing it directionally to the downside. A lot of times what you see over here is to offset long options. So when you see instances like this where the calls still overwhelm the put side, even from that structural perspective, that generally is quite bullish. Now distribution of strikes is kind of what you would expect to see. A lot of it is at the money out of the money stuff, like just slightly out of the money. There's some super far out of the money stuff in a quick reminder. Just when you see there's really far out of the money options, it doesn't necessarily mean anybody thinks it's going to 250 per say. It just means that they're expecting it to go up. And as long as it goes up enough following earnings, then these can show a profit. So that's the play here for these people. Now last thing I want to look at is volatility. So let's take a look at the wall surface. And you can see that the put side is actually trading more richly in terms of vault and the call side. Now this is a more standard structure than what you'll see in things that are like hyper hyper bullish. It was funny because I was actually watching CNBC and there was a woman on there talking about her expectation of call skew, which I honestly was expecting to see here. But I don't see it as it sits right now. Right now it looks like the market is still pricing up the downside a little bit more. And again, this doesn't mean that the market is necessarily expecting downside. You generally would expect to see put skew like this. And it's because people are buying puts to hedge to the downside. People who are selling puts coming into this thing demand a premium to do that. Now when you see stuff that has really massive call skew on the tails where the IV is higher than the put side, that's generally leading us towards a expectation of a upside move. Again, it doesn't mean that you're going to get it. But it means that you're paying a premium to play it to the upside. In this case, it has a much normal, normal relationship. Let's take a quick look at 20Ds, just kind of the next primary expiration, same same. And then I just want to take a look at OI or this as well. And huge call skew. Now just to show you what I did, I'm looking, I looked at the 22 no first. The reason why I look at the 22 no first is because the people that are in 22 no over purposefully exposing themselves to earnings. They're trying to play earnings. Whereas people that are in 20Ds still might be trying to play earnings. But a lot of times you'll find bigger positions out here in the primary explorations because they're going to be more liquid. Also, if you're trading something like this directionally, going a little further out in time doesn't bother you as long as you're gaining deltas because as long as you get your move in your favor, you're not actually going to experience the same contraction and imply volatility immediately following the release. So this overall looks pretty well positioned for like a bullish expectation. Now the way that I look at playing something like this is again, if you want to play to the upside, you have to be careful because you never know when the script changes and you walk into something like this. But in general, the downside definitely looks a little bit more muted compared to the upside gap potential that we've seen a few times more recently. So I think longer term position should be held based on how you feel about the company longer term. I had longer term options that I took down actually to let it go through earnings. I might play earnings itself. I have to see how options look tomorrow. And then I'll lay the longer term stuff back out depending on how it performs. But right now Nvidia is still really well positioned super strong. So as always, anything you want me to take a look at? Let me know. Be an outlier. I'll see you later.
