0.00s: What's up, allies? Quick market update because Nvidia, you know, essentially the whole stock
5.04s: market rests on Nvidia's shoulders right now has earnings tomorrow, the 20th after the
10.24s: close. So I want to walk through what I'm seeing in terms of the options as relating into
15.32s: it. Actually, I had a position on in here that I recently adjusted, not just because of
20.32s: earnings, but some of it due to what I'm going to walk you through. So what's going on
25.68s: here? Well, if we just poke through really quick, we can see Nvidia is hovering near six
31.32s: month highs. If we take it out to a year, it's essentially sitting at one year highs,
35.76s: five year highs, all time highs. You kind of get the the gesture where we're just hovering
40.60s: at highs. So the reason why this matters is because as we go through what the market looks
46.96s: like it might be expecting from Nvidia for earnings, it really depends on how you feel
53.16s: about playing something like this. The premise of what I'm saying here is Nvidia has traditionally
60.16s: done very well. And if we go through its prior earnings, I'll show you what I mean by this.
65.28s: If we look at its past four quarters of earnings, you can see a pretty clear trend that it's
72.60s: positive surprises all around. Now, one thing I want to note for you is notice the severity
80.32s: of the surprise, right? So looking at the quarter ending 1023, that was a 26.7%. Then
86.96s: one 24 was 16.7%. Then four 24 13.7%. Seven 24, eight point three percent. The main thing
96.24s: I'm highlighting is although Nvidia is still unequivocally crushing it, this is narrowing
102.96s: pretty tightly. And that's not to suggest that it might miss on this next earnings. That's
108.04s: the nature of earnings. Nobody knows what's going to happen. You can position for it directionally
112.28s: if you're so inclined. If you haven't underlying idea about how it might behave, but regardless
118.56s: of what you think about that, you can clearly see that the surprises definitely are narrowing
124.52s: out here, even though we still are hovering near all time. So let's take a look now at Nvidia
131.84s: itself. And I want to zoom us into a six month and show you a couple things. The first thing
138.40s: is if we just loosely eyeball volatility, we can absolutely see this starting to expand
148.72s: pretty significantly, right? And this is both seven day vol and 30 day vol. This is very normal
154.64s: leading into an earnings release. Nothing stands out to me there other than the fact that we're
158.72s: seeing a normal price behavior coming into earnings. Now we did have a really big day today.
164.16s: It was almost 5% up move. And there's a bunch of news wrapped around it. I don't want to get stuck
170.96s: in the news. I want to focus more on what it's actually functionally looking like around earnings.
175.68s: So let's look at its past earnings. This is going back to Q323. And obviously you can see Q325
184.16s: all the way up here. And I want to talk about the behavior that we see leading into earnings.
190.64s: Down at the bottom here, you can see the actual EPS and then the expected EPS, right? So it continues
197.60s: to outperform. I think we've seen that pretty consistently. Now if we take a look at the immediate
203.68s: price movement post earnings release, it tends to gap to the upside. Right? So we can see that in
210.88s: this occurrence, this occurrence, this occurrence, this occurrence. So that obviously does not mean
218.32s: it is going to gap anywhere because we can also see in several occurrences is actually trended to
223.12s: the downside. It trended down here. It trended down here. It still went up but still had a
229.92s: down day following. So this is kind of like an inside move. And then it trended down here.
234.80s: So after three of these instances, it clearly trended down. It's almost a mixed bag, right?
241.36s: And that's what earnings should be. Now what I can tell you though from a positioning standpoint,
245.76s: the ability to capitalize on a gap in this instance from 2075 to 23 from here it went from 305 to
254.16s: 370. And then from here it went from 674 to 785. From here it went from 949 to 1037. What I'm
261.52s: highlighting is that these are much bigger moves than the down moves that it shows. So there's some
267.44s: opportunity in that context because if you want to place something like this to the upside, you almost
273.28s: have a slightly lower risk trade to the downside. Again, this can blow out at any point and become a
280.48s: massive downside move. But based on the recent earnings history that we can see, the upside tends
286.96s: to be via gapping of some capacity and the downside seems to be more so from downside drift.
293.20s: So that is what it is. Now in terms of selling volatility into this earnings, it looks really ugly.
300.16s: And what I mean by that is if you take a look at imply volatility, which is like the orange,
304.72s: and then historical volatility, which is the yellow, if you're selling volatility into earnings,
309.60s: what you want to see is the orange line remain above the yellow line after earnings. That means that
316.56s: implied volatility was estimated much higher than the realized move. A good example of that is right
321.12s: here. You can see that leading into earnings implied volatility was at 49 and change following
327.52s: earnings at crater to 37. So nice big IV contraction. And then the realized move was within tolerance.
334.72s: It was with with bounds. So this would be a profitable something like a short-striple for Strangle
339.68s: for the earnings release itself. So this now leads to some ideas. If you have a really strong
347.12s: bullish thesis in Nvidia, then again, you can kind of play this propensity for gapping to the upside.
354.96s: And then even the follow on drift, which Pied is what it's called post earnings announcement drift
360.88s: is a thing. There's certain conditions that have to be met or to exist. But let's take a look at this,
366.56s: for example, here earnings were expected at $5.14. It came in at 612 really big, really big B.
374.64s: Then we can see that there is clearly a strong gap following earnings that generally leads to
381.28s: drift over the following quarter. So now this, the interesting part about the drift that you
387.20s: experienced here did go through that August dip. But before the August dip that was seen across
392.64s: the whole market, it was up and off to the races. And same thing similar here. The main note I'm
398.24s: making is that stuff like post earnings announcement drift definitely is a little bit weaker in super,
403.68s: super, super big market companies like Nvidia. But if it has a good enough earnings release,
408.64s: it doesn't matter. It can still exhibit it, which it has here. It has here. This was a little
413.76s: bit different. It didn't have the correct conditions. And this is one of the instances where it actually
417.76s: contracted post earnings. So now for the upcoming earnings release, we have some conjecture around
425.28s: how aggressive the expectations have become and what that subsequently might mean for the
432.32s: performance of Nvidia. Because sooner or later, the analysts projecting what EPS might look like,
439.04s: they can get a little too aggressive, which even though the growth might look really good,
443.92s: if it still doesn't top expectations, that's problematic. And it typically leads to the market not
451.04s: really digging the movements. So let's take a look at the options chain really quick. And let's see
456.56s: how we're actually positioned. We're about equal on calls to puts total open interest. Let's take a
462.88s: look at OI. Obviously that captures earnings, which would be 22. And we can see that we're looking
469.12s: at a million calls against 850,000 puts. So definitely callsque, meaningful callsque. The reason
475.84s: why I call this meaningful callsque is in big companies like this. A lot of people typically hold
480.16s: tons and tons of shares. So a lot of people will actually come in and hedge on the put side,
485.20s: even though they're not necessarily thinking that they're playing it directionally to the downside.
490.08s: A lot of times what you see over here is to offset long options. So when you see instances like
496.08s: this where the calls still overwhelm the put side, even from that structural perspective,
502.00s: that generally is quite bullish. Now distribution of strikes is kind of what you would expect to see.
507.68s: A lot of it is at the money out of the money stuff, like just slightly out of the money. There's
511.52s: some super far out of the money stuff in a quick reminder. Just when you see there's really far out
515.76s: of the money options, it doesn't necessarily mean anybody thinks it's going to 250 per say.
520.80s: It just means that they're expecting it to go up. And as long as it goes up enough
524.88s: following earnings, then these can show a profit. So that's the play here for these people.
530.32s: Now last thing I want to look at is volatility. So let's take a look at the wall surface.
536.40s: And you can see that the put side is actually trading more richly in terms of
541.28s: vault and the call side. Now this is a more standard structure than what you'll see in things that
547.12s: are like hyper hyper bullish. It was funny because I was actually watching CNBC and there was a
551.60s: woman on there talking about her expectation of call skew, which I honestly was expecting to see
556.24s: here. But I don't see it as it sits right now. Right now it looks like the market is still
562.00s: pricing up the downside a little bit more. And again, this doesn't mean that the market is
565.68s: necessarily expecting downside. You generally would expect to see put skew like this. And it's
571.12s: because people are buying puts to hedge to the downside. People who are selling puts coming into
576.16s: this thing demand a premium to do that. Now when you see stuff that has really massive call skew
582.40s: on the tails where the IV is higher than the put side, that's generally leading us towards a
589.60s: expectation of a upside move. Again, it doesn't mean that you're going to get it. But it means that
593.12s: you're paying a premium to play it to the upside. In this case, it has a much normal, normal relationship.
599.20s: Let's take a quick look at 20Ds, just kind of the next primary expiration, same same. And then
604.96s: I just want to take a look at OI or this as well. And huge call skew. Now just to show you what I
614.00s: did, I'm looking, I looked at the 22 no first. The reason why I look at the 22 no first is because
619.68s: the people that are in 22 no over purposefully exposing themselves to earnings. They're trying to
624.32s: play earnings. Whereas people that are in 20Ds still might be trying to play earnings. But a lot
629.20s: of times you'll find bigger positions out here in the primary explorations because they're going to
633.68s: be more liquid. Also, if you're trading something like this directionally, going a little further
639.20s: out in time doesn't bother you as long as you're gaining deltas because as long as you get your move
643.44s: in your favor, you're not actually going to experience the same contraction and imply volatility
648.00s: immediately following the release. So this overall looks pretty well positioned for
654.08s: like a bullish expectation. Now the way that I look at playing something like this is again,
659.52s: if you want to play to the upside, you have to be careful because you never know when the
663.28s: script changes and you walk into something like this. But in general, the downside definitely looks
667.68s: a little bit more muted compared to the upside gap potential that we've seen a few times more recently.
673.92s: So I think longer term position should be held based on how you feel about the company longer term.
681.84s: I had longer term options that I took down actually to let it go through earnings. I might play
687.60s: earnings itself. I have to see how options look tomorrow. And then I'll lay the longer term stuff
693.28s: back out depending on how it performs. But right now Nvidia is still really well positioned
698.16s: super strong. So as always, anything you want me to take a look at? Let me know. Be an outlier.
701.84s: I'll see you later.
