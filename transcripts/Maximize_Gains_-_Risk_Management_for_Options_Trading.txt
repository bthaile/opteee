0.12s: send a tradeoff and then figure out what
2.36s: you're going to do about it later right
4.24s: that sounds about right for most of us
6.36s: and if you're anything like me when I
8.40s: first started trading back in 2007 I was
10.76s: in high school and I was a super patient
13.40s: young man obviously not the case so the
16.32s: goal of this video is actually to walk
17.80s: you through risk management and options
20.44s: trading specifically what I wish I knew
23.12s: 16 years ago what's up everybody Eric
25.04s: here welcome back to the outliers shout
26.64s: out to the patreon let's get straight
29.32s: into it so what's the purpose of this
32.84s: topic it's kind of straightforward but
34.84s: it's so that you don't end up like this
37.56s: person which I can't really pronounce
39.92s: their name but this is actually from the
41.56s: options subreddit they lost
45.72s: $167,000 then we got this person from
48.40s: Wall Street bets Who's down
51.12s: 98.81% got this person who's essentially
55.44s: asking uh subreddit if they should wheel
58.16s: this thing with 550 bucks we got this
60.60s: person who lost $650,000 on short calls
64.56s: it looks like maybe long calls yeah it
66.96s: looks like long calls who knows at this
68.68s: point then we have another one from Wall
71.04s: Street bets where we are down actually a
74.84s: impressive
76.52s: 101% kind of good for them really
78.68s: overachieving here what I'm highlighting
81.00s: is this is what most people do it is a
83.68s: fact of the trade that most people that
86.80s: get into trading start off half cocked I
89.96s: did and unfortunately for these people
92.68s: they obviously had some gambling issues
95.76s: and sizing issues which we'll talk about
98.04s: all of those throughout this video but
100.24s: specifically at the end of the video I
101.88s: want to outline five steps to manage
105.68s: risk better that's it but before we get
108.28s: to that I'm going to lay a foundation
110.00s: for you on why this stuff matters talk
111.56s: to you about some cognitive biases give
113.28s: you my risk hierarchy how I view it and
116.60s: then my approach to risk management and
118.52s: then also you know quick shout out if
120.60s: you're going to post a screenshot at
121.68s: least have some battery power you
123.52s: Heathen they're less than 50% that's
125.52s: just kind of
127.52s: unacceptable okay so now that we know
130.48s: kind of the risk of trading options and
134.16s: what realistically happens to the
135.92s: majority of people we need to Define
139.36s: what our individual purposes Beyond
142.72s: avoiding this fate for me it was to
146.16s: enable long-term compounding that's what
148.32s: I cared about and I've shared my St a
150.08s: bunch of times I'm not going to bore you
151.36s: with it in this video what I want to
153.60s: draw your attention to are the different
155.68s: ways we can make money in the market so
158.16s: you'll notice that as we go further down
160.80s: on our account draw Downs the larger the
164.28s: return required is in order to get back
166.48s: to break even so in this case if you
168.12s: draw down 40% in order to get back to
170.60s: break even you have to see an
172.20s: appreciation of
174.08s: 66.7% that's not making any money that's
176.36s: getting just back to break even so what
179.08s: I want to draw your attention to
180.60s: specifically are these different
182.12s: portfolios because you notice that
183.72s: portfolio 3 actually has a better return
186.08s: a better average return of 8.6% but
188.72s: notice how the compound annual growth
190.64s: rate is
192.16s: 6.87% compared to portfolio 1 that has a
196.44s: lower average return of
199.08s: 1.2% at
200.96s: 7.4% yet they have a better compound in
203.52s: your growth rate how is that because
205.52s: they're not experiencing as much whipsaw
208.60s: in their return profile so for me this
211.36s: is what I focused on and over the life
214.00s: cycle of my trading I've evolved what my
216.64s: purpose was however what always stuck
220.24s: with me is limiting the draw down on my
223.28s: account and that's actually led to me
225.28s: only posting two negative years and that
227.80s: was my first two years of trading in the
230.60s: beginning I was just really risk averse
233.12s: however what I started to realize as I
235.20s: was creating what I call my millionaire
236.88s: road map what I was trying to accomplish
239.12s: I noticed that even by having more
241.56s: conservative Topline returns by limiting
244.84s: my draw Downs I was actually
247.16s: accelerating my compound growth Target
250.24s: and rate massively so that's exactly why
254.76s: this was my purpose you have to Define
256.68s: yours and I encourage you to do that
258.44s: when you think about your approach to
259.84s: managing risk in trading not just
262.24s: options it can't just be I don't want to
264.32s: blow up if it's something so nebulous it
266.84s: doesn't mean anything I would quantify
269.12s: it very specifically I do not want to
271.92s: have a greater than 30% draw down on my
275.32s: total portfolio whatever it is for you
277.60s: that makes sense you have to go through
279.32s: this process because if you just say the
281.48s: easy answer of oh I'm just going to
282.88s: limit draw Downs or oh I just want less
284.48s: portfolio variance yeah it's sounds good
286.84s: but unless you start getting specific
288.52s: with it it's you're just saying things
290.76s: that sound good that's it doesn't get us
293.28s: anywhere so now let's set a foundation
296.12s: there are two kinds of risk you have to
298.08s: be aware of there's systemic an
316.96s: unsystematically this is like the bubble
319.96s: that we saw in 20072 2008 when the
322.68s: housing market collapsed and that
324.64s: impacted just about everything on the
326.64s: stock market that kind of thing
329.84s: you it's you the trader it's what you
332.40s: inject into the system and what you do
335.68s: to yourself via things like
338.28s: irresponsible position sizing because
340.32s: we're greedy or having things that
342.80s: represent the same directional risk
344.80s: Without Really knowing it or having
346.92s: products that move the same or by
349.96s: placing a bunch of Trades before Big
351.88s: Daddy japal is coming out to dropped a
354.28s: hammer on everybody's hopes that the FED
356.16s: rates are not getting cut anytime soon
358.64s: these are risks sources that you the
361.40s: trader inject so now what I want to talk
364.20s: to you a little bit about is the
366.12s: psychology of risk the reason why this
368.44s: matters and I'll try to keep it quick
369.80s: because there's a lot to go through here
371.68s: but this is the underpinning of what
373.88s: people do and as I frequently tell you
376.08s: all you shouldn't take my word for it
377.48s: you should look things up and there are
380.20s: tons of studies on this and if you're in
381.52s: the patreon you have access to all of
383.40s: these I bundled them for you so it's
385.80s: convenient to download Allin one spot on
387.84s: the patreon shop you can just grab all
389.72s: these at once but I'm going to tap into
392.28s: a handful of these psychological risk
394.68s: factors that I would deem to be the
397.92s: largest contributors to people
400.08s: struggling in trading the first one is
402.88s: good times analysis what I mean by this
405.32s: is we have a habit where we think about
408.84s: the ideal scenario so if you're putting
410.92s: on a trade most Traders were thinking
412.56s: about the profit that they're going to
414.56s: take as compared to what it could look
417.00s: like if it doesn't go our way
420.12s: big problem the other thing is when
422.20s: we're looking at our performance there
425.88s: tends to be a dissonance between what we
429.00s: think we did and how well that performed
431.32s: compared to what actually happened and
433.56s: how it actually performed that's why
435.68s: it's really important to keep a trade
437.16s: log and even a trade Journal if you're
439.48s: so inclined I don't really have one I
440.96s: integrate some of that into my log so
443.00s: that I can keep myself honest because
444.48s: it's so easy to have false Recollections
447.20s: because we're trying to cope if we don't
450.16s: really appreciate how massive the ego is
453.84s: in this process I can't overemphasize it
456.64s: because when you think about our role as
459.32s: a Trader it's just you versus you
460.88s: there's nobody else to look at what
462.44s: you're doing or analyze if what you're
463.92s: doing makes sense or not and a lot of us
466.40s: over time especially as you start to get
469.32s: good at trading you run into a few
471.80s: problems one of them is the good old
473.72s: Dunning Krueger effect which is actually
475.96s: massively driven by ego it's when we
478.40s: start something and we know that we
480.64s: don't know anything so our confidence is
482.28s: low but our competence is also low cuz
484.56s: we're just starting something then you
486.24s: spend 2 to 3 years really trying super
488.88s: hard you're studying for dozens of hours
491.68s: a week you're putting in the time and
493.72s: effort and now you feel like you've
495.92s: earned your way to knowledge
498.08s: unfortunately this tends to be where we
501.16s: have the largest issue this is where we
503.68s: think we're smarter than the market this
505.28s: is where we become so obsessed with our
507.96s: own ideas and how good our research is
511.32s: that we kind of forget to remind
514.00s: ourselves that the market doesn't care
515.64s: about our ideas the Market's going to do
517.32s: whatever the Market's going to do I
518.76s: don't give a well so what this
520.60s: means is you start to outsmart the
523.40s: market you're putting on positions that
525.24s: they can't lose you're sizing up
527.24s: whatever the case is and then you
529.32s: finally realize risk risk is always
531.84s: realized sooner or later one of the most
534.00s: dangerous things that happens from an
536.28s: ego perspective is if you start trading
538.00s: and you actually win a bunch upfront
540.24s: because then you think you're better
541.12s: than you are and again sooner or later
543.12s: the market will humble you and if you
545.72s: think about the perspective of a Trader
548.36s: we're trying to not trade for a year 5
550.40s: year 10 years 20 years we're trying to
551.92s: trade for a lifetime we're trying to
553.36s: create lifechanging wealth and to
556.88s: sustainably do it over time so thinking
559.32s: about things like our ego the dun and
562.08s: Krueger effect they're massive a couple
564.20s: other things I want to highlight from
565.40s: this list and then you're free to check
566.68s: out whatever you want upfront is the the
569.68s: disposition effect and that's actually
571.80s: from the behavior of individual
573.12s: investors this study here this is the
575.16s: tendency where we like to take winning
577.80s: trades down too fast and let losing
579.80s: trades run this happens for two reasons
582.12s: one from a psychological perspective we
584.68s: like realizing a gain we feel good our
587.68s: ego likes that we're confronted with the
589.96s: outcome that we did a good job we don't
592.20s: like confronting ourselves with the fact
593.96s: that we did something that didn't work
595.60s: well and then this is where we start
597.60s: hoping hoping that it works out
599.72s: typically doesn't the other thing to
601.88s: note about the disposition effect and
604.24s: how it roots in our brains is kind of
607.28s: Primal actually and it's called loss of
609.52s: version and this kind of has Primal
612.44s: rooting where we don't look at the value
616.00s: of a gain or a commensurate loss the
618.60s: same and this happens because once your
621.64s: basic life needs are met the prospect of
624.28s: losing a little bit is problematic
626.36s: because then it can set you below what
628.60s: you need for for basic needs but this
630.68s: also carries over into other markets
632.48s: where you can actually have a better
634.56s: expected return to the outside to the
636.68s: upside versus losing to the downside so
639.84s: what that means is say for example if
641.36s: it's a fair coin flip and you can win
644.00s: one and a half units if it's heads and
647.00s: you lose one unit or one and a quarter
649.48s: units if it's Tails people don't wait
652.84s: those outcomes appropriately whereas
655.24s: that has positive expected return but
658.12s: people become too risk averse and if you
660.68s: offered them the ability to just take a
663.00s: dollar up front even though that system
665.00s: would potentially make them more they
667.44s: wouldn't take that trade so that's loss
669.76s: aversion now a couple other things
672.20s: effort Gap is a big one with respect to
674.24s: trading and this is where Traders feel
676.12s: like because they put in a ton of effort
677.96s: that they deserve something that the
679.24s: market owes them to be right that the
681.76s: you know because they've spent hundreds
683.32s: of hours they should be performing well
686.04s: because of all that effort doesn't
687.56s: matter literally doesn't matter you can
689.00s: spend a lot of time doing this stuff and
690.96s: it still might not be the right fit for
692.56s: you it is what it is the other thing I
694.96s: want to highlight here specifically is
697.72s: the skill Gap this is where you look at
700.40s: people that are doing things really well
702.92s: and you don't fully understand how much
705.32s: is going into making that happen I
707.28s: typically use the example of Surfing or
709.24s: Jiu-Jitsu people who are good at both of
711.28s: those make it look effortless but
713.52s: there's a ton of time and effort that
715.48s: goes into being successful at either of
717.92s: those it's the same thing in trading and
719.92s: then the last one Traders get way too
722.84s: wrapped up in individual positions as
726.40s: compared to the system that they're
728.96s: attempting to interface with so what
730.84s: this means is sometimes you put on an
733.32s: individual trade and you are just so
736.00s: focused on how that one trade does so
738.00s: you're breaking your rules you're making
739.76s: exceptions because you think you can
741.36s: make this one trade work but you forget
744.28s: that this is a really long-term
745.96s: iterative process and you're building a
747.64s: bunch of bad habits so before we move on
750.56s: now to the risk hierarchy in the
752.12s: comments below let me know what you
753.68s: would add to this list cuz there's way
755.60s: more than just this and that's kind of a
758.40s: scary Prospect but it is the truth there
760.92s: is way more that goes into the
763.16s: psychology of risk for Traders okay this
766.96s: is how I think about risk in the markets
769.56s: it starts from a broad perspective and
771.52s: then we zoom in further and further and
773.00s: further so we start with the market then
775.12s: we look at our portfolio risk then we
777.12s: look at individual strategy right risk
779.64s: and then position so this actually gets
782.40s: pretty straightforward and I'm going to
784.32s: give you a handful of questions or
786.88s: considerations for each of these to then
789.60s: integrate into your thought process with
792.64s: respect to risk and trading so the first
794.84s: one when we think about the market I
796.68s: typically take a broad view so I'm going
798.72s: to conduct a broad market analysis look
801.00s: at things like net highs and lows moving
802.76s: averages just to get a sense of how the
804.60s: market is trending I'm also going to see
806.76s: how earnings for the last quarter have
808.52s: been see if there's any big economic
810.72s: events coming out or that the market is
812.68s: particularly sensitive to a good example
814.48s: of that right now is the rate
815.92s: environment Market's hyper sensitive to
817.80s: that as of this moment whereas back in
821.36s: 2013 yeah not so much because it wasn't
823.72s: so topical then and also how volatile
825.96s: things are the reason why I look at all
827.92s: of this before I even start thinking
829.84s: about the risk of positions is because
831.88s: this informs how I structure my risk
835.80s: later on so for example if I'm trading
838.48s: earnings plays and the earnings so far
841.80s: has been all over the place that's going
844.36s: to inform what strategies I might use
847.72s: and how I'm going to set those
849.36s: strategies up so this is laying a
851.40s: foundation for further decision then we
853.76s: look at the portfolio so from a
855.44s: portfolio level when I'm first deciding
858.32s: how I conceive of risk I think about Max
861.80s: draw down for the portfolio that's super
864.08s: important and this is where you
865.24s: determine what is the maximum allowable
868.04s: Capital draw down you will accept in
870.32s: your portfolio before you deploy circuit
872.44s: breakers and circuit breakers are
874.36s: literally when you start liquidating
875.84s: positions even if it might not make
877.72s: sense to make sure that you're not
879.48s: missing something that there's not some
880.88s: sort of fundamental shift that happened
882.88s: that you might not be aware of whatever
884.76s: the case is so that you do not start
886.84s: bleeding Capital way more than you
888.80s: should because even if something goes
891.12s: down let's say 30% you exit and then it
894.28s: starts to rebound that might work in
897.20s: that one scenario but there can be
899.08s: another scenario where it goes down to
900.80s: 30% draw down and then you say oh I've
903.20s: been here before it's fine and then it
904.60s: goes down to 60% draw down and again
907.20s: this has to be personalized to you as a
909.04s: Trader some Traders really like to focus
911.76s: their risk into small buckets and accept
914.60s: much higher portfolio variant so maybe
916.84s: your Max draw down on your portfolio is
918.48s: a bigger metric because you expect much
920.20s: bigger winners when they come but it has
922.12s: to make sense for you for me I break out
925.08s: my portfolio into core and speculative
927.60s: allocations I'll throw a video in the
929.32s: notes below that walks through how I do
931.24s: that and how I allocate Capital to both
933.08s: of them but that's a massive part of how
935.32s: I manage risk in the portfolio r large
939.00s: I'm also going to use things like beta
940.36s: weighted Deltas to see how my portfolio
942.60s: looks at a given point in time again I
944.60s: have a video on that I'll throw in the
946.32s: notes below and the whole point behind
948.48s: this is to make sure that I'm
950.08s: understanding the disposition of all of
951.56s: my positions in one common language now
954.04s: going back to Capital in the portfolio
956.76s: one of the things I think people foro
959.04s: thinking about is margin expansion so
961.52s: when you put on an options trade and
963.32s: let's say you're putting on a
964.28s: hypothetical short position in Hood
966.08s: because you hate Hood as much as I do
967.72s: and no matter how good it's doing or how
969.52s: good it looks to the upside none of that
971.04s: matters we should still always fade Hood
972.96s: because well we hate hood and you sell a
976.24s: call when you first put that position on
978.12s: your broker is going to require a
979.44s: certain amount of money and that margin
981.28s: requirement in this case is something
983.16s: like 1,000 bucks however if the
985.60s: underlying starts moving against you and
988.24s: let's say it goes goes up one standard
989.88s: deviation your margin requirement is now
991.40s: 1,700 bucks and let's say it goes up two
993.68s: standard deviations now it's 2,600 bucks
995.60s: and if it goes up three standard
996.64s: deviations now it's up 3,900 bucks
999.16s: margin moves so if you're trading using
1002.28s: options that's great you're gaining
1004.24s: effective leverage and being more
1005.68s: Capital efficient however you have to be
1007.44s: mindful of how margin will move
1009.12s: throughout the life cycle of a position
1010.76s: again you can't have goldilock scenario
1013.76s: analysis where you're just thinking
1015.12s: about things when they go well so for me
1017.80s: I would absolutely consider something
1019.84s: like a three standard deviation move
1021.80s: against me to understand what it might
1023.80s: look like it's insanely improbable but
1025.88s: they do happen and that's the way that
1028.16s: my brain thinks about managing risk so
1030.08s: that I don't get caught the other things
1031.76s: I'm going to look at in the portfolio
1033.24s: are the correlation between products to
1034.96s: make sure that I'm not putting on five
1036.72s: different positions that really all
1038.12s: behave like the same one without knowing
1039.88s: it I'm also going to take a look at what
1041.80s: days to expirations I have for all my
1043.56s: different positions what needs to be
1045.00s: managed because of time based reasons am
1047.48s: I at risk of early assignment do I have
1050.52s: positions that I want to roll because
1053.20s: they're being challenged all of those
1054.96s: things get baked into this broad
1056.60s: portfolio overview and then I'm also
1059.16s: going to make sure that there's no
1060.24s: specific event risk coming up that
1062.60s: impacts my positions so if you happen to
1065.24s: have a position on in technology and
1067.04s: Nvidia has earnings coming out
1069.12s: especially with the market as it is
1070.80s: today that's a consideration to have
1072.64s: that you should be aware of so the
1074.32s: portfolio I'm literally just looking at
1076.64s: these broad buckets there's quite a bit
1078.52s: more that I personally would look at but
1080.92s: I think this is a Fine Place to Start
1083.00s: now let's get into the individual
1084.44s: strategies here this is when we need to
1087.16s: determine what risk management protocols
1089.56s: make sense for the strategy that we're
1091.00s: using so in this case we can't just take
1093.88s: a guess there's no way that you could
1095.84s: just say I'm going to do blank and it
1098.04s: make any sense or it be something that
1100.24s: you would follow because you don't trust
1102.20s: it why would you so for me this is where
1105.24s: I go through the process of back testing
1107.20s: forward testing cutting the tails and
1109.84s: then developing strategy specific risk
1112.56s: management rules I have a video down
1115.04s: below that goes into this idea of
1117.76s: cutting the Tails and I have another
1119.52s: video that goes through how to build a
1121.20s: strategy the cliffnotes version of this
1124.28s: is that we really need to make sure that
1126.36s: we're keeping expected return in mind so
1130.44s: for example if I'm trading a strategy
1133.56s: and I have the possibility to make two
1135.88s: units and I'm risking four units to make
1138.56s: those two units depending on the
1140.36s: probabilistic outcome of those scenarios
1142.04s: it may or may not make sense what's
1144.20s: important here is to figure out what
1146.48s: that looks like for your individual
1148.12s: strategy to then make decisions so again
1150.92s: for example for me if I'm trading things
1153.20s: that are more speculative in nature I
1156.12s: typically will give them less room to
1158.48s: move expecting to be wrong more often so
1162.24s: I'll have a lower average loss amount
1165.52s: but a higher loss frequency it's a way
1168.76s: way for me to manage trades and then I
1171.36s: layer in scaling on top of that so for
1174.04s: example if I'm entering a breakout trade
1176.68s: that I want to go to the upside and I
1180.00s: pretty speculative in nature I will find
1182.52s: a stop that makes sense for the strategy
1185.32s: because if I'm trading a breakout kind
1187.32s: of trade it doesn't make sense to use
1189.92s: profit or Loss Management that's
1191.72s: predicated on random numbers if I lose
1194.52s: two times the credit I receive then this
1196.60s: is no longer good for me if it's a trend
1199.72s: following strategy it doesn't make sense
1201.96s: because I'm trading the chart I'm
1203.36s: trading the price action so what I'm
1205.36s: going to do in those kinds of scenarios
1207.32s: is look to create a reference so if I
1209.08s: sold that call in Robin Hood which as
1211.16s: much as it pains me to say right now I
1213.00s: probably wouldn't do cuz it's showing
1214.16s: some strength and you have to go all the
1215.68s: way out to 3 years to find the near-term
1218.32s: resistance but it's still here it's
1220.44s: somewhere around this handle we can see
1222.68s: that there's a big stair step down and
1225.40s: this is where I would look to say okay
1228.48s: if I deem near-term resistance for this
1231.24s: short call or whatever strategy it is in
1234.24s: this case going short Hood because I
1236.36s: hate it and then we zoom in and we say
1238.40s: okay so if I want to fade this to the
1240.12s: downside for whatever reason this is
1242.12s: where I'm prospecting short-term
1244.36s: resistance would be if we break above
1246.76s: that what would the loss on my position
1248.92s: be am I okay with that loss as a dollar
1251.88s: amount or percentage of my portfolio and
1254.72s: does this all line up you have to make
1257.32s: sure that whatever you're choosing to
1259.12s: set for your strategy specific risk
1261.92s: management protocols make sense for the
1264.80s: specific strategy in that specific
1266.76s: opportunity but then you have to zoom
1268.56s: out and make sure that it fits into your
1269.96s: portfolio so let's say for example
1272.24s: instead of the risk management occurring
1275.00s: somewhere around 2145 let's say that I
1277.52s: go out again this three years and let's
1279.40s: say that I for whatever reason think
1280.96s: this is where the stop would occur for
1284.40s: me if this makes sense for me to get
1287.36s: stopped out all the way up at
1289.40s: 2841 and if I still really like the
1291.96s: trade but the loss looks like it might
1293.84s: be too big then maybe I scale the size
1296.12s: of the trade down if I look at that loss
1298.24s: and I say Man based on how much money I
1300.96s: think I could make which in this case it
1302.92s: would be the credit received on the long
1304.40s: option but if I think this is where it
1306.56s: might Trend to before it stops me out
1309.76s: then in this scenario I'm in possibly
1312.56s: looking to make a 100 bucks but risking
1314.44s: several thousand it starts to not make
1316.68s: sense so the opport
1319.08s: that your trading has to fit whatever
1322.28s: you've tested for your strategy which
1324.52s: can't be random and one other note here
1327.84s: is that you can go broke taking profits
1330.24s: go back to the disposition effect if you
1332.36s: get into this cycle where you look to
1334.08s: manage your risk too fast taking all
1336.84s: your winners down at tiny little winner
1338.76s: amounts you'd have a really high win
1340.40s: rate but then whenever you eventually
1342.08s: have a really big loss it's going to
1343.60s: wipe out all of your winners and then
1345.72s: you're still negatively expecting so you
1348.64s: have to make sure it makes sense and the
1350.64s: way we do this is by testing back test
1352.96s: forward test cut the tails off then make
1355.92s: sure that you can fit it to the
1357.68s: individual opportunity cool last bit you
1360.44s: know who these two people are comment in
1363.28s: the notes below these are two great
1365.28s: references and I'll get into that in
1366.96s: just a second but here are the five
1368.96s: steps to better risk management the
1370.56s: first one is predetermine your profit
1372.52s: and loss management protocols for every
1374.72s: single trade before you enter that's it
1376.68s: that's one of the easiest things you can
1378.00s: do before you press the button to enter
1379.92s: a trade Define how you're going to
1381.92s: manage it to the upside to the downside
1384.20s: and make sure that it makes sense for
1386.20s: the strategy and the position meaning it
1388.56s: has positive expected return then we
1391.04s: need to make sure that we're tracking
1393.04s: our p&l for the portfolio and trade
1396.04s: levels which your broker will do that
1397.28s: for you but as it goes to different
1400.04s: extremes for your Max draw down you have
1402.48s: to track that because we should get to a
1405.28s: point where based on what you're
1406.52s: attempting to return you can establish C
1408.64s: Breakers so again for me if my portfolio
1410.72s: draws down more than 25% that's a
1412.68s: circuit breaker it means I am cutting
1414.96s: trades to figure out what's going on and
1417.04s: to reduce the draw down further and
1418.84s: again I accept the fact that if it gets
1420.48s: to 25% it might just rebound right back
1422.84s: up that's okay because I'm a process
1426.00s: oriented Trader I know maybe that one
1428.72s: instance that's what happened another
1430.56s: instance it might be another 20072 2008
1433.52s: where the market goes on to drop another
1435.52s: 30% over 2 weeks I'm not going to let
1438.04s: that happen so you have to figure out
1439.84s: what makes sense for you here but the
1441.12s: important part is to think about this
1442.72s: stuff before it's happening because
1444.00s: that's when you're logical and thinking
1445.48s: clearly it's not going to happen when
1447.04s: you're in the middle of a trade then we
1448.72s: already talked about this make sure you
1450.40s: have a logical positively expectant p&l
1453.28s: approach for each strategy I can't
1454.68s: overemphasize that enough I see people
1456.24s: pick random numbers and then they don't
1458.04s: want to follow them because they don't
1459.00s: believe them or they're picking things
1460.84s: that actually don't make sense for what
1462.28s: they're doing we already talked about
1463.92s: these we don't have to hit these again
1465.24s: the last part on this I want to hit
1466.88s: though is the mental analysis dis
1469.16s: again we have a really hard time
1471.04s: objectively evaluating what's going on
1473.08s: because our ego doesn't want to be
1474.92s: confronted we don't want to think that
1476.68s: we're wasting a bunch of time and effort
1478.40s: doing something that's not doing what we
1480.56s: want it to do you have to get all of
1482.80s: that out of your mind and go back to the
1484.76s: process every single decision every
1486.60s: single piece of analysis you're making
1488.08s: feeds back into the process which is
1490.20s: what will help you be successful
1492.00s: longterm short-term pain for long-term
1494.88s: gain the last thing you cannot become to
1498.40s: to risk desensitized or else you might
1501.00s: end up like one of these two guys and
1503.04s: again if you know who they are comment
1504.60s: below but fun fact both of them hyper
1507.80s: successful traders that have made a
1509.64s: bunch of money and then lost all of it
1512.32s: this guy ended up killing himself and I
1514.76s: think he made let me double check yeah
1516.40s: he made over $100 million and this is
1519.84s: back in like the 1930s so think about
1522.64s: how much money that is then this
1525.76s: gentleman over here lost 800 $27 million
1529.88s: for a bank the point being is you can't
1532.08s: get too risk desensitized they're both
1533.84s: successful knocked it out of the park
1535.36s: some of them for a long time and then
1537.20s: they still it up at some point
1538.76s: because they develop a perverse
1540.12s: relationship with risk you're not out of
1542.16s: the woods when you're a successful
1543.68s: Trader it takes time and the last thing
1545.84s: if you're too risk averse you put on
1547.56s: positions too small you take them down
1549.04s: too fast you're not going to make any
1550.64s: money so think about position sizing
1553.00s: typically for me speculative allocation
1555.72s: maybe up to 25% vast majority of the
1558.00s: time 10 to 15% core allocation very
1560.84s: different can go the full portfolio but
1562.60s: typically much larger size because of
1565.16s: the way that I trade that make it make
1567.68s: sense remember draw Downs really hurt
1570.72s: you long term don't let it happen take
1573.32s: the short-term loss sucks but it lets
1576.52s: you start from a better Point going
1578.08s: forward establish all of this ahead of
1580.24s: time if you have any questions let me
1581.76s: know like subscribe share be an outlier
1583.68s: see youall later
