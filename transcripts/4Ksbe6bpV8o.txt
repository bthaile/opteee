0.00s: What's up, outliers? We're further along with the election and now it's time to start figuring out
5.12s: how to further the gains we have already stacked up from the original surge. And I want to talk
11.76s: about a couple different things, specifically some of the primary policies that Trump has talked
17.28s: about, their potential impacts. And then some different time frames to keep in mind for
22.40s: creating positions because the first 90 days is going to be a specific window for us to look at
26.88s: in a certain way. And then really once you start getting out beyond that six months plus,
31.20s: there will be other things that come into play more thematic style positions, which we'll talk about.
35.68s: So let's get right into things. First things first, this is old news. We already know this.
43.44s: Donald Trump already won the electoral votes required for presidency 295 versus 226 not even close.
52.16s: Okay, great. Next up, we have the Senate. So the Senate is definitely sitting firm in the Republican
62.16s: hands over 50, 50 is majority here. So they have 53. And then last, we have the House. And it looks
72.00s: like the potential for a red sweep is very high. And right now the Republicans are at 211 seats
79.84s: against the Dems 199. And today is the seventh of November. So you can see that we're definitely
86.64s: looking at a specific circumstance here. And the reason why this matters is because if Trump
92.16s: has all three branches here, the first two years of his presidency are going to move like lightning
98.48s: fast. And it's because he's going to try to maximize how much he can get through with Republican
104.32s: support in both the House and the Senate, less so the case if there's Democrats on one side of
111.92s: the aisle that tends to slow things down in terms of what can get through and when. So that's the
116.96s: landscape as it as we look at it. Let's talk about policies. We'll start with some domestic policies
123.12s: and then we'll talk more about these international policies. I don't know, fly through these, but
128.00s: these are just a handful of them. There's more. And the main thing I want to note here is that we're
132.72s: still missing a ton of information. We've just heard talking points about most of these, but we
137.84s: haven't actually seen an outline planned yet. We will soon. And that will add a lot of clarity
143.84s: around this. So from a domestic standpoint, we're seeing things like deregulation coming into
149.60s: the conversation, decreased spending from a governmental perspective, trying to decrease the
155.44s: overall deficit that we're in. Trump has talked about actually I find a pretty interesting corporate
161.76s: tax change. So going from 21 to 20%, but the cool part here is he's talking about 15%
169.92s: tax for domestic producers. So you can see that they're really trying to incentivize domestic
176.72s: production of goods. Now, I don't know the details here. I don't know how much domestic production
182.24s: equals domestic production for the tax cut. I doubt it will be full 100%. We'll have to see, but
188.32s: those kinds of details will matter to a degree. We know that renewable energy is definitely
195.28s: less of a focus for him, same thing with climate change. And that means that he's way more open
201.44s: to fossil fuel use and tapping into the oil. He's very vocal about that deportation and immigration
209.20s: is another big issue that he discussed. And there's very likely going to be large deportation.
215.12s: The reason why this matters is because a lot of companies use a legal labor and it's cheaper
223.44s: for everybody. So that's going to impact all different kinds of companies and all different
228.96s: kinds of industries that leverage illegal immigrants for cheaper labor. Now, big pharma is going to
237.04s: come over massive scrutiny. And this is because Trump has talked about granting RFK his dream
247.68s: of being able to take a really hard look at the total health of America. And big pharma is a big
255.84s: part of RFK's focus. So with RFK heading up the public health agencies, I think that we're going
264.32s: to see really clear impacts from that, which we'll talk a little bit about on a heat map.
270.48s: So if you take a look here, this is just on the day. And there's definitely still some lingering
277.92s: issues for pharmaceuticals. So if we grab Johnson and Johnson on this little tiny chart above my
282.16s: head, you'll see that they're falling off a cliff. They're unhappy. So pharmaceuticals, I believe
287.44s: are going to come under fire a little bit. Healthcare provider services, they are a little bit more
293.28s: resilient. Same thing with biotech and life sciences. They were not quite as impacted. But
299.20s: pharmaceuticals was really the main thing I highlighted after the election win. So this is
305.44s: something to keep in mind, defense spending and space force defense spending is kind of domestic
310.72s: and international in its nature. But the way that this pans out is going to be also really heavily
316.56s: influenced by the international policy in Ukraine, Russia, and then with Israel and Hamas.
322.16s: Depending on how those conflicts go, which we're spending tens of billions of dollars supporting
326.56s: right now, that will likely impact defense spending. But I don't see overall defense spending
332.00s: domestically actually slowing down. I think that Trump is advocating for peace through strength.
339.76s: So that means that he's also likely going to invest heavily into something like the space force,
344.56s: which is still in its infancy. One of my buddies actually just did an interest service transfer
348.72s: from the Marine Corps over to the space force, which is kind of cool. It's wild that it's called
352.72s: the space force. It sounds like something out of like a comedy movie, but it is that.
358.72s: We also have some conversation around tech regulation, which I find really interesting.
364.32s: And you can see this is an article from Wired. And I'll just highlight this one section here.
368.64s: It says Trump has shown to stay in for big tech companies. And he's been vocal about pursuing policies
373.44s: that increase the cost of doing business for them and subject them to more unfavorable regulations.
379.20s: And it seems like this is something that he's talked about even going as far as discussing
383.92s: Google. So there's a real potential impact here, which we'll talk about. Then we also have the
391.12s: injection of crypto regulation, kind of the furthering of bringing cryptocurrency into the
396.96s: folder is even a movement now around the central bank digital currency and what that could look like.
405.44s: So crypto markets have reacted very favorably to the Trump election. So if we take a look really
413.28s: quick and we run over instead of Johnson and Johnson, which I just showed you was falling off a cliff.
418.24s: But if we actually take a look at cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is hitting all time highs here. So very
426.00s: much in favor of the recent change. And now from an international perspective, we already touched
431.92s: on these two conflicts, but then there's also the China tariff. The way that this rolls out is
437.60s: going to be really important because this is actually quite inflationary. And that's one of the
442.16s: big things that Trump is going to have to contest with as he goes through this is that a lot of the
447.44s: stuff that he wants to do is wrapped around growth, which is going to be inflationary by its nature.
453.20s: But we're still in pretty high inflationary environment. The Fed just cut rates and their
458.40s: future rate cutting roadmap actually slowed down a lot after Trump won the election. So it looks
466.56s: like the way that this might roll out would probably be phased over time because if this is like
472.64s: an overnight short term thing, that would cause absolutely catastrophic shock to the system.
479.04s: And pretty much lots of different entities from consumer staples and more specifically consumer
485.04s: discretionary are going to get crushed. So think of things like Walmart's targets, those kinds of
490.08s: places that essentially exist off of Chinese goods. That's going to be really difficult. And then we
495.92s: also have the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. So they're he's talking about renegotiating specifically
503.60s: the the automobile section of that agreement to be slightly more favorable to the US.
508.40s: All right, so that's a bunch of things. This is not holistic, but these are some of the primary
512.40s: things that I'm looking at. So now if we take a look quickly at something else, I want to show you
520.88s: how various sectors are doing right now. So this is using a five one month and three month chart.
528.96s: And the way that these move is really important. So let me show you, for example,
534.24s: if we take a look at what's not in favor, utilities, if you go out three months, utilities was
541.12s: up over 6% a month ago is down to and now it's down 2.83. So definitely slowing down here.
547.84s: Then if you take a look at some of the other things that are likely to struggle a little bit,
552.56s: staples, because if inflation remains high, the cost of getting the things you need is going to be
558.24s: expensive. So no shock here real estate similar thing with rates and the 30 year moving up as far
565.12s: as it did. It's up almost to 7% now again in anticipation of the rate environment remaining
571.44s: about the same. And stuff like financials is about is happy as it could be. And same thing with
578.72s: information technology, this is a little bit of a mixed bag in my opinion, because if we take a
584.40s: look at the tech sector, so if we go in here and take a look at the heat map and specifically look
592.24s: at information technology, you can see that across the board, they're actually responding really,
598.32s: really favorably. So this to me indicates that some of the conversation points around Trump
604.80s: discussing regulation of these larger entities seems to be a little bit more siloed. Now something
611.36s: like that Chinese tariff would be a massive influence for something like Apple, but Apple so far
619.04s: is still generally happy. So I'm not so sure how serious to take the risk here because Apple
626.56s: isn't taking it that seriously, but something to keep an eye on. Now the last thing I want to talk
631.28s: about are just ways to think about trading these different time frames. And if we break out these
638.80s: different elements into 90 day time frames, which I would consider to be more appropriate for
643.20s: momentum style trading, and then six months plus further than that even is more thematic. So this
649.04s: is where we're trying to front run some of the policy statements. So if we just essentially use
656.40s: the yellow boxes for momentum and then anything that's not would fall onto the thematic category,
661.20s: we can see things like deregulation is already having a massive impact. So if we go to something
667.04s: like XLF, you can see it literally jumped. It gapped up from 46 and change and it opened up at 49
675.84s: on the sixth. So deregulation is absolutely going to massively impact the financial sector.
681.36s: And it's going to drive their profitability writ large. Now the decreased renewal emphasis,
687.52s: we can see that being represented in stuff like oil and gas starting to gain a little bit of
694.56s: strength here. So if we go into this tab here and then we go into energy, this is a little bit of
702.08s: a down tick on the day today. But if we take a look at some of the producers like KMI,
708.48s: they're doing really well. Exxon mobile is interesting because a lot of oil producers have been
714.40s: struggling relatively recently. But based on the recent outcome from the election, they seem to be
722.72s: doing a little bit better here, right? So again, it's not doing well. It's still in this downtrend.
727.52s: But if we take a look at the response on the six, it was a gap up from here. So I think oil and gas
733.60s: are going to enjoy a bit of this momentum and stuff that's really wrapped more around renewable
739.44s: things that are in solar wind, probably not as in vogue. Then we have big farmer where we talked
746.64s: about that. The defense spending and space force, this one's a little early to tell, but this is
751.44s: where we can look at stuff like Lockheed Martin. And you can see that on the six, they got a bit
758.24s: of a bounce, but still they really fell off a cliff. You're post earnings. So that's a little bit of
762.96s: an influence going on there. If we take a look at Raytheon, similar story bounce up on the six
768.64s: following the notification. So what I'm highlighting is that defense in general prefers this outcome,
774.80s: but they still look a little bit weak here on a shorter term time frame. Crypto regulation,
780.24s: I already talked about Bitcoin. So a lot of these things are going to be shorter term in nature.
785.04s: And the way that I talk, especially for those in the Patreon, we spend some time looking through
790.24s: these different sectors to find what sectors are performing well and expanding and then looking for
796.56s: leaders within those sectors. Because right now there is so much money to be made as long as
802.96s: you're pragmatic in your approach, you're careful with your risk. Long equities right now
807.36s: is such a tough trade to beat because if we look at something as simple as just forward
812.88s: e-minis, I mean, they're at nosebleeds. They crack above six and they're hanging out up there.
818.00s: So I look at this as two different trading windows. There's the near term follow through of all this
825.36s: stuff about 90 days. And then beyond that, we start getting into more thematic positioning based on
831.84s: when we get a little more clarity around the policies. So hope that was helpful. If there's any
835.76s: questions, throw them in the comments below. And then if there's anything you're specifically looking
840.56s: at, I would love to hear about that as well. Be an outlier. I will see you all later.
