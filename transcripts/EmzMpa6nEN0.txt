462.00s: you
464.00s: what's up, Alieurs
466.00s: happy Friday
467.00s: welcome
468.00s: to episode
470.00s: five
471.00s: this is the
472.00s: finale
473.00s: of our
474.00s: latest
475.00s: iteration
476.00s: of
477.00s: our
479.00s: options
481.00s: trading basics
483.00s: here is a link to the
485.00s: video that you guys were looking at in the holding screen that was one of your homework assignments if you were being
487.00s: studious if not that's cool
489.00s: we'll work through it all the same
491.00s: before we get in
493.00s: as always I do like to see who's here on a Friday ready to learn about some options looks like we got goofy Lauren
498.00s: nandin
500.00s: good to see everybody
502.00s: I also see
503.00s: zx
504.00s: a familiar name as well
506.00s: the familiar name is always the best
508.00s: that's how you know people are kind of absorbing stuff because it takes a little while to get this stuff
514.00s: as I said episode five we've talked about a few things so far
518.00s: and in our
520.00s: prior sessions we've spent a while
523.00s: talking about stuff like
526.00s: taking something you see in the market and turning it into a trade using the Greeks
531.00s: to inform trade decision making
535.00s: went to manage and or exit
538.00s: a trade
540.00s: how to turn all of those into a portfolio
544.00s: now
545.00s: we're talking about this idea of
548.00s: creating an actual edge
550.00s: now you might think well why wouldn't this have been earlier which is a very question
556.00s: it's because I'm not actually talking about edge in this context of like a specific strategy
564.00s: my vision for the stream today is actually to talk about this from the context of you as a practitioner
572.00s: how do you build edge as a practitioner
576.00s: and you obviously need edge in your strategies
579.00s: but
581.00s: in order to get to a sustainable spot like that in your account
585.00s: it typically takes a little bit of back end effort that ideally we build out through processes
593.00s: so let's first discuss very quickly this concept of edge
599.00s: then after that I want to talk about some of the like
603.00s: absolute minimum core traits that need to exist in something that's viable
608.00s: I want to talk about some of the really common mistakes
612.00s: and then I want to spend a little bit of time working through some of the new wantses at specific steps
621.00s: so first as I mentioned we're going to talk about like what edge is
627.00s: there's a lot of different versions of this
631.00s: in effect it's your ability to generate positive expectancy
636.00s: that's what edges
641.00s: now there's also alpha
644.00s: which is different alpha is effective markets out performance
650.00s: so you can have edge
654.00s: but not necessarily outperform the market and for some people that's literally not even their goal
659.00s: some people just want to generate income or reduce volatility or whatever you still do that with edge
664.00s: but this idea of edge boils down to this idea of positive expectancy
670.00s: what is positive expectancy this is the artifact that you make money over time
675.00s: if you do the things or thing or combination there of over time
680.00s: your account on a p n l graph might go like this
685.00s: but in the long run it should have in r squared that's positive sloping
691.00s: that's the idea
694.00s: when we think about a process to find edge
699.00s: let's talk about this as a group
703.00s: how do you think you find edge like if somebody said to you
708.00s: I need to find edge in order to save my life
712.00s: where should I start what's the first thing I should do
716.00s: what would you say to them
718.00s: somebody says
720.00s: I need I need edge in order to save my life
724.00s: what's the first step I should take?
726.00s: what do you tell them?
728.00s: and my guess is we'll see a few things in the chat
730.00s: as you guys think about and at least throw your idea in
735.00s: it looks a lot different than people think
742.00s: the funny thing is as I mentioned in something about this video
746.00s: the video that I referenced earlier
748.00s: it's actually not as difficult to find as people think
752.00s: goofy says long-term trends not exciting
755.00s: okay so kind of zooming out a little bit
759.00s: anybody have any other advice for this awful scenario
763.00s: where somebody in order to save their life they need to know
767.00s: a good starting point to find edge
770.00s: any other guesses?
779.00s: we need to begin with an observation
786.00s: this observation can be a ton of different things
790.00s: one of the observations I might make
794.00s: is if I go into SMP
800.00s: and I zoom out long-term
804.00s: one of the observations that I see
808.00s: is that the thing tends to go up
811.00s: and that's over the last ten years so
814.00s: maybe I'll go out even further and see what it did over the last 20 years
818.00s: to me I can tell that this thing goes up
823.00s: that's an observation
825.00s: that's a good starting point
828.00s: a lot of people when they start looking for edge
832.00s: they start trying to extract it from all these different kinds of places
837.00s: but they kind of put stuff in the wrong order
842.00s: Lauren says find a strategy
845.00s: it's a good general concept
848.00s: that is the idea that we definitely would need to have some sort of strategy to execute
853.00s: and if you're familiar with the outlier strategy process
858.00s: which we've referred to a couple times
860.00s: because it's kind of like the base way that I give people a framework to think about stuff
867.00s: and it's this
869.00s: it's starting with a profit mechanism
872.00s: how do you find a profit mechanism
875.00s: how do you know where to look?
876.00s: it starts with observations
878.00s: you just have to look at stuff
880.00s: if you think that you're going to start trading
885.00s: and magically know what to trade
888.00s: and how to trade it
890.00s: and how to manage it and how to make money on it
894.00s: I want the same crack that you're smoking
897.00s: the reality is
900.00s: that ain't how it works
902.00s: it's not how it works
904.00s: you have to start with observations
906.00s: you have to start with stuff that you can see in contextualize
910.00s: just like in something like
914.00s: jiu-jitsu
915.00s: when you first start jiu-jitsu
917.00s: you spend a lot of time working on
919.00s: very basic seemingly boring positions
923.00s: but those provide the foundation
926.00s: for you to be able to do cooler stuff
930.00s: and then over time as you have a good understanding of that foundation
934.00s: and then you can get into cooler stuff
937.00s: all of a sudden it's actually pretty fun
939.00s: rather than just trying not to get strangled
942.00s: you're able to strangle people
944.00s: and you're able to exert your will
946.00s: and actually see it play out
948.00s: markets are not all that different
950.00s: when you first start trading
952.00s: if you think in these grand or terms
955.00s: you're probably going to set yourself up for failure
957.00s: that's the equivalent of a start of jiu-jitsu
959.00s: and thinking that you're going to sell everybody
961.00s: it's not happening
962.00s: but if instead you think of it as
966.00s: I'm just going to survive today
968.00s: but I'm just going to try to get through this training session
971.00s: and I think over time it'll make me better
973.00s: that's the same concept here
975.00s: so let's translate this into edge
977.00s: and let's actually talk about it a little more specifically
981.00s: I just gave you, believe it or not, your first edge
984.00s: your first edge is what we refer to as beta
989.00s: that's an edge that's positively expected over time
993.00s: that's edge
995.00s: is what people are looking for when they're trading
998.00s: of course not
999.00s: when people are trading they're looking for stuff
1001.00s: a little more nuanced, a little more performance
1003.00s: a little more exotic than this
1005.00s: but that is an edge, objectively speaking
1008.00s: that's an edge
1009.00s: that creates positive expected returns over the long run
1012.00s: simply tapping into market beta
1014.00s: and remember what is market beta
1017.00s: market beta realistically is momentum
1020.00s: that's how in index operates
1024.00s: Yes, MP500 is a basket of stocks
1027.00s: as it rebalances
1030.00s: it looks at the underperforming stocks
1033.00s: and it says you guys get the fuck out of here
1036.00s: you're no longer in the club, you're not in the index
1039.00s: and then it says well where the S&P 500
1042.00s: we just got rid of two
1044.00s: we're not the S&P 498
1047.00s: so now we got to find two names to make as back hole
1050.00s: and be S&P 500
1052.00s: so then what do we do to find this?
1054.00s: we go out and we find companies
1056.00s: that are doing well
1058.00s: top performers relative to the pack that fit
1060.00s: other base criteria and we add them
1063.00s: this is momentum
1065.00s: buying winners, selling losers
1069.00s: that's what market beta is
1071.00s: momentum
1072.00s: that's your first edge
1073.00s: you have access to that right now
1076.00s: if you say to yourself
1078.00s: I don't like that
1080.00s: that's okay
1081.00s: but you're not better than this
1083.00s: and that's the most important point
1085.00s: if you say to yourself
1086.00s: I don't like this
1088.00s: because it doesn't return as much as I want
1090.00s: or it has too much downside volatility
1092.00s: that's okay
1093.00s: but unless you have something else
1096.00s: that's better
1097.00s: you're not better than this
1099.00s: starting point
1103.00s: next
1106.00s: one of my favorite ways
1108.00s: to think about edge
1110.00s: especially for newer traders
1112.00s: is thinking through things
1115.00s: in terms of what you know about the markets
1118.00s: this is why the way new traders approach this is so broken
1122.00s: is because they try to create these really novel edges
1127.00s: but you have no experience
1130.00s: with the thing that you're trying to create an edge in
1134.00s: that's really hard
1139.00s: I got you
1140.00s: there's a way to make it easier
1144.00s: and I went through it in that video
1147.00s: but as you might guess
1149.00s: we're going to go through it again
1151.00s: because
1153.00s: none of us
1155.00s: are better than this
1157.00s: it's worth literally everybody's time
1159.00s: I actually have
1161.00s: a couple different tools
1163.00s: that help me do this at this point
1165.00s: so that it's not even all
1166.00s: manual
1168.00s: and what we should do
1171.00s: is use existing information
1175.00s: I go to SSRN
1177.00s: the Social Science Research Network
1179.00s: I type in the word stock market
1181.00s: and what do I do?
1183.00s: I just fucking look
1185.00s: just look
1186.00s: I look at stuff that's been posted recently
1189.00s: I look at stuff sorted by downloads
1192.00s: I just look through stuff
1194.00s: so maybe I'll start
1196.00s: by looking at things that are downloaded a lot
1198.00s: and
1200.00s: ballpark
1201.00s: if anything in here
1203.00s: I think
1204.00s: might be something
1205.00s: so this one
1206.00s: 151 trading strategies
1207.00s: I want to see who this is from
1209.00s: Quand Tijic Solutions
1212.00s: I already know that this source of information is skewed
1216.00s: that doesn't mean that this source of information is wrong
1220.00s: it doesn't mean it's bad
1221.00s: but I know from the jump
1223.00s: that this is a skewed piece of information
1227.00s: why do I know that
1228.00s: because they have a vested interest
1230.00s: in producing something that makes them look good
1233.00s: because they're obviously some sort of
1236.00s: quantitic solutions
1238.00s: I'm guessing some sort of trading firm
1240.00s: that doesn't mean that I don't read this
1243.00s: obviously lots of people have read it
1244.00s: there's some level of social proof
1246.00s: but I would take this in the context
1250.00s: of it's just that
1252.00s: so let's see it says
1254.00s: 550 mathematical formulas
1256.00s: for over 150 trading strategies
1258.00s: across different assets
1260.00s: and some strategies are based on machine learning
1264.00s: the complete version
1267.00s: so the presentation is tend to be descriptive
1270.00s: and I don't want to say this word
1273.00s: I don't know how to say this word
1275.00s: I always say this word
1279.00s: I can teach me Google
1282.00s: Resolute pronunciation
1288.00s: oh here we go
1290.00s: here we go
1292.00s: pedagogical
1294.00s: gotcha bitch pedagogical
1297.00s: so
1299.00s: you can start here
1301.00s: what I'm showing you is that
1304.00s: if you're sitting there saying like
1306.00s: you're trying to devise an edge
1308.00s: and like you've never done this
1310.00s: why?
1311.00s: probably because you don't know
1312.00s: now you know
1314.00s: there's no reason to not do this
1316.00s: market efficiency long-term returns
1318.00s: and behavior refinance
1319.00s: and this is from the O.G.
1322.00s: Fama
1323.00s: anything by Fama, French
1325.00s: and like this
1326.00s: all of these guys
1327.00s: O.G.s
1328.00s: Faba
1329.00s: we like Faba
1331.00s: another dude that we
1333.00s: definitely believe to a degree again
1335.00s: and we have to be cautious
1337.00s: when you see stuff coming from
1339.00s: investment management
1340.00s: Faba has books
1341.00s: but he also if you've read
1343.00s: his books he actually has data
1345.00s: behind it so it's not just
1347.00s: somebody trying to sell some shit
1349.00s: so let's see
1350.00s: so they're talking about
1352.00s: market efficiency and again
1354.00s: there's different forms of market efficiency
1356.00s: but what I'm showing you is that
1358.00s: this is the bedrock of building edge
1360.00s: it's doing
1361.00s: fucking research
1363.00s: and it's like a different
1365.00s: standard
1367.00s: stuff
1369.00s: as you read through these different
1371.00s: documentation these different pieces
1373.00s: you likely will come up with
1375.00s: different ideas and new information
1377.00s: on how you think you might be able to
1379.00s: interact with the market
1381.00s: and make money.
1383.00s: In again the video that I was
1385.00s: sharing with you guys and that's in the chat
1387.00s: I literally give you a list of different
1389.00s: edges that you start with
1391.00s: the conversation now from the idea of
1394.00s: finding something
1396.00s: and then I want to talk about
1398.00s: how we explore something
1401.00s: to ideally complete the rest of this process
1404.00s: but before I do that
1406.00s: are there any questions on what we talked about so far?
1409.00s: Are you curious
1411.00s: is anything here not making sense?
1413.00s: Do you have any questions about
1415.00s: best practices, tips, tricks, anything?
1419.00s: What we've discussed so far about what edge is
1424.00s: and then the bedrock
1426.00s: starting process of creating edge
1430.00s: being doing research like this.
1434.00s: Anything stick out to you guys.
1445.00s: I'm just going to flip through these really quick.
1447.00s: This one is definitely a must read.
1449.00s: I'll throw these into the chat for you guys.
1451.00s: This one's ready here and I have the links.
1457.00s: Another one.
1459.00s: Relative strength is solid by the way.
1462.00s: That's another really good tool.
1464.00s: Cool.
1466.00s: Let's continue that.
1468.00s: We now know how to find ideas for edge.
1471.00s: We started the stream from the context of somebody
1474.00s: that's going to be a big, big edge.
1477.00s: You now know what edge is
1479.00s: and you have a starting point on how to find it.
1483.00s: Once we identify something that looks interesting to us
1487.00s: that we think that there might be an effect,
1491.00s: then we need to research the effect itself.
1496.00s: That's where there's really a big departure
1500.00s: in terms of the approach of traders.
1504.00s: Ideally, you learn how to conduct basic data analysis
1509.00s: and statistical analysis.
1511.00s: That's the best approach.
1513.00s: If you're not ready for that,
1516.00s: the next thing you could do is use base observations
1520.00s: and then see if something holds true.
1523.00s: For example, let's see what this one says specifically.
1527.00s: This one's pretty old.
1529.00s: Let's see that improve risk adjusted returns.
1533.00s: Relative strength model tested in French farmers.
1537.00s: Sector back to the 20s increased absolute returns.
1540.00s: Relative strength portfolios outperform by in whole benchmark.
1544.00s: The addition of trend following parameter to dynamically hedge.
1548.00s: Decreases volume drawdown.
1550.00s: Relative strength model is then tested across a portfolio.
1553.00s: Yes, so this is solid.
1555.00s: So let's download this.
1559.00s: I'm literally showing you step by step.
1562.00s: What to do?
1564.00s: At least for those that aren't familiar with how to run your own data analysis yet.
1571.00s: Next, what I'm doing is I'm opening up Grock.
1574.00s: And I'm taking the thing that I just downloaded.
1579.00s: And I'm dropping it in.
1582.00s: So I'm closing this just because we don't need it.
1584.00s: It's going to be in Grock.
1586.00s: And we're here.
1588.00s: So now I'm going to say.
1591.00s: Read this paper.
1594.00s: Summarize the key findings.
1600.00s: Create a trading strategy based on the concepts within.
1609.00s: Now again.
1611.00s: I would read the paper, right?
1613.00s: Like, don't do this.
1614.00s: I've already read this paper.
1616.00s: I already know what it is, but you should read the paper.
1619.00s: Now the other reality is is like, if you don't know how to read scientific research.
1623.00s: Ask AI to help you because there's a specific way to read it.
1627.00s: It's not like reading a book.
1629.00s: You have to be a little more nuanced than that.
1632.00s: But let's see.
1633.00s: The core method involves ranking assets by trailing total returns over periods of 1,
1639.00s: 3, 6, 9, 12.
1640.00s: What does this sound like?
1643.00s: Momentum.
1645.00s: Across all ranking periods, relative strength portfolios consistently outperform by in whole benchmark.
1652.00s: That I did it.
1653.00s: Yeah, I great, great, great, great, great.
1655.00s: Let's see what the strategy is.
1658.00s: So we have five global assets.
1661.00s: So this is using S&P, foreign stocks, bonds, commodities, and REITs.
1669.00s: And then this says you're going to invest in the top three.
1672.00s: This is a very basic momentum approach balances concentration.
1676.00s: So by the way, in case you don't know with momentum style strategies.
1681.00s: When you see ranking sort holds like this like top three, top five, bottom three, bottom five,
1687.00s: bottom two, almost always they perform better with fewer.
1691.00s: But they're now more path dependent if something wonky happens to happen during the time that that trade is on.
1697.00s: So it's just something to be aware of when you see like three in here again, it's telling you why, right?
1703.00s: Because the diversification in general is worth it.
1708.00s: Now you have to determine what number it makes sense.
1711.00s: But again, this is giving you a starting point.
1714.00s: So now it's saying allocate to an asset if price is above its own 10 month MA if below allocate the portion to cash.
1720.00s: So what could we logically do next?
1723.00s: The next thing we could do is we could literally download price data or these things.
1730.00s: So let's take a look.
1733.00s: Let's go here just because I have the ability to download data from here.
1741.00s: And let's go how far back we want to go 95's a little bit long because some of the other ETFs wonky will back that far.
1752.00s: I'll have to figure that out in a second. I'm going to start it from 2000 because I don't want to get rid of 2008.
1759.00s: That's actually a really, really important time frame for us. We want 2008.
1763.00s: And it's because without that we miss some important like drawdown details.
1770.00s: So that's yeah, we definitely want that.
1774.00s: So there's spy.
1777.00s: We also want EFA TLT.
1780.00s: So let's grab TLT.
1783.00s: Download.
1791.00s: There we go.
1793.00s: We want that.
1795.00s: We want EFA.
1798.00s: By the way, the strategy that we're looking at now.
1802.00s: This isn't unique to these assets.
1805.00s: It's just being applied to this data set.
1808.00s: You can literally apply this to just about any working momentum factor.
1814.00s: So you can do it within individual indices sectors.
1818.00s: I typically do a sector version.
1820.00s: That's actually how I talk to you guys about the trades from what last Friday that I put on in healthcare.
1826.00s: Literally based on this.
1829.00s: What else is in here? DBC and VNQ. DBC.
1841.00s: Got it. And then VNQ.
1848.00s: Got it.
1849.00s: So now what I'm going to do is upload all of these into grock.
1854.00s: Again, I'm just using grock because I've happened to be tinkering with it more lately.
1858.00s: You can use whatever makes you happy.
1861.00s: One of the things I know right out of the gate is that this data is not clean yet.
1868.00s: But that's okay.
1870.00s: So now I'm going to tell it.
1872.00s: I've uploaded the daily price data for the names in the study for the names from the study.
1885.00s: First, clean the data.
1889.00s: Then apply the strategy.
1896.00s: Sumerize the performance.
1902.00s: Oceano says SSRN ranking top authors economics is worth a visit.
1908.00s: It's a great call.
1910.00s: One thing to keep of really, really important note of that I want to make sure that you guys are aware of.
1919.00s: Looking at economics with respect to the market is a fucking rabbit hole that catches a lot of people.
1927.00s: There's nothing wrong with it and it's useful in general.
1932.00s: But do not get stuck trying to analyze GDP employment claims.
1941.00s: Economics becomes a little too disconnected from what you're actually trying to trade and it's really intricate.
1950.00s: This is actually why this isn't like some sort of hot take.
1954.00s: If you look at the average performance of like economic based funds compared to other funds, they don't typically do well.
1961.00s: And it's for a very specific reason. There's actually a breadth of research out there on the relationship between economics and the market.
1970.00s: So I just saw the word economics, which made me think about that.
1974.00s: It's again, not bad. Do it.
1976.00s: It's okay to look at, but all I'm saying is don't get sucked down a rabbit hole thinking that there's some.
1982.00s: See great economic M1 M2 relationship for the money supply indicator that now has edge. That's just not how this thing works.
1994.00s: Let's see. Well, let's just let that continue to work.
2000.00s: The other thing that I want to talk about with respect to creating edge as this thing is going.
2008.00s: You have to think about what you're doing as a process with feedback loops.
2014.00s: And again, this is why I give you all the outlier strategy processes starting point, but I'll summarize like the core movements that you need to execute.
2026.00s: So you need to observe something.
2029.00s: This is how we come up with ideas. Once you observe something, you need to study it.
2035.00s: And the something that we're looking for is a profit mechanism. Then you need to study your profit mechanism.
2042.00s: Once you study it and you have details pertaining to it, then we need to think about devising strategies before that typically what I would do is just look at structures.
2063.00s: The reason why I'm looking for structures is I'm not trying to get site like two narrow focus,
2069.00s: Siphon into just looking at strategies prematurely.
2072.00s: So when this context, when I'm saying outline structures,
2076.00s: It's I want to think about the different ways that I could trade this profit mechanism.
2080.00s: So let's just think about it. We can buy calls so we can be long calls. We can sell puts. We can buy shares.
2089.00s: We can do it in different configurations in terms of delta, dates,
2094.00s: Press, expiration, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. All that kind of shit.
2097.00s: Fine. I have no idea what this thing is doing.
2103.00s: I have no why is it going to fucking Yahoo.
2106.00s: All right.
2109.00s: Quick intermission.
2112.00s: I am going to open up a chat with chat you PT and then I'm going to effectively tell to do the same thing.
2121.00s: I kind of noticed sometimes when I do this with rock, it loses its mind a little bit.
2126.00s: So read the attached paper, create a trading strategy,
2135.00s: from it, apply the strategy to the attached pickers,
2143.00s: by state and summarize the performance.
2149.00s: So we'll let that, we'll let that simmer.
2152.00s: I have no idea why this thing is going to fucking Fred.
2155.00s: We'll just let it live its best life.
2158.00s: You don't want to interrupt big daddy Elon with whatever he's doing.
2162.00s: Just let him live his best life.
2165.00s: We outline structures.
2168.00s: When we're outlining structures, we're literally just then seeing how it performs.
2171.00s: So for example, let's say that we find this rank and sort of like the top three,
2178.00s: bottom three, and let's say that we want to test buying calls, selling puts.
2184.00s: And let's say when we're testing buying calls, we try some different
2188.00s: things, what expiration do you choose?
2190.00s: You apply your foundational options knowledge to figure out what kind of profiles you want.
2196.00s: But maybe you start with understanding whatever the average holding duration is.
2200.00s: Let's say that you start with 70 TE and that this is rolled weekly.
2210.00s: Then let's say that there's 30 TE, 60, 90, 180.
2219.00s: Fine. So you have what five different terms that you're going to explore for this effect.
2227.00s: And then we repeat that on this side.
2230.00s: This is for the top three.
2232.00s: Then for the bottom three, we look at the same windows.
2237.00s: But instead, we look at long puts in short calls.
2242.00s: Okay. Now we have some starting point on what we might want to look at.
2250.00s: You can either, back test this information, or you can test it live.
2256.00s: Again, it's more efficient to back test.
2260.00s: However, if you aren't comfortable with doing that, you can still do a perfectly reasonable study.
2266.00s: By applying again what you know about options and back testing more manually.
2274.00s: This way you don't necessarily need options data and stuff like that.
2278.00s: Again, it's not as effective.
2280.00s: But you can also use a platform like think or swim.
2284.00s: So let's just take a look at what an iteration of that might look like.
2288.00s: I'm going to go back to the beginning of the year.
2293.00s: Let's see.
2297.00s: Let's go on to on demand.
2300.00s: And let's just see what this might look like.
2303.00s: Let's go to beginning of the year.
2308.00s: Two Jan.
2317.00s: And it already gave us our general instructions.
2322.00s: So this is saying.
2325.00s: This one's going to be long only.
2329.00s: The stop loss.
2330.00s: It looks like some sort of rotation monthly.
2332.00s: So sell if an asset drops out of the top three or fails a simple moving average filter.
2338.00s: Sell it month close and reallocate.
2343.00s: Only allocate if the asset prices above a 10 month SMA.
2347.00s: Okay.
2348.00s: So the first thing we need to do is create a little table for us to use.
2357.00s: Let's find some space for us to play.
2360.00s: Looks like this will work.
2362.00s: We're going to all this.
2367.00s: And we have one Jan 25.
2374.00s: We have a 10 month SMA.
2383.00s: And then we have a trailing 12 month percent return.
2389.00s: And we're going to look at this for spy, EFA, TLT, GF, whatever.
2396.00s: I forgot VNQ.
2399.00s: Fuck is the GF one.
2402.00s: You guys remember it.
2405.00s: Oh, DBC.
2406.00s: It's not even a fucking G.
2408.00s: Yo.
2410.00s: That's.
2412.00s: That's bad.
2413.00s: That's real bad.
2416.00s: I was so far off on that.
2418.00s: It's not even funny.
2423.00s: All right.
2424.00s: I'm going to move this out of the way.
2427.00s: Let's begin.
2429.00s: spy.
2433.00s: Trailing 12 month return here is 24.36.
2444.00s: And we will add for the sake of the study.
2448.00s: We will add a SMA.
2454.00s: And this one is a monthly and it's a 10 month.
2463.00s: I don't know who on earth would draw this.
2465.00s: It's that wonky S thing.
2467.00s: That's weird.
2468.00s: And let's make this one.
2470.00s: This color so it sticks out compared to everything.
2475.00s: That seems like it's above it.
2477.00s: So this one.
2480.00s: We have our starting point.
2484.00s: Next.
2485.00s: Think of a look at EFA.
2489.00s: It is below.
2491.00s: So we know immediately that doesn't qualify.
2494.00s: The trailing 12 month return here is 1.5%.
2500.00s: Next.
2501.00s: Deal tea.
2503.00s: This one is also below.
2507.00s: Trailing 12 month is negative 11%.
2510.00s: We already know that one's no good.
2513.00s: EBC.
2516.00s: Below.
2518.00s: No good.
2520.00s: Trailing 12 month is negative 1%.
2525.00s: Next.
2528.00s: VNQ.
2531.00s: This one's also below.
2536.00s: Trailing 12 month is negative 0.1%.
2543.00s: So the only one in here that even qualifies for this first month is spy.
2549.00s: So let's take a look at our play and spy.
2554.00s: As discussed, we're going to use a few different DTEs.
2557.00s: I'm not going to bother.
2558.00s: Actually, no, we'll do this seven as well.
2560.00s: No reason not to.
2561.00s: So we'll do 2 Jan.
2566.00s: I need to add a ticker in here.
2570.00s: ticker is spy.
2579.00s: Spot price is 587.6.
2591.00s: I'll link it.
2595.00s: I'll link it.
2598.00s: There we go.
2602.00s: Lot's size.
2603.00s: We're just going to do the same.
2607.00s: Same lots no matter what, but we need an expiration.
2611.00s: So this one's going to be an expiration.
2613.00s: I'm just building out like a quick little table for us.
2617.00s: And we're going to do 9 Jan is the first expiration.
2634.00s: For this, we'll just do like a 50 delta.
2637.00s: We'll do something that's at the money.
2639.00s: 588.
2640.00s: The premium we're going to pay is negative 4.74.
2646.00s: There's a really, really important detail.
2649.00s: BTDubs.
2651.00s: When I'm doing this, is notice how I did it at 4.74.
2655.00s: I'm buying at the offer.
2657.00s: One of the things that people do when they're trying to test stuff like this is they want
2662.00s: to try to see if they could get a fill at the mid price.
2665.00s: And if you're back testing something, you'll get very unrealistic fills.
2670.00s: Just transact at the bit or the offer.
2673.00s: If the difference of your strategy making money versus not is whether or not you get this 20, 30 cent
2680.00s: differential, you have a bigger fucking problem than the strategy in where you're getting filled.
2685.00s: That's the reality of it.
2686.00s: So to normalize, I just use whatever the bit or the offer is.
2692.00s: Just stick there.
2694.00s: The I'm going to skip doing too much of the like the delta gamma stuff because I don't really care
2699.00s: about any of that in this context.
2701.00s: The next thing I said that we would do is a DT.
2708.00s: I need to make two more columns here.
2711.00s: We need a DTE.
2713.00s: And then we need a DIT.
2715.00s: So DTE equals expiration was our date.
2722.00s: Oh.
2730.00s: Next.
2732.00s: We said that we're going to test the 30 day.
2736.00s: So I see a 29 day.
2740.00s: I can copy and paste the same data so far.
2743.00s: And then I can do 31 Jan.
2745.00s: And again, I'll show you what this looks like in a moment.
2749.00s: We're going to be the same lot size.
2751.00s: We're going to look for that 50 delta, which I see at the 590.
2754.00s: I'm going to favor the 590 even though it's a little bit more because it'll be theoretically
2759.00s: more liquid because it's at around number.
2761.00s: And we're going to buy that for $10 and 4.
2764.00s: And again, your delta there is a .51.
2768.00s: Dick.
2770.00s: Then we said that we would do a 60, which I see here.
2780.00s: Which is the 28th F.
2791.00s: What the fuck.
2792.00s: This is formatting.
2794.00s: This is a date.
2802.00s: Whatever.
2805.00s: The.
2807.00s: For 25th F.
2809.00s: We're still going to be at a one lot.
2817.00s: Strike price for the 50 delta is like the 591.
2822.00s: And then for something like this, I probably would favor like the closest primary strikes.
2829.00s: So in this case, the 590.
2831.00s: But I'm literally just going through raw raw dog in it.
2835.00s: Mine is 12.98 is our premium.
2839.00s: And then our delta there is a .5 even.
2842.00s: So that now gives us 50, 70s expiration.
2846.00s: Then I said that we would do 90 and like 180.
2849.00s: The next.
2851.00s: I see 31 March.
2853.00s: A lot size will be single again.
2856.00s: Strike price for this will be the 592.
2861.00s: Premium for the 592 is negative 1594.
2865.00s: Delta is .5 and then the last one.
2868.00s: 180.
2870.00s: Here.
2872.00s: That takes us to.
2874.00s: 30 June.
2877.00s: Our strike price.
2880.00s: Closes to a 50 delta which be the 595s.
2886.00s: We're going to get those for 2332.
2889.00s: And then those give us a point.
2892.00s: Or nine.
2893.00s: All right.
2894.00s: So here's what we have so far.
2900.00s: We have this built out and we have this.
2904.00s: The way that I have this structure is actually a little bit backwards.
2910.00s: Now that I think about it.
2914.00s: Well, it doesn't really matter.
2918.00s: This is fine.
2921.00s: This is for our one-jane entry.
2929.00s: We know which one we're taking.
2932.00s: In this case the top performer all the others are below.
2935.00s: They're 10 month moving average.
2937.00s: All I'm going to do now is fast forward time.
2940.00s: A week and literally run run through these and see.
2945.00s: How they perform the reason why I'm doing a week is to validate if it falls below its 10 month
2952.00s: SMA which we tracked.
2954.00s: And then the other thing is because for the seven day at least for this one iteration,
2959.00s: we're going to roll that one and continue to enter an exit that one.
2963.00s: So that's going to take us the expiration is nine Jan.
2968.00s: So let's go to nine Jan.
2975.00s: Okay.
2980.00s: So this first one we're now at nine Jan.
2985.00s: I'm going to update the days and trade formula which is our date minus entry dates.
2994.00s: Spot prices five sixty three sixty eight.
3000.00s: So spot prices now down 4.07 percent.
3003.00s: Our nine Jan.
3006.00s: Five eighty eight.
3009.00s: I also think I bought puts mentally.
3012.00s: I literally bought puts on all those.
3014.00s: That was a very silly.
3017.00s: It was a very silly thing to do.
3019.00s: Also I'm going to go to the Friday.
3022.00s: So I'm going to fix all those.
3026.00s: Yeah, so that we're the other expiration is will be fine.
3029.00s: But I want to keep us on a Friday cycle.
3032.00s: It'll be much easier.
3033.00s: So I'm just going to fix this one.
3036.00s: So this one is going to be.
3040.00s: E 5.67.
3044.00s: Oh, what the fuck.
3047.00s: There we go.
3051.00s: Oh, no.
3053.00s: Different.
3056.00s: This one they're both like two.
3058.00s: One of these will do the 590.
3061.00s: So 590.
3063.00s: This gives us four.
3066.00s: 464.
3068.00s: That's a delta of 0.52.
3071.00s: Great.
3072.00s: What I'm going to do is move all of them into here so that we'll be able to update them all at once without having a click.
3079.00s: Through all of them.
3081.00s: And then the next one we said was like 30 days.
3086.00s: So that was the 31 Jan.
3090.00s: And then these will be the 592.
3095.00s: But I'm 92.
3097.00s: Premium for those.
3100.00s: Negative 8.78.
3106.00s: And delta is 0.5 on the note.
3109.00s: And we'll add this.
3113.00s: And then we'll be able to just fast forward and see them all on.
3116.00s: Next.
3120.00s: Is our 5070T, which would be this one closest to like 60.
3126.00s: And this one, the 50 delta is.
3130.00s: We're going to do the 95's.
3132.00s: Again, it'll be a little bit more like way.
3134.00s: So 595.
3137.00s: And the premium there is negative 1193.
3141.00s: Delta is 0.49.
3143.00s: We will add this.
3147.00s: And I think the dates here are fucked up.
3153.00s: Let's do one Jan.
3158.00s: I guess 3 Jan.
3161.00s: Let's see what you guys are saying.
3169.00s: Nathan says, I always thought that AI wouldn't be able to back to properly using historical data.
3174.00s: I tried and never did what I wanted.
3175.00s: Well, you just have to troubleshoot it.
3177.00s: It's not necessarily going to get it all right right out of the gate.
3180.00s: But it's definitely completely capable of doing it.
3183.00s: You just have to troubleshoot it like any other model.
3185.00s: Because realistically, I mean, all it's doing is executing the Python code that you would execute.
3191.00s: It's not like it's executing it.
3196.00s: So yeah, I would just either diagnose it or exactly is Oceano is saying, just have it give you a rundown of what you should do.
3206.00s: See, it says, would there be any value in back testing against going long the underlying and then assuming that buying out of the money calls would give you similar results?
3214.00s: Or do the Greeks, non-linear is make it too far off?
3217.00s: Um, yeah, I would not, you can't make that assumption because it really wouldn't be similar results.
3229.00s: And you'll be able to see that actually in this exercise that we're doing together.
3233.00s: Now, what you could do is create like a planning factor for how they're different to simplify it going forward.
3238.00s: But there definitely would be enough nuances that I would not feel comfortable saying something like buying at the money calls will perform the same as being, you know, in the underlying.
3247.00s: It's inaccurate.
3248.00s: Now, what I would feel comfortable saying is that no matter what we know this effect is profitable by both of these that I think is okay.
3263.00s: You,
3264.00s: El Domus, you'll Domus as somebody who never traded before is options better to start with future stocks or for X.
3272.00s: Not necessarily.
3274.00s: I would say I would avoid for X for sure, but when it comes to starting to trade actually beginning with equity stocks is a lot simpler.
3285.00s: There's a lot of nuances with options, but what I would say to somebody that's never traded before is that if you wanted to start trading stock, for example, I would absolutely simultaneously learn options because in the long run, they will be useful to you for sure.
3303.00s: But in the near term, probably not probably not quite as much.
3311.00s: All right, we just did the 31, the 28th, sadly.
3316.00s: Now we have 31 March.
3319.00s: So our 31 March is going to be the technically the 596s, but again, I'm going to use the 595s because these are going to be a little bit more liquid.
3332.00s: And we're going to pay 1581 for those and we're going to be at a delta 51.
3339.00s: And then the last one.
3341.00s: Let's add this to our little lot.
3344.00s: And then our last one is 30 June.
3350.00s: Here.
3353.00s: And our 50 delta 605s, both of these are pretty liquid. So we'll use this one.
3361.00s: So we'll go with the 600.
3365.00s: Premium that we're paying here is 2390 and these are a 51 delta. Great.
3370.00s: So we have our full thing updated now, perfect.
3373.00s: Now we'll fast forward a week. We'll go to the 10th.
3376.00s: All I'm going to do is unlock all of these prices and then we'll see what they're trading at at this time.
3382.00s: So it'll be a little bit easier for us to analyze all of them at once.
3388.00s: The only nuances for the short days, tax expiration one, we're going to have to re-enter a trade for that one, but that's okay.
3402.00s: I'm just waiting for the pre-buffering.
3405.00s: But wait.
3406.00s: I need to stop doing that.
3408.00s: All right.
3409.00s: Now I would expect to see us losing.
3411.00s: So this one, we're effectively going to get 0.03.
3419.00s: Spot prices 5.79 year by the way.
3432.00s: Okay.
3434.00s: So that one is going to roll off and go away.
3437.00s: This one is now trading for 392.
3439.00s: We're not taking this one down.
3441.00s: Not necessarily yet.
3443.00s: We have to check the MA.
3445.00s: But I just want you to see how it's actually performing.
3449.00s: So that one's 392.
3450.00s: This one's also 392.
3456.00s: Is that the same thing twice?
3457.00s: It is the same thing twice.
3459.00s: Why do I have that one twice?
3462.00s: 31 Jan.
3463.00s: We need 28 feb.
3467.00s: Let's grab 28 feb.
3475.00s: I'm just double checking that the date is correct.
3480.00s: So we'll go with the 5.95 because this one will be a little bit more.
3485.00s: Oh, no, we have it, right?
3487.00s: We just didn't add it.
3489.00s: Well, I, let's not fucking share the blame there.
3491.00s: That one's clearly on me.
3493.00s: Okay.
3494.00s: Now we're back.
3495.00s: The only annoyance is now fucking this one's down here.
3499.00s: I can't reorder it.
3501.00s: But whatever.
3504.00s: All right, let's see what all these are running for.
3507.00s: This one is at 732.
3510.00s: The 31 March is at 1071.
3511.00s: And then the fur this is 1878.
3515.00s: Okay.
3516.00s: We have our first bit of data that take a look at the number of
3522.00s: the numbers.
3524.00s: So we have our first bit of data that take a look at the number of
3528.00s: the data that we have.
3531.00s: So let's look at it.
3534.00s: What do we have?
3535.00s: I'm going to get rid of these.
3536.00s: So they're not the way.
3537.00s: What do we have so far?
3539.00s: Well, we can see that we're losing money across the board.
3543.00s: I can also see that based on the day's
3548.00s: expiration.
3550.00s: There's a relationship with the P&L.
3554.00s: So let's take a look at that.
3556.00s: If I drop in a table on this.
3561.00s: For a chart, I should say.
3566.00s: I can get a sense of how these are behaving relative to one another.
3574.00s: So I'm plotting the day's to expiration.
3578.00s: And then I'm plotting the subsequent P&L for the same move.
3583.00s: And there's usable information in here for me.
3587.00s: One of those things that immediately looks interesting is the fact that the
3592.00s: 57 is actually a little bit lighter compared to where you would think it would be compared to the 29 and 88.
3598.00s: We could postulate a few reasons why that might be the case.
3602.00s: One of the reasons why that might be the case is actually a liquidity factor.
3605.00s: Maybe these are the ones we just got a bad price for as compared to this one,
3609.00s: where we might have gotten a good or favorable price for.
3611.00s: You be the one.
3612.00s: Don't know yet.
3613.00s: So that's our first plot.
3615.00s: Now what we need to do is rebuild this trade really quick for the seven days
3620.00s: expiration after we validate if it's above the 10 month of May, which it is.
3625.00s: I'm not going to make any adjustments to the other ones yet,
3628.00s: meaning the other trades because it's rebalance monthly.
3631.00s: We're only bothering with the seven days, which I just realize I'm not going to keep
3635.00s: bothering with.
3636.00s: So I'm going to switch this to monthly so that we can get through more faster.
3642.00s: So it's already almost six.
3645.00s: What I did now is I took the seven day down and I just moved it down here to kind of like a closed
3653.00s: section.
3654.00s: So this would be the open section in the log.
3666.00s: And then this would be the closed section.
3675.00s: And then I can still summarize.
3679.00s: Performance of our trades in here.
3682.00s: Like this.
3683.00s: I won't bother with the rest of.
3687.00s: I'll move this out of the way and I'm just going to fast forward us to the end of the month.
3693.00s: I just want to be able to get through a little bit more.
3695.00s: So let's go to the 31 of Jan.
3698.00s: And let's see how all of our positions are doing.
3713.00s: 31 Jan or dates spot price is buffering.
3718.00s: So we don't know yet.
3721.00s: 619.
3723.00s: 619.
3725.00s: 18.
3726.00s: So the underlying his moved up.
3730.00s: 3.67%.
3732.00s: So let's see how our positions did again.
3735.00s: I'm going to get rid of that.
3737.00s: Okay.
3738.00s: So our 31 Jan is now at 1781.
3742.00s: Our 28 Fab is at 24.
3745.00s: Nope.
3746.00s: That's a lie.
3747.00s: That one's at the bottom.
3749.00s: So we're going to get rid of the 29.
3751.00s: So we're going to get rid of the 29.
3754.00s: Then we're at 1395.
3756.00s: Then we're at 31 March is 2422.
3759.00s: And then we're at 3309.
3761.00s: Okay.
3762.00s: So let's see how these did comparatively.
3765.00s: And if I plot, I'm going to scoot these up so that there isn't a blank there.
3770.00s: And if we plot these really quick.
3778.00s: We do the same things before.
3782.00s: Let's see how they're performing in this time series.
3786.00s: I notice that the near term obviously did quite well.
3801.00s: I notice that the performance among the rest of these.
3807.00s: The factively negligible until you get further out in time.
3814.00s: The reason for the difference in performance that you see here is really, really simple.
3821.00s: You see that difference in performance.
3825.00s: Because these experienced more faded decay than this one did.
3829.00s: Also probably a change in vol.
3831.00s: This part of the term structure didn't change that much.
3834.00s: So we have again usable information.
3838.00s: So let's plot this.
3840.00s: Now what I'm going to do is recreate this exercise one more time.
3847.00s: So the first thing I'm going to do is redo this sorting.
3854.00s: We now need to do.
3858.00s: We're going to be 31 Jan, which is our next time window.
3863.00s: And we go through the same exercise.
3868.00s: Let's start.
3870.00s: This one is above.
3873.00s: And our trailing 12 month is 24.1%.
3878.00s: This should look pretty familiar to what we tested already.
3885.00s: Next we have EFA.
3888.00s: EFA is now above.
3890.00s: Technically.
3892.00s: If it's above, trailing 12 month is 5.9%.
3896.00s: Next is TLT.
3901.00s: TLT is still below, and trailing 12 month is negative 7.6.
3912.00s: BBC is next once below.
3919.00s: 12 is negative 2.7 so that one is recovering and then it fell. Then VnQ, this one is above.
3932.28s: And trailing 12 is 7.9. Okay. So we have a slightly different scenario here.
3942.44s: We can see that we have 3 that are above. And we can see that this is leading to 12, trailing 12 month.
3951.88s: This is second. So I'm only going to do 2. The other thing I'm not going to bother with is running all these different
3959.64s: explorations. I want to be very, very clear. If I were doing this exercise on my own, I would absolutely use all of these.
3967.16s: The only reason why I'm only going to do one expiration for each is for time. That's it.
3973.32s: But what I'm going to do is use the one that perform the best from this really small sample. You can't
3979.24s: actively conclude anything effectively from what we've seen so far. I'm giving you all the caveats of
3986.76s: the data analysis rules that I'm breaking for the sake of showing you a more important process component
3994.84s: versus the actual outcome of this one. Okay. So we need to find the closest to 1.80.
4003.00s: And in this case, I don't really love either of these, but we'll do the 20 June.
4012.04s: So 20 June, our ticker is going to be VnQ, spot prices 9137.
4021.32s: expiration is 20 June.
4026.20s: D is 31 June.
4030.92s: Lot's size we're just going to do one lots for them. And our 50 Delta will be the 92's.
4039.96s: We're going to pay for and those are 52 Delta. And then I'm going to do the same for S&P really quick.
4048.92s: Spy.
4051.56s: So far, do you guys have any questions on what we're doing? Why we're doing analyzing the information that we're
4059.16s: getting as a quick level set on where we're at in this broader process? We're testing to see like what kind of
4067.64s: edge may or may not exist here. Okay. So spy is at 60918 expiration. We're just going to use the
4079.72s: same expiration of 20 June. It's going to be a one lot. And we're going to use the
4086.52s: 606 20s because they're more liquid.
4095.08s: We're going to get those for minus 1906 and our Delta is a 48 a little bit light.
4102.60s: But that's okay. All right. So now let's fast forward to the end of February. And let's see how we did.
4110.36s: Looks like not great based on that chart. Looks like real, looks like real rough around the old edges.
4123.72s: But let's see.
4133.08s: Right now it's buffering. There we go. Okay. So in S&P
4140.76s: spot prices 586 16 and our current premium is 757. Going to VNQ. VNQ is looks like it's up a little bit.
4160.04s: It is 9366 and the premium for our 92s is now like five.
4175.48s: Well, it'll be like 490 to use the other side. 4.9. Okay.
4182.04s: Here's our performance for this month. The underlines changed respectively by 2.5% and 378. The
4196.04s: way that you can normalize these against one another is by comparing the spot price change
4202.04s: performance against your return on invested capital. And you can see which one's performed relative
4208.36s: to the others. So this gives us a net P&L here of 1059. What I'm going to do down here is get rid of
4218.92s: these other data points from the sample and I want to focus on the one that we did so that we can track
4225.56s: one more month of performance for these. So I'm going to take these drop these in.
4238.36s: And we have our aggregate P&L right now. We're down 140. A thing that you can do for general context is you can add
4251.32s: a benchmark return for the same timeframe. Really there wouldn't be one there. So this one will be
4261.64s: another would be. And you can also derive it from here. But I would add something like that up there
4273.24s: so that you can track stuff. So now we're at our next time zone. So now we're at 28th Ed.
4281.64s: We have our same data inputs here to track the performance of these. And let's take a look.
4295.48s: For VNQ we clearly are above our 10 month and the trailing 12 month return is 11.5%.
4311.72s: Spy is still above it's 10 month SMA trailing 12 month return is 15.6. EFA is above
4330.36s: it's 10 month trailing 12 month performance is 5.
4334.20s: ELT is below trailing 12 minus 1.1.
4347.08s: DBC is below trailing 12 month is minus 0.8. So we have our picks again for this month which is going to
4364.60s: be spy and be in Q respectively. So let's get those pulled up again and let's get our positions.
4373.72s: So now we are at 28th Ed. We're going to have spy and be in Q.
4383.16s: Spot price for spies 586 16. And again we're going to use that like 180 ish.
4393.40s: So I see the closest this would work fine but the issue is VNQ isn't going to have that
4399.96s: expiration so we've got to use the closest that fits like a primary expiration which is like the 19 steps.
4407.08s: So 19 step VNQ spot price is 93.66. We're going to do a one-long again strike price.
4418.76s: We'll probably do the 95s because it'll be a little more liquid. And you five.
4424.44s: We're going to pay 510 and we're getting a 49 delta. Grab spy.
4433.88s: We're going to look in that same 19 step expiration to keep it the same.
4440.28s: Strike price for the 50 delta puts us here at the 600's.
4444.76s: Premium we're going to pay is 2641 and then our delta here is 0.5.
4454.28s: Now we fast-forward and we rebalance monthly.
4459.88s: If during this process I see any of them cross below the 10 month SMA I'm going to go to that
4468.28s: point. So in this case I'm going to go to the 6th of March and we're going to exit at the
4474.36s: close of that day or the start of the next day I should say.
4479.72s: Which if we follow that logic it closed below here we wouldn't close before the close of the day
4489.16s: we would close the next day but the next day opened above.
4494.44s: I think we would open below so I think we would close here on this at like 570.
4502.44s: So let's go to the 7th of March here. I'm going to just jot the date down
4509.72s: so that we can go back and then I'm going to look at VNQ see how it did over the month.
4515.32s: And in this case it closed below on the 6th and on the 7th is when we would exit.
4525.64s: So let's take a look on the 7th of March.
4531.88s: So what you can tell I'm doing is I'm not going back in cherry picking stuff.
4536.60s: I'm literally applying the strategy as it's outlined and I'm saying to myself
4542.68s: how did this perform and where would the system itself had necessitated a change and we can clearly see when that is.
4554.28s: So this is now at 89. No, I'm 958.
4562.60s: And let's take a look at the premium for our options which were the 95s.
4570.92s: Those are going to come down for 360. Again, we're using the bid for where we're going to sell.
4577.32s: And then I'll do the same thing for spy and then we'll stop after this. What I want to do is just
4583.16s: see what the performance of the underlines would have done over the same timeframes.
4587.88s: So let you have a comparison. S&P is at 567 65. Our premium or the 600s out here
4600.60s: is at 1797. So that's where you get out.
4608.20s: And let's take a look at the last Friday of the month which would be 28 March.
4619.48s: And let's see where everything would sit. So here's where we're at so far.
4626.20s: Our total P&L on the here is down 1134. Again, depending on like what the
4637.48s: account size and stuff is, which we don't really have in this example.
4642.20s: The next thing that we care about is how did the underlines do up into this point.
4650.52s: So we need the spy price from the start of the year and the VNQ price from the start of the year.
4657.48s: Right now we had spy start at 587.6 and then we had VNQ at 91. 37.
4667.96s: And there's two ways you can test the performance so far.
4672.44s: You can test from your entry point to where they are now. But this is a rotation strategy. So
4679.24s: you might not actually have anything for the first one. Right? So like this VNQ trade
4684.04s: realistically started in this cycle. There was only one for this beginning cycle. So I wouldn't
4690.76s: even track that one there necessarily. It doesn't have a seat at the table.
4698.44s: What that means is we have to track these relative to what they are, which is what of the
4708.04s: underlines done so far in the year we can do that with spy. So right now we are at what is it 28 March?
4716.60s: And spot price right now at 28 March is 56765.
4726.36s: So then we can take a look at what the return is over this time frame, which is down effectively 20 points
4734.20s: and down about 3%.
4740.60s: 3.4%.
4744.92s: For VNQ and whatever you can test those individually as well. But the main thing here is you want to be able to
4751.64s: say to yourself like how would I have done doing this so far compared to just whatever the underlying
4760.12s: is done. You then would add your portfolio level details on top of this. So how are we sizing these
4769.88s: trades? This was like two grams. So let's say that this was what like a $10,000 portfolio?
4780.20s: Is that too little? No. That's fine. We have a $10,000 portfolio. So we started our balance at
4789.08s: $10,000. Our current balance at the end of this so far is this. Our overall return is this.
4802.84s: And then we can see what our net performance is comparatively, which is down 11%.
4810.36s: Now again, this isn't necessarily a direct comparison because this is just looking at the performance
4816.60s: of the underlying itself. So now we need to add one more comparison so we have a portfolio and then
4824.68s: we have a buy and hold equivalent using the same amount of money. So in this context, the buy and
4833.16s: hold here would be $10,000. Just like you see here. Then what we would do is take our $10,000.
4842.52s: Mine is our $10,000 times this return. Oops. Oops. Let's just do this first.
4861.48s: Is that, oh stop this. Oh, it's because the fucking negative. This times absolute. This. Good.
4881.96s: So three, thirty nine or so. So you're down definitely less, right? Like in this scenario,
4889.96s: you're absolutely losing less than what you are here. However, that doesn't mean in the long run.
4901.08s: Well, it really doesn't mean anything in the long run. In the long run, we would have to continue
4906.52s: testing this. The way that we would test this and these should equal the same thing.
4914.28s: The way that we should test this is by continuing this exercise, but doing it for a really long sample.
4923.16s: So that would look like going back to like 2000 in doing this very exercise from 2000 and
4931.72s: looking at the performance each month. So as brain said, it's just that simple.
4939.48s: Well, you got to do. And then you can see if you have an edge.
4944.52s: Mike drop. About as easy as it gets. So you're taking something that somebody else built
4950.20s: effectively. And then you're seeing, how does it perform? Do I like it or not?
4955.88s: Brain says helps if you have a master's degree in stats. That would help. I don't know anybody here
4961.32s: that has one of those. I don't have one of those. So but I imagine that that would that would certainly
4968.68s: help. But joking aside, don't really need what he's referring to. I think is that in my undergrad
4980.12s: and grad. I had stats as a part of it, but my master's was actually at MBA. So a little bit different.
4989.40s: Naden says this is so much work, but it's so worth the effort. This is super interesting. Here's
4995.00s: the, here's the reality of it. This is not a lot of work. It isn't. Think about what we just
5000.28s: went through as a collective. That's why the edge that you might expect to see from something like this
5006.92s: isn't going to be that much. Why would it be? This is not a lot of work. We didn't even
5011.32s: devise the strategy. We literally ripped the strategy from a paper. And then we tweaked it slightly
5017.96s: by adding options on it to start. But this is a absolutely trivial amount of effort.
5027.40s: Realistically speaking, like there really isn't that much effort that went into this. Now,
5032.04s: there is certainly time that goes into this. But you had to pay for it somehow. The returns
5041.40s: aren't going to generate themselves as exactly as you're pointing out, right? That it's worth the effort.
5045.88s: Because something is simple and trivial as this. It's a great starting point for somebody. And then
5053.88s: again, like when we're talking about the process that we did here, we started this stream from the
5060.44s: context of not knowing what edge is. Then we went onto SSRN. We found something that we thought was
5067.64s: a good example of edge. Then we looked to replicate what that study found over our own data sample.
5076.04s: And again, this is just a quick overview. The way that I would do this is, like I was showing you before,
5083.96s: I would continue this as is more or less. I would definitely add the price details for each of these.
5090.76s: So rather than just the 10 month and the trailing 12 month, I would include like price and price,
5096.52s: which you can also derive by the differences between these, by the way. But I would have that.
5103.24s: And then I would have for each of these multiple explorations. So again, I would do
5109.96s: the seven day, 30 so on. And then you'll see a trend relative to the different durations.
5117.24s: The other kind of stuff that I would look at is picking different days of the week to do the
5121.88s: rebalance instead of balancing every Friday. I would then maybe rebalance every third Friday or
5128.76s: every second Friday or whatever. But this kind of thing is again, like the starting point to give
5138.04s: you something to go off of. But again, like this is how you actually find edge. If your edge is like,
5145.24s: oh, I saw a video about vertical spreads. I want to try them. That's just not going to work,
5150.12s: like you have to understand with a better degree of certainty, like what you're attempting to
5155.40s: extract and why it may or may not be there. And you're just not going to get there with that level of
5163.56s: just superficial research. Like you got to sit down and you got to look at stuff. This is
5168.28s: generally what we spend a lot of time working through both in like the general pro community.
5176.52s: And it's because that this is where the work happens. It's the stuff that's less flashy to
5181.48s: people. And I'm really, really happy to be able to like bring it here, at least for a conversation
5186.04s: and for exposure for you guys. But this is the kind of shit that we, I mean, we built this original
5192.20s: version in the skill development workshop. In here, there's another version of momentum somewhere.
5198.12s: Hold on, where is it? Here, we did a version of this in the pro stream looking at the sector
5205.24s: rotation strategy and building a very similar version of this using sector rotation and then
5213.72s: comparing the performance there. So this one, by the way, was a long short combination.
5221.00s: But it's the kind of thing that there's something there. There's absolutely something worthwhile
5225.72s: there. And then it's up to the traders to kind of turn it into what you want. But this is also
5233.16s: not the kind of thing that's going to blow the doors off. This is the kind of thing that I would
5237.08s: get on to have something working that we understand that we know is robust while we go on
5243.72s: different side quests to find other stuff that might be more lucrative. This is a good starting point.
5253.96s: What we just did learned what edge was. We learned how to search SSRN and find something to
5261.56s: at least begin exploring. And then we went through a practical example of how to explore it,
5268.28s: at least at a very high cursory level. This is what it looks like. And again, this is like
5277.32s: the simplest version of what it looks like because we started with something that exists and then we
5282.12s: applied a very simple strategy to it. As you start getting more into the weeds, you'll find
5287.40s: that you can get way more exotic than this. The cool part is you'll also be able to test
5296.60s: efficiently once you learn how to do this. Like another base question I would have is not
5303.64s: following the random path here. But that's actually starting from the beginning of the year.
5309.80s: We had a good experience to test something that had a moderate drawdown. That actually looked
5318.28s: pretty rough. But if we go back and we cherry pick a period that does better. So if we go back
5325.24s: to somewhere around here and we start in August and see how these performed relative from August,
5334.04s: we likely will get another really usable piece of information. We'll do one of them really quick
5339.48s: because I don't know why I like trading this much, but I'm always super like I enjoy it. And I don't
5346.52s: know what we're going to find. I have an idea of what we're going to find. But I don't know
5350.36s: to what magnitude. So let's go to the Friday and August. Actually, no, we've been doing it
5357.00s: the end of the prior month. So that's fine. We'll just start at August. All I'm going to do is
5365.08s: we now have a sense of how this performed during a down period. I wouldn't get rid of this.
5369.96s: This is how it did. But for the sake of our conversation, just want to see how it does
5375.56s: in the context of a more bullish period that we've cherry picked. So this gives us our 2025 performance
5387.56s: let's go to 2024 and we're starting from to August 24. These two will be blank
5403.08s: and let's see really quick. I've got to clear this data out. So SNP is above
5413.32s: trailing 12 month return is 17.6%. EFA is next. This one is below. So it's no good trailing 12
5430.68s: is 6.2. ELT is above.
5439.56s: Trailing 12 is 0.8. EBC is below. So nothing to do there. Trailing 12 is minus 9.8.
5459.40s: B and Q is above. Trailing 12 is 7. So our pick here will obviously be V and Q and spy.
5476.60s: So let's take a look at our same playbook. We'll go out to the 17 Jan.
5484.04s: This is to all. We're going to have.
5489.08s: spy. Our spot price here is 95. The expiration that we're looking at is 17 Jan.
5505.48s: We're going to stick to the one launch for this. Our strike price is going to be the 91.
5510.92s: Premium 4.7 and our Delta is 0.5 on the note. Let's go to spy really quick.
5521.56s: We're at 529.
5526.04s: 77. The same size lot size. Our Delta will be the 535s.
5541.08s: Premium will be 28.2 and our Delta is a 52. And then let's just do one cycle.
5549.24s: Another month. Let's just see how these did. So 30 odd.
5557.08s: Our expiration. We'll start with spy since we're in here already.
5563.24s: What I want you to do is to get a sense of how they behave when the market accommodates.
5571.88s: And you got a little bit of a sample with the first iteration of them. But this will give you a slightly
5579.16s: more direct version. So this one spot price is 55832 and the premium 4 hour 535s is 41.
5593.00s: And then for VNQ. Let me even know if this one was profitable or not.
5602.20s: For VNQ that one's at 9419. So that one's good. And we had the 91s. Those are now at 570.
5612.92s: All right. So let's see in this scenario what would have happened.
5625.80s: Who was this over two? And then we will have two odd to 30 odd.
5634.68s: Look for performance here. Well, those accounts size will all be the same.
5647.64s: S from P was that 587. Oh no, I like 529. MSI. And then 30 odd. It was at 55832.
5664.68s: So up 28 points, 5% now let's take a look at the portfolio.
5682.68s: The portfolio value now is this plus this, here's your change equals your percentage.
5701.52s: So you can see your overall performance to the upside is almost triple.
5708.48s: Your performance to the downside was not insignificant, but that's what makes this a higher
5715.60s: volatility strategy.
5716.88s: That's the whole point of something like that.
5720.20s: And again, this isn't optimized really in any way.
5722.92s: We just kind of pitch a random expiration and a random delta to start with.
5728.80s: The point that I want you to walk away with is the process that we did to find an idea and
5734.88s: to begin testing the idea.
5737.88s: That wraps me up for our latest trading basics series.
5743.04s: I'm going to do one more episode, which will be maybe next Friday.
5747.56s: I don't know if we're going to have a stream next Friday or not, but it'll either be next
5751.08s: Friday or the following.
5753.16s: And it'll just be an open AMA.
5755.76s: So what you'll be able to do is go back through the prior five streams and collect your
5762.08s: questions.
5763.08s: Anything that you tried that you couldn't figure out how to do if you started this process.
5768.08s: Or anything.
5769.40s: And I want to effectively use it as a workshop together.
5773.32s: If this stuff is useful, I do ask that you share it with people.
5776.60s: Part of it is self-serving to try and grow my exposure.
5779.40s: But it's really more important to genuinely try to save people from throwing their fucking
5784.16s: money away.
5785.16s: That's what it boils down to.
5786.84s: Because a lot of people don't even know how to start something like this.
5789.60s: So my hope is to try and share.
5792.84s: Just genuine information with them is you can tell there's no ads.
5795.32s: It's completely free for everybody.
5797.92s: Be in outlier.
5799.92s: You'll learn.
