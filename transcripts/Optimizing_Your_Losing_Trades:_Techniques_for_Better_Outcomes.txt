0.00s: news flash if you trade or invest you're
3.84s: going to lose we all lose the point
7.14s: though is that you don't want to lose in
9.96s: the aggregate you want to lose in
12.48s: individual circumstances so that you can
15.06s: get smarter about your strategy and thus
18.54s: make more money if you get into this
21.00s: investing and trading world with the
23.34s: idea of never losing any money you're
25.50s: not going to make any money so in the
27.66s: video today I want to walk us through an
30.00s: example on what this can look like
32.40s: pretty frequently and then most
34.32s: importantly at the end of the video I'm
36.48s: gonna walk you through exactly how to
39.24s: maximize your losing trades because
41.52s: there is an opportunity in every single
44.52s: one of them if you know where to look
46.98s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
48.60s: back to all the outliers and if what I
50.64s: do helps you in any way consider signing
52.74s: up for the patreon I really appreciate
54.72s: your guys's support okay let's get to it
56.46s: how to maximize losing trades so here we
60.00s: have a post from options I purposefully
63.66s: went to the options subreddit versus
66.42s: Wall Street bets or something like that
68.34s: because people on Wall Street bets
69.96s: they're just slinging money
72.90s: fun coupons yeah hoping that something
76.32s: works and what I mean by that is you're
78.42s: not really getting a great sense of
80.10s: people who are attempting to manage risk
82.50s: and make money you're just seeing people
84.18s: who are trying to hit the lottery oh my
86.58s: God
88.02s: jackpot baby so I'm calling that from
91.08s: the group in its entirety and we're
93.18s: focusing on people who think they're
95.40s: trying to make money in a sophisticated
97.44s: manner yep options trading so with that
100.44s: I want to highlight a few things from
102.48s: this excerpt and what you can learn from
105.36s: this person so that you don't have to
108.42s: make the same exact mistakes if in life
111.72s: but trading specifically you are one of
114.42s: those people that has to touch the stove
117.00s: in order to realize it's hot if you say
119.16s: oh I only learned from my personal
120.78s: experience you're not gonna make any
122.76s:  money in this business there is
124.80s: too steep of a learning curve to be that
127.02s: ignorant to not be able to learn from
129.30s: other people's mistakes and successes so
132.66s: get rid of that right out of the gate
134.22s: let's learn from a mistake so this week
136.86s: might be the end for now to my trading
138.84s: career I have t triple Q calls that
141.42s: expire this week we Dove hard at the
144.30s: moment I'm still holding on to them to
146.04s: salvage what I can but I've essentially
147.72s: hit about four hundred dollars left in
150.30s: my account so let's see what this person
152.22s: has done to put into context I've been
154.92s: trading for almost a year that's the
156.78s: first thing that keys out to me almost a
158.76s: year that's a very short duration
160.74s: starting in September of 2019 I had
163.32s: plenty of success going up and even
165.36s: success on the way down after the
166.98s: coveted crash in March I started out
169.20s: with about 7 000 in September the
171.78s: account peaked a little over ninety
174.42s: thousand dollars by April of 2020. for
177.54s: those that have the detectors
179.64s: going off that's smart that's not to say
181.50s: that this didn't happen but that is a
184.08s: insane return how insane of a return
186.84s: well let's take a look from September
189.00s: 2019 to April 2020 that represents a
194.06s: 1185.71 return or an 8 000 annualized
198.96s: return that's what this person did now
200.70s: they probably were saving adding money
202.74s: to the account but right out of the gate
205.02s: we have this crazy ex expectation that's
208.98s: now been set after a very short time
212.40s: frame this is a blink of an eye in the
216.36s: time frame of trading okay so now let's
219.42s: take a look at what happened
220.98s: subsequently we see fast forward to July
224.64s: and I'm down to four hundred dollars
226.44s: that represents a negative 99.56 percent
230.04s: return on their money so recap they went
232.56s: from seven thousand to ninety thousand
234.54s: down to four hundred there is so much
237.78s: you can learn from this it's not funny
239.76s: let's take a look at a couple of these
241.44s: things the first one it says over the
243.72s: past Day and weekend I've been sick
245.76s: mentally feel like throwing up I want to
249.06s: know how I can cope with these losses
251.28s: mentally although my initial principle
253.32s: is money I was willing to lose the idea
255.72s: of getting out of the game and the fact
257.22s: that I lost 99 of my portfolio is hard
259.50s: to swallow all right let's talk about it
261.12s: the very first thing I see here
262.38s: obviously is a insanely emotional human
265.38s: being in general this is not good not
267.60s: even just in trading but in life if you
270.96s: go through these emotional roller
272.88s: coasters one you gain nothing from it
275.22s: two you detract your ability to think
277.92s: rationally and make good decisions three
280.50s: you go through this awful cycle and
283.50s: there's no benefit from going through
285.90s: this kind of emotional cycle now to be
287.94s: clear I'm not saying don't have emotions
290.10s: we all have emotions it's ignorant to
292.80s: think that you could just ah whatever I
294.84s: don't have emotions anymore you do but
297.00s: you can acknowledge the emotions like
298.92s: this person is trying to how can I cope
301.32s: with these losses mentally so they're
303.30s: trying to they're just really late to
305.46s: the punch they're waiting until it's
307.38s: super painful and now they're trying to
309.60s: figure out how to cope emotionally so
311.88s: right out of the gate I can see a
313.92s: contradiction in what they said my
315.78s: initial principle is money I was willing
317.16s: to lose then they're saying the fact
318.66s: that I lost 99 of my portfolio is hard
320.76s: to swallow this is a contradiction
322.20s: inherently so here's the deal it is okay
324.60s: the reason why it's okay is because
326.70s: guess what we we say things all the time
329.52s: that we think at the time we mean but
332.76s: then when it happens we don't mean
334.68s: humans are notorious for that kind of
337.86s: behavior so this is where actually
340.64s: visualizing how you think you will feel
343.56s: and actually putting yourself in the
346.20s: scenario and saying to yourself
348.26s: genuinely what do I think because what
351.36s: they're trying to do here is money I was
353.52s: willing to lose they were trying to
354.72s: distance themselves and create
356.22s: psychological separation from their
357.78s: investing principle which is very wise
360.00s: they didn't take this seriously the
362.10s: reason why I know they didn't take it
363.30s: seriously is literally in the same
365.46s: sentence they say I lost 99 of my
368.04s: portfolio is hard to swallow if you were
370.26s: willing to lose the money why is it so
372.00s: hard to swallow again it's because we
373.86s: don't want to lose we don't want to lose
375.48s: that money so being honest with yourself
377.64s: about this first part meaning you were
380.28s: not willing to lose this amount of money
382.26s: because you're obviously having a huge
384.36s: problem coping with it this tells me we
386.70s: weren't honest in the this step which
389.40s: most of us aren't this is the same thing
391.20s: you see with the New Year's
392.40s: resolutioners oh this year is different
394.44s: I'm gonna be fit I'm gonna go to the gym
396.66s: I'm gonna clean up my diet humans say
399.12s: all sorts of in the moment in the
401.70s: comfort of that moment that they
403.86s: immediately drop as soon as it becomes
406.20s: slightly difficult you think you're
407.82s: gonna wake up early until the alarm goes
409.50s: off at five and you're like oh well I'll
411.42s: do it tomorrow I don't want to do it
412.74s: today the problem with these kinds of
414.36s: things is you create this insanely
416.40s: slippery slope that then sets you up not
419.34s: even for a trading slash investing
421.98s: failure but a lifetime of this vicious
424.86s: cycle so we need to plan efficiently
426.96s: which I'm going to get into in just a
428.46s: second and then there's greed here's the
430.38s: deal greed is not inherently bad oh what
433.38s: you're not supposed to like greed what
434.76s: do you mean greed's not bad greed is a
437.22s: huge motivating factor I am greedy I
441.36s: have enough money to live comfortably
443.40s: for the rest of my life if I so choose
445.80s: however I still want want more because I
449.40s: want more opportunity it's not just that
451.68s: I want to make more money so that I can
453.36s: be Scrooge McDuck I like having more
455.52s: money because it allows me to also help
457.62s: more people to benefit more businesses
460.02s: by being a patron of them things like
461.94s: that matter a lot so don't inherently
464.58s: dismiss greed is bad now where greed
467.22s: becomes bad is when it's oppressive when
469.92s: you make poor decisions because your
472.32s: want of money is so great if my Greed
475.86s: for example was so excessive that I
478.26s: couldn't be happy unless I had a hundred
480.48s: million dollars that is awful greed
483.60s: because then I'm essentially dismissing
485.46s: an entire possibility for a healthy
487.74s: fulfilling life because I don't have
489.48s: this one super greedy metric so you have
491.94s: to figure out what level of greed you
494.04s: have but then you have to be comfortable
496.08s: with the outcome this person had an 8
499.08s: 000 annual return looking at them then
501.66s: they had a 100 drawdown this is what
504.36s: greed gets you in a lot of instances
506.64s: then this guy walks into my office and
509.76s: says those same Banks got greedy they
512.16s: lost track of the market and I can
514.08s: profit off of their stupidity so what I
516.48s: recommend for overcoming greed is again
519.12s: this planning phase which we're going to
521.52s: get into actually right now let's talk
524.10s: about growing from losses learn to lose
527.76s: well what does that mean we walk through
530.76s: a bunch of things from that scenario
532.38s: that can help us understand this idea of
534.42s: losing well but here are some questions
536.16s: to help you with this idea of losing
538.68s: well how do you feel after that losing
541.38s: trade losing week losing month again
543.84s: bear yourself to yourself all of this is
547.26s: useless unless you are honest if you
550.32s: feel some type of way that's telling you
552.84s: something if you genuinely do not feel
555.96s: perturbed in any way that's where we
558.30s: want to be if you have winning trades
560.58s: you should not be elated you should not
563.16s: be ecstatic it just means you're going
564.90s: to be emotional to the other degree we
566.52s: want to be even keel that is a much
569.10s: better way to live your life then as
571.08s: part of losing well is we have an
573.24s: opportunity to see how this fits into
576.66s: our system so if we have this losing
579.90s: trade we get to ask ourselves some more
582.54s: questions like did I maintain proper
585.30s: sizing did I manage the trade according
587.58s: to my plan again going back to this
590.10s: Comfort seeking side of our mind there's
592.02s: a lot of times when we have a trade plan
594.12s: that's written out that's logical that
596.10s: makes sense that we then immediately
598.14s: want to violate because of all of these
600.00s: emotional forces sometimes even if you
603.42s: don't fully believe in your trading plan
605.22s: as long as it involves managing risk you
608.22s: are far better off managing the risk
610.56s: following the trading plan than updating
612.78s: the trading plan as needed because if
615.12s: you start to allow yourself to violate
617.58s: your trading plan too early one it's
619.68s: useless two you are opening up again
622.02s: this very slippery psychological slope
624.90s: that is very difficult to reel back in
627.54s: later down on the line so did you manage
629.76s: it correctly not only pertaining to did
632.04s: you follow your management plan but did
634.08s: you as the operator behind the keyboard
636.96s: do the right steps that matters almost
639.78s: equally as much as the actual Edge
642.54s: development side of the strategy how
644.76s: does this losing trade fit into the
646.38s: broader strategy performance guess what
648.24s: any strategy is going to have losing
650.10s: trades we should be able to assess each
652.38s: of those losing trades and say yes I
654.36s: expected this this is within the risk
656.46s: control parameters that I set I said I'm
658.26s: going to have an eight percent stop loss
659.76s: it's time for me to get out done and
661.08s: done if you had a trade where you said I
663.66s: had an eight percent stop loss but the
665.28s: loss is way bigger than I thought it was
667.44s: that tells us something we need to make
669.66s: some adjustments which leads us into
672.32s: optimization this is where we get to
675.90s: feed the cycle of information so if we
680.04s: look at the performance of the strategy
682.44s: by itself and then the portfolio are you
684.60s: happy with it are you satisfied with
686.64s: your performance as as the trader is
689.28s: there anything you missed that led to a
691.92s: losing trade for example if you were
693.78s: selling premium and then earnings popped
695.64s: up that you didn't know about you missed
697.74s: something that means you could have done
699.36s: something better you need to integrate
700.92s: something else into your process are
703.08s: there new ideas that I want to test as a
705.36s: result of this loss the name of the game
707.88s: here is looking at your process as a
711.30s: Trader as feeding a system that we want
714.66s: to optimize over the long run we're not
717.48s: looking at each individual losing
719.46s: circumstance as the end-all be all
721.02s: because it's not unless you have awful
724.20s: risk control metrics you have to control
726.30s: risk first and foremost you can't invest
728.64s: no money so risk control has to come
731.16s: first but beyond that every single data
733.80s: point you get to collect from both
735.42s: winning and losing trades allows you to
737.64s: optimize with the correct mindset
739.86s: remember the obstacle is the way losing
744.06s: trades are difficult for our ego we
746.04s: don't want to look at them we want to
747.48s: exhibit the disposition effect where we
749.70s: cut winning trades too quickly let
751.86s: losing trades run too long but all of
754.38s: that is an opportunity for you to get
755.88s: better as a Trader and optimize your
757.62s: system if there's anything that I left
759.24s: out here don't forget to throw it in the
760.86s: comments or share what your favorite one
762.60s: is like subscribe be an outlier I'll see
765.18s: you guys later
