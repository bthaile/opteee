0.44s: we know things like volume weighted
2.12s: average price is really important it
3.88s: helps us understand what people are
5.40s: willing to pay for something volume
8.00s: profile allows you to visualize this
11.36s: exact thing for whatever ticker it is
14.12s: that you're looking at welcome back to
15.80s: another quick tips where you get tips
19.44s: quick let's talk about volume profile I
21.88s: get asked about this one a lot and it's
24.08s: super simple to set up so the whole
26.44s: point of volume profile is this cre Ates
30.28s: what we refer to as volume nodes and
33.12s: these are kind of like these little
34.28s: Peaks that jump out from the left hand
37.28s: side these little Peaks represent the
40.08s: number of transactions that occur at the
44.04s: price that you're hovering on so on
45.84s: thinker swim as I hover on this price
48.16s: level right here it's 81 and change this
51.28s: tells us that within this range here a
54.36s: pretty decent number of people have
56.56s: traded at this level and you can see
58.00s: that there's a big volume note here a
60.36s: really big one down here this dashed
63.04s: line is referred to as the point of
66.04s: control that's where the most volume
69.28s: occurred in the um time frame that
72.16s: you're looking at now one of the cool
73.40s: things with thinker swim is that the
75.16s: volume profile will automatically match
78.12s: the aggregation period is that you're
79.80s: looking at so right now this is telling
81.80s: you over the last 6 months daily time
84.96s: frames where the volume has occurred in
88.08s: what frequency at what price level level
90.52s: if I move this out to a onee you'll
92.52s: notice that things move around they
94.44s: shift and on a one-year time frame
96.76s: you'll notice that there's a big old
97.96s: volume node now here and if I move this
100.32s: into a 3-month time frame you'll notice
103.24s: that the point of control jumps from
105.88s: down in 24 up to 75 and that's because
110.56s: in the past 3 months this is where the
114.04s: majority of volume has occurred at this
117.04s: price level so the really cool thing in
120.00s: reason why I like volume profile so much
122.64s: is when we're looking and analyzing
125.08s: markets charting can sometimes feel like
127.76s: astrology but realistically if you break
130.12s: it down to its Bare Bones case it's
133.00s: literally the visual representation of
134.92s: supply and demand this tells us where
137.24s: people are willing to buy things meaning
139.80s: where what price and in what quantity so
144.12s: we can tell that as we get down here to
147.88s: this 75 handle that at least over the
150.08s: last 3 months there's obviously a lot of
152.64s: people that are willing to transact at
155.08s: this 75 handle if I zoom this out now
157.88s: then to 6 months and we take a look at
159.44s: that same 75 handle what do you notice
161.44s: it's still a really dominant region on
164.80s: this chart typically where you see these
167.72s: volume nodes you will find congestion
170.80s: you will find consolidation of some sort
173.20s: and obviously it just kind of makes
174.80s: sense right if a bunch of people are
176.72s: transacting on something at a price
178.48s: level then that that's going to mean
180.68s: that there's more volume at that price
182.32s: level it's kind of you know
183.92s: self-explanatory in that way then when
186.48s: you have these big transient style moves
189.76s: you tend to have very light volume nodes
192.32s: or even gaps in between them those gaps
196.16s: become areas that price tends to move
199.40s: very quickly through so to set this up
202.48s: the way that I have it set up which is
204.28s: definitely different than the automatic
206.76s: setting that thinker swim will give you
208.32s: I'll walk you through that right now
210.40s: we're going to go into studies up here
212.96s: and then we're going to hit edit studies
214.92s: and then we're going to go down to
216.04s: volume profile if you don't have it on
218.04s: this side over here you literally type
219.80s: it in over here and then you can add it
222.60s: to this side notice how the volume
224.68s: profile is up in the price axis not as
228.40s: volume or other lower graphs and if we
232.72s: come in here and we hit the settings I
235.12s: want to walk you through the way that I
236.44s: set it up again you can set this up
238.92s: however you want there's one really key
240.88s: thing that you have to pay attention to
242.36s: and the rest is just preference so you
245.04s: can set different heights you don't
246.60s: really have to mess with that the time
248.36s: per profile what I do is I automatically
250.96s: set it to adapt to the Chart I don't use
253.60s: any multiplier this is one of the
255.56s: settings that you have to be aware of
258.24s: which is on expansion if it is not on
261.72s: expansion and I click yes you're going
263.56s: to notice it's going to dump it over
265.20s: here and this is way less usable for me
270.56s: and the way that I trade so I always
273.12s: move on expansion to no and then you'll
276.96s: notice that it kind of overlays it with
279.64s: everything else I find this much more
281.56s: useful a couple other settings that you
284.08s: should be aware of the value area
286.80s: percent I don't really even plot the
288.96s: value area that's simply where the most
291.32s: volume transacted at at you know price
293.92s: range I don't use it that much the
296.00s: opacity is important because if you
298.24s: don't turn this to the correct level it
301.04s: will look much deeper than it should or
305.08s: it'll even block out the price so for
307.80s: example if I change this to
310.32s: 100% And we apply it washes out the
313.76s: entire chart right so that's why I
316.56s: typically find
318.32s: 20% is pretty good that's this and
322.36s: sometimes you can go even lighter that's
323.68s: fine now one of thing that people miss
326.20s: all the time because it's not easy to
327.96s: find is down here under globals
330.28s: if you click globals you can change the
333.08s: color for the point of control versus
335.48s: the entire width of the profile meaning
337.40s: these sections as compared to the value
339.88s: area so if you want the point of control
342.24s: to be something that's a little more
344.12s: visible like maybe if I add this blue to
346.36s: it just for the example you can kind of
348.48s: see that this line gets to be a little
351.36s: more
352.76s: distinct I don't bother using it cuz it
354.96s: doesn't really matter to me I can see
357.60s: where the point of control is when when
360.00s: I look across the entire volume profile
364.44s: then all you do is you save it you can
366.52s: add it to the Chart whenever you want
368.00s: you can move it in between other charts
370.08s: but this
371.44s: exact step is all it takes to move it
375.60s: from on expansion over here so if you
377.80s: have any questions let me know be an
378.80s: Aller see you later
