0.00s: What's up, outliers? This video is designed to be a crash course in trading psychology,
6.24s: specifically as it pertains to options, but this applies to active trading in general.
11.76s: And to kick us off, I want to share a video from one of the very best Ronnie Coleman.
19.80s: I don't want to be a body new. So nobody will have to hit it and
24.60s: wait. Go. I do it. Go.
28.28s: The big squat. If you couldn't hear him super clearly, because it's an old video, he says,
33.64s: everybody wants to be a bodybuilder. Don't nobody want to lift his heavy ass weight. I'll do it,
40.12s: though. That is the exact mindset. You are going to have to adopt in order to be successful
48.68s: at trading because literally everybody loves the idea of being a successful trader,
54.52s: being able to control your time is nice, being able to fly first class everywhere you go is
59.16s: really nice. Having fun things to do on the weekends because you have resources to do them,
64.68s: and you don't have to put your head down and save all the time, being able to travel. All those
68.20s: things are really nice. We love that part of it, but very few people embrace the work that has
76.84s: to come first. So let's talk about this. Now, the thing I want you to keep in mind is we go through
83.80s: literally this entire video is that normal thinking doesn't work in trading. Normal thinking works
91.96s: terribly. What's an example of that? Very simple. Bargain buying. You're taught that if you go to
97.48s: the store, you should look for things on sale because you're getting it cheaper than otherwise
102.84s: it would be. Well, in trading, that kind of mindset will lead you to buy things that are cheap
108.76s: because they're cheap, but in markets, there is very often a reason why things are cheap,
114.36s: and they tend to get cheaper. Inversely, some of the best possible trades to get into
121.08s: directionally speaking are trades that are going high in making higher highs. That's really tricky
129.16s: because you're buying something that seems to be at a high nominal level. But again, there's a
135.64s: reason why it's high. And a lot of times those things tend to go higher. Now, obviously, there's new
140.92s: wants to this. That's just a very simple example to prime your brain on why normal thinking does not
147.88s: work in trading. You have to embrace that concept. So let's talk about why a bunch of traders fail.
155.48s: There's different numbers that you'll see thrown around, but the overwhelming majority of
160.04s: traders do fail that start. So if you pop over to my website, I actually have a little table here
166.20s: that goes through some of the statistics and then some different studies that talks about the
171.64s: profitability of traders. I don't like throwing out numbers that you'll hear all the time, 90% of
175.88s: traders fail without giving you something to actually look at because most people are kind of lazy,
180.84s: that'll actually be a theme of this and they'll just repeat stuff that they've heard without actually
184.44s: looking it up. But it's actually a little over 90% will fail. So why do they fail? Well, I just hit
192.36s: one of the points for you directly. Lazy, lots of people that start trading are lazy. They again,
199.00s: like the idea of the output, they don't like the idea of the input. So they're going to try and apply
204.68s: a really subpar approach to start the process of trading and then shocker. They're going to get
209.64s: subpar results. There's no big surprise here. If you look at the people that are successful in
215.96s: pretty much anything, they are not lazy. You cannot be lazy. You have to put in work. That's actually
223.24s: one of the trickiest parts because there's a lot of people that have a lot of talent. But if you have
227.40s: a lot of talent, but you're lazy, the talent goes to waste in trading, can't be lazy. There's no
233.56s: shortcuts here and you have to embrace that early on. Lack of rigor, this is a really tricky one.
239.64s: And a lot of times in our mind, we're working harder than we actually are. And that's really difficult.
249.00s: And there's another component where it's kind of like in the Marine Corps, we say that we train
254.20s: to a standard, not to a time. So it doesn't actually matter how hard you work. What matters is what
261.56s: you get out of that work. So working efficiently, maybe not as grindy and as hard might actually have
268.20s: a better outcome. So the point that I'm trying to really drive home in this case is that rigor comes
275.48s: in different shapes and forms, but it's about having a very thorough approach, which we'll talk
281.32s: about more in a little bit. Self-aloof. This is probably one of the biggest ones on this list.
287.08s: This is where we really don't go through the process of critically self-analysing ourselves.
293.88s: It can be really uncomfortable. We don't like making ourselves feel bad or uncomfortable. So we
298.60s: avoid those things. And again, this is one of the beautiful things about the military,
302.20s: is you're going to get over that real, real fast because you're going to put on blast in front
307.64s: of everybody whenever you mess up and you have to be okay with it, otherwise you won't survive.
313.00s: So one of the big things that I try to remind people in the prospect of trading is that this
318.68s: series of really trying to understand yourself, your tendencies, your traits is extremely important.
326.04s: And if you lack the ability to deeply self-analysed and identify both strengths and weaknesses
333.64s: and really acknowledge those weaknesses, trading would be very difficult.
338.36s: Emotional processing. This is where you see traders say, like, oh, I got greedy. Or, oh,
345.24s: this should have happened. Or I got scared. Emotions are natural and
351.88s: contrary to popular belief in trading, you're not actually meant to be a robot. You're still a
357.48s: human being. And that's actually one of those sources of edge that's available is discretion.
362.92s: However, you have to develop a relationship with your emotions and understand how to regulate
369.24s: them. And again, this applies outside of trading. It applies to life in general. If you're the kind of
374.76s: person that you're in traffic, somebody cuts you off and you get viscerally mad about that,
380.04s: you have road rage like most people do. But again, remember, we have to do things differently than
385.16s: most people here. Then that doesn't bode well in trading. It means that you literally lack
390.92s: self-discipline and you can't control an emotional response to something. That is going to be a
396.76s: common theme as we go through this. And then goalie locks analysis. This is where you just focus on
403.72s: the pieces of something that you like. So for example, if we're modeling a trade, we really
410.04s: favor looking at the parts that we like. What are we going to do with the money that we make?
414.52s: What are we? How are we going to manage the profit as we make profit? Meanwhile, we spend exactly
419.32s: zero time thinking about what's going to happen if it goes against us. And that lack of preparation
425.16s: sets us up for a series of psychological shortfalls because when the trade, because they will,
431.80s: eventually goes against you, we haven't even considered that. So then we're taken by surprise
437.00s: because we're not thinking through things ahead of time. So you can overcome this.
442.36s: So let's talk about some of the key mindset components of outliers. And as you already probably
451.00s: guessed, if you want to be successful in trading by definition because the vast majority of traders
458.12s: do fail, you literally have to be an outlier. That means that you literally have to do things
463.32s: differently than everybody else. And you have to be willing to do the work that other people are not
468.36s: willing to do. So you have to adopt that mindset right from the jump. You got to be different. And
472.84s: it's not that you have to be born different. It's that you have to adopt in a different approach,
478.04s: which is one of the cool things about trading is that this is genuinely accessible to all of us.
483.64s: Self-critical, you have to be able to analyze yourself objectively. So people struggle with this
489.24s: massively. And it's because we have a really perverse relationship with our perception of ourselves.
497.96s: Big part of this is understanding who you are and your tendencies because the market is going to
503.16s: pull it out of you. If you're impulsive, you're going to find it because you're going to skip over
506.60s: a trade checklist, you're going to get into something without doing the analysis and you're going
510.04s: to get run over by something you didn't see. If you're too risk averse, the market's going to
514.12s: find that because you're going to have trades that eventually do go your way, but you're going to
518.20s: not have enough risk on because you're scared to lose money. And then the trades that would have
522.76s: offset your losing trades are now too small and they don't. The market will find all of your
527.00s: weaknesses. So you have to be prepared to identify them as the market shows them to you. And as you
533.72s: see them, course correct regularly. And that's the cool part is you don't have to have all of this
539.24s: dialed in before you start, but you have to be receptive to the information as it comes in because
546.12s: it will. Now, organization is non-negotiable. And if you're one of those people that you think
552.28s: that you're going to memorize everything and that you can just go off the cuff, it'll be easier
556.12s: that way. Again, this isn't for you. Period full stop. You have to be organized. You have to have
560.60s: some sort of approach to collect quantitative and qualitative feedback for your approach so that
566.92s: you can then make the adjustments and changes that we just talked about.
570.92s: Emotional regulation. This is again, something that applies to people who maintain their
575.48s: composure in life in general. Again, using a fighting example. If you see mixed martial artists as
581.96s: they start a fight, if they're well disciplined and trained, they're very relaxed. Whereas if you
587.88s: look at the normal person, if they're in a fight, they're very tense, everything's super tight,
591.88s: they're not loose. Their movements are very jagged. And it's because they haven't trained themselves
598.92s: to withstand that kind of stress. So a big part of becoming successful in trading psychologically
606.20s: is slowly increasing your exposure. The composure of a mixed martial artist doesn't happen overnight.
612.60s: It happens by them going in the ring, sparring, doing things like that. Getting used to seeing
617.96s: punches come really close to their face, but not overreacting, opening up another opportunity.
623.24s: That takes time. It takes repetitions and having a pragmatic approach where you slowly build your
629.64s: tolerance over time is going to be exceedingly important. And again, you have to identify what your
635.48s: emotional tendencies are. Do you act erashenly when you're scared? Do you get scared easily?
642.12s: Are you like me where you're a little bit too risk averse so that when you see a trade start not
647.08s: going the way that you thought it should, do you want to immediately intervene and do something that
651.48s: sabotages the outcome of the system? Understanding your tendencies is unequivocally one of the most
659.16s: important things you can do in this process. Now, the last thing I want to know on this side
663.16s: specifically is this idea of trade and confidence because a lot of people get a completely
670.12s: misunderstood concept of confidence. Confidence isn't something that you can manufacture. You can't
675.08s: fake it. Confidence comes from the consistent demonstration of a skill set. So, for example,
682.92s: if I was going to go out and shoot a basketball and if I've shot a basketball tens of thousands of
687.80s: times before, I'm going to be confident at least that I'm going to get off a decent shot. And the
693.72s: probability that it's going to go into depending on how far away I am is probably pretty good.
698.20s: So that's not because I walked out without ever touching a basketball and just thinking,
703.72s: oh, yeah, this is going to go great. You can't fake the funk. And again, the problem with trading
708.44s: is that it's going to show all these little cracks. So the way that you build confidence is through
713.96s: demonstrating the skill set over time. One of the best ways to do this is through paper trading,
719.24s: which I'll throw a link in the notes below that talks about that a little bit more. But this is a
724.92s: simple way to build confidence so that you're not out there unsure of what's going to happen.
731.40s: You're not comfortable with your plan because he didn't take the time to build a good plan
735.16s: because you didn't apply any rigor to it. You just slapped something together. And because you
739.80s: wanted to make a bunch of money because you don't understand the landscape and think this is going
743.16s: to be easy. That's going to lead to losing buckets of money. All right. So let's fly through some of
749.96s: these other things that you have to be aware of specifically your cognitive biases. And there are
755.96s: a lot of them. If you go over to my website outliertrading.io underneath resources, there is a thing
762.68s: here called trader decision making cognitive biases. I literally list out 24. I'm not going to go
766.92s: through them here. The reason why you need to know these is because these plague literally all of us.
772.52s: And the reason why cognitive biases exist is because they impact most people going back to this
779.72s: point over here to succeed. You literally need to be an outlier. It means you need to do things
784.36s: differently. It means you need to understand what most people do so that therefore you can do it
789.32s: differently and more successfully. So the cognitive biases really influences most of our decision
795.24s: making in different ways. Take time to get familiar with this. The other thing that you have to be
799.88s: aware from a bias perspective is called the Dunning Kruger effect. I specifically give it a little
803.96s: focus thing down here because this will destroy most people. And the cliff notes version of this
811.00s: is that you go through a period in the beginning where you're learning a lot of basics in a relatively
815.56s: short period of time and it's drastically boosts your confidence. You think you know more than you do
822.76s: at this point. That's essentially what that means. Then you are introduced to the fact that you don't.
829.64s: And you make a mistake and you end up losing a bunch of money. For me, this was about five years into
834.52s: my trading career where I had on a single trade over a 30% drawdown on my account.
841.00s: Pretty dumb looking back, but it makes complete sense because I had been trading for some time at
846.44s: that point. I've put in hundreds and hundreds of hours into learning and studying and I thought I
852.20s: had it figured out. It didn't. But then over time, if you stick with it over time, it builds and builds
860.52s: and builds. So for those that are curious about like this mastery thing that's there's a couple
865.88s: studies out there that 10,000 hours of a skill set typically leads to mastery, quote unquote.
871.08s: And for that in context, that means that you need to spend at least five hours every single day for
876.84s: five and a half years nonstop, not skipping a single day to hit that 10,000 hour mark. So I offer
882.92s: this for context. So if you've been trading for three years, but you're spending 10 hours on it
887.16s: a week, you might have some good experience. You're nowhere near mastery yet. It takes time to get
893.56s: there. So let's talk now a little bit about decision making. And one of the things that we do in
898.52s: trading is we try to justify what we want to do. And it's a big problem. We actually have to flip
904.84s: that script entirely. And we have to look for I call notes. We have to look for reasons not to do
910.12s: things. We have to look to poke holes in our ideas, not to blindly try to support them. Again,
917.24s: you have to do things differently. Being wrong. This is a tricky one. We all have an ego. The ego
923.40s: doesn't like to be challenged or bruised. But we have to get really comfortable with being wrong
928.84s: all the time. The way that we do that is we detach our self worth from being wrong. Because in
937.72s: trading, if you can get comfortable being wrong, trading becomes much easier. Because each time I'm
943.48s: wrong, it's not a, oh, what did I miss? Oh, this is the worst thing I suck as a person. That
949.48s: starts to go away. And you think, okay, yeah, probably, realistically, this one fell out a different
953.64s: way. That'll happen sometimes. Not all trades are going to be winners. So the easiest thing to do here
959.48s: is learn that being wrong is part of the process. You don't have to stay slaved to your ideas,
965.40s: your theories. You need to apply this over here, which is Bayesian analysis. This is what I call
971.56s: strong convictions loosely held. It means that you try to form the best idea that you can. But then
976.52s: as soon as there's new information that causes you to think about it differently or give you a
980.84s: different outcome, you drop the other thing like a rock and you adopt the new thing that's based on
986.92s: new information. But it has to be well justified. You can't just flip flop unnecessarily. You have to
993.16s: have a pragmatic approach to receiving new information, baking it into the existing information,
999.64s: and then coming up with a new conclusion that either supports or forces you down a different path.
1005.96s: Regarous analysis summarized is you have to do the hard work. That's all there is to it. You have
1011.24s: to take the time. You can't accept easy answers. So for example, if a trader has a trade that was a
1017.16s: winning position and then it turns into a losing trade, a lot of times they'll summarize that as,
1022.20s: oh, I got greedy. Well, maybe that's a superficial answer. Because if you know about expected return,
1029.32s: you know that you actually need to have trades that overcome your losing trades. So it might not have
1035.48s: been that you were greedy. It might be that you didn't actually take the time to build an approach
1041.08s: and follow that. So you're blaming it on something I call it false attribution, where you're not
1046.76s: even going to be able to look in the right place because you haven't identified the correct spot to
1050.84s: look. Okay. So now let's talk about three simple steps to transform your trading psychology.
1057.00s: This is something we already talked about. I have to reiterate the point because it's one of the
1060.52s: most important ones here. You have to do and act differently than everybody else that's trading
1067.40s: because the vast majority of them fail. So if you see a lot of traders looking left, you might want to
1073.16s: look right. You have to understand that this is a really challenging thing that takes time to build
1079.96s: over time, but it's entirely doable. But you cannot be lazy about it. This leads to the next point,
1086.84s: which is if you are not willing to challenge your own thoughts and quantify what you're doing and
1093.16s: analyze it, this is not for you. So what that means is if you've never looked through a trade
1098.20s: log because you haven't built one, I don't understand how you could possibly think that trading is
1103.24s: magically going to work out for you. This is like trying to start a business and not tracking your
1108.20s: finances as a business. That business probably will not succeed. Same thing here. Last thing,
1115.96s: build the skill set. The way everything else will slowly start to fall into place is if you take
1124.36s: the time to build a skill set. So for example, the way that you build or get over the idea of being
1130.28s: greedy is by taking the time to test a strategy, build the approach, track the results, know what to do.
1140.20s: So then when the trade's on, it's not a function of being greedy or not. It's a function of letting
1144.44s: the trade do what it's supposed to do. The way that you overcome the vast majority of the psychological
1150.52s: challenges of trading is to build the skill set based on actual work that you can actually look at
1156.60s: and analyze and feel confident in the overwhelming majority of traders struggle building confidence or
1163.64s: executing a plan because they don't believe it and why should they? The majority haven't taken
1168.52s: the time to build something that they can trust. The last thing I want to show you are a bunch of
1173.56s: different studies and I recommend looking these up. These are available for all the outlier pro members
1179.32s: on Patreon. You can download them for free and you have access to all of them automatically.
1184.60s: Everybody else, you can just look them up. None of this is paid. You can get access to all of this.
1189.64s: This simply talks about a lot of the different qualities of traders in terms of their emotional
1197.08s: processing and decision making. And again, the reason why we study what most people do is because we
1203.64s: know we need to do something different than all of them. Overconfidence, this has everything to
1210.28s: do with Dunning Kruger. And fun fact, the more overconfidence somebody is, the more they tend to trade.
1215.96s: Full of these kinds of things. So as always, if you have any questions, let me know. Be an outlier. See you
