0.00s: let's talk about trading earnings with
2.34s: options why would you do this I'm going
5.04s: to walk you through exactly that I'm
6.96s: going to walk you through the way we can
9.00s: structure different strategies around
11.16s: earnings and at the end of the video I'm
13.20s: going to walk you through exactly how I
15.24s: think about trading earnings with
16.98s: options and then some best practices so
18.96s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
20.52s: back to all the outliers shout out to
22.38s: the patreon family and the YouTube
24.12s: members with that let's get right into
26.22s: it let's start off with the hypothesis I
29.04s: wish I was high on pot news this is why
32.40s: we even bother trading earnings with
34.80s: options and it's because when we're in
37.74s: an earnings cycle we're getting a lot of
39.36s: new information companies are reporting
41.52s: how they're doing at a point in time
43.38s: they're giving us details on how they've
46.14s: performed over the past quarter but then
48.30s: what my face is blocking right here is
50.94s: they're also helping us understand the
53.76s: future projections so we want to have an
56.04s: idea of how this company is going to do
58.14s: going forward and this helps us with
60.78s: that so as you can imagine there's a lot
63.96s: of information wrapped around these
66.24s: events these are what we like to call
67.80s: binary events meaning there can be a big
70.98s: move after this event up or down binary
73.98s: because a lot of information is being
76.14s: released at once now just a quick admin
78.42s: note Sometimes some of the details of an
81.30s: earnings report will be leaked early and
83.70s: you can even kind of find that in the
85.14s: options it's not super common it's
86.52s: illegal but sometimes you can see it but
88.38s: anyways when we're talking about
89.46s: earnings releases there's essentially a
91.08s: calendar that tells us when they're
92.22s: coming and I can show you that in just a
93.60s: second and you'll notice here we have AM
95.70s: or PM that is when the earnings are
98.88s: going to be announced so if we come over
100.38s: here to the platform and today is the
102.78s: 12th of May and we're looking out at an
104.88s: upcoming earnings release so this is the
106.80s: 16th of May and I see HD which is uh
109.38s: Home Depot so down here if I highlight
111.78s: that you can see that this is the q1
113.94s: earnings release and it'll tell you when
116.52s: it's estimated to be announced so in
118.56s: this case it's before the market and if
120.60s: we take a look at a chart a lot of times
122.52s: you can even see previous earnings
124.26s: releases and when those were announced
126.48s: so in this case the last earnings they
128.28s: announced was on the 21st of February
130.44s: and that was also before the market they
132.36s: tend to report around the same time
134.22s: frame each year so now we know that
136.26s: there's an event coming up with a lot of
137.70s: new information if you trade options
139.44s: which should be tingling in your head is
141.12s: volatility because that's what's going
142.68s: on here as we're coming into an earnings
144.60s: release implied volatility is going to
146.70s: start to expand the reason why it
149.88s: expands is there's an expectation of new
153.12s: information that could significantly
154.92s: move the product that's the nature of
156.54s: implied volatility forward-looking
158.34s: volatility so what you'll notice is
160.26s: typically about two weeks into the
162.18s: earnings release we will see implied
163.98s: volatility start to expand slowly now if
166.86s: you could isolate all other variables
168.78s: this would be much easier to see but as
170.76s: you know markets move so sometimes this
173.52s: movement could be hampered by different
175.32s: things this is not just my own
177.48s: observations although I do track a very
179.46s: large data set on earnings plays but
181.74s: this is also very well studied if you
183.72s: look up ssrn earnings releases I have a
185.94s: bunch of links to throw in here in the
187.38s: notes for you to check out on different
188.64s: papers that I like but the punch line
190.20s: here is this release will start to Spur
193.50s: IV expansion and if we take a look I'm
195.84s: actually curious um what Home Depot is
197.82s: doing over the last few weeks we're just
199.32s: starting to get into the window
200.46s: essentially when implied volatility will
202.62s: start to expand so you can kind of see
204.84s: this uptick about two weeks ago and
206.58s: there could have been other things going
207.60s: on as well but nonetheless I assume that
209.64s: that would be part of that expansion
211.14s: from what we saw over here and one of
213.42s: the things that's really useful for
214.92s: Traders to be aware of is this idea of
216.54s: an expected move this kind of helps us
218.64s: conceptualize what we think the expected
221.82s: implied volatility is telling us the
223.68s: underlying might move so for example if
225.48s: we pull up something like Home Depot
227.04s: which again has earnings coming up on
229.44s: the 16th before the market head over
231.24s: here to trade what we want to do is we
232.74s: want to go to the expiration cycle the
235.20s: closest expiration cycle that has the
237.78s: earnings event in it that part's really
239.52s: important because if it doesn't have the
241.14s: earnings event in it then the implied
243.24s: volatility is not going to expand for
244.68s: that cycle so if we pull up this 19 may
247.20s: we can see this at the money straddle
249.54s: and then this is essentially how we
251.22s: figure out roughly how much we think
253.08s: it's going to move so in this case you
254.40s: would just take the at the money
255.48s: straddle which is 7.60 over here call it
258.42s: seven dollars over here so about 14 and
261.48s: 60 cents so a fourteen dollars sixty
263.70s: Cent move up or down is what's currently
265.56s: being priced in now this will adjust as
267.84s: it gets closer this is just kind of an
269.64s: initial look and that's a really
270.72s: important note for folks because if you
272.64s: start trying to plan all of your
274.74s: earnings plays let's say on the weekend
275.94s: because that's when you do your homework
277.14s: that's okay but you need to refresh it
279.30s: right before the release because other
281.40s: things happen in the market so what you
283.26s: first saw might be impacted by other
284.94s: things really important to stay close to
287.10s: the event so one other note here that's
289.62s: kind of a good thing to keep an eye on
291.60s: is the implied volatility for the cycle
293.58s: so let me switch my camera real quick so
295.86s: it's easier for you to see and over here
298.32s: we have 47 0.3 percent and then notice
301.32s: how implied volatility Goes Down A Lot
303.12s: 37 34 32 31 notice how close all of
307.92s: these are to one another and then how
309.60s: high this one is relative to the others
311.46s: this tells you something's going on here
313.32s: and very frequently you can identify
315.18s: when earnings is coming up because of
316.86s: something like this if we pull up
318.30s: something like maybe Lowe's which is
320.52s: reporting further out in time they're
322.56s: reporting on the 23rd before the market
325.68s: notice how the front earnings cycle this
328.20s: is or the front expiration Cycles High
330.24s: uh but this doesn't really matter
331.26s: because it's already passed but if we
332.46s: take a look at the 19 May expiration
334.80s: cycle that's only 30 then it jumps to 39
338.10s: and then down to 36 again sometimes the
341.40s: difference might be smaller but
342.78s: sometimes it can be pretty significant
344.28s: and one other quick example if we pull
346.20s: up Apple which I have a position on
348.42s: right now which is a covered or a ratio
351.24s: diagonal but if we take a look at the
353.34s: Apple implied volatility ratings over
355.26s: here you can kind of see that it goes
357.24s: from 20 21 22 23 percent and this is
360.72s: normal the reason why this is normal is
362.52s: typically the more time we have the more
364.74s: volatility we expect there to be because
366.60s: there's more time for that position to
368.34s: move around and do things but you'll
369.84s: find an anomaly here where a near-term
372.18s: expiration is higher compared to a later
373.74s: term expiration and it's typically
375.30s: because there's a reason like earnings
376.92s: so about two weeks out implied
378.72s: volatility is going to start expanding
380.22s: everything else remaining the same then
381.84s: after the earnings release we're gonna
383.70s: see a pretty significant contraction in
386.16s: implied volatility and that's because
387.48s: all the information is now known we know
390.18s: what's going on so leading into there's
392.40s: a lot of anticipation a bunch of
393.66s: information is going to come out then
394.86s: boom there goes the earnings release and
397.02s: we have all of the information out there
399.00s: all that implied volatility is going to
400.80s: contract down and really what's
402.30s: noteworthy is both of these are tradable
404.16s: events if we're talking about wanting to
406.26s: trade the IV expansion I'm typically
408.78s: going to try to be long implied
410.58s: volatility again everything else
412.14s: remaining the same so this is going to
413.88s: be mostly long premium strategies and
415.92s: then when IV contracts we're going to
418.14s: want to be short implied volatile
419.58s: facility but you have to be short before
421.80s: the release which we'll get into in a
424.02s: minute in terms of timing and what
425.22s: specific strategies I use to give you
426.84s: some ideas for a long implied volatility
428.70s: I'm mostly going to use long straddles
430.92s: vast majority of the time personally
432.84s: that is what I'm going to trade as long
434.28s: straddles I very rarely would trade long
436.20s: singles but that's if I have potentially
438.18s: a really strong directional hypothesis
440.40s: but I typically wouldn't in this
441.90s: scenario I'm focusing on the implied
443.34s: volatility first and foremost so I'm
444.96s: going to default to a straddle and then
446.34s: after the earnings release if I have a
448.26s: strong directional hypothesis short
450.42s: single options meaning short call short
451.92s: put again typically not the case more
453.84s: often than not it's going to be a short
455.16s: straddle or strangle notice how I don't
457.38s: have strangles over here I don't tend to
459.42s: buy them leading into the announcement
461.52s: and that's just because my data set and
463.56s: the way I trade them I tend to do better
465.12s: with straddles so I trade those but
466.92s: after the earnings release sometimes I
469.14s: do have
470.28s: um primarily an implied volatility
472.08s: hypothesis but I kind of amplify it with
474.48s: the directional bias so if we use again
477.06s: Home Depot for an example right now it's
479.10s: been pretty range bound so I don't have
481.20s: any sort of strong directional
482.82s: hypothesis here but let's just pretend
484.98s: that it actually this is when it was
486.84s: reporting earnings and it was reporting
488.34s: earnings after you know the next day
490.26s: after this I would have a little bit of
491.64s: a short bias just because it generally
493.68s: overextended there and the momentum it
495.54s: would need to get over this plus two
497.22s: linear regression channel would be
498.48s: pretty significant could happen after
499.80s: earnings but nonetheless that would be
501.84s: just an example of when I would skew
503.28s: them now let's get into this idea of how
506.04s: we actually trade these and again you
507.72s: can see that there's two distinct
509.22s: hypothesis here IV expansion and
511.08s: contraction again when I'm trading
512.76s: around earnings that's the primary
514.50s: hypothesis I have I can amplify it with
517.08s: Direction but just about never would I
519.84s: trade earnings just because of Direction
522.12s: because it's a binary event the way
524.28s: earnings behave the reason why they're a
526.80s: binary event is because they move a lot
529.02s: and they can go many cycles in a row
531.42s: where they don't really do anything just
532.92s: kind of boring and they're not gapping
534.72s: up or down and then all of a sudden you
536.64s: can have a release that moves you know
538.56s: four times the expected earnings the
540.36s: biggest ever that happens that's why
542.34s: there's such volatile events so when
543.96s: we're talking about these two different
545.10s: time frames you should already know this
546.72s: answer but when we're trading IV
548.52s: expansion we're going to start about two
550.08s: weeks out typically me would be one week
552.06s: out and then contraction it's going to
553.68s: be right around the release so what I
555.66s: mean by this is when you're trading the
557.22s: implied volatility expansion it is very
559.38s: very important really when you're
560.58s: trading both of these you have to
562.26s: include the date that has the earnings
564.54s: release so if we come back over here and
566.88s: we take a look at Home Depot again if
568.32s: you had traded this 12 May expiration
570.30s: cycle attempting to trade the expansion
572.22s: and volatility for 19 may you might see
574.80s: some of it but not most of it and it's
576.90s: because the markets are smart they know
579.24s: this expiration cycle is not exposed to
581.28s: the earnings so it's not going to have a
582.78s: bunch of volatility applied to it
584.28s: whereas this earnings cycle will so it's
586.74s: really important to stay closer flash to
589.02s: bang closer to the actual event because
591.00s: this is where our hypothesis lives now
593.70s: when we're trading contraction I
595.86s: typically am going to enter right before
598.50s: the market closed this is before the
600.54s: release
606.18s: you're late so if it's a Tuesday p.m
610.08s: announcement meaning after the close I
612.06s: would get in Tuesday right before the
614.16s: close or as close to it as I can maybe
615.96s: five minutes out if I'm you know just
617.82s: trying to get a fill and then if it's
619.68s: reporting Wednesday morning same exact
621.54s: time frame right that's the same cycle
623.34s: that's going to gain you exposure and
624.78s: it's going to be the closest expiration
626.04s: that I can find I already talked to you
627.54s: about the directional structures this is
629.28s: more just for your general notes but
630.84s: again these are really the the main
632.58s: trades I'm going to throw on and more
635.22s: often than not it will be this one with
637.86s: my really screwed up Circle that
639.90s: actually crossed it out it would be that
641.40s: one for contraction and then this way
643.20s: for expansion and again for me it's
644.94s: typically not going to be a strangle it
647.04s: typically would be just a long straddle
648.78s: and the other and these are if there's
651.36s: these are directional so notice how the
653.70s: way I make the straddles and strangles
655.20s: directional is by including a skew or a
657.84s: ratio meaning I could trade the 30 Delta
660.54s: strangle but sell more calls than puts
662.52s: or I could sell more puts in a straddle
665.04s: than the calls you can skew these
667.08s: strategies a bit so that it does take a
668.82s: little more of a directional um overall
670.74s: disposition but for non-directional
672.72s: again pretty vanilla long straddles
674.64s: short straddle strangles either of those
676.80s: and then days expiration we want to be
678.84s: closest expiration right after the
681.12s: earnings release so now I want to talk
682.56s: to you quick about some best practices
683.70s: the first one is sizing you got to size
685.50s: these pretty smart because this is not
688.08s: just my own observations although I do
689.94s: track a very large data set our
692.10s: undefined risk strategies so I tend to
694.14s: size down into earnings and it's just
696.30s: because things move a lot and there's a
697.80s: lot of occurrences so I'm not worried
699.60s: about getting one to be a super great
701.28s: home run there's a lot that's released
703.62s: in an expiration cycle the second thing
705.42s: is liquid most of the earnings I trade
707.88s: are within the S P 500 and it's because
709.74s: they're super liquid I like things that
711.30s: have weeklies but the liquidity part
713.16s: can't be overstated because let's say
714.72s: something is a big Miss and it just all
716.76s: goes to hell in a handbasket
719.64s: if it's illiquid on your way trying to
721.92s: get in just imagine how tough it is to
723.90s: get out when everybody else is trying to
725.58s: crawl out to the door when something's
727.20s: going poorly you get chopped up there so
729.42s: liquidity is kind of really important in
731.52s: this context and the other thing to note
732.84s: is around volatility in general
734.28s: liquidity inherently expands so you can
737.10s: have something that's liquid and even
738.78s: before the earnings release is out we
740.82s: can have this giant expansion and
743.40s: volatility because of the release itself
745.56s: and that negatively impacts liquidity
747.36s: right out of the gate p l define this
749.28s: does not mean that I am defining only
751.80s: trading to find p l or defined risk
754.32s: strategies notice how pretty much none
755.64s: of these are all I'm talking about here
757.20s: is I'm gonna have a very clearly defined
759.84s: profit Target and lost Target that I'm
761.88s: going to manage these trades more often
763.68s: than not I'm gonna put them on before
765.06s: the close for specifically the
766.74s: contraction which this is most of what I
768.48s: do I do the expansion but it's mostly
770.22s: the contraction so when I'm trading
772.08s: these I'm gonna put it on close to the
773.88s: event and then after earnings is
775.62s: released I might give the market a few
777.54s: minutes after the open for the
778.86s: volatility to drain out meaningfully but
781.08s: after that I'm getting out I'm not
782.40s: waiting to see how it does the rest of
784.02s: the day and it's because there's too
785.82s: many times that something can reverse
787.38s: there's too many times that something
788.52s: can have a really bad continuation so
790.62s: sometimes people get really bad
791.94s: confirmation bias they want to trade an
793.74s: earnings release they wait until the
795.48s: announcement and then they hold it all
797.40s: day because they think they can squeeze
799.38s: out more money and sometimes you can but
800.94s: a lot of times it'll reverse sometimes
802.56s: you can't remember we're trading the
804.42s: volatility here not the direction at
806.16s: least the way I'm structuring these in
807.48s: general so I'm trading around the
809.16s: volatility of the event I'm not waiting
810.84s: for the follow through more often than
812.22s: not now one quick note there is another
814.20s: implied volatility contraction strategy
816.06s: that I do run which is immediately after
818.70s: the release this is going to
820.50s: significantly decrease the amount of
822.78s: money you'll collect via premium but
824.70s: sometimes you can follow along with the
826.38s: directions so it's a slightly different
827.88s: hypothesis in that scenario but again in
830.64s: general I'm going to trade them like
831.78s: this portfolio risk this is just
833.58s: important to note that if you're trading
834.90s: a bunch of earnings things can go wrong
836.28s: at once so be mindful of how different
838.56s: trades interact with one another track
840.42s: and watch this is really important so I
843.00s: actually maintained a pretty big watch
844.80s: list of different earnings products that
847.32s: I follow so that I get a sense of how
849.18s: they move so for example if we come back
850.92s: here to Home Depot what I might do is I
853.68s: like to go back
854.82s: um at least six quarters preferably
856.92s: eight and I'll see how it did around
859.02s: earnings what was the expected what was
861.24s: the actual earnings per share what was
862.92s: the close price before the release what
865.08s: was the open after the release what was
867.06s: the high price after the release what
868.68s: was the low price all of those details
870.60s: give me context notice how I say they
872.94s: don't inform me on what's going to
875.10s: happen because again you can have
876.60s: something that reported a certain way
877.98s: for a long time and then one report it
880.20s: all changes and it's completely
881.46s: different it gives you some ideas on
884.16s: what to generally expect in a large data
887.22s: sample so outlier moves are common here
889.98s: but nonetheless you can still get an
892.32s: idea of how things tend to move which is
894.36s: useful for me edging is expensive which
896.16s: is exactly why most of these do not have
898.92s: legs but that does not mean never cap
901.62s: your risk if you're super uncomfortable
903.06s: just be really thoughtful about how you
904.92s: choose to hedge these strategies because
906.24s: again for example if we're trading
907.80s: implied volatility contraction our
909.60s: entire hypothesis is that implied
911.52s: volatility is high compared to the
914.28s: expected historic volatility so if
916.80s: you're selling options to capitalize on
918.72s: that but then you're also buying them
920.16s: what you're buying is relatively
922.08s: expensive so we want to be careful about
924.72s: how we choose to manage hedging in
927.84s: general I won't hedge stuff to the
929.58s: downside but if I'm trading some sort of
931.74s: tech stock or something like that I will
933.90s: always consider capping the upside risk
936.36s: because most things if it's a strong
938.52s: stock it can fall down most of the time
940.92s: sooner or later it'll come back up but
942.48s: if you are talking about something that
944.40s: is a great earnings release it can
946.26s: Skyrocket up and out super fast and that
948.96s: can be really difficult to find the door
950.34s: quickly enough
951.54s: I was just mentioning this ivhv this is
954.42s: really the entire concept of earnings
956.04s: place we are assuming that implied
958.44s: volatility is going to be elevated
960.06s: compared to Historic volatility so if we
961.98s: come over here and look at an example
963.18s: that's what this chart is down here
964.56s: yellow is implied kind of the white and
966.42s: the gray is historic and in general
968.88s: you're going to see implied tracking
970.20s: above historic but if we go back through
972.12s: we can come in here and see some of
974.04s: these previous releases just for an
975.78s: example let's take a look at uh MGM and
979.02s: we can also take a look at uh what's
982.02s: another one you guys want to look at
983.28s: maybe EA so let's take a look at MGM and
987.18s: we can see how it did around earnings so
988.92s: notice here before earnings implied was
991.56s: tracking above realized but then after
993.72s: earnings realized actually went over
996.00s: implied that means that the expected
998.16s: move was not high enough for what the
1000.14s: realized move was so if you just traded
1002.24s: volatility here this might have been a
1003.92s: tricky trade because the move was bigger
1005.90s: than what implied volatility was giving
1007.58s: us another quick example is if we pull
1010.10s: up maybe EA and I don't know how these
1012.08s: did I'm just kind of pulling up random
1013.28s: ones this is funny enough an example of
1015.26s: the inverse so we can see earnings was
1016.82s: here notice how high implied volatility
1019.16s: was leading into the release and then
1021.02s: after the release we get this implied
1022.76s: volatility Crush as it's referred to
1024.86s: it's just a rapid contraction implied
1026.54s: volatility and notice how it tracked
1028.52s: above historic volatility that is the
1031.04s: scenario we're looking for where IV is
1032.78s: greater than HV and maintains it through
1034.46s: the earnings the other three things I
1036.08s: want to mention the first one
1037.04s: fundamental analysis technical analysis
1039.20s: really limited efficacy around earnings
1042.02s: and it's because there's so much new
1043.46s: information coming out I don't weight
1045.38s: these that heavily meaning if something
1047.60s: has you know a really good multiple I
1049.76s: don't necessarily think that's going to
1051.26s: support us a whole lot through earnings
1052.88s: compared to the current multiple that's
1054.74s: being shared with us in that earnings
1056.36s: release same thing for technical
1057.80s: analysis you'll very frequently see kind
1060.08s: of these big moves that you might say
1062.24s: Okay resistance is here at 127 but then
1065.24s: around earnings it just doesn't care
1067.30s: that is
1070.18s:  so just know that you know
1072.74s: fundamental analysis technical analysis
1074.30s: around earnings limited efficacy we
1076.16s: talked about the cycle IV already so I'm
1077.90s: not going to beat that again but that's
1079.10s: a really good thing to keep in the back
1080.36s: your mind that the period that has the
1082.82s: earnings release in it the monthly
1084.32s: volatility would tend to be higher and
1085.76s: then the last thing is positive earnings
1087.50s: announcement drift this is kind of a
1089.24s: notion where if we get a really big
1090.68s: earnings beat and a big subsequent move
1092.66s: post earnings up or down that we tend to
1094.82s: see a continuation over the next quarter
1096.50s: this is still in play but in the recent
1099.32s: two years this is contracted a lot for S
1102.32s: P 500 stocks so the PED is not as
1105.56s: impactful for S P 500 stocks as it used
1107.90s: to be which I just think is an important
1109.34s: General admin note so hope it was useful
1111.98s: for you if you have any questions throw
1113.36s: them down in the comments below let me
1114.80s: know what you like don't forget to share
