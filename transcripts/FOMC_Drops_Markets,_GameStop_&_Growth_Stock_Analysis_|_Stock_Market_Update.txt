0.76s: what's up outliers we're on the mobile
2.80s: setup right now we're hanging out in
5.40s: Brooklyn you guys probably can't see out
8.00s: the window maybe you can but that's what
11.52s: it's looking like right now um wasn't
14.00s: originally planning on doing a video
15.44s: today because I'm actually doing a live
16.88s: stream tomorrow with a few friends about
19.52s: GameStop specifically but with the FED
22.64s: announcement and then the market
23.80s: reaction that you see on the screen I
25.80s: had a few people reach out asking if I
27.48s: could talk about what really what I
29.44s: think's going on and how this might look
31.12s: and absolutely because today was a big
33.36s: day the couple things to note though
36.36s: first and foremost some people were
38.60s: being I consider it a little hyperbolic
41.44s: with the language you know essentially
43.28s: saying that it's like a massacre and
44.96s: stuff like that it's okay to be loose
47.84s: with your terminology and to be
49.44s: hyperbolic as long as you understand
53.12s: what you're doing and what I mean by
55.00s: that is like if you're a season Trader
57.12s: you're comfortable and like you just
58.92s: like you know hyperbole that's fine but
62.40s: for a lot of newer Traders if you use
64.48s: stuff like that it kind of primes your
66.12s: brain into thinking that it's like a
68.72s: massacre that it's like really terrible
70.68s: out there that everything is falling
72.28s: apart and it starts to frame the way
75.52s: that you perceive information which is
77.08s: actually kind of dangerous because today
78.88s: was a big day and this was one of the
81.04s: larger intraday down moves that we've
83.52s: seen in spy for the last few years
86.36s: there's no no debate about that but all
90.24s: in context right like this isn't a Black
92.96s: Monday this isn't a covid crash yet and
98.12s: the context matters because there's
101.16s: obviously a ton of big bearish volume
103.64s: stepping in as you would expect and if
106.04s: you've been hanging out in any of the
107.76s: live streams that we've done for the
109.72s: past literally I I was looking at it's
112.20s: like 10 days that we've been talking
114.68s: about this internal rotation that we're
117.04s: seeing and some of the stuff that I've
119.56s: sh sh you for that stems from things
122.28s: like this right where we look at the
126.60s: overall advancing and declining issues
130.00s: highs and lows and we look at the moving
132.28s: averages for these for different time
133.92s: frames and this didn't like sneak up on
137.28s: anybody now one of the things that's
139.36s: worth noting though is that what
141.00s: happened
142.28s: today I mean I didn't know that that was
144.48s: going to happen today I had a suspicion
147.00s: that there was going to be a little bit
148.04s: more volatility but what I'm more so
151.00s: pointing at is that there's been a lot
152.36s: of underlying Market rotation going on
155.56s: that leads to us having to think about
159.20s: how to position risk and we actually
161.08s: talked about this literally yesterday on
163.20s: the live stream about pairing down risk
166.28s: not because I expected today to be
168.40s: terrible I didn't know but because I
172.00s: have to evaluate the market from a
174.20s: basian statistical standpoint which is
177.32s: I'm updating my mental model as new
179.48s: information comes in and then I'm making
181.68s: an assessment how much what's the
184.60s: probability of a x% up move compared to
187.88s: what's the probability of a wide percent
189.64s: down move and when the market starts
191.72s: getting to levels like this you kind of
194.32s: have to favor the downside a little bit
196.48s: just because once you get to these
198.68s: parabolic highs and then you come into
200.80s: news like this even if the FED executed
205.88s: perfectly we probably wouldn't have seen
208.72s: an inverse positive move to the degree
211.44s: that we saw on a downside move which
214.04s: wasn't even on terrible news essentially
217.04s: what happened today is the Fed did
219.32s: exactly what everybody thought the Fed
221.92s: was going to do which is cut 25 basis
224.64s: points easy day we all saw that coming
227.68s: from a mile away now the thing that
230.00s: started freaking the market out was the
232.48s: FED is saying that they might be slowing
234.84s: down a little bit and that is really
238.68s: important and again the interesting part
241.08s: about this is I I'm shocked that anybody
244.48s: would have expected any other news I
246.56s: think a lot of us were originally
248.52s: expecting a pause after the first 50
250.92s: bips cut so we have 50 bips cut which is
253.60s: opening heavy then we're coming up on
255.84s: this next cut that was moderate and but
261.40s: both of those backto back typically
264.12s: wouldn't occur without a pause at some
266.32s: point so I think the market now is
268.80s: trying to figure out when they think the
270.36s: pause might come and what that might
271.80s: look like so we can grab that really
274.20s: quick and take a look at it together and
276.52s: see what the next cycle might look like
280.44s: and this is really important to track by
282.76s: the way so this is showing in
285.76s: overwhelming probability of a pause on
288.80s: the Jan cycle now one of the things that
291.64s: I like to do is track how these Trend
296.48s: over time for the various meetings
298.48s: because it's really really interesting
300.20s: to me and we have to keep an eyeball now
303.52s: on the Jan meeting and see how the
306.56s: probability of no cut which is this
308.44s: green line right here Trends against the
311.16s: probability of a cut and obviously the
313.88s: cut that it's showing right now is very
316.12s: very small it's showing the probability
318.40s: of a 25 basis point cut there was even a
321.60s: slight probability of a potential raise
324.12s: which is super interesting so I think
327.20s: the market as it sits now understood
329.52s: that this is over likely overwhelmingly
332.00s: likely to be the case and you're seeing
335.28s: the market now overreacting in my
338.36s: opinion to what ended up being what the
341.84s: FED has been messaging especially from
343.52s: the context of being cautious and stuff
345.92s: like that the FED has been very direct
347.68s: about that so now if we take a quick
350.04s: look throughout the broad Market
351.80s: obviously we can see that the Spy had a
354.32s: not insignificant down day the q's had a
356.72s: slightly better day and then small caps
358.80s: really ran off a Cliff vix had a near
363.08s: parabolic climb we saw bonds roll over a
367.40s: little bit more Bitcoin about flat one
370.16s: of the things that Bitcoin is reacting
372.44s: to and trying to digest is the fed's
374.72s: relationship with Bitcoin and
376.52s: cryptocurrency at least as it sits today
379.12s: and then across the sectors this is the
380.96s: same thing we've been talking about
382.80s: literally for weeks now energy posting
385.52s: new lows on a 3-month time frame
387.28s: financials rolling over pretty heavy
389.04s: Industrial over now even the last
392.36s: Bastion of strength that we've seen
395.00s: between discretionary and that's now
398.88s: showing some weakness so literally
401.72s: across the board there was very few
403.84s: things today that were showing any bit
406.72s: of strength now we'll talk about
408.76s: GameStop in a second here but if we take
411.80s: a look at
412.84s: Nvidia Nvidia was a really interesting
416.48s: case today where it actually gapped up
419.88s: and it was holding on pretty well and
422.52s: then it ended up down on the day but
424.64s: this is relatively strong compared to a
427.56s: lot of the other stuff that we saw today
429.40s: and that's saying something that this is
431.44s: considered to be relative strength can't
433.60s: help but find that a bit interesting so
437.08s: if we take a look at SPX I want to show
439.40s: you the options chain here and SPX I
443.48s: mean 3% like a a pretty big day and if
448.20s: we jump into the option options chain
451.68s: here hop down to the
454.76s: bottom I want to show you the near term
457.72s: expiration so we can get rid of this
459.08s: let's go to the 20D and then let's look
462.52s: at the what do we want to do here let's
466.36s: take a look at the 17
468.80s: Jans and we can see that there's
471.12s: definitely heavier put oi which is very
474.84s: common for these indices and whatnot
476.48s: that's not surprising to me at all and
479.56s: let's take a look at the volume for
481.80s: today though and the reason why I want
484.08s: to see this is yeah and this is kind of
486.56s: what I was expecting just not excessive
489.20s: volume which tells me that the market
491.52s: isn't overreacting to what we're seeing
493.80s: so far at least it actually seems like
495.56s: the market to a
497.92s: degree had some ideas about what might
500.84s: happen and then let's take a look at the
502.24s: out of the money B and we can see for
504.76s: the 20D it's definitely elevated let's
507.68s: clear 20D out look at 17 Jan and 21 Feb
512.08s: and those look a little bit more normal
514.52s: a bit heavy put skew on the 17 Jans but
517.28s: not excessive that's also going to be
519.16s: the case just because it's going to be a
520.48s: really active chain right now so from an
523.16s: options perspective there's not a lot in
525.44s: here that's like this is crazy can't
527.60s: believe this it looks about part of the
530.12s: course we're still seeing some front V
533.48s: here and I anticipate that continuing
535.96s: until this gets priced in and we see
537.72s: what's going on Futures are up a little
539.12s: bit right right now so Futures aren't
542.16s: the the unhappy group of the bunch which
544.76s: is kind of interesting post post big
547.08s: days like this a lot of times you'll
548.60s: actually see small Futures reversals I
550.60s: actually had a couple trades on in
553.32s: Futures literally expecting these
555.28s: reversals because they tend to to slow
557.08s: down after the market closes when they
559.20s: accelerate that's when you know things
560.48s: are like really really bad which again
563.52s: isn't super common now let's take a look
565.92s: at what was showing strength today if we
568.80s: Pock up Pock up pop up the percent
571.60s: gainers for today we can see that what I
574.84s: like to do is look at the sectors that
576.72s: really pop up here and I'm seeing a lot
578.32s: of information technology um across the
581.12s: board interesting actually seeing
582.52s: tobacco showing up a little bit here and
585.68s: I see a little bit of Health Care uh
587.40s: what you could do to make this easier is
588.72s: to naturally filter it by um the the
592.48s: sector but you can see it's mostly it
595.20s: and then some healthcare and then
596.72s: there's a couple staples in here but not
598.44s: much so it's a bit of a mixed bag but it
602.36s: is a much smaller cohort because I'm not
604.60s: even filtering by options which is I TP
606.72s: which is what I typically would overlay
608.32s: this with and there's only 119 names in
611.16s: here that are popping up with um decent
613.84s: volume this is filtering some stuff out
616.80s: so there are elements of strength but
619.28s: it's mostly looking like it's within uh
621.96s: it all right so now let's take a quick
624.12s: look at GameStop because I was actually
625.48s: impressed with GameStop's movement today
628.04s: I again I know that this will be a bit
630.08s: of a bummer for a lot of people with it
632.00s: running above 30 and now it looks like
633.80s: it's closing down a little bit that's
635.84s: it's not ideal but again we have to take
638.16s: things in context and the context that
640.32s: we have right now is that the market is
642.68s: showing overall weakness and this is a
645.92s: small cap showing at least a little bit
648.88s: of resilience around this congestion
650.92s: area I think is again beneficial to it
654.32s: this is a consolidation phase and this
655.96s: is normal stocks need to do this what I
658.72s: didn't want to see today was a massive
661.00s: move down below some of these really
663.60s: what I would consider to be now more
665.56s: important price levels because this is
667.84s: where consensus of price starts to show
670.48s: and people still think that this is a
673.56s: high $20 stock which is really solid for
677.68s: where things sit now uh quick peek at
680.60s: the options chain and we still have
683.72s: incredible incredible call skew 840,000
687.28s: calls against 286 ,000 puts so just not
690.76s: even close the the calls are still super
693.36s: active here and again what's interesting
694.88s: is that most of this is out in 17 Jan so
698.20s: now if we take a quick peek at unusual
701.56s: whales and just see if there's any
704.16s: trades today that stick out to us so
706.36s: we'll go to today we'll have it calls
709.36s: and puts for now to start and let's uh
713.56s: Zoom this out a little bit so premiums
715.72s: on today were definitely heavy not a lot
719.72s: of really massive trades but a pretty
723.00s: fair number of Trades that were going
725.44s: out it looks like a a mix of positions
728.04s: we still have those 125s getting hit
730.80s: mostly on the put side and if you recall
734.00s: we actually had a pretty big load up on
736.16s: the put side not too long
738.28s: ago um something to the tune of a
741.72s: million and change almost 2 million so
745.44s: it wouldn't surprise me to see some of
747.28s: that being Unwound here um this this
749.84s: pretty big pretty big down day but the
754.48s: price levels that are holding on here
756.28s: are positive in my opinion as far as I'm
759.20s: concerned at least I think the last
761.92s: thing I want to show you is if we take a
765.36s: look at a flash round of some of the
768.00s: more meme stock common stuff for today
770.96s: so rocket Labs was down 133% paler was
776.64s: down 4% so really really solid day for
780.56s: paler holding in holding in on this so
784.16s: this is something I think to keep an
785.80s: eyeball on when stuff like this shows a
788.56s: little bit more resilience compared to
790.52s: other things um another one that's been
793.12s: interesting to watch is Ion q and bit of
796.44s: a Down dat today not catastrophic though
799.64s: and it's now at a point where again my
803.68s: guess is some of this stuff will have a
805.44s: continuation but this isn't that deep
807.92s: for all these different growth style
809.84s: names which again I think just bears
813.08s: that this is not the end of the world
815.44s: just yet but it is time to pay attention
818.12s: it's time to take a look at the risk
819.40s: make sure you have what you want so as
821.96s: always anything you want me to take a
823.24s: look at let me know be an outlier I'll
825.20s: see you guys later
