0.00s: How can you logically size your options trades? This video is designed to dive directly into that
6.72s: topic and to cover three main topics. Why you should care about this, the process that I use,
13.20s: and then some best practices at the end for you to consider, because like most things trading
19.12s: options, the devil's in the details. So if you want to apply a writ large, all trades are
25.76s: sized at 6%, you can do that. You're going to have issues with that for a bunch of different
31.68s: reasons, which I'll show you why. The other thing is if you just size off of how you feel,
37.44s: that's another set of issues, which we're going to talk about that as well. What's up everybody?
40.88s: Eric here. Welcome back to the outliers. Shout out to the Patreon family. Consider joining. And if
46.16s: not, you should at least hop in our free discord. It's another cool spot to hang out. Let's talk
50.64s: about this in a nutshell. So why are we doing this? Well, here's a deal. If we take a look at
55.92s: these different utilization levels, let's say you have a single strategy. And in that single strategy
62.08s: on Monday, in January, you size at 1%, then in February, 6%, that at the end of February, on
70.00s: a Thursday, it's 2%, stone and so forth. What I'm highlighting here is that if it is just a shotgun
75.92s: blast of sizing, there's nothing that you can logically project the performance. You could,
83.04s: rationally, come up with an average and then use that. The issue with that is you might find this 29%
90.16s: kind of scenario could actually lead to enough drawdown that you then couldn't put this trade on
95.44s: anymore. So you can't approach sizing trades haphazardly. So what does the process look like?
102.08s: For me, I try to keep it straightforward. I start with looking at the portfolio as you probably
107.44s: would imagine. Now, when I'm doing this, I'm making sure that I'm defining the objectives for what
115.20s: I'm looking to add. What this means is if your goal is to aggressively grow your portfolio, guess what
122.16s: that means? You probably need to use most of it most of the time. You do not have the luxury
127.44s: of sitting 30% cash waiting for things to pop up. Again, depending on your trading style, maybe that
133.92s: actually does fit in, which will get into it a little bit. But in general, if you're trying to
137.92s: aggressively grow your portfolio, you have to be pretty aggressive with your utilization. Same
141.76s: thing with the subsequent sizing of your positions. And it's the inverse is true if you're looking
148.16s: to reduce variance in your portfolio returns. Then maybe you're not sizing things quite as large
154.48s: because you want to keep more on the side so that you're not experiencing the same variance.
159.76s: This is why after you look at your portfolio, defining these objectives is a non-negotiable part
165.44s: of the process. Once we do that, this is when I actually start the process of sizing a position.
173.92s: And it's relatively straightforward. I'm going to start by looking at how this trade fits into
179.36s: a portfolio. I'm going to understand what my hypothesis is for this trade. What the corresponding
185.92s: strategy is from there. This will lead me to however much money I'm going to allocate to the
193.60s: position. And I have an example that walks through this to give you some numbers to help you follow
198.80s: along and create your own ideas from the allocation. So let's say I have a strategy that's going to get
204.80s: 10% of my money. Then I'm going to look at the initial outlay. So of this allocation,
210.88s: I'm going to set aside X number of dollars for this trade in its entirety. Then I'm going to say
215.76s: of this amount of money, I'm going to use a smaller subset up front to gain my initial exposure.
222.56s: Then I'm going to keep some residual amount of money so that I can add more risk to the strategy
229.36s: based on whatever that strategy is. Again, we'll get into a couple examples in just a minute.
234.48s: Once I finish this process, I'm going to then validate whatever I came up with. This means I'm going
241.44s: to review the allocation. I'm going to review the corresponding strategy. Make sure it fits with
247.44s: my disposition towards the stock market. Make sure that it fits within the portfolio and what else
252.48s: is in the portfolio. I want to make sure that I have one final sanity check. So this is the process
259.12s: in a nutshell. Now the natural question is, okay, well then how much should we allocate
263.92s: per trade? How much should we use in an outlay? How much should we set aside for scaling?
270.08s: And these are important questions. So let's take a look at a sample portfolio. In this case,
274.32s: we have a $100,000 proverbial portfolio. I split my portfolio into two buckets. You do not have
280.96s: to do this. So I bring that up front so that you understand the lens I'm applying here. I have a
286.24s: core allocation and a speculative allocation to my portfolios. If this concept is completely foreign to
291.76s: you, I will throw a link in the notes below that walks through this, but it doesn't really matter.
296.96s: You can literally get rid of this in its entirety if you were so inclined. And you could just say,
302.48s: I have a $100,000 portfolio. Then you can determine how you want to size positions off of that.
307.52s: There's a couple things to keep in mind. Now for me, for the core allocation of a portfolio,
313.60s: I tend to accept larger position sizes. So this is using a generic answer. Up to 70% of the
322.88s: portfolio can be in the core of that 70% all of it can be into one position if I am so inclined.
331.20s: This is not 70% of the 70%. I'm using it as a total of the portfolio to keep this easier to
338.00s: follow along for everybody. So what does this mean? Well, this means that if I'm trading something like
342.64s: the coverage triangle in IWM, I might allocate all $70,000 of the core allocation to it. I might.
350.64s: You don't have to do that. You can find whatever numbers make sense for you. This is how I tend to split
355.60s: the portfolio between core and speculative. If I were not to do this, then I would treat most of
362.16s: the positions as speculative. There's a couple ways you have to think about this and the way that I
367.52s: tend to apply sizing. If I'm meeting my return objectives with the core allocation, I will give
373.68s: this more money. If I'm not meaning, let's say IWM is not doing well or if the market's going down
380.16s: and the coverage strangle are not performing well, then I'm going to size up the speculative
385.68s: allocation of the portfolio. In this case, I might juice this up to 60% of the portfolio and keep
393.12s: the remainder in the core. You have to find what metrics make sense for you. In general, I want to
399.28s: try to keep as much capital as I possibly can in the core allocation because it gives me the most
405.52s: amount of flexibility depending on what the market's choosing to do. Now, another caveat. If I'm
410.88s: trying to aggressively grow my portfolio, I'm going to bump this 70% down. This might be up to 60%,
418.72s: but it might generally run around 30% something like that. You have to figure out the way you try to
425.28s: split your portfolio. In this case, going with this example, if we have $70,000 allocated to IWM,
433.20s: let's say the initial outlay is $35,000 half of the position, then I'm using that residual
440.16s: capital, the remaining $35,000 and I'm going to look at IWM every time it makes a 5% move up or down,
447.76s: a 10% move up or down, whatever your strategy calls for. But this scaling piece is really important
454.16s: as well as this outlay. Here's how I think about it. If I'm allocating $70,000 and I have a very
460.16s: strong conviction in my trade, meaning I want to maximize as much of my exposure to the trade hypothesis
467.60s: as possible, this outlay can be up to 100%. I could put all of the money out there if I want
473.68s: right up front. What's the downside? You lose the ability to scale both to the upside and to the
479.36s: downside. So with something like a covered strangle, we're adding risk as things go down similar to
484.56s: dollar cost averaging. That becomes problematic, so I tend not to do that with something like the
489.36s: covered strangle. And if you're curious about how I run finances for this strategy by itself,
494.00s: I will throw a link in the video below. Now, let's say you're not looking to split your portfolio
499.76s: out into corn speculative. Don't worry, I got you. Let's take a look at if we had speculative
505.76s: trades only. So in this case, I have position set to be up to 10%. This is again a generality.
513.92s: I definitely would not want speculative positions exceeding 15%. When I'm sizing things, I try to give
521.12s: myself room. Again, this is up to 70% up to 15%. That means in general, I'm going to look to size
528.88s: about 10%. Some people might look at that and say, wow, that's like really large for an individual
533.36s: position. It could be for you. Maybe you're better off looking at something like 5%. Here's the thing
538.88s: you have to consider. When you're trading something like short premium strategies, there's a difference
545.92s: between what the margin requirement is and what the value at risk is. That's an example we'll get
552.32s: into in a minute. Here, when I'm looking at this, these are both strategies that are going to use
556.88s: most of the money upfront. So for me, I'm looking to find a balance. If you size things too small,
564.48s: you have to put on a bunch of stuff that might be okay for the way you trade. That might be a headache
570.64s: again, depending on how you trade. So this number in general, it's going to be variable based on what
576.24s: you're looking for. So when we look at then, perhaps adding another position. So we have this Tesla
582.96s: ratio called diagonal, this thing's out and running its bullish and you want to get bullish in
587.12s: Nvidia as well. How do we think about the sizing of that? If you'll remember, we need to look at
591.92s: the portfolio because Tesla and Nvidia behave very much like one another. They're very correlated.
599.20s: So am I going to use the maximum allocation for position sizing in this instance? If I already
605.84s: have something that's behaving quite like it, maybe if that's the exposure I want, maybe not.
611.44s: If I want to diversify my exposure a bit more, the important thing to take away from looking at
617.52s: these different kinds of strategies is you have to strike that balance. You need enough money working
622.80s: in order to meet your portfolio objectives, but you also need to diversify your risk profile to the
629.04s: degree that you want. If you don't do that and you have a bad market move against you, you might have
636.64s: all your position size that 5%, but if they all act like one another, it doesn't really matter.
642.96s: That means, essentially, you're using all of your account in one kind of position that behaves like
649.52s: one single position. That's a problem. That's why the portfolio review section of this is so freaking
656.88s: important. Now, to help tie some of these concepts together, I want to give you some specific
662.56s: details to consider. The first one is in the beginning, contrary to what your girlfriend might
668.56s: tell you smaller is better when you're first starting to trade options when you're first starting to
675.20s: roll out strategies. But then again, you still have to get to a point where you are trading at your
680.96s: scale, whatever your corresponding scale is. The other thing is sometimes you will hear people refer
687.12s: to options in stock position sizing as the same thing. They're not. If we check out Apple here,
694.24s: which is trading at 187, if you buy 100 shares of Apple, you're going to take up 18,739 bucks in
702.72s: this instance. You can put on a similar, notional value position using way less money with options.
710.24s: Let's say for example, we buy this deep in the money 91 delta call at 155. This means you're
716.80s: controlling $15,500 worth of Apple using 35 hundred bucks. So when you buy this position, do we use
726.64s: the 15,500 or the 3500? Well, depends on the way you think about this. But for me, I would be using
734.08s: the actual capital I have committed to the trade. Now, there's an inverse scenario. Let's say you choose
740.32s: sell a put in Apple and let's say you come in here to the 27 delta 180. Well, in this scenario,
748.00s: I have portfolio margin. You'll see that the margin requirement is only 1800 bucks. But technically,
753.20s: the max loss is undefined all the way down to zero. So your loss potential is way more than the
759.04s: $1800. So in this kind of scenario, if you're using an undefined risk trade, me, I think the best
765.68s: practical scenario is to define the risk. So in this case, based on your trading plan and your
771.52s: strategy outlines, which you have as Apple falls below your strike, if this is a cash secured put,
779.44s: you'll say, okay, well, then I would buy this option. That means I need the money to buy 100 shares
786.00s: at $180. If that's not what you want to do, you need to define a period that you either would
792.16s: hedge the position via short shares, or you need to find a point that you would exit for the
797.44s: position at a loss. And you need to define that before you enter your trade, that will give you
802.56s: your value at risk. There are some downsides here because markets can move. The value at risk you
808.16s: are postulating is saying, if I intervene, I would be able to do it at this point, which you may
813.92s: or may not be able to do it exactly at that point. So you have to give it some slack. Next up, we have
819.36s: this idea of expected return. This is a guiding concept. The reason why expected return is so
825.12s: important is because it lets us see how a system will perform in the long run, which is another
832.24s: consideration for you is that you have to consider both individual trades and systematic returns.
839.60s: What does that mean? Well, if you have a trade that's so big that one loss can erase your account,
846.40s: but in the long run, it looks like it would make money. It doesn't matter because you have so much
850.64s: value at risk that one losing position can completely detract your ability for any future returns.
857.28s: So you have to think about that, but you also have to balance it with the systematic returns.
861.84s: Because if you have a process that returns a modest amount of money, you might say,
866.88s: eh, this doesn't look that great. But then if you project it out over a long enough time frame,
870.72s: it starts to make a lot of sense. So when we're doing this kind of thought process and sizing things,
876.24s: one of the concepts to remember is the sequence of returns. What do you expect to see? So in this
881.36s: case, I'm giving you guys a chart, a reference chart. The number of consecutive losses is here on the
887.44s: Y axis, and then the X axis is the probability of a win. So what's the probability of having five
894.32s: consecutive losses with a 60% chance of winning 1%. So this means that you can look at whatever strategy
902.24s: you're running, look at the average losing size of that strategy. And you say, okay, there's a 1%
908.56s: chance I could lose five in a row. How much would I lose if I lost five in a row? And you can do
912.56s: some math to figure out if you can withstand draw downs based on the probability of experiencing
918.16s: consecutive losses. We already talked about correlation. This has to be baked into your system.
923.84s: We also need to think about what kind of move we're trying to trade and how much risk we're
929.28s: taking to get there. For example, if you are risking $10,000 to make a 50 cent move, expected
936.16s: return will tell you that doesn't make sense. So both of these are tied intimately with one another.
943.28s: And this also will inform how you think about your initial outlay and then your scaling protocols.
949.84s: If you're deploying something that has a tight stop in those instances, I tend to size up more
956.40s: because my value at risk is constrained. If I'm trying to give something more room to breathe
962.16s: and I'm trying following, I'm going to decrease how much money I give that trade because I'm
967.68s: expecting more variance in the trade. At the end of the day, you have to make it make sense.
972.96s: What this means is in this example, if we have a $100,000 account, we want a 15% return per year,
978.24s: but we only allow ourselves 1% positions and we're managing those at 50% saying that they're short
984.48s: premium strategies. Well, that's going to give you $1,000 per trade. You're going to have to put on
988.96s: a bunch of them, right? 1,000 if we're trying to get this 15%, you're going to have to put on at
994.72s: least 50 of them probably more. This puts you in these crappy little trades that you're making 45
1000.80s: bucks over 20 days. This gives you $540 a year. What I'm highlighting in this instance is that it
1006.56s: doesn't make sense. Based on your size and your return objectives, this sizing doesn't make sense.
1012.32s: So you have to think through your strategies what the average wins and losses are and you have
1016.80s: to make it make sense. Otherwise, you're just putting stuff out there and you're not going to follow
1022.56s: it because innately you know it doesn't make sense. So think carefully about the way you size your
1028.64s: positions, give them money, but not too much money. Always control the risk, whether it's structurally
1035.44s: via buying options or including stops or hedges. If you consider all of that, you're going to
1042.00s: size your positions way smarter. Be an outlier, like subscribe share. See you guys later.
