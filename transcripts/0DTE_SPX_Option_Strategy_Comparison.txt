0.00s: today I want to talk about how you can
2.64s: create a zero DTE SPX option strategy
6.42s: that actually makes money we're going to
8.64s: look at a couple examples up front of
10.80s: two sides of the same coin very
12.60s: different experiences and then we're
14.22s: going to go through some data and at the
15.72s: end of the video I want to walk you
17.22s: through some very specific tips and
19.32s: tricks so what's up everybody welcome
21.72s: back to all the outliers shout out to
23.22s: the patreon family thank you guys for
25.20s: the support you make content like this
26.94s: possible and if what I do helps you in
29.40s: any way consider signing up it helps me
31.92s: out a bunch Link in the notes below ah
36.48s: yes two sides of the same exact
41.88s: coin on the left hand side we have 18
44.94s: year old meets zero DTE spy puts and in
50.40s: a single day they grew their account
54.98s: 124.3 percent that looks pretty good to
58.20s: me then we have well the other side zero
62.10s: DTE Lotto trades gone wrong not sure how
65.46s: I'm going to recover from this and for
67.74s: this person over it looks like I have no
71.10s: idea what the time frame for is for this
73.14s: it's obviously not within a day it says
75.90s: all time and they're down 82 202 and a
80.64s: nickel which is essentially 100 of their
83.82s: account
85.46s: all right all right two very different
88.68s: experiences what's going on here well
90.90s: I'm gonna give you some quick excerpts
93.06s: from a recent video I did that really
95.82s: Dives deep into the world of zero DTE
98.34s: options and if you want to check that
101.64s: video out I'll throw a link to that in
103.02s: the notes below it's really good context
104.64s: this video is going to dive way more
106.32s: into actually analyzing individual
108.48s: strategies so slight different scope but
110.82s: what I want to show you three things
112.44s: quickly left hand side this essentially
115.02s: just means zero DTE volume is increasing
117.84s: exponentially this here shows you the
120.78s: average p l profitability of zero dte's
123.84s: small traders meaning mostly retail and
126.72s: essentially there was a period where we
128.70s: were doing well that starts kind of in
131.52s: December of 21 definitely through 2022
134.64s: and then since then it's turned negative
137.16s: there's net and gross that means gross
140.28s: is obviously The Upfront returns and the
142.98s: net is once we induce friction
144.96s: commission slippage so on and so forth
147.30s: all I'm highlighting here is that
148.86s: slippage is a big deal cost is a big
150.78s: deal then down here we have a quick
152.70s: summary of the profitability of zero DTE
154.98s: trades and essentially it says we
157.02s: document that retail Traders
158.28s: consistently lose money especially after
160.56s: transaction costs which is what I just
162.18s: showed you up here while they correctly
163.98s: incorporate the overall level of
165.90s: expensiveness of zero DTE options in
168.30s: their decision to buy or sell they fail
170.34s: to outperform the Hefty spreads what
172.50s: people don't realize is it's actually
173.82s: very expensive for us to trade these and
175.98s: it's because you are confused by the
178.62s: zero dollar commissions you think you
180.78s: see up front when really your game
182.58s: you're paying for all of that on the
184.02s: back end which again the zero DTE option
186.18s: video that I have goes through that in
187.62s: detail so what I want to walk through
189.90s: now though is actually a strategy
192.12s: comparison so I am affiliated with my
194.76s: friends over at options Omega because I
196.92s: think that they really give a decent
199.08s: platform for somebody that doesn't want
200.88s: to manage their own data to take a look
202.68s: at options they didn't sponsor this
204.24s: video outright I'm literally just doing
205.80s: it because I like to Tinker with their
207.30s: tool from once in a while however I do
209.34s: have a discount code for it if you want
211.20s: to sign up there's a link in the notes
212.82s: below for that as well but to make this
215.76s: a little more easily consumable as
217.50s: compared to showing you a bunch of these
219.48s: individual kind of screenshots I'm going
221.52s: to show you kind of um some synopsis
224.22s: data that I threw into a Google sheet so
227.46s: what we're looking at is a 100 000
229.62s: prospective portfolio we're doing one
232.68s: Lots in SPX and we're doing short this
235.80s: shouldn't be strangle actually this
237.00s: should be straddle that's the wrong word
238.32s: we're doing short straddles so 50 Delta
241.20s: call 50 Delta put and this top analysis
244.14s: is looking from one Jan 2021 to 19 Aug
247.26s: 2023 however we have a second analysis
251.34s: that has even better results than this
253.98s: one and I want to talk to you about why
255.72s: that is but first let's take a look at
258.00s: our initial results so the well that
260.82s: just got rid of everything that didn't
262.02s: look at nothing did it yes it did so the
264.90s: very top line you see here is the entry
266.70s: time these are all zero DTE and we have
269.46s: profit Loss Management this is where
271.68s: we're expecting to manage the trade and
273.48s: then we have different trade metrics
274.74s: over here now the very top line here is
277.92s: simply expiration this means we're not
279.78s: applying any profit or Loss Management
281.94s: we're putting on the trade letting it
283.80s: expire the p l of that is negative 46
288.06s: 000 again from 21 2021 to 2023. the
292.38s: compound annual growth rate negative 21
294.06s: you can kind of get through the rest of
295.86s: the detail on yourself but a couple of
297.72s: things that we really want to key into
298.86s: to obviously p l kagger drawdown win
302.28s: rate is less important which you'll kind
304.14s: of find out in a little bit but we
305.76s: definitely like average p l so not doing
308.70s: anything clearly was not successful over
311.40s: this time frame okay then I started
314.04s: isolating looking at the profit side or
317.16s: the Lost side or a combination thereof
319.80s: so if we managed at 25 50 and 75 percent
324.42s: max profit these are your results and
326.76s: you'll notice that the only profitable
328.68s: outcome here was managing profits at 25
331.50s: percent again that's leaving losses to
333.84s: their own devices letting them run
335.52s: wherever they're going to be this is an
337.86s: important note that will carry over as
340.32s: we move into the next segment of data
343.02s: which is now looking at the loss side so
345.90s: in these next couple scenarios we're
348.90s: leaving the profits to their own meaning
351.30s: we're not managing those but we are
353.64s: managing at 25 50 and 75 percent max
357.18s: profit and you can see here here that if
359.94s: we're managing losses at 25 percent max
362.70s: loss that that actually was the best
365.22s: overall p l for this scenario up top
369.24s: here and we saw a 14 kagger in 18.9
374.72s: drawdown Max a 34 or I'm sorry 37.8 win
380.40s: rate so overall pretty insignificant win
383.10s: rate and this means we're taking a lot
385.50s: of small losing trades so the average p
388.38s: l although it's positive it's not super
390.90s: impressive here but the average wins are
393.00s: given room to run the losses are managed
395.64s: pretty carefully then I want to show you
397.80s: this next bucket 25 managed at profit 25
401.66s: managed at loss essentially what I did
404.52s: to test this is I just took the best of
406.80s: both scenarios I said okay 25 Max profit
410.34s: did the best on the profit side 25 Max
414.00s: loss did the best on Lost side how does
416.40s: this do and arguably this low looks
419.52s: pretty good compared to the rest
420.90s: Although our p l is slightly less as
423.54s: well as her kagger our Max drawdown is
426.00s: much less this serves as a jump point
429.06s: for other analysis which I'll get into
431.76s: in just a little bit on how we can think
433.80s: about this information but before that
436.08s: if any of this shocks you let me know in
439.74s: the comments below because there's
440.94s: actually a couple things here that did
442.38s: surprise me genuinely and one of which
444.84s: is I was surprised that letting the
447.60s: profits run more actually hurt us so bad
450.90s: which it's also important to take into
453.00s: account the market conditions that we
454.62s: were seeing in 2021 to 2023 but still
457.44s: nonetheless volatility is kind of an
459.60s: important input here and as you could
461.40s: tell I'm obviously doing this video
463.02s: shirtless so my zero DTE trades are
466.02s: forcing me to start in only fans page
468.00s: which that's not going well either so
469.56s: hard to figure out my next thing maybe
471.36s: that Wendy's dumpster with all the other
473.40s: Wall Street bets degenerates is on my
475.14s: to-do list however the main point here
477.66s: is this over overall didn't perform as
480.24s: well as I thought it would I really
481.68s: thought that this would have worked
482.88s: better as a typical strategy here and
486.06s: the last thing I want to show you in
487.44s: this bucket is this which is just
489.66s: managing it one hour so I just picked a
492.24s: random time frame as compared to any
494.22s: sort of percent p l and that did not do
497.16s: super well so there's a bunch of reasons
499.44s: why this is the case and there's
501.00s: actually some really interesting further
503.04s: analysis that I'm gonna overlay on this
506.28s: if you guys are interested if the video
508.86s: gets enough likes then I will happily
511.74s: continue to build this out with more and
513.72s: more data specifically using the options
516.24s: Omega stuff because you guys can
517.38s: replicate that
519.24s: you got me
521.10s: but some of this aligns neatly with my
524.22s: own data set but I like also integrating
527.16s: some of these random stuff that I
529.14s: actually don't use in my data set like
530.76s: our management but there was nothing too
533.34s: noteworthy here now what I want to take
535.62s: a look at though is kind of this next
537.42s: bucket instead of going from one Jan
540.42s: 2021 to 19 August 2023 this looks at 13
544.20s: May 2022 to 19 August 2023. what's the
547.74s: difference here this is actually when
550.08s: daily expirations and SPX were launched
553.32s: well actually technically it was the
555.42s: 11th of May but I did the 13th just to
558.12s: give it a couple days for the liquidity
559.68s: to find itself and notice how much
562.44s: better the performance of nearly all of
565.26s: these buckets are even though some of
568.08s: these have lower P L's look at the max
571.32s: drawdowns in comparison if I take a look
573.90s: at the same exact Top Line trade here
576.12s: where we just put on the short straddle
578.76s: and let it go and do nothing in that
581.82s: scenario we're not only positive but our
585.00s: Max drawdown is only 17.6 so the
588.24s: drawdowns here are much less part of
590.46s: this is because of the time frame the
592.32s: market in 2022 the tail half was pretty
594.48s: strong it stopped going through its you
596.94s: know overall aggressive adjustment phase
599.10s: but the other thing is we now have a lot
602.04s: of occurrences whereas in this case
604.14s: before every single day there was an
606.54s: expiration we were tailored to a smaller
609.90s: data set relative to the time span we
612.36s: were in so a couple other things I want
614.58s: to highlight here quickly managing the
616.74s: loss in all of these scenarios is
619.26s: clearly important the best compound
621.54s: annual growth rates you see in all of
623.94s: these different scenarios comes with
625.86s: loss management now in the future I will
629.40s: show you a much better way to manage
632.70s: losses than using a stop the problem
635.10s: with using stops in stuff like this is
637.68s: the market moves around and a lot of
639.60s: times you actually get kicked out of of
641.40s: a trade that otherwise comes back into
644.40s: profit and that's not good so we want to
647.10s: talk about things like iron flies next
649.86s: if you're interested in trading these
651.90s: with a smaller account so that we can
654.12s: avoid using stops where we can but that
657.54s: will be in the next video so if you have
660.60s: any questions comments concerns throw
662.22s: them in the comments below let me know
663.72s: what you thought if this kind of
665.28s: information is helpful for you and if it
666.90s: is we can talk about some other things
668.46s: to do in the future be an outlier I'll
670.74s: see you guys later
