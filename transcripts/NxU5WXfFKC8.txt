0.00s: Hey everyone, Eric here with a very quick small stack portfolio update.
5.60s: I established a position in Pfizer that I think is pretty well positioned.
12.16s: I do think that it's going to be a little tough to manage in the small stack portfolio.
18.64s: I actually have it replicated in my margin account at a larger scale that I intend to
25.16s: manage a little differently and more actively.
27.96s: But nonetheless, I do like Pfizer here and I like them as a long term product.
32.88s: So that's why I entered into a call diagonal.
37.52s: So let's take a look at Pfizer first and kind of where they're at and then we'll jump
43.20s: over to the portfolio.
45.16s: So in general, Pfizer for the last two years has been coming down.
49.36s: If we zoom out to the last five years, it's still up trending and we see them between
54.76s: the mid and minus one standard deviation channel, which all sounds kind of part for the
60.52s: course.
61.68s: And then I see them approaching the minus one standard DV panel here.
65.32s: Now one of the reasons why I'm willing to get long here is I absolutely expect there
72.00s: to be a little bit more downside.
74.04s: But if you take a look at it, it's really not that large of a dollar value.
78.44s: So we're going to look at essentially 36 down to 33 to get to the minus two standard
83.52s: deviation.
84.60s: And more over than that is as soon as I can exit my XLE position, which is short puts, I'll
91.72s: have up, I'll have some recapital that I can apply to this trade that, you know, average
98.72s: my basis a bit and scale into the trade, which is 100% by my plan.
104.64s: A few notes.
105.64s: This is a, in my opinion, typically a very risky trade because we see the nine day moving
112.20s: average essentially is going to close before the 50 very shortly.
116.72s: And then we see price dropped below the 50 and the 200 day.
121.92s: That's typically not a good thing.
123.72s: However, I have a longer term perspective in this trade.
128.12s: So that's why I'm willing to place it anyways despite some of the technical indications
134.20s: that, you know, indicate to me, there might be a little bit of chop coming up.
140.24s: That's okay.
141.24s: I am definitely in this for the longer haul.
146.28s: So let's take a quick look at the portfolio and what we have going on.
151.84s: So first off, we still have X11 Zingua.
156.04s: Both of those positions are expiring on the second and the ninth of October respectively.
161.48s: So still not doing anything in either of these.
166.08s: XLF, pull that up quickly, is essentially hanging out very, very close to my basis.
174.36s: But I still don't really see any sort of necessary adjustment to be done in there.
180.32s: We will leave that one alone.
181.88s: And then if we pull up Zingua, we see that that is just below my $8.50 basis.
191.96s: So I will leave that on at least for a while longer so that I can bleed out some more
198.72s: of the extrinsic value and then we'll go from there.
201.88s: So neither one of these are in any sort of position that I feel like I need to manage
206.16s: aggressively.
207.68s: Then we have Kroger.
210.52s: And Kroger right now still looks good.
213.68s: I don't have any adjustments to making there.
216.48s: We're short.
217.72s: The 36 call currently.
220.36s: So if I pull this up, we're short the 36, which is obviously looking completely fine right
227.20s: now with the product at 3462.
229.92s: Now this may be a situation where in the next day or so, I may close out that short call.
235.60s: Because if you remember, it's pretty short time frame.
238.28s: I have that expiring on the, I'm sorry, this one's on the ninth of October.
243.88s: So this one is a little bit longer.
245.48s: I was thinking about the prior trade.
247.76s: I might take this off before earnings for a small profit and then establish a new position
253.84s: closer to the current basis because it'll still be above my critical strike and capitalize
259.80s: on that earnings increase in volatility right out another shorter term trade and then establish
265.16s: a new longer term position.
267.24s: So that's what I'm looking at in Kroger.
269.60s: And then in Pfizer right now, I established a one to one ratio.
277.00s: And I just realized I mixed up the positions in Kroger were short the 36, not the 36,
283.32s: 36 is in Pfizer, sorry.
286.44s: And then in Pfizer, I'm long the 28 call that is expiring 16 July 21.
294.28s: And I paid 8.54 it and then I am short the nine October 36.
301.72s: The reason why I did that is in my small stacks account, I went a little further out than
309.60s: I did in my margin account.
311.56s: And I also made sure to essentially try to collect as much money as I can.
316.96s: I like to trade these at a ratio, which doesn't cap my upside.
322.72s: But this is what trading a small account is all about.
326.60s: So I think making sure that when I can scaling into the trade, purchasing another leap so
333.68s: that my upside is not capped is certainly the goal once I figure up some capital.
338.12s: But for the time being, this is just how it goes trading these smaller accounts.
342.20s: So that's why I favored setting the short call a little further out in time so I can collect
349.52s: a little bit more money.
351.24s: The overall trade is honestly really well structured.
354.48s: It's over a 16% return on invested capital.
358.04s: I put up 8.50 and I took in 138.
361.16s: It's really just a well, well set trade.
365.16s: So we will see how this one plays out.
368.00s: I definitely like Pfizer longer term and it's involvement with COVID.
372.60s: I think there's a lot of potential there.
374.96s: And as kind of how I've been, I'll continue updating the portfolio as I make different
380.58s: moves.
381.58s: If anybody has any questions on anything I'm doing, feel free to drop me a line.
386.50s: This is definitely a revisit for me.
389.82s: I haven't traded a small account for some time.
393.54s: And it is an interesting intellectual challenge that oddly enough, I welcome because I view
400.66s: these accounts as puzzles.
402.50s: You have to have the right pieces that fit together to make sure that you aren't putting
407.54s: this account in a bad spot.
409.66s: One of the things I'm very careful about is the correlation.
413.30s: And the correlation in a lot of these products is very low and that's by design.
417.38s: It's offering me some sort of inherent diversification in case one certain group takes a hit, not
423.30s: all of them necessarily take the same scale of hit.
427.22s: And that is very purposefully by design.
430.62s: So right now, total utilization on the account is 98.84%, we're almost completely utilized.
437.98s: We have $4,942 that is currently committed.
445.98s: We do have a realized gain of $64.
448.50s: So realistically, my capital is 5,064.
452.22s: I just didn't bother inputting that yet.
455.22s: But my utilization is most certainly pretty high.
460.02s: So that is all good.
462.86s: That's what I expect to see in a smaller account.
466.50s: Now as the market starts to capitulate, maybe time to sit out for a while and just let
470.94s: the trades work because I do not want to start aggressively trading these and building
476.18s: up losses.
477.18s: It's one of the main goals I have to avoid in this account.
480.10s: But I have no problem taking assignment on either X, Zingha and just holding it for
485.86s: very much as long as I need to because I like both of those products long term to the
489.02s: upside.
490.38s: And we'll kind of play it out, see what the market shows us.
493.90s: So as always, anything you want me to talk about or any questions?
497.74s: Let me know and I will catch you really later.
