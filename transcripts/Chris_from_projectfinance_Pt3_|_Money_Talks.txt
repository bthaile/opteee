2.48s: all right man we're live chris what's up
4.08s: man
5.36s: how much how you doing doing awesome
7.20s: thank you i always love like the the
8.96s: video intro after the
11.36s: introduction conversation that goes on
13.36s: for 10 minutes they're always good
15.36s: um but as always super stoked to have a
17.52s: conversation with you i really enjoy
19.68s: your perspective we were talking a
20.72s: little bit about that i think that's one
22.00s: of the the funnest parts about having
23.76s: you on the channel is a chance to offer
26.96s: at least my side of the house a
28.80s: completely different perspective on a
30.16s: lot of things even though i do think
32.16s: that a lot of the basis of where we
34.72s: approach the market is pretty similar so
37.36s: um with that being said
39.92s: i would love to start with kind of that
42.32s: first conversation we were just talking
43.68s: about
44.48s: something that the
45.84s: my my viewers in general are curious
48.24s: about and rightfully slow is just the
50.72s: idea of inflation when we first started
53.68s: seeing it happen it seemed like the fed
55.84s: was really into it being more transitory
58.16s: you know something that's not
59.04s: necessarily super persistent they didn't
60.96s: want to necessarily have a big hand in
63.12s: it those kinds of things but we'd love
65.04s: to hear you know just your general
66.56s: thoughts on it don't need to go into any
68.08s: specific detail you know on policy or
70.72s: anything like that but just your
72.32s: thoughts on inflation environment right
74.00s: now and then more importantly what it
75.76s: looks like you know maybe for the next
77.52s: six months
79.44s: um
80.80s: that's a really difficult question first
82.32s: of all i'm not a i'm not a macroeconomic
84.88s: expert by any means
86.48s: but um i i do listen to a lot of
88.48s: podcasts and
90.32s: one thing that i've
92.32s: basically the general message that i've
94.00s: picked up from all the conversations
95.52s: that i've looked at is that everyone
97.52s: kind of has their own specific inflation
99.68s: rate
102.24s: but
102.96s: one of the big things to point out i
104.80s: think is
106.64s: when we started to see the high
108.16s: inflation prints a lot of people were
110.00s: saying that it was from the base effect
111.92s: which is basically like if you look at a
114.48s: year prior to the current readings
117.12s: when
117.92s: um inflation was super low and then you
120.32s: go a year forward and prices are
122.00s: normalizing the the disparity between
124.64s: those numbers
126.16s: gets distorted because you're comparing
128.40s: a high number to like the low point
130.32s: right now we're gonna pass that and the
132.64s: cpi number
134.32s: um i think it's around like five percent
136.32s: right now
137.44s: which is obviously really high all i
140.00s: know generally is um
143.04s: inflation
144.56s: and the
146.48s: super low rate environment that we have
148.00s: right now basically forces everybody
149.92s: into
150.88s: higher risk positions right
153.44s: any chance whatsoever at having a
155.44s: positive return right
157.60s: so for me
159.92s: just seeing the higher levels of
161.20s: inflation and even like the fear of
163.04s: higher inflation going forward
165.28s: that's pushing more people into
167.60s: things like the stock market uh real
170.32s: estate and crypto i think are like the
173.04s: three big things i i would say gold but
175.12s: gold is down this year yeah
177.04s: interestingly um i actually think it's
179.52s: very interesting that gold's down eight
181.28s: percent this year
182.80s: and gold is supposed to be the inflation
185.68s: hedge right so like
187.12s: when inflation starts to pick up
189.36s: gold is supposed to be the asset that
190.96s: everyone turns to
192.80s: to protect their purchasing power right
195.76s: and gold is actually down this year so
198.40s: yeah it started what at like 1960
200.72s: something and now it's like hovering
202.48s: right around 18. um
204.40s: i'm looking at gld right now so gld
206.32s: started the year at 180 182 and now it's
209.52s: at 168.
211.04s: so if you parked your money in gold
214.32s: then you're down 8 but if you
216.72s: parked your money in digital gold aka
218.72s: bitcoin you're up 100
220.56s: so i think a little bit of that could be
222.72s: a rotation
224.24s: out of gold and into bitcoin
227.12s: um
228.32s: do you think they serve the same purpose
229.84s: to people's portfolios because like at
232.32s: least from my perspective i would argue
233.92s: they don't
235.76s: i i would argue that they do okay and
240.16s: well first of all the reason that
242.56s: the reason that
243.92s: bitcoin is referred to as digital gold
245.68s: is that if you look at the properties of
247.44s: money
248.88s: gold and bitcoin have
251.36s: very similar properties except bitcoin
253.60s: excels
254.88s: in many categories
256.64s: like for example if we're talking about
259.20s: divisibility
260.56s: bitcoin is more divisible because you
262.40s: can divide one bitcoin 100 million times
265.60s: into the smallest unit which is called a
267.52s: satoshi or sat
269.52s: and if you want to if you actually have
272.00s: physical gold
273.68s: to divide it into
275.92s: super small units
277.60s: it's just not practical because you you
280.00s: basically
281.04s: have to like shave off the gold which is
282.80s: what everybody says but like that's not
284.96s: that's not something you're going to
286.00s: want to do
287.04s: and portability
289.60s: it's way more portable because i can
291.60s: send a billion dollars across the globe
294.16s: via the bitcoin network and it reaches
296.64s: final settlement
298.00s: in less than an hour and i could pay
300.00s: less than ten dollars in transaction
301.68s: fees
302.88s: and that is far superior to gold because
306.08s: if i had a billion dollars worth of gold
309.12s: first of all i need to
311.52s: load it up onto some armored trucks
314.08s: and pay security guards to guard it i
316.00s: have to get it to the airport and i have
317.92s: to fly it across the globe and obviously
320.24s: that's super expensive and
323.44s: costs aside it just takes a really long
325.36s: time to get that across the globe so in
327.92s: terms of portability bitcoin is far
330.40s: superior
332.32s: and in terms of scarcity gold has a very
335.76s: low infra inflation rate
337.76s: i think it's like two percent a year
340.08s: if i'm not mistaken um
343.20s: and that's very close to what bitcoin is
345.20s: right now
347.60s: but the difference is
350.00s: if gold's price surges then
353.36s: gold miners can come online and increase
356.48s: or
357.44s: search for gold and discover more gold
359.20s: and bring it into supply faster
362.16s: and that would
363.44s: basically dampen that increase in price
366.00s: because
366.96s: new supply will come on on the market
368.88s: faster than it was before given the
370.48s: higher
371.52s: price so as price increases it's more
373.76s: profitable to mine it so they mine it
376.08s: more supply comes along online faster
378.64s: and that helps bring the price back down
381.84s: with bitcoin you don't have
384.08s: any
384.96s: of that mechanic because
387.20s: no matter what on average every 10
390.00s: minutes the same amount of bitcoin
392.24s: comes into the market so right now it's
394.40s: six and a quarter bitcoin on average
396.08s: every 10 minutes and if bitcoin's price
398.72s: doubles
399.84s: then the difficulty adjustment kicks in
401.76s: which basically makes it harder
403.84s: to find new blocks of transactions and
407.36s: that increase in difficulty keeps it so
409.92s: that even though the price doubled the
412.16s: supply can't increase faster and
415.04s: therefore bring the price back down
417.12s: but the same is true on the other side
419.04s: whereas like if gold's price collapses
421.52s: then gold miners can shut down and
423.44s: therefore we have less supply coming
425.12s: online becomes more scarce and therefore
428.64s: that helps bring the price back up so
430.88s: it's
431.60s: it basically dampens the volatility
434.00s: whereas with bitcoin there are there's
436.08s: no assistance if it drops so if
438.32s: bitcoin's price goes down 50
440.56s: then
441.84s: basically the difficulty is going to
444.16s: drop and it's going to keep the new
446.88s: issuance of bitcoin right around 10
449.20s: minutes on average over the long term
451.36s: right on the flip side as i described if
453.52s: bitcoin's price doubles then more miners
456.00s: are gonna fire up and it'll be faster
458.72s: momentarily
460.00s: but it'll be
461.20s: less than two weeks or whatever because
462.72s: basically every like 2 000 blocks or
465.52s: approximately every two weeks
467.76s: there is a difficulty adjustment which
469.44s: basically gauges how fast new blocks are
472.72s: are being added to the ledger
474.96s: and if it's faster than 10 minutes then
478.08s: the difficulty increases and if it's
479.92s: slower than 10 minutes that means it's
481.76s: too hard so they decrease the difficulty
483.84s: so there's
484.88s: bitcoin has so-called like perfectly
487.20s: inelastic supply or almost perfectly
489.52s: inelastic which basically describes what
491.68s: i
492.48s: have laid out which is that it doesn't
494.08s: matter if the price increases or
495.36s: decreases the supply issuance is the
497.44s: same
498.48s: um
500.08s: so yeah that was that was a really long
501.60s: tangent but i i
503.20s: i think when you look
504.84s: at gold versus bitcoin bitcoin is better
509.12s: on many of the properties of money
510.56s: compared to gold and i think that's
512.80s: probably why we're seeing gold suffer
514.80s: this year and bitcoin is taking off
518.00s: because
519.12s: the future is digital right everything's
521.52s: moving digital right and so
524.00s: now that we have this idea of digital
526.40s: scarcity or digital real estate
529.04s: why would somebody want to have a gold
531.84s: bar in their house as opposed to
534.40s: just information where you can take
535.92s: around the world with you and you can
537.04s: access your bitcoin you can send it
538.80s: anywhere in the world you can verify it
540.88s: very easily um and yeah it's finitely
544.72s: scarce too so yeah it's only going to be
547.28s: 21 million bitcoins as opposed to
549.92s: you know who knows how much gold we can
551.68s: dig out of the ground so
553.36s: yeah and i agree with a lot of those
555.44s: points i i think the
557.68s: especially when it comes to just the
559.20s: practicality i think that's one of the
561.04s: conversations that we see around bitcoin
562.96s: already right like is it a commodity is
564.80s: it a currency and a lot of folks
566.88s: struggle with that for a lot of those
568.48s: reasons that you just laid out
569.68s: rightfully so
571.12s: i think the perspective i have on gold
574.80s: probably differs in the purpose of it
577.68s: because for me
579.44s: um a lot of folks that i think that that
582.40s: purchase gold they're probably not
584.40s: trying to you know get a thousand bricks
587.44s: of gold and then go make a purchase with
589.20s: it i
590.08s: don't think that's really what
591.76s: most folks with gold are trying to do
593.76s: it seems
595.12s: like more of a place where people want
597.04s: to park their cash with lower volatility
599.44s: and that's really where i see the big
601.36s: divergence
602.88s: between bitcoin and gold is really
606.40s: derived more from the purpose that it
609.20s: serves in a person's portfolio as
610.96s: compared to anything because to me i
612.96s: look at something you know like bitcoin
614.88s: which has what is it the
616.72s: monthly one standard deviation on it
618.80s: right now is like 11 000 plus or minus
622.56s: susceptible to
624.00s: very high it's a high volatility asset
626.16s: over time that will it will become less
629.20s: volatile though and i know a very
632.00s: it's a very young asset
633.76s: and it's like if you look at any
636.16s: high growth company right after the ipo
638.32s: the volatility is insane
641.04s: you fast forward 10 years the volatility
643.20s: is at a much more normal level it could
645.28s: still be high in the case of something
647.20s: like tesla but
649.12s: the volatility
650.96s: is to the upside you know you can't you
653.12s: can't go from
654.64s: zero to a trillion dollar market cap
657.92s: with low volatility agreed and so if if
663.92s: if
665.76s: your main goal is
668.72s: capital preservation
670.40s: and you're not interested in growth you
673.60s: just kind of want to preserve your
674.80s: purchasing power then you want something
676.64s: with low volatility and historically
679.20s: that could be something like the us
681.36s: treasuries but it's different
683.52s: historically because
685.92s: you would actually get a positive real
687.84s: return on that which means the yield on
689.28s: the bond is higher than inflation but
691.44s: right now
692.72s: i don't know what the 30-year treasury
694.08s: yield is but it's somewhere around one
695.92s: and a half percent if i'm not mistaken
697.60s: one
698.40s: 1.8 percent or something like that
701.52s: and if you have inflation or like the
703.44s: cpi inflation
705.12s: if you're going off that number and the
706.88s: yield on a 30-year treasury is less than
708.96s: two percent then
711.12s: you're you're losing more than three
713.44s: percent in purchasing power every year
715.20s: and that's if you're going off of that
716.64s: cpi number yep but another thing about
719.12s: inflation too i mentioned earlier is
720.56s: like everyone has a different
722.56s: form of inflation
724.56s: michael saylor says this a lot in his
726.72s: podcast
728.32s: he's he basically says like if if you're
730.72s: buying the s p 500 and that's
733.36s: what you're trying to acquire
735.44s: and
736.40s: the s p is up 23 this year then your
739.12s: inflation rate is 23
741.12s: right because if you're holding cash and
743.60s: you just missed out on that 23 increase
746.16s: well now you can buy far less of s p 500
749.12s: stock than you could before
751.04s: and so
752.24s: the inflation rate isn't just
754.96s: it's not just based on the basket of
757.04s: goods that the government publishes it's
758.96s: whatever
760.08s: you are trying to acquire so if you're
761.76s: trying to buy real estate
763.52s: and real estate's going up at
765.76s: 15 a year whatever the number is over
768.00s: the past
768.96s: um 12 to 18 months
771.04s: then if you haven't yet acquired a house
773.76s: then
774.64s: now it's gotten a lot more expensive to
776.80s: do that because house prices has gone up
779.36s: over 10 percent 15 percent right
782.40s: yeah i agree with you and i think that
784.16s: your overall perspective anyways on like
786.24s: bitcoin versus gold in general i pretty
789.20s: much align with it especially like the
790.88s: the longer term prospect because
793.28s: for me i i think more as bitcoin becomes
797.52s: more stable less volatile it will serve
799.84s: a lot more of that capital preservation
801.76s: purpose i think right now a lot of
803.60s: people are more um interested in it for
806.64s: you know the growth rightfully so like
808.64s: you said it is very much like a startup
810.48s: in a lot it is it is also a form of
812.56s: capital preservation i mean capital
813.92s: preservation the name of the game is to
815.84s: not is to grow more than inflation
818.48s: because
819.28s: if you're not growing more than
820.32s: inflation then you're losing purchasing
822.08s: power but like we we've discussed
825.92s: if you're sitting in cash
828.40s: and
829.68s: cpi is five percent
831.68s: a year then you're losing five percent
833.28s: purchasing power a year if it goes
835.28s: higher than that
836.72s: and there are countries around the world
838.72s: where
839.60s: they have double or triple digit
840.88s: inflation if you're in cash
843.36s: you
844.80s: you're getting annihilated right you
846.80s: know and there are there's over a
848.16s: billion people in the world that are
849.60s: living under
850.96s: double or triple digit inflation
853.36s: and that's those are the people that are
856.24s: trying to acquire bitcoin too like the
858.08s: the countries that have the highest
859.52s: adoption rate for bitcoin are the
860.80s: countries
861.84s: that have the most unstable currencies
864.56s: the highest that makes sense because
866.72s: their
868.16s: bitcoin doesn't discriminate it's an
870.72s: off-ramp for anybody who needs to use it
874.24s: so if you're in
875.44s: a different country and you can access
877.60s: the internet then you can access bitcoin
880.48s: whereas maybe you couldn't get us
882.72s: dollars or something like that because
883.84s: there's
884.64s: capital restrictions or maybe you can't
886.32s: even open a bank account and so if you
888.08s: can access the internet and those things
889.60s: are true then you can access
891.52s: bitcoin which is like
893.76s: if you're living under 10 inflation
896.84s: then owning bitcoin and seeing it go
899.36s: down 50
900.48s: in a few months is better than losing
902.88s: a hundred percent on an annual basis
905.76s: yeah i think if you're still 100 i think
907.68s: if you're staying in the currency yeah i
909.68s: think that argument would hold true the
911.52s: only the only counter i would offer you
914.24s: is you know if
916.24s: in your inflation example if you hold
918.32s: gold or cash and at the end of the year
920.72s: you lose five percent with with bitcoin
922.72s: there's a chance at the end of the year
924.32s: it could be down and you know then
927.36s: you're down
928.40s: 30 plus the five or whatever right so i
931.20s: i think a lot of it comes from like your
933.76s: firm belief in the appreciation of
935.36s: bitcoin which i mean i personally think
936.96s: is well founded i i also am generally
939.20s: bullish long-term in bitcoin but i do
940.96s: think long-term it's a long-term game
942.88s: yeah and i think it's just an important
944.64s: caveat to to point out because a lot of
946.48s: the viewers at least on my channel some
948.08s: of them are 60 some of them are 70. you
950.16s: know what i mean and yeah i do think
952.56s: i have a different
954.88s: this is the most difficult thing about
957.60s: like when you
959.52s: when you think about the whole landscape
961.20s: of where you can put your money
962.80s: historically if you had
965.12s: a normal environment let's say
967.44s: you had a 30-year treasury at
970.08s: a 5 yield and inflation is 2 or 1.5 or
974.72s: whatever it is
975.92s: then
977.12s: if you're 60 years old you can put your
979.28s: money in u.s treasuries and that's a
980.88s: very you know it's a very reasonable
983.04s: place especially if
984.88s: you like you've seen interest rates fall
987.92s: over the past few decades and that's
990.32s: bullish for bonds because if you buy a
992.00s: bond at five percent
993.68s: and then the yield drops to four percent
996.80s: you have a capital gain on your bond
999.04s: position so you're you're earning the
1000.96s: yield
1002.00s: you're earning the coupon rate but
1003.12s: you're also seeing your bond position
1005.44s: appreciate right
1008.00s: but now
1009.36s: you don't have
1010.72s: like there's nowhere for someone to put
1012.56s: their money that's
1014.08s: really low risk because
1016.48s: like i said if you have all of your
1017.92s: wealth in cash
1019.92s: uh it's a melting ice cube as as michael
1022.16s: saylor would put it
1023.52s: and
1024.56s: in the scenario where inflation gets out
1027.36s: of hand then cash position can be
1029.60s: completely obliterated
1031.28s: yeah i think that's our zero percent
1033.12s: it's basically cash and then a u.s
1035.44s: treasury at one and a half percent is
1038.16s: better than earning zero percent in a
1040.16s: savings account but at the end of the
1042.00s: day it's still a
1044.32s: fiat currency based contract meaning
1046.72s: your coupon payments are in
1048.80s: the fiat currency and ultimately when
1052.24s: the bond matures you get your currency
1054.48s: back and so if
1056.64s: the fiat currency is unstable then
1058.48s: ultimately the bond position is unstable
1060.88s: because all
1061.92s: future cash flows are coming from that
1064.40s: currency
1065.68s: right now like there's
1067.44s: you can't
1069.20s: you can't invest in the lower risk asset
1071.44s: classes or the traditionally lower risk
1073.28s: asset classes because of capital yeah
1075.60s: you're losing purchasing power in cash
1078.16s: savings and bonds right and so if you
1081.36s: if you want any chance at earning a
1083.12s: higher percentage than inflation you
1084.56s: have to go to something that's higher
1085.92s: risk
1087.52s: like the stock market you know i think
1089.52s: that's what we're seeing yep because
1092.72s: people understand exactly what we're
1094.80s: talking about right now
1096.32s: and
1098.08s: there's really nowhere to hide which is
1099.52s: it's very unfortunate for people who are
1101.44s: older and have a
1103.36s: conservative wealth preservation mindset
1106.24s: you mentioned a couple times
1108.48s: double-digit inflation do you think
1109.92s: that's potentially in the cards for us
1112.96s: i don't know i don't want to speculate
1114.56s: on that fair enough for for me i i
1116.72s: honestly think that it
1119.52s: completely random guess but i i would
1121.84s: guess maybe up to eight or nine percent
1123.92s: but after that i
1125.44s: couldn't imagine
1127.12s: i couldn't imagine the fed doing too
1128.88s: much of standing still after that but i
1131.44s: mean again who the hell knows yeah yeah
1133.44s: you have people like kathy wood um of
1135.60s: arkhanvest she
1137.28s: has said recently that in 2008 when they
1140.56s: started printing money she thought there
1142.32s: was gonna be hyperinflation
1144.40s: but the velocity of money
1146.56s: was low and velocity of money is how
1148.48s: quickly it's changing hands right so if
1150.96s: you have
1152.32s: an inflow of a if you basically have all
1154.88s: this helicopter money
1156.40s: and the velocity of money is picking up
1158.32s: that means there's just a lot more
1159.92s: trading activity then that's a scenario
1162.32s: for higher inflation if i'm
1164.00s: understanding it correctly but what she
1165.76s: was saying is that we did see an
1167.52s: increase in the money supply in 2008 but
1169.84s: the velocity of money
1171.76s: was slowing and so there wasn't that
1173.84s: hyperinflationary event
1175.92s: and so she has stated that there's a
1178.16s: very similar thing going on right now
1179.84s: which is that there's a big increase in
1181.44s: the money supply but the velocity of
1183.52s: money is
1184.80s: is flowing i haven't i haven't
1186.32s: personally looked at that stat recently
1187.84s: so i don't know if it's actually like
1189.04s: what the trajectory looks like but
1191.28s: that's what she said in a tweet the
1192.64s: other day
1193.52s: so
1194.64s: understanding that correctly that's kind
1196.64s: of her line of thinking but i i have no
1198.72s: idea
1199.60s: um
1200.80s: what inflation's gonna do
1202.64s: but
1203.60s: like just the mere worry of high
1206.24s: inflation is enough to make people move
1208.88s: their money around and that's i think
1210.64s: that's what we're seeing in
1212.72s: the higher risk assets like the stock
1214.72s: market is ripping
1216.16s: real estate's ripping
1217.92s: uh bitcoins ripping it's it's
1221.04s: yeah it's
1222.96s: there's nowhere to put your money on the
1225.04s: lower risk side of things which is right
1227.36s: fortunate as i've said
1229.60s: yeah yeah i agree i really agree with
1232.48s: the overall sentiment and
1234.96s: it does create a very fascinating
1237.28s: environment
1238.48s: because of
1239.76s: i don't know even the the covid recovery
1241.84s: surprised me in a lot of ways but just
1244.16s: in terms of the influx of money and when
1246.64s: it came in to the to the stock market
1249.12s: but i i think that even right now i've
1251.12s: been watching the volume
1252.88s: in
1253.60s: the e-minis and you know just order flow
1256.16s: in there and that is also an interesting
1258.88s: benchmark i think for you know how many
1260.48s: people are keeping
1261.76s: more money in the um in the markets
1264.40s: of
1265.28s: of a similar note slightly different
1267.44s: though
1268.32s: something that some of the the viewers
1270.24s: were kind of curious about is just
1272.56s: do you think or do you think
1274.96s: do you foresee any sort of like
1277.36s: significant impact on the rest of the
1279.20s: earnings cycle given the current
1280.80s: inflation environment i know for
1283.12s: my perspective
1284.64s: the reason why i think that's uh just an
1286.80s: interesting discussion is a lot of the
1288.72s: the folks that we see reporting earnings
1290.40s: whirlpool um proctor gamble stuff like
1292.64s: that they've been talking about
1293.68s: essentially raising costs and it's like
1295.92s: some of the folks they're talking about
1297.84s: um i i know like craft heinz that they
1300.40s: were talking about in order to get their
1302.08s: their stuff around the world it's almost
1303.52s: like a 3x increase in price and they're
1305.68s: talking about passing out on the
1306.96s: customer those kinds of things
1308.80s: do you think that that's like starting
1310.88s: to get baked into the earnings cycle
1313.20s: that that essentially inflation is like
1315.36s: truly starting to have an impact on a
1317.60s: lot of companies as they go through the
1319.04s: end of the year
1322.48s: honestly i'm not sure i haven't i
1324.24s: haven't been following this earnings
1325.84s: cycle very closely i've basically been
1328.16s: watching uh bitcoin and watching my
1330.96s: positions that i have which are all the
1332.80s: big ones are bitcoin related uh more fun
1335.36s: to watch but yeah that makes sense so if
1337.60s: you have a rising cost of your inputs as
1340.24s: a business
1342.16s: then you basically you have to you have
1343.76s: to pass that on to your customers
1345.20s: otherwise your margins
1347.36s: get annihilated right yeah and we're
1349.04s: kind of there are people who post on
1350.64s: twitter too where they'll go and buy
1352.80s: um
1353.76s: they call it shrink flashing
1355.76s: where they'll go and buy paper towels or
1358.40s: something like that and then they'll go
1360.08s: back
1360.96s: and buy it a couple months later
1363.28s: and
1364.48s: basically they'll be paying the same
1366.16s: amount but there will be like a lower
1368.48s: number of sheets in the paper towel roll
1370.56s: or something oh that's funny i haven't
1372.24s: heard of that there
1373.68s: instead of increasing the price for the
1375.92s: same quality they're keeping the price
1378.16s: the same and decreasing the amount of
1380.32s: material that you get
1382.00s: um you're expecting like 160 sheets
1384.40s: you're like now you get 158.
1386.24s: yeah exactly that's
1388.96s: so yeah if you're as a business if your
1391.52s: inputs the cost of your inputs are going
1393.76s: up
1395.12s: you have to
1396.24s: pass that off to the customer if you
1397.92s: want to keep your margins the same so i
1399.92s: think for me what i've found interesting
1402.00s: in it so far is just
1403.92s: how pervasive and how topical it is for
1406.96s: a lot of different companies that i
1408.64s: always find interesting to see if like
1410.08s: there's one industry that's getting
1411.60s: hammered really hard for whatever reason
1413.20s: but this seems pretty widespread
1415.36s: at this point
1416.40s: i saw an email on tweet the other day
1418.00s: too
1418.88s: um he was saying that they're seeing
1421.84s: considerable increase in the cost of
1423.92s: their goods so
1425.28s: yeah yeah i mean it makes makes total
1427.68s: sense
1428.72s: um so we have been talking a little bit
1431.36s: about bitcoin and whatnot and as i'm
1434.24s: sure you know there's a new kid on the
1435.84s: block bit o
1437.60s: um i i recently did a video on it
1440.72s: essentially just walking through the
1441.92s: construction of it just suitability for
1444.96s: holding slash trading those kinds of
1446.88s: things
1447.84s: um but i would love to get you know just
1450.08s: your initial thoughts on bit o and its
1453.04s: utility
1454.40s: primarily i would argue primarily as a
1456.96s: trader i think just like most commodity
1460.24s: based you know etfs they have a certain
1463.12s: amount of drag that they're going to
1464.24s: suffer and that just kind of is what it
1465.92s: is so it makes long-term holding a
1467.04s: little more difficult but all that aside
1469.36s: curious what your general thoughts are
1470.64s: on bitto
1472.56s: yeah i think
1474.72s: as a trading vehicle i think it works
1476.96s: like if you're trying if you're in your
1478.80s: brokerage account and you have a
1480.80s: stock and options trading portfolio and
1482.88s: you don't want to go open up
1485.04s: an account at a
1486.40s: crypto exchange to trade elsewhere and
1488.24s: have two separate accounts and you want
1489.52s: to keep it all under one roof then using
1492.48s: something like bito and using it as a
1495.12s: trading vehicle i think is
1497.52s: is fine
1498.64s: i am strongly opposed to owning it or
1501.28s: buying it and owning it long term
1504.08s: because
1505.28s: you're not investing in the actual asset
1507.76s: and this isn't just bitcoin this is any
1509.76s: futures based etf
1511.68s: you're investing in
1513.44s: the changes in the futures contracts
1516.32s: and depending on
1518.32s: if they are at a premium or discount to
1521.04s: the actual asset itself then that will
1523.36s: change the expected returns for that
1525.76s: asset right
1527.44s: like for example in the case of bito if
1530.72s: bitcoin is at
1532.40s: 60 000 the actual price of bitcoin um
1535.76s: and then you're looking at the december
1538.40s: or the november futures contract in
1540.72s: bitcoin and that's trading at
1543.20s: 65 000. did i say 60 000 bitcoin 60 yeah
1546.48s: yeah if the november future is at 65 000
1549.52s: and bitcoin remains right at 60 000
1552.08s: through the november futures settlement
1554.08s: date
1554.88s: that november future is going to slowly
1556.88s: decay from 65 000 to 60 000. what i like
1560.96s: to say is a futures contract with no
1562.88s: future is equal to the asset
1565.20s: right yeah
1566.56s: like if you have a futures contract with
1569.04s: um
1569.92s: zero days till settlement or like one
1572.00s: minute to settlement then the futures
1573.52s: price is going to be essentially
1576.32s: whatever the asset price is right but
1578.80s: when you go further out in time it you
1580.64s: know it depends on whatever asset we're
1581.92s: talking about like if you're talking
1583.04s: about oil the futures contract it kind
1586.08s: of bakes in the storage costs and stuff
1588.08s: like that for oil so if you buy physical
1590.24s: oil you have to put it somewhere it's
1592.00s: either pay for storage and so that's
1594.24s: embedded in the futures pricing but for
1596.88s: something like bitcoin
1598.56s: i i have noticed that
1600.80s: i haven't been watching the futures
1602.32s: relative to bitcoin's price very closely
1604.96s: but i have noticed that
1606.72s: it is
1607.76s: the futures are trading at a slight
1609.52s: premium yep so if you get a period of
1612.16s: time where you're invested in a
1613.44s: futures-based etf and
1615.84s: these the actual asset price is not
1618.08s: increasing
1619.36s: then you are investing in an etf that's
1622.08s: holding the futures contracts that are
1624.00s: decreasing right like the asset prices
1626.72s: remaining the same you're investing in
1628.80s: this future here if the asset price
1630.80s: remains the same
1632.08s: you get this negative return in the
1633.68s: future and then once this future settles
1636.80s: they have to roll those funds into the
1638.88s: next month which is could be here again
1640.96s: and then if you get another
1642.48s: flat period
1643.76s: so basically you're just perpetually
1645.52s: holding
1646.72s: the decaying futures
1648.88s: and if you look at vxx that's exactly
1651.20s: why vxx has this very predictable decay
1654.48s: over time it's because the vix index
1657.52s: trades in a very predictable range like
1659.36s: it's it's basically between like 15 and
1661.28s: 30
1662.56s: 95 of the time right
1664.80s: but when it's less than
1666.56s: let's just say 20 or 25
1668.88s: the vix futures are trading at a premium
1672.16s: to the vix index and during normal
1674.64s: market market conditions the vix index
1676.72s: is going to remain
1678.16s: fairly steady and those futures
1679.68s: contracts are going to decay lower
1681.76s: towards the dix index as they approach
1684.16s: their settlement date and vxx is
1686.64s: tracking the percentage returns in the
1689.04s: vix futures contracts not the returns in
1692.40s: the vix index so that's another example
1694.88s: but it is different because there's no
1697.12s: expectation that the vix index
1699.60s: is going to go from
1701.20s: 15
1702.72s: to
1703.48s: 150
1705.44s: very you know over time over the next
1708.00s: few years whereas in bitcoin there is
1710.56s: that expectation for the bitcoin bulls
1713.28s: because it has that number go up
1715.12s: technology which basically just means
1716.64s: that there's more money
1718.80s: flowing into the bitcoin ecosystem and
1722.16s: since there's only 21 million coins if
1724.40s: you have
1725.44s: more and more people
1727.20s: with aka money trying to flow into a
1729.28s: limited space arena then
1731.44s: you know the the cost of a seat is going
1733.28s: to go up so to speak so the costs
1735.12s: go up and so if you have that increasing
1737.28s: bitcoin price over time
1739.12s: even though the futures contracts could
1741.36s: be trading at a premium to bitcoin
1743.76s: itself
1744.80s: it's not going to be the same return as
1747.04s: simply holding bitcoin so there will be
1748.80s: that drag but it wouldn't be
1750.72s: that
1751.60s: like nasty bleed that vxx experiences
1754.32s: because that's because the vix index is
1757.84s: typically trading between 15 and 20 and
1761.04s: the vix futures are always at a premium
1763.52s: to the vix index in that scenario right
1766.32s: go three six
1768.08s: nine months where the vix index is
1770.08s: relatively
1771.28s: neutral
1772.72s: and basically that means that like
1774.00s: market volatility there's not really
1776.40s: many severe drawdowns market volatility
1778.40s: is fairly normal so to speak then you're
1780.40s: going to have that
1781.60s: constant bleed in vxx so there are
1783.68s: differences you can't like comparing vxx
1786.24s: to vito is not the same but
1788.72s: overall
1790.24s: if you're investing in bito
1793.20s: just know that it's probably more of a
1794.96s: trading vehicle and it's not suitable
1798.08s: for
1798.96s: long-term holds
1800.56s: it's a and i mean i think the way that
1802.48s: you explain like tracking error and
1804.72s: things like that is it really really
1806.64s: helpful elucidates the point quite a bit
1808.48s: because i
1809.36s: i talked quite a bit about just the idea
1811.84s: of bitcoin in general like something
1813.68s: that i think some folks may not even
1815.60s: understand is like
1817.52s: tons of people trade bitcoin itself but
1821.20s: you don't have to cough up the money for
1823.12s: one entire bitcoin if you don't have the
1824.72s: capital right you can trade partials of
1827.20s: bitcoin so for me what i
1829.20s: think at least is if you're kind of a
1831.36s: long-term believer in bitcoin and you
1833.44s: want to trade bitcoin itself as bitcoin
1837.12s: um something like bit 0 is a little
1839.20s: tricky because it's for on surface level
1842.56s: people think oh great you know this is
1843.92s: how i can get exposure but exactly like
1845.92s: you said it doesn't hold the product at
1847.20s: all and to me there's no reason not to
1849.52s: just go by bitcoin if you're so inclined
1851.76s: to you know want to buy bitcoin long
1853.60s: term another big thing that i want to
1855.52s: say is
1857.28s: even if we had a real bitcoin etf i
1860.16s: would still oppose buying that
1863.20s: unless you're only
1865.84s: unless your only goal is to isolate the
1868.00s: investment aspect
1870.00s: of bitcoin because if you own
1873.04s: if you own a bitcoin etf say you own 100
1875.36s: shares or whatever it is you own shares
1876.80s: of the bitcoin etf like a real bitcoin
1878.48s: etf
1879.52s: you can't use
1881.36s: the bitcoin payment network you can't
1883.76s: actually send
1885.20s: that bitcoin anywhere
1886.80s: and
1888.16s: in a scenario where
1890.56s: you know you nee you wanted to like go
1892.88s: to a different country or something and
1894.16s: like take your bitcoin with you you
1895.76s: can't use your bitcoin etf shares right
1899.60s: you're going to need the actual bitcoin
1901.60s: in that case another thing it's a good
1903.84s: point if
1905.60s: if the tax treatment of bitcoin were to
1907.76s: change in the future let's say you
1909.60s: bought a bitcoin etf you're compared
1912.64s: buying a bitcoin etf for a hundred
1914.96s: thousand dollars an actual bitcoin for a
1916.72s: hundred thousand dollars not like per
1918.64s: bitcoin but like just your investment
1921.04s: sure and then both of those positions
1922.56s: grow to 200 000
1924.64s: in a scenario where bitcoin is
1927.28s: recognized as currency
1929.36s: and you don't have to pay capital gains
1931.92s: on
1933.12s: any any spending in bitcoin then if you
1936.80s: own the bitcoin etf you would have to
1938.48s: sell the shares to actually
1941.36s: you know get any money
1943.52s: money out of that whereas in that
1945.60s: scenario i'm not saying this will happen
1947.12s: it's just something i'm thinking about
1949.52s: in the scenario where you have the gain
1951.04s: but then it starts to be recognized as
1952.80s: currency then
1954.32s: you would have that gain but you
1955.36s: wouldn't have to pay capital gains when
1956.64s: you spend it right and i i actually
1958.80s: think i'm mistaken there might be some
1960.24s: like one-time taxation if they did do
1963.44s: something like that um but that's just
1966.40s: in my mind when you when you're
1967.92s: investing in an etf you're isolating the
1970.08s: investment case
1972.08s: in another example you know we've been
1973.92s: talking about gold if you buy gld
1977.44s: you're just isolating the investment
1979.44s: aspect of investing in gold but you can
1982.48s: like you don't actually have the gold
1983.92s: you can't use it
1985.52s: right
1986.56s: i think i think that's a good like if
1988.32s: you wanna if you see a future where you
1990.72s: actually want to use the asset and i
1993.36s: think in in bitcoin's case there's a
1995.44s: higher probability you'd want to use it
1997.52s: as payment compared to something like a
1999.36s: gold bar right and in that case
2002.00s: owning the etf is not going to help you
2004.08s: there so
2005.04s: i think i think it's a really good
2006.64s: defeats the purpose because the purpose
2008.72s: of bitcoin is to
2010.72s: remove
2011.68s: all third parties from
2013.84s: monetary value right so if you're
2015.84s: invested in a bitcoin etf you own shares
2018.40s: that are
2019.44s: you know in your
2020.72s: in your investment portfolio that's held
2022.48s: at a central
2023.92s: party so the only thing i would offer to
2027.44s: the
2028.80s: to the other side of the discussion
2030.32s: because i totally agree with the ability
2032.00s: to like use the currency i think for me
2034.32s: when i look at things like bitcoin
2035.92s: futures or like a actual like bitcoin
2038.40s: etf
2039.68s: is i do think that there's an
2041.52s: opportunity to
2043.20s: leverage the leverage that the
2045.76s: marketplace offers you and i think that
2048.16s: there there is something to that side of
2049.92s: the discussion for kind of commonly
2051.92s: trading the product but yeah
2054.08s: in general i agree with you that there's
2055.68s: a certain utility that comes with being
2057.52s: able to
2058.84s: buy generally in appreciating
2062.80s: currency or whatever we're going to call
2064.40s: it you know that you can then just use
2066.48s: that currency to go
2068.24s: make a purchase go buy tesla with it or
2069.92s: something like that like i do think
2070.96s: there's a lot of value in that yeah i do
2072.96s: think there's
2074.56s: there's going to be a lot of value when
2077.68s: we get a real etf and it might be gbtc
2080.32s: because gbtc right now is a trust and
2082.80s: they're filing to convert to an etf but
2085.44s: from the conversations that i've heard
2087.04s: that might not take that might not
2088.80s: actually go through for
2090.72s: a year based on like the earliest
2092.56s: estimates that i've heard from people
2094.08s: who are much closer to the matter
2096.64s: but once we have a
2099.04s: bitcoin etf
2100.96s: i suspect that it's going to be highly
2103.28s: liquid very actively traded and it'll
2105.68s: have great option markets and i think
2107.60s: that'll be really good for people who
2109.84s: are who are interested in making
2112.08s: options trades like right now one of my
2113.76s: biggest positions that i talk about a
2115.20s: lot is in microstrategy yep because they
2118.00s: own like 120 000 bitcoin and it's
2120.88s: basically a bitcoin holding company
2123.52s: and so the stock price tracks
2126.00s: very closely with with big bitcoin
2128.32s: movement so if i buy call options and
2130.88s: microstrategy i'm doing that because
2133.28s: it's a bitcoin play not necessarily a
2135.12s: micro strategy business play
2137.76s: that had added that has added risks
2140.16s: because
2141.28s: you know what if they
2143.12s: sell their bitcoin you know then then my
2145.44s: play goes out the window right no longer
2148.00s: gonna track bitcoin
2150.08s: and i would much rather have that trade
2152.96s: on in a bitcoin etf but we don't have
2155.20s: one yet so is there a reason why you
2157.12s: would play something like microstrategy
2158.88s: compared to like bitcoin futures
2160.24s: directly
2162.88s: um
2164.40s: yeah
2165.52s: i think it kind of gets back to what we
2167.36s: talked about earlier and
2169.28s: my option trades
2171.04s: in microstrategy are long term so
2172.72s: they're got to get over a year to
2174.00s: expiration got it and if i did that same
2176.96s: thing in
2178.48s: bito i don't even know if they have
2179.92s: options yet do they yeah they do yeah
2181.76s: they it's actually funny their their
2183.36s: options got cleared like pretty quick
2185.52s: yeah they're they're uh pretty liquid
2187.36s: too yeah yeah that would
2190.88s: i could do it in bito but
2193.20s: like we talked about if we get a six
2194.80s: month period where
2196.24s: bitcoin isn't really moving right then
2199.44s: bito is going to decay
2202.64s: and my strike price remains fixed
2205.44s: and so the problem with that is if i
2206.80s: have a fixed call strike price and bito
2209.04s: is decaying because of the futures then
2211.20s: i need a bigger movement to get back to
2214.08s: where it was before and
2215.92s: even bigger movement before my call
2217.52s: option is in the money so that's why
2219.44s: that's why i was curious about that
2221.44s: that's why i was curious about the
2222.56s: futures themselves like something like
2224.96s: the g22s that are 120 days out what's
2228.16s: the what's the appeal for you know like
2230.88s: um what is it micro strategy versus
2233.68s: the further dated future and
2236.80s: if i'm understanding correctly your
2238.00s: response is just because it's the longer
2239.28s: term play and you don't want to have
2241.12s: that tracking error
2244.00s: yeah and also when you when you're
2246.00s: talking about futures contracts
2249.04s: longer term
2250.40s: futures contracts are less
2252.88s: sensitive to changes in the asset price
2256.32s: compared to a shorter term futures
2258.40s: contract
2259.36s: or the shortest term futures contract
2261.68s: like i said earlier a futures contract
2263.68s: with no future is equal to the asset
2265.84s: right like the vix index when you look
2267.92s: at how the vix index moves relative to
2270.08s: the vix futures
2271.76s: if the vix index goes from 17 to 30
2276.32s: the second most volatile asset that
2278.72s: tracks the vix is going to be the
2280.40s: nearest term vic's future
2282.32s: so let's just say the vix future with a
2284.64s: with 20 days to settlement is going to
2286.40s: increase
2288.00s: more
2288.88s: than a vix future with a hundred days to
2291.92s: settlement that's right in the case of
2294.08s: the
2294.96s: the vix index and vix futures structure
2297.60s: i'm not sure how it would be in
2300.00s: bitcoin but i suspect if you had
2302.72s: if you had a really big blow off top in
2304.80s: bitcoin then the longer term futures
2306.56s: might be trading at a discount
2309.36s: to bitcoin
2311.04s: got it but overall they would move like
2313.44s: the longer term future would move
2315.92s: less
2316.88s: than a shorter term future right so
2319.68s: that's kind of the problem with um one
2321.68s: of the mistakes that new options traders
2324.16s: make is that they look at the vix
2326.16s: options
2327.36s: and they
2329.44s: if you're in a low volatility
2330.88s: environment and the market seems like
2332.72s: it's richly valued and you're
2334.24s: anticipating a market sell-off instead
2336.56s: of going to the 30-day vix options
2338.88s: they'll go to like the 180 day vix
2341.28s: option right but what you're doing when
2343.28s: you do that is you're not trading the 30
2345.28s: day
2346.40s: vix futures you're trading options that
2349.68s: are tracking the 180 day right
2353.12s: and even if the vix goes from 17 to 30
2356.00s: that 180 davis future
2358.40s: might go up like a couple points right
2360.48s: it's not going to go up nearly as much
2362.08s: as that 30 day vix future and since the
2364.80s: vix options are tracking those
2366.16s: respective futures contracts um you're
2368.96s: going to have a much more explosive
2370.48s: movement in that shorter term vic's
2373.20s: expiration cycle so right yeah yeah i
2376.64s: think that's a great point and it's as
2378.32s: opposed to just making like trading a
2381.20s: trading a 700 day call option and
2383.36s: microstrategy the stock price is going
2385.44s: to track
2386.48s: the actual changes in bitcoin's price
2388.88s: it's not tracking the 700 day futures
2391.60s: contract which is less volatile than the
2394.32s: actual asset right that's a really
2397.04s: really good point i think that that's
2399.04s: something that i hadn't really
2400.64s: considered myself is
2402.32s: just the the way that the product is is
2404.56s: going to move um i need to like
2406.96s: i
2407.84s: i speak very confidently about that
2410.56s: structure in like vixx versafix futures
2412.80s: but i need to pay attention to um
2415.28s: bitcoin and bitcoin futures more right
2417.36s: so
2418.24s: like i've only checked the prices
2420.40s: occasionally but i'm
2421.84s: i'm fairly confident that that same
2423.36s: thing holds true in the bitcoin futures
2425.84s: market it's like the longer i agree yeah
2428.56s: then
2429.44s: the
2430.64s: shorter term so like the most the most
2432.48s: volatile thing is going to be the actual
2434.48s: asset itself and then the longer term
2437.28s: futures are typically way less volatile
2440.00s: and basically
2441.12s: the less time you have the closer you
2442.72s: get to the actual asset itself the more
2444.48s: volatile those futures contracts yep
2447.60s: yeah i i think yeah because i mean i've
2450.16s: been training the bitcoin futures quite
2451.52s: a bit myself and i think that that's
2453.44s: completely accurate
2455.36s: um so this leads us to kind of
2458.72s: two different ways we can go with the
2460.08s: conversation but i think
2462.56s: you were just talking a little bit about
2464.24s: some of you know your positions and
2465.92s: micro strategy what you've been kind of
2468.08s: playing
2469.04s: um i feel like that like
2472.40s: everything is bitcoin related i just
2474.24s: feel
2475.60s: i know
2477.52s: some people
2479.36s: in my audience get annoyed at the whole
2480.80s: bitcoin thing but it's like
2482.64s: that's where it's at right now in my in
2484.16s: my mind and so it's like i
2486.32s: feel i feel annoying sometimes just
2488.64s: constantly talking about it like
2490.96s: almost every topic that we've talked
2492.64s: about thus far in this conversation has
2494.32s: involved bitcoin in one way i think
2496.08s: that's fair because the conversations
2498.24s: that we've been talking about you know
2500.16s: is
2500.96s: intimately tied to it so
2503.04s: i think we can offer them an olive
2504.80s: branch
2505.76s: and i think for your folks the
2509.12s: good conversation would be
2511.68s: what are some of your favorite
2514.24s: strategies so far this year so i think
2517.28s: that even if it's tied to bitcoin that
2519.44s: you've enjoyed trading i still think you
2520.96s: can you know discuss a little bit the
2522.88s: strategy and then maybe they they'll be
2525.36s: a little more chill
2526.99s: [Laughter]
2528.40s: yeah let's hope uh
2531.28s: yeah i've been i've been using this
2532.80s: strategy
2534.00s: my go-to strategy still
2536.72s: and i've used this
2538.00s: not on not just in microstrategy but
2539.84s: also in
2541.12s: um i've i've got one in square
2543.28s: hear that everybody square i did it in
2545.60s: tesla a bunch i've got it in
2548.84s: nvidia so i've been using this strategy
2553.28s: basically since the pandemic started and
2554.96s: since i stopped shorting the market
2556.24s: which was in like may or june of last
2558.40s: year okay um
2560.88s: basically the the play is to buy call
2563.52s: options long dated call options so like
2565.68s: over over a year to expiration because
2569.28s: i'm not confident enough in
2572.08s: my directional place to make like a a
2574.32s: two day like a seven day option play i
2576.48s: think the shorter term you go especially
2578.56s: when you get into
2579.84s: less than a week it's
2582.16s: very very close to a slot machine so
2586.16s: funny note on that returns are funny
2588.56s: note on that is kind of a match i'm
2590.64s: actually working on a study right now
2593.20s: with my audience on price prediction and
2595.68s: we're tying in some like white papers
2598.00s: we've read about
2599.28s: price prediction and accuracy over time
2601.76s: so i think it's just interesting you
2603.76s: mentioned that because that is like one
2605.12s: of the most pervasive hypothesis in
2607.84s: pretty much all of the studies is that
2609.76s: you shorten the time frame
2611.68s: people are way less accurate so yeah
2614.56s: really good point it's like uh
2617.12s: wow throwback to binary options i don't
2619.60s: know if you remember yeah buddy i'm sure
2621.60s: they still exist but it's a it's a dark
2623.60s: corner of the object it's like it's like
2626.24s: do you think
2627.76s: spy is going to be above or below 250 in
2630.88s: the next 90 seconds and you flip a
2633.84s: yeah it's it's nuts um yeah they're sure
2637.04s: i mean
2639.36s: you can make a lot of money like when
2640.80s: you see those
2642.24s: i hate to call them up but if you see
2643.92s: the
2644.80s: wall street bets traders that
2646.88s: make millions and millions of dollars
2648.48s: from a few thousand dollars there they
2650.48s: do that by
2652.08s: buying a ton of short dated options
2655.20s: right because when you when you go
2656.88s: shorter term with options the option
2658.80s: contracts are cheaper
2660.40s: because the expected stock price
2662.88s: movement over a shorter duration
2665.60s: is much smaller and therefore the
2667.04s: options are much cheaper and there's
2668.96s: also less time value you can yeah you
2671.12s: can afford a ton more contracts right um
2675.04s: and so when you do that you if you if
2676.80s: you're right about a big movement in
2678.40s: your favor
2679.76s: you'll have way more leverage by owning
2682.08s: a thousand call options as opposed to
2684.64s: going like 100 days out and owning 10 10
2687.84s: contracts for the same price yeah i
2689.84s: think for everyone
2691.12s: you only have seven days to be right and
2692.72s: then you lose 100 whereas like i prefer
2695.28s: to go further out
2696.72s: and
2698.32s: it takes a lot a lot longer to lose all
2701.28s: of my money in that aggressively bullish
2703.84s: play right so anyways that's my strategy
2706.00s: as i buy
2707.76s: long-dated call options typically deep
2710.24s: out of the money depending on which
2712.16s: product it was but i did it successfully
2714.08s: in tesla
2715.52s: nvidia basically tech stocks and
2717.52s: microstrategy and then once
2720.88s: i initiate the long calls
2723.12s: once the stock price increases
2726.08s: hopefully it does like if you're right
2727.60s: and it increases substantially
2729.68s: then basically you'll have higher strike
2732.40s: call options that'll be trading
2734.48s: at or more than the premium you paid for
2737.84s: this for the initial call option so like
2740.32s: for example if you the stock price is
2742.24s: 500 and you buy the
2744.16s: 750 call option for
2746.88s: um ten dollars and then the stock price
2749.36s: goes from 500 to 600
2752.24s: now your 750 call option is going to be
2754.16s: worth like 20 or 30 dollars i don't know
2756.48s: what it is i'm just spitballing
2758.56s: but that means there's a higher strike
2760.56s: contract that will be worth ten dollars
2763.04s: so maybe that's the
2764.88s: 800 call option and so if you buy the
2767.92s: 750 call for 10
2769.92s: stock price shoots higher and now the
2772.00s: 800 call is worth 10
2774.48s: you can short the 800 call right and
2777.28s: create a risk free spread and so that's
2779.60s: my strategy that i've been doing
2781.92s: um for the past
2783.92s: past year or so now so it starts is
2786.32s: pretty much like pretty directional play
2788.32s: yeah it's very directional
2790.32s: you have to
2792.00s: you have to take a big risk initially to
2794.32s: get a risk-free trade like to make a
2796.00s: risk-free trade you have to
2798.48s: take risk first you have to expose
2800.40s: yourself to that loss potential
2802.40s: and then you have to be right about the
2804.24s: direction and then once you have a
2806.08s: profitable long naked option then you
2808.72s: can kind of trade around it
2810.88s: and i like that strategy because in my
2812.80s: example let's say
2814.56s: you know the stock price shot up
2816.40s: and now i have this 750 800 call spread
2818.80s: for free if the stock price goes back
2821.04s: down
2821.92s: then i'll have a profit on my short
2824.48s: call because right if i sold it for 10
2826.88s: at the top and then the stock price
2828.72s: trades lower then maybe now it's trading
2830.80s: for five dollars i can buy it back for
2832.56s: five dollars keep that five hundred
2834.88s: dollar profit and then if the stock
2836.72s: price continues another leg higher then
2839.44s: i'm in a position where i can either
2840.88s: resell that one or right
2843.20s: at a higher strike
2844.40s: and that's just it gives you a lot of
2845.68s: flexibility um but
2848.56s: the prerequisite for that strategy to
2850.48s: work is that you have to be right
2852.56s: about a big movement in the stock price
2854.56s: and you have to be and you and i have
2856.08s: talked about this a little bit but you
2857.52s: ask you also have to be resolute enough
2859.76s: to wait until you're right that much
2862.16s: yeah which i i always think for a lot of
2864.32s: people because you know a lot of the i
2866.56s: like to call them the kool-aid folks but
2868.00s: the your your people over at tastytrade
2870.00s: a lot of things that they talk about is
2871.60s: just
2872.40s: managing managing winners right so
2874.40s: taking winning trades down but i think
2876.80s: for something like that it's
2878.08s: counter-intuitive to be disciplined
2880.32s: enough to let go going on you got to
2882.48s: have the diamond hands so to speak yeah
2884.16s: yeah hard because there's a balance
2885.92s: between there's a balance between being
2888.00s: too greedy and waiting too long and then
2889.76s: never
2890.72s: taking that risk off the table you kind
2892.24s: of have to have i like to have like
2894.72s: general stock price levels like oh if
2897.12s: the stock race gets to this price then
2899.60s: i'm going to start
2901.44s: looking at adjustments here but the main
2903.84s: thing for me um
2905.76s: the most important thing with that
2906.88s: strategy like if you're going to take
2908.00s: the risk
2909.04s: let's say you put 10 grand into an out
2910.72s: of the money option that has two years
2912.72s: to go and the stock rips higher yeah you
2915.52s: don't want to block your profits too
2917.36s: soon what i mean by that is
2919.36s: if you buy the
2921.36s: let's just say
2922.40s: another random example let's say you buy
2924.40s: like the thousand strike call for 10
2926.32s: grand
2927.20s: and then the stock price shoots higher
2928.72s: like a couple days later and then you
2930.88s: short the
2932.64s: 10.50 call
2934.56s: for 10 grand now you have a 50 wide call
2937.60s: spread with two years to expiration
2939.92s: basically that 50 wide 50 wide call
2942.40s: spread with two years to expiration is
2944.40s: basically going to be like a brick like
2945.84s: it's not going to move very much right
2948.00s: stock price goes up a lot or goes down a
2949.92s: lot the profit change on that spread is
2952.32s: not going to be
2953.68s: that significant because it has two
2955.52s: years to go and those strikes are so
2957.60s: close together
2958.96s: that it's almost like
2960.72s: it's almost like having no position
2962.48s: right yeah like one way to think of um
2966.96s: if you have a vertical spread like the
2968.40s: the wider the spread gets the closer it
2971.04s: is to a long option
2972.88s: right that's why for like really long
2974.72s: term bullish plays i like really wide
2977.12s: call spreads like right now on tesla i
2979.04s: have the 900 1500 call spread which at
2982.56s: this point is actually looking really
2983.52s: good i've had that on for
2985.20s: for quite a while now um
2987.60s: yeah i've had it on i bought the 900
2989.92s: call
2991.04s: 400 days ago
2993.76s: for
2994.96s: 10 grand and now it's trading for
2997.36s: 30. right but then
3000.08s: 238 days ago i saw i shorted the 1500
3003.60s: call
3004.40s: for 12 grand so i basically created the
3006.80s: risk free
3008.16s: 900 1500 call spread
3011.04s: and now it's looking really good because
3013.04s: tesla is above
3014.72s: the 900 strike call so now i still have
3017.68s: 450 days on that trade and so i can
3019.60s: continue to wait
3021.36s: and who knows in 450 days maybe tesla
3024.32s: will be above 1500 that's that's a good
3026.08s: amount of time
3027.28s: um but the the key there is that i
3029.52s: waited
3030.72s: 180 days
3032.48s: between the long call entry and the
3035.04s: short call entry not that the time frame
3036.96s: necessarily matters but
3039.04s: i was able to wait long enough to where
3040.96s: i could create a really wide spread
3043.28s: because the stock price went parabolic
3045.44s: and then i took that opportunity to
3047.68s: to short that 1500 call which obviously
3050.16s: even after tesla's meteoric rise
3052.48s: recently it's still 500 out of the money
3055.36s: but since the stock price went vertical
3058.72s: so quickly what happens is when that
3061.52s: happens
3062.88s: the
3063.60s: call options just explode because
3066.48s: everybody rushes in to buy more call
3068.72s: options so not only are you making money
3070.96s: on the stock price increasing via the
3073.12s: delta but
3074.72s: everyone is trying to
3076.88s: join in on that momentum trade and all
3078.88s: that money is just piling into those
3080.56s: calls and so the implied volatility also
3083.44s: explodes
3084.80s: and so that's why when you have
3086.56s: typically if you're looking at the s p
3088.16s: 500 implied volatility or the vix will
3091.76s: increase as the s p 500 goes down but
3094.72s: for some of these high re or high growth
3096.64s: stocks the opposite happens where if
3098.88s: they start to take off then the implied
3101.68s: volatility actually explodes when the
3103.92s: stock price is increasing so if your own
3106.24s: call options in that environment
3109.60s: you're killing it because you're right
3111.20s: the stock price increase and also
3112.80s: everyone flooding into the options and
3115.04s: inflating their prices even more
3117.12s: and that makes it that's like a really
3118.80s: good example and scenario for when you'd
3121.20s: want to
3122.40s: take that opportunity and short a call
3124.48s: against your long call right to create
3126.80s: that risk-free spread especially if you
3128.56s: can get like a really wide spread
3130.96s: i think the the other thing that i like
3132.80s: to do because i i kind of have a very
3134.56s: specific
3135.92s: um
3137.20s: leap diagonal strategy that i like to
3139.76s: run
3140.56s: um normally it's on the call side but
3142.24s: one of my favorite things to do there
3143.68s: anyways is to trade it at a ratio
3146.16s: so you know if you have 10 longs
3148.48s: whenever you have that chance for that
3149.84s: risk-free spread you can kind of
3151.28s: calculate you know how much capital you
3152.96s: need to take in to pay off that trade so
3154.64s: instead of maybe selling 10 calls
3156.48s: against it you sell eight and you you
3158.08s: know recoup most of the cost and yet you
3160.40s: still don't cap your up you know that
3161.68s: kind of thing
3162.80s: but because it yeah it seems
3165.52s: the way that you and i enter that trade
3167.84s: is actually pretty similar because when
3170.24s: i'm going with the call leap diagonal i
3173.04s: normally will establish the long
3174.80s: position partial so i always get ready
3176.96s: to kind of add to it over time i budget
3179.20s: some capital to do that yeah um but
3182.48s: if i offer any sort of
3186.08s: short call against the long call it's
3188.32s: always at a very small ratio to exactly
3190.96s: to your point give the trade time to
3192.56s: work right that's the whole point of
3193.92s: getting a leap is to to put some time in
3196.80s: the trade yeah exactly um yeah that's
3199.76s: been my favorite strategy has been going
3201.20s: well but i think one thing i really want
3203.84s: to say it's important is that
3206.96s: i have no confidence that i'll be able
3209.28s: to do this forever because
3211.68s: the stock prices in the stock market
3213.60s: overall they can't go up forever right
3215.52s: right so that's why
3217.68s: it was fortunate timing because last
3219.92s: year when the stock market collapsed
3222.56s: and then it started to bounce off of the
3224.24s: lows
3225.20s: i started to get short
3227.12s: and i was betting against
3229.20s: further increases in the market
3231.28s: because i thought we were just going to
3232.40s: have a little bounce and then we were
3233.52s: going to continue to plunge lower i was
3236.08s: like buying all these
3237.92s: i was buying like 100 strike puts in spy
3240.80s: when spy was at
3243.52s: like 200 or whatever
3245.44s: and the market kept going up and i kept
3247.68s: adding to my short position and then
3249.60s: eventually i was like wait a second i
3252.08s: started paying more attention to uh
3254.16s: monetary policy and the market response
3257.28s: is to
3258.32s: what the fed was doing
3260.16s: and i i flipped which was a really hard
3262.32s: decision because it's hard to it's hard
3264.72s: to lose money start bleeding money being
3267.28s: short
3268.24s: and then flip long
3270.80s: but ultimately i just came to the
3272.08s: conclusion that the market
3274.48s: is going to listen and basically trust
3277.76s: the monetary policy and and that was my
3279.92s: basis for flipping but then that the
3282.32s: market's been up so much
3284.24s: over the past
3285.60s: 12 plus months that
3287.36s: like i would not
3289.04s: i would be careful to to enter the
3291.44s: trades that i'm talking about at these
3293.44s: current levels yeah it but i i think
3296.00s: that that's like pretty impressive on on
3298.08s: the on the flip because i feel like
3299.84s: that's such a double-edged sword right i
3302.24s: mean
3303.12s: that's why it's so scary because like
3304.96s: flip yeah
3305.36s: then the market's going to crash yeah
3306.88s: because i mean it shows your ability to
3308.64s: because i do think that there's
3309.76s: something to be said to look at a losing
3311.76s: position objectively
3313.52s: and make a decision about how to
3315.52s: essentially approach it and i think that
3317.44s: there's a lot of value in that but yeah
3319.60s: it seems like normally for me in those
3321.60s: scenarios i kind of just bail on that
3325.44s: overall idea and i move on to something
3328.16s: else but i mean with something as big as
3329.84s: the broad market i could totally get
3331.52s: that but that's awesome that that worked
3332.72s: out that's that's a tough move to make
3334.72s: yeah at this point i would rather
3337.28s: like i've seen so many people lose
3339.68s: tons of money betting against things
3342.56s: and at this point i would rather have no
3345.20s: position in something than short it it's
3347.36s: funny because especially like a
3350.08s: an uncapped upside short like shorting
3352.24s: futures where you keep losing money as
3354.96s: it continues to go up if i'm gonna short
3356.72s: something i'm gonna buy puts because
3358.48s: then if i'm wrong i only lose the
3360.88s: premium i pay for the puts and as the
3363.76s: as the asset continues to increase i
3365.44s: lose less and less because my put
3367.68s: options are basically just losing all
3369.60s: their value becoming close to worthless
3371.44s: and then i at a certain point i stopped
3373.04s: losing money
3374.24s: versus like a static stock short or a
3377.20s: future short where like as it continues
3379.68s: to go up you lose the same amount every
3381.76s: dollar it goes right so that's that's
3384.24s: actually the
3385.20s: the beauty i think of options is that if
3387.60s: you're going to short something i would
3388.80s: much prefer to use put options but of
3391.04s: course you know there are pros and cons
3392.96s: because if you buy put options you're
3395.28s: putting a time limit on it and
3397.92s: if it goes sideways then you're going to
3400.32s: lose money on the puts versus if you
3401.68s: short something and it goes sideways
3403.04s: you're not going to make her lose much
3404.80s: money so i mean there's obviously
3406.08s: trade-offs but i would rather
3408.24s: not have uncapped upside risk
3411.52s: for an asset continuing to increase
3413.28s: against me if i'm shorting it yeah and
3415.36s: for that i would i would much rather use
3417.36s: a long put too
3419.44s: i totally agree with that because the
3420.64s: other thing is just the the cost to
3422.64s: carry if you short stock outright a lot
3425.04s: of place will you know you have some
3426.24s: sort of daily interest that yeah
3428.40s: yeah so borrow costs too yeah to me that
3431.28s: it generally is a no-brainer to
3433.60s: typically use derivatives for for those
3435.84s: sorts of things
3437.52s: um
3438.40s: so moving on to the next topic i think
3441.20s: that
3442.16s: this is one that um your your audience
3445.36s: was interested in discussing which is
3446.96s: kind of the idea of
3448.40s: um growing a small trading account so
3452.96s: for me i've actually i did a study on my
3455.92s: youtube channel called small stacks
3457.84s: where i literally did exactly that i
3459.52s: partici partitioned off a five thousand
3461.28s: dollar account and i just traded it
3463.36s: essentially how i would if i was
3465.44s: starting with that now
3467.04s: and one of the common themes throughout
3469.68s: that conversation is
3472.48s: realistically speaking if i were to like
3474.88s: truly have five thousand dollars and
3477.36s: want to to grow that
3479.76s: the first thing i said in all the small
3481.28s: stacks videos was i wouldn't trade it i
3483.36s: would simply just put it in some sort of
3486.40s: interest bearing account even if it's a
3488.32s: cd earning something trying to combat
3490.96s: inflation like we were talking about
3492.24s: earlier and then paper trading in the
3493.68s: meantime because while i was going
3495.52s: through that study one of the things i
3497.04s: kept saying every time i took a trade is
3499.36s: like well i don't have enough money to
3501.76s: afford this and i don't want to be too
3504.00s: directional because of you know x y or z
3506.72s: and long story short every single time i
3508.88s: was putting on a trade it was a series
3510.40s: of compromises no matter what now
3512.72s: i buy this one product i you know i like
3515.76s: to do
3516.64s: um cash secured puts which is really
3518.96s: difficult you know with a small account
3521.04s: and really
3522.40s: the purpose of trading that way in a
3524.08s: small account is if you're directionally
3525.84s: wrong and you're trading a cash secure
3527.20s: put on something that you like worst
3529.04s: case scenario you end up just owning it
3530.96s: and you know carrying it going forward
3532.96s: but the downside in a small account is
3535.12s: that could be one product and then
3536.48s: you're [ __ ] you're tapped out
3538.56s: so there's a ton of trade-offs that go
3541.04s: with trading a small account so for me
3543.52s: my general position is if you have
3545.68s: really a small account i would consider
3547.60s: that pretty much anything less than 10
3549.04s: 15 000 is like really small in my
3551.04s: opinion just to like actively trade
3553.76s: i would either not trade and save or
3556.72s: just start buying an index etf you know
3559.28s: vo spy just something like that if
3561.68s: you're so inclined um and you know paper
3564.80s: trade while you go to learn but curious
3566.88s: what what your approach would be
3569.28s: yeah i agree
3570.88s: i think the
3573.04s: the smaller the account you have the
3575.52s: less flexibility you have and it's like
3577.36s: way less flexibility like if you have
3579.04s: two thousand dollars that's the bare
3580.88s: minimum to open a margin account
3583.12s: and
3584.32s: if you put you basically are limited to
3586.32s: low price stocks because you need to be
3588.00s: trading
3588.96s: strategies that have
3590.80s: low loss potential or small loss
3592.64s: potential but if you're
3594.88s: you know if your loss potential on
3597.28s: a trade is 200 that's not a that's not a
3600.00s: large
3601.44s: that's like a it's a very small max loss
3603.76s: for an option position to have
3606.08s: um and even at two hundred dollars
3608.00s: that's
3608.80s: that's ten percent of your account and
3611.36s: if you're talking about a thirty to
3612.48s: sixty day play we're talking about
3613.84s: losing 10 of your account in a month or
3616.48s: two months if it goes against you um
3620.80s: and so
3621.68s: yeah like if you just
3623.20s: held two thousand dollars and
3625.84s: you deposit
3627.52s: a hundred dollars a month if you can
3630.16s: then that's a risk-free five percent
3632.24s: growth right you know and you're it's
3634.32s: going to be very hard to grow your your
3636.40s: trading account at five percent per
3638.16s: month
3639.36s: especially as a brand new trader and so
3642.00s: i agree with what you're saying is if
3643.52s: you have a if you have two thousand
3644.72s: dollars it's going to be very difficult
3646.48s: my kind of ballpark number is that
3648.56s: things start to
3650.40s: you get a lot more flexibility when you
3652.24s: get closer to like 10 grand
3654.88s: but then as you said like you can you
3656.64s: can't trade actively until you have 25
3659.52s: grand because you need right you have to
3661.60s: get past the the pattern day trader
3663.52s: rules which is if you have less than 25
3665.76s: 000 and you're trading
3667.92s: stocks or options you can only do so
3669.60s: many round-trip trades like enter and
3672.24s: exiting a position you can only do so
3674.40s: many of those in a rolling i think it's
3676.56s: five-day period yeah um and if you go
3678.96s: over that then basically your account
3680.48s: gets put to closing only like 60 to 90
3683.20s: days and the other important note on
3685.28s: that is it's not even like you don't hit
3687.20s: the 25 000 threshold and then you're
3690.00s: good you have to stay above that yeah
3692.32s: and i think a lot of people make that
3693.68s: mistake where they think oh i'm good now
3695.36s: i can start doing this and then they
3696.72s: find themselves in a bad spot
3698.48s: yeah
3699.36s: but overall it's it's interesting
3700.88s: because
3703.04s: like trading at
3706.16s: trading a twenty thousand dollar account
3708.88s: you could trade it very similarly to a
3710.96s: two hundred thousand dollar account you
3712.32s: just
3713.28s: your positions scale up you just have
3714.80s: the same percentage of risk you know
3716.56s: that is
3717.60s: but that is exactly what what i talk
3719.60s: about a lot
3721.28s: i don't wanna
3722.48s: i don't wanna
3724.56s: make any suggestions but like
3726.56s: i don't know if i was trading in a very
3728.72s: small account
3730.48s: i would probably
3732.40s: i would probably favor
3735.44s: longer term like naked option purchases
3738.24s: because i'm trying to get out of that
3739.52s: small zone but at the same time like you
3741.60s: can't if you have two thousand dollars
3743.12s: you can't buy a
3744.64s: a 700-day call option in tesla because
3748.16s: those are tens of thousands of dollars
3750.08s: yeah you're limited in that regard so
3751.36s: basically you have to like you have to
3752.48s: trade lower price stocks one thing could
3755.04s: be you could allocate a certain
3757.04s: percentage of that to like two year
3758.88s: leaps in spy
3761.60s: um and so you could buy like the
3764.56s: 500 or like 550 calls and spy with 900
3768.64s: days expiration i don't even know what
3770.08s: those are trading for let's check
3772.24s: but that would be a way like if you're
3773.52s: bullish on the stock market overall
3776.40s: then
3777.36s: putting your money into
3779.76s: a position like that
3781.68s: let's just see january 2024.
3784.24s: they look kind of expensive if you can
3785.76s: get out at like attendance
3787.60s: you could uh you could buy the 815 day
3791.28s: call options at the 600 strike price
3794.32s: for
3795.20s: six hundred dollars a piece
3797.92s: and
3801.20s: when you do that one thing i would say
3802.64s: is you're not necessarily saying that
3805.28s: the stock market's going to go to 600
3807.44s: right
3808.48s: but basically in between now and let's
3811.84s: just say
3812.80s: like a few months from now
3814.48s: if spy goes from 450
3817.20s: to 500
3818.80s: over the next
3820.24s: let's just say
3822.16s: six to nine months like you you're going
3824.88s: to make money
3826.24s: on those call options right it might be
3828.40s: it'll be a it'll be a much larger
3830.24s: percentage return than the percentage
3832.80s: increase in spy
3834.24s: and i think that that's a lean towards
3836.00s: something like that but at the same time
3837.20s: i don't want to i don't want to
3838.64s: recommend that people
3840.64s: put a
3841.92s: large chunk of their account into deep
3844.00s: out of the money options yeah and it's
3846.08s: but it's funny though and i think that's
3847.76s: why i like these conversations so much
3849.36s: because like you could tell how our
3851.44s: perspectives on that differ and i
3853.84s: i really like your utilization of
3856.24s: leverage though right like that's what
3857.68s: it comes down to like you definitely
3859.12s: have a more directional approach in that
3861.28s: sense than i would but the big
3863.84s: difference there is you would benefit
3865.44s: from leverage and like i think there's
3867.92s: something to be said that's actually
3869.36s: something my mentor always said he was
3870.88s: funny like he was an older dude and even
3872.40s: when i first started trading and working
3874.56s: with him a lot around 10 years ago he he
3877.20s: was always like 50 000 and i didn't have
3879.76s: the patience for that because i was i
3881.36s: was literally in high school when i
3882.56s: first started and i was just like man
3884.00s: the [ __ ] old guy doesn't always talk
3885.36s: about [ __ ] that but then i started to
3887.28s: realize like why he said that but one of
3889.92s: the things that he also said very
3891.52s: frequently and i think i've come to
3893.60s: realize it more and more over time is
3895.36s: just
3896.08s: the the purpose and almost necessity of
3898.96s: leverage to traders if you want to try
3901.20s: to outperform the the stock market i
3903.60s: find it's very very difficult to do that
3905.92s: without the presence of leverage in some
3907.52s: capacity because otherwise
3909.60s: unless you're really good at picking
3910.80s: direction i'm not i'm like i would
3913.68s: probably start a paid service if i put
3916.24s: on a trade to tell everybody to take the
3917.68s: opposite side because there's a pretty
3919.04s: good chance that as soon as i enter it's
3921.12s: going to go against me
3922.48s: yeah and that's
3924.64s: that's a good point so like people ask
3926.40s: me one another common question i get is
3928.72s: how do you screen stocks and
3932.56s: i don't screen stocks it's like all of
3934.64s: my trade ideas they're
3936.72s: at this point in time my trade ideas are
3940.72s: usually tied to fundamentals especially
3942.80s: like if if i'm doing a two-year option
3944.64s: play then that's because i think there's
3946.80s: some fundamental
3948.40s: reason for that movement to occur right
3951.28s: um so you have to have you have to have
3953.60s: some sort of prediction and the
3955.28s: prediction comes from
3957.60s: you know doing whatever research like
3959.76s: whatever realm you're in like if you
3961.60s: follow
3962.48s: the automotive market and then maybe you
3964.24s: have like a
3965.76s: you know you have an auto stocks ideal
3967.84s: idea or something like that or if you
3969.60s: follow the debt markets maybe you have
3972.40s: a bond trading idea but it has to come
3974.64s: from somewhere but i think
3977.36s: the only like the only reason i've had
3979.68s: deep conviction in my micro strategy
3981.84s: play it's not like i just like picked
3983.20s: microstrategy in a screener and just
3984.96s: said like oh i'm gonna
3986.56s: leverage right builds long options in
3989.28s: this stock it's because
3991.60s: my conviction
3993.60s: in bitcoin is has stemmed from the last
3996.08s: 18 months of spending
3999.52s: most of my days
4001.20s: and a lot of my working hours like
4003.04s: thinking about it in some capacity and
4004.64s: listening to podcasts constantly
4007.04s: like my
4008.40s: 90 80 of my podcast listening is
4011.44s: all about bitcoin and so like that trade
4014.00s: idea
4015.04s: didn't come from just like looking at a
4016.88s: stock it came from a deep conviction in
4019.28s: this uh bitcoin idea and that's why i
4022.08s: have
4022.80s: this position on in my portfolio and i
4024.96s: think but like if you don't have enough
4026.40s: if you don't have a good idea you don't
4027.68s: necessarily have to try to force
4028.88s: anything and i i wouldn't if you don't
4030.64s: have any good ideas then
4032.72s: just stick to you know those static
4035.12s: positions whether that's you know owning
4037.20s: shares of stock or whatever it is yeah
4039.92s: i think there's something
4041.28s: i think there's something to that
4042.40s: especially because i think for a lot of
4044.56s: folks well for for people who've been
4046.80s: trading like you and i at least for for
4048.56s: a while now you start to build a
4050.48s: relationship with different products and
4052.64s: like you you kind of
4054.40s: it's not just trying to guess direction
4056.24s: based on a chart and i think that a lot
4058.32s: of folks who ask that style question
4060.96s: that's essentially
4062.64s: what they're trying to do is just you
4064.16s: know how can i pick something that's
4065.60s: going to go up and i think that you can
4068.00s: do technical analysis you can be a
4069.84s: technical analyst i'm not a ta guy
4072.16s: neither am i i use it i always say at
4074.56s: least to my folks i use technical
4076.72s: analysis
4078.00s: um for context like just just to help me
4080.72s: understand the current environment for
4082.32s: something there's a lot of tools that i
4083.76s: do find useful but at no point am i
4086.48s: under the illusion by my observation of
4089.28s: a chart that i can have any predictive
4091.76s: capacity over where something will go in
4094.32s: the future
4095.20s: just i think that's a very difficult
4096.88s: argument to make
4098.32s: so i feel like i some i feel like i let
4100.56s: my viewers down in that regard too
4102.32s: because i feel like
4103.52s: they want me to have
4105.36s: a more active outlook and they want me
4106.88s: to have more ideas but at this stage
4109.04s: this day and age like
4111.04s: i see options as a tool like if i if i
4113.52s: have a specific scenario
4115.52s: where i think they're valuable to use
4117.20s: and i'll use them but yep if not then i
4119.84s: won't use them and i'll just i think
4121.92s: but i think that
4123.28s: that just goes to show again like just a
4125.52s: certain level of authenticity because i
4127.52s: feel like i literally feel the same
4129.52s: exact thing a lot of folks will say well
4130.88s: what do you think about x y or z
4132.72s: and i might have an opinion on like the
4136.08s: the company itself or whatever but i
4138.64s: could always tell that generally they're
4140.56s: trying to see like do you think it's
4142.08s: going to go up or go down and my answer
4144.24s: is literally the same thing my mentor
4146.24s: always told me which is nobody knows
4148.80s: literally nobody knows
4150.72s: so
4151.60s: i i agree with you though i feel like a
4153.84s: lot of folks
4155.04s: they enjoy that kind of content because
4156.80s: it's it's almost like when a fighter
4158.32s: predicts their fight like there's just a
4160.40s: certain amount of confidence that goes
4162.08s: into that that people find i think
4165.52s: alluring but i do think it would be a
4169.20s: bit disingenuous at least because i mean
4171.92s: especially with the stock market and how
4173.36s: fickle things are
4175.28s: it's very very difficult like we were
4177.12s: just talking about before the studies
4178.56s: that i that i've been reviewing and i'm
4180.00s: starting to do myself it's just very
4181.76s: difficult for people to predict
4184.16s: direction and we know that favorably
4186.48s: some people convey it with a ton of
4188.24s: conviction even in um the study that i'm
4190.64s: doing now i'll ask folks you know in the
4193.28s: google form like how confident they are
4195.60s: and some folks literally go all the way
4197.28s: up as high as i have on the confidence
4198.80s: scale like supremely confident and it
4202.40s: exists some people are very very
4204.08s: convicted
4206.56s: but you bring in
4207.92s: another really good point something that
4209.36s: you brought up earlier in our discussion
4211.44s: is just the utility of options and
4213.84s: different ways that we can use them and
4215.20s: i think something that one of uh or some
4217.60s: of your folks have expressed interest in
4219.68s: a discussion on is just you know ways to
4222.16s: hedge a portfolio with options and i i
4225.28s: actually find that to be a really fun
4227.36s: conversation because i think
4229.28s: for me i very rarely have a lot of long
4233.28s: stock or just long equity positions that
4236.08s: are outright that i would be wanting to
4237.92s: hedge
4238.88s: with with derivatives so
4241.12s: when i think about that question to me
4242.96s: it's like just a really interesting
4245.12s: scenario to to view from because the
4247.52s: vast majority of my trading is
4249.92s: derivatives and the vast majority of my
4252.80s: trading is um generally realized short
4256.40s: term i do have some long-term positions
4258.72s: but most of those are super speculative
4260.64s: and i personally not hedging them you
4263.04s: know what i mean like if they work they
4264.08s: work if they don't they don't but
4266.00s: um curious to hear your thoughts on
4269.44s: hedging a portfolio with options because
4271.36s: to me ton of choices available very very
4274.16s: doable and there's a lot of ways to go
4275.60s: about it
4277.12s: so the clear choices for me would be
4281.76s: using a broad index as
4285.60s: as kind of the vehicle so an example
4287.36s: would be like if you
4288.88s: you're trying to hedge against the
4290.08s: market decline you go to spy and you buy
4292.48s: the puts there
4294.00s: but then the discussion of like what
4295.92s: expiration and what strike you buy like
4298.88s: there's an unlimited combo of things on
4301.04s: all of their pros and cons benefit
4302.48s: analysis
4303.76s: the big thing is
4305.68s: you want to buy insurance
4308.16s: when you don't need it
4310.00s: yep
4310.80s: and so
4311.92s: like right now the vix is at 17 which
4314.08s: means
4315.04s: things aren't too expensive but if you
4317.60s: if you don't buy insurance now in the
4320.16s: form of spy puts right and then
4322.80s: let's say the market starts declining
4324.40s: and now the vix is at 25 if you are
4326.72s: trying to buy spy puts when the vix is
4328.96s: at 25
4330.40s: you're going to pay
4331.60s: way more premium than you would have if
4333.52s: you would have hedged right now at the
4335.44s: vegas at 17. so
4338.08s: like an analogy would be
4340.72s: you don't want to buy
4342.80s: fire insurance on your house when it's
4344.72s: burning down because you're going to pay
4347.60s: basically the total value of your house
4349.20s: for insurance because it's burning down
4350.64s: as we speak
4352.08s: but
4353.52s: if it's fine everything's good then you
4356.16s: can buy a
4357.52s: fire insurance policy and you're going
4359.12s: to pay
4360.16s: significantly less than the value of
4362.24s: your home
4363.12s: yeah hopefully nothing happens but you
4365.12s: buy it when you don't need it because
4366.88s: that's when it's cheapest so in terms of
4369.12s: hedging it gets really expensive if
4371.04s: you're trying to add the hedge
4373.20s: when
4374.72s: things start to move against you have to
4376.56s: put them in place
4378.48s: before anything bad happens and accept
4380.40s: them as a cost of doing that yeah second
4382.48s: thing is like if you have a perpetual
4384.64s: hedge that's
4386.16s: i don't think that's a good strategy
4387.60s: because it's going to be expensive
4389.04s: regardless and it's just going to eat
4390.56s: into your returns let's just drive if
4392.56s: you have if you need a perpetual hedge
4394.40s: and you probably should just have lower
4396.64s: position size overall i
4398.80s: that that right there is exactly what my
4400.72s: mentor always hit on was in general like
4403.68s: for me the only time i hedge like no
4405.92s: [ __ ] is if i have a big futures position
4408.72s: on that if it goes wrong it literally
4410.32s: will blow me up
4411.68s: and in those scenarios i always have
4414.32s: some sort of hedge on and just accept
4415.84s: the cost but that's exactly what he
4417.28s: always said the primary hedge is
4419.84s: risk management and what he means by
4421.60s: that is exactly what you just said which
4423.28s: is controlling how much risk you offer
4426.16s: another thing i was going to say
4427.92s: slipped my mind
4429.68s: oh sorry um
4434.64s: what was i going to say um
4436.88s: another thing i don't know if this is
4438.88s: next in line in my thoughts but
4441.20s: another thing is if you have
4443.92s: if you have a portfolio of let's say 10
4445.84s: positions and two of the positions take
4448.08s: up
4448.96s: like 70 of the size right like for
4451.52s: example in my portfolio in the main one
4454.64s: um
4456.24s: you know microstrategy
4458.56s: is 170 000 and the next biggest position
4461.76s: is square at 50 000. right so
4465.28s: i don't need if i'm trying to reduce
4467.20s: risk in my portfolio
4469.60s: i don't need to go out and buy spy puts
4471.76s: i could just go to my biggest portfolio
4473.84s: positions and put on protective
4475.68s: positions in the biggest portfolio
4477.92s: positions because those are the ones
4479.04s: that have the most risk
4480.84s: also if you have a profitable
4484.00s: position
4485.20s: um for example like if you buy if you
4487.44s: buy shares of stock for a hundred
4488.64s: dollars and it goes up to 150
4490.80s: over a certain period of time now you
4492.40s: have a big profit on that stock position
4495.28s: and if you have stock that you're trying
4497.12s: to hedge and you have more than a
4498.16s: hundred shares you can do
4500.48s: what is called a caller yeah
4502.88s: so you could buy a put and short a call
4506.08s: and basically the short call premium in
4508.72s: the long put premium can offset so that
4511.52s: you
4512.40s: don't have any cost of hedging so for
4514.32s: example
4515.28s: if the stock price is at 150
4517.60s: and you sell
4518.88s: the
4520.32s: 160 call and you buy the 140 put for
4524.80s: a net credit or like a scratch so
4526.80s: basically the 160 call is trading for
4528.64s: the same as the 140 put
4530.48s: you can basically put that protective
4532.08s: position on for free doesn't add any
4534.88s: risk to your portfolio it actually
4536.32s: reduces it but you don't have to pay for
4538.64s: that protection
4540.48s: but what you get there is you'll limit
4542.56s: your upside on right above 160
4545.84s: and you'll guarantee that you can sell
4547.84s: them at 140 and so since you bought the
4550.80s: shares for 100
4552.72s: and they're at 150 and then you put on
4554.56s: that collar where the put strike is 140
4557.28s: you're basically guaranteeing that the
4559.20s: worst case scenario is that you lock in
4560.72s: a 40 profit on the shares
4562.88s: right so that's that's what mark cuban
4564.88s: did
4565.68s: when he sold
4567.52s: broadcast.com to yahoo he got paid in
4570.08s: yahoo shares
4571.68s: and he had a lock-up period i think it
4574.48s: was six months
4576.00s: but he
4577.60s: he hired goldman if i'm not mistaken and
4579.92s: they
4580.64s: they did a six month caller for him so
4583.36s: since he got paid
4585.68s: like a billion dollars in yahoo stock
4587.68s: and he had to hold it for six months he
4590.00s: wanted to basically
4591.68s: lock in that gain he he didn't want to
4593.84s: risk seeing yahoo stock plummet
4596.48s: while he had to hold it and therefore
4597.92s: like the value of his payout just gets
4599.92s: decimated so what he did is he did a
4601.60s: collar
4602.88s: through that holding period so that he
4604.96s: had some more appreciation potential in
4606.88s: the shares but he also
4608.80s: guaranteed a like a worst case sale
4610.88s: price but he didn't have to pay for that
4612.80s: protection because he did a costless
4614.40s: collar so that
4615.60s: that's a really good use case and a
4617.76s: really savvy
4619.68s: scenario where you can use options to
4621.36s: not speculate or gamble but you can use
4623.28s: it strategically to
4625.44s: i think he ruined it for the rest of us
4627.12s: though because a lot of places
4628.88s: um if you're in a lockup a lot of them
4630.96s: now specify that you can't even trade
4632.64s: derivatives on it which is really
4634.08s: annoying yeah yeah so there's been a
4636.64s: couple endeavors um one of which i was
4639.12s: just doing some angel investing for a
4640.64s: company and i received uh shares for it
4643.20s: and like very specifically they said
4646.08s: that
4646.88s: can trade the product for x period of
4648.40s: time can trade derivatives in the
4650.16s: product and they even went so far as to
4651.92s: list
4652.80s: a handful of very highly correlated
4655.12s: products that you couldn't trade either
4658.40s: like pretty intense in that case you
4659.76s: have to find a friend with a bunch of
4661.12s: money to yeah exactly yeah put on the
4663.84s: they have to buy the protection for you
4665.52s: in someone else's name
4667.60s: it was like crazy but i i literally i
4669.68s: get a kick out of that mark cuban story
4671.28s: because i literally think that because
4673.28s: everybody realized that he found a great
4674.96s: way to yep um the the other thing that i
4679.12s: would just mention for hedging a
4680.64s: portfolio another thing that um i
4683.68s: probably worth mentioning is
4685.44s: a lot of times people like to use
4687.04s: volatility products themselves so a lot
4689.84s: of people like to hedge with vixx a lot
4691.68s: of people like to hedge with vxx
4694.08s: and for me i think there's a ton of
4696.72s: potential issues with that
4698.88s: depending on the environment but curious
4700.88s: to hear your thoughts on that
4702.48s: yeah we kind of talked about earlier but
4704.16s: if you're looking at vix options
4706.48s: um long-term vix options are a no-go
4709.20s: because they are tracking
4711.68s: they're not all that vix expirations are
4713.44s: not tracking the same thing each
4715.04s: respective mix options expiration is
4717.20s: tracking that corresponding futures
4719.28s: contract and the shorter term futures
4721.68s: contracts are going to be more
4723.36s: responsive to changes in the vix
4725.52s: um so if you're trading uh if you buy
4727.68s: calls on like a 180 day vix option cycle
4731.28s: and the market collapses those calls are
4735.28s: not going to increase nearly as much as
4738.00s: a 30-day call option at the same strike
4740.00s: would and i actually um
4742.16s: my
4743.04s: project option website i actually made a
4744.80s: graph
4745.84s: of this exact scenario and i and i
4748.48s: plotted the prices of call options
4750.24s: through
4751.04s: the 2008 collapse and the long-term call
4753.76s: options
4755.28s: they they didn't increase nearly as much
4757.12s: as the shorter term options oh that's
4758.72s: pretty cool that's um that's a problem
4760.72s: there
4761.68s: and then with vxx as we talked about
4763.84s: earlier it has that very consistent
4766.00s: decay and so let's say vxx is at 30
4770.72s: and you buy the 30 strike call option
4774.40s: as a hedge because if the xx is tracking
4776.88s: the near term fixed futures if the
4778.24s: market collapses the futures go up the
4780.56s: xx goes up you can look at you know what
4783.04s: happened in 2020 to see how that goes
4785.44s: vxx exploded but the problem is if you
4788.08s: buy the 30 strike call and vxx
4792.16s: continues to decay because there's a
4793.76s: period where the market doesn't collapse
4796.24s: and now vxx is at 25
4798.88s: now instead of needing like any
4800.48s: volatility increase for your call option
4802.80s: to be in the money now you need a 20
4805.60s: increase
4806.72s: in those near-term vix futures just to
4808.96s: get back to your call strike right so as
4811.68s: time goes on and as vxx decays you need
4814.96s: a larger and larger volatility increase
4818.00s: to get back to your call strike or above
4820.80s: it because in the case of vxx it tracks
4823.52s: the daily percentage changes of
4826.64s: the near-term mix futures
4828.88s: and so
4830.80s: it's it's not even just like
4832.96s: holding those futures contracts uh like
4835.44s: bito it's tracking like the daily
4837.84s: percentage changes so the closing value
4840.48s: of ex compounds based on the daily
4843.20s: percentage changes of the futures so as
4845.60s: the dollar value of the xx gets lower
4848.72s: you need a higher percentage change in
4851.12s: the near-term vix futures for that lower
4853.60s: dollar amount to
4855.60s: get back to your call strike right so i
4857.20s: don't know if that makes sense but
4858.08s: there's like a mathematical decay to it
4860.24s: the lower vxx
4862.16s: gets
4863.36s: relative to your call strike the higher
4866.40s: the volatility spike needs to be to get
4868.64s: back to your calls trick or above it
4870.48s: right so
4871.68s: um if you're going to use vxx to combat
4874.24s: that instead of doing a longer term vxx
4877.60s: call like 30 or 60 days you could do
4880.96s: a much shorter term
4882.80s: call option so like maybe like a seven
4885.28s: day and then every time they expire you
4887.68s: can roll that call strike down
4890.24s: right and re stay more sensitive
4892.88s: so that it stays closer to the actual
4895.12s: vxx price itself but again it's going to
4897.44s: be a very costly trade to put on so and
4900.32s: like you said especially
4901.84s: and that's like i always think the
4903.12s: dichotomy of hedging where you know you
4906.64s: don't want to hedge perpetually because
4908.16s: it's expensive but then you also don't
4909.60s: want to hedge when your house is on fire
4911.36s: so it's a bit of a
4913.12s: bit of a nuanced discussion i think when
4915.12s: it goes to effective portfolio hedging
4917.84s: but i think for me it comes down like
4920.64s: the most effective way is just risk
4922.32s: management in terms of what you're
4923.60s: offering the market it's the most
4924.80s: effective and um
4926.96s: but
4927.68s: to your point i think that there are
4929.12s: some reasonable ways to deal with
4931.12s: derivatives
4932.32s: for a period of time
4934.16s: my preferable ways are
4936.16s: number one look at your largest
4937.84s: positions and go into those
4940.40s: number two hedge in ways that is
4943.20s: that is not
4945.92s: it's not costly so an example would be
4948.32s: like my call strategy yep in
4950.56s: microstrategy if i have those long calls
4952.80s: and then the stock price rips higher
4954.80s: shorting those higher strike calls is a
4956.64s: way of hedging because i collect premium
4959.12s: into my account and basically if i
4960.88s: create those risk-free spreads then i
4962.64s: take all the risk off the table but i'm
4964.56s: not paying any money out of my account
4966.64s: right get that protection i'm basically
4969.84s: i'm collecting premium by creating a
4972.00s: spread and it's reducing my overall
4974.72s: delta exposure and also resetting my
4978.96s: cost overall it's reducing the cost of
4981.12s: my position because if i pay 10 grand
4983.20s: for that first call option and then
4985.28s: later and the stock price is higher i
4987.36s: collect 10 grand to short a higher
4989.44s: strike call now i have a risk-free
4991.36s: position and that's a way to hedge
4994.00s: my portfolio risk because then if both
4996.16s: of those options expire worthless i
4998.48s: don't lose anything whereas if i didn't
5001.44s: put on that hedge and now the stock
5003.60s: price is below my initial long call well
5005.84s: then i lose the 10 grand right so that's
5008.32s: a way of hedging but it's not like a
5010.32s: hedge where i'm buying puts which is
5012.56s: just a pure expense right yeah yeah i
5015.52s: think that's a and that's one of the fun
5017.20s: discussions about hedging or really
5018.72s: options in general it's just a very uh
5021.12s: fluid environment where you can like you
5023.04s: said you can approach positions you can
5024.48s: approach portfolio you can use
5025.92s: correlations yeah i i think that that's
5028.40s: a
5029.12s: um a really fun way of looking at it
5032.16s: um so
5033.44s: we've obviously been chatting for for a
5035.84s: minute there there is kind of
5038.40s: one
5039.52s: one other question that i want to make
5040.88s: sure that we get to
5042.56s: um and it's
5044.64s: just talking about trading in lower
5047.28s: implied volatility environments like
5049.36s: like i was telling you about before
5050.56s: that's something that one of my viewers
5051.92s: mentioned
5052.96s: um that that you were talking about i'm
5055.28s: not exactly sure the context so i don't
5056.96s: wanna you know um frame it any other way
5059.60s: since it's your words but essentially i
5062.48s: would be curious from my perspective
5064.64s: just to understand like
5067.12s: what the [ __ ] they're talking about just
5068.80s: in terms of like what's the context
5070.32s: behind that and then also
5072.08s: um how do you arrive at that kind of
5074.24s: thought process the context around it is
5077.60s: there is
5080.32s: there's
5081.28s: a camp of people who
5083.60s: they like high volatility trading so
5085.84s: they like they like shorting options
5088.24s: when
5089.52s: volatility is high
5091.28s: because when volatility is high then you
5093.04s: get
5093.76s: higher or more expensive option prices
5096.16s: and then you short the more expensive
5097.68s: options
5098.40s: and ideally you see a decrease in market
5101.52s: volatility or
5103.52s: you're
5104.48s: the increase in volatility actually
5105.92s: allows you to sell options that are
5107.28s: further out of the money right so you're
5109.12s: hoping that you don't have swings that
5111.04s: exceed those strike prices
5113.44s: so
5114.80s: the thought process is that you're
5116.56s: you're selling more expensive options
5118.72s: and therefore that's good because
5120.64s: selling more expensive options is better
5122.48s: than
5123.28s: selling less expensive options and i
5125.76s: argue against it because
5127.68s: option prices scale with realized
5130.32s: volatility
5131.84s: so if you have
5134.32s: if you have a 15 vix
5136.80s: and you're shorting options
5138.72s: and then you go to a 30 vix and you're
5140.16s: shorting options
5141.52s: you're going to have
5142.80s: much more expensive options that you're
5144.56s: selling in the 30 vix environment but
5147.44s: you don't have the same level of
5148.80s: realized volatility if you had the same
5150.72s: level of realized volatility meaning
5152.40s: like the actual fluctuations in the
5154.48s: market
5155.68s: and you compare to 15 to 30 vicks then
5157.92s: yes it would be better to short the more
5160.16s: expensive options given the same amount
5162.08s: of market volatility but that's not how
5164.00s: it works because
5166.40s: realized volatility and implied
5168.16s: volatility aka option prices they move
5171.20s: in lockstep and there's a chart that i
5173.28s: made
5174.40s: that was basically a scatter plot that
5176.40s: looked at
5177.60s: realized volatility in the s p
5179.92s: and
5180.72s: the vix index
5182.80s: and basically it's like a perfectly
5186.16s: correlated line it's the best it's my
5188.08s: favorite chart i've ever made for sure
5190.00s: analyzed because it very clearly shows
5192.16s: that as realized volatility goes up so
5194.56s: as the market starts to fluctuate more
5197.44s: option prices get more expensive because
5200.00s: with larger
5201.76s: price swings in the underlying asset
5204.40s: then there's a larger expected potential
5206.96s: value for an option
5208.88s: because if you have an at the money
5210.32s: option with a five dollar expected move
5213.28s: versus a at the money option with a
5215.52s: fifteen dollar expected move
5217.36s: that fifteen dollar expected move means
5219.44s: that that option that at the money
5220.80s: option has
5222.56s: the potential to be worth a lot more
5224.80s: than right in the lower volatility
5226.32s: scenario and so the option prices aka
5229.52s: implied volatility they're the same
5230.96s: exact thing
5232.48s: implied volatility comes from option
5233.92s: prices so like option prices increase
5236.48s: with market volatility
5239.04s: and another thing that
5240.80s: the other thing that it comes from is
5243.20s: there's a book i think it's called
5244.24s: volatility trading by
5246.32s: euan sinclair i don't know if i'm saying
5247.84s: his name right but
5249.76s: he basically did an in-depth study that
5252.40s: showed
5253.52s: selling options in lower
5256.08s: implied volatility environments
5258.48s: had a higher
5260.08s: expectancy
5263.20s: than shorting options in higher and
5265.52s: higher volatility environments and
5267.84s: actually what surprises you know he
5270.00s: showed that
5271.04s: the higher the more extreme the the
5273.60s: volatility gets
5275.92s: there's actually like negative
5278.08s: expectancy and he um it's not expectancy
5281.76s: but the volatility risk premium is what
5283.52s: he's talking about so basically in like
5285.04s: lower volatility environments
5286.96s: when the markets are calm
5288.88s: even though you're selling cheaper
5290.16s: options they had more of a
5293.36s: more of an edge that you captured versus
5295.60s: when the market was much more volatile
5297.84s: and you were shorting more expensive
5299.84s: options and actually like flipped
5301.76s: negatives like that's interesting in the
5304.16s: times where you had hyper market
5306.24s: volatility and you shorted options
5309.12s: there was actually like a loss
5310.72s: expectancy i'm you have to read the book
5313.68s: to get some actual numbers because it's
5315.04s: been a while since i read it but that
5316.16s: was the gist of it it basically showed
5318.16s: that shorting options in lower
5319.68s: volatility environments was more
5322.32s: profitable
5323.52s: than shorting options in higher
5325.20s: volatility environments the other thing
5327.36s: is that we don't have
5329.52s: we don't have a lot of data
5332.64s: on
5333.92s: like ultra high
5335.44s: volatility market environments because
5337.36s: they typically don't last that long
5339.12s: right
5340.08s: and so
5341.20s: we have much more data in the lower
5343.68s: volatility camp as we that we do
5346.72s: in the extreme high volatility so like
5349.60s: vixx above 50 for example so for just a
5353.04s: quick question for for context when you
5355.44s: say low iv
5357.52s: versus high iv like what what values are
5360.32s: you assigning those low iv i'm thinking
5364.64s: ballpark like 15 vicks okay but i would
5367.76s: say like less than
5369.60s: less than 20. i think the historical
5371.60s: average i haven't actually lived in it's
5373.44s: like 17 or 18. yeah so like the i think
5376.08s: the average is like 19 and the median is
5378.32s: like 17 and a half yeah um
5381.28s: so yeah i would say
5383.12s: probably like under 17 and a half closer
5385.84s: to 15 that would be really low
5388.00s: um
5389.36s: but then in the high regime i would say
5393.36s: probably over
5394.72s: over 30 35
5396.56s: okay
5397.44s: i'm not saying that you can't make money
5400.32s: shorting options in high iv
5402.88s: and i'm not saying it's easy to make
5404.40s: money shorting options in low iv
5406.40s: i'm just saying that
5408.16s: it's not like a clear no-brainer holy
5410.80s: grail answer like some people think it
5412.80s: is that part i agree with yeah because i
5415.12s: think i think a lot of folks just in
5417.20s: general try to come up with some sort of
5419.84s: persistent rule that always applies and
5422.56s: i just think you know it doesn't really
5424.48s: exist much in trading yes
5426.80s: i like rules yes yep and i i think
5429.52s: having guiding
5430.96s: i think having got it
5432.64s: there's no holy grail like you can't say
5434.64s: like selling vicks above selling options
5436.64s: vixx above 30 is like always a
5438.16s: no-brainer other than selling may go
5440.24s: away you know that one's wrong i'm just
5442.16s: kidding that one always works
5444.80s: um but yeah no i i really do agree with
5447.20s: the points that that you raise i think
5449.76s: some of the things that i think about
5451.84s: um
5452.64s: would be
5454.00s: just the overstatement of volatility and
5457.12s: how that changes
5459.20s: in different volatility levels i think
5462.08s: that's an important integration of the
5463.84s: conversation and then the other thing
5465.92s: that i do think is worth mentioning
5467.44s: because i i do sell a lot of premium
5470.56s: um
5471.44s: is just the risk
5473.68s: that we're exposed to because if you
5475.52s: sell implied volatility well really if
5478.08s: you sell premium in a low implied
5479.68s: volatility environment one you have the
5481.60s: same directional risk but then you also
5483.36s: have the now the volatility risk yeah in
5485.84s: terms of you know the the expansion
5488.08s: hurting the position so i think
5490.88s: exactly like you said it really for me
5493.44s: at least it's very environment dependent
5496.32s: and i also agree with
5498.32s: kind of the range that you give because
5500.40s: i do think that once implied volatility
5502.88s: in general or volatility in general
5505.12s: exceeds a certain level it does become a
5507.20s: bit more of a crap shoot and yeah really
5509.68s: in the same case
5511.20s: yeah in the same camp as you one of the
5513.28s: things that i think a lot of people
5514.56s: forsake they're like
5516.32s: sell premium when it's high volatility
5518.48s: oh i'm making all this money you know
5519.76s: all this money and the thing that i
5522.08s: always kind of let people know it's like
5524.16s: there's a reason for that because the
5526.32s: expected moves are that much larger
5528.88s: at this point in time so it's not like
5530.40s: you're just making more money and i feel
5532.32s: like a lot of people just feel that way
5534.48s: arbitrarily it's uh
5537.20s: getting back to the house example it's
5538.56s: like you can make a lot of money selling
5540.48s: fire insurance when there's no fires you
5542.72s: just collect the premiums that's low iv
5545.12s: yeah but then if you if you're selling
5547.28s: the premiums
5549.52s: at low iv and then the house burns down
5551.28s: then you have a big payout and you're
5553.76s: you're on the hook right so you have to
5555.60s: control the risk um
5558.16s: but then on the other hand like if
5559.92s: you're selling fire insurance on a house
5562.00s: that's burning down like that's
5564.16s: that doesn't seem like a good idea in a
5566.08s: lot of cases because
5567.76s: basically you're betting that you can
5570.48s: put out the fire
5572.24s: faster than the damages can accrue to
5574.32s: the
5575.12s: the premium that you sold that right
5578.08s: you know
5579.04s: so it's
5580.48s: yeah it's all all i'm trying to say is
5582.64s: that there's it's not a holy grail it's
5584.16s: not like this is better than that it's
5587.36s: option prices scale with market
5588.96s: volatility and just because you're
5591.84s: getting higher premiums when selling
5594.16s: your options
5595.28s: doesn't mean that it's a no-brainer
5596.64s: because you also have larger
5598.64s: larger swings in the asset
5600.64s: absolutely and i like i i literally
5602.64s: couldn't agree more with that and i
5603.76s: think
5604.56s: um a lot of folks like we're talking
5607.04s: about they kind of want something that's
5608.80s: like simple concise and always the case
5612.16s: and unfortunately other than just buying
5615.20s: an index etf or something like that and
5616.96s: coming back in 20 years it's all it's
5618.88s: all crap shoot mm-hmm
5621.60s: well i definitely
5624.08s: just really enjoyed the conversation i
5625.76s: don't want to take much more of your
5626.72s: time i know that good one but yeah i
5628.96s: gotta go here soon i gotta yeah dinner
5631.28s: and
5632.16s: um wind down yeah for sure man so i mean
5635.28s: would love to do you know another one in
5637.04s: the future is always i i think the the
5639.60s: conversations at least are just really
5642.00s: candid i get a lot of value out of
5644.40s: talking with somebody from a different
5645.84s: perspective that's most of the fun
5648.80s: so yeah so thanks for hanging out for a
5650.48s: bit and definitely looking forward to
5652.16s: connecting again
5654.32s: take care brother
5655.44s: yeah you too
