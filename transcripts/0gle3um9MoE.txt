0.00s: What's up, Elias?
1.80s: Got three things for the market update today.
4.40s: First, we're going to talk about dollar general.
6.40s: Then we're going to talk about the tech sector.
8.00s: Then we're going to talk about game stop.
9.60s: Let's get right to it.
10.40s: So the first thing is dollar general had a hell of a day today.
15.40s: And as you can tell, it closed at the bottom of this candle.
20.00s: It just got shoved down all day.
22.60s: It tried to rally a little bit post earnings.
25.60s: And it's earnings wasn't a bismal,
28.40s: but it definitely wasn't good.
31.20s: So we can take a look through what happened.
33.40s: This was before the market opened.
35.60s: And it dropped over 25%.
39.20s: And we can see that it came in at 170 per share,
42.20s: which is down from 213 year over year.
46.00s: And it was expected at 179.
48.20s: Net sales came in 1021, 10.21 billion,
53.40s: which actually expanded.
55.20s: That doesn't seem too bad to me.
58.40s: But this is the big problem.
60.40s: So it expects fiscal 2024, EPS of 550 to 620 in sales growth,
66.80s: 4.75 to 5.3% which is down.
70.60s: So yeah, this is one of the things that you'll find with forward guidance
75.00s: is this exact kind of scenario.
77.20s: The market was originally expecting it at 712.
80.20s: This obviously is really missing that to the downside,
83.80s: unfortunately for them.
85.40s: So they are behind the curve here.
88.00s: Now the other thing I want to take a look at with you is just the indices,
92.20s: but specifically tech because tech really had a pretty big problem out here.
97.80s: So if we take a look at first the sectors,
102.80s: and we can see what's going on here,
104.60s: tech is still, this is now in a negative sloping channel.
108.60s: Like this is very clearly trending down.
112.20s: And we're still seeing relative weakness across quite a few of the sectors,
116.40s: but it definitely looks like to me tech is leading us to the downside.
121.20s: The S&P 500 is staying a little more resilient, trending sideways here,
124.80s: but tech is in the picture.
127.00s: That's one of the biggest things that I see here.
129.80s: And if we take a look across the indices,
133.80s: we can see that again, Q's, which is a little more tech heavy than the others,
137.80s: is already moving down towards these moving averages.
141.00s: Yes, MPA 500 still has a little bit of room here before it starts rotating over,
144.40s: but then we're seeing the Russell actually bucking the trend.
148.60s: Vix is down.
151.20s: Curious, huh?
152.70s: So Vix is down, market is down.
154.50s: That happens sometimes.
155.50s: It's not quite as infrequent as people might think,
158.00s: but still interesting to see this slowing amidst the rest of this seaming,
164.80s: potential sell-off accelerating.
167.00s: It's a little too early to tell.
168.30s: Now quick recap on Nvidia.
170.50s: I was curious how it was going to fare today.
172.10s: And I actually fell a little more than I expected earlier in the day was hovering right around
177.30s: 120s that seemed about where it was going to be.
180.00s: And then it looked like it was being held up,
182.20s: propped up pretty strong, actually by people interested in it,
185.90s: but they just couldn't hold on.
188.00s: And there's a massive sale candle today with over 89% sale volume.
192.80s: So people were just unwinding here.
194.20s: And I get it.
195.70s: This was a pretty interesting earnings release because it was so,
199.30s: so focused on Nvidia and the impact of the broader market.
202.90s: And then the tone for AI, all these kinds of things are so topical right now.
207.70s: So I totally get it.
209.40s: But it's just a little more emotional than I was expecting.
212.40s: It seemed like it was hanging in there and then it just kind of broke down the rest of the day.
216.00s: So yeah, this is interesting to me,
219.00s: but something that I think is not unexpected after its earnings.
223.10s: Because again, I was talking about this before the earnings in here need it to be perfect
227.90s: in order for it to continue this kind of parabolic ascent.
231.60s: So it doesn't surprise me that we find ourselves in this scenario with Nvidia.
236.90s: The way I'm looking at tech right now is it still to me is very promising long term.
242.60s: But short term, it looks a little weaker and something that I'm definitely going to be minding my exposure in.
250.30s: So now we need to take a look at GameStop.
253.20s: Because GameStop had a great day today.
256.40s: And again, it's not like a huge day,
259.20s: but I am so stoked that it started coming into this value area.
265.20s: And immediately started rejecting right back out.
268.20s: Like that was great for me to see us.
270.40s: Very, very happy with that.
272.20s: I still see RSI both raw RSI and the EMA below the 50 handles.
277.60s: So I don't love that from just a general strength picture.
282.00s: But this was a good day in here.
283.90s: And the other thing is we can see the volume really stepped up big time.
288.00s: Again, it's really hard to see because the volume is so skewed by all this noise back here.
293.00s: But if you take a look at the volume today was 10.3 million shares with 53% by volume.
301.00s: And the 20 day average volume is only 5.
304.60s: And the 5 day average volume is 5.7.
307.60s: So this is two times the average midterm 20 day and short term volume.
312.60s: So there are a lot of people stepping out here that really liked it at this point.
316.40s: So that was sick.
317.40s: I was really, really happy with that.
319.40s: And again, we do have earnings coming up in here.
322.60s: Come the tenth after the market closes.
327.80s: So now the other thing is I took a look through just the options flow for both games
333.60s: stop and chewy to see if anything stuck out to me.
336.20s: Not a lot if I'm being completely honest with you.
338.80s: But there were a few more transactions that came in above 100,000.
342.40s: But it's still just five.
344.20s: So there's not a tremendous amount of activity and a lot of it is further out in time.
348.80s: So we see these 26 explorations.
351.20s: Let me see this 25 expiration.
353.00s: So a lot of it is generally longer term in nature.
357.80s: So yeah, just not quite as much going on there.
360.00s: We're just okay.
361.00s: It's still relatively quiet in here.
364.40s: So if we take a look at the options, let's take a look at the volume.
368.40s: Today we had 211,000 calls trade against 47,000 puts, which this is actually quite a lot.
374.60s: And 30 August super active.
377.00s: And we can see the six set was also fairly active.
379.80s: My expectation here is that we'll continue to see both of these walls rise as they are.
385.80s: And I think that we start building out this 13 set sooner rather than later.
391.00s: That's my guess.
392.60s: So if we take a look at the open interest, 576,000 calls against 280,000 puts,
398.80s: general calls queue in here, not super heavy, but it's still there, which is good to see.
405.40s: And we can see though that a lot of these calls are actually further out in time,
409.60s: which is generally anomalous.
411.40s: So the 17,000, 25s.
413.40s: That's where a lot of the largest positions are,
415.80s: which again, previously we would see much more of that in the near term explorations.
420.80s: The 30 Augs have one 10 against 29k on the put side.
425.80s: So strong call skew here, but we'll take a look at how many of those are out of the money.
430.40s: I would imagine the majority.
432.40s: And the 13 set of expressions still real quiet.
435.00s: 25k calls against 10,000 puts.
437.40s: So we'll see if we start getting that build out in the earnings expiration cycle.
441.80s: It's not quite there yet, but it's getting there.
445.00s: Now the last thing I want to talk about with respect to game stop is, as I look through the order flow here,
452.00s: I see a really healthy mix across explorations, which again, this is not so much the case that I've typically seen in the product.
460.20s: I generally see this specific ticker.
463.40s: Look like the majority of volume tends to be centralized in the front explorations.
468.20s: And we can still see some elements of that, right?
470.00s: Like all these 30 Augs.
472.00s: It's still happening to a degree, but I am seeing way more other explorations pop up on this list.
479.00s: Doesn't really mean a whole lot.
480.20s: It just means that we're not hyper concentrated in the front expiration.
483.60s: Like we have been previously.
485.20s: And I draw your attention to it simply because it is an observation that I have.
489.20s: There's not a lot to take away from it.
491.20s: As of now, it's something that we track the changes.
493.80s: That's how a lot of this stuff works.
495.20s: There's not always a takeaway directly from the individual observation, but the trend of an observation.
502.80s: So that's just something generally new to add into the mix.
507.40s: All right, gang.
508.40s: That wraps me up for today.
509.60s: As always, let me know if there's anything you want me to take a look at.
511.80s: Be an outlier.
512.80s: And I'll see you guys on the live session tomorrow.
515.40s: That you guys are there.
