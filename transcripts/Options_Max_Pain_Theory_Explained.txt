0.00s: Max Payne Theory and options what is it
4.02s: we're going to talk about exactly that
5.58s: we're going to start with what it isn't
7.02s: then what it is then how you can use it
9.36s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
10.98s: back to all the outliers a shout out to
12.72s: the patreon family you guys make
14.28s: creating content like this possible and
16.14s: if you enjoy my content consider signing
18.30s: up helps me out a bunch so as per usual
20.34s: I want to start with what it isn't and
23.10s: if you're like me and you were playing
24.96s: video games in the late 90s early 2000s
27.12s: you would think it's this dude which is
28.92s: kind of like OG to the taken guy it's
31.56s: the video game where his family was
34.38s: killed and he was a undercover detective
36.90s: that's not the Max Payne we're talking
38.40s: about today next we have that feeling
41.10s: you have in the bottom of your stomach
43.56s: when you open up your portfolio and this
46.44s: is what you see where you're down 94 all
50.46s: time that is also not Max Payne although
53.76s: both technically are also Max Payne
56.94s: let's talk about what it actually is so
60.00s: first off I want to start with kind of a
62.88s: quick definition from Investopedia you
65.46s: can read that at your leisure I'm going
67.44s: to summarize it for you because I mean
69.54s: that's what I'm here for and essentially
71.22s: it's the strike price in an individual
73.68s: series meaning an expiration cycle where
76.38s: the most options expire worthless why
80.16s: does that matter well there's a couple
82.14s: things that lead into that the first
84.60s: being this bullet point right here the
87.24s: Assumption we start with is that on the
90.12s: counter side to most purchased options
93.36s: are market makers they're the people
95.52s: that typically make markets so if a lot
97.50s: of people are buying options they're
98.76s: typically selling options and there's a
100.92s: reason why this is important it's
102.42s: because market makers tend to hedge
104.82s: their positions so they have the ability
106.32s: to move rice at least somewhat but those
109.50s: same sellers they would much rather the
112.32s: options they sold expire worthless it's
115.26s: just a simpler transaction for them they
116.88s: don't have to move any inventory there's
118.92s: no weekend risk and anything like that
120.84s: so the theory in general is market
123.84s: makers are the vast majority of sellers
126.18s: out there on the Open Marketplace they
128.04s: would prefer their options to expire
129.90s: worthless so come expiration day they
132.96s: are then incentivized to quite literally
135.38s: manipulate the price of the stock to
138.90s: land at maximum pain and I'm going to
141.36s: show you exactly how to find what that
143.16s: looks like on the left hand side over
144.72s: here we have the calculations for it
146.46s: there's a lot of websites that do it for
148.02s: you but I'm also just going to show it
149.46s: to you in thinkorswim because that's the
150.84s: platform I use and then I'm sure you can
152.28s: find a proxy if you use any sort of
154.56s: regular platform cough cough probably
157.02s: not Robin Hood but other than
159.12s: those dorks come on man you had one
161.88s: fatal flaw Robin Hood such a dork most
165.60s: things will give you a proxy for maximum
167.76s: pain although they may or may not call
169.02s: it that and I'll show you what that
169.98s: looks like in a second but first let's
171.66s: understand how it's calculated what we
173.22s: need to do is understand the series
175.62s: value for all of the individual strikes
178.86s: in an expiration site cycle so what does
180.90s: that mean well if we pop open the
182.58s: platform here let's say we're going to
184.14s: go to the 25 July expiration and
186.66s: typically you want to use the closest
188.22s: expiration it's really prevalent on
190.38s: expiration date itself but because I'm
192.54s: filming this over a weekend there is no
194.22s: zero DTE available right now but this
196.32s: will serve as a proxy essentially what
198.18s: we need to do is see where the vast
200.58s: majority of option value exists so
203.10s: there's two things we have to look at
204.18s: one is the open interest which is this
206.40s: column and then we have to look at the
208.74s: intrinsic value because essentially that
210.66s: would be the value if it expired in the
212.46s: money so you do that for all of the
214.86s: options again there's a simple way to do
216.78s: it don't worry I'm just explaining how
218.82s: it's actually calculated once you get
220.98s: the value for all of the options in that
223.26s: chain then we understand the series the
226.14s: expiration cycle value and we need to
229.62s: find the specific strike price where the
232.74s: vast majority of the greatest value as a
236.10s: dollar amount of options expire
238.02s: worthless that's the maximum change
239.88s: strikes get it pain strikes I hope
242.10s: somebody picked that up and then down
243.54s: here like I said it does become more
246.12s: pronounced when expiration cycle gets
248.10s: closer and that's because that's when a
249.96s: lot of hedging is happening and again
252.06s: this comes into play at expiration when
254.64s: the options are about to expire so we
256.86s: talked a little bit about what it's not
258.78s: now hopefully we have an idea of what it
261.54s: is but before I show you exactly how to
263.64s: find it in the platform I want you to
265.56s: take a look at this study not going to
267.12s: go through it in detail here you are
268.56s: more than capable of looking this up on
270.42s: ssrn as I always say you shouldn't take
272.94s: my word for any of this stuff I'm
274.74s: literally just a dude that talks on the
277.02s: internet like all the other Finance
278.88s: content creator YouTubers we're just
281.10s: people sharing anecdotes essentially I
283.80s: have a really comprehensive data set on
286.26s: this actually but mine's not peer
288.36s: reviewed this is and this is actually a
290.34s: pretty recent study this is from 19
291.60s: November 2022 and it says no Max Payne
294.48s: no gains stock return predictability at
296.70s: option expiration and there are some
298.80s: actually really interesting bits in here
300.42s: so I've highlighted those for you but
302.10s: let's take a look this says we construct
303.90s: a measure of potential max pain gain
306.60s: loss sort stocks according to this
308.34s: measure and find that a spread portfolio
311.10s: that buys High Max paying stock and
313.62s: sells Low Max Payne stocks generates
315.54s: large positive and statistically
317.46s: significant returns and Alphas so
319.62s: essentially what that entire line means
321.90s: if you're new to reading these kinds of
323.58s: things it means that there's an
325.20s: observable tradable Trend then down here
327.42s: it says our results provide strong
329.10s: evidence of stock return predictability
330.96s: at the expiration of options we find
332.70s: that these returns reverse after options
335.28s: expiration that's super important
337.02s: because this is talking about stock
338.94s: manipulation the fact that it happens at
341.22s: expiration but then reverses post would
343.32s: definitely be indicative of some sort of
345.06s: Market Force causing that movement and
346.68s: then the last thing here this is
348.06s: probably the most important thing
349.02s: because I can already see the dollar
350.40s: signs lighting up in your eyes but it
352.62s: says our results are especially strong
354.90s: for relatively small in a liquid stocks
357.78s: so all the people that are out there
359.52s: Trading zero DTE options I will tell you
361.92s: that there is some semblance of it
363.42s: existing but it's very difficult for
365.22s: those to be moved index like SPX or even
368.40s: spy there's a lot of money in those
370.38s: indices so now let's take a quick look
373.80s: on how we can find it so for example
376.44s: what I'm going to do is pull up some
378.42s: options product depth details and right
381.18s: now I have it set to show me the average
383.64s: so this is combining calls and puts into
387.60s: one individual chart for me it's easier
390.30s: to see the other thing you'll notice
391.50s: over here is I have intrinsic value so
393.36s: if we go back really quick and we take a
395.82s: look at if you'll recall the calculation
397.92s: we need to calculate the intrinsic value
399.96s: so that's exactly what we're doing here
402.36s: I'm finding the spot where the intrinsic
405.66s: value is actually the lowest because
407.94s: again that will tell me that that's
409.56s: where maximum pain lives so if we take a
412.02s: look at this graph we can change it to
414.00s: be whatever series you want you want to
415.80s: isolate whatever expiration cycle you're
417.42s: looking at so going off of this 25 July
419.52s: series is we can see that maximum pain
421.62s: is right around 45 32 is what I would
424.44s: say options you know it has to move in
426.78s: the full strike price so even though
428.22s: this will show you you know distances
429.96s: between strikes meaning it goes from you
431.94s: know 4 400 and then it has decimal point
434.10s: the strikes don't have a decimal point
435.48s: so you just round and you get kind of
437.28s: the closest idea that you have based on
439.02s: what I'm seeing here it's right around
440.10s: like 45 maybe 30 yeah it's like right or
444.48s: somewhere right around 45 35 something
446.70s: like that and what this is really
448.44s: showing us is if I actually change this
450.42s: to open interest we can find the strikes
453.96s: where there's a lot of depth and
456.66s: realistically you would want to do it
457.98s: for calls and puts so that you can get
459.60s: an idea on you know where that strike
461.28s: might live but we can see again pretty
463.74s: simply if you just use this tool over
465.90s: here that we can see the intrinsic value
468.12s: and again we want it to be combined if
470.28s: it's not combined it's kind of more
471.72s: difficult to find now let's take a look
473.70s: at what this looks like in practice I
475.62s: actually went into thinkorswim and I ran
478.68s: this in on demand so this is kind of the
481.56s: tool where you can look back in time and
483.30s: so this is one clip I think this was
485.40s: from 2018 March of 2018 is when I went
488.94s: back to in time it's just a random day
490.62s: so I went to the open of the day there
493.26s: and it was 275 87 in spy and maximum
498.06s: pain at that point in time was 276. I
501.18s: want to show you something this is at
502.38s: the end of the day this is right after
503.64s: the close it closed at 278.76 maximum
507.30s: pain was then 278. what happened Eric
510.06s: you just said at the open of the day it
511.86s: was 276 but then it was 278. alas
514.52s: markets move they don't stay static
517.32s: that's actually one of the issues with
519.30s: using this as a strategy is some people
521.58s: believe that once you understand maximum
523.62s: pain at one point in time that you're
525.00s: good that you're set you know where it's
526.44s: probably gonna get pinned to if it's
528.24s: likely to get pinned but the problem is
529.92s: is options move the vast majority of
532.38s: options 60 of them are traded before
535.44s: expiration it's an important figure
537.30s: because what that means is this isn't a
539.04s: static data if you want to try to use
541.50s: this it typically is a little bit more
543.54s: effective to be closer to actual
545.82s: expiration and then the other thing is
547.56s: depending on where maximum pain lives if
550.44s: we're 10 points off of Maximum pain
552.84s: probably not going to Trend to maximum
555.12s: pain that's a really difficult leap to
557.28s: make because again it's really important
558.84s: to remember that if we're very close to
561.36s: maximum pain it is entirely possible for
563.88s: Market manipulation to occur so that
565.74s: market makers can just bump price just a
568.14s: bit and that's what that study indicates
569.88s: observing so is this the Silver Bullet
573.06s: you now have the secret recipe to making
575.28s: money and options unfortunately no
577.08s: you're still going to struggle like the
578.58s: rest of us but this is an interesting
580.38s: phenomenon so my suggestion to people is
583.56s: if you're interested in this kind of
584.94s: stuff track it take a look at it for the
587.16s: next few weeks going forward with things
589.08s: like spy and SPX there's an expiration
591.24s: nearly every day so you could do this
593.04s: you can create a data sample like really
595.08s: quick now with all the expirations
596.52s: available to us and you can see does it
598.68s: Trend to this or does it not and then
600.48s: you can start to think about different
601.68s: trait hypothesis that you use around
603.66s: that so for example personally I like to
605.70s: trade zero DTE SPX short straddles
608.10s: sometimes iron flies and I purposefully
610.98s: wait until later in the day and I will
613.92s: look at maximum pain that's not the
615.96s: Center of My Universe for the trade but
617.94s: it's an additive input because then if I
620.52s: realize that we're a couple points off
622.38s: of Maximum pain I might tend to move my
625.62s: strikes a little bit or wait a little
627.66s: bit longer until I kind of get some
629.46s: confirmation if we're moving in that
630.72s: direction it's the kind of thing that
632.46s: there is efficacy behind it but this
634.38s: isn't going to fix all your problems so
636.24s: if you have any questions any follow-ups
