544.00s: they did
546.00s: they might
548.00s: right now
550.00s: they got rid of it
552.00s: they got rid of it
554.00s: they got rid of it
556.00s: they got rid of it
558.00s: that's
560.00s: frustrating
562.00s: a
564.00s: If any of you have thinkorswim,
566.08s: can one of you pop on and see if under the analyze tab,
570.52s: if earnings is in there?
573.96s: Is that looks like super gone?
576.60s: I don't see it on anything.
577.68s: That's super frustrating.
581.48s: I hope they didn't get rid of that.
582.44s: Maybe it's just a penning update or something.
584.64s: Hopefully my stuff's just jacked up.
586.56s: They got rid of that.
587.40s: That would be really frustrating.
590.60s: But we'll use O rats because there's his working.
595.68s: And if you take a look at its prior earnings,
597.92s: it's been a bit of a shotgun blast.
599.60s: It's been at the end of the ranges,
601.28s: pretty much most of the recent history.
604.20s: And it's been suffering some downside moves
607.04s: that are like pretty outsized.
610.40s: So right now it's plotting 6.9% implied.
615.68s: So we'll see what the actual is.
617.08s: That's actually a decent edge over the actual move,
619.80s: but I still think it might be insufficient.
622.36s: The way that I'm screening for earnings plays,
624.16s: this time is actually,
626.40s: Tommy says I have earnings in analyze tab.
629.32s: What the hell?
631.52s: Where's mine?
633.00s: Yo, they did me dirty.
634.68s: I might have to like reset my thing or whatever.
637.16s: That's, well, it's at least good
639.16s: that they didn't get rid of it
639.92s: because that's a super useful tab.
642.00s: So thank you for confirming Tommy.
644.12s: But sucks for me because I don't see it.
647.80s: What else?
649.40s: So that's coming up for earnings.
652.56s: We also should talk about Nvidia,
655.96s: I think because Nvidia was like the talk of the town today.
660.96s: There's a bunch of stuff going on in there.
663.40s: We can see that it popped up on like three or four
669.60s: different option scans that I run.
672.52s: And if we take a look inside, take a look at this.
676.76s: For the volume on the day,
678.40s: 1.2 million calls against 1.16 million on the put side
684.92s: and it's bearish.
686.68s: It's like real bearish in disposition, right?
689.40s: 44% at the bid on the calls and 42% at the offer on the put.
694.52s: So and this is all, take a look at this.
697.24s: This is all short term.
698.96s: So this to me looks like some sort of sympathetic positioning
704.08s: to either another earnings release coming out this week
707.76s: that market is thinking this is going to move
710.36s: sympathetically with or there might be some sort of news coming out.
714.52s: But let's see really quick.
718.00s: New AI chip for Hue.
723.08s: Let's see what this says.
730.00s: Microsoft meta app.
731.64s: Well, yeah, I just want to see what it talks about with Nvidia.
735.40s: Here we go.
736.28s: Shares fell in a report that Hue away technologies developed
740.20s: new chip called the Ascend 910D, hoping it would be more powerful
745.72s: than the H100.
748.12s: I mean, this is a pretty sad down move if that's the case, right?
751.04s: So the market moving like this on that news tells you exactly
753.92s: what it is.
754.96s: But I mean more broadly,
758.12s: this just is in a very, very clear descending pattern at the moment.
765.72s: And my broader expectation here, though,
769.08s: is like that's actually like pretty strong positioning that you see today.
772.96s: So I don't think that that's especially what makes me say that's because
776.56s: it's also short term, right?
778.28s: If we take a look at where most of the expiration is being traded on this
782.80s: call volume is, it's very, very short term.
785.80s: So that tells us that there is absolutely speculation going on in this
791.68s: front expiration, which otherwise is quiet for Nvidia, right?
795.76s: So 661,000 call volume, 500, 8, 2000 put volume,
801.64s: just for a few days from now, which is quite anomalous for Nvidia
806.80s: outside of some sort of earnings events,
809.68s: earnings event, different story for sure.
812.16s: But that's not what they have.
813.80s: So let's take a look at Nvidia a little deeper here.
821.28s: And let's see.
823.28s: Yeah, look at this.
825.16s: So it's a massive spike in bear side, put premium.
834.92s: And take a look at this, like all of the high volume contracts,
839.88s: are super short term.
844.20s: It's all three days.
845.24s: All of the high volume contracts are literally super, super, super short term.
850.20s: So I mean, that leads me to believe that they're,
856.04s: they're positioning for something.
858.28s: Now, the fact that it's so even split between calls and puts makes it a little
863.00s: more difficult, I think, to discreetly identify
868.96s: what the event is and when.
871.08s: But this has been just an interesting watch, something to put on your radar.
877.76s: For me, I'll kind of make a post about it in the discord for the pro members,
884.92s: because there's a couple of ways I think you can go about it.
886.88s: But this is something I would look to trade.
888.44s: The main thing at a cliff notes version is the, I think the direction,
895.88s: I think there's going to be a directional move.
897.40s: Based on the options positioning here.
899.60s: And if there is that directional move that I broadly would anticipate,
904.08s: my guess is that there would be a really short term opportunity for it.
908.20s: I don't think it's going to be significantly long term because of how short term
911.48s: these options are and when they're going to roll off.
914.00s: But even those options, they're going to have an impact on literally dealer positioning
918.52s: in order to hold the positions, right?
920.60s: So that activity that you saw today is absolutely going to have an impact
926.28s: on total gamma on charm and vanna.
931.48s: Really charm is going to matter more in this instance than vanna
935.08s: because of how short term these options are.
938.16s: But yeah, I mean, what is this the one tens?
944.72s: So this thing can go haywire.
950.96s: It's just a ton.
952.28s: Now they call input gamma about balances out here.
955.88s: There's not like a massive imbalance,
958.12s: but just outside the money to the north, it does, which would be surprising.
963.36s: That's not the direction I honestly would expect it to go.
966.16s: I have no idea which way it's going to go.
967.56s: But based on the fairly bearish positioning today would lead me to believe
975.32s: stronger potential for downside.
977.32s: One of the ways we can validate that is by looking at the wall surface.
985.88s: Yeah.
990.64s: Yeah.
991.64s: I mean, that pretty much that pretty much tells a whole story.
998.12s: Interesting moves in video.
1002.04s: Another one worth talking about is micron.
1008.20s: Micron popped up today, similar, slow of reasons,
1013.56s: overall trading activity.
1015.36s: But this one was slightly different in two different ways.
1018.96s: And I'll show you how the first take a look at the expirations again, more tech.
1028.24s: So this is another high tech facing company that doesn't itself have earnings coming up
1035.68s: this week.
1036.48s: But you will see a lot of very near term options being traded in it.
1041.28s: So again, it's this sympathetic move that is being expected to hit from what I can
1047.32s: tell the broad tech industry.
1049.40s: It does seem to lean a little more to the chip to the chip side of the world.
1054.24s: But this one was interesting because there was a couple pretty big positions that stuck
1060.96s: out to me.
1061.96s: So M U. Let's go to today.
1069.12s: Make sure everything else is turned off.
1076.32s: So there's a series of puts that came in at the bid.
1084.92s: And then I mean, the majority of this volume though that we saw in the front expiration,
1091.64s: these are further out in time like these bigger trades.
1094.92s: But more of the front expiration itself, not the same sizing going on.
1102.56s: So what I thought was slightly interesting about micron is that the trading activity that
1106.56s: I saw in here seemed to lend itself more so to longer term positioning.
1111.96s: Now the volume in the near term contracts is high in a total amount of volume, but it's
1117.12s: much lower in total amount of premium being traded.
1122.28s: So that's a natural skew that will happen when you're tracking options activity like
1127.80s: this because you'll, if you just use volume, it can be really misleading, right?
1134.04s: Because if you have an option that's a dollar versus an option that's 10 cents, but you
1138.00s: buy one of each complete size disparity in terms of premium, but as soon as you buy 10
1146.80s: of the 10 cents, now they look the same, although they're essentially the same value.
1153.36s: So quite prone.
1155.56s: That's why using things like open interest as a normalizer is really productive.
1161.08s: And then the same thing is tracking by premiums.
1163.44s: I also think that that's fairly productive.
1167.40s: Futures on the open here are a little soft, but not bad.
1171.84s: We also should talk about VIX.
1176.16s: VIX is at one of its lowest levels since essentially the spike that we got here back at the beginning
1184.60s: of the month.
1185.92s: But again, it's still really elevated.
1189.12s: And I want to make sure that that point is clear.
1191.36s: A lot of people they look at the move up to six days.
1193.64s: They see the move down into the mid 20s and they think, oh, wow, you know, VIX is low
1198.28s: now.
1199.40s: And by all accounts, it is not.
1202.08s: And I'll show you.
1204.00s: This is now looking out at a five year weekly.
1206.80s: What do you notice about the price level for VIX here?
1210.92s: I mean, it literally is over the majority of the occurrences on this chart.
1217.56s: So if I extend this to the left, it is a really big disparity.
1222.80s: So that's important to note because don't get caught up in this near term transition.
1229.24s: There still is really high level clustering.
1232.12s: It's been clustering above 25 essentially for like a month.
1236.48s: So the fact that it even had his soft of a day, it did today, but didn't actually go down
1242.16s: lower is again, I think, quite telling.
1246.52s: Now another thing that I do like to do is poke through VIX and see if there are big
1252.48s: trades that came through relative to other periods.
1256.80s: See, not really.
1262.16s: So if we look over the last 30 days, I'll show you when we see like bigger size trades
1268.80s: in VIX, it's like definitely north of I would call it 20 mill is when it's like a big
1273.44s: trade.
1274.76s: So if we look over the last month, I'm just trying to give you a little bit of context
1280.08s: on this.
1281.60s: So you'll see that there's a bunch that are in single digit millions.
1284.68s: It's kind of standard for something like VIX that's traded as heavy as it is.
1288.28s: So then when we go to today, and you see the largest trades were like five mill, obviously
1293.76s: big gross number of dollars, but relative to VIX, what it trades is really not that much.
1298.16s: So this qualifies actually is a pretty quiet period for VIX.
1302.48s: So the fact that it had this quiet of a period and still didn't fall down lower is worth
1310.24s: noting.
1311.68s: So what that tells us is the market is absolutely still on edge as in my opinion, it absolutely
1319.20s: should be.
1320.40s: There is no reason right now for the market to become complacent, not on edge.
1326.08s: And it's because I was posting about this in the discord a little bit last night.
1331.40s: And the conversations between us and China are fucking bizarre when it comes to tariffs.
1338.76s: Because the US is trying to position it as if like these conversations are going well,
1343.04s: China's sitting there like bitch, we didn't even talk.
1346.14s: So it's like this just absolutely weird series of positioning.
1352.84s: And it's actually getting difficult to discern from a back end perspective, like what's actually
1358.28s: happening because there's some really, really high tariffs that are set to launch.
1367.72s: And I think with those tariffs in place, depending on how long they stay in place for,
1375.08s: I mean, it can literally be absolutely destructive on a global scale.
1381.92s: So this is a game of chicken.
1383.40s: We are trying to see who's going to blink first, but it's hard to tell who's blinking
1388.16s: when because of the way that I literally, I don't feel like I can trust what the US
1392.56s: is saying.
1393.56s: I don't feel like I could trust what China is saying.
1395.52s: So then I'm kind of like, I have no fucking idea how these conversations are going.
1399.00s: Now taking that back to markets, I do believe that the markets tend to be pretty damn smart,
1404.40s: way smarter than all ever be.
1406.56s: And I can see artifacts in the broader positioning that the market is obviously still registering
1412.88s: a significant amount of volatility again for context.
1416.88s: If we look over the last five years, the average price, best fit is about 15 and a half.
1424.32s: We're 10 points higher than that.
1426.44s: That's a massive difference.
1428.40s: So even though VIX is coming down, the VIX is not low enough and it's still absolutely
1436.36s: elevated here.
1437.56s: So cliff notes for all of that is don't let this deceive you because it can be deceptive.
1444.56s: I've seen it literally.
1446.36s: There was a person that was messaging me earlier asking one of my friends asking about VIX
1452.24s: and asking why it was quote unquote so low.
1456.00s: And this obviously you know my response to that.
1459.32s: It's not.
1460.32s: It's relatively quite high.
1462.32s: Mateo says, would you show a bit more in depth how you use the software and unusual
1465.52s: whales and what's important to keep an eye on?
1467.64s: Well, I think that really is super dependent on what you're doing as a trader, like what
1471.68s: matters versus what doesn't matter.
1473.92s: Now for somebody like me, I use a lot of stuff.
1479.04s: I use options as a way to view everything.
1483.20s: So there's never a point in time where let's say for example, Tesla.
1487.08s: Tesla is a great example because of where it's at.
1490.44s: My personal opinion on Tesla is longer term, bullish, near term, really have no idea.
1498.20s: And I think it's a little bit oversold, but I do think that the valuation here isn't
1503.68s: crazy.
1504.68s: I think it actually kind of makes sense.
1506.12s: So when I'm analyzing something like Tesla, I have my baked in qualitative ideas based
1514.00s: on just the overall amount of information that I ingest from across places.
1520.20s: But then when I'm trying to figure out the behavior or potential positioning or movements
1525.12s: to come up with different trade ideas, that's when different tools specifically offered
1529.92s: by unusual whales, which full disclosure, I am an affiliate for there.
1533.64s: They don't sponsor any of the videos.
1535.00s: I don't ask them to.
1536.00s: I just use their tool where I think it naturally fits into my process because it genuinely
1541.08s: does.
1542.08s: That's one of the tools I actually like.
1544.24s: And the reason why I say that is because some of the other tools that I'm an affiliate
1548.72s: for, one of which like O rats, I like that tool a lot as well.
1553.04s: But a lot of what it provides, there are things that I already do for myself, meaning like
1557.92s: my own data set and stuff like that.
1560.36s: Whereas unusual whales is actually doing stuff that I don't do for myself.
1563.84s: So it is one of the few providers of net new information for me.
1569.60s: So the stuff that I use in there is kind of what you're similar used to seeing me poke
1574.84s: through, which is you, I like the flow feed a lot because it gives me a ton of information
1580.96s: regarding positioning for individual names.
1583.20s: This is how you can spot different trades over different timeframes for anybody that's
1586.60s: been following along on the GME series that I've been doing for GameStop and Rory and
1591.04s: Kiddy.
1592.04s: This is literally how we dissected straight up all of his trades is by using tools like this
1596.64s: to understand broader positioning.
1601.08s: I do like to use these two other tools for slightly different reasons.
1607.00s: The net flow just ties in a couple broader things that we're looking at.
1612.00s: So for example, UPS.
1617.08s: Like we were looking at before.
1619.68s: What I can do is in one spot get a sense of what's happening writ large and then to get
1627.56s: a sense of positioning.
1628.80s: Now I generally will just go down to the ticker explorer and then I'll plug it in there
1635.20s: so I can run through everything.
1637.04s: And what I mean by everything is essentially all the tools in here.
1640.20s: I use two degrees.
1641.20s: There's a couple that I don't care about.
1642.72s: I actually haven't turned off.
1644.72s: I forgot where the little tool is.
1647.28s: There's a tool that lets you customize what's on this.
1650.88s: But there's a couple things that I don't really care about.
1653.72s: But this gives you a look at some things that's really difficult to find other places.
1658.88s: The historical data and stuff like that I don't really care about.
1661.88s: But this stuff is really useful.
1664.24s: Understanding dealer positioning.
1666.12s: So Gax, Charm, Vanna, that kind of stuff.
1668.60s: So yeah, I mean that's like a quick lift notes version of just running through it at a
1672.72s: high level.
1673.72s: I also use this for stuff like sector flows.
1676.92s: But the world of dealer positioning is really interesting because it can give you a lot
1682.24s: of near term insight on how things might move in the short term.
1687.24s: So that's things like Gax, Charm, Vanna.
1690.48s: And you can definitely trade dealer positioning if it's big enough based on those.
1697.36s: And you literally can, it's one of the few things that like you can actually forecast pretty
1701.12s: well because you can see it and you can see how it's changing.
1704.56s: But it's difficult because it's not a static figure.
1707.60s: What that means is let's say that you have some sort of Gax level that looks really interesting
1712.12s: to you.
1713.44s: And it's not a closed system.
1715.44s: So as dealers might be repositioning based on the current Gax levels, then there can
1721.04s: be a bunch of new trades that come in for some other reason that then interface with the
1725.84s: system differently.
1726.84s: So I always throw that out because a lot of people when they start learning about Gax,
1731.56s: Charm, Vanna, really the impact at the ticker level, I think they start to think that they're
1737.36s: really latching on to something that has some real meat to it that you can pull a lot
1742.64s: off of with in terms of just profit.
1745.52s: But you can make money off of it.
1747.08s: But it's again, it's like all this other stuff I literally made a video earlier today
1750.44s: talking about this.
1752.04s: A lot of traders get into options trading thinking that if you trade options, you now have an
1757.56s: edge.
1758.76s: And it's not literally is not the case at all.
1760.68s: It's actually way more complex to develop an edge in options trading as compared to equities.
1765.44s: But there are just more available to you.
1768.68s: So that click that in one level it applies here.
1772.08s: Like if you learn about the concepts of dealer positioning, Gax, again, Charm, Vanna, then
1779.28s: you have some ideas, but knowing them, seeing them and inherently doesn't yield some sort
1784.68s: of edge, but you can monitor the behavior and then use that to derive at least some ideas.
1793.84s: So yeah, it's just like a general overview of the tool.
1797.64s: It's good.
1798.64s: I like it.
1799.64s: I like the guys a lot too.
1800.64s: I talk with them every once in a while just to catch up.
1803.12s: And I like them.
1804.84s: So back to the cop report, we talked about this yesterday on the pro stream, but worth
1812.60s: reiterating here for sure.
1815.00s: The main thing I want to highlight is this green line large speculators, not fucking
1819.32s: buying it.
1820.32s: What I mean by that is this dip as it's been dipping large speculators have been off
1825.42s: low.
1826.42s: And they you can call them smarter, Dumber, whatever you want, but they tend to be pretty
1834.66s: decent with their overall positioning and timing as they're lightning their trades and
1839.94s: whatnot.
1841.14s: So the COT reports really good for that.
1844.18s: I've actually done a couple sponsored videos for bar chart on their channel about the
1849.22s: COT report.
1850.86s: And I think this I wanted to validate because I was very curious how they would be viewing
1856.98s: this.
1858.50s: And when you start overlaying these different things that we talk about, you overlay
1863.62s: the fact that VIX is still at 25, although the market is moderately rebounding.
1869.02s: You overlay the fact that we saw a lot of negative leaning options activity and something
1876.54s: like Nvidia.
1877.62s: You overlay the fact that we poke at the COT report and we see that speculators have
1883.62s: actually become more net negative in equities like the humani futures, right?
1888.90s: So like you start stacking those and it gives you again, not with any degree of certainty,
1895.44s: but gives you some ideas as to what might be going on in the broader market.
1899.74s: And again, it's whatever I've already shared with you.
1902.34s: It seems like the market continues to remain in a pretty volatile place quite tenuous
1907.22s: as far as I can see.
1909.54s: And largely it doesn't look like institutions are buying this recovery much at all, which
1917.06s: leads into a lot actually about how I've been trading my positions, specifically the
1922.70s: core allocation, the coverage triangle that I've been talking to all about in SSO and
1928.94s: T-Triple Q.
1929.94s: We'll link to that in the chat for you to check out at your own leisure.
1934.42s: But I've been making a ton of near term adjustments capitalizing on the price behavior as it
1940.18s: sits.
1941.18s: So I'm actually starting to get a little itchy or specifically the T-Triple Q's position
1952.50s: and it's because it is like right on the cusp of being a really, really great position
1958.82s: that I'll be able to turn into something awesome or something that's just going to collapse
1963.86s: in front of me and eat it, it's close.
1967.14s: So I'll show you what I mean by that.
1969.54s: I don't think I made any adjustments, but first let me grab the updated version of this
1975.14s: for you here.
1978.26s: This one I'm just going to relabel so I know what it is.
1983.26s: And rename this one.
1988.82s: Okay.
1991.38s: So it didn't copy it.
2000.02s: Yeah, it looks like essentially no change from what we talked about it last, but I'll
2009.18s: show you what I'm talking about.
2011.26s: Right now in TQ's, I have essentially two tranches of puts.
2024.58s: I have some that are buried in at the 60s and then I have some at the 52s.
2029.42s: TQ's right now is trading at 5382.
2032.30s: Now there's this is overall amazing development.
2037.18s: And again, that video that I shared will talk more about it.
2039.50s: I'm not going to sit here and talk to you about how great I am as fun as that would
2042.94s: be for everybody.
2044.58s: But I want to talk mostly about just the positioning as it sits because one of the things I talked
2049.46s: about in that video, which I do echo is I don't want to be 75% invested right now in
2056.06s: this with the position as it is.
2059.58s: If this was 75% invested with this 10 lot way further out of the money, then I'm cool
2066.22s: with that.
2067.22s: And the way that I come up with how much I would like to be using at a given point in time
2073.54s: is you all know is actually kind of complex.
2076.82s: It's based on a multi factor analysis, but to give you the main thing that I care about
2083.06s: when I'm considering this is this here.
2086.54s: What is the larger range that I've seen occur previously in terms of price?
2094.30s: So we've seen price essentially go from here to here.
2099.70s: And if we eyeball what that is, it's 83.5%, 82.5%, whatever you want to call it.
2106.22s: But it's about a 83% 84% move.
2110.66s: So what that means is I also want to make sure that I'm tracking where that might manifest
2117.50s: again, because if we take a look from 93 down to 20, that's only 78.5% move.
2126.54s: So that's insufficient.
2128.42s: So then that means what if we postulates T triple Q's down to 10?
2134.26s: Well now that's an 89% move.
2136.74s: That becomes a better planning factor.
2139.06s: So when I'm thinking about the planning factor for the moves and then the subsequent scaling,
2143.38s: I'm intending to use right now, I have essentially 75% of the position tied up in this just top
2152.02s: region, which is a drop in the bucket in terms of this dropping all the way down to 10.
2156.82s: Now this goes into another conversation about this idea of units and using that to scale
2160.50s: in.
2161.50s: That's a whole other thing.
2162.50s: But somewhere has all that up to say little too much out here right now.
2167.74s: So this adjustment was fantastic though.
2172.66s: And the reason why this adjustment is fantastic is because it's the first time I was actually
2176.06s: able to take some of the short puts out of being in the money.
2180.06s: And there's a tranche now that is at least seeing some daylight.
2184.58s: But I think that the move that we're having right now again is still not super strong.
2189.94s: And seeing all of that broader negative positioning leads me to believe that it might not be
2194.90s: in all two short order that my position might be underwater again, specifically the 52s.
2201.38s: The 60s, those are good luck to them, right?
2205.46s: Those are already I write those off is some buried short puts and you know, say La V, the
2210.82s: waiting game has started on those joking aside, I'll still manage them.
2214.58s: But broadly, there's not a whole lot.
2216.38s: I'm going to be able to you know, jigger with them.
2218.70s: Now the ones that I have in 20 June though that are at the 52s.
2227.46s: These are right on the dance floor.
2230.18s: So the funny thing about this whole story is I essentially I'll show you how I figure
2238.18s: out what I need these to trade at.
2240.50s: But I essentially need them to trade real real cheap.
2243.38s: And I'll show you how.
2244.66s: So what I'm doing is I'm adding up the total P and L, right?
2249.82s: So it's 14, 478 using the realized side of the equation.
2256.62s: Then if I add these in, it's negative 49, 48.
2262.66s: So now we take that 49, 48.
2267.02s: We know that we essentially have 53, 30 from here.
2274.34s: So then what I can do is I can figure out the difference between these two numbers,
2279.42s: figure out what essentially need the option to trade at.
2283.02s: So all I need to do is take this minus this and it gives me $382.
2290.18s: And we already know what the starting premium was and we know how many contracts the contracts
2296.62s: is already normalized because we're using the total P and L.
2298.98s: So I don't have to adjust by the contracts.
2302.02s: So really all I need to do now is take this down by the total trade size.
2311.02s: So I pretty much need this to be trading for like 38 cents in order for me to make the total
2317.46s: amount of money that I need to pull out on these.
2321.50s: So then to eyeball that, if I take these down for 0.38, that'll give me the 49.50 that
2329.62s: I need here, which again, that's essentially how all of that will bubble out to being
2336.78s: this a highly successful position.
2338.74s: Now that all being said, that doesn't necessarily mean that I won't adjust these.
2346.74s: There's a good chance I will, but right now it's just way too early to even think about
2350.18s: that.
2351.18s: However, I do have to be kind of quick and not allow these to get buried if I can.
2357.18s: So right now, that's why I'm a little itchy because I'm exposed and I'm exposed because
2363.38s: these were a little too far out in time.
2365.14s: Notice if I wanted to roll these, this is that idea that I talk about with respect to
2368.66s: expiration liquidity.
2370.58s: I'm in these 53 DTE.
2372.98s: If I go out the next one, I'm literally doubling and change how much time is in the trade.
2379.38s: So I run out of rolling choices if something happens during again, this near term window.
2389.30s: So there's kind of a sit and wait and see what happens.
2393.18s: I can roll them out to 19 set, but I wouldn't want to.
2397.14s: If I have to, it's something I consider, but absolutely not something that I want to
2402.46s: do.
2403.46s: Now let's talk about one other thing really quick.
2406.46s: I have a couple other trades will go through these a little more in detail tomorrow, but
2412.38s: there's a couple broad market themes that I'm continuing to see play out that I do think
2417.90s: are tradable.
2419.82s: So one of those themes is reiterating from what we talked about yesterday, the relationship
2426.06s: between comm services and tech is still not normalized.
2429.30s: If you take a look, they're almost inversing in terms of how they're performing on the
2432.42s: day relative to one another.
2433.78s: I traded that today.
2435.58s: It actually worked pretty well.
2437.14s: It's just trading the expansion between the pair's relationship.
2442.86s: Energy is on this really slow steady grind.
2447.18s: So there's a couple names in energy that have been performing really leading the total
2452.14s: pack here.
2453.54s: And I will show you those.
2456.38s: So if we get out of the COT report and let's take a look at this one, let's go to energy.
2471.30s: So if we take a look at the five day performance in energy, you can see really who the main
2477.54s: leaders are in the broader index.
2480.06s: And again, EQT, we have talked about EQT.
2485.34s: It's got to be a dozen times now.
2487.74s: So the reason why I'm mentioning that is because the market, it becomes not like super predictable,
2498.62s: but it's like this is a novel to me.
2500.98s: The fact that EQT is up is not surprising at all.
2504.58s: And if you'll recall, the trade that I talked about running in EQT was short puts.
2509.94s: And it's simply because through earnings, it tends to have an inside move, but it's
2516.34s: been bullish overall directionally.
2518.66s: EQT has been very slow grinding to the upside.
2522.82s: Now it's at a delicate spot here with it being at 51.
2528.90s: It needs to break above this in order to see a resumption of this uptrend before I would
2534.74s: expect it to roll back over.
2536.70s: So the short puts that I have out that I essentially traded through earnings, I'm just holding
2540.42s: those.
2541.42s: And I had two different tranches.
2543.10s: The specific earnings plays didn't play anything for that.
2547.18s: And it's because EQT can move a bit much.
2551.70s: I don't remember what our set analysis was on it.
2557.26s: I might have actually might have traded EQT for earnings.
2560.30s: I don't remember.
2561.30s: I'd have to look at the log, but there was definitely a longer term trade component to
2566.22s: it.
2567.22s: And it's because it's providing a slight keyhole stabilizing force for the broader portfolio,
2577.50s: which is really heavy in these other names.
2579.78s: And there's another trade that I'm doing that with two of them actually give you one of
2585.86s: them for you here.
2592.62s: So new one.
2594.10s: This is another one.
2595.54s: Now new month is been a little bit of a favor simply because of the risk off environment
2602.90s: that we keep rotating in and out of.
2605.38s: Now it's starting to slow down.
2606.94s: So this might actually be ready to come down.
2610.06s: I had some long calls and short puts in these.
2614.62s: So sort of a synthetic long scenario, but I treat them slightly differently.
2619.74s: The long calls are like a small loss at this point.
2624.06s: The short puts are still fine.
2626.06s: So these might have to come down if it continues this broader trend, but this is again adding
2634.22s: this to the portfolio because it's the kind of name that's doing something on its own,
2639.22s: meaning it's providing some bullish price movement, but also because of the way that
2644.50s: it fits into the portfolio.
2646.18s: So the portfolio itself is still long beta-weighted delta's broadly.
2651.50s: So that's broadly what I got for you guys.
2654.58s: Now is a great time.
2655.58s: If there's anything you want to take a look at together, if you have any questions or
2658.02s: anything like that that you want to discuss, let me know.
2659.98s: I'm going to pop the door for Thor real quick and then I'll hit whatever you want.
2676.18s: He's thinking it's his dinner time, but Mel's not here and I'm not going to feed him
2685.62s: just yet.
2686.62s: So he'll be back in a jiffy.
2689.22s: I presume.
2690.82s: Lauren says Pelosi got troll today.
2693.50s: I didn't see that.
2694.50s: What happened?
2695.50s: What happened to Pelosi?
2696.90s: Let's see.
2704.38s: I saw that Trump said that he would be cool with banning trading for them.
2712.46s: Let's see.
2715.70s: Oh my God.
2716.70s: I see the troll now.
2720.78s: The Pelosi act.
2723.34s: That's so.
2725.34s: Oh, that's classic.
2730.82s: That's absolutely classic.
2734.58s: Yeah, this is good.
2736.50s: This needs to happen.
2738.58s: The fact that there's individual Senate, Congress, whatever, like any of those entities
2745.74s: should not be allowed to trade individual names.
2748.90s: They're way too close to way too much information that is absolutely not accessible otherwise.
2755.78s: And I also think it's tricky, right?
2764.50s: We've talked about this before.
2766.38s: The people that don't have money, they look at this with disgust, contempt, and then they
2771.66s: get upset at them.
2772.94s: And I understand that perspective because there's a point where I had no money.
2777.34s: Now with money, my perspective has changed.
2780.62s: I still think they shouldn't be allowed to trade individual names because it sets
2785.38s: a terrible precedent and it sets an absolutely abysmal baseline for how the general population
2793.26s: views them.
2794.26s: However, there is a reality.
2797.26s: You have to look at things also from their lens.
2800.98s: If one of the reasons why I'm so disinterested in getting involved in just public service is
2809.30s: because how much it skylines you, how gritty it is, and how awful the compensation is.
2818.38s: You make no money.
2821.66s: So the fact that we look at people like this and we just look at them and we're upset.
2828.46s: We're like, oh, they shouldn't be able to do this.
2830.42s: This is bullshit.
2831.42s: They shouldn't have this much money.
2833.02s: But then there's the other side of it as, well, I don't want fucking stupid people working
2837.66s: in these jobs either.
2838.98s: And regardless of whether you like Pelosi, don't like Pelosi or these other people, like
2844.82s: they're still intelligent.
2847.34s: So in order to get intelligent people into these kinds of jobs, you also have to think,
2855.22s: well, what's in it for them, which is really, really difficult.
2859.90s: Now again, this is why I don't think a ban on investing at all should be allowed because
2865.98s: otherwise it just defeats.
2868.14s: I think a lot of the people that otherwise might be interested in these kinds of jobs.
2872.18s: But I think being able to trade individual names is fucking crazy.
2875.74s: And it's because they're way too close to stuff that they would hear that might be public,
2879.98s: but they're still going to hear it well before.
2883.22s: Well, well before other people will.
2885.94s: So yeah, now one other thing that is worth noting whenever we talk about Pelosi is Pelosi
2894.94s: is not the one that's actually trading.
2897.10s: Her husband is a professional investor and he's done that his whole life.
2902.46s: So there is also that dynamic here where although we really like to make the joke from the
2907.14s: angle of, oh, it's Pelosi trading, it's really not it's her husband who's already a professional
2911.70s: investor.
2912.90s: So there's also that one's.
2915.94s: But yeah, this I think is hilarious.
2925.94s: Let's see.
2928.86s: We introduced Pelosi act to ban lawmakers and spouses from trading individual names.
2937.22s: Named after Nancy Pelosi, the bills gain support from both parties, including Trump,
2941.94s: referees, amid ongoing scrutiny.
2945.98s: Of congressional stock trading.
2948.10s: Yeah.
2949.78s: I mean, honestly, I don't like the name.
2954.46s: Oh my God.
2957.46s: I did not realize this.
2961.38s: Look at this preventing elected leaders from owning securities and investments.
2967.22s: They literally, I didn't know that they made it a fucking acronym.
2970.70s: That is the, that is a epic level troll.
2973.94s: That's so funny.
2976.10s: Oh, man, I was going to say I actually don't love the name Pelosi because I think it's
2980.50s: kind of ridiculous to just single her out.
2984.02s: I think there's a lot of other people that are doing this.
2987.34s: She just started getting a lot of press because of her, her level within government.
2991.90s: So I don't like it making it out where it's like a Pelosi problem like this is much
2996.22s: broader than just Pelosi.
2998.02s: But the troll in that acronym is S tier.
3002.22s: So I don't even know how you could be upset at that.
3004.90s: It's so funny.
3008.74s: Would prohibit lawmakers and spouses from holding, buying or selling individual stocks
3013.86s: while on office?
3016.38s: Would allow investments in mutual funds and ETFs or bonds?
3021.94s: Yeah.
3022.54s: I think that's okay.
3026.86s: They would have up to 180 days to divest that kind of sucks to be honest.
3033.22s: I don't hate it, but there is just the timing component of when they happen to get in.
3039.98s: So I don't love that.
3041.86s: But I think, you know, that's fine.
3046.54s: Look at the violation though.
3051.14s: The violation, well, maybe they're thinking that is not so much the
3056.58s: violation enforcement via the fines.
3059.90s: Maybe they're looking at more so as like violation enforcement via like the press and then the
3069.98s: difficulty getting reelected maybe.
3073.82s: I'm wondering if that's the broader angle that they're taking here because I mean,
3080.58s: 10% of each unlawful transaction and forfeit profits to the treasury.
3090.34s: I guess if they have to forfeit all profits, but I don't know, it just doesn't seem like that punitive.
3098.50s: I guess maybe if they have to forfeit all profits, I kind of miss right over that one.
3107.14s: I like that a little better.
3110.98s: Still don't love it, but
3115.50s: to me, it should be the kind of thing where like if you choose to do this, you literally should be kicked out.
3121.06s: Like you shouldn't be allowed to continue
3126.06s: serving like you literally should have to go away.
3129.22s: And the reason why I think that is it just it's again, it sets such a miserable precedent and the optics on it are
3138.34s: abysmal. They're just they're really as bad as the optics could get.
3143.14s: So because of that, I think it is completely worth just essentially saying like,
3149.22s: not man, you guys not happening.
3152.70s: I would advocate for that.
3157.62s: Moody Blu says thoughts on AMD earnings next week.
3162.30s: Let's see, it's a little early for me really to have an opinion on AMD.
3167.74s: Earnings, but we can take a look.
3172.62s: The six after the market.
3177.98s: I still not have the earning. I still have the earnings tab.
3180.86s: I'm going to move you guys over to the screen really quick.
3183.94s: And I'm actually going to
3186.38s: close this thing down open it back up.
3191.38s: I want to see if I can get the earnings tab back.
3194.98s: The fucking earnings tab is gone.
3198.46s: Guys, this is this is a travesty.
3204.34s: I don't know what I did to deserve this, but I don't feel like I did it.
3214.46s: All right, let's see.
3223.34s: Okay, it's back. That is so bizarre.
3228.34s: All right, let's take a look at this thing.
3231.26s: business
3234.64s: makes
3236.00s: leader
3239.86s: so
3244.10s: the implementation
3249.98s: Move you guys back over here. I'm just making sure all my gets cleared out.
3256.58s: Yeah, we good. Alright, cool.
3262.46s: AMD.
3275.58s: I mean, short puts looks like a fucking bold move, dog.
3280.10s: Cap down, gap down, up then down like a day later, gap down, gap down, up day,
3290.62s: gap up, but then close down heavy, gap down.
3300.22s: AMD.
3301.22s: I mean, for me, I don't think I would trade this to the upside.
3313.46s: Might trade it from a vol lens, but even that my guess is there's going to be better,
3319.02s: better choices than this for me. So even from a vol lens, probably not realistically.
3325.50s: Interesting though.
3328.06s: Super interesting.
3329.74s: But yeah, it's too early to tell the reason why I say that is we have to wait until we
3335.98s: actually get closer to earnings itself. And then we'll see what the market is pricing it
3342.14s: at. It's just way too early to tell if it's even if it's even viable or not.
3349.70s: Mateo says was my comment deleted about bid spoofing Burke B at 940.
3355.82s: On the 560 contracts, trying to understand how these guys push retailers into their exit
3361.62s: liquidity and why they do it. Those are different things.
3366.22s: Bids spoofing and then essentially trying to manufacture exit liquidity.
3372.82s: Like there are those are actually kind of really big different concepts.
3378.42s: What leads you to believe that it was bit that it was just not even bid spoofing.
3384.02s: It doesn't matter which side, but what leads you to believe that it was spoofing that was going on.
3399.02s: Check the option Shane.
3405.02s: That post. I don't see a post. Oh, do you mean like in the discord?
3410.50s: I mean, looking the discord.
3414.50s: You said it was at 940.
3418.50s: No, I don't see it unless you posted it in a different room.
3425.50s: Yeah, I don't see anything in here about Burke.
3434.50s: I don't know why it would have been deleted though.
3436.50s: The bot might not have done it.
3439.50s: But yeah, anyways, I would decouple especially from like the retail trader lens because spoofing is really a game between other firms, other high frequency trading firms typically not relegated to them, but it's very frequently between other HFTs and market making firms.
3469.50s: So I think the connection of pushing retailers into the exit liquidity is not necessarily applicable.
3480.50s: Why they do it in general. I think you're answering your own question in terms of getting some sort of liquidity.
3491.50s: Check this option Shane 5 to Burke be 560 calls very weird at 940.
3501.50s: What are we going to check though?
3509.50s: There's nothing I'll be able to see here that will be able to confirm or deny whether or not there is spoofing.
3521.50s: Maybe I can check it in here.
3534.50s: Burke be 560 call.
3539.50s: 5 to.
3545.50s: Let's see.
3547.50s: I haven't really used this much.
3553.50s: Yeah, I mean, there's no, there's nothing here that lets me actually see that.
3564.50s: Now, Mateo, what otherwise are you talking about me checking? I'm trying to think like the way that you're thinking that you detected spoofing.
3577.50s: Because from a retail trade or a lens, there's only a couple things that we could potentially do.
3583.50s: But I'm wondering how you're thinking about it.
3587.50s: I'm thinking.
3603.50s: Nada.
3604.50s: Okay, well anyways, I'll continue on the we can talk about it in two different lenses.
3610.50s: is the first lens is the concept of spoofing. But then the second being some sort of behavior
3619.70s: in Birkbee, I think the behavior in Birkbee doesn't...
3628.58s: Let's look at Birkbee broadly first before I say the...
3641.14s: Okay. I mean, net premiums really weren't that much. Calls ran fairly negative,
3652.42s: but not like tremendously put side was pretty mellow.
3658.82s: The three days that you're talking about seem to have had some activity.
3663.30s: The same thing with the five forties. I wonder if one of those was sold for a spread.
3671.06s: No, because it's only 13k against 1800. So people wanted these for sure.
3682.66s: Seems like he is pushing his followers into his own exil liquidity.
3688.34s: You might have a close group who load up buys before they share the play.
3693.30s: You tell him about this in Birkshire?
3696.90s: Who we talking about? When you say pushing his followers, who's his?
3709.70s: I'm not sure. Because that is completely different. That starts to sound more like
3716.42s: pump and dump. But I mean, to do any sort of pump and dump and something like Birkshire is fucking...
3724.02s: crazy.
3726.58s: Because the kind of scale that you would need. And I would also then completely decouple that
3730.98s: from spoofing. It seems like you might be confusing what that is compared to the other thing
3734.82s: you're talking about here. Spoofing is layering orders in an order book to provide false
3744.42s: appearance and manipulate the appearance of supply and demand functionality in the markets,
3749.94s: which is why like using anything like this, we can't see it. Because the way that you would monitor
3754.74s: spoofing is two different ways. If you go to enter an order and then it moves before you get a
3761.46s: fill and then you enter an order and then it moves. Those are orders that are completely designed
3766.18s: to be pulled before they're filled, which is annoying. But you'll run into that even as an
3770.66s: options trader, retail options trader. It's not always spoofing. But sometimes there's just a
3775.94s: stale order that's sitting there that when it goes to get hit, it'll move.
3780.90s: Mateo says it's a Twitter handle that's doing it. Let's go see...
3791.14s: I've never heard of this person. It's 77,000 followers. There's no way that they're doing this.
3798.18s: Yeah, I think you're confusing a bunch of things. So the first thing is that person is way too small
3809.30s: to even attempt a pump and dump on something like
3814.82s: Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway is huge. In order to run a successful pump and dump,
3819.94s: you really have to be able to control way, way, way more of the volume. Because that's essentially
3827.06s: how you create your own wave to get out. When you're trading really, really big names like that,
3833.06s: it's next to impossible because there's so many other entities trading at such larger sizes than
3839.70s: any one individual that... I mean, take a look at this, right? Call premium and put premium. Today,
3846.18s: it traded $9.6 million of put premium, $21.5 million of call premium that's literally just today.
3854.74s: So even if you have a massive bankroll of hundreds of millions of dollars, in order to be able to
3860.10s: reliably do this and control the float anyway like that, I mean, it would have to be at like
3864.02s: gargantuan scale. So that is like the mechanics of something like a pump and dump.
3874.02s: There was no volume on the 560s. Seems like they ran the price up out of the money contracts with
3879.14s: their closed group. Who gives a shit? So let's take a look at those 560s. I don't know what they
3885.06s: did with the 560s. I don't know anything about this group. So just to be super, super clear.
3889.70s: But if we take a look at... Let's take a look at the 560s only. And we said it was for the second.
3897.06s: I mean, they literally don't even register here. These are $4,000.
3913.62s: I mean, there's nothing happening here. This is such a small contract in such a small
3921.22s: amount of volume that their exit liquidity is not going to be provided. You're confusing the way
3930.50s: that options are traded. I think thinking too much about how a small float stock might be traded.
3939.06s: But the counter party for essentially all of their trades is going to be a market maker. It's not
3945.14s: going to be directly paired, you know, retail trader, the group whoever they are, the group is
3951.46s: needing to exit their calls. So then they need somebody to buy them from them as they sell them.
3958.90s: That's clearly not what's going on here. The other cases they're obviously buying. So while
3964.98s: they're going through that buying activity, you need somebody to sell them to you. The probability
3969.86s: of retail traders sitting there resting orders to sell these calls to this other group is probably
3976.34s: very little. So the broader thing is I think you're confusing a few different things. I think you're
3982.26s: confusing spoofing. I think you're confusing pump and dumps how they work. I think you're detecting
3988.82s: a broader thing that seems off to you, which is completely fair. Again, I don't know anything about
3993.94s: them. I just think you're confusing the mechanisms by which it would be executed in. Now,
4000.18s: for pump and dumps, though, like I said, you'll typically see them done in much smaller names.
4005.30s: And it's simply because of the realities of trying to run that kind of scheme. But for the options
4011.70s: market, the other side of these trades is a market maker. And the market maker is happy to be on
4016.18s: the other side of the trade for these guys. Because if they're buying these 560 calls using 4 grand,
4022.74s: 1, it's a tiny position. And 2, let's take a look at the 560s and Berkeley.
4036.82s: Yeah, they're trading for 23 cents. So the average fill, let's see.
4057.22s: Where's price? I think it's this one that they use. But it asks volume. Oh, I don't really care.
4080.90s: So it looks like what they grabbed him for 22 cents.
4089.54s: Trading for the same right now. Right? Like it's that there's, I don't see it. I don't see
4096.58s: anything there that leads me to believe that these are being used to try to manipulate some sort of
4101.38s: price movement. If it is, it's not working well at all. Because the total, again, the size of this
4107.54s: was a 170 lot. Look at the minute chart. Okay. You mean minute on the option or on the stock itself?
4123.38s: Erick B. You will see it so clear on the option contract at 940.
4142.98s: There's nothing to see. Again, I think that you're still confusing. Like just because there's a
4148.58s: spike in volume doesn't mean anything. This happens all the time in all different kinds of names.
4156.98s: So I think like I can see what you're talking about that there's a massive spike in volume here.
4164.02s: But this happens in all kinds of names. A great example of that is if I go into one of my scans here.
4172.74s: This one. And let's just take a look at.
4180.18s: Course because cores literally had an option with 200,000 expansion in volume over OI.
4190.66s: So let's take a look at cores.
4196.82s: And which contract was it? The seven puts 19 D's seven puts 19 D's this year.
4210.66s: Right. So there's no activity essentially all day. And then at one point in time,
4218.26s: there now is a 10,000 lot that clears for $1.38 million.
4224.98s: The overall volume on the day was 10,000 to. So what I'm showing you is you're again, you might be
4232.50s: suspecting some sort of nefarious behavior and that I can't comment on I don't know.
4237.30s: But from what you're seeing here, it literally doesn't show you anything related to that.
4242.66s: Because this is how options trade.
4246.90s: So there's nothing to see so clear at 940 AM Eastern time because the only thing that you see at 940 AM
4253.54s: is a spike in the chart. So you send pictures on Discord. Let's see.
4261.78s: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying is that there's really nothing to see there. There's just
4267.30s: an expansion in volume. Again, it's literally the same exact thing that I'm showing you here.
4278.26s: It's this is even a much larger magnitude version of what you just showed me.
4284.18s: And again, I can show you hundreds of these because again, this is how options trade.
4289.46s: Anytime you look for volume over OI, that is where the volume on that day for some reason
4296.66s: explodes in a specific contract. It doesn't have to explode. It could be a little bit.
4300.90s: But typically the scenarios we're talking about is more severe than that.
4304.82s: And it's for a trade being built for one reason or another. Again, like this is a prime time
4309.94s: example where this trade here shows you cores ended up having 10,000 contract volume on this
4317.62s: one specific time frame, 1241 to 1242. So it's really to me, I think it's a little more telling
4329.70s: when there's got to be other behaviors. The only thing you're detecting is a spike in volume.
4336.34s: That's all that means. So what the spike in volume means where it comes from all that kind of
4342.34s: stuff, it's a completely different thing. But if you take a look at the candle volume,
4347.54s: on this one, it's literally 2400 contracts. It's tiny actually compared to what you see here.
4354.02s: This is 2400 contracts spike. Again, this is 10,000 spike. So all you're seeing is a spike in volume.
4364.58s: You can't really pull more from it from that without more information. And just to remind everybody,
4370.98s: the concept of spoofing is very different as well. Spoofing is done at the institutional level.
4376.58s: And it's like mixed with like order stuffing and things like this to
4382.02s: to manipulate the appearance of supply and demand functions in the market. So
4387.70s: Mattel, you're probably just picking up on like sus behavior general based on the person
4393.94s: that you're talking about. And it could be valid invalid, but you just can't prove anything from
4399.14s: that thing there specifically. There's really not much to see.
4402.90s: That being said, you should always follow your gut, right? Like I don't, again, I don't really
4409.94s: follow anybody like that. So I don't know anything about them. But that's generally what I'm
4416.18s: seeing there is just a whole bunch of not much. All right, gang. That
4427.62s: Mattel says seems like a pump and dump. Yeah, I don't see that. I don't think you could call it
4432.82s: even a pump and dump because again, the position that was built is still held right now.
4439.46s: It's you're not going to be able to run a pump and dump in that because it's an option.
4444.74s: And again, the counter party to his trade is going to be a market maker. Yeah,
4449.06s: like that's such an important concept to understand. And the other thing is the value of those
4454.90s: contracts is not going to be determined by their buying and selling behavior. One, because
4459.78s: it's tiny, their buying and selling behavior is secondary largely to the movement of the underlying.
4467.86s: So the concept again of a pump and dump is to be able to control the underlying because that's
4475.06s: how then you buy shares cheaper. And your buying volume is great enough that it starts showing the
4481.78s: appearance of broader interest in this underlying, whatever that is. And then you start selling
4487.06s: into the follow on entry volume. This is for a small float stock. In a big name like Birkshar
4494.98s: Halfaway, they're buying literally doesn't matter because the underlying is still going to be the
4500.90s: dominant force. Now, sometimes the tail can wag the dog, meaning if there's enough options activity,
4509.30s: like I was talking about earlier in the stream, it can necessitate certain dealer behavior in
4513.94s: terms of hedging activities. But even that, it requires such an insane scale, especially in
4520.50s: something like Birkshar Halfaway. Again, like the total premium that we looked at in this options
4525.22s: chain, in this specific one that we're talking about in Birkbee, the total premium is $413,000.
4532.18s: The total premium that traded today in Birkshar Halfaway, the total premium is over $30 million.
4539.30s: This is nothing. And that $30 million itself still won't move the underlying itself, which if we
4546.82s: take a look at what the volume weighted average was here, it's 4.2 million shares. So 4238653
4556.90s: times the current price of 53094. So the total amount of money that traded today in Birkshar
4567.86s: Halfaway is $2.25 billion. So the entire options activity today is completely inconsequential.
4581.46s: Mateo says I saw the contract spike from 10 to 41 without the underlying going up.
4588.90s: That's different. What you saw was the contract moving largely due to
4597.86s: supply and demand changes, but then also liquidity changes. So the value of that contract,
4604.82s: the only reason why it would move between 10 and 41 would be as if there's really
4613.54s: false orders resting there that aren't trading, right? So you can see that it didn't actually trade
4619.46s: at 10 cents. It was rested at 10 cents, but that's not where people were actually trading at.
4626.02s: Then you can see when that volume spikes here, the volume spikes, I wish there was a way to make
4632.26s: this one chart a little bigger. I feel like there's got to be a way to do that.
4640.58s: That's okay. So you can see the volume, right? The average fill is this yellow line.
4648.10s: The average fill that happened today was here in the mid-20s. The cheapest fill that it got on the
4656.74s: day was it looks like a one lot. I can't even hover on it. 12 cents on an eight lot. So the reason why
4667.70s: you see that volume or the average, the price going up is because that's the market maker
4676.74s: looking at the order flow that's coming in and they're charging them a premium. Because what's
4682.66s: happening is the market maker doesn't want to be stuck on one side of the order flow. So they
4688.10s: continue to adjust their books. They move the bid in the ask and they change what kind of depth
4695.46s: they order sizing. So they make it more expensive to continue buying. That's not the price going up.
4702.10s: That's not the value of the contracts going up. Again, you can see what the overall value of
4707.22s: the contracts ultimately terminated around, which is where it essentially started the day at.
4712.10s: The 20 handle, 20 cents, 23 cents, something like that. So this is the market makers just causing
4720.50s: increasing how much money they're forcing the follow-on trades to be executed at. But all of these,
4728.10s: again, there's no big effect because in terms of the impact of the underlying, but then also the
4738.02s: impact to the individual traders because the counter-party to these is going to be a market maker.
4745.54s: So, he says they got exposed. Look at this, Corteure.
4750.26s: Let's see. So this is a small account that misunderstands options. That's not them getting caught.
4772.98s: Yeah, it's a small account that misunderstands options. That's all.
4777.38s: So, again, not saying that there's no nefarious behavior going on. I don't know them.
4783.94s: But all I'm saying is you really can't detect it from this. And from inside of this, let's say for example,
4793.62s: other retail traders started buying the position for whatever reason. They're not providing the exit
4801.94s: liquidity for them. The market makers would be providing the exit liquidity for them. So,
4807.70s: yeah, is what it is. But anyways, about time for me to wrap up. Fun conversation, though,
4817.14s: about like analyzing an order and then actually talking about order flows, spoofing. I think
4821.46s: those are good concepts to be aware of. So, even though they didn't directly apply here,
4825.30s: still happy to chat about them. As always, if you need anything, let me know. Be an outlier. See you on the
