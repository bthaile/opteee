2.34s: what's up everybody Eric here welcome
4.14s: back to all the outliers we got David
5.76s: Hunter back for another edition of the
7.86s: outlier podcast and we're actually just
10.38s: talking for like 15 minutes about the
11.82s: markets and uh the economy there's no
13.92s: shortage of interesting things going on
15.42s: but first welcome back David great to
17.58s: have you yeah hi Eric thanks for having
19.68s: me back yeah of course so I mean I
22.26s: figured we could just pick up literally
23.46s: what we were just talking about kind of
24.84s: the the recent Market Behavior today you
26.82s: were talking about the sell-off that we
28.62s: saw today and kind of how that
30.56s: juxtaposes against the the term lows
33.24s: over the last week or so
35.70s: um just wondering what are you making of
38.40s: the continuation of the pullback do you
40.32s: think that there's a lot of velocity
41.82s: behind this are we slowing down
43.80s: yeah I'm guessing I mean yesterday
45.42s: looked pretty good and I made a call
47.52s: last Friday that was possible looked
49.86s: pretty good possibility that we had made
52.32s: the lows Friday morning
54.60s: um and the follow through this week kind
56.82s: of uh said that was that was right on uh
60.60s: the weakness today and particularly how
63.12s: it ended the day
65.10s: um it almost looks like you might have a
67.50s: very short-term Head and Shoulder top
69.14s: and could go down to 4 200 so we'll find
72.90s: that out I think probably tomorrow
74.28s: Monday uh whether we whether we sell off
77.40s: or whether we turn around and head back
79.14s: up but that's all it is really a
81.54s: question whether you know you got to go
83.46s: a little lower in this pullback or
84.90s: whether the pullback uh lows were seen
87.24s: last Friday uh beyond that I think once
90.24s: this pullback runs its course if it
92.52s: hasn't already
94.44s: um I think we're off to the new highs
97.98s: and from there I think we keep on going
100.80s: so you know I still have that melt up
103.02s: forecast for this fall I still think
106.68s: you're looking at six to seven thousand
108.84s: on the S P 20 000 on NASDAQ
114.18s: um you know forty eight thousand on the
115.86s: Dow so you know my upside has not
118.14s: changed uh it's really just short term
120.60s: you know are we done with the pullback
122.82s: or are we going to see more and you know
125.52s: what what's interesting in this pullback
127.56s: of up till now has been a five percent
129.66s: pullback in the s p
131.88s: really turn sentiment around you have a
135.60s: lot of people and I I kind of suspected
138.96s: that as we saw the rally yeah a lot of
141.42s: people jump on the bullish bandwagon
143.24s: once we got up above 4 300 and had a 4
146.64s: 600
148.68s: um you know a lot of those people that
149.88s: fought the rally all the way up from
151.38s: last October started talking more
153.84s: bullish but my sense was they didn't
157.08s: have any conviction behind that
158.76s: bullishness and that's been borne out in
161.64s: this pullback a lot of them gave up the
164.16s: the bullish view as soon as you had the
166.62s: tape turn South so
169.26s: um I think as we saw all you know last
172.62s: fall into uh right up until now
177.36s: um I think an awful lot of people viewed
180.00s: any rally as a bear Market rally and now
182.88s: they feel that bear Market rallies were
184.62s: on its course and then we're heading
186.72s: back towards whether we'll go back to
188.70s: the lows of October whether we'll go
191.04s: part way back there I think I think
193.02s: there's still a lot of skepticism about
196.08s: this market and that's healthy I mean
198.48s: that's that's a wall of worry that I
200.34s: talk about you need the fuel comes from
203.10s: people remaining skeptical uh people
206.28s: fighting this thing
208.14s: you don't want to see this you know
210.42s: bullish conviction so we certainly
212.40s: aren't seeing bullish conviction the
214.38s: pullback's kind of that pause it
216.54s: refreshes and I think it's just really a
219.18s: question of whether we go back to 4200
221.82s: or whether we saw the lows last Friday
224.82s: yeah it's interesting and so thinking
227.76s: about the last time we spoke you know
229.86s: about your kind of Market hypothesis
232.08s: here thinking still about that large
236.34s: Market run up in the fall last time we
239.46s: spoke I think we talked a bit about just
242.04s: the fed and the fed's role specifically
244.56s: in terms of their approach towards
245.82s: interest rates right like if there was
247.56s: some sort of hint of a contraction in
250.26s: their target rate that that probably
251.76s: would fuel a big run what's like the
254.16s: primary Catalyst that you see for the
256.74s: primary run-up that you're talking about
258.06s: here I was looking at the FED
259.08s: probabilities for the next fomc meeting
262.50s: which is for the 20th of September and
265.86s: right now it's showing like uh 80
268.62s: percent 80 and a half percent
270.60s: probability of no change in the Federal
273.72s: target rate Federal fund rate and then
276.18s: 19 and a half percent probability of a
279.18s: hike I'm curious like what are the
282.06s: primary catalysts that you see because
283.44s: it looks like the FED at least least
285.30s: best case scenario right now would be
286.74s: looking at another pause come September
288.42s: so what other catalysts are you looking
289.92s: at
290.82s: yeah that's interesting so first with
292.98s: the fed and of course Paul's speaking
294.48s: tomorrow so we're gonna probably get a
296.52s: even better handle on what the fed's
298.74s: going to do in September my guess is
300.78s: he's steady as he she goes tomorrow
302.52s: he'll he'll talk kind of a balance
305.16s: policy say we we feel like we're making
307.50s: good progress on inflation we're not
309.66s: there yet but we're making progress and
312.18s: we also are worrying about you know we
314.34s: have to balance that risk off against uh
317.16s: that inflation risk off against the risk
319.38s: that we've gone you know that we go too
321.24s: far and tip this thing into into
323.52s: recession so with you know you're
326.34s: getting some certainly some indications
328.44s: this week that retail is is struggling
330.90s: that the consumers starting to you know
333.48s: pull back
334.92s: um and I think the fed's very aware of
336.54s: that you get all kinds of conversation
338.70s: out there about the fed or about the
341.64s: banking system uh tightening credit
344.22s: conditions and that you're seeing
346.02s: lending slow down uh obviously we have
348.54s: mortgage rates up at seven and a half
350.10s: percent and that's going to slow housing
352.50s: no matter what so so they are aware that
355.92s: they have to be uh you know that they
358.02s: have to be
359.16s: careful not to go too far and tip things
361.80s: into recession or or you know get things
365.04s: going on the downside
366.66s: too fast
368.18s: on the other hand they don't wanna
371.16s: you know declare mission accomplished
373.50s: because inflation is not yet there and
376.08s: interesting in in the last few weeks you
378.60s: were getting the sense
380.10s: the street was starting to gravitate
381.84s: towards maybe inflation is going to pick
383.46s: up again you know because some of the
385.44s: commodity prices have have moved up and
388.56s: there were some signs that you could I'm
391.44s: not in that camp I think we're gonna you
393.48s: know I think inflation's trending down
394.98s: that doesn't mean every month is going
396.60s: to be a downtick but I think I think you
399.96s: can see inflation is going to continue
401.22s: to move down and ultimately into
403.38s: deflation in the bust next year but
407.10s: um one thing that I think the FED may
409.32s: find they they don't realize it yet but
411.84s: I think it's going to help help their
414.12s: policy or help them
416.94s: um kind of pause is that I think oil is
419.70s: rolling over if oil prices are rolling
422.16s: over if gasoline prices are rolling over
424.20s: and both I looked at both and they look
426.48s: like they are I think you could see uh
430.04s: wtti crude head back towards the low 60s
433.20s: which has been my call all along
436.86s: um
437.58s: and so I think we and man I think
441.48s: gasoline is going to head head south so
443.88s: if if we get both of those moving down
446.82s: and you can see in the chart that
448.80s: they're rolling over the crews rolling
450.96s: over there if it heads back down into
453.36s: the 60s
454.74s: that's very much helpful to the whole
457.62s: inflation expectation story so
461.40s: um I'm I'm thinking that's that's likely
464.46s: and will offset you know whatever people
467.64s: are worrying about in terms of other
470.04s: commodity prices that might rally a bit
472.68s: here
474.18s: um so I'm you know I'm thinking the FED
476.58s: is probably either done or we'll do
479.16s: another quarter in September and say
480.96s: okay let's call it a day for a while
483.90s: um doesn't mean they can't come back
485.64s: that's still something I say is that if
487.92s: we get the market rallying up to six
489.90s: seven thousand uh Paul's gonna probably
493.38s: come back in and say hey we got to
495.18s: tighten conditions this is run away you
497.52s: know excessive risk taking Etc
501.24s: um
501.84s: so but but for the time being if you get
504.54s: let's say we we get a pause here they
507.48s: don't hike in September
510.12s: um things look good for October November
513.06s: in terms of them being done that's a
516.12s: huge wind at the back of the market
517.68s: because that's to me that is the biggest
520.32s: story out there is if I'm gonna say it's
523.50s: permanent but if the street starts
525.42s: thinking it's permanent that the
526.86s: tightening cycle is over
529.32s: that's that's all you need to get a big
532.02s: rally going
533.28s: and on top of that sorry on top of that
536.70s: I expect a weak dollar
539.58s: um you know it's been strong this week
540.90s: but I think it's Gonna Roll Over
543.24s: um and and I think interest rates are
545.10s: peaking here so they will be rolling
546.84s: over interest rates meaning Bond rates
549.48s: um so if you get those three things fed
551.46s: fed tightening over
553.98s: um or at least six you know the the
556.44s: sediment that it's over uh and you get
559.08s: dollar down sharply and rates down I
562.62s: think those are the kind of things that
564.18s: can Propel a big rally and then you know
566.94s: and then fomo kicks in and you just keep
568.92s: going what do you make of this so these
573.48s: were the probabilities I was talking to
575.28s: you about for the September meeting and
577.02s: when you were talking about
578.70s: um November I peeked over there out of
580.86s: curiosity this surprises me that they're
583.56s: talking about uh 47.5 probability it
587.40s: looks like of a 25 basis point hike is
591.44s: essentially a price yes is priced in
594.18s: November but they're looking at a pause
596.22s: here in September so do you think the
597.54s: fence is trying to see how we react here
600.42s: and then but otherwise they're right now
603.00s: potentially expecting to have like a 50
604.80s: 50 chance of having a hike again in
606.30s: November now keep in mind these are
608.64s: Street expectations the FED may have a
610.92s: totally different view of things uh I
613.38s: think if if you were the survey and
615.96s: they're they're not all on the same page
617.46s: but if you were the survey the bulk of
619.26s: the FED members I think you would hear
622.32s: um
623.04s: oh
624.68s: uh we're going to stay at these levels
627.12s: for a while it's not so much we're going
628.98s: to hike a lot more you know but we're
631.74s: not going to come down so I think you're
634.44s: beginning we hear some noises out of
636.00s: some Harker I think today in an
637.92s: interview it sounded like he was
639.60s: starting to talk about
642.00s: um
642.60s: the possibility of a cut sometime next
646.62s: year you know in the first half of next
648.06s: year
649.26s: um he didn't Define it as such but it
651.24s: was he was giving you reasons why if if
653.40s: you got you know if you've got inflation
655.80s: down into the twos that you could
657.60s: actually have make the case the cuts are
659.76s: coming so so I yeah actually that was
663.24s: somebody else I don't think it was
664.32s: harder but but I think in the back of
666.78s: the fed's mind is possibility that but I
669.24s: think generally the FED believes we're
672.30s: gonna you know we're going to remain at
673.86s: these levels for another year we're not
676.50s: it's not that we're hiking but we're not
678.18s: going to be cutting either
679.80s: uh the street on the other hand probably
682.38s: is looking for a cut next year but maybe
684.96s: a series of cuts
686.82s: um because I think they're more
689.40s: um they're more bearish on the economy
691.56s: than maybe the FED is
693.84s: um and so that's there
696.48s: um in terms of November I think that's
698.82s: probably the street still not willing to
702.06s: think that yeah I think that's a little
703.56s: bit of what I was saying about Street
704.94s: thinking that inflation is going to pick
706.62s: up again
707.64s: that maybe we we are at that focal you
711.00s: know the kind of that Turning Point the
712.62s: inflection point where inflation's gone
714.96s: as low as it's going to go for a while
716.28s: and then we we get a number of months
718.14s: going the other way that's not my view
720.24s: but I think there is a street view out
722.70s: there of that so so I think they're kind
726.24s: of guarded about being able to say the
728.70s: pause in September is long-lasting I
730.92s: think they're they're worried that they
732.72s: might go back the other way so it's it's
734.34s: a little bit like where we were in June
736.20s: you know they they paused in June hiked
739.38s: in July paused in August paused in
742.92s: September hiked in November you know I
745.56s: think they're not willing to
747.54s: think the FED is totally done
750.18s: um I am I mean I'm I don't as I've said
753.12s: before to you I'm not sure it really
755.46s: matters
756.54s: if we're close to done or whether we're
758.58s: done with the hikes
760.62s: um I'm more I'm more driven by Bond
763.38s: rates and I think Bond rates are done
765.24s: going up
766.32s: uh I think we are at an inflection point
768.90s: on interest rates about you know 10 and
771.18s: 30 rates and I expect I still expect the
775.02s: two and a half percent ten year probably
777.18s: by the end of this year
780.24s: foreign
783.08s: one of the things you brought up that I
785.16s: was curious about was just throwing the
786.66s: the 30-year treasury index real password
788.28s: yeah yeah yeah but but one of the things
790.98s: that I keep a pretty close eye on are
793.20s: those kind of the Futures probabilities
795.06s: to your point from the street and then
796.86s: also the FED Dot Plot I've actually I'm
800.04s: a stats guy so like I like looking at
802.50s: data and just seeing you know
804.78s: relationships over time is The Dot Plot
808.26s: something that you follow and find any
811.44s: meaningful efficacy in because I have
814.32s: found two observable Trends with the Dot
817.26s: Plot looking back over essentially the
818.76s: last 50 years but not a lot of like
822.42s: positively correlated
824.58s: predictions coming from them so I'm
826.44s: curious your thoughts
827.64s: yeah but I I don't put a lot of stuck
830.04s: into that plot I think I think the Fed
833.28s: has proven itself through all the years
835.44s: I've watched them through so many cycles
837.68s: the FED is always late
840.66s: to
841.92s: to tighten in late to ease
844.44s: in other words they stay stay too long
846.90s: on both sides
849.00s: um and as a result we get boom busts and
852.36s: so I just don't think you know there
855.90s: it's it's Economist in a in a committee
858.78s: and obviously the Dot Plot is is kind of
861.36s: the summary of of all that it's a it's a
863.88s: consensus forecast
865.62s: from from a group of academic economists
868.68s: basically so it shouldn't surprise
871.56s: anybody that
873.54s: um they're they're not going to be
875.70s: predictive they're going to be followers
877.62s: you know
879.42s: um so
881.04s: um and uh one of my big criticisms of
883.86s: the FED over the last couple years
887.40s: is that they're mostly non-if not all
890.90s: non-market people you know Paul
893.04s: certainly you know he was a private
894.90s: Market guy
896.40s: as well as an attorney
898.92s: um and most of them are academic
900.72s: economists
901.86s: so they they don't have that market
905.22s: um experience and I believe
908.22s: that the market is the leader most of
910.86s: the time now sometimes Market can go off
913.02s: on a run and it turns out to be a false
915.42s: run
916.32s: isn't predictive but more often than not
919.08s: the stock market the bond market are
921.42s: going to lead the Fed they're going to
924.12s: be leading indicators and the FEDS fed's
928.02s: a follower so by definition the fed's
930.96s: going to be kind of late to the to the
933.30s: recognition
934.68s: speaking of late kind of to the to the
937.50s: party for the FED what do you make of
940.20s: the balance sheet and kind of their
943.32s: their unwind it started kind of in what
945.78s: April 23 is when it actually started
947.58s: Contracting a bit but what do you make
950.04s: of that do you think that the velocity
951.42s: is the correct Pace do you think that
953.70s: it'll have the impact that they're
955.32s: intending
956.88s: well let's put this first of all I am I
960.24s: am more or less a monetrist
962.88s: um you know I put myself in that
964.26s: category I think money is all important
966.92s: uh more so than interest rates
970.32s: um and so
972.78s: um you know the fact that they've pulled
974.22s: almost a trillion dollars out of the off
976.92s: the balance sheet you know pulled out of
978.96s: the system
980.70s: um would normally turn me bearish I mean
983.76s: I'd normally be saying that's all you
985.56s: know we we don't see a trillion dollars
987.78s: pulled out we've never seen it before
989.58s: that that to that tune so normally I'd
992.40s: be bearish but then you have to put it
994.80s: in context and realize
997.62s: right
999.42s: uh preceding this was
1002.24s: five trillion dollars
1004.66s: so what they've done is taken 20 percent
1007.40s: of that that huge number out
1011.02s: and uh you know again
1013.88s: I think what we're seeing as we're
1016.10s: seeing the economy stay resilient as
1018.92s: we're seeing you know some I think it
1021.56s: surprised most economists and most of
1023.42s: the street that the economy's hung in
1025.88s: there as long as it hasn't surprised me
1028.06s: but I think it really if you look at it
1031.40s: in hindsight what it's telling you is
1034.16s: and some of this high tide I had
1036.32s: actually said some of this prior
1039.32s: um there's so much money that got put in
1042.02s: unprecedented amounts of both money and
1045.26s: fiscal stimulus So Physical monetary
1047.18s: stimulus got put in 2020 and 21
1051.28s: that's still sloshing around out there
1053.78s: and that's what's allowed them to be as
1056.60s: tight as they've been
1058.34s: and not have an impact the way it would
1061.28s: have so it's why I still think there's
1064.28s: time for a melt up it's why I am not
1067.46s: worried about the tightening they've
1069.26s: done in the last year uh you know people
1072.62s: couldn't understand why I remained and
1075.50s: why I kept this melt up in there and I
1078.68s: had one of the most bearish forecasts
1080.18s: call for a global bus coming but it's
1082.88s: because there is an awful lot of
1084.32s: liquidity and
1086.50s: investors particularly institutional
1089.12s: investors were self-position bearish
1091.58s: they said before we get to that Bust or
1094.76s: before we get to that downside story
1097.24s: there's a there's a big reaction back
1099.92s: the other way and that's what we're
1101.30s: seeing I mean since last October and
1104.24s: it's just not over yet and I I feel
1106.64s: comfortable saying there's still plenty
1108.32s: of liquidity out there it's not and you
1111.44s: know unfortunately I think a lot of
1113.42s: particularly retail investors have kind
1117.20s: of come to the conclusion that you can
1119.00s: that you need fed stimulus
1122.18s: to drive markets so when the fed's
1125.12s: tightening it's like how can the market
1126.62s: go up and I go the Market's not you know
1129.26s: there were times where the market threw
1131.66s: you know the last many decades had had
1135.02s: no monetary stimulus
1137.66s: and and had big bull markets you know
1140.18s: it's there's money in the system that
1142.88s: gets redeployed into stocks at times
1146.60s: and can drive the market it's not the
1149.00s: fed the fed's not buying the stocks to
1151.46s: move the market up
1152.96s: we don't need new money all the time to
1155.54s: drive a bull market and but we do have a
1158.42s: lot of money in the system thanks to
1160.04s: what happened in in the pandemic and and
1163.58s: I think that's that's why you're going
1166.10s: to get this what seems incredible uh you
1169.82s: know
1170.50s: 2000 or 2500 Point rally in the s p in
1174.80s: less than six months
1177.38s: right and your Catalyst for the turnover
1182.48s: after we see that kind of Rapid
1185.84s: Ascension does that remain the same or
1187.94s: has that evolved
1189.68s: no it's the same you know my time frame
1191.72s: hasn't changed but it also can change in
1194.66s: other words I I don't have a precise
1196.70s: time because you know it may sound
1200.14s: disingenuous to say this but the market
1202.52s: will tell us when it's going to roll
1204.20s: over I can't tell you that now I can
1206.06s: tell you what I think in general terms
1208.46s: that I think the Melt up is going to be
1210.32s: Steep and fast so it's going to happen
1212.30s: and you know a matter of months not a
1214.94s: matter of years
1216.80s: um the bust is going to come I think in
1218.90s: 2024 I don't know whether it starts
1221.60s: immediately early in 2024 or stretches
1224.48s: you know we stretch this thing out for a
1226.40s: few more months beyond that
1228.20s: I don't think that's important the point
1230.42s: is that you've got what I think is going
1232.82s: to be the biggest financial crisis if
1234.86s: not in history certainly in post-world
1236.66s: War II era coming next year and we're
1239.96s: going to have a downturn that's perhaps
1242.84s: the biggest in in the post-war World War
1245.72s: II era so so uh the thing the thing that
1249.32s: people have to remember is it's not all
1251.06s: driven by the FED either it's a global
1253.94s: bust
1254.90s: and if you look around the world China's
1257.54s: obviously in a place they haven't been
1259.28s: in in decades you know there's they're
1262.10s: slowing down fast and they don't have
1263.90s: easy answers because they their last 20
1266.60s: years were driven by Massive debt and
1269.72s: and liquidity so you know the they can't
1273.56s: just turn that pump on again because
1275.80s: they got those same issues out there of
1278.84s: huge excesses if we just add those
1281.00s: excesses we create more more excesses so
1284.12s: they're wrestling with how do we fix
1286.16s: this and their real estate sector is
1288.08s: really getting hurt
1290.00s: um and is vulnerable here
1292.58s: so China's China's a lot weaker than we
1295.52s: are right now
1297.44s: um Europe's weaker than we are right now
1300.86s: Canada's got problems Australia is a
1303.62s: house of cards so so it's not just the
1306.74s: U.S we can look at the U.S and say well
1308.78s: we're you know people out there talking
1310.88s: about no you know soft Landing no
1313.34s: Landing well you know I don't think
1316.70s: we're going to be immune to a landing
1318.38s: when you look around the world to see
1321.08s: how much trouble is everywhere and again
1323.60s: I'm not saying it's imminent I think
1325.64s: it's next year
1327.32s: um but I don't yeah I don't know exactly
1329.06s: when it starts
1330.50s: and do you how do you view the cycle
1334.16s: going like do you think the U.S starts
1336.56s: the decline and then the other countries
1338.90s: follow or do you kind of Envision a
1342.32s: broader external contraction that then
1345.38s: the US becomes sympathetic to and
1347.32s: collapses with
1349.22s: yeah I honestly don't know I have said
1351.62s: over for a several years I think I've
1354.38s: said that I think there's a decent
1357.32s: likelihood that it could start overseas
1359.42s: certainly the the financial crisis will
1363.14s: be centered I think elsewhere in other
1365.30s: words I think our banks took such a hit
1368.06s: in 0809 uh and had to raise capital and
1372.02s: you know we we got religion over here in
1374.30s: terms of Regulation
1376.10s: our banks are better capitalized than
1378.02s: most of the world today right whereas
1380.18s: the opposite was true in 2008.
1383.00s: um so I think the real vulnerable banks
1385.28s: are more centered in
1387.44s: Europe maybe China I don't you know it's
1390.74s: closed systems so it's hard to know
1392.24s: exactly what will happen there
1395.12s: um China Australia Canada those banks
1399.32s: are in and you know have have greater
1402.14s: risks than our banks now our big Banks
1405.14s: uh and we have plenty of risk in our you
1407.60s: know the regional Banks we saw last
1408.98s: March there's plenty of problems here I
1411.98s: don't mean to say we're in great shape
1414.74s: um the office building uh commercial you
1417.20s: know commercial real estate situation is
1419.36s: one issue and you know the rapid rise in
1424.22s: rates has kind of uh creates some
1426.98s: balance sheet problems for lots of banks
1429.62s: um our big Banks though however where we
1432.62s: do have better capitalize more
1434.60s: conservatively we run Banks now than you
1437.36s: know 20 years ago 15 years ago
1440.54s: um
1441.26s: they still have big counterparty risks
1443.84s: though with overseas Banks and you know
1447.32s: it's a it's a it's not a closed system
1449.74s: so I'm not by any means assuming that
1453.02s: we're going to skate through this you
1454.64s: know we could lose a big bank here there
1457.76s: um and certainly Regional Banks but I do
1460.76s: think the bigger financial crisis
1463.88s: events are going to probably be overseas
1466.82s: as to who you know what triggers it you
1469.34s: never know what Catalyst exactly could
1472.04s: be a bank and we saw how quick things
1473.96s: can change in March you know you heard
1476.48s: on a Friday and by Monday you knew you
1479.00s: know Silicon Valley was in trouble and
1480.80s: the Republic was you know in trouble and
1483.62s: so it it can happen very fast
1487.76s: um you may get some you know some
1490.04s: murmurs of it a few days early and then
1491.90s: it hits but I I do think you know it
1495.92s: could come from a lot of different
1497.54s: places
1499.94s: one of the things you mentioned in that
1501.74s: was just a little bit about the kind of
1504.56s: Housing and I've been generally baffled
1508.54s: by what I've seen in like the home
1512.66s: builders ETF xhb compared to what I see
1516.56s: in terms of like demand for housing
1519.44s: right now so like the number of homes
1521.06s: sold across the US according to Redfin
1523.64s: is down like 16 year over year
1526.46s: I was thinking maybe they're seeing some
1529.34s: sort of broader demand that's why
1531.14s: Builders are staying busy but with rates
1533.72s: still as high as it is I I just I don't
1535.82s: understand enough about their production
1537.44s: cycle I was assuming it's a little bit
1538.94s: longer runs so they're expecting once
1541.04s: rates fall there to be maybe a surplus
1543.50s: of demand that they're trying to meet
1544.70s: but I can't make heads or tails of it
1547.16s: I'm curious if you have an opinion on
1548.54s: why home builders seem to be busy
1551.90s: against a otherwise pretty damn weak
1555.14s: housing market at least for the
1556.28s: residential side yeah for sure it's
1559.40s: um I think it's pretty simple actually
1561.16s: if you're
1563.06s: if you're in a home that you you know
1565.64s: purchased you know in the last five ten
1568.64s: years or 20 years whenever
1570.62s: you're sitting here particularly the
1572.18s: last 10 years you're sitting on a you
1574.40s: know three or four percent mortgage rate
1576.02s: if not lower
1577.82s: um and you're sitting there and saying
1579.32s: you know I'm not I'm not selling my
1581.24s: house to buy another house because you
1584.00s: know right away my mortgage rate doubles
1586.10s: or more and and
1589.22s: um you know I'm I'm not going to be able
1591.56s: to get what I want to get so so the
1595.04s: supply of houses on the market as being
1597.98s: very much constrained by the mortgage
1600.38s: rate right by the big rise in rates you
1603.44s: know the same thing that happened to the
1604.70s: banks where you had a 500 base Point
1606.26s: rise in in rates happen to mortgage
1609.02s: rates and so it shut off the secondary
1612.68s: Market
1613.94s: for you know there are obviously there
1617.30s: are some homes and they are turning over
1619.10s: but as you've heard I'm sure we hear
1623.00s: um you know there's multiple buyers for
1625.46s: these homes you go you go to buy a house
1627.32s: and there's you know three or four
1629.18s: bidders and they've been over asking
1631.76s: price and you know people are you know
1634.46s: clamoring again house and every time
1636.08s: they lose out because there were three
1637.40s: other people that outbid them so so
1639.98s: secondary homes you know as you say
1642.74s: there's 17 drop in in uh homes you know
1647.06s: uh secondary homes yeah yeah
1650.36s: um however
1652.34s: the home builders are subsidizing the
1655.70s: mortgage rates so they're offering
1657.64s: incentives they're saying you can if you
1660.68s: if you buy a home we'll give you a five
1663.26s: percent mortgage or we'll give you a
1664.94s: four and three quarter percent mortgage
1666.56s: and they're it's coming out of their
1668.78s: profit margin obviously because they
1670.34s: have to you know they have to fund it
1673.22s: um you know by you know getting money
1675.26s: either
1676.58s: through the banks or through folding a
1680.48s: bond whatever so they're they're
1683.42s: basically rather than doing Market rates
1685.76s: they're doing you know a much below
1688.16s: market rate so all these people that are
1691.04s: lined up to buy homes
1693.20s: are saying I'm not in I'm not going to
1696.02s: go into the secondary market for a home
1697.82s: because
1698.96s: you know I can't find what I want it's
1701.06s: overpriced it's you know the every time
1703.82s: I go to bid on one there's three other
1706.10s: people bidding on that same house so
1708.38s: they're they're able to go to these home
1711.02s: builders
1712.10s: and I don't know how how common this is
1714.80s: but I think in the big National home
1716.48s: builders it's pretty common and and get
1719.54s: financing deals that are attractive
1722.12s: and and say and and keep in mind there's
1725.72s: a lot of people that are fearful this
1728.00s: happens every mouthing cycle that this
1730.40s: is never going to end that you're never
1731.78s: going to see housing prices below this
1733.70s: again so you better buy now because
1735.62s: they're only going to go up
1737.18s: so all those people they're let's say
1739.52s: first-time home buyers
1741.38s: that are scared to death that they're
1743.18s: not going to be able to buy a house
1744.62s: afford a house if they don't do it now
1746.80s: are jumping at the chance to get a five
1749.78s: percent mortgage rate on a brand new
1751.46s: house and they're not so worried that
1753.80s: maybe they're paying top dollar for that
1755.84s: house you know the house that might have
1758.42s: sold for 150
1760.70s: 000 less
1762.02s: three years ago they're they're just
1764.84s: glad to get in and be able to afford the
1766.58s: mortgage payment even even if it's high
1770.18s: um interesting so it really is favoring
1772.94s: the new home
1774.32s: by a new home seller you know the the
1776.96s: home builders
1778.40s: and and what you're going to find I
1781.04s: think in the bust is that the secondary
1784.04s: markets all of a sudden gonna open up
1787.04s: because you're gonna have for selling by
1788.90s: some people you know whether it be
1790.40s: foreclosure or people that waited so
1793.10s: long and they said you know I lost my
1795.38s: job I can't can't hold on to this house
1797.78s: or or you know any number of reasons
1800.42s: you're going to see that Supply expand
1802.40s: you're also going to see you know all
1804.86s: those people that that you know went
1807.14s: into the BNB business uh the Airbnb
1810.62s: business you know if you're not seeing
1813.98s: the kind of
1815.00s: rental market you did see before
1818.08s: it may not be worth holding on to those
1820.70s: things so you can see that Supply come
1822.56s: back out or some of it so I think I have
1825.38s: no doubt we're gonna have a down cycle
1826.94s: all those people who think that's going
1828.98s: away you know I've been doing this too
1830.78s: long and seen too many cycles it always
1833.60s: happens it just doesn't happen right
1835.28s: away and uh you know it happens
1837.80s: typically when everybody gives up on it
1839.84s: happening that's where we're at now so
1842.60s: so I'm pretty sure in the bust you're
1846.26s: going to see a down Market I'm I'm
1847.94s: predicting potentially 30 drop in home
1850.58s: prices during the bust so you know what
1854.12s: do I know it doesn't mean it's going to
1855.74s: be 30 but I think the potential is there
1858.08s: for that kind of you know there's a lot
1859.94s: of air in home prices right now because
1861.98s: right houses are less affordable than
1865.40s: ever in history I think right now
1868.22s: um you know the affordability index
1869.66s: shows them you know totally Out Of Reach
1872.42s: with so many people I just don't think
1874.82s: that's sustainable
1876.80s: and speaking of affordability another
1879.26s: thing I wanted to get your take on was
1880.70s: just consumer spending right now I've
1882.56s: been tracking that pretty regularly
1884.78s: along with you know CPI PPI stuff like
1887.06s: that but the consumer spending has
1889.70s: seemed more resilient than I would have
1892.40s: expected and I don't know if that's tied
1895.40s: to the job market because job market
1898.16s: metrics came out today for jobless
1899.90s: claims and they actually came in at like
1901.52s: 230 compared to 240 expected so I don't
1904.64s: know if maybe that's what we're seeing
1906.20s: but like what do you make of just the
1908.60s: consumer spending habits right now and
1910.16s: how does that play out throughout your
1911.48s: cycle prediction
1912.80s: yeah I I think what we're seeing is a a
1915.80s: Have and Have Not not economy so
1919.34s: um you know again it goes back to that
1921.02s: that whole thing of we had an awful lot
1923.96s: of fiscal stimulus during 2021 2020 and
1928.70s: 21.
1930.56s: um you know checks handed out to
1932.42s: everybody
1933.38s: Etc I think that savings is being drawn
1937.28s: down and is getting to the point where a
1939.56s: lot of the the excess
1942.02s: stimulus is gone from from the consumer
1946.30s: savings standpoint
1948.86s: um and you're seeing that in some of the
1950.48s: signs are you seeing
1952.76s: um you know credit card balances moving
1955.16s: up you're seeing delinquencies moving up
1957.56s: so I think there's a have not part of
1959.78s: the economy that those people are even
1962.60s: having to use a credit cards for
1964.10s: necessities
1965.54s: and and yet you still have all this
1969.26s: wealth effect out there
1971.84s: um I saw some statistic whereas
1973.94s: something like 40 or 50 percent of
1975.86s: homeowners have no mortgage
1979.04s: because you know they're Baby Boomers or
1981.26s: whatever held on to their houses
1983.18s: and so so you've got a lot of people
1985.82s: with a lot of equity it's it's it's
1987.80s: weird for me to be talking about you
1990.50s: know the biggest financial crisis in
1991.76s: history huge downturn next year
1994.94s: when you've got that kind of stuff but I
1996.98s: think it could have happened it can it
1999.02s: can reverse in a hurry
2001.18s: um so you've got you've got to have part
2003.22s: of the economy uh half part of the
2005.02s: consumer not just the wealthy but you
2009.58s: know people that have plenty of equity
2011.02s: in their homes and they have a good
2014.02s: um pension or 401K with plenty plenty of
2017.86s: Assets in there and those people don't
2020.26s: mind spending you know they're saying
2022.18s: hey I got plenty of buffer I can I can
2025.42s: spend a little bit more than my income
2027.16s: or what have you
2028.90s: um so I think that half of the economy
2030.82s: is fine and is just not willing to quit
2033.76s: the other half is trying to get by
2036.22s: and they're saying at the end of the at
2038.62s: the end of the month
2040.48s: I don't have enough money to afford
2043.12s: groceries I barely you know I'm not able
2046.24s: to pay my utilities every month you know
2048.52s: I'm paying them in in piecemeal or
2051.04s: whatever I there's there's a you know I
2054.16s: think there's a chunk of the economy or
2056.56s: a chunk of the um
2058.54s: consumer that is strapped completely and
2062.98s: and then you've got somewhere in that
2066.22s: middle
2067.72s: people are
2069.40s: are just crazy enough to say
2072.28s: I'm going to have a thousand dollar car
2074.32s: payment but I want that car today you
2077.32s: know uh and I want an electric guitar
2079.24s: right you know it's it's shop till you
2082.24s: drop for some people and they don't
2084.94s: necessarily have the the financial
2087.76s: common sense to know that they're not
2090.64s: going to be holding on to that car very
2092.14s: long you know something's gonna happen
2094.18s: next year that's probably going to tell
2095.56s: them they can't they can't make their
2097.48s: payments so so I I think we're kind of a
2100.78s: mixed economy
2102.70s: um and you know as I try to explain when
2105.04s: when I talk about a melt up and then I
2107.20s: talk about a bust well people don't miss
2109.96s: in there is that it gravitates the Melt
2112.60s: up is about the market so it's really
2114.76s: melt up in Bear are the two equivalents
2117.40s: the bust is you know an economy that's
2121.84s: in re you know an economy that's moving
2123.58s: up in a bust which is you know a bad
2125.56s: economy are the comparison so it's not
2128.50s: really melt up into a bust it's melt up
2130.96s: into a bear but if you understand what
2133.24s: I'm saying your bust refers to the
2135.40s: economy not the market but people kind
2137.98s: of use the bus stand and talk about the
2140.38s: market so but so people don't realize
2143.08s: that there's something in between before
2144.76s: we get to the bust we're going to be in
2147.40s: negative economic territory we're going
2149.92s: to be in recession before the bus the
2152.86s: bus goes when the recession gets worse
2155.14s: and the financial crisis kicks in and
2157.72s: all of a sudden you got Banks failing
2159.40s: and you got you know a lot of uh
2162.88s: involuntary debt liquidation
2165.88s: um so there is a period and it could
2168.16s: start before the end of the year that
2170.50s: we're in negative GDP territory
2173.80s: um he had a late this year early next
2175.36s: but we're not immediately going into you
2179.50s: know deep dive
2181.84s: got it and
2183.46s: one of the follow-ups I have there just
2185.92s: considering the broader perspective
2188.98s: when we get to this bust phase
2193.00s: what
2194.56s: like what is the duration of that look
2197.08s: like to you like what is the quality of
2198.64s: it obviously not looking for you know
2200.26s: any sort of like rough or hard timeline
2202.12s: assessments but I'm curious like how
2204.22s: that actually plays out like a broad
2206.02s: cycle perspective yeah I'm I'm still
2209.62s: thinking we're gonna have the bus
2211.42s: dominate 2024 so whether it starts in
2214.42s: January February March April I'm not
2216.94s: sure but I think the bulk of 2024 is
2219.76s: going to be a negative economy and a
2222.40s: negative Financial environment very
2224.44s: negative
2225.76s: um I think it's fast so I I I've said
2230.50s: before I view the bus that my
2233.14s: description of the bust is something
2234.82s: that's
2236.20s: can feel like a depression
2239.56s: um but at the speed of a recession so a
2241.78s: recession is usually 12 to 18 months
2244.84s: um and that's kind of what I think this
2246.34s: will be
2247.24s: but I think that the financial crisis
2249.82s: kicking in where you've got major Banks
2252.04s: dominoing across the world in failure
2255.76s: is what the bust is about it's the it's
2258.76s: when when you start wondering I mean you
2261.52s: know go back to 2008 nine
2264.22s: there were periods in there where you
2266.26s: just didn't know where you know how long
2267.94s: is this going to be where are we we're
2269.92s: we're seeing our biggest and best banks
2273.34s: and and other financial institutions you
2276.34s: know at risk of going belly up you know
2279.16s: and obviously Layman went and belly up
2281.44s: and AIG could have gone Belly Up and
2284.20s: even GE came close so so that's you know
2289.18s: as I say 2008-9
2292.60s: is came very close to a bust what I
2295.96s: think
2296.82s: 2024 is is that next step where where in
2301.24s: the fall of 20 in the fall of uh 2008
2306.46s: the FED acted fast
2308.92s: the government acted fast and they they
2311.62s: stepped in and unfroze the commercial
2313.96s: paper Market which was
2316.18s: a day away from shutting GE down
2319.60s: um you know if they hadn't acted fast we
2322.36s: probably would have seen a bust in 2009
2324.48s: this time around I think because the
2327.40s: excesses are that much greater The
2328.90s: Leverage is that much greater
2330.76s: and there's some reluctance to do the
2333.70s: same thing again you know as you know
2335.68s: and you know that's when Powell's Mantra
2338.68s: we're not going to do that again we're
2339.88s: not going to do QE again we're not gonna
2341.74s: so they're gonna pull they're gonna be
2343.90s: slow to do the things they're gonna have
2345.46s: to do to save the system and it's in
2347.98s: that time that they hesitate
2350.68s: that things can can break if they had
2353.44s: the mindset
2355.00s: in 2008 that they have today
2358.00s: we would have seen a bust in 2008 and
2361.18s: and yeah
2362.92s: look at the difference in the leverage
2364.78s: today I mean we are at you know we are
2367.78s: at 300 trillion dead across the globe we
2371.20s: are at a 9 trillion fed balance sheet
2373.66s: when when in the fall of 2008 we were
2376.62s: 875 billion I mean the Leverage is just
2380.20s: massive massively different
2382.78s: and Leverage is what can move things
2385.48s: much faster on both the upside when it's
2388.24s: good on the downside when things are bad
2390.70s: and that's that's what I think people
2394.06s: don't yet grasp
2395.86s: is how you can see things just go wow
2399.40s: how did that happen so fast you know
2401.08s: whoa
2404.74s: right one of the things we talked about
2407.08s: last time as well was Metals the way
2410.02s: that you saw them moving and I know that
2412.48s: we're coming up on time here so I don't
2414.82s: want your your medals fans coming to
2416.68s: beat me up every time I forget to talk
2419.44s: about metals they let me know so I
2421.60s: refuse to forget
2423.40s: um yeah good good I'm glad you did that
2425.32s: because
2426.64s: I think we're such a great inflection
2429.94s: point
2431.26s: um you know if you go back
2434.44s: um to 2001
2438.46s: um you know
2440.22s: gold was at
2443.50s: um
2444.58s: where was gold gold was at 800 I guess
2448.06s: yeah yeah down here and we ran we ran up
2451.30s: you can see it ran up to 1900. we have
2455.44s: spent all of the time since 2011 when it
2459.70s: was in 1900
2461.20s: we have spent in this kind of
2463.30s: consolidation sideways to op
2465.52s: consolidation you know went through a
2467.98s: big sell-off and in 2016 early 2016
2471.58s: began from I think 1060 if I remember
2474.64s: right
2476.14s: um and and began that run up
2479.50s: we are you know it's funny because
2481.48s: people are really kind of very down on
2484.24s: Golden Goal it's never going anywhere
2486.22s: golden and then you look at this chart
2488.08s: and you go my God
2490.54s: we're we're not that far off all-time
2493.42s: highs right I mean we're in
2496.20s: 1950 wherever we are and we're we're
2500.62s: um 19 20 30. we're we're not far off
2503.92s: all-time highs we get above 2100 and
2506.38s: it's clear sailing never had a resist
2508.90s: never no resistance above that and
2511.42s: that's why I think once you break out
2513.46s: we're going to be at 3 000 in a hurry so
2516.64s: my belief is in the next six to eight
2519.04s: months we'll see three thousand on gold
2520.78s: in the next you know month or or so
2524.50s: month or two we should be in new highs
2527.34s: uh and then a big run from there so so
2530.62s: my pre-bus call is 3 000 on gold that's
2533.26s: been my target for a long time and it
2535.06s: remains my target
2537.28s: um and I see nothing here that's
2540.70s: disturbing I hear all kinds of people
2542.86s: talking lower you know
2545.44s: um I I could be wrong and maybe we're
2547.48s: going down but everything points to I
2551.08s: think in fact I think we we are turning
2553.84s: as we speak you know I think we turn
2555.88s: this week
2557.92s: um and you know we get down basically
2560.26s: the 1900 again and I think we are going
2563.98s: to start that run to make new highs
2566.08s: within the month within you know within
2568.36s: the next month uh and once we break out
2571.12s: you know you probably do a little retest
2574.18s: back at that high and then you just
2576.76s: start running
2579.04s: um as I've said I think gold probably
2581.20s: Peaks after the you know the peak the
2584.14s: peak in the s p or the peak in the
2586.00s: equity Market will probably occur prior
2588.64s: to the peak in the medals
2590.86s: um you know metals can can go you know
2593.14s: they're starting later they can go far
2595.48s: longer
2596.92s: um but I think I think both are pretty
2598.90s: bust so the peak and metals probably is
2601.60s: sometime first or second quarter next
2604.30s: year
2605.74s: um and like I said we can be in
2607.12s: recession while the medals are still
2609.58s: running
2610.36s: the bus may not hit until middle of the
2613.12s: next year so the bus the bus is a 2024
2616.18s: story and we'll be on our way to the bus
2618.76s: to negative economic territory maybe
2621.16s: right from the get-go in 2024 but that
2624.28s: doesn't mean the bus hits right away so
2626.50s: you have time for this thing and and
2629.02s: maybe it'll happen faster maybe we'll be
2631.06s: at 3 000 on gold before the end by the
2633.94s: end of the year I don't know that but I
2636.22s: think common sense says you know it's
2638.50s: likely to take longer than that so it
2640.42s: you know first quarter second quarter
2641.92s: next year
2642.94s: silver
2644.80s: um same same story really quick can I
2648.40s: ask you a quick quick question on gold
2649.78s: before we pivot to Silver what do you
2652.00s: make of like these kind of three
2653.74s: attempts at that high level in goal does
2656.32s: that mean anything I don't follow goal
2658.18s: anywhere near as closely to you so I'm
2659.56s: actually like generally curious how you
2661.00s: view that kind of it seems resistance
2663.16s: but I'm not sure what to call it yeah
2665.56s: it's a triple top You could argue it's
2668.20s: triple top but it's also a triple effort
2671.14s: you know obviously the first time up was
2673.18s: a new high it went to 2100 above that 19
2676.00s: 10 15 20 area back in 2011. So made a
2681.46s: new high there and it's made three
2682.96s: attempts
2684.22s: there are two more attempts to break
2686.44s: through that area and failed at that
2688.30s: level each time I think most technicians
2691.60s: would probably tell you that
2694.96s: um you know third time's a charm you you
2697.00s: tried to break out above that 2100 once
2699.94s: yeah you made the high and whenever that
2702.28s: was you went to break Above It Again the
2704.92s: second time and then and then or or the
2708.28s: next time and then again a second time
2711.16s: so I think the next time third is the
2713.38s: charm that what you do is each time you
2716.08s: weaken that resistance a bit and I think
2719.32s: you're going to push through it next
2720.58s: time and then just keep going so I I
2723.34s: view that as bullish
2725.50s: yeah it's it's interesting too because
2727.54s: just from like a typical technical
2729.22s: perspective from like trading I kind of
2731.08s: view exactly what you're seeing as well
2732.82s: because I also see this was like a
2734.98s: pretty big extension it touched it ran
2736.60s: away this one it touched it hung out and
2738.70s: then now there's actually a lot of
2739.78s: congestion building in this level which
2742.12s: tends to me would lead me to believe
2744.34s: that people are starting to get more
2745.60s: comfortable with that price but I
2746.92s: appreciate it like I said I know you
2748.54s: tried gold pretty closely so I was
2750.04s: curious how to how to take a look at
2751.42s: that and by the way the sentiment with
2755.86s: this sell-off from you know 2100 down to
2758.74s: 19 or so a couple of hundred dollar
2760.72s: sell-offs in the last you know
2763.72s: number of months has really created
2767.74s: people people are are have given up on
2770.68s: gold there's so many people that I I run
2773.44s: across that say oh gold will never do
2776.02s: anything for you you know Gold's a dead
2777.76s: dead
2779.38s: um investment and so it's amazing to me
2782.26s: when you look at that chart and you
2784.06s: realize you're not far from all-time
2786.28s: highs and the you know the pattern you
2788.74s: see there is not something that you
2790.54s: would think would would have discouraged
2793.36s: people so much but that's what I see is
2796.00s: very discouraged investors that just
2797.98s: have no hope they just think of gold is
2800.38s: a dead investment I've waited too long
2802.12s: for it and I mean Silver's worse but but
2806.14s: uh you know in both sediment is at the
2809.02s: levels that normally precedes a big run
2812.32s: is
2814.90s: super flat here yeah Silver's it's it's
2819.24s: haven't been able to get out of its way
2821.50s: you look at that great run similar to
2824.56s: gold from the early 2000s up to 2011.
2828.88s: and you know it's been from then this
2833.68s: long period of consolidation and you sit
2836.44s: there and you kind of have to you know
2838.78s: you just scratch your head and go how
2840.88s: come but I'm I'm a I'm a huge believer
2844.06s: that what you've got is a a huge
2847.06s: consolidation a huge base from which to
2850.48s: build and I think you've got I'm my
2853.48s: target is still sixty dollars pre-bust
2855.58s: so same time Horizon as gold
2858.70s: um and I it's you know you gotta you
2861.34s: gotta get through more resistance and
2863.02s: silver obviously there's you know you're
2865.12s: a lot farther away from the old High
2868.06s: um up around uh a close to 50 48 yeah
2872.58s: uh it looks like yeah like 40 it almost
2875.20s: looks like it hit 50 on the nose yeah so
2878.02s: you've got to still work through all
2880.18s: that there but I I think that lung
2883.84s: consolidation a lot of those people are
2885.40s: out already you know they took losses
2887.62s: and left
2889.00s: um and if you if you know I mean they've
2892.96s: been smaller bounces but the the moves
2895.38s: uh in during the consolidation when it
2898.78s: goes It goes in kind of vertical fashion
2901.02s: the the most recent one was back in 2020
2904.24s: after you know it sold off in the uh
2907.48s: early 2020 and that March 2020 sell off
2910.36s: but it had a huge run from there
2913.18s: uh into August and that's what I see
2916.00s: here is again I think this thing can
2917.92s: really go vertical
2919.96s: um within you know within the next six
2922.42s: months so I think it started I think um
2925.42s: you know I think you've you've basically
2928.00s: in the very way over on the right side
2930.22s: you can see kind of a double bottom
2931.90s: there uh a little bit of a w and we just
2936.10s: hit our low this week and I think from
2938.50s: there we we move up
2940.30s: you know you got to get up above 30
2942.22s: first then I think you know above 35 you
2945.76s: run into probably back to the old highs
2948.22s: and then I think you break out so it's a
2951.40s: big it's a big call it's a you know it's
2953.50s: an aggressive move from here but that's
2956.74s: what I see I I just think silver a
2959.32s: sentiment is rock bottom
2961.96s: right yeah and again what what drives it
2965.38s: yeah what drives it is more than
2967.90s: anything else is a dollar you can have
2969.52s: rates coming down that'll be bullish for
2971.68s: both gold and silver and you can have
2973.84s: the dollar and then I throw in that
2976.06s: third thing which is you all of a sudden
2978.46s: I think what's hurt the medals a lot is
2981.16s: they they really are hurt more than
2983.44s: anything else by the FED
2985.78s: um in tightening mode when you all of a
2988.84s: sudden when the street all of a sudden
2990.16s: decides
2991.60s: tightening is done
2993.64s: whether the FED thinks it's done or not
2995.68s: if the street decides it's done
2998.20s: you're going to see several months where
3000.24s: you're going to see the markets all
3001.68s: markets all all these things run that's
3004.62s: that's a I just don't think people
3006.96s: realize how much of an impact
3009.42s: tightening has had
3011.52s: taking that away becomes a huge win that
3013.98s: you're back
3016.56s: it'll be interesting too to kind of see
3018.78s: things that I think retail Traders tend
3022.08s: to view as
3023.72s: inversely correlated you but in general
3026.58s: you know people tend to expect the
3028.38s: market to go up and then you know metals
3030.30s: to go down and vice versa as people are
3032.04s: flight equity and whatnot so it'll
3033.90s: actually be really fascinating to see
3035.88s: all of them moving in the same direction
3037.50s: essentially you know if if your
3039.36s: prediction plays out as you see it does
3040.92s: yeah it's
3041.96s: interesting I I said this week we're at
3044.94s: inflection points on so many things I
3047.22s: think interest rates are at an
3048.90s: inflection point and I'm calling for big
3051.06s: down yeah obviously
3052.92s: 250 on the 10-year maybe by the end of
3056.10s: the year that's a big move and nobody
3058.32s: else is looking for anything like that
3059.64s: in fact most are looking up not down
3062.70s: um you know the third year I think can
3064.14s: get to the time frame
3066.84s: um and again those are those are just
3068.64s: during the Melt up phase
3070.86s: during the bust phase I'm calling for 10
3074.04s: years to go to zero or negative
3076.20s: so
3077.76s: um so in other words from here you're
3079.50s: not going to see higher rates you're
3080.46s: going to see much lower rates over the
3081.84s: course of the next year uh so that's a
3084.12s: big inflection point in rates if I'm
3085.68s: right
3086.52s: big inflection point in the dollar if
3088.68s: I'm right even though
3095.22s: um I think the dollar is very close to a
3097.68s: rollover and you know with dollars at
3100.20s: 104 essentially I think are close to it
3103.38s: and I think it can get down to 80.
3105.60s: that's a big you know 24 Point drop
3109.14s: um before the bust or you know early in
3112.14s: the bus maybe they'll keep going
3114.24s: um and then you got equities and you got
3116.28s: medals
3117.36s: um you know at that major turning points
3119.88s: here you know whether it's right here or
3122.46s: in the next week or two
3124.80s: um it just seems like everything's
3127.32s: coming together and the thing that I
3129.60s: think kind of brings it all to that
3131.28s: point is the Fed
3134.36s: and yet people you know people ask me
3137.82s: all the time if the fan hikes in
3140.46s: September does that change your view I
3142.38s: go no I'm not worried about whether
3144.48s: they're absolutely done I think that the
3147.60s: narrative that will be coming in this
3149.58s: fall will be that the FED tightening
3152.40s: cycle is ending
3153.96s: not necessarily ended but ending
3157.38s: and that enough would be kind of the the
3160.02s: fuel that you see
3161.46s: yeah again if if you think the FED cycle
3164.82s: you know the tightening cycle which
3166.56s: started uh you know a year and a half
3169.68s: ago or a year and a few months ago if if
3173.46s: you think it's over
3175.08s: usually fed Cycles fed tightening Cycles
3177.66s: once they end they're over for several
3180.36s: years right
3181.80s: so that means you got wind in your back
3183.78s: for several years now my view is that
3187.20s: they'll probably come back in maybe as
3189.78s: soon as a few months later and say oh my
3191.94s: God the Market's up at six thousand we
3194.70s: got a Titan so I'm not saying it's over
3197.16s: but if the street believes it's over for
3199.68s: a few months who might argue that or
3202.20s: who's anybody to argue that if if the
3204.18s: FED even thinks it's over
3206.58s: um you know then that's what will be the
3209.22s: narrative for that period
3210.96s: it will change back to a different
3212.76s: narrative If the Fed has to come back in
3215.46s: and then and then it's time to get
3217.38s: bearish
3218.76s: well as always I know we're up at time
3220.98s: here but it is it's fascinating it's
3223.32s: fascinating to look at the markets and
3224.76s: the economy through your lens so thank
3227.34s: you for taking the time right to to
3229.38s: share your experience with us what
3230.82s: you're looking at the relationships that
3232.26s: you see I think it's super informative
3233.82s: for people so before we wrap up though
3237.18s: um I'll make sure to throw a link to
3238.92s: your Twitter which is at Dave H
3240.96s: contrarian and I'll have that in the
3243.36s: video description there's a lot of fake
3245.10s: news out there so we'll get the real you
3247.02s: in front of folks and then is there
3248.82s: anything else that you want to share
3249.90s: with the folks before we uh wrap up here
3252.66s: yeah just just to say if if we're going
3255.84s: to get
3257.58s: um what I just talked about
3260.10s: um you know this is going to be a heck
3262.08s: of a fall I mean it's and people are
3265.08s: just gonna have to keep their wits about
3266.64s: them because it's it's not something
3269.58s: that's going to be sustained for several
3271.08s: years it's something that will happen
3272.40s: fast be amazing uh be be compelling but
3278.16s: also be you know don't don't let your
3279.96s: emotions get away from you because it
3282.30s: can you can easily get sucked in
3284.94s: um obviously it's a forecast so I can't
3286.80s: guarantee it's happening or I can't you
3289.38s: know I could be wrong but but if what I
3292.74s: see and I'm you know as I say it's an
3295.20s: eye conviction call for me but I see
3297.00s: what's what I think I see you know this
3299.88s: is this next several months will be a
3302.28s: period for the history books
3304.86s: um well I'll tell you what for the
3306.30s: options Traders out there that just
3307.86s: Delights me because as soon as we
3309.66s: started facility that's that's bread and
3312.00s: butter right there so yeah let me
3313.68s: caution because I I you know as I say on
3316.56s: Twitter I'm a strategist and I forecast
3318.30s: I don't provide advice I don't recommend
3321.44s: uh the people that have the hardest time
3324.00s: with me are the short-term traders of
3326.70s: course I am my history is I'm you know
3330.06s: I'm earlier I'm you know things get
3332.94s: stretched out so the people that
3335.52s: probably hate me the most are options
3336.90s: Traders because I I can talk like it's
3339.00s: coming imminently and then it takes
3341.94s: longer and I and I just chucked that up
3344.82s: to the market they're in charge not me
3347.16s: um so I just caution if you have a lot
3349.08s: of options guys following this
3352.08s: um give yourself plenty of time and
3353.88s: those options because you know three
3355.80s: months may not be how fast it happens
3358.32s: um you know it could take longer and one
3360.72s: of the things that I always talk to
3361.86s: specifically options Traders about or
3363.48s: just any Trader is you know the the idea
3365.34s: at least in my opinion isn't as a retail
3367.38s: Trader it's not it's not to pinpoint any
3369.96s: sort of pivot it's to ride the broader
3372.90s: wave and take 60 80 points out of it
3375.30s: right like there's tons of money to be
3376.74s: made in there which is directly to your
3378.78s: point I find the people that get
3380.28s: frustrated at you are honestly just lazy
3382.44s: and they want somebody to hand them
3384.08s: tradable information that's completely
3386.52s: accurate and they don't have to think
3388.14s: which unfortunately or fortunately
3390.30s: depending on how you look at it is not
3392.28s: how the markets work yeah and if and if
3394.62s: not lazy at least
3396.66s: um naive and probably in a in a market
3399.78s: they shouldn't be in meaning you know if
3401.94s: they're playing an option I mean they're
3403.44s: looking as easy money and you know more
3405.84s: than I do the options are not easy money
3408.00s: you better you better know your stuff
3409.98s: because it it it takes the money from
3413.04s: the best of us in that business I mean
3415.08s: you know it's too easy to be a gambler
3418.50s: in the stock market because you see you
3420.78s: see the potential what you're what
3423.18s: you're missing is the risk the risk is
3425.82s: bigger than the potential and you better
3427.50s: understand the risk before you go in
3429.66s: yeah what I tell people is if you trade
3431.88s: options compared to equities and
3433.26s: equities you got to get one thing
3434.46s: correct direction and options you got to
3436.44s: get three things correct direction time
3438.78s: frame volatility so you've just added a
3441.00s: ton of complexity to that same
3442.38s: assumption yeah I would say 90 of people
3445.26s: play an option shouldn't be there that's
3447.24s: you know based on what I see in in the
3450.54s: tweets and stuff I see I just think so
3453.06s: many people are over their heads you
3454.68s: know
3455.58s: um and then and then they can't look in
3457.38s: the mirror and blame themselves they
3458.82s: gotta look for some some skip go you
3461.16s: know it's got to be somebody else that's
3462.54s: caused them to lose their money of
3465.36s: course it's that's the best thing is
3467.28s: never your fault right right right
3471.30s: so awesome David yeah thank you for
