0.64s: what's up outliers today's video is
2.32s: going to be talking about the covered
4.00s: strangle in GameStop this is actually
5.76s: going to be a practical application I've
8.24s: taken part of my Holdings in GameStop
11.72s: and I am turning it into an example for
15.36s: us to follow so a while ago during a
18.68s: live stream we took a look at GameStop
21.08s: together Saturday live stream and I
22.64s: asked what is the average holding size
26.08s: for GameStop and I look through the chat
29.40s: and I picked a regularly occurring
32.36s: number or range within there and what I
35.44s: did was take a portion of my GameStop
37.80s: Holdings and I'm tracking them
40.52s: disparately from the rest of the
42.04s: portfolio and I'm going to show you how
46.04s: we can trade something I can trade
49.24s: something specifically like the covered
51.60s: strangle in GameStop which is one of my
54.68s: staple option strategies there's a very
58.48s: specific use case in Gam stop that
61.04s: applies beautifully but first let's
64.40s: start with a quick recap of what the
67.32s: coverage strangle is now I have a couple
69.52s: videos I have an entire playlist
71.12s: actually about this specific strategy
73.52s: because it's one that I use a lot so I'm
76.24s: going to link to those in the notes
78.60s: below for your viewing pleasure if you
81.40s: want to get a little further into detail
82.92s: but I'm going to give you a quick
84.24s: overview of what the coverage strangle
86.88s: is and then why this fits so well with
91.08s: something like GameStop so first things
93.00s: first what is the coverage triangle as
94.88s: you could tell by my very neat
97.00s: handwriting it
98.84s: is long shares plus cash secured puts
103.96s: short puts plus ratio short calls
108.16s: against the long shares so let's take a
111.16s: look at what this actually looks like
112.64s: and if you can't tell what these are
113.96s: these are the risk profiles this shows
116.36s: you what which what each of these
119.96s: individual positions looks like and then
123.80s: I will show you what the composite looks
125.88s: like so I have this pulled up in my pass
129.08s: through IRA account so I'm recreating
131.60s: the position here with the current basis
135.44s: that I have for these different things
136.88s: so the the position itself is already on
139.44s: now at the end of this video I actually
142.24s: want you to comment what allocation you
146.44s: think I should use for this example my
149.08s: game plan is to run this example at
150.84s: least for a quarter and do like a weekly
153.28s: update about it could go longer it's
155.76s: however long we decide that it's
157.56s: interesting now to that note I'm
160.28s: specifically trying to pick an amount of
162.52s: money for the allocation that is
165.44s: applicable to as many people as I
167.72s: possibly can it's why I picked so far a
170.32s: very small amount of money but we can
173.16s: modify it to be whatever we would like
175.16s: it to be now for me as I've already
179.00s: explained GameStop St is a very small
181.12s: part of my portfolio and the main reason
184.76s: why I started holding the shares like
186.72s: specifically holding the GameStop shares
189.40s: was really just to participate and to
191.68s: show some love for what the apes are
193.92s: doing because I still very much consider
196.04s: myself a guest but I'm a fan so I like
199.72s: to try to support where I can now what I
203.56s: did was pick an amount of money
207.28s: $115,000 is what I'm using right now and
210.04s: that's based on that live stream and I
213.12s: pulled some of my shares over and I'm
216.80s: tracking them and I'll show you how I'm
218.16s: tracking them and then I have the rest
220.96s: of the options positions on on top of it
223.28s: so we're starting with 200 shares of
225.84s: GameStop at a basis of
227.84s: 2431 I actually have a much better basis
230.80s: than this however I picked a bit of a
234.68s: midpoint on the chart so that I can
238.56s: track essentially from the period of
241.28s: somebody scaling in during this up move
245.44s: come taking us back to towards the
248.08s: beginning of November so that's where
249.76s: that basis comes from now if we go back
254.84s: to this tab this is what long shares
258.72s: look it's essentially a positive sloping
262.32s: line that moves one for one dollar for
264.44s: dooll with the underlying so pretty
266.40s: straightforward now if I show you the
269.76s: the short put component by itself you'll
272.80s: see that it has capped profit potential
275.40s: uncapped risk to the downside same thing
278.36s: with the other put when you overlay the
280.08s: two different puts it develops a
281.84s: slightly curved line because of the
283.24s: different expirations and the different
285.00s: strikes but it's essentially the same
287.20s: tapped profit potential undefined risk
290.16s: to the downside then if we add short
292.60s: calls by themselves you'll see that we
294.60s: have risk to the upside and defined
297.52s: profit to the downside
299.84s: Now The Ensemble of all of these put
302.88s: together is very purposeful so the basis
305.80s: for the coverage triangle with respect
307.68s: to what we're doing here is very
309.92s: specific to those that are holding
313.12s: shares of GameStop already that just
315.80s: want to hold the stock and the way that
318.76s: I look at trading the coverage strangle
321.20s: is for those kinds of people that would
323.92s: like to hold the stock anyways it is a
327.68s: method to make a little bit more money
331.08s: on something that you're going to hold
334.24s: anyways so we start with our 200 shares
338.84s: we layer on that short call notice how
343.04s: it's only one short call against the 200
346.68s: shares this is for two primary reasons
350.44s: one it makes sure I do not have capped
353.68s: upside if I chose to exit the trade as a
358.00s: whole meaning I close the call call I
360.44s: close the shares at the same time exit
362.32s: the whole thing the other thing is it
364.64s: gives me more ability to manage these
367.32s: calls should they wind up in the money
370.00s: and that will be a further video for
372.52s: when it hopefully eventually happens and
375.00s: I can walk you through how I can avoid
378.24s: being assigned on these calls although
380.36s: it is always a risk which is why I keep
382.60s: it out of ratio because I don't actually
384.68s: want the shares to go away it's always a
387.64s: risk but we can do things to minimize it
390.40s: which again as we get into the
391.88s: management of the position and the
395.28s: strategy you'll see more of that and
397.84s: then we have additional short puts
401.32s: on Beyond just the long shares and
406.16s: there's a reason why these short puts
408.44s: work so well in something like GameStop
411.20s: so this is what the entire position
414.16s: looks like on a risk profile by itself
418.36s: pretty simple it maintains a upward
422.00s: sloping line so it still has unlimited
425.20s: profit potential and it
428.12s: maintains the downside cap is whatever
432.88s: we put into the trade essentially so
435.76s: it's planning for in the scenario of it
437.80s: going to zero this trade would lose
440.24s: 12,324 bucks something like that that's
442.48s: if GameStop went to zero which right now
444.56s: doesn't look like it's going to do so
447.24s: let's now take a look at what why the
450.12s: coverage strangle in GameStop well
452.52s: there's a few things that contribute
455.16s: really really well the way that I trade
457.92s: GameStop directionally is very different
460.20s: than what I'm showing you here again the
462.04s: coverage strangle in this context is
464.56s: designed for something that you would
466.84s: want to hold
468.68s: anyways now the way that I trade it when
472.44s: it's moving around a lot I'll use single
475.16s: options and trade the actual Direction
478.08s: the purpose of this strategy is to
481.32s: optimize an existing holding position of
485.68s: stock so the base position in the
488.04s: coverage triangle is long shares and
489.92s: then the options are just to amplify the
492.68s: position GameStop presents a really
496.08s: interesting opportunity because it's
497.96s: very very high
500.80s: volatility and the options positions
503.88s: that we use in this strategy are both
505.92s: short options positions so it means
508.72s: we're selling we're selling options in
511.76s: something that has very high volatility
514.16s: that means that you're going to make a
516.00s: lot more money on a relative basis
519.52s: compared to selling options on something
522.28s: with lower volatility you're also taking
524.52s: advantage of some structural components
527.48s: of volatility things like volatility
530.32s: risk premium vrp now that sounds a
534.00s: little heavy but it's a very simple
535.96s: concept if we take a look at this chart
538.48s: of GameStop you you'll notice this is
541.08s: volatility this yellow line is implied
543.60s: volatility for a 30-day time frame this
547.08s: gray line is one month Vault it's 21
550.52s: days technically but it's also one month
552.72s: Vol so both yellow and gray are one
555.72s: month volatility notice how in general
559.92s: implied volatility is higher than
562.96s: realized
564.36s: volatility in general when you sell
567.96s: options you capture some of this
571.04s: depending on how you structure the trade
572.56s: and manage it but in general when you're
576.12s: selling options if implied volatility
578.92s: remains elevated it means that you are
581.56s: collecting more premium than the
584.80s: underlying is actually moving so there's
587.80s: an edge baked into this from the options
592.04s: perspective which is why something like
595.04s: GameStop is so advantageous it has 110%
598.92s: IV that's for a 30-day time frame the
602.20s: implied volatility percentile is 53% so
604.96s: it's very very high volatility and for
607.44s: comparison if this doesn't make a lot of
609.20s: sense to you let's take a look at Apple
611.08s: AAPL Apple has
613.16s: 26.6%
614.68s: Vault this is a
617.44s: 68% implied volatility percentile
620.44s: implied volatility percentile is a
622.32s: really simple metric that plots all of
625.24s: the previous for the last year implied
627.68s: volatility numbers against the current
630.08s: implied volatility and this simply tells
632.64s: you that the current level of V is
636.28s: higher than 68% of the time mean it's
639.08s: very high so then if we go to GameStop
641.68s: by comparison it's almost quadruple plus
646.32s: the volatility from on average right now
649.96s: V is actually a little bit low in here
652.32s: but it's 110% V compared to 25% V and
657.32s: notice how implied volatility percentile
659.40s: is lower even though this is so much
661.48s: higher than Apple it means that on an
664.48s: average basis GameStop is way more
668.84s: volatile so you can capture that via
671.76s: short options now there's another great
674.80s: benefit to trading the coverage
677.32s: strangle on something like GameStop and
680.64s: it's because of this short call
682.72s: component and I'll explain why typically
685.68s: speaking when we are selling options
689.44s: options most often will exhibit what is
692.04s: called put skew that means that the puts
695.52s: are priced more richly compared to the
700.48s: corresponding out ofth money call so
703.24s: let's take a look and see if that's the
704.44s: case in apple actually don't know I
705.56s: haven't looked yet so a 29
709.92s: Delta put 36 days out the volum here is
715.68s: 26.9% 26.99% call it 27 that's that's
719.36s: for the 29 Delta there's no 29 Delta
722.56s: call there's a 31 so let's see what the
724.44s: 31 is the 31 is
726.84s: 23.75 so even though this is an even
730.72s: higher
731.92s: Delta notice that this volatility is
736.00s: much higher on the put side than the
737.44s: call side that is because the market
739.72s: tends to price puts more
742.92s: expensively than calls and that's
744.96s: because the markets tend to crash down
747.92s: and they kind of slowly go up saying is
750.44s: elevator down there's up okay let's take
754.60s: a look at GameStop now before we do that
756.72s: let's just mentally note what the
758.40s: difference is this is in terms of V
762.24s: 23.7 against 27 so about four points is
768.04s: so now let's take a look at
769.96s: GameStop and let's do the same thing
771.88s: around a 30 Delta so I see a 29 Delta
774.32s: here these are running an
777.44s: 87.2% V is at a 29 Delta see if we can
780.80s: find a 29 on this side 29 Delta on this
783.72s: side
785.48s: is 143
789.64s: 37% notice how psychotically high that
793.64s: is compared to the same put and notice
797.48s: how it's completely different than what
799.00s: I just showed you in apple and what you
801.04s: saw in apple is normal this is abnormal
805.00s: you do not see calls priced as richly as
808.64s: they are on a relative basis against
810.44s: puts in most tickers this is because the
813.64s: market fears the upside and GameStop and
815.76s: it's pricing those really big swings
817.88s: that it has so this goes all the way
821.00s: back to the opportunity because GameStop
824.52s: is high volatility you're going to
825.84s: benefit on the short puts because
829.00s: GameStop uniquely has exceedingly High
832.72s: volatility on the call side rather than
835.84s: what you typically get in the coverage
837.16s: strangle and like an index ETF the calls
839.80s: don't really help you that much because
842.12s: you collect a little bit on them but
843.96s: there's not a lot of v in them on a
845.64s: relative basis to the puts and GameStop
847.52s: it's the opposite you make a lot of
850.00s: money on a relative basis by selling the
853.12s: calls so this is a really lucrative
855.92s: selling position that again is based on
859.76s: the premise that we just want to hold
861.32s: the stock
862.52s: anyways because the short puts are cash
866.88s: secured so what this means is if the
870.00s: stock expires below my strike on the
873.64s: puts there are things we can do to
875.56s: manage to avoid getting a sign there we
877.56s: can roll out roll out and down which
879.44s: we'll probably do all of that at some
881.52s: point but you want to own the stock
885.12s: anyways and this isn't like The
887.04s: Superficial people that sell a put and
890.28s: they collect the premium and they say oh
891.96s: I want to buy the stock anyways and then
893.68s: the stock plummets and they're like wait
895.28s: a minute I don't actually want the stock
897.32s: it's I'm beyond that I've thought
900.04s: through that enough I've seen enough of
901.64s: these cycles that when I'm selling these
903.68s: puts at spots that I actually would want
906.48s: to be assigned I'm selling them pretty
908.12s: aggressively closer to at the money
911.64s: so that's why it's something that you
913.96s: want to hold anyways the difference is
917.68s: let's say we're using a $115,000
919.88s: position rather than going into the long
922.56s: shares in just buying all $115,000
925.96s: worth we maybe do a little bit less
928.96s: maybe $10,000 Worth or less than that
931.84s: and then get the rest via those short
933.60s: puts so that you can capture some of
935.64s: that premium
937.72s: particularly when the underlying is
940.36s: doing stuff like this kind of trending
942.16s: sideways or even coming down a little
943.68s: bit so let's talk about the management
946.40s: plan the risk in my GameStop coverage
950.28s: triangle is defined by its size the
952.60s: allocation that means that I would be
955.76s: completely okay and comfortable if
957.52s: GameStop went to zero meaning my entire
959.84s: investment is lost that's not the
962.28s: standard for most of what I trade most
964.72s: of what I trade is way more actively
966.96s: managed with stops and things like that
970.24s: but I'm using my allocation as my risk
974.52s: management approach and that is because
977.36s: I know GameStop can go through prolonged
980.52s: periods where it kind of just Trends
982.40s: sideways goes down a little bit and
984.72s: those can actually be really great
985.96s: accumulation phases so my risk risk is
989.40s: defined by the allocation again not my
991.72s: normal but when I'm trading the coverage
993.56s: strangle that's generally the case now
995.92s: if I'm trading the cover strangle on
997.36s: something like a leveraged ETF I
999.28s: normally apply some sort of trend
1000.64s: following different
1002.24s: scenario so that's the risk management
1005.16s: perspective now I do not intend to
1008.24s: unwind the shares unless we're in the
1011.24s: process of a squeeze and I would Define
1015.20s: that as any sort of movement similar to
1018.44s: this where we're seeing volume jacking
1021.80s: we're seeing price double triple Plus at
1025.20s: least doubling so that means from
1027.24s: current steady state right now I
1028.84s: wouldn't unwind any shares until it is
1032.12s: at least above 50 probably closer to 60
1035.92s: and the share unwind in that instance is
1039.72s: not to get out of the stock it's to
1042.40s: realize a profit to make more money to
1045.12s: then sell more puts and buy more stock
1048.36s: that's the Bey of the strategy so it's
1050.88s: opportunistic upside unwinds to realize
1054.16s: the gain so that I can then use the
1056.40s: money to buy more when it comes
1059.24s: down because as we know from squeezes
1062.48s: they're shortterm they don't last
1064.04s: forever they actually typically last
1066.00s: fairly briefly so what I'm doing is I'm
1068.84s: setting targets based on double current
1072.28s: price so double current price starts to
1075.04s: open unwind potential for the
1077.60s: shares so so that's the upside now the
1081.88s: next management component is how I'm how
1083.96s: am I deciding between selling puts
1085.56s: versus buying shares and it's by Price
1088.44s: Direction and standard analysis if I see
1091.68s: price doing what it's doing now trending
1093.60s: sideways this period in here is via
1096.20s: short puts then if we had a period like
1100.04s: this where it's more aggressively Rising
1102.44s: I would take some of the short puts in
1105.16s: and buy the shares outright because I
1107.48s: will make more money on the move as it
1109.44s: goes so the goal for the strategy is to
1114.08s: remain pretty much always at least 70%
1116.88s: invested if not more and depending on
1120.80s: what the stock is doing it will e and
1122.76s: flow how much of that is going to be in
1124.84s: shares outright versus cash secured puts
1127.68s: but there will always be both okay so
1131.36s: now let's take a look at the actual
1134.52s: positions as they are as I've pulled
1136.60s: them over so I started doing this on the
1142.52s: 8th of November is when I marked the
1144.96s: shares that I took over from the other
1147.48s: part of the portfolio wasn't really
1150.12s: trading the coverage strangle in it then
1152.00s: as you could tell this is 8 November and
1153.52s: we don't actually start with the options
1155.36s: component for this example until mid
1157.88s: December but that's where we're picking
1159.72s: up from so and this is just to show you
1163.28s: an example um I intend to wipe the Slate
1166.20s: clean and start the year with just the
1169.68s: shares
1171.40s: so right now we have a $155,000
1175.52s: allocation and the current requirement
1178.44s: is 13k so we are 89%
1182.72s: utilized for the example period of where
1186.16s: I got in not where I started trading
1189.64s: options and actually trading the
1190.84s: coverage strangle which is 18 December
1193.20s: I'm using the price from here on 8
1196.56s: November from 8 November to current
1199.44s: GameStop has returned 26% the strategy
1202.40s: as it sits as I run it is returned
1206.28s: 29.2% so uh several Point variance over
1210.52s: this and I have realized gains as part
1212.88s: of what I'm doing and again I want to
1215.04s: drive home the point that I'm using this
1218.12s: start date of 8 November but I didn't
1219.76s: start the options component until a
1221.60s: month and a half later so this would be
1223.60s: much better off if I used the comparison
1226.20s: from 18 December to now but I'm using
1229.20s: from when I got the shares so I've had a
1231.96s: couple uh short puts that have come down
1234.56s: for super cheap nothing really to write
1236.64s: home about and from the call side we
1239.48s: still have the initial offering that's
1241.88s: set out at the 35s so this is what the
1245.24s: position looks like now and this is what
1248.52s: I will show you as we move forward and
1252.32s: as we continue to manage and work around
1255.08s: the position I will be managing all of
1257.56s: these as I would any other trade again
1260.96s: we have 200 shares at
1262.60s: 2431 and we have two contracts of the 21
1266.20s: FB 28s we have one contract of the 24
1268.56s: Jan 29s here and then we have one
1271.16s: contract of the 17 Jan 35s so that's
1274.72s: what it sits as today and then like I
1276.40s: said going forward I will give you
1278.12s: weekly updates on this what's happening
1280.36s: how it's going management all that kind
1282.52s: of stuff the last thing I need from you
1284.96s: though is I need you to let me know in
1286.76s: the comments is how much money do we
1289.08s: want to use for the allocation I can
1290.64s: pair this down I can scale this up I
1294.20s: want to drive home the point I don't
1296.60s: want to just do whatever number you guys
1299.56s: think would be cool I want to
1301.92s: specifically pick a number that is
1304.16s: Meaningful to you so if you have a
1306.56s: smaller account I want this to be
1308.60s: relevant to you so that you have an
1310.44s: example of what this can look like for a
1314.60s: very basic strategy in something like
1319.80s: GameStop so I realized that these are
1323.44s: these need to be 24 instead of 25 those
1326.08s: were all messed up so that's the game
1328.16s: plan let me know in the comments what
1329.92s: you think we should do what's most
1332.32s: relevant to you and then we will see
1335.24s: what we can do if you have any questions
1337.08s: let me know be an outlier I'll see you
1338.88s: later
