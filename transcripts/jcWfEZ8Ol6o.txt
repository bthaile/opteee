399.00s: four
400.00s: five
416.00s: five
418.00s: What is 5 p.m.?
418.84s: When is evening?
420.20s: Is evening like six or seven?
422.72s: I don't know whether or not I tell you
424.44s: that it's a lovely afternoon or if it's a lovely evening.
427.92s: And I'm really hung up on that at the moment.
430.60s: So anybody that could send help, that would be great.
434.40s: Corey says seven.
435.40s: So seven we call evening, okay?
437.84s: So it's afternoon.
440.96s: So happy on this beautiful afternoon.
445.28s: We have, let's say hello to everybody.
447.56s: So we got roaring titty, the crowd favorite.
449.88s: Great to see you, roaring titty.
451.76s: We got Corey, Jimmy, Oli, and we have that Lauren, Paulo.
460.64s: Great to see everybody.
462.96s: Oli poppins says afternoon is still correct.
466.04s: Yeah, I feel like, I don't know, five, six starts to feel like evening to me,
470.60s: but I don't know what the actual cutoff is.
473.36s: This is one of those things where I feel like I have an idea of how it goes
476.68s: and then clearly I have no idea how it goes.
479.88s: So I'm going to do the logical thing.
483.00s: I'm going to ask chat GPT.
484.44s: What time is considered after noon and then evening?
495.68s: Let's see.
497.04s: Then we got Jonathan from North Carolina.
499.36s: I have a buddy out there.
502.36s: I actually think he just recently moved,
504.28s: but it was a in Ashburn.
506.24s: I think it was called from not mistaken.
508.24s: That's in North Carolina in it.
515.24s: Vladimir says sunset.
517.04s: I think sunsets legit.
520.48s: Okay.
521.12s: So chat GPT says afternoon typically begins at 12.
525.20s: Yeah, that's easy.
526.40s: In lasts until around five or six p.m.
529.48s: The exact transition can vary slightly based on regional customs or personal preferences.
534.08s: But afternoon generally refers to the period when the sun is still high in the sky after lunchtime.
539.52s: Yeah.
539.76s: Okay.
540.76s: Evening starts around five or six and lasts until nine or just after sunset.
546.40s: Evening marks the transition period from day to night when activities are winding down.
550.16s: Sun begins to set.
551.44s: Well, little, little did I know, little did you know that if you work in the military
558.76s: when it's dark out, that's actually when activities typically just start.
563.12s: So by that definition evening never happens because that talks about activities winding down.
568.80s: That's just when the fun begins because most of the people that we currently will use to decide to fight.
575.68s: Don't have fucking night vision.
577.00s: So it makes those kinds of interactions pretty one sided TBH.
586.12s: But okay.
588.16s: So let us start with the market.
593.28s: That's what I wanted to start with.
594.88s: So this week again, I'm just going to essentially pick up where we left off from yesterday.
600.36s: So I am not going to talk about all the market relationships and all that kind of stuff.
605.84s: I just really want to talk about the follow through today just because for anybody that's
611.16s: interested in like the current market analysis, it's all bullshit anyways.
614.88s: Right?
615.88s: It's just making guesses at shit.
617.32s: But the thing that I do want to talk about are just the data pieces that came out because
624.04s: those actually like genuinely do matter to us.
626.84s: So let's grab our friends over at Benzinga.
631.64s: I'm going to change this setup here just a little bit because I don't really care about
638.16s: the period.
639.16s: I care about the actual.
641.04s: I care about the consensus and I care about prior.
646.60s: That's what I care about the rest of that stuff is all just not.
651.24s: Okay.
652.72s: So we had PPI and PPI came in.
658.76s: Is that right?
659.76s: Did PPI come in flat month over month?
661.80s: Is that correct?
667.28s: I have to double check that.
669.04s: I haven't looked yet.
670.52s: But PPI flat, that's interesting.
673.64s: But that is the case.
675.64s: Let's see.
678.44s: Let's fact check this shall we?
687.56s: So this is telling me what's today.
691.44s: It's already fell off there.
692.60s: See that's the one problem with financial juice is that I like financial juice a lot.
699.88s: This is another economic website that I use.
702.36s: I'm not affiliated with them.
703.36s: I used to be, but I'm not anymore.
706.48s: It's just like literally lapsed.
708.64s: It's not because of any bad blood or didn't like their tool anymore.
712.92s: But one of the issues I have with it is that like it goes away too fast, right?
718.20s: It's 1700 Pacific time.
720.88s: I would love to be able to go back even to see the whole week to be honest with you.
725.32s: Not even just the today.
728.88s: So that's one of the problems with that in my opinion, but let's see.
733.20s: PPI month over month.
738.88s: And let's see what it is.
740.52s: Yeah, okay.
741.52s: So zero zero percent.
743.08s: Okay.
745.08s: So it's accurate.
746.40s: I just again, you guys have seen on these streams multiple times now where I look at
750.20s: something and then I find out it's inaccurate to some degree.
756.16s: So I double check just about everything, even if it, especially if it's something that
761.16s: I don't fully trust in its entirety and I have any inkling that it might be slightly
767.96s: off, then I'm going to double check it.
770.48s: So so yeah, PPI came in zero percent, which was expected at 0.1 percent growth.
778.44s: I don't, we have to look at that a little bit.
780.36s: So I'm actually not positive what I think about that.
785.00s: Let's check out why charts.
790.56s: Yeah, so that's about like flat flat.
797.64s: I can't go back 10 years.
803.20s: Am you.
808.32s: I don't know.
810.56s: Vladimir says it's 2024, facts don't matter anymore, just make shit up.
816.92s: I forgot, that's it.
818.48s: No wonder why that trading is going so well for me lately because it's, it's just a matter
824.56s: of making it up and then off Putin actually to double off of that.
829.48s: One of the things I've learned that I really, really hate massively is the idea of manifesting.
835.36s: I have no problem with visualization and I'm sure that that is very close to manifesting.
840.08s: When I talk about manifesting, I talk about the near term version of that or I guess
844.72s: like the more colloquial version where it's like we just kind of like think and think
848.64s: about something that might happen and we think that the process of thinking about it is
853.40s: enough and obviously it's not.
856.44s: So yeah, so there's, it's, we can just manifest what we want to happen in the trading accounts
862.92s: and then it just happens.
864.88s: So we therefore just get to make shit up.
867.64s: Yeah, I love that.
869.24s: Mr. off Putin, I think that's spot on.
872.60s: But yeah, okay, so this has been pretty, pretty flat for a little while now and let's
878.40s: take a look actually from BLS.
883.52s: So goods is contracted and services expanded slightly.
896.08s: Interesting.
898.36s: So PPI for final demand unchanged in September, services rise, .02, goods .02.
904.84s: Let's see.
908.32s: And next for final demand rose 1.8%.
926.64s: So this, I'm not going to lie, this is a little interesting to me like this came in slightly
930.76s: different than expected.
932.60s: I had expected slight contraction, but I didn't expect it to be quite like this.
940.52s: So most of September decrease in prices for unprocessed goods for intermediate demand can
945.56s: be traced back to crude petroleum, which fell 16.7%.
950.32s: So that's, that's interesting because production is still pretty high there.
954.36s: Prices for ungraded chicken eggs have to be honest.
958.80s: And you have to ask the question, why are we tracking ungraded versus graded?
963.88s: That I don't totally get slaughter steers, heifers, coal, fresh veggies, except potatoes,
970.44s: recycle paper, moved down index for slaughter poultry moved up 5.8%.
976.04s: Yes, he like, this is, this is the interesting thing as they see it is that like there's
979.96s: still lots of different pockets of movement that is different than I expected.
987.76s: Very much so.
990.28s: So Jonathan said recent videos with PB and Lauer or bangers, I'm glad.
996.08s: It's actually funny because there's somebody hold on a second, I have to show you in the
999.36s: comments.
1002.80s: Is this.
1003.80s: Oh, it looks like two people.
1009.48s: Not going to lie.
1011.16s: Seems sus because both of these comments came in at like the same time.
1015.96s: Let me show you this.
1017.00s: It's kind of funny.
1019.16s: So for those that liked the podcast that I did both with PB and Lauer, let me show you
1027.12s: in alternative view, which is our friend, um, cilantro team who is letting me know that
1039.20s: I'm a shell, which I'm very, very thankful for.
1042.44s: And then active rehab mobility, which I have to be honest, I'm a little upset at this
1047.76s: one because right now I am literally trying to actively rehab my mobility.
1056.24s: And it sucks that the person that it seems like they could help me with that.
1060.16s: They're also, um, calling me out, well, asking if I'm a shell.
1067.40s: Which obviously I would just answer them, right?
1070.32s: Because they should know it's only fair for me to come clean since they peg me down.
1075.72s: I think what I need to do is actually define shell.
1081.52s: Because I think that this is probably one of the most crazy misuse terms now.
1087.36s: Yeah, that's what I thought.
1098.32s: The shell is someone who promotes or endorses a product service or cause in a deceptive
1103.00s: or dishonest manner.
1107.44s: Interesting.
1108.44s: Okay.
1109.64s: Well, we just have to let rehab mobility and cilantro team.
1116.72s: The other thing that I can't help but find kind of interesting is this.
1123.04s: It looks like they, here's my guess genuinely.
1126.88s: And this is the funny thing about people.
1129.48s: These comments came in at like the same time.
1131.84s: So my guess is this one came in.
1133.84s: Same time is this one.
1134.84s: I think this is the same person.
1136.80s: And I literally think this person wanted to respond to this person, but forgot to switch
1141.80s: their fucking account.
1143.52s: That's my guess.
1144.52s: I have nothing to validate any of that.
1147.08s: But I just think it's hilarious.
1149.48s: I literally think it's hilarious if that is the case.
1152.28s: That's my favorite.
1153.48s: So shout out to these guys.
1156.04s: You should definitely pop over to the YouTube channel, give them a sub just because I mean,
1160.60s: this guy's ready.
1161.60s: They're starting to build their audience, right?
1163.28s: They're rolling in deep.
1165.00s: So shout out to them.
1167.44s: Polarious.
1168.44s: All right.
1169.44s: Back to this though.
1178.16s: That Lauren says heffers.
1179.16s: Yeah, man.
1180.16s: I know it's like one of those words that it's weird to hear used.
1183.08s: But yeah, that's a fucking word now.
1186.56s: Rantid he says graded or probably processed and ready for sale unprocessed.
1191.28s: Probably have been collected but not checked for suitability for sale yet.
1196.24s: Interesting.
1197.24s: So graded is the idea.
1200.12s: So grading is just applied to whether or not it's processed.
1204.00s: Rantid, are you guessing or are you telling me because I don't know.
1208.68s: That sounds legit.
1211.44s: But if you tell me that, I would believe you, if you're guessing, we can check it.
1215.32s: Because I don't know the difference.
1216.96s: What's the difference between graded and ungraded chicken eggs?
1227.56s: This is admittedly one of genuinely one of my favorite parts about markets is right now.
1235.56s: I'm in the process of learning about chicken egg grading.
1241.52s: One of the coolest things that you'll find as a trader or investor in the markets is
1247.08s: that it is one of the most interesting lenses to learn about the world.
1252.20s: And you will learn about so fucking much.
1255.96s: It'll make your head spin.
1257.76s: Okay.
1259.92s: So graded eggs are, they go through a quality inspection process where they assessed for
1268.08s: external and internal factors.
1270.84s: Shells quality, yolk, and albuming condition.
1274.56s: So there's grade AA, grade A, grade B. And ungraded eggs have no official inspection.
1284.00s: They're not inspected or rated according to quality.
1287.64s: This happens with farm, fresh, or backyard eggs sold at local markets or directly from
1293.24s: farms.
1294.64s: So I think the main thing is you actually like farm, fresh eggs then would still be sold.
1305.36s: But they're just, they don't go through an inspection process.
1308.72s: So rowing titty to your point, that would lead me to believe that if you're getting your
1316.48s: farm fresh eggs, there's a chance you might get a little more protein in it.
1319.40s: There's a little baby chicken in there might have a crunch.
1321.44s: You know what I mean?
1330.60s: That's what it looks like.
1331.60s: Interesting.
1332.60s: And there's those three grades AA and B. I don't know why it has, like why?
1339.36s: Who invented that?
1342.52s: I don't actually get it because why couldn't it just be ABC?
1347.48s: Like that's a pretty standard fucking thing.
1355.56s: Interesting.
1357.48s: All Putin says why do they refrigerate eggs in the US, but almost nowhere else in the
1360.88s: world?
1361.88s: That's due to the washing process.
1363.52s: So there's a, this is actually funny that I know this.
1367.64s: There's an outer part of the egg called acutical, like the cuticle of your nail.
1372.24s: And that washing process strips the cuticle away.
1375.76s: So when that cuticle is stripped away, then the egg is more prone to decaying salmonella,
1382.12s: bacterial and stuff like that.
1384.16s: So off Putin, that's why we refrigerate eggs in the US is because ours are inspected
1391.24s: washed a certain way.
1393.12s: And once you go through that washing, it strips away the cuticle.
1400.96s: That's, I don't, I don't know.
1403.16s: Like I'm kind of thinking about what the fuck I'm talking about and thinking how useless
1406.52s: of a data point that is like think of, think of a good piece of information that I could
1412.16s: have just remembered right then instead of understanding the fucking cuticle of an egg.
1418.56s: Not my proudest moment, but yeah, okay.
1422.80s: Don't feel a little weird about it.
1425.40s: Oh, see, Paulo has it.
1426.64s: I didn't notice.
1427.48s: Yeah, okay, good.
1428.92s: I didn't read the comments.
1430.48s: So Paulo, you're also a fucking nerd.
1435.36s: I love that.
1438.24s: Off Putin says my guess is that a little poop is gross to Americans.
1444.04s: Have to be honest.
1446.28s: I hope it is to you as well.
1448.40s: This standard sanitation, like especially on something that I intend to consume, I would
1455.84s: prefer it to be fecal free as it were.
1458.72s: I don't know maybe if we need to like start a movement for Putin, wherever you're from,
1464.80s: but something like fecal free would be okay, something like that.
1472.00s: But yeah, you that's, I think that should be a universal thing that we that we are generally
1478.36s: concerned with at least to a degree in my humble opinion.
1482.52s: All right.
1485.00s: So the last thing I want to talk about from a market perspective is let's take a look
1490.44s: at the the grid here.
1492.28s: One of the things that I started noticing is that this is using ADR, this here.
1501.80s: So if we take a look at IWM, let me blow it up a little bit here.
1508.84s: Big, big, big, big, big breakout.
1512.76s: You have seen this on my chart for some time now.
1516.12s: So this is something from, I actually don't remember when I drew this, but if we go back
1523.08s: far enough, we can see when I first started drawing this channel, but a massive breakout
1529.32s: from this channel.
1530.80s: Now the reason why this is interesting to me is because this is one of the most quintessential
1536.84s: breakout patterns that you can absolutely trade.
1539.24s: I traded just the move today.
1540.72s: I used futures.
1542.12s: It was an intraday trade.
1543.64s: I still have about two thirds of the position on, but this is something that I talked about
1550.44s: not too long ago yesterday.
1551.96s: I talked about another trade that exhibit similar tendencies to this kind of style of
1556.68s: setup, but this is a standard breakout play.
1559.64s: So the profit mechanism, as I look at something like this, is velocity.
1568.44s: It's something that starts to get really, really constrained in price, and then sooner or
1573.32s: later, it makes a big decision.
1575.40s: And that's exactly what happened today.
1576.92s: I had a 2% day on the day for the index.
1580.20s: And as soon as I started seeing this move, this very one-sided candle, this led to a series
1586.52s: of other trades.
1588.24s: And I'll show you, because if you go into the heat map, you go within the Russell, take
1595.80s: a look at where you see super bright green.
1602.12s: You can see this happen right on the day.
1604.88s: The other thing that we should take a look at for something like this is where you see
1608.76s: red.
1610.00s: The reason why it matters to look for red on days like today is because it's giving
1615.40s: you views on stocks that are clearly bucking the broader trend.
1621.28s: So by looking at a heat map like this, we get to do two things.
1625.76s: The first thing we get to do is find leaders that are driving price performance.
1632.16s: The second thing you get to do is find weak stocks that are slowing or moving against
1640.52s: the broader trend, despite the amount of support that there is for the movement.
1646.12s: Because the other thing I want you to notice is take a look at the individual sectors.
1652.60s: Do you notice anything interesting about the sectors in general?
1660.12s: Any guesses?
1661.88s: I want you to specifically focus on what the relationship looks like in terms of the
1668.36s: number of red that you see within the different sectors.
1677.24s: And then I'm updating the timestamps for whoever else ends up watching this in the future
1683.44s: so that they can skip past all the random bullshitting in the beginning.
1690.48s: There we go.
1696.00s: Corey says crypto huge exactly.
1701.96s: Rointit is says one sector has no red exactly that's exactly correct.
1706.48s: Joey says small amounts of red in each sector that's also correct.
1710.48s: So one thing to note is that financials that's this whole sector.
1714.64s: So there's definitely red in financials just to be clear.
1718.32s: These are just different kinds of reats and stuff like that.
1722.04s: But the main points is if we look at the performance of the sectors, this is literally the process
1730.12s: of being a trader is coming up with these broader themes that stick out to us from a macro
1736.48s: broader perspective, not macroeconomic macro market perspective and use it to define
1741.72s: ideas.
1742.96s: So one of the things you hide up you highlighted is financials.
1747.64s: Financials look super strong today.
1749.84s: Where's the weakness in financials?
1751.60s: In real estate, ABR, REIT, PMT, REIT to very much real estate heavy, MFA, REIT, RC, REIT,
1761.48s: you get the point, REITs are not doing great.
1765.60s: So when we look at financials in general, they're doing quite well.
1769.80s: If we take a look at something like information technology, you can see that there's a little
1774.88s: bit more of a mixed bag here.
1777.16s: We can see that there's some strong performers, but there's also kind of a mix of not super
1785.12s: strong performers and then some slightly negative performers.
1790.44s: Learning to look with a purpose is so important for your evolution as a trader.
1799.38s: When we look at stuff like this, we should not open up a heat map and think, oh, I
1807.12s: want to see if I can find blank, blank being whatever your preconceived notion might be.
1816.00s: What our objective is when we do this is to find tradable information.
1825.08s: Some of that tradable information is going to be indirect, meaning I might look at financials
1830.84s: and decide, okay, I'm going to trade financials.
1832.88s: That's direct.
1834.08s: Before I might look at financials in just mentally, note financials are strong, maybe
1838.40s: I'll scan and set up some alerts for financials, but maybe not place a trade right now.
1843.72s: That's indirect.
1845.52s: Both of those are completely useful data points for you to house in your brain and specifically
1852.28s: you're subconscious.
1854.16s: So the other thing, again, when you're looking at heat maps, we want to look at breath,
1858.14s: meaning across the board, what does the tenor look like?
1861.56s: And again, when we look at small caps, most of it's up.
1864.52s: How many of them are very bright green, meaning larger up moves?
1868.68s: A good bit of them.
1869.68s: If I were to eyeball this, I would guess maybe 15%, something like that, 20% if that.
1876.04s: How many of them are green compared to red?
1878.12s: It looks like a decent majority, probably 70, 75%.
1882.84s: So by just eyeballing this, I'm not taking the time to download all the information, to
1889.12s: run it through Python and see the individual details, although we can and there's different
1893.28s: ways to look at that.
1894.28s: I'm just eyeballing.
1896.56s: The other thing that I'll do, as I already mentioned, is I will look at what is showing
1901.68s: really great moves and I want to see why is it something that's pertaining to the entire
1907.64s: sector or is it something pertaining to the individual stock?
1911.68s: So for example, IT, MSTR, obviously it's 16% today.
1916.76s: This is very not representative of most of this sector.
1922.64s: Most of this sector is up, but it's not up huge like this.
1927.72s: So then we have to begs the question, what's going on with MSTR?
1931.04s: And we already know MSTR is full of idioms and credit risk.
1935.48s: So it's kind of like looking at a specific piece of the overall tech sector from the small
1941.36s: cap side of things.
1943.28s: This in my opinion is not indicative of all small caps and it's showing me that the
1948.64s: IT sector right now is being moved within small caps by something like this.
1956.72s: That's the idea.
1959.00s: So this is the way that we can use heat maps to come up with ideas.
1964.84s: All right, let me catch up on the chat.
1967.48s: James says M2K futures or something else.
1969.96s: I didn't use the minis because I wasn't building a position over time.
1974.60s: So I used RTY.
1979.48s: Referring to the Russell scalp today, and it's not a scalp to be clear, intraday trade.
1984.80s: I use scalp in the common parlance just because people will more accurately identify what
1992.92s: I mean by that.
1994.60s: So yeah, I just use Russell futures.
1996.92s: We got Joey.
1997.92s: Good to see you, Joey.
2000.92s: Paul says, what are those reds and industrials?
2003.16s: Yeah, let's take a look.
2004.84s: And that's a great thing to look for.
2007.00s: NVEE, EPF and rock.
2010.80s: Ooh, rock.
2011.80s: That's a fun one.
2012.80s: So let's take a look at these.
2019.56s: So we want to look at NVEE.
2022.48s: We had a split.
2026.80s: We have rock, gap down, EPF, massive gap down.
2036.20s: Looks like dividend.
2039.16s: CMRE, slowly rotating down, GNK, same, SB.
2052.04s: Same.
2053.96s: So the thing for me when I look at this structure within industrials is it's not exactly
2059.72s: where I necessarily want to fade.
2063.24s: So like this starts to look a little more interesting to me.
2067.16s: When I'm looking for sectors that I want to fade within, I'm going to look for stuff
2071.76s: that looks sad.
2073.40s: Consumer discretionary looks kind of sad.
2076.16s: Energy still looks a little bit sad.
2078.48s: Com services looks a little bit sad.
2080.76s: Let's take a look in consumer discretionary.
2083.28s: There's not a bunch of stuff that's making like crazy big down moves, but there's also
2087.04s: not a bunch of stuff making really big up moves.
2089.28s: So we can look for stuff that's making bigger moves like W.
2093.28s: Who here says W as W?
2097.28s: I mean, I don't even know what to do with that.
2104.88s: Other than nothing.
2106.76s: Jack, no, shack, D not.
2112.80s: If you got that reference that I just did, let me know.
2115.88s: F L.
2117.64s: Ooh, see like this I like this.
2120.80s: I like.
2123.40s: I love this.
2127.60s: Create an alert at or below.
2130.56s: If you fall below that, fade into oblivion.
2138.24s: That's the rule.
2141.24s: Sorry gang, the old up, the old sciatica.
2149.36s: Still still proven some problems here.
2153.04s: We're working through it, but it's slow as shit.
2156.96s: I have to be honest with you.
2160.08s: It is a much slower healing process than I would like to admit, but that's how she goes.
2169.32s: That Lawrence is why do you like it?
2170.80s: Well, let's talk about it.
2172.00s: What's everybody's opinion of it?
2173.96s: Give me in the chat.
2175.32s: It doesn't have to be like a massive word picture, but give me a couple things that you
2180.34s: see about the stock and what your disposition is towards the stock.
2186.32s: And then I'll explain to you why I like it.
2195.36s: This is the exact kind of thing you can already see that I set an alert.
2200.08s: This is how I trade in general is I use alerts all the time.
2206.04s: It's how I find stuff that looks interesting before it's actually doing the interesting
2212.88s: thing so that then I can try to get into it when it's doing the interesting thing.
2219.36s: Because otherwise that's one of the big issues that I see with people is that there's
2224.16s: a pretty significant gap in entry timing.
2230.24s: And I think that it's kind of a, actually a pretty profound problem if I think of it
2235.40s: from a slightly larger perspective.
2238.56s: So that's the idea behind this is to find things that are moving in a way that I can trade
2244.72s: them.
2246.12s: But before they make a move so I can set alerts so that then I can catch them.
2250.80s: For those that were on the live stream yesterday, I posted about this in the discord following
2254.44s: up with you all gold.
2256.92s: Gold last night while we were on that live stream kicked off an alert and I literally
2260.90s: stopped in the middle of the live stream to put on my position in gold.
2267.08s: And it's because I have an alert that sitting that then I can identify a move.
2276.52s: All right.
2278.72s: Paul says bearish.
2280.00s: Zach says downtrend higher highs and lows.
2282.84s: Yep.
2283.84s: So it's definitely breaking down.
2286.40s: Cedric says I would look for a bounce, but I know that is stupid.
2289.40s: Yeah, that is stupid.
2291.84s: That's not to say it's stupid in the fact that like it couldn't get a bounce.
2295.00s: It can get a bounce.
2296.96s: But it's stupid in the fact that that's applying a really, really, really broken down expectation
2306.28s: of price performance.
2308.28s: And that comes from the bargain buying side of a standard trader's brain.
2314.56s: A normal trader will think of things as being at extremes and then play contrarian because
2321.16s: we think it's gone too far, stuff like that, which yeah, typically isn't super favorable.
2326.76s: But that's not the case.
2331.08s: Reese says, hey, we still have eyesight.
2332.88s: Love that podcast and stoicism.
2334.40s: Oh, that's awesome.
2335.40s: I'm glad that that was good.
2337.40s: Kyle and I, we go back a while actually.
2339.88s: He's one of my, my, my better friends in the finance space.
2343.36s: You guys should definitely make sure you check his stuff out when you can because Kyle is
2348.44s: a relatively new trader himself.
2351.12s: But he's a prior Navy guy and he's just so unbelievably authentic and genuine in the
2357.60s: space that it's, it's just, it's why I draw it to him like a magnet.
2363.44s: He and I used to do a regular series on his podcast and then we did a series together
2368.40s: on my pot or it wasn't really a podcast.
2370.84s: It was just on my YouTube channel.
2371.96s: We did a bunch of things on my YouTube channel.
2373.80s: We did like a teaching options trade together.
2376.36s: When we used to do service reviews for different trading services and we would dig into those.
2382.40s: But yeah, Kyle, he's just a super genuine dude.
2384.88s: He's still figuring out his approach to trading and he's, he's just unbelievably honest in
2391.56s: a space that I think most people really, really struggle with being honest because a lot
2399.36s: of people aren't used to the idea of being like quote unquote, a knowledgeable authority
2404.24s: figure in something, but still acknowledging the fact that we don't know everything and
2409.92s: it's okay to not know shit.
2411.60s: I actually think it's important for people.
2413.56s: I go out of my way to show people when I don't know stuff all the time.
2417.40s: It's, it's, it's very purposeful because there's this really bad notion that if you develop
2423.60s: eminence in something, it means that you're infallible and know everything about it.
2429.28s: And I tell you, I tell you this all the time for, for context, right?
2433.48s: I started trading in 2007.
2435.80s: I've been in markets.
2436.80s: I'm coming up on my 17th year.
2438.64s: I typically track my hours per year.
2441.32s: I haven't finished up this year, but I'll probably be about like 33 to 34,000 hours analyzing
2447.60s: trading markets a lot of time.
2450.60s: And I still don't know a ton of shit and I want you to see that.
2456.64s: I want you to see that it's okay to not know.
2460.04s: It's okay to have experience in something and still not know details because again,
2467.56s: as soon as we can break that part away from our ego, the better off you are.
2473.28s: Because that's the only reason why I would go out of my way to pretend like I know everything
2479.16s: or that I always have everything under wraps because the entire concept about that is,
2486.36s: it's just so that people's perception of me isn't changed in some way, which is most
2492.44s: of you probably know at this point, like I generally don't give a fuck.
2496.64s: My, my, I am who I am, I am what I am.
2499.64s: So I, and I think it's important for people to see that because the aspiration of knowing
2504.76s: everything I think is completely flawed.
2507.12s: And when we look at mastery of markets, it comes from continually not knowing shit and
2512.16s: learning about it.
2513.56s: So Kyle is a fantastic representation of that because he spent a lot of time really trying
2519.84s: to learn this trading skill set like pretty massively and he's still so approachable and
2527.96s: he acknowledges his own fallibility all the time and it's rare to find really like authentic
2533.76s: people like that.
2535.16s: He does this stuff the same reason why I do this stuff is that he genuinely just fucking
2539.68s: loves markets.
2541.76s: He loves the process of trading and there's not a lot of people like that out there like
2546.12s: if you look at the trading space, it's generally especially like the bigger brands, it's what
2553.48s: you would expect.
2554.48s: It's people that are trying to make money explicitly off of their audience and I don't want to
2561.60s: say there's anything wrong with that.
2562.68s: There's nothing wrong with that.
2564.12s: It's okay if you're sharing your expertise learned over time if you are providing that
2570.16s: and there's an exchange.
2571.68s: That's how we do everything.
2573.12s: Right?
2574.12s: If I pay for somebody to come out and to do my roof, I expect to not just pay them for
2579.68s: the materials.
2581.20s: I expect to pay them for their time for their expertise, be able to do it faster than
2585.68s: I could do it.
2586.68s: Right?
2587.68s: So like there's no problem with people that are like that, you know, that are trying to
2590.80s: sell their stuff, whatever that is.
2592.84s: If it's a book that they have, whatever.
2594.84s: That's okay.
2595.84s: But there's a lot of predatory practices that prey on people's ignorance.
2601.32s: That's where it sucks.
2603.04s: Super, super bad.
2604.24s: And that's why I did that trading review thing for a little bit because when I did the
2609.36s: trading service reviews stuff, it wasn't to shame any individual service at all.
2616.00s: The whole idea actually was to just try and teach people how to evaluate a service for
2622.52s: themselves.
2623.52s: And that's the thing that I try to help with the trading side of things.
2626.12s: I'm not sitting here trying to show anybody what to trade, when to trade, nothing like
2629.52s: that.
2630.52s: The last possible thing I do, nothing I give is financial personalized financial advice.
2634.56s: I absolutely give financial advice with the context of telling people that saving is
2641.08s: good.
2642.08s: Like you should save your money, shit like that.
2644.52s: And that's still general advice.
2646.68s: And that's, I think, important to share with each other.
2650.12s: But like, personalized, I do none of that because the whole idea is to try to teach people
2654.52s: how to do this shit for themselves, which that's a tough gig.
2659.12s: A lot of people struggle to do something like trading by themselves.
2664.08s: And it takes time.
2665.36s: But unfortunately newer traders don't know what they don't know.
2668.36s: And they get sucked into one of these spheres that then just puts them through a series
2674.08s: of giving money away.
2675.32s: And I genuinely fucking hate that.
2676.72s: It drives me crazy.
2680.04s: I'm just really frustrated to see.
2684.40s: That Lauren says, I know a lot of stuff about hair.
2688.12s: Have been doing that for 26 years.
2689.64s: This stuff hurts my brain, but I'm learning.
2692.12s: Okay, Lauren, if you know shit, if you know stuff about hair, why does my hair grow at an
2699.20s: alarmingly annoying pace?
2703.72s: Because I hate getting a fucking haircut every week to two weeks.
2707.88s: It's super annoying.
2708.88s: And here's too long right now.
2709.88s: I don't like that.
2711.60s: So riddle me that Batman because I would love for that to chill the fuck out.
2719.72s: Vladimir's there is a question from Zach.
2721.92s: Okay.
2722.92s: Zach says stupid question.
2724.20s: How are you able to put on a position in gold after hours?
2726.68s: I only trade gold ETFs.
2728.12s: Yeah, they still trade.
2730.00s: So different futures markets will have different trading hours.
2733.08s: You can check with your broker.
2734.64s: So like for example, let me look at Schwab futures trading hours.
2740.92s: During the week, they close down for just a brief bit after the market closes and then
2745.84s: they open right back up.
2747.72s: So here you go.
2751.60s: Equity futures goes Sunday to Friday from 1800 to 1700.
2757.76s: So there's a one hour break between 1700 and 1800 Eastern time.
2764.12s: For commodities like crude oil gold, they go Sunday to Friday.
2769.24s: Overnight trading starts at 1800 on Sunday and continues until 1700 on Friday with the
2778.20s: one hour break from 1700 to 1800 each day.
2783.16s: And then treasury bonds.
2784.36s: This is for Schwab.
2786.84s: Same schedule essentially.
2789.12s: So that's one of the benefits of trading futures.
2791.92s: And that's actually another thing that I think a lot of traders don't fully pay attention
2798.68s: to.
2800.08s: And the reason for that is because if let's say you have a portfolio on and it's one of
2805.40s: the reasons why I'm more comfortable using leverage is because I can always track my
2810.28s: beta weighted portfolios and make adjustments.
2813.52s: So let's take a look at, you know, in Eric's special.
2819.96s: Well, you already know the next question.
2837.40s: It's probably the biggest question that we're going to cross together here.
2846.56s: You guys already know.
2849.96s: Oh shit, Rowan Titty.
2851.28s: Yeah, great call.
2854.32s: So I like this for a breakdown trade.
2857.40s: So when I look at the overall trend here on a six month chart, well, go out to a year
2862.48s: first on a year we had a high below lower high, right?
2867.64s: Like this really choppy choppy movement.
2871.44s: If I zoom in to a shorter term timeframe, we can see that it peaked up here, gap down
2878.28s: on earnings that wasn't well received.
2881.12s: It came in at negative five cents.
2882.92s: It was estimated at negative seven seven zero point seven or I'm sorry point zero seven
2888.04s: seven rally down, hit a low, rallyed up lower high, rally down lower low.
2895.36s: So now I like this just for a breakdown continuation.
2898.84s: That's all.
2900.08s: We can see that volatility in here is massive, right?
2902.88s: So if we look at a five day average ATR's 3.56%, 20 days 4.74% and then 90 days 5.46%.
2913.72s: So pretty, pretty significant overall volatility in here, something like this.
2919.88s: Paul says, would you take fundamentals into account in this FL trade?
2923.32s: No, not at all.
2925.48s: Fundamentals for me for the timeframe fundamentals for me matter.
2929.08s: If I'm trading something that's going to be like a year plus, which is about nothing.
2933.40s: So for me, fundamentals are generally just for context.
2937.48s: It's again, just because I'm genuinely interested.
2940.20s: So when I look at the earnings and I go through the earnings report, it's not to build up
2943.96s: some sort of big bear thesis thinking I'm going to find something in the earnings report
2947.80s: that other people didn't see and they're not pricing in because it doesn't matter, right?
2952.60s: When I look at the way markets move in different time frames, if you have a company that's showing
2958.32s: solid, fundamental performance and it's continuing to grow, meaning fundamentals are growing,
2963.88s: that means that the company is growing.
2965.24s: That's about all you need.
2966.92s: And that means for longer term holdings that the company is more likely to appreciate
2970.76s: and value than depreciate.
2973.20s: All context dependent from a trading perspective where my average holding time for stuff is
2978.80s: like a B six weeks and that's on the long side.
2982.84s: Most of my holdings for like the past two, three years have been less than two weeks.
2987.48s: So there's obviously a longer term holdings than that for sure, but I'm talking on
2992.60s: average across the majority of the trades.
2995.28s: So when I analyze this, the fundamentals are baked into the price.
3002.20s: That's what it boils down to.
3003.68s: The fundamentals as it sits today are baked into the price.
3007.88s: And the thing that's more important for this is when we have movement, that's what
3017.44s: I'm trading.
3019.00s: The reason for the movement is not predicated on the fundamentals quite literally at all.
3026.36s: So for example, some of the movement that we can see in footlocker over the last two
3032.76s: through two, three weeks, literally I don't know what's causing it.
3036.48s: Obviously it's going down.
3037.84s: So it tells me people are selling it.
3039.40s: Why they're selling it?
3040.92s: It doesn't ultimately matter to me other than I'm just curious about it and it does provide
3045.20s: a little bit of context for the move.
3047.60s: But the fundamentals themselves don't really matter in this circumstance because it
3053.68s: let's just say another scenario where it had really, really great fundamentals, fantastic
3060.04s: fundamentals.
3061.44s: And it looked like it was growing massively quarter over quarter year over year.
3066.44s: It's like it looks super good.
3068.76s: If it's going down, it's fucking going down.
3071.64s: Like that's it.
3072.64s: If it's going down because a big hedge fund doesn't want their position anymore, that's
3076.72s: why it's going down.
3078.04s: If it's going down because they got sued because their CEO did some shit that he's not supposed
3083.16s: to.
3084.16s: I'm not saying that that happened.
3085.16s: I don't think it did.
3086.16s: But that's why it's going down.
3087.92s: So from a trading perspective, we, the fundamentals largely are going to be priced in.
3095.12s: That's what typically has us about where we're at.
3098.36s: And then the broader market is going to respond to fundamentals differently depending on
3102.12s: their position durations because think of the average hedge fund or mutual fund or pension
3109.12s: fund.
3110.12s: They're not going to float in and out of the stuff like I would as a trader, the vast majority,
3115.72s: the vast majority of money moves very, very slow.
3118.40s: And it's because it takes time to broker a deal to get into a position, to scale into
3122.44s: the position at size.
3123.68s: Then to make sure that all your compliance is in place like all that stuff and then add
3128.16s: regulation on top of it means big money moves slow.
3131.96s: So because big money moves slow, that's why we see this kind of information in discreetness
3137.60s: where price takes time to move to different points.
3141.16s: And it's why we have things like underreaction and overreaction.
3144.84s: Those are tradable events in the market.
3147.72s: So all of that boils down to it doesn't fucking matter what anything is saying or going
3153.84s: on.
3154.84s: What matters is what price is doing.
3156.84s: That's it.
3157.84s: That is the only thing that matters to us as traders because I could fundamentally value
3166.08s: this company and it could go down easy.
3172.80s: Why would it go down?
3174.04s: Litany of factors.
3175.68s: So if we're building an investment thesis, that's completely different because in an investment
3183.40s: thesis, we're thinking shorter term positioning has to sort itself out.
3190.16s: And if I'm investing for a year plus, I don't care about this $10 move.
3195.12s: I really don't because as long as the fundamentals and the company is still growing and moving
3200.92s: in line with expectations on a longer term timeframe, which this is not, but let's pretend
3207.08s: it was going up and to the right.
3209.56s: That's a completely different story.
3210.76s: A good example of that is if we look at something like Nvidia and I'm using my little grip
3217.32s: tool.
3218.32s: So my hands are starting to slow down already.
3220.24s: So if we look at Nvidia and we look at like this period here, right?
3228.64s: Not a huge down move, but not insignificant.
3231.36s: And then it's kind of been trending sideways.
3233.12s: It hasn't hit new highs quite yet.
3235.76s: But I mean, like look at the movement.
3237.00s: It's absolutely beautiful.
3238.80s: It's slightly broken down, but it's still overall good where we had a high, we had a pullback,
3244.76s: a correction essentially posted a low ran up to a high posted a higher low trended sideways
3252.36s: posted a slightly lower high.
3254.60s: That's not a great look, but that happens sometimes trends down a little bit catches on
3259.64s: the MA starts to rally up and out.
3261.60s: And now it's moving closer to all time highs.
3265.92s: All of that is movement from a trading perspective that doesn't really matter for an investor.
3275.80s: Because if you look at this from an investment perspective, the answer is just buy.
3279.88s: You buy whenever you feel like it and you hold on to it because as long as it continues
3284.48s: to grow as it should, that's ultimately what matters.
3289.12s: So the biggest lesson from this entire section of the video is that you have to define
3295.56s: what kind of investment thesis you're applying and what's the corresponding time frame.
3302.00s: Because if I'm going to trade on something that I'm using a three year daily chart,
3305.80s: fundamentals matter guaranteed.
3307.84s: If I'm trading something where I'm looking at a three month chart, fundamentals do not
3312.40s: matter.
3313.40s: There's nothing about fundamentals that matter to me in this time frame.
3316.96s: So creating alignment between those is exceedingly important, I think.
3327.68s: All right.
3330.72s: Reese says I've spent so much time grasping options.
3333.56s: It seems like another world, but there are essentially options contracts, right?
3337.40s: Futures.
3338.40s: No.
3339.40s: Futures are different.
3340.40s: So futures are another type of derivative.
3343.16s: There's a bunch of different.
3344.12s: If you think of securities, I actually have a slide for this in Erick's, you already
3349.12s: know what it is.
3350.12s: Erick's handy, dandy, abomination of a slide deck.
3356.96s: Oh, yeah, this is an upcoming video I'm going to do.
3362.76s: But what am I looking for?
3366.32s: Markets.
3368.72s: Something like this is somewhere in here.
3372.44s: Where is it?
3374.72s: Here you go.
3377.72s: Here you go.
3380.72s: Securities.
3381.72s: So you can see within the basket of securities in the market, there are kind of a couple
3389.16s: big buckets.
3390.16s: There's actually a few more than this.
3392.24s: But inside of derivatives, there are options, futures, swaps, convertibles, there's
3403.20s: Bermudian, Bermudian options.
3407.72s: There's a lot of different kinds of derivatives that live in here.
3412.20s: So futures are a different kind of derivative than options.
3419.28s: They're very different.
3420.76s: And there's actually options on futures.
3424.96s: So there's a derivative on a derivative as well.
3432.76s: Roy and Titi says farmers use futures to sell their products.
3435.12s: They actually don't.
3437.08s: Yeah, they typically don't.
3440.20s: Farmers, the advent of futures was actually to essentially add stability to commodities
3446.40s: prices.
3447.92s: So essentially a futures contract is similar to option in that there's a contract between
3455.00s: two parties and it pertains to a specific asset for a time in the future.
3460.56s: And the general purpose is if I'm a farmer and I'm trying to sell corn and then there's
3468.84s: a grocery store that's going to use the corn, we can both add stability to our lives.
3476.16s: If I talk to that grocery store and I set up an agreement with them where next year
3481.64s: I'm going to deliver to you X amount of crop and it will call it X or it will call it
3487.92s: Y value.
3489.72s: So it's to stabilize price.
3492.00s: Now the way that farmers and agriculture will use them now is literally to primarily
3498.32s: hedge their selling of the products.
3502.56s: So you can see this expressed in this.
3510.12s: Let me move this over here.
3512.12s: Get rid of this here.
3519.88s: So you can go to the commitment of traders report and you can look at something like wheat.
3526.80s: And you'll notice something based on this.
3532.84s: So you can look at the relationship between producers and speculators.
3541.24s: So producers are going to be these red lines and you notice how speculators are kind of
3545.64s: the inverse and then you'll notice that non commercials are kind of like this fucking
3550.96s: middle of the middle of the road group.
3554.60s: So what's happening here is commercials when they're buying stuff up like this that
3560.88s: doesn't mean that they think that their underlying contract is going to appreciate in value
3569.12s: and that they're going to sell the contract for a profit.
3571.20s: That's actually not what they want.
3573.16s: What they want is that value, the contract to just be there as a hedge and then to be
3578.84s: able to conduct their business and then to sell things at prices that makes sense for
3583.00s: them.
3584.00s: So this is a big thing if you look at something like airlines, they will use futures and
3589.38s: trading activities to hedge the cost of fuel, which is highly variable.
3596.16s: It creates a bubble for them and a general planning factor if they hedge their risk with
3601.64s: respect to price changes.
3604.32s: So futures are a little bit different in that sense in terms of like what their construction
3610.76s: is, but the way to think about futures, they're kind of like a delta one variant of options
3617.76s: for the base contracts.
3619.84s: So you can use futures to trade things that you can't trade with options directly.
3624.84s: So for example, that gold trade that I talked about yesterday, you can't trade gold outright
3631.76s: with other securities.
3634.68s: You can't trade the commodity itself.
3636.68s: It's literally what futures were for is to trade the commodities themselves.
3641.08s: So for something like that gold trade, it pertains to a certain amount of gold, physical
3648.44s: gold.
3649.96s: So Rises and their leverage to the tits, some of them, yeah, some of them, not all of
3656.96s: them.
3657.96s: And options can also provide the same or more leverage in certain circumstances.
3664.08s: It entirely depends on the position.
3666.52s: So it's relative.
3668.12s: And that's a common misconception about futures is that people think that futures are this insanely
3675.84s: jack to the tits leveraged product.
3679.24s: And some of them are big.
3681.28s: Some of them are not big.
3682.88s: So yeah, yes and no is the answer.
3687.88s: Some things can move a lot.
3689.12s: Some things cannot move a lot.
3691.40s: There's a difference between the amount of leverage something provides and also its
3696.36s: volatility because you have to keep in mind, you can have something that might perceivably
3701.08s: pertain to a lower dollar amount, but have a much more leverage tied to it.
3708.60s: So this is a common thing that you'll find with net gas.
3712.32s: Net gas is always touted as like the widow maker.
3715.64s: It's like this big terrible thing.
3717.80s: Net gas is not that bad.
3719.48s: It really is not that bad.
3721.60s: What's bad about net gas is people confuse it.
3725.96s: And they misunderstand periods of complacency as great times to put on way oversized positions.
3736.68s: And then every once in a while, something like net gas becomes super busy, like a lot
3742.32s: of other things.
3744.36s: So people misposition notoriously in something like net gas.
3748.92s: But if we look at the volatility of something like net gas compared to other stuff, it's
3755.20s: really not that crazy.
3757.40s: But people are mispositioned and they trade really poorly around it.
3765.64s: Because there's a reality here.
3768.28s: We can see net gas hit a low of 144 back in 2020.
3774.64s: And it literally hit 10 in 2022.
3779.92s: That is a massive move on a relative basis for a commodity.
3784.76s: That's a giant move.
3786.52s: So one of the issues I think is people just misposition pretty frequently, even big firms,
3795.28s: is they don't always fully respect hail risk is what it boils down to.
3804.00s: James says in futures, try starting with MES is it moves like spy and the multiplier
3808.24s: is small so you won't get surprised.
3810.28s: Yeah, I think that's fair.
3812.20s: I mean, in my opinion, I would just paper trade them.
3814.48s: You already know that answer.
3816.04s: There's no reason to start trading futures at all before paper trading them for a year
3821.20s: plus.
3822.20s: There's literally no reason not to.
3825.24s: Because the problem with futures is that there are a lot of other elements that people
3831.60s: don't really understand.
3833.08s: Like for example, carry, there's an optimal time to roll a futures contract depending
3839.04s: on what it is based on the carry, which is a cost that you pay to hold it, but it's an
3844.40s: indirect cost.
3846.36s: So I think, Roryntitty says, where can you pay for trade futures without paying a subscription?
3853.96s: Not going to excel dog open up a Google sheet.
3858.88s: There's and just track your own shit.
3861.36s: There's zero reason to paper trade in a paper trading platform literally zero reason.
3868.32s: Paper trading in a paper trading platform is it's literally pure silliness because you're
3875.92s: not going to get real fills and the data is gone as soon as you hit reset.
3881.56s: It's gone.
3882.84s: It's open up excel and paper trade in there.
3886.00s: That's literally exactly what I do.
3888.28s: I'm starting to move some of my stuff over to Google sheets.
3891.08s: So it's a little more portable.
3893.04s: But for like the bigger data sets that I track, I still use Excel just because it's much
3897.20s: faster than Google sheets.
3898.68s: And it's exactly what I do.
3901.64s: Yeah.
3903.64s: Roryntitty says, first he wants me to save.
3906.80s: Now he wants me to do data entry.
3908.72s: I roll.
3909.72s: Yeah, exactly.
3910.72s: I hear you.
3911.72s: And that's the plight of being a trader.
3915.64s: I know hold on.
3917.16s: You already know this is the perfect time to promote my biggest most bangerous videos.
3925.04s: This one.
3926.04s: Whoa.
3927.04s: I think last time we spoke this video had 200 views.
3933.20s: And I want to be.
3935.40s: It's at 3 10 now.
3940.12s: This is from 21 September.
3942.24s: So that video is about flying off the shelf as fast as you can.
3948.00s: If there was a video to watch, I would watch that one before YouTube decides that it's
3955.68s: too hot.
3956.68s: And YouTube might pull it down because of how many views it's gotten.
3959.60s: It could be too big of a video.
3964.08s: So yeah, I think futures are completely, completely fine to tinker with in Excel.
3971.60s: But I like I wouldn't jump into them.
3974.36s: There's no reason to jump into them.
3976.44s: There's slight benefits to them.
3978.64s: But I would you got to focus if you're trying to learn about trading options going into futures.
3984.52s: It's not the right place to go.
3985.80s: It's genuinely not.
3987.28s: And it's because there's just added.
3990.04s: There's added complexity.
3991.88s: That's not difficult to learn.
3993.40s: It's entirely easy to learn.
3995.56s: But it's added complexity that just slows down the broader learning process.
4001.32s: So yeah, that's exactly why I think futures are fine.
4005.92s: And if you feel like you have a good understanding of options and you kind of get the world of
4009.64s: derivatives, then there's no problem with starting to venture into some future stuff.
4014.04s: But futures have really important production cycles that you have to be aware of so that
4018.20s: you don't get on the wrong side of essentially the futures version of binary events.
4023.04s: And shit like that, it can it just catches people off, I think.
4026.56s: So I would try to avoid those instances.
4031.00s: James says great thing on futures is if you're account is small, there's no PDT.
4035.64s: Genuinely didn't know that.
4037.24s: That's actually great for me to know.
4040.24s: Yeah, I think.
4042.08s: Yeah, that's fascinating.
4044.96s: I think traders trying to get around the PDT rule is always silly.
4049.80s: I know I did the same thing.
4051.80s: But the PDT rule is not it's really not there to hurt you.
4055.64s: It's genuinely not.
4056.64s: It's there to slow you down from hurting yourself because the overwhelming majority of traders
4061.76s: do and that's not me endorsing it.
4064.88s: I believe people are grown fucking adults.
4067.64s: And if you don't want to wear a seatbelt, don't wear a seatbelt.
4070.64s: And if you want to try to day trade with a $5,000 account, fucking whatever, go go crazy.
4077.88s: I don't believe in being babysat.
4080.96s: It's not there to hurt you.
4082.40s: It's genuinely not because most traders take care of that by absolutely hurting themselves
4088.24s: and entirely themselves.
4090.60s: Yeah.
4091.60s: I'm getting caught up.
4097.40s: Zack says there's got to be a way to have AI fill it in for Excel.
4100.04s: Yeah, there's something like that.
4101.96s: But again, if you watch that video, one thing I talk about is developing a relationship
4107.28s: with the data.
4109.08s: And I genuinely believe that's an important process.
4112.12s: The reason is because if you understand if you're closer in the process of conducting
4119.04s: data entry, you're inherently going to be closer to the information.
4122.40s: It's just a function of doing it.
4124.80s: And you will learn more like again, like purposeful observation is pretty useful.
4131.20s: So I think there's nothing wrong if you want to use some sort of Excel tool or API to
4140.64s: speed up the process.
4142.44s: But I cannot recommend highly enough just manually inputting stuff in your paper trading
4147.36s: logs.
4148.36s: I still do it today.
4149.56s: I literally still do it today.
4151.56s: And I make it a purposeful exercise.
4154.56s: So I think it's valuable.
4158.84s: Many says futures were also taxed that section 1256.
4163.84s: Yeah.
4164.84s: So futures indices and stuff like that are so section 1256 of the tax code.
4169.96s: I have a really old video.
4172.52s: I don't think I've redone this video because I don't really care enough.
4175.88s: Yeah.
4176.88s: Yeah.
4177.88s: If you guys want to see an OG, this isn't even like a full OG Eric video, but that's like
4182.84s: a partially OG Eric video.
4185.36s: This is from 2021.
4187.72s: I think OG, I started in May of 2020.
4190.68s: So that's about a year in a YouTube.
4195.00s: But that goes over section 1256 of the tax code.
4200.96s: Rory Titty says 69 minutes in.
4202.88s: Look at us go.
4203.88s: The only issue is that we, I don't even think we cracked.
4206.64s: I think we had 50 viewers, maybe.
4209.04s: So we unfortunately, we didn't hit our 69, which is, you know, sad.
4215.84s: Sad for me, as I think about it makes me sad.
4220.36s: Reese's shirt better be off.
4221.76s: Sometimes it is.
4222.56s: Sometimes it isn't.
4223.44s: You never really know.
4225.24s: There's, there's females now that show up on the streams and stuff.
4228.76s: So that's literally why I remain clothed.
4231.08s: It's straight up just trying to be respectful.
4234.32s: It might be a little too old school or presumptive, but I do try to be respectful
4239.12s: of the ladies for the dude.
4240.52s: Y'all can go fuck yourselves.
4242.20s: But for the women, it's not so much that case.
4244.64s: Try to be, try to be respectful.
4249.36s: All right.
4251.52s: Now, let, let's get back over to this.
4256.80s: I was going to talk about futures and I was going to talk about the utility.
4262.88s: So I wanted to talk about
4267.28s: using huge futures to hedge.
4271.28s: So let's say that you have a portfolio.
4282.28s: I'm literally just randomly, randomly naming stocks.
4288.28s: And then Nvidia.
4291.28s: So let's say that you have this portfolio.
4297.28s: And let's say it's now, let's say it's Tuesday.
4303.28s: And it's at 20 hundred Pacific time.
4309.28s: And let's say that Iran invades Israel.
4321.28s: What do you think would happen to the stock market if that happened?
4325.28s: If Iran invaded Israel, 20, 200 Pacific time on a Tuesday,
4330.28s: what would be your guess?
4332.28s: What would happen here?
4334.28s: Nothing good.
4335.28s: Yeah.
4336.28s: You probably, you probably would see the market do this.
4344.28s: Here's the opening candle.
4351.28s: That's what it would do.
4355.28s: And then for those that are reading between the lines here,
4362.28s: don't forget that we have.
4368.28s: You guys know who this is.
4375.28s: Probably as long here.
4380.28s: The wind.
4387.28s: Except she is actually going to grab.
4399.28s: She has a telescope.
4407.28s: Here.
4409.28s: A little sighting picture.
4412.28s: Oh yeah, and I forgot.
4414.28s: She made a bunch of money before.
4417.28s: So she has a gold chain.
4420.28s: And it has diamonds on it.
4426.28s: So Lauren.
4430.28s: Is over here and she has, like, a, a monocular.
4435.28s: And she's keeping an eye on things.
4437.28s: Oh yeah, shit.
4438.28s: You guys can't see the whole second.
4440.28s: There you go.
4441.28s: Perfect.
4443.28s: So she's keeping an eye on things.
4447.28s: And she sees that over here.
4455.28s: There's a tank.
4463.28s: So let's point it.
4465.28s: Kind of put it in the middle, which I shouldn't have done.
4469.28s: So there's a tank over here.
4478.28s: That is shooting a projectile.
4486.28s: At a tank that's over here.
4489.28s: This one has a lot of wheels.
4500.28s: This guy is looking the wrong way, though.
4502.28s: Kind of sucks to be him.
4504.28s: So now what's happening.
4507.28s: Is Lauren's over here.
4510.28s: With her telescope.
4512.28s: And she sees this thing unfolding.
4515.28s: She's like, oh, shit.
4517.28s: Over there in the Middle East.
4519.28s: This tank is shooting at this tank.
4521.28s: And they're driving towards each other.
4526.28s: I think the market is probably not going to react well to this.
4531.28s: And while the two tanks are going at it, you can see that this person over here.
4539.28s: Is Israeli.
4542.28s: And in their chat bubble.
4546.28s: They're all like, hey, yo.
4552.28s: Fuck you.
4557.28s: And then over here.
4564.28s: We have this person that's like, hey, yo.
4571.28s: Fuck you.
4577.28s: So we can see that we have a clear issue starting to unravel.
4585.28s: And Lauren.
4589.28s: Over here.
4594.28s: She can see all this.
4600.28s: And she's all like.
4603.28s: Oh, damn.
4611.28s: Let me check.
4617.28s: The port.
4619.28s: Obviously the port is the portfolio.
4621.28s: So she doesn't want to take her eye off the microscope.
4629.28s: And she's going to look at her portfolio.
4632.28s: That looks like this.
4635.28s: So.
4639.28s: Because she has chameleon eyes.
4646.28s: She has this one looking this way.
4649.28s: This one looking this way.
4652.28s: As she has her chameleon eyes.
4655.28s: Looking in different ways.
4658.28s: She sees this thing getting worse.
4661.28s: Because now this guy shooting back.
4665.28s: I'm going to get the right color.
4667.28s: This guy finally turns his tank around.
4670.28s: A little bit like this.
4673.28s: And then he.
4676.28s: Get's get some heat off himself.
4684.28s: Quickly exclaims.
4690.28s: Bam.
4694.28s: Beach.
4696.28s: And he sends his round back over here.
4700.28s: Okay.
4701.28s: What I'm highlighting is war is heating up.
4707.28s: And getting spicy over here in the old war front.
4717.28s: And Lauren can see all this.
4720.28s: And Lauren is a highly highly perceptive trader.
4726.28s: So she says.
4731.28s: My portfolio.
4733.28s: I need to manage this.
4735.28s: So what she can do is she's going to be like,
4738.28s: yo, let me check the port.
4741.28s: Hmm.
4745.28s: I have 1000.
4750.28s: Beta weighted.
4753.28s: Spy deltas.
4761.28s: Then she might say.
4766.28s: I'm a scrub.
4770.28s: Some.
4775.28s: So here.
4777.28s: Lauren looks at her portfolio.
4780.28s: She sees.
4782.28s: That she has.
4786.28s: She has 1000 beta weighted spy deltas.
4792.28s: And she wants to she's going to scrub some of them off.
4797.28s: Right.
4798.28s: She's going to scrub them.
4801.28s: So what can she do?
4807.28s: She's going to be like.
4811.28s: Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, my bed.
4814.28s: She's going to be like.
4818.28s: Deep.
4821.28s: This is her pressing buttons on the cell phone.
4826.28s: And as she's pressing on buttons on the cell phone,
4829.28s: she gets that that beep boop going.
4832.28s: Then she's going to be like, I'm going to sell to open.
4836.28s: Maybe.
4837.28s: What do you guys say?
4838.28s: Maybe five.
4842.28s: Something like that.
4843.28s: You could do MES here.
4847.28s: MES futures.
4851.28s: Maybe more.
4854.28s: Or more.
4858.28s: If more.
4861.28s: I just pulled this up on OBS.
4871.28s: And I just realized how unbelievably absurd this looks.
4879.28s: Is what it is.
4880.28s: This is the scenario.
4882.28s: So.
4885.28s: We can put this order in.
4888.28s: And we can put this order in to take off some of these beta weighted
4893.28s: delta's for spy.
4897.28s: And we can do this so that our portfolio.
4903.28s: Doesn't blow up because right now.
4909.28s: The equivalent of what's going on here from all of this.
4914.28s: And there is a giant.
4919.28s: Sphere.
4920.28s: I'd probably got some holes on it from flying through space.
4927.28s: That's hurling.
4934.28s: Towards her portfolio.
4937.28s: And she can protect her portfolio.
4940.28s: And then the market's closed.
4943.28s: By putting on a futures trade like this.
4946.28s: This is one of the benefits of trading futures.
4949.28s: Is it gives you the ability to manage black swan risk.
4955.28s: Without having to carry.
4958.28s: A hedge forever.
4960.28s: So.
4962.28s: I'm going to pause here.
4963.28s: I've been seeing the chat flying around.
4965.28s: Let me get caught up.
4967.28s: It looks like there's.
4970.28s: B Williams gifted.
4973.28s: A shit ton 20.
4975.28s: B Williams gifted 20 outlier trading memberships.
4978.28s: Yo, you are the homey B Williams.
4980.28s: Thank you so much for doing that.
4982.28s: I hope everybody enjoys B Williams.
4988.28s: Make sure you guys say thank you to him, especially if you were the ones that got it.
4991.28s: I don't know how that works.
4992.28s: I literally don't.
4993.28s: But make sure you guys say thank you, please.
4996.28s: And on behalf of everybody else, thank you.
4999.28s: That Lauren says funny.
5001.28s: I have binoculars because I'm kind of nosy.
5004.28s: Yeah, exactly.
5005.28s: So I could tell Lauren because what you're fucking long ass legs and shit.
5010.28s: You're out here looking at war unfolding.
5014.28s: And you're making trading decisions.
5017.28s: But this is one of the good parts about futures.
5022.28s: Is they give you exposure to something like this?
5025.28s: And it helps offset.
5027.28s: Some of the risk.
5029.28s: All right.
5031.28s: Back into here.
5034.28s: I think we had learning in future.
5036.28s: I think this is it.
5037.28s: I think we got through most of them.
5039.28s: Okay.
5041.28s: Who were the key influences or mentors that help shape your trading career?
5045.28s: And what was the most valuable lesson you learned from them?
5048.28s: There's two people.
5049.28s: And this is actually pretty short.
5050.28s: The first one is the dude that introduced me to invest thing,
5053.28s: not trading at all, by the way, he didn't introduce me to.
5058.28s: This guy.
5060.28s: Which.
5061.28s: Not fun fact.
5063.28s: He's been dealing with cancer and he just had more cancer that popped up.
5068.28s: And it doesn't look super great.
5070.28s: He was just out here to visit me.
5072.28s: But I might be flying to New York to go.
5075.28s: Go hang out with them for a bit.
5077.28s: So anybody that does prayers or thoughts with love for you guys to keep them in your prayers.
5084.28s: His name is, I call him Eman.
5086.28s: His name is Ed.
5087.28s: But this, this is.
5092.28s: This is quite literally the dude that changed my life.
5095.28s: Like genuinely.
5097.28s: Because he is the one that introduced me not only to.
5103.28s: Investing, but I used to spend a ton of time in his office after school hours.
5111.28s: Because well, for a lot of reasons, I didn't want to go home and also going home.
5117.28s: Yeah, but bunch of bullshit.
5119.28s: So.
5120.28s: I used to spend hours just learning from him, asking him about life, asking him about experiences.
5128.28s: And he has been, yeah, kind of a massive influence.
5134.28s: So.
5136.28s: When I consider what my life would look like with and without him, it's.
5145.28s: It's literally night and day.
5147.28s: I would be in a completely, completely different spot.
5151.28s: So he's had cancer a few times.
5153.28s: He has, he's had melanoma a few times.
5156.28s: And then he just had prostate cancer.
5158.28s: He went through that.
5160.28s: And now he's looking at it again.
5163.28s: He has some shit, like a mass underneath his shoulder.
5167.28s: And then I guess it looks like it's spreading again.
5170.28s: So yeah.
5172.28s: So he's the first one.
5174.28s: And it's not just from a trading perspective.
5176.28s: It's literally just from like a manhood perspective.
5181.28s: I was just teaching me how to think and, and yeah, stuff like that.
5187.28s: But he and I, I didn't realize it, but he and I.
5192.28s: I was very receptive to kind of like his.
5196.28s: To learning from him.
5198.28s: But he also had a son that he adopted and his son had committed suicide.
5204.28s: So he also had a void.
5206.28s: Because at this point in my life, I didn't really have.
5209.28s: My dad was still alive.
5211.28s: And I love my dad.
5212.28s: My dad loved us as best as he could, especially as we got older.
5216.28s: But I didn't have like a father figure in my life.
5219.28s: Like, he man genuinely became that.
5221.28s: Like when I went to advice, even today, as I'm thinking about different kinds of things,
5226.28s: he's always the first person that I go to for advice.
5229.28s: So he's influenced more than just my trading.
5232.28s: He's the one that introduced me to trading.
5234.28s: And then the second person.
5237.28s: Is a guy that I met online.
5240.28s: And I would indirectly learn from a lot of what he talked about.
5246.28s: He was somebody that clearly didn't have a lot of motives.
5252.28s: And the reason why I say that is because he was not nice to people.
5257.28s: He's not like I would consider myself much nicer than him.
5260.28s: Although I'm very direct and sometimes people interpret that as like being not nice or or something like that,
5267.28s: especially like via messaging.
5269.28s: Because messaging definitely comes across very terse typically.
5273.28s: But that that mentor taught me that I didn't know shit about trading,
5280.28s: even though I had been trading for a while.
5283.28s: And I didn't go into it thinking that I was hot shit knowing everything.
5287.28s: And just in the conversations I would have and watch him have,
5291.28s: I learned that there was a lot of massive gaps in what I do.
5296.28s: And that second mentor is a big reason why I started the YouTube channel.
5301.28s: Because YouTube was around then, but it wasn't as big of a deal then.
5305.28s: And he wasn't doing a YouTube.
5306.28s: He had no interest in doing a YouTube channel.
5308.28s: I actually invited him onto mine so that I could talk to him and.
5315.28s: And he showed the impact that he's had on my life.
5318.28s: And hopefully just put that in front of people.
5321.28s: But he didn't want to be he doesn't even I don't even mention his name because he doesn't want to be named.
5327.28s: So he taught me that.
5334.28s: Even though I was really eager to try to make a lot of money.
5339.28s: At a young age, my eagerness didn't matter.
5343.28s: I could be as eager as I wanted.
5346.28s: But what really mattered was taking the time to plan.
5352.28s: And creating a plan that made sense.
5356.28s: Now, his teaching style is actually very, very similar to my teaching style,
5363.28s: which is I.
5366.28s: I try to aim people in the right direction.
5370.28s: I think self learning.
5373.28s: You should learn a lot of the nuance in the details by yourself.
5378.28s: I obviously teach a lot of the fundamentals and foundational stuff, right?
5382.28s: Like this whole spin off series is essentially that to a T.
5388.28s: And going through in very, very deep detail teaching, you know, a lot of concepts.
5394.28s: So it's not like I just, you know, say, you know, go learn this.
5397.28s: You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
5401.28s: you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
5405.28s: you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
5409.28s: you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
5413.28s: you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
5417.28s: you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
5421.28s: you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
5425.28s: you know, there's been a lot of something that's done, and I,
5429.28s: I mean, it's going to be it's going to be something that's gone.
5431.28s: Like, bubster-mon corridor, being a project.
5433.28s: Ain't your idea about this right now.
5435.28s: I mean, a project.
5437.28s: Is going to happen like when you go out to the office and eat
5440.22s: your ingredients.
5441.36s: There's going to be examples at, yeah.
5445.40s: Let me clarify.
5447.36s: Spaniards chug me.
5449.42s: Permitted the same thing as drinking water when you don't meet
5451.36s: much I appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah. Eman is the dude. And I really appreciate you guys keeping
5458.16s: them in his thoughts. Neema. Oh, shit. That's a tough. Oh, shit. That's a tough name. Damn.
5467.20s: Ne. Neamaya. Neamaya. Derociae says, how many years do you think a person with some
5477.36s: trading experience should invest in learning options before potentially trading?
5482.56s: Options seems a bit difficult to grasp, let alone finding an edge.
5487.60s: Well, the edge that you will find in options is not all too dissimilar from what you would do
5493.84s: in trading. So from that perspective, I actually think it's quite easy. Now, just in terms of
5502.48s: like application, but in terms of like starting, I have a couple videos that would probably be useful.
5513.44s: This one. So for Neamaya and correct me if I'm wrong, I try to pronounce people's names just
5521.84s: because it's kind of a fun exercise for me. So that video is about like how to start trading,
5529.76s: but in terms of like how long it's not a duration-based thing. And it's absolutely a skills-based
5539.04s: thing. My recommendation, like if I were to advise myself starting over again, I would tell myself
5545.76s: to paper trade for three months at least. And I really think a year would be ideal, but I just
5552.00s: know how impatient I am. So I'm pretending that I'm talking to 17-year-old Eric again. So I'm
5558.24s: compromising to try to get a level of compliance because I could say a year, but it doesn't matter if
5564.64s: I think a year is too long because I can't synthesize that at that point in time. I'm trying to
5570.32s: make money fast. So I'm trying to be realistic with with what I would tell myself three months
5575.76s: is what I would tell myself. And over the course of that three months, you're not going to learn
5580.80s: anything pertaining to making money. That first three months is going to be making a bunch of
5586.56s: mistakes. It's going to be developing a relationship with the markets. It's going to be very, very
5593.36s: slowly learning. Now, the process of developing edge in actually finding ways to make money,
5602.64s: if you're a stock trader, it's literally the same thing. You can just use options to gain leverage.
5609.28s: That's it. So if we go back to the, again, abomination of a slide deck, and we look at
5620.64s: the big four strategy and trade process, it's quite simple. But let's say that you're a stock
5629.76s: trader and you're able to find things that move directionally. Okay, well, that's your profit
5635.60s: mechanism is you're able to accurately identify directional movements. So however you do that in
5642.24s: stock trading is the same as what you would do in options trading. So then you essentially just
5647.52s: need to find things that allow you to capitalize on that profit mechanism. But that's again, there's
5654.56s: there's not an inherent edge to options options provide exposure to different kinds of phenomena
5662.56s: that can offer edge like various risk premiums. You can't get that with equities. So that exists.
5669.20s: But options in and of themselves provide precisely zero edge.
5675.92s: It's the same thing as people who debate buying or selling options. And they go back and forth on
5686.64s: if you know, buying is better than selling or selling better than buying. And the reality is, again,
5691.44s: there's really inconclusive edge between them. It's that's really not the question to ask.
5699.60s: So that's that. And roaring titty is asking for the paper trading link. There you go.
5712.00s: So let me know if that answers your question.
5713.84s: And then we have South
5721.12s: packed dad.
5724.08s: There's hope you're having a great night. Love the content. Great to have you. Glad you stopped
5728.80s: buying. Thanks so much for the comment.
5731.44s: Cedric says, Edge would be more like inventing a new cable to get orders through faster. Yeah,
5737.04s: that's that's an edge or again, like an edge is a profit mechanism. That's edge.
5742.64s: So it's your ability to to make money. So something like being able to successfully trade
5750.00s: directionally, like that's edge or your ability to accurately price volatility and to trade
5758.64s: volatility itself. That's edge. Your ability to identify patterns with within markets is edge.
5769.20s: Rointitie says, why is it called edge instead of skill because you can have skill and no edge.
5775.44s: There are a lot of people who can trade for a long time have skills, right? They can know how to
5782.64s: build trades. They can know those kinds of things, but if they have bad risk management,
5787.28s: or if they're too nervous about putting on risk or whatever insert, whatever the thing is,
5793.36s: they can still not have an edge. So in edges is a quantifiable metric where we're expecting
5801.12s: to make money and something. And that's why edge is quite important. Now, edge is like this really
5808.72s: weird topic. There's a lot of different permutations and there's a lot of different ways people
5815.76s: internalize what it means and stuff like that. But because, oh, that's way too bright.
5823.76s: Because sometimes people they'll think if edge is something like beta or alpha. And a lot of times
5832.88s: alpha and edge will go hand in hand. It's definitely not beta.
5839.60s: From a trading perspective, but you can have, you can definitely create excess return
5848.24s: using different betas, but it's just a different concept.
5852.56s: All right.
5860.48s: Joey says I always thought edge was a secret mechanism you profit off of. No, it doesn't have to be
5865.36s: secret. It's, yeah, no, definitely not secret. Most edges is really not secret. Like momentum.
5871.60s: That's not a secret. Variance was premium. So that's not a secret. But those are definitely
5875.52s: quantifiable edges. People have like this really miss. I find like a wide array of edge where some
5886.24s: people that are too much efficient market hypothesis, they would argue that there is no edge,
5890.64s: which obviously we know that there is. And I mean, you shouldn't use anecdotes, but I for a
5898.72s: personal scenario, no for a factor's fucking edge. So that's from a theoretical perspective.
5906.32s: If you take strong form of efficient market hypothesis, which we know is not so much the case.
5913.04s: B. Williams says I think a big thing when it comes to options is do your research on how the
5919.04s: market makers choose price point and what the mechanics are about beneath the surface.
5923.20s: Once you know how it works, you can make it. I would, I would actually argue differently than
5929.52s: that B Williams because realistically, like the way that market makers determine price or the
5934.80s: way market determines price ultimately doesn't actually matter that much, right? It's consensus
5940.72s: driven. So you can understand market mechanics intimately well and still not be able to make money
5947.52s: from it. So for me, I think the North Star for edge, it's literally this process is outlined.
5956.64s: Like this is the process to build edge is right here. And the reason for this is because again,
5963.60s: a lot of people will start trading options thinking that there's some sort of magic solution
5968.72s: in options to their trading problems and that they're going to be able to just trade options and
5972.80s: make a bunch of money and it's just not the case. The way that you build edge in trading is by
5979.68s: finding ways to make money. It's literally that simple. So then how do we find ways to make money?
5986.32s: Well, that's the idea behind profit mechanisms. That's why I label it as such because they are
5991.92s: things that lead to making money. So yeah, the understanding markets, market structure, the
6000.32s: different players, all of that stuff is good information. But if a trader is really good at
6006.96s: trading directionally, they could literally not know any of that and make money. So for example,
6013.60s: if I'm really good at trading directionally, I can just buy option, buy calls in the money out of
6022.72s: the money, both whatever, and I can still make more money than if I just bought the stock.
6028.64s: That's with knowing nothing. It's literally just buying the options. Now, obviously you can
6034.88s: optimize those returns by understanding what a expiration might make sense. What delta might
6040.24s: make sense? What game are you looking for? But that starts to really amplify the returns. It's not
6046.32s: going to generate the returns. Picking your DTE is not what's going to make a trade profitable.
6052.96s: This is what makes a trade profitable. And again, this is why I get such a kick out of traders that
6057.60s: spend so much time spinning their wheels about if they're going to buy options or sell options.
6064.80s: It's like it doesn't really matter. Like it doesn't really matter. If you're going to buy options or
6070.32s: sell options or do both. What matters is if you have a quantifiable profit mechanism that you can
6076.48s: take advantage of, that's what matters. And then your ability to detect it and then your ability to
6081.68s: trade it. But the profit mechanism comes first and that's before you ever touch an option.
6087.84s: So yeah.
6092.80s: B. Williams says options were really only created to hedge positions.
6097.92s: Yeah, well, hedge and speculate, right? Because if you're going to have a hedging component
6104.72s: there has to be somebody to speculate on the other side. Because for example,
6109.76s: I'm not going to take the other side of a hedge unless I have some sort of speculative perspective
6116.96s: on whether or not I think their hedge is going to work out. So yeah, it's definitely born out of hedging.
6126.08s: But it's not like you need the other side of that equation in order for that
6132.72s: play out. So if we take a look at this. Oh, this is cool. Finally.
6146.88s: Google, oh, this is great. So Google Sheets has finally created tabs. I love this because I hate having
6159.68s: a like scroll through this whole thing. But let's take a look at the history. I have this in my trading
6165.60s: plan. Let's go to 350 BC. Fails and the olive harvest. Literally. So this is
6175.36s: like these are these are the notes. I'm literally going to read you the notes directly from a trade
6180.96s: log. So let's talk about the the advent. One of the earliest references to options trading was
6190.16s: seen in a book written by Aristotle. And it's from the fourth century or about 350 BCE. The book
6197.04s: was named politics. And it talked about fails of militus who earned massive profits from an olive
6205.76s: from an olive harvest. Fails had immense knowledge of astronomy and mathematics, which he
6213.28s: combined with other subjects to build the foundation of options contracts. He studied the stars
6218.96s: intricately and predicted that there would be a massive olive harvest in his region. He had
6224.56s: identified the olive presses that would witness huge demand and profit from his market vision.
6232.56s: However, fails lacked funds required to buy all the olive presses. So in the off season,
6238.00s: he paid some of money to each of the press owners to obtain the rights to use them at harvest time.
6245.36s: He agreed to pay a small premium to the owners of the olive presses, which the owners would
6251.36s: keep to lock in the right to use the presses for the next harvest at a predetermined price.
6258.00s: That literally is a premium to an option. The owners agreed to this as they would get a guaranteed
6264.64s: amount, even if fails opted out of the deal, they would still be able to sell the rights to use
6269.44s: the press every year. When the growing season set in, olive presses saw a harvest much higher than
6275.12s: usual. Since the crop is time sensitive, the farmers acted in desperation to bid up the payment
6282.24s: to the olive mill to quickly process their harvest, though the terminology wasn't official,
6287.12s: that's literally a call contract. So if you think about what that was, that's literally that
6294.72s: example from 350 BC is straight up a speculative trade. So fails for millits shows us actually that
6304.00s: the very first options trade technically speaking is not a hedge at all, but he was speculating.
6310.72s: He was speculating that demand was going to be massive in the coming harvest and he ended up
6316.64s: being correct. Now again, in general, a lot of the more common use of early options definitely
6322.32s: is very similar to hedging. That's a big part of it. But that's also that's more so futures
6328.00s: why futures were invented was specifically for hedging. But yeah, anyways, in case anybody was
6333.68s: interested in a history lesson, I literally go through essentially all of the early uses of
6341.84s: options. So I go from 360 BC to 1636 to the 17th century to the 1800s all the way through. So yeah,
6352.48s: I mean, that literally I nerd about this stuff just a tad. But I spent a lot of time digging into
6360.32s: the history of derivatives because it was just super, super interesting to me. So
6368.80s: B William says, what I've been very successful in trading is following the stock for about two
6373.60s: weeks and understanding the momentum and what's going on with world news. Yeah, that's okay. So some
6378.88s: people will define individual tickers that they like to trade. I very much am not like that. I look
6386.00s: for specific conditions and I tend to be agnostic of the ticker. And it's just because I can
6395.36s: I can get more repetitions in by doing it that way. If we focus on one individual ticker,
6402.32s: you really narrow your scope a lot. And again, that's okay if you like that. But I actually think
6409.12s: using a conditions based approach will get you much more looks at things that fit those specific
6416.88s: conditions that should statistically yield a positive outcome in the aggregate. The funny thing
6423.36s: about this story is if you go on the discord was for anybody here yesterday was anybody here
6431.52s: on the live stream yesterday. And then I have another question for you.
6435.20s: So there was a stream yesterday. Okay, so Reese was there. Got it. So we went through a bit of a
6443.92s: case study. Yeah, on a trade. And if you take a look at what I posted in the discord earlier today,
6452.00s: what do you notice about this? Different holding than what we reviewed yesterday.
6460.08s: But what do you notice about the general looking feel? Super fucking similar. Super fucking similar.
6470.88s: So the point is if we use some sort of conditions based rules set, we can find more opportunities
6482.96s: that fit those conditions. So this I already have a position on. I started scaling in actually on
6488.32s: the gap up today just because again, that's the nature of speculating I put on a small trade
6493.84s: to start with. And then as it started running, I literally just scaled in for the first part of
6499.12s: the day as it was running its way up. And then as soon as I got the alert that it had broken
6504.64s: meaningfully above that resistance line, I finished scaling in the position. And I actually sold
6510.56s: a call on top of it that was short dated at a ratio as per usual. Very, very light ratio. It's
6517.04s: like 15% covered. So very, very light ratio. And that's it. It's literally running almost an
6525.76s: identical setup to what I just showed you in APP. Almost identical. And this I'm still in, as you
6534.48s: can see, like I literally am still continuing to move up the stop and to just run it upside. So
6541.68s: the main point there is that if we develop conditions based rules, we can then very efficiently
6550.56s: scan for occurrences of those and then try to play them when they look right. So that's the idea.
6558.48s: I just thought it was hilarious that literally yesterday we had talked about this setup. And then
6565.12s: I mean, if we look at AFRM, it's it's so similar. It's not the same obviously, but it's a very,
6573.76s: very similar move overall. Now the scale of the chart and stuff looks different now because it
6578.56s: hasn't had that big of a run yet. But we'll see if it does. Who knows? It can always revert back.
6583.76s: And what I would do in that instance is just start scaling out because I'm already in for a
6588.80s: decent profit at this point. So it would be a really, really simple trade to me. This is one that
6594.48s: I essentially would not take a loss on at this point. Unless there's a massive gap down, then
6599.20s: I eat the loss. That's how it goes. You play the game. You take risk. That is how the whole thing goes.
6606.32s: All right.
6611.04s: Cedric says you going around a little unsuperstalk lately. That makes me nervous. I don't know if
6617.92s: that's good or bad, but super stonk. I know has a very specific opinion of things. So hopefully not
6627.92s: not bad news. I wonder I'm guessing that the video I did yesterday would probably crack a couple
6633.12s: people up. Yeah, the this stuff, that was my that would be my guess. Cedric says it's good comments,
6642.80s: but it's not a good thing. Why? Yeah. I mean, I don't know. For overall brand, it's always a good
6649.44s: thing if people are at least somewhat interested to share the stuff that I do.
6655.36s: So that I imagine is probably not a bad thing. But if I'm just guessing that it would have been
6659.76s: the video from yesterday, because otherwise I haven't done anything too recently. Maybe the stuff
6664.00s: about the cat. I don't know what it is. You'll have to tell me. But yeah, that's interesting.
6670.96s: The next question here is how do you continue to learn and stay updated with market changes
6678.00s: after all these years of experience? That's easy. That's just literally this, right? Like the time I
6685.84s: spend with you all going through stuff essentially shows how I do this exact process. So it's just
6692.00s: a matter of staying in touch with the markets. That's kind of easy. Cedric says also Peruvian and the
6699.44s: one million. Yeah. Okay. So I figured it was from the video yesterday just because if for those that
6703.92s: haven't seen the video that I did yesterday on Citadel, essentially it was just a I was just
6709.20s: fucking around because I can't help but find the whole thing pretty, pretty hilarious.
6716.32s: But yeah, thank you, Cedric. That's stuff. Honestly, it's helpful for me to know at least that
6721.68s: something like that is going on because I've already told you guys and I tell people this like
6726.48s: pretty regularly. Like I literally consume essentially no, no financial media. Like I read news
6735.20s: and stuff that comes out, but I don't really consume any financial media. I kind of just do my own
6739.60s: shit. Cedric says sarcasm for 10 minutes straight, pretty impressed. Yeah, it's well, for me to
6746.56s: riff like that is just the norm. I don't script any of my videos. So yeah, the videos like that one
6757.44s: I kind of knew what I wanted to talk about obviously in the context. And but it wasn't planned to be a
6764.40s: full, a full video of just sarcasm and satire. It genuinely wasn't. I just kind of started with it
6773.28s: and then the next joke and framing kind of kept rolling. I just kept going with it until it stopped
6779.20s: essentially. I'm not gonna lie though. I thought the ending was pretty funny though. That's probably
6784.00s: my favorite part of that video. Joey says no squawk box, no squawk box. Ben Zingha has one, but I
6791.68s: don't listen to it. It doesn't matter to me. Like that's not that's not the way that I trade. So
6797.60s: catching news as soon as it's happening to try to play those really short term moves. It's not so much my style.
6805.12s: Again, what I do is very conditions based. So if there's something that's getting caught in the news
6810.32s: that then hits my radar, I'll typically be a little bit late to it, but that's just kind of how it goes.
6816.08s: I don't mind. I'm not trying to top tick or bottom tick everything. Joyce says I have no idea what a
6821.52s: squawk box is actually. So it used to be these literally like a box. It was like those conference
6828.24s: call tools, but it was always on. And so people would have it on the floor and then they would have
6834.80s: the other end like wherever their office is for their firm. So then it's essentially an open
6840.24s: line of communication between the floor and you so you can hear what's going on, although you're
6845.04s: not there. So that's the idea behind a squawk box. It's just for essentially flow of information.
6853.68s: Troll box. That's more. Tommy, I think that's more accurate. I like that one better. The troll box.
6865.52s: All right. Next question here is what resources, books, courses, mentors had the most
6872.08s: significant impact on your development options as a strategic investor for sure. And then
6877.76s: Nate and Berg's book probably and then you and books after that, at least from a fundamental
6883.92s: understanding of things. And then I think O'Shaunase's book was good. I think
6890.32s: I think that's most of like what have had the most significant impact because I'm at a point
6902.64s: my trading career where it's incremental gains. Like I have to put in multiple hours of effort to
6909.60s: learn like one new unit of information that's like, you know, really dense information of sorts.
6916.40s: So what I do now is is a lot different now, but it's not efficient. It can't be efficient at
6921.76s: this point. It kind of is what it is. How do you recommend new traders filter through
6927.60s: overwhelming amount of information? This is hilarious because this is literally why I built this for
6937.84s: you. Let me grab it. This year. And again, this isn't like an end-to-end thing,
6948.00s: but it's a starting point. So the short answer to this is I think the way for new traders to
6954.40s: filter through the amount of information that's there is actually to create a syllabus for yourself.
6959.68s: And then from that syllabus, I would just make sure that it makes sense. You can use literally
6966.64s: a book like options as a strategic investment as your basis for your syllabus. And you can
6975.68s: create a learning path for yourself. What I try to remind people when it comes to learning
6980.80s: anything that you learn in school, there's normally a very defined path. There's test quizzes,
6985.44s: projects, stuff like that homework. And there's none of that in trading. Most people just kind of go
6991.60s: off and go forth and do their best or whatever the case is. And I actually think that's a pretty
6998.48s: big mistake. I think that when we try to learn like that, it's very circuitous. We just go
7008.48s: around and fucking circles. We learn a little bit here. I call it movement for the sake of movement
7014.16s: because you might look at a lot of stuff. You might do a lot of stuff, but it doesn't mean that
7018.00s: you're actually like deriving a lot of value from all that stuff. So yeah, that's essentially
7026.08s: how I would filter through things is I would just be very purposeful with the learning steps.
7032.08s: And again, you can use a book like options as a strategic investment. You can use the link that I
7036.08s: dropped there. But just think of how you learn in school and create that for learning options.
7043.20s: It's kind of like the same thing. How is your trading style evolved to adapt to recent market
7050.48s: changes such as the rise of meme stocks and zero DTE options trading? That's funny. So zero DTE's
7055.68s: I trade. Most people know the the size and stuff that I do in zero DTE's is is not a significant
7061.68s: part of the account value though. And zero DTE's continue to be a decent return. But there are like
7069.28s: it's for me at least I'm not going to be making buckets of money trading zero DTE's is just not how
7075.76s: my strategy works with it. And the way that I trade it continues to evolve. You guys have already seen
7081.68s: some of those changes over the last couple of years where I used to very heavily
7086.96s: favor straddles and now I favor strangles and there's those kinds of pieces that will continue to
7094.48s: evolve as I understand more and how markets move with respect to the to the phenomenon or in this
7102.96s: case your DTE's meme stocks. That's easy. I just trade the movement. And you know, obviously I'm
7109.92s: way deeper into meme stocks now mostly to participate with you. But meme stocks for me are still a
7116.64s: very small part of what I do in my total portfolio. It's by it's yeah by and large a really small
7128.32s: component of my speculative allocations. I tend to trade things again that are kind of conditions
7135.84s: based that look interesting to me. The governor says every course is for ADD people literally
7143.84s: skipping around every subject in course. Or in city says there should be an options course for
7149.52s: ADD and dyslexic people. That's funny. I think the problem is honestly if you have ADD and if
7156.72s: if somebody is afflicted with ADD and or dyslexia like options trading is probably not for you.
7163.44s: Like that's just the that's the God on a truth. And it's because there's a lot of fucking details.
7168.96s: And if if you're not good at staying focused and like managing the details,
7178.48s: it's not it's just not a good it's not a good fit. It's like the same thing is somebody like
7184.96s: I might like the idea of being a fucking ballerina. But I don't know like I probably wouldn't be
7190.80s: very good at it, especially with my fucked up back right now. I don't necessarily have the physical
7199.04s: setup to be a ballerina. It's like the same thing. You kind of have to find stuff that align
7204.80s: with your personality and individuality because that's the reality. You can see
7212.24s: you can see a lot of you know my tendencies. A lot of you have watched me on these live streams
7218.80s: for enough now to have a pretty good feel. But I'm very very much obsessive. I am somewhat
7226.08s: detail oriented. I'm detail oriented on the stuff that I think matters to be detail oriented.
7231.44s: And then a lot of stuff I'm not detail. It is highly variable. So like those kind of tendencies
7238.80s: translate pretty well to the market. So yeah.
7249.84s: Six is what trading technology or tools do you consider essential for a trader?
7254.88s: Excel.
7258.88s: Excel or Google Sheets. That's what's essential.
7263.84s: Think scripting doesn't matter. You can literally use chat GPT for most of it.
7270.64s: Yeah. Some sort of tracking, Excel, slash, Google Sheet,
7277.36s: and then a trading platform. Like that's literally all you need. You don't need a bunch of other
7281.28s: shit. Other data sources can be good. They can be useful. I like some of them.
7287.36s: But especially in the beginning, it's kind of like when you watch,
7292.80s: if you watch people that are really good at something, they tend to have like stuff that works.
7298.40s: So for example, in Jujitsu, most black belts will have these old,
7304.72s: ratty-ass black belts. And it's just because the belt does what it does. And it's also a
7310.32s: status symbol, right, to show that the belt has a lot of wear and tear on it.
7314.48s: But you'll notice that a lot of people when they first start something new,
7318.72s: is they go get all the best new shit that they can find, even though the skill set's not there.
7323.76s: So in this, the skill set is not dependent on any of that shit. So I would start very basic.
7340.56s: That Lauren says, I'm ADHD. And once I get all the details of something, I'm extremely successful.
7347.12s: It's just that it takes me longer to learn the details. Yeah. So for something like ADHD with that set,
7352.08s: I think you just have to figure out then what the learning process is.
7355.76s: Because here's the other thing is I think modern day society, one, we like, for example,
7362.72s: if somebody has ADHD, the first thing I would do is say you get literally no social media.
7368.48s: There's no social media for you. You don't get Instagram, you don't get YouTube shorts,
7372.72s: you don't get TikTok, you get none of that. And I think that it's because it massively contributes to
7378.16s: it. Then I think it's starting to reel back the underlying behavior because I think we over
7386.00s: diagnosed stuff like ADD and ADHD. I really do because I think like I have trouble focusing.
7393.84s: Maybe it's not, you know, a chemical imbalance or stuff like that. And I'm not saying that it
7397.20s: doesn't exist. But I absolutely think that we live in a society that leads to those tendencies.
7405.84s: And then I think we over diagnosed those tendencies. So if a trader has something like attention deficit,
7414.72s: hyperactive, I don't care so much about. But if somebody's attention deficit, the markets are a
7419.12s: bad place to be attention deficit, you have to have attention. And you have to have to attention that
7425.12s: can be essentially like held for long durations of time, even through very uninteresting or non-moving
7435.52s: components. That's just a general mismatch to me. Now again, I would jokingly say I have ADD
7442.16s: or ADHD as well. But in a reality, I can fully control my focus. It's just not always easy.
7450.16s: The there's a period that's very easy if you're in like a flow state. But most of the work that I do
7456.56s: is not in a flow state. Most of the work that I do is really, really thoughtful, dedicated time
7462.80s: to sit down and learn something. And I literally create an architecture for me to do so.
7468.48s: It's one of the reasons why I have a standing desk is you'll see me even during the live sessions
7472.64s: that are a couple hours long. Part of it is because my back hurts. But I'll sit down, stand up,
7478.24s: I will move during it because those changes of pace help refresh my mental clock. I also set
7484.40s: very specific work and break windows for myself based on a lot of human lab protocols.
7491.84s: I don't dis purposely disrupt a flow state. But I respect when I go through periods where I'm
7499.60s: effective versus ineffectual. And if I notice myself being ineffectual, I have to differentiate.
7505.52s: Is it because of a lack of discipline? And I'm being lazy and easily distracted because I'm
7510.24s: not being disciplined or am I literally cognitively fatigued. And I need that 10 minute rest period to
7516.24s: go do something else to refresh my mental perspective to then come back into another bout of like
7523.60s: very focused work. So again, I think a lot of people would just summarize and I'm not saying you
7530.56s: Lauren, I'm just talking about this in general generalities. But I think a lot of people would
7534.88s: just quickly summarize a difficulty in focusing to something like 80 to 80 HD versus applying
7541.68s: the rigorous process to try and be focused because yeah, like it's really difficult to focus on
7548.56s: a lot of this stuff for a lot of people. So
7551.20s: Jonathan Colors says, what are some of the non obvious dangers of a 20 strike GME leap considering
7562.32s: the options or as cheap as they've been since the late 2020s. Obviously being sideways forever.
7570.80s: Or as cheap as they've been, I don't know what that means. What does that mean?
7574.48s: I don't really know what that means. Obviously, I understand that the inference, but I'm saying
7586.56s: from like a broader perspective. I'm grabbing a video for you.
7597.44s: So this video is about buying call options smarter. It's literally for the meme stock slash
7602.88s: ape crowd. So you can check that out. But yeah, off Putin says Newton talking about options could
7615.04s: be dangerous. Yeah, he texted me. I don't know what did he say in his video because I don't want to
7621.68s: go into detail on what he and I spoke about unless he already talked about this stuff.
7627.92s: So what did he say? I haven't seen his video. What did he say in the video about options?
7641.04s: It looks like Jonathan had had watched it.
7657.12s: Nada.
7668.40s: Well, anyways, let me know what it was because obviously I'm happy to talk about it. But I just don't
7673.76s: want to low IVI believe. Okay, let's see.
7687.20s: So IVP implied volatility percentile is no.
7699.36s: Yeah, that's like that's accurate. I would call that accurate. And then if we're going back
7704.24s: to 2020, we need a five year daily. So yeah, I think it's okay to say that. I think on a longer
7722.48s: term timeframe, the implied volatility is relatively cheap. I think in general, the implied
7734.16s: volatility is typically very high just in general.
7743.84s: So like here, those 17 Jan 25s are actually relatively expensive compared to the 17 April,
7769.76s: 25s, which are about like double the duration. So like the 17 Jan's are expensive on a relative basis.
7781.84s: Now, again, it doesn't really matter quite that much. But it's one of those things that I would just
7788.08s: acknowledge when putting on the trade and just kind of take it for what it is, right? Like I am
7794.00s: willingly paying a little more for this overall, for this overall expiration cycle because I like it
7802.96s: or for whatever reason on a relative basis compared to, you know, evolve. But yeah, no, I think
7809.92s: Jonathan, I think what you're saying for whatever Newton was talking about in terms of the cost,
7817.84s: I completely agree. Overall, vol is pretty cheap. The problem is is like buying when volatility
7825.68s: cheap is not like that's not the move. I wouldn't base it off that at all. You have to remember,
7835.20s: volatility is movement. If you buy a call, they make money when it moves. So unless you are
7844.96s: structuring a very specific trade to take advantage on the movement of volatility, something like
7852.40s: horizontal spread, like a calendar of some sort or if you're trying to trade like volatility in
7858.80s: and of itself, then making the buy decision off of all is miss. It's really misleading. And the reason
7867.76s: is because let's take a look. Sedric says, but what if IV is mispriced? It's not. Yeah, so you
7875.12s: don't even have to worry about that. So if we take a look at something like, and to be clear,
7883.68s: this is if I wanted to buy options in something like GameStop, I would go out about 90 days too. I'm
7888.32s: not, I'm not shitting on the idea at all. I think this is about exactly where I would go. And
7893.76s: it's just because of the way that I buy options. Again, it's in that video that I shared up above
7899.28s: there. And the the 20s, the main issue I have with those is that they're all extrinsic value.
7908.96s: Not all. That's kind of dramatic, but it's very, very heavy extrinsic value.
7914.48s: Roryntitty says they were talking leaves January of 26. Oh, shit, I missed that. Sorry.
7918.56s: Yeah, it's a lot of extrinsic value. I personally wouldn't like that too much.
7929.28s: I would either take a slightly lower, I would take a slightly lower delta, maintain the gamma,
7940.48s: take all the extrinsic value and it'd be cheaper. But yeah, for me, this is where I would go.
7948.40s: Is something much closer in time. And I wouldn't, I would either decide if I'm going to be slightly
7956.48s: out of the money and take like a 50 delta, that's all extrinsic value, but still would be a 50 delta.
7963.44s: Or do I want to go slightly further in the money and scrub off a lot of this extrinsic value?
7969.20s: Because the problem is is when volatility is low, it means the stock is not moving. And like,
7974.40s: there's a reason why it's low. So when stock is low, when volatility is low, buying options can
7981.60s: seem more lucrative from a volatility perspective. But again, it goes back to the profit mechanism.
7989.04s: The primary profit mechanism when you buy a call is stock go up. That's the primary profit mechanism.
7995.04s: It's not volatility go up. Volatility go up can help you a little bit, but that's not going to be
8000.48s: the thing that really moves the needle on the trade. So I would just make sure that you like a
8007.12s: trade is structured in the context of the profit mechanism that you're trying to play.
8014.96s: Gibb says, I've learned that a debit spread is pretty useless when the stock doesn't move. But
8020.96s: credit spreads seem to be good unless the stock price goes down.
8024.00s: I think that's mostly just of general, like your, yes, for the debit spread, that's
8034.88s: correct. Debit spreads are going to want movement. And credit spreads are going to want less movement.
8040.48s: I assume you're talking about verticals here. But I wouldn't characterize them the way you are
8048.96s: personally. I think that you're characterizing the strategies a little bit wrong by saying like
8054.80s: debit spreads didn't work out. Right. It's not, it's not debit spreads not working out. It's the
8059.36s: profit mechanism that didn't work out. So I, yeah, I would just be, be clear on that.
8066.16s: Rointitty says, why do people buy deep in the money leaps instead of just buying the shares?
8071.12s: leverage. Rointitty, come on, man, tell me, tell me you didn't watch this video by telling me you
8079.04s: didn't watch this video. I'm a link to it again. Right there. It's entirely for leverage.
8087.60s: It's the same thing that we learn from sales from 350 PC. It's the same thing he did. That's why
8096.08s: he bought a call because he couldn't afford the presses. Damn, Titi, you know, I can't be mad at you.
8107.44s: Last couple of things. What's the biggest shift you've seen in the market since you started in
8112.72s: 2007. Oh, liquidity has gone up massively. There's a lot more volatility. And the edge in a lot of
8129.28s: things that I used to trade is definitely contracted without a doubt. So yeah, I think that's mostly it.
8139.68s: Where do you see your trading career headed in the next five years? Fuck if I know.
8147.76s: And are there new markets or strategies you're excited to explore?
8152.16s: Fuck, I didn't realize that I'm getting like fucking deep questions here.
8158.08s: Um, shit, I don't know. Next five years, I expect to continue trading,
8163.76s: unless I make a massive error at some point, which is not beyond me. That's for sure. And
8172.08s: there's not really any new strategies that I'm excited to explore. I guess they're like
8178.08s: exploring something like event markets. That's kind of interesting to me. I'm generally excited
8185.28s: about that. But I mean beyond that, not so much. Like most of what I do is it's the same
8193.68s: stuff. That's actually why I have the time now to sit here and dive into game stop and, you know,
8201.28s: stuff like that because it's kind of like side quests, right? Like at this point in my trading
8208.24s: career, I know what I'm capable of producing. And I'm fortunate enough that I continue to produce it.
8214.32s: Like every single year, I've had two negative years, my entire trading career. And who knows when
8219.84s: the next one is going to be, hopefully it's not going to be there. But I don't expect it to be
8225.52s: there based on the way that I trade. But I never know. So the way that I trade now is very different
8235.68s: in the context of like my goals are different. My goals in the beginning were to aggressively grow my
8241.36s: account. So I would be very aggressive with positioning for quite, quite some time. And that's not
8249.52s: so much the case anymore. I mean, I'm very open about what my annual return targets are. But I've
8255.44s: already talked about this conundrum I found myself in where last year was my best trading year
8261.52s: that I've ever had. And this year is not going to be my best trading year. But it is overwhelmingly
8272.56s: looking like it's going to be over a 50% year, I think. Because the last time we did the end of
8279.44s: September portfolio percent return breakdown, I don't know, I don't know if I did this on the
8284.72s: main channel or on the Patreon. I don't remember. But the Clifknotes version for that is the
8292.72s: portfolio at that point was up 46.3% on the year. So I find myself in this really strange scenario.
8301.76s: Where I'm not actually trying to have these larger returns. But the way that I'm trading is
8309.84s: continuing to identify them. So I'm just kind of trading opportunities as they continue to pop up.
8316.64s: So that's kind of the way I expect to continue trading. The only thing I have to be really,
8320.96s: really careful about is not overextending myself. And that's easy to do. I'm pretty good
8327.44s: at monitoring the total risk. And that's actually one of the things I was just talking with
8331.60s: a buddy about yesterday that one of my game plans is to
8339.68s: one of my game plans is to actually start modifying the number of positions I have in the portfolio
8348.00s: a little bit and like sizing them down. Just to decrease no like number of positions and stuff
8355.92s: like that to decrease total risk. But yeah, that's kind of it. I don't really see a bunch of
8362.80s: massive changes coming down the pike. Maybe starting to add a little bit more income strategies
8368.88s: potentially. Not like super jazzed on that though. I'd rather just make money. And then with
8373.68s: draw money as compared to like trading income strategies. But we'll see.
8379.20s: Give treaty says I limited the upside debit spread because the spread is cheaper than buying the call.
8385.76s: Yep, that makes sense.
8392.24s: Colonel says have you traded crypto? Definitely. I don't really trade crypto that much.
8396.72s: It's more of like buying hold and staking. But yeah, I've been involved in crypto for a while.
8402.48s: I actually made a bunch of money off of Bitcoin in the mid teens like 20. I forgot what year.
8409.52s: But it was like between 2010 and 2020. It was somewhere like towards the middle there.
8414.56s: And I just I ended up getting out way too early like a lot of people because I thought I made
8418.96s: decent money on what I put in and I didn't trust it at all. So I've traded it for a while now.
8426.24s: But most of what I do now for crypto is kind of just maintained positions. I don't actively
8431.28s: trade the coins too much, although I do trade the futures. And the reason why I do that is just
8436.48s: because they have different relationships with other stuff in the portfolio. And they offer
8443.44s: the ability to kind of really tailor risk reward to where I want it. So yeah.
8452.32s: Mark says do you know why the net gas D's 24 options are slightly skewed,
8457.44s: creating a two six two eight. And the 30 delta shore put us 280. Yep.
8464.40s: We know exactly why that's happening. So if you take a look at net gas,
8472.16s: you're out there in D's, right? So you need to use the Z24 expiration cycle.
8481.12s: So right now you're looking at net gas at spot. You need to use the correct contract
8487.68s: when you're evaluating the price for the for the future or for the option on the future.
8495.76s: So that's why you're seeing that. So realistically that 30 delta shore put strike price is 280
8504.40s: relative to this to this three dot 0 5 0.
8513.44s: Cool. Well, that's all I got for you guys. Is there anything else that you guys want to talk
8518.88s: about real quick before we wrap or anything like that? I still have a few minutes. I have,
8527.12s: I mean, my dinner's not going to be here for a little bit. I'm just going to start working on
8530.00s: a video once I pop off here. Oh, door literally. I hear him outside the door. Hold on. Hold on.
8540.32s: Let me get to do.
8541.20s: We have fatso tonight. He just had his dinner. So he's fat and happy. I don't want kisses.
8564.40s: Because you smell like your food. Although it's very nice.
8570.00s: Hello, baby. I'm always curious like when I bring him up here like this, like what he actually sees.
8576.40s: Like what is he picking up other than he's tired. Yo, let's get your pump on. Yeah, he's getting
8584.72s: his pump on. It looks kind of like a bike.
8595.36s: Little bird.
8603.36s: Little little burpee boy.
8609.36s: Thoughts on signals on Tesla when cybertaxley actually becomes a thing.
8624.72s: Why was the why was the event disappointing?
8630.16s: I think it's the reason why the event was disappointing.
8649.92s: Last night Tesla had its long anticipated we robot event, the big unveiling event for their
8654.56s: upcoming robot taxis. And as you can see from this box, Hittis 8.8% decline today.
8659.52s: Let's just say it didn't go over well.
8660.96s: Oh, God.
8664.88s: I don't really the the fucking, I mean, I respect what he does. And I like his little like bored
8671.76s: and stuff, but I hate listening to it. I mean, it just seems like the.
8685.04s: Well, it doesn't really make sense.
8690.00s: Tommy says cybertaxley just hype and demo market needs concrete.
8694.72s: Yeah, but I mean, like that that actually surprises me that it would fall almost 9% from that.
8699.92s: Because that for me, that would beg the question like what the fuck was the market expecting there
8706.48s: to be this like what what were they expecting? This isn't an earnings release.
8712.32s: We know that this is a a general concept. So like what the fuck?
8721.36s: I don't know what they what they thought.
8724.24s: It was expecting robot taxis. So what was the actual thing? Is that not what he showed?
8731.20s: Again, I didn't watch it. So you guys will have to coach me on the target here.
8735.60s: This concept is since 2016.
8737.76s: I mean, yeah, I just I still don't get it though. Like I don't understand the 9% drop.
8746.24s: It's musk in his wild promises. It will only be here in two years.
8751.12s: I mean, musk is I don't know. I am a little bit of a musk fanboy. So musk in his wild promises is
8756.96s: probably he delivers on far more of them than I can think of just about anybody else.
8762.64s: And he thinks really big. So yeah, I don't really interpret it that way. But
8772.96s: let me see. Where is let me go to Tesla.
8780.64s: All right, let's see.
8798.16s: Is it all music?
8803.76s: Damn, like 50 minutes of this thing are
8810.00s: here.
8817.20s: From supervised full self driving to unsupervised full self driving where the car you could
8823.92s: fall asleep and wake up at your destination. Like that's really cool.
8830.64s: But there's also a challenge for a lot of people that cars cost too much. I mean,
8836.16s: I think the cost of autonomous transport will be so low that you can think of it like
8842.80s: individualized mass transit. The average cost of a bus per mile per city.
8851.36s: I'm sorry, I don't want to be a yes, yes, yes, all our cars basically, all cars that we make.
8858.56s: So one of the things that like is really interesting is how will this affect the cities that we live in?
8871.36s: You can have your own personal. This looks so cool. These things are, I mean, this is insane.
8880.08s: This is why I actually really, really rever Elon Musk is because like,
8885.04s: he's moving at a pace that just about nobody else can with this shit. So it's like, I don't know,
8890.80s: I have a ton of respect for what he's doing and his ability to move stuff. The, yeah, I don't know,
8898.56s: it's fucking incredible. I can't like just think of what nobody else is doing any of this shit.
8907.92s: Like that's the reality is there's so far fucking behind and he's not even necessarily,
8914.00s: you know, super close to it, right? He's talking about concepts here, but still like,
8920.32s: he's so far fucking ahead of everybody and everybody has the ability to compete with him,
8926.32s: right? Like there's a lot of big companies, but even if you look at Bezos and what they're trying
8932.56s: to do with what blue origin, like they're so far behind. It's, it's, I don't want to say it's
8938.48s: comical. That's kind of dramatic, but it is, they're very, very far behind, which I don't know,
8947.76s: like it, I think it puts Musk in such a, such a different atmosphere. So, yeah,
8958.96s: it's a cynical thought if Tesla had the goods, they wouldn't hold that to leave it. No, they're smart,
8965.92s: they're super smart. It's, it's very, very smart to do stuff like this. It's the same reason why
8971.28s: Apple does shut like this. Like building hype and stuff like that is, is a massive part of
8977.76s: drumming up interest. So, yeah, I mean, I think, I think it makes a ton of sense and it also makes
8985.36s: sense to talk about the vision of things so that people know like where your head's at, where
8990.80s: you're trying to go with things, that kind of stuff, I think matters a lot, especially when you're
8996.88s: trying to, he's making quite literally world changing stuff. Starlink is a complete game changer.
9005.20s: And that's nothing that Musk needed to do. A lot of other people could have done starlink.
9011.60s: It's not a crazy concept, but Musk did it and he did it really well. So, I look at a lot of
9017.84s: stuff that what he does is it's just insane. It's absolutely incredible.
9023.68s: That's because people remember Cybertruck being four years late, so this could be late. Sure,
9027.44s: it could be late. But I don't think that it like the, the robot taxi being late matters that much.
9034.80s: Again, that's why like when I see the movement today, I just think that's, that's
9040.00s: really heavily baked in for that kind of drop on something like that. That is the exact kind of
9045.52s: move that as soon as this starts to base a little bit, if it didn't have earnings, I would
9050.16s: absolutely play it to the upside because I don't, I don't buy that move for a minute.
9055.44s: But it's too early to tell because this is where the next low is. So we need to see
9066.00s: how it fares in here, which is it's too early plus it has earnings coming up. So, yeah.
9074.16s: Interesting. Find though. I actually need to watch that a little bit.
9078.56s: I'm kind of curious. Cool. All right, gang. The app's me up. I'm going to take
9083.92s: dog for a walk. Be an outlier. I'll see you all later.
