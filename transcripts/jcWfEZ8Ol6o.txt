360.00s:  you
390.00s:  you
420.00s:  evening like six or seven. I don't know whether or not I tell you that it's a lovely afternoon
426.30s:  or if it's a lovely evening. And I'm really hung up on that at the moment. So anybody
432.14s:  that could send help, that would be great. Corey says seven. So seven we call evening.
437.38s:  Okay. So it's afternoon. So happy on this beautiful afternoon. We have, let's say hello
447.02s:  to everybody. So we got roaring titty, the crowd favorite. Great to see you. We're going
451.04s:  titty. We got Corey Jimmy, Oli and we have that Lauren, Paulo. Great to see everybody.
463.08s:  Oli pop and says afternoon is still correct. Yeah, I feel like, I don't know, five, six starts
469.24s:  to feel like evening to me, but I don't know what the actual cutoff is. This is one of
473.84s:  those things where I feel like I have an idea of how it goes. And then clearly I have no
478.40s:  idea how it goes. So I'm going to do the logical thing. I'm going to ask chat GPT. What time
485.66s:  is considered afternoon and then evening. Let's see. Then we got Jonathan from North Carolina.
499.36s:  I have a buddy out there. I actually think he just recently moved, but it was a in Ashburn.
506.26s:  I think it was called from not mistaken. That's in North Carolina in it. Vladimir says sunset.
517.10s:  I think sunsets legit. Okay. So chat GPT says afternoon typically begins at 12. Yeah,
525.46s:  that's easy. In lasts until around five or six p.m. The exact transition can vary slightly
531.34s:  based on regional customs or personal preferences. But afternoon generally refers to the period
536.38s:  when the sun is still high in the sky after lunchtime. Yeah. Okay. Evening starts around five
541.96s:  or six and lasts until nine or just after sunset evening marks the transition period from
547.88s:  day to night when activities are winding down. Sun begins to set. Well, little little
553.74s:  did I know little did you know that if you work in the military when it's dark out,
560.30s:  that's actually when activities typically just start. So by that definition evening never
565.38s:  happens because that talks about activities winding down. That's just when the fun begins
570.42s:  because most of the people that we currently will we used to decide to fight don't have
575.88s:  fucking night vision. So it makes those kinds of interactions pretty one sided TBH. But
586.52s:  okay. So let us let's start with the market. That's what I wanted to start with. So this
595.60s:  week again, I'm just going to essentially pick up where we left off from yesterday.
600.44s:  So I am not going to talk about all the market relationships and all that kind of stuff.
605.76s:  I just really want to talk about the follow through today just because for anybody that's
611.04s:  interested in like the current market analysis, it's all bullshit anyways, right? It's just
615.40s:  making guesses at shit. But the thing that I do want to talk about are just the data pieces
622.60s:  that came out because those actually like genuinely do matter to us. So let's grab our
628.40s:  friends over at Benzinga. I'm going to change this setup here just a little bit because I don't
637.40s:  really care about the period. I care about the actual I care about the consensus and I care
643.44s:  about prior. That's what I care about the rest of that stuff is all just not okay. So we had
654.24s:  PPI and PPI came in. Is that right? Did PPI come in flat month over month? Is that correct?
662.28s:  I have to double check that. I haven't looked yet. But PPI flat. That's interesting. If that is the case,
674.28s:  let's see. Let's fact check to the shall we?
684.24s:  So this is telling me what's today? It's already fell off there. See, that's the one problem with
694.40s:  financial juice is that I like financial juice a lot. This is another economic website that I
702.12s:  use. I'm not affiliated with them. I used to be, but I'm not anymore. It's just like literally
708.00s:  laps. That's not because of any bad blood or didn't like their tool anymore. But one of the
715.12s:  issues I have with it is that it goes away too fast. It's 1700 Pacific time. I would love to be
721.60s:  able to go back even to see the whole week to be honest with you. Not even just the today. So
728.88s:  that's one of the problems with that in my opinion. But let's see. PPI month over month.
738.56s:  And let's see what it is. Yeah, okay. So zero zero percent. Okay.
744.80s:  So it's accurate. I just again, you guys have seen on these streams multiple times now where I look
750.00s:  at something. And then I find out it's inaccurate to some degree. So I double check just about everything,
758.32s:  even if it, especially if it's something that I don't fully trust in its entirety. And I have
764.72s:  any inkling that it might be slightly off. Then I'm going to double check it. So so yeah, PPI
773.28s:  came in zero percent, which was expected at 0.1 percent growth. We have to look at that a little
780.00s:  bit. So I'm actually not positive what I think about that. Let's check out Y charts.
788.32s:  Yeah, so that's about like flat flat.
800.56s:  I can't go back 10 years.
804.96s:  Am you? I don't know.
813.36s:  Vladimir says it's 2024 facts don't matter anymore. Just make shit up. I forgot.
817.44s:  That's it. No wonder why that trading is going so well for me lately because it's just a matter
824.48s:  of making it up. And then off Putin actually to double off of that, one of the things I've learned
830.24s:  that I really, really hate massively is the idea of manifesting. I have no problem with
836.16s:  visualization. And I'm sure that that is very close to manifesting. When I talk about manifesting,
841.20s:  I talk about the near term version of that or I guess like the more colloquial version.
846.40s:  Where it's like we just kind of like think and think about something that might happen. And we
851.44s:  think that the process of thinking about it is enough. And obviously it's not. So yeah, so there's
859.04s:  it's we can just manifest what we want to happen in the trading accounts. And then it just happens.
864.64s:  So we therefore just get to make shit up. Yeah, I love that. Mr. Off Putin. I think that's spot on.
871.28s:  But yeah, okay. So this has been pretty, pretty flat for a little while now. And let's take a look
878.88s:  actually from BLS. So goods is contracted and services expanded slightly.
892.80s:  Interesting. So PPI for final demand unchanged in September services rise.
902.72s:  0.02 goods 0.02. Let's see.
917.20s:  And next for final demand rose 1.8%.
926.40s:  So this I'm not going to lie, this is a little interesting to me like this came in slightly
930.72s:  different than expected. I had expected slight contraction, but I didn't expect it to be quite like
939.20s:  this. So most of September decrease in prices for unprocessed goods for intermediate demand can be
945.60s:  traced back to crude petroleum, which fell 16.7%. So that's that's interesting because production
952.40s:  is still pretty high there. Prices for ungraded chicken eggs. Have to be honest, you have to ask the
959.52s:  question, why are we tracking ungraded versus graded that I don't totally get. Slotter steers,
966.24s:  heifers, coal, fresh veggies, accept potatoes, recycle paper, moved down, index for slaughter,
973.52s:  poultry moved up 5.8%. Yes, he like, this is this is the interesting thing as they see it is that
979.52s:  like there's still lots of different pockets of movement that is different than I expected.
986.48s:  Very much so. So, Jonathan said recent videos with PB and Lauer or bangers, I'm glad. It's actually
996.24s:  funny because there's somebody hold on a second. I have to show you in the comments. Is this?
1006.40s:  Oh, it looks like two people. Not going to lie. Seems sus because both of these comments came in at
1013.52s:  like the same time. But let me show you this. It's kind of funny. So for those that liked the
1021.28s:  the podcast that I did both with PB and Lauer, let me show you in alternative view, which is our
1031.28s:  friend. Solon tro team who is letting me know that I'm a shale, which I'm very, very thankful for.
1042.16s:  And then active rehab mobility, which I have to be honest, I'm a little upset at this one
1048.40s:  because right now I am literally trying to actively rehab my mobility. And it sucks that the
1057.52s:  person that it seems like they could help me with that. They're also, um, calling me out,
1062.80s:  well, asking if I'm sure. Which obviously I would just answer them, right? Because they should know
1072.08s:  it's only fair for me to come clean since they peg me down. I think what I need to do is actually
1077.60s:  define shale. Because I think that this is probably one of the most crazy misuse terms now.
1088.24s:  Yeah, that's what I thought.
1090.08s:  Shale.
1098.08s:  The shale is someone who promotes or endorses a product service or cause in a deceptive or dishonest
1103.92s:  manner. Interesting. Okay. Well, we just have to let rehab mobility and
1114.80s:  chill on tro team. The other thing that I can't help but find kind of interesting is this.
1122.80s:  It looks like they, here's my guess genuinely. And this is the funny thing about people.
1128.80s:  I, these comments came in at like the same time. So my guess is this one came in same time as this
1134.32s:  one. I think this is the same person. And I literally think this person wanted to respond to
1140.08s:  this person, but forgot to switch their fucking account. That's my guess. I have nothing to validate
1145.68s:  any of that. But I just think it's hilarious. I literally think it's hilarious if that is the case.
1152.08s:  That's my favorite. So shout out to these guys. You should definitely pop over to the YouTube
1157.84s:  channel, give them a sub just because I mean, this guy's ready. They're starting to build their
1162.32s:  audience, right? They're they're rolling in deep. So shout out to them.
1167.20s:  Polarious. All right. Back to this though.
1177.84s:  That Lauren says heffers. Yeah, man, I know. It's like one of those words that it's weird to hear
1182.24s:  used. But yeah, that's a fucking word now.
1186.24s:  Wrong to, he says, graded or probably processed and ready for sale, unprocessed.
1190.88s:  Probably have been collected but not checked for suitability for sale yet.
1195.76s:  Interesting. So graded is the idea. So grading is just applied to whether or not it's processed.
1204.72s:  Right. So are you guessing or are you telling me because I don't know. That sounds legit. But
1211.36s:  but if you tell me that, I would believe you, if you're guessing, we can check it because I don't
1215.52s:  know the difference. What's the difference between graded and ungraded chicken eggs?
1227.52s:  This is admittedly one of genuinely one of my favorite parts about markets is right now I'm in
1235.84s:  the process of learning about chicken egg grading. One of the coolest things that you'll find as a
1244.16s:  trader or investor in the markets is that it is one of the most interesting lenses to learn about
1250.96s:  the world. And you will learn about so fucking much. It'll make your head spin. Okay.
1260.72s:  So graded eggs are they go through a quality inspection process where they
1267.36s:  assessed for external and internal factors. Shells quality, yolk, and albuming condition.
1274.32s:  So there's grade AA grade A grade B. And ungraded eggs have no official inspection. They're not
1284.32s:  inspected or rated according to quality. This happens with farm, fresh, or backyard eggs sold at
1291.44s:  local markets or directly from farms. So I think the main thing is you actually like farm
1301.04s:  fresh eggs then would still be sold. But they're just they don't go through an inspection process.
1308.48s:  So rowing titty to your to your point that would lead me to believe that if you're getting your
1316.48s:  farm fresh eggs, there's a chance you might get a little more protein in it. There's a little baby
1319.84s:  chicken in there might have a crunch. You know what I mean?
1330.24s:  That's what it looks like. Interesting. And there's those three grades.
1334.48s:  AA and B. I don't know why it has like why. Who invented that? Like I don't actually get it
1344.56s:  because why couldn't it just be ABC? Like that's a pretty standard fucking thing.
1350.56s:  Interesting. All Putin says why do they refrigerate eggs in the US but almost nowhere else in the
1360.88s:  world? That's due to the washing process. So there's a this is actually funny that I know this.
1367.36s:  There's a outer part of the egg called a cuticle like the cuticle of your nail. And that washing
1372.96s:  process strips the cuticle away. So when that cuticle is stripped away, then the egg is more prone
1380.00s:  to decaying salmonella bacterial and stuff like that. So off Putin, that's why we refrigerate eggs
1388.56s:  in the US is because ours are inspected washed a certain way. And once you go through that washing,
1395.52s:  it strips away the cuticle. I don't know. Like I'm kind of thinking about what the fuck I'm talking
1404.88s:  about and thinking how useless of a data point that is like think of think of a good piece of
1410.88s:  information that I could have just remembered right then instead of understanding the fucking
1415.68s:  cuticle of an egg. Not my proudest moment, but yeah, okay. Don't feel a little weird about it.
1425.28s:  Oh, see, Paulo has it. I didn't notice. Yeah, okay, good. I didn't read the comments. So
1431.44s:  Paulo, you're also a fucking nerd. I love that. Off Putin says my guess is that a little poop is
1440.00s:  gross to Americans. Have to be honest, I hope it is to you as well. That's standard sanitation,
1450.24s:  like especially on something that I intend to consume. I would prefer it to be fecal free as it were.
1458.56s:  I don't know. Maybe if we need to like start a movement for Putin, wherever you're from,
1464.56s:  but something like fecal free would be okay, something like that.
1471.68s:  But yeah, you that's I think that should be a universal thing that we that we are generally
1478.80s:  concerned with at least to a degree in my humble opinion. All right. So the last thing I want to talk
1486.72s:  about from a market perspective is let's take a look at the the grid here. One of the things that I
1493.04s:  started noticing is that this is using ADR this here. So if we take a look at IWM, let me blow it
1504.96s:  up a little bit here. Big, big, big, big, big breakout. You have seen this on my chart for some time
1514.88s:  now. So this is something from I actually don't remember when I drew this. But if we go back far
1523.44s:  enough, we can see when I first started drawing this channel, but a massive breakout from this
1529.60s:  channel. Now the reason why this is interesting to me is because this is one of the most quintessential
1536.80s:  breakout patterns that you can absolutely trade. I traded just the move today. I used futures.
1541.92s:  It was an intraday trade. I still have about two thirds of the position on. But this is something
1549.28s:  that I talked about not too long ago yesterday. I talked about another trade that exhibit similar
1554.56s:  similar tendencies to this kind of style of setup. But this is a standard breakout play. So
1562.00s:  the profit mechanism as I look at something like this is velocity. It's something that starts to
1569.52s:  get really, really constrained in price. And then sooner or later, it makes a big decision.
1575.12s:  And that's exactly what happened today. I had a 2% day on the day for the index. And as soon as I
1581.04s:  started seeing this move, this very one-sided candle, this led to a series of other trades.
1588.00s:  And I'll show you. Because if you go into the heat map, you go within the rustle. Take a look at
1596.56s:  where you see super bright green. You can see this happen right on the day. The other thing that we
1605.68s:  should take a look at for something like this is where you see red. The reason why it matters to
1611.92s:  look for red on days like today is because it's giving you views on stocks that are clearly
1618.96s:  bucking the broader trend. So by looking at a heat map like this, we get to do two things.
1625.60s:  The first thing we get to do is find leaders that are driving price performance.
1631.92s:  The second thing you get to do is find weak stocks that are slowing or moving against the broader
1640.96s:  trend despite the amount of support that there is for the movement. Because the other thing I want
1647.12s:  you to notice is take a look at the individual sectors. Do you notice anything interesting
1655.36s:  about the sectors in general? Any guesses? I want you to specifically focus on what the
1664.72s:  relationship looks like in terms of the number of red that you see within the different sectors.
1677.12s:  Then I'm updating the time stamps for whoever else ends up watching this in the future
1683.44s:  so that they can skip past all the random bullshitting in the beginning.
1694.32s:  There we go.
1699.44s:  Corey says crypto huge exactly. Rointitys says one sector has no red exactly. That's exactly correct.
1706.48s:  Joey says small amounts of red in each sector. That's also correct. So one thing to note is that
1712.24s:  financials that's this whole sector. So there's definitely red in financials just to be clear.
1718.08s:  These are just different kinds of reats and stuff like that. But the main points is if we look at
1725.68s:  the performance of the sectors, this is literally the process of being a trader is coming up with
1732.24s:  these broader themes that stick out to us from a macro broader perspective, not macroeconomic macro
1738.80s:  market perspective and use it to define ideas. So one of the things you hide up you highlighted
1745.84s:  is financials. Financials look super strong today. Where's the weakness in financials?
1751.36s:  In real estate, ABR, REIT, PMT, REIT, too, very much real estate, heavy, MFA, REIT, RC, REIT,
1761.28s:  you get the point. REITs are not doing great. So when we look at financials in general, they're
1767.76s:  doing quite well. If we take a look at something like information technology, you can see that there's
1774.48s:  a little bit more of a mixed bag here. We can see that there's some strong performers, but there's
1781.12s:  also kind of a mix of not super strong performers and then some slightly negative performers.
1789.12s:  Learning to look with a purpose is so important for your evolution as a trader. When we look at stuff
1800.08s:  like this, we should not open up a heat map and think, oh, I want to see if I can find blank,
1810.80s:  blank being whatever your preconceived notion might be. What our objective is when we do this
1820.24s:  is to find tradable information. Some of that tradable information is going to be indirect,
1828.00s:  meaning I might look at financials and decide, okay, I'm going to trade financials. That's direct.
1833.76s:  Or I might look at financials and just mentally note financials are strong. Maybe I'll scan
1839.60s:  and set up some alerts for financials, but maybe not place a trade right now. That's indirect.
1845.20s:  Both of those are completely useful data points for you to house in your brain and specifically
1852.24s:  your subconscious. So the other thing, again, when you're looking at heat maps, we want to look at
1857.28s:  breath, meaning across the board, what does the tenor look like? And again, when we look at small caps,
1862.88s:  most of it's up. How many of them are very bright green, meaning larger up moves? A good bit of
1869.36s:  them. If I were to eyeball this, I would guess maybe 15% something like that, 20% if that.
1875.76s:  How many of them are green compared to red? It looks like a decent majority, probably 70, 75%.
1882.64s:  So by just eyeballing this, I'm not taking the time to download all the information, to run it
1889.44s:  through Python and see the individual details, although we can, and there's different ways to look at
1894.32s:  that. I'm just eyeballing. The other thing that I'll do, as I already mentioned, is I will look
1900.32s:  at what is showing really great moves. And I want to see why. Is it something that's pertaining to
1906.96s:  the entire sector? Or is it something pertaining to the individual stock? So for example, IT,
1913.12s:  MSTR, obviously, it's 16% today. This is very not representative of most of this sector.
1922.24s:  Most of this sector is up, but it's not up huge like this. So then we have to begs the question,
1929.20s:  what's going on with MSTR? And we already know MSTR is full of idioms and
1934.08s:  critic risk. So it's kind of like looking at a specific piece of the overall tech sector from
1940.96s:  the small cap side of things. This, in my opinion, is not indicative of all small caps. And it's
1947.36s:  showing me that the IT sector right now is being moved within small caps by something like this.
1956.40s:  That's the idea. So this is the way that we can use heat maps to come up with ideas.
1965.36s:  All right, let me catch up on the chat. James says, M2K futures or something else. I didn't use
1970.88s:  the minis because I wasn't building a position over time. So I used RTY.
1979.28s:  We're referring to the to the Russell scalp today. And it's not a scalp to be clear,
1983.76s:  intraday trade. I use scalp in the common parlance just because people will more accurately
1992.16s:  identify what I mean by that. So yeah, I just use Russell futures. We got Joey. Good to see you,
1997.84s:  Joey. Paul says, what are those reds and industrials? Yeah, see, look. And that's a great
2005.76s:  thing to look for. NVEE, EPF, and rock. Oh, rock. That's a fun one. So let's take a look at these.
2013.36s:  So we want to look at NVEE, data split. We have rock, gap down,
2030.00s:  EBF, massive gap down. Looks like dividend. CMRE,
2043.68s:  slowly rotating down, GNK, same, SB, same. So the thing for me when I look at this structure
2056.88s:  within industrials is it's not exactly where I necessarily want to fade. So like this starts to look
2065.44s:  a little more interesting to me. When I'm looking for sectors that I want to fade within,
2070.72s:  I'm going to look for stuff that looks sad. Consumer discretionary looks kind of sad. Energy still
2076.96s:  looks a little bit sad. Com services looks a little bit sad. Let's take a look in consumer discretionary.
2082.96s:  There's not a bunch of stuff that's making like crazy big down moves, but there's also not a bunch
2087.36s:  of stuff making really big up moves. So we can look for stuff that's making bigger moves like
2092.08s:  W, W. Who here says W as W?
2102.16s:  I mean, I don't even know what to do with that other than nothing.
2106.56s:  Shack. No shack. D-nut. If you got that reference that I just did, let me know.
2116.16s:  F-L. Ooh, see like this I like. This I like. I love this.
2127.20s:  Create an alert at or below. If you fall below that, fade into oblivion.
2135.92s:  That's the rule.
2143.84s:  Sorry gang, the old up, the old sciatica. Still still proven some problems here.
2152.72s:  We're we're working through it, but it's slow as shit. I have to be honest with you.
2159.84s:  It is a much slower healing process than I would like to admit, but that's how she goes.
2168.96s:  That Lawrence is why do you like it? Well, let's talk about it. What's everybody's opinion of it?
2173.68s:  Give me in the chat. Doesn't have to be like a massive word picture, but give me a couple things
2180.00s:  that you see about the stock and what your disposition is towards the stock. And then I'll explain
2186.96s:  to you why I like it. This is the exact kind of thing you can already see that I I set an alert.
2199.84s:  This is how I trade in general is I use alerts all the time. It's how I find stuff that looks
2209.36s:  interesting before it's actually doing the interesting thing so that then I can try to get into it
2216.96s:  when it's doing the interesting thing because otherwise that's one of the big issues that I see with
2222.00s:  people is that there's a pretty significant gap in entry timing. And I think that it's kind of a
2232.32s:  actually a pretty profound problem if I think of it from a slightly larger perspective.
2238.32s:  So that's the idea behind this is to find things that are moving in a way that I can trade them
2245.76s:  but before they make a move so I can set alerts so that then I can catch them. For those that were
2251.28s:  on the live stream yesterday, I posted about this in the discord following up with you all.
2255.76s:  Gold. Gold last night while we were on that live stream kicked off an alert and I literally stopped
2261.36s:  in the middle of the live stream to put on my position in gold. And it's because I have an alert
2268.00s:  that's sitting that then I can identify a move. All right. Paul says bearish. Zack says down trend
2281.36s:  higher highs and lows. Yep. So it's definitely breaking down.
2284.32s:  I said, I would look for a bounce but I know that is stupid. Yeah, that is stupid.
2291.52s:  That's not to say it's stupid in the fact that like it couldn't get a bounce. It can get a bounce.
2296.64s:  But it's stupid in the fact that that's applying a really, really, really broken down expectation
2306.24s:  of price performance. And that comes from the bargain buying side of a standard traders brain.
2314.48s:  A normal trader will think of things as being at extremes and then play contrarian because we think
2321.44s:  it's gone too far. Stuff like that, which yeah, typically isn't super favorable.
2330.96s:  Reese says, hey, we still have eyesight. Love that podcast and stoicism. Oh, that's awesome.
2334.88s:  I'm glad that that was good. Kyle and I, we go back a while actually. He's one of my, my,
2341.12s:  better friends in the finance space. You guys should definitely make sure you check his stuff out
2346.16s:  when you can because Kyle is a relatively new trader himself, but he's a prior Navy guy.
2353.60s:  And he's just so unbelievably authentic and genuine in the space that it's, it's just,
2360.96s:  it's why I draw it to him like a magnet. He and I used to do a regular series on his podcast.
2367.04s:  And then we did a series together on my pot or it wasn't really a podcast. It was just on my
2371.28s:  YouTube channel. We did a bunch of things on my YouTube channel. We did like a teaching
2374.48s:  to options trade together. Then we used to do service reviews for different trading services.
2380.32s:  And we would dig into those. But yeah, Kyle, he's just a super genuine dude. He's still figuring out
2385.84s:  his approach to trading. And he's, he's just unbelievably honest in a space that I think most people
2394.72s:  really, really struggle with being honest because a lot of people aren't used to the idea of
2401.28s:  being like quote unquote, a knowledgeable authority figure in something, but still acknowledging
2406.88s:  the fact that we don't know everything. And it's okay to not know shit. I actually think it's
2412.24s:  important for people. I go out of my way to show people when I don't know stuff all the time.
2417.12s:  It's it's it's very purposeful because there's this really bad notion that if you develop
2423.52s:  eminence and something, it means that you're infallible and know everything about it. And I
2429.52s:  tell you, I tell you this all the time for context, right? I started trading in 2007.
2435.60s:  I've been in markets. I'm coming up on my 17th year. I typically track my hours per year. I haven't
2441.60s:  finished up this year, but I'll probably be about like 33 to 34,000 hours analyzing trading markets.
2448.56s:  A lot of time. And I still don't know a ton of shit. And I want you to see that. I want you to see
2457.76s:  that it's okay to not know. It's okay to have experience in something and still not know details
2465.52s:  because again, as soon as we can break that part away from our ego, the better off you are.
2472.80s:  Because that's the only reason why I would go out of my way to pretend like I know everything
2479.12s:  or that I always have everything under wraps because the entire concept about that is it's just so
2486.88s:  that people's perception of me isn't changed in some way, which is most of you probably know at
2493.20s:  this point, like I generally don't give a fuck. My, my, I am who I am, I am what I am. So
2500.56s:  and I think it's important for people to see that because the aspiration of knowing everything I
2505.28s:  think is completely flawed. And when we look at mastery of markets, it comes from continually not
2510.96s:  knowing shit and learning about it. So Kyle is a fantastic representation of that because he's
2518.16s:  spent a lot of time really trying to learn this trading skill set like pretty massively. And he's
2524.40s:  still so approachable and he acknowledges his own fallibility all the time. And it's rare to find
2532.64s:  really like authentic people like that. He does this stuff the same reason why I do this stuff is
2537.68s:  that he genuinely just fucking loves markets. And he loves the process of trading. And there's not
2544.24s:  a lot of people like that out there. Like if you look at the trading space, it's generally,
2550.96s:  especially like the bigger brands, it's what you would expect. It's people that are trying to
2555.28s:  make money explicitly off of their audience. And I don't want to say there's anything wrong with
2562.32s:  that. There's nothing wrong with that. It's okay if you're sharing your expertise learned over time
2568.48s:  if you are providing that and there's an exchange. That's how we do everything. If I pay for
2574.72s:  somebody to come out and to do my roof, I expect to not just pay them for the materials. I expect
2581.60s:  to pay them for their time, for their expertise to be able to do it faster than I could do it.
2586.40s:  So there's no problem with people that are like that trying to sell their stuff, whatever that is,
2592.64s:  if it's a book that they have, whatever. That's okay. But there's a lot of predatory practices
2598.16s:  that prey on people's ignorance. That's where it sucks. Super, super bad. And that's why I did that
2604.96s:  trading review thing for a little bit. Because when I did the trading service review stuff, it wasn't
2611.92s:  to shame any individual service at all. The whole idea actually was to just try and teach people
2619.84s:  how to evaluate a service for themselves. It's the same thing that I try to help with the
2624.56s:  trading side of things. I'm not sitting here trying to show anybody what to trade, when to trade,
2628.96s:  nothing like that. The last possible thing I do, nothing I give is financial, personalized
2633.28s:  financial advice. I absolutely give financial advice with the context of telling people that
2640.32s:  saving is good. Like you should save your money. Shit like that. And that's still general advice.
2646.48s:  And that's I think important to share with each other. But like personalized, I do none of that.
2652.00s:  Because the whole idea is to try to teach people how to do this shit for themselves, which
2657.76s:  that's a tough gig. A lot of people struggle to do something like trading by themselves.
2663.68s:  And it takes time. But unfortunately newer traders don't know what they don't know. And they get sucked
2669.44s:  into one of these spheres that then just puts them through a series of giving money away. And I
2675.52s:  genuinely fucking hate that. It drives me crazy. Super frustrating to see.
2684.08s:  That Lauren says, I know a lot of stuff about hair. I've been doing that for 26 years. This
2689.60s:  stuff hurts my brain, but I'm learning. Okay, Lauren, if you know shit, if you know stuff about hair,
2696.64s:  why does my hair grow at an alarmingly annoying pace? Because I hate getting a fucking haircut
2706.32s:  every week to two weeks. It's super annoying. My hair's too long right now. I don't like that.
2711.36s:  So would riddle me that Batman because I would love for that to chill the fuck out.
2719.52s:  Vladimir's there was a question from Zach. Okay, Zach says, stupid question, how are you able to
2724.64s:  put on a position in gold after hours? I only trade gold ETFs. Yeah, they still trade.
2729.84s:  So different futures markets will have different trading hours. You can check with your broker.
2734.48s:  So like, for example, let me look at Schwab futures trading hours. During the week, they close down
2742.40s:  for just a brief bit after the after the market closes and then they open right back up. So
2748.72s:  oh, here you go. Equity futures goes Sunday to Friday from 1800 to 1700. So there's a one-hour
2758.56s:  break between 1700 and 1800 Eastern time. For commodities like crude oil, gold, they go
2766.88s:  Sunday to Friday. Overnight trading starts at 1800 on Sunday and continues until 1700 on Friday.
2777.84s:  With the one-hour break from 1700 to 1800 each day. And then treasury bonds, this is for Schwab.
2786.72s:  Same schedule essentially. So that's one of the benefits of trading futures. And that's actually
2792.32s:  another thing that I think a lot of traders don't fully pay attention to. And the reason for that
2801.36s:  is because if let's say you have a portfolio on and it's one of the reasons why I'm more comfortable
2806.80s:  using leverage is because I can always track my beta-weighted portfolios and make adjustments.
2813.28s:  So let's take a look at Eric's special.
2816.96s:  Well, you already know the next question. It's probably the biggest question that we're
2838.88s:  going to cross together here. You guys already know. Oh, shit, Rowan Titty. Yeah, great call.
2854.08s:  So I like this for a breakdown trade. So when I look at the overall trend here on a six-month chart,
2861.60s:  well, go out to a year first. On a year we had a high below lower high, right? Like this really
2868.24s:  choppy choppy movement. If I zoom in to a shorter term time frame, we can see that it peaked up here,
2877.36s:  gap down on earnings that wasn't well received. It came in at negative five cents. It was estimated
2883.68s:  at negative seven seven zero point seven or I'm sorry point zero seven seven rally down, hit
2889.84s:  a low, rallyed up lower high, rally down, lower low. So now I like this just for a breakdown
2897.28s:  continuation. That's all. And we can see that volatility in here is massive, right? So if we
2903.12s:  look at a five-day average ATRs 3.56%, 20 days 4.74% and then 90 days 5.46%. So pretty, pretty
2914.48s:  significant overall volatility in here, something like this. Paula says, would you take fundamentals
2921.36s:  into account in this FL trade? No, not at all. Fundamentals for me for the time frame,
2926.88s:  fundamentals for me matter if I'm trading something that's going to be like a year plus,
2931.68s:  which is about nothing. So for me, fundamentals are generally just for context. It's again,
2937.68s:  just because I'm genuinely interested. So when I look at the earnings and I go through the earnings
2942.16s:  report, it's not to build up some sort of big bear thesis thinking I'm going to find something in
2946.96s:  the earnings report that other people didn't see and they're not pricing in because it doesn't
2951.20s:  matter, right? When I look at the way markets move in different time frames, if you have a company
2957.68s:  that's showing solid, fundamental performance and it's continuing to grow, meaning fundamentals
2962.64s:  are growing, that means that the company is growing. That's about all you need. And that means for
2967.60s:  longer term holdings that the company is more likely to appreciate and value than depreciate.
2972.88s:  All context dependent. From a trading perspective, where my average holding time for stuff is like
2979.52s:  AB6 weeks and that's on the long side, most of my holdings for like the past two, three years
2985.52s:  have been less than two weeks. So there's obviously a longer term holdings than that for sure,
2991.60s:  but I'm talking on average across the majority of the trades. So when I analyze this,
2998.80s:  the fundamentals are baked into the price. That's what it boils down to. The fundamentals as it
3004.80s:  sits today are baked into the price. And the thing that's more important for this is when we have
3014.88s:  movement, that's what I'm trading. The reason for the movement is not predicated on the fundamentals,
3024.32s:  quite literally at all. So for example, some of the movement that we can see in footlocker over the
3031.52s:  last two through two, three weeks, literally, I don't know what's causing it. Obviously, it's going
3036.96s:  down. So it tells me people are selling it. Why they're selling it? It doesn't ultimately matter to
3042.48s:  me. Other than I'm just curious about it, and it does provide a little bit of context for the move.
3047.28s:  But the fundamentals themselves don't really matter in this circumstance because it let's just say
3054.64s:  another scenario where it had really, really great fundamentals, fantastic fundamentals. And it
3061.68s:  looked like it was growing massively quarter over quarter year over year. It's like it looks super
3067.84s:  good. If it's going down, it's fucking going down. Like that's it. If it's going down because a big
3073.84s:  hedge fund doesn't want their position anymore, that's why it's going down. If it's going down because
3079.04s:  they got sued because their CEO did some shit that he's not supposed to. I'm not saying that that
3084.24s:  happened. I don't think it did. But that's why it's going down. So from a trading perspective, we,
3091.12s:  the fundamentals largely are going to be priced in. That's what typically has us about where we're at.
3098.16s:  And then the broader market is going to respond to fundamentals differently depending on their
3102.24s:  position durations because think of the average hedge fund or mutual fund or pension fund.
3109.92s:  They're not going to float in and out of the stuff like I would as a trader, the vast majority,
3115.60s:  the vast majority of money moves very, very slow. And it's because it takes time to broker a deal
3120.64s:  to get into a position to scale into the position at size. Then to make sure that all your compliance
3125.36s:  is in place like all that stuff and then add regulation on top of it means big money moves slow.
3131.76s:  So because big money moves slow, that's why we see this kind of information in discreteness
3137.68s:  where price takes time to move to different points. And it's why we have things like under
3142.48s:  reaction and overreaction. Those are tradable events in the market. So all of that boils down to
3150.32s:  it doesn't fucking matter what anything is saying or going on. What matters is what price is doing.
3156.48s:  That's it. That is the only thing that matters to us as traders because I could fundamentally value
3166.08s:  this company and it could go down. Easy. Why would it go down? Litany of factors. So if we're building
3177.84s:  an investment thesis, that's completely different because in an investment thesis,
3184.48s:  we're thinking shorter term positioning has to sort itself out. And if I'm investing for a year
3191.84s:  plus, I don't care about this $10 move. I really don't because as long as the fundamentals and
3198.88s:  the company is still growing and moving in line with expectations on a longer term time frame,
3203.92s:  which this is not. But let's pretend it was going up into the right. Well, that's a completely
3209.92s:  different story. A good example of that is if we look at something like Nvidia, and I'm using my
3215.92s:  little grip tool. So my hands are starting to slow down already. So if we look at Nvidia,
3224.00s:  and we'd look at like this period here, right? Not a huge down move, but not insignificant. And then
3231.44s:  it's kind of been trending sideways. It hasn't hit new highs quite yet. But I mean, like,
3236.08s:  look at the movement. It's absolutely beautiful. It's slightly broken down, but it's still overall good
3242.40s:  where we had a high. We had a pullback correction essentially posted a low, ran up to a high,
3248.96s:  posted a higher low, trended sideways posted a slightly lower high. That's not a great look,
3255.36s:  but that happens sometimes. Trends down a little bit, catches on the MA starts to rally up and out.
3261.36s:  And now it's moving closer to all time highs. All of that is movement from a trading perspective
3271.36s:  that doesn't really matter for an investor. Because if you look at this from an investment
3277.04s:  perspective, the answer is just buy. You buy whenever you feel like it and you hold on to it,
3282.64s:  because as long as it continues to grow as it should, that's ultimately what matters. So
3289.60s:  the biggest lesson from this entire section of the video is that you have to define what kind
3296.32s:  of investment thesis you're applying and what's the corresponding time frame. Because if I'm
3302.40s:  going to trade on something that I'm using a three year daily chart, fundamentals matter,
3306.48s:  guaranteed. If I'm trading something where I'm looking at a three month chart, fundamentals
3311.84s:  do not matter. There's nothing about fundamentals that matter to me in this time frame. So
3319.76s:  creating alignment between those is exceedingly important, I think.
3327.44s:  All right.
3330.48s:  Reese says I've spent so much time grasping options. It seems like another world, but there
3335.28s:  are essentially options, contracts, right? Futures. No. Futures are different. So futures are another
3342.08s:  type of derivative. There's a bunch of different. If you think of securities, I actually have a slide
3346.80s:  for this. In Erick's, you already know what it is. Erick's handy-dandy abomination of a slide deck.
3359.76s:  Oh yeah, this is an upcoming video I'm going to do. But what am I looking for? Markets,
3367.44s:  something like this is somewhere in here? Where's it at? There you go. There you go.
3380.32s:  Securities. So you can see within the basket of securities in the market, there are kind of a
3388.80s:  couple big buckets. There's actually a few more than this. But inside of derivatives,
3395.60s:  there are options, futures, swaps, convertibles. There's Bermudian, Bermudian options. There's a lot
3408.88s:  of different kinds of derivatives that live in here. So futures are a different kind of
3416.80s:  derivative than options. They're very different. And there's actually options on futures. So there's
3425.20s:  a derivative on a derivative as well. Royntady says farmers use futures to sell their products. They
3435.20s:  actually don't. Yeah, they typically don't. Farmers, the advent of futures was actually to essentially
3444.24s:  add stability to commodities prices. So essentially, a futures contract is similar to option
3453.28s:  in that there's a contract between two parties. And it pertains to a specific asset for a time
3458.88s:  in the future. And the general purpose is if I'm a farmer and I'm trying to sell corn and then
3468.56s:  there's a grocery store that's going to use the corn, we can both add stability to our lives.
3476.00s:  If I talk to that grocery store and I set up an agreement with them where next year, I'm going
3481.92s:  to deliver to you X amount of crop and it will call it X or we'll call it Y value. So it's to
3490.24s:  stabilize price. Now the way that farmers and agriculture will use them now is literally to
3497.68s:  primarily hedge their selling of the products. So you can see this expressed in this. Let me move
3510.32s:  this over here. Get rid of this here. So you can go to the commitment of traders report and you can
3522.96s:  look at something like wheat. And you'll notice something based on this. So you can look at the
3534.40s:  relationship between producers and speculators. So producers are going to be these red lines. And
3543.84s:  you notice how speculators are kind of the inverse. And then you'll notice that non commercials are
3549.20s:  kind of like this fucking middle of the middle of the road group. So what's happening here is
3556.64s:  commercials when they're buying stuff up like this that doesn't mean that they think that their
3564.64s:  underlying contract is going to appreciate in value and that they're going to sell the contract
3570.40s:  for a profit. That's actually not what they want. What they want is that value, the contract to just
3576.72s:  be there as a hedge and then to be able to conduct their business and then to sell things at prices
3582.24s:  that make sense for them. So this is a big thing if you look at something like airlines, they will
3587.84s:  use futures and trading activities to hedge the cost of fuel, which is highly variable. It creates a
3596.64s:  bubble for them and a general planning factor if they hedge their risk with respect to price changes.
3604.08s:  So futures are a little bit different in that sense in terms of like what their construction is.
3611.52s:  But the way to think about futures, they're kind of like a delta one variant of options for the
3618.00s:  base contracts. So you can use futures to trade things that you can't trade with options directly.
3624.64s:  So for example, that gold trade that I talked about yesterday, you can't trade gold outright with
3633.28s:  other securities. You can't trade the commodity itself. That's literally what futures were for
3638.48s:  is to trade the commodities themselves. So for something like that gold trade, it pertains to a certain
3646.32s:  amount of gold, physical gold. So Reese says in their leverage to the tits, some of them, yeah,
3655.52s:  some of them, not all of them. And options can also provide the same or more leverage in certain
3662.24s:  circumstances. It entirely depends on the position. So it's relative. And that's a common misconception
3669.52s:  about futures is that people think that futures are this insanely, you know, jack to the tits
3677.12s:  leveraged product. And some of them are big. Some of them are not big. So yeah, yes and no is the
3687.12s:  answer. Some things can move a lot. Some things cannot move a lot. And there's a difference between
3692.96s:  the amount of leverage something provides and also its volatility because you have to keep in mind,
3698.64s:  you can have something that might perceivably pertain to a lower dollar amount, but have a much more
3706.00s:  leverage tied to it. So this is a common thing that you'll find with net gas. Net gas is always
3713.84s:  touted as like the widow maker. It's like this big terrible thing. Net gas is not that bad. It
3719.52s:  really is not that bad. What's bad about net gas is people confuse it. And they misunderstand
3728.08s:  periods of complacency as great times to put on way oversized positions. And then every once in a
3737.68s:  while something like net gas becomes super busy, like a lot of other things. So people misposition
3746.24s:  notoriously in something like net gas. But if we look at the volatility of something like net gas
3751.92s:  compared to other stuff, it's really not that crazy. But people are mispositioned and they trade
3762.08s:  really poorly around it. Because there's a reality here. We can see net gas hit a low of 144
3772.24s:  back in 2020. And it literally hit 10 in 2022. That is a massive move on a relative basis for
3783.92s:  a commodity. That's a giant move. So one of the issues I think is people just misposition pretty
3792.80s:  pretty frequently, even big firms because they don't always fully respect hail risk is what it boils
3799.04s:  down to. James says in futures, try starting with MES is it moves like spy and the multiplier is
3808.56s:  small so you won't get surprised. Yeah, I think that that's fair. I mean, in my opinion, I would
3813.52s:  just paper trade them. You already know that answer. There's no reason to start trading futures
3817.92s:  at all before paper trading them for a year plus. There's literally no reason not to. Because
3825.76s:  the problem with futures is that there are a lot of other elements that people don't really understand.
3832.96s:  Like, for example, carry. There's an optimal time to roll a futures contract depending on what
3839.36s:  it is based on the carry, which is a cost that you pay to hold it, but it's an indirect cost.
3846.16s:  So I think Roryntiti says, where can you pay for paper trade futures without paying a subscription?
3853.68s:  fucking Excel dog. Open up a Google sheet. There's and just track your own shit.
3861.04s:  There's zero reason to paper trade in a paper trading platform. Literally zero reason.
3867.92s:  Paper trading in a paper trading platform is it's literally pure silliness because you're not
3876.08s:  going to get real fills. And the data is gone. As soon as you hit reset, it's gone. Just open up Excel
3884.24s:  and paper trade in there. That's literally exactly what I do. I'm starting to move some of my
3889.52s:  stuff over to Google sheets. So it's a little more portable. But for like the bigger data sets that I
3895.04s:  track, I still use Excel just because it's much faster than Google sheets. And it's exactly what I do.
3900.48s:  Yeah.
3903.76s:  Roryntiti says, first he wants me to save. Now he wants me to do data entry. I roll. Yeah,
3909.68s:  exactly. I hear you. That's the that's the plight of being a trader. I know. Hold on.
3916.88s:  You already know. This is the perfect time to promote my my biggest most bangerous videos.
3924.72s:  This one. Whoa. I think last time we spoke, this video had 200 views. And I want to be
3937.28s:  at 310 now. This is from 21 September. So that video is about flying off the shelf as fast as you can.
3945.84s:  If there was a video to watch, I would I would watch that one before YouTube decides that it's too
3956.00s:  hot. And YouTube might pull it down because of how many views it's gotten. It could be too big
3961.36s:  of a video. So yeah, I think futures are completely, completely fine to to tinker with in Excel.
3971.28s:  But I like, I wouldn't jump into them. There's no reason to jump into them. There's slight benefits to
3977.76s:  them. But I would you got to focus. If you're trying to learn about trading options,
3983.04s:  going into futures, it's not the right place to go. It's genuinely not. And it's because there's
3988.24s:  just added, there's added complexity. That's not difficult to learn. It's entirely easy to learn.
3995.28s:  But it's added complexity that just slows down the broader learning process.
4001.12s:  So yeah, that's that's exactly why I think futures are fine. And if you feel like you have a good
4006.88s:  understanding of options and you kind of get the world of derivatives, then there's no problem with
4010.88s:  starting to venture into into some future stuff. But futures have really important production
4016.08s:  cycles that you have to be aware of so that you don't get on the wrong side of essentially the
4020.48s:  futures version of binary events. And shit like that, it can it just catches people off, I think.
4026.32s:  So I would try to avoid those instances.
4030.88s:  James says, great thing on futures is if you're account as small, there's no PDT.
4035.36s:  Genuinely didn't know that. That's actually great for me to know.
4040.32s:  Yeah, I think, yeah, that's fascinating. I think traders trying to get around the PDT rule
4047.68s:  is always silly. I know I did the same thing. But the PDT rule is not it's really not there to hurt you.
4055.44s:  It's genuinely not. It's there to slow you down from hurting yourself because the overwhelming
4060.80s:  majority of traders do. And that's not me endorsing it. I believe people are grown fucking adults.
4067.44s:  And if you don't want to wear a seatbelt, don't wear a seatbelt. And if you want to try to
4072.40s:  day trade with a $5,000 account, fucking whatever, go go crazy. I don't believe in being baby sat.
4079.60s:  But it's not there to hurt you. It's genuinely not because most traders take care of that
4086.08s:  by absolutely hurting themselves and entirely themselves. Yeah.
4095.76s:  I'm getting caught up. Zack says there's got to be a way to have AI fill it in for excel. Yeah,
4100.16s:  there's something like that. But again, if you watch that video, one thing I talk about is developing
4106.48s:  a relationship with the data. And I genuinely believe that's an important process.
4111.92s:  The reason is because if you understand if you're closer in the process of conducting data entry,
4120.00s:  you're inherently going to be closer to the information. It's just a function of doing it.
4124.40s:  And you will learn more like again, like purposeful observation is pretty useful.
4130.96s:  So I think there's nothing wrong. If you want to use some sort of excel tool or API to speed up
4141.12s:  the process, but I cannot recommend highly enough just manually inputting stuff in your paper
4147.04s:  trading logs. I still do it today. I literally still do it today. And I make it a purposeful
4153.44s:  exercise. So I think it's valuable. Anthony says futures were also taxed that section 1256.
4163.84s:  Yeah. So futures indices and stuff like that are so section 1256 of the tax code. I have a
4170.48s:  really old video. I don't think I've redone this video because I don't really care enough.
4176.08s:  Yeah. Yeah. If you guys want to see an OG, this isn't even like a full OG Eric video.
4182.24s:  But that's like a partially OG Eric video. This is from 2021. I think OG, I started in May of 2020.
4190.48s:  So that's about a year in a YouTube. But that goes over section 1256 of the tax code.
4200.64s:  Roy Titty says 69 minutes in. Look at us go. The only issue is that we, I don't even think we cracked.
4206.56s:  I think we had 50 viewers. Maybe. So we unfortunately, we didn't hit our 69, which is, you know, sad.
4215.84s:  Sad for me, as I think about it makes me sad. Reese says shirt better be off. Sometimes it is.
4222.48s:  Sometimes it isn't. You never really know. There's, there's females now that show up on the
4227.84s:  streams and stuff. So that's literally why I remain clothed. It's straight up just trying to be
4233.04s:  respectful. It might be a little too old school or presumptive. But I do try to be respectful of
4239.20s:  the ladies for the dudes. Y'all can go fuck yourselves. But for the women, it's not so much that case.
4244.48s:  Try to be, try to be respectful. All right. Now let, let's get back over to this. I was going to
4257.52s:  talk about futures. And I was going to talk about the utility. So I wanted to talk about
4269.28s:  using huge futures to hedge. So let's say that you have a portfolio.
4275.36s:  I'm literally just randomly, randomly naming stocks. And then Nvidia.
4293.20s:  So let's say that you have this portfolio. And let's say it's now, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
4301.84s:  let's say it's Tuesday. And it's at 20 hundred Pacific time. And let's say that Iran
4314.56s:  invades Israel. What do you think would happen to the stock market if that happened?
4324.80s:  If Iran invaded Israel, 20 hundred Pacific time on a Tuesday, what would be your guess?
4331.76s:  What would happen here? Nothing good. Yeah. You probably,
4341.60s:  you probably would see the market do this. Here's the opening candle.
4347.20s:  That's what it would do. And then for those that are reading between the lines here,
4362.48s:  don't forget that we have, you guys know who this is.
4372.56s:  Probably as long here.
4380.64s:  Longing in the wind.
4387.52s:  Except she is actually going to grab.
4393.60s:  She has a telescope.
4406.88s:  Here, a little siding picture. So oh, yeah, and I forgot. She made a bunch of money before.
4416.32s:  So she has a gold chain. And it has diamonds on it.
4426.24s:  So Lauren is over here. And she has like a, a monocular. And she's keeping an eye on things. Oh,
4437.36s:  yeah, shit. You guys can't see the hold on a second. There you go. Perfect.
4442.24s:  So she's keeping an eye on things. And she sees that over here.
4455.52s:  There's a tank.
4463.20s:  Let's point it. I kind of put it in the middle, which I shouldn't have done.
4467.36s:  So there's a tank over here.
4477.84s:  That is shooting a projectile.
4486.08s:  At a tank that's over here. This one has a lot of wheels.
4497.36s:  This guy is looking the wrong way, though. Kind of sucks to be him.
4504.56s:  So now what's happening is Lauren's over here with her telescope. And she sees this thing unfolding.
4515.92s:  She's like, oh, shit. Over there in the Middle East, this tank is shooting at this tank and they're
4521.92s:  driving towards each other. I think the market is probably not going to react well to this.
4531.60s:  And while the two tanks are going at it, you can see that this person over here
4539.20s:  is Israeli. And in their chat bubble, they're all like, hey, yo,
4552.48s:  fuck you. And then over here,
4564.48s:  we have this person that's like, yo,
4568.56s:  fuck you. So we can see that we have a clear issue starting to unravel. And Lauren,
4586.88s:  over here,
4595.04s:  she can see all this. And she's all like, hot damn.
4605.76s:  Let me check the port. Obviously, the port is the portfolio. So she doesn't want to take
4624.96s:  her eye off the microscope or the the monocle. And over here, she's going to whip out her cell
4634.32s:  phone. She's going to touch some buttons. And she's going to look at her portfolio that looks like
4641.92s:  this. So because she has chameleon eyes, she is this one looking this way, this one looking this way.
4656.00s:  As she has her chameleon eyes looking in different ways,
4662.96s:  she sees this thing getting worse. Because now this guy is shooting back.
4669.04s:  I'm going to get the right color. This guy finally turns his tank around a little bit like this.
4675.12s:  And then he gets get some heat off himself.
4684.24s:  Quickly exclaims.
4689.76s:  Bam, biatch. And he sends his round back over here.
4698.24s:  Okay, what I'm highlighting is war is heating up.
4706.80s:  Getting getting spicy over here in the old war front.
4717.52s:  And Lauren can see all this. And Lauren is a highly, highly perceptive traitor.
4726.40s:  So she says,
4731.12s:  my portfolio, I need to manage this. So what she can do is she's going to be like,
4738.08s:  yo, let me check the port.
4745.44s:  I have 1000 beta weighted
4752.24s:  spied deltas.
4761.44s:  Then she might say,
4766.32s:  I'm a scrub.
4770.48s:  Some dem.
4772.24s:  So here,
4777.28s:  Lauren looks at her portfolio. She sees that she has,
4786.08s:  she has 1000 beta weighted spied deltas.
4792.08s:  And she wants to, she's going to scrub some of them off.
4797.12s:  Right, she's going to scrub them.
4799.92s:  So what can she do?
4806.88s:  She's going to be like,
4811.36s:  oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, my bed. She's going to be like
4818.40s:  deep boop.
4821.20s:  This is her pressing buttons on the cell phone.
4823.60s:  And as she's pressing on buttons on the cell phone,
4826.00s:  she gets that that beep boop going.
4827.68s:  Then she's going to be like, I'm going to sell to open.
4832.72s:  Maybe, what do you guys say?
4834.24s:  Maybe five?
4838.64s:  Something like that.
4839.44s:  You could do MES here.
4843.44s:  MES futures.
4847.92s:  Maybe more.
4849.44s:  Or more.
4854.40s:  If more.
4855.60s:  Thanks.
4864.00s:  I just pulled this up on OBS and I just realized how unbelievably absurd this looks.
4872.80s:  Here's what it is.
4874.00s:  This is the scenario.
4875.68s:  So
4879.20s:  we can put this order in
4881.20s:  after the market's closed.
4883.20s:  And we can put this order in
4885.20s:  to take off some of these beta weighted deltas for spy.
4889.68s:  And we can do this
4891.84s:  so that our portfolio
4893.84s:  is
4895.44s:  the same as the one we've been doing.
4897.44s:  So we can do this
4899.04s:  so that our portfolio
4903.92s:  doesn't blow up.
4905.92s:  Because right now,
4908.72s:  the equivalent of what's going on here from all of this
4913.52s:  is like,
4916.00s:  there is a giant
4919.12s:  spheroid.
4921.52s:  Probably got some holes on it from flying through the space.
4926.40s:  That's hurling
4933.60s:  towards her portfolio.
4936.64s:  And she can protect her portfolio
4939.84s:  even though the market's closed
4943.12s:  by putting on a futures trade like this.
4946.24s:  This is one of the benefits of trading futures.
4949.28s:  Is it gives you the ability to manage black swan risk?
4953.44s:  Without having to carry
4956.72s:  a hedge forever.
4958.56s:  So
4960.00s:  I'm going to take a pause here.
4962.80s:  I've been seeing the chat flying around.
4964.72s:  Let me get caught up.
4965.68s:  It looks like there's
4968.40s:  B Williams gifted
4972.40s:  a shit ton 20.
4974.40s:  B Williams gifted 20
4976.40s:  outlier trading memberships.
4978.40s:  Yo, you are the homey B Williams.
4980.40s:  Thank you so much for doing that.
4982.40s:  I hope everybody enjoys B Williams.
4988.16s:  Make sure you guys say thank you to him,
4989.84s:  especially if you were the ones that got it.
4991.68s:  I don't know how that works.
4992.64s:  I literally don't.
4994.00s:  But make sure you guys say thank you, please.
4997.52s:  And on behalf of everybody else, thank you.
5000.56s:  That Lauren says, funny, I have binoculars because I'm kind of nosy.
5004.48s:  Yeah, exactly.
5005.92s:  So I could tell Lauren,
5007.68s:  because what you're fucking long ass legs and shit,
5010.72s:  you're out here looking at war unfolding
5015.28s:  and you're making trading decisions.
5017.92s:  But this is one of the good parts about
5021.92s:  futures is they give you exposure to something like this.
5025.36s:  And it helps offset some of the risk.
5029.92s:  All right.
5032.00s:  Back into here.
5034.88s:  I think we had learning in future.
5036.32s:  I think this is it.
5037.20s:  I think we got through most of them.
5040.00s:  Okay.
5042.40s:  Who are the key influences or mentors that help shape your trading career
5045.68s:  in what was the most valuable lesson you learned from them?
5048.24s:  There's two people.
5049.20s:  And this is actually pretty short.
5050.88s:  The first one is the dude that introduced me to invest thing,
5053.92s:  not trading at all, by the way.
5055.44s:  He didn't introduce me to this guy,
5060.56s:  which not fun fact.
5063.36s:  He's been dealing with cancer and he just had more cancer that popped up.
5068.80s:  And it doesn't look super great.
5070.48s:  He was just out here to visit me.
5072.32s:  But I might be flying to New York to go
5075.52s:  go hang out with them for a bit.
5077.44s:  So anybody that does prayers or thoughts
5080.80s:  would love for you guys to keep them in your prayers.
5084.16s:  His name is I call him E-man.
5086.40s:  His name is Ed.
5088.00s:  But this is
5092.96s:  this is quite literally the dude that changed my life,
5095.68s:  like genuinely.
5097.44s:  Because he is the one that introduced me not only to
5103.28s:  investing, but I used to spend a ton of time
5108.56s:  in his office after school hours, because well for a lot of reasons.
5113.36s:  I didn't want to go home and also going home.
5117.60s:  Yeah, but bunch of bullshit.
5119.52s:  So I used to spend hours just learning from him,
5124.48s:  asking him about life, asking him about experiences.
5128.88s:  And he has been, yeah, kind of a massive influence.
5133.92s:  So when I consider what my life would look like
5140.40s:  with and without him, it's literally night and day.
5147.36s:  I would be in a completely, completely different spot.
5151.28s:  So he's had cancer a few times.
5153.60s:  He has, he's had melanoma a few times.
5156.48s:  And then he just had prostate cancer.
5158.72s:  He went through that.
5160.48s:  And now he's looking at it again.
5162.96s:  He has some shit, like a mass underneath his shoulder.
5167.28s:  And then I guess it looks like it's spreading again.
5169.76s:  So yeah.
5172.48s:  So he's the first one.
5174.16s:  And it's not just from a trading perspective.
5176.16s:  It's literally just from like a manhood perspective,
5180.80s:  like teaching me how to think and, and yeah, stuff like that.
5186.88s:  But he and I, I didn't realize it, but he and I,
5191.60s:  I was very receptive to kind of like his,
5195.20s:  to, to learning from him.
5197.60s:  But he also had a son that he adopted and his son had committed suicide.
5203.36s:  So he also had a void because at this point in my life,
5207.28s:  I didn't really have, my dad was still alive and I love my dad.
5211.60s:  My dad loved us as best as he could, especially as we got older.
5215.68s:  But I didn't have like a father figure in my life.
5218.16s:  Like, he man genuinely became that.
5220.56s:  Like when I went to advice, even today, as I'm thinking about different kinds of things,
5226.08s:  he's always the first person that I go to for advice.
5229.04s:  So he's influenced more than just my trading.
5231.76s:  He's the one that introduced me to trading.
5233.92s:  And then the second person is a guy that I met online.
5240.00s:  And I would indirectly learn from a lot of what he talked about.
5245.84s:  He was somebody that clearly didn't have a lot of motives.
5251.44s:  And the reason why I say that is because he was not nice to people.
5256.16s:  He's not like, I would consider myself much nicer than him,
5259.92s:  although I'm very direct and sometimes people interpret that as being not nice or
5266.40s:  or something like that, especially via messaging.
5268.80s:  Because messaging definitely comes across very tourists typically.
5272.56s:  But that mentor taught me that I didn't know shit about trading,
5279.84s:  even though I had been trading for a while.
5282.40s:  And I didn't go into it thinking that I was hot shit knowing everything.
5286.80s:  But just in the conversations I would have and watch him have,
5290.80s:  I learned that there was a lot of massive gaps in what I do.
5296.16s:  And that second mentor is a big reason why I started the YouTube channel.
5300.80s:  Because YouTube was around then, but it wasn't as big of a deal then.
5304.80s:  And he wasn't doing a YouTube.
5305.84s:  He had no interest in doing a YouTube channel.
5307.76s:  I actually invited him onto mine so that I could talk to him and
5312.88s:  kind of show the impact that he's had on my life.
5317.76s:  And hopefully just put that in front of people.
5320.56s:  But he didn't want to be he doesn't even I don't even mention his name because he doesn't want to be named.
5326.56s:  So he taught me that
5333.60s:  even though I was really eager to try to make a lot of money at a young age,
5340.00s:  my eagerness didn't matter.
5342.88s:  And I could be as eager as I wanted.
5345.76s:  But what really mattered was taking the time to plan
5352.00s:  and creating a plan that made sense.
5355.84s:  Now his teaching style is actually very, very similar to my teaching style, which is I,
5365.68s:  I try to aim people in the right direction.
5369.52s:  But it's self learning.
5371.68s:  You should learn a lot of the nuance in the details by yourself.
5377.04s:  I obviously teach a lot of the fundamentals and foundational stuff, right?
5381.60s:  Like this whole spin-off series is essentially that to a T and going through in very,
5389.20s:  very deep detail teaching a lot of concepts.
5392.88s:  So it's not like I just say go learn this.
5396.32s:  It's definitely nothing like that.
5398.72s:  But it's also not overly prescriptive where I do not
5405.44s:  to heavily define the things that should be learned when I try to teach people to be autonomous.
5413.44s:  It's a very military style of training, especially for officers because you have to be
5418.80s:  a self-sufficient thinking being.
5421.12s:  So he very much taught me that.
5423.84s:  He taught me that I needed to have a defined plan that's written out that has a lot of thought put
5429.36s:  into it. And he taught me that the only person that is going to care about this stuff is you.
5438.80s:  So it's on you, the individual to do it.
5442.00s:  So yeah, that's number one there.
5448.80s:  B. Williams says that he's going to be praying for Ed.
5450.96s:  Thank you so much.
5451.52s:  I appreciate it.
5452.24s:  Thank you.
5453.20s:  Yeah.
5454.24s:  Eman is the dude.
5455.28s:  And I really appreciate you guys keeping them in his thoughts.
5461.68s:  Nima.
5462.40s:  Oh, shit.
5462.96s:  That's a tough.
5463.60s:  Oh, shit.
5464.40s:  That's a tough name.
5465.84s:  Damn.
5467.20s:  Neh.
5468.64s:  Nehemiah.
5470.24s:  Nehemiah.
5472.80s:  DeRosie says how many years do you think a person with some trading experience should
5478.40s:  invest in learning options before potentially trading?
5482.56s:  Options seems a bit difficult to grasp, let alone finding an edge.
5487.60s:  Well, the edge that you will find in options is not all too dissimilar from what you would do
5493.84s:  in trading.
5494.96s:  So from that perspective, I actually think it's quite easy.
5500.72s:  Now it just in terms of like application.
5504.00s:  But in terms of like starting, I have a couple of videos that would probably be useful.
5513.44s:  This one.
5516.24s:  So for Nehemiah and correct me if I'm wrong, I try to pronounce people's names just because
5522.00s:  it's kind of a fun exercise for me.
5524.48s:  So that video is about like how to start trading.
5529.76s:  But in terms of like how long it's not a duration-based thing.
5535.68s:  And it's absolutely a skills-based thing.
5539.92s:  My recommendation, like if I were to advise myself starting over again,
5544.72s:  I would tell myself to paper trade for three months at least.
5548.56s:  And I really think a year would be ideal, but I just know how impatient I am.
5553.84s:  So I'm pretending that I'm talking to 17 year old Eric again.
5557.60s:  So I'm compromising to try to get a level of compliance.
5561.68s:  Because I could say a year, but it doesn't matter if I think a year is too long because I can't
5567.36s:  synthesize that at that point in time.
5569.84s:  I'm trying to make money fast, so I'm trying to be realistic with what I would tell myself.
5574.72s:  Three months is what I would tell myself.
5577.04s:  And over the course of that three months, you're not going to learn anything pertaining to
5582.56s:  making money. That first three months is going to be making a bunch of mistakes.
5587.68s:  It's going to be developing a relationship with the markets.
5590.80s:  It's going to be very, very slowly learning.
5595.52s:  Now, the process of developing edge in actually finding ways to make money,
5602.56s:  if you're a stock trader, it's literally the same thing.
5606.32s:  You can just use options to gain leverage.
5609.20s:  That's it. Right? So if we go back,
5612.64s:  to the again, abomination of a slide deck, and we look at
5620.64s:  the big four strategy and trade process, it's quite simple.
5627.44s:  But let's say that you're a stock trader and you're able to find things that move directionally.
5634.24s:  Okay, well, that's your profit mechanism.
5636.48s:  You're able to accurately identify directional movements.
5640.96s:  However, you do that in stock trading is the same as what you would do in options trading.
5645.84s:  So then you essentially just need to find things that allow you to capitalize on that profit mechanism.
5651.76s:  But that's again, there's not an inherent edge to options.
5658.00s:  Options provide exposure to different kinds of phenomenon that can offer edge,
5664.24s:  like variance risk premiums. You can't get that with equities. So that exists.
5669.28s:  But options in and of themselves provide precisely zero edge.
5675.92s:  It's the same thing as people who debate buying or selling options.
5683.92s:  And they go back and forth on if you know, buying is better than selling or selling better
5689.76s:  than buying. And the reality is again, there's really inconclusive edge between them.
5695.52s:  It's that's really not the question to ask. So that's that.
5702.96s:  And roaring titty is asking for the paper trading link. There you go.
5712.00s:  So let me know if that answers your question.
5713.84s:  And then we have South
5721.12s:  packed dad.
5724.08s:  That is hope you're having a great night. Love the content. Great to have you. Glad you stopped by.
5729.04s:  And thanks so much for the comment.
5731.44s:  Cedric says, edge would be more like inventing a new cable to get orders through faster.
5736.48s:  That yeah, that's that's an edge or again, like an edge is a profit mechanism. That's edge.
5742.64s:  So it's your ability to to make money. So something like being able to
5748.80s:  successfully trade directionally, like that's edge or your ability to accurately price volatility
5757.12s:  and to trade volatility itself. That's edge. Your ability to identify patterns
5764.80s:  with within markets is edge.
5769.20s:  Rointitty says, why is it called edge instead of skill because you can have skill and no edge.
5775.44s:  There are a lot of people who can trade for a long time have skills, right? They can know how to
5782.64s:  build trades. They can know those kinds of things. But if they have bad risk management
5787.28s:  or if they're too nervous about putting on risk or whatever insert, whatever the thing is,
5793.44s:  they can still not have an edge. So in edges is a quantifiable metric where we're expecting
5801.12s:  to make money and something. And that's why edge is quite important. Now, edges like this really
5808.72s:  weird topic, there's a lot of different permutations and there's a lot of different ways people
5815.76s:  internalize what it means and stuff like that. But because, oh, that's way too bright.
5823.76s:  Because sometimes people they'll think if edge is something like beta or alpha. A lot of times,
5832.80s:  alpha and edge will go hand in hand. It's definitely not beta.
5839.60s:  From a trading perspective, but you can have, you can definitely create excess return using
5848.72s:  different betas, but it's just a different concept.
5855.52s:  All right. Joey says, I always thought edge was a secret mechanism you profit off of. No,
5864.72s:  it doesn't have to be secret. It's, yeah, no, definitely not secret. Most edges is really not secret,
5870.72s:  like momentum. That's not a secret. Variance or premiums. That's not a secret. But those are
5874.48s:  definitely quantifiable edges. People have like this really miss, I find like a wide array of edge,
5885.60s:  where some people that are too much efficient market hypothesis, they would argue that there is no
5890.40s:  edge, which obviously we know that there is. And I mean, you shouldn't use anecdotes, but
5897.60s:  I for a personal scenario, no for a factor's fucking edge. So that's from a theoretical
5905.60s:  perspective. If you take strong form of efficient market hypothesis, which we know is not so much
5910.96s:  the case. Be William says, I think a big thing when it comes to options is do your research on how
5918.96s:  the market makers choose price point and what the mechanics are about beneath the surface.
5923.20s:  Once you know how it works, you can make it. I would, I would actually argue differently than
5929.60s:  that be Williams, because realistically, like the way that market makers determine price or the
5934.80s:  way market determines price ultimately doesn't actually matter that much, right? It's consensus driven.
5941.76s:  So you can understand market mechanics intimately well and still not be able to make money from it.
5948.32s:  So for me, I think the North Star for edge, it's literally this process is outlined.
5956.56s:  Like this is the process to build edge is right here. And the reason for this is because again,
5963.60s:  a lot of people will start trading options thinking that there's some sort of magic solution
5968.72s:  in options to their trading problems and that they're going to be able to just trade options and
5972.80s:  make a bunch of money and it's just not the case. The way that you build edge in trading is by
5979.68s:  finding ways to make money. It's literally that simple. So then how do we find ways to make money?
5986.32s:  Well, that's the idea behind profit mechanisms. That's why I label it as such because they are things
5992.96s:  that lead to making money. So yeah, the understanding markets, market structure, the different players,
6001.28s:  all of that stuff is good information. But if a trader is really good at trading directionally,
6008.40s:  they could literally not know any of that and make money. So for example, if I'm really good at
6014.80s:  trading directionally, I can just buy option, buy calls in the money out of the money, both whatever,
6024.72s:  and I can still make more money than if I just bought the stock. That's with knowing nothing.
6030.80s:  It's literally just buying the options. Now, obviously you can optimize those returns by
6036.48s:  understanding what day's expiration might make sense. What delta might make sense? What game
6041.28s:  are you looking for? But that starts to really amplify the returns. It's not going to generate
6046.96s:  the returns. Picking your DTE is not what's going to make a trade profitable. This is what makes
6054.00s:  a trade profitable. And again, this is why I get such a kick out of traders that spend so much time
6059.12s:  spending their wheels about if they're going to buy options or sell options. It doesn't really matter.
6067.36s:  Like it doesn't really matter if you're going to buy options or sell options or do both.
6071.68s:  What matters is if you have a quantifiable profit mechanism that you can take advantage of,
6077.36s:  that's what matters. And then your ability to detect it and then your ability to trade it.
6082.48s:  But the profit mechanism comes first and that's before you ever touch an option.
6089.84s:  So yeah.
6092.80s:  B. Williams says options were really only created to hedge positions.
6097.92s:  Yeah, well, hedge and speculate, right? Because if you're going to have a hedging component,
6104.80s:  there has to be somebody to speculate on the other side. Because, for example,
6109.76s:  I'm not going to take the other side of a hedge unless I have some sort of speculative
6115.76s:  perspective on whether or not I think their hedge is going to work out. So yeah, it's definitely
6124.16s:  born out of hedging, but it's not like you need the other side of that equation in order for that
6132.80s:  play out. So if we take a look at this. Oh, this is cool. Finally.
6146.72s:  Google. Oh, this is great. So Google Sheets has finally created tabs. I love this because I hate having
6159.68s:  a like scroll through this whole thing. But let's take a look at the history. I have this in my trading
6165.60s:  plan. Let's go to 350 BC. Fails and the olive harvest. Literally. So this is
6176.40s:  like these are these are the notes. I'm literally going to read you the notes directly from a trade
6180.96s:  log. So let's talk about the the advent. One of the earliest references to options trading was
6190.16s:  seen in a book written by Aristotle. And it's from the fourth century or about 350 BCE. The book
6197.04s:  was named politics. And it talked about fails of militus who earned massive profits from an olive
6205.68s:  from an olive harvest. Fails had immense knowledge of astronomy and mathematics, which he combined with
6214.08s:  other subjects to build the foundation of options contracts. He studied the stars intricately
6219.52s:  and predicted that there would be a massive olive harvest in his region. He had identified the
6225.28s:  olive presses that would witness huge demand and profit from his market vision. However,
6233.68s:  fails lacked funds required to buy all the olive presses. So in the offseason, he paid a some of
6238.96s:  money to each of the press owners to obtain the rights to use them at harvest time. He agreed to
6246.00s:  pay a small premium to the owners of the olive presses, which the owners would keep to lock in the right
6254.96s:  to use the presses for the next harvest at a predetermined price that literally is a premium
6259.68s:  to an option. The owners agreed to this as they would get a guaranteed amount, even if fails
6266.24s:  opted out of the deal, they would still be able to sell the rights to use the press every year.
6271.12s:  When the growing season set in, olive presses saw a harvest much higher than usual. Since the crop
6276.64s:  is time sensitive, the farmers acted in desperation to bid up the payment to the olive mill to quickly
6283.76s:  process their harvest. Though the terminology wasn't official, that's literally a call contract.
6290.48s:  If you think about what that was, that's literally that example from 350 BC is straight up a speculative
6299.84s:  trade. So fails for a military shows us actually that the very first options trade technically speaking
6307.76s:  is not a hedge at all, but he was speculating that demand was going to be massive in the coming
6315.28s:  harvest and he ended up being correct. Now again, in general, a lot of the more common use of early
6321.44s:  options definitely is very similar to hedging. That's a big part of it, but that's also that's
6326.88s:  more so futures why futures were invented was specifically for hedging. But yeah, anyways,
6332.96s:  in case anybody was interested in a history lesson, I literally go through
6337.04s:  essentially all of the early uses of options. So I go from 360 BC to 1636 to the 17th century to
6349.28s:  1800s all the way through. So yeah, I mean, literally I nerd about this stuff just a tad.
6358.40s:  But I spent a lot of time digging into the history of derivatives because it was just super,
6362.24s:  super interesting to me. So
6368.80s:  B Williams says, what I've been very successful in trading is following the stock for about two
6373.60s:  weeks and understanding them momentum and what's going on with world news. Yeah, that's okay. So
6378.64s:  some people will define individual tickers that they like to trade. I very much am not like that.
6385.36s:  I look for specific conditions and I tend to be agnostic of the ticker. And it's just because I
6394.08s:  can I can get more repetitions in by doing it that way. If we focus on one individual ticker,
6402.32s:  you really narrow your scope a lot. And again, that's okay if you like that. But I actually think
6409.12s:  using a conditions based approach will get you much more looks at things that fit those specific
6416.88s:  conditions that should statistically yield a positive outcome in the aggregate. The funny thing
6423.36s:  about this story is if you go on the discord was for anybody here yesterday was anybody here
6431.52s:  on the live stream yesterday. And then I have another question for you.
6435.20s:  So there was a stream yesterday. Okay, so Reese was there. Got it. So we went through a bit of a
6443.92s:  case study. Yeah, on a trade. And if you take a look at what I posted in the discord earlier today,
6452.00s:  what do you notice about this? Different holding than what we reviewed yesterday.
6460.08s:  But what do you notice about the general looking feel? Super fucking similar. Super fucking similar.
6470.88s:  So the point is if we use some sort of conditions based rules set, we can find more opportunities
6482.96s:  that fit those conditions. So this I already have a position on. I started scaling in actually on
6488.32s:  the gap up today just because again, that's the nature of speculating I put on a small trade
6493.84s:  to start with. And then as it started running, I literally just scaled in for the first part of
6499.12s:  the day as it was running its way up. And then as soon as I got the alert that it had broken
6504.64s:  meaningfully above that resistance line, I finished scaling in the position. And I actually sold
6510.56s:  a call on top of it that was short dated at a ratio as per usual. Very, very light ratio. It's
6517.04s:  like 15% covered. So very, very light ratio. And that's it. It's literally running almost an
6525.76s:  identical setup to what I just showed you in APP. Almost identical. And this I'm still in, as you
6534.48s:  can see, like I literally am still continuing to move up the stop and to just run it upside. So
6541.76s:  the main point there is that if we develop conditions based rules, we can then very efficiently
6550.56s:  scan for occurrences of those and then try to play them when they look right. So that's the idea.
6558.48s:  I just thought it was hilarious that literally yesterday we had talked about this setup. And then
6565.12s:  I mean, if we look at AFRM, it's it's so similar. It's not the same obviously, but it's a very,
6573.76s:  very similar move overall. Now the scale of the chart and stuff looks different now because it
6578.56s:  hasn't had that big of a run yet. But we'll see if it does. Who knows? It can always revert back.
6583.76s:  And what I would do in that instance is just start scaling out because I'm already in for a
6588.80s:  decent profit at this point. So it would be a really, really simple trade to me. This is one that
6594.48s:  I essentially would not take a loss on at this point. Unless there's a massive gap down, then
6599.20s:  I eat the loss. That's how it goes. You play the game. You take risk. That is how the whole thing goes.
6606.32s:  All right.
6611.04s:  Cedric says you going around a little unsuperstalk lately. That makes me nervous. I don't know if
6617.92s:  that's good or bad, but super stonk. I know has a very specific opinion of things. So hopefully not
6627.92s:  not bad news. I wonder I'm guessing that the video I did yesterday would probably crack a couple
6633.12s:  people up. Yeah, the this stuff, that was my that would be my guess. Cedric says it's good comments,
6642.80s:  but it's not a good thing. Why? Yeah. I mean, I don't know. For overall brand, it's always a good
6649.44s:  thing if people are at least somewhat interested to share the stuff that I do.
6655.36s:  So that I imagine is probably not a bad thing. But if I'm just guessing that it would have been
6659.76s:  the video from yesterday, because otherwise I haven't done anything too recently. Maybe the stuff
6664.00s:  about the cat. I don't know what it is. You'll have to tell me. But yeah, that's interesting.
6670.96s:  The next question here is how do you continue to learn and stay updated with market changes
6678.00s:  after all these years of experience? That's easy. That's just literally this, right? Like the time I
6685.84s:  spend with you all going through stuff essentially shows how I do this exact process. So it's just
6692.00s:  a matter of staying in touch with the markets. That's kind of easy. Cedric says also Peruvian and the
6699.44s:  one million. Yeah. Okay. So I figured it was from the video yesterday just because if for those that
6703.92s:  haven't seen the video that I did yesterday on Citadel, essentially it was just a I was just
6709.20s:  fucking around because I can't help but find the whole thing pretty, pretty hilarious.
6716.32s:  But yeah, thank you, Cedric. That's stuff. Honestly, it's helpful for me to know at least that
6721.68s:  something like that is going on because I've already told you guys and I tell people this like
6726.48s:  pretty regularly. Like I literally consume essentially no, no financial media. Like I read news
6735.20s:  and stuff that comes out, but I don't really consume any financial media. I kind of just do my own
6739.60s:  shit. Cedric says sarcasm for 10 minutes straight, pretty impressed. Yeah, it's well, for me to
6746.56s:  riff like that is just the norm. I don't script any of my videos. So yeah, the videos like that one
6757.44s:  I kind of knew what I wanted to talk about obviously in the context. And but it wasn't planned to be a
6764.40s:  full, a full video of just sarcasm and satire. It genuinely wasn't. I just kind of started with it
6773.28s:  and then the next joke and framing kind of kept rolling. I just kept going with it until it stopped
6779.20s:  essentially. I'm not gonna lie though. I thought the ending was pretty funny though. That's probably
6784.00s:  my favorite part of that video. Joey says no squawk box, no squawk box. Nope. Ben Zingha has one,
6791.28s:  but I don't listen to it. It doesn't matter to me. Like that's not that's not the way that I trade.
6797.28s:  So catching news as soon as it's happening to try to play those really short term moves. It's
6804.24s:  not so much my style. Again, what I do is very conditions based. So if there's something that's
6809.44s:  getting caught in the news that then hits my radar, I'll typically be a little bit late to it,
6813.92s:  but that's just kind of how it goes. I don't mind. I'm not trying to top tick or bottom tick
6819.12s:  everything. Joyce says I have no idea what a squawk box is actually. So it used to be these literally
6825.20s:  like a box. It was like those conference call tools, but it was always on. And so people would have
6832.56s:  it on the floor, and then they would have the other end like wherever their office is for their
6837.68s:  firm. So then it's essentially an open line of communication between the floor and use. So you
6843.12s:  can hear what's going on, although you're not there. So that's the idea behind a squawk box.
6849.76s:  It's just for essentially flow of information. Trollbox. That's more,
6855.60s:  tell me I think that's more accurate. I like that one better. The trollbox.
6865.52s:  All right. Next question here is what resources, books, courses, mentors had the most
6872.08s:  significant impact on your development? Options is a strategic investor for sure. And then
6877.76s:  Nate and Berg's book probably. And then you and books after that, at least from a fundamental
6883.92s:  understanding of things. And then I think O'Shaunase's book was good. I think
6895.20s:  yeah, I think that's most of like what have had the most significant impact. Because I'm at a
6902.40s:  point, my trading career where it's incremental gains. Like I have to put in multiple hours of
6909.04s:  effort to learn like one new unit of information. That's like, you know, really dense information
6915.04s:  of sorts. So what I do now is is a lot different now, but it's not efficient. It can't be efficient
6921.68s:  at this point. It kind of is what it is. How do you recommend new traders filter through
6927.60s:  overwhelming amount of information? This is hilarious because this is literally why I built this
6936.88s:  for you. Let me grab it. This here. And again, this isn't like an end-to-end thing,
6948.00s:  but it's a starting point. So the short answer to this is I think the way for new traders to filter
6955.28s:  through the amount of information that's there is actually to create a syllabus for yourself.
6959.68s:  And then from that syllabus, I would just make sure that it makes sense. You can use literally a book
6967.60s:  like options as a strategic investment as your basis for your syllabus. And you can create a
6976.32s:  learning path for yourself. When I try to remind people when it comes to learning anything that
6981.52s:  you learn in school, there's normally a very defined path. There's test quizzes, projects,
6986.16s:  stuff like that homework. And there's none of that in trading. Most people just kind of go off and
6991.92s:  you know, go forth and do their best or whatever the case is. And I actually think that's a pretty
6998.40s:  big mistake. I think that when we try to learn like that, it's very circuitous. We just go around
7008.80s:  and fucking circles. We learn a little bit here. I call it movement for the sake of movement.
7013.92s:  Because you might look at a lot of stuff. You might do a lot of stuff, but it doesn't mean that
7017.92s:  you're actually like deriving a lot of value from all that stuff. So yeah, that's essentially how
7026.48s:  I would filter through things is I would just be very purposeful with the learning steps. And again,
7032.40s:  you can use a book like options as a strategic investment. You can use the link that I dropped
7037.04s:  there, but just think of how you learn in school and create that for learning options. It's
7043.36s:  kind of like the same thing. How is your trading style evolved to adapt to recent market changes,
7051.04s:  such as the rise of meme stocks and zero DTE options trading? That's funny. So zero DTEs,
7055.60s:  I trade. Most people know the the size and stuff that I do in zero DTEs is not a significant part
7061.84s:  of the account value though. And zero DTEs continue to be a decent return, but there are like,
7069.20s:  it's for me at least I'm not going to be making buckets of money trading zero DTEs. It's just not
7074.96s:  how my strategy works with it. And the way that I trade it continues to evolve. You guys have
7080.48s:  already seen some of those changes over the last couple of years where I used to very heavily
7086.96s:  favor straddles and now I favor strangles and there's those kinds of pieces that will continue
7094.16s:  to evolve as I understand more and how markets move with respect to the to the phenomenon or in
7102.80s:  this case, your DTEs. Memestocks, that's easy. I just trade the movement. And obviously I'm way
7110.32s:  deeper into meme stocks now mostly to participate with you, but meme stocks for me are still a
7116.56s:  very small part of what I do in my total portfolio. It's by, it's yeah, by and large a really small
7128.32s:  component of my speculative allocations, I tend to trade things again that are kind of conditions
7135.76s:  based that look interesting to me. The governor says every course is for ADD people literally
7143.84s:  skipping around every subject in course. Or in city says there should be an options course for
7149.52s:  ADD and dyslexic people. That's funny. I think the problem is honestly if you have ADD and if
7156.72s:  if somebody is afflicted with ADD and or dyslexia, like options trading is probably not for you.
7163.44s:  Like that's just the that's the God on a truth. And it's because there's a lot of fucking details.
7168.96s:  And if if you're not good at staying focused and like managing the details,
7178.48s:  it's not it's just not a good it's not a good fit. It's like the same thing is somebody like
7184.96s:  I might like the idea of being a fucking ballerina, but I don't know like I probably wouldn't be
7190.80s:  very good at it, especially with my fucked up back right now. I don't necessarily have the physical
7199.04s:  setup to be a ballerina. It's like the same thing. You kind of have to find stuff that align
7204.80s:  with your personality and individuality because that's the reality. You can see
7212.24s:  you can see a lot of you know my tendencies. A lot of you have watched me on these live streams
7218.80s:  for enough now to have a pretty good feel. But I'm very very much obsessive. I am somewhat
7226.08s:  detail oriented. I'm detail oriented on the stuff that I think matters to be detail oriented.
7231.44s:  And then a lot of stuff I'm not detail. It is highly variable. So like those kind of tendencies
7238.80s:  translate pretty well to the market. So yeah.
7249.84s:  Six is what training technology or tools do you consider essential for a trader?
7254.88s:  Excel.
7258.88s:  Excel or Google Sheets. That's what's essential.
7263.84s:  Think scripting doesn't matter. You can literally use chat GPT for most of it.
7270.64s:  Yeah. Some sort of tracking, Excel, slash, Google Sheet,
7277.36s:  and then a trading platform. Like that's literally all you need. You don't need a bunch of other
7281.28s:  shit. Other data sources can be good. They can be useful. I like some of them.
7287.36s:  But especially in the beginning, it's kind of like when you watch,
7292.80s:  if you watch people that are really good at something, they tend to have like stuff that works.
7298.40s:  So for example, in Jujitsu, most black belts will have these old,
7304.72s:  ratty-ass black belts. And it's just because the belt does what it does. And it's also a
7310.32s:  status symbol, right, to show that the belt has a lot of wear and tear on it.
7314.48s:  But you'll notice that a lot of people when they first start something new,
7318.72s:  is they go get all the best new shit that they can find, even though the skill set's not there.
7323.76s:  So in this, the skill set is not dependent on any of that shit. So I would start very basic.
7340.56s:  That Lauren says, I'm ADHD. And once I get all the details of something, I'm extremely successful.
7347.12s:  It's just that it takes me longer to learn the details. Yeah. So for something like ADHD with that set,
7352.08s:  I think you just have to figure out then what the learning process is.
7355.76s:  Because here's the other thing is I think modern day society, one, we like, for example,
7362.72s:  if somebody has ADHD, the first thing I would do is say you get literally no social media.
7368.48s:  There's no social media for you. You don't get Instagram, you don't get YouTube shorts,
7372.72s:  you don't get TikTok, you get none of that. And I think that it's because it massively contributes to
7378.16s:  it. Then I think it's starting to reel back the underlying behavior because I think we over
7386.00s:  diagnosed stuff like ADD and ADHD. I really do because I think like I have trouble focusing.
7393.84s:  Maybe it's not, you know, a chemical imbalance or stuff like that. And I'm not saying that it
7397.20s:  doesn't exist. But I absolutely think that we live in a society that leads to those tendencies.
7405.84s:  And then I think we over diagnosed those tendencies. So if a trader has something like attention deficit,
7414.72s:  hyperactive, I don't care so much about. But if somebody's attention deficit, the markets are a
7419.12s:  bad place to be attention deficit, you have to have attention. And you have to have to attention that
7425.12s:  can be essentially like held for long durations of time, even through very uninteresting or non-moving
7435.52s:  components. That's just a general mismatch to me. Now again, I would jokingly say I have ADD
7442.16s:  or ADHD as well. But in a reality, I can fully control my focus. It's just not always easy.
7450.16s:  The there's a period that's very easy if you're in like a flow state. But most of the work that I do
7456.56s:  is not in a flow state. Most of the work that I do is really, really thoughtful, dedicated time
7462.80s:  to sit down and learn something. And I literally create an architecture for me to do so.
7468.48s:  It's one of the reasons why I have a standing desk is you'll see me even during the live sessions
7472.64s:  that are a couple hours long. Part of it is because my back hurts. But I'll sit down, stand up,
7478.24s:  I will move during it because those changes of pace help refresh my mental clock. I also set
7484.40s:  very specific work and break windows for myself based on a lot of human lab protocols.
7491.84s:  I don't disperposely disrupt a flow state. But I respect when I go through periods where I'm
7499.60s:  effective versus ineffectual. And if I notice myself being ineffectual, I have to differentiate.
7505.52s:  Is it because of a lack of discipline? And I'm being lazy and easily distracted because I'm
7510.24s:  not being disciplined or am I literally cognitively fatigued. And I need that 10 minute rest period to
7516.24s:  go do something else to refresh my mental perspective to then come back into another bout of like
7523.60s:  very focused work. So again, I think a lot of people would just summarize. And I'm not saying you
7530.56s:  Lauren, I'm just talking about this in general generalities. But I think a lot of people would
7534.88s:  just quickly summarize a difficulty in focusing to something like 80 to 80 HD versus applying
7541.68s:  the rigorous process to try and be focused. Because yeah, like it's really difficult to focus on
7548.56s:  a lot of this stuff for a lot of people. So
7551.20s:  Jonathan Colors says, what are some of the non obvious dangers of a 20 strike,
7560.88s:  Jimmy leap, considering the options are as cheap as they've been since the late 2020s.
7567.04s:  Obviously being sideways forever. Or as cheap as they've been, I don't know what that means.
7573.92s:  What does that mean?
7579.76s:  I don't really know what that means.
7583.28s:  Obviously, I understand that the inference, but I'm saying from like a broader perspective.
7593.12s:  I'm grabbing a video for you.
7597.44s:  So this video is about buying call options smarter. It's literally for the meme stock slash ape
7603.12s:  crowd. So you can check that out. But yeah, off Putin says Newton talking about options could
7615.04s:  be dangerous. Yeah, he texted me. I don't know what did he say in his video? Because I don't want
7621.52s:  to go into detail on what he and I spoke about unless he already talked about this stuff.
7627.92s:  So what did he say? I haven't seen his video. What did he say in the video about options?
7641.04s:  It looks like Jonathan had had watched it.
7657.12s:  Nada.
7668.40s:  Well, anyways, let me know what it was because obviously I'm happy to talk about it. But I just don't
7673.76s:  want to low IV, I believe. Okay, let's see.
7687.20s:  So IVP implied volatility percentile is no.
7699.36s:  Yeah, that's like that's accurate. I would call that accurate.
7703.20s:  And then if we're going back to 2020, we need a five year daily.
7707.20s:  So yeah, I think it's okay to say that. I think on a longer term time frame,
7724.96s:  the implied volatility is a relatively cheap. I think in general,
7730.96s:  the implied volatility is typically very high, just in general.
7743.84s:  So like here, those 17 Jan 25s are actually relatively expensive compared to the 17 April,
7769.68s:  25s, which are about like double the duration. So like the 17 Jan's are expensive on a relative basis.
7782.00s:  Now, again, it doesn't really matter quite that much. But it's one of those things that I would just
7788.40s:  acknowledge when putting on the trade and just kind of take it for what it is, right? Like I am
7794.00s:  willingly paying a little more for this overall, for this overall expiration cycle, because I like it
7802.96s:  or for whatever reason on a relative basis compared to, you know, evolve. But yeah, no, I think
7809.92s:  Jonathan, I think what you're saying for whatever Newton was talking about in terms of the cost,
7817.84s:  I completely agree. Overall, vol is pretty cheap. The problem is is like buying when volatility
7825.68s:  cheap is not like that's not the move. I wouldn't base it off that at all. You have to remember,
7835.20s:  volatility is movement. If you buy a call, they make money when it moves. So unless you are
7844.96s:  structuring a very specific trade to take advantage on the movement of volatility, something like
7852.40s:  horizontal spread, like a calendar of some sort, or if you're trying to trade like volatility
7858.64s:  in and of itself, then making the buy decision off of vol is miss. It's really misleading.
7866.72s:  And the reason is because let's take a look. Sedgwick says, but what if IV is mispriced? It's not.
7874.64s:  Yeah, so you don't even have to worry about that.
7880.08s:  So if we take a look at something like, and to be clear, this is if I wanted to buy options in
7885.76s:  something like GameStop, I would go out about 90 days too. I'm not, I'm not shitting on the idea
7890.08s:  at all. I think this is about exactly where I would go. And it's just because of the way that I buy
7895.20s:  options. Again, it's in that video that I shared up above there. And the 20s, the main issue I have
7905.44s:  with those is that they're all extrinsic value. Not all. That's kind of dramatic, but it's very,
7912.00s:  very heavy extrinsic value. Rowan Titty says they were talking leaves January of 26. Oh,
7917.20s:  shit, I missed that. Sorry. Yeah, it's a lot of extrinsic value. I personally wouldn't like that
7926.32s:  too much. I would either take a slightly lower, I would take a slightly lower delta,
7937.68s:  maintain the gamma, take all the extrinsic value and it be cheaper.
7943.92s:  But yeah, for me, this is where I would go is something much closer in time. And I wouldn't,
7953.28s:  I would either decide if I'm going to be slightly out of the money and take like a 50 delta,
7959.52s:  that's all extrinsic value, but still would be a 50 delta. Or do I want to go slightly further
7965.36s:  in the money and scrub off a lot of this extrinsic value? Because the problem is is when volatility
7971.04s:  is low, it means the stock is not moving. And like, there's a reason why it's low. So when
7978.32s:  stock is low, when volatility is low, buying options can seem more lucrative from a volatility
7985.76s:  perspective. But again, it goes back to the profit mechanism. The primary profit mechanism when
7990.72s:  you buy a call is stock go up. That's the primary profit mechanism. It's not volatility go up.
7996.72s:  Volatility go up can help you a little bit, but that's not going to be the thing that really moves
8001.36s:  the needle on the trade. So I would just make sure that you like a trade is structured in the context
8009.68s:  of the profit mechanism that you're trying to play. Gibbs says, I've learned that a debit spread is
8017.68s:  pretty useless when the stock doesn't move, but credit spreads seem to be good unless the stock price
8023.28s:  goes down. I think that's mostly just of general, like you're, yes, for the debit spread,
8033.76s:  that's correct. Debit spreads are going to want movement. And credit spreads are going to want
8039.68s:  less movement. I assume you're talking about verticals here. But I wouldn't characterize them
8048.32s:  the way you are personally. I think that you're characterizing the strategies a little bit wrong
8053.84s:  by saying like debit spreads didn't work out. Right. It's not, it's not debit spreads not working out.
8059.04s:  It's the profit mechanism that didn't work out. So I, yeah, I would just be, be clear on that.
8066.16s:  Rointitty says, why do people buy deep in the money leaps instead of just buying the shares?
8071.12s:  Leverage. Rointitty, come on, man, tell me, tell me you didn't watch this video by telling me you
8079.04s:  didn't watch this video. I'm a link to it again. Right there. It's entirely for leverage.
8087.60s:  It's the same thing that we learn from sales from 350 PC. It's the same thing he did. That's why
8096.08s:  he bought a call because he couldn't afford the presses. Damn, Titty. You know, I can't be mad at you.
8107.44s:  Last couple of things. What's the biggest shift you've seen in the market since you started in
8112.72s:  2007. Oh, liquidity has gone up massively. There's a lot more volatility. And the edge in a lot of
8129.28s:  things that I used to trade is definitely contracted without a doubt. So yeah, I think that's mostly it.
8139.84s:  Where do you see your trading career headed in the next five years? Fuck if I know.
8147.76s:  And are there new markets or strategies you're excited to explore?
8152.16s:  Fuck. I didn't realize that I'm getting like fucking deep questions here.
8159.20s:  Shit, I don't know. Next five years, I expect to continue trading,
8163.76s:  unless I make a massive error at some point, which is not beyond me. That's for sure. And
8172.08s:  there's not really any new strategies that I'm excited to explore. I guess they're like
8178.08s:  exploring something like event markets. That's kind of interesting to me. I'm generally excited
8185.28s:  about that. But I mean beyond that, not so much. Like most of what I do is it's the same
8193.68s:  stuff. That's actually why I have the time now to sit here and dive into GameStop and stuff like
8201.76s:  that because it's kind of like side quests. At this point in my trading career, I know what I'm
8209.76s:  capable of producing. And I'm fortunate enough that I continue to produce it like every single year.
8215.92s:  I've had two negative years, my entire trading career. And who knows when the next one is going to be
8221.76s:  hopefully it's not going to be there. But I don't expect it to be there based on the way that I trade.
8228.40s:  But I never know. So the way that I trade now is very different in the context of like my goals
8237.36s:  are different. My goals in the beginning were to aggressively grow my account. So I would be
8243.36s:  very aggressive with positioning for quite some time. And that's not so much the case anymore.
8250.72s:  I mean, I'm very open about what my annual return targets are. But I've already talked about this
8256.48s:  conundrum I found myself in where last year was my best trading year that I've ever had. And
8265.68s:  this year is not going to be my best trading year. But it is overwhelmingly looking like it's
8274.16s:  going to be over a 50% year, I think. Because the last time we did the end of September,
8280.80s:  portfolio percent return breakdown. I don't know. I don't know if I did this on the main channel
8285.52s:  or on the Patreon. I don't remember. But the Clifknotes version for that is the portfolio at that point
8294.08s:  was up 46.3% on the year. So I find myself in this really strange scenario where I'm not actually
8304.40s:  trying to have these larger returns. But the way that I'm trading is continuing to identify them.
8311.92s:  So I'm just kind of trading opportunities as they continue to pop up. So that's kind of the way
8317.60s:  I expect to continue trading. The only thing I have to be really, really careful about is not
8322.96s:  overextending myself. And that's easy to do. I'm pretty good at monitoring the total risk. And
8329.20s:  that's actually one of the things I was just talking with a buddy about yesterday that one of my
8333.76s:  game plans is to one of my game plans is to actually start modifying the number of positions I
8347.04s:  have in the portfolio a little bit and sizing them down. Just to decrease number of positions
8355.44s:  and stuff like that to decrease total risk. But yeah, that's kind of it. I don't really see a bunch
8362.80s:  of massive changes coming down the pike. Maybe starting to add a little bit more income strategies
8368.88s:  potentially. Not like super jazzed on that though. I'd rather just make money. And then with
8373.68s:  draw money is compared to like trading income strategies. But we'll see.
8381.12s:  Gib tree says I limited the upside debit spread because the spread is cheaper than buying the call.
8385.76s:  Yep, that makes sense.
8392.24s:  Colonel says heavy traded crypto definitely. I don't really trade crypto that much. It's more of
8397.36s:  like buying hold and staking. But yeah, I've been involved in crypto for a while. I actually made
8403.28s:  a bunch of money off of Bitcoin in the mid teens like 20. I forgot what year. But it was like
8410.56s:  between 2010 and 2020 was somewhere like towards the middle there. And I just I ended up getting
8416.56s:  out way too early like a lot of people because I thought I made decent money on what I put in.
8420.64s:  And I didn't trust it at all. So I've traded it for a while now. But most of what I do now for
8427.92s:  crypto is kind of just maintained positions. I don't actively trade the coins too much. Although I
8432.64s:  do trade the futures. And the reason why I do that is just because they have different relationships with
8439.36s:  other stuff in the portfolio. And they offer the ability to kind of really tailor risk reward to
8446.80s:  where I want it. So yeah. Mark says do you know why the net gas D's 24 options are slightly skewed
8457.44s:  creating a two six two eight. And the 30 delta shore put is 280. Yep. We know exactly why that's
8466.16s:  happening. So if you take a look at net gas, you're out there in D's right. So you need to use
8476.96s:  the Z 24 expiration cycle. So right now you're looking at net gas at spot. You need to use the correct
8486.32s:  contract when you're evaluating the price for the for the future or for the option on the future.
8493.84s:  So that's why you're seeing that. So realistically that 30 delta short put strike price is 280 relative to
8505.04s:  this to this three dot 0 5 0. Cool. Well, that's all I got for you guys. Is there anything else that
8517.68s:  you guys want to talk about real quick before we wrap or anything like that?
8524.00s:  I still have a few minutes. I have, I mean, my dinner's not going to be here for a little bit.
8528.88s:  I'm just going to start working on a video once I pop off here. Oh, door literally. I hear
8536.96s:  him outside the door. Hold on. Hold on. Let me get the dude.
8555.60s:  We have fatso tonight. He just had his dinner. So he's fat and happy. I don't want kisses.
8564.48s:  Because you smell like your food. Although it's very nice.
8570.00s:  Hello, baby. I'm always curious like when I bring him up here like this, like what he actually sees.
8576.40s:  Like what is he picking up other than he's tired. Yo, let's get your pump on. Yeah, he's getting
8584.72s:  his pump on. It looks kind of like a bike.
8595.36s:  Little bird.
8603.36s:  Little little burpee boy.
8609.44s:  Thoughts on signals on Tesla when cybertaxley actually becomes a thing.
8624.72s:  Why was the why was the event disappointing?
8630.16s:  The
8649.92s:  last night Tesla had its long anticipated we robot event, the big unveiling event for their
8654.56s:  upcoming robot taxis. And as you can see from this box, it is 8.8% decline today.
8659.52s:  Let's just say it didn't go over well.
8664.80s:  I don't really the the fucking I mean, I respect what he does and I like his little like bored
8671.68s:  and stuff, but I hate listening to it. I mean, it just seems like the
8685.04s:  well, it doesn't really make sense.
8690.00s:  Tommy says cybertaxi just hype and demo market needs concrete.
8694.72s:  Yeah, but I mean like that that actually surprises me that it would fall almost 9% from that
8699.92s:  because that for me that would beg the question like what the fuck was the market expecting there to
8706.64s:  be this like what what were they expecting? This isn't an earnings release. We know that this is
8714.80s:  a general concept. So like what the fuck? I don't know what they what they thought.
8724.32s:  It was expecting robot taxis. So what was the actual thing? Is that not what he showed?
8731.20s:  Again, I didn't watch it. So you guys will have to coach me on a target here.
8735.60s:  This concept is since 2016. Yeah, I just I still don't get it though. Like I don't understand
8743.12s:  the 9% drop. It's musk in his wild promises. It will only be here in two years.
8751.12s:  I mean, musk is I don't know. I am a little bit of a musk fanboy. So musk in his wild promises
8756.80s:  is probably he delivers on far more of them than I can think of just about anybody else. And he
8763.76s:  thinks really big. So yeah, I I don't really interpret it that way. But let me see.
8777.28s:  Where is let me go to Tesla.
8780.64s:  All right, let's see.
8793.28s:  Is it all music?
8803.76s:  Damn, like 50 minutes of this thing are here.
8812.24s:  From supervised full self driving to unsupervised full self driving where the car you could
8823.84s:  fall asleep and wake up at your destination. Like that's really cool. But there's also a challenge
8832.64s:  for a lot of people that cars cost too much. I mean, when you fact we I think the the cost of
8838.48s:  autonomous transport will be so low that you can think of it like individualized mass transit.
8846.64s:  The average cost of a bus per mile per city. Sorry, I don't want to be yes, yes, yes,
8853.68s:  all our cars basically all cars that we make. So one of the things that like is really interesting
8866.56s:  is how will this affect the cities that we live in?
8873.28s:  This looks so cool. These things are, I mean, this is insane. This is why I actually really,
8881.84s:  really revere Elon Musk is because like he's moving at a pace that just about nobody else can
8888.48s:  with this shit. So it's like, I don't know, I I have a ton of respect for for what he's doing
8895.52s:  and his ability to move stuff. The yeah, I don't know. It's it's fucking incredible.
8901.04s:  I can't like just think of what nobody else is doing any of this shit. Like that's that's
8909.04s:  the reality is there's so far fucking behind. And he's not even necessarily, you know, super close
8915.20s:  to it, right? He's talking about concepts here. But still like he's so far fucking ahead of everybody.
8922.72s:  And everybody has the ability to compete with him, right? Like there's a lot of big companies.
8928.32s:  But even if you look at Bezos and what they're trying to do with what blue origin, like they're so far
8935.52s:  behind. It's it's I don't want to say it's comical. That's kind of dramatic. But it is they're very,
8942.32s:  very far behind, which I don't know, like it I think it puts musk in such a such a different
8955.12s:  atmosphere. So yeah. It's an equal thought if Tesla had the goods, they wouldn't hold that
8964.40s:  to leave it. No, they're smart. They're super smart. It's it's very, very smart to do stuff like
8970.24s:  this. It's the same reason why Apple does shut like this. Like building hype and stuff like
8975.20s:  that is is a massive part of drumming up interest. So yeah, I mean, I think I think it makes
8983.76s:  it's on a sense. And it also makes sense to talk about the vision of things so that people know
8989.44s:  like where your head's at, where you're trying to go with things. That kind of stuff I think
8993.84s:  matters a lot, especially when you're trying to he's making quite literally world changing stuff
9002.16s:  starlink is a complete game changer. And that's nothing that musk needed to do. A lot of other people
9009.60s:  could have done starlink. It's not a crazy concept, but musk did it. And he did it really well.
9016.32s:  So I look at a lot of stuff that what he does is it's just insane. It's absolutely incredible.
9023.84s:  That's just people remember cyber truck being four years late. So this could be late. Sure, it could be late.
9028.88s:  But I don't think that it like the the robot taxi being late matters that much again. That's why like
9036.00s:  when I see the movement today, I just think that's that's really heavily baked in for that kind of
9043.28s:  drop on something like that. That is the exact kind of move that as soon as this starts to base a
9048.00s:  little bit. If it didn't have earnings, I would absolutely play it to the upside. Because I don't
9053.28s:  I don't buy that move for a minute. But it's too early to tell because this is where the next
9061.44s:  low is. So we need to see how it fares in here, which is it's too early plus it has earnings coming
9071.04s:  up. So yeah, interesting find though. I actually need to watch that a little bit. I'm kind of curious.
9079.44s:  Cool. All right, gang. Daver apps me up. I'm going to take the dog for a walk. Being outlier. I'll see you all later.
