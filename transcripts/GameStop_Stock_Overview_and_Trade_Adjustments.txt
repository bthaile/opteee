0.84s: what's up outliers quick Market updates
2.72s: I'm going to start doing a GameStop
4.64s: video on Tuesday specifically so that we
6.68s: can recap some of the things that we
8.80s: learned on Saturday's stream right now
11.00s: we're looking at due diligence and stuff
12.48s: like that I want to take a look at the
14.08s: stock itself GameStop and then I want to
16.00s: talk about the GameStop covered strangle
18.20s: that I have on as an example trade for
20.24s: everybody and then for those that are
22.28s: following the covered strangle
23.64s: strategies that I'm sharing with
25.20s: everybody I will do a standalone update
28.08s: for those on Thursday
30.76s: so first things first let's take a look
32.40s: at the stock itself we obviously had
34.56s: that pretty big selloff I did a video on
36.24s: this actually I actually think last
37.96s: Tuesday potentially and it's just
39.80s: because it was really interesting to me
41.56s: there was no real news to necessitate
43.44s: the move that ties to this as to why it
46.24s: might have happened and the move is
48.28s: continued so the first thing I flagged
51.72s: actually was a bit of a support level
53.96s: I'll draw it with a regular line here so
57.04s: that you can see but it's essentially
58.48s: below this consolidation range here and
61.08s: this
61.96s: is really the bottom of this large
66.12s: volume node that we have and below this
69.16s: there's a big old Gap you can see that
71.20s: this is the very bottom of this
73.76s: consolidation range here and this is
76.04s: kind of like the last line before
78.40s: there's just very light volume leading
81.08s: into this this is a great example
82.88s: unfortunately of how stocks tend to
86.32s: require pretty significant sponsorship
89.00s: in order to appreciate and value but
91.40s: they can fall under their own weight and
94.72s: I say that because even the move that we
96.44s: saw today slightly lower or about you
99.68s: know equivalent to what we saw on the
101.20s: 17th but the difference is is it had
103.72s: this big wick came back up and it really
108.32s: inside day looks like it's continuing
110.40s: this downward Trend so this trend line
112.56s: that I drew a while ago clearly has just
114.96s: been firmly broken this is no longer
117.12s: relevant and what's become more relevant
120.48s: in my opinion is actually this downward
123.00s: trend line now and you can see that it's
125.96s: very steep the overall velocity
128.36s: potential of this is nothing really to
131.56s: scoff at and it's coming into its next
134.36s: area of congestion as far as I'm
135.92s: concerned with the same admin note as
137.96s: per always GameStop does not follow
140.28s: standard technical analysis I've done a
141.80s: lot of studies on this I know that to be
143.56s: true it follows standard technical
145.72s: analysis A lot of the time but the
147.80s: reason why I say it doesn't is because
149.36s: it VI violates standard technical
151.20s: analysis at very key times and that's
155.00s: why so if we take a look at things like
157.36s: RSI right now the 7-Day vwap RSI average
162.00s: is negative sloping it's crossing under
163.92s: 50 we can see that the RSI RSI line
167.00s: itself is kind of leveling off a little
168.84s: bit but still below the moving average
170.60s: and still below 50 which is typically a
172.44s: bearish configuration if we scroll over
175.40s: quickly to take a look at the options
177.20s: volatility is all but gone 87
180.44s: 7% Vol on the front expiration 80 86 85
184.52s: it's just very very quiet we can see a
186.36s: slight uptick and Vol still here in this
190.36s: 7 Feb expiration where it jumps from
193.44s: 80.9 to 86.5 so typically that indicates
196.84s: the market is thinking something is
198.32s: going on there we took a look at this on
200.28s: the live stream on Saturday and I'm
202.36s: actually not sure what we came up with
206.08s: other than nobody was really certain if
207.92s: there's any expected news or anything if
209.48s: you know anything about that I would
210.68s: love to know but the other thing we
212.36s: spent a little time on the stream
215.16s: Saturday taking a look at together was
218.00s: the due diligence library and I bring
221.00s: that up because I've been going through
223.36s: the due Dil due diligence library for uh
227.84s: what we're we're on episode 11 now so
231.00s: we've been looking at it for some time
234.16s: and there was a lot of interesting
235.96s: things that we came across in the latest
238.44s: iteration what we were spending a lot of
240.68s: time looking at were a couple amas
243.96s: related to um just the overall Behavior
248.00s: this is a little bit older in nature but
250.52s: then we also spent a little time looking
252.20s: at some important news as far as I'm
254.60s: concerned which I will reiterate here
256.76s: for you all again like I said we'll do a
258.20s: little bit of a recap of what we cover
260.52s: on the Saturday streams which is store
263.24s: closures and one of the things we were
265.36s: trying to figure out is with that
266.44s: original down move is was it because
269.32s: there's some sort of acceleration of
270.68s: store closures that we didn't know about
272.40s: and it's really nothing like that there
274.24s: were two closed in 2025 the bulk this is
277.04s: looking at Pacific Northwest stores to
278.64s: be clear and we know that there was a
281.60s: handful in 24 but all this stuff is
283.52s: already generally priced in this is all
285.20s: older stuff so none of that really
288.00s: explains the movement that we saw but
289.72s: then volatility just essentially
291.24s: vanished across the board the overall
294.20s: options chain here is light but still
297.76s: very very skewed to calls
300.16s: 523,000 calls against 172,000 puts so
304.48s: big big big call skew we take a look and
306.96s: see what expiration those are centered
308.88s: in there's 91,000 so almost a fifth is
312.76s: in 24 Jan this upcoming expiration 31
315.68s: Jan is at 70k so again another pretty
318.16s: big block it tailor off for 7even Feb 14
321.44s: Feb is really light 21 Feb is kind of
324.52s: the next
325.68s: heaviest and then we don't see another
328.88s: big one until 17 April which these
331.36s: further out expirations are kind of
332.88s: normal to see a little more depth in
335.04s: because these are going to be primary
336.28s: expirations but you know anywhere from 6
338.52s: 9 12 months uh I don't know why I would
341.48s: say 12 months that was pretty dumb
343.84s: around 3 to 6 months is what I was going
345.68s: for I guess I just got really excited
347.44s: because I can move in 3 369 I got I got
350.80s: excited and 18 July is super light 16
355.36s: Jam 60,000 so pretty light and then 15
358.52s: Jam nobody's out there yet so it's a bit
360.92s: of a mix between some of these primary
363.48s: initial nearer term expirations that we
366.28s: see the bulk and then we see a couple
367.84s: concentrations out in 17 April 20 June
369.80s: this is important because as we watch
372.04s: for options flow to see if anything
373.84s: might be materializing any positioning
376.08s: might be coming out we look for
377.32s: deviations off of this and where it is
381.04s: so that's why I flagged that for you we
384.04s: look at TNS time and sales There Was You
386.88s: Know Standard Market activity today uh
389.04s: most of the trades were on the smaller
391.04s: side of things but the larger trades as
393.68s: far as quantity size were a lot of
396.52s: pretty far out of the money so like this
398.72s: 303 393 contract but you can see that
402.52s: there was a decent size trade here in
404.64s: the 24 Jan 25 29 and a half calls but
407.88s: even those as a overall premium value
411.44s: not too noteworthy and to show that a
414.56s: little clear we'll grab our friends over
417.68s: at unusual Wales here and we can take a
420.40s: look through let's get rid of the put
422.80s: side of the equation for now just to
424.00s: look at calls and this is looking for
426.12s: this week and I'm not filtering it by
428.00s: the side of the trade I'm just looking
429.72s: at all of them and looking at the
431.36s: premium you can see that there's just
433.72s: not a lot of really sizable trades
436.84s: coming through right now there was one
439.36s: but again this is for an old expiration
441.20s: that already came up for the 17th of Jan
445.48s: so no real no real takea away from that
448.28s: they probably would have moved their
449.24s: position out and we can see let's keep
452.40s: DTE above zero for now and see any new
456.84s: stuff that is recently cropped up and
460.32s: it's all pretty small stuff there's this
462.52s: trade here the 22s that are N9 days
464.72s: that's a a decent size trade but that's
467.08s: still not like uh you know overly
469.80s: significant trade as far as I'm
471.68s: concerned okay let's talk about a couple
474.36s: trade updates in the coverage triangle
476.44s: so for those that don't know I
478.16s: essentially broke part of my GameStop
480.68s: position aside my Holdings and I'm
482.44s: trading the coverage strangle here which
483.84s: is an option strategy to try to show you
486.68s: how we can use options to help enhance a
489.60s: Buy and Hold position so right now as it
491.88s: sits I'm actually down to 200 shares at
494.44s: a basis of 2827 what ended up happening
497.60s: was on the 14th of j i Unwound 100
501.04s: shares the basis of those was
503.92s: 2431 I sold them for
506.12s: $28.90 and it was uh p&l real ized of
510.52s: 460 bucks the reason for that sale was
514.20s: just to lighten the load a little bit
516.56s: during this down move because I didn't
518.16s: know how far it was going to come down
519.68s: and you can see of the total amount
522.04s: that's cash secured of this allocation
524.44s: of $25,000 it's only 22.6% right now in
527.36s: the equity the reason why that's so
529.12s: important is because I can always buy
530.68s: more it's easy for me to add but what
534.16s: becomes a little more challenging is
535.68s: that if it does continue this decline I
538.24s: don't want to hold a higher basis
540.64s: because it does me no real good I can't
544.36s: sell calls against it above my basis I
546.24s: would have to sell them below my bases
547.64s: which becomes a problem in something
549.16s: specifically like GameStop I am way more
551.36s: reluctant to sell calls below my basis
553.08s: in GameStop as compared to other things
554.72s: because of how quickly it can start to
557.08s: move that can be a big problem and again
559.24s: this is a standard lesson for the
561.08s: coverage strangle not limited to
562.52s: GameStop but it's understanding how to
564.28s: tailor the strategy to the individual
566.88s: underlying that we're looking at and in
568.80s: this case we no GameStop can have really
570.48s: big moves the next thing here is you can
573.72s: see I took down a few of the short puts
577.72s: that we had didn't take them down for
579.56s: much but what I'm doing is I'm regaining
583.12s: spot price sensitivity so this one came
586.56s: down because the 28s essentially were
589.44s: starting to fall in the money and then
591.48s: the 26s are getting close to being at
594.16s: the money so all I did was consolidate
596.32s: these trades so on the 17th I offered
600.80s: five of the 25 strike 21 Feb 25s for6
605.20s: pretty light premium relative to
606.48s: GameStop but still an incredibly good
608.96s: return on invested Capital there and
610.64s: then you can see I still have the 200
612.28s: shares so I'm only selling one call
614.92s: against them so right now I'm short the
617.84s: 21 Feb 35 call it was a 35 Delta when I
621.20s: sold it and the premium on that was
624.48s: $1.93 so the total realized p&l on the
627.80s: trade is 1,070 bucks bucks the total p&l
630.68s: including the equity position and the
632.88s: open options is
635.24s: 1633 so we are we are in the early
638.12s: stages of this entire thing we're not
640.64s: really moving things too quickly we're
643.60s: just playing it nice and conservatively
645.64s: but keeping a really nice sensitive
647.80s: basis because right now we're only
651.88s: 72.6% utilized so what that means is
654.72s: even though I have cash secured puts out
656.76s: right now that are in 21 FB what it
659.32s: allows me to do is that if GameStop
660.96s: starts moving I can just buy shares
662.68s: again in order to to capture that
664.56s: movement and to participate to the
666.56s: upside and if it does unfortunately
668.92s: continue its downward move I'll be in a
670.44s: position to still manage the trade make
672.68s: as much money as I can so that I can
674.20s: continue scaling the position the total
676.28s: value of the position as it sits right
677.96s: now is just over 26k so the trade is
681.60s: already making realized Capital which is
684.76s: important because that's now a, more
686.84s: dollars that I can buy of this specific
689.92s: Equity without adding any more money
691.56s: this is where compounding will start to
693.36s: occur so as always if there's any
695.44s: questions let me know be an outlier be
697.48s: an ape I'll see youall later
