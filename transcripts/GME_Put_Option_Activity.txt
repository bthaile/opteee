0.48s: gme options chain is showing some signs
3.00s: of life but not in the way that I was
5.44s: expecting to see so what happened today
7.84s: well it was down a little bit about
10.52s: 2.2% we are not making the movement I
13.68s: was hoping to see which is a little bit
15.32s: more of a continuation to the upside
17.16s: here it looks like we are starting to
20.00s: sell off more into this value area which
24.08s: I was hopeful that we might start
25.84s: ticking back up above this point of
27.80s: control people transacting in and if we
30.36s: take a look at the volume today it's
32.36s: still quite anemic but the overwhelming
36.20s: majority is sell volume
39.44s: 93% so there's a couple things going on
42.72s: here the main thing I'm seeing from a
44.36s: volume perspective though is just less
46.56s: activity in GameStop now what I thought
49.92s: was interesting today was what was going
52.28s: on in the options chain so if we take a
54.72s: peak over here a couple things jump out
57.52s: of me the first one take a look at the
59.64s: open interest it's changed massively now
63.12s: it's already at
64.56s: 64,000 calls to 360,000 puts so we are
70.24s: approximating much closer to at least
72.32s: the 2:1 ratio that I tend to see before
75.60s: these things start getting really active
77.44s: specifically to the upside now the other
80.04s: thing I noticed right from the jump is a
83.24s: pretty healthy split in expirations for
87.28s: the calls and the puts here's what I
89.56s: mean by that that if you take a look at
91.32s: these calls you'll notice that the
93.16s: larger contracts are in 16 Aug right
97.36s: that's what these these boxes that are
100.44s: higher up on this list indicate a higher
103.32s: open interest so we can see that the
105.88s: 125s are really heavy we can see that
107.88s: these 30s are heavy and so on and so
109.88s: forth the majority of the heavier calls
112.92s: are out here in 16 Aug as indicated by
115.72s: their being the same color box they
117.56s: really make this stuff pretty much
120.40s: idiot proof for people like me that like
122.48s: shapes and colors and they do a great
124.32s: job making it pretty easy to see what's
126.36s: going on here but then if you take a
128.00s: look over here it's a completely
130.20s: different story isn't it when I look at
132.48s: the open interest I see a massive block
135.52s: up here 17 Jan 2025 the 10 puts
140.64s: 16810 of those then I see a bunch of
144.36s: stuff out here in 16 a then I see
147.56s: another one here out in 8 18 o 24 back
152.76s: to 17
154.24s: jan25 so what I'm highlighting is that
157.36s: there's quite a bit of activity on the
160.36s: put side that spans a bunch of different
163.40s: expirations we don't necessarily see the
166.56s: same level of disparity between
169.56s: expiration Cycles on the call side
172.60s: interesting
174.44s: next volume for today this stuck out
177.96s: like a sore thumb on the put side on the
181.44s: put side up here I can see for nine a 24
186.20s: the 22s there was
188.24s: 5,000 of those that traded that
191.44s: immediately is something I'm interested
193.52s: in I also see a pretty healthy block for
196.24s: this coming expiration cycle which is
198.32s: pretty standard fair for what I tend to
200.68s: see in GameStop where the front
202.08s: expiration tends to be pretty busy so
204.40s: nothing really sticking out there to me
206.96s: same thing with this this 16 a I fully
210.84s: anticipate to see more and more activity
213.60s: essentially in this front expiration
215.08s: cycle the two a and then the 16 Aug that
218.32s: all about what I expect to see now as I
222.00s: start looking in at kind of the
224.60s: distribution within this dense area and
228.76s: I can get a sense of what's transacting
231.44s: where how busy these different
233.12s: exploration Cycles are but then you
234.60s: start going out here and you notice an
237.00s: interesting
238.00s: Trend I see the the 110s the 115s the
243.60s: 120s and the 125s being relatively busy
247.40s: out here in 16 Jan 26 now I also notice
251.52s: it a little bit on the call side though
254.44s: so this can be setting up smaller trades
257.24s: looking at things um like spreads
261.20s: between the call and the put side it
263.52s: could be we don't know yet we have to
264.96s: take a look so then what I like to do is
267.16s: say okay first thing I want to take a
269.52s: look at is these nine Aug 22s because
272.84s: that's a lot on the put side and then on
275.40s: the call side this does not surprise me
277.24s: to see the two augs getting really
279.28s: really
280.28s: active this is essentially what I
282.84s: anticipated seeing we're seeing buildout
284.96s: of all of these closer to the at the
287.12s: money strikes which is kind of what
289.40s: we've talked about
290.76s: before no surprise coming in here now as
294.92s: I mentioned though on the put side this
297.92s: is kind of interesting to me this
300.20s: position built out nine OG at the 22s so
303.08s: if we pop over there nine OG at the 22s
306.16s: we can see this is interesting and it's
309.36s: interesting because the open interest
311.60s: existing was
313.08s: 363 except the volume today was
316.60s: 5,000 that's a really great alert that
320.52s: something is going on don't really know
322.92s: what yet takes a little more digging to
324.60s: find out but when you see instances
327.48s: where the current open interest is so
330.32s: low and the volume is so high somebody's
334.32s: interested in this at this level for a
336.84s: very specific reason this only 11 days
339.76s: out and we definitely want to see what
342.64s: this transaction was whether we bought
344.84s: or sold on those so we can come in here
348.64s: into time and sales and they're right
351.16s: there so you can see there's 526 of them
355.48s: at the N9 o 22 puts and these came in at
359.36s: 30 so these were bought now we can get
362.52s: even more specific by grabbing just the
365.32s: put side we can go specifically to that
367.40s: n OG series we can go specifically to
369.48s: the
370.40s: 22s where that activity was and see how
374.76s: active this series was and take a
377.56s: look bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
380.64s: baby that's essentially what there's
382.76s: people just piling on Long puts that's
385.16s: what this is massive amount of long puts
387.24s: being piled on and these all flowed
390.48s: through pretty similar time notice that
392.96s: 08 36 31 seconds all of them dumped out
398.12s: some of them went to ax some of them
399.84s: routed best some C2 just all over the
402.60s: place all these different exchanges
403.96s: routing so there's a pretty sizable
406.72s: position being built out via long puts
410.04s: in the nine OG that's of interest to me
412.80s: that's a bearish position I want to keep
415.20s: an eye on
416.24s: that I don't have a great sense of what
418.76s: it is yet other than potentially just
421.28s: following this near-term trend that
423.40s: we're seeing to the
424.64s: downside now the other thing that I
426.68s: noticed as I told you before if we go
429.68s: back to Oi that there's a lot of this
432.44s: volume buildout way out in Far In Time
434.88s: 16 Jan 26 the 125s I see the 120s active
438.84s: I see the 115s active these tail style
441.92s: puts are interesting to me you can also
443.32s: see them happening over here super far
445.84s: out in time super far out of the money
448.20s: 125s um
450.16s: so there's been a lot of activity there
451.60s: so we can also hone in on that for this
453.88s: one I'll use unusual whales cuz it's a
455.36s: little easier to see and here's the
458.64s: takeaway from my perspective on this at
460.76s: least I see a giant mix of bids coming
465.96s: in pretty small sizes 15 10 a lot of 10
470.60s: and they're hitting the 115s the 125s in
474.28s: the
475.04s: 120s so these trades aren't necessarily
478.28s: massive but there's a lot of repeat
481.68s: positions and you can see that again
483.64s: like I for GameStop I've calibrated my
486.72s: initial interest and premium to be about
488.60s: six figures that's where I start to get
490.88s: pretty curious and then when I see
492.84s: repeat hits like this I'm also curious I
495.96s: want to keep an eye on these now these
497.76s: are still relatively small and the other
500.44s: thing that you can see is that there are
502.24s: some asks at the same sizes and the same
506.00s: strikes so some of these can almost be
508.36s: calendarized because you can see for
510.48s: example here these 120s are in
515.64s: 2025 and then you can see 120s here same
519.08s: expiration cycle same strike essentially
522.40s: same time right 093 859 versus 57 that
527.04s: starts to look like a spread that was
528.52s: Leed into to me so some of this looks
531.20s: like a spread being built some of this
533.48s: doesn't look like that but there are
534.84s: instances like this again here this
536.76s: looks like a spread being built this
539.00s: came in at 101018 10119 this was at the
542.00s: bid this one's at the offer 115 same
544.36s: expiration cycle so there's a lot of
547.40s: different activities going on here but
549.08s: the most interesting thing I'm finding
550.88s: right now is all of the busyness out in
553.56s: 2025 2026 we have not seeing this
555.88s: activity out that far to this degree
558.92s: since essentially I started looking at
560.28s: this more
561.40s: closely um in May so this is something I
564.44s: want to keep an eye on now what's the
565.88s: takeaway from this for for me and the
568.20s: way that I synthesize information is too
569.92s: early to tell more over than that these
571.84s: are so far out in time I don't want to
574.48s: say it doesn't matter but it kind of
575.96s: doesn't matter yet that's that's really
578.32s: part of what I see here now what I can
581.12s: say is that people that are selling puts
584.36s: at the 125 handle the 120 handle it's
588.12s: just an interesting position that's
589.56s: probably designed to do something very
591.24s: specific within a portfolio this doesn't
593.80s: necessarily look like a highly
595.68s: speculative position to me because I do
597.36s: not think that people are selling these
598.80s: puts expecting GameStop to fly up and
602.28s: out of this that they would make way
605.48s: more money if they use long calls than
607.88s: short puts for that but if they want to
611.44s: collect a little bit of positive data
613.12s: and if they have a little bit more stuff
614.52s: in the portfolio that they're looking to
616.12s: offset while still having some long
617.88s: Deltas there's a lot of different
620.24s: specific reasons why this position could
622.08s: be structured the way it is but I
624.16s: wouldn't consider this a highly
625.68s: speculative trade although there is
627.96s: speculation clearly going on here this
629.76s: is a little bit more what I would
631.00s: consider to be like an inside trade
633.56s: these are smaller sizes they're deep in
635.56s: the money so the margin requirement on
637.36s: these positions is not going to be
639.20s: insane and yeah I mean we can take a
642.68s: quick look at those out in uh 16 gen 26
647.08s: here and we can see where they're
649.28s: starting to get active which again like
651.96s: it it's just still not a tremendous
654.88s: amount of volume there's decent volume
657.16s: right 77 8650 's there's decent volume
660.88s: but it's not like crazy volume anything
663.68s: that I would be shocked about like none
665.36s: of these even exceed the existing open
667.72s: interest so they look like interesting
669.76s: positions that people are building out
671.24s: out here they could just be trying to
672.88s: capture this extrinsic value capturing
675.56s: on a little bit of put skew maybe you
677.56s: know be able to take in a little bit of
679.48s: these moves when they get price
680.56s: accommodation but these aren't nearly as
683.08s: speculative is buying something like
684.52s: long calls they won't make as much money
686.40s: in that scenario they need a really big
688.04s: move before they would pay out pretty
689.64s: meaningfully so the punchline here is we
692.84s: will keep an eye on them as always if
695.80s: there's any questions anything you want
697.08s: me to take a look at send it to me I'm
699.00s: happy to take a look I'll see you guys
700.64s: on YouTube live later today be an
702.08s: outlier catch you guys later
