0.00s: What's up outliers?
1.40s: Welcome back to Outlier Options Trading Quick Tips.
4.00s: We've learned something new in three minutes or less today.
6.40s: We are talking about Tango in backwardation.
10.60s: Now this is simply a way to visualize volatility across different
15.64s: expiration cycles.
17.24s: Now I'm using VIX futures because there's a really clean plot like this that
22.24s: I help illustrate the point.
23.84s: However, this applies to any options chain because as you know,
29.04s: options chains each have their own implied volatility is and obviously
32.96s: they represent different durations.
35.56s: So using VIX futures, we can see that the current cycle here,
42.32s: which is the April 25, we can see that volatility here is currently
47.44s: priced at 25 or so.
50.76s: And we can take a look at the next cycle, which is out in May.
56.44s: And you can see it's down here at 2035.
60.32s: So this represents backwardation.
64.48s: Hypically speaking, we expect to see future options or future
70.24s: explorations with slightly higher volatility than front.
74.96s: So typically speaking, this relationship that you see between
79.68s: August and September, this is called Kintango.
83.80s: And this is normal.
85.28s: And Tango is where the longer dated cycle has higher volatility
91.96s: price than to it than the near dated cycle.
94.56s: And more often than not, you'll see this kind of relationship
97.64s: where the line generally will slope up into the right.
101.64s: However, during periods like now, where volatility is actually
105.40s: quite elevated compared to what volatility is expected to be
112.44s: slightly further out in time, this is when you'll see the front volatility
116.64s: or spot volatility being priced more richly than longer dated
121.20s: fall.
121.64s: And again, this is backwardation.
123.40s: And then this configuration is Kintango.
125.72s: As always, any questions?
126.92s: Let me know.
127.40s: Be an ally.
128.04s: See you later.
