0.00s: What's up to all the outliers, Eric here.
2.80s: I got a video for you on using implied volatility
6.56s: in your options trading.
8.36s: And then I also have a couple interesting uses
11.04s: that you might not know of for implied volatility.
14.44s: So let's dive straight over and get into it.
17.52s: Now the very first thing is you have to promise me
20.08s: when I start flashing this first piece up
22.44s: that you're not immediately gonna run away
23.96s: because it does include a formula,
26.12s: but you have to trust me.
27.68s: We'll get through it.
28.48s: I'm not gonna spend a bunch of time on the formula.
30.40s: I just wanna talk about implied volatility,
33.84s: implied volatility percentile and implied volatility rank
38.36s: because traders use all of them interchangeably
42.28s: and they're all different.
44.04s: So it's important to understand the difference between them
47.16s: because in my opinion,
48.84s: one of them is far more useful than the other two.
53.12s: So first, let's start with the heavier one.
56.40s: Again, don't let the formula scare you, stand your ground.
61.32s: There it is.
62.16s: It's actually not that bad.
63.56s: So if you're familiar with the black shul's model,
65.84s: that's what you're seeing here.
67.52s: We're looking at how you calculate implied volatility
70.72s: for calls and puts.
72.00s: Again, I'm not gonna go too far in detail here.
74.44s: I'm just throwing it in there
75.60s: for the people that are interested in it.
77.56s: Now, that part aside,
79.92s: let's take a look at what implied volatility is.
83.52s: In short, it simply is a forward looking projection.
88.68s: So it is when the market attempts to forecast the future.
93.68s: We wanna know how much variance we expect to see
98.04s: in the price of an underlying.
100.00s: That's all implied volatility is.
102.12s: Implied meaning forward looking.
104.88s: It's a projection, which is different
107.08s: than historical volatility, which is, as you guessed,
111.40s: previous in nature.
112.48s: It is what actually happened.
114.84s: So when we're trading options,
117.32s: we really care about implied volatility.
120.08s: Now, there is an argument to be made
121.96s: in one of my favorite strategies, actually,
124.56s: is to track the historic variation
128.32s: between implied volatility and historic volatility
131.40s: to see how over-understated it is.
134.44s: That's actually a very useful metric.
136.52s: But that part aside, for options trading,
139.48s: implied volatility is really the main show in town.
143.08s: Otherwise, historic volatility really applies
146.28s: more to the underlying itself, the stock,
149.68s: not so much for options.
151.76s: Okay, so now that we know what implied volatility is,
155.16s: why do we care about implied volatility percentile
159.60s: or implied volatility rank?
162.08s: Well, as a raw number,
165.20s: implied volatility can be very misleading.
168.08s: And I will show you an example right now.
171.88s: Let's take a look at HUT, which is HUT 8 mining corp,
175.44s: and a stock that is absolutely given me the hardest time.
180.00s: But anyways, the implied volatility in here is 490.17%.
186.44s: 490.17% is that high or is that low?
192.84s: It might seem high because it's a high number,
195.60s: but is this actually high for HUT?
200.00s: If we look at implied volatility by itself,
203.00s: it's very difficult to answer that question.
206.16s: Let's switch over to Apple.
208.16s: Apple's implied volatility is 46.08%.
212.84s: Again, I ask the same question.
214.44s: Is that high or is that low relative for Apple?
219.00s: When we're looking at Apple at that point in time,
222.16s: do we know if premiums are juiced up
225.00s: because implied volatility is high
226.96s: or because implied volatility is low?
229.40s: You can't really tell with implied volatility.
231.48s: That's exactly what I'm kind of explaining here.
234.32s: When we look at implied volatility as a raw figure,
236.48s: it's not that useful because it doesn't really give you
239.56s: any context.
240.92s: You can have a stock like HUT that maintains implied volatility
245.80s: that's in the hundreds over periods of time.
248.84s: It's very normal for HUT,
250.28s: whereas Apple is a little bit different.
252.36s: So we use things like implied volatility percentile
255.84s: and implied volatility rank to give us context.
259.20s: Now, what's the difference between the two?
261.08s: And which one is better, most importantly,
263.84s: the difference is in the way that they're calculated.
266.52s: Which one is better in my opinion is very simple.
269.32s: It is implied volatility percentile hands down.
272.00s: Let's find out why.
273.48s: Implied volatility percentile simply takes the number
277.00s: of trading days below the current IV
281.32s: and it divides it by 252.
283.44s: So it gives you a scale of how many days were below
287.40s: the current implied volatility over a year essentially.
291.08s: When we look at implied volatility rank,
293.56s: it is the current implied volatility minus the 52-week IV low
298.96s: divided by the 52-week IV high minus the 52-week IV low.
305.00s: What are you seeing in the difference between these two
308.36s: formulas?
309.52s: And I give you a pretty big hint here.
311.96s: It is this right here.
315.40s: IV rank exposes you to extreme outlier skew.
320.48s: Now, this isn't that prevalent when the markets are relatively
324.68s: stable or going through a correction like we are right now.
327.64s: Today is the 11th of May.
329.80s: Now, during the COVID drop, after we experienced the COVID drop
334.60s: and we had implied volatility run to essentially levels
338.96s: that a lot of stocks hadn't seen in literally a decade plus,
343.92s: that movement skewed IV rank for an extended period of time
350.40s: because that 52-week IV high hung out there
355.88s: until 52 weeks rolled by and that data was completely clear
360.20s: down of the calculation.
362.40s: So implied volatility rank is definitely
365.28s: more susceptible to skew.
367.44s: Implied volatility percentile, much less prone to experiencing
371.92s: that same skew.
373.28s: So now, I hope we have a general understanding
376.08s: of implied volatility, implied volatility percentile,
380.80s: tough one there, and then implied volatility rank.
383.64s: Now, let's talk about some of the uses for implied volatility,
387.84s: which I will refer to again, just like is every other trader,
390.64s: is whichever one we're looking at.
393.16s: So we can use implied volatility to gauge sentiment
397.28s: as well and most importantly, in my opinion,
400.40s: for strategy selection.
401.84s: Let's look at it an example, gauge sentiment.
404.92s: Now, if knowing what we know now, we come over here and we say,
408.68s: okay, the implied volatility percentile
411.08s: in the apple is 46%.
413.32s: The implied volatility percentile, which this is wrong,
416.72s: this is implied volatility rank,
418.80s: think or swim flags this wrong, very frustrating,
421.96s: but it's saying that implied volatility,
423.96s: current implied volatility rank is 77%.
427.24s: If we want to know the implied volatility percentile,
430.04s: what that actually is, I use a think script so that I can see it.
434.20s: And you can see the delta between the two even now.
437.12s: Implied volatility rank 77%,
439.32s: implied volatility percentile 98%, very different.
443.64s: So anyways, now we look at apple
447.68s: and we can gain some pretty helpful information.
451.40s: If we're looking at strategy selection,
454.24s: we can immediately use things like implied volatility percentile,
458.12s: actual implied volatility percentile, that's my preference, IVP.
462.24s: We can use that to inform how we want to play something.
465.92s: For example, if I wanted to play apple to the upside here,
470.52s: I'm bullish.
472.00s: I can let's pick two traits.
473.64s: I can either buy a call or I can sell a put.
476.36s: How do I decide between the two other than the structural differences
480.64s: between the trade?
482.04s: The main difference differentiator for me
485.00s: is actually implied volatility percentile
488.08s: because if we buy a call and implied volatility contracts,
496.00s: that hurts the call.
497.92s: It means that we need to be even more directionally correct
501.52s: in order to make money.
502.88s: Implied volatility directly impacts the premium of options.
506.28s: As implied volatility increases, premiums increase,
509.96s: as implied volatility decreases, premiums decrease.
514.04s: So with that known, if I see something like this
517.60s: where I'm bullish in Apple and I see implied volatility percentile
521.84s: is 98%, I am going to drift to short premium strategies.
527.08s: That's not to say that implied volatility
529.96s: cannot remain elevated or even increase higher.
534.24s: It most certainly can, but it's less likely to do that.
539.00s: So the higher we see implied volatility percentile,
541.84s: the more I tend to drift to short premium strategies
545.40s: for that exact reason.
546.92s: Now, the other thing to keep in mind here
549.08s: is implied volatility, generally speaking,
552.40s: is one of the more mean reverting aspects of the market.
557.00s: So it's just a higher statistical probability
560.48s: that we will see this revert down to a mean.
563.84s: So because of that, when I see implied volatility
566.08s: percentile at extremes, either to the low or high side,
570.16s: I use that to make inferences about the strategy
573.84s: I'm going to select.
575.52s: If this said implied volatility percentile was zero,
579.52s: that would tell me it is more likely
581.68s: that implied volatility percentile
584.04s: or implied volatility as a raw figure
585.72s: is going to expand in the future.
588.88s: So because of that, I would lean towards a long premium strategy
593.44s: to take advantage of that implied volatility expansion.
596.60s: It's a way for us to kind of stack probabilities
600.04s: in our favor beyond just a directional assumption.
603.40s: So I always lace in implied volatility
607.28s: in my strategy selection.
609.00s: I typically will pick direction first
611.16s: because direction will absolutely overwhelm implied volatility
616.16s: changes, but if we can get them both to work together,
619.20s: it's very useful.
620.52s: Now, the last thing I want to show you
622.72s: is using implied volatility as a gauge for sentiment.
626.84s: Two ways we can do that the first way.
629.12s: If we see implied volatility in this sense is very high,
633.36s: it means that the market is pricing in a lot of volatility
638.24s: to the premium of the options.
640.00s: So what we're understanding is that there is whip expected.
643.80s: We are expecting larger price variance.
648.00s: So when we see implied volatility is high,
650.52s: the very first thing we should think is premiums are high.
653.48s: The second thing we should think is prices
656.24s: are going to move in a wider range
660.04s: as implied volatility increases.
662.44s: Now, the other way we can use it to gauge sentiment
665.08s: is a really useful tool.
666.68s: Over here on the right hand side
668.20s: and thinkorswim, you can see all of these percentages.
672.32s: This is telling you the implied volatility for that month.
677.32s: And the other thing that you'll know is this plus and minus.
679.88s: This is actually doing some of the work for you.
682.28s: And it's telling you the expected range
685.12s: based on that implied volatility for the month.
687.60s: Now, if we scroll down through here,
690.88s: you'll notice a couple things.
692.24s: Typically, as we start to go further out in time,
694.92s: implied volatility starts to decrease.
698.12s: So we see 60% upfront, 50%, 48%, 45%, 44%,
704.44s: 45%, 41%, 48.71%.
709.40s: What's going on here?
711.20s: Why would we be generally declining
713.44s: but then all of a sudden rise up about seven points?
716.56s: Well, you can start to glean a lot of information from this.
720.76s: As in, there's probably earnings being priced into this cycle.
725.48s: So if you want to trade Apple
727.52s: and you don't want to be exposed to earnings,
730.40s: there is very likely an earnings event around this month.
733.48s: It's not announced yet,
734.96s: but if we think about it logically,
736.76s: it makes total sense because earnings
738.80s: just announced the end of April.
742.04s: So if we start to think about where earnings
744.72s: is likely to be next quarter, three months out,
748.04s: that puts us right around this ballpark.
750.96s: And as we get more explorations around this time frame,
755.28s: because there's only so many expiration cycles offered,
758.04s: so as we get closer to this, you'll see whichever week
762.84s: earnings will be reported
764.12s: and will have higher volatility
765.72s: than the other surrounding weeks.
767.32s: So we can use implied volatility
769.92s: to do a ton of different things,
772.32s: as well as figure out when earnings is probably going to be.
