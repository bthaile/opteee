0.04s: let's talk about trading in your IRA
1.92s: account this is one of the less
4.12s: discussed topics because a lot of people
6.28s: kind of set and forget their IRA and I
8.56s: actually think it's a mistake if you're
9.88s: taking the time to build the skill set
11.68s: of trading and you're successful at it
13.72s: there's no reason not to translate that
15.56s: over into your retirement accounts so
18.08s: I'm going to walk you through some
19.28s: different ways you can think about it
20.60s: how I like to think about it and then at
22.24s: the end of the video I'm going to give
23.88s: you a couple actionable strategies that
26.40s: you could bounce around and see if
28.16s: they're a good fit for you or not to
29.96s: employ in your portfolio what's up
31.84s: everybody Eric here welcome back to all
33.32s: the outliers and a shout out to the
34.68s: patreon family you guys make content
36.20s: like this possible if what I do helps
37.72s: you in anyway consider signing up so
39.84s: that I can pay my Editor to make these
41.60s: videos more fun for you to watch should
43.80s: you trade your IRA account my opinion I
47.00s: would argue for yes I think it makes
49.28s: sense and it's for a few reasons the
51.48s: first one is if we look back at 2022
55.24s: using my own account as an example the
57.76s: S&P 500 was down
61.44s: 19.4% yet I ended up the year up
65.36s: 5.3% on my IRA which was about a 15%
69.32s: return on invested Capital 5% 5.3%
72.32s: return on the account itself and this
74.12s: was with 32 trades I did not interact
77.60s: with the portfolio much at all yet I
81.40s: grossly outperformed the s&p500 to me
85.64s: this is why it's worth your
87.08s: consideration so why only $32 trades if
91.16s: I'm you know trading my margin account
93.00s: way more than that well it's for a few
94.64s: reasons the way I approach my IRA is I
98.00s: want to optimize the long-term
100.80s: performance of the account but I don't
102.80s: want to spend a bunch of time in there
104.12s: because again I'm already spending a
105.36s: bunch of time doing a lot of other
106.76s: things so my goal in trading an IRA
109.36s: account is actually wrapped right around
112.12s: efficiency how can I very efficiently
115.32s: trade my portfolio so there's a couple
118.48s: things to keep in mind the whole idea
120.68s: here is trading it is because it's tax
122.84s: advantaged so depending on if it's a
124.64s: Roth or traditional there's different
126.12s: tax advantages that come with both but
128.20s: the reason why this matters is because
129.96s: if you can optimize and Achieve better
133.04s: returns here you kind of double the
135.00s: effect because of the tax considerations
137.52s: so that's why it's worth at least some
139.24s: of your effort now as far as I see it
141.72s: there are kind of two different ways you
143.36s: can go about this you can either employ
145.92s: an an an an inactive did I stutter yes
151.64s: sir yes you did style where you're
154.48s: dollar cost averaging into an index ETF
157.16s: you could do things like spy iwm and the
159.48s: q's you could do things like Leverage
161.68s: dtfs if you're so inclined and this is
164.00s: kind of what that looks like so you can
166.64s: take a look at portfolio visualizer to
169.88s: get an idea of different portfolio
171.44s: structures and whatnot to see how the
173.00s: performance goes but the reason why
175.08s: dollar cost averaging is really
176.84s: important and for those that don't know
178.32s: what that is all we're doing doing is
180.08s: setting a regular Cadence to buy things
182.84s: so if your dollar cost averaging into
184.68s: spy that means like every single month
187.12s: you would put in the same dollar amount
189.12s: into spy and this helps us streamline
192.44s: and smooth our returns if you buy all of
196.24s: it at once then there's a chance you
198.04s: might buy when it's really high and that
200.16s: doesn't benefit you in case it drops but
202.32s: if you buy it every single month well
204.92s: that means that sometimes you'll buy it
206.24s: when it's high sometimes you buy it when
207.60s: it's low sometimes you buy it when it's
208.96s: in the middle so that in the aggregate
211.12s: you actually develop a pretty good cost
213.24s: basis so that's really the idea for an
215.68s: active you can pick something as simple
217.32s: as that then there's more active now
220.16s: again this is nowhere near as active as
221.72s: I am in a margin account but you can
224.32s: kind of combine some of the benefits of
226.44s: this with the skill set that you've
228.64s: taken the time to develop via trading
231.20s: options whether it's Trend trading but
233.28s: for me I tend to look at the coverage
236.48s: strangle which this probably is nothing
238.40s: new to anybody here I actually have a
240.16s: recent video that goes through the
242.32s: coverage triangle in depth which I
244.80s: highly encourage you to take a look at
246.88s: but other things that makes sense in
248.28s: here ratio covered call in diagonals
250.60s: which I have videos about both of those
252.16s: as well all of them will be linked in
253.88s: the notes below but I am not trading a
257.28s: lot of speculative trades in here
258.96s: personally this is all core Style
261.40s: Trading and what that looks like is
264.08s: typically the coverage triangle and I'll
266.36s: show you what that looks like and how I
268.40s: employ it because again it's a pretty
271.16s: optimized approach for me I'm not
272.64s: interacting with the account much at all
274.28s: I probably look at it like once a month
276.04s: if that so let's take a look now at what
278.64s: we can trade in an IRA so that we
282.36s: understand what's available to us so
284.00s: this is from Schwab you're going to have
285.44s: to check with your broker on whatever
287.48s: they offer but these are the different
289.36s: things you can do in a Schwab IRA
292.36s: account these are kind of bigger
294.96s: descriptions on some of the things that
297.48s: you cannot do like short selling selling
300.56s: naked or trading on margin and then for
303.00s: those that are wondering that whether or
305.32s: not you can use like portfolio margin in
308.16s: an IRA account you canot again double
311.68s: check with your broker they'll each be
313.44s: slightly different but this is generally
315.92s: what you're able to do so if you'll take
317.84s: a look the coverage triangle fits into
319.80s: this no problem now let's take a look at
322.92s: how I deploy the coverage triangle in a
325.08s: quick kind of overview style the
327.24s: strategy itself is pretty bullish that's
330.04s: where we make the most money but it does
332.08s: okay in neutral market conditions you
334.32s: can tailor it different ways to appeal
337.36s: to either income or growth and then once
339.40s: you take the time to develop the
340.72s: strategy it's it's really rinse and
342.16s: repeat I'm not spending a lot of time
343.64s: each month doing this this is why for
345.88s: the coverage triangle I typically trade
347.32s: in index ETF and I just cycle the
349.64s: product in there now for a year like
352.16s: 2022 when the markets down a lot notice
354.88s: how this doesn't work well in bearish
356.88s: conditions so how did I walk out
358.48s: unscathed
363.64s: by dollar cost averaging in and by the
366.52s: short call component to the strategy
368.96s: that's how I ended up making money so
370.92s: all in all I think something like the
373.60s: coverage strangle probably makes sense
375.64s: in quite a few people's portfolios had
377.84s: to Center myself there I was way off
379.44s: kilter throwing me off but I think the
381.48s: coverage strangle is a great choice in
384.00s: an IRA account it's something that you
385.88s: can build a sustainable position in an
388.52s: index ETF and us-based index ETFs
391.80s: continue to make highs over time it's
393.92s: not like what you see in Japan meaning
396.00s: you can dollar cost average into
398.08s: something like this with your entire
399.64s: account and still make sense long term
402.08s: now if you are a little more risk averse
404.44s: you're trying to appeal to different
406.08s: portfolio objectives you could build a
408.60s: split portfolio that you trade coverage
410.48s: strangles so you can have your Equity
412.44s: allocation again via index ETF and then
414.76s: you can have a bond allocation that you
416.44s: also trade the coverage strangle in the
418.04s: reason why it's such a great approach is
419.64s: because it allows us to dollar cost
421.16s: average in regularly overall if it's a
423.08s: down Market that actually gives us a lot
424.64s: of ability to make a bunch of money when
426.16s: we get a rebound because this is a
427.64s: longer term hypothesis and then you're
429.48s: also trading short calls against it so
431.48s: when things do go down you start to
433.24s: hedge some of that risk and make a
434.72s: little bit of money even when things are
436.32s: kind of trending flat so let me know
438.12s: what you think if it was helpful don't
439.68s: forget to like subscribe share with your
441.56s: friends be an outlier I'll see you guys
443.16s: later
