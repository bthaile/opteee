0.00s: What's up, outliers?
1.92s: You know what time it is?
3.20s: It's time to get back to the basics.
5.72s: It's time to look at some fundamental trading concepts so that we can all dust off our
11.52s: skill sets and hopefully make a few dollars out there in the markets.
15.88s: We'll see how it goes.
16.88s: Who knows?
17.88s: Nobody ever knows.
18.88s: So we have a bit of an open agenda for today, although there's a couple of things that
23.60s: I do want to hit on.
25.00s: The first thing is some just kind of poking through the markets and doing a little bit
30.28s: of a recap from a practitioner standpoint.
33.76s: I think talking a little bit about some observations will likely be useful.
38.84s: I also want to cover poking through Reddit just a little bit and using that as a vector
46.88s: to take a look at what a lot of basic concepts being looked at are and things like that.
54.48s: So we have a bunch of things to talk about.
57.52s: So let's start with recapping the markets.
61.88s: And so for the week, we obviously saw a pretty massive turn underway.
68.88s: We saw tech really starting to accelerate to the downside.
72.80s: We saw bond starting to tick up, like equity.
76.04s: Then we start to see IWM, small caps rotating over, cues rotating over and even the spy
82.52s: now starting to rotate over.
84.60s: So really, this is becoming a generally broad market movement that we're seeing.
91.64s: Obviously, we are at the point now where this clearly is in at least at this point, a
98.68s: correction.
99.68s: If not starting to migrate even towards a bear market, not quite there talking about
104.48s: cues specifically, by the way, IWM still hovering right around a correction and then
111.24s: spy is not quite there yet.
113.44s: Spy is the last bastion of strength that to me is slowly, slowly looking like it is rotating
123.72s: over.
124.72s: So for NASDAQ, I see net highs lows negative with gross lows expanding.
130.96s: And I see net highs lows across the New York stock exchange contracting massively.
136.52s: Yesterday, it was at like 141 net and today it's 47 and gross lows is expanding.
143.44s: So market breath doesn't look great here.
147.20s: So the reason why I'm taking a minute to go over this with you all from again, a market
151.52s: practitioner standpoint is because making observations in the market is part of our
156.44s: job as traders.
157.44s: That's what we do.
158.68s: It's how we identify things that look interesting to us that we want to explore, ideally
166.24s: trade.
167.24s: It's how we make money by identifying things that look good.
170.92s: So understanding the broad market in my perspective is a really, really important part of this
175.84s: process.
176.84s: I actually have, let me find it in the handy dandy notebook of all things options trading.
185.48s: This thing, as I've mentioned a few times is starting to get a little unwieldy, but
189.68s: I'll show you.
191.28s: Let me see.
193.24s: Maybe this one.
195.56s: So this is actually going to come out in a video soon, but this idea of like starting
200.56s: from the top and zooming into the individual products is a really, really useful process.
208.72s: So that's a quick recap of the markets.
211.04s: We'll dive more into it, but as you know, we got to grab the chat and we got to say hello
214.68s: to everybody.
215.68s: We got to see who's hanging out.
218.04s: And I also realize I have to turn the air conditioning on in my well up.
222.00s: It's already on.
223.08s: I have to turn it up in the office because even though your boys in a tank top, it is
228.08s: pretty freaking warm here in Southern California.
233.60s: So what do we got?
235.60s: I see we got threshold solutions.
238.28s: That's a really cool name that sounds almost like somebody that clears rooms because
242.60s: that we would call a door during CQB.
246.00s: We would call that a threshold.
247.80s: So it sounds like somebody that's really good at clearing rooms.
252.32s: Maybe that's the case.
253.60s: We got Liz hanging out.
254.60s: We got Knight harm, Joe Tato.
257.96s: Why not roaring Titi?
259.76s: Everybody.
260.76s: We got to give a shout out to Roaring Titi is one of the greatest names on here.
263.72s: Sweetwae the stream.
264.72s: I get confused which stream is which because the thumbnails all look so similar in so
268.88s: many are scheduled ahead.
270.20s: I mean, I purposely go damn it, Roaring Titi.
274.80s: I purposely go through the effort of even bothering with different thumbnails and different
279.64s: titles and you get confused which ones which I'm out here bust in my ass all day trying
286.92s: to make a nice home cooked stock market dinner and then you got to tell me it all tastes the
292.04s: same.
293.04s: This is unbelievable.
293.88s: This is literally unbelievable.
297.24s: We also have Dr. Zayus Vladimir off Putin.
302.04s: Vladimir says I sure wouldn't be shocked to see if or to see all after Fed cuts an election
308.08s: uncertainty is resolved to see all after Fed.
317.36s: To see all green after Fed.
319.48s: Okay, sorry.
320.48s: We needed that correction there.
322.24s: Vladimir off Putin.
323.24s: They made a way more sense now.
327.52s: Yeah, so I actually think that this idea of a soft landing is starting to look increasingly
335.44s: tenuous.
336.44s: That's my take because the market is very good at forecasting and when we look across
343.84s: even the economic picture from the past week, things aren't necessarily looking great.
352.12s: So if we look at PMI from earlier in the week, manufacturing PMI that came in a little
359.12s: bit light manufacturing prices came in a little bit high.
363.12s: That's not necessarily ideal job opening still came in a little bit light which I don't
369.52s: really know anymore how the market's going to interpret that news.
373.20s: Obviously the market didn't like most of what we saw this week.
376.88s: This is PMI came in a little bit higher which I imagined Boads well and then so like as
386.00s: I look across the broader market from the past week, there is a ton of stuff that happened
391.44s: but there was one thing that remained the same.
395.00s: The market essentially sold off the entire week.
399.08s: Yeah, literally the entire week.
402.00s: Roy Titty says I'm not hating.
403.56s: I know you spend a lot of time on all this.
404.96s: It's just my way brain process.
406.36s: Oh yeah, no, obviously I 100% joking.
409.52s: Roy Titty.
410.52s: There's like with the name with a handle like yours, essentially there's you could do
414.56s: no wrong in my eyes.
416.36s: So yeah, you could you could pretty much insult me directly and I still wouldn't care because
420.68s: I like the name too much.
422.20s: It's completely joking.
424.20s: But I mean that you're not wrong, right?
426.28s: Like a lot of the branding is very similar.
428.48s: That's obviously on purpose so that people know when they're looking at something of me versus
432.76s: something else which I also I have to be honest.
435.12s: There was a hilarious comment that I got not too long ago from somebody I did a video
443.28s: this past week.
445.32s: One of them was about something regarding roaring kiddie.
448.52s: So I used him in the thumbnail and somebody was like really pissed about that.
452.32s: They literally said that he should sue me because I used his picture and they thought that
458.56s: the video was going to be his which bless their heart.
464.28s: That's what I have to say just bless their heart.
469.04s: Carlos says you ruined the stock market dinner.
471.52s: Yeah, that's it.
472.52s: You the family's fighting now.
475.36s: Vladimir Putin says in January we would probably look back and now and think why didn't
479.04s: I bounce?
482.52s: I don't know.
483.52s: I certainly don't feel that way.
485.12s: But if you're an investor and you're really gun shy at entering into the market, sure
489.92s: I could see that.
491.40s: But if you're a trader that's absolutely not how you look at the world, right?
498.04s: Because there's still several months before the end of the year.
502.92s: So the idea of not doing anything into the end of the year because of being gun shy.
507.80s: Yeah, that's a problem.
509.20s: But from a trader's perspective, the last thing I'm doing is loading up on a bunch of long
515.48s: beta weighted deltas to the market, to the broad market and just going to hold them into
521.80s: next year until they start to turn that I think is a bit of a problem, right?
530.24s: Because there's an opportunity cost to that capital and it to me, it's some, well, not
536.68s: a sunk cost.
538.04s: But the opportunity cost there is enough that I wouldn't just park money waiting.
544.64s: Now, if you're an investor, nothing wrong with that.
548.36s: That's completely, completely fine for like a longer term perspective.
552.04s: That's the name of the game of investing is maintaining long term exposure to right
555.96s: out the bumps and whatnot.
558.20s: So Zach Rij has made it in.
562.72s: What up Reese's here as well.
564.16s: Cedar Savage says time to pull out bearish strats for a few weeks.
567.24s: Yes.
568.24s: I actually think Cedar Savage, you're behind the ball, to be honest.
572.24s: I don't think you're wrong, but I think one of the problem is depending on what you're
577.92s: trying to trade.
579.32s: If you're just now starting offering short deltas, it's still not too late, I would argue,
585.68s: but they become higher risk entries.
588.72s: And I've talked about this most of the week.
591.60s: So for example, if I look across something like XLE, I've already had fades in XLE after
599.08s: it started breaking out below this level, I actually added more today.
604.00s: And that's actually one of the things I want to review today is I thought one of the things
609.72s: we could do in the beginning of the video is actually take a look at some sample trades
616.56s: and we can kind of reason through them together.
619.72s: So there's two time frames I want to use.
622.08s: I want to use today.
624.04s: So as if we're trying to find a trade to put into a hypothetical portfolio today, I want
629.84s: to do that process.
631.48s: And then the other process I want to do is go back in time and on demand if it works.
636.56s: And see what kind of trade we would structure based on the information we have available.
645.48s: So yeah, that's one of the things I want to take a look at today.
649.12s: But first let's start with some simple stuff.
651.76s: I want to take a stroll through options, the subreddit.
655.88s: And I just want to use this as a way for us to test some different ideas.
662.04s: So in case you guys didn't know for anybody that's wondering what's going on with Vladimir
666.60s: Off-Pooten, as he says he has half the chat blocked from a week ago.
670.64s: So I just want to let half of you know that Vladimir Off-Pooten thinks you ain't shit
676.52s: is essentially what I saw.
678.40s: So yeah, anyways, just wanted to relay that message directly from Vladimir Off-Pooten
684.52s: to the rest of the chat.
685.52s: I'm just the middle man here.
686.80s: I can just see it all.
688.56s: But he's just letting you know his thoughts.
691.84s: But anyways, let's, Carlos goes that's very off-putin of you.
698.96s: That might, I mean, it's on brand.
700.48s: You gotta get, listen, you gotta give credit where credit's due and credit is due there.
704.80s: That's very, that's, I think it's right on point.
707.32s: All right, so let's take a look through some of these.
708.96s: I literally haven't read through them yet, literally right before I started this, I ran
713.28s: through and I opened a few of them that I think would be good to cover.
719.08s: So this one says, bank manager convinced me options are for fools.
725.00s: Let's see what they have to say.
726.36s: Now again, the whole point of this segment and just in case you're new to this, what I'm
731.28s: doing is I use Reddit, the option subreddit as a proxy for beginners.
738.52s: I can see and understand how beginners are looking at the market by going to this
744.56s: Reddit.
745.72s: So why we go through this together is to take a look at other beginner concepts theories,
751.80s: things that they're trying to grapple with because this is a series for beginners.
757.96s: So I use it as a proxy.
760.28s: That's why we go through these and I think there's value in talking about them together,
763.40s: which is the goal.
764.76s: So this person says when in looking for payments cross border, I don't care about any of
772.56s: this.
773.56s: So I traveled.
775.56s: Jesus, where's the fucking.
779.52s: Okay, so the conversation went towards trading.
784.68s: He's up like 50% and I'm down for the year on my options portfolio, my stock portfolio
789.08s: is positive and fluctuates between beating the market 5% to underperforming.
794.32s: On average, much more profitable stock trader, profitable trading options, get greedy.
799.40s: Yeah, see, I hate this.
803.64s: I hate this so much.
805.36s: So one of the reasons why I hate this so much is because when I see traders saying things
810.52s: like I get greedy, it tells me a lot about their understanding of their business.
816.64s: And before we get too far, a quick cheers to you all with my mango orange and then a handful
822.96s: of drugs.
824.16s: So we got to get that a set of medicine down to keep functioning.
827.00s: I don't know how.
835.20s: Nothing like some to highlight on.
838.48s: Really takes the edge off.
840.64s: But so first off for you guys that are in the chat, especially anybody that's been around
845.56s: the community for a little while longer.
847.32s: Why do I not like this?
848.44s: Any ideas?
849.44s: Why do I call out the idea?
850.88s: It's just that I get greedy.
854.16s: Talk to me.
856.20s: Why would I not like that?
858.64s: And let's get past the superficial responses of getting greedy is bad and yeah, of course.
868.12s: Okay, so Kevin and Jotato are hitting on one of the things I specifically wanted to
875.52s: specifically want to highlight is no plan.
878.52s: Seater is actually, it looks like we disconnected standby.
884.60s: Are we, am I still here?
888.36s: It says reconnection successful.
892.48s: I have no idea.
893.84s: Am I currently not, not, can you hear this?
898.08s: Okay, good.
899.08s: You guys can hear it.
900.08s: Thanks.
901.08s: OBS just told me it popped off for some reason.
901.84s: I actually have literally no clue.
904.84s: Maybe somebody is doxing me or so.
906.44s: I don't even know what that means.
907.44s: I'm not going to lie.
909.28s: All right, so let's see.
912.68s: The first one is the definitely no plan, right?
917.04s: The prospect of being greedy during an options trader, really any trade, it tells us right
922.64s: from the jump that you're going, you're not following something that makes sense.
927.72s: And I'll show you exactly why that's the case in a few minutes.
931.24s: So no plan is a big part.
933.48s: There's a really, really, really important specific thing though that I want to highlight
940.16s: from this.
944.44s: And Seater says not mechanical.
946.04s: It's not that.
947.04s: I'm actually a highly discretionary trader.
949.68s: I'm not mechanical.
951.36s: There are absolutely bounds to what I do.
956.40s: But I actually personally believe that a vast majority of the edge for retail traders
962.76s: is discretion.
965.12s: If you're too mechanical as a retail trader, that essentially means whatever you're doing
969.28s: should just be automated.
971.12s: And there's a reason why most of us don't automate everything.
975.12s: And it's because there's not buckets of edge laying around like that, unfortunately.
980.76s: So that's not to suggest you can't automate anything, of course you can.
983.92s: But there is a lot of value in being a good discretionary trader.
989.36s: The reason why the idea of being mechanical as a trader is so well-touted is because
994.84s: it sounds super smart, right?
996.28s: You can't trust the trader.
997.64s: So then just make it a repeatable strategy that you follow these specific rules.
1001.56s: And then you take the trader out of the equation essentially.
1004.64s: Well, guess who creates the edge in trading?
1008.80s: It's the trader.
1010.20s: So there's lots of ways to do that.
1012.96s: And again, I would never say like, oh, being mechanical is dumb or not.
1016.44s: Like I would never say anything like that.
1018.32s: That's just the reason why I'm discretional in my trading.
1021.92s: So just an important note there.
1023.92s: So the plan is part of it.
1027.28s: And then
1031.24s: roaring titty and jote do or on the next part of it.
1034.52s: There's I'll get to the part I want to highlight first.
1037.16s: And then we'll get into those because for roaring titty, I completely, completely agree.
1041.64s: So for roaring titty and jote do not setting a stop can help with this exact thing.
1047.92s: So let's talk about that really quick.
1049.80s: Let's say that we're trading stock XYZ.
1053.20s: This one will talk about a little bit later because I have a position on actually in
1057.40s: this to the downside.
1058.40s: This was going to be an example of finding short deltas.
1060.48s: That's like a current state example.
1062.44s: But we'll get to that in a second.
1063.72s: Let's take a look at Palantir.
1064.96s: They joined the S&P 500 today that just jumped in my mind.
1068.32s: So let's say we're trading Palantir to the upside.
1071.56s: We think it's going to go up sick.
1072.96s: Great thesis makes total sense.
1075.40s: Let's say that you got in here.
1077.72s: And you're like, okay, I'm going to ride this up to whatever my profit target is.
1082.68s: And it's going up, it's going up, it's going up.
1084.60s: And then you're like, oh, I want it to go up higher.
1086.60s: I want it to go up higher.
1087.72s: And then it goes down, down, down.
1089.64s: And then let's say you're like, okay, well, I'm going to add more here because I like their
1093.28s: earnings or whatever.
1094.60s: And then it starts going up, up, up, up, up.
1096.56s: So there are different bounds you can put on your trades.
1101.52s: So for example, if you don't want to go through this cycle, you can say you enter your
1106.80s: trade in here or whatever.
1109.16s: And it goes up, up, up, up.
1110.92s: And then you can say, okay, when I enter here, my stop is going to be near term resistance
1117.24s: support in this case.
1118.72s: Okay, great.
1119.72s: It breaks through this next threshold.
1122.24s: And then it starts trending sideways.
1123.56s: You're like, okay, if it falls and closes below this next support level, then I exit.
1130.44s: So what I did is I moved my stop from there to there.
1133.68s: This is how we capture profits and still let things move on the way up.
1138.16s: So then you could say, okay, it's running up, it's running up.
1140.48s: And then it starts trending sideways.
1142.12s: Even if you choose again to overfit, which that in a statistical terms means I know what
1148.44s: happens in this sense because I'm looking at a historical chart.
1151.52s: So if I wanted to overfit my strategy, I would say something like, oh, yeah, I'm going
1155.44s: to put a move my stop up to here.
1158.24s: But that's unrealistic.
1159.56s: The probabilistic scenario here would be this would probably be the last stop that goes
1164.00s: in.
1165.00s: And then you essentially, I would run it from here.
1168.12s: It would start rounding out.
1169.60s: And then I would get stopped somewhere out here.
1172.00s: So then I do give up some of my profit.
1174.64s: But in the process of attempting to let my profit run, I'm following it.
1181.12s: So that's a really, really, really simple way to essentially set a trailing stop for your
1187.88s: position.
1189.04s: But that's not just based on an arbitrary percentage, although there's nothing wrong
1192.48s: with those.
1193.48s: For me, I like to support, I like to use support and resistance to essentially determine what
1199.44s: I want to use, what makes the most sense for the position.
1202.56s: So that's another thing.
1204.04s: Here's the most important part right here.
1212.40s: Just that I get greedy.
1215.08s: Here's the problem.
1216.96s: When we look at something like this, they think they've identified their problem.
1225.08s: And my guess is they haven't.
1227.68s: So this is really dangerous.
1231.00s: It's really dangerous.
1233.00s: The reason why it's so dangerous is because we think we're being enlightened.
1238.32s: We think that we're being self-critical.
1241.04s: We're really analyzing ourselves and we're even calling ourselves out for a bad behavior,
1246.52s: which is really difficult, right?
1248.32s: It feels like we're doing the right thing.
1250.00s: It feels like we're being self-critical.
1251.40s: Yeah, I'm being greedy.
1252.40s: I'm not supposed to be greedy.
1254.24s: The problem with this is very, very, very likely that there's way more wrong with their
1260.60s: approach than being greedy, but they're not looking because they think they're greedy.
1264.92s: And that's the problem that they're looking at.
1267.52s: So what I'm highlighting here is that when we're analyzing our performance as traders,
1273.52s: we have to analyze the total performance and then quantify our guesses, right?
1278.76s: So like if in this example they give us a ton of different series where they were just
1284.60s: letting their profits run and then they turn into losses, whatever it is, that would
1290.16s: highlight part of the problem.
1291.60s: But is it actually greed or is it that they're trading stuff that's going up and then down
1295.68s: and doesn't actually follow the profit mechanism?
1298.80s: So the point that I'm making here is that when I take a look at this kind of thing,
1304.96s: I think it's so dangerous because they say it's just that I get greedy.
1310.68s: We feel we've identified the problem and we probably fucking haven.
1316.36s: That might be one of the problems.
1318.12s: There's probably not the only problem, but we're not looking for other problems because
1321.52s: we think we found the problem, which probably isn't the only problem.
1325.52s: That's what I see here.
1327.76s: So then it says once you start thinking about money, making plans as if it's a foregone
1331.72s: conclusion, you profit tomorrow.
1333.52s: Yeah, that's all just terrible, terrible psychology.
1338.52s: He started pleading with me to stop trading options that it's a money pit.
1343.80s: He says you could have traveled, married, divorced, lost, okay, whatever.
1348.72s: Back on stocks, that's fine.
1352.80s: You're winning or low.
1355.56s: That's actually not correct.
1358.24s: And when you lose, you have nothing to show for it.
1360.24s: Yep, that's fine.
1362.04s: Yeah, so here's the deal.
1364.48s: When I look at this, I see somebody that is just filled, filled with disillusion.
1371.96s: That's what I see.
1373.56s: Because options and trading in general is not for most people.
1380.44s: That's all there is to it.
1381.96s: For the vast majority of people, they won't make money trading.
1385.48s: It's not even trading options.
1386.84s: It's trading in general.
1389.04s: Options simply amplify what you're doing.
1391.68s: So for example, if this person had some sort of approach that, let's say they were just
1396.92s: trading to the long side, they were trading up.
1399.48s: Their profit mechanism is up.
1401.72s: If they were just trading up and they were really good at picking up, even if they used
1406.64s: options or stock, they would still make fucking money.
1409.76s: They would still make money.
1411.28s: So this isn't options as a problem.
1413.68s: This is a trader problem.
1416.36s: Now the reason why their stock portfolio is doing well is because they're enjoying something
1422.36s: called positive drift.
1425.12s: The vast majority of the stock market goes up in the long run.
1429.40s: So even though they'll go through periods where some of their stocks outperform, some
1433.00s: of their stocks underperform and that's what leads to their variance in relation to
1437.20s: the broader market, that's why that's working for them.
1440.24s: It's not because there's some sort of great stock picker, because if they were some sort
1443.76s: of great stock picker, what you're doing in options would work fantastic.
1448.20s: So this is a prime time example of two things I want you to take away.
1454.48s: The first thing I want you to take away is that this is dangerous.
1460.16s: If you think that there are faults in your trading, we all have them.
1464.28s: Do not relegate the performance to one single fault.
1468.76s: It is highly unlikely to be the case.
1472.44s: It's very likely that there are multiple things that lead into the problem set.
1478.08s: The second thing is that options amplify whatever you're doing.
1483.68s: So if you're trading, you have to start with the profit mechanism first.
1490.80s: You'll hear me say that until I fucking die because I think all of us is options traders.
1496.40s: We start looking at options and trading options before we even have a profit mechanism that
1503.12s: works.
1504.96s: Start with the profit mechanism, get something that works.
1507.84s: Then whether you trade stocks, whether you trade options, whatever the fuck you trade,
1512.48s: if you can reliably identify a profit mechanism, the rest are just tools that help you take
1518.64s: advantage of it.
1519.96s: So that is the point here.
1526.08s: Evergreen says, is this guy teaching a course to morons?
1528.56s: I'm way too advanced and experienced to listen to this.
1530.68s: Been trading options for years.
1531.84s: Please see something higher level.
1533.64s: So evergreens, this is a great example of somebody who thinks that they're further
1538.84s: along than they are because for somebody like you, I would highly recommend just like
1543.80s: in trading, the Devils and the Details, I would read the name of the stream.
1548.36s: Try that out for yourself.
1549.80s: So what you'll notice is at the tail end of the title for the stream, it actually says
1555.04s: options trading for, there's a very specific term in there.
1560.40s: Beginners, that's who this is for.
1562.32s: So not morons, that's not it at all.
1565.24s: Beginners are people who simply are trying to learn something new.
1569.40s: So they're starting point and how much information and background they have and something is going
1573.24s: to be naturally lower.
1574.92s: So that's why we're talking about these things.
1576.84s: So yeah, I actually feel a little sad for you because if you can't read the title of
1583.76s: the stream, it'll probably be really difficult to trade long term successfully.
1588.60s: Again, Devils and the Details, but certainly wish you the best.
1592.60s: So yeah, my guess is this stream is not for you.
1594.76s: This is absolutely for beginners as it's been for the past.
1598.28s: However many Fridays we've been doing this like two, three months now.
1601.44s: So yeah, there you go, fam.
1605.56s: Now back to the next one.
1608.12s: Any questions on this one?
1610.36s: Anybody else, anybody else takes away that you think we should cover anything like that?
1615.40s: Because again, like there's so much we can learn.
1620.76s: Evergreen says guaranteed, I'm not even going to read this.
1623.88s: Actually, I'll do everybody a favor and then let's just, we're going to, we're going
1629.64s: to have to do the children's game.
1631.52s: Everybody.
1632.52s: So evergreen's, I'm going to put you in time out for five minutes and we're going to
1636.24s: see if you can come back and play with the rest of the kids nicely.
1640.08s: So let's, there you go, off you go, five minutes.
1645.56s: If you can come back and behave normally, we would love to have you.
1649.92s: But right now that's not what's happening.
1652.92s: All right.
1655.92s: Dr. Zay says all he deleted is comment.
1657.64s: No, it's not him.
1658.68s: So the, just to be clear, it doesn't, whenever you put somebody in time out, it looks
1662.96s: like it deletes.
1664.36s: I don't know, it doesn't delete all of it.
1666.36s: It looks like, I don't know how much of their comments it deletes.
1669.16s: Looks like all damn, that's actually kind of harsh.
1672.40s: No shit.
1673.40s: Huh.
1674.40s: I actually didn't know it did that for, for you guys.
1680.40s: Can you see next to their name?
1682.08s: Because for me, it says message deleted by outlier options trading and then it says view
1686.88s: deleted message.
1688.08s: So I can still click it and view the message.
1691.12s: Huh.
1692.84s: Huh.
1694.84s: Learn a new shit every day.
1696.08s: As I continue to remind everybody on these streams is I don't belong on any of these things.
1700.16s: I don't know what I'm doing.
1701.48s: I just like trading.
1702.96s: That's pretty much where I'm at in my life.
1707.24s: Roaring Titty says, did you put him in time out or did you ban him or him?
1709.92s: No, I try to avoid that.
1711.56s: I, yeah, I try to avoid that.
1714.20s: So they're just in time out.
1715.28s: I like to give people a couple of chances because I feel like a lot of people just aren't
1719.60s: used to dealing with people that will set thresholds and then hold the threshold.
1724.20s: It's not really that complex, but it's just very militaristic.
1727.24s: It's kind of like if you do X, this is what happens.
1730.28s: If you don't do X, then you're good.
1732.88s: So I try to give people a chance at that because I think they're used to like the civilian
1736.08s: world where like you could show up five minutes late and it's okay.
1740.16s: Nobody cares.
1741.16s: Like that's not how it works in the military.
1742.52s: It's like there's a fucking time you're supposed to be there.
1744.36s: Be there before that time, ideally, at least at the very latest and fucking time.
1749.40s: And then you're good.
1750.88s: So that Lauren says he's gone now and my comment makes no sense.
1755.28s: That's awesome.
1756.28s: That's even better.
1757.28s: I love that.
1758.28s: Willie says sometimes people have a bad day too.
1760.08s: Yeah, that's exactly it.
1761.08s: And that's exactly why I try to give people a chance, right?
1763.52s: We've had a couple people pop in the streams, especially the beginner stream for some reason.
1767.48s: That try to come off sideways.
1768.96s: And I do everything I can to let him hang out because some people are just at a shitty spot
1772.72s: in their life genuinely.
1773.72s: And I don't mean that like to cast down on them, but they're trying to find something to
1777.60s: do that makes them feel better.
1779.56s: So I try to let them hang out as best as I possibly can.
1782.24s: I really, really do.
1783.72s: But I wouldn't let people, you know, be disruptive or disrespectful to other people.
1788.72s: There was actually somebody that we blocked because they were trying to talk shit about
1791.52s: roaring titty, which we're just we're literally not going to have.
1794.48s: That's just not going to happen.
1796.28s: So yeah.
1797.68s: All right, so that's this.
1800.80s: Let's kill this one, move on to the next.
1803.24s: And this is a great question.
1805.68s: So does theta decay on Friday factor in the weekend already?
1811.12s: It's a fantastic question.
1812.60s: And I actually think most of you know the answer to this one.
1816.12s: So take a look.
1817.12s: This part, this is a great question for a beginner trader.
1819.40s: They're saying do they lose $18 on Monday like theta decay and Friday is higher because
1824.52s: accounts Saturday and Sunday.
1826.00s: Do I lose $18 for Saturday and Sunday?
1828.04s: So $36.
1829.80s: So I don't know honestly what I'm looking at.
1832.84s: I don't see where their theta is on this.
1835.44s: It doesn't show me their theta.
1836.72s: I'm assuming it's $18 per day.
1840.72s: 18 cents a day.
1842.04s: That's kind of heavy.
1843.04s: Let's double check that really quick.
1844.68s: So this is a sts 23 calls.
1847.64s: Let's take a quick look.
1848.64s: A sts and let's pop over here.
1852.72s: They're out in 13 set super short term expiration.
1857.48s: And they have the 23 call.
1860.56s: Yeah, damn boy.
1863.16s: They had his 19 cents.
1864.28s: They ain't fucking about.
1866.08s: They're exactly right.
1867.68s: So you guys tell me what's the answer to this question.
1871.88s: Now let's be let's be let's keep it a buck.
1875.00s: The first answer to this question is where the fuck is their battery power?
1880.36s: The idea of posting a screenshot with literally 2% battery power is crazy to me.
1886.92s: So I think we have to start with that and make sure that middle month 20 97 is doing
1892.24s: okay, because for to be in that kind of mental state to have 2% battery power at 12 56
1898.24s: bm is fucking crazy.
1900.88s: We need to get that I literally just bought a new watch.
1903.92s: It's a dive watch, but my watch came with a power bank.
1908.40s: So maybe we need I don't need the power bank.
1910.24s: I think middle month needs the fucking power bank because this is nuts 12 56 no battery
1915.76s: power.
1916.76s: There's no outlet near you.
1918.28s: This is crazy.
1920.60s: All right.
1921.96s: Harlow says don't they already factor in the weekend?
1926.92s: Roryntitty says no, they don't factor it in.
1928.96s: Oh good.
1929.96s: So this one needs a poll hold on.
1931.56s: We need a poll here since there's a bifurcation.
1933.92s: All right, let's see.
1936.16s: Theta decay impact.
1937.96s: Hold on does theta?
1941.96s: No.
1942.96s: Does.
1944.96s: X, transic.
1946.96s: Value decay.
1949.96s: Theta.
1951.96s: Over the weekend.
1954.96s: Yes or no?
1956.96s: All right, there's a poll there for your viewing pleasure.
1960.96s: I'm actually really curious because the comments obviously show a bit of a split.
1968.24s: So far one hundred you say yes.
1970.80s: Ah, there is the no.
1973.56s: I see all right, we'll leave that open for just a couple seconds.
1977.36s: That's a great question.
1978.36s: I actually really, really like that.
1996.56s: All right, we got 17 votes.
1997.96s: That's pretty good.
2000.36s: 18, leave it open for another couple more seconds.
2005.96s: Go and once.
2008.72s: Go in twice.
2009.72s: All is ended.
2014.04s: We had 72% say yes.
2016.84s: And we had 27% say no.
2021.36s: The yays have it.
2023.92s: Theta does decay over the weekend.
2027.12s: What a lot of people don't know is that theta decay over any time frame is not linear.
2035.12s: So to their question of does theta decay on Friday, factor in the weekend already, it's
2041.32s: actually a great question.
2042.32s: And the answer is partially.
2044.84s: So what will happen to them is as Saturday and Sunday pass, they won't lose $18 per
2052.84s: day because a lot of this is actually factored into the clothes on Friday.
2060.20s: And then there will be an adjustment on Monday.
2062.64s: So the thing to know from this specific question that a lot of people don't know is that theta
2068.88s: is not linear.
2071.16s: It's not one day passes.
2073.00s: You lose this exact amount of money.
2075.44s: And it's not based on 30 seconds.
2077.36s: You lose this portion of that amount of money.
2080.12s: It's not linear.
2082.64s: So market makers will essentially, Ryan says partially wasn't a poll option.
2089.00s: Well, because the poll option is specific, right?
2092.40s: Does extrinsic value decay over the weekend?
2094.60s: It certainly does.
2096.72s: Extrinsic value does decay over the weekend.
2098.92s: What I'm highlighting though is that it just doesn't decay linearly.
2103.08s: So a lot of the theta decay will be factored into the clothes on Friday with the residual
2107.84s: that comes out Monday.
2109.52s: It's just not as discreet as theta in and of itself shows us.
2115.16s: Theta is showing us stuff in a vacuum, right?
2117.48s: So another great example here is, or do I lose $18 for Saturday and Sunday?
2123.84s: So obviously here, they're looking at $18.
2127.88s: If I look at their option, which we just shared together, theta is already at $19.
2134.04s: So theta moves.
2136.72s: Doctors, they said so it decays harder on Fridays and decays over the weekend, but not as hard.
2140.72s: Yep, that's exactly the way to think about it.
2143.44s: And it's not only on Fridays.
2145.72s: So the way that this will work is over the Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, the weekend decay
2153.24s: is already being amortized into the options, not just on Friday.
2158.04s: It starts earlier.
2159.48s: Because if they don't do that, people like me will know like, oh shit, on Friday, they're
2164.04s: going to decay out most of the weekend's theta before the weekend.
2167.92s: I'm going to trade that.
2169.08s: And then I have a great trade because I fade fall on Friday.
2173.08s: I gammahed throughout the day.
2174.60s: So I've no delta exposure knowing that essentially extrinsic value is coming out.
2179.56s: And then at the end of the day, I cover my position.
2181.40s: Don't make a ton of money on any one of those, but you can scale that easily.
2184.96s: So that's why they start earlier.
2187.04s: Because then I'm forced to expose myself to way more market factors as a trader.
2191.36s: So it's not as linear as that.
2194.56s: Roryntitty says they're going to lose more than $18.
2196.96s: They may or may not.
2198.80s: We can't tell yet.
2200.64s: So again, the fact is, is that it just won't be a linear $18 per day as they're guessing.
2207.96s: And again, this is a great question.
2209.60s: So the takeaway from this one is that leading into a weekend, typically starting as early
2215.28s: as Tuesday, but typically Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, market makers are going to start valuing
2220.76s: the options in taking out an additional portion of theta to account for the weekend because
2225.88s: a lot of these products don't trade over the weekend.
2228.28s: So it accounts for that dead time.
2230.24s: Now the trick here is that it still can move over the weekend.
2234.44s: That's why it's not fully removed for the weekend because some news can come out about
2239.68s: this individual stock that moves it on the weekend.
2242.60s: And then as soon as the market opens on Monday, it flies.
2245.88s: So this is a really great question.
2247.48s: It's a bit of a technical question, which is why I think it's important for trade
2250.72s: creators to know theta is not linear.
2253.80s: Not only is it not linear in its overall decay profile, but the way that it's applied over
2258.96s: the weekends in a smaller profile is important.
2261.80s: So I'll show you this.
2264.60s: So this shows you theta decay over different time frames.
2268.56s: Right?
2269.56s: So you can see is you get close.
2270.56s: This is you, oh, shit, I moved it.
2272.64s: This is using at the money options.
2274.12s: I also realized that I have my old logo and all of these.
2277.24s: That's super frustrating.
2278.92s: Don't love that for me.
2280.64s: And I also realized that this isn't lined up with the other one.
2283.68s: That's also annoying.
2284.68s: Okay, that's better.
2285.68s: All right.
2286.68s: So now this is better.
2287.68s: Anyways, you can see theta decay in and of itself day over day is not linear.
2291.56s: And then week over week, specifically using the weekends, it's not linear.
2295.48s: Now an even more important point here is for my options traders, specifically my vol traders.
2302.64s: I'll show you a study because the weekend carry trade in SPX is something that I almost
2310.56s: always have on to some degree.
2313.96s: And you can hedge it with futures, which is fantastic.
2317.48s: So let me see if I can find this study for you really quick.
2321.88s: Again, because you should not take Eric's word for it.
2325.80s: You should be able.
2329.84s: This one would work overnight drift.
2332.04s: I want to see if I can find this specific weekend effect.
2336.60s: Let me see.
2337.60s: Sorry.
2338.60s: This.
2339.60s: I'll find this for you.
2340.60s: So just give me a second.
2344.36s: I try to provide as many source documents as I possibly can because nobody does that and
2349.60s: it's super annoying.
2352.24s: But we're looking for something called the weekend effect.
2359.44s: Monday effect.
2360.76s: That's not it.
2362.40s: This is just looking at anomalies and the non trading hours.
2365.96s: I guess we can look at both of these really fast.
2369.40s: And I'll throw links to both of these in the chat for this one.
2374.48s: And then this one.
2376.68s: And we're going to look at both of them together.
2380.12s: Okay.
2381.96s: Let's see.
2382.96s: Doctors A is says, wait, how does news affect theta?
2384.72s: News doesn't affect theta.
2387.36s: News can affect extrinsic value technically.
2391.12s: But again, remember, the way that we use theta is perverse.
2396.12s: We use it colloquially different than what it actually is.
2399.44s: And again, when we're doing like these beginner sessions, I like to be very, very clear about
2404.88s: these concepts just so that you understand.
2407.28s: And then if we want to get lazy and use theta to represent time, that's okay, right?
2413.40s: That's what most of us mean.
2414.40s: But theta actually is time decay.
2418.48s: That's what theta, it's a measure of time decay.
2421.64s: Theta is a term is not time.
2423.84s: We just use it for time colloquially.
2426.56s: But theta in a technical sense is a measure of time decay.
2432.20s: So the reason why news and stuff like that can indirectly impact theta is because it can
2439.60s: impact the extrinsic value of an option by moving the underlying.
2445.64s: But to the point of the question, theta in and of itself is not directly impacted by
2451.88s: news.
2453.04s: It's simply impacted as a result of the underlying moving and then intrinsic and extrinsic values
2458.58s: sliding accordingly, yielding a different theta based on that.
2463.36s: Let me know if that answers the question.
2467.88s: Lauren says, I find that delta and theta really confusing makes me want to eat paste.
2471.64s: I have a video for you then hopefully Greeks.
2476.92s: I have a video that dives literally into all of the Greeks.
2479.96s: It's like not super long.
2481.36s: It's like 16 minutes.
2484.44s: So this is for that Lauren, that video I just dropped and that video is literally all
2490.92s: about the Greeks.
2491.92s: I go through first or degree, second or degree, third or degree spend most of the time for
2496.72s: first order Greeks because that's what impacts most people.
2500.40s: And for those that don't know, the first order Greeks actually includes a second order
2504.76s: Greek.
2505.76s: We just often refer to it as a first order Greek.
2507.36s: It's just kind of like a nerd fact that I don't really get a chance.
2510.48s: Like if I tell my wife something like that, she couldn't possibly care less.
2514.16s: So I have I'd share it with you guys.
2516.40s: So fun fact.
2520.60s: I'm essentially an encyclopedia of completely and utterly useless information.
2526.20s: It's not necessarily something I'm super proud of, but it is what it is.
2530.92s: All right.
2531.92s: So we're through our first spin drift.
2534.64s: We're moving over to our reserve watermelon, seltzer water.
2541.32s: And we are ready to move on here.
2545.76s: So here we go.
2549.20s: So this is looking at non-trading periods, right?
2552.64s: That's what this study looks at.
2554.68s: And it says, we document the striking results that US equity premium over the last decade
2559.16s: is solely due to overnight returns.
2561.88s: The return during the night are strongly positive and returns during the day or close
2565.48s: to zero and sometimes negative.
2567.24s: This day and night effect holds for individual stocks, equity indices and futures contracts
2571.36s: on equity indices.
2573.20s: Night returns are consistently higher than day turns across the week, month and times
2577.06s: of year.
2578.06s: So this essentially is highlighting a really important function of markets that a lot
2582.80s: of people don't know exists, which actually really surprises me to be honest, because
2587.88s: it's nothing that's like revolutionary or complex, at least in my opinion, but you'll
2592.58s: see this essentially everywhere.
2594.60s: So I ran a study actually for the pro members, the Patreon members for the Outlier community.
2601.84s: And I was essentially walking them through movements and SPX and how it breaks out throughout
2607.00s: the day.
2608.36s: So what I do is I like to look at products like this that I trade variance risk premiums
2612.12s: in.
2613.12s: I get how it moves for each 15 minute interval throughout throughout the entire day.
2619.92s: So that I can see where the bulk of movement occurs.
2623.12s: And in something like SPX, you'll notice if we look over any sort of significant time
2629.32s: frame, a lot of the movements that you'll find happen within the first and last 15 minutes.
2635.56s: Of course, this isn't always right.
2636.96s: So this is a big move that's like an hour into the market.
2640.00s: So it's not always 15 minutes.
2641.96s: But very frequently, the first 15 minutes and last 15 minutes of the market will be very
2647.60s: busy.
2648.92s: That's where we see overnight orders flooding in that we're resting.
2653.56s: And then that's where we see everybody positioning for the next day.
2657.44s: So you'll see a lot of active style traders like myself will favor the last hour of the
2662.96s: day heavily and the beginning part of the day to be clear for like opening range breakouts
2666.56s: and stuff like that.
2668.52s: The big movement from overnight tends to come from pension funds and like these really
2673.56s: big institutions that are just resting orders overnight to get hit on the next open.
2679.68s: So you'll you'll find this trend holds over time with the vast majority of products.
2684.88s: So that's essentially part of what this is identifying for you.
2689.24s: Let me see Zacharias says, is it distracting to ask about holidays?
2692.80s: Same right?
2693.80s: No, it's not distracting at all.
2694.80s: Dude, this is a completely open conversation.
2697.20s: We talk about straight up whatever you guys want to dive into.
2701.92s: Zacharias says holiday is same, right?
2705.44s: Yeah, exactly.
2706.44s: So if we have an extended duration, technically speaking, there's even greater opportunity
2710.88s: to capture various risk premiums from there because the market has to account for that
2715.56s: additional time off.
2716.88s: And again, non trading periods tend to be really efficacious for stuff like that.
2721.08s: The risk you run is if there's really terrible news that comes out, a war breaks out or
2724.52s: whatever, and you get this massive gap on the open.
2727.52s: But again, like for the way that I trade, I'll use SPX and then I can always hedge with
2732.44s: the futures if something really terrible happens.
2738.64s: Effectively creating a spread.
2740.68s: So Zacharias, a fantastic question.
2743.24s: Nothing wrong with that question at all.
2744.92s: And it's completely the same.
2746.04s: It changes the way that they essentially have to amortize theta.
2750.20s: Great question.
2752.20s: All right, let's take a look at this one.
2754.84s: Devidence shows that the size and effect, the weak and effect dividend.
2759.92s: So let's open this one really quick.
2767.00s: And then let's search for and actually give me one second because I have to have this
2772.60s: paper downloaded and the fact that I couldn't find it makes me very angry.
2779.00s: So I have to see if I can find this really fast.
2781.08s: Let's name it this anomalies.
2783.08s: Aha.
2784.08s: See, I have every study.
2788.56s: Okay, that's a lie.
2789.56s: It's kind of dramatic.
2790.56s: But I have most studies downloaded and in my kindle again for those that are in the discord.
2798.40s: You'll see me post both in like the Patreon side and like the reading list.
2801.76s: We have like a reading club.
2802.76s: We'll just share the shit that we're reading.
2804.48s: But then I'll also drop stuff like this in the beginner section of the discord.
2809.08s: Is embarrassing as it is.
2811.08s: This is what I read, man.
2812.68s: Like this is this stuff that I don't know why I don't know what the fuck is wrong with
2816.16s: me, but I love this shit.
2818.32s: So anyways, this one's a little bit old.
2820.16s: I think this one's from like early 2000, but I think it still holds.
2823.32s: Let's take a look for the weekend.
2826.20s: It's the weekend.
2827.20s: Yeah, 2002.
2829.24s: The fact that I know that is also not great.
2831.64s: Okay.
2832.64s: So French 1980 observed another calendar anomaly.
2835.20s: We noted that the average return to the S&P composite portfolio is reliably negative
2838.72s: over the weekends in the period of 53 to 77.
2842.64s: The dependent variable is daily return to abroad portfolio stocks, short, portfolio based
2847.00s: on Dow Jones.
2848.00s: So they're talking about essentially the drift over the weekends.
2851.72s: And you can see the way that they estimate it.
2861.68s: I don't know if they talk about volatility in here.
2863.72s: They might not.
2864.72s: I don't think they talk about volatility in here.
2867.16s: My bad.
2869.84s: That Lauren says I'm glad someone reads it for when we have questions.
2872.16s: Yeah.
2873.16s: And I get it.
2874.16s: Like that's why I try to summarize a lot of these studies for you.
2875.96s: I'll always provide the studies like this and give you a link to them and stuff.
2880.20s: But I also understand not everybody was dropped on their head.
2882.84s: It is a child and wants to read this shit.
2886.44s: I do.
2888.00s: And I do read it.
2890.32s: Vladimir says many individual stocks react to news and the SEC filings and almost all
2894.48s: of this is as close and extended hours when I'm just trading is not possible.
2897.28s: Yep, that's correct.
2898.28s: That's absolutely correct.
2900.00s: That's why that that's why that there's still extrinsic value assigned to non market
2905.64s: or to non trading periods.
2909.12s: My wife is texting me asking about dinner.
2911.44s: So we got to see what we're going to order.
2913.16s: I'm thinking, what do you guys think barbecue?
2920.00s: The barbecue man.
2921.08s: barbecue sounds good.
2923.60s: All right.
2924.08s: So that's these.
2925.00s: I think we can kill these.
2926.04s: You have those.
2928.00s: Let's take a look at this one.
2930.56s: So we killed this.
2932.08s: Here we go.
2935.00s: Option volatility and pricing for the average Joe.
2937.92s: I love options.
2938.80s: I really want to learn options.
2940.08s: And I've already got a few books on trading and essentials like options as a
2943.04s: strategic investment.
2944.04s: Shout out to you acceptable answer.
2945.68s: That's that's an acceptable answer.
2947.88s: But option volatility and pricing.
2949.20s: This one scares me as a simple man.
2951.20s: Followed three longshore men background as a carpenter.
2953.76s: Am I entering a world of paint?
2954.96s: No, you're not.
2956.44s: I had my strong maths in school, but that was 20 years ago.
2959.24s: Should I take on math lessons to be able to wield and master options?
2963.16s: So this.
2967.72s: This I think doctor Zayah says you get barbecue every time.
2971.84s: That's not true.
2972.64s: I just get barbecue a lot.
2975.80s: But not every time.
2976.92s: Don't don't do me like that.
2981.84s: Do Mexican a lot too lately.
2985.20s: Dust to dust.
2986.60s: What up?
2987.60s: Good to see you.
2988.20s: So what do we think here?
2990.64s: You guys tell me have you guys read option volatility and pricing?
2993.84s: And do you think it's required?
2995.68s: Like do you think that the book has materially changed the way that you view
2999.52s: markets?
3000.52s: And you give your answer and then I'll give mine.
3003.12s: But I think I have two versions.
3005.72s: Yeah, I have paper version down here.
3009.68s: Reese says I have not read it.
3011.12s: So I hope not.
3021.24s: So here's said book.
3024.92s: It is about 500 pages long.
3031.96s: Yeah, about 500.
3034.40s: And here's what I would say.
3038.16s: I think well, actually, I can tell you exactly what I would say.
3043.56s: Because I offer this to everybody.
3050.28s: But everybody that doesn't know if you go to my website,
3053.28s: if you go under resources, I literally have essentially a straight up guide
3060.80s: for new option straighters.
3062.60s: It's just a Google sheet that loads in here, but it's also you can click into any of
3066.32s: these.
3067.32s: Actually, that's another quick question for you.
3069.08s: As you look at this top box, would you think to click this or do you need this one here?
3074.80s: Addic curiosity from a user's perspective.
3082.12s: Vladimir says Chinese food is always great and keeps your body MSG levels.
3086.64s: I actually don't disagree.
3089.08s: Or Indian maybe.
3091.08s: I'm kind of down for whatever.
3094.08s: All right, dust the dust says top link.
3099.32s: That Lawrence says bottom.
3100.32s: Yeah, okay.
3101.32s: So my instincts are correct to have both.
3103.92s: Because I just I just expected people to naturally gravitate to either the titles in
3110.48s: clicking or these, which is why I include both, right?
3114.44s: You can't think they're both right.
3116.80s: So anyways, on this, if you go down to the bottom, you can take a look at options 101.
3121.96s: This is what I consider to be the basics for options understanding options as a strategic
3127.80s: investment option, volatility, and pricing, advanced trading strategies and techniques.
3134.76s: That's what this book is.
3136.08s: This is literally the second book I would recommend to any options trader.
3141.04s: So in my opinion, this is required text.
3144.56s: That's what I say.
3146.80s: Now, for this person, the problem, this is the problem with trading is people want an
3164.20s: easy, simple solution.
3167.28s: It's just not what you're going to find in markets.
3170.84s: It's just not what you're going to find.
3173.40s: It looks like Mel is down for barbecue or Indian.
3176.60s: So you guys have to pick for us.
3177.80s: Do we do barbecue or Indian?
3179.60s: She's down for either I'm down for either.
3184.60s: Johtato says I failed really reading comprehension like every time it was tested through school.
3188.80s: That's cool, man.
3189.80s: That's back in school.
3190.80s: That's old you.
3191.80s: You're now new you.
3193.92s: Everybody says Indian.
3194.92s: All right, Indian it is.
3195.92s: I'm down for some Indian.
3197.92s: Oh, damn, Willie, throwing the, I tell you what, Mexican sounds good too.
3204.16s: Damn it, Willie.
3209.80s: You're kind of doing me dirty here.
3214.64s: Let's see.
3216.64s: Damn it.
3218.64s: Oh, I actually think I'm going to do Italian.
3223.40s: I'm going to throw a complete curveball at Mel.
3226.32s: She's going to be like, what the fuck are you sending me?
3229.56s: But I had Italian ready to go before.
3232.04s: So it looks like that's what I need in my life.
3234.84s: I've got to follow the body.
3239.40s: So in my opinion, I think this is required reading.
3246.68s: The reason why I think it's required reading is because it goes deep into detail on how
3252.64s: markets behave, how market makers behave.
3256.24s: Damn it.
3257.24s: She doesn't want to tell you.
3261.96s: So it looks like we got to do Indian.
3265.56s: I had a feeling going for that curve ball was not going to, was not going to float well.
3270.08s: Maybe maybe I'll see if she's cool with Mexican.
3272.88s: This is actually hilarious.
3277.28s: All right, we're doing Indian.
3287.36s: She doesn't want Mexican either.
3290.56s: I feel like Indian is a good choice.
3293.20s: I have no regrets with some solid Indian.
3301.76s: Dustin does says Eric, that's the second book.
3303.92s: You 100% recommend what's the first options as a strategic investment that I think is
3309.24s: probably the easiest book for most people to pick up and start learning about options.
3315.16s: It's not quite as technical as what you will find from option pricing and volatility,
3324.36s: but it is a little, I don't want to say it's a little heavy.
3329.08s: There's parts in it that can be tricky, but in general, I think it's, it's pretty reasonable.
3335.28s: Damn.
3336.28s: So now I don't know if I want chicken be a reenie beer Ronnie.
3343.40s: Or if I want like butter chicken, shit.
3349.40s: Doctors, they don't you dare hit me with that joke.
3352.32s: I love that joke.
3354.64s: That's probably one of my favorite jokes on earth.
3361.12s: I won't steal it from you though, because somebody else might ask you what and it's very
3366.72s: fun to be able to answer that.
3368.68s: So I won't, I won't steal it from you.
3371.44s: I don't have that in my heart.
3373.56s: Such a good joke, especially if you can get somebody new with it.
3376.36s: God, that's great.
3378.04s: All right.
3380.32s: So I'm doing butter chicken and garlic non that will be the, that will be the movement.
3386.76s: All right.
3387.76s: Back.
3388.76s: Back over to this.
3391.76s: Damn, she's quick out here.
3396.16s: Vladimir off Putin says, as a new options trader, I have a separate account funded by a lucky
3400.44s: trade I have named entertainment.
3402.36s: I just don't have confidence or knowledge to risk my money just yet.
3405.56s: I think that's okay.
3406.56s: I think of Vladimir off Putin for you in that.
3409.36s: I would think about paper trading.
3411.52s: Like literally I have a video coming out in not too long.
3417.56s: I think not this week, but next week.
3421.96s: This is a video that's coming out tomorrow.
3424.36s: I actually have to download this.
3429.16s: But yeah, I have a video that's coming out that explicitly is going to be about this
3435.00s: exact thing.
3436.96s: And paper trading because I genuinely believe paper trading is such, such an incredible, such
3444.96s: an incredible tool for that exact thing that you're talking about.
3448.08s: Vladimir off Putin.
3450.20s: But I think that you have to, you have to think about what you're trying to accomplish.
3455.28s: And then essentially treat your trading account like that.
3461.44s: That's what I think.
3464.12s: Rolling Titty says what's the answer to the joke?
3466.20s: It's above.
3467.20s: Rolling Titty, that's like literally one of the best jokes I think somebody could have.
3473.12s: Yeah, I literally, my poor wife probably has heard that joke more times than anybody really
3481.76s: deserves to hear it.
3483.84s: But it is, it's just so good.
3486.88s: It's just so good that I can't, I don't know.
3491.68s: It's fantastic.
3493.68s: So for those that didn't get a chance to enjoy it, make sure you read the punch line.
3497.92s: So back to this.
3498.92s: Yes, I think it's required.
3500.56s: No options trading is not easy.
3503.16s: No, it's absolutely not for everybody.
3506.48s: That's kind of, that's just kind of how it goes.
3509.84s: So when I think about what I think works best with learning to trade options, it's a mix
3522.96s: of fundamental understanding of theoretical concepts.
3527.16s: And then it's starting as fast as you can on the more complex components.
3535.00s: So things like how to take the theoretical components and then use them live.
3544.48s: That's really not easy.
3546.72s: And I think a lot of people struggle pretty hard with that exact process.
3550.72s: But to me, that's kind of really where that entire process comes together because you
3556.44s: can be super, super, super, theoretically sound, like completely theoretically sound.
3562.64s: And then you cannot understand at all how to actually trade.
3568.72s: So to me, you kind of have to have a really strict balance of both.
3572.48s: That's my overall thought.
3574.12s: Vladimir Alpoutin says, I've tried paper money, but feel that I'm reckless there.
3579.68s: To me, that highlights a massive discipline issue that is showing you upfront a problem
3588.16s: that is there.
3590.04s: There's a massive problem with that.
3592.32s: If you are that kind of person and you're not alone, lots and lots of people are like
3596.44s: that.
3597.44s: But if you are that kind of person, that's like, man, I just can't take this seriously
3601.20s: because of, you know, X, Y, Z reason, that is absolutely going to come out to bite you
3607.28s: in the end no matter what.
3608.48s: Like that, that problem is going to show up in another way if you don't take care of that
3613.88s: problem.
3614.88s: So paper trading again is giving you a fantastic preemptive heads up that you have a problem
3621.44s: of some sort.
3622.44s: And again, I'm not saying that you have to, you know, fully treat paper trading as if
3627.36s: this is, you know, your livelihood and stuff like that.
3631.04s: But if you can't take paper trading seriously, then the probability of you like being able
3637.56s: to take trading as seriously as you likely need to is actually pretty low in my opinion.
3645.48s: So that's at least the way I look at it personally.
3649.56s: I hope it's not the case, right?
3650.96s: Like I'm not, I'm not saying that to like wish it on anybody, but I think that that is
3656.80s: my general instinct towards that kind of thing in the beginning because you'll find people
3662.24s: will say that all the time.
3664.24s: And I literally can tell for those kinds of people, the problems that they're going to
3669.40s: have based on that kind of behavior.
3676.24s: Zachary says we'll recognize and the problem is better than most.
3678.68s: I agree.
3679.68s: I completely agree.
3680.68s: So let's talk about that.
3681.68s: Let's talk about that exact thing.
3682.68s: Again, I have a video that's coming out next weekend on paper trading.
3691.64s: So you guys talk to me.
3693.84s: What are some of the ways then if at least I think paper trading is important?
3697.44s: It doesn't mean that it, you know, is super important.
3700.72s: But if I think it's important, what are some of the reasons why you might think that I
3704.36s: think it's important specifically in terms of how can you adopt it if you identify with
3709.96s: yourself as I have a discipline problem?
3713.48s: I'm not doing a good job treating this as real money.
3717.48s: How can we fix that?
3721.96s: Any ideas?
3727.80s: That Lauren says I started with paper trades and small stocks so it didn't hurt so badly.
3731.92s: I did well with so if I, yeah, that's really solid.
3734.32s: Right?
3735.32s: That's starting small.
3736.32s: I think that that's fantastic.
3737.48s: That's a really, really great approach, I think.
3741.32s: All right.
3744.32s: It looks like no ideas are necessarily jumping out so we can hit this together.
3750.20s: Roryntitty says I reduced the size of the cash.
3752.24s: That's okay.
3754.76s: Change the money to percentages.
3756.28s: That's kind of for sizing, which those are good ideas for sizing.
3760.24s: So here's what I would tell you.
3762.60s: If you're the kind of person that's coming into paper, like I give this example all the
3766.64s: time, I'll tell you right now, I'll look at my log right now.
3773.76s: I have to go to my data tab.
3776.44s: Okay.
3778.56s: How many paper trades do you think I have on right now?
3781.92s: I am a full-time trader.
3784.28s: I've been trading for almost 17 years now.
3791.28s: How many paper trades do I have on right now?
3795.60s: Vladimir says I've made hundreds of thousands on individual stock trades, but the clock
3798.88s: ticking with options is a big difference.
3802.68s: It is, but it's not.
3804.08s: Again, like if you're making that kind of money with trades, then you probably have a profit
3811.48s: mechanism that works.
3812.48s: And again, like we were talking about before, if you have a profit mechanism that works,
3816.76s: options are just going to amplify it.
3818.36s: They're not going to hurt it.
3820.20s: They'll hurt it if you don't know how to use option.
3827.52s: But they're not inherently going to hurt it.
3831.28s: Okay, so Elon Song says 10.
3834.40s: Doctors A S says more than 10.
3835.88s: That's a great guess.
3836.88s: Willie says 20.
3837.88s: Reece says 100.
3838.88s: I'm taking the over.
3841.04s: And Reece would be the winner.
3842.80s: Right now I have 1887.
3847.36s: 1887 paper trades on.
3850.36s: I have them split into three different segments.
3855.28s: There's what I call a portfolio mirroring segment.
3860.36s: That looks at my portfolio as it is with slightly different permutations.
3868.16s: So rather than right now essentially shorting things like energy, I'll short something else
3875.88s: that I also think is weak and I'll run them simultaneously in compare notes.
3882.20s: Roaring Titty says like currently are over the life of your trading career.
3884.72s: Literally right now.
3885.88s: That's what's on this second.
3889.48s: So Reece says do I get an internet trophy?
3893.44s: Yeah, I actually think that that's fair.
3895.16s: I will.
3898.48s: I will award Reece.
3904.80s: It's plus one fake internet point.
3906.40s: I got to find my little trophy.
3907.48s: There it is.
3908.48s: Good call, Reece.
3911.48s: Reece gets plus one fake internet point.
3915.16s: So I have that first segment that's mirroring slight variations to my portfolio.
3921.48s: I have a second segment that looks at a completely different portfolio structure.
3926.88s: So I'm essentially testing an alternate portfolio that has a completely different disposition
3931.92s: of what I have.
3933.08s: I use things like the core allocation and the speculative trades in that portfolio
3938.28s: to essentially show me other elements that might be contrary to what I think.
3943.28s: So for example, right now I'm still long deltas and I have a lot of short deltas over
3949.32s: laid.
3950.48s: However, when I look at the portfolio itself net net, there's still some long deltas.
3956.96s: So in my second kind of segment, I'm looking at an alternate portfolio that's primarily
3962.64s: short deltas right now and has a little bit of long deltas, kind of the inverse of what
3967.32s: I'm doing.
3968.48s: And then the third one is variations of literally all of the strategies that I run regularly.
3976.08s: That's it.
3977.60s: So by doing this, I'm able to test live information because as you all know, I like to look at data.
3987.56s: I'll back test, I'll forward test.
3990.08s: But even in the process of back testing, I know and can recognize that even subconsciously,
3996.04s: there is back end processing that's happening that's tainting the results of what I'm doing
4001.24s: that I don't want to happen.
4003.28s: So one of the ways that I combat that is by having all of these different paper trades
4007.60s: on at a given point in time to allow me to collect raw data based on what I don't know
4011.80s: is going to happen.
4013.04s: I have no idea what's going to happen over the next week.
4015.28s: So that's why I do it.
4018.56s: So the way that I would encourage a newer trader to take paper trading seriously is I would
4027.20s: I would do something like this.
4030.64s: I would show them this.
4035.28s: And then I would say, let's say you're starting at $5,000, let's say that you're able to
4040.48s: save on average $1,500.
4043.40s: Let's say you're going to look over 20 years and let's say that we're starting with
4048.04s: the 10% return.
4049.76s: Well, what would I get if I have an 11% return?
4055.16s: Well, in that same time frame at an 11% return over this 20 year time frame, I go from
4063.96s: 1.06 million to 1.2 million.
4067.56s: So it's $200,000.
4069.04s: That doesn't sound like super life changing or crazy.
4073.72s: But then let's fast forward this out to 30 years.
4076.44s: Now what is this turn into?
4077.76s: 1% variance between this 10% and this 11% 1% variance takes me from 3 million to 3.7
4087.24s: million.
4089.24s: $700,000 over the same time frame for one fucking percent difference.
4094.24s: I care about that 1%.
4096.60s: I care about that 1%.
4098.44s: So this isn't like some magical big return.
4101.12s: This is literally the difference between 10 and 11%.
4106.32s: But that 1% over a long enough time frame is massively impactful.
4112.52s: Now this becomes even more important.
4115.04s: Let's say that you have a really good return.
4116.72s: Let's say that you return on average 22%.
4120.68s: Let's take a look at what 22 versus 23% is.
4124.24s: You go from 33.7 million, 33.8 million to 41 million dollars.
4133.88s: That's from 22% to 23%.
4137.28s: I care about the one fucking percent.
4141.84s: In this example over a 30 year time frame, it's almost 10 million dollars.
4150.28s: I care about that.
4151.80s: I absolutely care about that.
4154.76s: So for me, paper trading is a way to accomplish two things.
4160.44s: There are two primary purposes of paper trading.
4163.76s: The first one is for new traders to avoid this.
4171.16s: If you're a new trader and let's say that you have a 40% drawdown on your account, after
4180.08s: that 40% drawdown, you now require a 66.7% recovery in order to get back to break even.
4196.48s: You need a massive, massive recovery in order to get back to break even.
4202.48s: So when you're a new trader in my opinion, the game is not trying to turn a small account
4211.56s: into a big account.
4213.40s: As annoying as that sounds, it's simply so unlikely to be the case that we're going to
4220.12s: take a really small amount of money and turn it into a massive sum of money.
4226.88s: Not impossible, but it's insanely improbable.
4231.40s: So in the beginning, the point of trading is to not lose a bunch of money and then start
4238.84s: having to run uphill.
4241.40s: That's the point.
4242.56s: It's to learn the skill set without burning a shit ton of money learning it.
4249.12s: Paper trading helps you with that exact thing.
4253.36s: So for the beginner paper traders, I would literally frame it as I am building the exact
4261.64s: skill set that I'm going to use and rely on for myself to hit my financial goals.
4272.96s: That's the point of paper trading.
4275.60s: So if you look at paper trading and you can't take it seriously, you literally can't take
4279.36s: your fucking future seriously.
4281.56s: You don't care that much.
4283.24s: That's all there is to it.
4284.84s: Now I'm not saying everybody has to paper trade ad nauseam.
4287.68s: I'm just saying that if you find yourself in the bucket that you just can't take it
4291.12s: seriously at all, that tells me that there's a psychology problem factored into this thing.
4297.20s: So that's what I would tell to the new paper trader.
4300.40s: Now for the non-new paper trader, experienced traders like myself, I use it for data.
4307.60s: I use it for data collection.
4309.68s: So for me, the new paper trader, the entire goal for a brand new paper trader is essentially
4317.08s: to trade that paper trading account as close as humanly possible to how you think you're
4324.36s: going to trade your real money.
4326.60s: That's the goal.
4327.92s: And then for experienced traders, your goal is to see how can you learn and enhance your
4334.68s: strategies to get that 1% that I just showed you is so important.
4341.88s: That's the goal for experienced traders.
4345.68s: So that's what I think.
4348.64s: If you are a paper trader and you're struggling to take it seriously, I would just take a
4354.04s: little time, zoom out and think about what you're trying to accomplish and what paper
4358.80s: trading allows you to do.
4361.04s: Because I genuinely believe if you get to the point where you can take that more seriously,
4366.28s: I mean, damn, it's so powerful of a tool that just for whatever reason, so many people
4372.68s: have a hard time latching onto.
4376.20s: And I sort of get it.
4377.76s: It's boring if you don't think about it in that context.
4381.80s: But it's like the same thing.
4382.80s: I tell people about like military training.
4386.16s: If the only way that I was able to train in the military is by essentially going only
4394.24s: to combat and that's the only time I can learn, there's going to be a lot of dead motherfuckers
4399.28s: if that's the only way I can learn.
4401.84s: So that's my thought, a little bit of a long soliloquy about things.
4406.68s: But the reason why I think it's important to like really dive into that is because I
4411.80s: think taking it seriously literally can be life changing.
4416.72s: And I think a lot of people sell themselves short, not doing so.
4420.60s: That's what I genuinely think.
4422.88s: So that's that.
4424.52s: Now there's a couple other things that I said I wanted to look at with us.
4428.72s: So I vote we now pivot onto some of those.
4433.84s: Any questions though about the paper trading thing?
4436.08s: I'm hopeful that that even like generally makes sense to us.
4439.96s: Because that's why again, like that's why I bring it up is because I think that it's
4443.80s: at least a usable, a usable data point in two different ways.
4449.40s: Whether you're a new trader trying not to lose money but learn the skill set or if
4453.48s: you're an experienced trader that's trying to make a lot of money.
4459.20s: Dust to dust says make it more interesting.
4461.04s: Put 10% of your paper trading profits into your cash account.
4464.08s: I love that.
4465.08s: I think that's a good idea.
4470.20s: Vladimir Putin says, are you more aggressive when playing cod than in real life?
4474.12s: Same to me when paper trading.
4476.84s: Yeah, but again, you can't compare those because if I'm training in real life for what
4484.80s: I do in real life, I take that deadly serious.
4489.08s: If I'm playing a video game where it's very purpose is for entertainment.
4493.20s: That's the only reason why we play Call of Duty or any of these other games is for entertainment.
4497.60s: Of course, I don't take it that seriously.
4499.32s: I know I'm going to respond, but that's not what this is.
4504.40s: I'm not talking about I don't get to respond my capital.
4508.20s: If I have a 40% drawdown, I need 66.7% positive return to get back to breaking.
4514.76s: Even there's no respond.
4516.68s: I don't get to just come back.
4518.80s: So when I look at something like this, I actually wouldn't equate it at all to a video game
4524.52s: that's entirely predicated on leisure.
4528.16s: I would actually equate it far more to real life training for whatever it is that you're
4534.68s: going to be doing, whether it's going to combat or whatever it is.
4538.20s: Just a more real life practical application, I think is the broader point.
4544.16s: That's my opinion.
4547.88s: Zacharias says, trade, trade, train hard, play easy.
4551.24s: Yeah, well, and that's actually another funny thing that I'll remind traders of all the
4554.52s: time is that the actual process of trading is about as easy as it gets for me.
4561.44s: And that's not hyperbole.
4562.76s: It's really not.
4564.40s: Trading in and of itself is easy for me.
4567.16s: And the reason why it's easy is because everything else that I do to lead up to whatever it is
4575.64s: that I'm trying to build the skill set up.
4578.20s: So in this case, trading, I do all of the work ahead of time, all of the work ahead of
4585.14s: time.
4588.16s: So then in this case, it's just another day of doing what I know I need to do inherently.
4595.72s: So all of the work for me in trading is done ahead of time and trading in and of itself
4601.92s: does not need to be a difficult process in my opinion.
4606.28s: But all of the work to make it not a difficult process has to be done before you start trading.
4614.08s: Paper trading helps a lot with that.
4617.68s: Reece says, is S&P inclusion a tradable event?
4620.20s: Yeah, definitely.
4621.20s: Sorry, I didn't realize that you had asked that before.
4623.16s: That's my bad.
4625.16s: So yeah, Reece.
4626.32s: So things moving within the S&P 500 is absolutely a tradable event.
4631.48s: They tend to exhibit drift over a set follow on period.
4636.08s: And you can actually look at the, there's a study on it.
4640.36s: Let me see if I can find it really quick.
4644.52s: That's from a market in efficiency book.
4647.20s: But I wonder if SSRN has something on it.
4651.56s: And then I need to press send on this order.
4658.56s: All right, then our order is up the door.
4670.68s: And then let me see if I can find this maybe easier to search studies.
4681.40s: So this isn't the study I was looking for.
4699.40s: But this is, let me see.
4706.40s: I think this is the one I was thinking of.
4708.40s: Yeah, this is the one.
4710.90s: So there's two studies that I believe you can reference.
4717.10s: The first study here is talking about, again, like the actual reference effect.
4725.82s: And then this study essentially is just summarizing it.
4738.82s: Let me know if that makes sense.
4747.34s: So this one, if we take a look together, you'll see a few things.
4755.14s: I think that kind of point out to me.
4757.22s: The main thing is that things being added to the S&P 500 typically see some sort of movement,
4764.46s: post being added.
4766.50s: So you can see increases in the share values.
4770.10s: But you'll see that the data itself is slightly mixed.
4774.14s: And that's why I think this study is a good one to read.
4778.90s: So we can go down, we can just read the conclusion together really quick.
4787.94s: The S&P 500 index has no permanent effect, right?
4792.02s: And I want to emphasize that specific line permanent effect, because guess what?
4797.50s: As traders, we don't care about permanence.
4801.46s: That's not what we're trying to trade.
4802.86s: I'm not trying to trade the permanent effect of something.
4806.58s: I'm simply trying to trade the effect.
4809.10s: So the fact that it's not permanent, I don't care literally at all about what I care
4813.62s: about is, is it something that's tradable, which it absolutely is in the short term?
4819.02s: So I think as long as you have a logical approach in terms of when you put the positions
4823.86s: on them for what duration, I think it makes a ton of sense.
4827.46s: Vladimir Putin says again, add it to S&P 500 after hours when options were not traded.
4831.66s: That doesn't matter.
4832.90s: It's not an overnight effect.
4835.18s: It's not something that's going to come and go today.
4838.10s: It's more of a momentum effect.
4839.58s: It takes time for it to be priced in.
4842.58s: So yeah, it doesn't matter that options weren't trading tonight or on the, on Poundseer.
4848.98s: It'll be completely fine.
4852.30s: It's something that you can trade over a duration.
4854.42s: Yeah, don't sweat that.
4858.42s: All right.
4862.30s: So let's close that out, close that out, close that out.
4866.02s: That was a good one.
4867.02s: Let's see if there's anything else that we want to grab from this real quick.
4870.54s: Let's go with this over.
4875.18s: And let's see.
4882.58s: Doctors A is so astraddle would make sense.
4885.34s: That kind of is more for, well, it depends.
4887.58s: For me, I would probably play more so the positive drift myself.
4891.98s: But if you, if for whatever reason, you felt that there was a higher probability of, you
4898.22s: know, just movement in either direction and you couldn't, you know, you don't have an
4901.94s: assessment on which direction.
4903.34s: And yeah, I think it's fine to use astraddle, but that's kind of the purpose of it.
4907.98s: But for me, that's not the way I look at it personally.
4910.94s: All right.
4912.42s: This one looks like a good one for us.
4914.14s: We read through that one.
4918.10s: Let's talk about this one because I think there's some problems here.
4924.38s: And then let's look at this person's blind spots.
4926.98s: All right.
4927.98s: So this one talks about earnings crush.
4930.10s: It says they've seen a lot of references to IV crush during earnings that lower in options
4934.98s: contract value.
4936.94s: But what really happens during earnings that leads to IV crush?
4940.82s: All right.
4943.22s: So you guys talk to me.
4946.10s: What do you guys think about this?
4949.14s: What really happens during earnings that leads to the IV crush?
4953.78s: What happens?
4960.10s: Binary event concludes, yeah, I got to be more specific than that though.
4967.66s: No plus fake one internet point for that.
4970.42s: I consider that a partial answer.
4978.30s: The news is out there.
4979.30s: Hype is over.
4980.30s: That's better.
4981.30s: Rowing Titty is moving us in the correct direction.
4984.02s: So res gave a more holistic answer, but I think roaring Titty beat them to it.
4991.14s: So roaring Titty.
4992.46s: There you go with plus fake one internet point.
4998.74s: Willie says IV crush is elevated extrinsic value of the surge in demand in options near
5004.46s: earnings.
5005.46s: And once past earnings, you get crushed.
5007.30s: That's not exactly correct actually.
5009.30s: This is good.
5010.30s: I'm glad we're talking about this.
5012.98s: G36 says the market is pricing in larger move from the earnings afterwards the expectation
5017.30s: is gone.
5018.30s: Yeah.
5019.30s: So G36 is also also correct.
5024.86s: So G36 you also get plus fake one internet point.
5028.70s: So I think your response expounded a little bit on the effect.
5032.82s: So here's what's going on.
5035.22s: Before earnings, let's find something that has earnings.
5041.90s: Let's do a PLD somebody threw that in the chat before.
5044.94s: So we'll take a look at that.
5046.42s: So a PLD had earnings leading into earnings.
5051.22s: We don't know what's going on.
5053.66s: We do know that there's going to be new information critical to the valuation of a stock.
5061.34s: We know that that is going to come out with certainty that's going to be here.
5067.46s: So that leads to a heightened expectation of implied movement.
5072.94s: We know information is coming out that can move the stock.
5076.22s: That then means we expect movement of some sort.
5081.82s: So leading into earnings, the expectation for implied movement is relatively high.
5086.58s: Because we're getting information that can move the stock.
5089.74s: Once that information is released, it is then priced into the stock.
5097.06s: That's why if you go through something like this, you'll see the orange line is implied
5106.50s: volatility.
5108.38s: Notice how the orange line is downward sloping, typically through earnings, not always,
5114.46s: but typically through earnings will be downward sloping.
5119.38s: So that simply means that the implied move based on the information is factored in.
5125.98s: And now we're not expecting as much movement.
5129.18s: Now the second question that they had that was a great follow up question is, is it a
5134.94s: guarantee for stock options to have a crush on earnings?
5140.02s: What do you guys think about that?
5141.02s: Is it a guarantee?
5142.02s: It's another fantastic question.
5147.26s: You tell me.
5149.26s: Dr. Zayz says, crush happens when the unknown becomes known.
5155.06s: That's good.
5157.10s: Willie says depends on the news.
5158.70s: Willie is correct.
5162.14s: So Willie.
5166.14s: G36 says IV will still decrease, but if the move is larger than the Delta can make up for
5171.38s: it, that's incorrect.
5172.38s: G36.
5173.38s: Elon's song says no guarantee.
5175.94s: So Elon's songs also gets one.
5179.22s: He says yes, that will decrease, but Delta can easily overwhelm that not necessarily.
5185.34s: Tommy also got it right.
5189.06s: Dr. Zayz also got it right.
5191.22s: So two, three, four trophies.
5199.46s: Plus fake one internet point to those four.
5204.42s: Now this is one of those things that again, the devil is in the details.
5211.50s: Is it guaranteed?
5213.02s: No.
5214.52s: Is it probable?
5216.02s: Yes.
5217.26s: The vast majority of instances you will see implied volatility contract through earnings.
5224.78s: In this instance, after earnings, it went up.
5228.42s: This is the day before earnings.
5230.62s: This is the day following the release.
5234.02s: So in this case, it went up.
5236.34s: It seldom the case, but the reason it can go up is if there's a terrible or a big piece
5242.62s: of information that just wasn't expected, and it causes even more expectation of movement.
5249.86s: That's exactly why you'll see it go up again, sometimes.
5254.98s: The overwhelming trend, however, is that it typically will go down.
5262.14s: The overwhelming trend, but not always into this person's question, certainly not guaranteed.
5271.14s: When does it happen?
5272.86s: Another great technical question.
5274.62s: So when we get this earnings crush, temporally, when does it happen?
5282.50s: Busy blends says, I mean, 90% of the time, Ivy does pump when earnings is near.
5286.34s: That's also correct.
5287.34s: I wouldn't say 90% of the time because I don't know if that's accurate and I don't like
5290.70s: giving bad data points like that, but I can tell you over 50% of the time, aka the majority,
5298.62s: Ivy will expand starting two weeks out leading into earnings.
5303.34s: So nothing wrong with that.
5306.62s: But you guys tell me, when does it happen?
5308.90s: So we know that Ivy tends to decline, okay, but when does it, when does it typically happen?
5318.02s: Anybody have any ideas?
5319.02s: After the release, that's a fair point.
5332.02s: Need a little more specific than that.
5337.30s: Tommy says when earnings come out after the call, that's moving in the correct direction,
5344.50s: the release is the closest so far.
5347.54s: G36 is wrong.
5353.74s: I would say Tommy and Reese are the most close.
5362.58s: So Tommy and Reese, you guys get close fake one at an point.
5367.06s: I gotta get my little trophy out.
5371.42s: There we go.
5374.18s: Reese took the under the null hypothesis says before earnings, which is incorrect as well.
5380.86s: Zacharias says right before the call from what I see that's also not the case.
5386.86s: Tommy says can I convert my points to Bitcoin?
5389.30s: Potentially.
5390.30s: Yeah, you'll have to see how you redeem them, but yeah, I think you're more than welcome
5394.62s: to convert to any of your preferred denominations.
5399.18s: So the period in time in which it actually moves is not going to be immediate.
5409.02s: The period in time for the Ivy Crush, I don't like calling it Ivy Crush to be honest
5413.10s: just because it's kind of like a beaten down phrase.
5416.10s: I don't really like it.
5417.86s: So it's just, I don't know, I guess a slight pet peeve, but let's see if we can find something
5423.54s: that recently had earnings.
5427.34s: Let's do.
5429.34s: I think one of these.
5432.54s: Yeah.
5434.66s: This is earnings within five days.
5438.54s: Oh, I forgot we never finished fixing this fucking scan.
5445.18s: Damn it.
5447.70s: Let me see if this does it.
5454.34s: So this should be looking for stuff with earnings in the past couple days.
5457.82s: Yeah, okay.
5458.82s: So that at least worked.
5463.46s: Let's take a look here.
5465.46s: I O T.
5466.78s: Let's take a look.
5473.30s: That's very interesting premiums moving.
5478.10s: Oh, yeah, because this is too short of a timeframe.
5481.66s: I don't think it will change much here.
5486.50s: It will, it will be really hard to see though.
5490.66s: When did it?
5493.66s: Oh, I need to go back a little bit further my bed.
5495.86s: I want to give us a little more time to differentiate.
5499.90s: Let's go back.
5503.34s: Of Roaring City says Ivy goes down when volume goes away.
5508.70s: Sort of.
5510.46s: That's not incorrect, but that's not necessarily what this is tied to.
5515.82s: So let's go back five days.
5518.94s: I want to go back a little bit further.
5526.50s: And yeah, this would be okay.
5529.30s: So Ulta had earnings on Thursday.
5534.46s: So if we take a look at implied volatility, this is using four hour candles.
5541.86s: So in this case, they reported after the market here.
5547.46s: So we can see short term wall started immediately after they reported.
5554.02s: And it continued through the first half of the next trading day.
5559.62s: And then it leveled off here into the tail end of the next trading day.
5565.90s: So in this case, it's showing you that generally speaking, you will find that earnings volatility
5572.66s: in a vacuum isolating the volatility for the release itself will tend to come out within
5578.94s: a few hours after the open following earnings.
5584.14s: And then there might be some sort of persistent drift that occurs.
5589.18s: But the movement that I personally would attribute to the earnings release in and of itself
5595.78s: would be probably a few hours after the open.
5600.22s: So that's another great question from them.
5604.02s: All right, we got a few more minutes.
5607.66s: So let's move on to another one.
5614.66s: I don't like this one.
5621.54s: I'm new to options haven't done any yet.
5623.62s: Try not understand them.
5624.62s: I've come up with an idea.
5625.62s: And I wonder if it's any good.
5626.62s: Like is it a normal idea?
5628.90s: My ideas to sell covered calls and KO stock that I have.
5631.90s: If I do this, my only risk is that the price goes above the strike price and the calls get
5636.94s: called away and I have to sell my stocks for less than the worth at the time.
5639.90s: And I get to keep any premium paid for the beginning.
5643.30s: So yeah, there are flaws in this methodology.
5650.54s: So one of the first flaws that I would highlight is specifically the risk component.
5658.90s: My only risk is that price goes above the strike price.
5664.22s: Is that correct?
5665.22s: Is that the only risk that they have?
5672.94s: I would argue nay.
5676.10s: Roy Titty says no.
5678.06s: Exactly.
5680.22s: You guys are directly on it.
5682.70s: Give me one second.
5684.10s: I'm going to go grab a reload seltzer water and then I'm going to be right back.
5689.26s: But you guys run it so far.
5691.14s: Oh, there's the wait.
5694.10s: That's kind of cool.
5695.10s: Look at me go.
5696.10s: Interesting.
5697.10s: Hi guys, from over here.
5698.10s: I kind of like this.
5699.10s: All right.
5700.10s: I'll be right back.
5754.10s: All right.
5761.10s: We're back at him.
5769.10s: What do you guys think?
5770.10s: I kind of like that cut out one was pretty cool.
5772.10s: Maybe I make myself even a little bit bigger.
5774.10s: Look at that.
5776.10s: We just think better that way or no.
5782.10s: Sorry.
5783.10s: Let's see what you guys say.
5789.66s: The calls are at risk as well.
5791.06s: I wouldn't say that personally.
5795.30s: Reese says which ticker was it if dividend.
5797.58s: That's a factor.
5798.58s: I can't believe you guys are missing this.
5799.58s: This is fucking nuts.
5802.94s: Loss upside.
5803.94s: Yeah.
5804.94s: There you go.
5805.94s: G 36.
5806.94s: G 36.
5807.94s: Got it.
5808.94s: Nice job.
5809.94s: G 36.
5811.70s: So G 36 hit the nail on the head.
5814.26s: Let's structure.
5815.26s: Let's pick something.
5816.26s: They have Coca-Cola stock.
5818.26s: K.O.
5819.26s: And let's say that they bought in at like 68.
5825.86s: And let's put on a perspective trade here.
5828.26s: So we'll go and buy.
5830.06s: Let's say that they have their 100 shares.
5832.74s: And then let's say that they have their 100 shares at 68 bucks.
5838.06s: And then let's say that they sell their short call 42 DTE whatever.
5842.90s: They're getting their few dollars here.
5845.14s: Analyze.
5846.14s: Where's the risk in this trade?
5848.94s: The risk is to the fucking downside.
5851.22s: Now they're not viewing it as a risk because in their mind they're like, oh, it's Coca-Cola
5856.34s: stock that I already hold.
5858.22s: So they're completely not understanding that the risk here is the downside.
5867.70s: Like that's exactly what the risk is here.
5871.82s: So the problem with this is that again, like what most traders do intend to do.
5878.14s: They're simply focusing on the profit.
5880.34s: How much money do I stand to make?
5882.18s: That's what they care about.
5884.78s: I had an MRI earlier today for the whole back bowl shit that I have going on and I had
5893.94s: the contrast injected, which apparently has like fucking metal in it.
5899.74s: So you're always trying to flush the metal out of the old system.
5904.58s: All right, back to you guys.
5906.98s: So yeah, G36 definitely gets a point here at G 36.
5913.58s: There you go.
5922.74s: G36 says I said that only given it away all upside potentially.
5925.98s: Yeah.
5926.98s: So the main thing here is the downside risk.
5931.46s: That's just to be abundantly clear.
5933.34s: That's precisely what they missed in this.
5935.98s: That's actually like really, really dangerous to them if we're being honest because it shows
5940.74s: like an entirely skewed perception of risk.
5945.78s: So now for everybody else, how can we fix their perceived risk?
5951.70s: There's an easy way to fix this problem.
5955.02s: How do we do that?
5963.06s: Ratio diagonal.
5964.22s: That's a massively effective way to do it.
5966.94s: There's another way that's more similar to what they have.
5970.02s: I would use a ratio diagonal simply because I would benefit for I would prefer the leverage
5976.26s: than holding the shares easy.
5978.34s: That's a easy, easy answer for me essentially every day of the week.
5981.66s: Hold that over the shares and you gain way more leverage.
5986.82s: I absolutely would take that.
5989.42s: But that's not actually what I'm thinking in this case.
5995.34s: Reese says I can see if they already hold that stock and have downside risk already.
5999.66s: Yeah, it's whether they hold the stock where they're putting on the stock for the race
6004.06s: or for the covered call.
6007.38s: It doesn't matter.
6008.38s: If you hold stock, there's downside risk.
6011.02s: People forget that literally all the time for some reason, but that's the risk of holding
6016.66s: the stock.
6017.90s: Now the funny part about covered calls is that Reese says in their mind, they may already
6024.82s: have it.
6025.82s: So the downside risk is already prevalent.
6027.42s: Right, it doesn't matter, right?
6029.94s: Like whether in their mind it's there and exists or not, it doesn't the point I'm highlighting
6034.10s: is that it's there.
6035.62s: Regardless of how they're trying to rationalize the downside risk or lack thereof, it's
6041.94s: there.
6042.94s: That's the primary risk in this trade.
6045.22s: And the important point, Blizzy says, but the downside risk doesn't matter.
6049.10s: It entirely matters.
6050.86s: That is, that is complete folly.
6053.58s: Whether or not a trader is willing to hold a stock doesn't negate the downside risk.
6060.14s: It's still there.
6061.98s: And it still has an impact of the portfolio.
6064.30s: Again, that's the naïve tay of traders that don't like realizing losing positions or
6070.94s: having losing positions to tie up capital for extended durations before they can get
6076.14s: out out of profit.
6077.54s: That's the exact problem with this kind of thing.
6080.90s: Is that traders think that exact kind of way?
6082.94s: They think, oh, well, I hold the stock.
6084.86s: I'm okay holding it.
6085.86s: And even if they're okay holding it, guess what?
6088.30s: If Coca-Cola drops, let's take a look at an example.
6091.14s: We got in at 68.
6093.14s: Let's pretend Coca-Cola, instead of being right now at 71.
6097.78s: Let's just not even, I'm not even going to pick a crazy thing.
6099.82s: I'm going to pick something that's happened recently.
6101.62s: It's go over the past year.
6102.62s: It was down to $51.
6105.30s: So let's say instead of at 71, it's at 51.
6109.54s: I'm holding a position right now that's a $1,600 loss on a $6,800 outlay.
6117.46s: I forgot, I have a calculator over here.
6119.02s: I'm going to have to do it there.
6120.86s: So we got in at, we were calling it 68.
6125.26s: And right now it's running at 51.
6127.18s: That's actually funny.
6128.18s: It's very satisfying.
6129.18s: It's a 25% decrease in value.
6132.82s: So now you're holding something that's down $25.
6135.34s: And now you're like, shit, well, I don't want to get out now.
6137.22s: I still like the stock long term.
6138.90s: And that's okay.
6139.90s: You can like the stock long term.
6140.90s: But guess what?
6142.26s: While this $6,800 is tied up in this losing stock position, it could be, it should be
6149.70s: making money.
6150.70s: But it's not.
6152.02s: It's tied up in this.
6154.14s: And this position gave you $86.
6158.22s: That's what you got on your short call.
6159.62s: You made $86.
6161.94s: And now the underlying is trading so low that you can no longer sell calls against it above
6168.18s: your basis at least.
6169.90s: So then you're like, okay, well, maybe I'll sell calls below, below my basis.
6174.14s: Well now there's a risk.
6176.26s: The risk is if it starts skyrocketing up, now you have to try to manage this short call
6183.14s: again tying up capital longer and longer and longer to extend your profit trivially.
6189.54s: So this is a massive, massive risk that again, traders talk themselves out of.
6194.98s: And again, there's nothing wrong with accepting this risk.
6199.02s: There's nothing wrong with saying, that's my approach.
6201.46s: I don't care about the opportunity cost.
6203.66s: I'm okay.
6205.06s: And you can do that.
6206.82s: That's completely okay.
6208.62s: But it's just important to acknowledge the cost associated with it.
6214.14s: There's a difference between saying, I am okay and acknowledge the risk and opportunity
6221.14s: cost.
6222.90s: There's a difference between that and saying there is no risk.
6226.50s: No man, like the risk is there.
6229.70s: You can accept that it's there or not or you can be okay with the risk or not.
6234.54s: But to turn that into there's no risk, it's literally defying reality.
6241.82s: It doesn't make sense.
6247.26s: That's the broader point.
6249.78s: Busy says if you're a buy and hold in trader, it doesn't matter in my opinion.
6255.70s: Yeah, that's okay.
6256.70s: But again, if you're a buy and hold trader and you acknowledge the risk and you say,
6261.70s: I'm okay with this risk.
6262.78s: I want to hold Coca-Cola for 30 years.
6265.18s: That's completely cool.
6266.94s: There's nothing wrong with that.
6268.22s: Again, the problem I'm highlighting is a lack of objective analysis based on an internal
6274.30s: preference.
6275.86s: Just because I'm a buy and hold investor and I have a preference for holding things
6279.42s: long term and I don't care if it goes down, I'm going to dollar cost average into it,
6282.58s: which is also okay.
6283.58s: There's nothing wrong with that.
6285.98s: There's something wrong with not being able to objectively realize and analyze the
6291.14s: risk of something because of a perspective.
6294.18s: Just because I don't mind with standing the draw downs doesn't mean it's not a risk.
6299.74s: It absolutely is a risk.
6303.14s: If I'm okay with it, then that's cool.
6304.62s: No problem with the risk.
6305.78s: I acknowledge it.
6306.78s: I see it.
6307.78s: I say it's there and I'm okay with it.
6310.58s: But again, the big problem is that if we're so wrapped up in our perspective of doing
6315.46s: things that we just don't want to see the risk, that's a fucking problem.
6320.54s: That's a giant problem.
6322.26s: So yeah, when it comes to, I think somebody said up above, let me see, Rointit, he says,
6328.98s: so are you against the wheel?
6330.42s: No way.
6331.42s: No, I'm not against the wheel.
6332.42s: I don't trade it.
6333.94s: And I have a video that talks about the problems that I have with the wheel.
6340.50s: And I will show you.
6342.10s: This is a bit of an old video, so you'll have to forgive essentially everything about it.
6348.10s: There you go.
6352.90s: So that one talks about the wheel versus the coverage triangle.
6358.34s: And there's a reason why I prefer the coverage triangle writ large.
6363.58s: The punchline is I have absolutely no problem with the wheel, especially for newer traders.
6368.10s: I actually think it's a bit of a safer quote unquote strategy, but I much prefer the
6374.18s: coverage triangle or ratio covered calls.
6378.14s: Because again, going off of a definition, this is the wheel essentially.
6383.22s: I'm going to sell cash secured puts until I'm assigned.
6388.14s: The problem with doing that is let's say that you're selling, let's say you like Coca-Cola
6394.18s: and you want to trade it to the upside.
6397.50s: You're like, okay, I'm going to sell these cash secured puts until I'm assigned.
6403.90s: Okay, well guess what?
6405.50s: You never got assigned because it just went up from here.
6410.66s: So what's the problem with that?
6412.26s: Sure, you absolutely would have made money.
6415.14s: But guess what you would have made far more money with.
6419.74s: Buy in the fucking stock.
6422.10s: So the big problem I see exactly, G36 is right on it.
6427.74s: I think the problem for people that trade the wheel is they get addicted to a really high
6434.30s: win rate.
6435.30s: They love the sensation of selling puts, they expire worthless, they love that feeling.
6440.90s: Who doesn't?
6442.10s: The idea of being right on a bunch of trades is awesome.
6445.78s: There's a problem.
6449.30s: Just again, in objective analysis standpoint, you would have made more money doing something
6455.10s: else.
6456.10s: But we're too wrapped up in this great sensation of winning and feeling like we're doing
6461.38s: this really smart thing and winning a bunch of trades that we don't really acknowledge
6466.06s: that.
6467.30s: So I have no fundamental issue with the wheel.
6471.14s: If it were me, I would essentially always, always, always sell the calls at a ratio.
6477.74s: And I would always sell additional cash secure puts like if I were going to trade it,
6482.74s: which essentially turns it into the coverage strangle, which is why I like that strategy
6486.14s: a lot personally.
6490.10s: Reese says also in the wheel, most people don't admit defeat and think rolling isn't losing.
6493.86s: Yeah, oh, yeah, that's a disease.
6495.70s: I literally showed you a post.
6497.70s: I'll find it really quick.
6499.46s: I showed you a post from not too long ago where I commented on something and somebody was
6504.18s: just like it's here.
6508.54s: That's actually kind of funny.
6509.54s: It's like one of my more recent posts here.
6517.42s: So this says, do I lose money rolling options?
6522.86s: And then this person says a loss if rolled for it, I was going to make sure I downloaded
6527.90s: it.
6528.90s: A loss is a loss only if rolled for a debit.
6535.18s: And then they actually responded and then ended up taking it down.
6538.62s: But this like, it's just wrong.
6542.22s: It doesn't matter if you roll for a creditor debit like this is what a role entails.
6548.22s: We're closing a trade and realizing the P and L on that trade, whatever the P and L
6554.98s: of that trade is.
6556.86s: Positive or negative, you realize that P and L and then you open up a new trade that's
6562.10s: associated with it.
6563.94s: But it doesn't get rid of the realized P and L from this other trade.
6568.46s: It's there.
6569.46s: It's always going to be there.
6570.62s: But again, that's exact that's an exact thing that you'll find with a lot of wheel traders.
6575.18s: They have such an issue accepting and dealing with losing trades.
6582.26s: It's such a mental process for them that it completely fucks them up.
6586.14s: That's my opinion.
6588.14s: Dennis says, with the wheel you're always buying higher than the market and selling lower
6597.14s: than the market.
6598.14s: It's a lose.
6599.14s: Yeah, that's actually funny if you think of it that way.
6600.62s: That's awesome.
6601.62s: G36 says, I want Eric to be my dad.
6605.90s: I'm not sure that you want that.
6607.06s: I'm not sure anybody wants that.
6608.62s: But humbled for the sentiment, but yeah, probably wouldn't be probably wouldn't be the guy
6614.98s: for the job.
6619.34s: Release this Eric for president.
6620.94s: I also have zero aspirations for political office.
6623.94s: So yeah, apparently I'm just letting you guys down all over the place.
6630.58s: Potato says was top common accurate just selling the position and buying a new farther
6634.72s: out dated one.
6636.42s: Oh, let me see.
6641.34s: Rolling options is a fancy way of selling your selling your current position and buying.
6645.42s: No, because you're not necessarily buying, but yeah, they're confused.
6649.14s: But yeah, they're not wrong.
6650.70s: It's literally just closing a trade and opening a new one.
6653.22s: I have a bunch of videos on rolling.
6655.34s: I'll throw a couple in here because I have a video that breaks down all of these different
6660.50s: myths and how it actually works.
6664.10s: So this is an older one about the myths of rolling.
6670.50s: And then these are two new videos that I recently did that talk about more of the details
6678.86s: about rolling.
6679.86s: But yeah, rolling is fine.
6682.06s: Again, like there's absolutely nothing wrong with rolling in options trade.
6686.42s: I do it all the time.
6687.98s: But again, the problem traders have is that in the process of doing these things, we
6692.70s: dilute ourselves.
6693.70s: And we say, no, it's not a loss if it's done not for a debit.
6699.02s: Well, fun fact, you can even roll for a debit and still make money.
6703.10s: So even that's wrong.
6704.50s: I'll literally show you an example.
6708.14s: If we use my little handy dandy calculator here, this is from my Excel sheet.
6715.86s: Let's say in this, I don't even remember, we looked at this together before, if our
6719.42s: M or whatever.
6721.06s: And let's say that this is the position, right?
6724.26s: So these are the dates that we entered.
6726.42s: This is what the stock was at.
6727.58s: We looked at a one lot, a 30 strike, we got a dollar 53.
6730.66s: We closed that for $3.45.
6733.18s: So I literally line it out, clear as day over here.
6736.90s: So what happens over here?
6738.90s: When I sell to open this put, I get $153.
6743.30s: That's money that's not immediately factored.
6748.62s: It's parked into the cash and sweep.
6751.50s: And then it's tied to an open trade.
6754.46s: So for example, if I sell a call, I get this $153, your net liquidating value does not
6760.90s: go up by $153 because it's tied to an open trade.
6765.46s: Net liquidating values, if you closed everything right now, what can you take out of the
6768.82s: account?
6770.18s: So it doesn't go into net lick.
6772.78s: It goes into cash and sweep and it sits in cash and sweep.
6776.50s: So then in this case, we, in this scenario, we bought back that option for $3.45.
6784.02s: So that means that we just realized a $345 loss on this trade, the net PNL between these
6793.22s: two trades is essentially these two numbers combined.
6796.38s: What's this?
6797.38s: Plus this.
6799.02s: You lost $192.
6801.30s: That's the net.
6802.98s: So that's essentially what this shows you here.
6807.58s: So that's what you walk out at.
6809.34s: After these two positions, you collected $153 at the end of it, you had to give $345.
6817.46s: So you had that $153.
6819.14s: You just gave that back and then you had to give $192 on top of that out of your own pocket
6825.98s: to close the position.
6828.06s: That's the first part of a role right there.
6832.26s: And then the second part of the role is when we open a new trade.
6837.62s: So in this case, the scenario we use is we sold it for $3.50.
6843.34s: So that means we got $3.50 times $1350.
6847.66s: So now if you take a look at all of these individual positions, you can see, so equals
6853.90s: this plus this plus this 158 bucks.
6859.30s: That's how much you're up if this came comes down for $0.
6865.14s: That's what that means.
6866.82s: Now I use a formula as you can tell here called the premium target and it tells me what
6874.94s: do I need to close this option at in order for me to hit break even.
6882.02s: So in this case, if I sold this option for $350, I needed to be trading at $158 to be
6887.82s: at break even for the position.
6891.26s: So if I hit 158, I'm flat.
6895.38s: Now this idea of having to roll for a credit, it's wrong.
6899.22s: You don't have to roll for a credit.
6901.18s: So let's look at another scenario.
6903.06s: I sold for $1.53.
6905.10s: I closed it for $3.45.
6907.34s: Let's say I open the next one for $3.35.
6910.46s: It's a 10 cent debit.
6912.50s: I can still make money.
6915.26s: In this case, I can still make $143.
6918.02s: Even if I roll for a fucking debit, but again, people don't know this shit because they
6924.22s: don't take the time to look into the details because they're too worried about what their
6928.50s: ego feels about winning or losing.
6931.82s: So I can have a trade that I roll that I realize a loss that I open up a new trade literally
6938.54s: for a debit and I can still make money.
6940.26s: I can break all the rules here according to a lot of these people.
6944.50s: So this in and of itself is what rolling is.
6948.62s: It's two trades tied together.
6952.94s: That's all there is to it.
6954.82s: Simple as that.
6956.50s: So yeah, I think that the concept of rolling is super important because people literally
6961.46s: dork it up all the time.
6963.74s: And it's because there's so much like different like mental components that are baked into
6968.54s: it.
6971.86s: Tommy says have to track the trades.
6973.26s: Math tells the truth.
6974.26s: That's exactly it.
6976.26s: It's straight up just numbers.
6979.98s: Now the other thing that we have to know about rolling that's super important is that
6983.66s: you are tying up capital.
6986.46s: So as you're going through these positions and rolling them, rolling them, rolling them,
6990.42s: you'll notice that yeah, I can roll for a small credit and make a little bit of money.
6993.86s: Let's grab that example back really quick.
6996.82s: So if we just keep running through this example and let's say that I get my five cent credit.
7002.66s: So I get in for 350.
7004.74s: And then let's say that I have to close this one for four dollars.
7010.34s: And then let's say I can open this next one for four dollars and five cents.
7015.66s: And then I need to include the number there.
7018.78s: Like the amount that I stand to make on this trade is pennies.
7024.34s: It's not much.
7025.34s: I'm not adding a lot with each of these steps.
7029.50s: So yes, I might be able to get out of this trade for a win.
7034.30s: But how much money am I actually adding by rolling for that credit?
7038.98s: In this case, I stood to make 153 here.
7042.82s: I rolled for a five cent credit.
7046.10s: So I just added five dollars to my total profit potential.
7050.94s: And then here I rolled for 405, got my net credit.
7054.54s: I just added five dollars to my total profit potential.
7058.74s: How long does this whole thing take with all these roles?
7062.90s: There's an opportunity cost to this money.
7065.98s: Again, people, the average trader is delusional as you think as they think about trading because
7074.26s: they get too wrapped up trying to avoid losing positions.
7078.66s: And they totally fail to like understand that losing is fine.
7083.46s: Losing is completely fine.
7085.30s: If you can learn how to be a good loser in trading, you're going to do much better than
7089.86s: the vast majority of other people that get wrapped up with every losing position.
7094.62s: Literally guarantee it.
7096.22s: Because if you have a problem with losing is trading, you're going to have a lot of issues
7099.18s: doing the right things because it includes taking losses.
7107.74s: That's what I say.
7112.66s: Chris says so credit spreads.
7114.94s: What's your typical thought for best practices for the gaps?
7118.54s: You want to buy in the money and sell out of the money, but typically you want that trade
7121.90s: within a day within a day or closer to expiration.
7129.54s: Chris, I don't actually totally follow your question, but in general, for gaps, that's
7139.74s: kind of the point of a credits.
7141.26s: Wait, when you say gaps, do you mean the spread with or do you mean gap in terms of price
7146.54s: movement with the underlying?
7147.94s: I don't fully follow that question.
7151.18s: Vladimir Offputin says, how many years trading options until your aha moment or was it
7164.26s: gradual?
7165.26s: Super gradual for me.
7166.26s: I still don't feel like there's an aha moment where it feels like you just get everything.
7171.66s: I think it's something that you slowly pick up over time.
7176.86s: Chris says like a 12 and 15 spread, for example.
7179.18s: Okay.
7180.18s: So, Chris, when you're referring to gaps, most people, when we hear gap, we're going
7186.18s: to think a gap in stock price like this.
7190.46s: So, yeah, so Chris, in that sense, we would say a $3 wide, that's how we would phrase
7199.74s: that.
7200.74s: We wouldn't call it a gap.
7201.74s: We would say $3 wide or the spread is a $5 spread.
7206.62s: Those are two ways.
7207.78s: So, again, it's for beginners, right?
7209.70s: So, helping you understand some of the lingo.
7212.26s: So for those, it's actually, I don't really trade spreads like that.
7218.10s: I don't really like credit spreads or vertical spreads specifically.
7222.46s: But if I were to trade them, I would try to trade them as wide as I can.
7229.90s: And I would essentially trade it as a naked option.
7232.78s: And then I would just use the wing for margin management if I needed it.
7239.22s: But like for me, I'm not going to do a $5 wide credit spread.
7245.74s: I'm essentially going to, I'm essentially going to short the 70 put in this example.
7251.38s: I might buy the 60, the 55 or the 50 if I have a small account and I need to manage
7257.62s: the basis.
7258.86s: But then I'm going to manage this 70 put like it's a naked short put.
7262.74s: I'm not going to manage it like it's a credit spread personally.
7266.06s: Now there are times that you can put on a credit spread that are positively expected.
7271.58s: I have on one right now an ASTS.
7274.78s: So for that, what I do is I measure the width and I try to find the width that gives
7279.94s: me the best expected return.
7282.90s: So in that example, I have a calculator.
7287.10s: I think we went over this not too long ago that essentially helps me calculate the expected
7293.18s: return for spreads specifically.
7297.90s: And based on the width of the strike, the probability of profit, the credit received, those
7302.26s: kinds of inputs, I can then decide what I need to see from the trade in order for it to
7307.98s: be positively expected.
7310.10s: So that's typically what I'm targeting.
7315.94s: R&Tity says, aren't they a tool for people that kind of want to park money and earn a steady
7320.10s: income?
7322.10s: What are we talking about?
7324.26s: R&Tity.
7328.78s: And then Vlad Amiro Putin says, how to protect against overnight gaps down.
7332.50s: Let's say you hold long calls and bad news is released after hours.
7335.70s: Your primary tool is sizing.
7338.42s: Size the trade.
7341.26s: R&Tity says, okay, credit spreads.
7343.30s: Oh, I don't think so.
7344.26s: I think you might be talking about a box spread maybe, R&Tity, because a box spread does
7349.46s: that for you.
7350.78s: A credit spread is a directional trade.
7353.86s: So a credit spread, whether like if it's a put credit spread, it's essentially a bullish
7358.86s: trade.
7360.02s: And then if it's a call credit spread, it's essentially a bearish trade.
7366.90s: But it's not really a place to like park your money.
7368.54s: The trade definitely still has risk.
7372.58s: So like for example, if we take a look at this $5 wide credit spread in Coca-Cola, just
7377.58s: because we're here.
7380.26s: It's $5 wide.
7382.38s: You collect $87 and you're risking 413.
7391.34s: So yeah.
7398.10s: And then Vlad Amiro just so you know my response to that really wasn't dismissive.
7401.86s: That's the God on a truth in my opinion is to size the portfolio correctly and maintain
7407.66s: a diversified portfolio.
7409.74s: So if you have 100% of your entire portfolio in an individual stock and you're trading
7417.62s: long calls, that's one of the risks you expose yourself to is essentially idiosyncratic
7424.74s: risk, something that's very unique to that individual product.
7428.98s: So I think sizing is probably the best possible thing you could do after sizing.
7435.58s: It's holding a diversified portfolio of different products.
7440.30s: Reese says need to collect about a third of the width of the spread to have positive
7443.34s: expectancy.
7444.34s: It's completely dependent on the probabilities.
7448.34s: So it's not quite as neat as a third.
7453.30s: For like a 30 delta, it's pretty close.
7459.98s: I'm trying to see where I have that spread.
7462.58s: Yeah, this one we talked about this one.
7465.34s: Oh, we I don't know if we did this with just the Patreon folks.
7469.82s: I don't remember when we did this one, but we talked about the spread.
7472.66s: So this is essentially like the calculator.
7474.66s: This one I copied over for my excel sheet, but so like all this is broken, but this
7479.58s: is essentially the way that I look at it.
7481.38s: If I'm looking at a spread and I want to see if it's positively expected from the sizing.
7488.30s: So it's just based on essentially the different probability of profit, the width and then
7496.70s: the credit received.
7499.22s: Reese says we did an example on the dollar wide of his 30 cents.
7502.78s: Yeah, so it was 30 cents with a 70% probability of profit.
7506.58s: So we need to also include the probability of profit.
7510.38s: Yeah, it's a really important portion of the input because if you have something that
7515.06s: is a massively high probability of profit, then you can you can collect a lower credit,
7519.94s: but that's the problem with credit spreads is they don't tend to offer that exposure.
7529.54s: I'm loving the questions.
7530.70s: I think our dinner just got here, but I still got a few minutes.
7536.22s: So Ricky says, what if I love winning more than I love making higher profits?
7542.30s: Yeah, then you can do that.
7543.90s: The market can accommodate that and there are a lot of people in the market that are
7547.66s: not purely rational like that.
7549.94s: So if that's what you like doing, then do whatever's right for you, but yeah, you're going
7555.58s: to give up money to it.
7557.54s: Which is no good.
7560.90s: Chris says, what's your preference on time spreads, sell shorter DTE by longer?
7566.22s: It depends on what I'm trying to trade.
7568.02s: See, this is one of the common thing traders do, right?
7571.46s: Because we try to create rule sets about strategies and it's not the way that I look at trading
7578.62s: literally at all.
7581.98s: So if I take a look at, I think I have it in here.
7590.06s: Let me see if I can find it.
7592.82s: No.
7594.82s: No.
7595.82s: No.
7597.30s: No.
7598.30s: We got all sorts of references in here at this point.
7602.02s: No.
7603.02s: Oh, this works.
7605.14s: I don't know if I'll learn, makes sense here.
7609.62s: Oh, I guess this makes sense.
7611.66s: Yeah.
7612.66s: Okay.
7613.66s: So anyways, this is what I think makes way more sense.
7618.34s: So for Chris, in this scenario, when I'm looking at something like time spreads, I'm not
7625.50s: going to define the rules that I'm going to use for the time spread before I define what
7630.82s: I'm doing.
7632.42s: So you'll notice that if I'm trying to build a strategy, I need to think about profit
7636.90s: mechanisms first, then I need to figure out how I measure them.
7641.26s: And then I can start talking about structures and strategy.
7644.94s: So in your example, the way that I would determine if what DTEs I want and how I'm going
7652.30s: to structure the entire trade is entirely dependent on the profit mechanism.
7657.26s: I'm not going to come into a position with the idea of like, oh, I'm just going to trade
7661.74s: a time spread here because that's what I want that it doesn't mean anything.
7666.98s: I need to make money.
7669.30s: So in order to trade something like that, I would have to start with whatever the profit
7674.06s: mechanism is.
7675.42s: So the profit mechanism sometimes for things like time spreads is potentially playing the
7680.12s: relative value between options.
7684.12s: Chris says that's what I was hoping you would talk about the thought process.
7686.44s: Yeah, sure.
7687.44s: Happy to.
7688.44s: You know I'm happy to.
7689.28s: So this is less about time spreads though.
7692.28s: And this is more about options trading.
7696.48s: So if I take a look, we'll try Coca-Cola because it's up by volatility.
7701.88s: Let's look at the other monies.
7703.60s: Let's kill this first one.
7705.60s: Yeah, there we go.
7707.00s: Okay.
7708.00s: Great example.
7709.00s: I see here at the 61.
7712.32s: I see that the 20 set.
7715.96s: It has higher vol than the 13 set.
7718.92s: So I could make the relative value play that the 13 set, 61s need to become more expensive
7725.88s: relative to the 20 set.
7727.92s: So in that scenario, I would find this exact strike in this case, the 61s.
7734.16s: And then I would buy and sell.
7736.44s: So these are obviously super, super far out of the money on the put side.
7740.88s: But again, this is just a general example.
7743.72s: So I think these need to get more expensive, right?
7746.48s: That's the theory is that the 13 sets need to come up and the 20 sets need to come down.
7754.40s: So then I'll go to the 20 set, 61s, whatever this ends up being again.
7758.48s: I don't actually know what those would be.
7762.12s: I would do something like that.
7765.88s: So this one's going to be obviously skewed pretty heavily primarily because of how
7773.08s: wide this is.
7774.08s: But I'm just giving you an example of how to use something like that.
7779.92s: So in this case, that's essentially the way that I could trade them for that purpose.
7785.36s: But again, the important part is defining the profit mechanism first.
7789.28s: How does this thing make money?
7792.32s: And then I can start thinking about other considerations like in this case, how did I pick
7799.08s: the DTE?
7800.08s: Well, because I looked for the explorations that had something that looked interesting.
7804.48s: I could look for ones where there's even greater inversions or I can look for things that
7809.96s: are in a specific direction that I want.
7812.44s: So all of that will help me identify if I want the call side, the put side.
7817.12s: If I want near term DTE, long term DTE, that's all dependent on the profit mechanism.
7827.56s: Roaring Titty says, I don't think past all the prerequisites to be trading options.
7833.96s: Don't worry, Roaring Titty.
7835.28s: I literally think that's the same case for essentially all of us that have ever traded
7841.12s: options.
7842.12s: So to me, I actually think that makes you even more the option trader.
7845.64s: Well, what I would show you is back to this little guide thing that I keep highlighting
7850.16s: because I think it's useful.
7852.48s: Here I give you specific learning objectives for each of these steps that I think makes
7858.08s: sense.
7859.24s: And then actually, if you go to the next page, you'll see that each of these, I show you
7866.20s: like sub topics that belong to each of these that you should have a working understanding
7871.36s: of.
7872.36s: So eventually, I want to build some sort of quiz or test that's built into this.
7879.16s: I haven't figured out exactly how I want to do it.
7881.28s: I might have to do it through like a Google sheet that then sends the answers or something
7885.20s: afterwards.
7886.36s: I haven't worked out the details there.
7887.76s: That's one of those things that's like on Erics to do list, but it's super low if I'm
7891.92s: being honest with you.
7893.56s: But I do want to build something like that.
7897.60s: But yeah, I think it's okay to start without a full understanding, but I do think it's
7907.48s: important to make sure that you understand what you're doing.
7910.44s: This is actually one of the things that we offer in the Discord, even the free side,
7914.04s: not the pay side.
7915.24s: In the free side, you can go through these modules and you can ask people in the beginner
7920.20s: section questions, right?
7921.52s: Like, hey, I just finished the module two on the types of securities.
7927.12s: Can somebody help me make sure I understand?
7929.56s: And somebody typically, even if it's not me, but somebody will typically try and take
7934.04s: a look with you.
7935.04s: For the Patreon folks, we have a specific section.
7936.92s: We'll all go through with them.
7938.48s: But obviously, I just have limited bandwidth.
7940.00s: I can't promise to do that with everybody.
7942.28s: But I do my best.
7943.92s: And the community in general will also be there to help.
7946.96s: But yeah, I think this would add a lot of structure.
7951.20s: That's the whole idea behind it.
7955.84s: Chris says, HBIV or Greeks in thoughts at all.
7959.72s: Yeah, I mean, they're all super important.
7961.72s: I shared a video earlier about the Greeks.
7964.52s: I actually have a video.
7965.68s: I don't know.
7966.68s: You probably haven't seen it.
7967.68s: Let me grab this playlist for you.
7969.08s: My guess is this playlist would be really useful for you.
7971.60s: This is going to be in options 101 playlist.
7975.00s: And I have like an options 101 video that's kind of old in there, but I still think it's
7980.08s: good.
7981.08s: So you can start with that here.
7985.24s: So this is investing in trading 101.
7988.04s: That's like real, real basics.
7990.20s: And then this is options 101.
7993.28s: So I would start with that second link.
7995.16s: But in there, you'll find a link to a video that goes through the Greeks,
7998.28s: experienced premiums.
8000.20s: Chris says, I know them, but mean with that spread question.
8005.44s: Well, if you know them playing devil's advocate here,
8009.40s: if you know them, then you would know the answer to that question.
8013.00s: So I would argue that you might not know them, maybe as well as you think for that reason.
8019.12s: But let's see.
8021.12s: Like when you are doing you buy cell, that confuses me.
8031.36s: Sorry.
8033.40s: So time decay, gamma changing delta.
8036.96s: Yep.
8037.96s: Okay.
8038.96s: So in the meantime, I'm going to look at all these different logos on here, because like
8046.64s: this guy's funny, maybe I can start using him.
8049.56s: If I'm mad.
8051.92s: Like IV crushing.
8054.28s: Yeah.
8055.28s: I'm sorry, I'm not following your question, because like in this example for the horizontal
8062.16s: spread, that's that's exactly I'm looking at I'm playing the volatility here.
8066.84s: That's exactly what I'm trying to isolate.
8068.76s: I'm trying to play the volatility in 20 step contracting and the volatility in 13 step
8073.76s: expanding.
8075.76s: Yeah.
8077.64s: So.
8081.12s: So the Greeks help us understand how a position will behave.
8088.84s: Chris says theta crush could be wasting your time on the shorter.
8092.60s: It could be.
8093.60s: Yeah, there's no free lunch, right?
8095.16s: That's exactly to your point.
8096.88s: That's the point of the Greeks is because it tells us what needs to happen in order for
8102.72s: our idea to play out.
8107.24s: Chris says, for example, you want the IV crush for the shorter.
8111.08s: Well, okay.
8113.32s: So just to nitpick terminology a little bit, I think what you're trying to say here is
8119.48s: that you're trying to structure a trade where the shorter term option will you think that's
8127.60s: where the IV contraction is going to occur.
8129.84s: Because I would just always remind like the market doesn't give a fuck what you want or
8133.64s: what anybody else wants.
8134.64s: It doesn't matter what we want.
8136.48s: So I'm just drawing that distinction because I would be really careful even using the terminology
8141.28s: of like want in that instance.
8145.88s: Chris says so and so that's the goal for the shorter one.
8151.16s: You look at all not just.
8154.76s: I'm trying to do my absolute best to follow you, but I am.
8164.48s: I'm really I'm really fucking lost here.
8167.88s: Vladimir off Putin says Tommy DK effect worse both ways high performing people don't rate
8172.88s: themselves highly.
8173.88s: Well, that's kind of the point, those is high people recognize their own.
8181.40s: They recognize their own shortfalls.
8183.52s: So the Dunning Kruger effect doesn't it doesn't persist that way for educated people.
8189.96s: So I think this one.
8194.36s: This one here has something for the Dunning Kruger effect.
8197.80s: So there's a point where in this slope of learning phase, you know a lot more than
8204.92s: you probably think you know, but you also know there's a lot you don't know.
8209.92s: But there's a point that eventually comes where you do hit mastery and like you know what
8214.20s: you're doing, right?
8215.20s: So in the example of trading, I can objectively analyze that there's a ton of shit that I
8220.08s: don't know that I'm continually learning.
8222.80s: I also know a lot of fucking shit and I know I know a lot of fucking shit.
8227.24s: That's not because I'm cocky.
8228.96s: I'm definitely confident because I have a demonstrated skill set over nearly two decades
8235.88s: that I can look at and see, right?
8238.44s: So I can objectively evaluate myself.
8242.00s: So the Dunning Kruger effect to your point does affect people that are in the slope of
8248.56s: learning where they might think they know less or might judge their competence lower than
8255.00s: it actually is, but there comes a point where they you know, right?
8260.96s: Because even something like mastery, right?
8262.72s: We tend to use the 10,000 hour mark for stuff like this.
8266.36s: People don't realize how long that takes.
8268.76s: So 10,000 hours, if you do something five hours every single day, Monday through Friday,
8277.60s: Christmas, New Year's, no hungover, drunk phase, none of that.
8283.32s: If you do that for, it takes five and a half years to hit this.
8288.40s: That's at five hours every single day.
8292.76s: So the vast majority of people obviously are not going to spend this and it takes a lot
8297.84s: longer than that.
8299.80s: So once you get to this point of like quote, quote, mastery, you kind of know you're there
8305.60s: because you've been doing it for a while at that point.
8308.16s: That's my thought.
8311.68s: Michael has he says, can't you know shares of a company is going by options?
8315.16s: You can't know, but you can use them to derive inferences for sure.
8319.56s: So the options chains can tell you a lot.
8322.36s: I actually have a video in the queue about like reading an options chain and essentially
8329.84s: the goal of that video is to walk through a lot of those small things on how you can read
8336.36s: between the lines on an options chain and use it to help you identify information.
8343.72s: So it's not just the idea of like how to functionally read an options chain.
8348.32s: That's obviously part of it.
8349.84s: But the bigger part of it is using it to try and make money by using it for some of its
8356.64s: predictive qualities.
8358.32s: Now the problem with that kind of thing is a lot of people don't realize that things
8361.60s: are relative and you have to develop a bit of a fingerprint for whatever it is that
8366.64s: you're looking at.
8368.24s: So for example, if we're looking at something like GameStop, I can tell you based on the
8376.28s: near term performance that today there was some really interesting price movement.
8383.32s: I can see lots of options moving in big blocks, but then when I look in time and sales,
8389.48s: I can see some really big trades that came through today at different points in time.
8396.00s: So there's a lot of different ways that you can use options.
8400.68s: You can use volatility in something like this to see like where the market thinks things
8408.48s: are going.
8409.48s: So in this case, I can see there's 174% fall for next week and then the week after that's
8413.44s: 149.
8414.44s: And then like the week before that, this was like 100 and something earlier.
8418.32s: So why is that?
8419.52s: It's because something's going on here.
8421.20s: Obviously now we know it's earnings.
8423.28s: But if you look at some of my older videos where we didn't know earnings had shifted out,
8427.16s: I had been pointing out this expiration cycle for a while because I could see it.
8432.48s: It was telling me something and my best guess and I called it out in a video that I thought
8437.84s: earnings was probably going to shift because of the way that the market was pricing.
8444.84s: So yeah, options markets are crazy, crazy informed places.
8450.52s: You can look for all different kinds of skew.
8452.84s: You can look for unusual trades.
8455.00s: I have all sorts of scanners that are running all the time to help me identify interesting
8459.56s: opportunities because of those reasons.
8463.88s: All right, gang, it is time for me to go eat my Indian food.
8468.96s: Absolute blast hanging out.
8469.96s: I love the beginner session.
8470.96s: It's so fun to dive into these kinds of things with you all.
8474.40s: I am probably going to do a little bit of a workshop in the discord tomorrow.
8478.60s: I haven't figured out a time before the game stop live stream, but there's going to be
8482.80s: a game stop live stream tomorrow at 5 p.m. Pacific time.
8485.24s: We have a lot to talk about on this one.
8488.12s: And as always, hit me up with anything you want me to cover any suggestions, any questions
8492.76s: here to help be an outlier enjoy your weekends.
8496.16s: Not too much.
8497.16s: Get some work done.
8498.16s: I'll see you all later.
