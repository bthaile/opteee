0.00s:  What's up, outliers?
1.92s:  You know what time it is?
3.16s:  It's time to get back to the basics.
5.72s:  It's time to look at some fundamental trading concepts so that we can all dust off our
11.52s:  skill sets and hopefully make a few dollars out there in the markets.
15.88s:  We'll see how it goes.
16.88s:  Who knows?
17.88s:  Nobody ever knows.
18.88s:  So we have a bit of an open agenda for today, although there's a couple of things that
23.56s:  I do want to hit on.
24.96s:  The first thing is some just kind of poking through the markets and doing a little bit of
30.36s:  a recap from a practitioner standpoint.
33.76s:  I think talking a little bit about some observations will likely be useful.
38.84s:  I also want to cover poking through Reddit just a little bit and using that as a vector
46.88s:  to take a look at what a lot of basic concepts being looked at are and things like that.
54.44s:  So we have a bunch of things to talk about.
57.48s:  So let's start with recapping the markets.
61.88s:  And so for the week, we obviously saw a pretty massive turn underway.
68.88s:  We saw tech really starting to accelerate to the downside.
72.80s:  We saw bonds starting to tick up, like equity.
76.04s:  Then we start to see IWM, small caps rotating over, cues rotating over and even the spy
82.48s:  now starting to rotate over.
84.60s:  So really, this is becoming a generally broad market movement that we're seeing.
91.60s:  Obviously, we are at the point now where this clearly is in at least at this point, a
98.64s:  correction.
99.64s:  If not starting to migrate even towards a bear market, not quite there talking about
104.44s:  cues specifically by the way.
106.76s:  IWM still hovering right around a correction and then spy is not quite there yet.
113.36s:  Spy is the last bastion of strength that to me is slowly, slowly looking like it is
123.12s:  rotating over.
124.68s:  So for NASDAQ, I see net highs lows negative with gross lows expanding.
130.96s:  And I see net highs lows across the New York stock exchange contracting massively.
136.56s:  Yesterday, it was at like 141 net and today it's 47 and gross lows is expanding.
143.44s:  So market breath doesn't look great here.
147.20s:  So the reason why I'm taking a minute to go over this with you all from again, a market
151.52s:  practitioner standpoint is because making observations in the market is part of our job
156.88s:  as traders.
157.88s:  That's what we do.
158.88s:  How we identify things that look interesting to us that we want to explore ideally trade.
166.76s:  That's how we make money by identifying things that look good.
170.88s:  So understanding the broad market in my perspective is a really, really important part of this
175.84s:  process.
176.84s:  I actually have, let me find it.
180.12s:  In the handy dandy notebook of all things options trading.
185.48s:  This thing, as I've mentioned a few times is starting to get a little unwieldy, but
189.68s:  I'll show you.
191.08s:  Let me see, maybe this one.
194.60s:  Yep.
195.60s:  So this is actually going to come out in a video soon, but this idea of like starting
200.56s:  from the top and zooming into the individual products is a really, really useful process.
208.72s:  So that's a quick recap of the markets.
211.04s:  We'll dive more into it.
212.04s:  But as you know, we got to grab the chat and we got to say hello to everybody.
215.16s:  We got to see who's hanging out.
218.04s:  And I also realize I have to turn the air conditioning on in my wall up.
222.00s:  It's already on.
223.00s:  I have to turn it up in the office because even though your boys in a tank top, it is pretty
228.52s:  freaking warm here in Southern California.
233.56s:  So what do we got?
236.08s:  I see we got threshold solutions.
238.28s:  That's a really cool name that sounds almost like somebody that clears rooms because we
242.88s:  would call a door during CQB.
246.00s:  We would call that a threshold.
247.80s:  So sounds like somebody that's really good at clearing rooms.
252.36s:  Maybe that's the case.
253.56s:  We got Liz hanging out.
254.64s:  We got Knight harm, Joe Tato.
257.92s:  Why not roaring Titi?
259.72s:  Everybody.
260.72s:  We got to give a shout out to roaring Titi is one of the greatest names on here.
263.68s:  So we made the stream.
264.68s:  I get confused which stream is which because the thumbnails all look so similar in so
268.84s:  many are scheduled ahead.
270.32s:  You mean I purposely go damn it roaring Titi.
274.76s:  I purposely go through the effort of even bothering with different thumbnails and different
279.60s:  titles and you get confused which ones which I'm out here bust in my ass all day trying
286.88s:  to make a nice home cooked stock market dinner and then you got to tell me it all tastes the
292.00s:  same.
293.00s:  This unbelievable.
294.00s:  This is literally unbelievable.
297.24s:  We also have Dr. Zayas Vladimir off Putin.
301.96s:  Vladimir says I sure wouldn't be shocked to see if or to see all after Fed cuts an election
308.08s:  uncertainty is resolved to see all after Fed.
317.36s:  To see all green after Fed.
319.52s:  Okay.
320.52s:  Sorry.
321.52s:  We needed that correction there.
322.52s:  Vladimir off Putin.
323.52s:  They made a way more sense now.
327.40s:  Yeah.
328.40s:  So I actually think that this idea of a soft landing is starting to look increasingly
335.44s:  tenuous.
336.44s:  That's my take because the market is very good at forecasting and when we look across
343.84s:  even the economic picture from the past week things aren't necessarily looking great.
352.32s:  So if we look at PMI from earlier in the week manufacturing PMI that came in a little
359.12s:  bit light manufacturing prices came in a little bit high.
363.12s:  That's not necessarily ideal job opening still came in a little bit light which I don't
369.52s:  really know anymore how the market's going to interpret that news.
373.24s:  Obviously the market didn't like most of what we saw this week services PMI came in a
378.76s:  little bit higher which I imagined Boads well.
383.72s:  And then so like as I look across the broader market from the past week there is a ton
390.28s:  of stuff that happened but there was one thing that remained the same.
395.00s:  The market essentially sold off the entire week.
398.84s:  Yeah, literally the entire week.
401.92s:  Roy Titty says I'm not hating.
403.64s:  I know you spend a lot of time on all this is just my way brain process.
406.32s:  Oh yeah.
407.32s:  I 100% joking.
409.44s:  Roy Titty.
410.44s:  There's like with the name with a handle like yours essentially there's you could do no
414.76s:  wrong in my eyes.
416.32s:  So yeah, you could you could pretty much insult me directly and I still wouldn't care
420.60s:  because I like the name too much.
422.48s:  It's completely joking.
424.16s:  But I mean that you're not wrong right like a lot of the branding is very similar.
428.48s:  That's obviously on purpose so that people know when they're looking at something of me versus
432.72s:  something else which I also I have to be honest.
435.12s:  There was a hilarious comment that I got not too long ago from somebody I did a video
443.28s:  this past week.
445.36s:  One of them was about something regarding roaring kiddie.
448.52s:  So I used him in the thumbnail and somebody was like really pissed about that.
452.32s:  They literally said that he should sue me because I used his picture and they thought that
458.56s:  the video was going to be his which bless their heart.
464.28s:  That's what I have to say just bless their heart.
469.04s:  Carlos says you ruined the stock market dinner.
471.52s:  Yeah, that's it.
472.52s:  You the family's fighting now.
475.28s:  Vladimir Putin says in January we would probably look back and now and think why didn't
479.04s:  I bounce?
482.52s:  I don't know.
483.52s:  I certainly don't feel that way.
485.12s:  But if you're an investor and you're really gun shy at entering into the market sure
489.92s:  I could see that.
491.40s:  But if you're a trader that's absolutely not how you look at the world, right?
498.04s:  Because there's still several months before the end of the year.
502.92s:  So the idea of not doing anything into the end of the year because of being gun shy.
507.80s:  Yeah, that's a problem.
509.20s:  But from a trader's perspective, the last thing I'm doing is loading up on a bunch of long
515.48s:  beta weighted delta's to the market to the broad market and just going to hold them into
521.80s:  next year until they start to turn that I think is a bit of a bit of a problem, right?
530.24s:  Because there's an opportunity cost to that capital and it to me it's some well not a
536.68s:  sunk cost.
538.04s:  But the opportunity cost there is enough that I wouldn't just park money waiting.
544.64s:  Now if you're an investor, nothing wrong with that.
548.36s:  That's completely completely fine for like a longer term perspective.
552.04s:  That's the name of the game of investing is maintaining long term exposure to right
555.96s:  out the bumps and whatnot.
558.20s:  So Zach Rij has made it in.
562.72s:  What up Reese's here as well.
564.12s:  Cedar Savage says time to pull out bearish strats for a few weeks.
567.24s:  Yes.
568.24s:  I actually think Cedar Savage you're behind the ball to be honest.
572.24s:  I don't think you're wrong, but I think one of the problem is depending on what you're
577.92s:  trying to trade.
579.32s:  If you're just now starting offering short delta's, it's still not too late.
584.72s:  I would argue, but they become higher risk entries.
588.72s:  And I've talked about this most of the week.
591.60s:  So for example, if I look across something like XLE, I've already had fades in XLE after
599.08s:  it started breaking out below this level, I actually added more today.
604.00s:  And I that that's actually one of the things I want to review today is I thought one of
609.48s:  the things we could do in the beginning of the video is actually take a look at some
615.44s:  sample trades and we can kind of reason through them together.
619.72s:  So there's two time frames I want to use.
622.08s:  I want to use today.
624.04s:  So as if we're trying to find a trade to put into a hypothetical portfolio today, I want
629.84s:  to do that process.
631.48s:  And then the other process I want to do is go back in time and on demand if it works and
636.56s:  see what kind of trade we would structure based on the information we have available.
645.48s:  So yeah, that's one of the things I want to take a look at today.
649.12s:  But first let's start with some simple stuff.
651.76s:  I want to take a stroll through options, the subreddit.
655.92s:  And I just want to use this as a way for us to test some different ideas.
662.04s:  So in case you guys didn't know for anybody that's wondering what's going on with Vladimir
666.60s:  off Putin is he says he has half the chat blocked from a week ago.
670.64s:  So I just want to let half of you know that Vladimir off Putin thinks you ain't shit is
676.60s:  essentially what I saw.
678.40s:  So yeah, anyways, just wanted to relay that message directly from Vladimir off Putin
684.52s:  to the rest of the chat.
685.52s:  I'm just the middle man here.
686.76s:  I can just see it all, but he's just letting you know his thoughts.
691.84s:  But anyways, let's Carlos goes that's very off Putin of you.
698.96s:  That might that I mean, it's on brand.
700.44s:  You got to get listen, you got to give credit where credit's due and credit is due there.
704.76s:  That's very that's I think it's right on point.
707.32s:  All right, so let's take a look through some of these.
708.92s:  I literally haven't read through them yet literally right before I started this I ran
713.28s:  through and I opened a few of them that I think would be good to cover.
719.08s:  So this one says bank manager convinced me options are for fools.
725.00s:  Let's see what they have to say.
726.36s:  Now again, the whole point of this segment and just in case you're new to this, what I'm
731.28s:  doing is I use Reddit, the option subreddit as a proxy for beginners.
738.52s:  I can see and understand how beginners are looking at the market by going to this
744.56s:  Reddit.
745.72s:  So why we go through this together is to take a look at other beginner concepts theories,
751.88s:  things that they're trying to grapple with because this is a series for beginners.
757.96s:  So I use it as a proxy.
760.28s:  That's why we go through these and I think there's value in talking about them together,
763.40s:  which is the goal.
764.76s:  So this person says when in looking for payments cross border, I don't care about any of this.
773.12s:  So I traveled.
775.12s:  Jesus, where's the fucking.
779.32s:  Okay, so the conversation went towards trading.
784.64s:  He's up like 50% and I'm down for the year on my options portfolio.
788.24s:  My stock portfolio is positive and fluctuates between beating the market 5% to underperforming.
794.28s:  On average, much more profitable stock trader, profitable trading options get greedy.
799.36s:  Yeah, see, I hate this.
803.64s:  I hate this so much.
805.36s:  So one of the reasons why I hate this so much is because when I see traders saying things
810.52s:  like I get greedy, it tells me a lot about their
814.40s:  understanding of their business.
816.64s:  And before we get too far, a quick cheers to you all with my mango orange and then a handful
822.92s:  of drugs.
824.16s:  So we got to get that a set of medicine down to keep functioning.
827.56s:  I don't know how.
835.20s:  Nothing like some to highlight on.
838.48s:  Really takes the edge off.
840.64s:  But so first off for you guys that are in the chat.
844.08s:  Especially anybody that's been around the community for a little while longer.
847.32s:  Why do I not like this?
848.44s:  Any ideas?
849.44s:  Why do I call out the idea?
850.88s:  It's just that I get greedy.
854.16s:  Talk to me.
856.20s:  Why would I not like that?
858.64s:  And let's get past the superficial responses of getting greedy is bad and yeah, of course.
869.16s:  Okay.
870.92s:  So Kevin and Jotato are hitting on one of the things I specifically want to highlight
876.40s:  is no plan.
878.48s:  Seater is actually, it looks like we disconnected standby.
884.60s:  Are we, am I still here?
888.36s:  It says reconnection successful.
892.48s:  I have no idea.
893.84s:  Am I currently not, not, not can you hear this?
898.04s:  Okay, good.
899.04s:  You guys can hear it.
900.04s:  Let me pop it off for some reason.
901.84s:  I actually have literally no clue.
904.84s:  Maybe somebody is doxing me or so.
906.40s:  I don't even know what that means.
907.40s:  I'm not going to lie.
910.24s:  All right.
911.56s:  So let's see.
912.68s:  The first one is the definitely no plan, right?
917.04s:  The prospect of being greedy during an options trader, really any trade, it tells us right
922.64s:  from the jump that you're going, you're not following something that makes sense.
927.76s:  And I'll show you exactly why that's the case in a few minutes.
931.24s:  So no plan is a big part.
933.44s:  There's a really, really, really important specific thing though that I want to highlight
940.16s:  from this.
944.44s:  And Seater says not mechanical.
946.04s:  It's not that.
947.04s:  I'm actually a highly discretionary trader.
949.68s:  I'm not mechanical.
951.32s:  There are absolutely bounds to what I do.
956.40s:  But I actually personally believe that a vast majority of the edge for retail traders
962.76s:  is discretion.
965.12s:  If you're too mechanical as a retail trader, that essentially means whatever you're doing
969.28s:  should just be automated.
971.12s:  And there's a reason why most of us don't automate everything.
975.12s:  And it's because there's not buckets of edge laying around like that.
979.96s:  Unfortunately.
980.96s:  It's not to suggest you can't automate anything.
982.64s:  Of course you can.
983.92s:  But there is a lot of value in being a good discretionary trader.
989.36s:  The reason why the idea of being mechanical as a trader is so well-touted is because
994.84s:  it sounds super smart, right?
996.24s:  You can't trust the trader.
997.64s:  So then just make it a repeatable strategy that you follow these specific rules.
1001.56s:  And then you take the trader out of the equation essentially.
1004.68s:  Well, guess who creates the edge in trading?
1008.80s:  It's the trader.
1010.20s:  So there's lots of ways to do that.
1013.00s:  And again, I would never say like, oh, being mechanical is dumb.
1016.32s:  Or like I would never say anything like that.
1018.08s:  But that's just the reason why I'm discretional in my trading.
1021.96s:  So just an important note there.
1023.96s:  So the plan is part of it.
1027.44s:  And then roaring titty and joteito are on the next part of it.
1034.72s:  There's, I'll get to the part I want to highlight first.
1037.24s:  And then we'll get into those.
1038.60s:  For roaring titty, I completely, completely agree.
1041.68s:  So for roaring titty and joteito, not setting a stop can help with this exact thing.
1047.96s:  So let's talk about that really quick.
1049.84s:  Let's say that we're trading stock XYZ.
1054.28s:  This one we'll talk about a little bit later because I have a position on actually in
1057.32s:  this to the downside.
1058.32s:  This was going to be an example of finding short deltas.
1060.52s:  That's like a current state example.
1061.96s:  But we'll get to that in a second.
1063.72s:  Let's take a look at Palantir.
1064.96s:  They joined the S&P 500 today that just jumped in my mind.
1068.28s:  So let's say we're trading Palantir to the upside.
1071.52s:  We think it's going to go up sick.
1072.92s:  Great thesis makes total sense.
1075.40s:  Let's say that you got in here and you're like, okay, I'm going to ride this up to whatever
1080.56s:  my profit target is and it's going up, it's going up, it's going up.
1084.56s:  And then you're like, oh, I wanted to go up higher.
1086.60s:  I wanted to go up higher.
1087.68s:  And then it goes down, down, down.
1089.56s:  And then let's say you're like, okay, well, I'm going to add more here because I like
1093.00s:  their earnings or whatever.
1094.60s:  And then it starts going up, up, up, up, up.
1096.52s:  So there are different bounds you can put on your trades.
1101.48s:  So for example, if you don't want to go through this cycle, you can say you enter your trade
1107.16s:  in here or whatever and it goes up, up, up, up.
1110.92s:  And then you can say, okay, when I enter here, my stop is going to be near term resistance,
1117.36s:  support in this case.
1118.68s:  Okay, great.
1119.68s:  It breaks through this next threshold and then it starts trending sideways.
1123.68s:  You're like, okay, if it falls and closes below this next support level, then I exit.
1130.44s:  So what I did is I moved my stop from there to there.
1133.68s:  This is how we capture profits and still let things move on the way up.
1138.16s:  So then you can say, okay, it's running up, it's running up.
1140.48s:  And then it starts trending sideways.
1142.12s:  Even if you choose again, to overfit, which that in a statistical terms means I know what
1148.48s:  happens in this sense because I'm looking at a historical chart.
1151.52s:  So if I wanted to overfit my strategy, I would say something like, oh, yeah, I'm going
1155.44s:  to put a move my stop up to here, but that's unrealistic.
1159.60s:  The probabilistic scenario here would be this would probably be the last stop that goes
1164.04s:  in.
1165.04s:  And then you essentially, I would run it from here, it would start rounding out and then
1169.72s:  I would get stopped somewhere out here.
1172.00s:  So then I do give up some of my profit, but in the process of attempting to let my profit
1177.76s:  run, I'm following it.
1181.12s:  So that's a really, really, really simple way to essentially set a trailing stop for your
1187.88s:  position.
1189.04s:  But that's not just based on an arbitrary percentage, although there's nothing wrong
1192.48s:  with those.
1193.48s:  For me, I like to support, I like to use support and resistance to essentially determine what
1199.44s:  I want to use, what makes the most sense for the position.
1202.56s:  So that's another thing.
1204.12s:  Here's the most important part right here.
1211.68s:  Just that I get greedy.
1215.08s:  Here's the problem.
1216.96s:  When we look at something like this, they think they've identified their problem.
1225.08s:  And my guess is they haven't.
1227.68s:  So this is really dangerous.
1231.00s:  It's really dangerous.
1233.00s:  The reason why it's so dangerous is because we think we're being enlightened.
1238.32s:  We think that we're being self-critical.
1241.00s:  We're really analyzing ourselves and we're even calling ourselves out for a bad behavior,
1246.52s:  which is really difficult, right?
1248.36s:  It feels like we're doing the right thing.
1250.00s:  It feels like we're being self-critical.
1251.36s:  Yeah, I'm being greedy.
1252.36s:  I'm not supposed to be greedy.
1254.20s:  The problem with this is very, very, very likely that there's way more wrong with their
1260.60s:  approach than being greedy, but they're not looking because they think they're greedy.
1264.92s:  And that's the problem that they're looking at.
1267.52s:  So what I'm highlighting here is that when we're analyzing our performance as traders,
1273.52s:  we have to analyze the total performance and then quantify our guesses, right?
1278.76s:  So like if in this example they give us a ton of different series where they were just
1284.64s:  letting their profits run and then they turn into losses, whatever it is, that would
1290.16s:  highlight part of the problem.
1291.60s:  But is it actually greed or is it that they're trading stuff that's going up and then down
1295.68s:  and doesn't actually follow the profit mechanism?
1298.80s:  So the point that I'm making here is that when I take a look at this kind of thing,
1304.96s:  I think it's so dangerous because they say it's just that I get greedy.
1310.68s:  We feel we've identified the problem and we probably fucking haven.
1316.36s:  That might be one of the problems.
1318.12s:  There's probably not the only problem, but we're not looking for other problems because
1321.52s:  we think we found the problem, which probably isn't the only problem.
1325.52s:  That's what I see here.
1327.76s:  So then it says once you start thinking about money, making plans as if it's a foregone
1331.72s:  conclusion, you profit tomorrow.
1333.52s:  Yeah, that's all just terrible, terrible psychology.
1338.52s:  He started pleading with me to stop trading options that it's a money pit.
1343.80s:  He says you could have traveled, married, divorced, lost, okay, whatever.
1348.72s:  Back on stocks, that's fine.
1352.80s:  You're winning or low.
1355.56s:  That's actually not correct.
1358.24s:  And when you lose, you have nothing to show for it.
1360.24s:  Yep, that's fine.
1362.04s:  Yeah, so here's the deal.
1364.48s:  When I look at this, I see somebody that is just filled, filled with disillusion.
1371.96s:  That's what I see.
1373.56s:  Because options and trading in general is not for most people.
1380.44s:  That's all there is to it.
1381.96s:  For the vast majority of people, they won't make money trading.
1385.48s:  It's not even trading options.
1386.84s:  It's trading in general.
1389.04s:  Options simply amplify what you're doing.
1391.68s:  So for example, if this person had some sort of approach that, let's say they were just
1396.92s:  trading to the long side, they were trading up.
1399.48s:  Their profit mechanism is up.
1401.72s:  If they were just trading up and they were really good at picking up, even if they used
1406.64s:  options or stock, they would still make fucking money.
1409.76s:  They would still make money.
1411.28s:  So this isn't options as a problem.
1413.68s:  This is a trader problem.
1416.36s:  Now the reason why their stock portfolio is doing well is because they're enjoying something
1422.36s:  called positive drift.
1425.12s:  The vast majority of the stock market goes up in the long run.
1429.40s:  So even though they'll go through periods where some of their stocks outperform, some
1433.00s:  of their stocks underperform and that's what leads to their variance in relation to
1437.20s:  the broader market, that's why that's working for them.
1440.24s:  It's not because there's some sort of great stock picker, because if they were some sort
1443.76s:  of great stock picker, what you're doing in options would work fantastic.
1448.20s:  So this is a prime time example of two things I want you to take away.
1454.48s:  The first thing I want you to take away is that this is dangerous.
1460.16s:  If you think that there are faults in your trading, we all have them.
1464.28s:  Do not relegate the performance to one single fault.
1468.76s:  It is highly unlikely to be the case.
1472.44s:  It's very likely that there are multiple things that lead into the problem set.
1478.08s:  The second thing is that options amplify whatever you're doing.
1483.68s:  So if you're trading, you have to start with the profit mechanism first.
1490.80s:  You'll hear me say that until I fucking die because I think all of us is options traders.
1496.40s:  We start looking at options and trading options before we even have a profit mechanism that
1503.12s:  works.
1504.96s:  Start with the profit mechanism, get something that works.
1507.84s:  Then whether you trade stocks, whether you trade options, whatever the fuck you trade,
1512.48s:  if you can reliably identify a profit mechanism, the rest are just tools that help you take
1518.64s:  advantage of it.
1519.96s:  So that is the point here.
1526.08s:  Evergreen says, is this guy teaching a course to morons?
1528.56s:  I'm way too advanced and experienced to listen to this.
1530.68s:  Been trading options for years.
1531.84s:  Please see something higher level.
1533.64s:  So evergreens, this is a great example of somebody who thinks that they're further
1538.84s:  along than they are because for somebody like you, I would highly recommend just like
1543.80s:  in trading, the Devils and the Details, I would read the name of the stream.
1548.36s:  Try that out for yourself.
1549.80s:  So what you'll notice is at the tail end of the title for the stream, it actually says
1555.04s:  options trading for, there's a very specific term in there.
1560.40s:  Beginners, that's who this is for.
1562.32s:  So not morons, that's not it at all.
1565.24s:  Beginners are people who simply are trying to learn something new.
1569.44s:  So they're starting point and how much information and background they have and something is
1573.12s:  going to be naturally lower.
1574.96s:  So that's why we're talking about these things.
1576.88s:  So yeah, I actually feel a little sad for you because if you can't read the title of
1583.76s:  the stream, it'll probably be really difficult to trade long term successfully.
1588.60s:  Again, Devils and the Details, but certainly wish you the best.
1592.60s:  So yeah, my guess is this stream is not for you.
1594.76s:  This is absolutely for beginners as it's been for the past.
1598.28s:  However many Fridays we've been doing this like two, three months now.
1601.44s:  So yeah, there you go, fam.
1605.56s:  Now back to the next one.
1608.12s:  Any questions on this one?
1610.32s:  Anything else, anybody else takes away that you think we should cover anything like that?
1615.40s:  Because again, like there's so much we can learn.
1620.76s:  Evergreen says guaranteed, oh, I'm not even going to read this.
1623.92s:  Actually, I'll do everybody a favor and then let's just, we're going to, we're going
1629.64s:  to have to do the children's game.
1631.56s:  Everybody.
1632.56s:  So evergreens, I'm going to put you in time out for five minutes and we're going to
1636.16s:  see if you can come back and play with the rest of the kids nicely.
1640.08s:  So let's, there you go, off you go, five minutes.
1645.56s:  If you can come back and behave normally, we would love to have you.
1649.92s:  But right now that's not what's happening.
1652.92s:  All right.
1655.92s:  Dr. Zase says all he deleted is comment.
1657.64s:  No, it's not him.
1658.68s:  So the, just to be clear, it doesn't, whenever you put somebody in time out, it looks
1662.96s:  like it deletes.
1664.36s:  I don't know, it doesn't delete all of it.
1666.36s:  It looks like, I don't know how much of their comments it deletes.
1668.60s:  Oh, it looks like all damn.
1670.64s:  That's actually kind of harsh.
1672.44s:  Oh, shit.
1674.44s:  Huh.
1675.44s:  I actually didn't know it did that for, for you guys.
1680.40s:  Can you see next to their name?
1682.08s:  Because for me, it says message deleted by outlier options trading and then it says view
1686.88s:  deleted message.
1688.08s:  So I can still click it and view the message.
1692.44s:  Huh.
1694.44s:  Learn a new shit every day.
1696.08s:  As I continue to remind everybody on these streams is I don't belong on any of these things.
1700.16s:  I don't know what I'm doing.
1701.48s:  I just like trading.
1702.96s:  That's pretty much where I'm at in my life.
1707.24s:  Roaring Titty says, did you put him in time out or did you ban him or him?
1709.84s:  No, I try to avoid that.
1711.32s:  I, yeah, I try to avoid that.
1714.20s:  So they're just in time out.
1715.28s:  I like to give people a couple chances because I feel like a lot of people just aren't
1719.60s:  used to dealing with people that will set thresholds and then hold the threshold.
1724.20s:  It's not really that complex, but it's just very militaristic.
1727.24s:  It's kind of like if you do X, this is what happens.
1730.28s:  If you don't do X, then you're good.
1732.88s:  So I try to give people a chance at that because I think they're used to like the civilian
1736.08s:  world where like you could show up five minutes late and it's okay.
1740.16s:  Nobody cares.
1741.16s:  Like that's not how it works in the military.
1742.52s:  It's like there's a fucking time you're supposed to be there.
1744.36s:  Be there before that time, ideally, at least at the very latest and fucking time.
1749.40s:  And then you're good.
1750.88s:  So that Lauren says he's gone now and my comment makes no sense.
1755.28s:  That's awesome.
1756.28s:  That's even better.
1757.28s:  I love that.
1758.28s:  Willie says sometimes people have a bad day too.
1760.08s:  Yeah, that's exactly it.
1761.08s:  And that's exactly why I try to give people a chance, right?
1763.52s:  We've had a couple people pop in the streams, especially the beginner stream for some reason.
1767.48s:  That try to come off sideways.
1768.96s:  And I do everything I can to let him hang out because some people are just at a shitty spot
1772.72s:  in their life genuinely.
1773.72s:  And I don't mean that like to cast down on them, but they're trying to find something to
1777.60s:  do that makes them feel better.
1779.56s:  So I try to let them hang out as best as I possibly can.
1782.24s:  I really, really do.
1783.76s:  But I wouldn't let people, you know, be disruptive or disrespectful to other people.
1788.72s:  There was actually somebody that we blocked because they were trying to talk shit about
1791.52s:  roaring titty, which we're just we're literally not going to have.
1794.48s:  That's just not going to happen.
1796.28s:  So yeah.
1797.68s:  All right, so that's this.
1800.80s:  Let's kill this one, move on to the next.
1803.24s:  And this is a great question.
1805.68s:  So does theta decay on Friday factor in the weekend already?
1811.12s:  It's a fantastic question.
1812.60s:  And I actually think most of you know the answer to this one.
1816.12s:  So take a look.
1817.12s:  This part, this is a great question for a beginner trader.
1819.40s:  They're saying do they lose $18 on Monday like theta decay and Friday is higher because
1824.52s:  accounts Saturday and Sunday.
1826.00s:  Do I lose $18 for Saturday and Sunday?
1828.04s:  So $36.
1829.80s:  So I don't know honestly what I'm looking at.
1832.84s:  I don't see where their theta is on this.
1835.44s:  It doesn't show me their theta.
1836.72s:  I'm assuming it's $18 per day.
1840.72s:  18 cents a day.
1842.04s:  That's kind of heavy.
1843.04s:  Let's double check that really quick.
1844.68s:  So this is a sts 23 calls.
1847.64s:  Let's take a quick look.
1848.64s:  A sts and let's pop over here.
1852.72s:  They're out in 13 set super short term expiration.
1857.48s:  And they have the 23 call.
1860.56s:  Yeah, damn boy.
1863.16s:  They had his 19 cents.
1864.28s:  They ain't fucking about.
1866.08s:  They're exactly right.
1867.68s:  So you guys tell me what's the answer to this question.
1871.92s:  Now let's be let's be let's keep it a buck.
1875.00s:  The first answer to this question is where the fuck is their battery power?
1880.40s:  The idea of posting a screenshot with literally 2% battery power is crazy to me.
1886.96s:  So I think we have to start with that and make sure that middle month 2097 is doing
1892.28s:  okay, because for to be in that kind of mental state to have 2% battery power at 12 56
1898.20s:  pm is fucking crazy.
1900.88s:  We need to get that I literally just bought a new watch.
1903.92s:  It's a dive watch, but my watch came with a power bank.
1908.40s:  So maybe we need I don't need the power bank.
1910.24s:  I think middle month needs the fucking power bank because this is nuts.
1914.36s:  12 56 no battery power.
1916.20s:  There's no outlet near you.
1918.28s:  This is crazy.
1920.80s:  All right.
1922.80s:  Harlow says don't they already factor in the weekend?
1926.80s:  Roryntitty says no, they don't factor it in.
1928.96s:  Oh good.
1929.96s:  So this one needs a poll hold on.
1931.56s:  We need a poll here since there's a bifurcation.
1933.96s:  All right, let's see.
1936.16s:  Theta decay impact.
1937.96s:  Hold on does theta?
1941.96s:  No does extrinsic.
1946.12s:  Value decay.
1951.12s:  Theta over the weekend.
1955.12s:  Yes or no.
1957.12s:  All right, there's a poll there for your viewing pleasure.
1960.92s:  I'm actually really curious because the comments obviously show a bit of a split.
1968.24s:  So far one hundred you say yes.
1971.04s:  Ah, there is the no.
1973.60s:  I see all right, we'll leave that open for just a couple of seconds.
1977.36s:  That's a great question.
1978.36s:  I actually really, really like that.
1996.60s:  All right, we got 17 votes.
1997.96s:  That's pretty good.
1999.36s:  So 18, leave it open for another couple more seconds.
2006.04s:  Go in once.
2008.72s:  Go in twice.
2009.76s:  Paul is ended.
2014.04s:  We had 72% say yes.
2016.84s:  And we had 27% say no.
2021.36s:  The yays have it.
2023.92s:  Theta does decay over the weekend.
2026.12s:  Now what a lot of people don't know is that theta decay over any time frame is not linear.
2035.08s:  So to their question of does theta decay on Friday, factor in the weekend already, it's
2041.32s:  actually a great question.
2042.40s:  And the answer is partially.
2044.80s:  So what will happen to them is as Saturday and Sunday pass, they won't lose $18 per
2052.88s:  day because a lot of this is actually factored into the clothes on Friday.
2060.20s:  And then there will be an adjustment on Monday.
2062.64s:  So the thing to know from this specific question that a lot of people don't know is that theta
2068.88s:  is not linear.
2071.16s:  It's not one day passes.
2073.00s:  You lose this exact amount of money.
2075.44s:  And it's not based on 30 seconds.
2077.36s:  You lose this portion of that amount of money.
2080.12s:  It's not linear.
2081.60s:  So market makers will essentially, Ryan says partially wasn't a poll option.
2089.04s:  Well because the poll option is specific, right?
2092.40s:  Does extrinsic value decay over the weekend?
2094.60s:  It certainly does.
2096.72s:  Extrinsic value does decay over the weekend.
2098.92s:  What I'm highlighting though is that it just doesn't decay linearly.
2103.04s:  So a lot of the theta decay will be factored into the clothes on Friday with the residual
2107.84s:  that comes out Monday.
2109.48s:  It's just not as discreet as theta in and of itself shows us.
2115.16s:  Theta is showing us stuff in a vacuum, right?
2117.44s:  So another great example here is, or do I lose $18 for Saturday and Sunday?
2123.84s:  So obviously here, they're looking at $18.
2127.88s:  If I look at their option, which we just shared together, theta is already at $19.
2134.04s:  So theta moves.
2136.68s:  Dr. Zay is says so it decays harder on Fridays and decays over the weekend, but not as hard.
2140.72s:  Yep, that's exactly the way to think about it.
2143.44s:  And it's not only on Fridays.
2145.72s:  So the way that this will work is over the Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, the weekend decay
2153.20s:  is already being amortized into the options, not just on Friday.
2158.04s:  It starts earlier.
2159.48s:  Because if they don't do that, people like me will know like, oh shit on Friday, they're
2164.04s:  going to decay out most of the weekend's theta before the weekend.
2167.92s:  I'm going to trade that.
2169.08s:  And then I have a great trade because I fade fall on Friday.
2173.08s:  I gammahed throughout the day.
2174.60s:  So I've no delta exposure knowing that essentially extrinsic value is coming out.
2179.56s:  And then at the end of the day, I cover my position.
2181.40s:  Don't make a ton of money on any one of those, but you can scale that easily.
2184.96s:  So that's why they start earlier.
2187.04s:  Because then I'm forced to expose myself to way more market factors as a trader.
2191.36s:  So it's not as linear as that.
2194.56s:  Roryntitty says they're going to lose more than $18.
2196.96s:  They may or may not.
2198.80s:  We can't tell yet.
2200.64s:  So again, the fact is, is that it just won't be a linear $18 per day as they're guessing.
2207.96s:  And again, this is a great question.
2209.64s:  So the takeaway from this one is that leading into a weekend, typically starting as early
2215.28s:  as Tuesday, but typically Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, market makers are going to start valuing
2220.76s:  the options in taking out an additional portion of theta to account for the weekend because
2225.88s:  a lot of these products don't trade over the weekend.
2228.28s:  So it accounts for that dead time.
2230.24s:  Now the trick here is that it still can move over the weekend.
2234.44s:  That's why it's not fully removed for the weekend because some news can come out about
2239.68s:  this individual stock that moves it on the weekend.
2242.60s:  And then as soon as the market opens on Monday, it flies.
2245.88s:  So this is a really great question.
2247.48s:  It's a bit of a technical question, which is why I think it's important for trade
2250.72s:  creators to know theta is not linear.
2253.80s:  Not only is it not linear in its overall decay profile, but the way that it's applied over
2258.96s:  the weekends in a smaller profile is important.
2261.80s:  So I'll show you this.
2264.60s:  So this shows you theta decay over different time frames, right?
2268.68s:  So you can see as you get close, this is you, oh, shit, I moved it.
2272.64s:  This is using at the money options.
2274.08s:  I also realized that I have my old logo and all of these.
2277.24s:  That's super frustrating.
2278.92s:  Don't love that for me.
2280.64s:  And I also realized that this isn't lined up with the other one.
2283.68s:  That's also annoying.
2284.68s:  Okay, that's better.
2285.68s:  All right.
2286.68s:  So now this is better.
2287.68s:  Anyways, you can see theta decay in and of itself day over day is not linear.
2291.56s:  And then week over week, specifically using the weekends, it's not linear.
2295.48s:  Now an even more important point here is for my options traders, specifically my vol traders.
2302.64s:  I'll show you a study because the weekend carry trade in SPX is something that I almost
2310.56s:  always have on to some degree.
2313.96s:  And you can hedge it with futures, which is fantastic.
2317.48s:  So let me see if I can find this study for you really quick.
2320.92s:  Again, because you should not take Eric's word for it, you should be able.
2329.84s:  This one would work overnight drifts.
2332.04s:  I want to see if I can find this specific weekend effect.
2336.60s:  Let me see.
2337.60s:  Sorry.
2339.32s:  I want to find this for you.
2340.32s:  So just give me a second.
2344.32s:  I try to provide as many source documents as I possibly can because nobody does that.
2349.48s:  And it's super annoying.
2351.28s:  But we're looking for something called the weekend effect.
2359.24s:  Monday effect.
2360.24s:  That's not it.
2362.40s:  This is just looking at anomalies and the non trading hours.
2365.96s:  I guess we can look at both of these really fast.
2369.40s:  And I'll throw links to both of these in the chat.
2372.48s:  Or this one.
2374.48s:  And then this one.
2376.64s:  And we're going to look at both of them together.
2380.16s:  Okay.
2381.16s:  Let's see.
2382.16s:  Dr. Zays says, wait, how does news affect theta?
2384.56s:  News doesn't affect theta.
2387.36s:  News can affect extrinsic value technically.
2391.12s:  But again, remember, the way that we use theta is perverse.
2395.12s:  We use it colloquially different than what it actually is.
2399.44s:  And again, when we're doing like these beginner sessions, I like to be very, very clear about
2404.88s:  these concepts just so that you understand.
2407.28s:  And then if we want to get lazy and use theta to represent time, that's okay, right?
2413.40s:  That's what most of us mean.
2414.40s:  But theta actually is time decay.
2418.48s:  That's what theta, it's a measure of time decay.
2421.64s:  Theta is a term is not time.
2423.84s:  We just use it for time colloquially.
2426.56s:  But theta in a technical sense is a measure of time decay.
2432.20s:  So the reason why news and stuff like that can indirectly impact theta is because it can
2439.60s:  impact the extrinsic value of an option by moving the underlying.
2445.64s:  But to the point of the question, theta in and of itself is not directly impacted by
2451.88s:  news.
2453.04s:  It's simply impacted as a result of the underlying moving and then intrinsic and extrinsic values
2458.58s:  sliding accordingly, yielding a different theta based on that.
2463.36s:  Let me know if that answers the question.
2467.88s:  Lauren says, I find that delta and theta really confusing makes me want to eat paste.
2471.64s:  I have a video for you then hopefully Greeks.
2476.92s:  I have a video that dives literally into all of the Greeks.
2479.96s:  It's like not super long.
2481.36s:  It's like 16 minutes.
2484.44s:  So this is for that Lauren, that video I just dropped and that video is literally all
2490.92s:  about the Greeks.
2491.92s:  I go through first or degree, second or degree, third or degree spend most of the time for
2496.72s:  first order Greeks because that's what impacts most people.
2500.40s:  And for those that don't know, the first order Greeks actually includes a second order
2504.76s:  Greek.
2505.76s:  We just often refer to it as a first order Greek.
2507.36s:  It's just kind of like a nerd fact that I don't really get a chance.
2510.48s:  Like if I tell my wife something like that, she couldn't possibly care less.
2514.16s:  So I have I'd share it with you guys.
2516.40s:  So fun fact.
2520.60s:  I'm essentially an encyclopedia of completely and utterly useless information.
2526.20s:  It's not necessarily something I'm super proud of, but it is what it is.
2530.92s:  All right.
2531.92s:  So we're through our first spin drift.
2534.64s:  We're moving over to our reserve watermelon, seltzer water.
2541.32s:  And we are ready to move on here.
2545.76s:  So here we go.
2549.20s:  So this is looking at non-trading periods, right?
2552.68s:  That's what this study looks at.
2554.68s:  And it says, we document the striking results that US equity premium over the last decade
2559.16s:  is solely due to overnight returns.
2561.88s:  The return during the night are strongly positive and returns during the day or close
2565.48s:  to zero and sometimes negative.
2567.24s:  This day and night effect holds for individual stocks, equity indices and futures contracts
2571.36s:  on equity indices.
2573.20s:  Night returns are consistently higher than day turns across the week, month and times
2577.06s:  of year.
2578.06s:  So this essentially is highlighting a really important function of markets that a lot
2582.80s:  of people don't know exists, which actually really surprises me to be honest, because
2587.88s:  it's nothing that's like revolutionary or complex, at least in my opinion, but you'll
2592.58s:  see this essentially everywhere.
2594.60s:  So I ran a study actually for the pro members, the Patreon members for the Outlier community.
2601.84s:  And I was essentially walking them through movements and SPX and how it breaks out throughout
2607.00s:  the day.
2608.36s:  So what I do is I like to look at products like this that I trade variance risk premiums
2612.12s:  in.
2613.12s:  I get how it moves for each 15 minute interval throughout throughout the entire day.
2619.92s:  So that I can see where the bulk of movement occurs.
2623.12s:  And in something like SPX, you'll notice if we look over any sort of significant time
2629.32s:  frame, a lot of the movements that you'll find happen within the first and last 15 minutes.
2635.56s:  Of course, this isn't always right.
2636.96s:  So this is a big move that's like an hour into the market.
2640.00s:  So it's not always 15 minutes, but very frequently the first 15 minutes and last 15 minutes
2646.32s:  of the market will be very busy.
2648.88s:  That's where we see overnight orders flooding in that we're resting.
2653.56s:  And then that's where we see everybody positioning for the next day.
2657.44s:  So you'll see a lot of active style traders like myself will favor the last hour of the
2662.96s:  day heavily and the beginning part of the day to be clear for like opening range breakouts
2666.56s:  and stuff like that.
2668.48s:  The big movement from overnight tends to come from pension funds and like these really big
2673.76s:  institutions that are just resting orders overnight to get hit on the next open.
2679.44s:  So you'll you'll find this trend holds over time with the vast majority of products.
2684.64s:  So that's essentially part of what this is identifying for you.
2689.04s:  Let me see Zacharias says, is it distracting to ask about holidays?
2692.96s:  Same right?
2693.44s:  No, it's not distracting at all.
2694.56s:  Dude, this is a completely open conversation.
2696.96s:  We talk about straight up whatever you guys want to dive into.
2701.68s:  Zacharias says holidays same, right?
2705.28s:  Yeah, exactly.
2705.84s:  So if we have an extended duration, technically speaking, there's even greater opportunity to capture
2711.36s:  various risk premiums from there because the market has to account for that additional time off.
2716.64s:  And again, non-trading periods tend to be really efficacious for stuff like that.
2720.88s:  The risk you run is if there's really terrible news that comes out, a war breaks out or whatever.
2725.12s:  And you get this massive gap on the open.
2727.36s:  But again, like for the way that I trade, I'll use SPX and then I can always hedge with the futures
2733.44s:  if something really terrible happens.
2737.92s:  Effectively creating a spread.
2740.48s:  So Zacharias, a fantastic question.
2743.20s:  Nothing wrong with that question at all.
2744.56s:  And it's completely the same.
2745.84s:  It changes the way that they essentially have to amortize theta.
2750.00s:  Great question.
2751.12s:  All right, let's see.
2752.64s:  Look at this one.
2754.56s:  Devidence shows that the size and effect, the weakened effect, dividend,
2758.64s:  and so let's open this one really quick.
2766.72s:  And then let's search for and actually give me one second because I have to have this paper
2772.80s:  downloaded and the fact that I couldn't find it makes me very angry.
2776.72s:  So I have to see if I can find this really fast.
2780.56s:  What's the name of this anomalies?
2787.28s:  I have every study.
2789.04s:  Okay, that's a lie.
2789.92s:  It's kind of dramatic.
2790.64s:  But I have most studies downloaded and in my Kindle, again, for those that are in the discord,
2798.08s:  you'll see me post both in the Patreon side and the reading list.
2801.52s:  We have a reading club.
2802.48s:  We'll just share the shit that we're reading.
2804.24s:  But then I'll also drop stuff like this in the beginner section of the discord.
2808.96s:  Is embarrassing as it is?
2810.40s:  This is what I read, man.
2812.48s:  Like this is the stuff that I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, but I love this shit.
2818.08s:  So anyways, this one's a little bit old.
2820.00s:  I think this one's from early 2000, but I think it still holds.
2823.12s:  Let's take a look for the weekend.
2825.84s:  It's the weekend.
2827.84s:  Yeah, 2002.
2829.04s:  The fact that I know that is also not great.
2831.44s:  Okay. So French 1980 observed another calendar anomaly.
2834.96s:  He noted that the average return to the S&P composite portfolios reliably negative over the
2838.96s:  weekends in the period of 53 to 77.
2842.40s:  The dependent variable is daily return to abroad portfolio stocks,
2845.84s:  short portfolio based on Dow Jones.
2847.92s:  So they're talking about essentially the drift over the weekends.
2851.36s:  And you can see the way that they estimate it.
2861.60s:  I don't know if they talk about volatility in here.
2863.52s:  They might not.
2865.12s:  I don't think they talk about volatility in here.
2867.04s:  My bad.
2869.60s:  That Lauren says I'm glad someone reads it for when we have questions.
2872.08s:  Yeah, and I get it.
2873.28s:  Like that's why I try to summarize a lot of these studies for you.
2875.84s:  I'll always provide the studies like this and give you a link to them and stuff,
2879.92s:  but I also understand that everybody was dropped on their head as a child and wants to read this
2885.04s:  shit. I do. And I do read it.
2888.72s:  But a lot of me are says many individual stocks reacting news and the SEC
2893.28s:  filings and almost all of this is disclosing extended hours when options trading is not possible.
2897.20s:  Yep, that's correct.
2898.64s:  That's absolutely correct.
2899.68s:  That's why that that's why that there's still extrinsic value assigned to non market or to
2905.92s:  non trading periods.
2908.88s:  My wife is texting me asking about dinner.
2911.20s:  So we got to see what we're going to order.
2913.76s:  I'm thinking, what do you guys think barbecue?
2919.60s:  I think barbecue man.
2920.88s:  barbecue sounds good.
2923.52s:  All right, so that's these.
2924.88s:  I think we can kill these.
2925.92s:  You have those.
2928.08s:  Let's take a look at this one.
2930.56s:  So we killed this.
2932.00s:  Here we go.
2934.96s:  Option volatility and pricing for the average Joe.
2937.76s:  I love options.
2938.72s:  I really want to learn options.
2939.92s:  And I've already got a few books on trading and essentials like options as a
2942.96s:  strategic investment.
2944.00s:  Shout out to you.
2944.64s:  Acceptable answer.
2945.60s:  That's that's an acceptable answer.
2947.76s:  But option volatility and pricing.
2949.12s:  This one scares me as a simple man.
2951.12s:  Followed three long Sherman background as a carpenter.
2953.68s:  Am I entering a world of paint?
2954.88s:  No, you're not.
2956.32s:  I had my strong maths in school, but that was 20 years ago.
2959.20s:  Should I take on math lessons to be able to wield and master options?
2963.12s:  So this.
2967.68s:  This I think doctors.
2969.84s:  As says you get barbecue every time.
2971.76s:  That's not true.
2972.56s:  I just get barbecue a lot.
2975.68s:  But not every time.
2976.80s:  Don't don't do me like that.
2981.68s:  Do Mexican a lot too lately.
2985.12s:  Dust to dust.
2986.40s:  What up?
2986.72s:  Good to see you.
2988.00s:  So what do we think here?
2990.40s:  You guys tell me have you guys read option volatility and pricing?
2993.68s:  And do you think it's required?
2995.52s:  Like do you think that the book has materially changed the way that you view markets?
3000.40s:  And you give your answer and then I'll give mine.
3003.04s:  But I think I have two versions.
3005.52s:  Yeah, I have paper version down here.
3009.52s:  Reese says I have not read it so I hope not.
3021.12s:  So here's said book.
3024.80s:  It is about 500 pages long.
3031.76s:  Yeah, about 500.
3033.68s:  And here's what I would say.
3040.08s:  I think well actually I can tell you exactly what I would say because
3045.52s:  I offer this to everybody.
3050.08s:  But everybody that doesn't know if you go to my website, if you go into resources,
3055.04s:  I literally have essentially a like a straight up guide for new options traders.
3062.48s:  It's just a Google sheet that loads in here, but it's also you can click into any of these.
3067.04s:  Actually, that's another quick question for you.
3068.88s:  As you look at this top box, would you think to click this or do you need this one here?
3074.56s:  Addic curiosity from a user's perspective.
3081.92s:  Vladimir says Chinese food is always great and keeps your body MSG levels.
3086.48s:  I actually don't disagree.
3090.96s:  Or Indian maybe.
3092.96s:  I'm kind of down for whatever.
3097.04s:  All right, dust the dust says top link.
3099.04s:  That Lawrence says bottom.
3100.08s:  Yeah, okay.
3100.48s:  So my instincts are correct to have both.
3103.68s:  Because I just expected people to naturally gravitate to either the titles
3110.32s:  and clicking or these, which is why I include both.
3114.08s:  Right, you can't.
3115.28s:  I think they're both right.
3116.48s:  So anyways, on this, if you go down to the bottom, you can take a look at options 101.
3121.68s:  This is what I consider to be the basics for options understanding options as a strategic investment.
3128.80s:  Option volatility, and pricing,
3132.32s:  advanced trading strategies and techniques.
3134.48s:  That's what this book is.
3135.84s:  This is literally the second book I would recommend to any options trader.
3140.80s:  So in my opinion, this is required text.
3144.24s:  That's what I say.
3152.56s:  Now, for this person,
3159.52s:  the problem, this is the problem with trading is people want an easy, simple solution.
3166.96s:  It's just not what you're going to find in markets.
3170.56s:  It's just not what you're going to find.
3173.28s:  It looks like Mel is down for barbecue or Indian.
3176.40s:  So you guys have to pick for us.
3177.52s:  Do we do barbecue or Indian?
3179.28s:  She's down for either.
3180.24s:  I'm down for either.
3182.40s:  So
3184.40s:  Jotato says I failed reading comprehension like every time it was tested through school.
3188.64s:  That's cool, man.
3189.28s:  That's back in school.
3190.08s:  That's old you.
3191.12s:  You're now new you.
3193.52s:  Everybody says Indian.
3194.48s:  All right, Indian it is.
3195.52s:  I'm down for some Indian.
3200.00s:  Oh, damn, Willie, throwing the, I tell you what, Mexican sounds good too.
3206.48s:  Damn it, Willie.
3209.52s:  You're kind of doing me dirty here.
3212.40s:  Let's see.
3218.48s:  Damn it.
3220.32s:  Oh, I actually think I'm going to do Italian.
3224.16s:  I'm going to throw a complete curveball at Mel.
3226.08s:  She's going to be like, what the fuck are you sending me?
3229.28s:  But I had Italian ready to go before.
3231.84s:  So it looks like that's what I need in my life.
3235.44s:  I've got to follow the body.
3237.28s:  So
3241.44s:  in my opinion,
3244.40s:  I think this is required reading.
3246.40s:  The reason why I think it's required reading is because it goes deep into detail
3251.76s:  on how markets behave, how market makers behave.
3256.64s:  Damn it. She doesn't want to tell you.
3261.76s:  So it looks like we got to do Indian.
3263.44s:  I had a feeling going for that curve ball was not going to, was not going to float well.
3269.76s:  Maybe maybe I'll see if she's cool with Mexican.
3273.60s:  This is actually hilarious.
3286.16s:  All right, we're doing Indian.
3287.12s:  She doesn't want Mexican either.
3290.40s:  I feel like Indian is a good choice.
3292.00s:  I have no regrets with some solid Indian.
3301.44s:  Dustin does says Eric, that's the second book.
3303.68s:  You 100% recommend what's the first options as a strategic investment.
3308.08s:  That I think is probably the easiest book for most people to pick up and start learning about
3314.00s:  options. It's not quite as technical as what you will find from option pricing and volatility.
3324.16s:  But it is a little, I don't want to say it's a little heavy.
3328.64s:  Like there's parts in it that can be tricky.
3331.20s:  But in general, I think it's, it's pretty reasonable.
3336.08s:  Damn. So now I don't know if I want chicken beer, be a reenie, beer, Ronnie.
3341.52s:  Or if I want like butter chicken, shit.
3349.28s:  Doctors, days, don't you dare hit me with that joke.
3352.24s:  I love that joke. That's probably one of my favorite jokes on earth.
3360.96s:  I won't steal it from you though, because somebody else might ask you what,
3366.00s:  and it's very fun to be able to answer that.
3368.48s:  So I won't steal it from you.
3371.28s:  I don't have that in my heart.
3373.28s:  Such a good joke, especially if you can get somebody new with it.
3376.16s:  God, that's great.
3379.76s:  All right. So I'm doing butter chicken and garlic non.
3383.12s:  That will be the, that will be the, the movement.
3386.48s:  All right. Back, back over to this.
3393.04s:  Damn, she's quick out here.
3395.04s:  Vladimir Offputin says, as a new options trader, I have a separate account funded by a lucky trade.
3400.88s:  I have named entertainment. I just don't have confidence or knowledge to risk my money just yet.
3405.44s:  I think that's okay. I think of Vladimir Offputin. For you and that, I would think about paper
3410.80s:  trading. Like literally, I have a video coming out in not too long.
3417.36s:  I think not this week, but next week.
3419.76s:  This is a video that's coming out tomorrow. I actually have to download this.
3428.40s:  But yeah, I have a video that's coming out that explicitly is going to be about this exact thing.
3436.48s:  And paper trading, because I genuinely believe paper trading is such, such an incredible,
3444.56s:  such an incredible tool for that exact thing that you're talking about.
3447.84s:  Vladimir Offputin. But I think that you have to, you have to think about what you're trying to
3454.08s:  accomplish. And then essentially treat your trading account like that. That's what I think.
3463.76s:  Roing Titty says, what's the answer to the joke? It's above Roing Titty. It's a fantastic,
3468.16s:  that's like literally one of the best jokes I think somebody could have.
3471.92s:  Yeah, I literally, my poor wife probably has heard that joke more times than anybody really
3481.68s:  deserves to hear it. But it is, it's just so good. It's just so good that I can't, I don't know,
3491.36s:  it's fantastic. So for those that didn't get a chance to enjoy it, make sure you read the punch line.
3497.76s:  So back to this. Yes, I think it's required. No options trading is not easy. No, it's absolutely not
3505.04s:  for everybody. That's kind of, that's just kind of how it goes. So when I think about,
3515.68s:  when I think about what I think works best with learning to trade options, it's a mix of
3523.52s:  fundamental understanding of theoretical concepts. And then it's starting as fast as you can
3529.84s:  on the more complex components. So things like how to take the theoretical components and then
3542.56s:  use them live. That's really not easy. And I think a lot of people struggle pretty hard with
3549.04s:  that exact process. But to me, that's kind of really where that entire process comes together
3555.84s:  because you can be super, super, super, theoretically sound, like completely theoretically sound.
3562.32s:  And then you can not understand at all how to actually trade. So to me, you kind of have to have
3570.32s:  a really strict balance of both. That's my overall thought.
3574.00s:  A lot of me are off-put and says I've tried paper money, but feel that I'm reckless there. To me,
3580.48s:  that highlights a massive discipline issue. That is, it's showing you upfront a problem that is
3588.96s:  there. There's a massive problem with that. If you are that kind of person and you're not alone,
3594.96s:  lots and lots of people are like that. But if you are that kind of person, that's like,
3599.44s:  man, I just can't take this seriously because of X, Y, Z reason. That is absolutely going to come
3605.84s:  out to bite you in the end no matter what. Like that problem is going to show up in another way.
3612.56s:  If you don't take care of that problem. So paper trading again is giving you a fantastic pre-emptive
3619.36s:  heads up that you have a problem of some sort. And again, I'm not saying that you have to
3624.40s:  fully treat paper trading as if this is your livelihood and stuff like that. But if you can't
3632.08s:  take paper trading seriously, then the probability of you being able to take trading as seriously
3639.36s:  as you likely need to is actually pretty low, in my opinion. So that's at least the way I look at
3648.16s:  it personally. And I hope it's not the case, right? I'm not saying that to wish it on anybody.
3654.56s:  But I think that that is my general instinct towards that kind of thing in the beginning.
3660.72s:  Because you'll find people will say that all the time. And I literally can tell
3666.80s:  for those kinds of people the problems that they're going to have based on that kind of behavior.
3676.16s:  Zacharias says, well, recognizing the problem is better than most. I agree. I completely agree.
3680.00s:  So let's talk about that. Let's talk about that exact thing. Again, I have a video that's
3683.36s:  coming out next weekend on paper trading. So you guys talked to me. What are some of the ways
3694.56s:  then if at least I think paper trading is important? It doesn't mean that it is super important.
3700.40s:  But if I think it's important, what are some of the reasons why you might think that I think
3704.48s:  it's important specifically in terms of how can you adopt it if you identify with yourself as
3711.04s:  I have a discipline problem? I'm not doing a good job treating this as real money. How can we fix that?
3724.96s:  Any ideas? That Lauren says I started with paper trades and small stocks. So it didn't hurt so
3731.12s:  badly. I did well with so if I yeah, that's really solid, right? That's starting small. I think
3736.00s:  that that's fantastic. That's a really, really great approach, I think.
3743.68s:  All right. It looks like no ideas are necessarily jumping out so we can hit this together.
3749.92s:  Where he says I reduce the size of the cash. That's okay.
3754.40s:  Change the money to percentages. That's kind of for sizing, which those are good ideas for sizing.
3760.00s:  So here's what I would tell you. If you're the kind of person that's coming into paper,
3764.64s:  like I give this example all the time, I'll tell you right now, I'll look at my log right now.
3773.60s:  I have to go to my data tab. Okay. How many paper trades do you think I have on right now?
3781.84s:  I am a full-time trader. I've been trading for almost 17 years now.
3791.04s:  How many paper trades do I have on right now?
3795.28s:  Vladimir says I've made hundreds of thousands on individual stock trades, but the clock ticking
3799.04s:  with options is big difference. It is, but it's not. Again, like if you're making that kind of
3805.76s:  money with trades, then you probably have a profit mechanism that works. And again,
3813.12s:  like we were talking about before, if you have a profit mechanism that works, options are just
3817.04s:  going to amplify it. They're not going to hurt it. They'll hurt it if you don't know how to use
3822.80s:  option. But they're not inherently going to hurt it. Okay. So Elon Song says 10,
3834.32s:  Dr. Zeyes says more than 10, that's a great guess. Willy says 20. Rhee says 100. I'm taking the
3839.68s:  over and Rhee's would be the winner. Right now, I have 1,087. 1,087 paper trades on. I have them split
3852.24s:  into three different segments. There's what I call a portfolio mirroring segment.
3860.08s:  That looks at my portfolio as it is with slightly different permutations. So rather than right now,
3870.88s:  essentially shorting things like energy, I'll short something else that I also think is weak
3877.36s:  and I'll run them simultaneously in compare notes.
3881.92s:  Roryntady says like currently or over the life of your trading career, literally right now.
3885.52s:  Like that's what's on this second. So Rhee says, do I get an internet trophy? Yeah, I actually
3894.00s:  think that that's fair. I will I will award Rhee's gets plus one fake internet point. I got to
3906.48s:  find my little trophy. There it is. Good call, Rhee's. Rhee's gets plus one fake internet point.
3915.04s:  So I have that first segment that's mirroring slight variations to my portfolio. I have a second
3922.24s:  segment that looks at a completely different portfolio structure. So I'm essentially testing
3928.80s:  an alternate portfolio that has a completely different disposition to what I have. I use things
3933.84s:  like the core allocation and the speculative trades in that portfolio to essentially show me
3940.32s:  other elements that might be contrary to what I think. So for example, right now I'm still
3945.12s:  long deltas and I have a lot of short deltas overlaid. However, when I look at the portfolio itself
3954.48s:  net net, there's still some long deltas. So in my second kind of segment, I'm looking at an
3960.40s:  alternate portfolio that's primarily short deltas right now and has a little bit of long deltas,
3966.08s:  kind of the inverse of what I'm doing. And then the third one is variations of literally all
3972.88s:  of the strategies that I run regularly. That's it. So by doing this, I'm able to test live
3982.96s:  information because as you all know, I like to look at data, I'll back test, I'll forward test.
3989.76s:  But even in the process of back testing, I know and can recognize that even subconsciously,
3995.84s:  there is back end processing that's happening that's tainting the results of what I'm doing that
4001.36s:  I don't want to happen. So one of the ways that I combat that is by having all of these different
4006.96s:  paper trades on at a given point in time to allow me to collect raw data based on what I don't
4011.52s:  know is going to happen. I have no idea what's going to happen over the next week. So that's why I do it.
4018.48s:  So the way that I would encourage a newer trader to take paper trading seriously,
4025.60s:  is I would do something like this. I would show them this.
4034.96s:  And then I would say, let's say you're starting at $5,000, let's say that you're able to save
4040.72s:  on average $1,500. Let's say you're going to look over 20 years. And let's say that we're starting
4047.84s:  with a 10% return. Well, what would I get if I have an 11% return? Well, in that same time frame
4058.80s:  at an 11% return over this 20 year time frame, I go from 1.06 million to 1.2 million. So it's $200,000.
4068.80s:  That doesn't sound like super life changing or crazy. Okay. But then let's fast forward this
4074.80s:  out to 30 years. Now what is this turn into? 1% variance between this 10% and this 11%
4081.84s:  1% variance takes me from 3 million to 3.7 million. $700,000 over the same time frame for one
4092.80s:  fucking percent difference. I care about that 1%. I care about that 1%. So this isn't like some
4099.60s:  magical big return. This is literally the difference between 10 and 11%. But that 1% over a long
4108.00s:  enough time frame is massively impactful. Now this becomes even more important. Let's say that you
4115.52s:  have a really good return. Let's say that you return on average 22%. Let's take a look at what 22
4122.00s:  versus 23% is. You go from 33.7 million, 33.8 million to 41 million dollars.
4133.52s:  That's from 22% to 23%. I care about the one fucking percent. In this example over a 30 year time
4143.60s:  frame, it's almost 10 million dollars. I care about that. I absolutely care about that.
4154.56s:  So for me, paper trading is a way to accomplish two things. There are two primary purposes of paper
4163.12s:  trading. The first one is for new traders to avoid this. If you're a new trader and let's say that you
4175.36s:  have a 40% drawdown on your account, after that 40% drawdown, you now require a 66.7% recovery
4189.60s:  in order to get back to break even. You need a massive, massive recovery in order to get back to
4200.72s:  break even. So when you're a new trader in my opinion, the game is not trying to turn a small
4210.96s:  account into a big account. As annoying as that sounds, it's simply so unlikely to be the case
4219.52s:  that we're going to take a really small amount of money and turn it into a massive sum of money.
4226.56s:  Not impossible, but it's insanely improbable. So in the beginning, the point of trading is to not
4235.52s:  lose a bunch of money and then start having to run uphill. That's the point. It's to learn the
4243.20s:  skill set without burning a shit ton of money, learning it. Paper trading helps you with that exact
4252.16s:  thing. So for the beginner paper traders, I would literally frame it as I am building the exact
4261.60s:  skill set that I'm going to use and rely on for myself to hit my financial goals.
4272.80s:  That's the point of paper trading. So if you look at paper trading and you can't take it
4277.60s:  seriously, you literally can't take your fucking future seriously. You don't care that much.
4282.96s:  That's all there is to it. Now I'm not saying everybody has to paper trade ad nauseam.
4287.52s:  I'm just saying that if you find yourself in the bucket that you just can't take it seriously
4291.52s:  at all, that tells me that there's a psychology problem factored into this thing. So that's what I
4297.68s:  would tell to the new paper trader. Now for the non-new paper trader, experienced traders like myself,
4305.04s:  I use it for data. I use it for data collection. So for me, the new paper trader, the entire goal
4313.60s:  for a brand new paper trader is essentially to trade that paper trading account as close as
4321.36s:  humanly possible to how you think you're going to trade your real money. That's the goal.
4327.68s:  And then for experienced traders, your goal is to see how can you learn and enhance your strategies
4335.92s:  to get that 1% that I just showed you is so important. That's the goal for experienced traders.
4345.52s:  So that's what I think. If you are a paper trader and you're struggling to take it seriously,
4353.20s:  I would just take a little time zoom out and think about what you're trying to accomplish and what
4358.48s:  paper trading allows you to do. Because I genuinely believe if you get to the point where you can take
4364.00s:  that more seriously, I mean, damn, it's so powerful of a tool that just for whatever reason,
4371.92s:  so many people have a hard time latching onto. And I sort of get it. It's boring if you don't
4379.28s:  think about it in that context. But it's like the same thing. I tell people about like military
4384.88s:  training. If the only way that I was able to train in the military is by essentially
4392.32s:  going only to combat and that's the only time I can learn. There's going to be a lot of
4397.92s:  dead motherfuckers if that's the only way I can learn. So that's my thought. A little bit of a long
4405.04s:  soliloquy about things. But the reason why I think it's important to like really dive into that is
4410.48s:  because I think taking it seriously literally can be life changing. And I think a lot of people
4418.08s:  sell themselves short not doing so. That's what I genuinely think. So that's that. Now there's
4425.04s:  a couple other things that I said I wanted to look at with us. So I vote we now pivot onto some of those.
4433.52s:  Any questions though about the paper trading thing. I'm hopeful that that even like generally
4438.00s:  makes sense to us. Because that's why again, like that's why I bring it up is because I think that
4443.84s:  at least a usable a usable data point in two different ways. Whether you're a new trader trying not
4451.28s:  to lose money but learn the skill set or if you're an experienced trader that's trying to make a lot of
4455.92s:  money. Dust to dust says make it more interesting. Put 10% of your paper trading profits into your
4463.44s:  cash account. I love that. I think that's a good idea.
4465.52s:  A lot of me or Putin says are you more aggressive when playing cod than in real life same to me
4475.12s:  when paper trading. Yeah, but again, you can't compare those because if I'm training in real life
4483.92s:  for what I do in real life, I take that deadly serious. If I'm playing a video game where it's
4490.80s:  very purpose is for entertainment. That's the only reason why we play Call of Duty or any of these
4495.28s:  other games is for entertainment. Of course, I don't take it that seriously. I know I'm going to
4500.16s:  respawn, but that's not what this is. I'm not talking about I don't get to respawn my capital.
4508.00s:  If I have a 40% drawdown, I need 66.7% positive return to get back to break even. There's no
4515.92s:  respawn. I don't get to just come back. So when I look at something like this, I actually wouldn't
4521.84s:  equate it at all to a video game that's entirely predicated on leisure. I would actually equate it far
4530.00s:  more to real life training for whatever it is that you're going to be doing whether it's going to
4536.08s:  combat or whatever it is. Just a more real life practical application, I think is the broader point.
4541.84s:  That's my opinion. Zacharias says trade trade train hard play easy. Yeah, well,
4551.36s:  that's actually another funny thing that I'll remind traders of all the time is that the actual
4556.24s:  process of trading is about as easy as it gets for me. And that's not hyperbole. It's really not.
4563.84s:  Trading in and of itself is easy for me. And the reason why it's easy is because everything else
4571.52s:  that I do to lead up to whatever it is that I'm trying to build the skill set up. So in this case,
4579.28s:  trading, I do all of the work ahead of time, all of the work ahead of time.
4587.92s:  So then in this case, it's just another day of doing what I know I need to do inherently.
4595.52s:  So all of the work for me in trading is done ahead of time and trading in and of itself.
4601.84s:  Does not need to be a difficult process in my opinion. But all of the work to make it not a
4608.48s:  difficult process has to be done before you start trading. Paper trading helps a lot with that.
4617.44s:  Reese says is S&P inclusion a tradable event. Yeah, definitely. Sorry, I didn't realize that you
4622.40s:  had asked that before. That's my bad. But yeah, Reese. So things moving within the S&P 500 is
4629.04s:  absolutely a tradable event. They tend to exhibit drift over a set follow on period. And you
4636.16s:  can actually look at the there's a study on it. Let me see if I can find it really quick.
4644.16s:  That's from a market in efficiency book. But I wonder if SSRN has something on it.
4651.28s:  And then I need to press send on this order.
4659.44s:  All right.
4660.24s:  The order is off the door.
4670.40s:  And then let me see if I can find this. Maybe easier to search studies.
4680.40s:  On stocks being added.
4689.76s:  So this isn't the study I was looking for.
4699.12s:  But this is let me see.
4706.00s:  I think this is the one I was thinking of. Yeah, this is the one.
4710.64s:  So there's two studies that I believe you can reference.
4715.84s:  The first study here is talking about again, like the actual reference effect.
4725.52s:  And then this study essentially is just summarizing it.
4738.56s:  Let me know if that makes sense.
4745.20s:  So this one, if we take a look together,
4752.88s:  you'll see a few things. I think that kind of point out to me.
4756.96s:  The main thing is that things being added to the S&P 500 typically
4762.64s:  see some sort of movement post being added.
4766.24s:  So you can see increases in the share values. But you'll see that the data itself is slightly
4773.44s:  mixed. And that's why I think this study is a good one to read.
4778.64s:  So we can go down, we can just read the conclusion together really quick.
4787.68s:  The S&P 500 index has no permanent effect, right? And I want to emphasize that specific line
4794.88s:  permanent effect because guess what? As traders, we don't care about permanence.
4801.12s:  That's not what we're trying to trade. I'm not trying to trade the permanent effect of something.
4806.40s:  I'm simply trying to trade the effect. So the fact that it's not permanent,
4810.48s:  I don't care literally at all about what I care about is, is it something that's
4815.60s:  tradable, which it absolutely is in the short term? So I think as long as you have a logical
4821.44s:  approach in terms of when you put the positions on them for what duration, I think it makes a ton of
4825.68s:  sense. Vladimir Putin says again, add a test, P500 after hours,
4830.56s:  when options were not traded, that doesn't matter. It's not an overnight effect. It's not
4835.28s:  something that's going to come and go today. It's more of a momentum effect. It takes time
4840.56s:  for it to be priced in. So yeah, it doesn't matter that options weren't trading tonight,
4846.64s:  or on the on Pound tier. It'll be completely fine.
4852.08s:  It's something that you can trade over a duration. Yeah, don't sweat that.
4861.44s:  All right. So let's close that out, close that out, close that out.
4865.76s:  That was a good one. Let's see if there's anything else that we want to grab from this real quick.
4872.24s:  Let's get this over. And let's see.
4882.40s:  Doctors A is so astradable would make sense. That kind of is more, well, it depends.
4887.44s:  For me, I would probably play more so the positive drift myself.
4891.68s:  But if you, if for whatever reason, you felt that there was a higher probability of,
4898.24s:  just movement in either direction and you couldn't, you know, you don't have an assessment
4902.32s:  on which direction. Then yeah, I think it's fine to use astradal. But that's kind of the
4907.20s:  purpose of it. But for me, that's not the way I look at it personally.
4911.92s:  All right. This one looks like a good one for us. We read through that one.
4917.76s:  Let's talk about this one because I think there's some problems here.
4924.08s:  And then let's look at this person's blind spots. All right. So this one talks about earnings
4929.68s:  crush. It says they've seen a lot of references to IV crush during earnings that lower in options
4934.96s:  contract value. But what really happens during earnings that leads to IV crush?
4940.48s:  All right. So you guys talk to me. What do you guys think about this?
4948.80s:  What really happens during earnings that leads to the IV crush? What happens?
4962.80s:  Binary event concludes, yeah, I got to be more specific than that though.
4966.56s:  So no plus fake one internet point for that. I consider that a partial answer.
4978.00s:  The news is out there. Hype is over. That's better.
4980.72s:  Rowing titty is moving us in the correct direction. So
4986.72s:  risk gave a more holistic answer. But I think roaring titty beat them to it. So roaring titty.
4992.24s:  There you go with plus fake one internet point.
4998.48s:  Willie says IV crush is elevated extrinsic value of the surge in demand in options near earnings.
5005.44s:  And once past earnings you get crushed, that's not exactly correct actually. This is good.
5009.68s:  I'm glad we're talking about this. G36 says the market is pricing in larger move from the
5015.76s:  earnings afterwards the expectation is gone. Yeah. So G36 is also also correct. So G36 you also get
5027.12s:  plus fake one internet point. So I think your response expounded a little bit on the effect.
5032.56s:  So here's what's going on. Before earnings, let's find something that has earnings. Let's do
5042.88s:  APLD somebody threw that in the chat before. So we'll take a look at that. So APLD had earnings.
5048.64s:  Leading into earnings, we don't know what's going on. We do know that there's going to be new
5057.52s:  information critical to the valuation of a stock. We know that that is going to come out with
5063.92s:  certainty that's going to be here. So that leads to a heightened expectation of implied
5071.60s:  movement. We know information is coming out that can move the stock. That then means we expect
5079.28s:  movement of some sort. So leading into earnings, the expectation for implied movement is relatively
5086.16s:  high. So we're getting information that can move the stock. Once that information is released,
5092.40s:  it is then priced into the stock. That's why if you go through something like this, you'll see
5102.00s:  the orange line is implied volatility. Notice how the orange line is downward sloping,
5111.84s:  typically through earnings, not always, but typically through earnings will be downward sloping.
5119.12s:  So that simply means that the implied move based on the information is factored in. And now we
5126.80s:  do not expect as much movement. Now the second question that they had that was a great follow-up
5132.16s:  question is, is it a guarantee for stock options to have a crush on earnings? What do you guys
5140.24s:  think about that? Is it a guarantee? It's another fantastic question. You tell me.
5147.68s:  Dr. Zay is says, Crush happens when the unknown becomes known. That's good.
5156.80s:  Willie says depends on the news. Willie is correct. So Willie,
5166.08s:  G36 says IV will still decrease, but if the move is larger than the delta can make up for it,
5171.36s:  that's incorrect. G36. Elon's song says no guarantee. So Elon's song also gets one.
5178.96s:  Reece says yes, that vowel will decrease, but delta can easily overwhelm that not necessarily.
5185.12s:  Tommy also got it right. Dr. Zay has also got it right. So two, three, four trophies.
5196.24s:  Plus fake one in an appoint to those four. Now this is one of those things that again, the devil is in the details.
5211.28s:  Is it guaranteed? No. Is it probable? Yes. The vast majority of instances you will see
5221.12s:  implied volatility contract through earnings. In this instance, after earnings, it went up.
5228.16s:  This is the day before earnings. This is the day following the release. So in this case, it went up.
5236.08s:  It seldom the case, but the reason it can go up is if there's a terrible or a big piece of
5242.72s:  information that just wasn't expected, and it causes even more expectation of movement.
5249.60s:  That's exactly why you'll see it go up again. Sometimes the overwhelming trend, however, is that it
5259.28s:  typically will go down. Overwhelming trend, but not always. And to this person's question,
5267.36s:  certainly not guaranteed. When does it happen? Another great technical question. So when we get
5275.92s:  this earnings crush, temporally, when does it happen? Busy blends says, I mean, 90% of the time,
5284.32s:  Ivy does pump when earnings is near. That's also correct. I wouldn't say 90% of the time,
5288.72s:  because I don't know if that's accurate and I don't like giving bad data points like that.
5293.44s:  But I can tell you over 50% of the time, aka the majority, Ivy will expand starting two weeks
5301.60s:  out leading into earnings. So nothing wrong with that. But you guys tell me, when does it happen?
5308.72s:  So we know that Ivy tends to decline, okay. But when does it, when does it typically happen?
5317.68s:  Anybody have any ideas?
5318.56s:  After the release, that's a fair point. Need a little more specific than that.
5337.04s:  Tommy says, when earnings come out after the call, that's moving in the correct direction.
5342.32s:  Reese is the closest so far. G36 is wrong.
5353.60s:  I would say Tommy and Reese are the most close.
5362.32s:  So Tommy and Reese, you guys get close fake one at an point.
5366.88s:  I gotta get my little trophy out. There we go.
5373.84s:  Busy took the under the null hypothesis, says before earnings, which is incorrect as well.
5380.56s:  Zacharias says, right before the call from what I see, that's also not the case.
5386.48s:  Tommy says, can I convert my points to Bitcoin? Potentially. Yeah, you'll have to see how you
5390.96s:  redeem them. But yeah, I think you're more than welcome to convert to any of your preferred
5396.80s:  denominations. So the period in time in which it actually moves is not going to be immediate.
5408.80s:  The period in time for the Ivy Crush, I don't like calling it Ivy Crush to be honest,
5413.04s:  just because it's kind of like a beaten down phrase. I don't really like it.
5417.60s:  So I just, I don't know, I guess a slight pet peeve. But let's see if we can find something
5423.52s:  that recently had earnings. Let's do. I think one of these, yeah.
5434.40s:  This is earnings within five days.
5441.52s:  Oh, I forgot. We never finished fixing this fucking scan. Damn it.
5447.60s:  Let me see if this does it. So this should be looking for stuff with earnings in the past couple
5457.20s:  days. Yeah, okay. So that at least worked. Let's take a look here. I, O, T, let's take a look.
5471.04s:  Let's, let's, let's, let's just, let's just, let's just move. Oh, yeah, because this is too
5479.12s:  short of a timeframe. But don't think it will change much here. It will, it will be really hard to
5487.92s:  see though. When did it? Oh, I need to go back a little bit further. My bad. I want to give us a
5496.88s:  little more time to differentiate. Let's go back.
5504.96s:  Of Roaring City says Ivy goes down when volume goes away. Sort of. That's not incorrect. But
5512.00s:  that's not necessarily what this is tied to. So let's go back five days. I'm going to go back a
5521.44s:  little bit further. And yeah, this would be okay. So Ulta, Ulta had earnings on Thursday.
5534.24s:  So if we take a look at implied volatility, this is using four hour candles. So in this case,
5542.80s:  they reported after the market here. So we can see short-term vol started immediately after
5552.40s:  they reported. And it continued through the first half of the next trading day. And then it
5559.92s:  leveled off here into the tail end of the next trading day. So in this case, it's showing you
5568.00s:  that generally speaking, you will find that earnings volatility in a vacuum isolating the
5574.24s:  volatility for the release itself will tend to come out within a few hours after the open
5581.84s:  following earnings. And then there might be some sort of persistent drift that occurs. But the
5590.00s:  movement that I personally would attribute to the earnings release in and of itself would be
5596.48s:  probably a few hours after the open. So that's another great question from them.
5605.84s:  All right, we got a few more minutes. So let's move on to another one.
5616.56s:  I don't like this one.
5621.36s:  I'm new to options, haven't done any yet. Try not understand them. I've come up with an idea.
5625.28s:  And I wonder if it's any good. Like is it a normal idea? My idea is to sell covered calls and
5630.40s:  KO stock that I have. If I do this, my only risk is that the price goes above the strike price and
5636.08s:  the calls get called away. And I have to sell my stocks for less than the worth at the time. And I
5639.92s:  get to keep any premium paid for the beginning. So yeah, there are flaws in this methodology.
5649.36s:  So one of the first flaws that I would highlight is specifically the risk component. My only risk
5661.04s:  is that price goes above the strike price. Is that correct? Is that the only risk that they have?
5667.92s:  I would argue nay.
5675.84s:  Roy Titty says no, exactly. You guys are directly on it. Give me one second. I'm going to go grab
5685.12s:  a reload seltzer water and then I'm going to be right back. But you guys run it so far.
5690.88s:  Oh, there's the wait, that's kind of cool. Look at me go. Interesting. Hi guys, from over here.
5700.08s:  I kind of like this. All right, I'll be right back.
5750.24s:  All right. We're back at him. What do you guys think? I kind of like that cut out one was pretty
5771.76s:  cool. Maybe I make myself even a little bit bigger. Look at that. We guys think better that way or no.
5780.96s:  All right. Let's see what you guys say.
5789.44s:  The calls are at risk as well. I wouldn't say that personally.
5795.12s:  Reese says which checker was it if dividend. That's a factor. I can't believe you guys are missing
5799.12s:  this. This is fucking nuts. Loss upside. Yeah, there you go. G 36. G 36.
5806.96s:  G 36 got it. Nice job. G 36. So G 36 hit the nail on the head. Let's structure. Let's pick
5816.08s:  something. They have Coca-Cola stock. Kale. Let's say that they bought in at like 68.
5825.60s:  And let's put on a perspective trade here. So we'll go in a buy. Let's say that they have their
5830.64s:  100 shares. And then let's say that they have their 100 shares at 68 bucks. And then let's say
5838.96s:  that they sell their short call 42 DTE whatever. They're getting their few dollars here. Analyze.
5847.28s:  Where's the risk in this trade? The risk is to the fucking downside. Now they're not viewing it
5853.12s:  as a risk because in their mind they're like, oh, it's Coca-Cola stock that I already hold. So
5858.88s:  they're completely not understanding that the risk here is the downside.
5867.92s:  Like that's exactly what the risk is here. So the problem with this is that again, like what most
5875.60s:  traders do intend to do, they're simply focusing on the profit. How much money do I stand to make?
5881.92s:  That's what they care about. I had a MRI earlier today for the whole back bowl shit that I have
5892.48s:  going on. And I had the contrast injected, which apparently has like fucking metal in it. So
5900.72s:  you're always trying to flush the metal out of the old system. All right, back to you guys. So
5907.04s:  yeah, G36 definitely gets a point here.
5911.44s:  At G36. There you go.
5922.56s:  Reece says I said that only given it away all upside potentially. Yeah. So the main thing here
5928.32s:  is the downside risk. That's just to be abundantly clear. That's precisely what they missed in this.
5935.68s:  That's actually like really, really dangerous to them if we're being honest because it shows like
5941.20s:  an entirely skewed perception of risk. So now for everybody else, how can we fix their perceived
5951.12s:  risk? There's an easy way to fix this problem. How do we do that?
5955.84s:  That's a massively effective way to do it. There's another way that's more similar to what they have.
5969.92s:  I would use a ratio diagonal simply because I would benefit for I would prefer the leverage
5976.24s:  than holding the shares easy. That's a easy, easy answer for me essentially every day of the week.
5981.52s:  Hold that over the shares and you gain way more leverage. I absolutely would take that.
5988.96s:  But that's not actually what I'm thinking in this case. Reece says I can see if they already hold
5997.44s:  that stock and have downside risk already. Yeah. It's whether they hold the stock where they're
6002.24s:  putting on the stock for the ratio or for the covered call. It doesn't matter. If you hold stock,
6008.96s:  there's downside risk. People forget that literally all the time for some reason. But that's
6015.60s:  the risk of holding the stock. Now, the funny part about covered calls is that Reece says in their
6023.52s:  mind they may already have it. So the downside risk is already prevalent. Right. It doesn't matter.
6029.76s:  Whether in their mind it's there and exist or not, the point I'm highlighting is that it's there
6035.20s:  regardless of how they're trying to rationalize the downside risk or lack there of it's there.
6042.32s:  That's the primary risk in this trade. And the important point, Blizzy says but the downside risk
6048.32s:  doesn't matter. It entirely matters. That is, that is complete folly. Whether or not a trader is
6054.88s:  willing to hold a stock doesn't negate the downside risk. It's still there and it still has an
6062.88s:  impact to the portfolio. Again, that's the naïve tay of traders that don't like realizing losing
6069.36s:  positions or having losing positions to tie up capital for extended durations before they can
6075.92s:  get out at a profit. That's the exact problem with this kind of thing. Is that traders think that
6081.84s:  exact kind of way? They think, oh, well, I hold the stock. I'm okay holding it. And even if they're
6086.40s:  okay holding it, guess what? If Coca-Cola drops, let's take a look at an example. We got in at 68.
6092.88s:  Let's pretend Coca-Cola instead of being right now at 71. Let's just not even, I'm not even going
6098.72s:  to pick a crazy thing. I'm going to pick something that's happened recently. It's go over the past
6102.24s:  year. It was down to $51. So let's say instead of at 71, it's at 51. I'm holding a position right
6110.64s:  now that's a $1,600 loss on a $6,800 outlay. I forgot, I have a calculator over here and I don't
6119.28s:  have to do it there. So we got in at, we were calling it 68. And right now it's running at 51.
6127.84s:  That's actually funny. It's very satisfying. It's a 25% decrease in value.
6132.56s:  So now you're holding something that's down $25 and now you're like, shit, well, I don't want
6136.48s:  to get out now. I still like the stock long term. And that's okay. You can like the stock long
6140.48s:  term. But guess what? While this $6,800 is tied up in this losing stock position, it could be,
6148.40s:  it should be making money. But it's not. It's tied up in this. And this position gave you
6156.72s:  $86. That's what you got on your short call. You made $86. And now the underlying is trading so low
6165.44s:  that you can no longer sell calls against it above your basis at least. So then you're like, okay,
6170.72s:  well, maybe I'll sell calls below, below my basis. Well, now there's a risk. The risk is,
6177.84s:  if it starts skyrocketing up, now you have to try to manage this short call again tying up
6184.08s:  capital longer and longer and longer to extend your profit trivially. So this is a massive, massive
6191.36s:  risk that again, traders talk themselves out of. And again, there's nothing wrong with accepting
6197.92s:  this risk. There's nothing wrong with saying, eh, that's my approach. I don't care about the
6202.08s:  opportunity cost. I'm okay. And you can do that. That's completely okay. But there's,
6209.28s:  it's just important to acknowledge the cost associated with it. There's a difference between saying,
6216.96s:  I am okay and acknowledge the risk and opportunity cost. There's a difference between that and saying
6224.56s:  there is no risk. No, man, like the risk is there. You can accept that it's there or not,
6231.52s:  or you can be okay with the risk or not. But to turn that into there's no risk, it's literally
6240.00s:  defying reality. It doesn't make sense. That's the broader point.
6248.08s:  Okay. Busy says if you're buying hold and trader, it doesn't matter in my opinion. Yeah,
6255.76s:  that's okay. Again, like if you're a buy and hold trader and you acknowledge the risk and you say,
6261.52s:  I'm okay with this risk. I want to hold Coca Cola for 30 years. That's completely cool.
6266.64s:  There's nothing wrong with that. Again, the problem I'm highlighting is a lack of objective
6272.32s:  analysis based on an internal preference. Just because I'm a buy and hold investor and I have
6278.32s:  a preference for holding things long term and I don't care if it goes down, I'm going to dollar
6281.52s:  cost average into it, which is also okay. There's nothing wrong with that. But there's something wrong
6286.80s:  with not being able to objectively realize and analyze the risk of something because of a perspective.
6293.84s:  Just because I don't mind with standing the draw downs doesn't mean it's not a risk. It absolutely
6300.72s:  is a risk. If I'm okay with it, then that's cool. No problem with the risk. I acknowledge it. I
6306.88s:  see it. I say it's there and I'm okay with it. But again, the big problem is that if we're so wrapped
6313.92s:  up in our perspective of doing things that we just don't want to see the risk, that's a fucking problem.
6320.24s:  That's a giant problem. So yeah, when it comes to, I think somebody said up above, let me see.
6327.76s:  Uh, Roryntitty says, so are you against the wheel? No way. No, I'm not against the wheel. I don't
6332.64s:  trade it. And I have a video that talks about the problems that I have with the wheel. And I will show
6341.44s:  you this is a bit of an old video. So you'll have to forgive essentially everything about it.
6346.96s:  There you go. So that one talks about the wheel versus the coverage triangle. And there's a reason
6359.04s:  why I prefer the coverage strangle writ large. The punchline is I have absolutely no problem with the
6366.08s:  wheel, especially for newer traders. I actually think it's a bit of a safer quote unquote strategy.
6372.32s:  But I much prefer the the coverage strangle or ratio covered calls because again, going off
6379.68s:  of a definition, this is the wheel essentially. I'm going to sell cash secured puts
6386.24s:  until I'm assigned. The problem with doing that is let's say that you're selling, let's say you
6392.72s:  like Coca Cola and you want to trade it to the upside. And you're like, okay, I'm going to,
6399.60s:  I'm going to sell these cash secured puts until I'm assigned. Okay, well, guess what? You never
6405.76s:  got assigned because it just went up from here. So what's the problem with that? Sure, you
6412.96s:  absolutely would have made money. But guess what you would have made you would have made far more
6417.92s:  money with buying the fucking stock. So the big problem I see exactly G 36 is right on it. I think
6428.16s:  the problem for people that trade the wheel is they get addicted to a really high win rate. They
6435.28s:  love the sensation of selling puts, they expire worthless. They love that feeling who doesn't.
6441.84s:  The idea of being right on a bunch of trades is awesome. There's a problem from just again,
6450.40s:  an objective analysis standpoint, you would have made more money doing something else.
6456.00s:  But we're too wrapped up in this great sensation of winning and feeling like we're doing this
6461.52s:  really smart thing and winning a bunch of trades that we don't really acknowledge that.
6467.12s:  So I have no fundamental issue with the wheel. If it were me, I would essentially always, always,
6474.40s:  always sell the calls at a ratio. And I would always sell additional cash secure puts. Like if I
6481.44s:  were going to trade it, which essentially turns it into the coverage strangle, which is why I like
6485.44s:  that strategy a lot personally. Reese says also in the wheel, most people don't admit to fee and
6492.56s:  think rolling isn't losing. Yeah, oh, yeah, that's a disease. I literally showed you a post.
6498.00s:  I'll find it really quick. I showed you a post from not too long ago where I commented on something
6502.72s:  and somebody was just like, it's here. That's actually kind of funny. It's like one of my more
6509.92s:  recent posts here. So this says, do I lose money rolling options? And then this person says,
6524.64s:  a loss if rolled for it, I was going to make sure I downloaded it. A loss is a loss only if rolled
6532.56s:  for a debit. And then they actually responded and then ended up taking it down. But this like,
6540.24s:  it's just wrong. It doesn't matter if you roll for a creditor debit. Like this is what a roll entails.
6548.00s:  We're closing a trade and realizing the P&L on that trade, whatever the P&L of that trade is,
6556.56s:  positive or negative. You realize that P&L and then you open up a new trade that's associated with it.
6563.68s:  But it doesn't get rid of the realized P&L from this other trade. It's there. It's always going
6569.44s:  to be there. But again, that's exact that's an exact thing that you'll find with a lot of
6574.16s:  wheel traders. They have such an issue accepting and dealing with losing trades.
6581.68s:  It's such a mental process for them that it completely fucks them up. That's my opinion.
6593.52s:  Dennis says, with the wheel, you're always buying higher than the market and selling lower than
6597.20s:  the market. It's a lose. Yeah, that's actually funny if you think of it that way. That's awesome.
6603.60s:  G36 says, I want Eric to be my dad. I'm not sure that you want that. I'm not sure anybody wants that.
6608.32s:  But humbled for the sentiment, but yeah, probably wouldn't be the guy for the job.
6619.12s:  Willis is Eric for president. I also have zero aspirations for political office. So yeah,
6624.48s:  apparently I'm just letting you guys down all over the place.
6627.36s:  Jotato says, was top common accurate just selling the position and buying a new farther out dated one?
6639.20s:  Oh, let me see. Rolling options is a fancy way of selling your selling your current position and
6644.24s:  buying. No, because you're not necessarily buying, but yeah, they're confused. But yeah, they're
6649.84s:  not wrong. It's literally just closing a trade and opening a new one. I have a bunch of videos on
6654.72s:  rolling. I'll throw a couple in here because I have a video that breaks down all of these different
6660.48s:  myths and how it actually works. So this is an older one about the myths of rolling. And then these
6670.80s:  are two new videos that I recently did that talk about more of the details about rolling.
6680.48s:  But yeah, rolling is fine. Again, like there's absolutely nothing wrong with rolling in
6685.60s:  options trade. I do it all the time. But again, the problem traders have is that in the process of
6691.36s:  doing these things, we dilute ourselves. And we say, oh, no, it's not a loss. If it's done,
6697.60s:  not for a debit. Well, fun fact, you can even roll for a debit and still make money. So even
6703.60s:  that's wrong. I'll literally show you an example. If we use my little handy dandy calculator here,
6711.68s:  this is from my excel sheet. And let's say in this, I don't even remember, we looked at this
6718.16s:  together before FRM or whatever. And let's say that this is the position, right? So these are the
6725.28s:  dates that we entered. This is what the stock was at. We looked at a one lot, a 30 strike, we got
6729.60s:  a dollar 53. We closed that for $3.45. So I literally line it out clear as day over here.
6736.72s:  So what happens over here? When I sell to open this put, I get 153 bucks. That's money. That's not
6746.48s:  immediately factored. It's parked into the cash and sweep. And then it's tied to an open trade.
6754.24s:  So for example, if I sell a call, I get this $153, your net liquidating value does not go up
6761.36s:  by $153 because it's tied to an open trade net liquidating values. If you closed everything
6767.28s:  right now, what can you take out of the account? So it doesn't go into net lick. It goes into cash and
6773.52s:  sweep. And it sits in cash and sweep. So then in this case, we in this scenario, we bought back
6780.88s:  that option for $3.45. So that means that we just realized a $345 loss on this trade.
6790.72s:  The net P&L between these two trades is essentially these two numbers combined. So it's this plus
6797.76s:  this. You lost $192. That's the net. So that's essentially what this shows you here.
6806.40s:  So that's what you walk out at after these two positions, you collected $153 at the end of it,
6814.00s:  you had to give $345 out. So you had that $153. You just gave that back and then you had to give $192
6822.88s:  on top of that out of your own pocket to close the position. That's the first part of a role right
6830.32s:  there. And then the second part of the role is when we open a new trade. So in this case,
6838.56s:  I the scenario we use is we sold it for $3.50. So that means we got $3.50 times $133.50. So now,
6849.20s:  if you take a look at all of these individual positions, you can see, so equals this plus this plus
6857.44s:  this 158 bucks. That's how much you're up. If this comes down for $0, that's what that means.
6866.64s:  Now I use a formula, as you can tell here, called the premium target, and it tells me,
6874.56s:  what do I need to close this option at in order for me to hit break even?
6880.80s:  So in this case, if I sold this option for $3.50, I need it to be trading at $158 to be at break even
6889.44s:  for the position. So if I hit 158, I'm flat. Now, this idea of having to roll for a credit,
6898.08s:  it's wrong. You don't have to roll for a credit. So let's look at another scenario. I sold for a
6903.68s:  $1.53. I closed it for $3.45. Let's say I open the next one for $3.35. That's a 10 cent debit.
6912.40s:  I can still make money. In this case, I can still make $143. Even if I roll for a fucking debit.
6920.40s:  But again, people don't know this shit because they don't take the time to look into the details
6926.32s:  because they're too worried about what their ego feels about winning or losing. So I can have
6933.68s:  a trade that I roll, that I realize a loss, that I open up a new trade literally for a debit and
6939.28s:  I can still make money. I can break all the rules here according to a lot of these people.
6944.32s:  So this in and of itself is what rolling is. It's two trades tied together. That's all there is to it.
6954.40s:  Simple as that. So yeah, I think that the concept of rolling is super important because people
6960.96s:  literally dork it up all the time. And it's because there's so much like different like mental
6966.56s:  components that are baked into it. Tommy says have to track the trades. Math tells the truth. That's
6974.40s:  exactly that's literally exactly it's it's straight up just numbers. Now the other thing that we
6980.64s:  have to know about rolling that's super important is that you are tying up capital. So as you're
6986.96s:  going through these positions and rolling them, rolling them, rolling them, you'll notice that,
6991.04s:  yeah, I can roll for a small credit and make a little bit of money. Let's grab that example back
6994.80s:  really quick. So if we just keep running through this example and let's say that I get my five-cent
7002.16s:  credit. So I get in for 350. And then let's say that I have to close this one for four dollars.
7010.08s:  And then let's say I can open this next one for four dollars and five cents.
7014.40s:  And then I need to include the number there. Like the amount that I stand to make on this trade
7022.40s:  is pennies. It's not much. I'm not adding a lot with each of these steps. So yes, I might be
7030.80s:  able to get out of this trade for a win. But how much money am I actually adding by rolling for
7037.92s:  that credit? In this case, I stood to make 153. Here, I rolled for a five-cent credit. So I just
7046.56s:  added five dollars to my total profit potential. And then here, I rolled for 405, got my net credit,
7054.40s:  I just added five dollars to my total profit potential. How long does this whole thing take with all
7060.96s:  these roles? There's an opportunity cost to this money. Again, people, the average trader is
7070.16s:  delusional as they think about trading because they get too wrapped up trying to avoid losing
7077.60s:  positions. And they totally fail to understand that losing is fine. Losing is completely fine.
7085.12s:  If you can learn how to be a good loser in trading, you're going to do much better than the vast
7090.48s:  majority of other people that get wrapped up with every losing position. Literally guarantee it.
7095.84s:  Because if you have a problem with losing is trading, you're going to have a lot of issues
7099.20s:  doing the right things because it includes taking losses. That's what I say.
7112.40s:  Chris says, so credit spreads, what's your typical thought for best practices for the gaps? You
7118.48s:  want to buy in the money and sell out of the money, but typically you want that trade within a day
7124.48s:  within a day or closer to expiration. Chris, I don't actually totally follow your question,
7134.08s:  but in general, for gaps, that's kind of the point of a credit. Wait, when you say gaps, do you
7142.72s:  mean the spread with or do you mean gap in terms of price movement with the underlying?
7148.72s:  I don't fully follow that question.
7159.36s:  Vladimir Offputin says, how many years trading options until your aha moment or was it gradual?
7164.80s:  Super gradual for me. I still don't feel like there's like an aha moment where it feels like
7169.84s:  you just get everything. I think it's something that you slowly pick up over time.
7174.64s:  Chris says like a 12 and 15 spread, for example. Okay, so you're talking about the width.
7180.56s:  Just so you know, Chris, when you're referring to gaps, most people, when we hear gap,
7185.76s:  we're going to think a gap in stock price like this. So, yeah, so Chris, in that sense,
7193.44s:  we would say a $3 wide, that's how we would phrase that. We wouldn't call it a gap. We would say
7201.20s:  $3 wide or the spread is, it's a $5 spread. Those are two ways again, just so that again,
7208.56s:  it's for beginners, right? So helping you understand some of the lingo. So for those, it's actually,
7215.28s:  I don't really trade spreads like that. I don't really like credit spreads or vertical spreads
7221.04s:  specifically. But if I were to trade them, I would try to trade them as wide as I can.
7227.84s:  And I would essentially trade it as a naked option. And then I would just use the wing
7234.96s:  for margin management if I needed it. But like for me, I'm not going to do a $5 wide
7244.08s:  credit spread. I'm essentially going to, I'm essentially going to short the 70 put in this
7250.40s:  example. I might buy the 60, the 55 or the 50. If I have a small account and I need to manage
7257.68s:  the basis, but then I'm going to manage this 70 put like it's a naked short put. I'm not going
7263.44s:  to manage it like it's a credit spread personally. Now there are times that you can put on a credit
7269.60s:  spread that are positively expected. I have on one right now an ASTS. So for that, what I do is I
7276.32s:  measure the width and I try to find the width that gives me the best expected return.
7281.76s:  So in that example, I have a calculator. I think we went over this not too long ago that essentially
7290.48s:  helps me calculate the expected return for spreads specifically. And based on the width of the strike,
7299.60s:  the probability of profit, the credit received, those kinds of inputs, I can then decide what I need
7305.68s:  to see from the trade in order for it to be positively expected. So that's typically what I'm
7311.04s:  targeting. Rowing Tiddy says, aren't they a tool for people that kind of want to park money and earn
7319.52s:  a steady income? What are we talking about? Rowing Tiddy? And then Vlad Amiro Putin says, how to protect
7330.96s:  against overnight gaps down? Let's say you hold long calls and bad news is release after hours.
7335.44s:  Your primary tool is sizing. Size the trade. Rowing Tiddy says, okay, credit spreads. Oh, I don't
7343.68s:  think so. I think you might be talking about a box spread maybe, Rowing Tiddy? Because a box spread
7349.20s:  does that for you. A credit spread is a directional trade. So a credit spread, whether like if it's a
7356.72s:  a put credit spread, it's essentially a bullish trade. And then if it's a call credit spread,
7361.20s:  it's essentially a bearish trade. But it's not really a place to park your money. The trade definitely
7369.12s:  still has risk. So like, for example, if we take a look at this five dollar wide credit spread
7375.92s:  in Coca-Cola, just because we're here. It's five dollars wide. You collect $87 and you're risking 413.
7391.20s:  So yeah. And then Vlad Amiro, just so you know, my response to that really wasn't dismissive,
7401.60s:  that's the God on his truth in my opinion is to size the portfolio correctly and maintain
7407.52s:  a diversified portfolio. So if you have 100% of your entire portfolio in an individual stock
7417.12s:  and you're trading long calls, that's one of the risks you expose yourself to is essentially
7423.92s:  idiosyncratic risk, something that's very unique to that individual product. So I think sizing
7432.72s:  is probably the best possible thing you could do after sizing. It's holding a diversified portfolio
7437.76s:  of different products. Riz says, need to collect about a third of the width of the spread to have
7442.88s:  positive expectancy. It's completely dependent on the probabilities. So it's not quite as neat
7451.36s:  as a third for like a 30 delta. It's pretty close.
7460.64s:  I'm trying to see where I have that spread. Yeah, this one. We talked about this one.
7466.08s:  Oh, we, I don't know if we did this with just the Patreon folks. I don't remember when we did
7470.56s:  this one, but we talked about the spread. So this is essentially like the calculator. This one,
7474.72s:  I copied it over from my excel sheet, but so like all this is broken, but this is essentially the
7480.16s:  way that I look at it. If I'm looking at a spread and I want to see if it's positively expected from
7486.72s:  the sizing. So it's just based on essentially the different, probably a profit, the width,
7496.40s:  and then the credit received. Riz says, we did an example on the dollar wide of his 30 cents.
7502.64s:  Yeah, so it was 30 cents with a 70% probability of profit. So we need to also include the probability
7508.64s:  of profit. Yeah, it's a really important portion of the input because if you have something that
7515.04s:  has a massively high probability of profit, then you can, you can collect a lower credit,
7519.68s:  but that's the problem with credit spreads is they don't tend to offer that exposure.
7526.40s:  I'm loving the questions. I think our dinner just got here, but I still got a few minutes. So
7537.52s:  Ricky says, what if I love winning more than I love making higher profits? Yeah, then you can do
7543.44s:  that. The market can accommodate that. And there are a lot of people in the market that are not
7547.92s:  purely rational like that. So if that's what you like doing, then do whatever's right for you. But
7554.80s:  yeah, you're going to give up money too. Which is no good.
7560.72s:  Chris says, what's your preference on time spreads, sell shorter DTE by longer?
7566.00s:  It depends on what I'm trying to trade. See, this is one of the common thing traders do, right?
7571.20s:  Is we try to create rule sets about strategies? And it's not the way that I look at trading
7578.72s:  literally at all. So if I take a look at, I think I have it in here.
7589.76s:  Let me see if I can find it. No. No. No. We got all sorts of references in here at this point.
7601.60s:  No. Oh, this works. I don't know how to learn makes sense here. Oh, I guess this makes sense. Yeah.
7612.48s:  Okay. So anyways, this is what I think makes way more sense. So for Chris, in this scenario,
7622.64s:  when I'm looking at something like time spreads, I'm not going to define the rules that I'm going
7627.36s:  to use for the time spread before I define what I'm doing. So you'll notice that if I'm trying to
7633.68s:  build a strategy, I need to think about profit mechanisms first. Then I need to figure out how I
7639.68s:  measure them. And then I can start talking about structures and strategy. So in your example,
7646.96s:  the way that I would determine if what DTEs I want and what how I'm going to structure the
7652.72s:  entire trade is entirely dependent on the profit mechanism. I'm not going to come into a position
7659.28s:  with the idea of like, Oh, I'm just going to trade a time spread here because that's what I want.
7664.72s:  That it doesn't mean anything. I need to make money. So in order to trade something like that,
7671.52s:  I would have to start with whatever the profit mechanism is. So the profit mechanism sometimes
7677.04s:  for things like time spreads is potentially playing the relative value between options. Chris says,
7684.32s:  that's what I was hoping you would talk about the thought process. Yeah, sure. Happy to. You know,
7687.44s:  I'm happy to. So this is less about time spreads though. And this is more about options trading.
7696.24s:  So if I take a look, we'll try Coca-Cola because it's up by volatility. Let's look at the other
7703.84s:  and let's kill this first one. Yeah, there we go. Okay, great example. So I see here at the 61,
7712.24s:  I see that the 20 set. It has higher vol than the 13 set. So I could make the relative value play
7721.28s:  that the 13 set 61s need to become more expensive relative to the 20 set. So in that scenario,
7729.44s:  I would find this exact strike in this case, the 61s. And then I would buy and sell.
7736.24s:  So these are obviously super, super far out of the money on the put side. But again,
7741.36s:  this is just a general example. So I think these need to get more expensive, right? That's the theory.
7748.08s:  Is that the 13 sets need to come up and the 20 sets need to come down. So then I'll go to the
7754.88s:  20 set 61s. Whatever this ends up being again, I don't actually know what those would be.
7761.92s:  I would do something like that. So this one's going to be obviously skewed pretty heavily,
7769.04s:  primarily because of how wide this is. But I'm just giving you an example of how to use something
7776.88s:  like that. So in this case, that's essentially the way that I could trade them for that purpose.
7785.20s:  But again, the important part is defining the profit mechanism first. How does this thing make
7790.72s:  money? And then I can start thinking about other considerations like in this case,
7798.16s:  how did I pick the DTE? Well, because I looked for the explorations that had something that
7803.28s:  looked interesting. I could look for ones where there's even greater inversions or I can look for
7809.52s:  things that are in a specific direction that I want. So all of that will help me identify if I want
7815.04s:  the call side, the put side, if I want near term DTE, long term DTE, that's all dependent on the
7822.00s:  profit mechanism. Roy Titty says, I don't think past all I don't think I passed all the prerequisites
7832.08s:  to be trading options. Don't worry, Roy Titty. I literally think that's the same case for
7838.16s:  essentially all of us that have ever traded options. So to me, I actually think that that makes
7843.60s:  you even more the option trader. But what I would show you is back to this little guide thing that I
7848.96s:  keep highlighting because I think it's useful. Here, I give you specific learning objectives
7855.12s:  for each of these steps that I think makes sense. And then actually, if you go to the next page,
7863.04s:  you'll see that each of these, I show you like sub topics that belong to each of these,
7869.44s:  that you should have a working understanding of. So eventually, I want to build like some sort of
7876.08s:  quiz or test that's built into this. I haven't figured out exactly how I want to do it. I might
7881.52s:  have to do it through like a Google sheet that then like sends the answers or something afterwards.
7886.16s:  I haven't worked out the details there. That's one of those things that's like on Erics to do list,
7890.32s:  but it's super low if I'm being honest with you. But I do want to build something like that.
7897.36s:  But yeah, I think it's okay to start without a full understanding, but I do think it's important
7908.40s:  to make sure that you understand what you're doing. This is actually one of the things that we
7911.60s:  offer in the discord. Even the free side, not the pay side. In the free side, you can go through
7916.48s:  these modules and you can ask people in the beginner section questions, right? Like, hey, I just
7922.48s:  finished the module to on the types of securities. Can somebody help me make sure I understand?
7928.96s:  And somebody, typically, even if it's not me, but somebody will typically try and take a look with
7934.56s:  you. For the Patreon folks, we have a specific section. We'll all go through with them.
7938.16s:  But obviously, I just have limited bandwidth. I can't promise to do that with everybody. But I do
7942.88s:  my best. And the community in general will also be there to help. But yeah, I think this would add
7949.84s:  a lot of structure. That's the whole idea behind it. Chris says, HVIV or Greeks in thoughts at all.
7959.60s:  Yeah, I mean, they're all super important. I shared a video earlier about the Greeks.
7964.40s:  I actually have a video. I don't know. You probably haven't seen it. Let me grab this playlist for you.
7968.88s:  My guess is this playlist would be really useful for you. This is going to be in options 101
7973.76s:  playlist. And I have like an options 101 video that's kind of old in there. But I still think it's
7980.08s:  good. So you can start with that. Here. So this is investing in trading 101. That's like real,
7988.64s:  real basics. And then this is options 101. So I would start with that second link. But in
7995.52s:  there, you'll find a link to a video that goes through the Greeks, experienced premiums.
8001.04s:  Chris says, I know them, but mean with that spread question. Well, if you know them playing
8008.16s:  devil's advocate here, if you know them, then you would know the answer to that question.
8012.80s:  So I would argue that you might not know them. Maybe as well as you think for that reason. But let's see.
8025.20s:  Like when you are doing you buy cell, that confuses me. Sorry. So so time to Kay, gamma changing delta.
8036.80s:  Yep. Okay. What about them?
8043.36s:  In the meantime, I'm going to look at all these different logos on here because like this guy's
8047.04s:  funny. Maybe I can start using him. If I'm mad. Like IV crushing. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm not following
8057.20s:  your question because like in this example for the horizontal spread, that's that's exactly I'm
8064.24s:  looking at I'm playing the volatility here. That's exactly what I'm trying to isolate. I'm trying
8069.04s:  to play the volatility in 20 step contracting and the volatility in 13 step expanding. Yeah. So
8080.88s:  so the Greeks help us understand how a position will behave. Chris says theta crush could be
8090.24s:  wasting your time on the shorter. It could be. Yeah. There's there's no free lunch, right? And
8094.96s:  that's exactly to your point. That's the point of the Greeks is because it tells us what needs to
8101.12s:  happen in order for our idea to play out. Chris says, for example, you want the IV crush for the shorter.
8112.64s:  Well, okay. So just to nitpick terminology a little bit, I think what you're trying to say here
8119.28s:  is that you're trying to structure a trade where the shorter term option will you think that's
8127.60s:  where the IV contraction is going to occur. Because I would just always remind like the market doesn't
8132.24s:  give a fuck what you want or what anybody else wants. It doesn't matter what we want. So I'm just
8137.76s:  drawing that distinction because I would be really careful even using the terminology of like want
8142.64s:  in that instance. Chris says so and so that's the goal for the shorter one. You look at all
8153.36s:  not just. I'm trying to do my absolute best to follow you, but I am. I'm really I'm really
8165.92s:  fucking lost here. Vladimir off Putin says Tommy DK effect worse both ways. High performing people
8172.40s:  don't write themselves highly. Yeah, well, that's kind of the point, though, is high people recognize
8178.24s:  their own. They recognize their own shortfalls. So the Dunning Kruger effect doesn't it doesn't
8186.08s:  persist that way for educated people. So I think this one. This one here has something for the Dunning
8195.92s:  Kruger effect. So there's a point where in this slope of learning phase, you know a lot more
8204.72s:  than you probably think you know, but you also know there's a lot you don't know. But there's a
8210.24s:  point that eventually comes where you do hit mastery and like you know what you're doing, right? So
8215.60s:  in the example of trading, I can objectively analyze that there's a ton of shit that I don't know
8220.80s:  that I'm continually learning. I also know a lot of fucking shit and I know I know a lot of
8226.56s:  fucking shit. It's not because I'm I'm cocky. I'm definitely confident because I have a demonstrated
8232.88s:  skill set over nearly two decades that I can look at and see, right? So I can objectively evaluate
8240.32s:  myself. So the Dunning Kruger effect to your point does affect people that are in the slope of
8248.64s:  learning where they might think they know less or might judge their competence lower than it
8255.04s:  actually is, but there comes a point where they you know, right? Because even something like mastery,
8262.40s:  right? We tend to use the 10,000 hour mark for stuff like this. People don't realize how long that
8267.28s:  takes. So 10,000 hours, if you do something five hours every single day, Monday through Friday,
8277.36s:  Christmas, New Year's, no hungover, drunk phase, none of that. If you do that for it takes five and a
8285.20s:  half years to hit this. That's at five hours every single day. So the vast majority of people,
8294.80s:  obviously, are not going to spend this and it takes a lot longer than that. So once you get to this
8301.44s:  point of like quote, quote, mastery, you kind of know you're there because you've been doing it for a
8306.72s:  while at that point. That's my thought. Michael, as he says, can't you know shares of a company is going
8314.32s:  by options? You can't know, but you can use them to derive inferences for sure. So the options
8320.32s:  chains can tell you a lot. I actually have a video in the queue about like reading an options chain
8328.40s:  and essentially the goal of that video is to walk through a lot of those small things on how you can
8336.08s:  read between the lines on an options chain and use it to help you identify information.
8343.52s:  So it's not just the idea of like how to functionally read an options chain. That's obviously part of it.
8349.60s:  But the bigger part of it is using it to try and make money by using it for some of its predictive
8357.12s:  qualities. Now the problem with that kind of thing is a lot of people don't realize that things are
8361.76s:  relative and you have to develop a bit of a fingerprint for whatever it is that you're looking at.
8368.08s:  So for example, if we're looking at something like GameStop, I can tell you based on the near-term
8376.96s:  performance that today there was some really interesting price movement. I can see lots of options
8384.96s:  moving in big blocks. But then when I look in time and sales, I can see some really big trades.
8391.76s:  That came through today at different points in time. So there's a lot of different ways
8399.12s:  that you can use options. You can use volatility in something like this to see like where the market
8407.52s:  thinks things are going. So in this case, I can see there's 174% fall for next week and then
8412.64s:  the week after that's 149. And then like the week before that, this was like 100 and something
8417.76s:  earlier. So why is that? It's because something's going on here. Obviously now we know it's earnings.
8422.96s:  But if you look at some of my older videos where we didn't know earnings had shifted out, I had been
8427.68s:  pointing out this expiration cycle for a while because I could see it. It was telling me something
8433.84s:  and my best guess and I called it out in a video that I thought earnings was probably going to shift
8439.28s:  because of the way that the market was pricing.
8441.68s:  So yeah, options markets are crazy, crazy informed places. You can look for all different kinds of
8451.92s:  skew. You can look for unusual trades. I have all sorts of scanners that are running all the time
