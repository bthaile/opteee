0.00s: Delta is not a good approximation for probability of being in the money under two conditions.
7.92s: And I'm going to show you.
9.32s: First, let's take a look at spy.
11.72s: If we go out 39 days, we go to a 30 delta option right here.
17.20s: The 30 delta would tell you about a 30% probability of being in the money at expiration.
22.20s: And if we go over and we look at the actual calculated probability, which is different,
27.12s: it shows this 28.14.
29.72s: So it's pretty dang close, right off by 2.2 cares.
33.64s: Well, let's now go out further.
36.60s: Let's go to 16 Jan, which is 249 days out.
40.52s: Let's go to that same 30 delta, 29 delta close enough.
44.24s: This would tell us 29% probability of being in the money at expiration.
48.16s: And this one instead has 25%.
51.24s: So what just happened?
52.84s: We're in one of the most liquid underlines that exist.
56.40s: And what you just learned is that if you go further out in time, the relationship
60.32s: starts to break down more.
61.72s: Now again, this is still close enough because it's super liquid, not very volatile,
67.40s: which is the next key component.
69.28s: Let's take a look at Tesla.
71.28s: If we do the same exercise, let's first do the 39 DTE.
75.80s: And we do the 30 delta.
77.44s: You'll notice 30 delta, 30% chance being in the money at expiration.
81.40s: This is instead 23.7%.
84.84s: That's a pretty big difference.
85.84s: This is actually bigger difference than what you saw in spy going further out in time.
90.44s: So pay attention.
92.44s: Let's go to 16 Jan, 26.
94.68s: Let's go to 30 delta again, 29, 31, same same.
97.88s: Just go somewhere in here.
99.44s: And you'll notice that the probability of being in the money is now about 15%.
105.36s: About half.
106.76s: What's happening?
107.88s: There are two things that skew using delta is the probability.
111.92s: Volatility is one.
113.32s: Second is duration.
114.52s: This is why it is typically still good practice to just use this separate calculation.
119.12s: There is a separate calculation for it.
120.60s: I have a video that goes through that.
122.24s: I'll throw it in the notes.
123.60s: But as always, if you any questions, let me know.
125.44s: Be an all-air sealer.
