0.00s: How did I go from consistently underperforming the market to consistently beating the market?
5.28s: Well, this video is exactly how it's through trading plans, strategy outlines, and trading logs.
11.92s: This is the work of trading.
14.48s: So my goal in this video is to walk you through how I approach all of those different tools.
19.04s: What's up everybody?
19.92s: Eric here. Welcome back to all the outliers and shout out to the Patreon family.
22.88s: You guys make content like this possible for everybody else.
26.00s: So if what I do helps you in any way, consider signing out.
28.64s: Let's get straight to it.
30.40s: So how did I go from underperforming the market really consistently over my first five years?
36.08s: I think there's one year that I outperform the market.
39.44s: And even in that year, technically, I was still negative.
42.64s: I was just less negative than the S&B 500.
45.28s: How did I go from that to where I'm at now?
47.36s: Where as I look at my performance from 2018 to 2022, this shows my returns on average
53.84s: or 24.6.
54.88s: My compound annual growth rate was actually a little bit lower than that.
58.16s: But that's about my compound annual growth rate from when I started in 2007
63.12s: until the last full year in 2022.
65.28s: How did that happen?
66.16s: Well, it is from this from trading documentation.
68.96s: So what's the purpose?
70.32s: What are these tools for?
72.00s: The first thing is for organization.
73.84s: The markets literally have infinite variables.
77.04s: You as the trader cannot be another uncontrolled variable.
82.48s: The problem with that, you're never going to see the same market twice.
85.60s: It'll have similarities, but it's never the same thing.
88.32s: So if you do not have a good understanding of what works optimally when
94.16s: and when you should use different tools,
96.48s: you just bounce between things.
98.32s: If you asked yourself right now, how did you do six months ago?
102.32s: You might not know.
103.20s: But if you don't have good trading logs to go back and look to see,
107.84s: then what good is the information that you were mastering,
110.56s: that time frame, if it's only as good as your memory?
112.96s: So organization forces you to track these things so that you can optimize over time,
118.00s: which that's number four, but you'll hear me reiterate that a few times.
121.44s: It's a thought exercise.
122.72s: The second purpose for doing these things is so that you are not building the plane
127.12s: as you are flying it.
128.48s: What that means is think about when you are in a stressful scenario,
132.16s: when you don't really have a clear plan of action, what tends to happen to people?
137.28s: Some people like to climb mountains.
139.68s: I like to build planes in the air.
143.68s: If you're in a kinetic scenario, people very frequently will freeze.
148.24s: When you're in a financial trading scenario from the comfort of your home,
151.76s: you still might mentally freeze.
152.96s: You still might make bad decisions typically we do when we're under a lot of pressure
157.04s: without any problem to thought.
158.40s: This is the same thing in the Marine Corps.
159.84s: If you're in the military, you definitely have gone through planning exercises.
163.52s: And the main purpose of those planning exercises is to have an idea of what you're going to do,
168.80s: but we fully acknowledge that what we end up doing rarely looks exactly like what we're planning.
174.80s: But that plan gives you something to go off of.
177.60s: Because my boy Mike Tyson said it the best.
180.80s: Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.
183.44s: So the whole idea behind that is we have an idea of what we're doing,
187.76s: and then we can adjust as needed off of it, but it gives us a starting point.
192.00s: And that leads us into planning.
193.60s: Because I ask my community regularly, like, hey, what are your trading objectives?
197.60s: And I'm actually really surprised how frequently I get really insane objectives or none at all.
202.32s: Some of them will say, oh, I'm just trying to practice this strategy.
205.28s: What's the point of that?
206.40s: Like, what is the point of that?
207.68s: The whole point of trading is to make money.
210.24s: If everything you're doing in trading is not in the purpose of making money,
214.96s: you literally are wasting your fucking time.
217.68s: That's harsh, man.
218.96s: So when we're planning out our efforts,
222.32s: we should always go back to what is our goal,
225.28s: and then make sure everything we're doing serves that ultimate goal.
229.92s: Sure.
230.24s: If you want to learn random things here and there, go for it.
232.48s: But the whole idea is that it should be pretty specifically designed
236.16s: to move you closer to your end state that should be clearly defined.
239.20s: Optimization, without this, it's very difficult to get better.
243.92s: As I look back at my returns, again, using my first five years, they're unimpressive.
248.40s: My first two years were negative.
250.64s: And that's also because I started in 2007.
252.88s: But my third, fourth, fifth year, they were all positive,
256.00s: but they were like trailing the market by like tenths of a point.
259.52s: I wasn't outperforming the market.
260.88s: So what I was doing wasn't working objectively.
264.64s: And because I started this process of outlining what I think I'm doing via the plans,
270.16s: I have my strategies in terms of how I think I'm going to trade my different tools,
273.60s: and then logs to validate them.
275.76s: I was able to objectively look at the information and say,
279.12s: this is not working.
280.80s: These things look to show the best promise.
283.68s: Let me try to develop these further without that we are just running in circles.
288.32s: And that leads to the fifth point.
289.68s: If you don't go through this process of creating these tools,
292.96s: you lose so much time and effort.
295.28s: When I talk about things like paper trading,
297.52s: one of the beautiful parts about it is not just to validate a strategy without losing money,
301.68s: but it's because you were learning along the way and you're creating a data set.
305.68s: I cannot overemphasize that part enough.
308.56s: Creating a data set drastically increases your efficiency because then it's not a guessing game.
314.24s: You don't look at the market and say, hey, the market's behaving like X, Y, or Z.
318.40s: What should I try next?
320.00s: As you build out this toolkit, you know what works best.
324.32s: So it drastically decreases the amount of wasted effort that you can then feed back into your system
331.36s: again to further optimize and then accountability.
334.16s: I'm not going to go through the whole psychology of trading and what that all looks like.
337.12s: That's a whole other conversation.
338.64s: But suffice it to say that we all have an ego.
340.96s: None of us like being wrong.
342.48s: And we don't like reconciling when we are at faults unless you get good at it,
347.92s: unless you get used to it.
349.04s: So accountability in your trading plans via trading logs,
352.16s: all of these different tools, it forces you to take accountability for the things you can control
357.76s: and to optimize those things to make sure that you are controlling them and fixing them
362.80s: in case they're not working.
364.32s: For example, if you have a mental stop and then the trade goes past your stop and you don't
368.96s: do anything and then you have this giant loss, even though you had that stop written in your
373.84s: trading plan, but you just didn't let it go.
376.88s: You're to blame.
377.76s: You know exactly who dorked that trade up and it's you.
381.52s: So it forces us to come to terms with our own performance, which is absolutely massive.
386.00s: So now that we understand why this stuff is so important and why I spend so much time talking
391.20s: about these concepts with you guys, let's get into what the trading plan looks like.
394.48s: So mine typically has somewhere around eight sections, big sections, and then it's just massive now.
402.00s: Mine is literally like 380 pages as it sits.
405.36s: That's because my trading plan has evolved.
407.52s: It's not even, I don't even label as a trading plan anymore.
409.92s: I label as wealth development and has my real estate stuff in there, my angel investing stuff in
414.24s: there because what I'm doing in terms of tracking applies to all of my business ventures.
419.76s: So these are the primary sections and I'll walk you through each of these so that you have
424.08s: an idea of what they look like so that when you download the free guide at the end,
427.60s: you kind of have a jumpstart on what this thing should look like.
430.16s: The very first section, purpose and goals.
432.24s: There's nothing fancy here.
434.24s: This is one of the most interesting things about trading in my opinion,
437.20s: is that I am by all accounts average.
440.16s: All accounts, the reason why my performance continually outperforms the market is
445.92s: literally because of structure, organization, stuff like this.
449.84s: Not super smart.
450.88s: I just make sure that I'm using the best information I have to inform my decision making.
456.32s: So purpose and goals, there's two sections to that.
458.80s: We have the desired end state.
460.00s: This is what we're trying to accomplish in investing in totality.
463.60s: And then we have kind of midterm objectives.
465.76s: I typically break this out six months.
467.60s: Maybe I don't do that anymore myself, but you know, you can.
470.24s: I used to, I used to do three, six, nine, 12, but we have short-term objectives.
474.32s: So stuff that's less than a year.
476.00s: One, your objectives, five year objectives, 10 year objectives.
478.96s: Again, inspect what you expect.
481.60s: The whole purpose of this is to force you to think through what you're doing.
485.52s: And it's funny because my mentor, trading mentor,
488.48s: is the one who literally forced me to start thinking about a trading plan,
492.32s: specifically strategy outlines.
493.76s: That was the main thing he was harping on.
495.60s: And once I realized how impactful that was,
498.32s: I started building it out into all of these other things.
501.12s: I bring that up to your attention because do not get overwhelmed here.
504.40s: I'm going to run through a bunch of shit with you guys.
506.72s: Don't look at this and be like, wow, this is so much.
509.36s: I don't even know where to start.
510.56s: Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
511.44s: Even if you have no clue where to begin this process,
514.72s: start right here.
516.16s: Purpose and goals.
517.20s: Open up the example that I'm sharing with you guys.
519.52s: Or open up a blank word doc, put these sections in there,
522.72s: and just start.
524.56s: So many people could literally transform their lives
528.72s: if they just start doing shit.
531.20s: Don't let your dreams be dreams.
534.24s: Yesterday, you said tomorrow.
536.24s: So just do it.
538.16s: And then you can fix it as you learn more, as you go along.
541.52s: You're not going to have all the answers.
542.96s: Don't worry about all of that.
544.56s: What you need to worry about is the mental hurdle of allowing that
548.80s: to not permit you starting something.
550.96s: Just start.
551.60s: So now we know what purpose and goals is.
553.68s: This is just giving us guide, right?
555.44s: What are we trying to do here?
556.64s: General market notes.
558.40s: This is a large section of my trading plan
561.68s: that walks through a ton of things.
564.40s: This I would consider broadly optional for you.
567.76s: But there's a couple things in here
569.20s: that I would implore you to include if you would.
572.32s: The first thing here I have is structure.
574.80s: This literally is how does the market work?
577.28s: How do options work?
578.56s: I have like an entire section on the history of options.
581.20s: You don't have to do all that.
582.08s: That's just because I'm a nerd about this shit.
588.64s: But what you should pay attention to are mechanisms.
591.52s: How markets operate?
593.44s: That's important.
594.40s: A.K.A. What does a broker do?
596.32s: That's important for you to understand.
598.32s: How does the Fed impact the market?
600.24s: How do different economic factors impact the market?
603.44s: Those kinds of things are good to build out over time.
605.76s: Studies is exactly what that sounds like.
607.52s: I spend a lot of time reading through different things.
609.68s: Different report outs from the big banks.
612.32s: Different studies off of academic papers.
615.28s: And I track the outputs of that.
617.20s: It's useful for me.
618.08s: You don't have to do that.
618.88s: This one I do think you need observations.
621.28s: This is literally where you just captured what you saw happen
624.56s: in the market and what that means to you.
626.40s: The reason why this section is so important is because this starts
629.84s: getting our brain tailored towards pattern recognition.
633.20s: That serves you massively in the long run.
636.24s: So I highly encourage you to include that section.
638.56s: The next we have this is actually backwards.
641.92s: Boom, we're back at it and it's fixed.
643.52s: So what we look at in the third section is analysis.
647.04s: So in here, I'm looking at things like just how do I think about
651.12s: conducting analysis.
652.48s: And for me, I actually have a video coming out soon on
655.12s: technical analysis, but I'm very interested in having an
658.64s: efficient process, meaning I start with really big filters
662.00s: that get rid of most things.
663.60s: And then I hone in over time to the best possible tools for me
668.24s: to look at products for me to look at.
670.00s: And the reason for that is because there's a lot of things
671.84s: out there to trade, but I tell you what, you can get rid of a lot of them.
674.48s: Again, as an options trader, if they don't have options, boom,
676.72s: get rid of a ton of stuff right there.
678.00s: Stuff like that.
678.80s: So my overall guidance here for section 3a is think about how
683.04s: you can do whatever you do efficiently.
685.04s: And then when you look at technical analysis tools,
687.36s: fundamental analysis tools, I have kind of sub sections under each of these.
690.96s: I have what tools I use and then I kind of created a
694.16s: library of everything that I've experimented with.
696.56s: And that's on purpose.
697.52s: The reason being is I'm able to tie things I've tested to an actual
702.32s: note section on outlining what the tool is and then what
706.16s: my experience was using that tool.
708.48s: So then if I ever want to go back to the archives and say,
710.96s: hey, maybe I'll dust this one off and try it again.
712.88s: I'm not starting from scratch again.
714.40s: I can literally recall all of these different details.
717.68s: And again, you could start with the simplest things for technical analysis.
721.04s: You could start with trend lines and just write out how you think you will use them.
725.76s: This all feeds in and evolves over time.
728.48s: So don't get overwhelmed up front.
730.16s: And then systems, this is actually where I capture
732.56s: no entire trading systems.
734.32s: Can slim, for example, that goes into my analysis tool.
738.56s: You can put that wherever you want really.
740.08s: But that's where I track notes on known developed systems for me to reference.
745.68s: That's all now trade checklist.
747.28s: Super simple.
748.08s: This is just where I write out a generalized three and post trade checklist.
751.92s: The reason why I use the term generalized is because each strategy
754.96s: will have specific things that matter to it that belong in the individual trade checklist.
759.84s: But there are things that apply to everything.
761.76s: So when I think about generalize pre-tree checklist,
764.08s: it's literally things like looking at the broad stock market
767.12s: and seeing what the overall trend is.
768.96s: What is the trend of the sector that you want to trade
771.92s: or the stock that lives in that sector?
774.48s: What's that sector doing?
775.52s: Stuff like that is earnings coming up for the product that you're trading.
778.40s: Are there any announcements?
779.60s: All of those kinds of things fall into the general category that apply
783.28s: to literally every single thing that you put on.
785.44s: The idea here, Edmund, no, don't make this massive.
788.72s: Because if you make your pre-imposed post trade checklists too big,
791.92s: you're not going to do it.
792.80s: You're just not going to do it.
793.76s: So make this efficient.
795.84s: Put things in there that matter to what you're doing.
798.16s: But don't put stuff just for the sake of it.
800.40s: Again, because you will lose adherence.
802.56s: Now, portfolio management, this is a big section.
805.04s: This is where I break down allocations.
807.60s: So that's how I split my portfolio into core inspeculative.
811.28s: I have a video on portfolio management that talks about this stuff.
814.56s: But this is where I get into detail on how do I treat my core allocations.
819.60s: How do I treat my speculative allocations?
821.52s: How do I allocate money from the entire portfolio into those two buckets?
825.52s: How do I think about risk management?
827.12s: There's two levels to risk management in my opinion.
829.68s: There's the portfolio level that applies to everything you have on your book
833.04s: at a given point in time.
834.08s: And then there's the individual trade risk management protocols.
837.60s: I define that stuff here.
838.96s: How I think about utilizing the account.
840.88s: And then what metrics I need to track in order to assess my performance
845.60s: in service of this desired end state and my objectives.
848.96s: Again, don't let this stuff overwhelm you.
851.12s: If this section seems way too massive, way too much stuff going on in there,
855.04s: literally just put risk management and think about how you're going to manage risk in your
858.88s: portfolio because you need to do that no matter what.
861.28s: Now, let's take a look at strategy outlines.
863.04s: You'll notice over here that there's actually kind of a section.
866.24s: And for each strategy outline, there are a handful of key sections that I look at.
872.48s: This says that there's more or main sections.
874.96s: And I actually think that that's correct because there's the executive summary setup
879.68s: management and analysis.
881.12s: This fifth section can be tied either to the individual strategies or later down the line
886.56s: actually in section seven, which is notes and RFIs.
889.36s: So this is kind of like a bonus section.
890.88s: But these are the main pieces to a strategy outline.
893.52s: The executive summary literally is like the acid test.
896.40s: This is, do you understand how this strategy works?
899.52s: It should be three to five sentences in outline exactly how this thing makes money
904.56s: as if you're explaining it to a child.
906.32s: This is purposefully designed to just make sure that you have a solid
910.48s: understanding of what this thing is.
912.16s: The second section here is the setup.
914.00s: So this is what we're looking for.
915.84s: How this thing makes money.
917.20s: How do we scan for whatever the strategy calls for?
920.08s: What technical, fundamental analysis indicators are you going to use?
923.68s: And what do you need to see from them?
925.44s: How do you expect to allocate money to this strategy?
929.20s: How do you expect to outline your initial outlay?
932.40s: How much money you're going to use up front?
933.68s: And then any scaling protocols either in or out?
936.88s: All of that should be built out into your setup section.
940.16s: Management is exactly what that sounds like.
942.08s: How do you intend to manage the trade throughout the life cycle?
944.80s: There's kind of three main things you can consider.
946.88s: There's time bound management.
948.64s: There's profit management, loss management.
951.12s: You can start with those sections
952.48s: or you can take a look at what I have here for your own.
955.04s: But again, this is forcing you to think through how you're going to manage this position
959.20s: before it goes on.
960.08s: Even before you like find what's going on for this position,
963.84s: you should have all of this outline for yourself.
966.08s: Analysis.
966.80s: So when we're building out our trading log
969.12s: and we're making sections for each of our strategies,
972.48s: this tells us what details matter for this strategy.
977.04s: For example, if I'm trading zero DTE,
979.92s: SPX, variance risk premium strategies,
982.64s: so call it short strangle, short straddles, zero DTE,
986.08s: I really don't care what the one your trend is.
989.28s: I really don't care.
990.40s: I might care what the five day trend is
992.72s: or what the average daily range is.
994.72s: Those might matter to me.
995.92s: I also might care about the variance risk premiums,
998.24s: IV versus HV.
999.52s: But then if I'm trading something like ratio diagonals,
1002.56s: I don't really care about IV versus HV.
1005.04s: So this is where we put down what things matter to our strategy
1009.84s: and how do we track them.
1011.04s: This is what's going to feed our trading log setup later.
1014.72s: And then again, this RFI tracking section,
1017.20s: I'll pull it up over here as well.
1018.80s: But in terms of the individual strategies,
1021.12s: this is just what do you want to test for that individual strategy?
1024.08s: Maybe you want to try instead of your DTE, five DTE.
1026.80s: Maybe you want to try 14 DTE.
1028.72s: This is just where you hypothesize different permutations
1032.08s: of your strategy and then you test them.
1033.92s: Now in terms of the broader trading plan,
1037.12s: this notes an RFI section,
1039.36s: I highly encourage you to actually start with this first one,
1042.48s: which is a self assessment.
1043.68s: Sounds super lame, boring, esoteric, whatever.
1046.48s: The reason why this is important is because this forces you,
1049.92s: also how do you like that arrow right there?
1052.32s: Really nailed that, didn't I?
1053.84s: I'm using the mouse, so chill out.
1054.96s: Oh, that's not good either.
1055.92s: There we go. That's better.
1057.04s: You must be chill, Vian.
1058.40s: The reason why this is so important is because it starts
1060.72s: to force you to look at yourself
1062.56s: and start analyzing yourself.
1064.08s: If you're going to do this long term and be successful,
1066.08s: guess what you need to do.
1067.04s: Analyze yourself.
1068.00s: If you think about the difference between different traders,
1071.52s: we all have access to the same tools.
1073.60s: You have the same platform I do.
1075.12s: You now are going to have the same trading plan outline that I do.
1078.24s: You're going to have the same technical analysis tools
1080.24s: that I do, so on and so forth.
1081.52s: Yet there is such a massive variance in performance.
1085.76s: What? It comes down to the individual, to the trader.
1088.56s: So this is where we acknowledge that aspect.
1091.68s: And we try to find things that we're good at.
1093.84s: And then specifically for our weaknesses,
1096.32s: we need to make sure that it doesn't impact our trading.
1099.04s: And if it does, we need to create known controls about it.
1102.32s: So what I mean by that is if you're impulsive,
1104.08s: if you go into things too quickly, this is where I would literally
1107.32s: list that out as a weakness, I'm impulsive.
1109.28s: I tend to do things without fully analyzing them.
1111.76s: To control this, I'm going to force myself to complete the pretrait
1116.00s: checklist for every position I put on before entering the trade.
1119.28s: Something like that.
1120.00s: Also in here is where I'm going to list out my performance reviews.
1123.68s: I like to look at my performance every single month, kind of an in-depth deep dive.
1127.36s: So I literally just write down, you know, for September.
1130.64s: This is how I did.
1131.44s: This is what worked well.
1132.32s: This is what didn't work well.
1133.36s: This is what the market did so that I have a log of what works when.
1137.28s: Then I also have kind of this section for audits.
1140.80s: This is kind of important to include because I believe it is really wise for
1146.00s: traders to embrace external audits.
1149.36s: Have other people look at your shit and give you feedback.
1153.60s: If they start reading through your trading plan and they're like,
1156.32s: hey, well, what do you do in this scenario?
1158.16s: That tells you that you're not defining that quite well enough and you
1161.52s: probably should think through it because if there's too much variability in
1164.88s: your capacity to deploy, there's a good chance that you are going to pick
1169.20s: route A sometimes route B sometimes and then you're not going to understand
1173.12s: what works best over the long run.
1174.96s: Now, let's take a look at the trading log very quickly and then a couple of
1178.16s: last things beyond that.
1179.12s: The trading log for me is super simple.
1180.80s: I use Excel.
1181.60s: You can use Google Sheets.
1183.28s: You can automate some of it if you're so inclined.
1185.84s: I do, but I really am an advocate of the process of
1189.68s: inputting the trades.
1190.72s: The reason why I'm an advocate for that is it gets you closer to the data.
1194.32s: As compared to just porting things over via an API or something like that.
1198.32s: Now, I have the first tab is just kind of a portfolio summary and different
1203.12s: calculators.
1203.84s: So that's actually what this is right here.
1205.60s: Just literally summarizing the portfolio.
1207.68s: I have a binomial tree calculator here.
1209.60s: This is kind of like a workshop version.
1211.60s: I'm actually looking at producing a version of this for the Patreon family.
1214.64s: That's what this is.
1215.52s: It's a work and progress variant of that.
1217.20s: But I have things like how the market is doing year to date,
1220.16s: stuff like that.
1220.80s: And then I also have different calculators,
1223.36s: expectancy, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1224.72s: This is something you can build out over time.
1226.48s: The reason why I like the portfolio summary section, though, which will live over here
1230.40s: is because it summarizes the key notes from the individual strategy tabs.
1235.60s: So the reason why I have individual strategy tabs is because the things that I need to track
1240.16s: are different.
1240.80s: And it's very difficult to combine all of that into one tab.
1244.48s: So each strategy has its own tab.
1246.80s: And that's it.
1247.36s: So all of the individual strategy tabs then feed into the portfolio summary.
1251.20s: And then I have another section where I run different studies.
1254.64s: Maybe you're curious how a 50-day crossover works and you start back testing it.
1259.76s: Well, don't just do that and not track what you're doing.
1263.52s: Because then that data is only as efficacious as your memory is.
1267.20s: Don't do that.
1267.92s: What you should do is consider something like this,
1270.96s: like this, where you track the results of your study.
1275.04s: Now you have a reference point.
1276.56s: It might not be perfect.
1277.68s: It might not be the best study on planet earth.
1279.84s: But it gives you something.
1281.44s: Again, when we're going through this trading log,
1283.68s: it gives us an opportunity to validate strategy performance.
1287.12s: We get to see how our portfolio is behaving.
1289.36s: And then we get to test our hypothesis in quantify the outcome.
1293.44s: Because lots of people have very rosy recollections
1297.20s: about how good things went when really they might not have gone that well.
1301.12s: So it forces us to reconcile that.
1303.20s: So those are trading plants.
1304.64s: Strategy outlines, trading logs.
1306.24s: I talk about these all the time because they are absolutely pivotal.
1308.96s: It is work, but it's something that evolves over time.
1311.84s: So you don't have to get stuck in the mud early on.
1314.32s: Start simple and build on it.
1315.84s: If you have any questions, comments, concerns,
1317.84s: anything that you want to dive into a bit further,
1319.92s: let me know.
1320.72s: This is where traders are made.
1323.28s: This is where people become outliers by doing this work.
1328.64s: Be an outlier.
1329.44s: See you guys later.
