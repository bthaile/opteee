480.00s: trading is easy money and that they don't want to do the work. For me, I was overwhelmed
483.96s: because I thought it was too hard. So there we go. Joey is starting to click in a level.
489.96s: The reason why clicking in a level here and getting to positive attribution of why people
494.36s: don't do it is really important for you, the individual, because they're going to be
499.78s: points in your options trading journey where you're trying to figure out what to do next.
504.24s: And you might have an idea of what you're supposed to be doing, but then you're overwhelmed
508.32s: or there are other reasons as we're talking about that people might not actually do what
511.88s: they're supposed to do.
514.64s: Joseph says they don't know what to log. I think it's a big part for sure.
519.04s: Reese says most people aren't trading systems just slaying in them trades. I agree with
523.20s: that as well as you know, here's the reality. Think of the underlying assumption and it actually
528.36s: goes back exactly to what Joey was talking about. People think trading is easy money.
533.32s: So if we get into something with the mindset of it being easy money and then we start to
538.12s: see elements that require work that becomes a direct affront to the original idea, the
545.08s: original intent to what we're getting into this thing for which is easy money.
549.56s: The highlight here is that for most people by coming into the world of trading with that
556.16s: mindset of fast easy money, it sets you down in entire skewed cognitive path for things
563.56s: that once you break out of that, make a ton of sense. And the example I gave during the
570.04s: stream that we went over this was imagine Apple was imagine you're a stockholder, you own
575.80s: Apple stock and you're an investor and you want to invest in the company. You believe in the
582.84s: long term growth of the company. So you're not just a trader. And during that earnings call,
587.48s: Apple's asked like, how did you do last quarter? And rather than having a comprehensive
593.96s: audited financial report and presentation to give you, they have none of that. And they essentially
599.56s: say, oh, it went really well. We came up with some new ideas and we sold some phones and computers.
604.52s: And we actually have these new AirPods that also sold in some the person on the phone on the
609.40s: earnings call. It's like, well, that's great. That's awesome. That's fantastic. How much money
612.68s: you guys make? Well, I'm not really sure. I think we did pretty well on the phones. The headphones
618.44s: also sold really well. But yeah, we made a lot of money. Oh, interesting. So of those different
627.24s: things that you sold, which ones sold better, I really don't know that it doesn't matter. We made
632.44s: money, right? You get the point. If the company tried to do an earnings release, what traders tried
637.80s: to do every day with respect to their trading approach, nobody would invest in those companies.
644.52s: Nobody would invest in Apple if that's how their earnings release went because you can't trust
649.56s: the company. So then taking that back to trading, tracking is essential. Most people don't do it
658.12s: because they're under the guise that this thing is going to be easier than it is. So why do that
664.04s: extra step if you think you can get by without doing it and still get the outcome you want?
670.84s: So it's that dissonance that leads to it. The reason why this is important to you is because
675.24s: throughout your entire trading career, your brain is going to try and find the easy offshoots.
682.12s: What's the Pareto principle? We can apply here where essentially we get 80% of the results from
688.28s: 20% of the inputs. The answer to that is through investing. That's the Pareto principle with respect
695.00s: to markets. With respect to trading, you give up the Pareto principle. You now are in the game of
701.56s: actually making money consistently through markets. There isn't a Pareto principle for that. That's
707.56s: investing. Next question. How can we create an aligned approach to trading starting from long-term
719.24s: goals? There are a few things that really blend in with this. So what's your answer to that?
728.60s: Like let's say somebody came up to you and they said, oh, I want to start trading. What do you
733.16s: say to them? Because for most people, they would start giving advice things like, oh, you should try
739.32s: looking at vertical spreads or you should try this other thing. And most of those people are giving
745.16s: terrible advice because they have no idea what the fuck they're talking about. And they're sending
748.76s: people down a terrible path. The reality is we have to start with some kind of goal. So how do we
755.16s: do that? How do we create a goal and then set up an aligned process so that what we're doing
765.40s: aligns with that ultimate goal? And there's some very specific steps we can take to do so. What are they?
774.92s: Dejean says trading plan. That's definitely one of them. And you're actually starting also to
779.56s: answer the second question here so we can kind of dual-hat do both of these at once. I think
785.00s: that that's fair about time to get this drawing pad out. So for this one, we already have one,
789.48s: which is the trading plan. So then talking about this idea of creating alignment, we have our goals.
801.16s: What else we got? From the end, reverse engineer, there you go. So Reese is exactly on top of it.
807.48s: What the reason why starting with goals is so important is because this informs everything else
813.32s: you're going to do. So let's say for example, your goal is to have X number of dollars in Y amount of time.
823.24s: The reason why doing this is so important is because if we have these numbers, we can now reverse
830.76s: engineer what needs to happen year over year on average in order to get from our starting point
837.48s: down here to our desired endpoint up here. This is different than what most people do. What most people
844.36s: do is they don't set goals. They start trading and think of the difference in an approach. If,
851.80s: for example, I know in order to make my 25% return on the year, which is a fair target for a
859.16s: season trader for sure, you're targeting your 25% on the year, you can break that down into smaller
866.04s: increments. And then you can size the portfolio based on what opportunities exist in the market at
873.00s: that point in time to make sure you're continually moving towards that goal. What you don't have to do
879.00s: is randomly put on trades, randomly take trades down and then kind of hope it comes out in the wash.
885.48s: In the military, we have another saying we use all the time, aim small, miss small. That means
892.28s: if you're aiming at a target and your goal is just to hit the paper of the target, you're probably
897.56s: going to be super inconsistent because you're not actually trying to hit a very pinpoint frame.
902.92s: You're trying to just hit the paper. So then you hit the paper here, here, here, and that's good.
906.92s: In trading, that equals variance in your returns. You can control that by aiming smaller dial in that
914.12s: target. So the way we create an aligned approach to trading is we start by defining our goals.
921.16s: Then we break these goals down in reverse engineer fashion into smaller mile stone targets.
929.96s: If I need X number of dollars in Y amount of time, and my starting point is Z dollars and T time,
939.00s: I now have literally a formula that I know I need to execute to get from here to there. If you don't
948.04s: do that, you have no idea what you're doing. How could you? Okay. So now the last question here
953.88s: really quick to finish the recap. Three planning tools we can use to add structure. You already
959.00s: hit one, which is your trading plan. We talked about our trading log.
962.28s: The way to think about this is, this won't be surprising. This one is the plan. This is the ideas.
974.76s: The trade log is the quantitative tracking.
983.32s: This is where we observe how the plan and how the ideas actually work. That's the difference.
991.80s: Trading plan outlines what we're trying to do. Trading log is the tracking component to it.
997.48s: And then you might be saying, well, what's the third? The third is what I refer to as the millionaire
1002.76s: road map. And this isn't some colloquial term. This isn't some move my head real quick.
1008.44s: So you can see check out that sloppy rating. This doesn't really mean anything.
1012.20s: The really what this is is your goals. I refer to it as millionaire road map to try and remind
1017.80s: people to think bigger because a lot of people start from the perspective of a constrained thought
1023.80s: I did in the beginning. And then it naturally slows you down on us unnecessarily. So thinking big
1031.00s: is good. And exactly what Joseph just said, Joseph says you can't change what you can't quantify.
1037.00s: And that's exactly correct. If there's not something for us to base our decision making off of,
1043.72s: it's just guessing. That's not going to work in trading. You can be lucky in trading. You can be
1050.20s: lucky for a long time. Not going to be lucky over an entire trading career. If you are in markets
1055.80s: for 30, 40, 50 years, your results are going to be the results of your process and your actual skill
1063.32s: set. There's no luck that's going to span that entire time frame. Not how it works. You can have
1068.60s: short run luck. You could be lucky for three, four years. That is a thing. You can be lucky even for
1072.92s: those longer durations. Going to run out. Okay. Great. So that's our recap quiz. Now let's take a
1080.60s: quick peek at just the actual recap notes for you. So you can see these are the things that we
1088.92s: talked about last time. We talked about the millionaire road mapping process. This is the begin
1092.92s: with the end in mind from the seven habits of highly successful people that's from Stephen Covish
1098.04s: we talked about how to create a trading plan outline with the key sections that belong in there
1104.20s: to give you a place to start. A lot of people say shit like oh, trade your plan. But then nobody
1110.60s: actually really takes the time to go into detail on how to make a plan. It's easy to say trade
1115.56s: your plan never deviate from your plan. But the free of question of course, if somebody's given a
1120.44s: plan that has natural positive expectancy, of course, it would be easy to follow it. Guess what?
1125.08s: All of the work is done in making the damn plan. So that's what we reviewed on the last session.
1130.76s: And then also we talked about what kind of metrics make sense to track in your log relative to
1137.32s: your plan. All of these things align with one another to give you a better idea of what you're
1142.28s: trying to do as a trader. Cool. Recap is on onto the agenda for today. And now is where we get
1150.84s: into the fun stuff. I got to update our little timestamp. This will be volatility
1160.20s: overview. So here are your TLOs terminal learning objectives again military term. This is
1170.28s: essentially at the end of the session what you will be able to walk away from with. And I also
1176.84s: want to include these questions here. And I want to capture any additional questions you have.
1182.52s: The entire purpose of writing them out here so that they're in front of us. And that means at the
1188.04s: end of the session, there will be an answer to every single one that we input here. So I saw one
1193.64s: earlier from Lauren. Lauren says an old podcast was this is Claire you both spoke about new traders
1198.60s: and the stock doing exactly what they thought, but they didn't make money. I'm glad I'm not
1202.52s: special, but can you talk more about why absolutely? This is actually great. So this is the concept
1207.16s: I refer to as right, but wrong. So definitely what other stuff do you want to add to this? Anything
1215.00s: else? Any other questions? And then I'll leave that we can continue updating it as we go along.
1224.92s: So don't worry if there's nothing that's like popping out at you right now. We'll be able to
1229.24s: maintain it, but at a bare minimum, this is what you will be able to walk away with. You will
1234.52s: have an understanding of how to integrate volatility into your trading process. You will understand
1241.48s: how skew impacts pricing. You will understand the correlation between volatility and price movements.
1247.64s: You will understand this concept of right, but wrong. What that is. So let's get into the big ugly
1258.92s: massive slide of doom. Now really the slide of doom hopefully is not a slide of doom. The reason
1265.56s: why I'm showing you this in a slide format is so you can take fucking screenshots so that you
1269.88s: have your own notes. That's why I'm doing this. So there are a lot of different elements of
1276.04s: volatility that are super important to us. We're going to start literally from the top and work
1280.20s: through quite literally all of it. So the first thing is what volatility is. Volatility is just a
1287.96s: term and volatility itself is a measurement. It's exactly what you see at the top of the screen
1293.80s: here. It's the time bound measurement of variance. And we'll get into what variance is in a little
1301.64s: bit. The easy way to think about something like volatility is simply how much we expect something
1306.76s: to move. Now there are other ways you can label volatility. Volatility is the way we talk about
1314.12s: dispersion from the mean in financial markets. We refer to it as volatility. So
1323.96s: as some of you may or may not know, there are a lot of different kinds of volatility. And I'm
1330.20s: listing out a handful here. We have forecast volatility. We have implied we have historical,
1338.12s: which is also known as statistical volatility. And then there's realized volatility.
1343.32s: So the one you're most familiar with in the concept of trading options is actually this one.
1348.92s: Implied volatility. And implied volatility is the annualized expected one standard deviation move.
1357.48s: And for those that remember the standard bell curve, about 68% of data is going to fall within one
1363.00s: standard deviation. 95% of data falls within two. 99.7 falls within three. So this is the majority
1371.40s: of data will fall within this move. That doesn't mean that the move is restricted to this level.
1376.36s: It simply means that this is what is expected within a one standard deviation probability.
1381.72s: And to give you an example of what this looks like, if I pull up Walmart,
1386.04s: could all fashion Walmart out here crushing it, take a look at the implied volatility 32.29%.
1393.08s: So this is exactly what we were just referring to. The implied volatility is a gross number as the
1398.52s: annualized standard deviation expectation. Oh, wrong spot. My bad. My bad.
1405.08s: I picked everybody out.
1407.80s: Implied volatility uses calendar days. This note is really important because you'll notice that if we
1415.16s: take a look at historical volatility, it uses trading days. You have to be aware of small details
1420.52s: like that. So if I'm trying to compare something like 30 day volatility with 30 day realize volatility,
1426.20s: you actually have to use 30 and 20. Otherwise, you're not comparing the same thing.
1430.92s: So admin note, one use in calendar days, which is IV, HV historic volatility uses trading days.
1439.00s: So let's talk about HV next. I know we skipped forecast. We'll get back to it.
1443.00s: Historical volatility is the actual movement of something. So the way to think about implied volatility
1451.00s: is really, really simple. If we have time zero, a key, this is the present. Welcome to the present.
1464.36s: Press, good old press. Then we have forward looking future. This is IV. Then we have backwards looking.
1475.72s: This is HV. This is the past. So IV is always forward looking. HV historical volatility is
1491.00s: always rear view looking. These are the primary volatility you care about from a retail trading
1498.44s: perspective. Now I'm going to review the other ones because I already told you and you could tell
1502.52s: probably from the discord on some of the things I was posting is I'm excited to talk about this
1508.28s: because nobody likes talking about this stuff. I can't like talk to my wife about something like
1514.20s: this because she doesn't really care about volatility and Thor is dead asleep right now and is
1520.28s: heated blanket. So I am a geek about options trading and this stuff. So it's very cool to actually
1526.92s: be able to talk about this and hopefully teach some people about some of these concepts.
1532.20s: So, applied volatility forward looking historical volatility backwards looking always. Next up,
1541.80s: realize volatility. Realize volatility you don't really need to worry about too much,
1547.24s: but realize volatility can be backwards looking or forwards looking. I know weird huh.
1554.60s: So backwards looking is akin to historic volatility. Now you can calculate the difference
1562.76s: between HV and realize volatility from a backwards looking perspective. There's a difference in
1568.36s: calculation. RV from a backwards looking perspective typically is going to use shorter term time
1575.16s: frames and then it's going to sum them up. It will use the log returns. Statistical volatility
1581.32s: tends to look at ranges total ranges. So they will yield slightly different results.
1588.28s: This is superfluous information for most people on the stream right now. This is just for your
1593.08s: information. Now, forwards looking volatility is where you get your healthy dose of a mind fuck and
1601.32s: you can't even realize volatility. And future realized volatility. Frv is a forward looking metric.
1608.52s: The fun part about frv is it can't be known, but it can be used to model decisions based on current
1615.08s: state expected forecast and future volatility. Not going to dive super deep into that because it's
1621.48s: not relevant to most of you, but you should know these terms. The main terms for you to understand
1627.32s: IV HV. You can understand that RV and HV are very similar, but there's a difference in the
1634.60s: calculation modality yielding slightly different results. Now forecast volatility.
1640.20s: Forecast volatility is the game that most market makers and institutions are playing trying to
1647.64s: figure out what is the correct current price for implied volatility. So implied volatility as
1656.92s: it sounds is implied. We extract implied volatility from an options price. You can use something
1664.76s: like the black shul's merton model to isolate all the other factors and to pull out implied
1670.12s: volatility. It's implied by the options price. Forecast volatility is the work of determining
1678.20s: what's input into the pricing model. This is something that most retail traders are not going to
1686.28s: touch. Now I will show you some tools that you can touch it if you're interested in tinkering with
1691.56s: it. But I can tell you from a broad sense, this is not going to derive you pretty much any edge
1698.36s: and the viability of you being able to price better than the broad market consensus is very low.
1703.32s: But it's still a fun exercise. And again, if you're going to take this stuff seriously and it's
1707.48s: going to be a significant contributor to hopefully your future income and your wealth, it's worth
1714.84s: knowing. It's stuff that I've all messed with. I'm actually going to show you in a little bit
1718.60s: how to build your own volatility calculator using a bunch of different models. So it's relatively
1725.88s: straightforward to do from those simplified volatility calculations, but it can get pretty heavy.
1732.04s: Okay. Any questions first on this idea of what volatility is and the types of volatility.
1744.20s: And while you're answering that or asking anything that you have, I'm going to update our notes.
1750.12s: types of volatility, which is implied volatility, IV, historic volatility, HV,
1768.12s: realized volatility forecast volatility.
1773.16s: Okay. So Joseph looks like he's set and it looks like everybody else is quiet. So I'm taking that
1783.08s: as we're good. All of this stuff makes sense so far. Again, please do not be afraid to speak up
1788.52s: if you're unsure. It's literally like straight up the perfect session, the perfect time to talk about
1795.96s: so now let's talk about implied volatility in markets itself and essentially the way that we
1804.36s: derive it and the way that we can assign it to different time frames. So if we take a look at the
1810.28s: platform, as I've already told you, this is the annualized volatility. Now there are different
1819.08s: periods of volatility we can look at. So if we come in here into the trade tab and if we take a
1825.08s: look at all of these different terms, all the different explorations, you notice how there's
1830.20s: different volatilities for all of them. 36.2, 23, 39, 34.8, 31.7, so on and so forth.
1840.44s: So the point that I'm driving home here is that volatility has a few different ways it can manifest,
1848.44s: but implied volatility can be broken down into all different kinds of time frames, which again,
1855.24s: I will show you in a little bit how to do mathematically, but you should know this to be the case.
1860.44s: So volatility, when we're quoting standard volatility like you see here, implied volatility,
1866.52s: this is annualized one standard deviation for the stock.
1871.64s: You can get way more specific and you should get way more specific. Again, if you're going to be
1878.04s: an options trader trying to figure out what we're trying to measure a move to be in or anything
1886.28s: like that, you can get way more specific and figure out the time corresponding to the move you
1893.64s: might be trying to trade and then you can see what the expected move is within that window.
1899.96s: This is going to blend into a topic called term structure in a little bit, but I know it's
1908.28s: like you're probably so excited to get into term structure. I am going to have to throttle everybody
1915.08s: back and slow you down, but don't worry, calm down. We'll get to term structure. It's probably,
1919.48s: I know, you just want to get there right now. It's kind of like being able to open Christmas
1923.32s: presents. This is essentially the equivalent of opening Christmas presents, I think, for an
1930.20s: options trader at least. We just talked about how implied volatility has various windows.
1939.00s: We can see that we can look at it for different expiration cycles. We can literally calculate
1943.64s: it relevant to any specific time frame. Now, we need to talk about different ways we can visualize
1955.80s: volatility. There are a handful that will be pertinent to you. So, volatility, we can look
1965.88s: at it in terms of skew. We can look at it in terms of smiles. We can create a volatility surface.
1973.08s: These are different modalities for us to visualize volatility. First, let's tackle skew.
1981.16s: If we take a look at an options chain, again, just sticking it with Walmart because we're here,
1990.36s: and let's take a look at the volatility. The first thing we have to do is try to normalize.
1997.24s: We have to try to find the closest like delta's that we can. So, I see a 10 delta call here,
2005.24s: and then I see an 11 delta put here. So, not exactly the same, but similar.
2011.32s: And if we take a look at these, first, let's start with the call. The implied volatility for this
2015.80s: call is 27.49%. Every single option is going to have its own implied volatility. Now, to help you
2025.96s: visualize what the smile is, if you take a look at this entire column of implied volatility,
2035.16s: and that's supposed to be oval of sorts, you can tell. Just take a look at how all these
2042.60s: different implied volatility correspond to a strike price over here. So, we can plot this
2051.88s: in a 2D frame. We can have strike price down here, and then we can have vol over here.
2062.28s: So, then we can have 30, 35, and then I'm just going to skip a bunch. 70, 105, 130,
2073.96s: and obviously the real way to plot this would be to do all of them, but you don't have to.
2078.68s: So, at 130, we can see that the volatility here is 173. So, let's pretend that's way up there.
2084.36s: At 35, we can see it's at 155. So, let's pretend it's somewhere around there.
2089.64s: 70 is at 64, so that would be about half of that. That would be kind of down there.
2095.96s: Then the 105 here is at 26, but it should be down there. And then the 130s are now at 34, so a
2105.80s: little bit higher over here. So, here's your smile. And I will show you another way that we can
2116.28s: view it in something like think or swim, but before I have to open the door for Thor, because he's
2120.12s: losing his damn mind because it's about dinner time. All right. The beast is about to be fed,
2137.24s: which is better for everybody. We don't want a hungry beast rolling around. Okay, so first,
2143.80s: any questions on the timeframes we reviewed and this concept of SKU. Right now, I'm showing you one
2155.72s: type of SKU. There's other we're going to look into, but I want to see if this so far makes sense.
2161.48s: Good. This stuff will slightly expand on one another. So, here we're looking at, oops,
2179.24s: I don't know my drawing tool. Here we're looking at a smile.
2181.80s: For SKU, we want to take a look at the relative volatility between calls and puts. So, here,
2195.40s: we have the 115 call, and this is marked at a 27.5% vol.
2203.00s: If we take a look at the 11 delta, put, which is pretty close, this is marked at a 31% vol.
2214.60s: So, what this is showing you that right now on a relative basis, the puts are skewed. The puts
2235.16s: are priced more expensively than the corresponding delta of out of the money calls to out of the money
2244.52s: puts. This is normal. More often than not, you will see the volatility on the put side skewed.
2255.56s: This exists because we tend to fear the downside more than we fear the upside. And people are
2265.72s: willing to essentially overpay to protect to the downside. So, this is typically what you will see.
2273.88s: This is not always the case. There are lots of anomalies all over the place. We'll look at some of
2277.64s: them. But the concept of SKU here is talking about the relative price for the same delta,
2283.80s: same expiration cycle between calls and puts. Okay. Last visualization tool I want to show you
2293.40s: is the surface. Now, for those that don't know, typically when you get an implied volatility surface,
2301.80s: it's 3D. And I'll show you, you can make them pretty easily. It's not difficult to make.
2313.48s: You can make them in Python. The whole idea of an implied volatility surface is it allows you to
2322.84s: visualize all of the different strikes and you can tell it moves you into three dimensions.
2328.76s: You don't actually have to visualize it in 3D to see the same information. This here is a volatility
2335.48s: surface. It's just in 2D. So, let's get rid of all of these different series. Let's trim it down
2341.88s: the fewer series. We have three series now. This is a volatility surface. There are several data
2347.96s: points here for you to take away. On the Y axis is the out of the money implied volatility. The
2354.28s: X axis is the strike price. The multiple lines are different expressions. So, we have the same
2360.92s: 3D inputs that a surface has. It's just a different way to visualize it.
2365.88s: Now, the whole point of a volatility surface is to be able to make comparisons between volatility
2371.64s: across strikes, across explorations. And that's exactly what this is designed to do.
2377.56s: So, for example, we can take a look at the 21 March exploration cycle when we can see that this
2383.56s: looks really different compared to what you're seeing on the 21 Feb and the 17 April.
2390.60s: Do we know why? No, not upfront. We don't. But once you understand what these tend to look like,
2396.92s: it'll give you some ideas on maybe what we should go look at. Is there anything potentially going on
2402.20s: during the exploration cycle of 21 March? Well, if we take a look at earnings that has earnings
2408.04s: on the 20th. So, you can see right now, volatility is really, really high for this front
2416.20s: expiration, the 21 Feb, on a relative basis. The other thing you can see is that there are certain
2423.00s: strikes that are really elevated compared to others. So, within this 21 March exploration,
2430.60s: this 62 and a half strike is really elevated compared to right next to it at the 60 or right next
2440.52s: to it the other direction at the 65. So, there are different ways that we can use that information
2448.92s: to come up with trade ideas. You can play the relative value between strikes. So, an example of that
2459.00s: is let's say I think that this 62 and a half is expensive and I think that this 65 is cheap.
2466.12s: I can sell the 62 and a half and I can buy the 65, make a vertical and I can play it from the
2474.12s: perspective of trying to isolate the difference between these. Now, for retail trading is very
2479.32s: difficult to actually isolate volatility completely. You have to delta hedge, gamma hedge, and then even
2485.00s: with doing that because of the carrying costs, it's essentially an imperfect game. And unfortunately,
2490.52s: we don't have access to variant swaps. Those are custom products that are built by banks at the
2496.20s: request of different entities, but variant swaps are cool because they actually fully and truly
2501.88s: isolate volatility, which is really, really solid. So, now, we understand the various visualization
2516.04s: techniques for implied volatility. The next thing we have to talk about is the standard
2523.16s: behavior of volatility. But before that, questions. Anything that we talked about so far that
2533.32s: you're unsure of or that you want to dive in to deeper. And then I'm obviously updating our notes
2541.16s: so far.
2550.20s: Dejan says puts in normally skew to protect portfolios from a black swan event. It's not necessarily
2556.60s: that in and of itself just to be clear, but it is the fact that people are generally willing to
2561.80s: hedge to the downside. That's completely accurate.
2573.16s: Reese says, prior question is this all based around one standard deviation. Which stuff are you
2577.56s: talking about? Sorry, I think I got to that question a little bit late.
2584.44s: Reese, when you say is this all based around what standard deviation, what do we, what do you
2589.56s: refer into there? And then I got to get my dinner order ready to launch.
2607.96s: All right, it hurts something like IV is based on one standard deviation. Yeah, so annualized
2614.36s: volatility. So when you see the implied volatility for a stock, that is the annualized expected move
2621.64s: within a one standard deviation framework. So that doesn't mean that that is essentially what's
2628.60s: going to happen. It simply means that that's again within one standard deviation. That's the more
2635.16s: probable scenario, but you can have bigger moves that fall outside of that pretty easily, actually.
2645.08s: So it is that's what implied volatility when you see it quoted for the stock.
2652.52s: Reese says, so does looking at two standard deviations, everything is way different. It's about double.
2657.64s: So if I wanted to know what the two standard deviation expected move is, or Walmart relative to
2667.88s: what this is saying, meaning 32.2%. We can figure out what the expected price range is for that at a
2674.60s: one standard deviation. You multiply that price range by two. And then you have two standard deviation
2679.72s: confidence interval. Good question. Sweet. Onward, we go. So now we're at 44. We'll just call it 45 minute.
2697.72s: We have to talk about some of the key behavior of volatility. The reason why this is so important is
2703.56s: because volatility has some of the most predictable movement patterns that exists in markets.
2713.88s: So we have to acknowledge that so that therefore we can try to take advantage of it.
2719.40s: So volatility is mean reverting. Valtility is a true mean reverting asset, unlike price.
2727.08s: A stock is not mean reverting. It can have mean reverting tendencies in the short term.
2735.16s: But stocks typically exhibit drift, which is kind of the antithesis of mean reversion.
2743.08s: Now to help you visualize this, let's take a look at an example. If I zoom this out to, let's do five
2751.64s: year weekly. What do you notice for Walmart? It's gone up, right? I can see that this is a standard
2759.08s: deviation channel. And I can see that most price falls within the standard deviation channel, but not
2764.68s: all of it. And if I take a look at the slope of the standard deviation channel, it's 70 up here and
2772.84s: down here, it's 35 and a half. So about doubled for a comparison. Let's take a look at VIX.
2782.20s: VIX, instead, if we take a look at the difference between here, which is 29 and down here, which is 12.
2790.20s: This is actually a really big change relative for VIX. We'll probably have to zoom this out a little
2794.92s: bit more. And that's mostly because of what happened during COVID, that kind of anomalous experience.
2799.32s: Let's move this out further. So moving it out to 10 years, you can see that the midline, the mean,
2807.64s: or VIX here is 1632. And then up here, it's 2072. This is over 10 years. And if we use the same
2816.92s: example for Walmart, take a look at the difference. Walmart starts down here at 15. And over that same
2824.52s: time, frame, it's now up at 67. Here's what's happening. Price exhibits drift. This is due to the
2831.32s: expansionary properties of our economy and companies, the ability for them to continue making more
2836.84s: and more money over time and scaling. Voltility is completely different. Voltility, any time it goes up,
2844.60s: it will come back down at some point. It will every single time. It's just a matter of when,
2850.28s: how much and how far and those kinds of things. But volatility is a true mean reverting asset class,
2856.84s: unlike stocks, stocks exhibit drift. Another thing that you'll notice about volatility as compared
2864.92s: to stocks, similar to stocks, but different than stocks is the propensity for clustering.
2871.24s: What this means is volatility tends to hang around where it is until there's some sort of catalyst
2878.36s: for change one way or the other up or down. And then when that change happens, that's a transition
2885.16s: period. Then post transition period, volatility tends to cluster for some duration of time.
2890.44s: And then it goes through another transition period before it continues the mean reversion process.
2895.32s: So this is a great example of it. Now, you can just visualize this and come up with some general
2901.24s: ideas. This is a five year weekly chart. One of the things I can tell you is that it doesn't really
2907.80s: look like when it's in these really elevated positions that it stays there for that long. You notice
2912.36s: that it can go and spike massively, but it doesn't really stay there. It tends to hang out there for
2919.80s: a little bit of time and then move. That represents a variance in the duration of clusters. I get
2927.16s: open the door for Thor.
2929.16s: So Thor is now ready. He does have dinner breath. And he's prepared to continue talking to us now
2951.00s: about the clustering properties of VIX. Is that right? You ready to talk about the VIX?
2956.60s: He's ready to talk about them. He's not released. All right.
2970.04s: So clustering, that's the propensity for what you see with respect to volatility to tend to be
2979.16s: very similar to what it was prior. And then sooner or later, there will be a transition period.
2985.88s: And then post transition period, there will be another clustering component.
2996.20s: This is something that can be traded and is often traded. There's one other behavior that we
3003.16s: need to talk about, which is the correlation to price. So let's take a look at this. There's a
3010.12s: really common misconception. Let me know if you've heard this. That if price goes up, volatility goes
3018.84s: down. Or if price goes down, volatility goes up. Have you heard this before? I imagine most people have.
3026.68s: It's a massive misconception. And there's a very specific reason why. Now we're analyzing
3037.56s: two different things in confusing them. Okay. So Reese has heard that before. Reese, were you aware
3044.20s: that that is a complete fallacy in a nutshell? There's truth to it, but it's a misconception.
3053.24s: Did you know that that's a misconception? And to help with that,
3061.56s: let's do this.
3067.64s: Let's eyeball. So what I'm showing you, exactly. So Reese is on it. It's a general observation.
3082.84s: It does happen pretty regularly, but it's not a causal relationship. Remember, the context of
3092.52s: volatility is the expected deviation of something. So if we expect something to move a lot,
3101.72s: that's not specific to whether price is going up or if price is going down, you can have price
3109.88s: go up and things still become more volatile. It happens even in SPX. There are clear periods in time
3119.48s: where volatility has gone up and price goes up. There's also clear periods of time where
3124.68s: volatility goes down and price goes down. That's less frequent, but it can happen.
3129.00s: So the general observation is that as price goes down, people become more nervous. People are
3135.48s: paying more now for options because of the downside risk. And that tends to increase over
3142.28s: volatility. But it's not a prescriptive rule. There are plenty of times that you will see
3148.52s: volatility move independently or directly correlated, depending on what you're looking at over what
3154.68s: time frame to the index or whatever is related to it. Lauren says, how much can volatility go
3162.28s: up or down in a day? There's no real bound volatility itself can be whatever it is. So you can
3168.36s: have stocks that are really cheap that have hundreds of percent of volatility. So yeah,
3174.44s: there's not like a ceiling or a floor. Well, I guess floor zero would be the floor for volatility,
3179.56s: but as long as anything is still actively trading on the market, obviously wouldn't be zero.
3188.44s: So the general tendency to be aware of is that volatility absolutely will normally
3194.20s: contract as equities go up or the equity it's tied to. And then same thing inverse to the downside.
3201.40s: Now, another really, really common misconception is people that are using the VIX and comparing it
3207.32s: to other stocks. The VIX is the volatility index or SPX. It's literally the implied volatility
3216.76s: for SPX. If you look at the price of VIX and you look at the implied volatility for SPX,
3222.92s: your mind is probably going to be slightly blown. So right now in VIX, the price is 1654.
3229.56s: If we take a look, I got to move this thing.
3236.44s: If we take a look at a normal chart of SPX, what do you notice that the implied volatility is?
3243.32s: 16.58. That's all VIX is. VIX is the IV for SPX. So we can use VIX as a proxy for things,
3255.88s: but VIX itself is simply tied to the S&P 500. It's not descriptive for every equity,
3264.28s: every ticker that's out there. Because once you get into individual tickers, you now are
3268.12s: introducing individual stock risk, idiosyncratic risk that comes from different things. Did
3273.72s: Palantir get the new contract at WANET and so on and so forth. So the way to think about implied
3279.16s: volatility is that it is a me, it's true, mean reversion. It has clustering properties.
3285.80s: There is a relationship between volatility and price. However, it's not a causal relationship.
3291.24s: You can have price go up and volatility go up. You can have price go down and volatility go down.
3295.64s: Volatility is literally the expectation of movement. That's indifferent to the movement of
3302.44s: price up front. It's not tied to one another intuitively. So they can move in line with one
3310.12s: another, but they can also decouple. So that wraps us up with the behavior of implied volatility.
3319.08s: Now, this gets a little deeper. I don't want to go through this now because we don't have that
3324.52s: much time left, but I want to show it for your consumption. So there are a lot of different
3330.92s: Greeks. For those that don't know, I have a video that talks about the Greeks in detail.
3336.44s: But here, you can see there's first order Greeks, second order Greeks, third order Greeks,
3343.56s: so on and so forth. And as we get into these higher order Greeks, you have more things that
3350.12s: pertain to volatility. So you have things like Vama that starts to pertain to volatility.
3357.00s: You have Veda, Vera, so on and so forth. So these different kinds of Greeks can help us understand
3364.84s: additional changes beyond the standard Greeks. The only reason why I'm flagging this to you is that
3369.48s: there are quite a few of them that help us understand the movement of volatility beyond Vega.
3376.04s: Vega is the one you will be most familiar with. But things like Vama is actually really important
3382.20s: or essentially you can have the Veda of Vega, which is Veda.
3389.72s: So on and so forth. Okay. Now, another thing to know about volatility is that it is really
3396.44s: relative to itself in the individual underlying. So you can have underlying, let's take a look at
3403.48s: an example. Again, we have Walmart. In Walmart, as a 32% implied volatility and the 96% implied
3412.60s: volatility percentile on a 15% implied volatility rank. This is actually a great example of why
3419.08s: implied volatility rank is such a terrible metric. The difference between implied volatility
3424.36s: percentile and implied volatility rank is pretty simple. Implied volatility percentile
3430.12s: takes the current implied volatility for the stock and it divides it by the total number of
3437.56s: periods that you're looking at. And it counts for the numerator, the number of days where volatility
3446.12s: is lower than where it is right now. So what this is telling you for the past year, 96% of the time
3453.32s: volatility was lower than what it is right now. This is an example of volatility being very
3459.16s: high on a relative basis, the Walmart. Now, the reason why implied volatility rank is all the way
3467.24s: down at 15% completely different. And the reason is in the way it's calculated. Implied volatility
3475.40s: rank takes the current implied volatility, I guess I could draw it out. Might be easier.
3481.00s: I was going to just do like hand gestures, but that's probably less useful.
3487.24s: IVR equals current IV less 52 week, IV low divided by 52 week, IV high less 52 week, IV low.
3513.56s: So the reason why I do not like implied volatility rank is because it anchors off of these extremes.
3528.76s: And this. And that anchoring is a massive, massive problem. Oh, my bad. I just realized that
3536.52s: this should be high. My bad, my bad, my bad. This is 52 week high, not low. I was wondering why that
3541.24s: looked weird. So it anchors off of the extremes. So then it completely removes the nuance. And again,
3552.52s: the nuance here is if we take a look at IVP, this is simply the count of days with lower IV than today
3564.68s: over the period. And in this case, we typically use 252 for a year. So what this is telling you is
3577.72s: implied volatility rank is telling you, well, compared to this anchor, this 52 week high,
3584.76s: current IV is actually pretty low. But it removes the nuance. Maybe this 52 week expected
3594.20s: or I'm sorry, this 52 week, IV high is from 50 weeks ago. That's pretty stale at this point.
3604.60s: So it starts to overweight these anchors, very prone to skew. So the whole idea here between IVP
3614.76s: and IVR is to place implied volatility relative to itself. Because a 32%
3623.00s: vol in Walmart, as we just mentioned, represents a 96% IVP. If we look at GameStop,
3632.12s: we have a 72% implied volatility. This is literally double that of Walmart. Take a look at the IVP.
3641.88s: It's fucking 1%. It's about as low as it can possibly go.
3651.40s: That's the big difference. So I really prefer implied volatility percentile,
3657.80s: but both of those are designed to help us put the context around implied volatility
3665.16s: specifically in that of relative to itself. So that's the next part of our TED Talk.
3675.72s: So that was at 55, 10. This was implied volatility percentile and rank. Cool.
3686.44s: Now, the last thing I want to walk you through is a few different ways that we can use
3694.04s: and calculate volatility. And there's a few different ways you can go about it. I'm not going
3698.84s: to spend a ton of time on this because I imagine most people won't really care that much.
3707.64s: But I want you to at least be familiar with the process. So we're going to talk about calculating
3713.00s: historic and implied volatility. So the way that we calculate historical volatility is
3725.88s: multifaceted. There's different ways we can do this. So we first need to gather price level data
3733.40s: and a good example of that is what I did here. So this is in Palantir. And all I did was grab
3742.04s: price level data. And this price level data is from bar chart. So I just go to bar chart,
3747.64s: download it and then dump it in here. And then you'll notice over here, I have a bunch of
3751.48s: different calculations. I'm looking at things like the ranges for different periods of time.
3757.80s: I'm looking at highs, lows, overnight moves, the day of the week, weekend moves. This has everything
3766.12s: to do with the way that we can get more and more specific with respect to how we're measuring
3771.48s: things. But going back to the original concept that we're talking about here, you got to get the data,
3778.60s: then we can calculate the log returns on a daily basis. And you can calculate them in different
3784.76s: ways. And again, depending on the model that you use, it will change what data you calculate.
3791.24s: So Yang's aim calculates the open high low close and includes overnight movements. Parkinson
3797.48s: is intraday and it uses high and low and so on and so forth. There's different base models to work
3802.92s: off of. Once we get the daily log returns, then we calculate the mean for the period. So what I do
3814.28s: is a little bit different, but we can calculate the normalized returns here. That's what this is.
3819.72s: And then we can, what I like to do is split it out by two different time frames. And this sheet is
3829.80s: designed to be able to look at the entire population data level statistics. And then it can also look
3837.32s: at sample level statistics. So sample level statistics is let's say I wanted to isolate periods
3843.48s: within this just out of my own curiosity. I can do that by inputting different dates here and
3848.68s: here. It will populate a different period for me to analyze. This is just extra stuff that you
3853.24s: can build in over time. So once we have the mean for the period, then we calculate the variance,
3861.56s: which is the average squared deviation from the mean. Now the reason why we ask, well, the reason
3871.08s: why we do it in this way, the reason why we use log returns versus arithmetic means is because
3877.64s: two things, it normalizes percentage moves just like a log chart does. And then they're also additive.
3884.04s: So it's easier from a math perspective. The mean is just the average. We know why we do that.
3889.56s: The variance, we're essentially looking at dispersion from the mean here. And there's a reason why we
3896.12s: square it. So let's say that this is our mean. This is our line of best fit. And then we're measuring
3901.96s: each data point and its relation to the mean. One of the things that becomes burden some mathematically
3913.48s: is you have something that's plus 2% and then something that's minus 2%. So the whole point of
3920.44s: squaring it is it normalizes all of this so that you don't have to calculate it two different
3926.60s: directions. The other thing is that you can keep it in a variance fashion to really exacerbate
3935.72s: the movements to make it easier to see. Now most of the time, and especially when we're looking at
3940.84s: markets, we take the square root of it. And the whole point is to take it back down to volatility.
3948.36s: This is the actual standard deviation. This is actual volatility at this point. So once you get
3954.04s: your data, you do your log returns, you calculate the mean, you calculate the variance, you do the
3957.56s: square root of the variance, that gives you volatility. So essentially we put all these up, the power of
3964.60s: two, we get all our numbers, and then we square root all of them when we take them back down to the
3970.20s: base level metric. So this is what volatility is measuring. It wants to know how far apart are we
3978.12s: from the average? Are we far apart? Are we close? That's how we calculated. Now again,
3988.36s: we can then use different kinds of inputs to help us calculate forecast volatility. Now for
3996.04s: forecast volatility, you'll see that I have Yang, Zhang, Parkinson, Garmin, Klaus, all these over here.
4002.76s: These are actually all historic volatility calculations. But you have to start from a historical
4011.08s: perspective if you're to try and forecast future volatility. Now what most institutions will do
4020.04s: is actually use Garsh models. And you can get way more specific with Garsh models. There's EGarsh,
4028.28s: EGarsh, you add jump diffusion to count for big overnight or just big, powerful moves and stuff
4033.48s: like that. So this is where it starts to get obviously more heavy. But you can create a very simple
4040.44s: historic model based on this stuff, no problem. And then you can come up with basic ideas. So here
4045.40s: you can see I've already calculated things like Garmin, Klaus, Yang, Zhang combined. This is kind of
4053.32s: the one I would use personally. If I were to use one of these models, this is an easy starting point.
4058.76s: And the reason why this is important is because if you use something like Roger Satchel or if you
4063.80s: use close to close or if you use Parkinson, they isolate different variables, but they drop points
4070.12s: off that matter to us, even from an intraday or multi-day basis. So this is essentially a few
4077.32s: different ways that you can calculate your own historic volatility and then ideally use historic
4085.56s: volatility to help you postulate what future volatility might be. Riz says what's Garmin and all
4094.20s: the other names. So there's Yang, Zhang, there's Roger Satchel, there's close to close, there's no name
4100.44s: for that. It's just close to close. There's Parkinson and then there's Garmin, Klaus. And again,
4108.12s: the primary one that is probably worth tinkering with is GKYZ. And GKYZ is you probably would guess
4115.80s: combining Garmin, Klaus with Yang, Zhang. Now you can create all different kinds of tools and stuff,
4123.32s: whatever floats your boat. This one is I built this more just for a general project, right? Just to
4129.00s: help people visualize stuff. And to give you an idea on how you can essentially build your own. But
4144.20s: Riz says I don't know what any of those mean. Great question. Thank you for asking. So the purpose
4150.20s: behind these different methods of calculation is essentially they're trying to calculate volatility
4158.04s: using different inputs. So for example, close to close. This is essentially taking the close data
4169.64s: between days. And that's what it's using to calculate the volatility. Parkinson uses a different
4178.12s: series of inputs high low or open close or open close high low to calculate its volatility.
4187.00s: So the different names are essentially just different approaches. It's the mathematicians who
4192.36s: came up with the approach. That's why it's named after them. So one of the reasons why
4197.96s: and I gave you kind of like a cliff notes version of that in here. So you can see Parkinson's is high
4203.32s: low. It doesn't have any overnight moves included in the calculation. Garmin, Klaus uses open high
4209.24s: low close no overnight moves. Yang, Zhang essentially uses open high low close includes overnight returns.
4216.28s: And then we can combine this and this into GKYZ. But the whole point behind that is just to have
4229.08s: different ways to calculate it. Riz says, okay, slightly different variations. Well, slightly
4236.60s: different in the concept of it's not like completely different, but the differences between them
4240.92s: are massive just to be really, really clear. So like the difference of including overnight returns
4246.84s: versus not is is tremendous, very, very big. So Shreys says, jump diffusion reactor in my spaceship
4257.40s: is broken hook a brother up. Yeah, man. So you always hate it when the flux capacitor glows out
4263.56s: and the jump diffusion starts to die off. It's one of the worst things. Hate literally hate that.
4268.20s: So I wish there was more we could do for you in your time of need. But yeah, this is essentially
4275.64s: the ins and outs of volatility. Now, one last thing I want to talk about before we wrap up
4283.00s: is just some really, really basic volatility calculations. So let's update our thing useful
4292.28s: volatility calculations. And this is pretty easy. So we know that when we get implied volatility
4302.20s: from a platform or something like that, again, it's typically 30-day annualized. So then we can
4308.28s: do some math to figure out. Sorry, I'm just responding to no.
4328.20s: Okay. So you can essentially transform the volatility into different periods.
4338.20s: The platform already does that for you. Most platforms already do that. So you can already see
4343.00s: the volatility for different periods. So you don't even have to do this. But you should know
4347.56s: that it can be done. And this is exactly how you do it. You can take the implied volatility,
4351.80s: you can turn it into a one-day expected price move. The way you do that is you take the current
4357.96s: stock price times implied volatility times the square root of 252. Then you can come up with
4363.96s: a one-day estimate. One-day estimate is taking stock price times IV divided by 16, or you can take
4372.68s: the reason why 16 is just one over 16 is like one day over 16 or one day over 252. The square
4380.68s: root of 252 is about 16. So it's just a quicker way to get to the number. Then you can look at one
4388.20s: volatility by taking instead of the square root of 252, the square root of 52, and one month by
4395.00s: taking the square root of 12. Then as we talked about before, we can calculate different standard
4402.12s: deviations by taking the expected move. For two standard deviation, you multiply the expected
4407.96s: move by two. For three standard deviation, you multiply the expected move by three. Obviously,
4412.60s: it's going to increase the range of the expected move. But then it'll increase the probability of
4417.24s: it falling within that range, the standard deviation that that expected move will cover.
4421.48s: And then the last thing to talk about here is a couple different calculations or permutations
4427.96s: to track things like variance risk premiums, which are actually quite relevant.
4432.04s: And that's essentially the difference between implied volatility and realized volatility.
4436.84s: And you could do it a couple different ways. And I was going to show you those here.
4441.24s: One of the ways you can do it is by creating a ratio. You can also calculate it just by taking
4451.24s: implied minus historic. And that'll also give you a different metric. But IV bias is essentially
4459.96s: taking the implied less historic divided by historic. So if this number is positive, it means that
4468.28s: volatility is relatively expensive. If it's not positive, it means volatility is cheap relative
4475.64s: to the moves that are being produced. So just two different ways you can calculate either
4480.60s: the difference between implied and realized or you can turn it into a little bit of a ratio
4486.20s: if you're so inclined. So a couple of little calculations for you. If you're interested in trying
4494.76s: to transform the expected move calculations into different time frames and then the same thing
4500.44s: for the IV bias. A lot. A lot. But volatility is literally the lifeblood of options. If there's no
4509.80s: volatility, there are no options. We need volatility. Whether you buy or sell, you need volatility.
4517.48s: So without volatility, you don't have things that move. And we need movement to occur.
4525.08s: So I will take a pause there. I will see first how you're holding up. And then more importantly,
4531.32s: I want to see if anybody has any questions about what we talked about. If there's any
4538.20s: elements that you want to dive into a little bit more, anything like that, let me know. And I'm happy to.
4545.40s: And
4546.12s: and
4554.12s: Reese says in all this just because we have an expiration date, definitely. And early exercise,
4559.88s: the fact that it's a contract is a little tricky.
4562.44s: And
4564.44s: Paul says do you ever use other volatility benchmarks such as VIX, D VIX 1D VVX? Of course. Yeah.
4571.64s: So there's a ton. I also use the volatility metrics between different indices. I'll use
4578.84s: volatility metrics for commodities. I'll literally use essentially every form of volatility I can
4584.84s: get my hands on. And it's because quite literally all of them help us. Literally all of them help us.
4591.08s: Now it can be slightly superfluous. You don't necessarily need all of it. But yeah, definitely.
4597.72s: They all have their use cases for sure.
4605.32s: Anything else you guys got? I hope this session was good. I know that there's a lot in here.
4609.48s: I mean, I really took quite a bit of time to build this one for you all to try to make it as
4614.68s: packed with information as I could for you because there's a lot to potentially take away from
4620.92s: the world of volatility with respect to trading. And it goes back to what we said in the beginning.
4626.28s: No matter what you do, you're taking a stake on volatility. So if I buy an option,
4631.64s: it doesn't necessarily. I'm inherently saying I think volatility is cheap. But it does mean that
4638.36s: if volatility moves while I'm in the trade, there can be a problem, which takes us back to that
4643.24s: original question from Lauren, which is which we never fully answered. And I actually want to
4649.08s: circle back to that really quick, which is this idea of being right but wrong. Let's take a look at
4655.24s: what that might look like. So let's take a look at we'll go back to Walmart just because it's a
4661.56s: little more normalized in terms of volatility. And let's create a little drawing. And Lauren,
4670.28s: this is to try to help you with that idea of right but wrong. So let's take a look at Delta
4678.28s: here in Vega here. There's Delta. Here's Vega. So let's say, for example, that we buy this call,
4689.72s: which is what is this one, the 115. So we buy to open the 21 March, 115 call.
4703.00s: And we pay, let's just call it 42 cents.
4708.44s: Now this has a Delta of 0.10 and this has a Vega of 0.06.
4719.72s: So let's say that we get a plus $1 move, but a minus 2% move in volatility as this is happening.
4735.56s: Here's what happens. Your plus $1 move, this gives you plus 10 cents.
4740.84s: Your minus 2% volatility during that moves move gives you negative 0.12. So if I net out these two moves,
4756.20s: you come out at negative 0.02. This is before we factor in theta, which is another negative 0.02.
4768.20s: So once we include theta, you're now at negative 0.04. Here's the scenario that just happened.
4777.16s: The option, the stock went in your direction. You bought a call. It went up. The stock went from 115
4789.24s: to 116. Objectively, in terms of price, it did exactly what you wanted. It went exactly up.
4800.44s: However, if volatility changes by just 2%, right now, vol is what? We said it was like 32%.
4808.52s: I think so. If vol changes by less than 10%, whatever reason, vol contracts, you lose.
4817.56s: Then you add time on top of that. You lose. So the whole point of buying options is you have to
4826.20s: account for these other factors, these other factors being Vega and theta.
4833.24s: So that then you can make build trades. That makes sense. This is why for those that follow most of
4841.08s: my work, you know that I buy options that are greater than 60 days out. The reason why we go
4847.72s: greater than 60 days out is because what was the delta of that just at a curiosity? We'll use the same
4853.00s: delta for that 115, the 10 delta. So let's go out here to 133. Let's find a 10 delta. Notice the
4861.16s: difference in this 10 delta that's now out 113 days. What do you notice?
4869.88s: If I buy to open, let me use a different color. It might be easier to see. If I buy to open
4877.40s: the 20 June, 10 delta, and I'm going to pay, let's call it 70 cents.
4891.16s: Let's take a look at the same exact scenario. So stock goes up by $1 and then volatility goes down
4901.40s: by 2% and time passes one day. Okay. So stock up a dollar that gives us our 10 cents.
4914.28s: Valtzility down 2%. If we check our Vega here, it's 11. So now minus 0.22.
4931.64s: Time passes one day. You lose a penny. So what's happened here? We've lost
4941.08s: 23 cents. We've gained 10. So we're negative 13 cents. What the hell happened?
4956.20s: It's because your delta is so low. In order for you to make money in this trade,
4966.44s: the entire concept of getting such a low delta is your banking on a big move. You need
4973.64s: it's a requirement. You need a big move. Now let's take a look at one more scenario.
4981.80s: And I think I have some room over here. And let's build a trade more similarly to how I build
4988.68s: trades using 70 delta plus. So same thing, but in this case, we buy a 71 delta.
5000.92s: So this is our delta. Our theta is negative 0.03
5010.44s: for that one day. And then we're looking at the similar 0.21 negative 21 cents.
5019.32s: So here's what happens. From here, we lose 42 cents. Here, we lose 6 cents.
5029.96s: So our total loss is 48 cents. But we make 71 on that dollar move.
5040.12s: So what's happened here? We have the same exact move in all of these different scenarios.
5046.60s: But by picking the correct option, we actually made fucking money on the idea.
5055.40s: So this is why in options trading, it's not just a function of trying to trade something
5061.00s: directionally. It's also a function of this severity of the expected move. Because if I think
5067.16s: something is going to move a lot, I can make more money by going further out of the money and
5072.04s: buying way more of these. But I need a big enough move.
5079.56s: So this is why building your trades and using the Greeks to optimize your trades is a non-negotiable.
5089.00s: And as you probably imagine, we have a video on this. Let me grab that.
5093.80s: Right here.
5104.76s: Bingo. So that there is how you can use the Greeks to optimize your trades.
5116.12s: So yes, you can be right, but wrong at the same time. And that's typically a result of
5123.96s: honestly being stupid. You don't have to do that. You just have to make trades that are
5129.32s: designed smarter. And this is why we talk about that quote-unquote outlier strategy process.
5138.92s: Because if you don't have a clear understanding of what the effect is that you're trying to trade,
5145.64s: the probability of you magically just picking the correct options to capture it is about zero.
5151.40s: It takes very little effort to take a look at a trade, take a look at a perspective idea,
5156.68s: and then to postulate how you might be able to trade it. But you have to actually take the time
5162.28s: to know what the fuck you're looking at. So now we know how to integrate
5170.76s: volatility analysis into our trading process because we now know the differences between
5175.08s: implied and historic. We know the propensity for puts to be priced heavier than calls.
5180.12s: We know how to look for relative volatility values and find things that might be priced
5187.80s: relatively off compared to surrounding option. We also now know the impact of Vega and other Greeks
5194.36s: on the movement of a position. We understand SKU. We looked at that one directly. We understand
5199.32s: that volatility and price movements do have a relationship, but it's not causal. You can have
5204.52s: then move correlated, not correlated, inversely correlated. Most of the time, they're inversely correlated,
5211.64s: but it's not most of the time like 90%, it's like 75%. There's a fair amount of time where it's not so.
5218.76s: And then we just reviewed a specific example of being right, but wrong with your trade.
5225.08s: And that's something that will happen to beginners. Once you are generally
5230.52s: a bit beat under you, that doesn't really happen as much. So that's where we're at.
5241.48s: Any final questions, anything else that we didn't cover to drive the TLOs for you, any other
5248.92s: misconceptions that you might have heard about volatility that you want to take a second to take
5253.32s: a look at together. I'm happy to do either of those for the last few minutes that we have together
5259.64s: because, as you know, volatility is the lifeblood. This is what we do. We need to know about volatility,
5268.04s: and it shows up in a lot of different ways. It actually reminds me, I need to build a video
5276.92s: about avoid being...
5279.48s: I'll probably do that right after this, actually.
5291.16s: Tommy says, generally speaking, what is the market indicating when IV contracts? Example,
5296.52s: Ibit Valtilities contracted. Great question. What does implied volatility measure?
5303.32s: This is for you, Tommy. What does implied volatility measure?
5315.40s: Okay. So if we see volatility contract, what can we deduce that the market is telling us?
5326.12s: And this isn't like put you on the spot or make you feel silly or anything like that.
5330.12s: I'm just trying to help you connect the dots because the concepts that we're talking about here
5337.16s: is exactly what it is. Bingo. You got it. The market expects lower moves, smaller moves,
5343.48s: in the underlying. That's exactly correct. Now, we can take it one step further and try to figure out
5348.76s: why the market expects slower moves. It could be potentially because there's an abatement of
5356.36s: an expected volatile event coming up that's gone away. You'll see this happen all the time in
5362.20s: earnings releases, for example. Something as an earnings release, volatility would be very high,
5367.64s: pre, and then it goes through that volatility contraction. People call it volatility crush
5372.68s: through earnings. And that's because now post earnings, we don't have that event anymore.
5378.68s: So great question. That's exactly what it is.
5381.56s: David says, I blew my account selling zero DTE spreads following some YouTube guys safe levels.
5389.96s: I mean, how long have you been trading, David? I need to figure out what my response is going to be to you.
5401.40s: And I think most people that are familiar with my work probably know the different response
5407.64s: levels that that could happen right now. Let's take a look at this.
5416.84s: There you go.
5421.24s: So David, how long have you been trading options?
5430.20s: Out of curiosity.
5431.40s: And while we're hanging out here, just kind of doing a bit of a Q&A, we might as well grab a drone video.
5445.72s: Right. Take a look at which we look at. Take a look at Iceland.
5457.32s: I have to kill the volume.
5469.96s: There you go. At least have something nice to look at while we bullshit.
5475.96s: Oh, you said 10 years.
5477.16s: Well, anyways, if it's 10 years, then obviously you get the place, stupid games, when
5488.28s: stupid prizes.
5490.04s: The here's the thing. If you're approaching trading in any way trying to trade someone else's
5499.00s: book, just think like just think of the design of that. From the onset, it's designed to fail.
5508.04s: So I is ridiculous as it sounds based on what you wrote, right? You can take away like,
5515.16s: how silly that is to follow somebody's quote unquote safe levels from YouTube.
5523.00s: Now, this isn't to make you feel bad, but there should be an element in your brain that's like,
5527.96s: yeah, this was fucking dumb. And the reason why that's important is because then the probability
5532.76s: of you making similar mistakes going forward if you don't do that is probably pretty high.
5538.44s: And you don't want that. You want to avoid that. So yeah, obviously pretty silly choice on your
5546.12s: behalf. Now that being said, you asked if we could talk about stop losses, which is a great question.
5551.24s: So this video talks about stops. And essentially, I very rarely use stop losses.
5558.84s: I will use them for certain strategies. But for most of them, I use manual stops.
5566.76s: And I'll show you what that looks like. So if we pop back over to the platform.
5572.36s: And let's say that there's a trade in Walmart. There's not right now, but let's say there was.
5576.76s: And let's say that the trade was based on this movement here. Well, in this movement here,
5582.44s: I might use a mental stop where if it falls below here, I'm probably going to get out.
5589.32s: And then I'll set a hard stop at some other point, maybe down here, which is no matter what happens
5596.52s: if it gets here, I'm out period. And then I need to size the trades so that these levels make sense.
5603.08s: So let's use a $100,000 account as an example. And let's say that we do this thing we come in here,
5608.84s: like we talked about before, and we buy the correct call because we're smart and we understand how
5614.44s: markets move. And then we add these two price levels. So the price first price level we're looking at
5620.04s: is 9990. And then the second price level we're looking at is 96.2. What's the loss at both of these?
5631.16s: If we have a $100,000 account, we can risk about $1,000 per. However,
5638.44s: for $1,000 per, that means both of these are in play, meaning we're in an okay amount of risk
5647.32s: for both of these levels. We can even size up a little bit. So we can size up to a three lot
5653.96s: if we're going to use our soft stop then hard stop. So this is a way of setting like a mental stop.
5659.08s: Now here's the problem. Just because I have a mental stop set and I have a plan to get out,
5663.16s: it doesn't mean it can't gap. It can gap. So this is why you still have to size smartly.
5669.88s: And this is for one approach. Another approach is the recent trade that I put on in Palantir.
5676.12s: This is being managed by size. So it's designed to be a longer term play. And the short term movement
5686.36s: is of less interest to me. So this is here not to stop out. This is here for my awareness
5694.36s: so that if it falls below this, I might choose to add more to the position. If it consolidates and
5701.00s: behaves and yada yada yada all that stuff. So that's another scenario where I'm essentially
5707.32s: managing risk by size. And then when I'm trading things like zero DTEs and trading earnings plays,
5715.00s: I can rest stops. But the only kind of stop that makes sense is the stop market.
5721.88s: Now the risk with the stop market is you can get terrible bills. I have examples from my zero DTE
5730.84s: trading where I have had insane, insane examples of awful bills because end of day liquidity is
5741.56s: starting to tighten up and those kinds of things. And that is a potential. But the whole point of
5748.36s: a stop, that's where we're saying I need to get out here. And if you do something like a stop limit,
5757.64s: then you might not get out. It might blow by the limit. And then you're still in the very same
5761.88s: trade that you said you need to get out of. So that's really bad form. So if I'm using a stop,
5768.60s: it's a stop market and it's understanding the fact that stop market orders suck. And the
5773.08s: overwhelming probability is if I get a fill on that stop market order, I'm going to get a terrible
5777.08s: fill so that needs to be accounted for in the way that I build a strategy. So yeah, stops are
5785.88s: fine. You can use them. You have to understand the way that they're going to interact with the
5790.44s: position. And even if you have stops, you have to account for big moves. Things like, let's say,
5797.24s: for example, that I sold calls in this. And let's actually see if we can take a look at it on the
5804.28s: third. I'm wondering if enough time has passed. This would be really cool. If we could take a look at
5809.48s: this together from the third, oh, great, we can. So let's go to the third. And let's just say for
5816.28s: whatever reason in Palantir, we're like, ah, you know, earnings is coming up. I want to be really
5821.96s: bold. And I want to actually fade this to the downside because I don't think it's going to be a good
5828.52s: trade. Okay, fine. So now here's what we have to account for. The first thing is we need to
5835.88s: account for what the volatility is, which we can see if this thing chills out. If this thing
5841.48s: chills out. Okay, I can't see that well. So the volatility is around five and a half percent.
5847.64s: That's what this thing is showing us, right? So the average daily range is five and a half percent.
5853.40s: The average true range is about 5.14 percent. So we really actually care more about the larger of
5861.08s: these numbers, whatever's more volatile. So in my mind, I need to account for at least a five and a
5867.08s: half percent move when I put this on. So let's say we go in here and let's say we either sell calls
5872.52s: by puts, it doesn't really matter because the sizing discussion is about the same. So let's say
5881.96s: we choose to buy puts. Now, one of the good things about buying a put is what? If I buy a put,
5889.24s: the risk is defined on the entry. So if I come into this 17 April, because it's greater than 60 days,
5897.16s: I'm not planning on holding it for too long. I come in here. I grab something like
5901.88s: the 95s, whatever. And I choose to buy this. And then we have to make it the same day in here,
5912.36s: which is February 3rd, no matter what my risk is defined. So if I have a $100,000 account
5920.12s: and let's say, okay, I'm going to plan for a perspective five percent move on top of this,
5927.72s: by the way, is also terrible form because you actually have to use the earnings move,
5932.12s: not just the average daily range. So I'm talking about average daily range for kind of average moves.
5938.68s: Let's take a look at the earnings moves. What I'm doing is I'm signing into O rats.
5948.20s: Let we can see what to expect.
5958.12s: So if you come in here, it doesn't have to be O rats. You can use anything. Think or swim has
5961.96s: this. It's just the on demand tool is broken for looking back in time. So if I look back in time,
5967.32s: I can literally see that it's had up moves that are 20% plus. I've seen an up move that's 30%.
5975.16s: So that tells me if I'm going to try to fade this through earnings, I can't plan for a five percent
5980.60s: move. I have to plan for something that's much bigger than that. And if I take a look to the
5985.48s: upsides, like the average upside gap is like 20% percent. Whereas the average downside gap
5992.92s: takes us down to 20% once. And then the rest are around 10, 12, 15. So this tells me that there's
5999.88s: significant upside move potential. I would absolutely plan for something 25, 30% to the upside.
6006.68s: So let's take a look. Let's see if I'm comfortable with a 25 or 30% upside move.
6011.88s: So if we take a look at a 30% move that takes us here to 107. So let's model that. Let's say,
6024.04s: all right, my stop is going to be placed around 107, planning for this potential upside move,
6031.16s: that makes the trade lose $1,000. I'm okay with this risk.
6036.44s: So then maybe I set my mental stop at this 107 handler this year.
6046.04s: I input in alert. I don't think you can in on demand. So pretend I input in alert just like this.
6054.04s: And then if that alert is triggered, I'm going to go and close the trade. So now let's fast forward
6058.20s: the trade a day. Funny enough, and I actually did not know exactly where it landed.
6067.00s: But funny enough, this is actually in line with expectations based on that earnings move.
6072.04s: So I can base the trades in this example. Now, again, even if there's a stop involved,
6077.96s: I can plan for some of it. Now the difficult stops are the ones that creep up or gaps, I should say.
6084.12s: They can creep up out of nowhere sometimes, but this is where sizing becomes really important in
6089.80s: a historical understanding of the ticker that you're looking at is really, really important.
6095.48s: So yeah, it's not perfect, but obviously we can't know, but we do need to pay attention to
6102.68s: perspective sizing so that we keep ourselves safe. All right, a couple more.
6108.52s: Dejean says, what are your thoughts on using chat GPT to help build custom things,
6115.00s: script codes or to enhance volatility awareness? Sure. Nothing wrong with that at all.
6118.84s: I think you just have to understand that chat GPT is imperfect, right? So you have to make
6123.72s: sure that whatever chat GPT gives you were at least vetting because it's going to be imperfect.
6130.04s: But yeah, there's nothing wrong with that at all.
6132.12s: Shreya says, do you think an increase in volatility for indices impact its constituents,
6138.44s: or do they have individual product? I'm curious of trading shortfall for earnings in a specific
6143.32s: company on a day when index vol increase could have the extra juice. You actually have it flipped.
6151.48s: So if you think of it from a trading perspective, the index vol is built from the constituent
6159.64s: now it's not perfect, but essentially it's the inverse. So
6167.08s: if you have something like an individual ticker that's going to be idiosyncratic risk,
6172.04s: it's not really going to care so much necessarily about the index vol,
6175.72s: unless the index vol is showing you something more market-wide than sure from that perspective.
6182.36s: But it's not so much the index vol popping leading to an increase in individual
6187.88s: constituent vol, it's kind of the inverse. Now for those that don't know, there is an entire
6192.20s: style of trading designed around this exact thing. That's why it's pretty efficient. It's called
6196.20s: dispersion trading and institutions do this all the time. So from a dispersion trading approach,
6202.60s: what you're doing is you're calculating what the actual volatility should be for each stock
6208.28s: in the basket of stocks relative to the index and then you trade that dispersion.
6214.52s: So there are a lot of institutions that trade that exact thing which keeps it priced
6219.00s: typically pretty good. So another really good question.
6226.12s: Cool. All right, gang, really great questions. I'm glad that you guys had some interesting
6231.08s: stuff to talk about towards the end. It's always fun to take a peek at those. A lot. I know that
6235.56s: this is a lot, but this session is super important because volatility is the heart and soul
6241.40s: of what we do. So now let's take a quick look at what's coming up next.
6247.32s: So we just knocked out option volatility. The next one we're going to talk about is the
6254.52s: Greeks. So we're going to dive into a little bit of an overview of the Greeks and then more
6260.28s: importantly, how can we practically apply the Greek? So that wraps us up. And then for the skills
6268.12s: development, we just knocked out the strategy process overview. And I'm going to go through and see
6274.44s: what other things we want to add. This is actually a great time to ask everybody here for the
6280.92s: for the skill development. Are there any specific trading skills that you are trying to work on?
6286.76s: Because if so, I can add them to our list. And then this is what we cover on the Wednesday session
6293.08s: for everybody. This is just open, fair, open game for discussing the elements of skill development.
6300.28s: So if there's any specific skills that you're trying to develop, throw them in the chat.
6303.80s: Happy to dump those in here. The next session that we have on tap for this is again going to be the
6311.16s: Greeks, which is next Friday. As always, if you have any questions or anything you want to cover,
6317.80s: let your boy know via an outlier. Let's see you guys later.
