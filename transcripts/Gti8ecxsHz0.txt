0.00s: Hey everybody, as promised I have another video comparing the VIX to the VXX.
6.84s: Volatility is awesome, they're products that I really enjoy, they're very nuanced.
12.60s: I'm actually talking with one of my friends right now who spend a lot of time learning
17.56s: about volatility so I'm hoping to have him come on and talk to us a little bit about
22.20s: what he's learned, bring some of his experience to the table as well because I absolutely
26.20s: respect his opinion on this stuff but to kind of prep us for that conversation and
32.18s: settle up on a couple basic, similar similarities and differences between the two, I figure
40.16s: this is a good place to start.
41.32s: So first we have the VIX and then the VXX, they are different, they are similar but they
49.08s: are different.
50.68s: Let's start with the similarities and then I'll branch into the differences.
54.68s: So both of them have options available to trade on them, they both track in some capacity,
62.52s: the volatility of the S&P 500, they both are mean reverting and they both find expansion
74.26s: with heightened volatility and then they both tend to fall with lower volatility and another
82.20s: thing that's not on here but it's just the velocity of movement.
85.72s: If I pull one up just for general context, let's do the VIX, I'm going to zoom out a little
93.76s: bit, this chart's a little close.
96.88s: So you can see it went from essentially $14 to $85, that is a parabolic style move and
106.52s: both of these products will have movements like that due to their structure.
112.00s: They rise and fall rapidly with changes in volatility.
116.68s: So now let's shift over to the VIX, some trade that are specific to the VIX.
121.40s: The VIX has no underlying, so what that means is there's no stock, you can't trade the
127.88s: VIX itself and I can show you this because if I pull up the VIX, there are options but
137.96s: notice how there's no bid, there's no ask, there's no size, there's no volume.
141.96s: There's no underlying here.
144.20s: The only thing the VIX does is track the S&P 500 in 5 volatility and we can check that
152.20s: out pretty easily because, so right now the VIX is at 28.22, so if I type in the SPX
159.08s: and then I go to its volatility, we see 28.13.
167.92s: So it tracks the S&P 500 in this instance, the SPX volatility.
175.60s: It does have VRO settlement on one base which is a little bit different than most options
182.84s: and ETFs, ETN stuff like that.
185.96s: So not really, I truly impact the one but one that's good to know.
191.00s: So then if I move over to the VIX, unlike the VIX, the VIX has an underlying, there is
199.20s: stock.
200.70s: So if I pull this up, we can see that there's a bid, there's an ask, there's a size,
204.64s: there's volume, there's all these components of an ETF, an ETN.
209.60s: The difference between that is the fact that part of your strategy depending on your disposition
219.64s: towards it, you can include holding an underlying.
223.72s: Now VIX is a forward looking projection of the VIX.
230.60s: So VIX, VIX, the VIX tracks the current S&P 500 volatility.
238.64s: VIX is a forward looking projection of VIX.
245.20s: Like a lot of other ETNs that we see, it's a futures-based product.
250.12s: So that means that it's in a portfolio that uses futures to track the price of the VIX.
257.12s: So it uses forward slash VIX futures.
260.52s: And what that means is it's very susceptible to drag.
264.32s: The reason being is that means every single month it'll look at two different futures.
269.52s: So I can actually show you.
270.92s: So if I pull up the VIX.
273.84s: We can see that there's the front month, which is the closest to expiration contract.
279.88s: And then it uses the next month.
282.08s: So the following expiration.
285.52s: And as you'll see, there's the difference in price here.
288.08s: So right now we actually see a little bit of backwardation where the further out futures
294.40s: are a little bit cheaper than the current futures.
297.00s: So there's no drag here.
298.52s: However, if these are switched, which they typically will be because we are generally in
303.12s: a state of contango, which is where the further dated futures contracts will be priced more
311.76s: expensively like these.
314.12s: So what will happen when we're in contango is when we get the expiration, we have to close
321.36s: out this front month, pay whatever it is to close.
325.76s: And then we have to establish a new position in the further out month.
331.40s: So if you can see the difference here in this exact scenario with the VIX, we would have
336.32s: the portfolio will have these May 20 futures.
341.64s: And then it'll also have this first expiration for June 20 futures.
346.32s: So as soon as it's time to roll these May 20 out, we have to buy the next June expiration,
352.84s: which we're trading for $31.25.
355.04s: So if we're going to close our current position at $29.95 and then establish a new one buying
360.20s: at $31.25, you can see we're paying more than what we're getting over time that erodes
366.44s: the value of the product.
368.56s: So that's why you'll see reverse splits and stuff like that over time to keep the product
374.08s: in existence, essentially.
376.64s: The VIX, because it's an ETN, it settles Friday.
379.08s: So normal sentiment there.
382.12s: And then something else that is of no is that the VIX tends to have slightly lower volatility
389.64s: than the VIX.
391.88s: And the reason for that is because if we're talking about the same delta option.
396.48s: And the reason for that is because the VIX is made up of both front month and the following
403.60s: month futures.
405.08s: So there's a little bit of a buffer decreasing some of the typical gamma risk and things
410.52s: like that.
411.52s: And it's specifically Vega risk in this instance, which is changes to apply volatility.
417.48s: So VIX has a little bit of a dampened sensation for that due to being spread across two different
423.44s: expressions.
425.04s: So I like to trade the VIX personally.
427.04s: It's got really good volatility.
429.52s: It does suffer from decay.
430.84s: So you've got to make sure you plan that into your strategy.
434.56s: I would never, ever, ever just be long shares of VIX for any period of time simply because
441.96s: if you sit there and you hold it while you're waiting for some sort of big pop and
447.44s: volatility, a lot of people try to do that.
449.08s: Well, if it goes from 13 up to 78, that's a ton of money you can make.
453.72s: It's absolutely true.
454.92s: And if you time it right, there's no doubt you would do well.
457.72s: But the problem is, is you can find yourself holding it for extended periods of time every
461.84s: single month, every month, really every week when we're rolling.
465.48s: You'll just see those options or the futures rolling out, causing decay, eroding the value
471.60s: of the position.
472.60s: So realistically, you're paying for it.
475.12s: You're not really having any sort of free lunch there just waiting for this big pop to happen.
480.08s: And then this is also the same exact reason why I always caution people against being short
485.64s: any sort of volatility product without coverage, meaning of spread.
489.44s: I like to sell calls, right?
491.08s: If I'm bearish, I think something's going to come down.
493.52s: And we know that this is a mean-reverting product.
496.56s: So you would better believe that when I see VIX at certain levels, I immediately take
500.40s: short positions in it.
501.92s: But it's always a short credit spread.
504.32s: So I sell and buy.
506.64s: And the reason is because of these binary movements, these huge movements can really hurt an account.
512.36s: Even though you'll know it'll come down at some point in time, if you're counting a
515.60s: margin call and you can't successfully add enough money to meet the margin requirement,
521.16s: they're going to force you to neutralize it at a bad time.
523.00s: So you're going to have to close those positions at a bad loss.
525.64s: So I just don't want to expose myself to any of that whatsoever.
529.40s: So I am always interested in shorting, stuff like the VIX and the VIX, when I see them
537.20s: at certain levels, certain highs.
540.52s: And that's great.
542.52s: However, always, always, always highly recommend keeping some sort of coverage to the upside
549.12s: risk because those binary moves can really, like I said, cause a tremendous change in
553.32s: your buying power requirement or your margin requirement.
556.48s: So that's kind of the big difference between the VIX, VIX in terms of the structure, how
560.40s: we can trade them.
561.40s: I absolutely, like I said, prefer the VIX.
563.96s: I find that the liquidity is good.
568.48s: And I like that there is an underlying involved.
571.20s: And I can also count on the decay or the drag over time, one more in contango, and I can
577.16s: see when that's going to happen and really increase the likelihood of it returning to
581.76s: a mean.
582.76s: So I can use some of those components to help inform my strategy and decision making.
586.68s: So if you have any questions on either of these, let me know.
589.68s: Great products to add to your toolkit.
591.48s: There are some nuances that you got to be mindful of, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't
594.52s: trade them.
595.52s: All right.
596.52s: I'll see you guys later.
