0.00s: Everybody, Eric here and I am really stoked for today's guest.
6.50s: So we have Natalie here and I came across her like quite a few people on Twitter except
14.00s: she is a lot of really awesome bit coin and cryptocurrency kind of content.
19.70s: So I'm really excited to have you here.
21.40s: Thanks for joining.
22.40s: Yeah, thanks so much for having me looking forward to it.
24.50s: Awesome.
25.00s: So first off, I think it's always really helpful just to level set.
28.70s: Obviously it's your first time with us on the channel.
30.70s: So I thought it would be really cool just to explore your background very quickly.
34.70s: So people understand your perspective, your paradigm.
36.90s: So really two main questions.
38.40s: The first question is, obviously you are very focused on Bitcoin cryptocurrency space.
44.70s: So the first question is what got you interested in that space?
48.70s: Sure.
49.70s: So a little bit about my background.
51.90s: I'm a first generation immigrant.
53.40s: My family came to the US when I was very little from Poland and my family wanted to
58.66s: look another book.
59.66s: So are you Polish?
60.66s: Yeah, it's my last name.
63.66s: So yeah, so I was born there and came when I was very little.
68.16s: We immigrated to Chicago where pretty much every Polish person moves when they come to the
72.52s: US and my parents came in search of the American dream.
76.76s: They grew up under communism.
78.26s: So they are really passionate about a sense of freedom, especially economic freedom and
82.96s: the ability to move upwards for social mobility.
86.86s: And so they thought that America would have a lot more opportunity and provide myself
91.56s: and my brother with a better education system and just more chances to improve our
98.64s: lot in life and be able to accomplish what we want to accomplish and become financially
103.32s: secure.
104.32s: So that was always drilled in my head.
106.56s: Like it was just this idea that you should work hard, you should get an education
110.96s: and you can make it like America's place where you have the chance to become whatever
115.84s: you want to become and you can earn money and take care of your family.
119.90s: And they didn't want something extreme.
121.54s: They didn't want to become Jeff Bezos for the yacht.
124.30s: They just wanted like that middle class life of a nice house, a safe suburb, a vacation
129.82s: every year and their kids to go to good school.
132.42s: So I saw them work really, really hard when we came here and they worked so hard that
138.52s: we were able to finally afford a house and then the financial crisis happened in 2008, 2009.
145.52s: And they lost everything and I had I watched them start over again.
149.36s: And so I think back then there was like something and still in my head of like how did
154.66s: this happen?
155.66s: You know they were too good working good, good hardworking people who paid their taxes,
159.96s: played by the rules and they got completely screwed by a system that they didn't even fully
163.80s: understand.
164.80s: And I always wondered like why didn't we see that coming?
168.52s: Why did this even happen?
169.64s: How could the greatest, you know, the economy and the greatest country in the world suddenly
173.56s: have, you know, its economy on the brink of collapse, its banking system on the brink
178.68s: of collapse and meeting bailout from the taxpayers.
181.72s: And that was just sort of, you know, ruminating in the back of my mind.
185.04s: And I decided to pursue a career in journalism because I've always loved storytelling
188.64s: and learning and interviewing people.
190.24s: I love conversations.
192.40s: And so I set off right around that same time around the financial crisis.
196.44s: I got my first job and I started working in this news industry which was changing in real
201.48s: time because of technology and allowing people to, you know, become their own personalities
205.96s: from home and have YouTube channels and all the things that didn't exist when I was growing
211.32s: up sort of dreaming of becoming a journalist.
213.92s: And so what that taught me is, you know, I spent 10 years as a reporter looking at the
220.24s: crises that are facing this country at a really, really deep micro level of human experience,
225.56s: you know, interviewing people that are facing poverty, homelessness, the politicians who
229.60s: claim to have the answer elections, public corruption, all of it.
234.16s: And what I ended up realizing is that our system is really broken and we're spending more
238.92s: and more money.
240.40s: And the problems are only getting bigger and everyone blame someone else and really for
244.40s: the average person life is getting more and more expensive to afford everything from housing
248.40s: to education.
250.28s: And it made me kind of frustrated because I didn't understand what the solution was and
255.64s: I started to feel as I, as I progressed in my career, that really nothing changes
260.20s: it.
261.20s: And then I learned about Bitcoin.
262.76s: And it was 2017.
264.28s: I was in one of the news markets that I worked in and I had friends of friends who worked
268.56s: at Coinbase and they were kind of investing in crypto and I was like, what is Bitcoin?
273.48s: And just like most people, I was super skeptical.
275.64s: I thought it was a scam.
277.36s: I thought it was, you know, some internet funny money.
280.20s: I didn't believe in it.
281.20s: I didn't understand it.
282.64s: But I was curious.
284.04s: And I ultimately knew that there was a problem.
287.04s: And supposedly this was a technology that might fix some of the problems we have.
291.44s: So I started to dig into it.
294.00s: Candidly I did not do most of my research until the pandemic and our market crashed and
299.36s: they initiated like the bazookas of money printing.
303.24s: And I knew that life was not going back to the same sort of financial world order that
309.52s: we had before.
310.52s: I felt like everything changed with the pandemic.
313.16s: And so I started to consume everything I possibly could, not just about Bitcoin, but
318.96s: about our economy in general, like the history of the Federal Reserve.
322.60s: And you know, I started following gold bugs, Bitcoin people, people who were talking about
327.28s: you know, macro economics and what happened in the financial crisis and what happened in 1971
332.20s: with the gold standard.
333.28s: And I started to realize that all of the problems that both I experienced with my family
338.60s: coming here and losing everything as well as all the problems that I was really reporting
342.56s: on as a journalist, they were all connected to our money and how broken our money system was.
348.80s: And that Bitcoin is the one thing to me that I think could fix it and could assure us
354.96s: into a new financial order that's more inclusive, that's more based on value and is more
360.00s: equal because it's based on actual supply and demand economics, which we haven't had
366.56s: for a very long time with the manipulated interest rates and quantitative easing that the
371.04s: Fed takes part in.
371.96s: So I know this is a very long wind and answer, but basically I came to Bitcoin because
376.24s: I knew there was a problem and when I learned about Bitcoin, I realized that was the solution
380.80s: and I want to empower people to understand it so that they can opt out of the broken system
385.28s: into one that potentially could help them accumulate wealth and take care of their families
389.60s: in the future.
390.60s: Wow.
391.60s: That's kind of incredible.
395.60s: One, obviously, I just think it's freaking awesome that your parents are fellow
399.92s: Pollocks, like I said, I get giddy when I find others.
403.84s: But the story that you share is kind of fascinating to me for a few reasons.
409.56s: One, obviously they're timing in just the US market was a little rough because 2008 was
416.96s: just brutal and obviously you know, no more about it than I do.
420.84s: You know, just the way that our fiscal policy was set up at that point obviously it just
425.60s: gives so much leeway to these banks and you started, you know, the aftermath of your view
431.00s: and what kind of monetary decisions they're making, you're like, who thought this is a good
436.60s: idea?
437.60s: You don't even mean.
438.60s: So it's interesting how that moved you towards Bitcoin.
443.12s: So the very first kind of follow-in question I have for you is when we're thinking about
448.44s: the current, you know, just monetary policy, the way that the Fed is so involved in our
455.36s: current fiscal policy.
457.40s: What do you think Bitcoin does in order to kind of fix that problem?
463.20s: Obviously, understanding a little bit of the construction, but I'm curious, you know, just
466.60s: at a high level overview what your thoughts are there.
469.40s: Yeah, so put very simply, it takes the power of money out of the hands of government
475.48s: and central authority and that's what I think we need right now.
478.88s: I didn't really understand the history of money.
480.76s: I never learned it in school.
482.16s: I think this is, you know, it puts a highlight on how little financial literacy we have
486.44s: in this country.
487.44s: I went to good schools.
489.04s: I graduated with a master's at one of the top universities and I really never understood
493.36s: the history of money or how the Federal Reserve came to be.
496.44s: And these are fundamental things that affect all of our lives, right?
499.32s: We use money every single day.
500.92s: It is, you know, our most important information system.
503.96s: I would say it allows us to measure value in society for everything that we produce and
509.96s: all the services that we provide and our money is broken.
513.40s: And our money doesn't have actual value.
515.92s: It's collapsing and purchasing power.
517.80s: And we don't even know what the true price of things are when you have a Federal Reserve
521.52s: that manipulates interest rates and pumps liquidity into markets by basically creating money
526.92s: out of thin air.
527.92s: And then that money goes.
529.48s: It gets disproportionately allocated to, you know, the big corporations and they do stock
534.84s: buybacks and they buy up all this real estate and make everyone into renters.
538.92s: And it's just, it's ballooning the wealth and equality in our country.
542.28s: And so it's just what's sad to me is that I didn't realize that the policies that I was
546.80s: learning in school were really backwards.
549.72s: They were basically addressing solutions as opposed to the problems.
554.04s: And the symptoms, excuse me, they were addressing the symptoms as opposed to the actual
558.20s: problem.
559.20s: And the problem is they're debasing our currency.
560.80s: They're debasing our money.
562.12s: They have the prerogative to print as much money as they want.
565.28s: And it affects the average person, the middle class, the low income earners, the savers,
569.92s: it affects them so much.
571.32s: And that that's what my family represented.
573.20s: And it's frustrating to me.
574.48s: It makes me angry.
575.80s: And so I want people to be empowered with that education of like, look, we used to have
580.04s: a money that they could not inflate.
581.60s: It was gold.
582.60s: And then gold got centralized, involved, and they issued more paper notes than the gold
586.28s: that they had.
587.28s: And eventually they let that get away so far that we basically defaulted and had to go off
592.16s: the gold standard.
593.48s: And now we're in this fiat world where they can make as much money as they possibly
597.88s: want.
598.88s: It goes into the hands of the wealthy before anybody else.
602.24s: And we are getting poorer and more polarized as a nation.
605.92s: We used to be the world's biggest creditor nation.
608.16s: Now we're the world's largest debtor nation.
609.88s: We don't make anything.
610.88s: We don't make anything of value here.
612.88s: And that's sad.
614.68s: And so I now see why everyone is, you know, there's so much angst.
617.96s: And it's like red versus blue.
619.52s: Everyone has a team.
620.96s: Because everyone's just feeling frustrated by a system that isn't inclusive and isn't
624.92s: fair.
625.92s: And no matter how hard you work, it's like you're always on this, in the rat race or on this
629.40s: durable wheel, and you can't make enough.
631.64s: And you can't retire.
632.64s: And you have to start gambling your money and mean stocks, right?
635.08s: And altcoins.
636.36s: So this is the system that Bitcoiners want to fix.
639.32s: Like Satoshi Nakamoto put into the first, you know, block.
644.36s: The Genesis block, the headline, Chancellor on Brink of Second Bay Lops.
650.28s: Like this is the exact problem he wanted to fix or she wanted to fix is the idea that
655.08s: central authority has way too much power and control over the supply of money.
659.68s: And as soon as they start printing too much money and debasing our currency, everybody suffers
664.20s: in the end.
665.20s: So yeah, Bitcoin fixes that.
668.28s: It's interesting.
669.28s: So one of the questions I have with regards to that, I agree with you really on the vast
673.72s: majority of those issues that you noted.
676.84s: Now one thing I am curious your perspective on though is so, or you have the opinion that
682.72s: really in general, the government should not manipulate its financial policy, its currencies
689.92s: at all, or do you think they should limit their involvement.
693.76s: And the reason why I asked that is I do think in certain circumstances, government intervention
698.60s: is actually worked for us and has made some circumstances a little less, I guess impactful
706.52s: common.
707.52s: I'm just curious, do you think that going from something where the government is so heavily
717.00s: involved because right now I think it's way too much?
719.20s: So something where essentially there's no government involvement, what do you think about
723.04s: that jump?
724.28s: So that's a great question.
725.88s: I believe in the rule of law, but I believe in that the government should not be intervening
730.40s: in the free markets and in the economy.
732.96s: So this is where again Bitcoin is the reason why I learned about these different economic
737.36s: theories before Bitcoin.
738.68s: I never understood what Keynesian economics versus Austria economics were.
744.28s: And I feel like over even just the last like five to ten years when I think about the stories
747.92s: I've covered or just like just the climate in general when it comes to the word capitalism
754.56s: has really changed.
755.56s: Capitalism has turned into a very negative work.
758.72s: It's associated with greed and with wealth inequality.
762.20s: But the truth is if you really study capitalism, capitalism is about capital accumulation,
767.56s: it's about saving and investing.
769.12s: And it is the complete polar opposite of what everyone is told to do in this country which
773.80s: is spent that the health of an economy in this country is based on the level of spending.
779.72s: And so Keynesian's believed that the government should intervene and that the government
783.48s: is responsible for stepping in and basically managing demand.
787.00s: They can manage actions of human beings.
789.96s: They can manage unemployment.
791.52s: They can stimulate the economy.
792.92s: They can prevent these booms and bus cycles.
796.52s: But arguably we've had decades of Keynesian economics and all we've had is booms and bus
802.04s: because the economy can't regulate itself.
804.76s: And so that's what really frustrates me is there's a school of thought out there that's
809.32s: being completely ignored and not being taught in schools which is Austrian economics which
812.96s: really focuses on free markets and capitalism and encourages people to save and then
818.00s: invest in something productive and create value for the economy.
821.56s: And we push all that aside in favor of taking on debt and consumers and spending.
827.32s: And so I truly believe like the Austrians believe that if we had an economy that was based
832.04s: on free markets and interest rate that basically set itself based on supply and demand as opposed
837.16s: to a central bank, that we would actually have more equilibrium in the economy.
841.52s: We would have fewer booms and bus that weren't as extreme because the market would come
845.88s: in and fill those gaps and holes.
847.92s: Whereas the government I think encourages malinvestments and misallocation of capital because
853.28s: they ultimately can't decide human action.
855.64s: They can't you can't just like spend your way into a healthy economy and we've gotten
860.64s: so into debt using Keynesian economics.
862.76s: I mean we're basically pushing, putting the tab on future generations and look what's happening.
867.36s: Now a millennial doesn't feel like they can even afford a house that their parents could.
871.48s: That is not the way America should function.
873.64s: We're supposed to be you know, the paradigm of capitalism and free markets and enterprise
878.08s: and entrepreneurship.
879.56s: And now we're leading into what I believe is almost a system of authoritarianism because
884.12s: we have politicians coming in and saying, hey, this is based on corporate greed.
888.40s: I'm going to have universal basic income.
891.00s: This is the bad guy.
892.00s: I'm the fix.
893.00s: We're going to spend more money.
894.00s: We're going to hand out money.
895.00s: That's not the solution.
896.36s: The solution is allowing free markets to function in my opinion.
899.68s: And I think with hard sound money that can't be manipulated at the base layer of our
904.68s: economy, something like Bitcoin using technology to harness sound money, that is what I
909.56s: think will allow us to have a more equal economy.
913.76s: It's interesting.
914.76s: So one of the things you noted, and I'm just curious to dive in just a little bit further,
920.44s: is you mentioned something to the order of the market being able to kind of fill some of,
925.80s: you know, just the holes that we're experiencing.
929.56s: And the current marketplace, when you're referring to the market, I'm curious who that is
935.00s: to you because one of the, I guess, as I'm listening and synthesizing what you're saying,
939.20s: one of the concerns that I have in that kind of world is institutions really drive most
946.08s: of the marketplace right now.
947.32s: The retail investor has, you know, pennies to the dollar.
951.16s: So I'm curious how you view the markets in terms of who then starts to assume kind of pricing
958.36s: power and you know, controlling supply and demand.
960.96s: Yeah.
961.96s: And so this is where I believe that we don't have capitalism.
965.40s: We have crony capitalism where we're allowing sort of these big mass production, mass
970.96s: corporation entities to rise up and control our economy and our government and sit in the,
977.16s: you know, the pockets of politicians because that's what essentially fiat does because
980.84s: when the federal reserve buys treasury bonds or they make up, you know, dollars through
985.72s: on their, in their electronic system, that money goes first to the most credit worthy entities.
990.76s: It doesn't go to small businesses.
992.04s: It doesn't go to the average person.
994.12s: It goes to massive corporations.
996.16s: What have they been doing over the last two decades?
998.16s: They buy back their stock and their stock prices go up.
1000.72s: But it's not based on value or, you know, revenue or the company actually making great
1005.92s: new products.
1006.92s: It's based on the fact that they're buying back their shares.
1009.48s: And the CEOs are getting richer and richer.
1011.52s: And so again, like this is not an economy of value.
1014.32s: It's based on ballooning asset prices.
1016.52s: And so everything looks like it's great.
1018.44s: But like asset prices were, weren't a very expensive stock market right now, right?
1023.24s: S&P 500 went up what 30% last year.
1026.40s: I would argue that's closer to the rate of inflation that we actually have.
1029.68s: House prices went up 30% if not more in certain cities.
1033.52s: How can the average person afford a new house?
1035.56s: Great that you get to sell your place for 30% more.
1037.96s: But now you have to buy a place that's 30% more expensive, right?
1040.72s: There's no winner in this unless you just have a bunch of homes you're selling.
1044.16s: And so again, I just think that this leads to this wealth gap, just increasing increasing
1049.04s: increasing because in a system of money printing and in a system of fiat, the people who have
1053.88s: assets, the people who have the big corporations and can get easy money loans, they're
1058.40s: the people that win in this.
1060.60s: And then the average saver, the average middle class person is getting robbed through inflation.
1065.56s: Everything around them is more expensive.
1067.00s: They can't save schools more expensive housing is more expensive.
1070.84s: And they don't have access to this easy money.
1073.64s: So I just think the system is just getting more and more broken.
1076.40s: And because people don't understand the system and how money printing works, they don't
1079.76s: really understand it.
1080.76s: I mean, prior to, you know, I don't know, maybe the pandemic, did how many people actually
1086.04s: thought about the Fed interest rates, pandit?
1088.80s: Like unless you were in the finance market, we're in the hyper financialized world now,
1093.72s: not many average people thought about it.
1095.52s: But today inflation is one of the main headlines because they've printed the majority of the
1100.16s: money that's in circulation in just the last two years.
1102.68s: So I hope we'll really think people are waking up to it, but you can't have a system like
1106.88s: that because it really disadvantages the average person, the saver, the worker, like the
1112.28s: families that make up, I believe the backbone of our country, small business owners, all
1116.36s: of that.
1117.36s: It's an interesting perspective.
1119.44s: And I agree with you, especially the comment on kind of, I don't know, I would
1124.04s: almost call it the bastardization about fiat currency at this point.
1127.20s: The way that it's being deployed, I completely agree with you there.
1132.44s: And I think about the integration of Bitcoin and the ability for a place like the United
1139.64s: States.
1140.64s: We're starting to see some integration here there, but I'm curious what your thoughts
1144.68s: are on that in terms of what needs to happen for widespread Bitcoin integration into the
1152.08s: US economy.
1153.80s: So I just think it's about education and I think that the market movers in terms of Bitcoin
1159.84s: price are going to be when the institutions come in.
1162.32s: And again, all of this, I think, is about education.
1165.28s: Michael Sailer obviously was a big name over the last two years.
1169.64s: He learned about Bitcoin because of the pandemic and the devaluing currency that he had
1175.96s: in his reserves and in his treasury.
1178.44s: He couldn't figure out where to put his money because bonds with inflation are yielding
1182.64s: negative rates at this point.
1184.72s: And so basically, what are you going to do?
1186.44s: Where are you going to put your money?
1187.44s: And he makes these great analogies of the fact that, you know, it's like the
1189.78s: oxygen is getting sucked out of the room and your breathing lasts in less every single
1195.30s: year.
1196.30s: Your money is a melting ice cube and until Bitcoin, there really was no solution.
1202.14s: And then Bitcoin drops out of the air like this oxygen mask and it's like, aren't
1205.18s: you going to put it on?
1206.18s: I mean, this is the best performing monetary asset of the last 10 years, but more than that,
1210.50s: it is the most powerful computer network in the world.
1212.98s: I mean, this is essentially the internet of money.
1215.86s: It's completely decentralized.
1217.14s: There's no point of failure.
1218.66s: There's no CEO you have to worry about.
1220.38s: There's no politics.
1221.66s: It's literally just a system that has created a mutually beneficial incentive program that
1228.42s: almost harnesses greed for good and is decentralized so that no no person can control it.
1234.34s: Everyone sort of benefits if they adopt it and through network effect, it's grown to be
1238.02s: the most powerful cryptocurrency in the world.
1240.90s: And I think when you, you know, when you look at inflation rates, not just in this country,
1244.78s: but obviously far worse than others.
1246.66s: Like, where do you put your money today that it's going to be safe?
1250.50s: Can you, can you afford to buy a house?
1252.54s: I mean, you can, I can put $5 into Bitcoin.
1255.30s: Can you buy $5 of real estate in New York?
1258.30s: No.
1259.30s: Right.
1260.30s: This is securing your property rights in a way that is not, it's censorship resistant.
1266.38s: It is not able to be confiscated.
1269.22s: It is open software that anyone can see every transaction validated and recorded all the
1274.74s: way to the beginning of the blockchain.
1276.18s: I mean, it's truly incredible technology.
1279.34s: And so I, I believe that if people sort of opt out of the system, start putting their
1283.74s: money into Bitcoin, they'll see it go up in value.
1286.74s: It's a baby monetary network.
1288.54s: So yes, there's short-term volatility, but over the long run, it's literally running upwards
1293.14s: as opposed to the purchasing power of your dollar, which is collapsing every single year and
1297.14s: melting at a rate of between seven percent is what they tell you.
1300.74s: But I believe it's closer to 20 to 30 percent every year.
1303.22s: Are you getting a 20 to 30 percent raise?
1305.50s: Are you going to put your money?
1306.50s: Not in savings account that has a 0.01 percent interest yield.
1310.34s: Are you going to gamble it on stocks?
1311.78s: Well, which stocks?
1312.78s: Do you want to put it all in Apple?
1314.74s: What are you going to buy?
1315.74s: Where do you put your money today?
1316.90s: It's not safe.
1317.94s: And so I believe that Bitcoin offers us this great savings technology and store of value and
1324.02s: a maculate digital property that scares that no one can take from you.
1327.94s: And I think it's incredible.
1330.86s: So an interesting phrase that you use that I'm curious about is you say that it's safer.
1337.62s: And I'd love to dive into that a little bit more.
1340.34s: And the reason for that is when I think about safety, one of the things I would consider
1346.26s: is obviously reduction in variance, reduction in return volatility.
1350.30s: And like you said right now, we are in a world where the only way to get a positive real
1355.74s: rate of return is via equity markets or something else.
1360.18s: Like an alternative Bitcoin.
1361.70s: And when I think about some of the conversation around Bitcoin, I can see the long term safety
1368.82s: depending on how adoption goes.
1371.70s: But I also look at a asset that in the last six months went from what?
1376.70s: 69,000.
1377.70s: And right now it's hanging at like 41,48, something like that.
1381.90s: So to me, I think about safety and I'm like, well, wait a minute, that's cut by a third
1388.06s: and change.
1389.10s: How is that safer to you?
1391.10s: Yeah, so I think safety and volatility are two different things.
1396.50s: Safety to me with Bitcoin kind of refers to the fact that I now have a form of property
1403.14s: that no one can take away from me that I can take anywhere in the world and I can transfer
1407.42s: value from myself to any part of the world in a matter of minutes.
1412.74s: And no one can take that power away from me.
1415.78s: You can't you can't take them the seed phrase out of my head, right?
1419.26s: As opposed to this didn't happen with my family, but I've heard so many stories of people
1423.74s: who fled Eastern European countries during communism and they could only take with them
1428.42s: to the US or wherever they were fleeing, 100 US dollars worth of whatever they had.
1433.42s: That's all they could take.
1434.62s: Well, what if they had Bitcoin recently when the Taliban took over in Afghanistan,
1439.94s: I heard amazing incredible stories of the people who had Bitcoin were able to pay for
1443.78s: evacuations or escape the country while the banks were closed or there was a run on banks and the
1449.06s: traditional finance system collapsed when the Taliban took over and Bitcoin was a way that
1453.42s: they could still transact and basically pay for their families to have an escape.
1458.62s: I mean, it's it's literally in real time empowering people with both financial freedom as well
1463.50s: as human rights.
1464.34s: And so I think that that's incredible.
1466.18s: Is it a volatile asset?
1467.70s: Absolutely because as I mentioned earlier, it's in the baby stages of monetization.
1472.02s: It is a brand new monetary network.
1474.30s: And in different countries, it's also, it has different tax implications and you could
1479.78s: trade it in and out of the highs and lows in places like Dubai or UAE and you get no
1484.34s: tax penalty.
1485.34s: And here in the US, like, we're, if you hold, you want to hold because you don't want
1489.90s: to face capital gains tax taxes, right?
1492.26s: So we're in the baby stages of monetization, but I would prefer to have an extremely
1497.46s: volatile, appreciating asset that year over years just going up in value as opposed
1504.06s: to an extremely stable, not volatile at all, asset like cash, which is collapsing in value
1511.18s: over the last several years, right?
1513.78s: So I can stomach the volatility.
1516.22s: And I get that people need to, you know, use their fiat money for everyday expenses and a lot,
1521.50s: you know, not a lot of places even except Bitcoin.
1523.66s: And I would argue you want to hold something that's increasing in value.
1527.22s: But ultimately, I see it as a safer place because I don't have to worry about a CEO.
1532.30s: I don't have to worry about some, you know, some product having good or bad performance,
1537.58s: supply chain issues.
1538.58s: I don't have to worry about a certain politician getting elected.
1542.34s: It's, it's just, is what it is.
1543.62s: It's a computer network that allows us to store our monetary energy in a place that has
1549.90s: outperformed everything else that exists and that is controlled by no one and that no one
1555.18s: can manipulate because there's a finite amount secured by this decentralized network.
1559.98s: So I don't know if that answers your question, but like, it does.
1562.66s: It does.
1563.66s: Safety is like not about its volatility.
1565.42s: Yeah, no, it does.
1566.66s: And that really, I'm actually really stoked that you took the conversation in that direction,
1571.26s: just because I've talked to some different people with varying concept of, you know, again,
1575.82s: safety and I always feel like that's an important differenti to make.
1580.02s: And I think the way that you phrase that, I totally agree with that, that makes total sense
1584.18s: to me.
1585.18s: And especially because sometimes what frustrates me with some of the Bitcoin conversations
1588.78s: is some people don't like to admit that it's super volatile short term and then it
1594.02s: market's closed.
1595.86s: But then it makes, you know, it almost makes the rest of the conversation kind of hard
1598.74s: to like really conceptualize.
1600.54s: So I think that that's a really, really great way to highlight, you know, the safety
1605.98s: concept for something like Bitcoin.
1607.46s: I agree with you there.
1608.46s: I think that's a great way to phrase it.
1611.46s: So being mindful of your time, I do have two more questions.
1614.22s: The first one is looking into 2022.
1618.42s: What is it, what is, you know, what happens to Bitcoin?
1622.18s: Do you see more adoption coming, especially with the Fed coming out with this interest rate
1627.46s: manipulation, you know, we're expecting three to four rises starting as soon as March.
1632.02s: Like I'm just curious at a very high level.
1634.34s: What do you think's going to happen to Bitcoin throughout the rest of this year?
1637.46s: Yeah.
1638.46s: So I have really high hopes for Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs because ultimately,
1644.06s: I do think that it's still correlated in some way to the traditional markets and liquidity.
1650.10s: And what I hope everyone is learning over the last, at least year or two, is that our economy
1656.18s: is basically addicted to quantitative easing and stimulus.
1660.02s: It's addicted to the money printer.
1661.78s: And as soon as they try to let off the gas pedal, everything takes, right, and goes into
1666.66s: the red.
1667.66s: And so unfortunately, our Fed is now between a rock and a hard place because we have
1672.58s: so much debt.
1674.22s: And we can't service that debt if they raise interest rates meaningfully to a place where
1678.30s: they probably should raise interest rates.
1680.70s: They would cause a complete credit collapse and, you know, bankruptcies and the unwinding
1685.74s: of this massive leverage that we have that's historic.
1688.70s: That's a much bigger bubble than we had in 2008.
1692.18s: But if we go the other way and we keep printing, then it's just evaluating our currency
1696.14s: more.
1697.14s: But it obviously makes it cheaper to service our debt.
1698.82s: So pretty much, I believe that they're going to go by way of inflation.
1702.94s: They're going to give us the headlines of inflation's good.
1705.66s: And this is why it's good.
1706.66s: Oh, now we're going to have price controls and they're going to try to fix things.
1709.66s: That's a great thing.
1710.66s: Great inflation, right?
1711.66s: Exactly.
1712.66s: Yeah.
1713.66s: So we're getting the narrative that, you know, now we're going to potentially have
1716.46s: price fixing and wage controls, which it's like, it's sad because it's clear that most
1721.74s: people who are leading this country politically don't understand basic economics and the
1726.14s: times and history when people tried that and it really didn't work.
1730.18s: So what I believe will happen is I believe they will talk about tapering.
1735.26s: They might try to raise, you know, a couple basis points.
1737.66s: They won't be able to.
1739.26s: We have an election coming up.
1740.98s: We are going to have to have green markets for that.
1742.98s: What's that going to mean?
1743.98s: More money printing, more devaluing of our currency.
1746.02s: I think that that's going to help Bitcoin.
1747.74s: Anything with liquidity is going to help Bitcoin in any time that people realize that
1751.38s: the system is just too far gone.
1753.38s: At this point, we are in solvent and we're addicted to the money printer and we're just
1756.82s: going to keep debasing our currency.
1758.86s: Bitcoin is a fantastic technology that ops us out.
1761.66s: And I think more and more people will adopt that, both institutions and retailers.
1765.78s: I'm so happy and grateful that we have this technology.
1768.46s: And so I think Bitcoin, you know, once the markets are given the green light from the
1773.58s: Fed that no more tapering is going to happen, I think they're going to run and I think
1777.30s: Bitcoin's going to run with it.
1779.58s: Interesting.
1780.58s: Yeah, I think, I mean, when I think about Bitcoin, though, it's kind of boring, right?
1785.86s: Because big daddy, J. Powell can't just turn on the printer and then just print Bitcoin.
1790.10s: So what, what was the entertainment now?
1791.90s: Just kidding.
1792.90s: They should print money to buy Bitcoin.
1796.70s: That's an interesting, it's an interesting outlook and it highlights really my last question.
1805.70s: And it's something that I'm just personally curious about.
1809.02s: I find that we always, at least as traders, we're always looking for relationships and correlations
1815.26s: and how things interact with other things.
1817.70s: And Bitcoin is a tricky one because for a while, a lot of people saw it as an inflation
1823.10s: hedge.
1824.10s: And then some people are saying, well, is it really an inflation hedge?
1827.74s: So that's really the last nuance question I have for you is how do you think Bitcoin interacts
1835.22s: with directly with interest rates?
1837.82s: Do you think that it's something people can slowly add to the portfolio as a style of
1842.02s: hedge?
1843.02s: Do you think that they're too just disjointed for that to really be an observable relationship
1846.98s: at this point?
1847.66s: What does that look like to you?
1849.22s: For me, and I said this recently in a news show that I was a part of, I believe that
1853.34s: Bitcoin is a fantastic inflation hedge.
1855.62s: And I think that a non-zero position is the right one for everyone at this point.
1860.66s: And everyone has different amounts of risk and volatility they can stomach.
1864.42s: But I believe at least a 1 to 5 percent is smart for everyone.
1868.78s: And I really try to educate as many people about it as possible because at this point, it is
1874.54s: literally the best performing monetary asset of the last decade.
1877.54s: It's appreciated about a million percent.
1879.30s: The second best performer was Tesla at 15,000 percent Amazon and Apple stocks were about
1883.94s: 14, 12 and 14 hundred respectively.
1887.22s: S&P 500 did about 300 percent over the last decade.
1890.58s: Gold went down about 6 percent.
1892.42s: So it's not the inflation hedge that I suppose it once was.
1896.02s: But let's look at the last couple of years.
1898.42s: 2019 was around 90 percent that Bitcoin went up 20, 20, 300 percent last year 60 percent
1906.06s: inflation.
1907.06s: Yes, they're telling us it's 7 percent.
1908.74s: Let's look at how much assets have gone up.
1910.50s: Let's look at the S&P.
1911.50s: Let's look at how much housing has gone up by.
1913.74s: That's what I believe tells the real story of inflation.
1916.38s: Tell 7 percent to the person going to gas and paying 40 percent more at the pump or paying
1922.10s: 25 percent more for their meat at the supermarket.
1924.82s: Inflation is a massive problem.
1926.94s: We're being misguided and misinformed about it by the media, which is really sad.
1931.26s: I come from a journalism background.
1933.42s: We should be watchdogs for the government.
1935.14s: We should be lapdogs and propagandists for the government and their policies.
1939.62s: We should be really holding their feet to the fire.
1941.98s: So I think that the inflation narratives, we need to actually inform people about how this
1947.82s: is really hurting them in their bottom lines.
1951.30s: The stimulus checks are just like a little crumb in all of the...
1955.62s: I think it's a distraction.
1956.62s: I think it's a distraction.
1958.62s: I think that's just to see people.
1960.62s: Okay, so I like to...
1961.62s: I like to...
1962.62s: I like to...
1963.82s: You beat inflation all those years if you have Bitcoin.
1966.38s: Right.
1967.78s: Yeah, and it's a great way to think about it.
1970.58s: Especially as a longer term asset, I think that's a good story.
1975.78s: I typically lie with the last question because I always think of one more and I just lied
1979.86s: to you because I've won very last one promise.
1984.30s: For people that are interested in getting involved, do you have any recommendations for
1989.66s: them?
1990.66s: Yes, that is.
1991.66s: I talked to some different people and for me personally, I've always been kind of an advocate
1996.06s: of a platform that gives you like actual direct exposure to holding the currency as compared
2001.14s: to indirect exposure, things like that.
2002.78s: But I'm curious from your perspective.
2004.46s: If somebody is like, I'm curious a bit coin, want to get started.
2008.06s: What should they do?
2009.06s: Yeah, so just a couple of things on that.
2011.62s: I think education again is number one.
2013.98s: And until you understand the problem, you don't appreciate why Bitcoin is a solution.
2017.86s: Right?
2018.86s: First, people should look at their financial lives.
2023.34s: Are they making enough to be able to comfortably plan retirement or plan a future for their
2028.82s: family, for their kids?
2030.82s: Are they stressed out financially?
2032.94s: Well, if you are, and I would argue that a lot of people feel that way in this country,
2037.78s: what's the rate of return you're getting on your investments if you're investing?
2040.78s: What's the rate that you got on your stocks?
2042.50s: What's the rate you're getting in your savings account or in your 401k?
2045.86s: What's that percentage?
2046.86s: Now, let's compare that to Bitcoin.
2048.82s: There are so many avenues that you can invest in Bitcoin now, but I agree with you.
2052.18s: I think holding Bitcoin directly becoming your own bank and becoming financially sovereign
2056.86s: is the number one.
2058.26s: And it is a little bit technology technologically intimidating for some people because it's
2062.62s: the idea of taking ownership and having something that's completely digital in your custody
2067.34s: and you have to protect it.
2069.58s: There are also other avenues where there are trusted third parties and multi-sig wallets
2073.90s: and all of that that will help you protect your Bitcoin.
2075.98s: But number one is just education.
2078.02s: Look at your financial life and tell me if it's performing the way you want it to.
2083.58s: And then let's look at Bitcoin's performance.
2085.34s: If you want to read a book about Bitcoin, the best one out there.
2088.14s: I've read it countless times now.
2089.94s: Bitcoin's standard.
2090.94s: Number one best book.
2092.42s: It's hardly even really about Bitcoin.
2094.38s: It's about the history of money and how our system got to be where it is and why we're
2099.02s: struggling with some of these issues and why Bitcoin was invented.
2102.62s: It is a phenomenal book.
2104.42s: It helped get me down the rabbit hole.
2106.86s: And then start investing.
2108.90s: That's the best way.
2109.90s: Buy two dollars worth of Bitcoin.
2111.90s: Buy five dollars worth of Bitcoin.
2113.70s: Spare the coffee that you would have had and put that money into Bitcoin and watch its performance
2118.30s: over the next five, six, 10, 12 months.
2122.10s: I really just believe having a little bit of exposure gets you interested and engaged doing
2127.82s: the homework.
2128.82s: But it's just simple things.
2131.06s: Are you doing well financially?
2132.90s: If not, one to five percent is pretty conservative.
2136.46s: If it goes down, you lost one to five percent.
2140.18s: If it does what I believe it will do, you could potentially change your life of it.
2145.22s: So, yeah, I have two websites that I recommend personally.
2149.18s: I love Swan Bitcoin.
2151.82s: They're a Bitcoin only exchange.
2153.90s: They're fantastic.
2155.46s: And okay, coin.
2156.46s: Okay, coin is available in the most amount of countries in the world has very low dollar
2159.62s: cost averaging fee.
2160.66s: So, basically, you can set up a recurring buy and you don't have to pay fees on it.
2164.10s: You do with some other exchanges that are big names out there.
2168.10s: And so it's really easy.
2169.10s: Again, you can buy a dollar worth of Bitcoin.
2171.54s: Awesome.
2172.54s: That's so awesome.
2173.54s: Thanks for going through that too.
2174.54s: I know a lot of people are really curious on how to get started.
2177.02s: So, I know you got to run.
2178.90s: Thank you so much for sharing some of this information with me.
2182.14s: And really more importantly, I literally love the fight that you're fighting.
2185.86s: It really is kind of a good fight.
2187.78s: I think your focus on just the typical American is it's really refreshing.
2193.94s: So, thank you for doing what you do.
2195.82s: Well, thank you.
2196.42s: I appreciate it.
2197.26s: Thanks for having me.
2198.62s: Awesome. Take care not only.
2200.10s: Thanks.
