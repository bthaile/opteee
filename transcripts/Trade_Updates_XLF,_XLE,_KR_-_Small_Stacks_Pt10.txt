0.88s: hey everyone eric here hopping on to do
3.52s: a very quick small stack segment
6.64s: made a few adjustments today and um
9.76s: i'm trying to do my best to keep the
12.08s: videos in terms of the adjustments a
13.52s: little bit more real time based on some
15.20s: feedback i got
17.12s: and it's it's good feedback so the idea
19.12s: is to try to
20.64s: make sure that i'm sharing regular
22.96s: updates
23.68s: with specific information for the trades
26.08s: so that it's easier for folks to follow
28.64s: so today i ended up making
31.84s: a handful of adjustments so let's jump
34.00s: over to the screen and take a look
36.64s: the first one is i exited out
39.76s: of xlf today and
43.68s: what i ended up doing is closing the
46.80s: trade
47.52s: out for a little over 50
51.36s: max profit um i had the
55.12s: 22 and a half puts i sold those for 54
58.64s: cents and i closed it today for 24 cents
61.60s: so essentially just moving money around
64.72s: there taking in money when i see it
66.88s: and i offered exposure in xle
70.80s: so let's take a look real quick at the
73.28s: two trades
74.08s: xlf as you could tell just made a
77.76s: small move up so for me that was just a
80.32s: pretty simple
81.04s: profit management in that scenario i
82.72s: like to manage at about 55
84.40s: max profit and in general if i
87.76s: see 30 plus pr 30 plus percent profit in
91.60s: the first week
92.40s: i tend to take a look at the trade as
93.92s: well now
95.84s: what i will save for the small stack
97.92s: segment because i am
99.60s: so limited in products there's a very
103.04s: key step
103.84s: that i take and that is before i
107.12s: exited xlf i found a
110.80s: suitable replacement trade so
114.00s: that i can move my money from xlf into a
117.20s: different trade
118.64s: that satisfied my requirements because
121.92s: if we go back over to the whiteboard
124.08s: here if i closed it at 24 cents i still
126.64s: had 24
127.60s: to make on that trade again it doesn't
129.36s: sound like a lot in terms of
131.28s: dollar amount but for this portfolio
133.92s: it's
134.32s: that's not a negligible amount of money
137.52s: so in order for me to find
141.04s: to put on another trade and close out of
142.96s: this trade i needed to find something
144.96s: that was going to pay me more than that
146.32s: 24 cents in something that i liked
148.88s: so i like to look at that before i exit
151.60s: the trade to make sure there's a
152.80s: suitable replacement
154.48s: so qxle in there i ended up selling one
159.60s: of the 30 october 29
161.68s: puts and i collected 72 cents so
165.44s: in general i think energy is getting
169.04s: beat down and i think that it's in
171.20s: definitely a pretty rough spot i don't i
173.76s: do not
174.80s: feel very bullish about the product
178.00s: but this is the kind of thing that i
181.04s: would
181.76s: very very happily turn into a coverage
184.56s: strangle
185.12s: and hold on to it for some time the
187.28s: reason being
188.16s: is if we kind of zoom this out a little
190.40s: bit we look at something like a three
191.84s: year
192.56s: we're getting near all-time lows where
195.12s: the the low is 23
197.20s: and if i get held up at 29 i would be
200.32s: pretty far away from that i would have
201.68s: to buy more to cost average in a bit
204.08s: but nonetheless it still is definitely
207.28s: at the lower end of that range
209.52s: this is not a product i'm looking to
211.04s: hold on to long term what i'm doing is
212.96s: just capitalizing
214.16s: on the the price so getting 72 cents on
218.16s: that option
219.12s: is kind of a big deal one because it's a
221.52s: really good return
223.28s: it's over you know two percent return on
225.20s: the money for a 30-day trade which is
227.76s: obviously healthy so the other thing
230.80s: is that if i end up being assigned this
232.88s: pays over
233.84s: uh slightly higher than a seven percent
236.00s: dividend
236.96s: so it's something that would be
239.36s: reasonable
240.08s: to maintain a covered strangle in
241.92s: ideally we'll be able to soak up some of
244.24s: that
244.72s: credit and then move on much like we did
247.28s: with
247.76s: xlf but we'll see what the market has if
250.48s: we'll kind of adjust as needed
252.40s: so that is kind of what happened on the
255.60s: covered
256.16s: strangle front and then if we jump over
259.44s: to
259.76s: the kroger diagonal i still have that
262.56s: position on
264.00s: and essentially what i did is take down
267.92s: the
268.48s: 23 october 35 puts
272.56s: i sold those out for 62 cents and i took
275.68s: them down for 40 cents
277.36s: so if you'll notice this is less than my
280.84s: 55
282.40s: premium capture this didn't hit any sort
285.28s: of
285.60s: 30 threshold in a certain amount of time
288.72s: i was in the trade for um
292.00s: i don't think i have the calculation on
293.76s: here
295.12s: i think i only do that for the for the
297.20s: leap i might have to add that but
298.88s: i wasn't in the trade for that oh yeah
300.48s: duh i entered the train on
302.32s: 22 september so i was in it for six days
304.96s: now
306.24s: the the reason for this adjustment is
309.44s: because
310.88s: if you'll notice i again found a
314.00s: suitable replacement
315.92s: where i was collecting more than this 40
317.84s: cents most
319.44s: importantly i started moving my strike
322.56s: up so this is that should be the 35
325.36s: fives
327.36s: yeah so um i just realized that's an
329.60s: error right here this is
331.36s: this strike right here should be 35.5
334.64s: not 35 and the reason why
337.76s: i made the move is to move my
341.20s: um short strike up that 50 cents it
343.60s: gives the trade a little more room to
345.36s: move
346.48s: and i appreciate more capital gains
350.40s: the other thing that you'll notice is
352.56s: that i only sold
354.00s: a one lot i could easily sell
357.20s: a two lot if i wanted to and still
360.56s: have no upside risk
363.76s: the reason why i'm not doing that is i'm
365.92s: waiting to see how price moves
367.84s: if we start getting some sort of up move
370.24s: i'll sell another call
372.40s: a bit above the basis so that i can
374.64s: collect more money up front
377.04s: but not cap my upside now if we start
380.96s: moving
381.52s: down then i'll just stay with the one
383.92s: call
384.56s: the reason why i do that is because i i
387.76s: see more
388.80s: i see more premium in these options so
391.20s: if the underlying makes a move up i
393.04s: don't want to get stuck
394.08s: at just collecting that 52 cents and
397.76s: if i did it for a 2 lot because if we
400.56s: take a look at the options here
402.32s: and we go out to 6 nov if you look at
404.80s: something that's at the money or even
406.32s: write out
406.88s: right out of the money they're trading
409.36s: for 90 cents
410.88s: to to a dollar so i do not want
414.00s: to miss that potential premium by
416.64s: selling two
417.36s: up front i'm obviously comfortable
419.60s: holding this product for some time
421.68s: so that's why i'm not prioritizing
424.72s: collecting additional capital up front
427.28s: i'm
427.76s: giving more credence to the potential
430.48s: upside
431.36s: and that's the trade-off we make in this
432.88s: scenario so
435.44s: in total the total realized p
438.80s: l in the account is 668 bucks so we're
442.16s: still cruising above 11 closing in on 12
446.56s: credit outstanding as of right now is
448.84s: 124.
450.00s: which represents a 2.2 percent stake in
453.12s: the account
453.84s: that's again for for me in my target
456.64s: that's a really good return
458.48s: i know i i say every single lesson
461.12s: because it's so important
462.72s: that in terms of a dollar amount that
465.36s: doesn't mean much
466.56s: it's fairly insignificant what we're
469.68s: doing in this small stacks account
471.44s: is not trying to develop our five
473.76s: thousand dollars
474.64s: into our future wealth it's not going to
476.72s: happen so
478.00s: what i'm doing in this account is taking
480.08s: a pragmatic approach
481.84s: trading it as if i was starting over
484.08s: again and what i'm focusing on
486.16s: is refining and deploying a strategy
490.08s: that as the account grows i can scale
493.28s: the strategy
494.48s: and instead of making two percent on a 5
496.88s: 000 account
498.16s: as the account grows i save money get
500.64s: promotions
501.84s: do other business sell a house whatever
504.64s: instead of making that two percent
506.24s: on a five thousand dollar account now
508.00s: we're making two percent on a five
509.68s: hundred thousand dollar account
511.28s: something like that as your money grows
513.52s: so
514.32s: that that's the focus right now we're
516.96s: building a skill set that we're refining
519.36s: and making sure that we have a good
520.72s: process down
522.40s: i i say it all the time because i think
524.16s: too many people
525.76s: think that they're going to grow this
527.44s: five thousand ten thousand
528.80s: fifty thousand even a hundred thousand
530.40s: dollars into something that's going to
532.40s: be their future wealth and i i truly
534.24s: think it's a it's a mistake it's a big
535.84s: mistake
536.64s: so anyways the account right now
540.48s: is utilizing about 4 300 so that's
543.76s: 75 utilized means we have a little bit
545.92s: of cash left but not much
548.00s: and what i likely will do with the
550.48s: remaining capital
551.76s: is wait and see how both
554.88s: xle and kroger look typically i like to
558.40s: add
559.36s: room save room for an additional put in
561.68s: something like xle for the coverage
563.28s: strangle i probably won't here
565.12s: if i get assigned i'll just turn it into
567.12s: a covered call and ride that out
569.68s: so ideally i'll be looking at another
572.72s: strangle
573.60s: at some point before i do that more
576.48s: likely than not
577.60s: what i will do is wait until kroger has
580.72s: some sort of
581.44s: up move so that i can unwind one of the
584.96s: leaps
585.60s: that i have in kroger to make sure that
588.80s: i have a good basis and free up a little
591.44s: bit more capital
592.72s: to gain exposure to um another trade i
596.08s: could easily
596.88s: have room right now with that remaining
599.36s: seven hundred dollars
600.48s: to to get into another diagonal but i
602.88s: don't want to redline myself right now
605.28s: especially as i've been talking about my
607.28s: margin account going into the election
609.36s: just no interest so right now we're
612.32s: playing with
613.20s: a good amount of our capital but we're
614.96s: not um at 100
616.72s: and we're not trading on margin so
619.92s: that is all i got for this right now
622.96s: we'll see how the next few weeks shape
624.96s: up i i'm not expecting to make any
626.96s: adjustments at least for a week or two
629.04s: so we'll we'll see what what happens if
631.36s: we get some sort of big move i'll
632.64s: absolutely take trades down but
634.80s: in general this is pretty much set up to
637.04s: to run on its own
638.08s: until we get closer to expiration so if
640.40s: anybody's any questions as always drop
642.00s: me a line let me know
643.28s: and i will catch everybody later
