0.00s: What's up outliers? Quick market updates. I'm going to start doing a GameStop video on Tuesday
5.52s: specifically so that we can recap some of the things that we learned on Saturday's stream right now.
10.96s: We're looking at due diligence and stuff like that. I want to take a look at the stock itself,
14.64s: GameStop. And then I want to talk about the GameStop coverage strangle that I have on as an
19.20s: example trade for everybody. And then for those that are following the coverage strangle strategies
24.24s: that I'm sharing with everybody, I will do a standalone update for those on Thursday.
30.72s: So first things first, let's take a look at the stock itself. We obviously had that pretty
34.88s: big sell off. I did a video on this actually. I actually think last Tuesday potentially.
39.20s: And it's just because it was really interesting to me. There was no real news to necessitate the move
43.84s: that ties to this as to why it might have happened. And the move is continued. So the first thing
50.72s: I flagged actually was a bit of a support level. I'll draw it with a regular line here so that
57.04s: you can see, but it's essentially below this consolidation range here. And this is really the
63.36s: bottom of this large volume node that we have. And below this, there's a big ol gap. You can see
70.96s: that this is the very bottom of this consolidation range here. And this is kind of like the last line
77.28s: before there's just very light volume leading into this. This is a great example. Unfortunately,
83.52s: of how stocks tend to require pretty significant sponsorship in order to appreciate and value,
91.12s: but they can fall under their own weight. And I say that because even the move that we saw today,
96.96s: slightly lower or about equivalent to what we saw on the 17th, but the difference is it had
103.60s: this big WIC came back up. And it really inside day looks like it's continuing this downward trend.
111.52s: So this trend line that I drew a while ago clearly has just been firmly broken. This is no longer
117.04s: relevant. And what's become more relevant in my opinion is actually this downward trend line now.
124.24s: And you can see that it's very steep. The overall velocity potential of this is nothing really
131.28s: to scoff at. And it's coming into its next area of congestion as far as I'm concerned with the
136.72s: same admin note as per always. GameStop does not follow standard technical analysis. I've done a lot
141.84s: of studies on this. I know that to be true. It follows standard technical analysis a lot of the time,
147.04s: but the reason why I say it doesn't is because it violates standard technical analysis at very key
152.88s: times. And that's why. So if we take a look at things like RSI right now, the seven day VWOP
160.80s: RSI average is negative sloping. It's crossing under 50. We can see that the RSA RSI line itself is
167.52s: kind of leveling off a little bit, but still below the moving average and still below 50,
171.44s: which is typically a bearish configuration. If we stroll over quickly to take a look at the options,
177.04s: volatility is all but gone. 87.7% vol in the front expiration 80, 86, 85. It's just very, very quiet.
185.68s: We can see a slight uptick in vol still here in this seven Feb expiration where it jumps from
193.44s: 80.9 to 86.5. So typically that indicates the market is thinking something is going on there.
199.12s: We took a look at this on the live stream on Saturday. And I'm actually not sure what we came up with
205.92s: other than nobody was really certain if there's any expected news or anything. If you know anything
209.92s: about that, I would love to know. But the other thing we spent a little time on the stream Saturday
216.08s: taking a look at together was the due diligence library. And I bring that up because I've been going
222.64s: through the due diligence due diligence library for what we're on episode 11 now. So we've been
231.28s: looking at it for some time. And there was a lot of interesting things that we came across
237.52s: in the latest iteration. What we were spending a lot of time looking at were a couple AMAs related to
246.40s: just the overall behavior. This is a little bit older in nature. But then we also spent a little
251.60s: time looking at some important news as far as I'm concerned, which I will reiterate here for you
256.96s: all again. Like I said, we'll do a little bit of a recap of what we cover on the Saturday streams,
262.32s: which is store closures. And one of the things we were trying to figure out is with that original
266.80s: down move is was it because there's some sort of acceleration of store closures that we didn't know
272.16s: about. And it's really nothing like that. There were two closed in 2025. The bulk, this is looking
277.20s: at Pacific Northwest stores to be clear. And we know that there was a handful in 24. But all this
283.04s: stuff is already generally priced in. This is all older stuff. So none of that really explains the
288.72s: movement that we saw. But then volatility just essentially vanished across the board.
293.20s: The overall options chain here is light, but still very, very skewed to calls. 523,000 calls
301.92s: against 172,000 puts. So big, big, big call skew. We take a look and see what expiration those are
308.40s: centered in. There's 91,000. So almost a fifth is in 24 Jan this upcoming expiration 31 Jan
316.08s: is at 70 K. So again, another pretty big block. It tailors off for seven Feb 14 Feb is really light.
323.12s: 21 Feb is kind of the next heaviest. And then we don't see another big one until 17 April, which
330.80s: these further out explorations are kind of normal to see a little more depth in because these
335.28s: are going to be primary explorations. But you know, anywhere from six, nine, 12 months, I don't know
340.96s: why I was say 12 months. That was pretty dumb. Around three to six months is what I was going for.
345.84s: I guess I just got really excited because I can move in three, three, six, nine. I got excited.
351.60s: And 18 July is super light 16 Jan 60,000. So pretty light. And then 15 Jan nobody's out there yet.
359.92s: So it's a bit of a mix between some of these primary initial near term explorations that we see
366.40s: the bulk. And then we see a couple concentrations out in 17 April, 20 June. This is important because
371.12s: as we watch for options flow to see if anything might be materializing, any positioning might be
376.24s: coming out. We look for deviations off of this and where it is. So that's why I flagged that for
383.28s: you. We look at TNS time and sales. There was, you know, standard market activity today.
388.96s: Most of the trades were on the smaller side of things, but the larger trades is for as quantity
394.88s: size where a lot of pretty far out of the money. So like this 303, 393 contract. But you can see
402.32s: that there was a decent size trade here in the 24 Jan 25 29 and a half calls. But even those as
408.96s: a overall premium value, not too noteworthy and to show that a little clear will grab our friends
417.52s: over at unusual whales here. And we can take a look through. Let's get rid of the put side of the
423.04s: equation for now just to look at calls. And this is looking for this week. And I'm not filtering it
427.76s: by the side of the trade. I'm just looking at all of them and looking at the premium. You can see
432.56s: that there's just not a lot of really sizable trades coming through right now. There was one,
439.28s: but again, this is for an old expiration that already came up for the 17th of Jan. So no real,
447.04s: no real takeaway from that. They probably would have moved their position out. And we can see,
451.52s: let's keep DTE above zero for now and see any new stuff that is recently cropped up.
459.60s: And it's all pretty small stuff. There's this trade here, the 22s that are nine days. That's a
465.20s: decent size trade, but that's still not like, you know, overly significant trade as far as I'm
472.40s: concerned. Okay. Let's talk about a couple trade updates in the coverage strangle. So for those
476.80s: that don't know, I essentially broke part of my game stop position aside, my holdings, and I'm trading
482.64s: the coverage strangle here, which is an option strategy to try to show you how we can use options
487.92s: to help enhance a buy and hold position. So right now as it sits, I'm actually down to 200 shares
494.24s: at a basis of 2827. What ended up happening was on the 14th of Jan, I unwound 100 shares.
501.76s: The basis of those was 2431. I sold them for 2890. And it was a PNL realized of 460 bucks.
511.84s: The reason for that sale was just to lighten the load a little bit during this down move,
517.44s: because I didn't know how far it was going to come down. And you can see of the total amount
521.92s: that's cash secured of this allocation of $25,000. It's only 22.6% right now in the equity.
528.08s: The reason why that's so important is because I can always buy more. It's easy for me to add.
532.80s: But what becomes a little more challenging is that if it does continue this decline,
538.00s: I don't want to hold a higher basis because it does me no real good. I can't sell calls against it
545.36s: above my basis. I would have to sell them below my basis, which becomes a problem in something
548.96s: specifically like game stop. I am way more reluctant to sell calls below my basis and game stop is
553.68s: compared to other things because of how quickly it can start to move. That can be a big problem.
558.72s: And again, this is a standard lesson for the coverage strangle not limited to game stop,
562.88s: but it's understanding how to tailor the strategy, the individual underlying that we're looking at.
568.40s: And in this case, we know game stop can have really big moves. The next thing here is you can see,
573.84s: I took down a few of the short puts that we had. Didn't take them down for much. But what I'm doing
581.36s: is I'm regaining spot price sensitivity. So this one came down because the 28s essentially were
589.44s: starting to fall in the money. And then the 26s are getting close to being at the money.
594.80s: So all I did was consolidate these trades. So on the 17th, I offered five of the 25 strike,
602.96s: 21 feb 25s for a dollar six, pretty light premium relative to game stop, but still an incredibly good
608.72s: return on a vested capital there. And then you can see I still have the 200 shares. So I'm only
613.20s: selling one call against them. So right now I'm short, the 21 feb 35 call is a 35 delta when I sold
621.36s: it. And the premium on that was a dollar 93. So the total realized PNL on the trade is a thousand
628.80s: 70 bucks. The total PNL, including the equity position and the open options is 16 33. So we are,
637.12s: we are in the early stages of this entire thing. We're not really moving things too quickly.
643.28s: We're just playing it nice and conservatively, but keeping a really nice sensitive basis.
648.48s: Because right now we're only 72.6% utilized. So what that means is even though I have cash secured
656.16s: puts out right now that are in 21 feb, what it allows me to do is that if game stop starts moving,
661.60s: I can just buy shares again in order to capture that movement and to participate to the upside
667.28s: and if it does unfortunately, it's downward move. I'll be in a position to still manage the trade,
672.40s: make as much money as I can so that I can continue scaling the position. The total value of the
676.72s: position as it sits right now is just over 26 K. So the trade is already making realized capital,
684.32s: which is important because that's now a thousand more dollars that I can buy of this specific equity
690.16s: without adding any more money. This is where compounding will start to occur. So as always,
694.88s: do you have any questions? Let me know. Be an ally. Be an ape. I'll see you all later.
