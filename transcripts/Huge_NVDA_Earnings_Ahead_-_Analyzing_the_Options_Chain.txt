0.56s: what's up outliers quick market update
2.28s: cuz Nvidia you know essentially the
4.56s: whole stock market rests on nvidia's
7.00s: shoulders right now has earnings
9.00s: tomorrow the 20th after the close so I
11.28s: want to walk through what I'm seeing in
12.80s: terms of the options as we're leading
15.08s: into it I actually had a position on in
17.40s: here that I recently adjusted not just
19.96s: because of earnings but some of it due
22.52s: to what I'm going to walk you through so
25.16s: what's going on here well if we just
27.12s: poke through really quick we can see
29.16s: Nvidia is hovering near six-month highs
31.96s: if we take it out to a year it's
33.68s: essentially sitting at oneyear highs
35.88s: 5year highs all-time highs you kind of
37.96s: get the uh the gist here we're we're
39.76s: we're just hovering at highs so the
43.04s: reason why this matters is because as we
45.36s: go through what the market looks like it
47.24s: might be expecting from Nvidia for
49.76s: earnings um it really depends on how you
52.92s: feel about playing something like this
55.16s: the premise of what I'm saying here is
57.92s: NVIDIA has traditionally done very well
61.24s: and if we go through its prior earnings
62.88s: I'll show you what I mean by this if we
65.44s: look at its past four quarters of
68.88s: earnings you can see a pretty clear
71.20s: Trend that it's positive surprises all
74.12s: around now one thing I want to note for
77.12s: you is notice the severity of the
80.88s: surprise right so looking at the quarter
83.08s: ending 1023 that was a
85.68s: 26.7% then 124 was
88.92s: 16.7% then 424
91.84s: 13.7% 724
94.76s: 88.3% the main thing I'm highlighting is
97.24s: although Nvidia is still unequivocally
99.52s: crushing it this is narrowing pretty
103.44s: tightly and that's not to suggest that
105.72s: it might miss on this next earnings
107.84s: that's the nature of earnings nobody
109.20s: knows what's going to happen you can
110.96s: position for it directionally if you're
112.44s: so inclined if you have an underlying
114.72s: idea about how it might behave but
118.08s: regardless of what you think about that
119.60s: you can clearly see that the surprises
122.84s: definitely are narrowing out here even
125.52s: though we still are hovering near
127.32s: alltime high so let's take a look now at
131.20s: Nvidia
132.84s: itself and I want to zoom this into a
135.36s: six-month and show you a couple things
137.64s: the first thing is if we just Loosely
140.76s: eyeball
142.08s: volatility we can absolutely
145.56s: see this starting to expand pretty
149.16s: significantly
150.36s: right and this is both 7-Day Vault and
152.60s: 30-day VA this is very normal leading
154.88s: into an earnings release nothing stands
156.96s: out to me there other than the fact that
158.56s: we're seeing a normal price Behavior
161.12s: coming into earnings now it did have a
163.24s: really big day today it was almost 5% up
166.16s: move and there's a bunch of news wrapped
169.80s: around it I don't want to get stuck in
171.08s: the news I want to focus more on what
173.28s: it's actually functionally looking like
175.08s: around earnings so let's look at its
177.60s: past earnings this is going back to q323
181.12s: and obviously you can see
183.08s: q325 um all the way up here and I want
186.60s: to talk about the behavior that we see
189.40s: leading into earnings down at the bottom
191.52s: here you can see the actual EPs and then
195.16s: the expected EPS right so it continues
197.64s: to outperform I think we've seen that
199.92s: pretty consistently now if we take a
202.40s: look at the immediate price movement
204.80s: post earnings release it tends to Gap to
208.68s: the upside right so we can see that in
210.96s: this occurrence this occurrence this
213.72s: occurrence this occurrence So that
216.76s: obviously does not mean it is going to
219.80s: Gap anywhere because we can also see in
221.52s: several occurrences is actually trended
223.04s: to the downside it trended down here it
226.20s: trended down here it still went up but
229.32s: still had a down day following so this
231.20s: is kind of like an inside move and then
233.28s: it trended down here so after three of
236.24s: these instances it clearly trended down
239.12s: um it it's almost a mixed bag right and
241.56s: that's that's what earning should be now
243.12s: what I can tell you though from a
244.36s: positioning standpoint the ability to
246.60s: capitalize on a gap in this instance
248.84s: from 2075 to 23 from here it went from
253.12s: 305 to 370 and then from here it went
256.44s: from 674 to 785 from here it went from
259.68s: 949 to 1037 what I'm highlighting is
262.12s: that these are much bigger moves than
264.04s: the down moves that it shows so there's
267.24s: some opportunity in that context because
270.64s: if you want to play something like this
271.88s: to the upside you almost have a slightly
274.80s: lower risk trade to the downside again
278.12s: this can blow out at any point and
280.20s: become a massive downside move but based
282.56s: on the recent earnings history that we
284.96s: can see the upside tends to be via
287.72s: gapping of some capacity and the
289.72s: downside seems to be more so from
291.72s: downside drift so that is what it is now
295.72s: in terms of selling volatility into this
298.08s: earnings it looks really ugly
300.28s: and what I mean by that is if you take a
301.76s: look at implied volatility which is like
303.72s: the orange and then historical
305.76s: volatility which is the yellow if you're
307.88s: selling volatility into earnings what
309.88s: you want to see is the Orange Line
312.36s: remain above the yellow line after
315.20s: earnings that means that implied
317.04s: volatility was estimated much higher
318.84s: than the realized move a good example of
320.52s: that is right here you can see that
322.72s: leading into earnings implied volatility
324.84s: was at 49 and change following earnings
328.04s: it cratered to 37 so nice big IV
331.36s: contraction and then the realized move
333.40s: was with in tolerance it was with within
335.68s: bounds so this would be a profitable
337.68s: something like a short stradle short
338.88s: strangle for the the earnings release
341.00s: itself so this now leads to some ideas
345.56s: if you have a really strong bullish
347.72s: thesis in Nvidia then again you can kind
351.44s: of play this propensity for gapping to
354.32s: the upside and then even the follow on
356.72s: drift which peed is what it's called
359.64s: post earnings announcement drift is a
361.28s: thing there's certain conditions that
363.60s: have to be met for it to exist but let's
366.00s: take a look at this for example here
368.04s: earnings were expected at
370.04s: $514 it came in at 612 really big really
373.60s: big beat then we can see that there is
375.96s: clearly a strong Gap following earnings
379.60s: that generally leads to drift over the
383.08s: following quarter so now this the
385.72s: interesting part about the the drift
387.04s: that you experienced here it did go
388.36s: through that August dip but before the
391.12s: August dip that was seen across the
392.76s: whole Market it was up and Off to the
394.52s: Races and same thing similar here the
397.80s: main note I'm making is that stuff like
399.84s: post earnings announcement drift
401.08s: definitely is a little bit weaker in
403.32s: super super super big market cap
405.20s: companies like Nvidia but if it has a
407.56s: good enough earnings release it doesn't
409.04s: matter it can still exhibit it which it
410.64s: has here it has here this was a little
413.88s: bit different it didn't have the correct
415.80s: conditions and this is one of the
416.88s: instances where it actually contracted
418.68s: post earnings so now for the upcoming
420.96s: earnings release we have some conjecture
424.96s: around how aggressive the expectations
428.16s: have become and what that subsequently
431.20s: might mean for the performance of Nvidia
433.52s: because sooner or later the analysts
436.84s: projecting what EPS might look like they
439.32s: can get a little too aggressive which
441.68s: even though the growth might look really
443.76s: good if it still doesn't top
445.72s: expectations that's problematic and it
448.52s: typically leads to
450.32s: the market not really digging the
452.04s: movements so let's take a look at the
454.76s: options chain really quick and let's see
456.64s: how we're actually positioned we're
457.96s: about equal on calls to puts total open
461.60s: interest let's take a look at oi
464.04s: obviously that captures earnings which
465.72s: would be 22 no we can see that we're
468.84s: looking at a million calls against
471.92s: 850,000 puts so definitely call skew
474.32s: meaningful call skew the reason why I
476.04s: call this meaningful call skew is in big
477.80s: companies like this a lot of people
479.52s: typically hold tons and tons of shares
481.80s: so a lot of people will actually come in
483.64s: and hedge on the put side even though
485.68s: they're not
486.72s: necessarily thinking that they're
488.40s: playing it directionally to the downside
490.16s: a lot of times what you see over here is
492.00s: to offset long options so when you see
495.40s: instances like this where the calls
497.96s: still overwhelm the put side even from
500.60s: that structural perspective that
502.40s: generally is quite bullish now
504.72s: distribution of strikes is kind of what
506.72s: you would expect to see a lot of it is
508.56s: at the money of the money stuff like
510.40s: just slightly out of the money there's
511.60s: some super far out of the money stuff
513.24s: and a quick reminder just when you see
515.08s: these really far out of the money
516.20s: options it doesn't necessarily mean
517.80s: anybody thinks it's going to 250 per se
520.92s: it just means that they're expecting it
522.16s: to go up and as long as it goes up
524.52s: enough following earnings then these can
526.92s: show a profit so that that's the pl here
528.96s: for these people now last thing I want
531.12s: to look at is volatility so let's take a
534.48s: look at the VA surface and you can see
538.28s: that the put side is actually trading
540.16s: more richly in terms of va than the call
542.20s: side now this is a more standard
545.12s: structure than what you'll see in things
547.00s: that are like hyper hyper bullish it was
548.84s: funny because I was actually watching
549.96s: CNBC and um there was a woman on there
552.24s: talking about her expectation of call
554.48s: skew which I honestly was expecting to
556.08s: see here but I don't see it as it sits
559.28s: right now right now it looks like the
560.92s: market is still pricing up the downside
563.40s: a little bit more and again this doesn't
564.96s: mean that the market is necessarily
566.28s: expecting downside you generally would
568.36s: expect this see put skew like this and
571.08s: it's because people are buying puts to
573.40s: hedge to the downside people who are
575.00s: selling puts coming into this thing
576.84s: demand a premium to do that now when you
580.16s: see stuff that has really massive call
582.16s: skew on the Tails where the IV is higher
585.00s: than the putside that's generally
587.96s: leading us towards a expectation of a
590.48s: upside move again it doesn't mean that
591.64s: you're going to get it but it means that
593.16s: you're paying a premium to play it to
595.32s: the upside in this case it has a much
597.28s: normal normal relationship let's take a
599.76s: quick look at uh 20 D just kind of the
602.00s: next primary expiration same same and
604.80s: then I just want to take a look at oi
607.68s: for this as
610.00s: well and huge call skue now just to show
613.60s: you what I did I'm looking I looked at
615.44s: the 22 no first the reason why I look at
617.32s: the 22 no first is because the people
620.24s: that are in 22 no are purposefully
622.36s: exposing themselves to earnings they're
624.00s: trying to play earnings whereas people
626.16s: that are in 20ds still might be trying
628.16s: to play earnings but a lot of lot of
629.48s: times you'll find bigger positions out
631.36s: here in the primary expirations because
633.40s: they're going to be more liquid also if
635.72s: you're trading something like this
637.44s: directionally going a little further out
639.40s: in time doesn't bother you as long as
641.04s: you're gaining Deltas because as long as
643.00s: you get your move in your favor you're
644.52s: not actually going to experience the
646.12s: same contraction and implied volatility
648.08s: immediately following the release so
650.20s: this overall looks pretty well
652.20s: positioned for uh like a a bullish
655.36s: expectation now the way that I look at
657.96s: playing something like this is again if
659.80s: you want to play to the upside you have
661.28s: to be careful because you never know
663.04s: when the script changes and you walk
664.40s: into something like this but in general
666.28s: the downside definitely looks a little
668.04s: bit more muted compared to the upside
670.64s: Gap potential that we've seen a few
672.16s: times more recently so I think longer
675.84s: term positions should be you know held
678.28s: you know based on how you feel about the
680.96s: company longer term I had longer term
683.12s: options that I took down actually to let
685.80s: it go through earnings I might play
687.56s: earnings itself I have to see how
689.36s: options look tomorrow and then I'll lay
691.80s: the longer term stuff back out uh
694.52s: depending on how it performs but right
696.20s: now Nvidia is still really well
697.80s: positioned super strong so as always
699.64s: anything you want me to take a look at
700.80s: let me know be an outlier I'll see you
702.32s: later
