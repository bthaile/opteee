1.04s: have you been here before or have you
4.00s: been here before or here or here this
9.36s: video is about managing options
12.16s: positions the whole idea is to walk
15.20s: through what's going on in these
17.40s: scenarios because they all have elements
20.28s: in common so this person's asking what I
23.76s: don't understand is why I am still down
27.44s: considerably even though the stock
30.20s: nearly recovered this person says if I
32.84s: leave the option as is will it mean that
34.72s: it will expire worthless and I don't
36.44s: have to pay anything this person's
38.72s: saying I need help with an exit strategy
41.28s: on my 20 contracts of gme and then this
44.68s: person is waiting for the dip to then
48.28s: buy more for this hype here's what's
51.80s: going on these are all people that are
55.40s: not carefully thinking through what
58.28s: they're doing ahead of time and as
60.92s: annoying and as boring as that sounds
64.24s: that's where money is made in trading is
68.04s: by being very thoughtful about what
70.52s: you're trying to do so that what you do
74.32s: over the long run makes sense let's Dive
77.24s: Right In the first thing we need to
78.56s: start with is some context this is a
81.08s: study that you should absolutely look at
83.44s: it's called the behavior of individual
85.00s: investors it's by Barbera in Odin I
87.08s: reference this all the time it's an old
88.68s: study it's from 2012 however there are
91.28s: two things I really want to draw your
92.72s: attention to these two right here this
95.52s: study is about the behavior of
98.56s: individual retail investors or Traders
101.12s: it applies to both of the groups and
103.40s: they find a bunch of specific habits
107.24s: that sabotage them these two are
109.92s: important for you and for this video the
112.52s: first one is the tendency to sell
116.12s: winning Investments while holding losing
118.96s: Investments this is called the
120.08s: disposition effect we enjoy the
122.52s: experience of booking a win it affirms
125.60s: our ego we were right we also like
128.44s: making money who doesn't like that the
130.96s: process of taking a winning trade down
132.80s: is so easy and you've also probably
135.28s: heard a lot of really bad information
137.88s: like nobody goes broke by taking profits
141.24s: yeah you actually can you actually can
143.52s: and I'm going to show you how so it's
146.00s: not so much about any one individual
149.92s: trade it's about a system of Trades the
153.08s: process that you follow which we'll talk
154.88s: about the second component here is naive
157.96s: reinforcement this is where we
160.40s: essentially repeat behaviors that we
163.04s: enjoyed and avoid behaviors that we
165.72s: don't like so a behavior like losing a
170.12s: position and closing a losing position
171.76s: that sucks so the propensity is going
173.96s: forward to avoid doing that or the
176.68s: process of really going through in-depth
179.20s: and analy izing what you're doing that's
182.24s: another painful process because you're
183.72s: going to see a lot of things that you're
184.80s: doing that you may not like and guess
188.08s: what it's still part of the process it's
189.88s: still part of this entire thing that
192.52s: overtime pieces together into being a
196.04s: profitable Trader long term that's the
199.48s: goal here because if your goal is to
202.20s: just try to maximize any one individual
204.64s: trade the overwhelming probability is
207.40s: you're not going to be good at this long
208.76s: term and it's because it takes a process
211.44s: oriented approach to create success in
213.72s: trading if you have a streak of winning
215.84s: trades if you have a streak of winning
217.12s: trades for five years that still doesn't
220.36s: matter it doesn't matter unless you're
222.00s: going to stop at the 5-year Mark take
224.00s: your Chips and walk away then it
225.60s: mattered but if you're going to continue
227.68s: trading and you built a bunch of bad
229.40s: habits you can still lose all of that
231.88s: money you built over five years let's
235.52s: dive into how to not lose that money so
240.16s: there's a couple things I want to
241.24s: highlight this is from a deck that I've
243.36s: been building kind of a reference deck
245.04s: but I really want to draw your attention
246.96s: to these components this is the decision
248.84s: cycle realistically as it applies to
250.80s: managing an options position the first
253.60s: thing is managing a position based on
255.88s: profit and loss meaning you should have
258.96s: defined profit and loss targets if you
262.00s: have a position that hits either of
264.04s: those then it's time to manage or at
265.48s: least evaluate the position does the
268.48s: individual position still align with
271.08s: your portfolio objectives so what this
273.48s: looks like is if you're overall bullish
275.32s: in the market and you have a position
277.12s: that's bearish does that position make
279.44s: sense maybe it does maybe it offsets
281.32s: some of your long Deltas maybe it
282.80s: doesn't maybe that position is morphed
285.32s: over time into something that doesn't
287.48s: align or fit with the broader portfolio
290.64s: but this is the second step the third
292.80s: step is have you been in the trade long
295.56s: enough meaning your thesis is disproven
298.68s: or is it coming up on an expiration
301.16s: cycle where it's time to manage your
303.48s: trade so there's two different examples
306.00s: in here the first one is if you buy an
308.36s: option and you're coming up on an
310.08s: expiration cycle maybe you still want
312.16s: the position to be on your idea is still
313.72s: intact but you're now at the point where
316.24s: Theta Decay is really accelerating maybe
319.52s: it's time to adjust that position based
321.28s: on the time that you've been into the
322.92s: trade or you might at the onset of your
326.08s: trade say well I'm waiting for a
328.20s: breakout in stock X Y or Z and once I
331.84s: get that breakout then I'm going to
334.40s: manage my profit here my loss here but
337.68s: if you're trading options they all
339.60s: expire so you can't wait for a breakout
341.92s: indefinitely even if you're an investor
344.40s: if you hold a stock that's going
346.04s: sideways for long enough There's an
347.60s: opportunity cost to tying up your money
350.48s: in something that's not moving so time
354.00s: is really important the last two
356.48s: decision points is there some sort of
359.00s: new event coming up that forces you to
362.84s: think about your position differently so
365.08s: if you're looking at something like
366.12s: GameStop and you know that it has
368.48s: earnings coming up on the 4th of
371.28s: September that's an event so if you're
373.76s: building options positions in this you
376.84s: have to know that this is coming up and
378.56s: you have to decide whether or not you
380.08s: want to hold through earnings which tend
383.24s: to be pretty volatile it could also be
386.16s: just broader news that's come out for
388.40s: example maybe small caps hasn't been
390.64s: performing well and you've been fading
393.52s: small caps but then this past weekend
396.20s: after there was that assassination
399.32s: attempt and now the market is attempting
401.56s: to price in the probability of somebody
404.00s: that's more Market favorable in general
405.88s: in the eyes of the market coming into
407.36s: office against the now changing rate
411.40s: expectations and then all of a sudden
413.80s: your position starts going the exact
416.04s: opposite direction there was a series of
418.12s: events that started tra ing different
420.24s: Market behaviors that you should be
422.36s: aware of because for example maybe you
425.80s: on the 11th when we first started
427.60s: getting glimpses of the rate picture
430.48s: changing maybe when this happened it
432.92s: might not have hit your profit or loss
435.04s: Target just yet but if you're trading
436.76s: this to the downside and you see this
439.20s: big gap up and this new changing event
442.56s: you now have to revisit your thesis does
445.92s: this new event does this time in trade
448.96s: does my portfolio disposition do any of
452.68s: those
453.44s: inputs impact my trade thesis or require
456.60s: an adjustment so now the question is how
460.00s: do we know how do we know when we're
462.12s: looking at profit and loss management
464.92s: how do we know if it makes sense to
466.16s: close a trade down well first and
467.76s: foremost this needs to be decided before
471.32s: you enter a trade not while you're in it
473.96s: the reason for that is when you are in a
476.04s: trade you have risk on whether you are
479.60s: close to a robot seemingly emotionless
481.68s: or not you still have subconscious
483.84s: processing and you know from what we
486.56s: talked about way back here that you are
488.84s: fighting a lot of innate behaviors that
491.84s: are baked into your psyche baked into
493.56s: your biological processing the way that
495.88s: human beings view commensurate risk and
499.00s: rewards once a baseline threshold is
501.84s: sustained is different we don't view
503.92s: them the same it's a literally a
505.80s: psychological underpinning from your
508.12s: longstanding biology based on Survival
511.40s: so punchline to all of this figure it
515.12s: out before you place your trade it
517.80s: doesn't have to be Resolute and there
519.40s: are different things you can do while
520.44s: you're in the trade which we'll talk
521.56s: about so this very first concept I'm
524.24s: going to share with you is that of
526.16s: expected return now remember back
528.16s: towards the beginning of the video that
529.92s: I outlined that you can have a system
533.68s: that performs really well for a long
536.16s: time so in this example I'm showing you
538.24s: a system that has one 190 winning trades
541.52s: just 10 losing trades the total number
543.96s: of Trades there is 200 so you have a 95%
547.16s: chance of winning and just a 5% chance
551.40s: of losing yet if we look at this system
555.28s: it can still be not profitable how could
559.28s: that possibly be I'm going to show you
562.44s: if you have an average win size of $10
565.52s: you might say well that's not a lot at
567.00s: all yeah well you're winning all the
568.52s: time you're not going to win a bunch of
570.40s: money if you're winning all the time
572.44s: this is the example of take your profits
575.04s: take your profits quick don't be greedy
576.96s: sounds really smart don't be greedy
578.92s: you're not supposed to be greedy so
580.16s: there's a psychological component of not
581.96s: doing something that's looked down upon
583.64s: by society and you're also looking at
585.80s: something thinking that oh yeah I'm
587.56s: being sophisticated I shouldn't be
589.20s: greedy that means this should work in my
591.12s: favor wrong mindset entirely really you
594.60s: should be taking good risk reward trades
598.84s: if you have have of those 10 trades your
601.64s: average loser is $190 you can then have
605.60s: 10 trades that come up to a total of
608.16s: $190 on average you are now
611.56s: flat you've made 200 trades and you are
615.00s: flat this is not including opportunity
617.60s: cost of your money this is not including
619.08s: fees what I'm demonstrating to you is
621.64s: that you can absolutely have a massively
624.68s: High win rate you can have a bunch of
627.84s: winning traits and a a handful of losing
630.24s: trades can undo literally all of them
634.36s: every single one of them so this is why
637.32s: expected return is so important we can
641.48s: use this to guide our decisions when
644.32s: we're placing trades so now I want to
646.88s: look at an example with you let's take a
649.32s: peek again at GameStop you want to get
651.64s: into these 30 calls that are at the
653.08s: money that are 31 days out you can do
655.12s: that and you look to get into them for
657.84s: about $435
659.76s: they're 57 Delta so let's analyze that
662.32s: trade it looks like this so how can we
664.92s: figure out what our expected return is
667.40s: it's very simple what you need to do is
670.00s: figure out where you think this thing
671.96s: might go to the upside and where it
674.08s: might go to the downside and the
676.28s: corresponding probabilities so let's
679.28s: figure out how to do that if I take a
681.48s: look at a chart here and I'm just
683.96s: analyzing GameStop maybe I think that
685.84s: there's a floor here based off of this
688.36s: one July swing low and that floor looks
691.48s: something around 23 and change maybe I
693.76s: can scoot it up a little bit cuz there's
695.84s: three of these candles here and you want
697.80s: to manage your risk kind of quick so
699.80s: maybe you're looking at something just
701.32s: shy of 24 24ish that would be your
704.72s: downside management you are determining
707.00s: ahead of time based on your technical
708.96s: analysis or whatever tools you like to
710.64s: use that if you see price fall in this
713.76s: case below 24 You're Going to exit to
715.76s: the downside and book a loss so we're
718.64s: defining things
719.96s: where do we think it might go to the
721.36s: upside it's hard to tell especially with
723.12s: something like GameStop but as I look at
725.60s: this it seems like there's not a bunch
727.40s: of overhead resistance so maybe we
730.12s: target something around this but if you
732.68s: want to be conservative you could pick
734.48s: something kind of in the middle so in
736.52s: this case 35 bucks something like that
738.76s: it's above this previous high it's
741.76s: something that's based off of elevation
744.48s: above this consolidation period it's
746.72s: above the high here slightly and it's
749.56s: giving you a little bit of room to run
751.84s: but we're not targeting highs
753.88s: necessarily because you may or may not
756.04s: get there this is a conservative
757.84s: estimation so using 35 bucks Target to
760.72s: the upside 35 bucks Target to the
763.08s: downside is sub 24 so now what we need
766.56s: to do is figure out what the trade would
769.00s: be worth at both of those points so if
773.32s: we look at 35 bucks that'll give you
776.48s: about
777.52s: $350 profit
779.80s: if we look at $24 to the downside
782.28s: that'll give you like - 263 is so in
785.68s: this case I have us marked at a $341
788.96s: profit to the upside given that Target
790.92s: that I just shared with you and then to
792.96s: the downside about 265 but you'll notice
795.68s: that there's probabilities in here how
797.08s: do I figure out these probabilities you
799.40s: can use options the cool part about them
802.28s: so we can take a look either at
805.16s: something called a risk profile you can
808.16s: use a tool like this that analyzes
810.32s: probabilities for you this is just using
811.76s: the options chains and I'll show you in
813.44s: the options as well don't worry but we
815.56s: can take a look at the probability of
817.08s: touching why do we not need in the money
819.16s: out of the money well because if we're
821.44s: planning on managing when price gets to
823.44s: those levels the probability of a touch
825.92s: is higher than the probability of
827.72s: expiring in the money and if you don't
829.64s: need to take it all the way into
831.60s: expiration then you don't need to use
833.64s: the lower probability you can use the
835.00s: realistic probability of a touch so we
837.16s: can go to our expiration cycle which is
839.60s: about 30 days out I think we're looking
841.84s: at the 16 August which are right here
844.08s: and we can say what's the probability of
845.76s: hitting our profit of 35 bucks and it is
850.12s: about
850.92s: 64% what's the probability of hitting
853.08s: our loss of 24 just south of 24
856.24s: realistically we'll call it like
859.36s: 25 let's go sub
862.44s: 24 we'll pretend we get out below that
864.76s: it's like 70% now so it's actually a
867.12s: little higher than when I first made
868.28s: this for you it was 6 5% so we'll keep
870.28s: it as this but that's what you would do
872.56s: now if you don't want to use the risk
875.64s: profile tool that's cool you can also
877.28s: use the options so you can take a look
879.76s: at the options chain and you can say
882.04s: well you're buying the 30s that's okay
883.72s: but what's the probability that we touch
886.28s: 35 and you can take a look literally
889.24s: right here at the probability of a touch
891.64s: 64.5% typically speaking the probability
894.64s: of a touch will be about about two times
898.44s: the delta it does not work in very
901.28s: volatile products right because the
902.92s: Delta here is a 44 Delta so that would
905.56s: be 88% probability of a touch so in
908.68s: normal products you can do that so to
910.88s: give you an example of this what it
912.72s: would look like in something that's a
913.76s: little bit more normal if we take a look
916.24s: at this 40
918.48s: Delta call in iwm same expiration 31
922.28s: days out the 40 Delta 2 times that is 80
925.36s: the probability of a touch here is 73.32
928.04s: per. right so it's close but in
930.44s: something like GameStop that's volatile
932.36s: very volatile it's not going to be as
934.32s: accurate the other thing to know about
936.12s: using Delta is a probability of
938.08s: something being in the money or a
939.52s: probability of touching is the further
941.80s: out in time you go the less accurate it
944.48s: is I've an entire video that dives into
947.00s: this I'll link that in the notes below
948.60s: Delta is a probability for those
950.08s: interested so just know that Delta can
952.48s: be used shorter term time frames less
954.84s: volatile products anything other than
956.60s: that it's very inaccurate and it's going
958.60s: to negatively impact your calculations
961.28s: which are important calculations that
962.84s: we're doing the next one we need to
964.76s: figure out the probability of touching
966.64s: the 24s by 31 August and you can see
969.00s: actually from the options chain it
970.76s: mirrors more similarly to what I had in
973.04s: there so these are a 22 Delta two times
975.76s: that would be a
977.08s: 44% probability of a touch but it's
979.56s: actually
981.48s: 63.4% so you notice these are close
983.76s: enough right this is based on when I
985.20s: took it a little earlier today so now we
988.00s: can calculate what what the expected
989.80s: return is on this opportunity so the
992.88s: expected return is
996.00s: $45.99 so why is it why is this positive
999.40s: why do we have an R multiple of 1.29
1001.76s: well because even though the
1003.32s: probabilities are pretty close they're
1005.12s: very similar to one another this you
1007.44s: have the probability of making more
1008.64s: money than you're going to lose so even
1011.24s: though this might be a lower probability
1013.80s: trade it still can yield a little bit
1017.64s: more of a profit potential so we need to
1021.32s: continue through our
1024.12s: example so there I attach to you the
1028.64s: expected return here I attach to you the
1031.28s: r multiple this is the exact process you
1035.04s: can take to evaluate an individual trade
1038.72s: this is an individual trade as I
1040.72s: outlined before it is important to do
1043.44s: this for an entire system of Trades so
1046.80s: for example that's when you build your
1049.36s: process when you're buying options and
1051.36s: you say okay well I'm not going to do 31
1053.12s: days to expiration because they theya de
1054.88s: case too fast so I'm going to go further
1056.28s: out than 60 days and you codify what you
1059.20s: do that's the process of building a
1060.88s: strategy I will link a video in the
1063.76s: notes Below on this process of building
1066.84s: a strategy so that then you can bake
1069.48s: this component of managing options
1071.36s: positions and expected return into that
1074.12s: process so you have a comprehensive
1076.72s: approach that is much more likely to
1079.68s: yield success than the halfhazard
1081.64s: process of buying random ass options the
1084.88s: last thing I'm going to throw in the
1085.88s: notes below is a video on buying options
1088.52s: smarter I continue to push that video
1090.76s: because I think it's so important for
1092.52s: people to see it I see all the time
1094.80s: people talking about well I don't want
1096.36s: to buy the 40s because I don't think
1097.72s: it's going to go to 40 it doesn't matter
1099.36s: if it goes to 40 if it goes up you start
1101.12s: to make money anyways that video goes
1103.28s: through all of those kinds of details as
1105.36s: always any questions let me know be an
1108.24s: outlier share with your friends see you
1110.56s: guys later
