0.00s: What's up, outliers?
1.48s: Quick market update today.
2.78s: I specifically want to talk about the Fed Watch tool.
6.32s: And the reason why I want to talk about this is because the markets are all over the
11.02s: place right now.
12.62s: And I think traders may or may not fully comprehend what's going on behind the scenes.
18.84s: So I actually want to talk about what I'm seeing behind the scenes.
22.84s: So first let's grab the futures.
25.44s: And let's take a look first at Bond behavior.
29.48s: So we have ZNZT both down pretty significantly and trailing down hard.
37.00s: And if we pop over to the chart and we take a look at the corresponding yields, you'll
42.00s: notice exactly what you would expect to see.
45.36s: Something like the 10 year is now up over 4% again.
49.92s: This is not good.
51.28s: From a broad market perspective, this is not good.
54.16s: And I as hopefully now, I'm not in the game of doom and gloom hyperbole.
60.44s: I really avoid those kind of like language patterns so that what I say means what I'm
66.68s: trying to say.
68.36s: This is not good.
69.52s: The reason why this is not good is because it really starts to call into question what
73.80s: terminal rates will look like and what this whole inflation and rate cutting pictures
80.08s: going to look like.
81.40s: And it's changing rapidly.
83.76s: So let's take a look at the Fed watch tool.
88.04s: And I want to show you something.
89.92s: If we look back a week ago, there was a 0% probability of no change.
97.76s: Then we look back a day ago.
99.56s: It's 15%.
101.48s: We look at it today.
102.64s: It's down to 14%.
105.32s: If we take a look at the probability for a 50 basis point cut a week ago, it was over
110.44s: 36%.
112.40s: Now it's been zero for yesterday and today.
116.24s: The probability of 25 bips is 85%.
120.84s: What I want to show you is if we take a look at the historical price pattern of this movement
127.08s: and what this means for us is that the market is quite literally all over the board.
135.48s: We do not have this price didn't yet.
137.72s: It's not priced in accurately it being whether or not we're going to get another cut.
142.68s: How big the cut is the impact to the cut.
145.88s: This is all completely up for grabs right now.
149.52s: Because if you take a look at the probability here of us essentially remaining no change,
158.88s: the probability for that hit zero starting on what the 19th, that's this green line by
164.40s: the way.
165.40s: If this is a little too noisy for you, that's the current probability for the market.
167.72s: No change is the green line.
170.36s: And we can see that if we go back to 22 July, it was 53%.
177.20s: And then it cratered in the early August during that decline to what 5% skyrocketed back
186.24s: up over the next two weeks to 61%.
189.60s: And then another month or so cratered to zero.
193.92s: And now it's back up to 15.6%.
197.84s: This is all over the place.
201.76s: So what does this mean for markets?
203.76s: Well, it tells me two really important features.
208.08s: The first one.
209.40s: This is the same exact trade that I reviewed not too long ago in the Russell where it made
214.36s: over $100,000.
215.36s: It's like the course of a week.
217.44s: And it was essentially playing a single move based on some of what I'm seeing here.
224.28s: And it's entirely about when does this get priced in?
228.04s: When does the start, when does the market start moving off of this information, which right
232.48s: now it's all over the map.
235.76s: When you see this kind of change and you see this being all over the map, it tells me
240.48s: that this is not priced in efficiently and that we are bouncing based on every little
245.44s: bit of new data that's coming in causing near 20% swings over the course of a couple
250.64s: days.
251.64s: That's huge.
252.80s: So when I think about trading the market in a broad perspective, it's we're hanging
256.80s: near highs yet I see 10 year yield up over 4%.
261.68s: So it's this is a series of red flashing signs that are kind of all over the place to
267.52s: me.
268.68s: So the way I look at this is keeping the cards really close to the chest.
274.20s: That's exactly how I'm positioning because if you look at small caps, they're not showing
278.84s: you this 25 or even 50 bips cut.
282.16s: They've been running flat after a decline from the previous cut, not showing us anything.
288.44s: We are however seen volatility expand.
291.12s: We are seeing tech run sideways now for what is this?
295.76s: A month almost, I mean, depending on where you want to call it, starting to peak, it's
300.28s: been about a month that we've started this rally.
303.12s: And then it slowed down essentially from the 19th on.
305.80s: It's just been rolling sideways.
308.52s: And then we see E minis, S&P 500 hovering right near all time highs, but also massively
315.96s: consolidating all of that is indecision.
320.36s: This is people are not necessarily wanting to weigh to heavily right now one way or the
325.64s: other.
327.44s: Let's take a look at the cop report.
331.60s: If we flip through here, you can see a couple really noteworthy things.
337.92s: Again, we're focusing primarily not on commercials, but we want large speculators, the green line.
344.44s: Take a look at the movement in their positioning.
347.56s: We hit an extreme in 2023 about the summer.
352.12s: They started rolling up positioning net positive, April.
357.08s: And we've been hovering net positive, net negative, but take a look at the change from
362.68s: 16 September.
365.64s: This was running at negative 35,000.
368.32s: And then if you look at it today, 70, I'm sorry, 7,500, 7550.
375.36s: So speculators are very, very clearly positioning here.
380.00s: Now again, this is for the E minis.
382.84s: So this is difficult to use.
384.52s: You kind of have to use it when it's at extremes, but this kind of movement pattern again,
389.52s: look how jagged this is.
391.68s: This is large speculators flipping positions very, very readily.
396.48s: And it's not a defined trend, right?
398.40s: So you can see periods where they'll flip the positions, but it's almost like a stair
401.76s: step.
402.76s: There's still a defined trend in there.
403.96s: That's not what we see in their positioning right now.
406.44s: It is quite literally all over the map.
409.68s: And this is the last we saw again.
411.84s: When I say today, this is for the 30th, it lags a little bit.
416.20s: So I am really eager to see how this ends up resolving in the near future.
422.52s: The name of the game is keep a really close eye on this probability because based on how
427.12s: this goes, based on some of the inflation data that we're seeing coming up soon, it
432.00s: is going to be supremely topical.
434.52s: One other thing that I want to show you is if we pop up the VIX, it doesn't look that
439.08s: busy, right?
440.08s: It's definitely popping a little bit.
441.64s: Low 20s.
442.64s: There's nothing here that really jumps out at me.
444.96s: But then if we go into the options, let's take a look at the volume today.
450.72s: 430,000 calls against 233,000 puts.
455.88s: Take a look at where most of these calls are.
460.16s: They're short dated.
462.16s: We have 16, 25s.
464.36s: There's 33,000 of those that traded.
467.68s: Then we have the same 16, up 45s, 22,000 of those gone.
473.16s: This is really interesting front positioning in options that you do not typically see.
480.52s: It is very strange.
483.00s: So if we look at the open interest and we take a look at this 16, there's 3.6 million
489.08s: calls against 2 million puts.
492.12s: And if we look at all series, it's about 9.5 million.
495.48s: So a critical density of that is short term options, which again is a little less common.
501.60s: A lot of times you'll see it like this where if we go further out in time, you'll notice
505.72s: that on the primary expiration this January, it'll typically be pretty high.
510.76s: And then I'm guessing we'll see around the election also very high 2.4 million.
516.52s: So this is expectation of a near term movement.
520.24s: Like that's really what this boils down to.
523.04s: And we have CPI, PPI coming up.
525.60s: This looks like it's hard to tell if it's speculating pure downside of people hedging,
529.80s: but this looks like something's going on.
531.56s: So I am preparing my portfolio for that scenario.
534.36s: And then again, if nothing happens, great.
535.92s: That's beautiful.
536.92s: Roll on and simply reposition.
539.04s: But right now is not a time that I'm adding a ton of risk.
542.00s: I'm keeping what I have out very, very close to the chest, meaning ready to move exit
547.84s: flattened adjust is needed.
549.88s: Just because all of this looks very strange to me.
552.08s: So any questions, anything I should take a look at?
554.36s: Let me know, be an outlier.
555.36s: See you all later.
