0.96s: hey everyone eric here uh up with the
3.04s: next
3.76s: segment of small stacks and what i
6.72s: wanted to walk through
7.84s: is how i'm building my watch list and
10.72s: then
11.68s: what positions i'm looking at for my
13.92s: initial outlay
15.76s: now what i want to say up front is if
17.76s: there's anything that you all would add
19.52s: to the watch list
20.64s: feel free let me know i'm happy to put
22.72s: anything in here it has been a while
25.44s: admittedly where i've been constrained
28.72s: by price so it is a good skill set to
31.76s: refresh there are definitely a lot of
33.60s: trade-offs
34.64s: that need to be made but i still am
37.36s: pretty comfortable with some of the
38.88s: products that i dug up
40.72s: so let's get right to it
44.24s: so first off for the watch list
46.00s: development these are a few things that
47.76s: i'm you know keeping an eye on i
49.36s: definitely
50.00s: would prefer items within the s p 500
52.48s: prefer weeklies
53.68s: notice the word prefer is i stopped
56.16s: writing it but it's essentially for all
57.52s: of these
58.48s: whereas when i trade my normal account
61.28s: and
61.68s: price doesn't really matter that much
64.16s: you know these become
65.44s: hard and fast i won't trade something
68.16s: that
69.28s: if i'm trading let's say the coverage
71.44s: strangle
72.32s: i won't trade something that doesn't
73.84s: have a at least a two percent yield
76.32s: whereas there's a lot of sacrifice that
79.76s: needs to be made
80.64s: in smaller accounts and it's just how it
84.00s: goes
84.64s: so that's why you see the word prefer so
86.64s: much same thing with weeklies
88.56s: if it doesn't have weeklies in my normal
90.24s: account i don't touch it whereas
92.16s: there's one of my trades i'm looking at
94.08s: doesn't have weeklies
95.60s: it's just a function of having to make
98.24s: trade-offs in smaller accounts
100.56s: so these are a couple things that i'm
101.92s: looking at and then i also have my
104.56s: general fundamental technical analysis i
106.80s: already have videos on those
108.40s: so i didn't go through listing them all
110.00s: out but just wanted to share a few of
111.76s: the
112.32s: first items that i'm looking at and then
115.44s: you know we'll go from there so the next
117.76s: thing i want to highlight
119.28s: is part of my approach for the smaller
122.24s: account
122.72s: is going to be a hybrid of the sector
125.84s: rotation strategy
127.52s: meaning i want to take a look at the
128.96s: three-month and 30-day
130.80s: performance of the sectors and kind of
133.28s: pick things
134.48s: better in the top four or five again
137.52s: in general this isn't to say that i
140.64s: won't
141.12s: pick something that's um further down
144.80s: provided that it's been performing well
146.80s: over the previous
148.08s: you know three months 30 days so i'm
151.36s: kind of cross referencing them and like
153.60s: i said performing a bit of a hybrid here
156.72s: so here's the watch list as it sits
160.32s: this is the first pass like i said i'm
163.52s: not kind of building this out super far
165.52s: just yet i'm generally focusing on
167.28s: things that are
167.92s: 60 and less while the account is
171.12s: starting just at five
172.88s: i kept it at 50 or less my goal
176.32s: is to be able to maintain at least two
179.44s: positions
180.88s: i do not want to have all of the account
183.36s: in one ticker
184.64s: so that leads me to the lower end
187.84s: of this spectrum and
192.08s: these ones are kind of some i don't know
194.72s: i
195.76s: my initial thought was calling these out
198.64s: because i probably will try to focus on
200.56s: them
201.36s: but as i was going through a little bit
203.84s: of my fundamental analysis
205.36s: it didn't turn out to be so much the
207.04s: case so
208.40s: you could essentially ignore the handful
211.12s: of bullets i have there
213.12s: okay and let's talk about the initial
216.56s: outlay these are the two trades i'm
217.92s: looking at i'm looking at mosaic
220.72s: selling 1 25 september 17
224.80s: put collecting 53 cents and then in dxc
228.40s: i'm looking at selling 1 18 september 18
231.92s: put collecting 55 cents so this is
235.52s: again preliminary i did not dig in too
238.64s: far just yet to make sure that
240.32s: everything checks out
241.92s: however on my initial pass both of these
245.68s: look to be okay now of note i
248.96s: really don't like trading mosaic up here
251.36s: so there's a good chance
252.72s: i will wait to establish this trade as
256.24s: compared to putting it on at the same
258.00s: time as dxc
259.84s: and the reason why i picked these two is
263.12s: i guess a couple pieces the first one
266.88s: is i definitely want some it exposure
271.04s: which is what dxc
272.48s: satisfies for me and then mosaic
276.08s: i like because if we pull up their
279.12s: fundamentals from a
283.20s: just one materials perspective i don't
286.00s: feel
286.40s: super passionate about that per se but
289.44s: when i look at something that's been
290.80s: fairly stable after the drop
293.60s: i definitely think mosaic is there so
297.12s: that's how this one ended up on the list
300.08s: so what i'm going to do
301.36s: is probably establish dxc
305.28s: tomorrow and then i'm going to wait
308.32s: on mosaic and i'm going to wait and see
310.96s: how they react
312.64s: to you know recent price levels and then
315.68s: go from there there's a
317.20s: solid chance that i will deviate and go
319.44s: somewhere else but
320.40s: again we'll see what the market shows me
322.64s: right now if we look at both of these
324.32s: trades they
325.12s: come out to be a 31 return on invested
328.88s: capital which is a great return
330.80s: and on the entire portfolio it would be
333.28s: a 2.6
334.96s: return on capital using
338.16s: realistically a pretty small subset if
341.36s: we
341.68s: add these up it comes out to 70 percent
345.44s: or so
346.40s: and the reason why i call it a quote
347.92s: unquote small subset is to have
349.84s: two positions on in a 5k account while
352.64s: cash securing is tough
354.40s: so that's what i meant by that but we're
356.32s: still like said 70
358.16s: invested which it's a good return for
360.96s: for that level of investment
362.64s: so we'll take a look at what tomorrow
364.88s: shows us and then
366.00s: i will share an update once we get the
368.64s: trades on
369.28s: all right talk to y'all later
