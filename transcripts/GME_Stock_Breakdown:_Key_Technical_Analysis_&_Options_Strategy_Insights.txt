0.64s: what's up to the Apes a humble welcome
2.84s: to the outlier trading Channel today as
5.72s: promised I'm going to take a look at
6.92s: GameStop I had a couple questions asking
9.60s: just to look into recent price
11.24s: performance and whatnot the last time I
12.72s: did a video on this was this weekend so
14.84s: it's about time just to touch base on
16.64s: things as you know I've been doing
17.88s: videos every day however it's been a
21.04s: little bit quiet in here so I'm not
22.68s: doing GameStop every single day I'm kind
24.52s: of looking through the markets and
25.76s: trying to share different things I'm
27.00s: looking at but today will be about
29.56s: GameStop
30.56s: so quick admin note tomorrow I'm doing a
33.28s: live stream at 1700 Pacific time with
36.52s: Peruvian bowl and we're going to look at
38.88s: GameStop together so there's actually a
40.40s: lot of GameStop content planned for this
42.44s: week because then we also still have
45.16s: getting through the rest of roaring
47.04s: Kitty trades I think this is part five
50.28s: of analyzing all of his old trades so we
54.36s: should hopefully wrap that up this
57.20s: weekend and continue moving through the
59.36s: the rest of the back story on this thing
61.44s: so I am eager to see where we go from
64.80s: here and then if there's anything that
65.76s: you want me to take a look at with
66.84s: Peruvian bull just let me know happy to
69.28s: integrate as much content from you guys
71.72s: as I possibly can so that we're talking
73.68s: about the stuff that you're most
74.96s: interested in that's the whole point so
77.32s: to level set us here taking a look at
79.96s: GameStop it's been as I already
82.08s: mentioned it's been really quiet and
83.68s: that's just kind of what it is I know
85.56s: it's easy well I know a lot of other
87.24s: people they really go the route of like
89.08s: trying to pump and you know give people
91.36s: a ton of Hope about everything and I'm
93.52s: honestly just much more um stoic than
96.00s: that and that's not that I don't have
97.64s: emotions it's just the fact that I kind
100.64s: of wait until I see things right that
102.88s: are moving now one thing you will notice
104.72s: is that I did zoom in to a 3-month daily
107.88s: why would I do that because I'm actually
109.68s: trying to get rid of these moves up here
112.64s: so that it fits a little bit better and
115.40s: I'm actually going to turn off the log
117.68s: scale for the time being
120.56s: and I want to just see what it's doing
122.72s: in the near term so we obviously had a
127.00s: bit of a dip after earnings then we've
129.20s: had this rally and we've just been
131.00s: rotating a little bit sideways now again
133.80s: we're falling below the point of control
137.32s: and I find this generally noteworthy
140.20s: mostly from the fact that volume is
142.92s: still very light and we're kind of
145.04s: falling like a feather as I see it right
147.20s: now meaning it's not like being sold off
150.12s: super heavy by people coming in and
152.00s: unloading shares but it's also not being
154.20s: supported by buyers it's mostly sale
157.52s: volume as it sits now 91% for today and
161.36s: I think that that's just something to
162.72s: keep in the back pocket now from a
164.32s: broader macro perspective to keep in
167.00s: mind GameStop and small caps in general
171.12s: have been struggling so if we take a
173.08s: quick look at iwm it's been kind of
176.44s: exhibiting similar Behavior now
178.08s: previously I was actually very excited
180.40s: because we saw GameStop starting to
182.52s: Rally a little bit when small caps were
184.64s: coming down that's cool to see because
186.60s: that's positive Divergence it shows me
189.04s: strength in something now that aside
193.24s: it's kind of been going the opposite way
195.56s: now where we're seeing iwm come continue
199.56s: to contract we got a little bit of a
201.08s: bite today but if I look at this
203.16s: compared to GameStop or I guess try to
205.92s: combine them into one ticker but if I
207.96s: look at this compared to GameStop we've
209.32s: had kind of these two down dayss here
210.96s: and it looks like that Divergence has
213.68s: slowed down a little bit so again
216.20s: generally noteworthy I think from a
218.84s: broader perspective understanding some
220.52s: of the sale pressure that might be
222.32s: coming in here but yeah the the last
224.80s: thing I have to continue to reiterate
226.60s: because I've had this conversation with
228.56s: a lot of different people about like oh
230.52s: you know this person is able to do
232.76s: really good technical analysis and
234.80s: that's really cool technical analysis is
236.60s: always going to be very unique to the
238.08s: individual it's kind of like a shoe that
240.12s: happens to fit really well the way you
241.64s: do it and stuff like that but again I'm
244.44s: more of a a data driven person so what
247.48s: I've done with something like GameStop
249.12s: is I've taken its entire lifespan of
252.00s: price action and I've analyzed all
254.60s: standard indicators uh in a few
257.12s: different formats but I've used all
259.64s: different oscillators primary
261.08s: oscillators so RSI macd stochastics that
264.00s: kind of stuff I've used moving averages
266.08s: volume profiles Fibonacci volume volume
269.52s: um volume averages volatility and
273.00s: volatility through ATR ADR imply
275.44s: volatility realize volatility that's
277.56s: kind of an overview of the broad buckets
279.36s: that I've looked at and I analyze the
280.92s: protective capability of these different
282.72s: tools I actually have a video that's
284.40s: coming out this Saturday that talks a
286.24s: little bit about the behavior of meme
288.56s: stocks in general and how they tend to
291.28s: move the what I'm trying to highlight is
294.56s: you can absolutely analyze something
296.36s: like GameStop but your standard
298.36s: technical analysis that most people use
300.60s: to analyze just price and volume it will
304.88s: work way differently in something like
307.24s: this standard technical analysis does
309.04s: not work well in GameStop and I'm saying
310.72s: that from a quantitative perspective I'm
312.48s: not saying that there isn't a way to use
314.00s: technical analysis to come up with ideas
315.44s: of course there is but again I
318.00s: differentiate the way that I look at
319.36s: these things because it's so easy to
321.60s: give yourself confirmation bias like oh
323.32s: yeah you know I I knew for sure it was
324.80s: going to do this and then you see it
326.36s: happen so then that artifact gets logged
329.40s: but then when we look at that same
331.36s: indicator over the last X period and it
334.60s: doesn't trigger we're not actually
335.92s: logging those failed signals the only
338.84s: reason why I'm highlighting this to you
340.44s: is because I found in my brief duration
344.04s: brief looking at GameStop this closely
346.36s: over the last 5 months or so that it
348.84s: tends to have very specific behavior
351.12s: that does not coincide with standard
353.88s: technical analysis indicators well at
356.32s: all so the reason why that is if you
359.36s: think about about the profit mechanism
361.48s: of something like GameStop we have a
363.12s: couple of them right one of them is the
365.24s: business hopefully is continuing to
367.80s: innovate and changing direction that's a
371.20s: long-term process right we're talking
373.60s: about years literally years for this
376.40s: pivot to happen and then GameStop to
379.28s: consume more and more market share as it
382.08s: expands its business lines maybe it gets
383.92s: into Collectibles maybe it gets into
385.64s: egaming I've heard people come up with
387.12s: all sorts of ideas that sound pretty
388.72s: cool that's one route long term
392.04s: shortterm are these really erratic price
394.64s: movements these erratic price movements
397.20s: sometimes squeezes either General short
400.20s: squeeze sometimes it's gamma squeezes
402.80s: sometimes it's other factors that kind
405.00s: of combine into something that causes
407.64s: these movements those have very specific
410.56s: traits and they behave differently
414.16s: compared to what normal technical
415.88s: analysis is designed to analyze which is
418.44s: price and volume movements right right
420.32s: because the reason being is these are
423.36s: structural constraints that cause these
425.88s: movements this isn't the accumulation of
428.84s: institutional investors who are now very
431.28s: eager to get in a GameStop and they're
433.00s: piling in hand over fist over the course
435.64s: of two days driving up price a multiple
438.48s: of six plus right that's not what's
440.64s: Happening Here What's Happening Here is
442.28s: we're having again some sort of short
444.20s: squeeze where people are being forced to
446.56s: liquidate unwind to cover risk that had
449.20s: that does not work with standard
451.84s: technical analysis so I just encourage
455.00s: people that look at this to try and
457.32s: think about what it exactly is that
459.20s: we're trying to look for and make sure
461.28s: that the indicators that we're doing
462.88s: align with that the last point I'll make
464.96s: on this is support and resistance right
468.92s: support and resistance tend to work
470.96s: generally well in normal periods so if I
473.68s: take a look at this 3-month period this
476.28s: looks like a very normal chart right
478.32s: we've had some pretty big mov but still
480.56s: we're falling within standard deviation
482.28s: channels which tracks size of moves 95%
485.28s: of data will be captured in here okay
487.12s: cool I'm seeing things that are having
489.60s: normal price rotation I'm seeing
492.32s: consolidation where we get multiple days
494.04s: in a row of these kinds of prices so on
495.92s: and so forth that's normal and GameStop
499.12s: exhibits normal Tendencies until it's
502.92s: not normal so here you might be looking
505.24s: at all this consolidation seeing all
506.88s: this stuff going on and the first thing
508.52s: that I noticed that kind of keys my
510.56s: interest is seeing a spike in volume in
513.48s: something like this I know spike in
516.08s: volume doesn't always mean something is
518.08s: going to happen but I do know before
520.40s: something has happened throughout its
521.84s: entire history it does have a spike in
523.96s: volume so now I look carefully and I'm
526.12s: thinking okay you know what does this
527.60s: potentially look like and you can draw
529.80s: all the support and resistance lines you
531.52s: want not one of them matters not one of
534.04s: them there's essentially no
535.80s: consolidation here on a relative basis
538.04s: given these kinds of Moves In this phase
540.76s: this defies standard price movement and
544.12s: therefore defies standard technical
546.36s: analysis you can't apply it here so I
548.56s: want to be very clear you can apply
551.16s: technical analysis here but you have to
553.36s: modify what you're looking at and what
556.16s: you're using because standard technical
559.00s: analysis does not work well in GameStop
561.36s: when it's going through its phases it
562.72s: can this is standard in here completely
564.40s: standard nothing offbeat about it but
567.12s: the interesting stuff about gain stop
568.64s: for the short term price movements via
570.80s: some sort of significant Peak those
573.40s: break all the standard rules so a little
576.12s: bit of an interesting conversation I was
577.68s: having with a few folks and somebody
579.44s: actually sent me an email asking about
581.20s: it so that essential part of this video
584.12s: is for Mike who was just curious about
586.84s: how a application of standard technical
589.36s: analysis works with something like
591.60s: GameStop and notice how I'm very
593.00s: particular I'm not saying technical
594.40s: analysis I'm saying standard technical
595.88s: analysis because we can still come up
597.76s: with Tendencies profiles things like
599.60s: that that use short squeezes which again
602.28s: that's a primary profit mechanism for
603.88s: stuff like this not limited to GameStop
606.08s: for the short-term movements and again
608.48s: the video on Saturday will go through
609.96s: that way more in detail so that you have
611.88s: a sense of how to look at this
613.72s: objectively for yourself okay so now
616.20s: let's take a look at the options really
617.76s: fast and it's because there's a few
619.80s: things that stuck out to me the first
622.04s: thing is we're still well over two times
624.64s: call to puts I find that interesting and
627.04s: I continue to find that interesting even
629.08s: with today however the part that is a
633.48s: little more concerning to me as I think
636.12s: about it is we can see that there's a
638.52s: lot of short calls being offered and
641.40s: that's people probably who have shares
643.08s: that are selling calls against them I
644.48s: sell calls against my shares when it's
646.40s: in periods like this because it's a way
648.00s: for me to make some more money while
650.12s: GameStop is moving sideways or rotating
652.44s: over that's exactly all there is to it
654.84s: and I know some people get upset about
656.28s: that which I always find funny because
658.08s: actually if I sell calls then that
659.92s: requires a market maker to buy shares to
663.08s: hedge the position as it gets close to
664.64s: expiration especially if my strike is in
666.36s: the money so really I I thought people
668.68s: would be happy about that but um I get
671.40s: it and I joke because a lot of people
672.80s: just don't want anything negative
674.24s: GameStop which I respect I understand
676.52s: but I'm a Trader it's what I do so I
679.00s: have my shares as I continue to
680.52s: reiterate but that's more of a
681.64s: participation thing than anything I'm
683.04s: not actively trying to trade those and
685.32s: then I trade options around it as it's
687.48s: moving but really the only option I have
689.64s: right now are short calls against the
690.84s: shares not covering them so I have
693.84s: uncapped profit potential and but I'm
697.04s: not trading directionally with options
698.56s: right now just because it's relatively
700.40s: quiet now the other thing I want to
702.76s: highlight is looking at the volatility
704.36s: surface we see a couple anomalies one of
707.48s: them is here in 17 j25 notice how high
711.32s: that volatility is relative to
713.04s: everything else that's around it so
714.80s: that's something I'll keep an eye on
716.16s: because those I do try to trade in here
717.96s: they tend to work really well for kind
719.84s: of a short-term relative value play for
722.60s: volatility but that's kind of playing it
724.76s: between a couple expirations maybe you
727.40s: know like a few weeks if that so it's a
730.52s: shorter term thing that's essentially
732.32s: trying to play the relative movement of
734.28s: this volatility compared to something
735.92s: else so for example you could do this
739.00s: and expecting this to expand this to
741.56s: contract stuff like that so that's that
745.36s: now the last thing I want to look at
747.48s: with you is actually just going through
749.36s: unusual whales really quick and I just
752.44s: want to pop into a few things
755.20s: specifically any interesting order
757.24s: volume that we've gotten and I mean
759.52s: cliffnotes is I I haven't really seen
761.24s: anything come through but I'll still
763.24s: take a look at it with you let's take a
765.00s: look at what is today the 2nd of October
768.68s: here so I mean we're like real real
772.20s: quiet in terms of larger volume right so
775.72s: we're even catching stuff that's
776.92s: hundreds of dollars so very very quiet
779.52s: today if we take a look at yesterday we
782.96s: had one come in at the um 17 Jan 25s
788.96s: what I'm noticing is these longer term
791.04s: options have been getting hit so much
794.00s: more than they tend to at least based on
797.08s: what I've seen because I also know that
798.44s: the 35s got hit out there so I want to
803.32s: highlight that just from a simple
805.36s: departure from the way that I've seen
807.92s: this typically move move where the
810.04s: overwhelming concentration of OI and
812.32s: volume has been in the front expirations
814.44s: that is genuinely not the case now it is
816.92s: a bit of a mixed bag so if we look
819.56s: across the different Series right now
821.56s: for o uh this coming Friday is you know
824.44s: 125k versus 25k 11 is 36 versus 13 18 is
829.48s: 269 versus 92 that is relatively new so
832.92s: what that tells me is things are just a
834.52s: little more quiet here that's really
836.68s: what this tells me and out at that 17
839.32s: expiration which we've seen hit a few
841.24s: times now is 180 over 96 so that means
844.40s: that we have actually several
845.80s: expirations that are higher than the
847.44s: front expiration which tends to just
849.80s: mean quiet but again the one thing we
852.04s: have to reiterate with something like
853.36s: GameStop is that it is quiet until it's
855.56s: not it happens fast so just because it's
858.44s: quiet today doesn't mean it's not quiet
860.80s: tomorrow you have to really stay on your
862.52s: toes I have again a series of different
865.24s: Nets that I use to track movements not
867.92s: just in GameStop but in anything for me
869.44s: to trade and anything like this they
872.40s: tend to move really fast so you have to
874.16s: be ready to Pivot quickly which kind of
876.08s: is what makes them fun so that's what
878.28s: I'm seeing in GameStop as always
879.64s: anything that you want to take a look at
880.80s: let me know anything we should look at
882.48s: in the live stream tomorrow with
883.92s: Peruvian bow let me know and then the
886.00s: same thing for the Saturday gme live
888.20s: stream we're typically focusing on
889.52s: Roaring Kitty old trades but anything
891.84s: else that we should dive into after that
893.68s: go super far into the weeds you know I'm
895.24s: here for it you need anything let me
896.88s: know be an outlier I'll see you later
