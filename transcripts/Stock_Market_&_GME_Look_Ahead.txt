0.68s: what's up outliers quick video outlining
3.24s: the week ahead what we have coming down
4.92s: the pike and this past week was a
8.92s: general massive rally across all the
11.64s: indices we saw in spy Q's iwm so I just
15.84s: want to talk really quick about
17.92s: essentially what this week looks like
20.44s: coming up and then I want to take a look
22.64s: at GameStop in the repositioning
24.88s: following the recent options expiration
27.32s: and just some general thoughts behind
28.84s: that so in my opinion you can tell when
32.36s: we look at spy Q's iwm is the only
35.56s: exception to this rule right now where
38.16s: both of these other indices are kind of
39.88s: starting to roll over a little bit not
42.16s: in terms of rolling down but in terms of
44.68s: consolidation these aren't the same
46.88s: parabolic up phases that you see here
49.48s: it's started in spy kind of starting to
51.48s: Trend sideways and it's been sideways
53.44s: again in qes for a little bit iwm caught
56.56s: a breath of fresh air when the um fomc
60.96s: committee and their J Pal's Retreat
64.56s: right now to Jackson Hole they're
65.76s: talking about essentially cutting rates
67.68s: so the markets RIT larged really like
70.20s: that volatility is down again yet again
74.48s: it essentially hit a high of last week
77.40s: we were up to 1806 and then it closed
79.92s: down at 1586 so V got pretty
82.52s: meaningfully suppressed by that so when
84.68s: I look at the week ahead in this context
86.96s: I'm looking for two things I'm looking
88.76s: for are we going to continue a
91.28s: consolidation phase which is likely what
93.80s: I would expect as of right now maybe a
95.72s: little bit of breath of fresh air come a
98.20s: little bit later in the week but when I
99.48s: look at the Futures right now e- minis
101.28s: are down Russell is up ever so slightly
103.68s: and the NASDAQ is down so all that tells
106.96s: me is that I'm not sure that this is
108.48s: parabolic up still probably a little bit
111.00s: of sideways activity coming our way now
114.48s: a quick look at GameStop specifically
117.60s: let's grab that and
120.68s: the week ahead for me probably will be
124.00s: quiet that's what I'm assuming unless
125.84s: there's some sort of really significant
127.88s: Catalyst that enters the picture as I
130.88s: look at GameStop right now we just came
133.72s: through another options expiration and
136.96s: there wasn't a lot of density now we're
139.72s: coming up on yet another weekly options
143.32s: expiration that is also not dense at all
146.40s: this front expiration only has 70,000
148.40s: calls against 19,000 puts again for a
151.88s: product like GameStop that's very very
153.44s: light and you can tell because when I
155.36s: look at the open interest here typically
158.12s: you'll see a lot of right now purple is
160.36s: the front expiration and normally I
163.12s: would see a lot of purple but I don't I
165.88s: actually see a lot of green which is 18
169.16s: o 24 and then I see some gray which is
173.00s: 17 Jan 25 then I see some of this orange
176.08s: which is 16 Jan 26 all I'm highlighting
178.12s: is a mix of expiration Cycles in the
182.32s: open interest now I'm still very eager
186.64s: to see how we do in earnings and there's
189.52s: two things I'm really curious about here
191.92s: the first one is do we finally get a
195.68s: little bit of context and information
198.48s: regarding what we're doing with the
200.52s: money from the at the money offering I
203.56s: think that's highly pertinent at this
206.00s: point we know we know GameStop is
208.28s: sitting on a fat bed of cash which is
211.44s: awesome we need to use the cash to grow
214.40s: the business to do things cash by itself
217.48s: is good but we need it to feed the
219.72s: business which as of right now again
222.56s: some of you might be a little more
223.72s: plugged into it than I am but I've been
225.40s: reading as much as I can from Gamestop
227.40s: directly and I'm just not seeing a lot
229.56s: so I'm really hopeful that during this
232.52s: earnings release coming up because from
234.52s: my understanding GameStop doesn't tend
236.08s: to do calls they tend to just do the
237.72s: release itself but I'm hopeful that
239.84s: maybe they'll um have some statements
242.56s: associated with it about what we're
245.36s: looking at here and I think a lot of
247.04s: investors are starting to ask that same
248.92s: question and again rightfully so because
250.76s: if we go through an at the money which
252.76s: again you know does technically delute
254.84s: but how much it dutes and stuff like
256.16s: that I I don't want to get into the
257.56s: weeds there but the at the money I think
261.00s: made sense given what it provides
263.24s: GameStop the ability to do but from a
265.44s: leadership perspective now I'm very
267.04s: curious what they are going to do and I
270.00s: just haven't gotten a bunch of
271.96s: information on that yet so that's the
274.20s: first thing I'm really eager to
276.56s: experience through earnings which is
278.08s: again right now supposed to be on the
280.00s: 4th before the market of September now
282.36s: the second thing is I still think this
285.00s: volatility needs to come up it's already
286.76s: come up a little bit it's now at
288.96s: 78% but it still is utterly shocking to
293.12s: me that the expiration cycle that
295.60s: includes earnings here is at 78 1.5% and
299.88s: then the following expiration cycle
301.72s: which is ALS this is nothing this is
303.52s: just another weekly expiration cycle is
306.48s: all the way up at 95 that's also very
309.56s: interesting to me there's part of me
311.64s: that thinks maybe they think that the
313.64s: earnings release might shift out again I
317.04s: that is pure tin foil because I have no
319.00s: idea why that would happen other than
321.56s: the fact that I just see a lot of
323.20s: volatility in another weekly expiration
325.68s: without something I can I positively
327.84s: identify why it would be the case
329.88s: typically if I was looking at an options
332.04s: chain and I see this kind of Vault here
334.20s: my assumption is actually that earnings
336.08s: would be here not here so have to see
340.08s: where we go from there but as always I'm
342.88s: really stoked for the week ahead there's
344.32s: a lot a lot of opportunity out there in
346.40s: the market right now and I'm going keep
348.56s: looking at GameStop as you know for
350.36s: everybody that's interested the live
353.08s: stream sessions for this week will be
355.56s: posted on the YouTube Community page so
358.16s: you can see what's coming up but it's a
359.64s: essentially every day at 5:00 p.m.
360.72s: Pacific time we got something be an
362.40s: outlier I'll see you guys later
