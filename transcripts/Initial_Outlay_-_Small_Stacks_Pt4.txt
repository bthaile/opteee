0.72s: hey everyone eric here with a fresh
2.16s: haircut finally
3.60s: i hate having long hair so it was time
5.60s: to get it chopped off
8.00s: we have a uh update for small stacks
10.80s: let's jump over the screen and take a
12.24s: look at what we have going on so
14.96s: essentially i structured my initial
17.36s: outlay
18.08s: so what i have is so i have a short put
22.40s: in xlf expiring to october
25.52s: i collected 50 bucks for that and it's
28.64s: 2400 to cash secure the position which
31.44s: as you know i'm cash securing these
32.96s: positions
34.48s: and then i also have a short put in
37.04s: zynga
38.32s: at uh 8 50 so that's collecting 27.85
44.32s: to cash secure and then what you see at
46.88s: the bottom
47.84s: is a trade that i have not put on yet
50.24s: but i'm expecting to
51.68s: and this is a leap diagonal in ford
55.12s: now in general i'm not a huge fan of
58.32s: ford
58.88s: but the diagonal itself is very
62.00s: appealing to me
62.96s: and i do like the exposure at this level
67.04s: this is what i talk about all the time
69.36s: in terms of just
70.48s: shortfalls of smaller accounts you're
72.40s: forced into certain
73.68s: you know positions and products that i
77.28s: typically wouldn't trade like i wouldn't
78.88s: bother with ford i would trade something
80.88s: like gm
81.76s: or i don't know something that i feel a
84.08s: little more comfortable with
85.76s: in terms of it's standing in the market
89.12s: but
90.32s: i do think that ford is still a strong
92.32s: company i think that
94.08s: they have plenty of support especially
97.52s: for their trucks
98.72s: and their sports cars you know and
100.80s: they've been really reducing their
102.80s: additional
103.52s: offerings to focus on those because
105.44s: that's what's selling
106.96s: so that is a perspective leap diagonal
109.92s: i'm gonna put on
110.96s: and in that scenario i will
114.40s: sell at a one-to-one ratio as compared
117.60s: to
118.64s: at at ratio which i typically do and the
121.60s: reason being is i just don't see ford
123.84s: making some sort of huge re you know
126.16s: huge rebounder skyrocketing from here
128.40s: especially in the current environment
130.40s: so with that in mind is why i
133.68s: am gonna sell at a one-to-one ratio so
136.88s: that this way
137.84s: you know i'll collect a little bit more
139.20s: money up front i'll cap my upside but
141.60s: again being very mindful of my delta
143.60s: selection i will not have
145.44s: upside risk so what i'm thinking for
149.92s: the portfolio for the time being is it
152.96s: will look very much like this
154.80s: where i'll be having you know these
156.40s: sorts of trades
158.08s: without the leap diagonal included i
160.72s: have
161.12s: 77 of credit out i have
164.24s: 32.50 to cash secure everything which is
167.04s: a percent and a half return on capital
168.96s: both of these positions
170.00s: are you know 31 and 38 days so
173.04s: not that far out in time so overall i'm
176.00s: very
176.56s: comfortable with the positions i have on
180.08s: and the overall risk i have out now two
183.12s: things to note the first one
185.12s: is as always if my short put starts
188.88s: getting
189.60s: um challenged there is a good chance i
192.64s: will
193.04s: roll and the reason being is
196.64s: since it is a margin account i will have
199.60s: more flexibility
200.88s: if i need it to manage the positions
203.20s: especially
204.56s: um in something like zynga
207.92s: i will absolutely manage that position
210.96s: now i will make sure i
214.32s: take a look at what the covered call is
216.72s: offering
217.68s: but in a smaller account one of my
219.84s: objectives
220.72s: is going to be to get assigned at the
223.12s: lowest
224.32s: possible cost so as long as i can roll
227.60s: for a credit and continue to reduce my
229.84s: basis
230.88s: that will be my priority then if i find
233.76s: myself in a scenario where
235.28s: i can no longer reduce my basis by
237.76s: rolling
238.72s: what i will do is see how much credit i
241.68s: can get
242.40s: if i continue to roll just out and i
245.52s: will compare that to what i could
247.20s: produce in a covered call
249.12s: and that will be my essentially
251.84s: comparison to see which way i want to go
253.68s: at that point
254.72s: well right now especially in a small
256.48s: account basis reduction
258.64s: is a very significant priority of mine
262.00s: because we're dealing with very little
264.08s: capital and with something like
265.76s: xlf it's already essentially taking up
267.60s: half the portfolio
269.12s: i'm comfortable putting that there
270.72s: simply because it's a
272.32s: it's a sector etf so it has inherent
275.92s: diversification in it
278.08s: and i do think that financials are at a
279.92s: decent level now
281.28s: i will look to add a position in xle in
284.24s: the coming
285.28s: weeks is um as time goes on
288.64s: now unlike my typical approach more
292.00s: likely than not
293.04s: again not a hard and fast rule for me
295.28s: but more likely than not
296.80s: i will leave these positions on until i
298.64s: can take them down for very very cheap
300.40s: maybe a penny or two
302.32s: and the reason for that is i need to
304.64s: squeeze
305.36s: as much as i can out of these trades in
307.68s: order to put some money in the account
310.08s: as you can tell again when we're
313.52s: looking at percentages and gross numbers
316.96s: it's important to look at both in
318.48s: context because one and a half percent
320.24s: return on capital in about
321.84s: a month is a that's a great return
323.68s: there's nothing wrong with that
325.28s: but in such a small account that's 77
328.32s: which as a gross number amount it's
330.24s: pretty damn low
331.68s: but the fact of the matter is again this
334.00s: is where compounding returns
336.32s: becomes our friend because if these
339.04s: trades work out well
341.04s: then my new principal isn't going to be
343.12s: you know 5000 it's going to be 5077. and
346.40s: we'll just get the ball rolling nice and
348.40s: slow like that
350.40s: which is what i've been talking about
352.24s: pretty much this whole time my goal
354.00s: is to not take this trade or not take
356.56s: this account and just knock it out of
357.92s: the park try to triple it
359.20s: i do not care to do that i'm trading
361.76s: this account as if i were starting again
363.76s: knowing what i know now
365.28s: and what that includes is a very
367.04s: calculated and slow approach
369.60s: that is focused on a good foundation
372.88s: that if things go against me i don't
375.28s: have to close things for a loss i can
377.04s: simply hold
377.84s: positions in weight i think that that's
380.16s: one of the biggest issues a lot of small
382.00s: accounts do is they trade very actively
384.56s: and they they put themselves in these
386.32s: scenarios where they have to take all
387.84s: sorts of losses
389.44s: and small accounts simply cannot handle
392.00s: a lot of those
393.36s: losses so my goal in this account is to
396.56s: reduce those
397.84s: now last note is as i was talking about
400.80s: before my typical goal for
402.64s: stuff like this is to stay as much
404.96s: within the s p 500 as i can because i
406.96s: think that helps reduce
408.00s: some inherent risk s p 500 are typically
410.56s: you know good performing products
412.64s: however i did see an opportunity in
414.88s: zynga and that's why i took it i think
416.88s: zynga in general is a good company
419.36s: i think that they have a good market
421.12s: that they're still performing well in so
423.20s: that's why i was willing to venture
424.72s: outside of the s p 500
427.12s: again it's one of the constraints of a
428.80s: small account i wouldn't have done this
430.48s: in my
430.96s: regular account because i don't need to
432.96s: but in a small account finding something
434.80s: that was giving me
435.68s: 3.2 return on invested capital for 38
438.80s: days
439.68s: on something like zynga that i think has
441.52s: potential is
442.88s: a good trade for me so that's why i made
445.12s: it so i will keep you all up to speed
448.16s: on the leap diagonal there's
451.52s: a good chance it will either be in ford
454.08s: or xle i will look at both
456.24s: and compare them against one another but
459.28s: the big thing
460.16s: is i want to as you can tell i'm being
462.16s: very purposeful
463.60s: about my correlation i have financials
466.00s: now i have zynga which is tech
468.16s: then i'm looking at either consumer
470.16s: discretionary aka automotives or
472.48s: energy i am purposely starting to touch
475.92s: different places in the market so that
478.24s: i'm not too concentrated in one area
481.20s: again taking that long-term view of
483.76s: developing this portfolio
485.76s: so we'll see what leap diagonal goes on
488.72s: i do have the capital left over for it
491.20s: i still have you know 1700 or so so i
494.40s: intend to use it
495.92s: and i will maintain close to 100
498.96s: allocation in the account because it's
500.88s: the only way i see
502.80s: to put some money into the account is to
505.28s: take outsized risk and i'm comfortable
507.12s: with it because most of the positions
508.96s: are set up whereas
510.08s: if they go against me i can just wait i
512.56s: hold out
513.52s: for essentially as long as i need to
516.64s: in order for the products to recover
518.72s: reassessing consistently
520.00s: to make sure i don't need to close
521.36s: because there's been a significant
522.80s: change in circumstance
524.64s: but you know foregoing that potential
528.16s: i do i do think that the account can
532.48s: weather most storms if i'm patient
535.68s: so if anybody's any questions or
537.36s: anything else that they want to see me
538.40s: dig into is always let me know
540.24s: and i will catch everybody later
