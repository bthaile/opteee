0.00s: What is going on everybody I am here with my good friend best friend ever gave welcome back.
10.76s: I think this is what the third time or yeah, I think this is the third time.
14.00s: Yeah.
15.00s: Yeah.
16.00s: Well, we're going to have to set up like your own playlist soon.
19.00s: First off, you know, thanks for thanks for joining me again.
22.28s: I always look forward to talking with you because you are truly one of the few people that
28.40s: are very vocal for retail traders and you are obviously incredibly savvy about just the financial
36.80s: markets in general, their structure, which I think would benefit a lot more retail traders.
42.24s: If they you don't have to become an expert, but as long as you start to understand a little
45.40s: bit more, the pieces start to fall in place a little bit better and you kind of know how
49.60s: to more effectively interact with the markets.
51.80s: So thank you again for coming to hang out and spend some time.
54.56s: Sure.
55.56s: Yeah.
56.56s: Thanks for having me.
58.32s: You know, look forward to talking about markets and it's just great that people are interested
62.88s: in it.
63.88s: And so you don't always have to talk about it.
66.56s: Just it is such a funny point because like a lot of my friends that I talked to you,
70.20s: I try to talk to about trading, they couldn't care less.
72.80s: Yeah.
73.80s: And then, you know, like you start, I was talking with somebody on the internet about
78.80s: volatility smiles and they were geeking out on it as hard as I was and I was just like,
84.00s: how cool is this that you could just find somebody that's interested in this super niche
88.20s: thing that nobody you know cares about, but you know, this person across the country likes
93.08s: it.
94.08s: I love that.
95.08s: I know.
96.08s: I know.
97.08s: I mean, that's it's the same thing with market structure, you know, and for a long time,
99.48s: again, like nobody in this world cared about it.
101.88s: And there were like 10 people on Wall Street that were obsessed with it.
105.32s: We all know each other and we all even, you know, have us disagree with the other half,
109.96s: you know, that they're always arguing and debating and it's always super fascinating,
114.40s: but you know, it is, it's funny.
115.68s: It's like this thing that just nobody would ever think to care about.
119.80s: And yet it's so important to the economy and to everything, same with trading, right?
125.40s: You know, I think people underestimate the importance of even the speculation, which
129.76s: helps to, you know, bring prices in line.
132.16s: And if you buy any version of the efficient market hypothesis, you know, speculators are
136.20s: important and as part of that.
138.96s: Right.
139.96s: Yeah.
140.96s: And so that's actually like a really good starting point because the last couple of times
145.24s: you were talking, there was this, you know, we are the investors and it, you know, is
150.52s: a started as it looked like a hashtag on Twitter.
153.36s: I don't know if the petition came before that and it was part of it.
156.08s: Maybe you could tell me a little bit about like the timing of it, but more importantly,
160.20s: you kind of started this movement that is definitely interested in, you know, retail
166.48s: traders place in the market and some of the structural components of the markets that,
173.60s: in a lot of ways, they're kind of sold to retail traders like good things.
177.92s: But then when you start understanding it a little bit more, it's kind of like, is this
181.48s: a good thing?
182.48s: So, yeah.
183.48s: Well, you know, it, it originally came about, you know, as I've gotten more immersed in
189.32s: the retail investor and trader community, which is more recent for me.
193.92s: You know, I've sort of been in the professional trading community for a long time, but, you
198.48s: know, the retail trading community is new to me for the last, you know, year and change.
203.52s: It's a wild west.
205.52s: We just, we just, we just, we need a fascinating space.
210.92s: But, you know, I was used to encountering firms like Citadel and Virtu and Robinhood,
221.76s: TD Ameritrade in, in the market structured debates that were happening, both in Congress
228.48s: and at the SEC and the, I was used to encountering them, holding themselves up as representing
235.92s: retail.
236.92s: Right.
237.92s: And the absurdity of that was, it was never really lost on anyone, but there was no
244.00s: one to really question it.
246.28s: And there was really no one else who could step in to represent retail.
250.68s: And so the reason it's absurd is because these are companies who profit from retail, who
255.84s: productize retail, right?
258.36s: You get free commissions.
259.84s: I mean, nothing's for free.
261.24s: We all know that, right?
262.24s: Especially on Wall Street, but, you know, even on social media, nothing's for free.
266.60s: If you're not paying for something, you're the product.
269.08s: And since when does the firm that has productized you get to represent your interests and who
275.32s: in the right minds would think that they're representing your interests as opposed to their
279.44s: interests?
280.44s: So that was really where this all began was to say, wait a second, you know, if retail
287.44s: can get educated on these issues and has been educating itself on these issues, you know,
295.08s: everyone cares now about market structure and they're fascinated by it.
298.48s: Which is the only reason, like, I have this Twitter following and, you know, Reddit
303.80s: communities that care to interact and they want to learn more.
307.12s: And, you know, if they can learn enough, then retail should be able to represent itself.
312.40s: And retail should be able to represent its interests and understand the trade-offs that
317.92s: it's being presented with in the current structure and decide for itself is a better one possible.
325.32s: And would there be a better structure that could better advantage retail investors over
330.48s: this extreme system of extreme intermediation and middlemen that has cropped up around retail,
338.32s: right?
339.32s: It's like, you know, if retail or the schools of fish, you have all these sharks coming in,
343.84s: profiting from it.
345.72s: And it's just, it's an unnecessary sort of middle layer in the market.
351.52s: And, you know, so a big part of what we're pushing for with we, the investors, is getting
354.96s: rid of that middle layer.
356.76s: Are you getting rid of all this intermediation and letting retail access markets directly
362.12s: and letting retail interact with institutions directly?
366.00s: Which, so, talk to me a little bit more about that, the, you know, getting rid of the
371.20s: intermediary.
372.20s: Can you share a little bit more on like the primary entities or functions that those entities
378.96s: provide now and why you think they shouldn't be there and that retail should be able to go
384.72s: kind of via far direct past them?
386.40s: Yeah.
387.40s: So today, when you enter an order in as a retail investor or retail trader, nearly universally,
394.84s: that order is going to go to what's called a wholesale it.
398.20s: So you use TD Ameritrade or Schwab or E-trade or Robin Hood, even to a certain extent interactive
406.44s: brokers, but not quite the same, you know, but all of these, all of the biggest brokers
413.36s: in the world sell their order flow or even if they don't sell it like fidelity, doesn't
419.12s: sell equity order flow, they do sell options order flow, but they still send it all of those
423.84s: orders to mostly Citadel and Vertu.
427.48s: So those are called wholesalers.
429.28s: And so that order, you know, marketable orders go to these wholesalers and they internalize
435.04s: it.
436.04s: They fill those orders, they send the fill back.
438.24s: And what your broker will tell you is, well, look, they're paying for that order flow.
443.00s: So that's why we can offer you zero commissions and you're getting all this great price improvement.
448.20s: You're getting a better fill than the MBBO.
450.16s: You should be on your knees thanking us, not getting upset at this great price improvement
456.36s: and free training.
457.56s: You know, what could be better?
459.68s: And of course, you know, like I said, nothing's free in this world.
464.08s: So you know, first of all, there's a good amount of academic evidence that shows that if
468.24s: your order is being handled by a broker that accepts payment for order flow, you're
471.84s: going to get a worse price than if your order is being handled by a broker that doesn't.
475.92s: So, you know, like flat off, that's hardly even a controversial statement at this point.
482.76s: So that part, first of all, that means that your broker is not getting best execution, right?
487.84s: The broker has a duty of best execution above and beyond its interest in accepting payment
493.00s: for order flow.
494.08s: And brokers are not meeting that duty.
496.52s: And so that's a big problem in markets today.
499.48s: And you don't know how much it's costing you because you're not seeing it.
505.04s: It's all sort of baked into the execution price.
508.08s: Now the other side of this is this great price improvement that they talk so much about.
513.36s: But price improvement is bullshit.
517.32s: That's the nicest way I can put it because it's completely theoretical.
522.32s: It's not actually a real thing.
525.16s: Okay.
526.16s: So, the best improvement is them saying we gave you a better price than the MBBO.
530.12s: But does that mean they give you a better price than the hidden orders that were out there
533.72s: or the midpoint orders that were out there that they didn't even bother to look for?
537.56s: No, it doesn't mean that.
538.92s: Did they give you a better price than the odd lots out there which don't count in the
542.54s: MBBO?
543.54s: No, they didn't do that.
545.12s: And so much of retail trading today is in odd lots and so much liquidity out there is in
550.68s: odd lots because of these high priced names.
553.64s: So, and then finally, it's bullshit because when they take all of this order flow and
562.04s: they gobble it up into these two big companies, they are damaging the market.
568.12s: So, it actually widens spreads for the entire market.
573.56s: The best estimate I've seen of the impact of that is that it widens spreads by 25% or
580.46s: more.
581.54s: That's a huge multi-billion dollar cost to the economy and to the industry.
587.70s: And nobody's even talking about that.
590.30s: And so, that's like saying, you know, okay, I'm going to raise my price by 25% and then
598.14s: oh, you look nice.
599.14s: I'm going to give you 10% off that price.
601.34s: Aren't I so nice?
602.34s: Right there is your price improvement.
604.02s: That's what, you know, so it's all bullshit.
606.50s: And so the entire sort of ecosystem that has cropped up around the discount brokers
613.10s: and wholesalers is a really corrupt one.
616.10s: And it's one in which brokers are not getting best execution.
619.70s: And it's one in which the markets are being damaged by its very existence.
623.82s: And so that's what we're pushing to get rid of and to get those retail orders either
629.06s: on to the exchange where hundreds of people can compete for them or into some kind of
636.10s: transparent venue that allows for open competition for order flow.
639.46s: So that's it.
640.78s: The most important part of all this is today, it's essentially a duopoly.
645.02s: It's an anti-competitive system.
647.50s: And I just believe in competition.
649.54s: You know, I'm funny that way.
651.30s: I'm a capitalist, you know, I believe in open competition and that leads to optimal outcomes.
656.30s: And so that's why we believe that we should get rid of the middlemen and let everyone
659.86s: compete over these orders.
662.14s: So just for the people that might not be familiar with what that could look like.
669.78s: So let's say best case scenario is granted and, you know, the petition that you guys are
676.42s: working on is accepted and they, you know, take on board all of the suggestions.
682.34s: What would the markets look like on the back end of that?
686.22s: I think the markets would look a lot simpler.
689.22s: That's the most important thing that I believe in is today markets are very complex.
695.06s: You have 16 stock exchanges, 40 dark pools and ATSs.
699.02s: You've got things that are called SDP, single dealer platforms being run in an almost
704.74s: unregulated way.
706.06s: You know, it would get rid of a lot of that.
709.82s: And it would really simplify things.
711.50s: And I think that if we can get closer to a market that is not as fragmented and gives
718.54s: everyone an opportunity to find each other in a more efficient way, that would be a better
723.82s: outcome.
725.42s: And we hear a lot that the US has the deepest, most liquid markets in the world.
730.54s: It's not even close to true.
732.18s: That's like a political slogan or something.
734.66s: I just a very US thing to say.
736.38s: You know, we just messed everything.
738.62s: Right.
739.62s: Exactly.
740.62s: It's just quantitatively not true.
743.62s: You can look at many other markets that have better liquidity and lower execution costs
750.06s: when you adjust for things like company size.
752.94s: You know, yeah, the US has the biggest companies, but not the best markets.
757.78s: And they always say, well, retail has never had it better.
761.62s: And even that, I'm not even convinced that's true.
764.98s: But even if it is, it doesn't mean that we've arrived at a good outcome.
770.74s: We retail could have way better institutions could have it way better.
775.50s: And that should matter to every retail investor because, you know, the majority of the wealth
781.54s: of the United States and many other countries is concentrated in pension plans and mutual
787.14s: funds and ETFs.
789.30s: And that is the institutional money that we should want to be able to execute as efficiently
796.22s: or more efficiently than the retail speculator.
799.78s: And so, you know, I think that when I think of what a better market structure would look
804.02s: like, it's a simpler one in which retail and institutions can hit each other directly
810.06s: without all of this unnecessary intermediation.
813.66s: Now would you still advocate for dark pools?
817.74s: Would they still exist in this world or would you completely want to get rid of them?
821.54s: And if so, where do you block orders go?
824.38s: Oh, yeah.
825.38s: I believe the dark pools should exist.
827.42s: I think they have, you know, an important function in markets.
831.02s: I think it's important to understand and a lot of people tend to confuse the point that
836.06s: retail orders pretty much never go into a dark pool.
839.78s: Dark pools are for institutions.
840.78s: But like you said, have big blocks and they want to see if they can find a counterparty
846.98s: to that trade without hitting the exchange and without impacting the price significantly.
852.74s: I think, again, there should be far fewer dark pools.
856.62s: But dark pools are a place for innovation and for, you know, creativity.
862.86s: And I think that that's a good thing.
865.22s: I just think it should be harder to create one if you have a conflict of interest.
874.02s: And so today, a lot of dark pools are operated by institutional brokers.
879.18s: And they are routing the orders of asset managers and operating dark pool.
885.18s: And that's a huge conflict of interest because they are incentivized to preference that dark
889.96s: pool over other potential better sources of execution quality because it's a way for them
894.82s: to save money.
896.10s: So anytime there's a conflict like that, I think it's really important for us to identify
901.30s: the conflict and make sure that it's the kind of thing that we get rid of.
906.22s: You know, I prefer to get rid of conflicts versus disclose them away.
911.50s: And that's, you know, the regulatory instinct is to focus on disclosure.
917.06s: And I think disclosure can be important.
919.86s: But, you know, disclosure does not fix conflicts of interest.
924.50s: And it's a big problem when you think you can fix it with just with disclosure.
930.34s: Right.
931.34s: Which leads me to like a genuine personal question that I've had is, why don't dark pools?
938.02s: Why isn't there more cannibalization among them?
940.86s: I was always curious why there's so many that are able to operate against one another.
945.66s: How does that work?
947.46s: Yeah, I think it's a huge problem for markets.
950.42s: I think fragmentation is a huge problem for markets.
954.06s: And the fact that you have all of these dark pools and they don't seem to go away,
959.66s: it again, a big part of it is because they don't really need to make money.
965.66s: You know, that when they're operated by a broker, the point is that it's saving
970.50s: the broker a lot of money any time it finds a fill in its own dark pool.
974.90s: Right.
975.90s: And so that, you know, they'll just operate because it's a cost avoidance mechanism.
981.26s: And that's the problem.
982.26s: So you get a ton of them and it's like, you know, you have these big blocks and their
986.10s: ships passing each other in the night.
987.90s: They can't find each other because one is in the UBS dark pool and one's in the Goldman
991.74s: dark pool and another one might be over in Credit Suisse and, you know, Narrow the
995.42s: Twain Shell Meat.
996.42s: And so it's a big problem.
998.10s: Got it.
999.10s: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
1000.66s: I hadn't really thought of it that way.
1002.26s: Yeah, I was, because I like to follow dark pool flow.
1006.22s: It's more just out of curiosity.
1007.38s: I just think it's interesting.
1008.54s: But I was always wondering why there are so many of them able to exist simultaneously.
1013.10s: It seemed strange to me.
1014.82s: But yeah.
1015.82s: It's, and it's, it's symptomatic of something, which is that, you know, the entire sort
1022.18s: of ATS structure is not really set up for regulators to say no to things.
1028.38s: So I think that's part of the problem, but it's the same thing is true in the exchange
1032.98s: space.
1033.98s: You know, we have 16 stock exchanges.
1035.98s: Why?
1036.98s: Why do we need 16 stock exchanges?
1040.26s: And they don't compete over nothing but fee structure.
1044.42s: And they're all subsidized by the public.
1046.86s: Right?
1047.86s: So hundreds of millions of dollars every year goes from public, the public into the stock
1053.98s: exchanges.
1055.26s: And these are for profit publicly traded companies.
1058.54s: And they're getting a hundred million dollars a year each, the three major exchange families,
1062.54s: Naising, Nasdaq and CBOE.
1064.74s: And all because they are the ones in charge of setting the fees of the securities information
1070.46s: process or the public market data feed.
1072.86s: So they set the fees very high because it brings in a huge subsidy to them.
1076.58s: It makes it so unprofitable exchanges can be operated because that's what subsidization
1082.86s: does.
1083.86s: And that allows inefficiency to thrive.
1087.34s: And it's a crazy outcome.
1089.70s: And it's a problem, it's a real problem for U.S. markets.
1092.46s: And so, you know, part of what the change that I'd like to see from regulators is them
1097.38s: to start saying no to its changes.
1099.06s: I'd like them to get rid of the SIP subsidy or at least dramatically reduce it.
1104.42s: It's just supposed to be the cost of operating the SIP, not this massive hundred million
1108.30s: dollar a year subsidy that goes to each exchange family.
1112.02s: And I'd like to see far fewer stock exchanges who can innovate and compete on real features
1117.78s: and execution quality rather than, you know, who can give the biggest rebate to which firm.
1123.30s: So aligning two different kind of contrasting concepts when we're talking about payment
1131.86s: for order flow, there's a bit of a do-oply there.
1134.50s: And then when we're talking about the exchanges, there's fragmentation.
1138.26s: So what's the middle ground?
1140.14s: What should there be for?
1141.94s: Should there be two?
1143.06s: Should there be five?
1144.18s: What do you think the right number of exchanges is to find that balance?
1148.10s: I think there should be like three exchanges and three dark bulls.
1152.10s: But, you know, I don't think we should live in a world in which someone picks a number
1159.42s: and says, this is it, right?
1161.98s: Like, you know, the Fed does.
1164.98s: I kind of believe in markets, but again, I think that both structures, the extremely
1173.66s: concentrated, you know, wholesaling and payment for order flow system and the extremely fragmented
1179.26s: exchange system, they both have something in common, which is, you know, there's sort
1184.62s: of the consequence of regulation.
1187.22s: And so, you know, often what I will get accused of is wanting way more regulation.
1193.86s: And it's just, it's not the case at all.
1195.58s: I want better regulation, but, you know, I want to peel back regulations, right?
1201.22s: Like, the, the, the, the do-oply that exists in the payment for order flow and wholesaling
1206.46s: world only exists because of regulation.
1210.18s: We should get rid of that.
1211.70s: We should say that, you know, trades should take place on exchange.
1216.02s: That should be sort of the guiding light in U.S. markets as it is in many other markets.
1220.90s: You know, that's, that's a principles-based approach.
1224.06s: Trade should take place on exchange.
1226.26s: There might be exceptions to that rule like for block trades, but generally speaking,
1230.66s: trades should take place on exchange, right?
1233.18s: And on exchange, they, that's where you can get competition, open competition.
1238.06s: And then the other side of it is we should not subsidize inefficient companies, right?
1242.98s: A subsidy from the public of hundreds of millions of dollars a year that results in, you know,
1248.66s: just crazy fragmented exchange, you know, set of exchanges is the other, it's a different
1254.18s: problem.
1255.18s: And so, again, you get rid of that kind of subsidization and then you let market forces,
1262.34s: you know, find the optimal outcome.
1265.10s: I love that part.
1266.10s: That's such a great, a great sentence to end on allowing market forces to find that, because
1272.30s: that's really what I believe in to add my completely unsolicited opinion is.
1278.70s: I think that that's just a really effective way to go about it.
1282.22s: If the backend structure is there, it seems like that medium would be found.
1288.22s: So another related topic that's in the petition, which I will absolutely make
1295.22s: sure I throw in the link in the video description so that people can go check that out.
1301.30s: Right now it looks like there's 71,118 people that have signed out of 75,000 and there's
1309.14s: 20, what, 32 hours left to go.
1312.38s: There's a day and eight hours, something like that.
1314.38s: Yeah.
1315.38s: So, there's still a little time for people to get involved.
1318.18s: I'll make sure I get this video.
1319.18s: I'll probably try to dump it out later today so that today's the 23rd, just so that people
1323.90s: have time to synthesize and hopefully check this out.
1327.34s: Another interesting thing that you call out in the petition is kind of this concept of price
1336.10s: discovery.
1337.74s: So I wanted to hone in on that specifically because I think that price discovery is one of
1343.58s: those things that people, I mean a lot of this is things that people don't think about.
1348.10s: But I view price discovery as even like a further subset of that.
1352.58s: And I think it has an outsized impact for the level of attention it gets.
1357.54s: So I would love to get your take on why you get specifically called price discovery out
1365.26s: in here and kind of the status quo as it is right now for price discovery.
1370.42s: Yeah.
1371.42s: So markets exist for two reasons and it's very easy to lose sight of this.
1377.62s: We like to trade.
1378.62s: We like to, you know, they can feel like casinos often.
1381.90s: You can say gamble.
1382.90s: That's for a lot of people who do.
1384.22s: You know, there's no way around it, right?
1386.34s: And, you know, I believe me, I've been on Wall Street long enough that it attracts gamblers,
1390.78s: right?
1391.78s: It's the gambling leverage and it can be fun, right?
1394.62s: And especially when you hit one.
1397.42s: But markets do not exist to facilitate gambling and casino like behavior.
1402.42s: There's a few reasons.
1404.86s: Capital formation price discovery, right?
1408.14s: And good companies and figure out what those companies are worth over time as the world
1414.12s: changes and as those companies change.
1416.98s: And so capital formation happens generally in the primary market.
1420.66s: That's when you go public.
1422.30s: You raise a ton of money and you list your company publicly.
1426.42s: And then your shares are floating in the public.
1429.94s: They are being traded and the price should reflect supply and demand.
1434.90s: It's that sort of, you know, random walk over time that is what determines what the company
1440.50s: is worth on the secondary market and helps companies to raise money down the line.
1447.10s: You know, issue secondary offerings, issue compensation to their employees, reward, you
1451.58s: know, have their employee, early employees rewarded as that grows over time.
1455.14s: All sorts of things are sort of tied up in this price discovery process that is what
1460.34s: is this thing worth.
1462.62s: And the most important part of the price discovery process is that the NBBO, the national
1469.34s: best bid and offer in the market, reflects the supply and demand of that stock.
1476.74s: And so when you, first of all, when you take all of this buying or selling activity from
1484.02s: retail and siphon it off, sit it all in virtue, the NBBO stops reflecting that supply and
1490.38s: demand.
1491.38s: Right.
1492.38s: So part of the effects are that the spread widens, like we've talked about, but it is
1498.42s: very plausible to think that one of the effects of that can be that the direction of the price
1504.86s: can be altered.
1507.38s: And so, you know, when I send a buy order in as a retail investor and it gets internalized
1514.82s: by Citadel or virtue and I get my fill back, you know, that trade prints to the tape.
1520.62s: And I know that that buy happened, but what that buy order didn't do is it didn't hit
1525.66s: the offer, right?
1527.90s: It didn't actually hit the orders that are out there being broadcast in the market.
1533.38s: So it didn't impact the NBBO in the same way as if that order had been sent to an exchange
1539.98s: and hits the NBBO.
1541.82s: And so that really can serve to hinder the price discovery process as well.
1546.94s: And so I do think that that's a problem that internalization and wholesaling lead to.
1553.90s: And then, you know, there's an entire other side of this that gets into short selling.
1559.22s: And what the impact of short selling is on the market.
1564.10s: And I'm not someone who will argue against short selling broadly speaking.
1568.62s: I think you should be able to short something just like you should be able to go long something.
1572.82s: I think it has an important impact.
1576.74s: And it's an important force in markets to keep things in line.
1580.50s: And I think I've seen enough research to know that short selling bands either have negative
1585.54s: effects on the price discovery process or no effect.
1588.98s: And, you know, it's not entirely clear.
1591.58s: But again, it's enough to tell me that it's an important feature of markets.
1597.54s: But when someone shorts something, they are creating more supply.
1605.18s: Right? That's the nature of short selling.
1607.34s: I'm borrowing 100 shares from investor A.
1610.66s: And I'm selling them to investor B.
1612.74s: And now investor A and B both are holding 100 shares.
1616.82s: But only 100 exist.
1621.14s: And they're being borrowed and then replicated essentially.
1624.50s: And so to a certain degree, that's fine.
1629.14s: But when it starts to exceed certain thresholds or when there are failures to deliver that don't
1633.98s: get remediated, that creates this idea of synthetic shares, which increases the supply of shares
1640.30s: in the market.
1641.50s: And again, that conserved it.
1643.46s: What happens when supply increases?
1645.30s: Price drops.
1646.02s: That's very straightforward impact on supply and demand.
1650.82s: And I don't know that it's something that regulators are paying enough attention to.
1655.30s: That's awesome.
1655.90s: And I appreciate the explanation.
1657.50s: It's just something that I think, again, I think that the effects are subtle enough that a lot of
1663.78s: people don't really synthesize them totally.
1666.78s: But I do think that they're profound over time.
1669.90s: And another kind of dovetail off of that.
1675.10s: I saw a tweet that you put out, always my favorite to see what tweets you got going on.
1684.58s: And there was one that you put out on the 19th about breaking up the Google and Facebook
1691.18s: ad exchange monopolies.
1692.18s: So a little bit of a changing gear, but I would be remiss if I didn't bring up a chance
1697.10s: to talk about Facebook and your love for them.
1700.30s: And for anybody that's just listening, that's just not true at all.
1704.30s: Not a big fan.
1706.30s: So, but anyways, can you talk to me a little bit about that tweet?
1712.14s: And specifically, what you're targeting when we're talking about the ad monopoly between
1719.54s: Google and Facebook.
1720.54s: And the reason why I bring it up now is a lot of the conversation we've had so far has
1724.86s: been very centered on this same kind of concept.
1728.30s: It's a different space, not exactly markets, but two very big market players.
1732.86s: And they're exerting their power.
1734.26s: So I'd love to hear just your take on what is going on between Google and Facebook, the
1738.82s: ad exchanges.
1740.82s: And then kind of where we're trying to go with this.
1743.74s: Yeah, thanks for bringing it up.
1745.74s: It's a thing that I'm so fascinated by and passionate about.
1751.66s: And it's not what I do on a day-to-day basis.
1753.82s: But I was fortunate enough to get to work with some folks in the Senate who were writing
1762.58s: this bill.
1764.58s: And the idea was that Google and Facebook and other firms as well run these ad exchanges.
1774.86s: And it's become a really substantial economic force.
1780.02s: It's responsible for a giant chunk of each of those firms revenue.
1784.82s: And those are two of the most valuable firms in the world.
1787.98s: And not only do they operate in exchange, but they also operate the brokers.
1794.82s: So they have brokers that they operate to buy ads, brokers they operate to sell ads, they
1801.26s: operate the exchange.
1802.74s: And then from a trading perspective, who even knows what's going on?
1806.06s: There's no transparency into these operations whatsoever.
1810.46s: Just a quick note.
1813.06s: I pulled it up for Facebook.
1816.02s: Well, meta right now advertising is 94.9% essentially of their value duration for market
1823.62s: caps.
1824.62s: So it just bolsters your point that they're very interested in ads.
1828.38s: Yeah, that's right.
1829.66s: And so they operate these exchanges.
1832.30s: And they have complete control almost over every aspect of what's taking place on those
1839.14s: exchanges.
1840.14s: And there's no transparency at all.
1842.46s: So the idea that I was approached with was, can we take these ad exchanges and kind of
1851.06s: fit them into the current framework of financial regulation?
1856.54s: And because in financial regulation, you've got decades of established precedent and
1864.06s: case law and regulatory approaches and a lot of experienced people out there.
1870.10s: And I thought, wow, what a great idea.
1873.70s: It was so fascinating to me.
1875.62s: And so I said, yeah, I'd love to sort of think about how you could do that and doesn't
1880.42s: make sense and what can we focus on?
1882.42s: And so I worked with them and I'm very pleased with the bill that came out of it.
1888.14s: And it's a bill that has a lot of bipartisan support.
1891.02s: I mean, it's being co-sponsored by both like Senator Mike Lee from Utah and Amy Klobuchar
1898.42s: of Minnesota, right?
1899.42s: Like, both sides are interested in this bill amongst other antitrust bills aimed at big
1905.62s: tech.
1906.62s: And this is the kind of thing that would first break up the monopoly.
1910.18s: So that's part of what I think is the most revolutionary about this particular bill.
1917.02s: It is taking aim square at these firms and it is saying, they need to be broken up, which
1923.06s: is a very standard approach to antitrust.
1925.70s: But it's really the first time that Congress, at least that I'm aware of, has said, we support
1931.06s: that kind of intervention because it's the only thing you can really do with firms of
1935.82s: this size.
1937.34s: So you start by breaking them up and you don't let them operate both brokers and the exchange.
1943.58s: You provide disclosure and transparency around how brokers are routing to different ad
1949.46s: exchanges and what kind of execution quality they're getting.
1953.10s: So very analogous to US financial markets.
1956.18s: You put a duty of best execution onto these brokers.
1959.70s: And in fact, the duty of best execution in the bill would be stronger than the one in US
1964.26s: financial markets.
1965.26s: It would be an order by order standard, which is one that I've advocated for in US markets
1970.26s: for many years now.
1972.50s: And so there are all sorts of other details in the bill.
1976.42s: One, another one is about data ownership that people will own their own data, which is,
1981.42s: it might seem like a really minor thing.
1983.42s: But today in the stock market, when you send an order, you don't own that order information.
1991.62s: The exchange actually ends up owning it.
1994.78s: And then they turn around and they sell that with these high speed data feeds and proprietary
2000.86s: data feeds for exorbitant amounts of money.
2004.10s: So just that little detail of wait, you should own your data, not the exchange could also
2009.42s: prevent a huge set of problems and conflicts of interest in the ad market that we already
2013.70s: see in financial services.
2016.14s: So I think it's great.
2017.66s: I think the big tech monopolies are one of the most destructive forces in the US, in the
2024.14s: world.
2025.70s: And I think, again, I believe in competition.
2028.74s: And I believe that when you get concentrated corporate power, you have to intervene in order
2033.58s: to try and break things up and try and increase competition.
2036.66s: That's awesome.
2038.42s: Yeah, I had a chance to go through the post and then the publication.
2043.26s: And I thought that that was very educational.
2045.94s: All linked to those two as well in case anybody wants to check it out.
2050.62s: And then for those that don't know, Dave also wrote kind of a, I would almost call it
2056.06s: like a burn piece on Facebook's model in terms of the way that they create space for
2063.26s: people to have passionate disagreements.
2067.42s: Yeah.
2068.42s: Really, you know, the argument to summarize, you know, it seems like the argument is that
2073.86s: there's, they use conflict as a way to try and, yeah, drive engagement.
2078.94s: So that's another just fascinating read.
2081.26s: And it's another perspective that I honestly, I don't use social media that way personally.
2086.90s: So I don't see a lot of that.
2088.78s: But once you pointed it out, it makes a ton of sense because, you know, drama is just
2094.50s: a big thing, you know, that draws a lot of people's attention, whether it's good or bad,
2099.18s: it sells, same thing, news agencies, stuff like that, use that.
2102.18s: So I thought that was a really interesting take on it.
2105.86s: So we have a couple minutes left.
2107.50s: I've got to be efficient with our time.
2110.14s: And there's a couple of things that I want to go over so the first off last time we spoke
2114.26s: was a couple of months ago, maybe, and you were talking to me about avalanche.
2120.82s: Talk to, don't worry, I'm letting you off the hook on the other one.
2124.26s: Talk to me.
2125.10s: I was sure we were going to talk about that.
2127.02s: That's okay. We can talk about it.
2128.82s: Oh, no. What? You know what?
2130.30s: I'm leaving that one alone.
2132.02s: I'm just kind of letting the tape speak for itself.
2137.26s: Yeah, I, you know, I think I still think that we are in some extraordinary circumstances.
2144.34s: But, you know, I probably underestimated the force of the Fed in those circumstances.
2150.90s: But, but when you look at oil as a result of this, you know, stupid war,
2155.94s: hard to argue that some structural inflation isn't in place right now.
2160.90s: Yeah.
2165.26s: I didn't say anything.
2169.06s: Back to avalanche.
2173.46s: But I am genuinely curious.
2175.70s: I look at the crypto market and I continue to struggle to place what it does.
2182.98s: Like, and I mean that just in terms of how does it fit into the broader markets?
2186.98s: There's lots of people, it was an inflation hedge.
2190.50s: That hedge you work in, you know, it's the new goals.
2194.22s: And, you know, apparently gold is extremely volatile.
2197.74s: If that's the, you know what I mean?
2198.78s: It's just like, I see a lot of different arguments on what it does.
2203.66s: And beyond the aspirational side of things, I had a chance to look at a little bit more,
2210.06s: like specifically avalanche and some of the current technology and stuff like that.
2213.50s: But I would just love to get an update from you on, you know, just what you think about avalanche today.
2220.62s: And what your general disposition is towards it in terms of how does it fit into the broader
2227.10s: cryptocurrency slash blockchain space?
2230.22s: Sure. And, you know, I think crypto is a space.
2234.46s: So I, I mean, I was, I think I've talked about it before.
2238.06s: I bought Bitcoin now 11 years ago.
2241.34s: I did not hold on to that Bitcoin, of course.
2243.90s: But I have been in this market for as long as, you know, most others.
2250.06s: It is not my full-time job.
2251.50s: There are plenty of people that have done that for much, for a very long time now.
2255.18s: But, you know, I have been through, I don't know, this will be the fourth.
2259.18s: I think crypto winter.
2261.74s: And so the price drops, they don't mean much to me.
2267.18s: They happen regularly.
2270.54s: And so, you know, it is, it's a brand new asset class.
2273.98s: It's extremely volatile.
2277.74s: Is it potentially a long-term store of value?
2282.94s: I think so.
2283.98s: I think, and I think you different crypto's serve different purposes.
2287.66s: So, Bitcoin is what I would call, you know, a potential long-term store of value,
2294.86s: a potential inflation hedge.
2297.66s: It has become highly correlated to equity markets for all sorts of reasons.
2304.78s: But, you know, if you do believe that inflation is problematic in the long run,
2312.78s: and you are looking for something that is, you know, controlled from that perspective,
2318.14s: Bitcoin is very appealing in that way.
2320.54s: Right.
2322.94s: As for Avalanche, when I first learned about it, first, I was looking to better understand proof of
2330.22s: stake, and I was looking for something that had the flexibility for broad adoption.
2339.42s: And Avalanche really fit the bill.
2342.86s: It's proof of stake and consensus algorithm.
2345.02s: I thought we're so innovative when I first learned about it, that it was almost enough for me
2350.30s: just to jump in based on that.
2353.18s: But, but the, some of the features that the network has, and it's complicated, but,
2360.62s: you know, there's a thing called subnets, which allow you to sort of stand up another chain
2365.18s: on the Avalanche network and completely control the characteristics of that chain,
2369.58s: so that you can have completely regulated systems that are perfectly compliant on top of the
2376.86s: Avalanche chain, for example.
2379.58s: And so I do think that over time, it's one of the few that will win out.
2384.54s: And, and, you know, I've been a big fan of it for a while.
2388.62s: You know, look, the price has been extremely volatile.
2391.98s: A year and a half ago, it was trading, you know, for almost nothing.
2396.94s: Now it's in the 30s.
2398.46s: It was trading in highs, highs like 160 at one point, which was crazy.
2403.74s: Fun, but, you know, crazy.
2405.98s: But, you know, I think that what you're looking at, what you're looking for in a crypto currency,
2413.98s: is you're looking for something that is actually decentralized.
2417.98s: Which is, and, and especially relative to some of the other proof of stake systems out there.
2424.06s: Avalanche is far more decentralized.
2425.74s: You're looking for something that is being used today.
2428.62s: And the fees being generated on Avalanche are, are like the, you know,
2433.18s: four, top four or something behind Bitcoin Ethereum and Binance.
2438.30s: And you're looking for something that's cheap and fast.
2441.58s: And that's what Avalanche is.
2442.70s: It's extremely cheap and extremely fast.
2444.78s: And so, to me, that means that it can form the basis of a future financial system, right?
2450.14s: It can disintermediate large financial institutions.
2454.54s: It can help to collateralize or securitize things without needing those kinds of institutions.
2461.74s: It can facilitate loans without needing those kinds of institutions.
2466.38s: You can use it for, you know, mortgages and real estate transactions.
2470.94s: Eventually, you can use it for, you know, offerings, like token offerings, litigation offerings.
2476.94s: So, I think that the problem is you're looking for, okay, well, what does it do today?
2482.46s: What is it really fixing or changing?
2485.26s: And the problem is, again, it's early days.
2487.02s: Avalanche has hardly been around a year and a half now.
2490.78s: And so, it's, you know, it's still growing into what it will be.
2495.66s: And a lot of crypto, you can say the same thing.
2498.06s: But I think that there's some fascinating stuff in smart contract technology
2503.26s: that can help to address issues in US equity markets, for example,
2507.50s: and the settlement and clearing side of the business.
2510.46s: I think there are some really interesting things in terms of like tokenization and securitization
2516.86s: that, you know, you can get rid, you know, functionally of a lot of counterparty risk in systems like this.
2524.38s: So, you know, I think that crypto has a use case.
2528.46s: It has functionality.
2530.54s: But up until now, it's still been the purview of a small set of people
2535.26s: because the user experience isn't there and the interfaces aren't there to make it
2539.74s: accessible to the average person.
2541.90s: And, you know, think what you will of NFTs, for example,
2544.86s: but NFTs have helped to address that because they've helped to make crypto a bit more accessible.
2551.74s: And, you know, I love art.
2554.78s: I love artwork.
2555.98s: And I think that NFTs are a fascinating new medium of art.
2560.94s: And I think that, you know, people that kind of dismiss it are sort of missing the point, right?
2566.06s: Like they're like, oh, well, I can just right click and download an NFT.
2568.78s: It's like, yeah, I can go take a picture of the Mona Lisa.
2570.86s: But, you know, like, that doesn't mean that I own the Mona Lisa, right?
2574.46s: There's a difference.
2576.22s: And that difference has always been sort of a characteristic of visual art.
2580.62s: And I think always will be.
2582.22s: So, you know, I think that I'm, I don't know, I love it.
2587.02s: And I love the space that it's creating.
2589.02s: And it's like, but I also see crypto rediscovering a lot of securities law.
2596.78s: And it's very funny to see it's like, wait, we didn't have investor protection.
2601.18s: Or, you know, like this, this Luna UST thing happens.
2604.22s: Like, wait, we didn't have depository insurance.
2606.78s: What's going on here?
2608.14s: And so, you know, I think that that's going to happen.
2612.30s: And the space is going to recognize the value of securities laws in a lot of ways.
2617.18s: But maybe eventually the two worlds will come together in a more efficient, decentralized,
2622.78s: disintermediated way, which is again, sort of thematic of a lot of the stuff that I like to talk about.
2628.46s: Yeah, that's awesome.
2629.34s: I'm definitely, I'm one of those people that I don't personally understand NFTs in terms of like
2635.98s: the appeal, but I get the appeal for other people.
2639.42s: And I could see how, you know, I was watching people, you know, talk about like what he does.
2645.02s: And I think the stuff he makes is wild, which is kind of cool.
2648.38s: But then, yeah, I like, I can, I can see that.
2652.54s: I'm not very artistic myself.
2654.38s: I don't have that part of my brain, but, yeah, maybe I think my favorite part about the NFTs,
2660.06s: I got to be honest with you is when somebody has, you know, the NFT,
2663.50s: and then they come up with like a digital display for it.
2666.78s: That, because then I'm thinking like that's, that's just art.
2669.90s: Just get a painting, man, like you're right there.
2671.98s: But then, you know, it doesn't have lights and all that cool stuff.
2674.54s: So I get, I get what people like it, but I do just get such a kick out of that.
2678.30s: You want like a digital piece of art to display physically that sounds like a physical piece of digital art.
2685.66s: You know, but I mean, people like, people were dismissive of, you know,
2690.22s: pop art and street art and Banksy and that kind of stuff.
2693.58s: And, you know, in the end, they were wrong and art is art, right?
2697.82s: Like, it's like, I don't pretend to understand it.
2700.70s: I know a good piece that like speaks to me and resonates with me.
2704.46s: And I've seen NFTs like that.
2706.14s: And I've seen real art like that.
2707.50s: And yes, you know, that's, what can you do?
2709.98s: I think it's easy to not understand this world and to be dismissive of it.
2716.22s: But, you know, I just think that's probably, you know, a boomer thing.
2721.90s: I think so too.
2722.62s: Yeah, I really do.
2723.58s: And I also think that, you know, that's like one of the downfalls of a lot of people is,
2728.14s: you know, if they don't immediately understand something that they dismiss it.
2731.26s: Yeah.
2731.74s: You know, like, because I honestly think NFTs are actually going to be kind of prolific for at least,
2737.18s: you know, until there's a new iteration of them or something.
2739.26s: But just because I don't personally understand them totally,
2742.86s: it doesn't mean, you know, that they're effectiveness or their audiences and they're,
2746.46s: because I think it's exactly as you said, a lot of it comes down to the individual interaction
2752.22s: with that art.
2753.18s: And people react to different pieces of art in different ways.
2757.34s: And I think that that's where it comes from.
2759.10s: Yeah.
2759.74s: It does seem like a lot of people though are hesitant because it's like,
2763.98s: there's just a money grab.
2765.10s: There's so many people, you know, just piling into the space.
2768.30s: But what art doesn't do that, right?
2770.30s: It's the same thing.
2771.10s: Exactly.
2771.50s: It's the same thing, right?
2772.54s: Same thing.
2773.02s: Like that same new crypto.
2774.22s: Like everyone's like, oh, it's just a scam.
2775.82s: It's a Ponzi.
2776.46s: It's like, well, you know, like welcome to markets, right?
2778.86s: How many scams and Ponzi's are there in markets?
2781.50s: Like, you know, is isn't a shock to anyone?
2784.14s: You know, that's what I mean.
2785.10s: It's like crypto rediscovering securities laws.
2787.58s: And you know, all these frauds and scams, that's just sort of human nature to try and,
2792.62s: you know, commit crime and rip people off.
2794.46s: And it's human nature to, you know, want easy money or want to get rich quick.
2798.94s: And, you know, so just because you can do it online versus do it, you know, I don't know,
2803.66s: over email for doing it, you know, in a physical place.
2806.62s: I don't know.
2807.26s: There's big difference there.
2808.94s: Yeah.
2809.42s: Yeah.
2810.14s: I agree.
2810.94s: Well, I know that we are at time.
2812.78s: I appreciate you hanging out with me for a while.
2814.46s: I definitely am looking forward to connecting with you again in the next, you know,
2817.74s: a couple of months to take a pulse check on how things are going.
2821.26s: I'm really excited to see, you know, the terminal continue to grow,
2824.30s: which is the platform that that you're working on.
2827.82s: And I think that that's going to be such a great tool for retail traders.
2832.14s: So I am really excited to hear more about that.
2835.98s: And yeah, I just always enjoy the conversation.
2839.34s: I think that getting your perspective on things is always fascinating because you are
2843.02s: definitely plugged into a different audience than a lot of us are.
2847.66s: And thank you for taking the time to bring that perspective, you know, to the broader
2852.06s: communities. We really do appreciate it.
2853.82s: Yeah.
2854.22s: I'm happy to.
2854.86s: I always enjoy the conversation too.
2856.62s: Yeah, like I'm excited next time I'll be able to show you.
2859.58s: I think a bit more of the terminal.
2860.94s: It's coming along.

2865.66s: We open it up on Friday to our investors.
2868.86s: And we should be opening it up to the beta wait list in a few weeks.
2873.34s: And we're just we're so excited to show like all the different great data sets we've
2878.38s: brought together, different ways of looking at them.
2880.70s: And more importantly, learning, you know, how to use them.
2884.14s: What do they mean and how to get better at investing and hopefully, you know,
2887.90s: building long-term wealth?
2889.58s: Yeah, I absolutely love it.
2891.66s: I am so stoked to check it out more.
2893.42s: I get excited every time I see a little bit more come out about it.
2896.86s: So yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing what it does.
