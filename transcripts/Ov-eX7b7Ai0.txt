0.00s: Money cannot buy you happiness, poverty can't buy you anything.
3.52s: That's really the path for most traders is unsuccessful production of capital,
9.36s: meaning we're actually losing money.
11.36s: If you think about creating wealth in terms of a broader plan,
15.68s: there are a handful of really important concepts that I'm going to share with you,
19.28s: three of them to be specific.
20.80s: And these are the exact things that I've used coming from a
24.72s: single mom in a low income area to being a multi-millionaire before I'm 32.
30.00s: And that's not some sort of big flex.
32.08s: I am a Neanderthal just like most other traders.
35.04s: The point I'm trying to highlight here is that it is entirely possible
38.96s: to find your way into a different trajectory if you are thoughtful about what you do.
44.32s: What's up everybody?
45.04s: Eric here will come back to all the outliers, shout out to the YouTube members
48.24s: and the Patreon fam.
49.36s: Thank you guys for supporting the channel and let's get right into it.
52.64s: The very first thing that you are going to see here are some things that you're not going to want to hear
57.12s: and it's whatever it is what it is.
59.84s: The very first thing, the $5,000 account, the $10,000 account that you start with
65.20s: is not going to be your future wealth.
68.24s: So this idea of starting with a small amount of money and trading it into a huge amount of money
74.24s: just sets you up or failure to the highest probability.
78.32s: Do not do this.
80.80s: This money is your starting capital.
83.28s: This is not what's going to be your retirement.
85.68s: Or really on, obviously, the inverse here is saving.
90.56s: Saving is the hands down most important lever you're going to pull on early.
95.36s: No, that's not sexy.
96.72s: No, that's not fun to hear.
98.40s: It's the reality because most of us are not special.
103.84s: What I mean by that is yes, we might think we can pick up the skill set of trading.
108.88s: We might think that we have a high propensity to be super successful at it.
112.72s: We have the skills that might lend us to that success.
116.16s: However, this is the reality.
118.72s: Most people do not.
120.40s: Most people are posting on Wall Street bets that please help.
124.48s: I've not slept in days because their position is down 47% over the course of a few days.
131.36s: This is the reality.
132.72s: So what I offer to you is while you might be special,
136.08s: you might have the proclivity to be fantastic at trading.
139.68s: You don't really know it upfront and most of us aren't.
142.96s: So I would avoid landing on the fact that you are rainman for your future wealth.
149.36s: What I mean by that is focusing on a more probabilistic outcome.
153.44s: That's what I did.
154.48s: So what does that actually mean?
156.24s: Well, we need to take a look at a few things.
158.00s: The first one is the compound growth calculator.
160.08s: I've done a bunch of videos on these.
161.44s: But what I want to highlight here is this is starting with $20,000 at a 12%
166.00s: yield annual for 20 years.
168.24s: Notice the $100 a month contribution gets you to $280,000.
172.16s: The $1,000 a month gets you to $1 million.
175.20s: What does this tell you?
176.24s: Saving.
176.80s: Saving is incredibly important.
179.04s: Now, the ability to change this interest rate by getting better at trading is important.
183.60s: But saving is accessible to all of us.
186.64s: The variable that is this in terms of the interest rate you're able to produce as a trader,
191.92s: it's a bigger variable, and again, statistically speaking, most people are not going to
195.76s: help reform the market.
196.72s: It's a pill that's hard to swallow, but it's an important one to acknowledge.
200.08s: The other thing is conservative estimates.
202.08s: When I'm filling in these things like the monthly contribution to figure out where I want to be
206.16s: in X number of years, I'm not pretending I'm going to be able to put everything in there.
210.40s: I'm going to plan conservatively.
211.92s: That includes both the yield and the monthly contribution.
215.20s: But what I'm highlighting here is trying to create a realistic target for you.
219.44s: The only way all of this can happen is if we embrace this delayed gratification.
224.64s: And you might be saying to yourself, Eric, it doesn't seem like you're delaying gratification.
230.16s: And you're right.
231.28s: At this point, I've delayed gratification long enough to be able to afford things that I enjoy
238.00s: from automotive to trips to Kauai, to trips dive trips to Curacao, to a $2 million
244.72s: house in Southern California.
246.64s: All of that comes down to careful planning.
250.00s: And it starts with delayed gratification.
252.32s: The better you can, the better job you can do with this early on,
255.84s: the bigger the impacts you're going to see on these numbers.
260.80s: Because again, even if you're a really great trader, you can drive the yield of your returns up.
266.72s: The more you can turn this number up, the better the results are going to be more quickly.
273.44s: The other thing I want to highlight on this page is paper trading.
276.32s: This is another thing that everybody hates, but going back to the idea that we are not special.
281.76s: The whole idea of trading is we think we can outperform the market.
287.04s: You think you could do better than the market.
288.80s: We know statistically that that is a small subset of traders that can do that.
293.28s: But what does that mean?
294.16s: We think we can do something that a lot of people try and they fail at.
297.84s: That means you're special.
299.12s: But I'm just saying we're not special.
300.72s: So how does this happen?
302.08s: You've got to develop the skillset.
303.60s: It's just like if you do any sort of martial arts, there are times when somebody with very little
308.56s: experience can walk in like John Jones.
310.72s: He can train for a relatively short period of time and you could just start crushing people.
315.36s: That exists.
316.32s: Guess what? Life is in fair.
318.16s: Most of us don't fall into that category and we have to work our asses off to find that same level
324.00s: of success.
324.80s: That's what this is.
325.76s: The whole idea of paper trading is to make sure that we are developing this skill set
330.56s: while avoiding some of these big pitfalls.
333.52s: And that's what I want to talk to you about now is the pitfalls.
336.88s: The first one I want to cover is this right here, the gill gap and draw downs.
342.72s: If you start trading right out of the gate because you think you are a rainman and you're super
347.84s: good at this and despite what everybody says, you're not going to be that guy and you're not in
353.60s: the scenario where you're losing all your money like this dude and you're going to be great.
358.32s: Cool.
358.88s: The problem is good traders make it look easy.
362.72s: That's the skill gap so it can be very misleading.
365.36s: That's one of the issues with trading in general.
367.52s: The stock market is unbelievably misleading in that way where the people that do a good job,
373.52s: they make it seem easy.
375.20s: We want to do things like automate everything.
377.36s: We want algos to do it for us.
379.28s: There's a reason why those don't dominate the marketplace yet because as soon as we can do that,
385.12s: everybody will do it.
386.56s: Even though there are small subsets of people that can make a lot of money trading realistically.
391.76s: So we got to make sure that we are guarding against skill gap and making sure that our growth rate
397.12s: makes sense for our skill set.
398.64s: The head and the sand approach is super common.
401.28s: It's when traders they don't want to have a trading plan.
403.60s: They don't want to be held accountable for what they're doing.
405.60s: They don't want to be responsible for the outcomes.
408.08s: They want to be able to blame things so they don't have a trading log.
410.48s: And essentially we just go in circles because our ego prevents us from making good decisions
415.20s: and making sure that we're controlling things.
417.04s: The problem with this is you're not going to gain any traction.
419.68s: If you do not have a trading plan and if you do not have a trading log that is documenting your
426.16s: capacity and your success in paper trading, you are putting your head in the sand.
430.56s: You're just hoping that you're going to figure out on the fly because you do better under pressure
434.80s: or you perform better when you have skin in the game.
437.12s: I'll tell you what, I'm really thankful we don't say that in the Marine Corps that in order to
441.76s: prep for war, you don't have to get shot to practice getting shot at and moving under pressure.
447.12s: It's a really awful approach to high volatility scenarios and it includes trading.
452.32s: So what you need to avoid is draw downs.
455.44s: What do I mean by that? Well, there's a big problem with draw downs.
459.20s: Take a look at this account.
460.40s: I have a video that's going to come up soon.
462.32s: But take a look at the returns on this account.
465.28s: There's portfolio three over here.
467.52s: They have a 30% return, a negative 25% return, then a 12% 14% 12% returns.
473.60s: By all accounts, that's a pretty damn solid series of returns and it's an average return of 8.6%.
479.60s: Look at the compound annual growth rate.
481.84s: Look at the ending value.
483.76s: They have an 8.6 average average return, a 6.87% Kagger, but 140k.
489.20s: Let's take a look at portfolio one.
490.80s: 10% 20.
492.08s: I'm sorry, 10% 10% 2% 10% 5% returns.
495.60s: Now, one of these cracks, even the lowest positive return over here.
500.88s: However, the average return is 7.4%.
503.76s: It's less than the average return over here.
505.92s: Look at the compound annual growth rate.
507.76s: 7.35% compared to 6.87%.
511.36s: That means that on these smaller returns, you have made more money than this person with a 1.2% better average return.
521.36s: This is the impact of draw downs.
523.76s: The last thing I want to note here is the myopic approach.
526.88s: This is a video, or this is from a video I put out what last year, on a rental property that I sold.
533.04s: I made 263,000 dollars and it was tax-free because of capital gains tax on recently lived in properties.
542.96s: There's different tax codes that apply to real estate.
545.04s: But the point being is I made decent money trading.
547.84s: However, we can also make money in other endeavors and I cannot overemphasize
553.28s: how important it is to do that.
555.68s: I do not just trade.
557.76s: I am an angel investor.
559.92s: I am also involved in residential and commercial real estate.
563.44s: Beyond my investing stuff, beyond the stuff I'm starting to do with YouTube,
568.16s: you've got to find other ways to increase your income because if you increase your income,
574.08s: when we look at the monthly contribution,
577.12s: what you can save to then compound with the skillset you've developed,
581.44s: that's where it comes from, making more income.
584.40s: So all in all,
585.60s: trading can be incredibly lucrative.
588.16s: I've done very well trading.
589.60s: I've outperformed the market for the last 15 years running.
592.96s: You can do well.
594.32s: Even still, it is so important to have a holistic approach to your wealth development
600.48s: and for traders that includes the concepts I outlined here.
604.08s: So if you made it to end, don't forget to like the video,
606.72s: throw it down in the comments, anything that stood out to you or anything that I missed from this list.
611.44s: And until next time, be an outlier.
612.88s: See you later. Don't forget to subscribe.
