0.80s: what's up to all the outliers eric here
2.88s: i got a fun video for you today so i was
5.92s: doing some market research earlier and i
7.68s: got an invite to a paid discord server
10.40s: under like a free trial period um so
13.44s: this video is going to do a couple
14.72s: things i'm going to show you literally
16.32s: the conversation that i had with them
18.40s: and most importantly i want to highlight
21.04s: all of the red flags that i had
23.52s: in the conversations for new traders
26.48s: really for any trader don't use a paid
28.88s: discord server
30.40s: they
31.20s: are absolutely garbage i've been invited
33.52s: to a bunch of them i haven't found a
35.04s: good one yet not to say that there might
37.04s: not be a good one out there but a far
39.44s: better use of your time and energy is to
40.96s: buy a book now another thing i do not
44.56s: hate the hustle most of these people are
46.80s: trying to be business-minded they see
48.88s: you know stock twits doing what they're
50.56s: doing they're like well i could you know
52.16s: start one of those the issue i take with
54.56s: them is they prey on new traders or
57.68s: investors i take a personal issue with
59.52s: that hence why i'm literally doing a
61.52s: public service announcement on it right
63.04s: now so i am not going to go into the
65.44s: specific discord group i'm not going to
67.44s: go into the specific people i talk to i
69.68s: got all their names out of it but i want
71.36s: to teach you
72.72s: how to look for these red flags because
74.40s: there's a bunch of them so let's dive
77.12s: straight in this is the first
80.48s: message that i got so this is a dm from
82.40s: the owner
83.68s: they said that you know would you like
85.84s: access to this chat to view over 10
87.92s: analyst daily alerts they're referring
89.92s: to them as analysts
91.60s: which is again just it tickles me
94.24s: because it's so crazy that they go that
97.92s: direction with it
99.36s: so it's a paid service they go through
101.52s: what some of their stuff they offered
103.36s: you know some options traders swing
105.28s: traders via stock day traders stuff like
107.84s: that
108.64s: and i ask if there's you know are there
111.20s: profiles like with their experience
113.12s: levels with audited returns
115.52s: and they essentially said that their
117.84s: intros
119.44s: share what they do and their win rates
122.64s: this is the highlight here red flag
125.28s: numbers three really other than a random
128.32s: person on discord message you to join
130.24s: their paid discord the fact that they're
132.08s: already focusing on win rates tells me a
133.92s: lot that is a amateur investor move
137.20s: amateur trader move people who do this
139.28s: for a long time don't focus on win rates
141.36s: it's part of an important equation but a
143.76s: high win rate can still lose money over
146.16s: time that's called negative expectancy
148.00s: you can have a trade strategy
150.64s: that wins 90 of the time but loses money
152.96s: conversely you can have a strategy that
155.28s: is accurate 35 of the time but is
158.40s: positively expected so people focus on
161.44s: this because it sells well if you have
162.88s: somebody that says i can you know 90 win
165.12s: rate everybody immediately thinks that
166.48s: they're going to make fat stacks kind of
168.48s: like the analyst that i talked to but
171.92s: it's not accurate so
173.92s: let's go to the conversation with the
175.68s: analysts this was my favorite so you got
178.08s: a fav you got a kind of a
180.00s: bit about who they are they're talking
182.08s: about their 85 to 90 return over three
185.36s: months this is hilarious because you'll
188.24s: see
189.28s: the way that they calculate their
191.36s: returns which they say for the past two
194.24s: weeks was 352
197.04s: the way that they're calculating their
198.72s: returns is simply by adding up the
201.36s: percent return for each trade and they
204.88s: are calling that their total return
208.56s: hilarious that's not that's done
211.04s: so again just another red flag coming
213.68s: out of this person so
215.44s: going back up to their intro it talks
218.48s: about their background um and then it
220.64s: says that they're gonna try to provide
223.12s: an 80 win
224.84s: rate again the focus on the win rate is
228.24s: such a red flag
229.92s: next red flag i asked them how long
231.76s: they've been trading they say five years
233.92s: 10 plus if you count paper trading
238.00s: isn't that precious they've only been
240.56s: trading for five years
242.32s: and in order to sound more legitimate
245.12s: they want you to see a bigger number so
248.24s: they throw their paper trading numbers
250.32s: out there
251.36s: unfortunately
252.80s: nobody gives a about your paper
255.84s: trading just being clear
258.16s: so moving on they talk about combining
261.04s: technical and fundamental analysis
263.68s: this turns into a red flag this by a
266.72s: statement in and of itself yeah you know
269.04s: could be
270.00s: but what you'll notice is later on they
272.16s: say that their average time window for
274.56s: trading is one to four weeks
277.28s: fundamental analysis doesn't matter that
279.76s: much in that time frame not to say it
281.52s: doesn't matter at all
283.20s: but to even really add that as a part of
286.24s: your overall approach if you're swing
287.92s: trading again they're just throwing
289.92s: buzzwords out there trying to sound more
291.60s: legitimate that's not going to be a main
293.44s: part of your strategy
295.28s: all right so let's go into their trades
296.96s: i loved this part they talked about a
300.00s: sample of the alerts that they give
302.64s: and they talked about their 95 win rate
305.36s: over the last three two weeks or over
307.44s: the last two weeks which gave them a
309.44s: total return of 352 again completely
312.00s: inaccurate calculation of that but
314.08s: whatever
315.20s: the other red flag this isn't how option
317.92s: traders are gonna list out their trades
320.24s: this is just random numbers and
323.12s: there's no actual detail here it doesn't
325.92s: tell you you know bto sto none of that's
329.28s: there most most options traders are
331.52s: going to list up their trades in a
333.04s: similar fashion to what they see on
334.40s: their platform that's not what this is
336.32s: this is just a person that is seeing you
338.56s: know maybe placing trades but they're
340.48s: not processing it like most of us do and
343.04s: reporting it the way that the large
344.56s: majority of the community does so
346.64s: again as a standalone measure this
350.00s: could be fine but in conjunction with
352.56s: everything else i've seen so far in the
354.16s: conversation another red flag
356.48s: and then here's a huge red flag it says
360.16s: that they sold half of the position for
362.24s: nine percent and then they were stopped
363.84s: out at the remaining position
366.40s: they say that they like to get stopped
368.48s: out at break even once they're at 10 or
371.20s: more and they walked away with a 5
374.48s: return
376.08s: here's the deal
377.76s: you're starting to see a couple things
379.36s: the first one is i don't hate the fact
381.28s: that they're taking partial profits
382.72s: that's actually kind of a good thing but
384.24s: the problem is is they they're not
386.40s: making any money here they're adding
388.56s: risk out but they're getting five
391.28s: percent return on the capital that's a
392.96s: problem so again in a vacuum that's not
396.64s: necessarily a bad thing it could be okay
399.36s: but in light of everything else i'm
400.88s: seeing the red flag i get here is i bet
403.76s: this is a negatively expectant strategy
406.24s: that's my guess
407.52s: so
408.48s: we will
409.60s: find out more about that right now
412.64s: so i asked them for any numbers because
414.80s: all they use is percentages in reporting
416.56s: the trades which is another problem you
418.40s: can't tell what amount of money they
420.32s: entered or exited the trade for which is
422.16s: important for calculating
424.56s: expectancy you got it which this person
427.68s: doesn't even know what it is which we'll
429.12s: get into in just a minute
430.80s: so
432.00s: they're saying about their win rate um
434.48s: about how they like to trade naked calls
436.64s: or puts based on opinion sometimes
439.04s: they'll do spreads
440.56s: this is entertaining how have you done
443.28s: over your four or five over your five
445.20s: years of trading well i didn't always
447.36s: have the capital especially at first but
449.68s: i've outperformed the market since
451.68s: entering the market in total
454.40s: what does that even mean i'm looking for
456.80s: a gagger what's your compound annual
458.88s: growth rate what is your return for each
461.04s: of the five years that you've been
462.40s: trading why do you even consider one of
464.80s: those five years if you're saying that
466.08s: you didn't have money when you were
467.44s: starting again three or four red flags
470.32s: right there
471.60s: and here is what i was looking to
474.40s: confirm essentially my thought process
476.72s: here is how does this person deploy a
479.20s: strategy do they even have a strategy
481.44s: that is defined the answer is no and
484.00s: you'll see how i could tell
485.84s: so i ask what is your general option
487.92s: strategy short calls or puts how do you
489.76s: manage them it says i'll do both
491.68s: depending on the environment that's
493.20s: completely fine for each alert i send a
496.00s: stop loss is attached then once i get 10
498.88s: percent i typically set a stop loss at
501.84s: break even for half the position and
504.08s: sell the remaining 50 in two different
506.40s: cells for 25 a quarter of the position
508.72s: each you can't make money this way this
511.68s: is a negative
513.04s: expectant strategy you can't make money
515.28s: this way
516.56s: and then the way that i confirm that is
518.96s: saying where do you place your stop
520.72s: losses so this person doesn't even know
523.12s: that i'm essentially doing their
524.40s: expectancy for them they say depends on
526.80s: the position but anywhere from 30 to 50
529.44s: percent lower
531.04s: now i know for a fact you can't make
532.88s: money here this is just a matter of math
535.84s: so as soon as some of these losses start
538.00s: rolling in that 94 win rate making 5 on
541.84s: a trade
542.80s: means nothing
544.24s: so this is just a bunch of and
548.48s: what frustrates me the most is that this
550.00s: person is trying to sell this to other
551.84s: people
552.88s: all right
554.32s: i get a little into how they select
555.92s: their deltas which is just another
557.52s: non-answer i go a little further into
560.32s: detail on their time frame what their
562.24s: average winning loss is essentially
564.08s: explicitly asking them what their
566.08s: expectancy is but they don't know how to
567.68s: answer that question i asked them you
570.24s: know what is the dollar amount for your
572.64s: win rate your average win they say a
574.96s: couple hundred each week that's also not
577.04s: what i was asking i do like the fact
579.12s: that they say that they don't risk much
580.48s: per trade three to five percent of the
581.92s: portfolio you know stereotypical fair
584.08s: risk management there so
585.76s: feather in their cap unfortunately at
587.68s: this point they are way too far gone to
590.16s: be any sort of you know authority on
592.24s: trading
593.52s: and then
594.48s: i ask you can't calculate expectancy
597.12s: with the percentage which is really what
598.88s: i was trying to get out the whole time
599.92s: and then they say sure you can percent
602.56s: return times money invested equals
605.04s: return in dollar form makes sense
607.60s: that's not expectancy
610.32s: oh sweetheart i appreciate you trying
613.04s: but it's just inaccurate
615.36s: so we go back and forth a little bit
617.04s: more um and it you know i get to the
619.60s: point where okay we're not
621.92s: there's nothing happening here so then i
624.24s: kind of divulge myself i let them know
626.24s: not divulge myself any sort of big
627.84s: reveal i just you know let them know
629.60s: that i'm not really new to this and i
631.92s: can tell that you are and this is
634.48s: something that you should probably look
635.52s: into and then this is my favorite part
636.96s: of the conversation the owner of the
640.00s: discord messages me and they say i'd
642.96s: rather you have these negotiations in
644.88s: private rather than on our
647.20s: entire discord thanks not fair to the
649.76s: other analysts
652.40s: they're selling i don't care i
655.44s: purposely did switch it over to the dm
658.56s: conversation because again part of my
661.04s: goal here with the platform is to
663.20s: empower traders even if they're
664.96s: individual traders selling shitty
666.56s: services i definitely think that this
669.36s: person should not be selling anything
671.44s: maybe lemonade but the
674.64s: it's just so disheartening to see and
676.88s: this is one of the biggest problems we
678.08s: see in the community is there are people
680.40s: who are preying on new traders like this
682.32s: all the time don't use paid discords as
685.60s: always if you have any questions or
686.72s: anything that you want to see me go over
688.16s: hit me up in the contact info in the
690.08s: video description stay away from these
692.16s: things please and i will catch you all
694.08s: later
