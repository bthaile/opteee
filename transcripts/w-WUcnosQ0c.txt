0.00s: How I would start investing. No frills, no bullshit. This is a video precipitated by one of my friends that I went to
8.08s: Officer candidate school back in 2012 with. He reached out with this exact question and I want to make a
13.52s: supplementation video for him and for other people because I know others have this question. So let's get
20.24s: straight into this thing. Very first off we have what happened here. Well this is it and overall this is just my
27.92s: buddy reaching out saying, Hey, I'm curious at what to do with my money because he makes really great money
34.32s: now, which is awesome, but he acknowledges that his investment knowledge is not right and he's looking to get
40.56s: educated, which is awesome. It's exactly why I do this. So I referred him to this blog post right here and it is a big
51.28s: post that runs through literally if you know nothing, it teaches you why investing and a lot of
59.68s: supplementation on how to go from nothing to actually opening up a brokerage account and being able to
66.56s: put on a buy and hold position. But I wanted to color in some of the shaded areas for him and hence
74.64s: let's get straight to it. So the very first thing I would advise myself if I were to start investing
80.40s: is to start with goals. And I refer to this all the time it's from Stephen Covey's seven habits of
86.80s: highly successful people. And this is begin with the end in mind. This is super important because depending on
92.40s: what your objectives are, you have to behave differently. So what I would do is outline a 20 year 10 year,
101.52s: five year one year goal that is specific, measurable, achievable in time bound. So the idea here is
110.00s: right out of the gate. We are outlining for ourselves what we want to accomplish. So in 20 years, I want
116.32s: to be fully retired in 10 years. I want to see clear progress that within the next 10 years, I will be at
124.00s: my benchmark. Over the next five years, I want to create the supplementation skill set income
130.24s: streams, those kinds of things. And then over the course of this year, I want to start investing. I'm
135.20s: going to save x number of dollars per month, that sort of thing. So once we have our goals outlined,
141.44s: we need to assess our savings and we need to save more aggressively than where you're at even right
147.60s: then. And it's a guarantee because no matter what, the earlier you start saving and prioritizing that,
155.20s: the earlier you get to this fabled early retirement that you then don't have to worry about money
161.44s: ever again. And you can start buying things that you want without worrying about if it's on sale or
166.56s: using coupons. You get to stop worrying about money. The way you get there is by sacrificing near term
174.48s: outcomes. So yes, you might not be able to go to the club three nights a week and spend a
180.16s: thousand dollars a week trying to do that. But if you give that up up front and embrace delayed
186.80s: gratification, you can start achieving much more interesting outcomes. So for here, if you were
194.56s: just saving, let's say you had a hundred dollars a month for 30 years, that gives you 36,000
200.32s: dollars. However, if you have that same hundred dollars, you're saving that hundred dollars per
204.08s: month. Over the course of 30 years, if it was invested is $200,000. This is exactly the point I'm
211.92s: trying to help express to people that saving is a giant amplifier for investing. So to recap these
221.44s: two outline what you want, start saving and get religious about it. It should be automatic every
228.16s: single month. The worst thing you could do is say, Oh, I only have $50. So it's not worth saving
233.84s: that. I'll wait until I have more and then save. That's probably the worst possible behavior you
239.04s: could have because then something always comes up. There's never a great time to move a bunch of
243.68s: money away. So you just put what you can and keep doing that automatically without fail. That will
251.92s: get you much further than like waiting for an amount that you think is good. Now you're going to
257.20s: need a plan for the traders, which is one of the paths we're going to be talking about in a minute
264.16s: for the traders. This will be your trading plan. If you are just an investor that you want to get
269.52s: into buy and hold and not mess with any of this other stuff that's totally cool and for most people
274.32s: that's smarter because most traders don't make it. So if you're going to go down the passive route,
280.32s: you still need what I would refer to as a wealth development plan. And this is a place for you to
286.00s: outline your goals, your savings protocols because writing these things out one makes them more
292.32s: powerful to allows you to test different things so that you can maybe try in your investing portfolio.
300.64s: Maybe you try rebalancing it every six months, but then you test trying it every quarter. And you
306.32s: can see the outcomes there. So this gives you some structure on what you're looking to do. And if
312.24s: you are part of the Patreon, you get this trading plan template for free. You can go download at
318.32s: any point if you're silver or above. And if you're not, you can check out this video in the notes below
324.32s: that walks through this exact concept in detail so that you can just make your own as we move
330.32s: through the video together. But you need the plan, whether you're going to actively trade or not.
336.56s: And again, that leads us to kind of these two different paths. And I just want to talk about the
340.40s: difference between them. For most people, passive investing, buying, holding investing is going to
345.12s: be a better route because you really get to capture most of the benefit, right? That 80 20 rule.
352.16s: You could put in a very little amount of effort and capture the majority of the benefits of investing
358.08s: in the stock market. You also get better tax treatment if you're holding products for longer than
363.60s: a year. The whole idea of actively trading is really for two or three purposes as far as I can see
370.64s: it. The first purpose is to outperform the stock market. And the reason why that matters is I will show
376.40s: you this right here. If we go to this compound interest calculator on my website, which is totally
382.08s: free, we can use the standard amounts here. And let's just say you're saving that extra $100 a month.
387.12s: Let's just put this out to 20 years. Okay. So now let's say that the stock market is somewhere between
392.00s: seven and 12%. So we'll leave it at 10%. This is your return. If let's just say you're buying
398.40s: holding at this rate with the savings. However, if you're able, let's say to add 5% on top of that,
406.96s: notice this kind of blue line with the triangles. All of a sudden, you would go from that 102
414.80s: thousand dollars to $205,000. That's if you're able to return 15% versus 10%. So the whole idea here
425.44s: is if you are an active trader, the first goal is to outperform the market. The second goal could be
430.40s: for income. You can trade different styles to generate monthly, quarterly income or you can trade
438.88s: to reduce portfolio variance. But that's not really a great approach in my opinion. If you're going
445.28s: to trade, it should probably be at least if it were me for one of those two reasons that I mentioned
449.92s: in the beginning. So let's talk about the environment real quick. We already know why we're investing.
454.32s: We're going to take a risk for a return. When you put money in the stock market, you are committing
459.60s: capital, which is at risk. It can decline in value or even go to zero. But we're doing that for the
466.16s: sake of a return. So when we think about the stock market, if you are brand new, this is really
472.24s: all you need to know is that there are different securities that make up the stock market. These
477.92s: are just the products you can trade. And there are things called equities derivatives and debt.
483.52s: Debt is exactly what you're used to hearing. These are your bonds that you can access to
489.12s: derivatives or things like options and futures. I primarily trade options. So I operate here a lot.
494.08s: And then equities. These are things like individual stocks. So if we take a look at this,
500.72s: this is the stock market. These are all of the different kind of products that you can trade. You
505.44s: might notice some of these names like this one, AAPL. That's Apple. You probably have heard the
510.40s: term the S&P 500. That is this product here. And these are all of the things that are within the S&P 500
517.84s: like Microsoft Apple. It's a bunch of different stocks that are put together. That's called an index.
523.84s: And there are things called exchange traded funds ETFs that essentially allow you to trade
530.48s: this index. So if you buy something called spy SPY, you gain exposure to all of these different
540.00s: things in that one product, which makes it very efficient, which we'll get into a little bit later.
544.80s: Now how do you do all of this? Well, you need a broker. So if we take a look now and you just
551.84s: throw into Google online brokerage, you can see all of these different brokers that pop up. If it were
558.48s: me, I would direct myself towards interactive brokers, TD Ameritrade, E-Trade, Schwab, one of those.
566.32s: I personally use TD Ameritrade and part of that is just because of luck. It is what I happened to
571.84s: pick when I started trading back in 2007. And I like them. So I stay with them. But you can pick
578.24s: any of these major brokers. I would avoid places like Robin Hood. They're not really a great broker
584.48s: specifically for active traders, for passive traders. It doesn't really matter as much. Kind of
588.80s: pick whatever makes you happy. But the broker is what gives you access to the stock market so that you
595.44s: can then start taking a look at these different things. So now let's get into kind of the rest of
601.04s: this thing. If you are going to invest, which is kind of worth thinking about holding things
605.92s: long term longer than a year, or trade, which is when we're buying and selling within a year,
612.08s: you're, I would start with buy and hold. It's the same thing for both. The reason why I would start
617.04s: with buy and hold is because if you're going to be an investor, well, this is all you're going to
622.40s: do going forward. And if you look at something like a buy and hold portfolio, this is from portfolio
628.96s: visualizer.com. If you are looking to invest, this is a great place to check out. I'm not affiliated
634.48s: with them at all. They just have a great product. So you can go to back test portfolio and you can
638.88s: change this time frame to whatever you want. You could drop in all the different symbols that you
642.72s: want to take a look at. And you can see how they perform. So what I did here is give you a few
648.24s: different things to look at. This blue line, which is portfolio two, is 50% IWM and 50% QQQ. These are
658.72s: two index ETFs. This is the Russell 2000 and this is the NASDAQ. So if you take a look at this
667.28s: and we look at the NASDAQ 100, this is QQQ. So you're gaining exposure to all of these. And when
674.48s: I'm talking about IWM, this is 2000 small cap stocks. You're gaining exposure to all of these.
681.04s: So that's one portfolio. Another idea here is 60% spy. Would you know what that is already?
688.40s: And 40% TLT, which is 20 year US government bonds. And you can take a look at what the final
694.80s: balance is between these, what the compound annual growth rate is. And if you notice, compared to
700.88s: the S&P 500 by itself, if you do something as simple as IWM and QQQ, you outperform it. Honestly,
708.80s: now you can take a look at the worst year to see if you're comfortable with the drawdown that
713.68s: you might have. The max drawdown is the lowest it gets at a certain point in time. But the cool part
718.64s: about this kind of product is you can get an idea of how different things work. And if you are a
723.04s: buy and hold investor, again, if it were me, I would literally just pick spy. And every single month
730.88s: put more money into your brokerage account so that I could buy more shares of spy. And just do
739.20s: that into perpetuity. Because if you take a look at this for the period that we're looking at,
744.40s: which is 2010 all the way through current day 2023, if you have a 12.12% compound annual growth rate,
752.88s: well, let's come back to this. Let's say let's get rid of that. And let's instead look at if we have
760.16s: that 12% compound annual growth rate and what that can do for you. Specifically, if you get more
766.64s: serious about saving, which is that thing I kind of reminded you in the beginning. So instead of
771.60s: $100, let's say you could do $500 a month. Well, now in 20 years, you essentially have half a
776.56s: million dollars that's starting with just five grand. And let's say you get better at saving or
782.00s: let's say over the time span, your average monthly contributions grows because your income is growing.
788.40s: And let's say you could do a thousand dollars, not in the beginning, but over this 20 year period
792.72s: that becomes your average. Well, now you're a millionaire done and done starting with $5,000
797.84s: at the average stock market return. That is the beauty of investing. So in this case, you can tinker
804.56s: with different things, find what you like, but this is just to give you some ideas and where you can
808.72s: start. Now for the people that are trading, it's a little bit different because investors from
814.24s: here, they just have to monitor, save, buy more on a regular cadence and rebalance if they want.
819.92s: But again, if you're just using one ticker spy, then you're done. And you might get to a point
825.44s: where you say, I want to decrease a little bit of risk. I'm getting closer to retirement. Well,
830.16s: that's pretty simple. All you do is modulate how much you're putting in bonds. So let's say you're
835.68s: getting close to retirement, you're not looking to grow your money anymore. You just kind of want
839.12s: some income and to protect your capital. Well, maybe this goes to 20% S&P 580% TLT. The point is,
846.72s: this can be modulated to whatever you need based on your needs. However, for the traders,
851.52s: this is when things start getting serious. You are going to have to create that trading plan
856.16s: that I was telling about. You are going to have to start paper trading to figure out what works for
861.12s: you. So if you are going down this trading route, this is a whole other world that I will create a
868.32s: second video for you on that dives into that specifically. But up until this point, it's the same,
874.64s: whether you're investing or trading. So I hope that this helps everybody out. If you have any
879.28s: questions, comments, concerns, drop me a line. Let me know. And don't forget a little bit of delayed
885.44s: gratification upfront can really change your life further down the line. So get consistent and
892.56s: brace the process and watch you becoming outlier. Catch you all later.
