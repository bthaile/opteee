0.00s: What's up everyone?
1.34s: Taking a quick look at the GameStop options chain
4.44s: to kick us off for this week.
5.82s: I just want to see if anything looks interesting
8.00s: over the weekend.
8.80s: If we've seen any changes in volatility,
10.52s: we'll make a quick update on what we have in terms
14.36s: of open interest, volatility, volume, those kinds of things
18.12s: so that we know what we're heading into.
19.82s: And a quick shout out to my buddy Richard,
23.66s: he and I spoke yesterday for a good part of the afternoon.
28.16s: It was like four hour conversation.
30.12s: It was so, so useful to me because as I've mentioned
33.76s: to you guys numerous times, I am a guest in this house.
37.48s: I don't have all of the background
38.96s: the history that you all do, but I am enthralled by the story.
43.28s: It's a giant puzzle that I'm enjoying interacting with
46.72s: because I've been trading options for a long time.
48.76s: I'm pretty good at that.
50.36s: And it becomes generally programmatic after a while.
53.28s: So having something pop up like this that truly is anomalous
57.68s: is been very fun for me to dig deeper into.
60.48s: I've traded GameStop before during other episodes,
63.68s: but I didn't quite get as deep into the lore.
66.20s: And Richard essentially gave me a master class.
68.96s: He took the time during his afternoon
70.80s: to share that with me.
71.64s: So I'm beyond thankful.
72.76s: I'm sure most of you already know his channel,
75.00s: but if not, you absolutely should go check it out,
77.12s: subscribe.
77.88s: He has a incredible resource on GameStop.
81.56s: He's built this giant Google sheet
83.04s: that he shares with everybody for free.
84.76s: Tons of awesome information.
86.96s: All right, where did we leave off on the 28th of June Friday?
90.96s: Well, pretty simple.
92.20s: We saw a couple interesting transactions come through.
96.04s: However, most of the larger transactions
99.64s: that took place on Friday in terms of the options markets,
103.76s: were kind of sporadic.
105.16s: We had a couple going out into five July.
108.60s: This is also five July.
109.68s: These should all be shaded the same color.
112.44s: And most of the transactions that we saw were buys,
115.52s: but nothing too large.
117.44s: We had some activity out in 12 July and then 19 July.
121.32s: 19 July is starting to get a bit more active
124.28s: with the second largest size on here,
126.76s: except for this one really interesting trade
129.20s: where it looked like somebody was establishing a position
131.60s: at the 11 calls, essentially to get assigned.
133.68s: That's what it looked like to me.
135.48s: So let's hop over to the platform to look
138.48s: at what we're seeing now.
139.96s: So right now we have about 131% IV.
144.00s: The first thing that is very anomalous to me
147.64s: is how steady this is across different cycles.
151.28s: So if we go back here, volatility kind of popped up
154.76s: a little bit, but it's still drastically suppressed
158.16s: from what we saw some time ago.
160.04s: The reason why I care so much about this,
162.28s: I had a couple people ask me why I talk
163.84s: about this part so much, is because option markets
166.52s: are very smart.
167.36s: They're actually pretty predictive.
169.28s: So what that means is there are studies
172.24s: that look at changes in both the at the money,
176.80s: call and put implied volatilities
180.24s: across different iterations
182.28s: and how predictive that is a future price movements.
185.36s: Without going all the way down the rabbit hole of the study,
188.24s: although I will happily link to a couple of them
190.36s: in the notes below for you to check out.
191.68s: As I always say, you should believe none
194.04s: of what you hear half of what you see.
195.56s: You should be able to validate most of what people say
198.36s: if you're to believe them.
199.60s: And so this is another one of those instances.
201.40s: You should absolutely check that study out.
203.20s: But when I look at the volatility here in GameStop,
206.32s: it's actually very telling to me,
208.48s: when I start to see really big call volatility,
212.36s: there's a natural tendency as we get closer to expiration
215.44s: for the really far out of the money's to drift up
217.72s: that typically won't outpace the put side.
219.80s: The put side typically will trade at a higher IV
222.28s: because the market tends to fear the downside more.
225.44s: Where to weird spot now?
227.04s: Because with this recent share offering,
228.72s: essentially the removal of debt from GameStop,
231.60s: they kind of have a capped in downside,
234.92s: even at a cash value.
237.16s: So it's still quite a bit lower technically than where it is now.
240.20s: If I'm not mistaken, it's like 13 or so per share,
243.24s: but that's still essentially a floor
245.28s: that eventually gets baked into the product.
248.00s: So that part is slightly interesting.
250.04s: There's still, again, a pretty decent amount.
252.48s: It would have to go to get there.
254.00s: So when I look at the volatility
255.52s: across these different expiration cycles,
259.00s: there's a couple of things that stick out to me.
261.16s: I'm gonna focus on the primary expiration cycles
263.32s: the 19 July and the 16 August.
265.04s: I know that this doesn't discreetly line up
268.04s: with some of the cycle theories that are going around.
271.04s: Richard and I were actually talking quite a bit
272.96s: about his most recent one, which is fascinating
276.28s: and very well informed, I believe.
279.24s: And right now, I'm just not seeing the option markets
282.88s: necessarily mirroring too much of it,
285.00s: but it could also be that it's a little too early.
287.80s: A lot of what Richard is looking at
289.08s: is kind of out more towards the beginning of August.
292.08s: And you have to get through these front expirations markets,
295.76s: options markets are very active, maybe two, three weeks out.
299.64s: And that's because most people are looking for a bunch of liquidity,
302.40s: especially for bigger positions up in the front expiration cycles.
306.28s: Now, this five July expiration is interesting
309.44s: because we have a holiday that tends to lead to muted volatility
315.00s: and that's partially why you see these two vols,
317.60s: these two expiration vols being essentially the same.
319.84s: Typically, at least as of late with GameStop,
322.60s: the front expiration has almost always been higher.
325.20s: But this flattening is going to be largely
327.72s: in part due to the holiday that's coming up
329.80s: in the market bingla.
331.64s: When I look across the open interest in the five July's,
335.88s: there's nothing too interesting here.
339.40s: Now, I know a lot of people were talking about
342.20s: in the last expiration cycle, this call wall.
346.08s: And it's okay to call it that.
347.60s: But I think people were kind of mistaken the origin of it
350.96s: before I think it was at like the 125's and the 128's.
353.96s: They were thinking that it could be like institutions,
356.64s: scaling in positions and whatnot.
358.16s: And it can be, but based on the buying activity
362.04s: that I've been seeing in these really far out of the money strikes,
366.56s: I don't actually think it's in part large from institutions,
371.76s: but a lot of retail traders.
374.00s: So if I kill this size requirement,
378.24s: and if we only want to look at the out of the money,
381.52s: let's take a look at this front series, the five July's.
385.84s: And if we want to take a look at the furthest out of the money,
389.08s: there was what, the 95's.
392.68s: So if we take a look at the 95's,
394.36s: and we're only going to allow us to look at the 95's,
396.96s: so we'll be able to see clearly the buying activity
398.92s: around the 95's.
400.36s: Let's see what we see.
401.60s: Notice the size of the vast majority of these trades.
404.56s: They're tiny, one lot, four lot, 10 lot, 15 lot, 10 lot.
408.48s: And all of these are bought when the options are trading at three cents.
412.64s: So this absolutely can be a lot of small positions
417.72s: being built by larger institutions,
420.60s: but it would still have to be much larger size than this.
424.40s: If you're an institution trying to place a larger trade,
427.72s: if you look at the largest trade on here,
430.44s: which came in at 220 lots at four bucks,
433.64s: it's less than a thousand dollar positions, $880.
437.44s: You'd essentially have to take all of this
439.48s: and it still wouldn't even be a fraction of the size needed
442.84s: for it to be like a quote unquote institutional position.
446.04s: This to me just looks like a lot of people speculating
448.68s: on far out of the money options because they're cheap
450.96s: and they're generally misguided on how these are likely
454.36s: to perform over the time frame.
455.72s: But this is just a ton of tiny little trades
459.52s: all the way out into next week, this coming Friday.
463.36s: And part of it is probably due to the cycle analysis
467.00s: that people have done and they're trying to front run the moves,
469.44s: which is again, you can choose to try to bottom ticket
472.12s: in front run the move,
473.24s: but it's difficult to make money that way.
475.44s: Now I want to take a quick look at the 19th July expiration cycle
479.84s: because this is kind of like the next main active cycle
482.76s: because it is a primary standard expiration cycle
486.92s: as I've told you guys before.
488.28s: The weeklies they will still be active
489.80s: but they won't have the same activity
491.80s: that the primary expiration which is the third Friday
494.60s: of each month and that's because people are looking
496.56s: for liquidity and there are some pretty big positions here.
499.96s: So at the 25s there's 19,000 at the 30s there's 25,000.
506.52s: At the 40s there's 19,000 and as I say those numbers
510.20s: what do you notice?
511.04s: They're all kind of like round numbers, right?
512.20s: 25, 30, 40.
514.12s: Again, most larger trades are going to be done
516.80s: at these whole strikes and that again is for liquidity.
521.28s: So let's go all the way out here.
523.24s: We have a big block at the 125s, 35k and then at the 100s,
529.48s: 21k.
530.72s: So let's take a look at these 125s in 19 July
533.64s: and see what kind of activity is going on here.
537.24s: So we need to take this up to 125
539.76s: and then we need to kill this series, go to this series.
541.92s: Let's see the size of these trades.
543.92s: The biggest one was 95.
546.80s: So again, just taking a quick look at the total value
550.24s: of that trade, 95 times 28 bucks, it's 2660,
555.60s: the small position, it's a $2,000 trade.
557.92s: That's the biggest one.
559.28s: If we go through and scroll down through these
561.88s: to take a look at what the general sizes of these trades.
564.32s: I see some 40s, some double digits.
566.52s: The vast majority I'm seeing are singles, triples doubles.
570.04s: That's what's jumping out to my eyes so far.
572.76s: And as I go through this, again, I see some tens,
575.52s: but still very small positions.
576.96s: These are at 20 cents.
578.60s: So what I'm highlighting is really the same thing
581.28s: I'm seeing in the near term expiration cycle
583.68s: of five to lies.
584.52s: This just looks like a lot of people putting on very small,
587.72s: highly speculative trades, hoping something hits.
591.00s: These are very small trades.
592.36s: So that doesn't mean that there's nobody large lurking.
595.60s: That's actually one of the biggest things
597.12s: that I'm keeping an eyeball on to see when we do see
600.24s: some serious buying activity.
601.96s: I have all different kinds of scans that start kicking off.
604.40s: As soon as that happens, that's how I got alerted to Chewie
606.52s: last week.
607.04s: That's how I got alerted to GameStop in the beginning.
609.08s: Because I'm very interested in catching this stuff
611.44s: as it's going off.
612.28s: Because again, from me, primarily an option
614.04s: tradingers world, I'm just looking to make money on movement.
617.56s: I don't really care if it's up down sideways.
619.28s: I need movement in some capacity.
621.80s: So that's how I keep an eyeball out for these kinds of things.
624.36s: So more to come this week as we get through another shout out
628.24s: to Richard.
628.76s: I'm hoping that he and I can connect again.
630.36s: We're going to talk about maybe due to some sort of live stream.
633.60s: Because I feel like I have so many beginner questions
636.56s: that might be useful for other people's context.
639.16s: Kind of looking at the world of GME through beginners' eyes.
642.28s: And then I hopefully can help color
644.28s: in some lines around the option space, how we can use this.
648.24s: Because I do think that there's a piece here
650.32s: that we can use this for options, predictive capabilities,
653.20s: to kind of key off when the market starts
655.28s: suspecting a move.
656.56s: Might be a little bit late, but we'll have to see I'm doing
659.12s: a bunch of testing right now on that.
661.88s: So as always, any questions?
664.00s: Let me know, be an outlier.
665.28s: I'll see you guys later.
