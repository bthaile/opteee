660.00s: in
662.00s: the
684.00s: or a specific term doesn't matter.
687.78s: Just the functional difference between open interest,
692.72s: aka, oh, I, and volume.
697.04s: Feel free to throw your answer in the chat.
699.12s: We'll take a look, see what you think,
702.64s: the correct response is.
703.80s: I imagine most of you will be familiar with it.
707.32s: H says, oh, I's the total number of open contracts.
711.08s: Volume number traded hands today.
713.20s: Yeah, I think that's good.
714.80s: I think that's a good overview.
716.20s: Now, a couple other notes to build on to that.
720.72s: Ports says liquidity, it's not liquidity.
724.16s: It can definitely represent a level of liquidity,
728.36s: but open interest simply represents the number
733.04s: of existing contracts.
735.32s: So if we take a look at spy and we take a look at
739.84s: the options chain.
742.04s: And we go all the way down here to the bottom.
745.20s: You'll see that there's open interest.
747.96s: And that looks exceedingly low.
750.80s: I do not believe that that's correct.
753.72s: That seems much more correct.
756.72s: So the open interest right now for spy on the call side
760.56s: is 6.5 million.
762.44s: And on the put side, it's 11.9 million.
765.52s: Those are the number of contracts that exist today
771.12s: and currently are open,
773.12s: meaning there are two parties to that trade
776.68s: that are choosing to maintain their position.
779.96s: Now, volume represents the number of contracts traded.
786.48s: And we can look at volume over different time frames.
788.60s: We can look at volume today.
789.96s: We look at option volume over a rolling five day period
793.04s: to assess if something's becoming more active
795.08s: and so on and so forth.
796.60s: Volume doesn't differentiate whether or not
800.24s: it's an opening or closing position.
802.36s: So of this 5.8 million calls that were traded today,
805.52s: we do not yet know how many of those are opening positions
808.92s: versus closing position.
810.64s: We will see that reflected tomorrow.
814.56s: Open interest updates overnight.
818.28s: And then the next day, it will not change all day.
821.44s: Open interest will be whatever it is all day,
823.64s: regardless of how much volume there is.
825.84s: And then once we see where that volume goes
828.32s: throughout the day, then the next day.
830.20s: It will update.
831.36s: So open interest essentially updates overnight.
834.80s: And then it's static during the day.
836.44s: Volume is essentially the inverse.
838.28s: It's going to move all day as people are trading,
840.72s: but then overnight there's not going to be volume.
842.84s: It's going to zero out and then it'll open back up the next day.
846.40s: The reason why we need to know the difference
848.04s: between these two things is because they mean different things
850.68s: and the way that we might use them for information,
853.84s: rocker is different.
855.68s: Next question.
856.84s: How can we use volume over OI?
863.04s: So this essentially creates a ratio.
866.48s: And for those that are a little more visual
872.00s: while you're answering that, I'll show you right now.
875.68s: We'll go into a specific option,
877.40s: change is to I'm going to go further out in time
879.56s: because it'll be lighter, it won't be as much.
882.32s: It'll be easier to show you.
887.32s: Let's do this one.
888.24s: I think this is a good example.
890.48s: So in this option chain and for this option specific,
898.00s: let me, oops, let me click it so that you could see
901.20s: the one I'm looking at.
902.40s: We are eyeballing this bad boy.
906.24s: And then I think yellow will be visible.
910.36s: So let's take a look.
911.80s: So we can see that the volume right now is 317 volume.
917.84s: Open interest currently is 159.
925.04s: So we can create a ratio.
927.04s: We can say volume over open interest.
934.92s: So in this case, it'd be 317 divided by 159.
939.04s: And then this equals around two,
943.96s: which is what this is tracking.
946.20s: Does the math for me?
947.64s: Because math for Marines, we're dumb.
952.88s: Now what this can be used for is, let's see,
957.00s: Reese says, how do you check weekly volume?
959.44s: I always looked at daily.
960.64s: I'll get to that in a second.
962.72s: Each says to show how much activity is happening
965.76s: in the period versus the total activity
968.32s: in a contract has traded.
969.44s: That's correct.
970.56s: So expand on that a little bit more.
972.88s: So it's assessing the recent activity
976.68s: compared to the existing proceeding activity
980.16s: completely correct.
981.64s: Now take that one step further.
983.92s: How do we use that information?
992.64s: And then in the meantime for Reese,
994.92s: you essentially can either track it yourself
997.96s: or you have to find a data source.
1000.16s: So a platform like Thinkorswim,
1002.08s: I don't think it actually is in this platform,
1005.52s: but platforms like bar chart, unusual whales.
1009.20s: Again, as you guys know, I'm affiliate for both of those.
1011.36s: They do have that information.
1013.48s: And you can also track it for yourself.
1015.32s: O rats will also have it.
1017.72s: So Ben says estimate, oh, I, nope, that's not it.
1024.32s: Good guess.
1026.48s: Let me phrase it to you this way.
1029.36s: Let's say that we're looking at a toy.
1035.20s: Let's just, let's look at a toy, whatever the toy is.
1041.08s: And let's say that you're in the field of flipping toys.
1045.24s: You try to find toys that are cheaper
1047.36s: and then sell them when they're more expensive.
1049.92s: So let's say that there's this toy right here,
1053.00s: which I call it stickman.
1055.92s: And stickman historically, shockingly,
1060.32s: really not that popular.
1061.88s: The current open interest on the number of stickmen
1065.36s: that have been purchased has been five.
1068.88s: And then stickman starts doing marketing.
1071.96s: They're doing a limited production run,
1074.04s: so on and so forth.
1075.36s: And then all of a sudden in an individual day,
1077.44s: we see volume for stickman go to 100.
1082.36s: So if we have 100 volume over the existing open interest
1088.84s: of five, you can do the math here.
1091.76s: But this tells us something very interesting is going on.
1096.76s: It tells us that the preceding interest in stickman
1100.56s: was five, five interest units.
1103.96s: Then all of a sudden there's 100 interest units in stickman.
1109.24s: Why would there be so many new interest units in stickman
1115.00s: could be for a lot of different reasons.
1117.68s: But it tells us something very, very specific.
1120.76s: Supply and demand relationship is changing a little bit
1123.16s: and demand for this specific thing is much higher.
1127.64s: This is how we use volume over OI as option traders.
1132.28s: Just sub out this very cool stickman
1136.92s: and think of it in terms of an individual option.
1140.24s: Now the stickman example is obviously simplified.
1144.56s: We're effectively saying the reason why
1147.56s: people might be growing interest in stickman,
1149.96s: it is very simple.
1151.20s: It simply means more people want this toy
1153.20s: for either they want to bid it up and then sell it.
1157.56s: They want to keep it as a collector's item, whatever.
1159.88s: There's not that many reasons why ultimately
1163.28s: people want an increase in stickman.
1165.04s: You can break down that demand pretty easily.
1167.56s: It might just be a really hot toy for this Christmas.
1171.20s: Whereas options sticking with the standard team,
1175.00s: very complex.
1176.00s: There can be a lot of different reasons.
1178.56s: Why there's more interest in this specific options contract
1184.52s: versus other options contracts.
1187.28s: But what I can tell you is that if I clear this stuff
1190.40s: out of the way, notice the color of this column, right?
1194.84s: I made this thing script to make it easy to eyeball stuff
1200.04s: here.
1201.28s: And then I'm just gonna click down here
1203.24s: so that it doesn't shade otherwise.
1206.84s: And then notice right here.
1216.08s: There is interest in these two options,
1219.28s: the seven thirties and the seven thirties fives.
1222.40s: There's abnormal interest in these options.
1225.84s: Now you have to understand the relative component of options.
1233.16s: Because in this case, for this example,
1236.72s: there's obviously elevated interest in these options.
1240.40s: But for something like spy, this really isn't much, right?
1244.20s: We're talking 300 here, 1,300 here.
1246.96s: The total dollar value of that interest,
1249.04s: quote unquote is not very high.
1250.80s: So this isn't anything that I would think very much about.
1253.76s: But this idea becomes much more interesting
1256.00s: as you're trading other kinds of names
1258.28s: that show anomalous behavior.
1260.28s: I actually gave a couple examples of this recently with VIX.
1263.76s: And it's honestly one of the reasons
1266.64s: why I was so well positioned for these drops
1270.12s: is because the VIX had very unusual options
1275.48s: trading behavior leading into the drop.
1279.68s: So that is why volume over OI is of interest to you.
1285.64s: It's a very usable tool.
1287.64s: Okay, so that's your quiz.
1288.92s: Let's jump into obviously quick recap now.
1292.52s: We talked about how to use the Greeks to build trades
1296.92s: and where to find the Greeks.
1298.04s: Again, the last session was about navigating the options change.
1301.24s: So this is essentially how we visualize the Greeks
1304.64s: for different options to come up with ideas
1307.56s: on how we can conceivably create a trade
1310.52s: that reflects our ideas.
1313.48s: The other things that we discuss are how to analyze
1317.12s: in options change because there's a lot of data.
1320.04s: I gave you just one example right now of volume over OI.
1324.40s: But we talked about also how to glean information
1327.36s: from volatility, from volume behavior, from term structure,
1332.16s: from call put differences, both in terms of volatility,
1336.20s: but then also in terms of overall volume.
1339.28s: We talked about how to detect if options are being bought
1343.56s: or sold.
1345.16s: All of these tools amplify the total amount of information
1349.72s: you have at your disposal to make better trading decisions.
1353.36s: And all of that is literally captured in the options chain.
1359.32s: It's super cool.
1360.20s: It's like a one stop shop for tons of information.
1363.60s: OK, so now recap complete.
1368.08s: We get into the session for today.
1370.28s: And the session for today is all about how to build a trade.
1375.88s: Now for this, there are two reference videos,
1381.20s: which I honestly imagine most of you, I hope,
1384.92s: have seen these videos.
1386.44s: If not, then actually a lot of this
1389.20s: is going to be a little bit difficult to follow
1391.80s: because I don't intend to go through these videos
1396.24s: in crazy depth, again, because they're already here in videos.
1400.40s: But there's the first one.
1402.08s: That's the outlier strategy process.
1404.96s: And then here's the second one, which is the outlier trade
1407.84s: process.
1408.36s: And again, I call it those names just because it's
1411.44s: way I think about it.
1412.96s: But this isn't necessarily the way to do things.
1417.52s: This is a way to do things.
1420.88s: But one of the most important things to keep in mind
1423.44s: and I want to emphasize a term that you see on your screen here,
1427.84s: repeatable.
1429.40s: This term here is super important.
1433.68s: Why do I emphasize the point of repeatable so much?
1440.68s: Why am I asking you this question?
1443.20s: If you know why I care so much about a repeatable process,
1448.92s: throw it in the chat.
1450.20s: And the reason why we need to take a minute to discuss this
1452.48s: is because this effectively, I level,
1456.96s: will be the total representation of your capacity as a trader
1463.04s: is how well you can execute a repeatable task.
1467.88s: So why is repeatable so important?
1470.56s: Why does that matter?
1475.28s: Ben says it's hard to collect clean data
1478.08s: when your input is random.
1479.56s: Good, go further.
1480.80s: That's exactly correct.
1482.72s: H says to make a system that's profitable rather than getting
1485.68s: lucky and then ultimately getting right at some point.
1488.76s: Bingo.
1489.72s: Honestly between Ben and H, those responses in line
1493.72s: exactly as they're written is the reason.
1496.52s: It's because when we're trading options,
1500.76s: we're already trading.
1502.48s: Think of it this way.
1503.36s: If you think of the stock market, the stock market as a whole
1508.44s: is wildly complex.
1511.28s: This is about the most simplified version of the stock market
1517.28s: that I could possibly create to even give you a glimpse
1521.28s: of what is in here.
1524.24s: This doesn't even go into, there's a whole other bucket over here
1527.32s: that I didn't add because this was originally a one-on-ones
1530.96s: version and I didn't want to overwhelm people.
1533.68s: But effectively, I don't know why I can't.
1538.88s: Thank you.
1540.12s: Effectively, I will add another one here
1542.64s: that a lot of you might not even be familiar with.
1547.40s: Xotics.
1548.56s: These are not things like you're used to seeing.
1553.80s: So these can be things like custom swaps.
1558.48s: This can be
1561.92s: Bermudian options.
1569.28s: I'm just gonna put Bermuda up.
1570.88s: Damn it.
1572.16s: It's just a little...
1576.48s: My OC will literally not allow that to happen.
1579.16s: So we'll have to do exotic options.
1583.00s: We'll have to use the same term twice,
1584.32s: which is awful to do, but it's a necessary evil.
1588.20s: But there is this exact thing where the market itself
1593.28s: is very, very complex.
1596.04s: It is nowhere near as simple as people tend to think it is
1600.20s: and that's because we tend to think it's so simple
1603.16s: because Robinhood wants to make it seem that way,
1607.44s: to get you to trade because it's how they make money.
1611.56s: But if you as the trader are interfacing
1615.48s: with this really complex place,
1617.80s: there's a bunch of different exchanges,
1619.48s: a bunch of different participants trying to do all sorts
1622.24s: of different things, trading these different kinds
1624.28s: of securities with different timeframes,
1627.16s: that all of these things are essentially big information
1632.80s: in gestion sources for quite literally the world around you.
1639.28s: The conversations between Trump and China
1642.08s: regarding the tariffs will impact the market.
1645.04s: The conversations between Putin and Ukraine, Zelensky,
1650.24s: will impact the market and so on and so forth.
1653.64s: So if we go back to the purpose behind this concept
1657.12s: of repeatable, it's because the system
1660.84s: that you're interfacing with naturally is exceedingly complex.
1665.48s: If you as a trader cannot differentiate
1670.48s: between the output of your system deriving from luck
1675.12s: or path versus the actual performance of the system
1680.64s: and you as a trader sooner or later, it will show you.
1685.48s: And this is the exactly funny enough,
1688.80s: I wasn't expecting to use it for this example,
1691.40s: but this is exactly why if you scroll through Reddit today,
1695.64s: you are going to see a ton of these lost it all
1703.24s: down over 8K trading options on this.
1709.24s: If you literally just, they got assigned target calls early,
1714.88s: it looked like they actually did okay,
1716.84s: but this person lost 80K in the stock market, right?
1720.32s: Like the point that I'm making is right now,
1725.20s: they learn their lesson today.
1728.44s: Right now there are droves of people
1732.00s: that are getting humbled by the market.
1734.56s: And it's because the market is finally showing
1737.84s: another phase that people are not used to seeing.
1741.72s: If we look at the total market performance
1744.04s: and the market in general, it does absolutely tend to go up.
1749.04s: I zoom this out far enough.
1752.32s: You'll see that reflected, it tends to go up.
1755.68s: But there are nasty periods where it can go down pretty
1760.24s: aggressively.
1761.52s: This is the COVID drop.
1763.80s: This is the bear market that we had in 22
1766.36s: with a market was down about 19.4% over the year.
1769.76s: These aren't even really the quote unquote very ugly parts.
1774.00s: The real ugly parts are back here in 2008, 2009.
1778.16s: Then we have to go back way further into the 1930s
1782.16s: before this was around.
1784.44s: But there are plenty of periods where the market is shown
1787.20s: really, really rough times.
1789.80s: And this is also why a lot of traders gets really confused
1794.48s: between how well things are working versus the reality
1798.72s: of markets.
1799.84s: I had somebody that was on a coaching call with,
1803.00s: just walking through their process and their approach.
1804.92s: And they were talking about how they were crushing
1808.00s: rating zero DTE options.
1809.52s: And I'll show you exactly what they're doing.
1811.80s: Because to no surprise, it didn't work that well for too long.
1819.36s: So effectively what they're doing is,
1822.00s: I'm going to use the three DTE options just because the zero DTEs
1825.64s: are going to have absolutely nothing right,
1827.44s: because it's after the close.
1828.96s: But I want you to see the general construct.
1832.24s: So effectively, what this person was doing is saying,
1836.52s: where do I think SPX is just overwhelmingly likely not going
1843.04s: to go?
1844.40s: And they would go all the way out here to what we refer to as
1848.68s: the tails.
1850.08s: You come all the way out here to a four Delta option,
1852.88s: a two Delta option.
1855.00s: If you take a look at the probability of a two Delta option,
1857.60s: or in this case a three Delta option being in the money
1859.92s: at expiration, it is 3.2%.
1863.48s: If you take a look at the probability of a touch,
1865.36s: it is 6.3%.
1867.76s: That is a exceedingly low probability of occurring.
1872.64s: What was happening is that they had a massive string
1877.12s: of winning traits, as you would expect.
1880.40s: Most of these traits worked.
1882.28s: And it's because the probability favors it.
1885.68s: The issue was over the course of two days,
1889.20s: they gave back effectively all that they made over about six
1893.64s: months.
1896.40s: This is the misunderstanding of how to build a trade that's
1902.16s: based on a sound approach.
1904.24s: So let's now talk about that.
1907.64s: In order to even begin this process,
1910.80s: we have to understand what we are trying to do as a trader.
1915.84s: And in the options trading world, in my opinion,
1920.32s: it starts with this.
1924.08s: It starts with creating an approach.
1928.68s: So this is the construct I give you to give you some structure
1933.72s: around how to create your own trading approach.
1936.00s: And again, I fully encourage you to rip this
1939.08s: and then turn it into your own version.
1941.08s: Do what works for you.
1942.60s: This is what works for me.
1944.76s: The way that I approach the markets
1947.12s: is by first analyzing market effects.
1952.76s: I refer to them as profit mechanisms.
1955.64s: These market effects profit mechanisms
1959.52s: are the underlying method in which we attempt to make money.
1965.36s: This sounds so simple when you break it down this way.
1968.52s: But if I go through most of the people
1972.72s: and just in the discord that pop on the live streams that
1976.00s: are even just in my broader viewership,
1978.32s: if I go through most people and I say, show me your last 10
1981.64s: trades and we look at those trades together,
1984.60s: I can literally guarantee you I will find the overwhelming
1989.40s: majority will have trades that are sub optimally structured
1994.68s: against what they are attempting to trade.
1999.00s: Why would that be?
2000.92s: It's because we're not starting from this step.
2005.48s: What most traders mistakenly do is they start
2010.88s: by putting the cart so far in front of the horse
2014.40s: you cannot even see it.
2017.92s: What most traders do is literally not bother with any of this,
2024.12s: completely skip this entire stage.
2027.60s: And instead they jump straight into the second part
2031.24s: of this broader process.
2032.96s: And specifically this step right here.
2038.08s: If we talk to most options traders,
2041.84s: this is literally the only thing they're doing.
2046.16s: The only thing they're doing.
2049.64s: So my goal for you all today is to understand
2053.76s: the importance of this step.
2057.44s: And then how once this step is built, how it simplifies
2063.88s: this process so much, the reality for you as a trader,
2070.36s: and I can unequivocally tell you this has been my experience.
2074.36s: The process of actually trading is mind numbingly easy.
2081.36s: It's mind numbingly easy.
2083.92s: There's effectively very little thought
2086.24s: that has to go into things.
2088.60s: And that's the process of actually clicking the buttons.
2091.48s: It's so easy.
2094.00s: And this is the funny part when most people say,
2096.12s: well, how much time do you actually spend trading?
2099.44s: And it's so small.
2101.84s: Well, that too.
2102.68s: But it's such an insignificant amount of time.
2106.84s: And the reason why is because all the work is done
2110.04s: before you ever place a trade.
2111.80s: So when we're talking about this idea of building a trade,
2116.32s: the entire premise is that we have to start
2121.40s: by doing all of this work.
2124.96s: Otherwise your trade, whatever you're doing,
2129.20s: is going to fail.
2131.36s: That is the reality you have to accept.
2135.24s: If you don't like that, too fucking bad.
2140.20s: What we want, what we prefer,
2142.04s: what would be easier for us,
2143.92s: doesn't matter in the least.
2146.08s: What matters is what can we perform in the long run
2150.68s: as a trader?
2152.04s: So looking at this entire thing,
2155.12s: I'm gonna breeze through this.
2157.00s: But first thing I wanna open up a poll,
2160.84s: and I'm actually genuinely very curious
2163.20s: in your response here.
2166.00s: Let's take a look at spy.
2168.40s: Actually, I'm not gonna do a poll
2169.92s: because I wanna ask a few questions back to back.
2173.40s: But there will be short answers.
2175.68s: So you should be able to run through them really quick.
2177.92s: Let me pop the door for Thor real fast.
2188.00s: About time for him to get his grow on.
2192.84s: So the first question,
2195.52s: if you wanted to trade spy right now,
2200.76s: let's say you had to put on a trade and spy right now,
2204.60s: are you gonna trade it up or are you gonna trade it down?
2208.72s: Just literally right up or down.
2211.16s: We're gonna start with good old up or down analysis.
2216.00s: And you'll see where I'm gonna go with this in a second.
2218.36s: Alberto says down, let's see what else we got.
2222.08s: Ben also says down, who else?
2225.64s: Who else's brave to figure out how they wanna trade,
2230.36s: spy as it sits today?
2233.88s: Haters says down, each says up,
2237.08s: Reese says no sideways, that's correct, no sideways,
2239.36s: up or down, those are the two choices in this scenario.
2246.84s: Down, okay, next question.
2251.88s: And I'm specifically interested in the people
2254.52s: that answered the first question.
2257.52s: What timeframe would you want to trade it up or down?
2262.52s: Would you trade it for a day, five days, 10 days, a month?
2270.32s: This is in the context of whatever direction you chose,
2276.84s: to pick.
2279.84s: So for this answer, you literally can just say X days,
2284.56s: X week, X months, whatever.
2288.60s: What duration?
2293.52s: Reese says five to 14.
2295.32s: Alberto says two weeks to a month.
2298.60s: Age says one to five, Ben says one.
2301.80s: Hey, there, you answered in the last one, where you at?
2311.68s: Few weeks, okay?
2314.48s: One month from Paulo, okay?
2318.16s: Jamie, what about you?
2321.48s: Jammigard jumping in, down two to three months,
2326.32s: Jamie says two weeks, okay.
2328.88s: So far, what do we notice?
2332.72s: We notice that every single one of us looking at the same thing,
2336.52s: even though there's overlapping ideas in terms of direction.
2340.56s: A lot of people said down, still some said up.
2343.68s: But then as soon as we add another layer of duration,
2347.44s: there's some overlap, but there's also more different answers.
2353.04s: So far, right?
2356.56s: Next question.
2359.28s: This is, again, agnostic to what days to expiration you would pick.
2366.40s: I simply want to know what kind of option would you trade?
2371.80s: Would you buy or sell calls or puts?
2377.36s: Don't worry about strike.
2378.56s: Don't worry about any of the Greeks.
2380.16s: Don't worry about what expiration, just based on your idea
2384.72s: and your timeframe.
2386.64s: Would you buy or sell calls or puts?
2392.40s: So there's two parts to your response by yourself.
2396.08s: All's or puts.
2397.52s: What is it for you guys?
2402.00s: I see buy put.
2403.68s: I see sell calls for Reese Hader.
2407.12s: What else for the rest of you guys?
2408.56s: Alberto H. Pollo.
2416.40s: Ben would buy a put.
2419.92s: Alberto would sell puts.
2421.52s: H would go with a long call spread.
2424.72s: Jamie would go along some puts.
2428.32s: Okay.
2430.16s: One more question.
2433.04s: Now, don't worry about picking a specific expert.
2437.68s: I want you to pick days to expiration.
2441.20s: So whatever you selected for buying or selling,
2444.96s: again, you don't have to pick the actual expiration.
2448.48s: But what duration would you target for your trade
2452.72s: buying or selling the calls or puts?
2459.20s: Ben goes zero DTE.
2461.92s: Reese says 50.
2463.76s: Alberto says 45 to 60.
2472.64s: Pollo is behind.
2479.04s: Hader says 20 to 30 days.
2482.16s: Okay.
2483.52s: So now, if we were to create a mapping for each trader,
2489.44s: each of these questions that I've asked,
2492.48s: there was some overlap, right?
2494.96s: A lot of people said down, for example.
2498.00s: But if we were to overlap the details of each response
2502.88s: and map them and create a counter for the frequency
2507.44s: that we select the same thing, it would be zero.
2513.52s: We have the direction.
2516.08s: We have the type of timeframe.
2520.32s: We would want to trade the idea.
2523.12s: We have whether we would buy or sell calls or puts.
2526.48s: We have the days to expiration.
2528.80s: We would target for those calls or puts.
2532.64s: So far, we have already introduced a series of literally
2539.04s: the vital variables that will be the difference between
2543.04s: making money or losing money.
2545.20s: A great example of this that sticks out to me is Ben's trade.
2550.32s: Ben is talking about buying puts that are zero DTE.
2555.68s: What I can tell you is that depending on what the market does,
2560.72s: there is a really good chance those will lose money.
2563.76s: Now, whether or not they will lose money in the long run,
2568.32s: that depends on the strategy.
2571.20s: So now, let's go back and recenter ourselves on this idea
2577.68s: of the outlier strategy process.
2579.52s: And again, just a general trading process.
2582.00s: It doesn't have to be this.
2582.88s: It could be whatever you want.
2585.60s: The point I'm making here is that based on all of those different ideas
2590.16s: that we just discussed as a group for that series of people,
2595.52s: the way that we would want to build
2598.48s: in optimal position is completely different.
2602.00s: And the only way we can figure out what the optimal idea is
2607.52s: is by studying things.
2609.36s: So let's pick one.
2610.56s: Let's use one as an example.
2612.64s: And let's start by applying the outlier strategy process
2616.88s: at a very high level.
2617.92s: So I'm actually going to use Ben.
2620.24s: One, because Ben has been helping us out in the discord
2623.92s: with the question of the day prepping.
2626.48s: And also, I think Ben's trade is an interesting one.
2631.76s: So if I go through the chat really quick,
2637.04s: and I'm just going to compile Ben's answers.
2641.60s: So we have down, we have a one-day idea,
2650.88s: we have buying a put,
2654.72s: and we have zero DTE for Ben.
2661.60s: So those are the compilation to the questions I asked,
2669.92s: direction, the duration of his idea,
2673.04s: what the trade would be, and then the duration for the trade.
2678.08s: So let's think about how we would build a trade
2683.20s: around this idea.
2684.88s: And I'm using this obviously as an example,
2687.52s: and I will show you how to apply this process
2690.48s: for the first time in profit mechanism.
2692.96s: In this example, we're using direction.
2697.68s: And in this case, we're the direction
2702.24s: is going to be to the downside.
2705.20s: The type, we will have to see in a second
2708.64s: what we want to qualify it as.
2710.64s: But for a zero DTE style trade and something like this,
2715.04s: this is going to be primarily flow and sentiment-driven.
2723.20s: Meaning, short-term inclusion of information is really what's going to drive
2726.88s: markets in such a short-term timeframe.
2729.76s: Now, we already have now the profit mechanism defined.
2736.16s: Now we need to think about some signals
2739.04s: that help us identify this profit mechanism.
2742.16s: So if we were to just spitball some ideas
2747.36s: with respect to signals that are going to be relevant here,
2751.44s: there are things like a V-Wap.
2755.12s: There are things like volume,
2758.72s: support and resistance.
2760.80s: And again, this is all for a very short-term timeframe.
2764.24s: We need to figure out a couple questions.
2766.80s: We need to know what the robustness is of this zero DTE directional idea.
2776.32s: So we need to do a robustness check.
2778.88s: And I'll show you some different ways you can go about this.
2783.52s: We also need to qualify
2787.76s: and quantify
2792.48s: the effect.
2796.72s: So something we can use for this, super simple.
2801.52s: We can look at average volume.
2806.64s: We can use the opening range breakout.
2809.44s: Essentially, what does the first 15 minutes of the day look like?
2814.72s: We can look at ATR.
2819.68s: And more specifically for this case, ADR.
2823.76s: We can look at price relative to V-Wap.
2830.16s: So on and so forth.
2831.36s: What I'm doing is I'm saying, okay,
2834.56s: if my idea here is to trade something, short-term timeframe,
2840.08s: and I'm trying to figure out if there's some sort of trend I can identify
2845.12s: with respect to the price movements of something in a very short-term timeframe.
2851.44s: So I'm thinking of different signals I can use to help me
2858.40s: spot trend in a short-term timeframe.
2861.44s: And then I'm also trying to figure out ways to help me figure out
2866.96s: what ultimately will make the most sense.
2869.36s: Now, what most traders would instead do is they would say,
2874.24s: I think it's going to go down and then they would buy a random put.
2878.72s: More often than not, they would pick the put at the price that they think it might hit,
2886.48s: which is almost always the wrong answer.
2888.72s: But that's what most would do.
2891.20s: Instead, we are going to apply a little bit of analysis instead.
2897.04s: Now, the next step that I typically would follow,
2901.12s: that explore this idea,
2903.68s: is that I would come to a spot, well, first, I would start with even something simpler,
2909.76s: the eyeball test. I call it the eyeball test because it takes exactly very little effort.
2916.00s: And it's to help me just, like, just look, literally just look and see what kind of sticks out to you.
2924.24s: And a couple things really stick out to me right from the jump.
2928.56s: The first thing is, in a longer term time frame, it's definitely uptrending.
2935.44s: As I look at the distribution of candles between green and red update versus down day,
2942.56s: I can see that it's sporadic and then also streaky.
2947.12s: So that's an idea that I might want to explore.
2950.88s: Meaning, is there some sort of concept or probability I can attempt to trade,
2956.96s: if the underlying is up two days in a row?
2960.80s: So one of the things I would do is start writing these ideas down.
2973.20s: Ideas. So the first thing can be next day, persistence,
2986.88s: based on prior day, friend, and then I would just slowly explore this idea.
3004.56s: Another key part of this process is if we're thinking about buying puts,
3010.08s: we know we're in a race against time.
3013.04s: And we also know that depending on what kind of price movement we want,
3021.68s: the type of put we would buy looks different.
3026.24s: So to illustrate this point, let's zoom into six month daily.
3032.16s: And I'm going to go back in time.
3033.68s: I'm going to take us to the third of March.
3036.56s: And I want to look at an example with you.
3038.40s: I think they should let us go to March three.
3039.92s: Yeah, perfect.
3041.68s: And we'll go towards the beginning of the day.
3044.16s: We'll start at a zero seven 45.
3046.32s: We'll see what the candle looks like there.
3048.08s: Yeah, this looks okay.
3049.68s: I'm just going to give you an example.
3051.92s: Now, we already know this is a down day.
3056.48s: I'm giving you, we already know the direction.
3060.08s: So now Ben, this is a specific question for you.
3063.28s: What what zero DTE put trade am I doing?
3069.36s: And I just also want to let Ben off the hook in the sense that Ben never said that this is
3075.12s: what he would do. Ben is literally just answering the binary questions effectively.
3081.84s: I gave him.
3083.20s: So I don't want the perception of like this is Ben's idea and we're debunking it or exploring
3088.80s: it. That's not it at all. We're literally just using it as a case study for the example here.
3095.04s: So Ben, we know that for the example, we're going to trade zero DTE options.
3101.60s: And we're just picking a day that we know it goes down.
3105.60s: So we know that we're going to trade some puts.
3108.56s: So what what now?
3113.68s: Which one do we pick?
3114.80s: You let me know as you look at this and then I'm going to grab a drink. I'll be right back.
3174.80s: Sadly out of the mango orange and we are on to lime, which will make work. We can get we can
3181.52s: get by with some lime. Ben says I'm cheap. I don't want to pay. Wait, I don't want to min payment
3190.24s: for puts you 30 cents, I guess. Okay. So let's find 30 cents. 30 cents is right here. So we're
3197.92s: buying a two delta and it's going to be 32 cents. So this is one trade. I'm going to throw it
3205.76s: in the analyzed tab so that we can track these different ideas. You don't have to worry about what
3210.00s: the graph looks like. I just want to track the numbers so that we don't forget them.
3215.76s: So there's that one. Now let's take a look at a couple other ideas. Let's say maybe we grab something
3221.52s: that's like 50 delta and I accidentally bought it. I meant to or accidentally sold this one.
3227.36s: I got to buy this one. And I'm not worrying about cost yet. I'm literally just putting on
3235.12s: single lots because I just want to compare relative movements. And then let's say that we want to
3240.56s: get something that's super far in the money so that we're paying very little extrinsic values.
3245.44s: So maybe something like this, the 60 20s. And then let's say following Ben's idea, we want to go,
3256.08s: I think he did it to delta. So maybe we'll go out of the money but we'll pick something that's
3261.12s: you know, a more common tail trade, which is like a five delta. So what I did is I literally have
3268.32s: just grabbed a handful. And the oh, that line is very good. And the goal here is I just want to
3280.48s: help us come up with an understanding of the movements. Now let's go towards the end of the day.
3288.48s: Mark it will close. Let's go to 1245 and we'll say that we want to clean clean our trades out.
3295.84s: Big down move. And rather than writing all of this out in my terrible handwriting, I will grab
3305.12s: an Excel sheet so that we can explore the idea together. Now let's get rid of all this stuff.
3313.68s: Okay, and then I need to get my little tablet out the way.
3319.20s: So let's start here. So we have what's the easiest way to differentiate here.
3332.16s: We're all the same DTE. So I'm not going to bother inputting this. I'm just going to put
3336.16s: strike, delta, and then premium.
3351.60s: And then we will look at exit premium. And then over here we'll calculate cost.
3358.56s: Then we'll calculate, you know, and then we'll calculate row.
3373.12s: This is freezing up to. How do we? There we go.
3382.24s: The game of these windows freezing is really annoying because in order to unfreeze that I literally
3388.32s: have to click in random windows. Sometimes it's OBS. Sometimes it's the other browser window.
3392.72s: I haven't figured out the pattern. So it's like super random. But let's just fill this in super fast.
3400.32s: So we have the 5830s. We have the 5950s. We have the 62, no, 6020s.
3415.84s: And then we have the 5870s.
3420.64s: And then I'm going to rewind us again really fast to 07 so that we can get the details from the beginning.
3431.12s: Back up. Just remember what the
3434.80s: belt was aware for all of them. And then we'll also get the
3444.40s: price, stock price. So what I'm showing you is literally a simple process that you can do
3452.88s: yourself to even get a general idea of how we answer the question of what options make the most
3461.52s: of them. And this is before we build a trade. This is the process of researching the structures.
3467.68s: So if we go back for reference quickly, we're in this stage right here. We're outlining
3476.24s: fitting structures. We're just eyeballing and testing some very basic ideas to see what might work.
3492.64s: Okay, so right now in the example, SP500 is at 582163.
3498.96s: No, it's still uploading.
3505.28s: Oh man, you could do it.
3510.48s: Right now it still shows it as buffering.
3517.68s: Let's see.
3519.12s: 50.
3527.36s: 50.
3530.40s: Yeah, this is supposed to move.
3535.52s: Dude, what is
3537.20s: this?
3542.16s: We'll give this another couple seconds. And then if it
3545.44s: dies on us, I will just guess.
3549.28s: And the reason why I'm clicking all these random windows is because I don't know what's causing it to freeze right now.
3567.76s: Hmm, okay, last attempt will go out of on demand and then back in.
3576.08s: Oh, it's like completely disconnected. Am I still on, yeah, it looks like I'm still on.
3583.76s: Oh, weird.
3588.24s: It's showing thinkorswim is completely disconnected.
3591.44s: Okay, well, I will simulate.
3599.20s: And really the main thing I want to show you is pretty simple.
3603.12s: So if we let's, let's frozen.
3610.24s: 50.30. I just want to organize these.
3613.76s: So now if we just eyeball what these different things could be again, I think Ben was like a two delta.
3626.48s: This was like a five delta.
3628.80s: I think this one was like a 50 delta.
3631.28s: And then I think this was a one delta.
3633.52s: Something like that. I think it's pretty close.
3637.52s: And then the premium page we know Ben, you only wanted 30 cents.
3641.36s: I think this will actually show us this is good so we can at least see what the premium we paid were.
3648.80s: So then we have this, we have a dollar 15, we have 1340, and then we have 6250.
3656.64s: So we have all of this.
3659.36s: So if we think about different size price moves, the total impact of the position will be
3667.36s: completely different depending on how far the stock moves.
3671.20s: Now we'll start by just using delta.
3673.60s: There will be other factors like implied volatility.
3676.64s: But again, like because this is completely locked up, it's not really going to help us.
3681.76s: And actually to see if I can't fix it, what I'll do is I'll move us over to this screen.
3688.08s: I'm just going to close it down really fast if I can't open it back up.
3694.88s: Yeah, it's completely frozen.
3696.32s: Very, very weird.
3702.48s: Okay, so if we just use delta, it'll be close.
3709.52s: It won't be as accurate as I want.
3711.44s: So I'm trying to open thinkorswim again right now.
3713.52s: It says it's installing updates.
3717.76s: So I'll give it a second to do that.
3719.12s: And then if not, I'll just start guessing.
3722.72s: So we know that this would have been about the stock price though, the 5950.
3730.24s: And then because that's like a 50 delta.
3732.48s: And then for the example, I'm just going to hop on my phone.
3736.16s: And then I'm going to see what the total movement was in SPX.
3744.56s: On the third of March, which is what we're using.
3748.64s: So let's go to the third of March.
3753.92s: Here.
3755.76s: And it opened at 5968.
3761.92s: 5968.
3764.32s: And then it closed at 5849.
3772.48s: And it looks like thinkorswim is down because it's stuck on installing update.
3777.20s: So just keep over here.
3781.04s: So this line is this, the bud by this.
3786.64s: So this was our move on the day, 1.99%.
3791.20s: So then we can just eyeball 5849 is the exit.
3800.48s: And then we can again, we can guess what the premium might be based on just the changes in delta.
3815.44s: So we'll simulate that now again.
3817.28s: I just want to be abundantly clear.
3818.80s: There are other factors we're just using what we can right now because thinkorswim is down.
3823.76s: So the stock price here then will do delta impact.
3830.48s: And this isn't going to capture gamma, unfortunately.
3833.44s: So the delta's we're going to speculate that they move linearly, but they won't.
3839.04s: So you're not going to capture one of the more actually just realized that's going to be one of
3843.44s: the more important effects to be honest is because the delta change on these based on gamma
3850.08s: is a huge factor. So I won't be able to capture that because I don't know what the delta's are
3857.28s: or what the gamma is for any of them. Gamma.
3860.80s: Well, we'll see if thinkorswim turns on later.
3864.16s: If you guys can keep me apprised if you don't mind trying it once in a while.
3867.60s: And then in the meantime, I'll just summarize what we effectively know will happen.
3873.04s: The first thing we know what will happen is that these two trades need much bigger moves
3880.32s: in order to make money. But if we get those big moves because of gamma, they will compound very
3888.24s: quickly. So then if we were to size these trades on a commensurate basis with the largest trade,
3896.80s: which in this case is 62.5, what we can do is we can just eyeball what the lot sizes would be.
3904.16s: So in this case, we're saying 62.5 is the cap that's the most we can put on. So this is going to be a
3909.76s: one lot. And then this equals the 62.5 divided by this. So this one, you can get on a four lot.
3917.36s: This one would equal the 62.5 divided by this. You can get a 54 lot.
3923.20s: And then this one equals the 62.5 divided by this. You can get a 208 lot.
3928.88s: And the reason for this is to show the example based on same size positions.
3936.48s: Because here's effectively what would happen. In this scenario, we can see that for the more
3946.40s: expensive position, you can't put on as many. But the bigger position will have a much higher delta.
3955.28s: So then if you don't get as big of a move as you thought you might get, then all of a sudden,
3962.48s: this one delta can make a lot of sense. So now let's go back. I'm going to just
3970.16s: quit on thinker swim. And then let's go back. I'm going to grab what's trading view. We can use this
3978.64s: for the example. And we were looking at SPX. And I don't have like the convenient indicators on
3991.60s: like the same labels. So I can eyeball ATR and ADR. So we'll just kind of talk about them in general.
3997.60s: But here's one thing we can tell more recently. Look at the size of the candles here.
4004.32s: Compared to the size of the candles here, compared to the size of the candles here,
4008.80s: and then here, and so on. What do you notice? One of the things I notice for sure is that when it's
4015.60s: going down, the candles are bigger. And then I notice when it's going up, the candles are smaller,
4022.32s: not every time, but in general. So the reason why this matters is because the way that I might build my
4032.56s: trade, if I think it's going up versus if I think it's going down on the day,
4038.40s: might also depend on where we are in a cycle. So in this case, I'm expecting smaller movements.
4049.04s: If I'm trying to trade a zero DTE idea, using those super far out of the money options is going to be
4056.08s: very suboptimal because you're not going to get enough of a move in order for them to show a profit
4061.44s: at the rate that they're decaying away. Whereas if I'm trying to trade the zero DTE idea on one of
4068.08s: these more inside days, maybe I go with the higher cost, higher delta. And it's because I get at
4074.08s: least the dollar for dollar move with the underlying. So then conversely, if I'm trading up or down
4082.40s: direction, but during these broader down move style days, the way that I build that position will
4088.88s: look different because I know as the market's going down, the average daily range is expanding.
4094.64s: That information impacts how I ultimately will build the trade. So now that we have at least
4103.92s: the base understanding of how we test different structures to then create parameters around,
4111.28s: this is when we turn option structures into strategies, then we can get into the trade process.
4117.52s: And the process of building a trade is now very simple because using this example that we just did,
4125.20s: if I know that I'm trading zero DTE options with the directional tilt. And if I run my data analysis
4131.84s: based on downloading historic data, and I take a look at what's the propensity for the third trading
4138.80s: day after the prior two days were read, maybe the same thing if the prior two days were green.
4145.04s: And then I know that when the market is going down, the average true range is higher as compared to
4149.76s: when it's going up. So in this example, going back to this, if we were trading one of these days in here,
4157.92s: would I prefer, let's say we were trading it to the downside again, if I were trading this to the
4165.60s: downside, would I prefer in the money based position or an out of the money based position?
4172.32s: I might prefer something that allows me to compound more. Or for me, I would actually take a hybrid
4178.40s: fortunately because it's not really a this or that, meaning the base position might be something
4183.04s: that's in the money for the delta move. But then the I might add a kicker options that are out
4188.48s: of the money that will compound quickly if the move is large enough. I wouldn't do that. If I was
4195.52s: trying to trade directly on one of these days, now this is also with the glory of hindsight,
4200.32s: right? Seeing exactly what happens. But you'll notice as you analyze these things that this trend is
4205.36s: very common, whereas things are going up and maintaining up trends, the average daily range will
4211.04s: contract volatility will contract. That's exactly what that is.
4216.72s: By knowing those details about the strategy, it inherently informs how I analyze the profit
4225.76s: mechanism in the signal. These are details I know about the profit mechanism in the signal. So then
4231.76s: when I'm building my trade, I'm building it in the context of understanding the broad performance
4239.36s: of the strategy. And by understanding what the implications are, where we are today in the market,
4247.68s: against what my idea is, and then I build the trade that capitalizes on that idea. And again,
4256.56s: this example was using like a zero DTE concept. And again, to Ben's point earlier, it doesn't mean
4264.08s: like that's not Ben's strategy. He was just responding to questions I had.
4269.36s: Now, when we're going through and building a trade, one other note that's extremely important
4277.12s: to identify. And again, this is all from the Outlier Trade Process video. You'll get all these
4280.96s: details there. But the main thing is that it always, every single time, starts with reviewing the
4289.36s: portfolio. The reason why we have to review the portfolios because we need to know what the
4295.52s: portfolio needs or doesn't need, what we want to put in or what we don't want. The portfolio fit
4302.80s: is always the first stop before ever placing a trade. And there are different scenarios. Sometimes
4311.20s: we'll look at the portfolio and there might be specific traits that we want to try to add to it.
4316.16s: Sometimes we'll look at the portfolio and say it doesn't really need anything. I just got to use
4319.60s: more money or we can look at the portfolio and say, I don't really need to do anything right now.
4324.96s: And in that case, you might choose to be super selective on what you might in exposure to.
4332.72s: So that's why portfolio fit is literally always first. So unfortunately, the platform is down. So
4339.92s: I am going to wrap up this session here. I'm happy to hang out for a little bit. We can do like a
4345.04s: Q&A if you guys want to talk about what we just reviewed together. If there's specific elements
4350.32s: that you want to explore, happy to discuss that stuff. Sorry that the platform kind of crept out
4357.52s: on us a little bit of a bummer. But that's how it goes. The main thing is you really don't need the
4362.64s: platform to understand the broader concepts that I'm explaining to you at least hopefully. And the
4369.44s: the broad takeaway here is that when you're building a trade, it needs to start from the point
4379.44s: of executing a strategy. The strategy has to be something that we've researched. Actually,
4386.08s: we can do that really quick. We can talk about researching a strategy because with the platform
4391.28s: down, I actually can show you another scenario. Actually, I kind of like that idea.
4397.92s: What I want to show you is how to explore that idea that I was just outlining. Specifically,
4404.24s: the well, what's the propensity if there's two consecutive down days that the third day is
4411.36s: up or down, right? Like that kind of thing. Now normally, I would use something very simple.
4420.56s: Like I would just use Python, but everybody now has access to chat GPT, which is actually awesome
4426.96s: because chat GPT can accelerate all of that. So what I'm going to do now is go into SPX really fast
4433.76s: on bar chart. And I'm going to go to historical data. So right now, I am here. And then I can
4444.56s: just download it for the past, you know, X period of time. And as you can tell, we download a lot.
4454.00s: So we'll grab this, open this up. First step, we just got to clean it super fast, get rid of this.
4465.60s: And then the other thing that you'll learn from bar chart is that bar chart really, or I'm sorry,
4470.56s: not bar chart, um, chat GPT. It prefers date. And then it prefers close. You by changing those two,
4479.28s: you just save yourself a little bit of training on the model. You can tell chat GPT that it's named
4484.48s: differently, but it'll get stuck up on it a little bit. So now what I'm going to do is I'm actually
4489.60s: going to upload this to chat GPT. And I'm going to tell it to analyze
4503.68s: the performance of SPX using the last five years of data.
4512.08s: I want, I want to see if there is a predictive trend.
4521.76s: When there are two consecutive,
4528.56s: consecutive days of either an up or down move. And I'm going to define for it what I consider the
4538.16s: upper down move. So this is going to be using open to close.
4544.48s: I want to see if there's a predictive trend when there are two consecutive down days of either
4550.16s: upper down for the next trading day and the propensity for it to either continue the trend or reverse it.
4571.04s: Also, calculate the 20 day, average daily range, and see if there is a correlation between
4589.76s: 80 are in the third trading day, continuation, or reversal. Let's see what it does.
4603.92s: So right now what I'm showing you is actually the process of researching it. How I would go about
4609.60s: taking this idea and like just starting to at least get my bearings around it. Okay, so let's see.
4615.76s: Brian says, are you a full-time trader? I definitely, depending on what you consider full-time,
4620.72s: but I make the most money from trading. But I do a lot of other things.
4628.80s: Ben says, oh, I thought I chose the puts specific for compounding, but I've never actually done
4634.56s: anything with options. Yeah, no, that's okay. And that's the those puts that you got the way to
4640.56s: look at it is that they're not all created equal. There are some puts that are much more susceptible
4648.56s: to compounding. And then there are other other puts that really don't compound as much,
4653.76s: but just provide standard leverage. So a good example of that is if you buy an option that has
4662.72s: a delta of one, it doesn't compound at all. It's already out of one delta. The compounding
4668.96s: effective options occurs from gamma. So if I show you, I mean, get rid of all that nonsense.
4678.16s: I show you an option that has let's call it a 0.10 delta.
4686.48s: And then let's say gamma is 0.01. And then let's just fill this out like loosely.
4698.72s: It's say like 0.20. Let's say gamma is 0.02. Let's say 0.30. Gamma is 0.02.
4710.72s: 0.40. And I think these are behind my head. So I'll move myself in a second. Let's say gamma goes
4716.48s: to 0.03. And then so on. Give me one sec. I'll just move myself off to there. So
4728.72s: this is one scenario compared to the other scenario where we have a delta of one. Gamma
4738.24s: will be 2,000. At least in your positive direction, just to be clear, like technically this will,
4747.92s: this still absolutely can have gamma because delta in this context can change if it goes against you.
4754.80s: But I'm just saying for the continuation, you can't gain any more delta. It's maxed out.
4761.68s: So here's what happens. The stock goes up $1 plus 1. You now have, you go from 10 delta,
4769.36s: you gain 10 cents of premium, you gain 1 delta. So now you have 0.11. And then this continues down
4778.08s: the path. So then another scenario, if you have, let's say the underlying goes up another dollar,
4785.44s: just pretending maybe this is super liquid and this represents a $1 move. So now, well,
4792.56s: there would be like 0.15 or something. So what ends up happening is as your option, as it moves
4800.40s: in your favor, it compounds more quickly than just what the delta would provide. And it's because
4809.04s: it's rapidly gaining more delta as it goes in your favor. Whereas if you have an option with the
4816.48s: delta of one and it continues to go in your favor, the most you can have is one. So the compounding
4823.20s: effect is all from gamma. Gamma is what allows your option to gain more delta's and the gaining of
4834.40s: more delta's per same one point move is what leads to the like the actual compounding effect.
4842.64s: Whereas if we get something with the delta of one, there really isn't much of a compounding
4847.76s: effect because it's already at the biggest size, more or less that it can be. But you have leverage
4856.24s: still because that leverage comes from the fact that even though that you have a delta of one and
4862.64s: you can't gain more delta's, it absolutely is still cheaper to buy an option with a delta of one
4870.32s: to control those 100 shares as compared to buying 100 shares outright. So two different ways to
4879.28s: play the same idea. Paul says generally speaking does increased volume and our OI correspond to levels
4890.96s: observed in price action. Generally speaking depends on how generally speaking. If I were to do
4903.20s: my best to give you an answer that isn't it depends, I would say a low correlation, but it depends.
4910.80s: And it's because there are certain things that there will be a significant correlation. And then
4916.64s: there will be other things where there's very little correlation. So it genuinely does depend
4922.32s: quite a lot. Now let's see what ChatGPT came back with. The file and data processing was interrupted.
4932.96s: Please upload the file again. Okay.
4938.32s: Do you think?
4939.20s: I don't know if you guys have tried GTPT 4.5. It seems okay, but I think for this 4.0 will be better.
4957.92s: So I'm letting that run in the background.
4969.92s: Let me grab the chat and hang out with you guys while it's trying to figure its life out.
4978.08s: Any other questions that you guys have either on what we've covered so far in the series or on what
4984.48s: we've covered tonight while this is running?
4999.60s: Alberto says this has been a fun session. That's awesome. Yeah, I'm glad. I hope that it's been at
5006.24s: least useful to understand the process because that part is super, super important.
5012.48s: ChatGPT is saying it seems the file doesn't have a column named time. Oh, this is funny because
5017.84s: I already trained the model on the old version. That's so funny. Time column is now
5029.44s: date and last column is now closed. That's so funny. In this chat thread that I have with it,
5042.00s: I trained it to the old columns and it remembered it. The humor and that's pretty good.
5051.04s: Let's see what this comes up with. Now, the other thing is you can do this in Python.
5055.60s: Perfect. Here we go. Okay. And this is exactly why ChatGPT is the fucking game changer.
5074.40s: This is exactly why. So the question we started with is is there any sort of predictive value
5084.24s: in two consecutive trading days, whether up or down and whether or not that impacts the third day?
5090.56s: And this goes back to the original idea that we were talking about for Ben for trading zero DTE
5095.60s: directionally. And we have to figure out some sort of predictive capacity to identify direction.
5102.00s: So we downloaded the last 25 years of data for SPX daily. We asked it to run the analysis on the
5108.56s: last five years. And again, I would take this research much further. I would segment it. I
5113.52s: would wait it towards the more recent data. I would use a longer look back window. But it's
5118.00s: really just for the sake of the example here. And this is what ChatGPT gave us. It gives us the
5122.96s: actual output of data. And it says that in the scenarios, the probability of a trend continuation
5132.32s: after two consecutive updates, 51% chance the next day is up 48 that it's down. The probability of
5140.64s: a trend continuation after two consecutive down days, 55% reversal, 44% continuation. So what do
5148.24s: we notice? We notice two very usable ideas. The first idea is that there is a slight edge for
5155.44s: reversal in both scenarios. The second thing we identify is that the probability of a reversal
5162.24s: is larger on down days than updates to consecutive down days turning into up. It's a four point edge
5169.04s: that's pretty significant. Now, there are further questions we could ask to refine this. You can see
5175.60s: that the correlation between the 20-day average daily range and third consecutive continuation is
5181.76s: about null. It's insignificant. So then we can ask other questions, though. We can say, is there a
5189.92s: relationship between the five-day ADR and maybe the 20-day compared to the five-day ADR
5197.44s: or maybe the price direction for the first 15 minutes of the day compared to the close
5203.84s: or the size of the prior move as individual days or composite day? These all these different
5211.84s: questions or ways that then we can analyze and this all is tied to step number two.
5219.36s: But all of this then continues to help inform our ideas. So a follow-on question I would ask
5227.60s: and let's see what it has is for each scenario what is the average percent move on the third day?
5244.24s: So now I'm essentially saying and wanting to see is is there a meaningful difference between
5250.16s: the size of the move in these two scenarios. So after two days, the average after two up days,
5262.56s: the average third day move is negative 0.016. So on an average besides the count, it means that the
5270.56s: down moves on the third day are larger than the up moves, right? That's how it builds that negative
5276.32s: and then after two down days, there's a positive 0.078% average move to the upside. So what that would
5285.68s: infer then is that there's absolutely a more significant effect to the rebound versus a third
5295.12s: continuation down day. All tradable information. This is the fun part of trading to me. I don't know
5302.88s: if this is stuff that you guys are like, yeah, this sucks. But for me, this is like the ability to
5309.52s: just explore ideas like this and then to figure out how to monetize them is so fun. That's one of
5315.36s: the big things I'm actually about to work on a video right now that's talking about a recent change
5319.12s: that I've seen in zero DTE option. And I'm excited to launch that. It won't be out honestly for
5323.60s: like a month because I'm building out the videos I'm traveling a bit, hitting up Ireland next month.
5331.84s: So I like to try to have videos queued up for you guys so that you're still busy. But
5339.60s: Ben says, do we see that in option press, all's going up on two days down. I don't follow.
5350.72s: I could you help me understand better.
5360.16s: Premium. Well, think of it this way, right? You would have to break that out then into two
5366.48s: follow on questions. The first primary input in this context is going to be volatility. So
5372.72s: is there a demonstrable volatility edge or I'm sorry, delta change. And in this case, we know that
5379.52s: if volatility if the market's going down two days in a row, volatility is more likely to be
5384.16s: expanding than contracting, especially when compared to two consecutive opt days, volatility will
5389.44s: typically contract versus expand. So that will input or impact the price correspondingly.
5395.76s: And then the severity of the move would be the second input in terms of option premiums.
5401.68s: So what you'll notice at a high level and again, that that's a great question by the way.
5406.72s: But the way that you would chase that down subsequently is then creating like a 20 day and a 10 day
5413.84s: rolling volatility input for the model, which is again, super easy to do. Chat you PT can do it for
5420.56s: you or you can do it in Python. And you can analyze if volatility is expanding because if it is,
5426.88s: then you know the options are getting more expensive. I was just going to try to click into the
5429.92s: platform. I forgot it's closed to show you the change implied volatility. But that is what you will
5436.08s: find. Sweet. All right, gang. That wraps me up two episodes left. If there's anything that you
5445.68s: need, if you're stuck on anything that we've learned so far, let you boy know. But as always,
5451.52s: be an ally. I'll see you all later.
