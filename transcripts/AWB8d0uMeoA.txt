324.00s:  What's up outliers? Happy Friday and happy episode 11. So it's not quite like Star Wars.
334.00s:  Actually, I don't know how many Star Wars episodes there are, but for this, I can tell you
339.32s:  that there are 11. And we will be wrapping up the outlier options trading basics stream.
348.80s:  And I run this series maybe one or two times a few times a year typically. I timed this
354.56s:  one to be, you know, towards the start of this year. We've been meeting every Friday
359.48s:  for the last 11, essentially in a row. And the goal behind doing these is to help provide
367.28s:  structure. The time that we spend together for one hour on Friday, to take a look through
374.12s:  this stuff is in no way shape or form sufficient in order to learn enough. The quote unquote
381.16s:  be a option trader, but it provides you context and it gives you structure to learn to follow
390.88s:  along on some of the key themes that go into making this a viable approach. Now, the goal
401.92s:  for the session today is I want to run through a quick recap. And then I actually want to spend
410.00s:  the majority of our time talking about where to go from here, how to take the stuff that we've
418.48s:  discussed, that we've started to learn and how to actually turn this into something usable for you
425.60s:  in longer term. So with that, I figured that we could start by just quickly rehashing what
435.04s:  we've discussed. So we've discussed options 101. And I'm actually going to move you over to this
441.52s:  screen and kind of combine both of these like this so that you can get a side by side view of the
451.92s:  stuff that we have talked about and the stuff that I think you should consider integrating into
461.76s:  your approach going forward. So here we have the beginning, the beginning started with a recap.
470.16s:  We talked about things like the opportunity around options. And for those that don't remember,
480.48s:  the opportunity around options effectively boils down to the fact that it provides a strategic
487.84s:  investment. And the concept of a strategic investment is simple. It means that we can shape and
493.76s:  form the idea into something very specific. It's not like a stock return. When you're buying or
500.48s:  selling a stock, the stock can go up or the stock can go down. In this space, it's actually quite
507.68s:  different. And you can structure things to fit a lot of different ideas. You can trade things that
514.40s:  you think might go up a little bit, might go up a lot, might go up a lot, but over a longer term
519.84s:  time frame that might go up and then might go down. That might have no stock change, but the volatility
525.44s:  changes and so on and so forth. That's one of the beautiful things about options. The second thing is
530.72s:  we talked about were the key market participants. Who else is in this space? What they're doing?
537.52s:  Why they're doing it? The reason why this is important to you is because it is always
544.00s:  prudent to understand the get in where you fit in. Understanding that there are areas of
551.60s:  trading that retail has zero potential to compete, but that doesn't mean that we cannot find ways to
558.88s:  make money in trading. And the other thing is when a retail trader is setting out to enter the
568.72s:  markets, it's really, really important to understand the world that we're stepping into.
575.44s:  I think a lot of traders step into the market with a lot of hopes and dreams. They have a lot of
580.72s:  desires, but the reality is the market doesn't really care about any of that. And unfortunately,
587.76s:  I think for a lot of traders, they run into a series of issues where they start to
593.20s:  realize that fact the hard way through losing money, which is unfortunate.
598.32s:  Episode two, we talked about buying versus selling options. Just literally just talked about the
602.48s:  actual structural implications of them, but then also the different use cases for them,
607.28s:  which is important because for a trader like me, I do both. And what I do in terms of buying or
614.48s:  selling premium largely depends on what's going on in the market and what kind of risk that I want.
618.72s:  There are absolutely traders out there that choose to either buy premium or sell premium. There are
624.64s:  other ways to go about this. I typically think that the more adaptable you can be as a trader,
632.88s:  the more consistent that you thus can be as a trader. You're not beholden to only being able to
639.28s:  capture specific ideas when your one fastball pops up. Next up, I think this is still that standard
650.56s:  issue I've shared with you guys before. We're like, this thing locks up, but we'll be all right.
655.60s:  Next up was pricing, understanding standard pricing models. And the key takeaway from this is that
662.48s:  when we're pricing an option, we know everything except one thing, which is implied volatility.
667.28s:  And the name of the game of options trading largely revolves around different expectations and ideas
675.12s:  around volatility. After that, we got into trader organization. This matters because there's a lot
686.16s:  happening here. And this is actually going to be one of the big things we're going to talk about
690.08s:  with the path forward from here because you are not going to remember all this stuff.
695.84s:  It is literally impossible to. And the only way that you're going to effectively be able to
702.56s:  iterate and create something for you that is successful longer term is if you actually have
709.60s:  a good system in place to track what you're doing. After that, we talked about volatility.
715.44s:  And obviously all of the nuances, the different kinds, how it behaves, how it kind of can be classified
721.28s:  as its own asset class, which is pretty cool. Then we got into the Greeks. The Greeks are essentially
729.20s:  the way that we measure how options move. And it gives us a lot of fidelity around the positions as
739.36s:  we're building them. And we learn things like the Greeks are not static. They change. The Greeks
745.20s:  have relationships with one another. There's multiple order Greeks. We can have Greeks that are
749.52s:  specifically isolating effects with respect to price. We can have Greeks that isolate effects
754.16s:  with respect to other Greeks. And this again gives us insight into how an option moves.
761.04s:  Then we just had a general Q&A. In this one, we talked a little bit about the learning path for
766.56s:  an options trader. How long it takes to get your feet under you, how to build strategies,
771.20s:  those kinds of things. Then more recently, the last couple, how to not only read and navigate
779.44s:  an options chain, but also how to use it to identify underlying market information. Because there's
787.20s:  a lot in there. And the options chains are actually very educational in that way. And
792.88s:  for that, we got into building an option, how to actually start taking these ideas to turn it
801.68s:  into a trade and then thus to take multiple trades into build a portfolio. That's what we've
809.12s:  talked about over the last 10 episodes. So if you've made it through all of these episodes
815.12s:  genuinely, you should give yourself some kudos, whether that's a pat on the back or whether that's
820.72s:  taken a moment and saying like, yeah, actually, that is, as you click through this, this is a lot
825.52s:  of shit. It's a lot of stuff. And you all know that when we go through these things, I try to strike
832.16s:  a balance with how deep we go, but this is in no way like very superficial level. It's definitely
837.84s:  a little deeper than that. So not just the scope of what we covered, but we covered some decent
845.20s:  depth behind it all. So anytime that you go through a program like that, whether it's something
852.56s:  as simple as just kind of a YouTube series with me or anything else, I think it is important to
858.16s:  create the mental association with feeling satisfied after completing a task, but then also
864.72s:  completing something that is genuinely helping you round out your skill set. Options trading can be
870.40s:  really, really tricky in the sense that you can do a lot. And then after a while, it kind of feels
876.40s:  like you're just like, like learning into the void. But that is part of the process in building
882.08s:  and understanding. It's actually really funny. I had a podcast yesterday with somebody I respect
887.20s:  in the field significantly, which is you and Sinclair. And that podcast will be out next week.
893.60s:  And one of the things he mentioned during that podcast that resonated with me so
900.08s:  strongly, and it's something that will probably make a lot of sense to you actually after I say it
907.20s:  in terms of connecting the dots on a lot of things that I do. And one of the things you
912.56s:  and talked about was the importance of building a baseline, meaning when you look at something,
921.60s:  and rather than looking at something, trying to identify what's wrong or what's missing,
929.52s:  instead looking at it and just understanding what's normal. And then after you look at something
939.52s:  so long and you understand what's normal, then it becomes really easy to spot things that are
945.60s:  ab normal in some way. And you've heard me call this out a million different times on the different
950.88s:  live streams that I do with you all. And I found it so interesting because as you and was talking
956.88s:  about that, I couldn't identify more with it. It's like such a big part of what I do. And I think
968.16s:  it's something that an options trader needs to understand and adopt for themselves. Because
978.16s:  the reality is for most options trader, traders out there like this ain't it. This is not
984.32s:  going to be the thing for you. And the reason why that's the case is most people come into this with
989.44s:  really bad expectations. They have a lot of things that they want to accomplish. They have a lot of
996.00s:  hopes and dreams. They want something that returns better than the market. That's not very volatile.
1001.60s:  That never has a down month. That doesn't require a lot of time or effort. There's all these
1006.40s:  things that traders come into this thing wanting, which I don't blame them. I want that too. But
1013.04s:  it's not the reality of what we do as traders. And again, it's a good thing because if it was
1019.20s:  able to be so, then it would be really difficult to make decent money doing this because it would
1025.44s:  become increasingly flooded. So all of that is to say a big part of your success as a trader
1032.64s:  is sticking around long enough to build experience, to then create a baseline understanding of things,
1040.32s:  to then start thinking of different ways that you can make money from deviations from baselines,
1048.00s:  or from standard market effects. But the only way you can really understand a market
1051.68s:  effect is if you study and see it that it's there. So that leads us now to where we sit
1060.56s:  today and the purpose of the episode today, which is building a roadmap, thinking about where we
1068.56s:  go from here. And I actually thought what better way to take all of this stuff and put it all
1080.08s:  together, then to actually go through a little bit of an exercise with you all. I actually
1084.40s:  had built a pretty robust final exam that I was going to give you guys. And maybe I'll send it
1090.32s:  out at some point. Just a bunch of random questions or multiple choice so that it was going to be
1093.68s:  easier to do on the stream. So say they're thinking it's like any one of you can have chat GPT
1099.44s:  give yourself a quiz, right? So I was thinking, yeah, that's probably not the best use of our time
1106.00s:  together on the stream. And I thought a better use of time together would be to work through all
1112.80s:  of this stuff kind of in order and think about how we take these pieces and turn it into something
1120.40s:  bigger than the sum of the individual parts. So that's the game plan. I want to walk through a
1125.12s:  roadmap forward for you. But before I could open the door for Thor.
1136.72s:  Okay. Let's get to it. Let me grab our drawing pad.
1150.08s:  And let's catch this out, shall we? So the way that I'm approaching this conversation is that
1159.36s:  we just finished a pretty basic and generalized course that helps us understand the context of
1170.00s:  options. Now the game is figuring out how to take this information and then to turn it into
1176.16s:  something further. Now we've already talked about all kinds of things, the outlier strategy process,
1182.88s:  the outlier trade process, right? Like you're familiar with all of these core concepts, which is
1189.28s:  great. But that means now we need to actually begin applying things in a meaningful way.
1199.36s:  So what is, and I would like you to throw this in the chat, what is the number one most important
1209.44s:  thing to you as a trader? This is above everything. And my guess is a bunch of you are going to get it
1220.96s:  wrong. And it's not like wrong wrong. It's like semi wrong. What do you think?
1230.40s:  What is your first, you were very first priority as a trader.
1239.44s:  Anybody?
1255.44s:  Consistency of results? No. Lauren says mechanics. No. Tommy says goals. No.
1263.52s:  Jordan says returns. That's the closest. Alberto says having fun. We know that's not correct.
1269.92s:  Hep A says increase our wealth. That's also close.
1273.44s:  Paul says get a good return for the wrist. That's close.
1277.68s:  Juicy bot says managing minimizing risk. That's not it. Tommy says how to make money getting warmer.
1284.72s:  Nate says protect capital. That is absolutely not the case.
1289.36s:  You can protect your capital much easier ways than going into the stock market.
1293.84s:  I'm much better off protecting my capital by putting it into a CD. That's easy to protect the capital.
1303.68s:  The things in here that you guys were talking about that were close. Were things like
1309.60s:  returns, things like increase our wealth, good return for the risk. Those are closest.
1318.40s:  Tommy says how much money need to make in what time frame? That's more of like a planning
1325.36s:  consideration. That's not your number one priority. Hater says taking risk. That's not it.
1333.52s:  Closer, but still not it. Think of it this way. If we wanted to just make money,
1344.00s:  we can make money by buying and holding in index ETF.
1353.76s:  Through the approach of trading, we're trying to do more than that. It doesn't
1359.52s:  necessarily mean that we're trying to do more in the sense of getting better returns all the time.
1363.12s:  You can trade to try to be more consistent, to try to have less drawdown, to have less volatility.
1369.28s:  There's other things that you can trade for that's not always beating the market.
1375.28s:  But there is an absolutely essential function that needs to be in place in order to do anything
1386.96s:  as a trader. It's a four-letter word.
1398.80s:  Edge. Your number one priority as a trader is edge. Without edge, literally nothing else you do
1422.88s:  as a trader matters. You can have the best, best risk control. If you have great risk control
1433.52s:  and no edge, you will simply lose money in a controlled way. That's not good.
1442.96s:  You can have the best capital protection model out there. You can protect your capital in the best
1452.72s:  way possible. It's great to have protected capital, but that makes you no money.
1460.32s:  This is the entire focus for a new trader. He's developing edge. There are a lot of ways
1475.68s:  to approach this problem set. As we go through this entire list of things,
1485.68s:  some of the things in here are designed to directly support edge.
1493.28s:  Some of the things in here are designed to help us capitalize on edge or maintain our ability
1502.88s:  to extract an edge. But everything that you do as a trader, it must incorporate some sort of edge.
1515.60s:  Whether your ultimate goal is to maximize the risk to reward that you're taking.
1521.68s:  Whether your goal is to consistently profit as a trader. Whether your goal is to try and have
1530.48s:  some sort of income generation component to what you're doing. Edge is what is required in all of
1538.00s:  those scenarios universally period full stop. This is the focus. Now that being said,
1549.12s:  in order to get and build an edge, this is where the uncomfortable reality enters the equation
1558.48s:  because we now have to do hard work. There is no fast, easy way to a consistent edge.
1569.28s:  And if we reflect back onto something like this, which you've seen before,
1579.20s:  the outlier strategy process, notice the first thing that's in here.
1586.00s:  The profit mechanism. This is how you are going to make money with whatever it is you're trying to do.
1598.48s:  So this is your edge. Whatever the edge ultimately is that you're attempting to extract.
1606.48s:  One of the things I would encourage you to think away from is sometimes people will think that
1614.64s:  edge is some sort of market outperformance. And there's an argument, by the way, depending on the
1623.28s:  context to be made for that for sure. But in the context of a standard trader that's looking to
1629.68s:  accomplish a set of goals, whatever those set of goals are, edge is how you're going to realize your
1638.96s:  performance towards those goals. So then we know that this is our focus. We have got to create an edge.
1650.88s:  The second priority.
1660.32s:  Another exceedingly unsexy concept, organization.
1665.52s:  So this is beyond the documentation and all that stuff. It's going to be your trading plan,
1671.84s:  your trading log, yada, yada, yada. But in terms of organization, the other things I bucket into
1677.12s:  this are having defined goals. It's being organized not only as a trader in the activity of trading,
1689.52s:  but being organized as a trader, as a human being that's doing something.
1695.60s:  So in order to have any chance of success as a trader, we need to very clearly articulate what
1703.12s:  we're attempting to undergo, why we're attempting to do this. And here's the fun fact. If traders
1711.36s:  actually spent time up front defining what their goals are and not just defining a goal in the
1719.44s:  context of like, Oh, I would like this. Not that at all. That's bullshit. Nobody cares what you'd like.
1726.96s:  Defining goals in the context of, I think this is in the realm of possibility. And then taking time
1735.52s:  to vet it because I cannot tell you how many times we go through something like Reddit or just
1743.68s:  general conversations I have from people DMing me or emailing me asking things like, Hey, Eric,
1749.92s:  is 1% per week reasonable?
1755.36s:  1% per week sounds so reasonable. You have a $100,000 account.
1766.40s:  All you're trying to do is make 1% per week. That seems like somebody that's not being
1777.44s:  overly aggressive. That's trying to grow their account slowly. And then if you annualize that return,
1785.68s:  does anybody know what the annualized return on 1% per week is?
1795.52s:  Obviously you can do the math, but without doing the math. I'm wondering if anybody just knows.
1801.60s:  Pretty high. Yeah. It's like almost 70%.
1811.36s:  I want to say it's like 67, 68, 69. It's like something in the 60s.
1817.44s:  So it's it's high 60s. So it's like 70% per year is what this person is asking to do.
1825.92s:  This is the equivalent of I used to jitsu a lot. I don't think a lot of you are probably jitsu players.
1833.52s:  So I think the analogies probably go off. What's a like a better, most commonly known sport? I mean,
1841.36s:  maybe in the US football, I hate football or maybe soccer, but I don't know anything about soccer
1847.76s:  either. I guess the way to think about it is back to jitsu is if this is your expectation,
1858.88s:  this is the same as being brand new at a sport. And genuinely, thinking that you are going to not
1865.68s:  only compete but outperform most of the top performers if not all of them. Like that's that's literally
1873.28s:  what this is. And I don't necessarily think that this always comes from greed. I really don't.
1882.32s:  I think this often comes from genuinely not taking the time to clearly define your goals and vet
1888.56s:  them to even see if this shit is realistic because the paradigm of a standard trader is they're so
1895.44s:  concerned with what they want, with what they hope that they totally forget that that doesn't
1903.84s:  actually matter to the markets. Getting used to interacting with the system that is completely
1909.68s:  agnostic towards your existence is super important. This is actually one of the beautiful things
1914.56s:  about the military is the military teaches you early on that it's really not about you or like
1922.88s:  your preferences. It's always going to be for the greater good. I'm just offering this as a general
1929.12s:  mindset for those that might be veterans or military people because you already have a leg up
1934.80s:  when it comes to understanding the fact that you might have your preferences, but your preferences
1939.60s:  ultimately don't really matter in the Marine Corps. We always say needs of the core matter more.
1945.28s:  As a trader, there's nothing wrong with defining your goals and having aggressive goals. I think
1951.04s:  aggressive goals are fine, but I will remind you in my humble opinion, I think for the first two years
1959.92s:  greater than 0% return is perfect.
1969.28s:  Seems lame. Seems like why are we doing this? Why even bother? Why why even trade if all I'm trying to
1977.76s:  do is be greater than 0? The reason is because as a new trader, there is just about nothing. You
1988.08s:  are going to do in the first three years that is actually going to matter with respect to
1995.84s:  meaningfully growing your account. It is what it is. It over it. The reality is for your first few
2005.04s:  years of trading, you are actually focusing on building a sustainable skill set. You're focusing on
2014.00s:  things like creating an effective process to learn to track what you're doing because you go back
2024.16s:  to what I said in the beginning. A big part of becoming an expert at anything is developing
2031.44s:  experience. You cannot develop any experience in trading if you blow up your account trying to do
2036.72s:  things that you literally do not have neither the context nor the skill set to produce.
2044.40s:  So this is one of the instances where I actually think the notion of if you aim low enough,
2051.76s:  you might be able to hit it is fully applicable. This is accepting the fact
2059.76s:  that slow is smooth smooth is fast. What that means is, and again, we use this in the military,
2067.04s:  where a lot of times if you're trying to go through some sort of fine motor movement when you're
2072.40s:  in a high stress scenario, your movements become really erratic, jagged, very not smooth.
2078.64s:  And even though it feels like you're moving super, super fast, like maybe during a reload,
2083.84s:  you're actually slowing down because you're so jagged in your movements.
2088.88s:  So by deliberately slowing your movements down, which seems in feels like you're moving slower than
2095.36s:  when you're really trying to move super fast, you actually ultimately move faster because things
2100.72s:  are smoother. In trading, the exact same concept applies. If in your first few years, you're
2109.68s:  focusing on good solid fundamentals of trading, building the skill set, which is what we're about to
2114.24s:  go into, then you are building the foundation to then actually achieve returns. And if you don't
2123.44s:  like this, and if what I'm saying upsets you, that's actually good because it means you're learning
2128.08s:  something, but the second thing it means you need to reconcile with yourself if this is the
2133.68s:  thing for you. Because if we talk about why do so many traders fail, it is not because trading is
2140.96s:  all that difficult. It really is not. It's difficult in the sense that it requires doing a lot of
2146.80s:  things and at least being decent at most of them, but it's not difficult in the sense that you have
2156.00s:  to have specific personal attributes in order to stand a chance of being successful at this.
2162.40s:  It doesn't matter if you were born six foot tall or seven foot tall. Trading doesn't care
2168.64s:  about any of that stuff. It cares about things like your work ethic. How adaptable are you?
2175.04s:  How persistent are you? Things like that. That's what I mean. It's not that difficult because
2181.52s:  anybody that applies a concerted effort towards this can absolutely find something that generally works
2190.56s:  at least moderately well if they apply the right methodology, which includes a lot of iterative
2198.64s:  learning. Now that we have the beginning concepts identified, now is when we actually get into the
2208.48s:  next steps. How do we take this list of things, this list of things that we learned,
2215.36s:  and how do we turn it into something that we can actually monetize, make money?
2221.92s:  We already know the first thing is edge. So in order to even understand anything about edge or what
2231.12s:  edge can look like, step one here, and this is something I think makes sense literally for all of you,
2240.08s:  for at least the next three months.
2248.32s:  For three months,
2250.32s:  I think that's what I think is the most important thing to do.
2263.84s:  Monitor the market and take notes. Again, it seems so simple. It seems so stupid.
2272.56s:  And just like you saw in the karate kid, when Mr. Miyagi had the dude, I forgot the dude's name,
2278.64s:  do in the wax on, wax off repeatedly, over and over and over again.
2285.28s:  It seems useless. It seems not applicable to what you might be trying to do, whereas this,
2290.56s:  I'm actually giving you something directly, at least in the realm of what you're trying to do.
2295.44s:  The reason why those kinds of things are so useful is again, because they're building a base
2302.64s:  understanding of something. They're building a completely solid foundational core. So in the case
2313.12s:  of wax on, wax off, it's getting the movements right, doing it over and over again until it becomes
2318.16s:  muscle memory. Taking that to a trading lens by simply monitoring the markets meaningfully.
2325.68s:  When I say monitor the markets meaningfully, this isn't just randomly flipping through things and
2331.36s:  just kind of haphazardly seeing what you see. This is actually developing an approach to looking
2339.36s:  at markets and analyzing markets. And as you probably guess, I have a video that I can share with you
2348.24s:  that walks through a process to actually analyze markets. It's the video that I just dropped in
2357.20s:  and the video is titled How I Analyze the Stock Market to Build Ideas.
2364.32s:  The reason why I insist on you taking notes is because there is a well studied and documented
2374.16s:  effect that you learn better by writing things down. That's it. It's not that you have to have this
2380.96s:  big data source that you're going to go back and look through. The entire concept here is we're
2386.32s:  starting to build an understanding of what's normal, what's abnormal. This can be done during market
2394.64s:  clothes. You don't have to do this during the day sitting there just staring at the market, seeing
2399.12s:  what's happened. You can do it at the end of the day and you can just see what you see and take
2404.88s:  notes on it. You should be very deliberate. What we're doing here is we're building context.
2409.60s:  And three months, by the way, is just a snapshot. This is a super short amount of time.
2414.96s:  The next thing is step two, which I believe occurs simultaneously in conjunction with step one.
2426.72s:  And here, I think you pay per trade.
2434.08s:  Ideas.
2439.36s:  Step three. Also, during this very same three months,
2450.08s:  we build a trade log and trade plan. That's really the only way you pay per trade ideas is to have
2454.32s:  a supporting trade log. Here's what's happening during these first steps. We're creating market context.
2463.04s:  We're starting to throw ideas out and we're looking at the performance. This is not going through
2469.76s:  back testing. This again, this here is not because any of these ideas are probably going to work.
2478.88s:  The reality is they're probably not going to work and that you need to see that.
2484.88s:  The other thing is the main takeaway from step two here is actually the same as step one.
2491.12s:  It's building context. Now, during this time frame, though, we are starting to try and build
2499.20s:  an approach to placing trades. And again, this is where something like the outlier trade process
2508.56s:  is relevant. So I'll grab the video for that for you.
2521.36s:  Here. So during this, you're not worrying about back testing ideas. You're not worrying about
2533.12s:  if the idea is good. I will remind you just about everything you come up with. Your first two
2542.64s:  years of trading is probably hot garbage. That's just the facts. And again, that's not like something
2549.84s:  that you should be like, wow, that's crazy. Why would you say that or how could it take that long?
2554.08s:  Again, think about any other skill-based activity you've ever done in your life.
2561.76s:  How good do you get in the first year? Obviously from where you start, you grow exponentially.
2571.04s:  But then if you look back at where you were one year into that activity compared to where you
2577.84s:  might be now 10 years down the line from there, you probably think of it as like, shit, I didn't
2584.72s:  know anything. It's actually kind of embarrassing. It's the same idea here. We are not even worried
2590.80s:  about trying to come up with grand ideas because we do not have the context yet.
2598.88s:  Ben says, why do that? Why not test the idea first to prove it's at least theoretically possible?
2604.00s:  It's a great question. It's because you have no idea what the test for at this point.
2608.72s:  For a trader that's been in the market for experience of time, that is meaning when I say
2614.40s:  X period, I mean probably sub two years, you're not in a point. You don't even know how to back test.
2620.96s:  You don't even know what to look for. If you're a trader that is again, in that window, you are not
2627.92s:  familiar with the concepts like adverse selection. You don't know about confirmation bias.
2633.20s:  You don't know about sampling error. You probably don't know about sample distributions and
2637.20s:  sample out of sample. All of these things have to be done and understood deeply before you even
2643.60s:  attempt to crack open a back test because if you don't, then all you're doing is reaffirming
2650.08s:  terrible habits. So again, the main thing to answer Ben's question on this one is all you're
2657.36s:  doing is gaining context. You're not actually trying to trade these great ideas. Everything that you're
2662.64s:  trading in this is probably going to get thrown out. This is just so that you can look at the markets
2667.76s:  and just so that you can be engaged with your interaction with the markets while you're learning.
2671.92s:  That's exactly what this is. This is not the actually built trade ideas because a trader at this point
2678.40s:  is not prepared. They're not prepared in any way. It's a come up with good trade ideas.
2686.08s:  A Pepe said TA should also be considered as a must. No, definitely not. You can trade,
2695.36s:  you literally can trade an entire career with zero technical analysis if you're so inclined.
2700.32s:  If you're an options trader genuinely, there are different approaches that one could easily argue.
2708.40s:  The probabilities of movement are already generally accurately reflected in a chart,
2714.32s:  which air go are already going to be baked into an options chain. So it depends on your approach.
2721.44s:  It depends on your profit mechanism, but I wouldn't consider it a must. I think it's a good idea,
2726.16s:  personally. I think it makes sense. But I do not think that it's a must. But that does move us into
2735.36s:  step four. In analysis process, here, all we're doing is trying to create a standardized process
2763.92s:  with respect to how we conduct analysis. So this is not going to be always check the six-month chart,
2772.96s:  the two-month chart, the one-month chart. It's not that at all. We're thinking much higher process
2779.68s:  level here. We're thinking economy, stock market, these two are to develop baseline context.
2800.40s:  Then after we get the baseline context process down, then we can start outlining trade analysis.
2810.48s:  Now, the trade analysis in this context, again, is not for a specific strategy. It's the main
2815.84s:  muscle movements that, regardless of what strategy we're doing, needs to happen.
2822.80s:  So the trade analysis for a zero DTE strategy is going to look different than if I'm trying to
2829.68s:  trade a ratio called the Agnolum Palantir for a longer term idea. However, that being said,
2835.68s:  it does not mean that the major steps that I take in a zero DTE process do not apply to what I'm
2843.28s:  looking at the ratio called the Agnolum Palantir. So the trade analysis process, for me, is you guys
2851.44s:  know always starts with the portfolio, understanding the portfolio, and creating alignment with this
2859.36s:  base context. This is always going to happen first. So before I ever analyze an individual
2866.00s:  trade, I'm doing these things every single time. Then I can start thinking about analysis tools.
2878.80s:  So in here are things like for technical analysis, how do you think you're going to conduct it
2884.48s:  broadly? Again, this is not specific to a strategy yet. This is us trying to create a general
2892.16s:  approach to analyzing an individual trade. What are the data points we think we might use we might
2899.68s:  look at? This here, I think, essentially takes up the first six months, like all of these steps
2910.48s:  combined, the timeline here, probably like the first six months of a general trader's
2917.52s:  cycle. From here is when we get into the heart of the work.
2928.08s:  Oh, duh. I'm so stupid. I forgot that I'm writing with this pen. I have to clear this off. So if
2935.28s:  there's anything on there that you want, make sure you grab it. But I have to clear it off because
2939.92s:  this is in the way. So the next step, which I already forgot what step around was at step five.
2965.76s:  Now that we have some baseline stock market understanding, we have an idea. We've been logging
2978.64s:  stock market movements for a few months. We've developed a general outline for a trading plan,
2986.72s:  a trading log. We've started testing some random trading ideas, realizing most of them suck.
2994.32s:  Some of them make money. There's a really low confidence interval when we put on the trades.
2999.36s:  There's very low predictive value in terms of whether or not we think we're actually going to make
3003.84s:  money or not. All of those things will happen in the first steps leading into this. Then once we
3011.68s:  get to this, we're actually saying, I'm going to take this seriously. At this point,
3024.08s:  this comes into play, the outlier strategy process. This is exactly where you employ this framework
3035.92s:  or whatever framework you have that you prefer at this point. We've already reviewed all of this.
3044.32s:  You're familiar with all of this. But this is where you need to actually go and find profit mechanisms.
3054.08s:  That you can trade. You have to understand them in depth. You have to quantify them, qualify them.
3064.88s:  You have to then start attaching some of those signals that you found earlier that you were tinkering
3070.64s:  with and trying to align those signals with the profit mechanism. To see if you can actually use
3078.32s:  those signals to identify the profit mechanism. From there, you can start playing with what kind of
3084.48s:  options structures might fit. Notice, again, I will continue to reiterate this point every single time
3090.40s:  we look at this. Notice how this is about trading options. Notice how I don't say shit about options
3098.56s:  until the third step in this process related and about specifically trading options. Options
3108.32s:  aren't mentioned until the third step. What does that tell you? It tells you that options are simply
3116.80s:  a vector to capitalize or to extract or to monetize an idea. But you need the idea. There is no
3127.20s:  baked in option anything that's automatically just going to provide you profit. It doesn't exist.
3135.76s:  You have to have a profit mechanism. You have to have some sort of approach to identifying,
3141.84s:  quantifying, qualifying the profit mechanism. And then you can worry about what structures matter.
3149.28s:  The overwhelming majority of options traders, they get stuck worrying if they're going to buy
3155.36s:  five DTE options or seven DTE options to trade this idea. And the reality is both of them are
3161.84s:  probably going to lose money in the long run. We're optimizing for the wrong thing. We have the
3167.12s:  cart so far in front of the horse. You can't even see it. So this step five is probably, I would argue,
3176.56s:  the next 12 to 18 months. And over this 12 to 18 months, you might find three to four.
3191.68s:  Profit mechanisms like good ones. You might find three to four.
3200.24s:  As always, some people might take longer and find more. Some people might find more in shorter time.
3206.48s:  I'm just trying to give you some context, some ideas from somebody who's gone through all of this
3212.96s:  and somebody who's helped other people navigate through all of this. This is what I spent a lot of
3217.36s:  time with the people that are in the coaching stuff and in the discord. And it can be really
3222.64s:  frustrating because a lot of the times it feels like it's like, man, this just takes kind of like a
3226.88s:  lot of time. And I don't really feel like I'm learning as fast as I want. The unfortunate reality is
3234.96s:  we can only move at the pace of time. And time in markets is how we develop experience.
3246.24s:  So some of it is based on our ability to build that context to then come up with ideas.
3254.32s:  So after step five, this becomes easier now. So step six,
3264.64s:  strategy, dev, import folio, use, or implementation. Now, strategy development in this context is taking
3285.44s:  this step here for these three to four profit mechanisms. And it's making sure that they then work
3296.64s:  together at the portfolio level. So here's what I'm talking about in this step. Let me move this.
3306.32s:  And I think this will be clear. If we have a $100,000 portfolio, our goal is 15%
3322.00s:  per year. We already know that we want to minimize total drawdown. So drawdown will be set
3332.80s:  at 35%. We don't want to draw our portfolio down more than 35%. We also know that we have a standard
3344.88s:  W2 job. And we can only look at the market the last last trading hour, the first trading hour,
3351.04s:  first hour. And this isn't for the full hour. This is just sometime during the first hour and last
3358.40s:  hour. So we have our goal. We have our risk parameter. We have some of the qualitative overlay that
3371.68s:  is just a fact of our life that we have to account for. So now as we go through these three to four
3378.56s:  profit mechanisms, if you found one profit mechanism that is following
3390.16s:  Intraday VWAP for an index, guess what? This doesn't matter. This doesn't fit this.
3403.20s:  We can't do this. So even though we might have found a viable profit mechanism that makes sense and
3411.36s:  looks good, it doesn't matter in this context. Now this might lead somebody to say, well, Eric,
3418.32s:  Eric, why wouldn't we first try to define our portfolio use case and then go find
3432.16s:  edge that fits it? It's a great question. Does anybody have a guess why it's this way? And anybody
3443.68s:  that knows me knows that I care a lot about efficiency and I care a lot about rock solid process.
3450.40s:  So there's a reason. Anybody have an idea what that reason is?
3462.48s:  Ben says IDK I would ask why is well, and it's a good question. It's a very natural question. So I'm
3470.88s:  glad that you would ask that. But as you might guess, there is a reason. Does anybody have a guess
3479.20s:  what the reason might be? None. Because it consumes time. No, that's a good guess.
3496.08s:  I mean, realistically, arguably, the step five and step six here would consume more time, wouldn't it?
3504.24s:  Saying that we just go try to find edge and then we try to fit stuff in the portfolio.
3510.88s:  So also counter to to Pallows point, it actually is less efficient in a way.
3519.60s:  Ben says overall exposure to see different things. That's definitely part of it.
3523.04s:  The reality is for a new trader finding any edge, any edge is a tall enough task.
3541.84s:  So again, taking it back to a sports analogy, this is like what Gordon Ryan does in
3550.48s:  Jiu Jitsu, where as he's competing with world class athletes, he'll have a letter that he signs
3561.68s:  before the match. And he says how he's going to submit his world class opponent before the match
3570.32s:  starts, which for those that don't have context of Jiu Jitsu, even finishing somebody, meaning actually
3576.16s:  getting a definitive submission is difficult. A lot of them just go by time and points.
3581.92s:  So the fact that not only is he so confident in the submission, but he's also picking what he's
3588.40s:  going to do is like quite literally in elite level move. This is the same. A new options trader
3599.12s:  that has less than five years in the market, especially in this case, less than three years in the
3604.80s:  market coming in and saying, not only am I going to find an edge that I like, but I'm going to be
3613.76s:  able to find an edge that fits all of my parameters. Let me go find that. It's beyond arrogant. It's
3623.92s:  beyond misguided. The probability of an actual new options trader finding an edge literally at all
3634.64s:  in case you need a reminder is low. It's very low. If we take a look at what is the
3644.40s:  probability of a regular options trader finding an edge, it's exceedingly low. So that's why this
3656.88s:  is a scenario where we are knowingly doing something that's slightly suboptimal because of the
3664.00s:  landscape and because of the reality of what we're doing. This is exactly why. If a new options
3670.80s:  trader can find any edge, that is an incredible start. It's literally an incredible start.
3680.24s:  So whether that edge can be traded during market hours when you're able to get to the markets
3685.20s:  or anything, it doesn't even matter yet. The fact that you can even find it is huge because
3692.24s:  if you're able to actually genuinely find a true edge that you can extract that you can monetize
3697.84s:  over time, then you can absolutely become more selective.
3705.68s:  Paul says, how do you know that you've found an edge? That's an absolutely great question.
3710.32s:  And the funny answer to that is the way that you know you've found an edge is when you don't have
3715.68s:  to ask anymore, which I know sounds kind of silly, but it is the exact truth. Once you are onto
3722.72s:  something that you can consistently see results of some sort with some sort of predictive value
3728.80s:  that is based on something logical, then you know that you're probably onto something and you'll
3736.88s:  see it start to materialize. Now to talk about this from a general perspective, because
3744.88s:  Paulo also in his question brings up a really important point, which is that of discerning return
3751.60s:  path from just AppenStance. Part of that again comes from this process.
3760.88s:  By actually defining the market effect and then doing research on that market effect.
3772.72s:  So for example, a well-known market effect is variances premiums. You've heard me talk about a
3777.68s:  million times because it is actually a defined market effect that we know is there reliably.
3783.28s:  Sick. Sick story, bro. But I know then because this is something that is well researched,
3791.12s:  it's documented. I can look at studies about it. I can see it in the market to confirm what I'm seeing.
3800.08s:  Then I already know I'm kind of off to a good start. I already know that I'm looking at something
3806.40s:  that's based on something. So that's exactly how two things come into play. The first thing is
3816.24s:  finding something that we actually can even identify that we're going down the right path in the
3822.64s:  beginning and then building off of that. That's exactly how if I were a new trader trying to
3830.24s:  identify in edge in the beginning, that's exactly what I would do. Is I would start with something
3836.16s:  that probably knowingly doesn't have a ton of edge, but it has something there and it's based on
3843.28s:  a well-documented market effect that I know exists for a reason and it's logical and then trying
3849.36s:  to find ways to monetize that. That's the exact way I would start. Now to just put a bow on this
3860.80s:  and then happily turn it into just an open Q&A for the next 15-20 minutes.
3870.00s:  It's not a lot of steps, but sitting down and actually doing this work is absolutely what is
3881.52s:  required. If somebody is unwilling to do this work, then the probability of you being a successful
3888.56s:  trader long-term is about zero. If you are willing to do this work, it is highly, genuinely,
3896.56s:  highly probable that you will find something. It doesn't necessarily mean that you'll hit your
3901.20s:  portfolio goals. It doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to smash the S&P 500 every year.
3905.68s:  It all depends on what you find and how adept you are at employing it, but the overwhelming
3912.48s:  probabilities you'll find something because there's a lot of stuff out there that exists right now
3916.88s:  that we know exists that's well studied and documented. If again, you start with something like
3922.48s:  that as your base, then you can very easily iterate that into something more meaningful over time
3929.76s:  as you're exploring other ideas. In my opinion, this is the first two years for a new options trader.
3939.76s:  There's a lot of iterative learning going on during this time frame, continuing to try to read new
3945.52s:  books, expand your general knowledge base. There's using things like chat GPT to help make sure that
3952.48s:  it's quizzing you so that you're continuing to validate your knowledge. There's using those
3957.68s:  external audits or AARs. The discord that's free to join for everybody is a great place to do this.
3964.40s:  You can literally ask somebody in their hey, can you just quiz me on options? Just literally,
3970.80s:  ask a few questions. That's useful for everybody. But there's no reason to grossly over complicate
3978.72s:  the beginning stages for an options trader because there's already enough going on that you have to
3984.24s:  tangle with. So there's the next 24 months for anybody that's been a part of the series so far.
3994.00s:  So before we turn to just open Q&A, I do want to say for those that actually stuck out the whole
4000.32s:  thing from me to you, solid job. There's a lot to do here. Your work literally is just starting.
4007.20s:  But I think that this will provide a usable foundation. And my hope for doing these sessions
4015.44s:  is not just to give you a video to watch, but to give you an honest,
4022.72s:  earnest take on trading, what it takes to be successful and to try to set you down the right path.
4029.92s:  I think sometimes some of the things that I say, they're a little bit disheartening also to me
4036.16s:  because I don't want to sound like I'm trying to dissuade anybody from trying to trade. I really
4041.44s:  think it's good for everybody to at least try. But I think what's more damaging is making it seem
4048.80s:  easier than it is, or just covering over the rough spots to make it more approachable. And I think
4058.96s:  that that hurts people because the majority of people that start trading options are the exact
4064.56s:  group of people that typically don't have a bunch of money to lose because I know that that's
4068.64s:  exactly why I started trading options because I did not have money and I was trying to figure out how
4073.04s:  to make money. So that's my TED talk. I hope that the series is good for you. I do plan to run
4080.64s:  another one of these at some point throughout the rest of the year, maybe one or two more.
4086.48s:  And we will absolutely dive into another one in the future. But I'll turn it over to just a general
4094.32s:  Q&A throw anything you want. In the chat, I will happily roll through those. I'm going to go grab the
4101.20s:  manager, Thor just finished his dinner. So I'll grab him and then we'll get to it.
4116.56s:  The
4119.76s:  champ is here. The champ is here. He's straight up smelling like dinner. Look, oh look, you guys
4129.92s:  can see his eyes. There's actually light enough for reflection. So if you guys have any, oh,
4138.80s:  and now he's he's tired. He's going to recharge before we go for our walk later. So
4144.00s:  he's ready to he's ready to rock and roll.
4151.60s:  Um, Oliver says, do you think Elon will exceed 30 children? How many kids does he have right now?
4158.24s:  I actually don't know how many he has, but it wouldn't surprise me.
4163.84s:  I do think that because I really believe that he believes that there's a significant imperative
4170.80s:  for him to for him to do that. So I absolutely could see it.
4176.72s:  Reese says, it might have been hung up on the word, but what would you say is your edge?
4180.56s:  Not trying to copy yours just seem hard to define. So I think you can there isn't like
4188.08s:  what is your edge Eric or what is your edge Reese? I have different strategies that have edge.
4199.36s:  So one of my strategies that has edge is the coverage strangle as I've built it.
4205.36s:  And it's something that reliably creates profit and it typically beats the underlying index.
4212.96s:  So it still has down years, right? So it's not again, edge isn't something that's
4219.76s:  nipotent or always, but the strategy in the long run absolutely yields edge. The variance
4226.56s:  risk premiums that I play in index volatility has edge. The earnings place that I trade has edge.
4235.92s:  My pattern recognition when I'm trading breakout setups or breakdown setups has edge.
4243.36s:  So these like these different approaches, it's the approach itself that has edge. I wouldn't think
4250.32s:  of what is your edge as a person or as a trader. I would think it's a little more specific to the
4260.00s:  strategy than that. The reality is, as a trader, you innately have to get a lot of things right.
4266.16s:  And that's just an expectation. It doesn't lead to profit. You'll hear things like discipline,
4271.84s:  risk management, those kinds of things. And you have to have those. There's no debate. You have
4279.04s:  to have those. But even if you have those, it doesn't necessarily mean that you make money.
4284.16s:  So the way to think about it is that like as a trader, there's a bunch of things you have to do
4288.88s:  that are just base expectations. And then what you do beyond that is really the pursuit of edge.
4297.68s:  Policies, how do you go about back tests? It's a good question. The way that I go about back tests
4303.84s:  is by first looking at the market and trying to come up with different ideas based on things
4312.48s:  that I see or things that I think might logically make money. So one of the examples is post-earnings
4321.12s:  announcement drift. Before I knew that that was a thing, I had already been trading it for a while.
4330.80s:  I had come across it and it was an effect that I could see following an earnings release. I didn't
4337.52s:  have it qualified quite the same as a lot of the studies do. I had a different criteria that I
4344.24s:  would use. But what I do is look at the market and based on what I see, I try to find things that I
4351.84s:  think like, hmm, I wonder if I can make money off of that. And then I will then start to develop
4359.68s:  the structure for what I need to have in order to be able to validate or invalidate the idea.
4366.96s:  So the purpose of back testing for me is I'm going to grab a relevant data source of whatever it
4376.40s:  is that I'm trying to look at. So in that case, I'm going to have to find the names that I would
4381.28s:  trade earnings. And I need to get their price performance details around earnings and then the
4386.24s:  earnings details around, you know, the specific duration. And then I would start programming it.
4392.96s:  Now I typically use Python. Now I think with the advent of chat GPT, people have slightly more
4399.84s:  capability, although I have tried to use it for stuff like that. And it's really not that good.
4404.32s:  So I think I would use it more as like an accelerator for back testing, not to actually run it. It's
4409.60s:  very unreliable with the logic that it tries to use sometimes. But I think it'll get better.
4415.52s:  And then I approach back testing, not in an attempt to turn something into something.
4427.04s:  I look at a back test literally to see what's there. And first to start with standard measurement.
4435.12s:  And then after that, I go through, I segment the data. I try to make sure that I'm following good
4441.92s:  data hygiene. And then I can start overlaying some basic criteria to see if my general approach or
4450.32s:  idea might make sense on a risk adjusted return. Now a really important thing when it comes to back
4457.04s:  testing is the tendency for people is to say like, Oh, I noticed that this helped my returns.
4466.64s:  Let me try adding this on top of it and let me try adding this on top of that.
4471.92s:  And then you kind of start with this base effect that after you add 32 filters, it looks great
4477.60s:  in a back test. That is obviously what we would call overfitting. And the danger is trying to
4485.04s:  strike a really good balance between optimizing something so that you know that you're extracting
4490.48s:  as much of it as you can, which does require parameterization. But without going too far.
4496.96s:  And the way that I validate that is through different kinds of robustness checks. You can segment,
4502.80s:  you can check variance between segments. And then you can forward project with out of sample data,
4508.88s:  that kind of stuff. So the whole purpose of back testing and the approach I follow is essentially
4514.64s:  that. And then the last thing I would mention is even if I have a good back test, that doesn't mean
4520.96s:  that the strategy works or that the idea is valid. It just means that it's not a bad idea to test.
4526.48s:  And then to go from there, because a back test, even if you account really diligently for things
4532.40s:  like slippage, for cost and stuff like that, there's a lot more to it. And when you're actually
4539.84s:  trying to employ it on an actively trading market. So the back test is a way to quickly. And then
4547.68s:  slightly less quickly, more in depth, validate ideas. But it will not represent the actual performance
4556.16s:  of the strategy. I can go grab a water beer back.
4577.68s:  All right. Hey, yo, Lauren just hooked a bunch of people up. Thank you very much for doing that,
4604.72s:  Lauren. Very nice. Thank you. Lauren says, I just want to thank you for doing this, learned a lot,
4609.28s:  and appreciate taking the time to do it. That's awesome. That really is like really encouraging to
4614.32s:  hear, especially as simple as it is. Because a lot of the times when I'm doing stuff like this and
4619.52s:  talking about this, I obviously do my best. And I hope it's stuff that's useful. But I never fully
4628.80s:  know like if what I'm actually talking about is connecting if it makes sense, if it's logical.
4634.40s:  So I really am stoked to hear that it's something that's like useful for you that was hopefully
4642.32s:  right level. I don't want stuff to be too easy. But I also don't want stuff to be
4647.44s:  egregiously difficult for this. And I want there to be like clean takeaways. So yeah, that's
4652.88s:  awesome. Thank you very much for mentioning it. Ben says, how much what you do is discretionary
4660.48s:  for a systematic as far as edge, everything I do is discretionary. I have ideas that are based
4669.76s:  on effects that I can observe and measure, but the way that I implement them is always with discretion.
4677.28s:  There's absolutely ways to systematically extract edge as a retail trader. It's just much more
4683.92s:  difficult. And it's the kind of edge that you can extract in those circumstances tends to be
4694.64s:  slightly lower than what you can actually pull once you're an experienced trader applying that
4701.52s:  experience. There's value. There's objectively value and experience as a trader. You have to
4708.80s:  temper it because sometimes the intuition or the approach that traders will have will be to
4715.60s:  overweight their experience at the wrong times or underweight it at others, which negatively
4720.48s:  impacts their performance. But there's definitely value and experience as a trader. So I always
4727.52s:  the saying that I use for that is the trader always has the last say. So even if I'm doing
4735.60s:  something that has a specific parameter that I typically would follow because it generally makes
4740.16s:  sense, I always allow myself to deviate. And it's because I've developed enough trust in myself
4747.12s:  that I know I wouldn't deviate for some sort of half-baked random idea that's based on an impulse.
4752.96s:  And the deviation typically would be because I'm seeing something that I know isn't captured
4759.36s:  in what I did previously in building the strategy. So I need to react differently to that scenario.
4766.56s:  So good question.
4769.44s:  Jordan says can Edge be found by being very familiar with the specific equity and then coming up with
4774.40s:  option structure that works for that snapshot in time? Could you expand? I follow your question.
4780.48s:  But depending on how you're thinking about it would lead to the yes or no.
4787.44s:  In a high level, the answer absolutely could be yes. But the option structure itself is not
4793.92s:  necessarily what would be delivering on the edge in that specific underlying.
4803.28s:  So I need to understand your use of that a little bit more.
4810.24s:  At a high level, if you think about developing like a really close relationship with a specific
4829.36s:  stock, you absolutely can then identify anomalies. Jordan says, for example, you mentioned how you
4841.76s:  tend to always run a covered strangle in IWM is that edge. Well, the strategy is Edge. And I mean,
4849.04s:  the funny element of that is I haven't traded a covered strangle in IWM in several years now.
4855.76s:  So the reason being is we have to adapt to evolving market conditions. So for example, IWM over
4868.00s:  the last several years, small caps in general have performed very, very poorly. Jordan says must be an
4874.08s:  old video. Definitely was I know the ones that you're talking about like the old covered strangle videos.
4879.28s:  Because if we take a look at let's just take a look at like a quad chart. So it's not like obnoxiously noisy.
4888.72s:  Here. And let's bring these back. Let's go back 10 year monthly.
4899.52s:  What do you notice? What do you notice about these as you go into 2021?
4909.44s:  What's happened here?
4914.56s:  Is the total returns generated from small caps have absolutely cratered for the longest time.
4922.56s:  Small caps were far more favorable in terms of total return. It's because they're a higher volatility.
4928.80s:  So the amount of growth that you would get from small caps typically would be more than what you
4932.96s:  would get from large caps and mega caps. But what ended up happening in 2021 like post COVID is we
4940.24s:  entered actually a really restrictive environment that made it very, very challenging for small caps to
4948.40s:  make a bunch of money. So if we measure from here to here, I want you to notice something. And this
4956.40s:  has everything to do with the change in market paradigm. This is the COVID drop. And then this is
4965.52s:  the recovery out of the COVID drop. If I look inside the S&P 500, it rallied 118% from the
4976.56s:  trial of the COVID drop to the following peak. If we look at that in small caps, it rallied 150%.
4989.36s:  Almost another 50% on top of what you saw in spy. A massive variance in favor of small caps.
4996.08s:  And this at this point, I was still trading the Russell. This is actually when I had an old video,
5001.92s:  I don't know if it's still out there, but I had an old video talking about managing the
5006.80s:  coverage strangle during like a really big market drop because I had a coverage strangle out at
5011.68s:  that exact time. What happened here is this period here heavily favored small caps. But then as we
5023.60s:  had to get into a more restrictive fiscal policy environment, small caps have lagged ever since.
5031.28s:  So you can see effectively from 2021, it just ran sideways. And this is as rates and inflation
5039.92s:  was going up, which is very difficult for small caps. So I very, very regularly trade small caps
5046.32s:  and absolutely would again. But the problem is is the current market conditions that we're sitting
5051.60s:  in really, really don't favor them. So I have no other choice but to move into other things.
5059.68s:  Now the broader question though of running the coverage strangle, the coverage strangle as a strategy
5067.12s:  that I've built absolutely has edge because it captures on various risk premiums on the put side
5074.00s:  also puts you. It captures a little bit of premium from the short calls that minorly hedge the
5080.96s:  downside moves that doesn't really cap my upside potential because they're sold at a ratio.
5086.88s:  And I also aggressively manage them typically to avoid assignment on those short calls.
5092.40s:  I also apply a value averaging approach, which is a way to effectively create returns out of
5100.88s:  volatility. So that's all part of my scaling strategy in addition to dollar cost averaging.
5107.92s:  So the coverage strangle really takes several effects and it compiles them into what it is and
5116.24s:  what the opportunities are. So to recap those, we have what's skew.
5125.84s:  We have variance risk premiums. We have short call. I don't want to use the term hedge because
5133.36s:  I don't mean it that way, but that is what will be most familiar to people. So I have the short call
5139.36s:  hedge, but then these are also managed to avoid assignment when I want. Then there's dollar cost
5152.24s:  averaging. There's value averaging. And then there's drift that's being played. So the coverage
5162.96s:  strangle is really giving me access to all of these things. And the way that I built a strategy
5170.56s:  is to help me extract all of these things. A great example of this is if we take a look at
5178.24s:  the triple queues. You guys have seen the coverage strangle in here several times now. If I zoom
5185.20s:  this out, because we can get rid of these drawings. I don't really need these.
5193.04s:  But if I zoom out into the time frame where I started trading the coverage strangle in
5199.76s:  T triple queues, which was I want to say maybe October of last year, I started doing like a sample
5206.64s:  portfolio because I've always tinkered with different kinds of leveraged coverage strangles
5213.68s:  as a smaller allocation of the portfolio. But I think it was towards the end of last year, maybe
5220.32s:  October, somewhere in here. But effectively, what I do is let's say I can't remember, let's say it
5227.92s:  was somewhere in here. What I do is in the value averaging and dollar cost averaging as things rally
5235.52s:  up, I try to maintain a certain amount of equity exposure. I'm making money on the short puts and
5242.00s:  I'm rolling the short calls up and out at a loss each time. But I'm moving my bases up and up
5247.76s:  and up. Then as the market starts to unwind heavy, I typically pair down my equity allocation.
5255.20s:  So this is essentially, let's say if I got in here, I'm getting out somewhere in here with some
5261.36s:  of the equity not all. So I'm realizing a profit. So let's say if I started with
5266.72s:  $500, obviously it's more than that for the coverage strangle, but just using smaller numbers,
5273.60s:  for an example. And let's say on this move up here, I make 50 bucks on the equity side of things.
5281.52s:  What this means is I've actually just increased how much I can buy because I have 50 new dollars
5289.60s:  that I didn't add into it externally. And that's just from the equity. That's not including any
5294.24s:  of the performance of the options during the same time frame. So then as it starts going down,
5298.56s:  down, down, down, down, down, I really just kind of slowly scale into it. So then we add another share,
5306.24s:  we add another share. So this is the dollar cost averaging component. So this is DCA, this is VA.
5314.32s:  As I'm dollar cost averaging into it, then when it has its next big up move, I either again decide
5320.72s:  how I want to play it if I'm going to start unwinding on the way up or yada yada yada. But this is
5326.00s:  how I use the coverage strangle to not only play the longer term effect of the indices, which is
5334.40s:  if we zoom out long enough, we can see the longer term effect of the indices is they tend to rally.
5340.72s:  I'll go into QQQs, the underlying in this instance. So this is the last 10 years monthly, right,
5346.40s:  10s to rally. So there's absolutely a drift effect by the market with these. But then I amplify
5355.36s:  my exposure by playing these shorter term moves with options and then a mix of dollar cost averaging
5364.24s:  and value averaging. So all of that is a pretty long answer for you, Jordan. I hope it paints the
5372.56s:  picture though on the difference between just trading the coverage strangle as a structure
5378.64s:  in IWM is an underlying and the steps that actually go into taking the structure into something
5385.36s:  that outperforms the benchmark that it's relative to. That's the broader idea there.
5399.52s:  Anything else you guys got?
5403.36s:  Okay, cool. Yeah, glad it was useful.
5408.88s:  I still have time. I actually totally forgot. I need to start our dinner order. I
5413.52s:  even think about it. Whoops. But obviously happy to get anything else that you guys, any questions,
5425.36s:  anything about trading that you're stuck on. If you're not sure what your personal next steps
5430.00s:  should be, all of that stuff is fair game at this point in time.
5442.16s:  Paul says, do edges have expiration dates? That's actually a really great question. So I would not
5450.88s:  phrase it that way personally. I would phrase it more so that edges can absolutely go into and
5461.84s:  out of favor. That is absolutely the case. So what that means is when we're trying to trade, again,
5473.12s:  some sort of broader market thing like post earnings announcement drift. Post earnings announcement
5479.28s:  drift actually used to be way more prevalent in more names. But in the recent history,
5486.40s:  it's actually slowed down quite a lot. And the reason why it slowed down so much is because of
5492.00s:  general market participants. But what that ultimately means is the total edge has actually shifted
5499.44s:  quite a bit when we're looking at something like post earnings announcement drift.
5506.16s:  So in that context, it absolutely is something that doesn't necessarily have an expiration date.
5514.00s:  But it definitely is something that has a change in the effect over time with without a doubt.
5523.92s:  That is absolutely the case. So yeah, I hope that clarifies that part a little bit for you.
5536.08s:  Ben says, what is your argument for options directionally is not suboptimal as compared to shares?
5545.04s:  What is your argument for options? Directively are not suboptimal compared to share.
5553.44s:  Several reasons. The first reason why I would argue that options can be preferential over shares
5572.80s:  for directional plays is capital efficiency. I think whether you choose to buy options, you can
5581.92s:  access leverage. If you choose to sell options, you can make money even if the market goes slightly
5589.44s:  against you and your directional bet is wrong. So I mean, those are the main ones I would point to.
5596.24s:  Like the main reason why you would buy options comparatively to shares is for leverage. That's
5603.20s:  really the main reason. Through that leverage, you gain guaranteed downside if you buy an option.
5612.88s:  If you sell an option, you don't gain guaranteed downside, but you gain the ability to manage the
5619.20s:  basis through things like rolling. So the fact of the matter is you can just make a lot more money
5627.60s:  with an options trade. Let's just take a look at an example together.
5633.12s:  Let's. I'm not going to pick an individual. Actually, we can pick an individual stock because
5639.92s:  this is one that I traded recently that's been topical Tesla. So if I want to try to trade Tesla
5647.04s:  to the downside, there are a few ways. We can short shares, which is fine. We can sell calls, we can
5658.00s:  buy puts. Now with shorting shares, there's a cost to carry that position. And it is a little bit
5669.68s:  expensive to maintain the position. So let's go to when I first started trading it, which is on this
5676.56s:  drop, specifically below the 50 day moving average here. At this point, the moving averages were
5684.80s:  already negatively inverted. So I had entered a short position here. And then I scaled into it here.
5694.24s:  So I mean, really, we can go to the 29th. Wanted to have earnings. I don't remember.
5700.40s:  After the close, that's right. Because I tried. I was going to trade earnings for it, but then I
5706.32s:  I had started entering a short position, but came out of it from earnings. And then I waited
5712.24s:  to get back in until we dipped below the 50 again. The trade here was really, really embryonic, meaning
5719.92s:  it was early. This was partially hypothesized due to the broader sentiment that was building. It was
5726.40s:  also keyed off by some options activity. But let's take a look at here the third of Feb.
5736.96s:  And we'll just take a look at two comparative positions.
5745.68s:  Well, I guess we could do three. Four. Four. Let's just do four.
5753.04s:  So it's loading right now and then we'll take a look.
5757.84s:  Reese has never heard you mention it since it happened today. Does quadwitching have tradable effects?
5762.64s:  Definitely. It certainly does.
5770.40s:  Let's hit play. So all I'm going to do is we're in on demand right now. We're back in time.
5778.40s:  And I'm going to show you a position. And then we will build a little bit more of a position
5786.80s:  around it so that we can observe the effects over time, which is my goal here.
5796.00s:  So let's do that.
5800.08s:  First thing we could take a look at just selling shares. Let's see how much this would cost.
5805.60s:  I think this is regulation T. Yeah, this is taken 20 grand. It's regulation T.
5815.92s:  So this is not like a portfolio margin account. But what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually
5819.76s:  add it to analyze. And then we'll take a look at this from a portfolio lens. We got to get rid of
5825.60s:  the old stuff that's in here quickly. Give me one sec. So we can get rid of this. We can get rid of this.
5836.00s:  We can get rid of these. And the reason why is I want to keep track of these
5841.12s:  so that we can see how they perform comparatively. We have that one. Then let's say that we think
5848.80s:  it's going to continue to go down for whatever reason. I typically prefer 90 day for the diagonals.
5855.60s:  And let's do two different tranches. So that first one is going to take up 20 grand ish.
5861.68s:  I'm going to effectively use a similar amount of money in this one just to compare it directly.
5868.32s:  So this one is 16 313. So let's add a little more to this one. So we'll add we'll have one
5881.52s:  base position for this trade and then we'll have one kicker. So right now we have like four grand
5887.84s:  left to play with. I would go a little bit lighter than that. But maybe we go to like the 270s.
5895.60s:  We buy these as well. And let's grab a couple more of these 270s. Grab five of those.
5907.20s:  Okay. So now let's fast forward time. We'll just go to the fix them. And let's see how we do here.
5918.48s:  All I'm going to do is effectively monitor what the value for these would be at this point in time.
5930.16s:  And then we can do the P&L for each. First we'll take a look at just the equity.
5938.56s:  Okay. So our equity position right now is making 11,250 bucks. That's where it's sitting at.
5955.20s:  At this 11343. Sorry. 11343. Now let's take a look at the options position.
5961.36s:  The options position is making 20,830. So it's making effectively double using actually a little bit less money from the other trade.
5977.84s:  So this is an example of and this isn't optimized by the way. A more optimized trade here would have been meaning if I want to like really overfit to prove the point.
5989.52s:  I would have just done $20,000 worth of out of the money options, but I wouldn't trade that way. So even though it would make for a better back test, you know, in this sample or the example more broadly. It's just not reflective of reality.
6002.56s:  So this is like an actual position that I put on not this one specifically, but close to it where there is a deep in the money leg and then there are kickers outside of it.
6013.44s:  So this is an example of how rather than trading the underlying in this case, we're just talking about downside.
6021.52s:  It doesn't matter if it's down side or upside same concept supply. But when we're trading the underlying this makes the options component makes more money with less total risk and less money utilized.
6034.72s:  Then the long equity component.
6038.72s:  So Ben, let me know if that answers the perspective of why options would not inherently be suboptimal for directional place compared to the underlying.
6055.28s:  Ben says I have just read options for price direction due to they don't have linear reaction to price as with shares, as well as paying more due to liquidity of option.
6071.68s:  I don't follow that last part.
6075.28s:  But the other inaccuracy with your statement is actually some options do have linear reaction to price.
6084.72s:  Just to be aware.
6088.72s:  So what you're referring to there is the variance of delta and gamma.
6097.68s:  But if you have an option that has a delta of one, it will move linearly with the underlying.
6108.72s:  Ben says you're losing money on your fills. I see. Yeah, there definitely is less liquidity and options than the underlying outright.
6118.72s:  I absolutely would agree with that point.
6121.88s:  The underlying itself is also going to have slippage. So in this case, you can see Tesla at this point was bid at 270, 28 offered at 270, 50.
6132.68s:  So this also has a bid-ass spread. And effectively, if you multiply this by 100, the bid-ass spread sometimes on the equity can be even worse.
6141.72s:  It's rare that it would be the case, but it can be.
6144.68s:  So let's take a look at an example here.
6147.72s:  If we take a look at just these 270 options, which we bought that we have to get out of these are 25 cents wide.
6153.72s:  If you multiply 25 cents, I'm 100, you get 25. So that's effectively the slippage here.
6162.72s:  If you take a look at the bid-ass spread on this, it's what, 22 cents.
6168.72s:  So really not that different is the broader point.
6173.72s:  The bid-ass, and again, if you do that on 100 shares for the equity, that's, you're going to pay that 22 cents, 22 bucks.
6181.72s:  So it's actually not that different.
6184.72s:  And very frequently, options will be less liquid. I'm not arguing that options are more liquid. They're definitely not.
6189.72s:  But they're not inherently like way off compared to the equity, especially during volatile periods.
6199.72s:  So Risa says the leverage should make up for the spread, also trading liquid underlines helps.
6207.72s:  Yep, two super important points. And understanding how volatility behaves, right?
6212.72s:  Like when markets are going through broader drawdowns, then things inherently are going to become more volatile and widen out of it.
6221.72s:  So yeah.
6225.72s:  Sweet.
6227.72s:  Well, I have my dinner order launched. So I'm just going to turn to making a video, but I'm happy if anybody else has any other questions that you want to hit before we wrap up.
6238.72s:  Feel free to throw it in.
6241.72s:  Obviously happy to hang out a bit longer on this one, because this is our season finale. This is where we're designed to pull everything together.
6250.72s:  So I hope.
6254.72s:  I hope you guys walk away with a pretty effective forward looking plan. That's the that's the general intent.
6264.72s:  Cool.
6266.72s:  That makes me complete for the season.
6271.72s:  And I hope if you guys have any questions, as always, you'll reach back out. We'll kick another one of these off in a few months.
6277.72s:  But in the meantime, if you have any questions, as always, hit your boy up. Be an outlier.
6282.72s:  See you later.
